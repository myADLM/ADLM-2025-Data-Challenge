H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The xTAG® Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) is a multiplexed nucleic acid test
intended for the simultaneous qualitative detection and identification of multiple viral,
bacterial and parasitic nucleic acids in human stool specimens or human stool in Cary
Blair media from individuals with signs and symptoms of infectious colitis or
gastroenteritis. The following pathogen types, subtypes and toxin genes are identified
using the xTAG GPP:
Viruses:
• Adenovirus 40/41
• Norovirus GI/GII
• Rotavirus A
Bacteria:
• Campylobacter (C. jejuni, C. coli and C. lari only)
• Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxin A/B
2

--- Page 3 ---
• Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157
• Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) LT/ST
• Salmonella
• Shiga-like Toxin producing E. coli (STEC) stx 1/stx 2
• Shigella (S. boydii, S. sonnei, S. flexneri and S. dysenteriae)
• Vibrio cholerae (V. cholerae) cholera toxin gene (ctx)
Parasites:
Cryptosporidium (C. parvum and C. hominis only)
·
• Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica)
• Giardia (G. lamblia only - also known as G. intestinalis and G. duodenalis)
The detection and identification of specific gastrointestinal microbial nucleic acid from
individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal infection aids in the
diagnosis of gastrointestinal infection when used in conjunction with clinical evaluation,
laboratory findings and epidemiological information. A gastrointestinal microorganism
multiplex nucleic acid-based assay also aids in the detection and identification of acute
gastroenteritis in the context of outbreaks.
®
xTAG GPP positive results are presumptive and must be confirmed by FDA-
cleared tests or other acceptable reference methods.
The results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or
other patient management decisions. Confirmed positive results do not rule out co-
infection with other organisms that are not detected by this test, and may not be the sole
or definitive cause of patient illness. Negative xTAG® Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel
results in the setting of clinical illness compatible with gastroenteritis may be due to
infection by pathogens that are not detected by this test or non-infectious causes such as
ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or Crohn's disease.
xTAG GPP is not intended to monitor or guide treatment for C. difficile infections.
The xTAG GPP is indicated for use with the Luminex® 100/200™ instrument with
xPONENT® software.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only. Manufacturer must provide device-specific user training to
facilities prior to using the device.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Extraction: Biomerieux NucliSens® EasyMag® instrument

Analysis: Luminex® 100/200™ instruments with xPONENT® software.
I. Device Description:
The Luminex Molecular Diagnostics xTAG GPP consists of kit reagents and software. The
reagents in conjunction with a thermal cycler are used to perform nucleic acid amplification
(reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction, or RT‐PCR/PCR), and the protocol
configuration file is used to generate results while the data analysis software (TDAS GPP (US))
is used to analyze the results from the Luminex Corporation Luminex 100/200 instrument system
(which includes the xPONENT core software).
The components of the xTAG GPP kit are contained within 2 boxes (one that is frozen, and one
that is refrigerated). The kit is shipped with the xTAG GPP CD which contains the xTAG GPP
T‐A (LX) protocol configuration file and the TDAS GPP (US) software. The instrument is
shipped with the xPONENT software.
The xTAG Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (xTAG GPP) incorporates multiplex reverse
transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR / PCR) with Luminex's proprietary
universal tag sorting system on the Luminex platform. The assay also detects an internal control
(bacteriophage MS2) that is added to each sample prior to extraction. Each sample is pre‐treated
prior to extraction and is then put through extraction using the Biomerieux NucliSens EasyMag
kit (product code JJH, class I, an IVD‐labeled automated system for nucleic acid extraction).
Post‐extraction, for each sample, 10 μL of extracted nucleic acid is amplified in a single
multiplex RT‐PCR/PCR reaction. Each target or internal control in the sample results in PCR
amplicons ranging from 58 to 202 bp (not including the 24‐mer tag). A five μL aliquot of the
RT‐PCR product is then added to a hybridization/detection reaction containing bead populations
coupled to sequences from the Universal Array ("antitags"), streptavidin, R‐phycoerythrin
conjugate. Each Luminex bead population detects a specific microbial target or control through a
specific tag/anti‐tag hybridization reaction. Following the incubation of the RT‐PCR products
with the xTAG GPP Bead Mix and xTAG Reporter Buffer, the Luminex instrument sorts and
reads the hybridization/detection reactions.
A signal, or median fluorescence intensity (MFI), is generated for each bead population. These
fluorescence values are analyzed to establish the presence or absence of bacterial, viral or
parasitic targets and/or controls in each sample. A single multiplex reaction identifies all targets.
The xTAG Data Analysis Software for the Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (TDAS GPP (US))
analyzes the data to provide a report summarizing which pathogens are present. Before data are
analyzed, a user has the option to select a subset of the targets from the intended use of the
xTAG GPP (for each sample). Consequently the remaining target results are masked and cannot
be retrieved.
Target results above or equal to the cutoff are considered positive, while target results below the
cutoff are considered negative. For each sample analyzed by TDAS GPP (US), there are
individual results for each of the targets and the internal control (bacteriophage MS2).

L. Test Principle:
Human stool samples are pretreated and then subjected to nucleic acid extraction. For each
sample, 10 μL of extracted nucleic acid is amplified in a single multiplex RT‐PCR/PCR
reaction. Each target or internal control in the sample results in PCR amplimers ranging from
58 to 202 bp (not including the 24‐mer tag). A five μL aliquot of the RT‐PCR product is then
added to a hybridization/detection reaction containing bead populations coupled to sequences
from the Universal Array ("antitags"), streptavidin, R‐phycoerythrin conjugate. Each
Luminex bead population detects a specific microbial target or control through a specific
tag/anti‐tag hybridization reaction. Following the incubation of the RT‐PCR products with
the xTAG GPP Bead Mix and xTAG Reporter Buffer, the Luminex instrument sorts and
reads the hybridization/detection reactions. A signal or median fluorescence intensity (MFI)
is generated for each bead population. These fluorescence values are analyzed to establish the
presence or absence of bacterial, viral or parasitic targets and/or controls in each sample. A
single multiplex reaction identifies all targets.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Site-to-site reproducibility was assessed for each of the additional targets and for
mixed analyte samples (representing co-infected samples). Original study results for
the other analytes were presented in submission k121454. Replicates of simulated
samples were tested across 3 sites by 2 operators at each site. One exception was
made for testing of the Vibrio cholerae samples at Site 3, where due to operator
illness the runs for the second operator were performed by two individuals. All
sample replicates tested were prepared through serial dilutions of stock material (pre-
treated negative stool spiked with a pathogen or positive stool) containing a microbial
target from the intended use. Each sample replicate assayed in the study contained
either a single microbial target or 2 microbial targets detected by xTAG® GPP in
addition to the internal control (bacteriophage MS2). For single analyte samples,
dilutions tested fell into 1 of the following 3 categories:
1. High Negative (HN): microbial target concentrations which generate MFI
values not lower than 20-30% below the cut-off MFI for the indicated analyte
2. Low Positive (LP): microbial target concentrations which generated MFI
values that were 1-5X the cut-off MFI for the indicated analyte
3. Moderate Positive (MP): microbial target concentrations which generated MFI
values 7-10X the cut-off MFI for the indicated analyte
For those samples prepared to simulate co-infections, one microbial target was
present at the LP level defined above and the other at a High Positive (HP) level. HP
levels were defined as follows:
High Positive (HP) viral cultures were prepared to a concentration of 105 PFU/mL
(105 TCID /mL) or higher; High Positive (HP) bacterial cultures were prepared
50
to a concentration of 106 CFU/mL or higher.

--- Page 11 ---
Each sample replicate underwent a single pre-treatment and extraction step. All
samples were extracted using the NucliSens® EasyMAG™ extraction method.
Extracted material was kept frozen at -70°C until testing. A total of 90 replicates
were tested for each single analyte and dual analyte sample (3 replicates per run x 5
runs per operator x 2 operators per site x 3 sites = 90 replicates). Reproducibility was
assessed both in terms of calls and MFI values.
Single Analyte Results
For single analyte samples prepared at the MP level, depending on the microbial
target, 89/90 (99%) to 90/90 (100%) replicates generated a positive result (after
allowable re-runs). For LP dilutions, depending on the microbial target, the correct
positive call was made in 85/90 (94%) to 90/90 (100%) replicates tested. For HN
dilutions, depending on the target, the correct negative call was generated in as few as
67/90 (74%) replicates to as many as 90/90 (100%). Greater variability in the HN
dilution, compared to the LP and MP dilution, is expected based on the fact that a
target is present in these samples at levels sufficient to generate MFI values 20-30%
below the cut-off MFI, and based on the stochastic nature of end-point PCR in the
presence of low levels of targeted analytes. Accordingly, percent variability,
measured as the coefficient of variation (CV) for MFI values were lowest at the MP
dilution and highest at the HN dilution.
Dual Analyte Results
For dual analyte samples tested for the additional targets, all targets generated a
positive call when present as a HP dilution. When present at the LP concentration, 3
of the 4 target combinations tested generated a positive call in 90/90 (100%)
replicates tested. The 4 combinations were:
Rotavirus (HP) / Adenovirus (LP)
Adenovirus (HP) / Rotavirus (LP)
C. difficile (HP) / Adenovirus (LP)
Adenovirus (HP)/ C. difficile (LP)
C. difficile has two probes resulting in a call for this target, (if either is positive, the
target is positive). The following was observed for the remaining target present at LP
concentration in the sample containing a second target at HP concentration:
· 1/90 replicates of the C. difficile (HP) /Adenovirus (LP) sample generated a
negative call for Adenovirus
Although the C. difficile LP sample was 89/90 for probe 1, probe 2 made all the calls
for the LP sample.

Overall, adequate site-to-site reproducibility has been established for all targets that
xTAG® GPP has been designed to detect (also see results in k121454).
Repeatability
As in the original study results presented for k121454, repeatability was assessed for
each target by testing 20 replicates of each of two different analyte concentrations: a
very low positive sample (at the LoD) and a moderate positive dilution level (5x-10x
above the cut-off MFI). All replicates for each dilution level were examined starting
from sample extraction with the bioMérieux NucliSENS® easyMAG® system
followed by xTAG GPP® in a single run. For each set of 20 replicates, the same
operator performed the testing on the same instrument system, using the same lot of
extraction kit and xTAG® GPP reagents. Results of testing were as follows:

The correct qualitative result was obtained for ≥ 19 of 20 replicates at the low
positive level and for 20 of 20 replicates at the moderate positive level for each
analyte tested at these concentrations.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable, qualitative assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Before using the Luminex system to read samples prepared by the xTAG assay, prepare
and calibrate the Luminex instrument system following the procedures in the appropriate
system user manual.
Negative Controls - Negative controls are defined as either RNase-free water added
to the RT-PCR/PCR step (amplification/detection negative control) or lysis buffer
that has undergone the entire assay procedure
(pretreatment/extraction/amplification/detection negative control). At least one
negative control that underwent extraction process must be included in each batch of
specimens run on xTAG GPP. The recommended number of negative controls to be

included in a batch is dependent on batch size. For batches of 1-30 samples, one
negative control must be included. For batches of 31-61 samples, two negative
controls are recommended. For batches of 62-92 samples, three negative controls are
recommended. When running multiple negative controls disperse the controls
throughout the batch.
NOTE: Users will need to identify all the negative controls (including extraction
controls) from the TDAS software before the test data is analyzed. If a negative
control has a significant signal detected for an analyte, the TDAS software will
generate a ‘no call’ for the samples that were positive for the specific analyte and they
will need to be retested.
External Positive Controls - Known strains or positive clinical samples with known
results for the targeted viruses, bacteria or parasites should be included in routine
quality control procedures ("external controls") as positive controls for the assay. At
least one of these external controls are analyte positive controls and should be
included with each batch of patient specimens and controls positive for different
targets should be rotated from batch to batch. External controls should be prepared,
extracted and tested in the same manner as patient samples. Results from external
controls should be examined before the results from the patient samples. The
interpretation of the correct positive control results is performed by the user and not
the data analysis software (TDAS). If a given analyte control does not perform as
expected, all results for that analyte in the batch of samples should be examined to
determine if a re-run is required. If any unexpected calls occur where one or more
analytes with signal exceeding the thresholds are detected in any of the positive
controls (i.e. non-specific positive signals) for a given run then samples that were
positive for the specific analyte(s) that triggered a control failure will need to be re-
run. At least one positive control per PCR run must pass, i.e. all expected calls made
in order to report any results from the plate.
Internal Control - Bacteriophage MS2 is the internal control for the assay. This
internal positive control is added to each patient specimen prior to extraction. This
internal control allows the user to ascertain whether the assay is functioning properly.
Failure to generate a PRES (present) call for the MS2 control indicates a failure at the
extraction step, and/or the reverse-transcription step, and/or the PCR step, and may be
indicative of the presence of amplification inhibitors, which can lead to false negative
results.
d. Detection limit:
As in the original study results presented for k121454, the LoD was assessed by
analyzing serial dilutions of simulated samples made from high-titre stocks of
commercial strains or high-titre clinical specimens (when commercial strains were
not available). All simulated specimens were prepared in negative clinical matrix
(stool). The data from serial dilutions were confirmed in at least 20 replicates of the
15

Stool in Cary Blair Media Limit of Detection Study Results
The purpose of this analytical study was to evaluate the equivalency in the limit of
detection (LoD) between the two sample types: raw stool (sample type from
k121454) and stool in Cary-Blair transport medium (additional sample type
commonly collected) in a representative sub-set of the xTAG GPP targets. One
analyte from each of three pathogen classes (bacterial, parasitic, and viral) was
examined in the form of simulated stool samples and simulated stool samples in
Cary-Blair media. The three representative analytes tested in this study were:
Clostridium difficile, Giardia lamblia and Norovirus GII.The simulated samples were
prepared as a dilution series using high titre stocks.
In the first part of this study, serial dilution curves for each analyte target were made
for both stool and stool in Cary-Blair sample types. These curves were generated by
assessing 3 replicates per sample type of each dilution level, starting from the sample
extraction step. The dilutions for both sample types were prepared in parallel and
analyzed with the xTAG GPP assay on the same plate to minimize variation.
From part 1 of the study, a dilution for each target in each of the sample types was
selected for further confirmation testing. Confirmation of LoD was achieved through
testing of 20 replicates of the selected dilutions starting from sample extraction. In
general, the dilution level corresponding to the lowest concentration of the analyte in
which 3/3 replicates generated positive calls by xTAG GPP was selected for LoD
confirmation testing for that sample type. LoD was considered as confirmed if the
selected dilution level gave POSITIVE calls for ≥19/20 of the replicates.

The data summarized above demonstrate that raw stool samples and stool samples in
Cary-Blair media have equivalent limits of detection.
e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical Reactivity
Analytical reactivity was assessed through empirical testing of a wide range of
clinically relevant GI pathogen strains, genotypes, serotypes and isolates representing
temporal and geographical diversity for each analyte. Through testing of unique
samples covering the additional intended use pathogens, reactivity was established at
concentrations 2 to 3 times the limit of detection.
Adenovirus - The Limit of Detection (LoD) using Adenovirus 40, Zeptometrix
0810084CF (Dugan) and Adenovirus 41, Zeptometrix 0810085CF (Tak) were found
to be 1.45E+01 TCID /mL (or 4.89E+06 Copies/mL) and 7.69E+00 TCID /mL (or
50 50
1.48E+07 Copies/mL), respectively (see LoD section above). The following two
samples were tested at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
(Atlanta, Georgia, USA). Note: these samples were different isolates of the strains
used in the LoD study. The amount of the viral target DNA for GP-093 and GP-094
was measured by real-time PCR and the Ct values generated were used to calculate
the DNA copy number. The lowest reactivity titers for GP-093 and GP-094, were
found to be at 3x and 1x multiple of LoD level, respectively.

Entamoeba histolytica - The LoD for this pathogen was not confirmed prior to this
Analytical Reactivity study initiation; thus, serial dilutions of the samples were
prepared and tested. The LoD using Entamoeba histolytica, ATCC 30890 was later
found to be 2.88E+01 Cells/mL, equivalent to 4.30E+02 Copies/mL (see LoD section
above). For E.histolytica, ATCC 50007, 50481, 50738 and 50454, the titer
information expressed in Cells/mL could not be obtained. To standardize the
quantification units for all E.histolytica strains, in this Analytical Reactivity study the
amount of target DNA was measured by real-time PCR and the Ct values generated
were used to calculate the DNA copy numbers. The reactivity titers for most of the
strains were in the range of 0.4x to 6.7x multiple of LoD level for E.histolytica. The
reactivity titer for ATCC 50738 (Rahman) was found to be 0.2x multiple of LoD
level.

Summary

--- Page 20 ---
Vibrio cholerae - The LoD using Vibrio cholerae Pacini ATCC 14101 (serovar O:1)
was found to be 2.34E+06 CFU/mL. For this Analytical Reactivity study
3xLoD=7.02E+06 CFU/mL was used for initial reactivity testing. In addition to
toxinogenic strains, (i.e. O1 and O139), the xTAG GPP assay also detects any non:O1
Vibrio cholerae strains that do express ct toxin gene (xTAG GPP Vibrio cholerae
primers target gene), but not the non:O1 strains that may cause clinical symptoms
such as diarrhea by expressing a different virulence factor, which is likely the case for
sample ATCC 14374 and other non:O1 strains in this table. Both non-O1 ATCC
25872 and non-O1 ATCC 25873 strains, were tested in sequencing assays and
confirmed to contain the ctx gene with well conserved xTAG GPP Vibrio cholerae
primer binding regions.

Analytical Specificity and Potential Interfering Agents
Analytical specificity was assessed with respect to the following:
1. Propensity for cross-reactivity leading to false positive results: Potential cross
reactivity with pathogens (viruses, bacteria and parasites) associated with
gastrointestinal (GI) infections that are not probed by the assay. Potential cross
reactivity was also assessed for commensal flora and non-microbial agents.
Organisms were tested at high positive titres.
2. Propensity for interference leading to false negative results: Potential
interference by pathogens (viruses, bacteria and parasites) associated with
gastrointestinal (GI) infections that are not probed by the assay. Potential
interference by commensal flora was also assessed. Panel analytes were tested
at low positive concentrations in the presence of highly concentrated non-panel
organisms.
3. Propensity for competitive interference leading to false negative results:
Potential interference by GI pathogens that are detected by the assay was
evaluated by testing one microbial target prepared at a concentration near the
assay cut-off (LP) in the presence of a second microbial target prepared at a
very high concentration (HP), and vice-versa. The combinations of analytes
tested were selected based on the frequency of co-infections reported in the
literature.
Results for the 3 categories of testing outlined above were detailed in the decision
summary presented for submission k12454 which are still applicable for the
additional 3 analytes.
The following additions relevant to results for the additional 3 analytes are presented
below:
Astrovirus was used as a representative interfering pathogen associated with
gastrointestinal (GI) infections that are not probed by the assay (See table below).
The xTAG GPP analyte, in this case Adenovirus 40/41, was also run without a second
analyte present. No interference was seen.
Non-panel interference with common commensal bacteria, yeast and parasites was
evaluated for each target in the xTAG GPP assay. Low positive samples of each
analyte target in the assay were tested in the presence of a high positive sample of the
potential interfering microorganism. All non-panel bacteria and yeast were tested at a

concentration of 6 x 10^8 cfu/mL except for Blastocystis hominis (ATCC 50587 -
concentration ≥ 1 x 10^6 cells/mL and ATCC 50608 - concentration 2.00 x 10^7
cells/mL). There was no interference found with the xTAG GPP analytes
Adenovirus, Entamoeba histolytica and Vibrio cholera.
However, cross-reactivity was observed with a false positive call for one Entamoeba
dispar strain. PRA‐353, tested at 3.0E+05 cells/mL (highest available stock
concentration), produced a low positive call for E. histolytica with the average MFI of
419.5. Tested at a fourfold dilution of the stock (7.5E+04 cells/mL), this strain was
negative for E. histolytica (average MFI 149.8) and all other GPP analytes. In
addition, five different E. dispar strains (including PRA-353) were sequenced at
LMD with primers flanking the xTAG GPP kit E. histolytica primer binding region.
All five of the E. dispar sequences were identical in the E. histolytica GPP kit
amplicon region. The forward primer was a perfect match to the E. dispar sequences,
whereas the reverse primer had multiple mismatches, most notably, a 2‐nt contiguous
mismatch on the 3’ end. These mismatches in the reverse primer would likely cause a
significant decrease in amplification efficiency, and, therefore, result in a low risk of
obtaining a false‐positive xTAG GPP result for E. histolytica. However, as the xTAG
GPP testing demonstrated, a false‐positive call is possible when E. dispar is present at
a very high concentration, 3.0E+05 cells/mL (or > 104 times LoD for E. histolytica) or
higher. Therefore, this information will be included in product labeling.

Potential interference with GI pathogens that are a part of the assay (competitive
interference) was evaluated with one target prepared at a concentration near the assay
cut-off (LP) and the other target prepared at a very high concentration (HP) and vice
versa. In each case, xTAG GPP Analyte 1 was also run without a second analyte
present. Results (interference in making the appropriate calls) are shown in the table
below. There was no competitive interference observed between pathogens probed
by xTAG GPP when testing was carried out with the mixed analyte samples

The pathogens listed in the table below were not attainable. However, an in silico
analysis was performed to assess the potential for non-specific cross-reactivity of
these microbial pathogens with the primers used in xTAG GPP (BLAST results
located in the design history file). These pathogens do not exhibit sufficient sequence
homology against the xTAG GPP primer sequences, and therefore would not be
expected to cross-react with the exception of Entamoeba coli and Taenia saginata.

contig. on the 3’ end) and reverse primer E_coli_stx1-Rev_Biosg_2 (10 bp contig. on
the 3’ end), as well as an amplimer size (138 bp) which is well within the design of
the kit. To further elucidate, a thermal melting temperature (Tm) analysis was
performed using the DINAMelt (Di-Nucleic Acid hybridization and melting
prediction) program available at http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/?q=DINAMelt.
Sequences of Entamoeba coli that aligned to the xTAG primers were analyzed to see
if they would form a stable interaction with the xTAG primers which could possibly
result in cross reactivity with the xTAG GPP kit. Mismatches would negatively
impact the Tm of the primers and Entamoeba coli. At the xTAG GPP reaction
temperature of 58°C, the Entamoeba coli sequences would bind to the E. histolytica
forward primer with approximately 64.4% of the Entamoeba coli sequences bound to
the primer sequence, compared to binding of the forward primer to its target sequence
without any mismatches (98.3%). However, binding of the reverse E. coli stx1
primer to Entamoeba coli would be reduced to 0.1% compared to this primer binding
to its target sequence without any mismatches (81.8%). Therefore, Entamoeba coli is
not likely to cross-react with the analytes in the xTAG GPP assay.
Carry-over Contamination
The likelihood of carry-over contamination events was initially assessed and
presented in k121454 by testing 2 representative pathogens (a bacteria and a parasite):
C. difficile, and Giardia respectively. In this study, a representative virus
(Adenovirus 40) was tested. This analyte was examined in the form of simulated
samples prepared at concentrations just below the assay cut-off (High Negative, HN)
and well above the assay cut-off (High Positive, HP). The target was examined in a
set of 6 independent extractions. Each extraction was assayed in duplicate arranged
in a checkerboard manner on a 96-well plate using xTAG GPP.
As with the results in k121454 for the representative bacteria (C. difficile) and
parasite (Giardia), results with the virus (Adenovirus 40) showed that all 144 high
negative samples remained negative when run on the Luminex® 100/200™
instrument for all three targets (100% HN). In addition, results for Adenovirus 40
showed that all 144 high positive samples remained positive when run on the
Luminex® 100/200™ instrument (100% HP), as with the targets previously tested.
Therefore a lack of carryover contamination has been demonstrated.
f. Assay cut-off:
The description of the cut-off determination process was initially presented in
k121454. The table below details the final cutoff values selected for each of the 3
additional targets probed by the xTAG GPP assay.

Fresh vs. Frozen
The purpose of this evaluation was to generate data to support the hypothesis that no
significant difference in the performance of xTAG GPP would be observed between
specimens tested from the “fresh” state (i.e., unfrozen) and specimens that were tested
after being stored frozen at -70°C to -80°C. The results of this study will be used to
support (or reject) the inclusion of frozen clinical specimens in the multi-site method
comparison clinical evaluation of xTAG GPP. The description of this evaluation was
initially presented in k121454. The tables below detail the results for each of the 3
additional targets, Adenovirus 40/41, Entamoeba histolytica and Vibrio cholerae
probed by the xTAG GPP assay.
One Month Stability Results
Positive agreement between fresh and frozen un-extracted specimens was ³ 95% with
a lower bound of the 95% (two-sided) confidence interval exceeding 85% for
Adenovirus 40/41 and Vibrio cholerae.
Positive agreement between fresh and frozen pre-treated specimens was ³ 95% with a
lower bound of the 95% (two-sided) confidence interval exceeding 85% for
Adenovirus 40/41, Entamoeba histolytica and Vibrio cholerae.
Positive agreement between fresh and frozen extracted specimens was ³ 95% with a
lower bound of the 95% (two-sided) confidence interval exceeding 85% for
Adenovirus 40/41, Entamoeba histolytica and Vibrio cholerae.
Adenovirus 40/41 and Vibrio cholerae met the 1-month stability acceptance criteria,
and the MFIs generated on HP, MP and LP replicates of frozen un-extracted,
extracted and extracted specimens were generally close to those generated at baseline.
However, the un-extracted specimen stability of Entamoeba histolytica did not meet
the acceptance criteria.
Three Month Stability Results
Positive agreement between fresh and frozen un-extracted specimens was ³ 95% with
a lower bound of the 95% (two-sided) confidence interval exceeding 85% for
Adenovirus 40/41, Entamoeba histolytica and Vibrio cholerae.
Positive agreement between fresh and frozen extracted specimens was ³ 95% with a

The 3-month stability results for Entamoeba histolytica are of particular interest as
they do not reflect the 1-month stability results. That is study criteria were met for
the un-extracted specimen at 3-month stability time point but not at the 1-month time
point. The 3-month stability data supports the stability of un-extracted Entamoeba
histolytica frozen at -70°C to -80°C for 1 month. Study criteria for Entamoeba
histolytica nucleic acid stability were met at the 1-month time point but not at the 3-
month time point. Overall, the data supports the stability of un-extracted and
extracted Entamoeba histolytica specimens frozen at -70°C to -80°C for 1 month.
Supplemental Stability Results - Entamoeba histolytica (un-extracted)
Additional data to support the stability of un-extracted Entamoeba histolytica
specimens was also generated by analyzing LP and MP results obtained at site 1
(LMD) during the multi-site reproducibility study as well as testing LP and MP
remnants at a later date. These results also suggest that un-extracted Entamoeba
histolytica specimens are stable for at least 1-month when stored frozen at -70°C to -
80°C.
Results are summarized for the un-extracted, pre-treated and extracted sample

multi-site clinical evaluation of the xTAG GPP.
Comparator Assays Analytical Validation Studies
PCR followed by bi-directional sequencing assays (PCR/sequencing) are used as a
comparator method and to resolve discordant results to establish analyte identity
during the clinical evaluation of xTAG assays. They are validated to evaluate certain
performance characteristics including analytical sensitivity (limit of detection),
analytical reactivity and specificity (cross-reactivity).
The primers were chosen to perform sequencing as a comparator method for
Adenovirus 40/41 and Entamoeba histolytica targets of the xTAG Gastrointestinal
Pathogen Panel (xTAG GPP). The comparator assays analytical validation of the

primers for Campylobacter, Enterotoxigenic Escherichia Coli (ETEC) LT and ST,
and Rotavirus A targets is described in k121454.
To the extent possible, the sequencing primers were designed to amplify regions of
the genomic sequence that are not covered by the xTAG GPP kit primers. The second
set of sequencing primers designed for ETEC LT and ETEC ST targets were designed
to flank the GPP kit amplicon. Bi-directional (both forward and reverse sequences of
the produced amplicon) Sanger dideoxy - sequencing method and BLAST analysis
were used to confirm sequence identity.
Sequencing primers were validated using samples from the following sources:
1. Representative Clinical Sample: Wherever possible, known positive
clinical samples were tested with the sequencing primers to evaluate
detection from an extracted clinical stool sample.
2. Limit of Detection (LoD): Serial dilutions of the target analytes were
tested to establish the lower limit of primer sensitivity. Samples tested for
“Evaluation of the Limit of Detection and Repeatability of xTAG
Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (FDA),” study were used here.
3. Cross-reactivity: For the xTAG GPP panel targets, samples representing
all the targtes in the xTAG GPP panel, were tested at the highest available
titres. For the xTAG GPP non-panel cross-reactivity targets, BLAST
analysis was performed with each sequencing primer. If both the forward
and reverse sets contained an 11 base pair match up to the 3' end (Kwok S,
1994) of the primer with any of the non-panel cross-reactivity species,
then a representative sample for that strain was tested to evaluate cross-
reactivity.
4. Reactivity: Various strains for each target were analyzed to evaluate the
strain coverage of the sequencing primers. Samples tested for “Evaluation
of Analytical Reactivity of the xTAG Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel
(FDA)” study were used here.
Detailed descriptions of the types of samples tested are listed below:
· Clinical Sample: Pre-characterized target-specific clinical samples for
Adenovirus were tested with the sequencing primers. For Entamoeba
histolytica clinical samples could not be identified; therefore, the evaluation of
the primers with a clinical sample was not possible.
· Limit of Detection Study: The same sample sets prepared for the Evaluation
of the Limit of Detection and Repeatability of xTAG GPP study, were used
for this Sequencing Primer Validation study. Briefly, stock solutions were
diluted to a starting concentration and dilution series were prepared by making
sequential 4-fold dilutions to about 10 dilution levels. Sample dilutions were
prepared and tested in triplicates.
34

--- Page 35 ---
· Cross-reactivity: To test for cross-reactivity of the sequencing primers the
following studies were conducted.
o For the xTAGGPP panel targets, samples representing all the targets in
the xTAG GPP panel, were tested at the highest available titers, except
for Vibrio, where the sample was not available.
o For the xTAGGPP non-panel cross-reactivity targets, BLAST analysis
was performed with each sequencing primer. If both the forward and
reverse sets contained an 11 base pair match up to the 3’ end (Kwok S,
1994) of the primer with any of the non-panel cross-reactivity species,
then a representative sample for that strain was tested to evaluate cross-
reactivity.
· Reactivity: A variety of strains for Entamoeba histolytica used in the
Analytical Reactivity study were tested with each sequencing primer set. For
Adenovirus, no additional strains to those used in the LoD study could be
sourced.
Categorizing Sequencing Results
Positive – Samples were considered positive by sequencing if the following criteria
were met:
o The generated sequences, from bidirectional sequencing, should be at least
200 bases of an acceptable quality, defined as a minimum of 90% of the
total bases (20 bases per 200bp read) with PHRED quality score of 20 or
higher (accuracy of base call is ≥ 99%)
o For sequences containing ambiguous base calls such as “N”s, the total
number of ambiguous bases in the acceptable quality sequences generated
using bidirectional sequencing should not exceed 5% of total bases (or 10
bases per 200 bp read).
o Blast analysis of the acceptable quality sequences generated by
bidirectional sequencing should have at least 95% query coverage
compared to reference and at least 95% identity to reference.
o Sequence matches the reference or sequence generates an Expected Value
-30
(E-Value) < 10 for the specific target following a BLAST search in
GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/).
Negative – Samples were considered negative by sequencing if any one of the above
criteria were not met.
Acceptance Criteria
· Clinical Sample: The clinical sample of known identity, if available, must be
positive by sequencing for the expected target.
· Limit of Detection Study: At least, 2 of the 3 extraction replicates must be
positive by sequencing at the equivalent or lower titer than the established
limit of detection recorded for the xTAGGPP analyte.
35

--- Page 36 ---
· Cross-reactivity Study: All samples tested should generate no sequencing
reactions of acceptable quality.
· Reactivity: Strains, genotypes and serotypes should generate positives results
with their respective sequencing primers.
Conclusion
All sequencing primers met the acceptance criteria for all studies.

Microbial Detection in Asymptomatic Volunteers
In order to determine baseline levels for each analyte included in xTAG GPP for
individuals who are not exhibiting signs and symptoms of infectious
gastroenteritis, 200 clinical stool samples were collected from healthy,
asymptomatic donors. Asymptomatic donors from various age groups were
included in this study.
Demographic information for the asymptomatic donors is shown in the table below.

PCR inhibition, as determined by results for the internal control used with xTAG
GPP (bacteriophage MS2), was observed in 23 of the 200 samples tested (11.5%).
After re-running these specimens in accordance with the instructions for use, PCR
inhibition was still observed in eight samples (4%). The absence of a detectable
internal control signal in these samples meant that negative results for the
indicated microbial targets could not be reported. Therefore, the final data
analysis was conducted on 192 of the 200 samples collected for this study.
A total of 14 samples that were positive by xTAG GPP were sequenced. Two (2)
out of 14 samples were positive by sequencing (C. Difficile Toxin A/B), while 12
of 14 samples were not positive by sequencing.

NOTE: Sample 216 was positive by xTAGGPP for both Norovirus GII and C. Difficile
1 Two (2) out of 3 xTAG GPP C. Difficile positive samples were confirmed as positive by sequencing analysis.
2 The one (1) xTAG GPP E. histolytica positive sample was not confirmed as positive by sequencing analysis.
3 None of the 2 xTAG GPP Giardia positive samples was confirmed as positive by sequencing analysis.
4 None of the 3 xTAG GPP Noroviris GI/GII positive samples was confirmed as positive by sequencing analysis.
5 None of the 5 xTAG GPP Salmonella positive samples was confirmed as positive by sequencing analysis.
Samples (at the specimen level) that were positive by xTAG GPP but negative by
sequencing were considered false positives (12/192, 6.3%). These samples had MFI
values that were relatively close to the cut-offs. Two samples at the specimen level that
were called positive by xTAG GPP were also positive by sequencing analysis for C.
difficile. These two samples positive for C. difficile by both xTAG GPP and sequencing
may represent asymptomatic infections.
Prospective Clinical Study
The clinical performance of the xTAG GPP was evaluated during prospective studies at
six clinical laboratories in North America (four sites in the U.S. and two sites in
Canada). Stool specimens were collected and tested at the six clinical laboratories (Sites
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) during June 2011 thru February 2012. Clinical study sites were
selected based on the types of patients usually referred (e.g. pediatrics, adults),
conditions often treated (e.g. C. difficile colitis), as well as the geographical prevalence
of particular targeted pathogens.
Six geographically separated clinical study sites participated in the clinical evaluation of
the xTAG GPP. The study sites were located in East-Central Canada (Toronto, Ontario
and Hamilton, Ontario), and Southeast (Nashville, TN), Southwest (Temple, TX and
Tucson, AZ), and Midwest (St Louis, MN) of the U.S. Each study location was

information on clinical signs and symptoms of infectious colitis or gastroenteritis was
available on all subjects enrolled in the prospective study. This information was
collected by way of chart reviews. Chart reviews were conducted by an individual at the
sites who was not directly involved in the study (e.g. research nurse) so that information
was collected in a manner that did not make the specimen source identifiable to the
investigator or any other individual involved in the investigation including the Sponsor.
Local IRB approval for the study was obtained prior to study start. If available, the
following information was also collected:
· Stool consistency (based on Bristol Stool Scale)
· Clinical signs and symptoms of infectious colitis or gastroenteritis such as diarrhea,
nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, fever, abdominal pain and tenderness, cramping,
bloating, flatulence, bloody stools, fainting and weakness
· Duration and severity of symptoms prior to enrolment
· Method of transmission (e.g. food-borne outbreak or close contact method)
· Prior and concomitant medications including dose, type, frequency and duration.
· Other orally ingested substances (e.g. fiber, stool bulking agents), including dose, type,
frequency and duration
· Other laboratory results (e.g. viral/bacterial culture, gram positive/negative infection,
hematology and serum chemistry etc.)
Wherever available in the medical charts, the duration and severity of each specific sign
or symptom was also recorded.
Stool consistency (based on the Bristol Stool Form Scale) was recorded for each clinical
specimen included in the prospective clinical study. A summary of this information is
provided in the table below.
Stool consistency (N=1407)

All prospective clinical specimens were submitted fresh to the sites and were processed
according to their routine algorithm and as ordered by the referring physician. Upon
receipt at the laboratory, any left-over stool specimen that met the study inclusion /
exclusion criteria was placed into the following six containers.
1. Meridian sterile, leak-proof, wide-mouthed empty container (unpreserved stools)
2. Meridian container containing Cary-Blair holding medium (Para-Pak® C&S)
3. Meridian container containing PVA fixative (Para-Pak® LV-PVA Fixative)
4. Meridian container containing formalin (Para-Pak® 10% Buffered Neutral Formalin)
5. Container containing ACTD medium (swab)
6. Sterile container for xTAG GPP testing (unpreserved stools)
The time from collection to processing into the appropriate containers was kept to a
minimum (<24 hours). Prior to study initiation, processing instructions as well as
shipping details were provided to each clinical site by the central laboratories carrying
out reference and comparator method testing. Specimens were shipped to the central
laboratories within 24 hours of processing. Prospective clinical specimens were then
processed for both comparator testing and xTAG GPP testing as described below.
For all prospective specimens, reference and comparator method testing was performed
at central laboratories independent of xTAG GPP testing sites. Reference/comparator
testing was performed for all analytes on all prospectively collected specimens. In the
event that comparator results were not available for all targets on a given specimen, then
the specimen in question was excluded from performance calculations of xTAG GPP.
Reference and comparator methods for each analyte target are listed in the table below.

Performance of the xTAG GPP detecting ETEC-LT and ETEC-ST was compared to a
composite comparator method consisted of four separate analytically validated PCR
followed by bi-directional sequencing assays (two for ETEC-LT and two for ETEC-ST).
“True” ETEC positives were considered as any sample that was tested positive for LT or
ST by any of the four PCR/sequencing assays. “True” ETEC negatives were considered
as any sample that was tested negative for LT and ST by all four PCR/sequencing
assays. PCR/sequencing assays were performed on nucleic acid extracted directly from
clinical specimens using primers that targeted different genomic regions from the ones
probed by xTAG GPP. Generated sequence results were analyzed as follows:
· For a given base from the consensus sequence generated from bi-directional
sequencing, the PHRED score was calculated by averaging the PHRED quality score
from the forward and reverse sequencing.
· The generated sequence should be at least 200 bases of an acceptable quality, defined
as a minimum of 90% of the total bases with PHRED quality score of 20 or higher.
· Blast analysis of the consensus sequence generated by bi-directional sequencing
should have at least 95% query coverage compare to reference, at least 95% identity to
reference and an Expected Value (E-Value) 1of at least 10-30.
· For sequences containing “N”s, the consensus generated using bi-directional
sequencing should correspond to the strand including the high quality base instead of
the strand including the “N” called base. In addition, the total number of N's should
not exceed 5% of total bases (or 10 bases per 200 bp read).
Performance of the xTAG GPP detecting rotavirus or adenovirus 40/41 was compared to
a composite comparator method consisted of an FDA cleared EIA test and one
analytically validated PCR followed by bi-directional sequencing assay. “True” rotavirus
or adenovirus 40/41 positives were considered as any sample that was tested positive for
1 The E-Value from NCBI BLAST Alignment indicates the statistical significance of a given pair-wise alignment and
reflects the size of the database and the scoring system used. The lower the E-Value, the more significant the hit. A
sequence alignment that has an E-Value of 1e-3 means that this similarity has a 1 in 1000 chance of occurring by chance
alone. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=handbook.section.614).

rotavirus or adenovirus 40/41 by the EIA and/or the PCR/sequencing assay. “True”
rotavirus or adenovirus 40/41 negatives were considered as any sample that was tested
negative for rotavirus or adenovirus 40/41 by both the EIA and the PCR/sequencing
assay. PCR/sequencing was performed on nucleic acid extracted directly from clinical
specimens using primers that targeted different genomic regions from the ones probed
by xTAG GPP. Generated sequence results were analyzed described above.
Performance of the xTAG GPP for norovirus was assessed by comparing test results to
the “patient norovirus infected status” of each specimen. The “patient norovirus infected
status” was determined using a composite comparator method consisting of the CDC
norovirus real-time Taqman RT-PCR assay and the CDC Conventional RT-PCR
(Region-C and D primers) followed by bi-directional sequencing assays. The following
interpretation algorithm was used to determine the “patient norovirus infected status”:

Clinical runs and re-runs (per the instructions provided in the product package insert)
using xTAG GPP were carried out on left-over clinical specimens that had been
extracted from the fresh or frozen state using the NucliSENS EasyMAG method
(BioMérieux, Inc., Durham, NC) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total
extracted nucleic acid material was stored at -700C prior to testing with xTAG GPP.
PCR negative (water blanks, NTC) control and external rotating positive controls (RC)
representing analytes probed by the assay were also included with each xTAG GPP run.
The external positive controls used in the study are listed in the table below and, for the
most part (except for Cryptosporidium), consisted of chemically-inactivated bacteria,
viruses and parasites from ZeptoMetrix. These controls were used to control the entire
assay process including nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and detection. The
external positive controls contained low organism copy numbers and were designed to
mimic patient specimens. These were run as separate samples, concurrently with patient
specimens. External positive controls were included in each assay plate in a rotating
manner.

* Stock material was used as MFI signals generated for campylobacter in the initial clinical runs
using1/10 dilution of the stock were too close to the assay cut-off.
** Pooled clinical specimens positive for Crytopsoridium hominis were used as positive control for this
target. MFI values generated were however close to the assay cut-off and, in a number of clinical runs
were below the threshold for a positive call.
Clinical specimens were tested in accordance with the package insert for xTAG GPP
assay and were tested by a single operator at each of the clinical sites.
The xTAG GPP assay includes an internal control (MS2 bacteriophage) that is added to
each sample prior to extraction. In the event that none of the pathogen targets probed by
xTAG GPP were detected in a clinical specimen and the MS2 call in that specimen was
“Absent”, a 1/10 dilution of the nucleic acid remnant (from the original extraction) was
prepared and tested by xTAG GPP. Two outcomes of running a 1/10 dilution were
addressed in the following manner:
· If the MS2 call was “Present” following a 1/10 dilution of the original extract, it
is likely that the original result was due to PCR inhibition. All additional
positive results generated in this scenario were reported as “Positive” in the
calculation of sensitivity and specificity (or positive and negative agreement).
Negative results generated in this scenario were reported as “inhibited” and
excluded from the calculation of sensitivity and specificity (or positive and
negative agreement) for the targets in question. However, inhibited results are
presented in the performance tables as “invalid” for each microbial target.
· If the MS2 signal was “Absent” following a 1/10 dilution of the original extract
and none of the pathogen targets were detected, then the sample was re-tested
with xTAG GPP, starting from the extraction step. If MS2 signal was “Present”
after re-testing from the extraction step, it is likely that the original result was
due to sub-optimal extraction. Negative and positive results generated in this
allowable re-run were included in the calculation of sensitivity and specificity (or
positive / negative agreement) for each individual target. If MS2 signal was still
“Absent” after re-testing from the extraction step and none of the pathogen
targets were detected, then the sample was coded as “inhibited” and was

excluded from the calculation of sensitivity and specificity (or positive and
negative agreement) for the targets in question. However, inhibited results are
presented in the performance tables as “invalid” for each microbial target.
In the event that an unexpected positive call was made in any of the assay controls
included in the xTAG GPP run (negative or external positive control), then all clinical
specimens that tested positive for the analyte(s) in question were re-tested by xTAG
GPP. Negative and positive results generated in this allowable re-run were included in
the calculation of sensitivity and specificity (or positive and negative percent
agreements) for each individual target.
Discrepant results between the xTAG GPP and the reference methods were also
evaluated using analytically validated PCR/sequencing assays or FDA cleared molecular
assays (i.e., for C. difficile Toxin), and results are footnoted in the performance tables
below.

7The one specimen that was positive for Adenovirus 40/41 by reference but negative by xTAG GPP was positive by
bi-directional sequencing only (i.e., FDA-cleared EIA negative).
8 A total of 48 C. difficile Toxin A/B xTAG GPP positive specimens that were negative by the comparator method
were confirmed as positive by bi-directional sequencing analysis using analytically validated primers that targeted
genomic regions distinct from the xTAG GPP, or FDA cleared C. difficile Toxin molecular assay.
Prospective Clinical Study Mixed Infection Analysis
xTAG GPP detected a total of 98 mixed infections in the prospective clinical
evaluation. This represents 20.2% of the total number of xTAG GPP positive
specimens (98/486). Sixty two (62) (62/98; 63.3%) were double infections, 23 (23/98;
23.5%) were triple infections, eight (8/98; 8.2%) were quadruple infections, two (2/98;
2.0%) were quintuple infections, one (1/98; 1.0%) was sextuple infection, one was
septuple infection (1/98; 1.0%), and one was octuplet infection (1/98; 1.0%). The
single most common co-infections (20/98; 20.4%) was Norovirus GI/GII with C.
difficile Toxin A/B. Out of the 98 co-infections, 93 contained one or more analytes
that had not been detected with the reference/comparator methods, i.e. discrepant co-
infections. Distinct co-infection combinations detected by xTAG GPP in the
prospective clinical study are summarized in the table below.

Unexpected positive call(s) in negative (NTC) or external rotating positive control(s) (RC)
were reported in 10 out of 49 xTAG GPP runs (10/49, 20.4%) during the prospective
clinical study. A total of 49 clinical specimens included in these contaminated runs tested
positive for analytes that were unexpectedly present in assay controls (49/1407; 3.5%).
Retrospective Clinical Study 1 - Pre-Selected Clinical Specimens
Due to low prevalence observed for most of the xTAG GPP analytes in the prospective
clinical study (see above), xTAG GPP performance detecting the following microbial
targets was further evaluated in a retrospective clinical study testing pre-selected clinical
specimens.
Adenovirus 40/41

These pre-selected positive specimens were tested with xTAG GPP at three clinical sites
along with 273 “negative” clinical specimens in a randomized, blinded fashion. The
“negative” designation for these 273 specimens was based on the routine algorithms used at
the clinical site (e.g. bacterial culture, EIA, microscopy, in-house real time PCR). These
algorithms did not test for all pathogen targets probed by xTAG GPP.

assessed by bi-directional sequencing for E. coli 0157 and the results added to those obtained for E. coli 0157.
Nucleic acid amplification followed by bi-directional sequencing using analytically
validated primers was also performed on all available pre-selected clinical specimens that
were positive by xTAG GPP for other analytes. More specifically, confirmatory testing was
performed for those analytes that were positive by xTAG GPP but not pre-selected at the
banking site in order to determine whether these additional positive calls represented True
Positive (TP) or False Positive (FP) clinical results. To the extent possible, sequencing
primers targeted genomic regions distinct from those of the kit primers. xTAG GPP

Unexpected positive call(s) in negative (NTC) or external rotating positive control(s) (RC)
were reported in three out of 15 pre-selected xTAG GPP runs (3/15, 20.0%). A total of 21
clinical specimens included in these runs tested positive by xTAG GPP for analytes that
were unexpectedly present in assay controls (21/480; 4.4%).
Supplemental Clinical Study – Botswana Pediatric Stool Specimens
The clinical performance of xTAG GPP for Adenovirus 40/41, Rotavirus, ETEC,
Cryptosporidium and Gardia was also evaluated in a set of pediatric stool specimens
(N=313) prospectively collected between February 2011 and January 2012 from
symptomatic pediatric patients admitted to two referral hospitals in Botswana, Africa. All
pediatric patients included in this evaluation presented with diarrhea and/or vomiting.
General demographic details for these patients are summarized in the table below.

All specimens were shipped frozen to one of the study sites in Ontario, Canada for xTAG
GPP testing. Stools were extracted by the Biomerieux NucliSENS EasyMag and tested
using the xTAG GPP per the instructions provided in the product package insert.
Comparator testing by nucleic acid amplification followed by bi-directional sequencing
using analytically validated primers was performed on samples positive for Adenovirus
40/41, Rotavirus, ETEC, Cryptosporidium and Giardia by xTAG GPP. In order to
minimize bias, a random subset of the 313 Botswana specimens that tested negative by

xTAG GPP was also assessed by the same nucleic acid amplification followed by bi-
directional sequencing method for Adenovirus 40/41, Rotavirus, ETEC, Cryptosporidium
and Giardia. In the case of Cryptosporidium and Giardia, the number of xTAG GPP
negative specimens assessed was equal to or greater than the number of specimens
identified as positive by xTAG GPP. In the case of ETEC, the number of xTAG GPP
negative specimens assessed was slightly less than the number of specimens identified as
positive by xTAG GPP. Since 178 of 313 specimens tested positive by xTAG GPP for
Rotavirus, the number of negative Rotavirus specimens tested by nucleic acid amplification
followed by sequencing was less than the number of positive Rotavirus specimens tested by
this comparator method. Comparator testing by nucleic acid amplification followed by bi-
directional sequencing using analytically validated primers was performed on a total of 91,
308, 56, 24, and 20 specimens for Adenovirus 40/41, Rotavirus, ETEC, Cryptosporidium,
and Giardia, respectively.
In addition, all available residual clinical specimens (N=311) were assessed for Adenovirus
40/41 using the same FDA-cleared EIA as that used in the prospective study (Premier
Adenoclone Type 40/41 EIA, Meridian Bioscience, K881894).

1 All 18 specimens that were positive for Adenovirus 40/41 by comparator but negative by xTAG GPP were positive by bi-
directional sequencing only (i.e. FDA-cleared EIA negative). All these 18 specimens were assessed by real-time PCR for
Adenovirus (all sub-types) at the laboratory testing site. The mean Ct value for these 18 specimens was 32.9; indicating low viral
titer in these specimens, which is less clinically relevant.

contrast to the 18 specimens in footnote 1 above, the mean Ct value for the 34 adenovirus samples positive by the PCR/Bi-
directional sequencing assay and detected by xTAG GPP in this cohort was 22.81; indicating higher viral titer in these specimens,
which is more clinically relevant.

Nucleic acid amplification followed by bi-directional sequencing using analytically
validated primers was also performed on all available clinical specimens that were positive
by xTAG GPP for other analytes (i.e., Campylobacter, C. difficile Toxin A/B, E. coli O157,
Norovirus, Salmonella, Shigella, and STEC) in order to determine whether these additional
positive calls represented True Positive (TP) or False Positive (FP) clinical results. The

Supplemental Study – Contrived Stool Specimens
The performances of xTAG GPP for E. histolytica and V. cholera were further assessed
using contrived specimens.
The low prevalence of Entamoeba histolytica made it very difficult to source available
retrospective specimens. Many efforts were made by the sponsor to source Entamoeba
histolytica positive clinical specimens. However, the sponsor could not acquire any usable
Entamoeba histolytica clinical specimens for testing with the GPP assay. For Vibrio
cholerae the major limitation to obtaining retrospective samples was the import/export
restrictions placed around this pathogen. These import/export restrictions are applied at the
molecular level preventing the sponsor from obtaining inactivated material or even purified
nucleic acids from Vibrio cholerae. The prevalence of Vibrio cholerae is very low in
Canada and the United States and the sponsor was unable to find a Canadian or US source
for retrospective samples.
A panel of contrived specimens was made for each of these two rare analytes, as well as a
panel of un-spiked contrived negative specimens. The contrived specimens consisted of
unique source (individual donor) stool matrix that was used as-is for the negative specimen
panel or was spiked with reference strain culture material for Entamoeba histolytica and
Vibrio cholerae. A total of 50 unique specimens were made and tested for each panel.
This study was performed at three North American sites:
· Site A – Saint Joseph’s Hospital (SJH), Hamilton, Ontario
· Site B – Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH), Toronto, Ontario
· Site C – Luminex Molecular Diagnostics (LMD), Toronto, Ontario.
The stool specimens used to create individual negative clinical matrix were obtained from
anonymized donors. Prior to being used as matrix, the stools were screened with xTAG
GPP to ensure they were negative for all xTAG GPP analytes and that they had a present
call for the spiked-in internal control (MS2). Stool specimens which did not meet these
criteria were not used for this study. A total of 50 unique lots of stool matrix were created
from 50 raw stool samples, with each lot of stool matrix obtained from a unique donor. The
50 lots of stool matrix were then utilized to make 50 Entamoeba histolytica contrived
samples, 50 Vibrio cholerae contrived samples and 50 negative samples.
The Entamoeba histolytica contrive samples were created by spiking stool matrix with high
titer culture material from four different strains of Entamoeba histolytica obtained from
ATCC.

The 50 sample contrived specimen panels for each of Entamoeba histolytica, Vibrio
cholerae and the negative stool specimens were de-identified so that the sample identity
and pathogen concentration was not determinable by the site investigator, operator or any
other individual associated with the study. After de-identification the samples were
randomized and distributed between the three study sites. Each contrived specimen was
processed and analyzed following the assay kit instructions.
All 50 contrived negative stool specimens produced the expected negative result for all
analytes. The agreement with expected negative results is 100% (50/50) with a 95%
confidence interval from 92.9% to 100%.

Stool Specimens in Cary-Blair Media
Prospective Clinical Study
Performance of xTAG GPP testing stool specimens in Cary-Blair media was evaluated on
all available prospectively collected, leftover stool specimens stored in Cary-Blair medium
from the prospective study testing raw unpreserved stool specimens as described in the
“Prospective Clinical Study” section of this decision summary.
The prospective specimens in the Cary-Blair medium were de-identified by an individual
who was not involved in the study, so that the identity of the subject was not readily
ascertained by the site operator. These Cary-Blair stool remnants were distributed to at
least three clinical sites and tested with xTAG GPP starting from pre-treatment and
extractions steps. All specimens were distributed to the sites in a frozen state. No sample
preparation was done for prospectively collected specimens in Cary-Blair medium.
Sensitivity/positive percentage agreement of xTAG GPP on stool in Cary-Blair medium is
summarized for each individual target in the table below. For comparison purposes,
performance results generated from the unpreserved stool as part of the prospective study
as described in the “Prospective Clinical Study” section of this decision summary are also
presented alongside of the performance results generated from the Cary-Blair preserved
stool specimens.

1In the case of Adenovirus 40/41, one of the clinical specimens that was concordant positive in the original GPP runs performed
on raw stool yielded a negative result when tested in Cary-Blair (sample #02129). MFI generated on in the original stool run were
close to the assay cut off (195) suggesting a low titer specimen. Another specimen that was inhibited in the original stool runs
performed on raw stool yielded a negative result in the Cary-Blair runs (sample #01366). Lastly, one specimen that was positive
for Adenovirus 40/41 by composite comparator was unavailable for re-testing in the Cary-Blair study (sample #02192). For these
reasons, positive agreement of xTAG GPP for Adenovirus 40/41 dropped from 80% (4/5) in the raw stool study to 40% (2/5) in
the Cary-Blair evaluation. Refer to the results of further evaluation testing contrived samples close to the limit of detection (LoD)
for Adenovirus 40/41 described in detail in the “Supplemental Study – Contrived Stool Specimens” section.
2ETEC comparator results were calculated against a composite consisting of four well characterized nucleic acid amplification
tests (NAATs) followed by bi-directional sequencing. All specimens that were false negative by xTAG GPP for ETEC were
positive by only one out of four comparator NAATs. Repeat sequencing of these specimens were negative by all four NAAT,
except for one sample which was positive by one NAAT.
Overall, sensitivity/positive agreements generated in the stool in Cary-Blair study were
comparable to those generated in the original clinical study performed on raw stool
specimens.
Specificity/negative percentage agreement of xTAG GPP on stool in Cary-Blair medium is
summarized for each individual target in the table below. For comparison purposes,
performance results generated from the unpreserved stool as part of the prospective study
as described in the “Prospective Clinical Study” section of this decision summary are also
presented alongside of the performance results generated from the Cary-Blair preserved
stool specimens.

Overall, lower false positive results were observed in the stool in Cary-Blair study
compared to the original clinical study performed on raw stool specimens. It is believed
that this is mainly due to the fact that Cary-Blair clinical runs were conducted in
accordance with the risk mitigations procedures aimed at preventing contamination
requested by FDA during the initial review of xTAG GPP (k121454).
Results generated in this prospective clinical study demonstrate that the performance of
xTAG GPP tested on stool stored in Cary-Blair media was equivalent to that of tested on
unpreserved stools.
Retrospective Clinical Study - Pre-Selected Clinical Specimens in Cary-Blair
In this study, all pre-selected Cary-Blair specimens were prepared from frozen stool mixed
proportionally with Cary-Blair medium (at a ratio of 1:3, stool vs. Cary-Blair). These
frozen specimens were remnants from the retrospective xTAG GPP clinical study as
described in the “Retrospective Clinical Study 1 – Pre-Selected Clinical Specimens”
section of this decision summary. A total of 81 specimens were included, including 40
Campylobacter, two E.coli O157, 26 Salmonella, and 13 Shigella positive specimens. All
were characterized by bacterial culture. Although a smaller sample set was used for this
study comparing to the original retrospective xTAG GPP clinical study (described above),
positive agreement between comparator and xTAG GPP results was 100% for all pre-
selected targets tested in this study.

Supplemental Study – Contrived Stool Specimens in Cary-Blair
Adenovirus 40/41
In order to assess whether Cary-Blair prospective clinical study results are an accurate
representation of the performance of the assay for the Adenovirus 40/41 target, contrived
specimens made from individual negative Stool specimens in Cary-Bair, were prepared at
concentration spanning the analytical detection range of the assay and tested in a
randomized fashion with negative specimens. Both Adenovirus 40 and 41 cultured isolates
were tested and 50% of the samples were prepared at a concentration of 2XLoD. Results of
this evaluation are presented in the table below.

anonymized donors. Prior to being used for matrix, the stools were screened with xTAG
GPP to ensure they were negative for all xTAG GPP analytes, and that they had a present
call for the spiked-in internal control (MS2). Stool specimens which did not meet these
criteria were not used for this study.
A total of 50 unique specimens of stool in Cary-Blair were obtained from individual unique
donors. The 50 stool in Cary-Blair specimens were then utilized to make 50 Entamoeba
histolytica contrived samples, 50 Vibrio cholerae contrived samples and 50 negative
samples.
The Entamoeba histolytica contrive samples were created by spiking the stool in Cary-
Blair with high titer culture material from three different strains of Entamoeba histolytica
obtained from ATCC. The stock culture information and the concentrations used for the

The 50 sample contrived specimen panels for each of Entamoeba histolytica, Vibrio
cholerae and the negative stool specimens were de-identified so that the sample identity
and pathogen concentration was not determinable by the investigator, operator or any other
individual associated with the study. After de-identification the samples were randomized
and distributed to one study site. Each contrived specimen was processed and analyzed
following the assay kit instructions.
The 50 negative stool in Cary-Blair contrived specimens produced the expected negative
result for Entamoeba histolytica and Vibrio cholerae in 50/50 samples. The agreement with
expected negative results is 100% (50/50) with a 95% confidence interval from 92.9% to
100%. On a per analyte bases the expected negative call for all analytes was obtained in
947/950 analytes. The three positive results obtained for the negative samples were for the
targets Norovirus GII, Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC LT toxin) and Shiga-like toxin
producing E. coli (stx2 toxin). Although the source Cary-Blair stool samples used to create
this contrived sample set originally screened negative for xTAG GPP analytes, it appears
that these three source samples contain low level analytes for these targets. This assessment
is based on the observation that the three individual lots of stool in question reproducibly
generated the unexpected positive call (i.e., Norovirus GII, ETEC LT toxin, and stx2 toxin
in the Entamoeba histolytica and Vibrio cholera positive sample sets.

2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X___ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Users must fill in Batch Information by providing a unique batch Name, Description and
Creator. Users have to enter appropriate patient information, i.e. number of samples, and
sample IDs.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
DNA is extracted using the Biomerieux NucliSens EasyMag system. Samples are
manually prepared for amplification according to assay package insert and, once
amplified, are transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate for analysis on the Luminex
system.
5. Calibration:
xMAP Calibrator Microspheres, Classification (CAL1) and Reporter (CAL2) serve as
system calibrators for Luminex xMAP technology based detectors and are intended to
normalize the settings for both the classification channel (CL1, CL2), the doublet
discriminator channel (DD), and the reporter channel (RP1). They are not intended to be
used as calibrators for a given assay.
6. Quality Control:
xMAP Control Microspheres, Classification (CON1) and Reporter (CON2) are intended
to verify the calibration and optical integrity for the Luminex 100/200 System.
Classification Control Microspheres verify both classification channels and the doublet
discriminator channel (DD). Reporter Control Microspheres verify the reporter channel.
They are not intended to be used as controls for a given assay which are described in the
specific assay package insert.
P. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
Q. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
