The FilmArray GI Panel is indicated as an aid in the diagnosis of specific agents of
gastrointestinal illness and results are meant to be used in conjunction with other clinical,
laboratory, and epidemiological data. Positive results do not rule out co-infection with
organisms not included in the FilmArray GI Panel. The agent detected may not be the
definite cause of the disease.
Concomitant culture is necessary for organism recovery and further typing of bacterial
agents.
This device is not intended to monitor or guide treatment for C. difficile infection.
Due to the small number of positive specimens collected for certain organisms during the
prospective clinical study, performance characteristics for E. coli O157, Plesiomonas
shigelloides, Yersinia enterocolitica, Astrovirus, and Rotavirus A were established
primarily with retrospective clinical specimens.
Performance characteristics for Entamoeba histolytica, and Vibrio (V. parahaemolyticus, V.
vulnificus, and Vibrio cholerae) were established primarily using contrived clinical
specimens.
Negative FilmArray GI Panel results in the setting of clinical illness compatible with
gastroenteritis may be due to infection by pathogens that are not detected by this test or
non-infectious causes such as ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or Crohn’s
disease.
A gastrointestinal microorganism multiplex nucleic acid-based assay also aids in the
detection and identification of acute gastroenteritis in the context of outbreaks.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:

A test is initiated by loading Hydration Solution into one port of the FilmArray pouch and a
stool sample (in Cary Blair transport medium) mixed with the provided Sample Buffer into
the other port of the FilmArray GI pouch and placing it in the FilmArray Instrument. The
pouch contains all of the reagents required for specimen testing and analysis in a freeze-
dried format; the addition of Hydration Solution and Sample/Buffer Mix rehydrates the
reagents. After the pouch is prepared, the FilmArray Software guides the user though the
steps of placing the pouch into the instrument, scanning the pouch barcode, entering the
sample identification, and initiating the run.
The FilmArray Instrument contains a coordinated system of inflatable bladders and seal
points, which act on the pouch to control the movement of liquid between the pouch
blisters. When a bladder is inflated over a reagent blister, it forces liquid from the blister
into connecting channels. Alternatively, when a seal is placed over a connecting channel it
acts as a valve to open or close a channel. In addition, electronically controlled pneumatic
pistons are positioned over multiple plungers in order to deliver the rehydrated reagents
into the blisters at the appropriate times. Two Peltier devices control heating and cooling of
the pouch to drive the PCR reactions and the melt curve analysis.
Nucleic acid extraction occurs within the FilmArray pouch using mechanical and chemical
lysis followed by purification using standard magnetic bead technology. After extracting
and purifying nucleic acids from the unprocessed sample, the FilmArray performs a nested
multiplex PCR that is executed in two stages. During the first stage, the FilmArray
performs a single, large volume, highly multiplexed reverse transcription PCR (rt-PCR)
reaction. The products from first stage PCR are then diluted and combined with a fresh,
primer-free master mix and a fluorescent double stranded DNA binding dye (LC Green®
Plus, BioFire). The solution is then distributed to each well of the array. Array wells
contain sets of primers designed specifically to amplify sequences internal to the PCR

products generated during the first stage PCR reaction. The 2nd stage PCR, or nested PCR,
is performed in singleplex fashion in each well of the array. At the conclusion of the 2nd
stage PCR, the array is interrogated by melt curve analysis for the detection of signature
amplicons denoting the presence of specific targets. A digital camera placed in front of the
2nd stage PCR captures fluorescent images of the PCR reactions and software interprets the
data.
The FilmArray Software automatically interprets the results of each DNA melt curve
analysis and combines the data with the results of the internal pouch controls to provide a
test result for each organism on the panel.
Materials provided in each kit:
· Individually packaged FilmArray GI Panel pouches
· Single-use (1.0 mL) Sample Buffer ampoules
· Single-use pre-filled (1.5 mL) Hydration Injection Vials (blue)
· Single-use Sample Injection Vials (red)
· Individually packaged Transfer Pipettes
Materials required but not provided: FilmArray System including:
· FilmArray Instrument
· FilmArray Pouch Loading Station compatible with the use of the FilmArray
Injection Vials
Note: Previous versions of Pouch Loading Station should not be used with the FilmArray
Injection Vials.
For many organisms detected by the FilmArray GI Panel, the organism is considered to be
detected if a single corresponding assay is positive. For example, Plesiomonas shigelloides
will have a result of “Plesiomonas shigelloides Detected” if at least two of the three
replicates of the one Plesiomonas shigelloides assay have similar positive melt peaks with
Tm values that are within the assay-specific Tm range. The following organisms are
detected using a single assay: toxigenic C. difficile, P. shigelloides, Salmonella, Y.
enterocolitica, EAEC, Shigella/EIEC, Adenovirus F 40/41, Astrovirus, Sapovirus
(Genogroups I, II, IV, and V), C. cayetanensis, E. histolytica and G. lamblia.
In contrast, the test results for several organisms rely on the combination of multiple
assays. These include Campylobacter (C. jejuni/C. coli/C. upsaliensis), Vibrio (V.
parahaemolyticus/ V. vulnificus/V. cholerae) and Vibrio cholerae, Cryptosporidium,
Norovirus GI/GII, and Rotavirus A. The test results for several Diarrheagenic E. coli(s)
include multiple assays for genetic markers to identify various classic pathotypes of E. coli
including EPEC, ETEC, and STEC (including O157), (as well EAEC and Shigella/EIEC
included above). Interpretation rules for these assays are described below. Also included
are summary descriptions of the assays’ expected reactivity; for a full description of assay
reactivity see Inclusivity.

NOTE: As polymicrobial results with four or more distinct organisms in a single sample
are unusual based upon data from the prospective clinical study, confirmation of this result
is recommended to rule out any unexpected error, either caused by the user’s handling of
the sample or the test system. Polymicrobial results of four or more organisms were
detected in less than 1% (12/1556) of the FilmArray GI prospective study specimens.
Bacteria
Campylobacter (C. jejuni/C. coli/C. upsaliensis): The FilmArray GI Panel contains two
assays (Campy 1 and Campy 2) designed to together detect, but not differentiate, the most
common Campylobacter species associated with human gastrointestinal illness: C. jejuni,
C. coli, and C. upsaliensis. These are the same three species that are identified using
standard clinical laboratory practices. Other Campylobacter species will not be identified
by the FilmArray GI Panel. Empirical testing and in silico sequence analysis indicates
reduced sensitivity for a less common subspecies of C. jejuni (C. jejuni subsp. doylei). A
positive result for one or both assays will give a Campylobacter Detected test result.
Clostridium difficile toxin A/B: The FilmArray GI Panel contains a single multiplexed
assay (Cdiff) for the identification of toxigenic C. difficile which targets both the toxin A
gene (tcdA) and the toxin B gene (tcdB). Typical toxigenic strains produce both toxins, but
the presence of either is indicative of a pathogenic strain. Empirical testing and in silico
sequence analysis support that the assay will detect all toxinotypes and the epidemic
BI/NAP1/027 hypervirulent strain, although these will not be specifically differentiated by
the assay. Detection of either or both toxin genes by this assay gives a test result for
Clostridium difficile toxin A/B Detected. As rates of asymptomatic carriage of C. difficile
can be high in very young children and hospitalized patients, the detection of toxigenic C.
difficile should be interpreted within the context of guidelines developed by the testing
facility or other experts (e.g., guidelines/policy statements published by The American
Academy of Pediatrics or the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America and the
Infectious Disease Society of America).
Plesiomonas shigelloides: The FilmArray GI Panel contains a single assay (Pshig) for
detection of P. shigelloides, the only known species in the genus Plesiomonas.
Salmonella: The FilmArray GI Panel contains a single assay (Salm) designed to detect
both species of Salmonella; S. enterica and S. bongori. Empirical testing and in silico
sequence analysis supports the ability to detect all subspecies and serovars of Salmonella.
Cross-reactivity may occur with certain E. coli strains containing variants of the cryptic
ETT2 type-III secretion system (see Inclusivity for additional information).
Vibrio (V. parahaemolyticus/V. vulnificus/V. cholerae) and Vibrio cholerae: The
FilmArray GI Panel contains a single assay (Vibrio) for detection of Vibrio species most
commonly implicated in gastroenteritis (V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, and V.
cholerae). Empirical testing and in silico sequence analysis indicate that the assay may also
react with some less common Vibrio species (i.e., V. alginolyticus, V. fluvialis, and V.
mimicus). The Vibrio assay does not indicate which species has been detected and the
Vibrio assay is not expected to detect the rarer V. cincinnatiensis, V. furnissii and V.

metschnikovii. A second assay (Vchol) is also included for the specific detection of Vibrio
cholerae. A Vibrio cholerae Detected result will only be reported when the V. cholerae-
specific assay is positive, while a positive result for either assay will give a Vibrio Detected
test result (see table below).

Vibrio cholerae: Not Detected (not V. cholerae)
Vibrio cholerae detected
OR
Vibrio: Detected
Any Results Positive Vibrio cholerae and one or

Yersinia enterocolitica: The FilmArray GI Panel contains a single assay (Yent) designed to
detect all known serotypes/biotypes of Y. enterocolitica. Empirical testing and in silico
sequence analysis indicate a potential for cross-reactivity with Y. kristensenii and Y.
frederiksenii when present at high levels (>108 CFU/mL). These two species are in the Y.
enterocolitica group and are difficult to differentiate from Y. enterocolitica by culture
methods; both are suspected human pathogens.
Diarrheagenic E. coli
The FilmArray GI Panel contains multiple assays designed to detect genetic determinants
associated with classic diarrheagenic E. coli/Shigella pathotypes. Horizontal transfer of
these genes between organisms has been documented; therefore, Detected results for
multiple diarrheagenic E. coli/Shigella may be due to the presence of multiple pathotypes
or a single strain containing the characteristic determinants of multiple pathotypes. An
example of this is the 2011 E. coli O104:H4 outbreak strain that contains determinants of
both Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) and Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC).
Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC): The FilmArray GI Panel contains a single multiplexed
assay (EAEC) for the identification of two gene targets typically associated with
enteroaggregative E. coli; the aggR regulatory gene and the putative outer membrane
protein, aatA, both located on the partially-conserved pAA plasmid. pAA is not present in
all strains phenotypically identified as EAEC, and not all pAA plasmids carry aggR and
aatA genes; therefore the FilmArray GI Panel will not detect all members of this diverse
pathotype, but is likely to detect most pathogenic strains (including E. coli O104:H4, which
was responsible for recent outbreaks in Europe).
Enterotoxigenic (ETEC) heat-labile (lt) and heat-stable (st) Enterotoxins: The FilmArray
GI Panel contains three assays (ETEC 1, ETEC 2, and ETEC 3) for the detection of
enterotoxins found in Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). The assays are designed for the
detection of heat-labile (LT) enterotoxin (ltA) and two heat-stable (ST) enterotoxin variants

(st1a, also known as STp; and st1b, also known as STh). The reported results do not
indicate which of these toxin(s) have been detected. A positive result for any combination
of the three assays will give an Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) lt/st Detected test result.
The variant LT-II toxin (structurally similar to LT) and the STB/ST2 toxin (structurally
dissimilar to ST1) are not targeted by the ETEC assays and have not been established as
important in human disease. Empirical testing and in silico sequence analysis indicates the
potential for cross-reactivity with certain strains of Hafnia alvei, C. koseri, C. sedlakii, and
Cedecea davisae.
Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC): The FilmArray GI Panel contains a single assay (Ec
eae) for the detection of eae, the gene encoding the adhesin intimin. Both typical and
atypical EPEC will be detected, but not differentiated. The LEE pathogenicity island,
which includes the eae gene, is also found in some Shiga-like toxin producing E. coli
(STEC; O157 and non-O157 strains). Therefore, the results of the eae assay (positive or
negative) are only reported when STEC is not detected. When STEC is detected,
Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) will be reported as N/A (Not Applicable), regardless of
the EPEC assay result (see table below). Consequently, the FilmArray GI Panel cannot
distinguish between STEC containing the eae gene and a co-infection of EPEC and STEC.
Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) Shiga-like toxin genes 1 and 2 (stx1/stx2): The
FilmArray GI Panel contains two assays (STEC 1 and STEC 2) for the detection of Shiga-
like toxin 1 (stx1) and Shiga-like toxin 2 (stx2) sequences. The reported results do not
indicate which of these toxin(s) have been detected. A positive result for either or both of
these assays will give a Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) stx1/stx2 detected test
result (see table below). Shiga toxin (stx; identical to stx1 of STEC) is found in Shigella
dysenteriae; therefore, a FilmArray GI Panel report with positive test results for Shiga-like
toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) stx1/stx2 and Shigella/Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) in the
same sample may indicate the presence of S. dysenteriae.
E. coli O157: To aid in the identification of STEC of the O157 serotype, the FilmArray GI
Panel contains a single assay (Ec O157) to detect a gene target that is specific to this
serotype. Strains of E. coli O157 that do not carry the Shiga-like toxin genes have also been
identified. However, as the pathogenicity of these non-STEC strains remains undefined, the
E. coli O157 assay result is not reported unless a Shiga-like toxin gene is also detected
(STEC detected). Detection of STEC stx1/stx2 and the E. coli O157 target results in a
reporting of E. coli O157 as a qualifier to the positive STEC result. If STEC stx1/stx2 is
Not Detected, the result for E. coli O157 is indicated as N/A (Not Applicable). The
FilmArray GI Panel cannot distinguish between infections with a single toxigenic STEC
O157 or rare co-infections of STEC (non-O157) with a stx1/stx2-negative E. coli O157 (see
table below).

toxin-negative E. coli O157 being in the same specimen with a non-O157 STEC.
Shigella/Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC): The FilmArray GI Panel contains a single assay
(Shig) for the detection of ipaH, a gene specifically found in all Shigella species as well as
Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC). It is not possible to differentiate Shigella from EIEC using
this method, and detection of ipaH will result in a Shigella/Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC)
Detected test result. Shiga toxin (stx; identical to stx1 of STEC) is found in Shigella
dysenteriae, therefore a FilmArray GI Panel report with positive test results for Shiga-like
toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) stx1/stx2 with Shigella/Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) in the
same sample may indicate the presence of S. dysenteriae.

Parasites
Cryptosporidium: The FilmArray GI Panel contains two assays (Crypt 1 and Crypt 2) for
detection of Cryptosporidium species. Empirical testing and in silico sequence analysis
support detection of approximately 23 different Cryptosporidium, including the most
common species of human clinical relevance (i.e., C. hominis and C. parvum), as well as
several less common species (e.g., C. meleagridis, C. felis, C. canis, C. cuniculus, C. muris,
and C. suis). The assays do not differentiate between species and the very rare species C.
bovis, C. ryanae and C. xiaoi may not be detected. A positive result for either or both
assays will give a Cryptosporidium Detected test result.
Cyclospora cayetanensis: The FilmArray GI Panel contains a single assay (Ccayet) for the
detection of C. cayetanensis, the only Cyclospora species implicated in human disease.
Entamoeba histolytica: The FilmArray GI Panel contains a single assay (Ehist) for the
detection of E. histolytica, the only Entamoeba species implicated in gastroenteritis. This
assay may cross-react with the closely related E. dispar when present at higher levels
(approximately 105 oocysts/mL or greater).
Giardia lamblia: The FilmArray GI Panel contains a single assay (Glam) designed to
detect G. lamblia (aka G. intestinalis, G. duodenalis), the only Giardia species infectious to
humans. A very low frequency of cross-reactivity with commensal microorganisms (i.e.,
Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus) was observed in the clinical evaluation.
Viruses
Adenovirus F40/41: The FilmArray GI Panel contains a single multiplexed assay (AdenoF)
for the specific detection of both Adenovirus F40 and F41 (i.e., will not cross-react with
respiratory non-40/41 Adenovirus species when shed in the stool). The reported results do
not indicate which serotype (40 or 41) has been detected. The assay will not detect other
adenovirus species, such as species B, C, and E, which are associated with respiratory
infections.
Astrovirus: The FilmArray GI Panel contains a single assay (Astro) designed to detect eight
subtypes (HAstV1-8) of human Astrovirus. The assay is not predicted to detect newly-
identified astroviruses of the MLB and VA clades.
Norovirus GI/GII: The FilmArray GI Panel contains two assays (Noro 1 and Noro 2) that
together target the Norovirus genogroups most commonly associated with human
infections (GI and GII). Neither assay will detect genogroup GIV, non-human genogroups,
or closely related Caliciviruses such as Sapovirus. The reported results do not indicate
which genogroup(s) (GI and/or GII) have been detected. A positive result for either or both
assays will produce test result of Norovirus GI/GII Detected.
Rotavirus A: The FilmArray GI Panel contains two separate Rotavirus A assays (RotaA 1
and RotaA 2) to be inclusive of all strains of Rotavirus A. In silico sequence analysis
indicates that these assays will not cross-react with Rotavirus B and C, which are less

common in human disease, or Rotavirus D, E, and F, which have not been found in
humans. Empirical testing has demonstrated that these assays will detect recombinant
viruses included in Rotavirus vaccines. A FilmArray GI Panel test result of Rotavirus A
Detected is reported if either or both assays are positive.
Sapovirus (Genogroups I, II, IV, and V): The FilmArray GI Panel contains a single assay
(Sapo) designed to detect, but not differentiate, Sapovirus genogroups identified in human
infections (I, II, IV and V). Genogroup III, a porcine pathogen will not be detected.

L. Test Principle:
The FilmArray GI pouch is a closed system disposable that houses all the chemistry required to
isolate, amplify and detect nucleic acid from multiple gastrointestinal pathogens within a single
stool specimen collected in Cary Blair. The rigid plastic component (fitment) of the FilmArray GI
pouch contains reagents in freeze-dried form. The flexible plastic portion of the pouch is divided
into discrete segments (blisters) where the required chemical processes are carried out. The user of
the FilmArray GI Panel loads the sample into the FilmArray GI pouch, places the pouch into the
FilmArray Instrument, and starts the run. All other operations are automated.
The following is an overview of the operations and processes that occur during a FilmArray run:
· Nucleic Acid Purification - Nucleic acid purification occurs in the first three blisters of the
pouch. The sample is lysed by a combination of chemical and mechanical (bead beating)
p. 13

--- Page 14 ---
mechanisms and the liberated nucleic acid is captured, washed and eluted using magnetic
bead technology. These steps require about ten minutes, and the bead-beater apparatus can
be heard as a high-pitched whine during the first few minutes of operation.
· Reverse Transcription and 1st Stage Multiplex PCR - Since the GI Panel includes RNA
viruses, a reverse transcription (RT) step is performed to convert the viral RNA into cDNA
prior to amplification. The purified nucleic acid solution is combined with a preheated
master mix to initiate the RT step and subsequent thermocycling for multiplex PCR. The
effect of 1st stage PCR is to enrich for the target nucleic acids present in the sample.
· 2nd Stage PCR - The products of 1st stage PCR are diluted and mixed with fresh PCR
reagents containing an intercalating fluorescent DNA dye (LCGreen® Plus, BioFire
Diagnostics). This solution is distributed over the 2nd stage PCR array. The individual
wells of the array contain primers for different assays (each present in triplicate) that target
specific nucleic acid sequences from each of the pathogens detected, as well as control
template material. These primers are ‘nested’ or internal to the specific products of the 1st
stage multiplex reaction, which enhances both the sensitivity and specificity of the
reactions.
· DNA Melting Analysis – After 2nd stage PCR, the temperature is slowly increased and
fluorescence in each well of the array is monitored and analyzed to generate a melt curve.
The temperature at which a specific PCR product melts (melting temperature or Tm) is
consistent and predictable and the FilmArray Software automatically evaluates the data
from replicate wells for each assay to report results
The FilmArray Software controls the operation of the instrument, collects and analyzes data, and
automatically generates a test report at the end of the run.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Reproducibility:
A multicenter reproducibility study was performed to determine between-site and overall
reproducibility of the FilmArray GI Panel. Reproducibility testing occurred at three test
sites using a panel of contrived stool samples, each spiked with various combinations of
four different GI Panel analytes. Each analyte was evaluated at three different
concentrations (Negative, Low Positive and Moderate Positive).
The study incorporated a range of potential variation introduced by 13 different operators,
4 different pouch lots, and 16 different FilmArray Instruments. Samples were stored
refrigerated (4˚C) or frozen (≤-70˚C) prior to testing. Frozen samples were tested on five
different days at three testing sites for 90 data points per sample and refrigerated samples
were tested on four different days at three testing sites for 108 data points per sample. A
summary of results (percent (%) agreement with the expected result) for each analyte (by
site and overall) and the reproducibility of Tm for each positive assay is provided in the
tables below.

a Reproducible, but suboptimal (<95%) detection was observed at one or both concentrations in frozen contrived samples. Data
presented are from contrived samples stored at ~4°C for up to 4 days prior to testing.
b Includes N/A results for 60 samples (180 for all sites) spiked with STEC O157. When an STEC is detected, N/A is reported for the
EPEC test result, regardless of the status of the EPEC assay.
The reproducibility of Tm for each positive assay was also evaluated and a summary is
provided in the following TABLE:

Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The yeast is present in the pouch in a freeze-dried
form and is hydrated and introduced into the test when the sample is loaded. The
control material is carried through all stages of the test process, including lysis,
nucleic acid purification, 1st stage PCR, dilution, 2nd stage PCR, and DNA
melting. A positive control result indicates that all steps carried out in the pouch
were successful.

· PCR2 Control: The PCR2 Control assay detects a DNA target that is dried into the
wells of the array along with the corresponding primers. A positive result indicates
that the 2nd stage PCR was successful.
Both internal control assays must be positive for the test run to pass. When either control
fails, the Controls field of the test report will display "Failed" and all results will be listed
as Invalid. If the controls fail, the user is instructed to repeat the test using a new pouch.
Of the nine pouch control failures observed in the prospective clinical study, seven were
attributed to the RNA process control and two were due to the PCR2 control. There were
no instances of both RNA process and PCR2 control failure in the same pouch.
Recommended External Controls:
External controls are not provided with the FilmArray GI Panel, but are recommended in
the package insert. Cary Blair media can be used as an external negative control.
Previously characterized positive stool samples or negative samples spiked with well
characterized organisms can be used as external positive controls. External controls should
be used in accordance with the appropriate accrediting organization requirements, as
applicable.
External Controls used in clinical studies:
Daily external control mixes (ECMs) and weekly swab testing for contamination
monitoring was performed during the clinical evaluation of the FilmArray GI Panel.
External controls used in the clinical study consisted of four different organism mixes and a
negative control provided to the clinical sites as frozen single use aliquots. (Three control
mixes consisted of Cary Blair media containing whole organisms, one contained nucleic acid
template (for organisms that could not be obtained in sufficient quantities), and one contained
Cary Blair media alone. A valid ECM was required for each day of testing. All FilmArray
GI Assay targets were represented by the four external control mixes. Testing of external
controls was rotated, with one of the five controls tested each day. No external
contamination was found when following assay instructions (i.e., prior to processing
samples, both the work area and the FilmArray Pouch Loading Station were thoroughly
cleaned using a suitable cleaner such as freshly prepared 10% bleach or a similar
disinfectant. To avoid residue build-up and potential PCR inhibition, wipe disinfected
surfaces with water.)
A total of 234 control mix runs were attempted, all of which completed. Of these, 225 (96.2%;
225/234) were successful while nine (3.8%) did not return the correct organism results either
due to the detection of an extra analyte (n=3) and/or the failure to detect one or more spiked
analytes (n=6).
PCR Comparator Controls:
An inhibition control was performed as a separate assay (primers + template) on the nucleic
acid extract of each specimen prior to running any other assay. There were no inhibition
control failures.
p. 22

Specimen Stability:
To determine whether FilmArray GI Panel test results are obtained from stool samples in
Cary-Blair stored under the time and temperature conditions recommended for use with
transport media (e.g. up to 96 hours (4 days) at room temperature or refrigerated (4 days),
10 different stool-Cary Blair specimens were spiked with representative panel organisms.
Samples were prepared by spiking organism mixes at concentrations approximately 3-fold
higher (3×) than the established LoD for each individual organism into 10 unique stool
samples in Cary Blair collected from asymptomatic donors. Each mix contained four
different representative panel organisms for a total of 12 organisms.
‘Fresh’ or non-stored sample test results (Day 0) were established by testing samples with
the FilmArray GI Panel within an hour of when the samples were prepared. The remaining
sample was aliquoted and stored at the desired storage temperatures (room temperature or
under refrigeration). At designated time-points (i.e., days 1-4), an aliquot from each sample
was tested with the FilmArray GI Panel.
Transport and storage conditions were considered acceptable for use with the FilmArray GI
Panel if accurate test results (equivalent to the non-stored samples (Day 0)) were obtained
for at least nine of the ten aliquots evaluated at that condition. Negative results were
compiled from specimens that had not been spiked with a particular organism/analyte, such
that for every storage temperature/time-point, 20-30 negative FilmArray test results were
expected. All analytes with unexpected negative test results were investigated and resolved
by testing two additional aliquots of the same sample at the same condition.

For refrigerated samples, the expected results (at least 9/10 positive) were observed for

The results of this study support the recommendations for sample handling and storage.
Stool specimens in Cary Blair can be stored for up to four days at room temperature or in
the refrigerator without affecting the accuracy of FilmArray GI Panel test results.
A total of 325 runs were initiated throughout the course of this study and 318 completed
with valid results (318/325 = 97.8%). A total of 5 runs (5/325; 1.5%) were invalid due to a
control failure, one run did not complete due to a software error (1/325; 0.3%) and another
one run (1/325; 0.3%) did not complete due to an instrument error.
d. Detection limit:
A study was performed to determine the analytical sensitivity, or limit of detection (LoD),
of the FilmArray GI Panel for each test result included in the panel. LoD (or LoD ) is
95
defined as the lowest concentration of organism that can be consistently detected (≥ 95% of
samples test positive) in the defined sample type (stool in Cary Blair transport medium).
The LoD for each organism was estimated with limiting dilutions as single-spiked and
multi-spiked samples (up to four organisms per mix), to provide an estimated LoD
concentration, and to determine whether assay sensitivity is affected by the presence of

a Limited testing with a clinical specimen containing Cryptosporidium meleagridis indicates that the LoD for this species is similar
to that of C. parvum and C. hominis.
e. Inclusivity
The analytical reactivity (inclusivity) of the FilmArray GI Panel was evaluated with a
collection of 270 isolates that represent the diversity of the FilmArray GI Panel analytes.
Isolates were selected to represent relevant subspecies or serotypes and selection was
biased toward more common species and known human pathogens. When possible, in
silico analysis of sequence data was used to make predictions of assay reactivity for less
common species, strains, serovars, or serotypes that were not tested.
Organisms were tested at concentrations near the limit of detection (LoD). If a sample
containing a particular strain was positive (detected) at the initial test level, no further
testing was required. If a strain was not detected, the strain was retested at the same level
(up to five additional times) and if necessary, additional testing was performed at 10- and
100-fold higher concentrations to determine if the strain can be detected by the GI Panel.
Based upon predicted assay reactivity, a few select isolates were initially tested at a high
concentration, followed by evaluation at lower concentrations if detection was observed.
Results are provided below for each FilmArray GI Panel test result.

a Quantification by qPCR indicated that these purified samples have an analyte concentration that is
lower than the assay LoD.
b This C. hominis sample was used to establish the LoD for C. hominis (LoD of 5.0×103 oocysts/mL
was determined to be equivalent to 2.1×103 copies/mL).
c This C. parvum isolate was used to establish the LoD for C. parvum (LoD of 5.0×103 oocysts/mL
was determined to be equivalent to 6.0×102 copies/mL).
Note: In silico sequence analysis indicates the FilmArray Cryptosporidium assay(s) should
react with approximately 23 different Cryptosporidium species (including those evaluated
in this study) as well as sequences not assigned to specific species. In silico analysis
predicts that the Cryptosporidium assay(s) may not react with the rare or non-human
species C. bovis, C. ryanae and C. xiaoi.

f. Analytical specificity (Exclusivity):
The potential for cross-reactivity between assays contained in the FilmArray GI Panel was
evaluated by testing high concentrations of analyte in contrived stool samples. The
organisms/viruses tested consisted of on-panel (identified by the GI Panel assays) and off-
panel (not identified by the GI Panel assays) organisms/viruses.
On-panel organisms were tested to verify that they only react with the appropriate assays
on the panel. On-panel exclusivity testing included 28 analytes were selected to evaluate
the potential for cross-reactivity with other panel assays. This group of organisms was
chosen such that at least one positive result would be obtained for each assay in the
FilmArray GI Panel. Each organism was tested at a high concentration to show analytical
specificity with all FilmArray GI Panel assays.
Organisms for off-panel testing were selected based on a combination of several factors
including (1) relatedness to specific species detected by the GI Panel (near-neighbors), (2)
clinical relevance, (3) likelihood of being present in stool specimens and (4) genetic
similarity to GI Panel assay primers, as determined by in silico analyses during assay
design. When empirical testing of these organisms was not performed, a separate organism-
specific in silico analysis of whole genome sequence(s) directed against all GI Panel
primers was attempted for reactivity predictions.
Results are presented for all organisms/viruses that were tested and received the expected
FilmArray GI Panel test result(s) (no cross-reactivity, table below)

fluorescence values, and analysis of melting curves.
The FilmArray GI Melt Detector software performs a set of basic calculations on the melt data
to determine if a PCR reaction occurred in each well. If the melt profile indicates that a PCR
product is present, then the analysis software calculates one or two Tm values, depending on
the number of melt curves present in the data, and the Tm values are compared against an
expected melt range for the associated assay. If the software determines that the melt is positive
and the melt curve falls inside the assay’s specific melt range, then the curve is called positive.
If the software determines that the melt is negative or that it is not in the appropriate range,

then the curve is called negative. All assays have three replicates. The melt curve for each
replicate is given a positive or negative melt call by the Melt Detector.
For individual melt curves, the observed sensitivity and specificity, as compared to expert
annotation, of the Melt Detector is greater than 98.92% and 99.99%, respectively. For the
Analysis Software, the observed sensitivity and specificity, as compared to expert annotation,
of the assay calls are greater than 99.34% and 99.99%, respectively.
h. Fresh versus Frozen Study:
This study was performed to support the use of frozen specimens in the FilmArray GI
Panel archived specimen and reproducibility testing; the test is not intended for use on
frozen samples.
Stool specimens in Cary Blair were stored at <-70°C. The test panel contained at least one
specimen for every organism on the panel (with the exception of Entamoeba histolytica).
Specimens from all four prospective clinical study sites were included in the study. The
median time interval between testing fresh and retesting from frozen was 60 days (Range:
10-90 days). Detection was 100% for most analytes but 90-94% for five analytes
(Campylobacter, C. difficile, P. shigelloides, EPEC, and Cryptosporidium), and 54-83% for
four analytes (Shigella/EIEC, G. lamblia, Norovirus) Based on study results, specific
analytes for study testing were performed with fresh or frozen samples as appropriate.
A total of 203 FilmArray runs were attempted in this evaluation of 201 frozen specimens,
201 of which were completed (99%; 201/203). There was one run failure each for a software
error (0.5%) and a control failure (0.5%).
i. Interference
Substances that could be present in stool samples (preserved in Cary Blair transport
medium) or introduced during sample handling were evaluated for their potential to
interfere with assay performance. A potentially interfering substance (see tables below)
was added to a contrived stool sample by spiking representative GI Panel organisms into
negative sample matrix (individual or pooled donor stool in transport medium). Each
contrived sample contained a mix of four different organisms, each present at
approximately three times (3×) the limit of detection (LoD). Contrived samples without
added potentially interfering substances served as positive controls.
Of the endogenous and exogenous substances tested, only the bovine-derived mucin gave
unexpected results (EPEC was reported in samples that were not spiked with EPEC). An
investigation found bacterial nucleic acid in the bovine-derived mucin used as the test
substance, and it was determined that the unexpected results were due to EPEC
contamination in the commercially prepared mucin.

a Unexpected EPEC detected results reported. The presence of EPEC nucleic acid in test material was confirmed by
independent PCR assays, indicating the unexpected results were caused by contamination of the mucin with EPEC.
No inhibition or unexpected test results were obtained in the presence of high
concentrations of potentially competing microorganisms (on-panel or off-panel
organisms; see table below). However, Rotavirus A Detected results were reported when
Rotavirus A reassortant strains used in the manufacturing of Rotavirus A vaccines were
tested (see table below). Rotavirus A vaccine may be shed in stool following oral
administration and Rotavirus A will be detected by the FilmArray GI Panel if vaccine is
present in the test sample.

Contrived stool samples prepared in various enteric and fixative-containing transport
media, including Cary Blair (see table below), were evaluated for the potential of different
media to interfere with the accuracy of FilmArray GI Panel test results. No interference
was observed for samples collected in Protocol Cary Blair or other brands of enteric
transport media (Para-Pak Enteric Plus and Para-Pak C&S media; performance of the
FilmArray GI Panel has not been established in these media). However, accurate detection
of analytes was impaired (false negative results) for samples prepared in media containing
fixatives, particularly those containing formalin.

j. Carryover Study:
To demonstrate sample-to-sample carryover does not occur when the recommended testing
and cleaning procedures are followed, five sets of samples were tested with the FilmArray GI
Panel over several days such that testing of one positive, high analyte level sample
(Plesiomonas shigelloides, Escherichia coli (STEC), Yersinia enterocolitica, Giardia
intestinalis, or Adenovirus F41) was followed directly by testing of a negative sample
(containing no analyte).
In accordance with recommended procedures, each sample was prepared and loaded into
a GI pouch one at a time using the provided pouch loading implements. Samples were
loaded in a work area (biosafety cabinet or hood) that was separated from the location of
the FilmArray instrument(s) and the loading block was cleaned between each pouch. For
each set of samples, the negative sample was loaded in the same workspace, using the
same Pouch Loading Station and tested directly after the high positive sample using the
same FilmArray instrument. No false positive results were observed during testing of five
sets of a high positive sample followed directly by a negative sample
k. Analysis of Pouch Hydration
The FilmArray GI pouch is manufactured to contain a vacuum that draws in the required
amount of Hydration Solution and Sample/Buffer Mix when the seals are broken by the
cannula-tipped cartridges in each of the pouch ports. If either the Hydration Solution or the
Sample/Buffer Mix is not drawn into the pouch, the operator is instructed to discard the
faulty pouch and obtain a new pouch to test the specimen. A total of 1591 pouches were used
to achieve successful results for the 1556 valid specimens (note: this includes 14 pouches
used for retests after initial pouch/instrument failures). Twenty two (22; 1.4%) of 1591
pouches failed to hydrate or pull in sample/buffer mix and were discarded; successful
hydration was achieved on the subsequent pouch. Overall, 98.6% (1569/1591) of pouches
used to test study specimens loaded successfully. No specimens were lost due to pouch
hydration failures.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device: N/A
b. Matrix comparison: N/A
3. Clinical studies:
The clinical performance of the FilmArray GI Panel was established during a multi-center
study conducted at four geographically distinct U.S. study sites (Pacific, North Central,
Great Lakes, and Northeast regions) between May and September, 2013. A total of 1578
prospective residual stool specimens in Cary Blair transport media were acquired for the
clinical study; 22 of these were excluded. The most common reasons for exclusion were
that a valid external control was not completed on the day of testing, that the specimen was
not plated to all of the appropriate bacterial culture media required for the reference
method, or that the specimen was beyond four days from the date of collection. The final
data set consisted of 1556 specimens.
The tables below provides a summary of the number of clinician ordered tests per site, the
types of test ordered per site and the demographic information for the 1556 specimens

FilmArray Test Results Reference/Comparator Method
Cyclospora cayetanensis
Entamoeba histolytica
a
The E. coli O157 comparator method data were only used to determine the accuracy of the FilmArray
determination of E. coli O157 detected or not detected for specimens in which FilmArray detected
STEC.
b
Any bacteria isolated from stool culture that could not be identified to the species level by laboratory
methods were sequenced using an assay capable of providing species information (e.g., 16S).
c
A result for EPEC is only reported in the absence of STEC (same algorithm as FilmArray).
d
Shigella may be identified by routine culture methods; however, culture detection will be reported for
informational purposes only.
e
CDC Calicinet assays (non-sequenceable) were used for the comparator method for Norovirus.
f
Sapovirus comparator assays consisted of one well-validated, sequenceable assay and one published
assay that was not sequenceable.
g
G. lamblia comparator assays consisted of one well-validated, sequenceable assay and one published
assay that was not sequenceable.
h
PCR assays were designed to amplify different sequences than those targeted by FilmArray GI.
Positive results for sequenceable assays required a sequencing result of adequate quality to match a
sequence of the expected organism/gene deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) GenBank database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), with an acceptable E-value.
A total of 1556 specimens were evaluated in this study. Of these specimens, 832 (53.5%)
were positive for at least one analyte. Clinical sensitivity or positive percent agreement
(PPA) was calculated as 100% x (TP / (TP + FN)). True positive (TP) indicates that both the
FilmArray GI Panel and reference/comparator method had a positive result for this specific
analyte, and false negative (FN) indicates that the FilmArray result was negative while the
comparator result was positive. Specificity or negative percent agreement (NPA) was
calculated as 100% x (TN / (TN + FP)). True negative (TN) indicates that both the
FilmArray GI Panel and the reference/comparator method had negative results, and a false
positive (FP) indicates that the FilmArray GI Panel result was positive but the comparator
result was negative. The exact binomial two-sided 95% confidence interval was calculated.
The results are summarized in the table below.

a C. difficile performance is reported as positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement, and E. coli O157
performance is reported as sensitivity/specificity, in contrast to the headings of their respective sections. The
performance measures of sensitivity and specificity only refer to those analytes for which the gold-standard bacterial
culture was used as the reference method; Campylobacter, E. coli O157, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Salmonella,
Vibrio, Vibrio cholerae, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Performance measures of positive percent agreement (PPA)
and negative percent agreement (NPA) refer to all other analytes, for which PCR/sequencing assays were used as
comparator methods.
b Campylobacter jejuni subsp. doylei was identified in the single false negative specimen using bi-directional sequence
analysis. Campylobacter was detected in 19/24 false positive specimens using bi-directional sequence analysis.
c C. difficile was detected in 1/2 false negative specimens and 41/41 false positive specimens using bi-directional
sequence analysis.
d P. shigelloides was detected in 15/15 false positive specimens using bi-directional sequence analysis.
e Salmonella was detected in 6/6 false positive specimens using bi-directional sequence analysis.
f Vibrio was detected in 2/2 false positive specimens using bi-directional sequence analysis.
g V. cholerae was detected in the single false positive specimen using bi-directional sequence analysis.
h EAEC was detected in 27/27 false positive specimens using bi-directional sequence analysis.
i EPEC was detected in 23/34 false positive specimens using bi-directional sequence analysis.
j ETEC was detected in 6/9 false positive specimens using bi-directional sequence analysis. The three remaining false
positive results were determined to have been caused by cross-reactivity with Citrobacter koseri (2 instances), and
Hafnia alvei (1 instance). These bacteria contain a variant of the fliP gene with sequence similarity to assay primers.
k STEC was detected in 5/5 false positive specimens using bi-directional sequence analysis.
l E. coli O157 was detected in the single false positive specimen using bi-directional sequence analysis.
m Cryptosporidium was detected in 6/6 false positive specimens using bi-directional sequence analysis.
n G. lamblia was detected in 4/7 false positive specimens using bi-directional sequence analysis. Two false positive
results appear to be caused by cross-reactivity with Bifidobacterium longum and Ruminococcus callidus.
o Adenovirus was detected in 1/2 false negative specimens and 11/13 false positive specimens using bi-directional
sequence analysis
p Astrovirus was detected in the single false positive specimen using bi-directional sequence analysis.
q The FilmArray GI system detected Norovirus in 1/3 false negative specimens when retested. Norovirus was detected
in 1/2 remaining false negative specimens and 8/18 false positive specimens using bi-directional sequence analysis.
r Rotavirus A was detected in 11/12 false positive specimens using bi-directional sequence analysis.
s Sapovirus was detected in 12/13 false positive specimens using bi-directional sequence analysis.
FilmArray GI reports genus level (or multiple species group) results for three bacterial
analytes; i.e., Campylobacter (C. jejuni/C. coli/C. upsaliensis), Salmonella, and Vibrio (V.
parahaemolyticus/V. vulnificus/V. cholerae). Standard laboratory methods identified
various species/serovars within each of these groups during the clinical evaluation. Where

standard methods did not provide a species identification, bi-directional sequencing was
used to identify the species of the isolate. Stratification of performance by species/serovar
is presented below.
For Vibrio, no organisms were isolated by the culture methods; however, bi-directional
sequencing from the original specimens identified one V. parahaemolyticus and one V.

a Fifteen (15) Campylobacter were not speciated by the source laboratory and were subject to
sequencing of the cadF gene. This method identified 11 C. jejuni, two C. coli, one C. jejuni
subsp. doylei, and one C. upsaliensis.
b Two C. jejuni were originally identified by the source lab as “Campylobacter species”.
Sequencing of the isolates provided by the laboratory identified them as C. jejuni. However,
molecular testing of the specimen from which the isolates were obtained also detected the
presence of C. upsaliensis, representing co-infection by these two species.

contained four organisms, 1.1% (3/262) contained five organisms, and 0.4% (1/262)
contained six organisms. The three organisms that were most prevalent in co-infections
were also the three most prevalent organisms in the study as a whole (i.e., EPEC, C.
difficile, and EAEC). Out of the 262 specimens with multiple detections, 144 specimens
(55.0%; 144/262) were concordant with the reference methods. One hundred eighteen
specimens (45.0%; 118/262) contained one or more organisms that had not been detected
by the reference/comparator methods (i.e., 139 false positive results); however, bi-
directional sequence analysis confirmed the presence of the analyte for 88.5% (123/139) of
the discordant results.

these were the most prevalent organisms detected in the study. Mixed infections were observed for
all combinations of analyte classes (e.g. bacteria with viruses, diarrheagenic E. coli/Shigella with
parasites) and co-infections were observed within classes (e.g. three diarrheagenic E. coli/Shigella
combined; ETEC, EAEC, and STEC).

The overall success rate for initial specimen tests in the prospective study was 99.4% (1544/1557).
Four tests were incomplete due to software errors (3) or a user aborted run (1), and nine tests were
invalid due to pouch control failures. Of the nine pouch control failures observed in the
prospective clinical study, seven were attributed to the RNA process control and two were due to
the PCR2 control. There were no instances of both RNA process and PCR2 control failure in the
same pouch. All specimens but one were retested within four days of specimen collection and were
successful after a single retest, for a final success rate of 99.9% (1556/1557).
Testing of Preselected Archived Specimens
Several analytes were either not encountered or had a low prevalence in the clinical study. To
supplement the results of the prospective clinical study, an evaluation of 222 preselected archived
specimens was performed. These specimens were archived clinical specimens that were selected
because they had previously tested positive for one of the following analytes: E. coli O157, P.
shigelloides, Y. enterocolitica, Vibrio, Astrovirus, Rotavirus, and E. histolytica, or had been
negative in previous laboratory testing. Prior to testing with the FilmArray GI Panel, the presence
(or absence for negative specimens) of the expected analytes was verified in each specimen using
analyte-specific PCR followed by bi-directional sequencing.
The specimens were organized into “test panels” and randomized such that the users performing
the FilmArray GI Panel testing were blinded as to the expected test result. A summary of the
available demographic information of the tested samples and the results of the FilmArray GI
testing are presented in the tables below

a No non-O157 STEC were included in the data set; therefore, negative percent agreement (NPA) could not be calculated for E. coli
O157.
Testing of Contrived Specimens
Several analytes, such as Entamoeba histolytica, are so rare that both prospective and archived
testing efforts were insufficient to demonstrate system performance. To supplement the
prospective and archived data, an evaluation of contrived specimens was performed. Surrogate
clinical specimens were prepared using residual specimens from the prospective clinical study that
had previously tested negative for all GI panel analytes by FilmArray GI and comparator methods.
Specimens were spiked at clinically relevant levels using five different quantified strains for each
organism (or unspiked; at least 50 of each). The analyte status of each contrived specimen was
blinded to the users analyzing the specimens, and the specimens were randomized before testing.
The results of the FilmArray GI testing are presented in the table below:
