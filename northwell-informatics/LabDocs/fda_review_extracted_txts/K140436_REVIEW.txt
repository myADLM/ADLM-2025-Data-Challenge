I. Device Description:
The ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative
determination of galectin-3 in human serum or EDTA plasma using CMIA
technology.
In the first step, galectin-3 in the sample is immunoprecipitated with anti-galectin-3
coated paramagnetic microparticles. After washing, anti-galectin-3 acridinium-
labeled conjugate is added to create a reaction mixture in the second step. Following
another wash cycle, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction
mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated in accordance with the CLSI EP-6A guideline using 1
reagent lot and 1 ARCHITECT i2000SR System in STAT mode for both
serum and plasma types. Serum and EDTA plasma samples with high
concentrations of galectin-3 were prepared by spiking each sample type with
HeLa cell lysate galectin-3. Twelve samples spanning the linear range of the
assay were prepared for serum and plasma each by intermixing. For serum, a
low serum sample (treated to remove galectin-3) was intermixed with the
spiked high serum sample. For plasma, a low plasma sample (prepared by
dilution with CAL A) was intermixed with spiked high plasma sample. A
total of 3 replicates were measured for each sample pool.
The cubic model was significant for all analyses based on unweighted
regression models. For serum, the test results did not deviate from linearity
by more than 9.2%. For plasma, the test results did not deviate from linearity
by more than 2.5%.
High Dose Hook Effect: The sponsor demonstrated that there was no high
dose hook effect from the concentration of the CAL F calibrator (≈114
ng/mL) to ≈1400 ng/mL.
The studies support the sponsor’s claimed linear range of 5.5 ng/mL to 103.1
ng/mL.
The sponsor includes the following limitation in the labeling: Accuracy may
be assessed using samples prepared by diluting the ARCHITECT Galectin-3
Calibrator F with the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 Calibrator A.
The sponsor performed studies to support their recommendation that samples
can be diluted 1:2.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ARCHITECT Calibrators and Controls are standardized to an internal
gravimetric standard. Calibrators and controls are value assigned using
primary reference curves and verified using quality control material and
pooled panel samples that must meet specifications. The value assignment
process was reviewed and found to be acceptable.
Calibrator and Control Stability: The calibrators and controls are stable for 12
months unopened at 2-8°C. The calibrators and controls are stable for 12
months once opened at 2-8°C. The calibrator and control stability protocols
were reviewed and found acceptable.

d. Detection limit:
Limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ)
studies were performed using a protocol based on CLSI EP-17A, Protocols for
Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation and analyzed
as described below.
LoB Test Protocol
To estimate LoB, 5 blank samples were measured in replicates of 5 on 2
ARCHITECT i2000SR systems (STAT mode) for 2 runs per day over 3 days
for each of 2 lots yielding 60 measurements per lot.
LoB was defined as the concentration at which there is a 95% probability that
the sample is analyte-free and was calculated nonparametrically.
LoD Test Protocol
To estimate LoD, 5 low level samples were measured in replicates of 5 on 2
ARCHITECT i2000SR systems (STAT mode) for 2 runs per day over 3 days
for each of 2 lots yielding 60 measurements per lot.
LoD was defined based on a b of 0.05 and was calculated nonparametrically.
LoQ Test Protocol
To estimate LoQ, 5 low level samples were measured in replicates of 5 on 2
ARCHITECT i2000SR systems (STAT mode) for 2 runs per day over 3 days
for each of 2 lots yielding 60 measurements per lot.
The ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay exhibits a CV of 10% at the claimed LoQ.
LoB = 1.0 ng/mL
LoD = 1.1 ng/mL
LoQ = 2.8 ng/mL
The measuring range of the assay is 5.5 ng/mL to 103.1 ng/mL based on the
linear range of the assay (see section M 1.b above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross Reactivity
To evaluate cross reactivity due to protein isoforms (enumerated in the
following table), the proteins were added to the following pooled samples: 1
serum sample and 2 EDTA plasma samples with concentrations of native
galectin-3 of 10-13 ng/mL, and 1 serum sample spiked with recombinant
10

--- Page 11 ---
galectin-3 at a concentration of 10-13 ng/mL, and 2 plasma samples and 2
serum samples spiked with recombinant galectin-3 for a final concentration of
≈26 ng/mL. Control samples were tested in replicates of 6, and test samples
were tested in replicates of 3. For each cross reactant tested, cross reactivity
was analyzed by comparing the mean of the true value samples (no interferent
added) to the test samples (interferent added) and calculated using the
following formula: % cross reactivity = [(mean of test sample – mean of true
sample)/concentration of interferent] X 100.

Endogenous Interferents
To evaluate potential interference due to endogenous substances (enumerated
in the following table), the interferents were added to the pooled samples
targeting galectin-3 at concentrations of 10-13 ng/mL and ≈26 ng/mL for
serum and EDTA plasma. The number and specimen type of pooled samples
for each interferent is included in the table below. Control samples were
tested in replicates of 3, and test samples were tested in replicates of 3. For
each substance tested, interference was analyzed by comparing the mean of
the true value samples (no interferent added) to the test samples (interferent
added) and calculated according to the following formula: % interference =
[(mean of test sample – mean of true sample)/mean of true sample] X 100.
The concentrations of interferents used in testing are included below. At the
testing concentrations, test results exhibited a maximum bias of ±13.6% with
most samples within ±10%.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The clinical effectiveness at the 17.8 ng/mL cutoff was evaluated using a set
of banked serum samples from the Penn Heart Failure study (PHFS). The
PHFS is a multi-center prospective cohort study of outpatients with chronic
heart failure in the US. The PHFS study population is comprised of
approximately 2000 chronic HF patients and includes systolic and diastolic
HF patients classified as NYHA class I, II, III, and IV and baseline serum and
plasma samples were collected from each subject at enrollment. The study
endpoints were all-cause mortality, hospitalization for worsening heart failure,
cardiac transplantation and ventricular assist device placement. A study
cohort of 405 samples was used to validate the cutoff. The sponsor performed
a sensitivity analysis that demonstrated that this study cohort was
representative of the whole study. The 17.8 ng/mL cutoff was analyzed using
a Cox multi-variate regression model in these 405 patients using the
composite of the 4 endpoints. Galectin-3 was significantly associated with
increased risk after adjusting for the baseline risk factors of age, gender,
NYHA functional classification, left ventricular ejection fraction, diabetes and
smoking. The following figures and tables display Kaplan Meier survival
curve for all-cause mortality and hazard ratios for the increased risk. The
sponsor validated the sample stability of the banked samples.

The bar graph below depicts the cumulative probability of the primary endpoint
(hospitalization due to worsening HF, ventricular assist device placement, cardiac
transplantation, or all-cause mortality) by galectin-3 category, at selected time
points.
Clinical Interpretation in the context of Natriuretic Peptides
A comparative analysis of galectin-3 concentration, NT-proBNP
concentration and event rate using the banked plasma samples from the PHFS
was provided to provide additional interpretive information for the clinical use
of galectin-3. NT-proBNP was measured at baseline in 361 samples of the
405 samples that validated the clinical cutoff and that were representative of
those 405 samples as a whole. The analysis evaluated the event rate for the
PHFS composite endpoint in comparison to the concentration of galectin-3
(above and below the cutoff 17.8 ng/mL) and the concentration of NT-
proBNP concentrations above and below the median (1222 pg/mL) of the 361
samples that were tested. The sponsor validated the sample stability of the
banked samples.
