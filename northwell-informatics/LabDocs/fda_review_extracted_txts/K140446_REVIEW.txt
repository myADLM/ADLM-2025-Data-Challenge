L. Test Principle:
The BD ProbeTec CTQ Assay is based on the simultaneous amplification and detection of target
DNA using amplification primers and a fluorescently-labeled detector probe. The reagents for
SDA are dried in two separate disposable microwells: the Priming Microwell contains the
amplification primers, fluorescently-labeled detector probe, nucleotides, and other reagents
necessary for amplification, while the Amplification Microwell contains the two enzymes (a
DNA polymerase and a restriction endonuclease) that are required for SDA. The BD Viper LT
System pipettes a portion of the purified DNA solution from each Extraction Tube into a Priming
Microwell to rehydrate the contents. After a brief incubation, the reaction mixture is transferred
to a corresponding, pre-warmed Amplification Microwell which is sealed to prevent
contamination and then incubated in one of the two thermally-controlled fluorescent readers. The
presence or absence of CT DNA is determined by calculating the peak fluorescence (Maximum
Relative Fluorescence Units; Max RFU) over the course of the amplification process and by
comparing this measurement to a predetermined threshold value.
In addition to the fluorescent probe used to detect amplified CT target DNA, a second
fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotide is incorporated into each reaction. The Extraction Control
(EC) oligonucleotide is labeled with a different dye than that used for detection of the CT-
specific target and is used to confirm the validity of the extraction process. The EC is dried in the
Extraction Tubes and is re-hydrated upon addition of the specimen and extraction reagents. At
the end of the extraction process, the EC fluorescence is monitored by the BD Viper LT System
and an automated algorithm is applied to both the EC and CT-specific signals to report specimen
results as positive, negative, or EC failure.

(GC; ATCC strain 19424) were spiked into clinical matrix in their respective diluents: vaginal
swab matrix in Swab Diluent for the BD ProbeTec CT/GC Amplified DNA Assays (“Qx Swab
Diluent”), female urine in Urine Preservative Transport media for the BD ProbeTec Qx
Amplified DNA Assays (“UPT”), or liquid based cytology specimens (LBC) in PreservCyt LBC
media diluted into BD LBC Specimen Dilution Tubes.
Four levels were created for each matrix/diluent type: negative, high negative (C -C ), low
20 80
positive (1.5X LoD), and moderate positive (3X LoD). Reproducibility for GC can be found in
K140448. The reproducibility panel was comprised of twelve panel members (3 clinical matrices
x 4 levels = 12 panel members). Testing was conducted at 2 external sites (each had one BD
Viper LT) and one internal site (one BD Viper LT and three BD Viper Systems). One lot of
extraction and amplification reagents and one lot of the Control Set for the BD ProbeTec CT/GC
Qx Amplified DNA Assays (“BD CT/GC Qx Control Set”) were included in this study.
For the BD Viper LT System, there were two operators per site testing one run per day on one
instrument over a total of 8 days. Each panel member was tested in duplicate on three BD Viper
LT Systems over eight days by two operators (2 x 3 x 8 x 2 = 96 tests per level). The
reproducibility the BD ProbeTec CTQ Assay on the BD Viper is shown in Table 1 below.

# The results for negative panel members were calculated according to an expected result of ‘negative for CT.’ All
other panel members were calculated according to an expected result of ‘positive for CT.’
The data presented in Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate good reproducibility for the BD ProbeTec
CTQ Assay on the BD Viper LT and the BD Viper System. On both systems, the assay shows ≥
95% detection of CT at low positive/close to the detection limit and moderate positive levels. For
the high negative samples, detection was >5% and ˂95% positive on both systems. Taken
together, this data indicates that the reproducibility for the BD Viper LT and the BD Viper
System is similar.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
N/A
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Post Pre-Warm Specimen Stability
The existing workflow previously cleared for the BD ProbeTec CTQ Assay on the BD Viper
includes a pre-warm step for swab and urine samples. The workflow proposed in K140446 for
the BD Viper LT System includes a pre-warm step for LBC specimens in SurePath or
PreservCyt media so all sample types (urine, swabs, and LBC specimens) can be tested on the
same instrument run. For this reason, a post pre-warm specimen stability study was conducted to
support the storage and transport stability claims for LBC specimens in SurePath or PreservCyt
LBC media.

Mini-pools were created by diluting CT and GC negative LBC specimens in either SurePath or
PreservCyt LBC media at a ratio of 1:3.4 mL (12 mini-pools were created for each LBC media).
Each mini-pool was split equally. Half were spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain ATCC
19424 (at 90 EB/mL and 300 cells/mL, respectively) and half were not spiked (negative
samples). Results for GC can be found in K140448. From these split mini-pools, 2.2 mL aliquots
were removed and dispensed into BD LBC Specimen Dilution Tubes (15 samples per group; 30
samples total/mini-pool). Fourteen of these tubes were pre-warmed in the BD Viper LT heat
block at 114°C for 15 min, one tube was read at “baseline” (no warming).
After the pre-warm step, the seven tubes were stored at the following conditions: two tubes at 2-
8°C for 7 days, two tubes at 30°C for 7 days, and two tubes at -20°C for 90 days (one tube was
available for testing and one was available for retesting, if required). At each storage
condition/time point, one negative and one positive tube from each of the 12 mini-pools was
removed and tested in a dual dispensing mode, which generated two replicate test results (1 tube
x 2 replicates x 12 mini-pools = 24 measurements/storage condition/time point for each LBC
media type). Four lots of extraction reagents, 2-3 lots of amplification reagents, three lots of the
BD CT/GC Qx Control Set, and three BD Viper LT Systems were included in this study. Results
are summarized in Tables 2 and 3 below.

Run Control Failure Rate
This analysis was conducted to determine the failure rate for the BD CT/GC Qx Control Set
across four different studies. One positive and negative control result was recorded for each run
for each of the following:
Clinical agreement study = 56 runs
Carry-over study (in K140446, referred to as “contamination validation study”) = 63 runs
LoD/LoB validation studies = 71 runs
Reproducibility study = 51 runs
A total of 241 results were collected for each control type. There were no false negatives found
in the positive control samples assessed (0/241 x 100 = 0% failure rate). There were 2 false
positives found in the negative control samples assessed (2/241 x 100 = 0.83% failure rate).
Environmental Study
The environmental study was conducted to assess the performance of the BD ProbeTec CTQ
Assay on the BD Viper LT when the instrument is exposed to variations in environmental
temperature and humidity. One BD Viper LT was placed in an environmental chamber and
equilibrated to either 1) 18°C with 20% humidity (low temperature, low humidity) or 2) 27°C
with 85% humidity (high temperature, high humidity). Three lots of positive and negative
controls from the BD CT/GC Qx Control Set were reconstituted with Viper QC Wash Buffer and
run as samples. For the negative controls, 30 “samples” were prepared from each lot with one
run per lot. An extraction control (EC) was included in each of the negative controls to show that
the negative result was valid (30 negative samples/ECs x 3 lots = 90 measurements). For the
positive controls, 90 “samples” were prepared from each lot with 3 runs/lot (90 positive
samples/lot x 3 lots = 270 measurements).
Each rack was loaded with all positive or all negative controls (30/rack). These were logged in as
“samples.” On each rack, one pair of positive and negative controls were run normally (e.g.,
reconstituted, extracted, and amplified by the BD Viper LT). This study required 12 runs total
with one lot of extraction and amplification reagents for testing with the assay. The results are
summarized in Table 5 below.

There were no false negatives or false positives detected in this study, indicating that the
performance of the BD ProbeTec CTQ Assay on the BD Viper LT is not affected by the
temperature and humidity tested in this study.

d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection (LoD)
The following clinical matrices were tested in the LoD studies: vaginal swabs in Qx Swab
Diluent, urine in UPT, and SurePath or PreservCyt LBC specimens in LBC Specimen Dilution
Tubes. For all LoD studies, CT serovar H (ATCC VR879; strain UW-43/Cx) and GC (ATCC
strain 19424) were paired for testing and CT serovar D (ATCC VR885; strain UW-3Cx) and GC
(ATCC strain 49226) were paired for testing. Results of the LoD studies for GC can be found in
K140448.
i. LoD Detection – BD Viper and BD Viper LT
For each matrix, four mini-pools were prepared and then used to create LoD detection panels
(one panel was created for each of the four mini-pools). Each LoD detection panel contained six
analyte levels for CT and GC (CT concentrations in Table 6 below; GC results can be found in
K140448). There were six replicates created for the six analyte levels (4 mini-pools x 6 analyte
levels x 6 replicates for each of the analyte levels = 144 total tubes tested per matrix).

*Repeat of CT serovar H vaginal swab LoD with new CT target levels and increased replicates due to variable
positive rates and poor reproducibility at low target levels thus impacting the model fit and the accuracy of the LoD
estimates. Target levels chosen are representative of the claimed LoD per K091824.
The LoD detection study was conducted in one day for each matrix type by two operators
running samples on 3 BD Viper and 3 BD Viper LT Systems. Table 7 demonstrates the setup of
a rack on one instrument. Each rack was run twice on the same instrument (4 replicates x 6 levels
x 2 runs/rack = 48 measurements/rack).

A target titration plot was created by graphing the percent positive versus the concentration of
CT EBs/mL in Log . Probit analysis was used to estimate the 95% LoD concentration for the
10
BD Viper LT and BD Viper System. Results of the LoD detection study are shown in the Table 8

Viper).
ii. LoD Confirmation – BD Viper LT
For each matrix, one pool was created and then split into two aliquots of equal volume. One
aliquot was spiked with CT serovar H and the other aliquot was spiked with CT serovar D. The
LoD concentrations from the LoD determination study (see table 8 above) were used for spiking
levels. Twenty replicates were generated from each aliquot. All samples were tested using one
lot of reagents and one BD Viper LT. The results of the LoD confirmation are shown in Table 9
below.

determination study.
Limit of Blank (LoB)
Data from CT negative specimens (Level 0) from the analytical LoD studies described above
were combined to calculate an overall LoB for the BD ProbeTec CTQ Assay on the BD Viper
LT. Data from all specimen matrices were compared and the worst (or highest) LoB estimate
among all the specimen matrices was selected as the overall LoB (68 MaxRFU). Because this
value is below the assay threshold of 125 MaxRFU, this demonstrates that the assay has an
acceptable separation between background fluorescence obtained from CT negative specimens
and the assay cut-off for a positive result.
e. Analytical specificity:
Carry-Over/System Contamination
The carry-over study was conducted to look for the presence of contamination in negative
specimens due to carry-over of DNA during nucleic acid extraction and PCR amplification in the
BD Viper LT. Each run consisted of 15 high positive and 15 negative samples arranged in
alternating positive or negative rows. To create high positive samples, 1 x 105 EB/mL of CT was
spiked into either one of two diluents (listed below). These diluents were selected because they
represent two most challenging settings that can cause sample contamination.
1. 3 mL of Qx Swab Diluent: This volume was selected to represent a maximum fill volume,
thereby maximizing the amount of fluid adhering to the outside of the pipette tip.
2. PreservCyt LBC media diluted in BD LBC Specimen Dilution tube diluent (1.7 mL LBC
diluent + 0.5 mL PreservCyt = 2.2 mL; “LBC Specimen Matrix”): This LBC media was
selected because it has a high alcohol content and is therefore more likely to drip from the
pipette tips during sample transfer due to low surface tension.
Each run consisted of 30 samples. Seven runs were conducted per instrument with 3 BD Viper
LT Systems for a total of (30 samples/run x 7 runs x 3 instruments) 630 measurements for each
diluent. Runs were conducted by three operators over a period of three days. Two lots of
extraction reagents, one lot of amplification reagents, and two lots of the BD CT/GC Qx Control
Set were used in this study.

Table 10 – Carry Over on Viper LT
The overall rate of carry-over was 0.32% (2/630) for CT spiked into the Qx Swab Diluent and
0.0% (0/630) for CT spiked into PreservCyt media diluted in BD LBC Specimen Dilution tube
diluent. These results are acceptable as they are comparable to the levels of carry-over cleared
for the BD ProbeTec CTQ Assay on the BD Viper in K081824.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off was established previously in K081824.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical Comparison Study
The results of the BD ProbeTec CTQ Assay run on the BD Viper LT were compared to the
results obtained with the BD Viper System in a clinical comparison study. Clinical samples were
collected between October 2012 and April 2013 from four geographically diverse clinical sites in
North America (OB/GYN, sexually transmitted disease and family planning clinics). For each
female subject, specimens were collected in the following order: (1) a first void urine specimen,
(2) five patient-collected vaginal swab specimens, and (3) a SurePath liquid based cytology
(LBC) specimen and a PreservCyt LBC specimen. The LBC specimen collection order was
randomized throughout the study. For each male subject, a first void urine specimen was
collected. Each urine specimen (male and female) was aliquoted into five UPTs (BD urine
Preservative Transport for the Qx Amplified DNA Assays).
A total of 823 subjects were enrolled (170 males and 653 females). Specimens were collected
from subjects presenting with symptoms of CT and/or GC (symptomatic) and shipped to BD on
cold packs for screening, aliquoting, and panel assembly. Following exclusion of non-compliant
subjects and non-evaluable specimens, a total of 617 compliant female subjects and 167
compliant male subjects were available for the clinical comparison panel assembly.
To create the clinical comparison panel, for each subject, a UPT specimen was tested on the BD
Viper. These results were used to confirm that the target number of CT positive panel members
had been met. The clinical comparison panel consisted of randomly selected positive and
negative specimens with four aliquots created from each specimen type. The number of
13

--- Page 14 ---
specimens selected for the clinical comparison panel was based on minimums suggested by FDA
in previous correspondence (minimum of 40 CT positive and 40 CT negative). The positive and
negative specimens were randomized within the panel and the testing sites were blinded to the
results for each panel member. Panels were identical across all testing sites. Three external sites
tested the panels on the BD Viper LT. An internal site tested the panels on the BD Viper System.
Results from the two instruments were compared and expressed statistically as positive and
negative percent agreement.
