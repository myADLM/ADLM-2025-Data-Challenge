L. Test Principle:
The BD ProbeTec GC Qx Amplified DNA Assay is based on the simultaneous amplification
and detection of target DNA using amplification primers and a fluorescently-labeled detector
probe. The reagents for SDA are dried in two separate disposable microwells: the Priming
Microwell contains the amplification primers, fluorescently-labeled detector probe,
nucleotides, and other reagents necessary for amplification, while the Amplification
Microwell contains the two enzymes (a DNA polymerase and a restriction endonuclease) that
are required for SDA. The BD Viper LT System pipettes a portion of the purified DNA
solution from each Extraction Tube into a Priming Microwell to rehydrate the contents. After
a brief incubation, the reaction mixture is transferred to a corresponding, pre-warmed
Amplification Microwell which is sealed to prevent contamination and then incubated in one
of the two thermally-controlled fluorescent readers. The presence or absence of Neisseria
gonorrhoeae DNA is determined by calculating the peak fluorescence (Maximum Relative
Fluorescence Units (Max RFU)) over the course of the amplification process and by
comparing this measurement to a predetermined threshold value.
In addition to the fluorescent probe used to detect amplified N. gonorrhoeae target DNA, a
second fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotide is incorporated into each reaction. The
Extraction Control (EC) oligonucleotide is labeled with a different dye than that used for
detection of the N. gonorrhoeae-specific target and is used to confirm the validity of the
extraction process. The EC is dried in the Extraction Tubes and is re-hydrated upon addition
of the specimen and extraction reagents. At the end of the extraction process, the EC
fluorescence is monitored by the BD Viper LT instrument and an automated algorithm is
applied to both the EC and N. gonorrhoeae-specific signals to report specimen results as
positive, negative, or EC failure.

Reproducibility
To create the panel for the reproducibility study, CT (serovar H) and GC (ATCC strain
19424) were spiked into female UPT urine, PreservCyt LBC fluid or vaginal matrix in Qx
dilutent at four levels: negative, high negative (C -C ), low positive (1.5x LoD), and
20 80
moderate positive (3x LoD). The reproducibility panel was comprised of four levels of
analyte for each of the three matrix types (4 levels x 3 matrices = 12 panel members).
Each panel member was tested in duplicate on three BD Viper LT instruments over eight
days with two operators testing a panel per day (2 replicates x 3 instruments x 8 days x 2
operators = 96 tests per panel member). Testing was conducted at two external sites (each
had one BD Viper LT) and one internal site (one BD Viper LT and three BD Viper
Instruments). For the BD Viper System, two operators tested the same number of panel
members on three instruments over a period of four days. Results were tabulated by day,
by operator, by replicate, across days within a site, and across sites for each sample level.
Positive and negative percent agreement was calculated along with 95% confidence
intervals for each assay by specimen type and level over all sites and days.

* The results for Negative panel members calculated according to an expected result of ‘negative for GC’. All other
panel members calculated according to an expected result of ‘positive for GC’.
The data demonstrates good reproducibility as it shows ≥ 95% detection of GC at low
positive/close to the detection limit and moderate positive levels on both instruments.
Detection was ≤ 21% for the high negative samples on the BD Viper LT, which is
acceptable and typical for SDA assays. The total percent variance for each of the
specimen types across both the old and the new system are approximately equivalent.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: N/A
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
Post Pre-Warm Specimen Stability
The existing workflow previously cleared for the BD ProbeTec GC Qx Amplified DNA
Assay on the BD Viper includes a pre-warm step for swab and urine samples. The
workflow proposed in K140448 for the BD Viper LT includes a pre-warm step for LBC
specimens in SurePath or PreservCyt media so all sample types (urine, swabs, and LBC
specimens) can be tested on the same instrument run. For this reason, a post pre-warm
specimen stability study was conducted to support the storage and transport stability
claims for LBC specimens in SurePath or PreservCyt LBC media.

Mini-pools were created by diluting CT and NG negative LBC specimens in either
SurePath or PreservCyt LBC media at a ratio of 1:3.4 mL (12 mini-pools were created for
each LBC media). Each mini-pool was split equally. Half were spiked with CT serovar
H and NG strain ATCC 19424 (at 90 EB/mL and 300 cells/mL, respectively) and half
were not spiked (negative samples). From these split mini-pools, 2.2 mL aliquots were
removed and dispensed into BD LBC Specimen Dilution Tubes (15 samples per group;
30 samples total/mini-pool). Fourteen of these tubes were pre-warmed in the BD Viper
LT heat block at 114°C for 15 min; one tube was read at “baseline” (no warming).
After the pre-warm step, the seven tubes were stored at the following conditions: two
tubes at 2-8°C for 7 days, two tubes at 30°C for 7 days, and two tubes at -20°C for 90
days (one tube was available for testing and one was available for retesting, if required).
At each storage condition/time point, one negative and one positive tube from each of the
12 mini-pools was removed and tested in a dual dispensing mode, which generated two
replicate test results (1 tube x 2 replicates x 12 mini-pools = 24 measurements/storage
condition/time point for each LBC media type). Four lots of extraction reagents, 2-3 lots
of amplification reagents, three lots of the control set for the BD ProbeTec CT/GC Qx
Amplified DNA Assays, and three BD Viper LT Instruments were included in this study.

The data indicates that, for all conditions and time points tested, the percent positive rate
for pre-warmed GC positive and percent negative rate for GC negative LBC samples was
100% for samples stored in either PreservCyt or SurePath LBC media.
Run Control Failure Rate
This analysis was conducted to determine the failure rate for positive and negative
controls across four different studies. One positive and negative control result was
recorded for each run for each of the following:
Clinical agreement study = 56 runs
Carry-over study (in K140448, referred to as “contamination validation study”) = 63 runs
LoD/LoB validation studies = 71 runs
Reproducibility study = 51 runs
A total of 241 results were collected for each control type. There were no false negatives
found in the positive control samples assessed (0/241 x 100 = 0% failure rate). There
were 2 false positives found in the negative control samples assessed (2/241 x 100 =
0.83% failure rate).
Environmental Study
The environmental study was conducted to assess the performance of the BD ProbeTec
GC Qx Amplified DNA Assay on the BD Viper LT when the instrument is exposed to
variations in environmental temperature and humidity. One BD Viper LT instrument was
placed in an environmental chamber and equilibrated to either 1) 18°C with 20%
humidity (low temperature, low humidity) or 2) 27°C with 85% humidity (high
temperature, high humidity). Three lots of positive and negative controls from the control
set for the BD ProbeTec CT/GC Qx Amplified DNA Assays were reconstituted with
Viper QC Wash Buffer and run as samples. For the negative controls, 30 “samples” were
prepared from each lot with one run per lot. An extraction control (EC) was included in
each of the negative controls to show that the negative result was valid (30 negative
samples/ECs x 3 lots = 90 measurements). For the positive controls, 90 “samples” were
prepared from each lot with 3 runs/lot (90 positive samples/lot x 3 lots = 270
measurements).
Each rack was loaded with all positive or all negative controls (30/rack) that were logged
in as “samples”, and one pair of positive and negative controls that were run normally

Limit of Detection (LoD)
Sample mini-pools were prepared from pre-screened CT/GC negative vaginal swabs in
Qx diluent, urine in UPT, endocervical swabs in SurePath LBC diluent, and endocervical
swabs in PreservCyt LBC diluent. Four mini-pools were prepared for each matrix to be
tested.
Four mini-pools of matrix were used to create panels with six analyte levels per minipool
and six replicates per analyte level (4 minipools x 6 levels x 6 replicates = 144 total
tubes). The panels were tested across six instruments. The table below demonstrates the
setup of a rack on one instrument:

Spiking levels for the sets consisted of the following concentrations of GC: 0, 5, 20, 50,
100, or 200 cells/mL. The LoD concentrations for each instrument were determined for
two strains of GC by identifying the lowest concentration of GC cells/mL which provided
a detection rate of at least 95%. The table below summarizes the LoD for the two strains
of GC in each matrix type as detected by the two instruments:

The difference in LoD as determined on the BD Viper LT compared to the BD Viper
System ranged from 0.5x to 2.5x GC cells/mL. The observed ratio is acceptable as
‘approximately equivalent’.
Limit of Blank (LoB)
Data from GC negative specimens (Level 0) from the analytical LoD studies described
above were combined to calculate an overall LoB for the BD ProbeTec GC Qx Assay on
the BD Viper LT. Data from all specimen matrices were compared and the worst (or
highest) LoB estimate among all the specimen matrices was selected as the overall LoB
(70 MaxRFU). Because this value is below the assay threshold of 125 MaxRFU, this
demonstrates that the assay has an acceptable separation between background
fluorescence obtained from GC negative specimens and the assay cut-off for a positive
result.

Carry-Over/System Contamination
The carry-over study was conducted to look for the presence of contamination in negative
specimens due to carry-over of DNA during nucleic acid extraction and PCR
amplification in the BD Viper LT. Each run consisted of 15 high positive and 15 negative
samples arranged in alternating positive or negative rows. The CT Qx Assay was selected
as the representative analyte test due to better analytical sensitivity of CT. For
information on the CT Qx assay, see K140446. To create high positive samples, 1 x 105
EB/mL of CT was spiked into either one of two diluents (listed below). These diluents
were selected because they represent two most challenging settings that can cause sample
contamination.
1. 3 mL of Qx Swab Diluent: This volume was selected to represent a maximum fill
volume, thereby maximizing the amount of fluid adhering to the outside of the
pipette tip.
2. PreservCyt LBC media diluted in BD LBC Specimen Dilution tube diluent (1.7
mL LBC diluent + 0.5 mL PreservCyt = 2.2 mL; “LBC Specimen Matrix”): This
LBC media was selected because it has a high alcohol content and is therefore
more likely to drip from the pipette tips during sample transfer due to low surface
tension.
Each run consisted of 30 samples. Seven runs were conducted per instrument with 3 BD
Viper LT Systems for a total of (30 samples/run x 7 runs x 3 instruments) 630
measurements for each diluent. Runs were conducted by three operators over a period of
three days. Two lots of extraction reagents, one lot of amplification reagents, and two lots
of the BD CT/GC Qx Control Set were used in this study.

The overall rate of carry-over was 0.32% (2/630) for CT spiked into the Qx Swab Diluent
and 0.0% (0/630) for CT spiked into PreservCyt media diluted in BD LBC Specimen
Dilution tube diluent. These results are acceptable as they are comparable to the levels of
carry-over cleared for the BD ProbeTec GCQ Assay on the BD Viper in K081825.

Clinical Comparison Study
A clinical comparison study was performed to compare results obtained with the BD
ProbeTec GC Qx Amplified DNA Assay tested on the BD Viper LT system and the BD
Viper system run in extracted mode. Clinical samples were collected between October
2012 and April 2013 from four geographically diverse clinical sites in North America
(OB/GYN, sexually transmitted disease and family planning clinics). For each female
subject, specimens were collected in the following order: (1) a first void urine specimen,
(2) five patient-collected vaginal swab specimens, and (3) a SurePath liquid based
cytology (LBC) specimen and a PreservCyt LBC specimen. The LBC specimen
collection order was randomized throughout the study. For each male subject, a first void
urine specimen was collected. Each urine specimen (male and female) was aliquoted into
five UPTs (BD urine Preservative Transport for the Qx Amplified DNA Assays).
A total of 823 subjects were enrolled, 170 males and 653 females. Specimens were
collected from subjects presenting with symptoms of chlamydia and/or gonorrhoeae
(symptomatic) and shipped to BD on cold packs for screening, aliquoting, and panel
assembly. Following exclusion of non-compliant subjects and non-evaluable specimens,
a total of 617 compliant female subjects and 167 compliant male subjects were available
for the clinical comparison panel assembly.
To create the clinical comparison panel, for each subject, a UPT specimen was tested on
the BD Viper System operating in extracted mode (BD Viper). These results were used to
confirm that the target number of CT and NG positive panel members had been met. The
clinical comparison panel consisted of randomly selected positive and negative
specimens with four aliquots created from each specimen type. The number of GC
positive and negative specimens chosen for the clinical comparison panel was based on
minimums suggested by FDA in previous correspondence (minimum of 25 GC positive
and 40 negative). The positive and negative specimens were randomized within the panel
and the testing sites were blinded to the results for each panel member. Panels were
identical across all testing sites. Three external sites tested the panels on the BD Viper LT
instrument and compared the results (positive and negative percent agreement) to the
results obtained on the BD Viper. The BD Viper panel testing was conducted internally
at BD.
