I. Device Description:
The Trinity Biotech CaptiaTM Measles IgM test is an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays
(ELISA). When measles antigen (Edmonston strain) is bound to the solid phase and brought
into contact with a patient's serum, antigen specific antibody, if present, will bind to the
antigen on the solid phase forming antigen-antibody complexes. Excess antibody is removed
by washing. This is followed by the addition of goat anti-human IgM globulin conjugated
with horseradish peroxidase which will bind to the antibody-antigen complexes. The excess
conjugate is removed by washing, followed by the addition of Chromogen/Substrate
tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). If specific antibody to the antigen is present in the patient's
serum, a blue color develops. When the enzymatic reaction is stopped with 1N H SO , The
2 4
contents of the wells turn yellow. The color, which is indicative of the concentration of
antibody in the serum, can be read on a suitable spectrophotometer or ELISA microwell plate
reader. Each kit contains the following components in sufficient quantities to perform the
number of tests indicated on the package label.
1. Purified measles antigen coated microassay plate: 96 wells, configured in twelve 1x8
strips stored in a foil pouch with desiccant. (96T: one plate)

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross Reactivity:
A total of 47 samples were used for establishing the potential cross reactivity of the
Trinity Biotech Captia™ Measles IgM ELISA Test Kit. The samples were selected as
confirmed positive by Trinity Biotech Captia™ CMV IgM, HSV1 IgM, HSV2 IgM,
Rubella IgM, VZV IgM and Mumps IgM test kits, for each of the following
potentially cross-reacting agents: CMV, HSV-1, HSV-2, Rubella, VZV, Mumps and
Parvo-B19. Fourteen (14) of the suspected cross reactive samples tested as measles
IgM antibody positive or equivocal (12 positive and 2 equivocal) with the Trinity
Biotech Captia™ Measles IgM ELISA test kit. These 14 samples were then run on a
comparator Measles IgM IFA test kit and a comparator Measles IgM ELISA test kit.
A sample was determined as measles IgM antibody positive if the results on two (2)
measles IgM tests were positive. A sample was determined as measles IgM antibody
negative if the results on two (2) measles IgM tests were negative. The results are
presented in the table below:

Potential cross reactivity was observed with CMV IgM, HSV1 IgM and HSV2 IgM.
Potential cross-reactivity with Parvovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and
parainfluenza has not been ruled out, as either specimens were not tested or a limited
number were tested.
Interfering Substances:
Interfering substance testing was conducted using three (3) characterized samples for
measles IgM, spiked with recommended interfering substances according to the
guidance in the CLSI document EP7-A2 (Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry;
Approved Guideline 2nd Ed). Results from the three (3) samples tested as spiked
with the interfering substance and unspiked (as a control) were favourable. No
adverse results or significant change in results occurred with these samples tested
with the following:

Potential Interferent Concentration
Hemoglobin ≥500 mg/dL
Bilirubin (unconjugated) ≥20 mg/dL
Interferents with substances such as red cells, cholesterol, gamma globulin,
triglycerides, beta carotene, protein, ascorbic acid and anticoagulants have not been
tested.
High Dose Hook Effect:
When antigen is evaluated for purchase, it is titrated to ensure that there is no dose
hook effect (prozone) of antigen on the plate. If prozoning is apparent then the
antigen is titrated out further past the prozone point.
Due to the nature of obtaining IgM positive serum in general, positive serum
purchased for the Captia Measles IgM generally contains less antibody than would be
present to demonstrate dose hook effect (prozone), although the positive control in
each kit lot is titrated to negative at each kit QC test stage to ensure the positive
control is not prozoning.
IgM/IgG Competition:
Specific IgG may compete with the IgM for sites and may result in a false negative.
Conversely, rheumatoid factor in the presence of specific IgG may result in a false
positive reaction. The Serum Diluent Plus Solution diminishes competing virus-
specific IgG and minimizes rheumatoid factor interference in samples. Studies
indicate that the maximum amount of IgG which can be removed by the kit Serum
Diluent Plus is in excess of the expected high end of the normal range for IgG > 1380
mg/dL. The highest titer of RF+ tested (1: 1280; 500 IU/mL) did not adversely affect
the performance of the assay
f. Assay cut-off:
The objective of this study was to demonstrate the performance of the Trinity Biotech
Captia™ Measles IgM ELISA Test Kit; specifically to generate data to demonstrate
determination of the cut-off. The results are summarized below:
Measles IgM negative sera (228) were assayed on the Trinity Biotech Captia™
Measles IgM ELISA Test Kit. Four (4) samples were disqualified as they were in the
equivocal range on Trinity IgM ELISA or indeterminate on a comparator Measles
IFA test kit (due to non-specific staining most likely due to the presence of ANA
antibodies). The mean and standard deviation of the optical density readings for the
sera were 0.105 and 0.070 respectively. The positive threshold for the assay was
determined by adding the mean and 4 standard deviations (0.105 + 4(0.070) = 0.385).
Positive sera were titrated to give a constant ratio of the threshold value to obtain a
Cut-off Calibrator serum. On all subsequent assays, this serum was run and the assay
was calibrated by multiplying the O.D. value for the calibrator by the ratio to the cut-

Bilirubin (unconjugated)	≥20 mg/dL

--- Page 9 ---
off to obtain the cut-off calibrator value. This value was then divided into the O.D. for
the patient sera to obtain an Immune Status Ratio (ISR). By definition, the Cut-off
ISR is equal to 1.00. To account for inherent variation in the immunoassay, values of
0.91 to 1.09 were considered equivocal. Therefore values ≤ 0.90 are considered
negative and values ≥ 1.10 are considered positive.

Studies 1 and 2:
A total of 188 samples were collected from individuals for whom a measles IgM test
was ordered (suspected of measles infection in outbreak settings by the Texas
Department of Health, Austin, Texas (66 samples) and the State Laboratory of Public
Health in Raleigh, North Carolina (122 samples)). All serum samples were tested on
the Trinity Biotech Captia™ Measles IgM ELISA test kit. All but one (1) sample
was tested by a comparator testing algorithm used at each institution to determine the
presence of current or recent measles infection, referred to as “comparator algorithm”
in the performance tables. The algorithms used consisted of the results of other
laboratory confirmation methods including comparator Measles IgM ELISA test kit, a
comparator Measles IgM IFA test kit, Complement Fixation (CF), Hemagglutionation
Inhibition (HI) and the Trinity Biotech Captia™ Measles ELISA IgG test kit. See

Seroconversion study:
The BIOMEX Rubeola IgG and IgM Antibody Seroconversion Panel (Cat No. SCP-
MEA-001) contained 15 samples depicting the onset and decline of IgG and IgM
antibodies to Rubeloa (Measles) from one individual over a period of 55 days. The
IgM response was tested on four (4) different lots of the Trinity Biotech Captia™
Measles IgM ELISA Test Kit. The seroconversion panel consisted of one patient
with 15 draws during an approximately two month period from May 31st to July 25th,
1994. Seroconversion was demonstrated at Day 20 with the Trinity Biotech Captia™
Measles IgM ELISA Test Kit, and remained positive until Day 22. The first
comparator assay (comparator 1) demonstrated seroconversion at Day 22 and was
positive only at that bleed date. The second comparator assay (comparator 2)
seroconversion happened earlier than the Trinity kit by 2 days and remained positive
for the remainder of the timeframe. The results are summarized below:

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not Applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
IgM antibodies appear in the first week of infection and usually peak within a month.
Although uncommon, low levels of IgM may persist for one (1) year or longer. The
annual incidence rates are reported to vary in different geographical areas. Recent reports
(2004-2011) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that
annual measles incidence is <1 reported case per 1 million population. A large
proportion of cases (40%) are international imported or associated with importation.
Unknown source cases are not linked to any endemic chain (12%). Most imported cases
do not lead to spread in the United States. This is attributed to high levels of vaccination
coverage (CDC Report: Documentation and Verification of Measles, Rubella and
Congenital Rubella Syndrome Elimination in the Region of the Americas, United States
National Report, CDC, March 28, 2012).
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
