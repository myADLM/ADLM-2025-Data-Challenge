2

--- Page 3 ---
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and software,
sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells containing dried
reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for identification (ID) and antimicrobial
susceptibility testing (AST). The organism to be tested must be in pure culture and
preliminarily identified as Gram-positive or Gram-negative. Colonies are then suspended in
the ID broth, and, using one of the recommended BD nephelometer devices, brought to a
concentration of 0.5 McFarland. A further dilution is made into the AST broth. Prior to
inoculation of the panel, an AST broth indicator is added which changes the AST broth to a
blue color. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted formulation of Mueller-Hinton broth
containing 0.01% Tween 80, and has a final isolate concentration of approximately 5 x 105
CFU/mL. After inoculation and incubation, the AST broth indicator in the AST broth
changes from blue to pink to colorless as organism growth and reduction in the panel well
occurs. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated
Microbiology System instrument where the panels are incubated at 35°C and continuously
measured for changes to the indicator and bacterial turbidity to determine bacterial growth in
the presence of an antimicrobial agent. Organisms killed or inhibited by a given
antimicrobial do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do not produce a color
change. Additional interpretation is done using the software driven “EXPERT” System
triggered rules derived from the CLSI standards and/or FDA drug labeling.
Readings are taken every 20 minutes and a final AST result is available in 4 to16 hours. The
AST result is determined via automated readings; no manual readings are possible with this
system.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing using inocula prepared manually and using the BD Phoenix™
AP system using the PhoenixSpec nephelometer was conducted at three sites (one
internal and two external). Ten isolates with on-scale MIC values as predetermined
by reference methods were provided to the testing sites by BD. Isolate identification
and expected MIC result was blinded to those conducting the testing. Testing was
performed in triplicate on three separate days.
Reproducibility testing using inocula prepared by the Phoenix AP instrument was
conducted at two external sites and one internal site. Testing was conducted using 10
isolates with on-scale MIC values. Isolate identification and expected MIC result was
blinded to those conducting the testing. Testing was performed in triplicate on three
separate days.
Results of the inter-site and intra-site reproducibility studies were acceptable and
demonstrated best case and worst case results of greater than 95%. A summary of the
reproducibility study performance is illustrated in Table 2 below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The FDA and CLSI recommended quality control (QC) isolate, S. aureus ATCC
29213 was tested each day of the challenge and clinical study testing with the
reference method and with the BD Phoenix System. The inocula were standardized
using both the automated (Phoenix AP) and manual (PhoenixSpec) methods. A
sufficient number of tests were performed and all quality control results for the BD
Phoenix fell within the acceptable ranges demonstrating that the BD Phoenix System
can consistently produce quality control results in the recommended range for
Ceftaroline.
Quality control testing of the BD Phoenix – Ceftaroline was conducted to
demonstrate that acceptable results were achieved >95% of the time by both auto-
dilution and manual dilution inoculum preparation methods.

The quality control (QC) results with S. aureus ATCC 29213 were within the
expected range >95% of the time but an upward MIC trend of BD Phoenix was
observed compared to the reference method. For the manual dilution (the primary
method used in the clinical study) almost 99% of the QC reference MIC results are at
0.25µg/mL, while 72% of the BD Phoenix manual dilution QC results are at
0.5µg/mL. For the auto dilution: 98.7% of the QC reference MIC results are at
0.25µg/mL, while 43.4% of the BD Phoenix auto-dilution QC results are at 0.5µg/mL
Growth Failure Rate: The overall growth rate during the clinical studies was 99.7%;
this meets the acceptance criteria of ≤10% non-growth of organisms tested.
Purity Check Plates: Purity check plates were inoculated from the standardized
organism suspensions for both the Phoenix and reference methods. Any isolate that
showed mixed growth on the purity check plate was considered noncompliant and not
included in result analysis.
Inoculum Density Control: The BD PhoenixSpec™ Nephelometer was used to
prepare the inocula for testing of the clinical, challenge, reproducibility and QC

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The accuracy of results obtained with the Phoenix System was determined by
comparison to the CLSI-recommended broth dilution method (reference method).
Reference panels were prepared according to CLSI M07-A8 guidelines. Sites
performed testing on gram-positive isolates using Phoenix and reference panel
formats appropriate for gram positive organisms. Antimicrobial agents in the test and
reference panels had identical dilution ranges which were appropriate for the
interpretive breakpoints of the drug. Testing was performed using at least two
different production lots of Phoenix panels, AST broth and AST indicator at each
study site. A minimum of three different lots of the Phoenix panel were used across
all sites for the entire study. Phoenix and reference panels were inoculated using the
same organism suspension.
Growth in the Phoenix panels was determined from data recorded by the instrument.
Performance was analyzed using FDA breakpoints for Ceftaroline, and results were
compared to results obtained by the broth microdilution reference method based on
the guidelines provided in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document:
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems.
A total of 830 clinical isolates were tested at the three study sites and included both
fresh and stock isolates (413 MRSA, 405 MSSA and 12 S. aureus isolates for which
methicillin susceptibility or resistance was not characterized). Stock isolates
comprised 6.5% of total isolates tested. Clinical isolates tested included
representatives of species listed in the FDA approved pharmaceutical drug label.
Clinical isolates were tested using inocula prepared using the PhoenixSpec

--- Page 8 ---
nephelometer (manual method).
A challenge set of isolates were supplied to the testing sites by the sponsor.
Challenge isolates were obtained from BD’s internal collection and from external
laboratories. Results obtained for challenge isolates using the Phoenix System were
compared to expected MIC results; expected MIC values and categorical
interpretations were derived from testing with multiple lots of reference broth dilution
panels over a three-month period. The challenge set was divided into subsets and an
individual subset was distributed to each of the three study sites. Identification and
expected results were masked to the study sites. The inocula for the challenge
isolates were prepared using both the PhoenixSpec nephelometer (manual method)
and the Phoenix AP (automated method).
The performance evaluation summary of essential and categorical agreement results
for clinical, and challenge isolates with inocula prepared using the PhoenixSpec
nephelometer (manual method) is shown in the Tables 4 and 5 below.

Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the reference test panel
results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference method. Category agreement (CA) is
when the BD Phoenix™ panel result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result
interpretation. Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the BD Phoenix™ and the
reference and have on-scale EA.

*Data includes 12 isolates of S. aureus for which methicillin susceptibility or resistance was not characterized.
For the clinical and challenge organism testing performed for Ceftaroline using the
BD Phoenix, the overall % EA and % CA consistently met the acceptance criteria of
greater than or equal to 90%. Overall, there were no major or very major categorical
errors and a total of 16 minor errors. There was only one Ceftaroline intermediate
isolate (i.e. MRSA) tested in the challenge testing. This is insufficient to evaluate the
ability of the Phoenix to detect Ceftaroline non-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus.
The following limitation was included in the labeling (Limitations, Section 6.2
Package Insert for Phoenix GP Panels):
“The ability of the Phoenix System to detect nonsusceptibility in the following
combination(s) is unknown because a sufficient number of nonsusceptible strains
were not encountered at the time of comparative clinical testing: Ceftaroline-
Staphylococcus aureus”.
Using the data provided by the sponsor in the diagonal table format recommended in
the AST Guidance, an analysis was conducted to check for any trending in MIC
values. Of the 866 isolates tested, there were 857 on-scale MIC results. The data
demonstrated that there was a significant upward trending in the MIC of BD Phoenix
compared to the reference method. There were 29.5% (253/857) of the BD
Phoenix™-Ceftaroline results equal to the reference method, 65.1% (558/857) of the
BD Phoenix™-Ceftaroline were higher by one doubling dilution, and 5% (40/857)
were higher by two doubling dilutions; there was only 0.5% (4/857) BD Phoenix™-
Ceftaroline results that were one doubling dilution lower than the reference method.
The performance data demonstrated an upward trending (69.8%, 598/857) even
though within a good EA of 97.2%.
This significant trending and the potential for occurrence of major error(s) for
Ceftaroline when testing S. aureus particularly if this occurs with isolates with MIC
values around the breakpoint was addressed in labeling. The following footnote was
recommended to be included in the Performance Characteristics section of the
labeling:
“BD Phoenix MIC values tended to be higher by one dilution compared to
reference broth micro-dilution. Staphylococcus aureus with an interpretation of
‘resistant’ for ceftaroline is uncommon in most institutions or may result from
technical errors. Verify ID/AST if this phenotype has not been previously
encountered from this patient or institution”.
The overall growth rate for all species combined was 99.7%; this meets the
acceptance criteria of ≤ 10% non-growth of organisms tested.
