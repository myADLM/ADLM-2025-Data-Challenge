Guideline
L. Test Principle:
The EliA™ Scl-70S Wells are coated with human recombinant Scl-70 protein. If present in
the patient's specimen, antibodies to Scl-70 bind to their specific antigen. After washing
away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgA antibodies (EliA
IgG Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-
bound conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is incubated with a Development
Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured.
The higher the value of fluorescent signal detected by the instrument, the higher the amount
of antibody bound and detected in the sample tested. To evaluate test results, the response for
patient samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Seven serum samples selected from different parts of the claimed assay range were
tested on Phadia® 100 and Phadia® 250 instruments to establish intra- and inter-assay
precision. Each sample was run in 4 replicates for 7 days on 3 instruments. One batch
was used to determine the precision of the assays on Phadia® 100 (equal to 84
replicate determinations per sample). Three batches were used to determine the
precision of the assays on Phadia® 250 (equal to 252 replicate determinations per
sample). Results summarized below met %CV specifications for both intra-assay
(<10%) and inter-assay (<8%) imprecision.

The technical measuring range (detection limit, upper limit) for EliA Scl-70S is from
0.6 to ≥ 240 EliA U/mL. The upper limit of the reported results in EliA U/mL can
vary due to a lot-specific conversion from μg/L to EliA U/mL. Results above the
upper limit are reported as “above”. Linearity was shown for samples in the range
from 0.6 to 297.1 EliA U/mL. The labeling states that due to differing binding
characteristics of the antibodies in patient samples, not all sera can be diluted linearly
within the technical measuring range.
High dose hook effect: A hook effect was not observed when analyzing a high positive serum
sample with an estimated concentration more than 14 times above the upper limit of the technical
measuring range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i) Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability – The IgG calibrators are traceable (via unbroken chain of calibrations) to
the International Reference Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of Human Serum Immunoglobulins
A, G and M from the World Health Organization (WHO). New batches of IgG
calibrators are compared to a secondary standard (standardized with the IRP) or the IRP
directly and adjusted accordingly to meet the correct concentration.
There is no international standard for IgG antibodies directed to Scl-70S. The instrument
measures specific IgG concentration in μg/L which is automatically converted to EliA
U/mL by using a lot-specific conversion factor given by the bar code printed on the
EliA™ Scl-70S Well package and read by the instrument during reagent loading.
Calibrators – The calibrators are human serum in standard buffer. There are 6 levels with
assigned values from 0-600 µg/mL. The calibrator curve is acquired by fitting the values
of the 6 calibrators and can be stored for up to 28 days by the instrument to be used on
additional assays. Each EliA™ Scl-70S assay includes calibrator (curve) controls that
have to recover in defined ranges to ensure that the stored calibration curve is still valid.
Controls – The EliA™ ANA Positive Control and EliA™ IgG/IgM/IgA Negative Control
were cleared under k072393 and k091845, respectively. EliA ANA Positive Control is
prepared from selected pooled human sera and contains IgG antibodies to dsDNA, RNP,

Sm, Ro, La, Scl-70, CENP and Jo-1. EliA IgG/IgM/IgA Negative Control is prepared
from selected pooled sera from normal, healthy donors. The controls are prediluted and
ready for use. Each EliA™ Control package contains a Control Certificate listing
predefined acceptance criteria for the EliA™ products the Controls can be used with.
The target ranges of the EliA™ Controls tested with the EliA Scl-70 assay on the two
Phadia® instruments are summarized below:
Instrument EliA™ ANA Positive Control
Phadia® 100 86.4 – 201.7 EliA U/mL
Phadia® 250 78.6 – 183.4 EliA U/mL
Instrument EliA™ IgG/IgM/IgA Negative Control
Phadia® 100 < 6 EliA U/mL
Phadia® 250 < 6EliA U/mL
ii) Kit Stability:
Shelf-life stability – An accelerated stability study set the shelf-life stability of the EliA™
Scl-70S Wells (from the date of manufacture when stored at recommended temperature 2-
8°C) at 24 months. A real-time stability study is underway and currently supports a 7-
month stability claim. All studies were performed on three lots of EliA Scl-70S Wells.
Other required components (previously reviewed) of the test method have a shelf life of
18 - 24 months. The sponsor notes that it is important to store the wells in dry conditions
at 2-8°C.
Open stability – An accelerated study set the stability of the foil bag containing the
EliA™ Scl-70S Wells after first opening at 9 months at 2-8°C. A real-time stability study
supported the 9-month stability claim. The stability after first opening study for EliA™
IgG Calibrators and EliA™ IgG Curve Control are not required as they are for single use
only.
On-board stability – The on-board stability of the EliA™ Scl-70S Wells packed in carrier
storage tray without desiccant bag was tested only on the Phadia® 250 instrument since
for Phadia® 100 instrument the reagents are stored outside the instrument and are only
loaded as needed for an assay. The EliA™ Scl-70S Wells can be stored open at 2-8ºC for
up to 28 days.
iii) Sample Storage:
The package insert recommends following the guidelines in CLSI H18-A3 for sample
storage. Separated serum/plasma should remain at room temperature for no longer than
eight hours. If assays are not completed within eight hours, serum/plasma should be
refrigerated (2- 8°C). If assays are not completed within 48 hours, or the separated
serum/plasma will be stored beyond 48 hours, serum/plasma should be frozen at or below
-20°C. Freezing and thawing should be avoided.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were
determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A. On each Phadia instrument (Phadia® 100 and
Phadia® 250), a blank sample (for LoB) and five low antibody samples (for LoD and LoQ)
were assayed in 12 replicates in each of six runs on different days, three runs in two

e. Analytical specificity:
i) Endogenous Interference:
Interferences were assessed by testing five samples (two negative samples, two samples
within the equivocal range and a low positive sample). Each sample was spiked with the
interfering substances or substance-specific blanks, and analyzed in two runs, three
replicates each (n=6), on one lot of EliA™ Scl-70S Well and one lot of system reagents.
The data demonstrated that EliA™ Scl-70S was not adversely affected (percent recovery
ranged from 91 to 100%) by the following substances up to the concentrations listed in
the table below:
Potential Interfering Compound Test Concentration
Bilirubin F 19.2 mg/dL
Bilirubin C 20.1 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 496 mg/dL
Lipemic factor 1%
Rheumatoid factor 500 IU/mL
The package insert contains a caution not to use hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
ii) Cross-reactivity:
Cross reactivity was investigated using international reference sera from AMLI
(Association of Medical Laboratory Immunologists) and CDC samples (Center of
Disease Control and Prevention). Each sample was assayed in duplicates using one batch
of EliA™ Scl-70S Wells and one batch of system reagents. The 10 AMLI samples
including the AMLI sample 6 which is defined as Scl-70 specific by AMLI were all
negative. The sponsor stated that this sample has never shown any reactivity for Scl-70
on Varelisa Scl-70, VarelisA ReCombi ANA Profile, and INOVA QuantaLite ANA.
One of the 12 CDC samples contains Scl-70-specific antibodies and was found positive
on EliA™ Scl-70S.
f. Assay cut-off:
Based on the results of the expected values/reference range study described below in Section
M.5, the 99th percentile lies below the upper limit of the equivocal range for EliA™ Scl-70S.
The assay cutoffs were set as follows:

In case of equivocal results, it is recommended to retest the patient after 8-12 weeks.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
For analysis of agreement with a predicate device, a total of 336 clinically defined serum
samples were collected from the serum bank at Phadia GmbH and assayed in singleton on
both QuantaLite™ Scl-70 ELISA and EliA™ Scl-70S. The clinically defined samples were
from patients diagnosed with Scleroderma (n = 101), limited cutaneous form of systemic
sclerosis (n = 33), mixed connective tissue disease (n = 37), Systemic lupus erythematosus (n
= 34), Sjögren’s syndrome (n = 26), Poly/Dermatomyositis (n = 5), Rheumatoid arthritis (n =
30), various cancers (n = 20), various bacterial infections (n = 24) and various viral infections
(n = 26). In addition, 54 samples with known anti-EliA Scl-70S reactivity but without
clinical diagnosis were added to the analysis. Of the 390 sera tested, 16 results were
excluded as being outside of the measuring range of the EliA™ Scl-70S assay and the
predicate. The results are summarized below:

Agreements were calculated by grouping EliA™ Scl-70S equivocal results with its test
negative results, and then agreements were calculated again by grouping EliA™ Scl-70S
equivocal results with the test positive results:

b. Matrix comparison:
A study was performed to demonstrate that heparin plasma and EDTA plasma matrices yield
comparable values as serum in the EliA™ Scl-70S immunoassay. A total of 52 matrix-
matched samples spread across the reportable range were assayed once on the Phadia® 250
instrument. Negative samples did not switch to positive in any serum/plasma combination. A
Passing & Bablok analysis was performed and the results are depicted in the following table:

c. Instrument comparison:
A study was performed to demonstrate that the performance of EliA™ Scl-70S was
equivalent on the Phadia® 100 and Phadia® 250 instruments. A total of 36 samples
(24 positive, 8 equivocal and 4 negative) spanning the assay range were analyzed in 6
runs in single replicates on 3 Phadia®100 and 3 Phadia® 250 instruments, with 2 runs
on each instrument. The results from Phadia®100 instrument # 1 were compared to
the results from Phadia® 250 instrument # 1, and so on for the other two instrument
pairs. The results of a Weighted Deming regression analyses performed on each pair
are shown below:

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical sensitivity and specificity:
The performance of EliA™ Scl-70S was compared to a clinical diagnosis of
Scleroderma. A total of 101 samples from individuals diagnosed with the diffuse
form of scleroderma, 33 samples from individuals with CREST and 202 samples from
individuals with other disease conditions were tested on the Phadia® 250 instrument.

CREST syndrome is the limited cutaneous form of systemic sclerosis associated with
antibodies against centromeres. At the beginning of the disease, a differentiation
between the limited and the diffuse cutaneous form is difficult, and patients may be
incorrectly classified. The clinical performance evaluation was performed first
without, and then with, the 33 samples with CREST diagnosis. In both evaluations,
the clinical sensitivity and specificity were calculated by grouping the assay’s
equivocal results with its test negative results, and then sensitivity and specificity were
calculated again by grouping the assay’s equivocal results with its test positive results.
Clinical performance evaluation that includes the 33 samples with CREST diagnosis
and that considers the equivocal samples as negative is summarized in the following
