2. Indication(s) for use:
Healgen THC One Step Marijuana Test
Healgen One Step Marijuana Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative
determination of 11-nor-Δ9-THC-9-COOH in human urine at a cut-off concentration of
50 ng/mL. The test is available in a Strip format, a Cassette format, a Dip Card format
and a Cup format.
The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should
be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is
positive.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. It is intended for over-the-counter and for prescription
use.
Healgen mAMP One Step Methamphetamine Test
Healgen One Step Methamphetamine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the
qualitative determination of methamphetamine in human urine at a cut-off concentration
of 1000 ng/mL. The test is available in a Strip format, a Cassette format, a Dip Card
format and a Cup format.
The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should
be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is
positive.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. It is intended for over-the-counter and for prescription
use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For over the counter (OTC) and prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable. The device is a visually read single-use device.
I. Device Description:
The Healgen THC One Step Marijuana Test and Healgen mAMP One Step
Methamphetamine Test come in four formats: Strip, Cassette, Cup, and Dip Card. The
Healgen tests use a lateral flow, one step system for the qualitative detection of 11-nor-Δ9-
THC-9-COOH and Methamphetamine in human urine.

L. Test Principle:
The devices are rapid tests for the qualitative detection of marijuana and methamphetamine
in urine samples. When the absorbent end of the device is immersed into a urine sample, the
urine is absorbed into the device by capillary action and mixes with the antibody-dye
conjugate, flowing across the pre-coated membrane. At analyte concentrations below the

target cut off, antibody-dye conjugates bind to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the
Test Region (T) of the device. This produces a colored test line that indicates a negative
result. When the analyte concentration is above the cutoff, analyte molecules bind to the
antibody-dye conjugate, preventing the antibody-dye conjugate from binding to the drug-
protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. When the sample
contains target drug above the cutoff concentration no colored band shows in the test region,
indicating a preliminary positive result. A control line (C line) is also part of each device.
The C line is coated with anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody and serves as an internal
quality control of the system. The C line appears as a red-colored band during the test
regardless of the presence of the drug.

Precision of the Healgen THC One step Marijuana and Healgen mAMP One Step
Methamphetamine tests were tested with 3 lots for each format (Strip, Cassette, Cup,
Dip Card) of the device by three operators. This consisted of analyzing samples in 2
runs per day for 25 days (N=50 per lot) and by spiking drug free urine samples to
achieve 100% cut off, -75% cut off, -50% cut off, -25% cut off, +25% cut off, +50%
cut off , +75% cut off and +100% cut off drug concentrations. Each drug
concentration was confirmed by GC/MS. Results are summarized below for each lot
and device.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
External control materials are not supplied with the devices; however, the package
insert lists a phone number the users can call to determine the commercial controls
that are compatible for use with this device.
Stability protocols and acceptance criteria of all test formats were reviewed and
deemed acceptable. The stability information supports the claimed shelf life of 24
months at 4 to 30 ºC. The information also supports that the devices are stable for 35
days when exposed to extreme transport temperatures of -20 ºC and 40 ºC.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable. The assay is intended for qualitative use.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was evaluated by spiking various concentrations of similarly
structured drug compounds into drug-free urine. Results are expressed as a minimum
concentration of metabolite or compound required to produce a response
approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay. The percent cross-

Interference studies:
Interference studies were performed using 100 μg/mL of commonly administered or
OTC compounds (endogenous compounds, drugs, drug metabolites) that are
commonly found in urine. These compounds were tested in drug-free urine controls
and urine containing ±25% cutoff concentration for each analyte using three lots of
each device for all formats. The following compounds were found not to interfere
when tested at 100 μg/mL concentration.

Specific Gravity and pH studies:
Twelve urine samples with specific gravity ranges (1.000-1.035) were collected and
spiked with each drug at 25% below and 25% above cutoff levels. Each sample was
tested using three lots of each format of the test devices. The results showed that a
specific gravity range of 1.000 to 1.035 does not affect the accuracy of the test
A negative urine pool was adjusted to a pH range of 4.00 to 9.00 in 1 pH unit
increments and was spiked with each drug at 25% below and 25% above cutoff
levels. Samples were tested using three lots of each format of the devices, and results
showed that urine pH range of 4.00 to 9.00 does not affect the accuracy of the
accuracy of the test.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cutoff characterization study was performed using the Healgen THC One
Step Marijuana Test and the Healgen mAMP One Step Methamphetamine Test with 3
lots for each format (Cup, Dip Card, Cassette, and Strip format) by three operators.
The study samples were made by using spiking drug-free urine samples (confirmed
by GC/MS) with known amount of THC or Methamphetamine. Results are shown in
the tables below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison for the Healgen THC One Step Marijuana Test and the
Healgen mAMP One Step Methamphetamine Test was performed internally against
the reference method, GC/MS. Operators ran 80 unaltered urine samples on each
format of the devices, where each device format was tested by an independent set of
three operators. The samples were masked and randomized prior to testing and device
results were compared to GC/MS. The results are presented in the table below:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
A lay user study was performed at three sites with a total of 560 lay persons where
140 persons tested one of the four formats (Strip, Cassette, Dip Card, Cup) of the
Healgen THC One Step Marijuana Test and the Healgen mAMP One Step
Methamphetamine Test. The participants had diverse educational and professional
backgrounds and ranged in age from 21 to >50. Urine samples were prepared at the
following concentrations; negative, ±75%, ±50%, ±25% of the cutoff by spiking drug
into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were
confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers, blind-
labeled, and randomized prior to testing. Each participant was provided with the
package insert, one masked sample and a device. The results are summarized below.

The labeling is rated at 7th grade reading level per Flesch-Kincaid Methodology. All
participants (100%) indicated on the questionnaire that the labeling instructions were
clear and that they did not find the tests difficult to operate.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Not applicable
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
