L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on chemiluminescence technology. Samples are subjected to a pre-
treatment step to denature the Vitamin D Binding Protein (VDBP). The treated samples are
then neutralized in assay buffer and a specific anti-25-OHD antibody labelled with
acridinium is added. Following an incubation step, magnetic particles linked to 25-OHD are
added. Following a further incubation step, the magnetic particles are “captured” using a
magnet. After a washing step and addition of trigger reagents, the light emitted by the
acridinium label is inversely proportional to the concentration of 25-OHD in the original
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP5 A2 where six (6) serum
samples (ranging from 12.0 ng/mL to 116.5 ng/mL) were assayed using three (3) lots
of reagents in duplicate (n=2), twice per day for 20 days on three (3) analyzers. Each
analyzer/reagent lot produced similar precision results. The within-run and total
precision results are summarized in the table below using one representative lot of
reagents:
Within-run Total
n Mean SD CV% SD CV%
(ng/mL)
Serum1 80 13.2 0.8 6.4 1.4 10.6
Serum 2 80 27.2 1.5 5.4 2.5 9.0
Serum 3 80 38.9 2.3 5.8 3.5 9.1

Serum 5 80 77.2 4.0 5.2 6.6 8.5
Serum 6 80 119.9 6.1 5.1 8.6 7.2
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated based on CLSI EP-6A, Evaluation of the Linearity of
Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach. Samples were
prepared by diluting a serum sample with a high 25-OH vitamin D concentration with
a serum sample with a low 25-OH vitamin D concentration to obtain eleven (11)
concentration levels across the measuring range. Samples were run in duplicate, using

one reagent lot with sample range tested between 5.8 to 152.9 ng/mL. The linear
regression of the observed mean concentrations versus the expected concentration
was calculated.
The resulting linear regression equation was y = 0.96x+ 2.1 ng/mL, R2 = 1.00
The results of the linearity study support the sponsor’s claim that the assay is linear
from 7-125 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Standardization and Traceability
The IDS-iSYS 25-Hydroxy Vitamin DS Assay was originally cleared under 510(k)
k091849. IDS has modified the assay by standardizing the cleared vitamin D assay in
accordance with the Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP). The VDSP is an
international collaborative effort to standardize the laboratory measurement of serum
25-OH vitamin D This collaboration involves the coordinated efforts of the National
Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes for Standards and Technology
(NIST), Ghent University, and other institutions. Please refer to
http://ods.od.nih.gov/Research/VitaminD.aspx for more information on the VDSP
program.
To achieve standardization against the VDSP recognized Reference Measurement
Procedure (RMP), the IDS-iSYS 25-Hydroxy Vitamin DS assay master calibration
parameters were aligned to the CDC VDSP by using 70 human serum samples from
the CDC VSDP program which were value assigned by the RMP and traceable to
NIST SRM2972.
Calibrator traceability and value assignment
This assay is traceable to the isotope dilution-liquid chromatography/tandem mass
spectrometry (ID-LC-/MS/MS) 25-OH Vitamin D Reference Method Procedure (RMP)
that is traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard
Reference Material (SRM) 2972. The calibrator traceability and value assignment are
prepared according to an internal procedure.
Kit calibrators are lot specific for each assay kit. Master calibrators and kit calibrators A
and B are prepared gravimetrically from the stock solution or an intermediate stock
solution. For value assignment, the kit calibrators are tested as unknowns in a minimum
of 20 assay runs using one analyzer. Each run is calibrated using master calibrators. The
values are then adjusted to ensure batch-to-batch consistency where necessary. The final
assigned values obtained for the kit calibrators are verified on three additional analyzers.
The values must fall within specified acceptable ranges. The calibrator target values are
listed below:
Calibrator A target value: 5.5 ng/mL
Calibrator B target value: 64.5 ng/mL
8

--- Page 9 ---
The IDS-iSYS 25-Hydroxy Vitamin DS assay (candidate device) has passed the
certification process for the CDC VDSP and a certificate has been provided by the
CDC. Please see, http://www.cdc.gov/labstandards/hs.html for more information on
the CDC VDSP certification program.
Stability
The calibrator and control shelf-life and open-vial stability testing protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be adequate. Once opened, calibrators
and controls are stable for up to 2.5 hours on board the analyzer. Current accelerated
shelf life studies support the assigned six-month shelf life, with real-time studies on-
going.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification (LoQ)
studies were performed according to CLSI EP-17A.
To establish the Limit of Blank (LoB), the zero calibrator was assayed in replicates of 10
on 10 separate days giving a total of 100 measurements. The Limit of Blank was
determined by calculating the concentration corresponding to the mean zero calibrator
minus two standard deviations from the calibration curve. The LoB claim is 0.6ng/mL.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) study was performed by assaying 10 samples (native
and/or diluted) with very low vitamin D concentrations (ranging from 1.9ng/mL to
8.0ng/mL) in duplicate in 12 runs spanning multiple days giving a total of 240 data
points. The LoD claim is 2.6 ng/mL.
The Limit of Quantification (LoQ) was determined by measuring 13 low samples (native
and /or diluted) in a concentration range of 2.8 – 24.6ng/mL in duplicate over 7
individual runs spanning multiple days giving a total of 182 data points. The LoQ claim
is 7.0ng/mL and was calculated by interpolating the concentration of the analyte from the
regression curve at 20% precision CV.
Detection limits results:
Limit of Blank Limit of Detection Limit of Quantitation
0.6 ng/mL 2.6 ng/mL 7.0 ng/mL
The reportable range of the assay is 7-125 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
An endogenous interference study was performed based on CLSI EP7-A2 guideline
to assess common or known substances that could interfere with IDS-iSYS 25-

Hydroxy Vitamin DS assay. The potential interferents listed below were spiked into
human serum samples with different levels of 25-OH vitamin D. Each sample was
tested in replicates of 26. The 25-OH vitamin D values of the spiked samples were
compared to the reference samples containing no interferent. Significant interference
was defined as greater or equal to ±10% difference from the expected concentration.
The interference study results are summarized in the following table:
Potential Interferent Sample 25OHD Highest Tested
concentration Concentration at which no
(ng/mL) significant interference
(≤10%) was observed
Bilirubin, conjugated 18.0 and 65.7 30 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 19.2 and 71.7 40 mg/dL
Triglycerides 50.0 and 87.9 500 mg/dL
Red blood cells 15.5 and 65.8 0.2%
Biotin 17.0 and 66.2 300 nmol/L
HAMA 18.2 and 72.8 500 ng/mL
Vitamin D binding 18.9 and 76.0 2000 ng/mL
protein
The package insert contains the following limitation: The presence of hemoglobin at
concentrations >40 mg/dL might lead to falsely depressed values. Do not use
hemolyzed samples.
Rheumatoid Factor: Interference from rheumatoid factor (RF) was assessed using a
recovery study. Serum samples containing 18.7 ng/mL and 21.4 ng/mL of 25OHD
were spiked with1500 IU/mL of RF and tested in replicates of 4. The results were
compared to results from samples not containing RF. Non-significant interference is
defined as a recovery of between 90-110%. The highest tested concentration of RF
at which no significant interference was observed was 1500 IU/mL.
Cross reactivity studies:
To evaluate the cross reactivity potential of substances with a similar chemical structure
as 25(OH) vitamin D, two separate studies were performed. Literature describes
problems with assessing % cross reactivity using exogenous spiked samples due to the
hydrophobic nature of vitamin D molecules and changes in sample matrix with addition
of organic solvents which may not reflect the actual % recovery of the endogenous 25-
OH Vitamin D2 and D3 isoforms in the tested sample. Therefore, the % cross reactivity
of the 25-OH Vitamin D2 and D3, and 24, 25 (OH) D3 isoforms were tested mimicking
2
endogenous conditions by adding endogenous 25(OH) vitamin D metabolite to serum
samples. Endogenous 25(OH) vitamin D metabolites were spiked into vitamin D
serum samples and analyzed with the IDS-iSYS 25-Hydroxy Vitamin DS assay. The
concentration of un-spiked sample and spike concentration were determined by a LC-
MS/MS 25(OH)D method. The spiked sample was measured with the IDS-iSYS 25-

Due to the naturally low concentrations which exist endogenously, the other vitamin
D metabolites are not expected to cause clinically significant cross-reactivity with the
assay. Therefore, exogenous spiking was used to test the cross-reactivity of the
vitamin D metabolites listed below. Exogenous synthetic 25(OH) vitamin D
metabolites were spiked into vitamin D serum samples. The un-spiked and spiked
samples were measured with the IDS-iSYS 25- Hydroxy Vitamin Ds assay. The %

Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed to produce a summary of results for
each study, as shown below.
Passing Bablok y= 0.96x + 1.1
Slope, 95% Confidence Interval 0.91 to 1.01
Intercept, 95% Confidence Interval -0.3 to 2.3 ng/mL
Correlation Coefficient, r 0.94
n 283
Range tested 7.3-115.1 ng/mL
An additional method comparison study was performed to demonstrate the accuracy
of the newly aligned IDS-iSYS 25 Hydroxy Vitamin Ds assay. With the aligned assay
master calibration parameters, 99 independent samples value assigned by ID-LC-MS/MS
RMP (9.0 ng/ml to 98.6 ng/mL), were used to assess the IDS-iSYS 25 Hydroxy Vitamin
Ds assay traceability against the ID-LC-MS/MS RMP. The test result range on the
candidate device was 10.5 to 96.1 ng/mL. The correlation between the IDS-iSYS (y) and
the ID-LC-MS/MS RMP (x) is described using Passing-Bablok regression & Deming
regression:
Passing Bablok regression:
IDS-iSYS = 0.95 x (ID-LC-MS/MS RMP) +0.8ng/mL
95 % CI of the slope: 0.86to 1.04
95 % CI of the intercept: -1.32 to 3.08ng/mL
Deming regression:
IDS-iSYS = 0.94x (ID-LC-MS/MS RMP) +1.34ng/mL
95 % CI of the slope: 0.86 to 1.01
95 % CI of the intercept: -0.78 to 3.45ng/mL

5. Expected values/Reference range:
An expected values study was performed according to the non-parametric method in
CLSI C28-A2 guideline. Samples from 275 apparently healthy light skin and dark skin
male (71.6%) and female (28.4%) adults , aged 21-77 years, living in geographical
diverse regions of the United States to represent a broad spectrum of UV light exposure
in the intended use population, were collected. The samples were tested for 25-OH
vitamin D concentrations using the IDS-iSYS 25-Hydroxy Vitamin DS Assay. The 95%
reference interval was calculated by a non-parametric method following C28-A2. The
following range was obtained:
Normal Adults: 12.7 – 64.2 ng/mL (n=275)
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
