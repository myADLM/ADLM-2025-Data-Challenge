K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle:
Methicillin resistance in S. aureus is most commonly associated with the expression of
the mecA gene that encodes a unique penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a) with low affinity
for methicillin. The mecA XpressFISH® assay uses fluorescein-labeled Peptide Nucleic Acid
(PNA) probes to hybridize to mecA mRNA sequences on smears from blood cultures
containing S. aureus. Routine clinical blood cultures that have been signaled as positive on
an automated blood culture instrument are initially characterized by Gram stain. Those
exhibiting Gram-positive cocci in clusters are tested using the Staphylococcus QuickFISH™
BC assay (K113371) to confirm the presence of a pure culture of S. aureus. Once this has
been established, an aliquot of the blood culture is incubated in Trypticase Soy Broth
containing cefoxitin to induce the expression of mecA mRNA.
Cefoxitin resistance has been established by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
as the preferred method for detection of methicillin resistance conferred by the mecA gene in
S. aureus. In the mecA XpressFISH® assay, the cefoxitin does not function to establish or
measure the methicillin susceptibility of the S. aureus; rather, the induction step activates the
expression of the mecA gene thereby increasing the amount of available mRNA targets for
detection in the assay. An aliquot of the induced sample is mixed with a fixation solution and
heat fixed onto a glass slide. Fixation is followed by hybridization with a cocktail of
fluorescent PNA probes, then a stringent wash to remove unbound probes. Finally, the slide
is mounted with mounting medium and a glass coverslip for examination by fluorescence
microscopy. mecA-positive cells exhibit green fluorescence through the specific binding of
the fluorophore-labeled PNAs to mecA mRNA. mecA-negative cells appear as non-
fluorescent cocci in clusters.
Each sample slide contains separate positive and negative controls in small wells adjacent to
the sample well. The controls are provided pre-fixed to the slide and monitor the procedural
steps of the assay following cefoxitin induction and slide fixation. The control wells are
oriented such that they can be processed together under a second coverslip. The

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Overall Reproducibility
Two Reproducibility Studies were performed to evaluate overall site-to-site and operator-
to-operator and lot-to-lot reproducibility of the mecA XpressFISH® assay. For the first
study, contrived blood cultures of two strains of MRSA and one strain of MSSA were
prepared using the BacT/ALERT 3D automated blood culture system. Aliquots of each
culture were coded and distributed to each of the 3 study sites and tested over 5 days by
two operators at each site. There was 100% concordance with expected results except for
Day 2 at one site on which one operator had 6 false-positive results (Positive Percent
Agreement: 100% [360/360]; Negative Percent Agreement: 96.6% [171/177]). A
definitive root cause for these failures could not be established and therefore a second
Reproducibility Study was conducted with additional control measures in place to
safeguard the integrity of study results that included examination of the Internal Positive
and Negative Controls on each slide as well as daily testing of Positive and Negative
External Controls by each operator.
For the second Reproducibility Study contrived blood cultures were also prepared using
the BacT/ALERT 3D automated blood culture device. Two strains of MRSA and one of
MSSA were each used to inoculate aerobic bottles containing sterile whole human blood.
In order to simulate testing of clinical samples, the bottles were incubated in the
BacT/ALERT device for different durations. One set was harvested after about 12 hours
of incubation (“bottle ring”) and the other set was harvested after about 20 hours of
incubation (bottle ring plus 8 hours). At inoculation, and again upon harvest, quantitative
plating was used to determine the titer of each of the cultures. Aliquots of each culture
were coded A-F, randomized for each day of testing, and distributed to the study sites.
Details of the Reproducibility Panel are presented below in Table 1.

Testing was performed over five days at two external sites and internally at AdvanDx
using two different lots of mecA XpressFISH® slides and cefoxitin swabs, three lots of
External Controls, and blinded Reproducibility Panel samples. At each site, two operators
each performed duplicate tests with each panel member on each of the five days of the
study (3 sites X 2 operators X 5 days). Ten test results were obtained by each operator at
each study site for a cumulative total of 30 replicates per panel member.
Because the mecA XpressFISH® assay requires visual observation and interpretation of
the test results, operators with different levels of experience were included in the study.
Testing was conducted by two operators at each site. At the external sites, one operator
was experienced (Operator 1) and the other operator was trained, but inexperienced with
the mecA XpressFISH® assay (Operator 2). Both operators at AdvanDx were
experienced.
On Day 4, Operator 2 at Site 3 found the Internal Positive Control on the slide for the
External Positive Control to be negative. This observation was confirmed by Operator 1.
The root cause of this error could not be confirmed and but was likely due to either a
manufacturing defect or operator error. The External Control and associated panel
members were retested and the expected results were obtained.
In total, 248 mecA XpressFISH® tests were performed, including the repeat testing of the
8 samples that was required at Site 3 due to failure of the Internal Positive Control with
an External Positive Control sample. As shown in Table 2, 247/248 (99.6%) Internal
Positive Controls produced the expected result as did all the Internal Negative Controls
(248/248; 100%). All the External Controls (60/60; 100%) and all the reproducibility
panel members (180/180; 100%) also produced the expected results. There were no
differences in performance by site, operator or reagent lot.

Cefoxitin Induction Reproducibility Study
An additional study was conducted to evaluate the reproducibility of the cefoxitin
induction step. Testing was performed on 25 strains of MRSA (Table 3). Contrived
blood cultures were prepared at AdvanDx using the BacT/ALERT 3D automated blood
culture instrument by inoculating each strain into culture medium containing blood. The
bottles were allowed to incubate until bottle ring (growth periods ranged from 11h 46 min
to 22h 15min), after which each blood culture was divided into aliquots that were stored
at 2-8°C until shipment to the test sites.

Prior to being sent to the testing laboratories, the morphology of each organism was
confirmed as Gram Positive Cocci in Clusters (GPCC) and all 25 strains were also
confirmed as S. aureus by Staphylococcus QuickFISH™ BC.
The study was performed with two different lots of mecA XpressFISH® slides, two lots of
cefoxitin swabs on Day 1 and one lot of swabs with no cefoxitin (denoted as “MOCK”)
on Day 2, and one lot of External Controls. All operators were blinded as to the identity
of the panel members which were tested over two days at two external sites and internally
at AdvanDx.
There were two operators at each site. At the two external sites, one operator was
experienced (Operator 1) and the other operator was trained, but inexperienced with the
mecA XpressFISH® assay (Operator 2). Both operators at AdvanDx were experienced.
The results of the study are summarized in Table 4. All the operators at each of the three
sites obtained 100% (25/25) agreement with expected results on Day 1 when testing was
performed with swabs containing cefoxitin. On Day 2 when testing was performed with
“MOCK” swabs without cefoxitin, there was variation in percent agreement between
operators and sites. Of the 25 samples tested without cefoxitin induction, a total of seven
(7) samples were scored as negative. For both operators combined at each site the overall
agreement with expected results was 48/50 (96.0%; 95% CI 86.5-98.9%) at Site 1, 50/50
(100%; 95% CI: 92.9-100%) at Site 2 and 45/50 (90.0%; 95% CI 78.6-95.7%) at Site 3.
All Internal and External Positive and Negative Controls that were tested during the
course of the study produced the expected results.
The results of the study confirm that the cefoxitin induction step, performed as instructed
in the mecA XpressFISH® Package Insert, is necessary to ensure the reproducibility of
assay performance.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Internal Controls
Each mecA Control Slide for use with the mecA XpressFISH® assay contains separate
Internal Positive and Negative Controls in small wells adjacent to the sample well. The
controls comprise well-characterized organisms that are grown, killed, deposited and
fixed within the control wells to aid in result interpretation. The positive well contains
methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the negative control well
contains methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The hybridization, wash
and mounting steps are performed on the control wells in the same manner as for the
sample well.
Quality control with the mecA Control Slides must be performed each time testing is
performed. After processing, the Positive Control well should display multiple
fluorescent green cocci in clusters. The Negative Control well should not contain
fluorescent green cells. If the Positive and Negative Controls do not perform accordingly,
results for the test sample are considered invalid and the patient result should not be
reported.
Because the Positive and Negative Internal Controls are not exposed to the cefoxitin
induction process they do not monitor this step of the assay procedure. This is indicated
as a Limitation in the Package insert. The cefoxitin induction process can only be
monitored through testing of appropriate Positive and Negative External Controls.

External Controls
A recommended procedure for preparation of External Positive and Negative Controls
based on culture of commercially available strains of MRSA and MSSA is provided in
the Package Insert. The ability of External Controls that were prepared according to the
recommended procedure to monitor the performance of the mecA XpressFISH® assay
was evaluated under four different failure modes (Table 5).
Table 5. Potential Failure Modes Evaluated with External Controls
Process Step Nominal Condition Failure Mode
mRNA induction Induction with cefoxitin Omission of cefoxitin induction
Hybridization With mecA PNA probe No mecA PNA probe
Wash Temperature 57±1°C 25°C
Wash Duration 10-20 min 1 min
Under each of the potential failure modes tested either the Positive or the Negative
External Control was shown to fail, confirming that External Controls prepared in the
manner described in the Package Insert are appropriate to monitor for substantial
deviations from the prescribed mecA XpressFISH® test procedure. As noted in the
Package Insert, the Positive and Negative Internal Controls are designed to monitor steps
in the assay workflow downstream of the cefoxitin induction process.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LOD) of the mecA XpressFISH® assay was determined using 3
strains of MRSA that were grown under simulated conditions of blood culture and
serially diluted in half-log increments in a blood culture matrix. Four replicates of each
dilution were initially tested to obtain a preliminary estimate of the LOD (i.e., the lowest
level detected reproducibly with both the Staphylococcus QuickFISH™ BC and mecA
XpressFISH® assays). Colony counts were performed to determine the target levels
tested.
The LOD or each strain was confirmed by testing an additional 20 replicates at the
estimated LOD target level (Table 6). Across the three strains of MRSA tested, the LOD
of the mecA XpressFISH® assay was estimated to be approximately 105 CFU/mL, which
is also consistent with the claimed analytical sensitivity of the Staphylococcus
QuickFISH™ BC assay.

e. Analytical reactivity:
The analytical reactivity of the mecA XpressFISH® assay was assessed using a panel of
64 strains of MRSA representing different genotypes, clonal complexes and both
geographic and temporal diversity. Testing was performed on cultures grown under
simulated conditions of blood culture. Details of the strains and levels tested are shown in
Table 7. All the strains produced positive results with Staphylococcus QuickFISH™ BC
and, as expected, the S. aureus mecC variant LGA251 was the only strain not to yield a
positive result with the mecA XpressFISH® assay. The inability of the mecA XpressFISH®
assay to detect methicillin resistance conferred by mechanisms other than the presence of
the mecA gene is reflected as a Limitation in the Package Insert.
Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations for cefoxitin were determined for 20 strains of
MRSA, 6 strains of MSSA, 5 strains of BORSA (Borderline Oxacillin Resistant S.
aureus) and 2 strains of S. epidermidis. MICs were determined by the Macrodilution
(Tube) Broth Method and breakpoints were interpreted according to Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M100-S24 (24th edition, 2014) (i.e., cefoxitin MIC
≤4µg/mL: susceptible; ≥8µg/mL: resistant). The results from testing these strains with the
mecA XpressFISH® assay are summarized in Table 8. These data demonstrate the ability
of the mecA XpressFISH® assay to detect strains of MRSA with a range of different MIC
values. As expected the mecC variant MRSA strain tested negative, as did all 5 strains of
BORSA. One strain of MSSA that is mecA positive produced a mecA XpressFISH®
positive result.

f. Analytical specificity:
Cross-Reactivity Study
The analytical specificity of the mecA XpressFISH® assay was evaluated in a Cross-
Reactivity Study by testing 30 strains of MSSA (including 5 strains of BORSA), 40
coagulase negative strains of staphylococci, 36 other isolates of Gram positive species
and 20 Gram negative organisms and yeasts. Testing was performed after growing each
organism under simulated conditions of blood culture. Colony counts were performed to
determine target levels (CFU/mL). Testing was performed with both the Staphylococcus
QuickFISH™ BC and mecA XpressFISH® assays. The results from both assays are
shown in Tables 9 to 12. One strain of S. aureus (BAA-2421) that is characterized by the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) as methicillin susceptible but which is known
to carry the mecA gene tested positive with the mecA XpressFISH® assay (refer also to
Table 8). Six strains of coagulase negative staphylococci also tested positive with mecA
XpressFISH®, although the risk of obtaining false-positive results from such strains is
mitigated by the requirement that a positive result must first be obtained with the
Staphylococcus QuickFISH™ BC prior to testing with mecA XpressFISH®. All six
coagulase negative staphylococci that produced positive mecA XpressFISH® results were
negative for S. aureus by Staphylococcus QuickFISH™ BC. Similarly, both Lactococcus
lactis and Candida parapsilosis produced positive results with mecA XpressFISH® but
tested negative by Staphylococcus QuickFISH™ BC.
The following species that have potential to cross-react in the mecA XpressFISH® assay
are listed in the limitations section of the Package Insert: Lactococcus lactis, Candida
parapsilosis and Micrococcus luteus.

Cross-Contamination Study
According to the instructions for use, mecA XpressFISH® slides can be washed in batches
of up to five slides following the hybridization step. This is the only step in the mecA
XpressFISH® procedure where slides prepared from different samples are present and
exposed together to a common reagent and where they might become cross-
contaminated. AdvanDx conducted an in-house study with the mecA XpressFISH® assay
to assess the potential for cross-contamination during the wash step to lead to False
Positive results.
A well characterized mecA positive MRSA strain (NRS 383) and a strain of MSSA
(ATCC BAA-1718) were used for testing. For each run, a set of four MRSA slides and
one MSSA slide was prepared from simulated blood cultures at >108 CFU/mL. Three sets
of five slides were processed through the hybridization step according to the mecA
XpressFISH® procedure and each slide set was then placed into a slide holder for the
wash step. The placement of the MSSA slide relative to the four MRSA slides within the
holder was varied between sets (i.e., the MSSA slide within a set was placed at a different

middle or outside position relative to the four MRSA slides within the holder). The slide
sets were each then washed according to the mecA XpressFISH® procedure, and the slides
were mounted and examined by fluorescence microscopy. All MRSA samples were
Green Positive (12/12; 100%) and all MSSA samples were Negative (3/3; 100%) with no
Green Positive organisms found in the MSSA sample wells (or Internal Negative Control
wells). The results of this study verify that cross-contamination of slides is unlikely to
occur when up to five slides are washed together.
g. Assay cut-off:
The mecA XpressFISH® assay Package Insert stipulates that, in order to report a negative
test result, a minimum of 50 microscopic fields of view should be examined with either a
60X or a 100X objective lens. To report a sample as positive by mecA XpressFISH®,
multiple fields of view that contain multiple fluorescent cells should be observed.
The requirement to examine 50 fields of view was determined by examining mixtures of
MSSA and MRSA in different proportions. The levels of MRSA that were tested are
close to the limit of detection of the assay. Five slides were viewed with both 60X and
100X objective lenses and under each test condition. The results are summarized in
Table 13.
With MRSA at a concentration of 4.73 x 105 CFU/mL, an average of 15.4 fluorescent
cells was observed in 50 fields of view when visualized with a 60X objective. On the
same slides, an average of 7.6 fluorescent cells was found in 50 fields of view when
visualized with a 100X objective. MSSA at 2.30 x 108 CFU/mL did not show any
positive fluorescent cells in 50 fields of view.
With MRSA at 5.15 x 105 CFU/mL in the presence of MSSA at 1.15 x 108 CFU/mL, an
average of 53.4 fluorescent cells was observed in 50 fields of view. Under a 60X
objective lens when the same MRSA culture was mixed with MSSA at 1.15 x 104
CFU/mL, an average of 64.4 fluorescent cells was observed in 50 fields. With a 100X
objective under these conditions, the average numbers of fluorescent cells in 50 fields
were 27.6 and 30.4, respectively.
The data from this study support the Package Insert instructions regarding the number of
fields of view to examine in order to report results for the mecA XpressFISH® assay.

No interference was observed with any of the compounds that were tested except
linezolid. Both strains of MRSA that were tested in the presence of linezolid produced
weak positive green fluorescence. There was no impact from linezolid on correct
reporting of results for MSSA. There is therefore a potential to obtain false-negative
results with mecA XpressFISH® with samples from patients who are being treated with
linezolid. This is noted as a limitation within the mecA XpressFISH® Package Insert.
For 0.04% sodium polyanethol sulfonate (SPS) and ~0.2% saponin, a lack of interference
with mecA XpressFISH® was inferred from testing of culture media that contain these
substances.
Mixed Infection Study
mecA XpressFISH® is intended to be used with blood cultures of S. aureus as determined
by Staphylococcus QuickFISH™ BC and is not intended to be used with mixed cultures
identified either by Gram stain or Staphylococcus QuickFISH™ BC. Because of the
inherent analytic sensitivity of slide based microbial tests and the variable rate of growth
of microbes, there exists a possibility that a blood culture which appears to be positive
solely for S. aureus by Gram stain and Staphylococcus QuickFISH™ BC is in fact a
mixed culture (i.e., S. aureus and another species). In addition, should MRSA and MSSA

occur together in the same blood culture, the culture would not be distinguishable as a
mixed culture by either Gram stain or Staphylococcus QuickFISH™ BC. A microbial
interference study was therefore conducted in order to evaluate whether the presence of a
non-MRSA organism would interfere with the detection of MRSA by mecA
XpressFISH®.
Testing was performed with simulated blood cultures to determine the impact of mixed
populations of MRSA and MSSA or MRSA and coagulase negative staphylococci on the
mecA XpressFISH® assay. Two strains of MRSA were tested in the presence of different
co-infecting species of Staphylococcus (Table 15). No interference was observed in
detection of either strain of MRSA at levels close to the limits of detection of the assay
when the co-infecting species were present at >108CFU/mL.

Culture Media Compatibility
In order to evaluate the compatibility of alternative culture media with mecA
XpressFISH®, testing was performed with 20 strains of MRSA and 3 strains of MSSA,
representing a range of geographic and genotypic diversity. Samples were grown under
simulated conditions of blood culture and colony counts were determined prior to testing
to estimate target levels. Each sample was tested by Gram stain and Staphylococcus
QuickFISH™ BC prior to analysis with mecA XpressFISH®. The expected results for
both Staphylococcus QuickFISH™ BC and mecA XpressFISH® were obtained for each of
the media shown in Table 16.

During the course of the study the sites identified 1,101 blood culture bottles as positive
for GPCC. One hundred and twenty five bottles were identified as paired or duplicates
and these were removed such that performance would be determined using only one
bottle per patient/episode. Ten samples were excluded because >60h transpired since the
bottle was called positive and before mecA XpressFISH® testing could occur.
Staphylococcus QuickFISH™ BC results for 602 of the remaining samples showed the
presence organisms other than S. aureus and therefore these samples were not tested with
mecA XpressFISH®. Five samples were identified as mixed cultures of S. aureus and
coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) for which mecA XpressFISH® is not indicated,
and these were therefore also not tested. This left a total of 359 blood cultures which met
the inclusion criteria for mecA XpressFISH® testing during which protocol violations
(e.g., incorrect temperature, or incubation time) were recorded for 20 samples which were
also excluded from the analysis. Thus, the remaining 339 test results were used to
determine performance of mecA XpressFISH® in comparison to cefoxitin disk diffusion
as the reference method. The interval between a culture turning positive and mecA
XpressFISH® testing ranged from <2h up to 57h (Table 17).

The results of the study are summarized by site and blood culture medium in Table 18.
Overall results of the study are shown in Table 19. There were no Positive or Negative
Control failures during the course of the study (339/339 paired positive and negative
results, as expected; 100%).

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The Clinical Study was performed with blood cultures from six health care centers in the
United States and one in the United Kingdom. S. aureus positive blood culture bottles
were identified by testing with Staphylococcus QuickFISH™ BC. In total, 339 blood
cultures were included in study, with one culture per subject. The rate of MRSA in S.
aureus positive cultures varied by geographic location and ranged from 6.7% at the site
in the United Kingdom to 29.0% - 58.3% at the sites in the US (Table 20). The incidence
of MRSA infection will vary depending on institution, patient population as well as
geographic location and other factors.
