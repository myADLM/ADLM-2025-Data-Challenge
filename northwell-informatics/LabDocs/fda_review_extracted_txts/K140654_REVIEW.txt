See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Hemoglobin A1c assay is used in clinical laboratories for the quantitative
in vitro measurement of percent hemoglobin A1c (NGSP) or HbA1c fraction mmol/mol
(IFCC) in human whole blood and hemolysate on the ARCHITECT c 4000 System.
Hemoglobin A1c measurements are used as an aid in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus,
as an aid to identify patients who may be at risk for developing diabetes mellitus, and for
the monitoring of long-term blood glucose control in individuals with diabetes mellitus.
The Hemoglobin A1c Calibrators are for use in the calibration of the Hemoglobin A1c
assay on the ARCHITECT c 4000 System.
The Hemoglobin A1c Controls are used for the estimation of test precision and the
detection of systematic analytical deviations of the Hemoglobin A1c assay on the
ARCHITECT c 4000 System.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
• For prescription use only.
• This device has significant negative interference with fetal hemoglobin (HbF).
HbA1c results are invalid for patients with abnormal amounts of HbF including those
with known Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin.
• Glycated HbF is not detected by the assay as it does not contain the β-chain that
characterizes HbA1c. However, HbF is measured in the total Hb assay and as a
consequence, specimens containing high amounts of HbF (>5%) may result in lower
than expected mmol/mol HbA1c values (IFCC) and % HbA1c values (DCCT/NGSP).
• The Hemoglobin A1c assay should not be used to diagnose diabetes during
pregnancy. Hemoglobin A1c reflects the average blood glucose levels over the
preceding 3 months (i.e., the average life span of a red blood cell) and therefore may
be falsely low during pregnancy or any other condition associated with recent onset
of hyperglycemia and/or decreased red blood cell survival.
• The Hemoglobin A1c assay should not be used to diagnose or monitor diabetes in
patients with the following conditions:
-hemoglobinopathies except as demonstrated to produce acceptable performance
(e.g., sickle cell trait).
-abnormal red blood cell turnover. (e.g., anemias from hemolysis and iron
deficiency).
-malignancies, and severe chronic hepatic and renal disease.
2

--- Page 3 ---
• In cases of rapidly evolving Type 1 diabetes, the increase of HbA1c values might be
delayed compared to the acute increase in glucose concentrations. In these conditions,
diabetes mellitus must be diagnosed based on plasma glucose concentrations and/or
the typical clinical symptoms.
• This test should not replace glucose testing for patients with Type 1 diabetes,
pediatric patients or pregnant women.
4. Special instrument requirements:

L. Test Principle:
The Hemoglobin A1c assay consists of two separate concentration measurements: glycated
hemoglobin (HbA1c) and total hemoglobin (THb). The two concentrations are used to
determine the percent HbA1c (NGSP units) or the hemoglobin fraction in mmol/mol (IFCC
units). The individual concentration values of HbA1c and THb generated by the Hemoglobin
A1c assay are used only for calculating the percent hemoglobin A1c or HbA1c fraction, and
must not be used individually for diagnostic purposes. The anticoagulated whole blood
specimen is lysed automatically on the system for the Whole Blood application or may be
lysed manually using the Hemoglobin A1c Diluent for the Hemolysate application.
Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c)
The Hemoglobin A1c assay utilizes an enzymatic method that specifically measures N-
terminal fructosyl dipeptides of the β-chain of HbA1c. In the pretreatment process, the
erythrocytes are lysed and the hemoglobin is transformed to methemoglobin by reaction with
sodium nitrite. With the addition of Reagent 1 to the sample, the glycosylated N-terminal
dipeptide (fructosyl-VH) of the β- chain of hemoglobin is cleaved by the action of protease.
The hemoglobin is transformed to stable methemoglobin azide by the action of sodium azide
and the concentration of the hemoglobin is determined by measuring absorbance. Addition of
Reagent 2 starts a reaction and fructosyl peptideoxidase (FPOX) is allowed to react with
fructosyl-VH. The HbA1cconcentration is measured by determining the resultant hydrogen
peroxide.
Total Hemoglobin (THb)
The hemoglobin is oxidized to stable methemoglobin azide by the action of sodium nitrite
and sodium azide and the concentration of the hemoglobin is determined by measuring
absorbance (sample + R1).
Hemoglobin A1c Calculations
The final result is expressed as %HbA (NGSP) or mmol/mol HbA (IFCC) and is
1c 1c
automatically calculated by the system from the HbA /THb ratio as follows:
1c
mmol/mol HbA1c IFCC:
HbA1c (mmol/mol) = (HbA /THb) × 1000
1c
%HbA1c DCCT/NGSP:
HbA (%) = IFCC x 0.09148 + 2.152

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-Laboratory Precision (20-Day)
A 20-day precision study was conducted to evaluate the precision performance of the
Hemoglobin A1c assay based on guidance from the CLSI document EP5-A2, Evaluation
of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods. Testing was performed
using 3 lots of Hemoglobin A1c Reagents, 3 lots of Hemoglobin A1c Calibrators, 1 lot of
Hemoglobin A1c Controls (Low and High), and 1 lot of commercially available human
whole blood controls (Control Levels 1, 2, and 3) on 3 ARCHITECT c 4000 analyzers.
Three levels of controls made from reconstituted lyophilized anticoagulated human whole
blood and three levels of pooled human anticoagulated venous whole blood (panels) were
tested a minimum of 2 replicates, twice per day, for a total of 20 testing days. Total
number of measurements per sample was 720 (=3 instruments x 3 lots x 20 days x 2 runs
x 2 replicates). Results are shown below in NGSP and IFCC units. The HbA1c sample
abbreviations are as follows: LC= Hemoglobin A1c Low Control (target value 5.2 %),
HC= Hemoglobin A1c High Control (target value 10.0%), CL3= commercially available
control level 3 (target value14.6%); PS1 = human whole blood near the lower limit of the
measuring interval (target range 4.0-4.6%), PS2=human whole blood near the medical
decision point (target range 6.0- 7.0%) PS3= human whole blood above the medical
decision point (target range 8.0-10.0%).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed based on guidance from the CLSI document
EP6-A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measuring Procedures: A Statistical
Approach.
Commercially available whole-blood HbA1c linearity sets, comprised of Levels 1, 2, 3,
and 4, were obtained. Five additional samples were prepared by combining the 4 levels of
the commercially available linearity sets in specific ratios. The 9 samples were tested
using the Abbott Hemoglobin A1c assay on the ARCHITECT c 4000 analyzer. The mean
observed %HbA1c value was determined for each intermediate dilution and plotted
versus the relative analyte concentration. The linear regression equation is summarized
below:
NGSP:

The linearity study supports the claimed assay measuring range of 4.0 to 14.0% HbA1c
(20.22 to 129.51 mmol/mol HbA1c (IFCC)).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Architect HbA1c assay standardization is traceable to the International
Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) reference calibrators. The Architect HbA1c
assay is NGSP certified. The NGSP certification expires in one year. See NGSP
website for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
The derived result of (%) from the NGSP correlation is calculated from the individual
quantitative results for total hemoglobin and Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The IFCC
units of mmol/mol are calculated using the Master Equation IFCC=(NGSP-
2.15/0.092). Two different units are provided to the users: NGSP equivalent units (%)
and IFCC equivalent units (mmol/mol).
Value Assignment:
The ARCHITECT HbA1c calibrators are aligned to IFCC reference calibrators
through internal value assignment in which calibrator values must meet the sponsor’s
pre-determined acceptance criteria within a set specification, determined by the
manufacturer.
Each lot of calibrators is value-assigned. The concentration of glycated hemoglobin
(HbA1c) and total hemoglobin (THb) is provided for each lot. Calibrators are
prepared gravimetrically, lyophilized, and then value assigned using secondary
calibrators that are traceable to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and
Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) reference method.
The value-assigned A1c Calibrator values are within the following hemoglobin A1c
ranges:
Calibrator 1: 4.59% to 6.02% HbA1c
Calibrator 2: 10.52% to 13.37% HbA1c
The Hemoglobin A1C Controls, low and high, are value assigned using the secondary
calibrators. The values obtained must meet the sponsor’s pre-determined acceptance
criteria. The value-assigned A1c Control values are within the following hemoglobin
A1c ranges:
Control L: 4.59% to 6.02% HbA1c
Control H: 9.42% to 11.07 % HbA1c.
Stability:
Shelf-life claims: Un-opened calibrators and controls can be stored at 2-8°C until the
expiration date or for 12 months. The storage and stability study protocols and
acceptance criteria provided by the sponsor were reviewed and found acceptable to
17

--- Page 18 ---
support the claimed conditions.
Open-vial claims: The recommended storage condition for in-use calibrators and
controls is 2-8 °C and is stable for 10 days post-reconstitution. Labeling indicates not
to freeze the control and calibrator materials. The storage and stability study protocols
and acceptance criteria provided by the sponsor were reviewed and found acceptable
to support the claimed conditions.
On-board stability for the ARCHITECT HbA1c was established by real time studies
on the ARCHITECT c4000 analyzer and demonstrated on-board reagent stability of
50 days. The unopened ARCHITECT HbA1c reagent is stable until the expiration
date printed on the label when stored at 2 to 8°C. The storage and stability study
protocols and acceptance criteria provided by the sponsor were reviewed and found
acceptable to support the claimed conditions.
d. Detection limit:
The claimed measuring range of 4.0-14.0% for the ARCHITECT HbA1c assay is
based on linearity. See 1b. above.
e. Analytical specificity:
i.) An interference study was performed based on CLSI EP7-A2 guideline to assess
common or known substances that could interfere with the HbA1c assay. The
potential interferents listed below were spiked into human EDTA whole blood samples
with different levels of % HbA1c (approximately 6.5 and > 8.0% HbA1c). Each
sample was tested in a minimum of 12 replicates. The % HbA1c values of the spiked
samples were compared to the reference samples containing no interferent. Significant
interference was defined as greater or equal to ±5% difference from the expected
concentration. The interference study results are summarized in the following table:
Potential Interferent Highest Tested Concentration at
which no significant interference
(≥±5%) was observed
Bilirubin, conjugated 20.0 mg/dL
Bilirubin, unconjugated 15.0 mg/dL
Total Protein 22g/dL

from the CLSI EP7-A2. Interference effects were assessed by comparing the
Hemoglobin A1c values to a comparative method for samples containing potentially
interfering hemoglobin variants. The samples were tested in duplicate using one lot
of HbA1c Reagents on one ARCHITECT c 4000 analyzer. The numbers and
concentrations hemoglobin variants tested, and the range of % HbA1c concentrations
in which they were tested are shown below:
Hemoglobin Range in % Abnormal Range in %HbA1c

a. The HbA2 results at ~9.0 %HbA1c consisted of samples between 7.2 to
11.2 %HbA1c.
b. The range is defined as the minimum and maximum relative % difference at
each concentration level (~6.0 and ~9.0 %HbA1c).
c. A negative % difference with HbF is proportional in magnitude to the %
HbF present in the sample. For example, when the amount of HbF in the
sample was 20.4%, the % difference was -20.0% on the ARCHITECT c
4000 System.

The sponsor claims that no significant interference was observed for the HbC, HbD,
HbE, HbS, and HbA2 variants at the concentrations tested above.
In addition, the device labeling contains the following prominent boxed warning in
the package insert labeling:
WARNING: The Hemoglobin A1c assay has significant interference with the
fetal hemoglobin (HbF). Hemoglobin A1c results are invalid for patients with
abnormal amounts of HbF, including those with known Hereditary Persistence
of Fetal Hemoglobin.
iii) A drug interference study was performed using a low level whole blood sample
with a concentration value of between 6.0 and 7.0% HbA1c and a high whole blood
sample with a concentration value of ≥ 8.0% HbA1c. Test samples were prepared by
spiking each drug at the interferent concentrations into the low and high samples and
comparing to control samples containing no drug. The test and control samples were
tested in a minimum of 12 replicates using 1 lot of HbA1c reagents and calibrators.
The sponsor defined significant interference as greater or equal to ±5% difference
from the expected concentration.
The sponsor states that the HbA1c assay is not susceptible to interference effects from
the following drugs at the listed concentration levels evaluated.

iv.) A hemoglobin derivative study was performed using a low level whole blood sample
with a concentration between 6.0 and 7.0% HbA1c and a high whole blood sample
with a concentration of ≥ 8.0% HbA1c. The potentially interfering hemoglobin
derivatives were prepared by adding the following substance at the levels shown
below.
• Acetylated Hemoglobin ≥ 50 mg/dL of ASA (aspirin)
• Carbamlyated Hemoglobin ≥ 10 mmol/L of Cyanate
• Labile Hemoglobin ≥ 1000 mg/dL of Glucose
The test samples were prepared by spiking the substances at the interferent
concentration listed above into the low and high samples. The test and reference
samples were tested in a minimum of 12 replicates. Significant interference was
defined as ± 5% when comparing test samples containing the potentially interfering
hemoglobin derivatives to the corresponding reference samples.
The sponsor states that the HbA1c assay is not susceptible to interference effects from
the hemoglobin derivatives at the interference levels evaluated.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study using human EDTA whole blood specimens (n=128)
was performed based on CLSI EP9-A2, Method Comparison and Bias Estimation
Using Patient Samples guidelines. Each sample was analyzed internally in replicates
of two, using two lots each of HbA1c reagents and HbA1c calibrators on two
ARCHITECT c 4000 analyzers over a minimum of 5 days. The samples were also
tested in duplicate with an NGSP secondary reference laboratory using a FDA cleared

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommendations1 are summarized in the
following table.
HbA1c Value Glycemic Goal
< 8% HbA1c (64 mmol/mol) Less stringent
< 7% HbA1c (53 mmol/mol) General (Non-Pregnant Adults)
< 6.5% HbA1c (48 mol/mol) More stringent
HbA1c values above 6.5% HbA1c (48mmol/mol) are an indication of hyperglycemia
during the preceding 2 to 3 months or longer. According to the recommendations of the
ADA, AbA1c values above 6.5% HbA1c (48 mmol/mol) are suitable for the diagnosis of
diabetes mellitus. Patients with HbA1c values in the range of 5.7-6.4%HbA1c (39-46
mmol/mol) may be at risk of developing diabetes. 2,3
