H. Intended Use:
1. Intended Use(s):
See Indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Snap-Top Split Key Cup for use with the GenPrime Drugs of Abuse (DOA) Reader
System is for in vitro diagnostic use and is intended for prescription use in laboratories,
point-of-care, and workplaces by trained users. The test is not intended for over-the-counter
use. The test cannot be read visually and must be used with the GenPrime DOA Reader.
The Snap-Top Split Key Cup qualitatively detects drug classes in human urine at the cut-off
concentrations shown below:
Test Calibrated to Cut-off
Amphetamines d-Amphetamine 500 ng/mL
Barbiturates Secobarbital 300 ng/mL
Benzodiazepines Oxazepam 300 ng/mL
Cocaine Benzoylecgonine 150 ng/mL
Methamphetamine d-Methamphetamine 500 ng/mL
Methadone Methadone 300 ng/mL
Morphine Morphine 300 ng/mL
Opiates 2000 Morphine 2000 ng/mL
Oxycodone Oxycodone 100 ng/mL
Phencyclidine Phencyclidine 25 ng/mL
Marijuana Delta-9-THC-COOH 50 ng/mL
Configurations of the Snap-Top Split Key cup may consist of any combination of the
above listed drug analytes.
The Snap-Top Split Key Cup provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more
specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical
result. Gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS), high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) or liquid chromatography / tandem mass spectrometry
(LC/MS/MS) are the preferred confirmatory methods. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly
when preliminary positive results are obtained.

For in vitro diagnostic prescription use in laboratories, point-of-care, and workplace sites
4. Special instrument requirements:
The GenPrime DOA Reader
I. Device Description:
The Snap-Top Split Key Cup (Snap-Top SK Cup) is a rapid, single use, disposable
immunochromatographic test for the qualitative detection of drugs of abuse in human urine.
The device consists of a test card with drug strips integrated into a urine cup with a partition
that requires a key activation step to disperse urine into the cup for testing to begin. The
Snap-Top Split Key Cup is intended for use solely with the GenPrime Drugs of Abuse
Reader System.

L. Test Principle:
The Snap-Top SK Cup measures density of visible lines against background to produce a
preliminary positive or negative result for single-use, immunochromatographic drug tests.
Each drug strip of the cup consists of: (1) a purple colored pad containing mouse
monoclonal anti-drug antibodies conjugated with colloidal gold and rabbit IgG antibodies
conjugated with colloidal gold that are hydrated and solubilized by urine samples for
transport through the test strip, and (2) a nitrocellulose membrane strip containing Test lines
and a Control line. The Test line is coated with drug-protein conjugate and the Control line
is coated with goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. During analysis, an image of the drug test
strip is captured and the software algorithm determines from the image whether the
presence or absence of colored test lines is associated with a preliminary positive or
negative result for each analyte. The software also confirms the validity of the results by
verifying the presence of control lines.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The performance testing described herein is for the BAR, BZO and COC analytes only. The
analytes amphetamine, methadone, methamphetamine, morphine, opiate, phencyclidine (PCP)
and cannabinoid were previously cleared under k130082 and the performance of those analytes
is described in k130082.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision studies were performed with the Snap-Top SK Cup at three sites
representative of laboratory, workplace, and POC settings with an intended use
operator at each site. The operators performed the tests following the instructions for
use.
Precision studies were performed with the target analytes at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%,
125%, 150%, 175%, and 200% of the cutoff during a 20 working day period using
solutions containing drug concentrations confirmed by GC/MS. The identity of the
samples was masked from the operator.
Performance was evaluated for each drug analyte by testing each drug at the stated
concentration using a minimum of 15 tests per operator. Results for all sites are shown
in the tables below. Note that for the Barbiturates analyte, testing was not performed at
the 200% cut-off level for Lot 2 due to a test device shipping error. Information is
provided for this analyte at this cut-off level for the other two device lots evaluated.

quality control products were previously cleared under k121122.
Stability:
The sponsor’s stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found
acceptable. The information supports that the Snap-Top SK Cup unopened stability is 12
months. Stability testing is ongoing.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in Section M.1.a.
(Precision/Reproducibility) above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity studies were performed with the Snap-Top SK Cup to determine
whether drugs and drug metabolites within the same class of drugs or with similar
molecular structures cross- react in the test system. Reference standards for the various
metabolites and compounds were prepared at 100 µg/mL in pooled negative human urine
samples. Compounds that tested positive were serially diluted until a negative result was
observed. Results shown are expressed as the minimum concentration producing a
positive result in the indicated assay. A list of these compounds and their level of cross
reactivity is shown below.

pH and Specific Gravity
The Snap-Top SK Cup was assayed with pH values of 3.0, 4.0, 7.0 and 9.0. The pH
samples were fortified with drug concentrations at 50% (negative) and 150% (positive)
of cutoff for BAR, BZO, and COC. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. All pH
samples gave negative results at the 50% of cutoff level for each drug, and all gave
positive results at the 150% of cutoff level for each drug.
The Snap-Top SK Cup was assayed in triplicate with samples with specific gravity

drug concentrations as described above for pH. All specific gravity samples gave
negative results at the 50% of cutoff level for each drug, and all gave positive results at
the 150% of cutoff level for each drug.
Structurally-unrelated
Drug free urine samples were spiked with BAR, BZO, and COC concentrations that
were at 50% (negative) and 150% (positive) of cutoff. Concentrations of 100,000
ng/mL of structurally-unrelated compounds were then added to the preparation and
assayed using the Snap-Top SK Cup. None of the following compounds affected the
expected results: acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, bropheniramine maleate,
caffeine, carbamazepine, chlorpheniramine, cocaine, dextromethorphan, doxylamine,
ibuprofen, morphine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (diphenylhydantoin), d-
pseudoephidrine, salicylic acid.
The labeling states that there is the possibility that other substances and/or factors not
listed above may interfere with the test and cause false results.
f. Assay cut-off:
Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in Section M.1.a.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The accuracy of the Snap-Top SK Cup was evaluated at three sites representative
