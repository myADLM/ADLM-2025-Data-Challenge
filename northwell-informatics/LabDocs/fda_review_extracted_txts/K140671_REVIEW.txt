H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay (Opiates, Oxycodone and
Hydrocodone) is an in vitro diagnostic test that is intended for the qualitative detection of
opiates (calibrated with morphine) and oxycodone and hydrocodone (calibrated with
oxycodone) at or above 300 pg/mg in human head and body hair. To confirm a screen
positive result, a more specific alternate chemical method, such as Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) operating in the selected ion monitoring
(SIM) mode is the preferred method with deuterated internal standards. Professional
judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when
presumptive positive results are obtained.
This test is intended exclusively for single laboratory use only and is not intended for sale
to anyone.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Over-the-Counter Use
4. Special instrument requirements:
The screening assay is for use with an automated microplate reader capable of
measuring at 450 nm.
For confirmation testing, the sponsor uses an Agilent GC/MS in selected ion
monitoring (SIM) mode using deuterated internal standards.
I. Device Description:
Donor head and body hair samples are collected using the Omega Collection Kit. The Donor
Sample is shipped to the Company facility where testing is conducted by trained scientists
under the direction of the Laboratory Director.
The assay consists of the following:
• Hair sample collection kit
• Micro strip plates coated with either anti-morphine mouse monoclonal or antioxycodone
rabbit polyclonal antibody, enzyme conjugate (horseradish peroxidase conjugated to
morphine or oxycodone), substrate (containing tetramethylbenzidine), an enzyme diluent,
and wash solution
2

--- Page 3 ---
• In-house prepared calibrators and controls are used. These are prepared solutions of
morphine and oxycodone added to negative hair matrix tubes.

L. Test Principle:
The test consists of two parts; a pre-analytical hair treatment procedure (to convert the solid
matrix of hair to a measurable liquid matrix) and the screening assay. The screening assay is
an Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA).
Sample is added to a well of the micro strip plate and enzyme conjugate is added, followed
by incubation. During this phase the enzyme-labeled drug conjugate competes with drug in
the sample for a limited number of binding sites on the antibody-coated micro wells. The two
bind in proportion to their concentrations. A wash solution is applied to remove unbound
materials. Enzyme substrate solution containing a chromagen is added. The reaction is
stopped with a stop solution and absorbance is read using a plate reader at 450 nm. A
background reading is also taken at 630 nm. Color intensity is inversely proportional to the
amount of drug presented in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
See k103161 for precision/reproducibility information.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
See k103161 for calibrator and control materials information, hair sample stability,
and shipping study information.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
See k103161 for cross reactivity, interference (structurally related and unrelated
compounds), hair treatment, and environmental contamination studies.
In addition to studies conducted in k103161, the sponsor performed additional cross
reactivity testing on several structurally similar compounds including Buprenorphine,
Noroxymorphone, 3-Methoxynaltrexone, Morphine-6-betaglucuronide, Nalmefene,
Nalorphine, Naloxone-3-beta-D-glucuronide, Naltrexone, Naltriben. These
compounds appeared to contribute to an Opiate or Oxycodone positive ELISA result

at -50% cutoff, but did not show cross reactivity when tested at concentrations up to
400,000pg/mg.
To investigate this discrepancy, cross reactivity was tested at up to 10 fold higher
concentrations. Expected results were obtained. The results are summarized in the
tables below. The tables below are also included in the device labeling.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies on head hair samples were performed and reported in the
predicate submission (k103161). Additional method comparison studies were
performed for this current submission with 50 body hair samples. Each tested sample
was divided into two aliquots and one was used for screening on the candidate device
(ELISA assay) and the other for GC/MS confirmation. Testing was performed on hair
samples from different ages, gender, ethnicities and hair color. The combined head
hair (performed in k103161) and body hair (this submission) results are shown below:
