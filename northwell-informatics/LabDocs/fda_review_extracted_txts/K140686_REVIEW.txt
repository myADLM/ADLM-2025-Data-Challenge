L. Test Principle:
Evaluating the concentration of a soluble antigen (e.g. IgM Kappa and IgM Lambda) by
turbidimetry involves the addition of the test sample (with either IgM Kappa (IgMκ) or IgM
Lambda (IgMλ)) to a solution containing the appropriate antibody (anti-IgMκ or anti-IgMλ)
in a reaction vessel or cuvette. A beam of light is passed through the cuvette and as the
antigen-antibody reaction proceeds, the light passing through the cuvette is scattered
increasingly as insoluble immune complexes are formed. Light scatter is monitored by
measuring the decrease in intensity of the incident beam of light. The antibody in the cuvette
is in excess so the amount of immune complex formed is proportional to the antigen
concentration. A series of calibrators of known antigen concentration are assayed initially to
produce a calibration curve of measured light scatter versus antigen concentration. Samples

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the assays was assessed using one lot of reagent on one analyzer.
A high and a low pool were prepared for both the Hevylite Human IgM Kappa kit and
the Hevylite IgM Lambda kit for use on SPA in order to evaluate linearity across
PLUS
the measuring range. The high pools for IgMκ and IgMλ were prepared from a serum
sample with a naturally high concentration of IgMκ or IgMλ and adjusted by the
addition of purified IgM. The low pools for IgMκ and IgMλ was prepared from a
normal serum sample adjusted with the addition of IgM depleted serum. A dilution
series was prepared for IgMκ and IgMλ separately by combining the respective high
and low pools to create a single proportional dilution series (e.g., 90+10, 80+20, etc.),
to produce a total of 12 concentrations that covered the measuring range of the
assays. Three replicates of each level of the dilution series were run and the mean
calculated. Linearity was evaluated by calculating the percentage recovery at each
concentration in the dilution series, and the %CV of the 3 replicates.
All of the concentrations within the analytical measuring range met the sponsor’s
acceptance criterion of %CV < 8% and all concentrations met the sponsor’s

The LoB sample consisted of an analyte-depleted sample pool. The LoB sample was
tested 60 times and the mean and standard deviation (SD) were calculated.
LoB was calculated using non-parametric analysis. The LoB results were ranked
from lowest to highest concentration, and the LoB was estimated to be the result
equivalent to the concentration at the 95th percentile, or between sample results 57
and 58. The LoB was determined to be 0.0 g/L for both the Hevylite Human IgM
Kappa kit and the Hevylite Human IgM Lambda kit.
Limit of Detection (LoD): The LoD is defined as the lowest amount of analyte in a
sample that can be reliably detected.
The LoD was calculated from the LoB and the combined SDs of the five LoQ
samples: LoD = LoB + [(1.645 x SDs)]. The LoD was determined to be 0.00115 g/L
for the Hevylite Human IgM Kappa kit and 0.001645 g/L for the Hevylite Human
IgM Lambda kit.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ): The LoQ is defined as the lowest concentration at
which the analyte can be quantified within predefined goals for bias and imprecision
which are summarized in the following table:

To determine LoQ for each kit, five normal donor samples with known IgMk and
IgMl concentrations were diluted with analyte-depleted serum so that the
concentrations were close to the bottom of the measuring range (IgMk: 0.02 g/L and
IgMl: 0.018 g/L). The five samples for each kit were run 12 times over five days
using the Hevylite Human IgM Kappa kit for use on the SPA analyzer or the
PLUS
Hevylite Human IgM Lambda kit for use on the SPA . The samples were also
PLUS
tested in triplicate over the same time period on the respective predicate device (BN II
analyzer reagents). LoQ was calculated according to the formula TE = | Bias | + 2 x
SDs. The LoQ was determined to be 0.20 g/L for the Hevylite Human IgM Kappa kit

e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering Substances
This study was performed according to the recommendations contained in CLSI
EP07-A2 Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry, Approved Guideline, except that
the cut-off for acceptable interference was set as D < D and < ± 10% difference
obs max
between the mean of the spiked sample and the unspiked sample. Twenty replicates
of each of the serum base pools were run in order to calculate standard deviation.
The D was set at 10% of the analyte concentration for each of the base pools. The
max
standard deviation and the D were then used to calculate the number of replicates
max
required in the interference study. Three replicates of each spiked and unspiked
concentration were determined sufficient for this study.
Five (5) human serum-base pools were prepared to target five analyte concentrations
spanning the measuring range. These levels were chosen to evaluate the effects the
interferents at critical clinical concentrations (level 1 = within reference range; level
2= close to lower medical decision point; level 3 = close to upper medical decision
point; level 4 = low clinical; level 5 = high clinical). The high concentration pool was
diluted with analyte-free serum to achieve the desired target concentrations.
The serum pools were spiked separately with hemoglobin (5 g/L), bilirubin (200
mg/L), Intralipid (500 mg/dL) and triglyceride (1000 mg/dL). The spiked pools were
analyzed, as were the unspiked pools, which were prepared by spiking the base pools
separately with the same volume of commercially obtained blank for each potential
interferent.
The results demonstrate that no significant interference was observed with the
following interferents at the indicated concentrations tested:

Bilirubin 200 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 5 g/L

Rheumatoid factor (RF) was not evaluated because this autoantibody is directed
against the Fc portion of immunoglobulins. Interference is unlikely to take place in

Cross-reactivity:
Cross-reactivity studies were carried out by testing Hevylite IgM Kappa and Hevylite
IgM Lambda assays in the presence of high concentrations of potentially cross-
reacting monoclonal proteins in 253 samples from a multiple myeloma library that
included IgA1κ, IgA1λ, IgA2κ, IgA2λ, IgG1κ, IgG1λ, IgG2κ, IgG2λ, IgG3κ, IgG3λ,
IgG4κ, IgG4λ, κ free light chain and λ free light chain multiple myeloma patient sera
samples.
The samples were all tested for total IgG, total IgA, total IgM, and also with the
Hevylite IgM Kappa and IgM Lambda assays. The results for total IgM were
compared with the results obtained by the Hevylite IgM Kappa and IgM Lambda
assays.
In addition, IgMκ patient samples were tested on Hevylite IgM Lambda kits to
investigate potential cross-reactivity, and similarly, IgMλ patient samples were tested
on IgM kappa kits.
No significant cross-reactivity was observed.
Antigen excess effect:
Prozone/Hook effect parameters are in effect to protect the SPA analyzer from
PLUS
antigen excess effects. Reaction kinetics of high level samples was compared to that
of the top calibrator for each kit. Samples detected as being in excess are flagged
with a “P” flag.
The prozone flag limit for Hevylite IgM Kappa was set by testing 25 high level
samples. The ‘P’ flag was then validated by analyzing 147 normal samples, 24 IgMκ
library samples and 20 IgMκ myeloma quality control samples.
The prozone flag limit for Hevylite IgM Lambda was set by testing 24 high level
samples. The ‘P’ flag was then validated by analyzing 147 normal samples, 20 IgMλ
library samples and 10 IgMλ myeloma quality control samples.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off values are the reference ranges for the normal population which have
been established from the reference range study.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 227 and 269 sera samples spanning the measuring range were assayed in
singlicate on both Hevylite Human IgM kappa and IgM Lambda Kits for use on
SPA respectively, these results were compared to those obtained on the Hevylite
PLUS
Human IgM Kappa and IgM Lambda Kits for use on Siemens BNII.
The serum samples included 41 Waldenström’s Macroglobuliaemia patients, 23
normal donors and samples with elevated IgMκ and IgMλ levels.

Differences in instrument platforms may account for bias observed in the method
comparison. The Hevylite™ Human IgM Kappa and Lambda Kits for use on
SPA have different (slightly lower) reference intervals than the predicate assays

resulting in slightly higher results for the predicate. The SPA instrument also

uptakes a larger starting volume than the predicate which can result in aggregation;
however kits have been optimized for optimal performance on each instrument
platform. Limitations are included in the package inserts advising customers to
establish reference ranges when possible.
