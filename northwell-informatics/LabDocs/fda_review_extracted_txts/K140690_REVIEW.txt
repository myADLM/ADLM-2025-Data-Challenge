L. Test Principle:
BUN-Urea is converted to ammonia and CO by the enzyme urease. The ammonia produced
2
is utilized by glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) to convert alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG) to
glutamic acid, with the concomitant conversion of NADH to NAD which is measured
bichromatically at 340/380 nm, and is proportional to the amount of BUN present.
ISE-The ion selective electrodes develop a voltage that varies with the concentration of the
ion (Na+, K+, Cl-) to which they are specific. The relationship between the voltage developed
and the concentration of the sensed ion is logarithmic and calculated by the Nernst equation.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The BS-480, BS-490 and CLC720i Chemistry analyzers are identical except for the model
names. The sponsor conducted all the performance testing on the BS-480 model only.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability and total precision of serum BUN, serum ISE and urine ISE were
demonstrated by analyzing three aliquots of serum based control material and two
aliquots of urine based control material on the BS-480 Chemistry Analyzer. The
control pools were analyzed in duplicate, two runs per day over twenty days, as
described in CLSI document EP5-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of
Quantitative Measurement Methods.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity claims are validated using CLSI document EP6-A. For the linearity of
BUN the low concentration serum pool containing 5.1 mg/dL BUN was collected
from hospitals, a concentrated solution of BUN is used to supplement the high
concentration serum pool. For serum ISE, the low concentration serum pool was
obtained by diluting with 5% BSA, the high concentration serum pool is obtained by
spiking with a concentrated solution of NaCl or KCl. For Urine ISE, the low
concentration urine pool was obtained by diluting with urine diluent; the high
concentration urine pool was obtained by spiking with a concentrated solution of
NaCl or KCl. Next, 11 equally spaced samples across the linear range are prepared
by using the high and low sample pool. These samples were assayed on the BS-480
chemistry analyzer randomly, and each analyzer was assayed in 4 replicates. The
summary of the results are presented in the table below.

replicates per reagent lot per day for three days on the BS-480 chemistry analyzer for
each analyte. A total of 60 measurements were obtained per reagent lot.
For the determination of LoD, five samples with low analyte concentrations were
measured. In total 60 measurements were obtained per reagent lot.
For the determination of LoQ, five low level samples of known measurand
concentration were prepared. The BUN concentrations were obtained from dilution
calculation with a serum sample whose measurand concentration was determined by a
reference method. The ISE concentrations were obtained from dilution calculation
with salt solution whose measurand concentration was determined by theoretical
spike. All samples were assayed in four replicates per reagent lot per day for three
days. Results from the detection limit studies are summarized in the table below.

e. Analytical specificity:
The effects of potentially interfering substances were determined by using 2 sample
pools (normal and abnormal) according to CLSI document EP7-A2. Bilirubin,
hemoglobin, lipemia (Intralipid, 20% emulsion, used to emulate extremely turbid
samples), and ascorbic acid were tested as potential interfering substances. For each
tested substance, a series of five samples with increasing interferent concentrations
were prepared. Each series of pools were assayed 3 times. The bias between the
control pool and test pool were calculated. The sponsor defines non-significant
interference as ≤ +/-10% bias) when the concentrations of interference materials is
below the ones in the following table.

* Hemolysis can lead to falsely elevated K+ values; the sponsor has put the following
limitation in the labeling: “Hemolyzed samples should not be tested for potassium. “
The sponsor also tested the effects of potentially interfering exogenous substances.
Testing for each analyte was performed at two concentration levels (low and high).
For each potential exogenous interfering substance, a series of five samples with
increasing interferent concentrations were prepared. Each series of pools were
assayed 3 times. The bias between the control pool and test pool were calculated.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison was performed according to CLSI document EP9-A2, 120- 132
samples for each analyte were assayed in duplicate on the BS-480 Chemistry
Analyzer and the BS-400 Chemistry Analyzer (predicate device). The first of the
duplicate results from the BS-480 chemistry analyzer were compared against the
predicate’s results. The slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient were obtained
using Passing-Bablok analysis. The total numbers of altered (spiked and diluted)
samples were no more than 19% of the total samples tested. Statistical results are
shown in the table below.

b. Matrix comparison :
A Matrix comparison study was conducted following CLSI document EP-9-A2.
Samples were tested on the The BS-480 analyzer. The study was conducted using 67
paired serum and lithium heparin plasma samples drawn from the same individuals.
Statistical results using Passing-Bablok analysis are shown in the table below.
Analyte Unit N Sample range Slope Intercept Correlation Coefficient
Na+ mmol/L 67 103. – 186 0.971 2.9 0.995

The sponsor concluded that Lithium heparin plasma is acceptable to be used with
their ISE (Na+, K+ and Cl-) assay.

O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Random access instrument with optional ISE module
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Manual or sample barcode option
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Random access and stat mode operation. Samples are loaded on a sample wheel.
5. Calibration:
The sponsor recommends BUN calibration every 14 days. The recommended calibrators
are provided in the labeling.
The sponsor recommends that the user perform an ISE two-point calibration
every 8 hours. If the user is running more than 50 serum samples a day;
both cleaning and two-point calibration must be performed after every 50
samples to ensure reliable operation of the ISE Module.
6. Quality Control:
In the labeling, the sponsor recommends the controls should be run at least with every
working shift in which BUN assays are performed. It is recommended that each
laboratory establish its own frequency of control determination. The recommended
control materials are provided in the labeling. The sponsor recommends the QC
materials should be run after each calibration of the ISE module.
