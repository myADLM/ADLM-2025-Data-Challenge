I. Device Description:
1. Microarray plate: 1 package, storage 2-8°C
The Ig_plex Celiac DGP Panel microarray plate consists of an array of capture replicate
spots, covalently bound to the surface of coated glass within each well of a
96-well SBS compliant assay plate. All wells have the identical eight by eight grid
containing:
o Eighteen (18) capture spots each of DGP and tTG
o Six (6) capture spots each of human IgG control and human IgA/IgG mix control
o Four (4) spots of Dy649-BSA
o Twelve (12) blanks
The control IgG and IgG/IgA captures are used to confirm that the reporter mix is
performing within specification and for other internal quality checks. The fluorescently
tagged BSA spots are used as “Landing Lights” for the spot finding algorithm’s grid
registration. The spots are approximately 200µm in diameter. The outer plate holder is
labeled with a barcode indicating the control number which the system reads to identify the
assay type and lot number.

L. Test Principle:
The system is a multiplex immunoassay analyzer that semi-automates the protocol of a
specific Ig_plex assay from plate washing to reporting of all assay markers for each
individual patient sample. The system combines manual liquid handling (samples and
reagents) with automated steps for washing, scanning, data analyses and reporting.
The system uses graphical user interface software to lead the operator through manual
sample, reagent, and plate handling operations. The software controls the instruments,
analysis and reporting using the same core software as the predicate instrument. The sqid-X
software also provides access to maintenance procedures.
The system controls the washer to ensure that the same wash programs are used every time
and in the correct sequence. Once the assay’s biochemical reactions are complete and the
plate is placed in the scanner, the instrument automatically performs a multi- wavelength
fluorescent scan of each well in the microarray plate, analyzes the data, and generates a
report containing results for all assay markers. The sqid-X system also includes numerous
internal quality checks.
Results for each patient sample are obtained simultaneously for each of the four Ig_plex
Celiac DGP Panel markers: DGP IgA, DGP IgG, tTG IgA and tTG IgG using the data from
one well containing one sample of the patient’s serum. The system does not interpret the
results with respect to diagnosis; it simply reports each result independently. The
biochemical reactions and analysis for the measurements are found in 4.5 Principle of
Operation following the description of the device components.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sample sets used in these studies together covered the measuring range for each
assay, although not every sample contained all four analytes. The specific number of
samples for each element is described below. The manufacturer’s acceptance
criterion is that all reproducibility results should have % CVs of ≤10%.
i. Within-Run (intra-assay) Reproducibility Testing
Negative and positive samples covering the measuring range for each device,
including at least 10% of total samples within ±25% of the cut-off for each
assay, were run in replicates of twelve (12) on one kit. A total of four (4) kits
were run on different days.

were evaluated. Because the instrument reports values below the cut-off as “<”
instead of with a number, the concentration of analyte in normal serum was arbitrarily
assigned a value below the cut-off so expected concentrations could be calculated.
Using the analyte concentration values for different dilutions, a graph of observed
(measured) values vs. expected concentrations was plotted. The claimed upper limit
is rounded off to the nearest tenth of the result.

serum sample with high titers for anti-DGP IgA and IgG and anti-tTG IgA
and IgG.
During development, the raw material samples were diluted to a desired
anchorage point, e.g., 2000x, 4000x and 16000x for a U/mL value assignment.
These anchorage levels were selected to ensure coverage of the hypothetical
cut-off points. A standard curve was constructed using the chosen dilution
levels for each. The external standards are eight serial dilutions of a sample
derived from human sera containing an appropriate representation of each of
the analytes to be reported. Each assay has a specific standard range that is
present in the standards; these are encoded in the bar code for each standard.
In-house standards are prepared, and are assigned with arbitrary units. For
new standards, the repetitiveness of the standard curves and bias of fit versus
measured values were considered. Eight standard levels were then selected.
Curve fitting algorithms were configured for each analyte. Finally, the
standards were validated using celiac positive and normal samples. In this
study, cut-off values and sensitivity/specificity of the assay were evaluated
and to a large extent were found within industry range.
The positive and negative control samples are derived from human samples.
The positive controls were prepared by diluting celiac positive patient serum
sample to give results above cut-off for applicable analytes and negative
control was prepared by diluting normal human serum sample to give results
below cut-off for all four analytes. Expected results for each applicable
analyte of each control are provided in the Certificate of Analysis.
b. Antigen
The DGP peptides are a mix of custom sequences, which are conjugated and
then lyophilized. Upon receipt, the Certificate of Analysis is confirmed and
an incoming acceptance test is performed using an HPLC method to verify the
purity and consistency of the peptides.
The tTG is recombinant tissue transglutaminase in a buffer solution. The
Certificate of Analysis is verified upon receipt of the material and incoming
acceptance testing confirms protein concentration, content, and characteristics
using Bradford Protein Assay, Western Blot and SDS-Page methods,
respectively.
c. Reporter mix
The reporter mix is comprised of fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies,
Mouse anti-human IgG- Cy5; goat anti-human IgA: Cy3. The same dyes are
used for anti-DGP and anti-tTG, but different capture spots in the microarray
are analyzed to provide the results for each of the four analytes.

--- Page 13 ---
ii. Hook Effect:
High positive samples were selected and tested at a starting dilution of 1:51.
Therefore, since the assay’s dilution as per package insert is 1:151, at least three
fold higher values can be achieved. All of the samples were serially diluted to
evaluate any hook effect in the assays.
It was observed that the results were above the assay’s reportable range, therefore,
during this development study, a manual analysis was performed to see how high
above the reportable range the actual values were. The instrument saturated at
>200 U/mL for DGP IgG and IgA, so no hook effect was detected. No hook
effect was detected at 1354 U/mL for tTG IgA and 835 U/mL for tTG IgG.
iii. Stability:
a. Sample stability - The sponsor provided data supporting a claim of 1 week
stability at 2-8°C.
b. Shelf life stability - the sponsor provided data supporting a claim of 6 months
stability when stored according to the package insert.
c. Open-vial stability - The directions for use state that the kit is single-use only;
therefore, open vial stability is not applicable.
d. Detection limit:
i. Limit of Blank (LoB):
Sample diluent from the kit was tested in replicates of seventy three (73) on one
kit to determine the software-derived values for each analyte. Values are
reported in fluorescence intensity units. All measurements are below the
bottom of the AMR.

instruments to determine the software-derived LoD values for each analyte.
For analytes, where some replicates reported numerical values, the probability

Bias was calculated based on the expected value and mean, SD and %CV
were calculated for each sample. The claimed LoQs meet the manufacturer’s

This information is contained in the Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity section.
ii. Interference
This study was performed according to the recommendations in CLSI EP7-A2,
Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry, Approved Guideline. Eight celiac
positive samples (from the SQI Diagnostics’ Sample Bank) and one normal
(negative sample) were included in the study in order to report two levels per
analyte.
The individual specimens were spiked with three concentrations of the
interferents, starting at the maximum concentration and titering down to low
levels. The samples were assayed in replicates of n=5 for control and for un-
spiked, and the mean result reported. Interference was calculated as the analyte
recovery in the presence of interferent, relative to the measurement of the analyte

f. Assay cut-off:
Specimens from 110 celiac diagnosed patients, 126 normal donors and 56 other
autoimmune diseases (total =292) were collected from commercial sources and
collaborative laboratories representative of North American and European
populations. Specimens were tested according to standard procedure, and all
specimens were assayed in duplicate on separate kits using two lots of assay kits
on two different sqid-X instruments for the determination of mean values. These
samples were not used in any other validation assays. The samples and

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
229 positive celiac patient samples and 150 non-celiac disease samples including
presumptively normal samples were assayed with the Ig_plex Celiac DGP Panel and
with the available predicates’ ELISA method for each of the analytes. The celiac
patient samples were classified using the following characteristics: 147 samples from
celiac diagnosed, biopsy confirmed patients, 27 Endomysial Antibody (EMA)
positive pediatric patient samples, 45 EMA positive adult patient samples, nine celiac
diagnosed without additional information, and one IgA deficient celiac sample. The
non-celiac samples included 132 presumptively normal samples and 18 other
autoimmune disease samples. The sponsor analyzed the discrepant samples around
the cut-off; the majority that were positive in the Ig_plex assays were Celiac-biopsy
positive.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and specificity:
The study included 378 samples, collected from the following groupings: 128 celiac
diagnosed by Marsh III criteria, biopsy confirmed, and 250 samples from other non-
celiac autoimmune diseases. Samples were assayed according to the Ig_plex Celiac
DGP Panel Instructions for Use. Clinical sensitivity was calculated from celiac
disease patients. Clinical specificity was calculated for each disease subgroup and
the overall specificity for the total of non-celiac disease patients and normal subject
samples were also calculated.
The sample distribution included both pediatric and adult subjects:

N. Instrument Name:
sqid-X system
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Semi-automated: All sample handling and preparation is performed by the user, and adds
reagents to each well. The instrument incubates, washes, scans and analyzes the results.
The sqid-X software provides processing instructions and analysis which are configured
for the Ig_plex Celiac DGP Panel.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____x____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Each 96-well plate has a barcode. The user types the sample information into the
computer file.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The system uses graphical user interface software to lead the operator through manual
sample, reagent, and plate handling operations. The system controls the washer to ensure
that the same wash programs are used every time and in the correct sequence. Once the
assay’s biochemical reactions are complete and the plate is placed in the scanner, the
instrument automatically performs a multi-wavelength fluorescent scan of each well in
the microarray, analyzes the data, and generates a report containing results for all assay
markers. Results for each patient sample are obtained simultaneously for each of the four

Ig_plex Celiac DGP Panel markers: DGP IgA, DGP IgG, tTG IgA and tTG IgG using the
data from one well containing one sample of the patient’s serum. The system does not
interpret the results with respect to diagnosis; it reports each result independently. The
sqid-X system also includes numerous internal quality checks.
5. Calibration:
The assay has eight calibrators/standards that are aliquoted into specific wells of the 96-
well plate. These wells do not have the microarray of antigens/controls that are in the
sample wells.
6. Quality Control:
In addition to the results calculation, a set of internal quality control rules are invoked to
evaluate the data that is produced. These rules were identified by safety and hazard
analysis to mitigate risks such as general failures in the reaction. They include quality
control rules for checking the fitness of the standardization curves, as well as thresholds
of controls measuring reporter activity. When data is found that does not fit the required
control levels or rules, further processing of the data is halted and the value “No Result”
is reported. The internal quality control rules, or invalidation rules, are at each level of
data processing. Single analyte results in a well may be invalidated due to high CV of the
replicate capture spots; results for an entire well may be invalidated due to failing to meet
a control threshold, and all results for an analyte on a plate may be invalidated due to an
improper standard curve.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not applicable.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
