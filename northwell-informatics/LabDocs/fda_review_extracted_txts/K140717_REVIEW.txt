I. Device Description:
The CLINITEK Novus system is a fully automated urine chemistry analyzer that is designed
for use with the CLINITEK Novus 10 Urinalysis Cassette which contains reagent test pads
organized in strips on a test card format. The system measures urine Bilirubin, Blood,
Glucose, Ketone, Leukocytes, Nitrite, pH, Protein, and Urobilinogen, Specific Gravity,
Color, and Clarity. The CLINITEK Novus system is a batch urine analyzer that can test up
to 20 sample racks of 10 samples each. The system also has STAT testing capabilities.
Sample identification is accomplished using appropriately barcoded tubes and an internal
barcode reader. The sampling mechanism pipettes a small quantity of urine onto each test
pad of the test card and onto the SG sensor for the measurement of specific gravity and
clarity. Rinse cycles are automatically performed between each patient sample. Reflectance
measurements from the sampled pads are converted to results that are displayed on the
instrument, or may be sent to a printer or laboratory information system (LIS). The Novus
reports qualitative and semi-quantitative values for the test pad parameters and uses a
refractometer to measure specific gravity.
The calibration process uses a 3-point calibration, including baseline adjustments for each
test pad, clarity, and the SG measurement. The CLINITEK Novus Calibration Kit contains
four solutions that are used for calibrating the SG sensor, clarity, and reflectance. The
system also performs a cleaning cycle and dry pad calibration.

L. Test Principle:
The CLINITEK Novus analyzer utilizes an optical system that has a complementary metal
oxide semiconductor (CMOS) digital imager. The concentration of each analyte is measured
by the color change that develops when a sample is deposited on a test pad. The imager
records the color and intensity of the light reflected off the reacted test pads, which are
illuminated by two pairs of LED lights. The optical system converts this data into measured
values for the analytes.
Specific gravity is determined by the fiber optic refractive index method. The SG sensor
measures the amount of light passing through the fiber optic at one end. Because the
refractive index is proportional to specific gravity, the light measured correlates to the
specific gravity of the sample yielding a quantitative result. To determine urine clarity, light
is projected into the sample via a series of optical fibers. The quantities of transmitted and
scattered light are correlated to the clarity of the sample.
A chemical reaction between the analytes in the urine and each test pad on the CLINITEK
Novus 10 Urinalysis Cassette causes a change in color that is used to determine the
concentration of the following urine analytes: bilirubin, blood, glucose, leukocytes, nitrite,
pH, protein, color and urobilinogen. The chemical reactions are described below:

Analyte Test Principle
Bilirubin Based on the coupling of bilirubin with diazotized dichloroaniline in a
strongly acid medium.
Blood Based on the peroxidase-like activity of hemoglobin, which catalyzes the
reaction of diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide and 3,3’,5,5’-
tetramethylbenzidine.
Glucose Based on a double sequential enzyme reaction. One enzyme, glucose
oxidase, catalyzes the formation of gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide
from the oxidation of glucose. A second enzyme, peroxidase, catalyzes
the oxidative coupling of 4-amino-antipyrine and 4-methylcatechol by
hydrogen peroxide.
Ketone Based on the reaction of nitroprusside with acetoacetic acid.
Leukocytes Granulocytic leukocytes contain esterases that catalyze the hydrolysis of
the derivatized pyrrole amino acid ester to liberate 3-hydroxy-5-phenyl
pyrrole. This pyrrole then reacts with a diazonium salt.
Nitrite Based upon the conversion of nitrate (derived from the diet) to nitrite by
the action of Gram negative bacteria in the urine. At the acid pH of the
test area, nitrite in the urine reacts with ρ-arsanilic acid to form a
diazonium compound. This diazonium compound in turn couples with
1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo(h)quinolin-3-ol.
pH Based on a double indicator principle that gives a broad range of colors
covering the entire urinary pH range.
Protein Based on the protein-error-of-indicators principle. At a constant pH, the
presence of protein causes a change in the color of the indicator.
Urobilinogen Based on the Ehrlich reaction in which ρ-diethylaminobenzaldehyde in
conjunction with a color enhancer reacts with urobilinogen in a strongly
acid medium.
Color Color is determined by comparing a specific non-reactive test pad to the
same pad wetted with the urine sample. The reflectance of the wet pad is
compared to the reflectance of the dry pad.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated at one site using three CLINITEK Novus analyzers and a
single lot of Novus Cassettes for ten days, two runs each day, two replicates per run,
on each of the three analyzers for each sample (N = 120). Test samples consisted of
three commercially available urinalysis controls: a negative control, a low-mid
positive control, and a high-positive control. The two positive controls were diluted
and spiked in order to cover the test pad measuring range of each analyte. The
targeted output blocks are shown below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The percent recovery for each analyte was evaluated using a negative urine pool that
was spiked with known concentrations of each analyte at each color block increment
on the Novus 10 Cassette. Leukocytes were tested in low specific gravity urine
(< 1.015) as well as in a buffer with a high specific gravity (1.016 – 1.021) because
leukocytes are not stable in contrived urine samples with high specific gravity
(>1.015). All samples were tested on an FDA cleared urine analyzer to confirm the

support the following sponsor’s stability claims:
CLINITEK Novus 10 Urinalysis Cassettes:
Shelf-life Stability: The CLINITEK Novus 10 Urinalysis Cassettes are stable for 52
weeks when stored at temperatures between 16o C and 30o C.
Onboard Stability: The CLINITEK Novus 10 Urinalysis Cassettes are stable up to 14
days when opened and in use on the analyzer.
CLINITEK Novus Calibrator Kit:
Shelf-life claims: Un-opened calibrators can be stored at 2-8°C until the expiration date
or for 18 months.
Open-vial claims: The recommended storage condition for in-use calibrators is 2-8 °C
and is stable for 18 months after opening. Labeling indicates not to freeze the calibrator
materials.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering substance studies were performed to evaluate the effect of potential
interferents on test results of the urine chemistry test strips. Testing was performed using
two human urine samples with analyte concentrations of negative and low positive,
respectively, and spiked with interferents. Samples were tested in replicates of 12, and
interference was defined as a change in output of ±1 color block in comparison to the
unspiked control sample. For pH, interference was defined as a change of ± 2 color
blocks between the spiked and unspiked control sample.
The substances tested at the highest concentration listed below did not interfere with
the measurement of any of the CLINITEK Novus analytes:

from the substances tested.
*The high specific gravity of a sample acts by inhibiting the color development of the
leukocyte reagent by decreasing the activity of the esterase from leukocyte cells. The
CLINITEK Novus uses an algorithm intended to partially compensate for the
negative impact a high specific gravity sample has on the color development.
pH Interference:
Urine samples were evaluated at increased pH of >9.0. Alkaline urine with a pH
value of > 9.0 did not demonstrate interfering effects on any of the test analytes.
Specific Gravity interference:
Literature was cited for known interferents with specific gravity (SG) test results.
The labeling states the following: Measurement of specific gravity by refractometry
may be influenced by high levels of urinary glucose and protein which can cause
under-estimation of the actual specific gravity.

Carryover:
Carryover studies were performed to assess the amount of sample carried over by the
CLINITEK Novus analyzer from one specimen reaction into subsequent specimen
reactions. Results of the carryover testing for the urine chemistry analytes
demonstrated no detectable carryover by the CLINITEK Novus analyzer.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Patient urine samples were collected and evaluated at three clinical sites comparing
the results from the CLINITEK Novus to the CLINITEK Atlas. A total of 2773
specimens consisting of fresh, refrigerated, and frozen samples were analyzed on the
candidate and predicate devices for the following analytes: bilirubin, blood,
creatinine, glucose, ketone, leukocytes, nitrite, pH, urobilinogen and specific gravity.
The results for overall percent agreement and within one level agreement are
summarized in the tables below.

An additional method comparison study for pH was performed using a pH meter as
the comparator to support the accuracy of samples with pH ≥8.0. Confirmatory pH
Meter results from 514 specimens that recovered pH≥8.0 on the CLINITEK
Atlas analyzer were used in the calculations. The correlation between the Novus
and pH meter showed a 79.4% exact agreement and a 98.1% within one level
agreement for pH measurement.
Specific Gravity Method Comparison:
The specific gravity results obtained on the CLINITEK Novus were compared to the
specific gravity results obtained on the CLINITEK Atlas. The test range of the
samples used for the specific gravity method comparison was: 1.000 to 1.095. The
Deming regression analysis is summarized in the table below:

Combined 1993 y=1.020x-0.019, R2 = 0.983
Color and Clarity Method Comparison
The accuracy of the CLINITEK Novus urine color detection was evaluated by
comparing color results from the Novus to the Data Color Mercury 2000, a reference
method traceable to the International Color Consortium. Color samples were
prepared using non-colored (clear) pooled human urine samples (SG = 1.006 and
pH = 6.7) by adding pigments to produce four samples each of the five CLINITEK
Novus block output colors of yellow, dark yellow, orange, red, and green. Each of
the colored urine samples was read using three Novus analyzers and the DataColor
Mercury 2000. The DataColor Mercury 2000 measurements were converted to HSV
color coordinates. The DataColor hue data was compared to the color well to assign
color labels to each sample that aligns with the block outputs of the CLINITEK
Novus. The results are summarized in the correlation chart below:

The CLINITEK Novus accuracy in determining urine clarity was evaluated by
comparing the clarity results obtained by the device to visually read urine
samples. A total of 48 urine samples were obtained with equal distribution across
the three categories: clear, cloudy, and turbid. Clarity was read visually by one
operator. Samples were then tested for clarity on each of three Novus analyzers.
Results from the visual read and analyzer were compared and the results are

3. Specimen Identification:
An internal barcode reader scans the barcode labels on the sample tubes in the racks or
sample identification may be entered manually using the touch screen keyboard.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The CLINITEK Novus system can analyze multiple samples. The sample pipette
aspirates a sample from the sample tube and dispenses sample onto each test pad.
5. Calibration:
The system uses four liquid calibration solutions to perform a calibration reflectance
check. The calibrators have a fixed value with no lot specific values. A calibration must
be performed when a new lot of reagent cassette is loaded onto the system or a new
cassette of the same lot is loaded and the calibration is older than 24 hours.
6. Quality Control:
Recommendations for testing quality control are in the labeling. The sponsor
recommends that laboratories routinely test at least two levels (negative/low and positive)
of an appropriate commercially available control to confirm performance of the urinalysis
cassette. Controls may also be randomly placed in each batch of samples tested. Each
laboratory should establish its own goals for acceptable standards of performance, and
should question handling and testing procedures if these standards are not met.
P. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
Q. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
