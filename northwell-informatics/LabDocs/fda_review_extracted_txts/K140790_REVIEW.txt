The Dimension Vista Magnesium Flex reagent cartridge (MG) is an in vitro diagnostic
test for the quantitative measurement of magnesium in human serum, plasma and urine
on the Dimension Vista® System. Magnesium measurements are used in the diagnosis
and treatment of hypomagnesemia (extremely low levels of magnesium) and
hypermagnesemia (abnormally high levels of magnesium).
The Dimension Vista Chemistry 1 Calibrator (CHEM 1 CAL) is an in vitro diagnostic
product for the calibration of Calcium (CA), Cholesterol (CHOL), Creatinine
(CREA/CRE2), Glucose (GLU), Lactic Acid (LA), Magnesium (MG), Thyroxine (T4),
Thyroxine Uptake (TU), Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and Uric Acid (URCA) methods
on the Dimension Vista® System.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
All performance studies were conducted using the Dimension Vista 1500 Analyzer
System
I. Device Description:
The Dimension Vista® Magnesium Flex® reagent cartridge (MG) consists of 12 reagent
wells. Wells 1-6 contain liquid 0.0528 g/L methyl-thymol blue, acetic acid and potassium
sorbate; wells 7-12 contain liquid 0.5mM Ba-EGTA, sodium metaborate, buffer and
microbial inhibitors. The Dimension Vista® Magnesium Flex® reagent cartridge has been
previously cleared in k061655 and there is no formulation or packaging change for the Mg
assay.
The Dimension Vista Chemistry 1 Calibrator (CHEM 1 CAL) is a liquid, frozen multi-
analytes, bovine serum albumin based product used to calibrate blood urea nitrogen, calcium,
cholesterol, creatinine, glucose, lactic acid, magnesium, thyroxine, thyroxine uptake and uric
acid. The calibrator consists of two different concentrations of analytes, calibrator A and
calibrator B. The kit consists of six 2.3 ml. vials, three vials of Calibrator A and three vials of
Calibrator B.
The only change to the calibrator is the value assignment to the calibrator A for Mg assay is
no longer available because the calibration scheme of Mg is to use system water as the first
calibrator instead of using calibrator A. Calibrator B is still required for the calibration
scheme of the Mg assay.
There is no change to the formulation, packaging or analyte content for the CHEM 1 CAL;
the only change is the value assignment value for the Mg analyte was removed from
calibrator A.

L. Test Principle:
The Dimension Vista® MG Flex® reagent cartridge uses a modified methyl-thymol blue
(MTB) complexometric technique. MTB forms a blue complex with magnesium. Calcium
interference is minimized by forming a complex between calcium and Ba-EGTA (chelating
agent). The amount of MGMTB complex formed is proportional to the magnesium
concentration and is measured using a bi-chromatic (600 and 510 nm) endpoint technique.

included three levels of serum based control material (Serum Control Level 1, 2 and
3), two human serum sample pools (Serum Pool 1 and 2), one level of urine based
control material (Urine Level 1 Control) and one human urine sample pool (Urine
Pool 1). Each sample was tested in 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 20 days for
a total of 80 replicates. Results from the precision study are summarized in the table
as follows:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated for the Dimension Vista® MG Flex® reagent cartridge
method using 9 equally spaced serum and urine samples which spanned the assay
range. The individual samples were prepared by blending samples with high and low
magnesium concentration across the measurement range as described in CLSI
Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures (EP06-A).
Results of the linearity study are summarized in the table below.

Urine y=0.99x + 0.06 0.99 0.3-11.4 mg/dL
The linearity study supports the claimed measuring range of the assay of 0.3-10.0
mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The assigned values of the Dimension Vista® MG assay calibrator is
traceable to NIST SRM929A reference material and was previously cleared in

k061838. Level 2 (Calibrator B) of the Chemistry 1 Calibrator has an assigned value
of 21.1 mg/dL for magnesium. All the assigned values for the other analytes are the
same in k061838.
Stability of the Dimension Vista® Magnesium Flex® reagent cartridge was
established in k051087. Stability of the Dimension Vista Chemistry 1 Calibrator was
established in k061838.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of the Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation
(LoQ) were established following the CLSI guideline EP17- A2: Evaluation of
Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved
Guideline—Second Edition. Studies were performed in the following manner:
To calculate the Limit of Blank (LoB), 4 analyte free samples were measured in
replicates of five for three days using two reagent lots on one Dimension Vista
analyzer. To estimate the Limit of Detection (LOD), 4 samples containing low levels
of magnesium were measured in replicates of five for three days using two reagent
lots and one Dimension Vista Analyzer.
To estimate the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ), six samples containing low levels of
magnesium were measured in replicates of five for five days using two reagent lots on
one Dimension Vista analyzer.
The detection limits results are summarized as follows:
Serum Urine
mg/dL mg/dL
LoB 0.2 0.2
LoD 0.3 0.3
LoQ 0.3 0.3
The detection limit studies support the claimed measuring range of 0.3-10 mg/dL
e. Analytical specificity:
The Dimension Vista® Magnesium Flex® reagent cartridge was evaluated for
interferences according to CLSI EP7-A2 Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry;
Approved Guideline - Second Edition. Specificity was tested using serum pools at
three levels of magnesium, approximately 1.8, 4.4 and 6.0 mg/dL. Bias is the
difference in the results between the control sample (without interferent) and the test
sample (contains interferent) expressed in percent. Bias exceeding 10% is considered
significant interference by the sponsor. The highest concentration of interference
tested that did not cause significant interference is summarized in the table below.

An additional interference study was conducted using urine samples. Urine samples

Bias is the difference between in the results between the control sample (without
interferent) and the test sample (contains interferent) expressed in percent. Bias

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison testing was conducted using the Dimension Vista ® Magnesium
Flex® reagent cartridge versus the Beckman AU Magnesium assay (k981743). A
total of 114 serum and 125 lithium heparin plasma samples were evaluated using the
Dimension® MG Flex® reagent cartridge (predicate device) and the Beckman AU
Magnesium assay (reference device). Less than 10% of the total samples were altered.
In an additional study, 99 urine samples were tested using the Dimension Vista® MG
Flex reagent cartridge versus the Beckman AU Magnesium assay. All urine samples
were native.

Regression results for the Dimension Vista Flex Reagent Cartridge vs. Beckman AU
Magnesium assay are summarized in the table below:
Sample type n Sample range Slope Intercept R

Plasma
Urine 99 1.5-9.3 1.05 0.09 0.9950
Results obtained from the serum samples correlate well around the medical decision
range (< 4.5 mg/dL); however results above 4.5 mg/dL start to show some scatter.
However, the scatter that is seen in that part of the assay range is clinically
insignificant.

Serum, lithium heparin plasma and urine samples are acceptable to be used with this
assay. Please refer to the method comparison studies in M.2.a. above.

b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
