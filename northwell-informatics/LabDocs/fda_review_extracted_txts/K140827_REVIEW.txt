L. Test Principle:
The SD A1cCare System is based on immunoassay technology. Chemical and immune-
reactions that occur in the test panel are measured by an optical system in the analyzer, which
is a reflectometer.
A code chip provides the analyzer the lot-specific characteristics of the test panel packaged
with the code chip.
A whole blood sample is collected and prepared by adding it to a buffer solution and mixing
it with a latex-tablet, which contains blue microspheres conjugated with a hemoglobin-
specific antibody. During this preparation process, the erythrocytes are lysed to release the
glycated hemoglobin (hereafter HbA1c).
The test panel is inserted into the analyzer. Next the blood mixture is introduced into the
sample port of the test panel. The blood mixture fluid migrates along the channel in the test
panel. HbA1c bound to the blue conjugate in the mixture is captured at the HbA1c Assay
Zone Test Line by the anti-HbA1c antibody immobilized on the membrane of the test panel.
The HbA1c LED illuminates the HbA1c Assay Zone Test Line and the HbA1c Detector
measures the reflected light. The amount of blue conjugates captured at the HbA1c Assay
Zone Test Line reflects the amount of HbA1c in the sample.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated according to CLSI EP06-A. The linearity of the SD A1cCare
System was verified using 11 K EDTA venous whole blood samples from patients
2
with and without diabetes covering the assay range. All dilutions were analyzed once
on 5 analyzers using a total of 3 test kit lots. The mean observed % HbA1c value was
determined for each dilution and plotted versus the relative analyte concentration
(approximately 3.8, 4.7, 6.2, 7.4, 8.5, 9.7, 10.5 11.8, 13.1, 14.5, and 15.4 % for each
test type). The linear regression is as follows:
Slope Y-intercept R R2
Lot 1 0.9925 0.2313 0.9977 0.9955
Lot 2 0.9956 0.1465 0.9972 0.9945
Lot 3 0.9873 0.2221 0.9970 0.9941
The study supports the sponsor’s claimed linearity range of 4.0-15% HbA1c for the
SD A1cCare System using the Spoit Type Test Kit.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The SD A1cCare System for use with the Spoit Type Test Kit is certified with the
National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). The NGSP
certification expires in one year. See NGSP website for current certification at
http://www.ngsp.org.
Value Assignment:

variability within close tolerances. Expected values are as follows:
Control Level Concentration Range
Level 1 4.3 – 6.7
Level 2 7.5 – 11.5
Level M 6.0 – 8.6
Calibration:
Calibration is obtained by using a calibration code chip. The master calibration card is
traceable to International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) reference
materials. Each kit contains a calibration code chip.
Stability:
Real time stability studies for the SD A1cCare Analyzer are ongoing.
Real time stability protocols for the SD A1cCare Spoit Type Test Kit were reviewed
and support a shelf life claim at 34-86°F (1-30°C) and 10-90% R.H. for 18 months.
Real time and accelerated stability protocols were reviewed and support a shelf life
claim for the SD HbA1c Control Set (Level 1 and 2) and SD HbA1c Control Level M
at 1-30°C and 10-90% R.H. for 18 months.
The sponsor tested sample stability for venous whole blood collected in K EDTA,
2
Sodium/Lithium Heparin, and Sodium Fluoride tubes as well as for capillary whole
blood samples. Venous blood samples can be used for testing on the SD A1cCare
System for up to 8 hours when stored at room temperature (20-25°C) or up to 3 days
when stored at 1-4°C. Capillary blood samples should be used for testing within 3
minutes after collection.
d. Detection limit:
The claimed measuring range of 4.0-15.0% HbA1c for the SD A1cCare System is based
on linearity. See section 1b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was performed to assess common or known endogenous and
exogenous substances that could interfere with the SD A1cCare System. The potential
interferents listed below were spiked into K EDTA venous whole blood samples
2
with different levels of % HbA1c (5.3% and 9.1%). The % HbA1c values of the
spiked samples were compared to reference samples (samples containing no
interferent). Samples were tested in quadruplicate and non-significant interference

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not Applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not Applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor states the following in the Spoit Type Test Kit package insert:
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommendations are summarized in the
following table:
% HbA1c Glycemic Goal
< 8% (64mmol/mol) Less stringent
< 7% (53mmol/mol) General (Non-pregnant Adults)
< 6% (48mmol/mol) More stringent
HbA1c values above 6.5% HbA1c (48mmol/mol) are an indication of hyperglycemia
during the preceding 2 to 3 months or longer. According to the recommendations of the
ADA, AbA1c values above 6.5% HbA1c (48 mmol/mol) are suitable for the diagnosis of
diabetes mellitus. Patients with HbA1c values in the range of 5.7-6.4% HbA1c (39-
46mmol/mol) may be at risk of developing diabetes.
