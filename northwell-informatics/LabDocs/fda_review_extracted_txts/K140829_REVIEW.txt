quantitative determination of hemoglobin A1c concentration in human whole blood.
The A1c3 and Hb3 values generated as part of the HbA1c3 assay are intended for use in
the calculation of the A1c3/Hb3 ratio and must not be used individually.
Measurement of hemoglobin A1c is accepted as a method to measure long-term glucose
control in patients with diabetes mellitus.
Special conditions for use statement(s):
· For Prescription use Only
· This assay is designed only for the measurement of mmol/mol HbA1c (IFCC) and
%HbA1c (NGSP). The individual results for Hb and A1c concentration should
not be reported.
· Do not use this test for the screening or diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.
Performance characteristics for this use have not been determined.
· This assay is not useful in evaluating day-to-day glucose control and should not
be used to replace daily home testing of glucose.
· Caution should be exercised when interpreting the HbA1c results from patients
with hemolytic disease or other conditions characterized by shortened erythrocyte
survival, acute blood loss and iron deficiency.
· Erythrocytes in a whole blood sample will settle over time. An inaccurate result
could be produced from an unmixed whole blood sample.
· Samples containing >10% HbF may result in lower than expected HbA1c results
· Specimens with elevated Erythrocyte Sedimentation (ESR) may generate
inaccurate results. The hemolysate should be manually prepared and assayed for
HbA1c3 using “OTHER” as sample type.

L. Test Principle:
The Hb3 reagent is used to measure total hemoglobin concentration by a colorimetric
method. The analyzer system automatically proportions the appropriate sample and reagent
volumes in to the cuvette. The ratio used is one part samples to 8.6 parts reagent. The system
monitors the change in absorbance at 410 nm. This change in absorbance is directly
proportional to the concentration of total hemoglobin in the sample and is used by the system
to calculate and express total hemoglobin concentration.
The A1c3 reagent is used to measure the hemoglobin concentration by a turbidimetric
immunoinhibition method. In the reaction, hemoglobin A1c antibodies combine with
hemoglobin A1c from the sample to form soluble antigen-antibody complexes. Polyhaptens
from the reagent then bind with the excess antibodies and the resulting agglutinated complex
is measured turbidimetrically. Change in absorbance is measured at 340 nm. This change in
absorbance is inversely proportional to the concentration of hemoglobin A1c in the sample
and is used by the analyzer system to calculate and express hemoglobin A1c concentration as
a ratio of total hemoglobin.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed according to CLSI EP05-A2. Within-run and Total
precision were evaluated by testing a low and high whole blood commercial control.
Three individual human whole blood samples at low, mid and high levels were also
evaluated. Each sample was assayed in duplicate, twice a day over the course of
twenty working days (n=80) on the Unicel DxC 600 and 800 SYNCHRON Systems
analyzers.

precision of the UniCel DxC Synchron Systems Hemoglobin A1c3 Reagent on the
UniCel DxC 600 and 800 SYNCHRON systems analyzers for samples with elevated

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated according to CLSI EP-06A. A series of thirteen analyte
concentrations, covering the measuring range of the assay, were prepared by inter-
mixing a high (18.8 %) and low (3.4 %) HbA1c sample. Each dilution was assayed
in quadruplicate on the UniCel DxC 600 and 800 SYNCHRON Systems analyzers.
Sample range tested was between 3.4 -18.8% HbA1c. The results from regression
analysis between the target values and the measured values are summarized below:

UniCel DxC 800 SYNCHRON Systems y=0.984x+0.052, r=0.999
The results of the linearity study support the claimed measuring range of 4-17%

Systems Hemoglobin (HbA1c3) assay is certified with the National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP). The NGSP certification expires one year from the
certification date. See NGSP website for current certification http://www.ngsp.org.
Two different units of measure are provided to the customers. NGSP equivalent units
(%) and IFCC equivalent units (mmol/mol).
Stability-The UniCel DxC Synchron Systems HbA1c (HbA1c3) calibrators are stable
until the expiration date printed on the calibrator bottle if stored unopened at 2°C to
8°C. Reconstituted calibrators are stable for 8 hours stored at 15°C to 25°C, or 48
hours stored at 2°C to 8°C unless the expiration date is exceeded. Calibrators that are
aliquoted immediately after reconstitution and stored at -15°C to 20°C are stable for
60 days. Frozen calibrators should be thawed only once.
Calibrator value assignment- calibrator values are lot specific values which are
assigned using multiple analyzers and multiple runs over several days. The data
generated provides set points for use on the UniCel DxC 600/800 SYNCHRON
Systems platforms. Once the calibration set points are established on the analyzers;
principal samples (IFCC calibrators, IFCC controls, freshly prepared test calibrators,
and NGSP traceable samples to cover the NGSP range) are analyzed in several
replicates and must meet the sponsor’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.
Controls- the sponsor recommends the use of any commercially available control for
HbA1c. Alternatively, the user may use the Canterbury Scientific extendSURE ®
Hemoglobin A1c Liquid Controls previously cleared in k043070.
d. Detection limit:
The claimed measuring range of 4.0-17.0% HbA1c for the Unicel DxC 600 and 800
SYNCHRON Systems analyzers, is based on linearity. See 1b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
i.) Endogenous Interference
Interference studies were performed to assess common or known substances that
could potentially interfere with the Unicel DxC Synchron Systems Hemoglobin A1c3
(HbA1c3) assay. The potential interfering substances were evaluated using human
EDTA whole blood sample pools at three HbA1c concentrations (5%, 7% and 10%).
Each sample was spiked with the potential interferant and tested in quadruplicate to
give a total of four replicates per sample on the UniCel DxC 600 and 800
SYNCHRON Systems analyzers. The % HbA1c values of the spiked samples were
compared to reference samples (samples containing no interferent). The sponsor
defined non- significant interference as the % recovery +/- 6%.
7

--- Page 8 ---
The sponsor claims there is no significant interference by the following substances:
· Unconjugated Bilirubin up to 30 mg/dL
· Triglycerides (Intralipid) up to 1000 mg/dL
· Rheumatoid Factor up to 2000 IU/mL
· Ascorbic Acid 50 mg/dL
ii.) Cross Reactivity
Potential Interference from from HbA0, HbA1(a+b), acetylated hemoglobin HbA0,
glycated albumin and Carbamylated HbA0 were evaluated using EDTA whole blood
samples with HbA1c values of ~5%, ~7% and ~10% HbA1c. The sponsor defined
non-significant interference as the % recovery +/- 10%. The results were concluded
as follows:
· HbA0 (up to 600 mg/mL) does not interfere with this assay
· HbA1(a+b) (up to 8 mg/mL) does not interfere with this assay
· Acetylated HbA0 (up to 10 mg/mL) does not interfere with this assay.
· Glycated albumin (up to 50 mg/mL) does not interfere with this assay
· Carbamylated HbA0 (up to 10 mg/mL) does not interfere with this assay.
In addition, interference from Labile glycated hemoglobin was evaluated using
human whole blood samples at three HbA1c concentrations (5%, 7% and 10%
HbA1c). Each sample was spiked with a glucose stock solution and incubated at 37°C
for 5 hours and analyzed in quadruplicate on the UniCel DxC 600 and 800
SYNCHRON System analyzers. The percent difference of the samples with and
without the potential interfering substance was calculated. The sponsor defined non-
significant interference as the % recovery +/- 10%. The results concluded as follows:
· Labile Glycated hemoglobin (up to 2000 mg/dL) does not interfere with this
assay.
iii.) Hemoglobin Variant Interference:
A hemoglobin variant study was performed using commercially available samples
known to contain Hemoglobin variants C, D, E, S, F. These variant samples were
tested on the UniCel DxC 600 and 800 SYNCHRON Systems analyzers using the
UniCel DxC Synchron Systems Hemoglobin A1c3 (HbA1c3) assay. Samples were
analyzed in quadruplicate and compared to the target values which were obtained
using an HPLC reference analyzer. The sponsor defined non-significant interference
as +/- 7% between the candidate method and the reference method for Hemoglobin
variants C, D, E, and S. Non-significant interference was defined as +/- 10% between
the candidate and reference method for HbF.
The testing results indicate there is no significant interference for HbC (≤36.4%),
HbD (≤35.1%), HbE (≤21.7%) and HbS (≤31.9%).
