L. Test Principle:
Dimension® TSHL Cartridge: The TSH method is a homogeneous, sandwich
chemiluminescent immunoassay based on Luminescent Oxygen Channeling Immunoassay
(LOCITM) technology. The LOCITM reagents include two latex bead reagents and a
biotinylated anti-TSH monoclonal antibody fragment. The first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is
coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitizer dye. The second bead reagent
(Chemibeads) is coated with a second anti-TSH monoclonal antibody and contains
chemiluminescent dye. Sample is incubated with biotinylated antibody and Chemibeads to
form bead-TSH-biotinylated antibody sandwiches. Sensibeads are added to bind to the biotin
to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at 680 nm generates
singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a
chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at 612 nm and is a direct
function of the TSH concentration in the sample.

Dimension® FT4L Cartridge: The FT4L method is a homogeneous, sequential,
chemiluminescent immunoassay based on LOCI® technology. The LOCI® reagents include
two synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-T4 mouse monoclonal antibody. The first
bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with triiodothyronine (T3), a naturally occurring,
weaker binding analog of T4, and contains chemiluminescent dye. The second bead reagent
(Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains a photosensitizer dye. In a first step,
sample is incubated with biotinylated antibody which allows T4 from the sample to saturate a
fraction of the biotinylated antibody that is directly related to the free thyroxine (FT4)
concentration. In a second step, T3 Chemibeads are added and form bead/biotinylated
antibody immunocomplexes with the nonsaturated fraction of the biotinylated antibody.
Sensibeads are then added and bind to the biotin to form bead pair immunocomplexes.
Illumination of the complex at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which
diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is
measured at 612 nm and is an inverse function of the FT4 concentration in the sample.

Dimension® TSHL Cartridge: Serum samples were collected at 8 US sites to be
representative of the US population diversity. Data from a total of 407 patients (75
infants, 185 children, and 147 adolescents) on one Dimension EXL with Loci Module
(LM) instrument and two lots of cartridges were analyzed to establish the Dimension®
TSHL assay reference ranges for the studied pediatric population. Results from the 2.5th
to 97.5th percentile were used as the pediatric reference ranges. The reference interval for
the infant group was calculated by performing a log-transformation of the raw data
followed by the application of the robust symmetric method to the transformed data. This
approach was selected to be most appropriate for the smaller sample size as the data from
this population was highly skewed to the right and a transformation was necessary to
obtain a normal distribution. The sponsor has added language to their package insert
explaining the uncertainty in the value for the upper limit of the reference range. A non-
parametric approach was used to establish the reference intervals for children and
adolescents.
Age Range Reference Ranges
Infants (01 – 23 months) 0.867 - 6.43 µIU/mL
Children (02 – 12 years) 0.704 - 4.01 µIU/mL
Adolescents (13 – 20 years) 0.516 - 4.13 µIU/mL

Dimension® FT4L Cartridge: Serum samples were collected at 8 US sites to be
representative of the US population diversity. Data from a total of 411 patients (77
infants, 187 children, and 147 adolescents) one Dimension EXL instrument with LM and
two lots of cartridges were analyzed to establish the Dimension® FT4L assay reference
ranges for the studied pediatric population. Results from the 2.5th to 97.5th percentile
were used as the pediatric reference range.
The reference interval for the infant group was calculated using the robust symmetric
method to accommodate the smaller sample size of this population. A non-parametric
approach was used to establish the reference intervals for children and adolescents.
Age Range Reference Ranges
Infants (01 – 23 months) 0.93 - 1.45 ng/dL
Children (02 – 12 years) 0.82 - 1.40 ng/dL

Confidence intervals for the limits of the infant reference range are as follows:
Lower Limit of reference range Upper Limit of reference
range
90% confidence 0.89 – 0.97 ng/dL 1.41 – 1.50 ng/dL
