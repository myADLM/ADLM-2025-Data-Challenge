L. Test Principle:
Dimension Vista® TSH Cartridge: The TSH method is a homogeneous, sandwich
chemiluminescent immunoassay based on LOCI® technology. The LOCI® reagents include
two synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-TSH monoclonal antibody fragment. The
first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains a photosensitizer dye.
The second bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a second anti- TSH monoclonal
antibody and contains chemiluminescent dye. Sample is incubated with biotinylated antibody
and Chemibeads to form bead-TSH-biotinylated antibody sandwiches. Sensibeads are added
and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at
680 nm generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads,
triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at 612 nm and is a
direct function of the TSH concentration in the sample.
Dimension Vista® FT4 Cartridge: The FT4 method is a homogeneous, sequential,
chemiluminescent immunoassay based on LOCI® technology. The LOCI® reagents include
two synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-T4 mouse monoclonal antibody. The first
bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with triiodothyronine (T3), a naturally occurring,
weaker binding analog of T4, and contains chemiluminescent dye. The second bead reagent
(Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains a photosensitizer dye. In a first step,
sample is incubated with biotinylated antibody which allows T4 from the sample to saturate a
fraction of the biotinylated antibody that is directly related to the free T4 concentration. In a
second step, T3 chemibeads are added and form bead/ biotinylated antibody
immunocomplexes with the non-saturated fraction of the biotinylated antibody. Sensibeads
are then added and bind to the biotin to form bead pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of
the complex at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the
Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at 612
nm and is an inverse function of the FT4 concentration in the sample.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Serum samples were collected at 8 US sites to be representative of the US population
diversity. Data from a total of 421 patients (82 infants, 191 children, and 148 adolescents)
were analyzed on one Dimension Vista 1500 instrument to establish the Dimension Vista
FT4 and TSH assay reference ranges for the studied pediatric population. Two lots of
each cartridge type were used in these studies. Results from the 2.5th to 97.5th percentile
were used as the pediatric reference range.
The TSH reference interval for the infant group was calculated by performing a log-
transformation of the raw data followed by the application of the robust symmetric
method to the transformed data. This approach was selected to be most appropriate for
the smaller sample size as the data from this population was highly skewed to the right
and a transformation was necessary to obtain a normal distribution. The sponsor has
added language to their package insert explaining the uncertainty in the value for the
upper limit of the reference range. A non-parametric approach was used to establish the
reference intervals for children and adolescents.
Age Range Reference Ranges
Infants (01 – 23 months) 0.816 - 5.91 µIU/mL
Children (02 – 12 years) 0.662 - 3.90 µIU/mL
Adolescents (13 – 20 years) 0.463 - 3.98 µIU/mL
Confidence intervals for the limits of the infant reference range are as follows:
Lower Limit of reference range Upper Limit of reference
range
90% confidence 0.683 - 0.962 µIU/mL 5.06 - 7.09 µIU/mL
intervals:
The FT4 reference interval for the infant group was calculated using the robust
symmetric method to accommodate the smaller sample size of this population. A non-
parametric approach was used to establish the reference intervals for children and
adolescents.
