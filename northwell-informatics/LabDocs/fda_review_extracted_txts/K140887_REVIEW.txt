2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in
its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for
use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials.
The labeling for this modification to the subject device has been reviewed to verify that the
indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification.

6. Design Control Activities Summary:
a) The detailed risk management plans for the cobas 4800 system and the cobas CT/NG and cobas
CT/NG v2.0 products are provided in the following documents in the attachments “ cobas 4800
System Release 2.1: Risk Management Plan” (DH-309-009A) and “cobas 4800 System Release
2.1: CT/NG and CT/NG v2.0 Risk Management Plan” (DH-252-022A). Final risk assessments
were performed for the cobas 4800 system and CT/NG tests after hazard analysis and risk
mitigations were completed. Various causes were considered in the risk analysis including human
factors, hardware/software failures, installation/integration failures, and environmental. All
remaining risks were identified to be As Low As Reasonably Possible (ALARP) in the final risk
assessments and the rationale for risk acceptance was documented in the Risk Management
Report.
b) The validation plan stated that the hardware components of the cobas x 480 (sample prep),
cobas z 480 (analyzer), and assay reagents have not changed and therefore no validation was
recommended. The changes to the cobas 4800 software were validated at the unit, component,
and system level. The scope of the system level testing encompassed verification that product
requirements were successfully implemented and that observed anomalies were either corrected
or accepted as known issues with no adverse impact on system performance. Product
requirements were tested to demonstrate that risks had been mitigated. If a particular product
requirement passed testing, then the risk was deemed successfully mitigated. System level risk
mitigation testing was captured within the plans and reports completed for each testing campaign.
All planned system level testing for the cobas 4800 System Core Software Release 2.1 and the
cobas CT/NG and CT/NG v2.0 Analysis Packages was completed successfully.
c) Anomaly reports “cobas 4800 System Release 2.1: Core Anomaly Summary Report” and cobas
4800 System Release 2.1: CT/NG Anomaly Summary Report” identify that anomalies within
each configuration of the cobas 4800 system were acceptable and presented minimal risk to
user, process, or product function. A “Known Issues” list will be distributed to system Users to
address minor anomalies relevant to the user operation of the system.
Rare instances of a channel shift anomaly are reported. This anomaly causes errors in the results
generated by cobas z480 due to a camera anomaly which causes image data to be incorrectly
assigned an optical channel. The mechanism of the channel shift was confirmed to be an extra
image in the camera memory buffer. The cobas z480 Instrument Control (IC) software and the
cobas z480 service software (zSSW) have been updated to detect and prevent creation and
accumulation of extra images in the cobas z480 camera buffer. All test items for the system
verification activities related to the channel shift anomaly are acceptable as presented in “cobas
4800 System Release 2.1: Channel Shift System Verification Report.”
d) Traceability between requirements, identified hazards, and verification and validation testing has
been established using several trace matrices. Gap analysis was performed on each trace matrix
to ensure that each higher-level requirement or specification traces to the next lower level
requirement or specification, and that each requirement or specification also traces to a
verification or validation activity. Identified hazards that are mitigated by implementation of
requirements are traced from the identified risk to the mitigating requirement. The traceability
matrices are updated and maintained throughout the development lifecycle of the cobas 4800
system.
e) The Firm has provided a design control activities summary including the risk management files
for the identification of risk analysis methods used to assess the impact of the modification on the

--- Page 5 ---

devices and their components, and the results of the analysis. The deviations and anomalies
reported in the verification report for the core system were acceptable. The design verification
and validation report (DVVR) for CT/NG v2.0 and CT/NG system verification summary report
were acceptable.
A declaration of conformity with design controls was submitted including:
i) A statement signed by the individual responsible, that, as required by the risk analysis, all
verification and validation activities were performed by the designated individual(s) and the
results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance criteria were met, and
ii) A statement signed by the individual responsible, that the manufacturing facility is in
conformance with design control procedure requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and
the records are available for review.
7. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary or Statement and the Indications for
Use Enclosure.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use
for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular
modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices
demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the
design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the
device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
