L. Test Principle:
The CORA PlateletMapping Assay is an in vitro diagnostic assay used in conjunction with
the CORA System (analyzer). This assay specifically determines the Maximum Amplitude
(MA), a measure of the maximum firmness of the clot during the test. The assay uses
Arachidonic Acid (AA) and/or Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) agonists. Since thrombin
(present in blood samples) is the primary and most potent activator of platelets, its activity
must be inhibited with heparin in order to assess the platelet inhibiting effects of ADP and
AA. Thrombin also converts fibrinogen into fibrin to create the fibrin mesh necessary for any
clot formation, and converts Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa for fibrin cross linking.
Since thrombin has been rendered inactive by heparin, Activator F (ActF) is used to replace
thrombin’s role in the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa.
Thus, with this cross-linked fibrin network as the foundation (represented by MAActF),
additional clot strength due to platelet-fibrin bonding related to ADP (MAADP) and AA
(MAAA) platelet receptor activation can be measured.
The Kaolin with Heparinase (HKH) reagent, a combination of Kaolin and Heparinase,
generates test data for the uninhibited MA (MAK) resulting from thrombin activation of the
blood sample, while the Heparinase neutralizes the effects of heparin.
AA %Aggregation and %Inhibition, and ADP %Aggregation and %Inhibition are parameters
derived from the CORA MA parameters for the ActF, AA, ADP and HKH reagents, as
described above. Following are the equations used by the CORA System with
PlateletMapping Assay Cartridge to derive these parameters:
AA Percent Inhibition = 100 – AA Percent Aggregation, (minimum of 0%)
ADP Percent Inhibition = 100 – ADP Percent Aggregation, (minimum of 0%)
To perform a test, a disposable CORA PlateletMapping Cartridge is inserted into the
instrument. Blood is added to an entry port on the cartridge and drawn into the cartridge
under instrument control. The amount of the sample drawn into the cartridge is automatically
determined by the volume of the blood chambers in the cartridge. Once in the disposable, the
sample is metered into as many as four separate analysis channels, depending upon the assay
being performed. Reconstitution of reagents dried within the cartridge is accomplished by
moving the sample back and forth through reagent chambers, under the control of
microfluidic valves and bellows within the cartridge. After each sample has been mixed with
reagent, it is delivered to a test cell where it is monitored for changes due to coagulation.
Excess sample material is moved under microfluidic control into an enclosed waste chamber
within the cartridge.
The CORA technology is based on a disposable containing up to four independent
measurement cells. Each cell consists of a short vertically-oriented injection molded tube
6

--- Page 7 ---
(ring). Detection of clotting in the CORA System is performed optically. Under control of the
instrument, approximately 20μL of prepared sample is delivered to the tube, where a
meniscus naturally forms at each end of the tube. The tube is positioned so that the lower
meniscus partially blocks light traveling from a collimated source toward a photodiode.
During testing, a piezoelectric actuator drives the measurement cell(s) through a motion
profile composed of summed sinusoids at different frequencies. The resulting motion of the
meniscus is monitored optically and analyzed by the instrument to calculate the resonant
frequency and modulus of elasticity (stiffness) of the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability, Operator-to-Operator Variability, Instrument-to-Instrument Variability
were assessed in one combined study. Three different patient samples were tested for
HKH Precision testing:
· Hypocoagulable (donor with coagulation level of MA parameter near the lower
limit of the reference range)
· Normal (donor with coagulation level of MA parameters near the center of the
reference range)
· Hypercoagulable (donor with coagulation level of MA parameter near the upper
limit of the reference range)
For ADP and AA % Aggregation and % Inhibition Precision testing, the following
sample types were utilized:
· Normal [donor with little or no platelet inhibition, inhibition levels below cut-off
values (ADP Inhibition <17%, AA Inhibition <11%)]
· Abnormal (donor with platelet inhibition levels above cut-off values)
Patient samples were tested in duplicate with each of three reagent lots and six
instruments by two operators. Testing was repeated on each of five non-consecutive
testing days. A new blood draw from each donor was taken on each of the 5 study
days.
For clarity, the testing schematic for each sample and operator, which was completed
on each testing day, is summarized below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Real time and accelerated stability studies were performed in support of a 1-year
stability claim for CORA PlateletMapping reagents. Three months of accelerated
stability testing was performed with a minimum of two lots of each reagent. The
regulatory stability claim is limited to the available real time stability data available at
time of clearance.
Real time stability studies included 3 lots of each reagent. At 6 months and 1 year of
storage at 2-8 ºC, reagent lots were tested with 2 donor samples in quadruplicate and
compared to results generated with one newly manufactured reagent lot. The
allowable 10% degradation from the initial value was not exceeded in the indicated
testing timeframe, thereby supporting a one year shelf life claim for storage at 2-8 ºC.
In use stability: For each reagent type, two cartridges from each of 3 lots were

removed from their foil pouches at each of multiple time-points and stored at ambient
temperature. Cartridges were stored up to 3 hours under in-use conditions prior to
testing. Each cartridge was testing with donor blood in quadruplicate. No significant
difference in performance was observed after the claimed 2 hours of storage under in-
use conditions after removal from the foil pouch.
Transport simulation studies: For each reagent type, 3 lots of reagents were tested for
transport stability using a study design based on International Safe Transit
Association (ISTA) Procedure 7D “Summer Profile” for 72 hour expedited
international airfreight transport. An extended hold at 30 ºC was added to simulate a
total of 7 days instead of 3. The study design is summarized in the table below.
1 Temperature Preconditioning 2-8° C for 24 hours
2 Shock - Drop test Height of drop based on weight of package
3 Temperature Cycle period 1 22° C for 4 hours
4 Vibration Overall G level of 1.15

6 Shock - Drop test Height of drop based on weight of package
7 Temperature cycle period 3 30°C for 152 hours
8 Temperature cycle period 4 35°C for 6 hours
Compared to one lot of reagent stored at the recommended storage conditions of 2-8
ºC, stability of the reagent lots is not impacted by the exposure to the simulated
shipping conditions outlined in the table above.
Sample stability: In order to assess sample stability, five consecutive runs of each of
three patient samples (normal, hypo and hyper) were tested. Blood samples were
tested in quadruplicate at each time point. There is no significant sample deterioration
within 2 hours after sample collection.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were carried out according to CLSI EP 7- A2. The effect on
hemolysis, hemodilution up to 50% and short draw resulting in up to 2 times heparin
concentration were performed for each of the reagents. In addition, the effect of
absence of a discard type and addition of EACA on the HKH MA parameter were
assessed.
Short draw: For each reagent type, five (5) different samples resulting in final heparin
concentrations up to 2 fold were prepared. Each of these samples was tested in
quadruplicate. Interference was observed at heparin concentrations equivalent to
2.5mL whole blood in a 4mL heparin containing tube for the ADP and AA reagent.

Hemodilution: Whole blood was hemodiluted up to 50%. Each of the 5 resulting
samples was tested in quadruplicate. Hemodilution above 40% was determined to
interfere with the HKH and ADP reagent.
Hemolysis: Pooled heparinized blood was split. Half of the blood was hemolyzed ex
vivo. The effect of lysis on testing results was evaluated by testing each sample 8
times. Hemolysis was found to be an interferent for the HKH and AA reagents.
Lack of discard tube: The effect of discard tube omission on HKH reagent testing was
evaluated. In this case, results in the presence and absence of discard tube were
compared. For each condition, 8 replicates were tested. No differences in results were
observed for the HKH MA parameter.
EACA: The antifibrinolytic substance effect the device output. The effect on adding
increasing concentrations of EACA on HKH MA were assessed. Testing was
performed in quadruplicate. No interference was observed for EACA concentrations
up to 600 µg/mL.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off was identified utilizing the references range data of healthy
patients. The value was identified as the 10% probability quantile for both ADP and
AA aggregation. Since inhibition = 100 - aggregation, the inhibition cut-off is based
on the 90% probability quantile for AA and ADP Inhibition.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were conducted at three (3) clinical sites on patient
samples following CLSI EP09-A3 Guideline. The subjects enrolled were patients
undergoing heart surgery or PCI procedures, with blood samples drawn pre- and post-
surgery and in the ICU. Samples were divided and tested with both the CORA
PlateletMapping Assay and the Haemonetics TEG® Platelet Mapping Assay. The
resulting percent agreement [including positive percent agreement (PPA) and
negative percent agreement (NPA)] are summarized below:

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
Due to the low percentage agreement in the method comparison study, an additional
analysis was performed. In this analysis, CORA PlateletMapping assay or the predicate
device output was compared to the clinical evaluation of the patients’ platelet function
status. The presence of normal or abnormal platelet function was determined using the
cut-off of <83 for ADP and <89 for AA for the CORA PlateletMapping assay and <80
for the TEG AA and ADP Platelet Mapping assays. Available clinical history (e.g. types
of clinical procedures and medications a patient has received) was utilized for the clinical

AA Aggregation 89%
Cut-off values were utilized for precision and reader studies for HKH MA parameter. The
boundaries of the reference ranges were used to determine whether samples fall into the
hypercoagulable, normal or hypocoagulable ranges for the HKH-MA parameter. The
following ranges were utilized to select suitable samples for the precision evaluation of
the HKH-MA parameter:
MA Value Range
Hypocoagulable < 42 - 53
Normal 53 - 68
Hypercoagulable 68 - > 71
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Reference Ranges for each reagent-parameter combination were established in 153
healthy individuals according to CLSI C28-A3c. Samples were excluded on a per-
parameter basis using standard outlier criteria. The Minimum and Maximum of the
normal range with the respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) are summarized
in the table below.
