performance. The scope of the software changes is limited to the workstation software
and the hardware changes only impacted the physical connection of the instruments
together. No changes were made in the individual instruments configured in the
workcell. Based on these, limited performance tests were conducted on the most
complex workcell configuration (e.g., model DxH 2401). The performance studies were
conducted at either the Beckman Coulter facility in Miami, Florida or at the London
Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario, Canada.
a. Accuracy:
Measurement Procedures Comparison: Whole Blood
The objective of the study was to verify that whole blood results on the DxH 800 v3.0
meet the bias specifications when compared to the DxH 800 v2.0 predicate. Trueness
was established in accordance with CLSI H26-A2 and EP9-A3.
The study included 333 whole blood specimens distributed across the analytical
measuring interval (AMI). Spent normal and clinical specimens from a
comprehensive and diverse range of hematological conditions with hematological
cellular characteristics at target ranges of the parameters to be tested were used. The
specimens were tested in singlet on the DxH 800 v3.0 and the predicate DxH 800
v2.0 in the CBC/Diff and Reticulocyte (CDR) panel. A minimum of 100 specimens
were tested on each DxH 800 v3.0 instrument in the workcell with the workstation
software determining the specimen routing between instruments.
The regression approach described in CLSI EP9-A3 was used to estimate differences
between the test DxH 800 v3.0 and the predicate DxH 800 v2.0 instruments.
Prior to statistical analysis, the data were inspected for outliers; no outliers were
removed. Parameters flagged with R (Review Flag), or non-numeric results were
excluded from analysis. Exclusions were made at the parameter level not the
specimen level. There were no specimens excluded from the study.
Deming and Weighted Deming approaches were used to estimate the parameters of
the regression model (slope, intercept, their 95% confidence intervals and correlation
coefficient). Weighted Deming was used for counts, i.e., WBC, RBC, PLT, etc.,
since the scatter of the data (variability) was significantly related to the range of
measurements (mean). The Deming approach was used for other parameters, except
BA%. Passing and Bablok regression was used for BA% because the scatter of the
data was not uniform throughout the range and a non-parametric approach was more
appropriate. Bias between methods was calculated from the regression line at the
25th, 50th, and 75th percentile points of the range of the comparator and at medical
decision points. Confidence limits of bias estimates were calculated based on
standard errors of bias and 95% confidence. The upper/lower confidence limits were
compared to the specifications.
8

--- Page 9 ---
The DxH 800 v3.0 is considered to be comparable to the DxH 800 v2.0 predicate if
the upper/lower 95% confidence limit of the difference between the parameter results
obtained from the data set for all other parameters is less than or equal to the
acceptance limits defined. The DxH 800 v3.0 is considered to be comparable to the
DxH 800 v2.0 predicate if the correlation coefficient for NRBC is greater than the
specification.
All results met the acceptance criteria. The whole blood comparability results on the
DxH 800 v3.0 demonstrated acceptable performance against the predicate DxH 800
v2.0.
Measurement Procedures Comparison: Body Fluid
The objective of the study was to verify that body fluid results on the DxH 800 v3.0
meet the bias specifications when compared to the predicate DxH 800 v2.0. Trueness
was established in accordance with CLSI H26-A2 and EP9-A3.
The study included 110 specimens distributed across the AMI with spent body fluid
specimens from a comprehensive and diverse range of hematological conditions
whose body fluid characteristics satisfied the target ranges of the parameters to be
tested. Body fluid specimen was spiked with spent whole blood and whole blood was
diluted with normal saline; all samples were analyzed in the body fluid test mode.
The specimens were comprised of a mixture of the body fluid types (e.g., CSF,
synovial, and serous). The specimens were tested in duplicate on the DxH 800 v3.0
and the predicate DxH 800 v2.0 in the body fluids mode. The specimens were
equally distributed across the three DxH 800 v3.0 instruments within the workcell.
Prior to statistical analysis, the data were inspected for outliers; no outliers were
removed. Individual parameter results for specimens that were below the measuring
range were excluded from analysis. There was one specimen excluded from the
study.
Weighted Deming approaches were used to estimate the parameters of the regression
model (slope, intercept, their 95% confidence intervals, and correlation) since the
scatter of the data (variability) was significantly related to the range of measurements
(mean). Bias between methods was calculated from the regression line at the 25th,
50th, and 75th percentile points of the range of the comparator. Confidence limits of
bias estimates were calculated based on standard errors of bias and 95% confidence.
The upper/lower confidence limits were compared to the specifications.
The DxH 800 v3.0 is considered to be comparable to the DxH 800 v2.0 predicate if
the upper/lower 95% confidence limit of the difference between the parameter results
is less than or equal to the acceptance limits defined.
All results met the acceptance criteria. The body fluid bias results on the DxH 800
v3.0 demonstrated acceptable performance against the predicate DxH 800 v2.0.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Imprecision (Repeatability): Whole Blood
The objective was to verify that the Whole Blood Imprecision (Repeatability) of the
proposed DxH 800 system (v3.0) meets the performance specifications. Imprecision
for Whole Blood was evaluated in accordance with CLSI H26-A2.
Specimens were collected to evaluate repeatability in the lower ranges for WBC,
RBC, and PLT parameters. Where specimens could not be obtained through the
collection of routine spent samples, specimens were manipulated to achieve the target
parameter value prior to testing. At least 5 samples with 10 replicates for each
sample were included in the analysis. Different samples were tested for different
parameters. The specimens were randomly distributed across the three DxH 800 v3.0
instruments in the workcell. Exclusions were made at the parameter level not the
specimen level. Parameter results for specimens having System Messages, System
Status messages and “R” flags were excluded. No specimens were removed from
analysis.
Calculations were performed separately for each parameter. ANOVA was used to
partition sample-to-sample variability from the within sample variability. Test for
homogeneity for each parameter confirmed the pooling of variances. Within sample
variance component estimated the repeatability of the system. Upper 95% confidence
limit of the repeatability variance was calculated using the chi-square distribution.
CV% was calculated by dividing the square roots of variance and its upper limit with
the average of all samples. Upper limit of the repeatability CV% was compared to
the repeatability specification.
The whole blood imprecision (repeatability) results on the DxH 800 v3.0
demonstrated acceptable performance. All the results met the acceptance criteria.
For all parameters, the upper 95% confidence limit was within the specification. The
descriptive statistics, repeatability CV%, upper 95% confidence limits of the
repeatability CV%, acceptance limits, and conclusions are presented below.

Diluted whole blood specimens were prepared such that the BF-TNC and BF-RBC
parameters were within the specified target ranges. At least 5 samples were included
for each target range with 10 replicates tested in the body fluids mode from each
sample. Different specimens were tested for the different parameters. The specimens
were randomly distributed across the three DxH 800 v3.0 instruments in the workcell.
No data was excluded from the analysis.
Calculations were performed separately for each parameter. ANOVA was used to
partition sample-to-sample variability from the within sample variability. Test for
homogeneity for each parameter confirmed the pooling of variances. Within sample

CV% was calculated by dividing the square roots of variance and its upper limit with
the average of all samples. Upper limit of the repeatability CV% was compared to
the repeatability specification.
The body fluids imprecision (repeatability) results on the DxH 800 v3.0 demonstrated
acceptable performance. All the results met the acceptance criteria. For all
parameters, the upper 95% confidence limit was within the specification. The

Linearity: Whole Blood
The objective of the study was to verify that the Whole Blood Linearity of the
proposed DxH 800 system (v3.0) meets the performance specifications. Linearity
evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP06-A.
Linearity was assessed by demonstrating that the reported results are directly
proportional to the concentration of the measurand in a test sample for WBC, RBC,
HGB, and PLT parameters across the analytical measuring range. Testing assessed
whole blood linearity using whole blood and cell control analog samples on the
proposed DxH 800 system (v3.0).
Dilution series were prepared covering the analytical measuring interval for each

parameter. A mixture of whole blood and plasma were used for RBC and HGB and a
mixture of cell control analogs and media were used for WBC and PLT to create the
dilution series. To cover the entire parameter range using a single set of dilutions, the
dilution schemes designed for WBC and PLT included more dilution points in the
lower end of the range. This distribution allowed for higher resolution in the lower
end of the range to capture medical decision points while covering the full range.
Equally spaced dilutions were used for RBC and HGB since their ranges were
relatively narrower and the medical decision levels were captured adequately. All
dilutions were run in quadruplicate on each of the three DxH 800 instruments in the
workcell.
Limits for Linearity (Specifications)
Parameter Range Limit
r2 >0.95 and
0.05 – 2.0 ± 0.1 or ± 10%
WBC
>2.0 – 100.0 ± 0.2 or ± 3%
>100.0 – 400.0 ± 5%
RBC 0.005 – 8.50 r2 >0.95 and ± 0.05 or ± 2%
HGB 0.10 – 25.50 r2 >0.95 and ± 0.20 or ± 3%
PLT 3.0 – 3000.0 r2 >0.95 and ± 5.5 or ± 5%
The linearity data was analyzed independently for each DxH 800 instrument in the
workcell. Linearity was evaluated by fitting linear and non-linear (quadratic and
cubic) models and assessing that the deviations from linearity (difference between the
non-linear and linear fits) were within the acceptance criteria.
Weighted least squares method was used to estimate the linear, quadratic and cubic
regression parameters. The reason for choosing the weighted least squares method
was the significant dependency of variability to the measuring range
(heteroscedacity).
All analyses met r2 acceptance criteria. The linearity results for WBC, RBC, HGB,
and PLT on the DxH 800 v3.0 demonstrated acceptable linearity performance.
Linearity: Body Fluid
The objective of the study was to verify that the Body Fluid Linearity of the proposed
DxH 800 system (v3.0) meets the performance specifications. Linearity was
evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP06-A.
Linearity was assessed by demonstrating that the reported results are directly
proportional to the concentration of the measurand in a test sample for body fluids for
BF-RBC and BF-TNC parameters across the analytical measuring range. Testing
assessed body fluid linearity using whole blood or cell control analogs on the
proposed DxH 800 system (v3.0).

Dilution series of whole blood (BF-RBC) or cell control analogs (BF-TNC) were
made to cover the analytical measuring interval of the body fluid parameter. To
cover the entire parameter range a single set of 15 dilutions were made. All dilutions
were run in quadruplicate on each of the three DxH 800 v3.0 instruments in the
workcell.

BF-RBC r2 >0.95 and ± 500 or ± 5% Bias
BF-TNC r2 >0.95 and ± 5 or ± 10% Bias
The linearity data was analyzed independently for each DxH 800 instrument in the
workcell. Statistical evaluation of linearity followed CLSI EP06-A. Linearity was
evaluated by fitting linear and non-linear (quadratic and cubic) models and assessing
that the deviations from linearity (difference between the non-linear and linear fits)
were within the acceptance criteria.
Weighted least squares method was used to estimate the linear, quadratic and cubic
regression parameters. The reason for choosing the weighted least squares method
was the significant dependency of variability to the measuring range
(heteroscedacity).
All analyses met r2 acceptance criteria. The results for BF-RBC and BF-TNC on the
DxH 800 v3.0 demonstrated acceptable body fluids linearity performance.
d. Carryover:
The objective of the study was to verify that the Whole Blood Carryover of the
proposed DxH 800 system (v3.0) meets the performance specifications. The study
was performed in accordance with CLSI H26-A2.
Carryover was assessed by running whole blood specimens with high parameter
values followed by DxH Diluent (diluent). Whole blood specimens were selected or
altered to obtain the WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT target values below. Each whole
blood specimen was analyzed three times followed by diluent analyzed three times.
A minimum of three carryover cycles (i.e., three different specimens) per parameter
were tested on each DxH 800 instrument in the workcell.

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Electromagnetic Compatibility/Interference:
The objective of the study was to verify that the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)
status of individual DxH 800 and DxH SMS instruments are not impacted when
configured in a workcell configuration.
The required intrinsic immunity level to preclude EMC interference against emissions
of nearby devices for the DxH 800 is 3 volts/meter. An assessment of the DxH 800’s
intrinsic level of immunity to preclude EMC interference against emissions of nearby
devices was performed. Both the DxH 800 and DxH SMS have a maximum
permissible emission limit of 0.0007 volts/meter. Testing of the individual devices
showed acceptable performance to these limits. The required immunity level for both
is 3 volts/meter. Therefore, the intrinsic level of RF immunity for both devices is
orders of magnitude greater than the emission limit of each device. Based on these
factors, it is unlikely that the EMC interference would be increased in a connected
DxH workcell as compared to a stand-alone DxH 800.
b. Vibration Testing
The objective of the study was to determine the impact of vibration due to the
coupling of multiple instruments in a workcell configuration on measurement results.
The impact of connecting DxH 800 and DxH SMS instruments in workcell
configurations was assessed by comparing the System Backgrounds and AC RMS
(alternating current root mean square) noise for each blood cell measurement channel
against the specification limits. Measurement results will not be impacted if System
Backgrounds and AC RMS noise remain within specification during vibration testing.
The testing protocol included: instrument Shutdown and Startup; completion of daily
checks including System Backgrounds, and; for each instrument, capture 20 AC RMS
noise measurements for each blood cell measurement channel of the CBC and VCSn
modules, while all of the other instruments (DxH 800 and DxH SMS) in the test
configuration were continuously running.
Eleven test cases were executed representing the different workcell configurations.
All test cases for the Standalone and Connectivity Workcell configurations passed the
AC RMS noise measurements as well as System Backgrounds. Based on this study,
there is no evidence that the coupling of multiple instruments in a workcell
configuration will have an impact on measurement of results.
c. Determination of Limit of Blank (LoB), Lower Limits of Detection (LLoD) and
Quantitation (LLoQ):
The objective of the study was to verify that the LoB, LLoD and LLoQ of the DxH
15

--- Page 16 ---
800 v3.0 meet the performance specifications. The studies were designed based on
CLSI H26-A2.
LoB, LoD, and LLoQ testing was performed for the parameters defined below. These
are parameters where there is a clinical interest (medical decision level) on very low
or near zero values.
· Whole blood – WBC and PLT
· Body Fluid – TNC and RBC
Limit of Blank
The test was conducted on each of the three DxH 800 v3.0 instruments in the
workcell. On each test instrument, blank samples consisting of DxH Diluent (diluent)
were tested over three days as follows:
· For the whole blood mode, testing of the diluent blanks was distributed over
the different analysis modes where five diluent blanks were analyzed in each
mode (CBC, CD, CDR and CR) for three days. This testing scheme resulted
in 40 daily runs (20 AM, 20 PM) which then totaled 120 whole blood runs
over the 3 day study.
· For the body fluids mode, testing of the diluent blanks resulted in 40 daily
runs (20 AM, 20 PM) which then totaled 120 body fluid runs over the 3 day
study.
A minimum of two reagent lots were used for the DxH Diluent and the DxH Cell
Lyse installed on the DxH 800 Workcell instruments over the 3 day period.
The limits of blank (LoB) were calculated separately for 3 connected DxH 800 v3.0
instruments. The nonparametric approach based on 95% percentiles was used to
calculate LoB for each instrument.
Lower Limit of Detection and Lower Limit of Quantitation
To test for LLoD and LLoQ, an individual set of dilutions on a sample was prepared
to obtain a stock solution with a value in one of the specified target ranges. The
concentration of the stock solution was verified on the DxH 800 v2.0 predicate
instrument. Four samples per parameter were used for a total of 16 samples.
Dilution series were prepared of the stock solution in 10 percent increments from 0%
to 100%. Three sets of dilutions were prepared; one set of dilutions was analyzed on
each of the three DxH 800 v3.0 instruments. Five replicates of each dilution level
were analyzed on each DxH 800 v3.0 instrument in the appropriate analytical mode,
either CBC or BF. The analysis was repeated 24 hours later on each of the three
DxH800 v3.0 instruments.
Bias was established using normal whole blood samples analyzed in duplicate in the
CBC analytical mode on the DxH 800 v2.0 predicate instrument and each of the DxH
16

--- Page 17 ---
800 v3.0 instruments in the workcell. Five bloods were analyzed each day for 12
days for a total of 60 bloods.
There was a significant relationship between precision and concentration for each
parameter. Consequently, the precision profile approach was used to estimate LLoD
and LLoQ. LLoQ was calculated based on total error composed of the within
laboratory variability component and bias component.

d. DxH SMS Performance Test Strategy
The output of the DxH SMS is limited to the delivery of a physical slide. The device
does not generate test results; it only produces a slide that is read on a separate device
by a technician. Based on this, the DxH SMS test strategy was designed to evaluate
the critical attributes of the slide output, specifically slide quality and carryover.
Testing was performed on the most complex workcell (model DxH 2401).
DxH SMS Slide Quality
The objective was to verify that the DxH SMS produces slides that meet the slide
quality specifications. Slide quality was established in accordance with CLSI H20-
A2.
Slides were prepared in duplicate for 104 specimens on the DxH SMS in the
workcell. The slides were evaluated by two independent readers following the
Requirements for an Acceptable Blood Film (section 6.3.1) described in CLSI H20-
A2. Additionally, overall slide quality was assessed.
Acceptance Criteria: Slides must meet the Requirements for an Acceptable Blood
Film (section 6.3.1) described in CLSI H20-A2:
1. Sufficient working area.
2. Minimum 2.5 cm in length terminating at least 1 cm from the end of the slide.
3. Gradual transition in thickness from the thick to the thin areas, ending in a
feathered edge.

4. Acceptable morphology within the working area.
5. Narrower than the slide on which the film is spread, with smooth continuous
side margins that are accessible for oil immersion examination.
6. No artifact introduced by the technique.
7. Minimum distributional distortion.
8. A far end that becomes gradually thinner, without grainy streaks, troughs, or
ridges, all of which indicate an increased number of WBC carried into this
area.
Additionally, >95% of the slides must be readable.
All results met the acceptance criteria. The DxH SMS produces slides that meet the
slide quality specifications.
DxH SMS Carryover
The objective was to verify that the Carryover of the DxH SMS meets the
performance specifications.
A series of slides from normal whole blood samples followed by control material
containing analog cells were prepared by the DxH SMS in alternating order as
described below.
· Three normal whole blood samples
· One control sample with a WBC value of 50 x10³/μL
· Three normal whole blood samples
· One control sample with a WBC value of 150x10³/μL
· Four normal whole blood samples
· One control sample with a WBC value of 400x10³/μL
· Three normal whole blood samples
· One control sample with a WBC value of 50x10³/μL
· Three normal whole blood samples
The whole blood slides were assessed for carryover of control analog cells by
performing a 400 cell differential on each slide using the Cellavision DM96
(k080595).
Slides must contain ≤1 analog cell in 400 WBCs in the working area of the slide.
There were no analog cells observed on any of the whole blood slides. The DxH
SMS carryover demonstrated acceptable performance.
An additional carryover study was conducted on the DxH SMS using whole blood
samples with abnormal WBC types. It was designed to test for carryover of abnormal
WBC cell types using the DxH SMS within a connected workcell. The carryover
study was repeated 5 times using 5 different high target value (HTV) abnormal WBC
specimens.
19

--- Page 20 ---
A low target value (LTV) sample free of abnormal WBC cells was identified with
sufficient volume for each carryover study. Each sample was leukodepleted using
CD45RO conjugated beads to reduce the background WBC and enhance the detection
sensitivity of the carryover studies. Leukodepletion did not affect the other cell
populations and some residual WBC may have remained.
For each carryover study, a set of seven slides (1 Background LTV, 3 HTV, 3 LTV)
were prepared on the DxH SMS. The same specimen was used to prepare the
Background LTV and the individual LTV slides. A manual differential was
performed on the Background LTV slide, the third HTV slide and the first LTV slide.
For the HTV samples, the manual differential was based on a 400 cell count. For
LTV samples, due to the low cell concentration, all cells within the working area of
the slide were read. A Cellavison DM96 was used to locate the events on the slide
and the results were reviewed by a single operator.
The first LTV slide must contain ≤ 1 abnormal cell in the working area of the slide.
There were no abnormal cells observed on any of the LTV slides from the five
carryover studies.
All carryover studies met the acceptance criteria. The DxH SMS carryover
demonstrated acceptable performance.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
