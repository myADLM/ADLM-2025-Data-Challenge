Traceability:
The analytes contained in the Randox Liquid Assayed Chemistry Controls Premium
Plus Levels 1, 2, and 3 were obtained from commercially available sources. Control
solutions are derived from gravimetrically prepared stock solutions and analyzed in-
house.
Value Assignment:
Values are assigned through multiple analyses in-house on instrumentation calibrated
with a master lot of calibrator. The mean and the CV ranges printed in the package
insert were derived from replicate analyses and are specific for the lot. Assigned
values of each batch of Liquid Assayed Chemistry Control Premium Plus are
confirmed using several external laboratories with several different instrument
families. Assigned control ranges are listed in the labeling by instrument family and
analyte methods.
Stability Studies:
Real Time stability studies were conducted for closed and open vials. The shelf life
of the Liquid Chemistry Assayed Control Premium Plus Levels 1, 2, and 3 is 18
months from the date of manufacture when stored at –20ºC to –70ºC. Open vial
stability when stored refrigerated (+2ºC to + 8ºC): Thawed control is stable for 7
days at +2ºC to +8ºC, with the following exceptions: Troponin T is stable for 3 days
at +2ºC to +8ºC.
Real time studies are ongoing. Shelf life and open-vial stability studies protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
