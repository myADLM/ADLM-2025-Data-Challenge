L. Test Principle:
The BGM009 Blood Glucose meters and test strips use biosensor technology. The
test strips contain an enzyme, glucose oxidase (Aspergillus niger) that reacts to
glucose present in blood, releasing electrons. The meter applies a small electrical
current to the test strip and measures changes in the current caused by the reaction of
glucose in the blood sample to the enzyme in the test strip. The meter converts these
measurements into blood glucose readings that are displayed on the meter’s liquid
crystal display. The system is plasma-calibrated.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed within-run precision studies using venous whole blood
samples spiked to achieve five glucose concentrations (40, 100, 150, 220, 330
mg/dL). Each glucose level was analyzed in replicates of 10 using 10 BGM009
meters and three lots of test strips for a total of 200 tests per glucose level per test
strip lot for a total of 600 test per glucose level. Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using venous whole blood supplemented with
glucose, or allowed to undergo glycolysis, to achieve 11 glucose
concentrations ranging from 20 to 640 mg/dL (18, 30, 43, 62, 102, 130, 204,
340, 422, 549, and 640 mg/dL as measured by YSI). Each glucose level was
measured on the BGM009 meter in replicates using 3 test strip lots and the
values compared with those obtained on the YSI. Results from regression
analysis:
Lot # Slope y-intercept r value
1 1.0209 -2.9631 0.9989
2 1.0125 1.0230 0.9984
3 0.9923 2.1349 0.9988
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement
range of 20-600 mg/dL.
Testing was performed to validate acceptable performance of the “LO” (< 20
mg/dL glucose) and high “HI” (> 600 mg/dL glucose) alert features of the
system.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The BGM009 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to the NIST
SRM 917c reference material. The method comparison study was performed
using the candidate device and YSI as the reference method (see Section 2.a.).

Test Strip Stability:
The Sponsor’s protocols and acceptance criteria for real-time testing of closed
and opened test strip vial stability were reviewed and found to be acceptable
to support the labeled claims of a 6-month shelf life and 6-month open vial
use-life at the recommended storage conditions of 39-86°F and a relative
humidity of 10-85%.
Control Solutions: Value assignment and closed and opened vial stability
protocols and acceptance criteria were previously reviewed (k131750) and
found to be acceptable for the Contrex Plus 4 control solutions Level 1, Level
2, and Level 3. The manufacture claims a 24 month shelf life and 3 month
open vial stability when stored at the recommended storage temperatures of
39°F to 86°F.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study in Section M1b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Potential interfering substances were tested by spiking venous whole blood
samples to achieve two levels of glucose (70-90 mg/dL and 300-330 mg/dL).
Each potential interferent was added to each of the glucose containing
solutions at a minimum of two levels. Each test sample was measured in
replicates of 10 with 10 BGM009 meters and results compared to those
obtained on the reference method (YSI). The % bias between the meter result
and the YSI result was calculated and the sponsor defines no significant
interference as ≤ 10% difference in these results. The highest concentrations
with no significant observed interference are listed in the table below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A study by professional users was performed on samples from fingerstick,
forearm, and palm. One hundred and forty three (patient) participants were
included for each anatomical sample type. In addition, 8 fingerstick samples
were allowed to glycolyze to achieve low glucose concentrations < 50 mg/dL
(for a total of 151 fingerstick samples). Three strip lots were tested; a
different sample set was run on each test strip lot. Results from the BGM009
meter were compared to those of the comparator method, YSI 2300. The
glucose concentration range tested included 36-473 mg/dL as measured on
8

Users also completed questionnaires, and were asked to rate the ease-of-
understanding of each section on a 5-level scale ranging from very easy to very
difficult. Scores of 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 were assigned to each rating level,
respectively, such that the most favorable rating possible was 5 (Very Easy).
Users were also asked to evaluate the extent to which the illustrations in the
User’s Manual supported operating the meter easily and quickly, using the same
rating scale. Responses to all five questions were reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
Flesch-Kincaid readability assessments were conducted on all labeling. Results
demonstrated an 8th grade or less readability for the User’s Manual, test strip

6. Quality Control
Contrex Plus 4 control solutions (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3; previously
cleared under k131750) are available with this system. The meter has a user
initiated function (with a ‘ctl’ icon) to prevent control results from being used in
the caluculation of averages. The control solution results are stored in the meter
memory and are indicated by a ‘ctl’ icon. Recommendations on when to test the
control materials are provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for each
control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use
the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not
Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the
performance of the BGM009 Blood Glucose Monitoring System was
evaluated using venous whole blood samples at five glucose levels of
approximately 40, 60, 130, 300, 500 mg/dL. At each glucose level, samples
were prepared with hematocrit levels of 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and
60% hematocrit. At each glucose/hematocrit level, 10 replicates were tested
on each of 3 lots BGM009 test strips and the values were compared with
those obtained from YSI-2300 analyzer. The results demonstrate acceptable
performance of the BGM 009 Blood Glucose Monitoring System produces
over the claimed hematocrit range of 20-60%.
2. Altitude study: Venous whole blood samples at five (5) glucose levels
(approximately 50, 121, 219, 331, and 449 mg/dL) were tested at sea level and
10,335 feet (3150 meters) above sea level. Twenty readings per glucose level
were taken at each of the 2 elevations including sea level and 10,335 ft. and
results from the BGM009 Blood Glucose Monitoring System were compared
to YSI. Results demonstrate acceptable bias to YSI to support the claims in
the labeling that altitudes up to 10,335 feet have no significant effect on blood
glucose measurements from the BGM 009 Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
3. Sample Volume: To determine the minimum sample volume, venous whole
blood sample volumes of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 μL were tested. Sample
concentrations included three glucose levels (40 mg/dL, 120 mg/dL, and 330
mg/dL). Testing included 10 test strips for each of three lots of test strips for
each test volume and each glucose level. Study results adequately support the
claimed minimal sample volume of 0.5 μL.
4. Temperature and humidity studies: Ten BGM009 meters, and 3 lots of
BGM009 test strips were used to verify accurate performance within the
temperature and humidity conditions claimed for the system. Venous whole
blood at 60, 120, 200, and 400 mg/dL glucose were tested. Five temperature
and humidity combinations were tested including low temperature/low
14

--- Page 15 ---
humidity, low temperature/high humidity, average temperature/avearage
humidity, high temperature/low humidity, and high temperature/high
humidity. Results support the operating conditions claim of 50-104°F (10-
40°C) and 20-90% RH.
5. Infection Control Studies: The device is intended for single-patient use only.
Disinfection efficacy studies for the external meter materials were reviewed
under k131750 and demonstrated that complete inactivation of live virus
(hepatitis B) with Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes (EPA
registration number 67619-12-5813). The sponsor provided studies to
demonstrate that there was no change in performance of the test system after
1825 cleaning and disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one cleaning wipe
plus one disinfecting wipe) to simulate 5 years of cleaning and disinfecting the
meter 7 times per week. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for
the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
6. EMC testing was certified (by Quietek Corporation, Taiwan LTD) and
compliance certificates provided documenting that acceptable electromagnetic
testing (EMC) had been performed.
7. Customer service is available Monday through Friday 8:00 am to 5:00 pm
CST by calling 1-800-261-7092.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
