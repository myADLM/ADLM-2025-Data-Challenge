Procedure
CLSI EP25-A: Evaluation of Stability of In-vitro diagnostic Reagents
CLSI C28-A3c: Defining, Establishing and Verifying Reference Intervals in the Clinical
Laboratory
L. Test Principle:
The BioPlex 2200 25-OH Vitamin D assay is a multiplex flow competitive immunoassay
for the quantitative determination of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in human serum.
The BioPlex 2200 System combines an aliquot of patient sample with the Vitamin D Release
Buffer to dissociate the 25-hydroxyvitamin D from its binding protein. After the first
Incubation, the bead reagent is added to the reaction vessel and incubated at 37°C. After
the second incubation, the BioPlex® 2200 System adds the vitamin D-biotin conjugate 1.
The excess conjugate 1 is removed during a wash cycle and the streptavidinphycoerythrin
(SA-PE) conjugate 2 is added. The excess conjugate 2 is removed during
a wash cycle and the beads are re-suspended in wash buffer. The bead mixture then
passes through the detector. The identity of the dyed beads is determined by the
fluorescence of the dyes and the amount of 25-hydroxyvitamin D captured is inversely
proportional to the fluorescence of the attached SA-PE. Raw data is calculated in relative
fluorescence intensity (RFI). Two additional dyed beads, Internal Standard Bead (ISB) and
Serum Verification Bead (SVB) is present in each reaction mixture to verify detector
response and the addition of serum to the reaction vessel, respectively.
The BioPlex® 25-OH Vitamin D assay is calibrated using a set of 6 distinct calibrators
supplied separately by Bio-Rad Laboratories. Results are calculated from a 4-PL (parameter
logistic) calibration curve in which an inverse relationship exists between the amounts of 25-
hydroxyvitamin D in the patient sample and the amount of RFI detected by the system.
The results are expressed in ng/mL.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All performance testing were conducted on the Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 System
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 25-OH Vitamin D assay was evaluated according
to CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. Serum samples with low, medium, and high levels (6 total)
of 25-OH Vitamin D and two levels of serum controls were assayed in duplicate per run
with two runs per day for twenty days (N=80) on one reagent lot.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity samples were prepared by diluting natural and spiked highly concentrated
patient serum samples with a low-level human serum sample (<6.5 ng/mL). Each sample
and dilution was evaluated in replicates of four on a single analyzer using one lot of
reagent. Linearity was evaluated by calculating a linear regression comparing observed
values versus expected values based on the CLSI EP6-A guideline. The regression
parameters (slope, intercept, and r2) of the observed values vs. expected values are shown
below:
Slope Intercept r2 Sample range tested
1.0001 0.0045 0.9988 5.5-168.9
Based on the results of the linearity study the sponsor claimed that the candidate assay is
linear from 6.5 to 125 ng/mL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The BioPlex 25-OH Vitamin D Calibrators are traceable to internal standards, which are
determined by UV spectrophotometric analysis using the extinction coefficient of 18,000
mL/mmol/cm at 264 nm wavelength.
The six levels of Master Calibrators are manufactured volumetrically from the internal
standards into the depleted human serum except level 1 (25-OH hydroxyvitamin D free)
in 25% horse serum. The Master Calibrators are immediately frozen at -70°C.
Value Assignment:
The BioPlex® 25-OH Vitamin D kit calibrators are manufactured for each lot kit with the

d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and the limit of quantitation (LoQ)
were determined following CLSI Document EP17-A2 guideline. The LoD is defined as
the lowest concentration of 25-OH Vitamin D that can be detected with 95% probability.
LoB was performed using two BioPlex 25-OH Vitamin reagent lots on one instrument in
4 replicates per day for 5 days yielding 100 data points per reagent lot. LoD was
performed with six serum samples with mean measured concentration ranging from 3.89
to 34.29 ng/mL. The samples were tested with two BioPlex 25-OH Vitamin D reagent
lots on one instrument in 12 replicates per day for five days yielding 60 data points per
sample per reagent lot. LoQ: The precision was calculated with the same six low level
samples used for the LoD. The mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation for
each sample were calculated. LoQ was defined as precision ≤ 20% CV.
The LoB, LoD, and LoQ are summarized below:
LoB LoD LoQ
0.8 ng/mL 2.5 ng/mL 6.5 ng/mL
The sponsor claimed that the candidate assay has a measuring range from 6.5 to 125
ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference study:
To measure the effects of endogenous serum components and exogenous molecules on
the 25-OH Vitamin D assay. Three sample pools were prepared to achieve a low (10-20
ng/mL), medium (30-50 ng/mL), and high (70-90 ng/mL).The samples were spiked with
the interfering substances. The tests and controls were evaluated for a total of ten
replicates per interferent using BioPlex 2200 25-OH Vitamin D reagent. Substances are
considered interfering if their presence in a sample results in more than ± 10% deviation
in quantitation relative to the value determined in the absence of the substance. The
protocol and calculations were based on CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. The substances and the
maximum levels tested are shown in the table below:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The study was performed in accordance with CLSI C28-A3c guideline. Two hundred and
eighty-seven samples from apparently healthy donors including 160 males and 127 female
were collected from three regions (North, Central, and South) in the US and in three seasons
(spring, summer and winter), including Caucasians and African American subjects.
The 287 samples from apparently healthy donors met the following inclusion / exclusion
criteria as follows and tested with the BioPlex 25-OH Vitamin D kit in singlicate. *One
sample <6.5 ng/ml was excluded from the data analysis.
· Age from 21 to 90
· 50% female and 50% male
· 20% from Northern, 20% from Central, and 60% from Southern region
· 40% collected in Summer and 60% in Winter
· At least 30% dark and 30% light skin
· 90% not taking Vitamin D supplements and <30% of those taking Vitamin D
supplements at or more than 1000 IU, but less than 2000 IU
· Normal TSH, PTH, and Total Calcium
· No family history of parathyroid or calcium regulatory disease. In addition, no
personal history of kidney disease, GI disease, and no bariatric surgery
The observed median, mean, and ranges between 2.5th to 97.5th percentile are summarized
below:
2.5th to 97.5th
N Mean Median
Percentile
286 29.7 ng/mL 27.7 ng/mL 12.7 – 65.7 ng/mL
Each laboratory should establish its own reference range pertinent to their specific
populations.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
