H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The LIAISON® Anti-HAV assay is an in vitro chemiluminescent immunoassay intended
for the qualitative detection of total antibodies to hepatitis A (anti-HAV) in human serum
and sodium heparin plasma samples using the LIAISON® Analyzer family. The assay is
indicated as an aid in the laboratory diagnosis of current or previous HAV infections in
conjunction with other serological and clinical information and to determine the presence
of an antibody response to HAV in vaccine recipients.
This assay is not intended for screening blood or solid or soft tissue donors. Assay
performance characteristics have not been established for immunocompromised or
immunosuppressed patients. The user is responsible for establishing assay performance
characteristics in these populations. Caution: U.S. Federal Law restricts this device to
sale by or on the order of a physician.
The LIAISON XL Analyzer is an automated discrete continuous loading
chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) analyzer for in vitro diagnostic analysis of
CLIAs on human specimens cleared for use on the analyzer. It is only to be used with
FDA cleared chemiluminescent immunoassays that are marketed by DiaSorin for the
LIAISON XL Analyzer. The analyzer can be connected to a third party Laboratory
Automation System (LAS) which has been previously cleared for use with FDA cleared
assays.
The LIAISON® Control Anti-HAV (negative and positive) is intended for use as assayed
quality control samples to monitor the performance of the LIAISON® Anti-HAV assay.
The performance characteristics of LIAISON® controls have not been established for any
other assays or instrument platforms different from LIAISON®, LIAISON® XL and
LIAISON® XL with LIAISON® XL Workcell Upgrade Kit.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use with the LIASON XL Analyzer.
I. Device Description:
The LIAISON XL Analyzer is an in vitro diagnostic device consisting of loading areas (for
samples, reagent integrals, ancillary reagents, starter reagents, cuvettes, disposable tips,

L. Test Principle:
The DiaSorin LIAISON XL Analyzer equipped with the LIAISON XL Workcell Upgrade
Kit is a fully automated, closed, continuous loading in vitro diagnostic immunoassay system
utilizing chemiluminescent technology. The analyzer uses DiaSorin proprietary reagents to
measure chemiluminescence resulting from the reaction of an analyte in a sample with a
magnetic particle solid phase coated with antigen or antibody and a chemiluminescent tracer.
The analyzer is intended for use in professional clinical laboratories only. The LIAISON XL
with LIAISON XL Workcell Upgrade Kit has the same principle of the procedure as the
LIAISON XL Analyzer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision:
A 5 day precision study was conducted at one external site to verify the precision of
the LIAISONXL Analyzer with the LIAISONXL Workcell Upgrade Kit using the
previously cleared LIAISONAnti-HAV Assay (K103529). Testing was performed
using the LIAISONXL with LIAISONXL Workcell Upgrade Kit in both the stand-
alone and connected modes using three kit lots.
The study used a panel comprised of five frozen contrived serum samples prepared by
DiaSorin S.p.A. The samples were diluted or spiked to represent negative, near the
cut-off, and low positive anti-HAV levels. All panel members were stored frozen
prior to testing. The panel was tested in four replicates per run, one run per day, for
five operating days. The mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation (%CV)

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The agreement study consisted of testing 140 frozen serum samples on the LIAISON
XL and the LIAISONXL with LIAISONXL Workcell Upgrade Kit in both stand-
alone and connected modes using the LIAISONAnti-HAV Assay. The samples were
either retrospectively collected or contrived by DiaSorin and all samples were kept
frozen prior to testing. A total of 140 samples were tested of which 28 samples were
contrived (20%).
The samples procured for the agreement study consisted of the following index
populations:
• 39 negative samples scoring an index greater than or equal to 1.90 Index
(27.9%);
• 64 samples scoring an intermediate index (near the cut-off), ranging from 1.90
through 0.4 (45.7%);
• 37 positive samples scoring an index smaller than 0.400 (26.4%).
Testing of the LIAISON XL was performed at DiaSorin S.p.A. and the LIAISON XL
with LIAISONXL Workcell Upgrade Kit testing was performed at an external site.
Method comparison testing was performed using one kit lot of the LIAISON Anti-
HAV assay. Results were obtained using the following instrument configurations:
a. One LIAISON XL Analyzer (reference)
b. One LIAISON XL Analyzer with LIAISON XL Workcell Upgrade Kit
connected to an FDA cleared automation solution, pipetting from sample bay
(stand-alone mode)
c. One LIAISON XL Analyzer with LIAISON XL Workcell Upgrade Kit
connected to an FDA cleared automation solution, pipetting from point in
space (connected mode)
The agreement results comparing the LIAISON XL Analyzer and the LIAISONXL
Analyzer with LIAISON XL Workcell Upgrade Kit in stand-alone mode are
reported in Table 3 and Table 4:

during the study. The stated Positive and Negative percent agreements are acceptable
to establish equivalence between all analyzer configurations tested.
