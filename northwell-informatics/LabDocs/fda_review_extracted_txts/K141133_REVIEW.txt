VIDAS 3
The VIDAS 3 system is a complete standalone immunodiagnostic system intended for
trained and qualified laboratory technicians (daily routine use) and laboratory
administrators (application configuration).
This device is an in vitro diagnostic medical device for professional use only.
VIDAS H. pylori IgG
VIDAS H. pylori IgG (HPY) is an automated qualitative test for use on the instruments of
the VIDAS family, for the detection of anti-Helicobacter pylori IgG antibodies in human
serum or plasma (EDTA) using the ELFA technique (Enzyme Linked Fluorescent

an adult symptomatic population.
This device is an in vitro diagnostic medical device for professional use only.
VIDAS Lyme IgG II
The VIDAS Lyme IgG II (LYG) assay is an automated qualitative enzyme immunoassay
intended for use on the instruments of the VIDAS family in the presumptive detection of
human IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum (plain or separation gel)
or plasma (sodium heparin or lithium heparin). It should be used to test patients with a
history and/or symptoms of infection with B. burgdorferi. All VIDAS Lyme IgG II

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
CDC low-titer rubella antibody standard results:
Vials of CDC low-titer reference standard were reconstituted with distilled water as
preconized by CDC and then pooled as MSN (Master Stock Neat). According to the
CDC information, the theoretical dose of the neat solution was 21 IU/mL. A ½
dilution solution was then prepared from the MSN solution and had an expected dose
at 10.5 IU/mL.
The neat and 1/2 dilutions solutions of the CDC low titer standard (MSN & MS1/2
solutions) were then in triplicate in the same run on the VIDAS and the VIDAS 3
instruments using the same VIDAS RUB IgG reagent lot.
The mean result (IU/mL) obtained with the neat and 1/2 dilutions of the CDC low-
titer standard and the difference in % compared to the theoretical/expected
concentration of CDC low-titer standard were calculated for the VIDAS and the
VIDAS 3:
- For VIDAS 3, the mean value of the neat and ½ dilution was respectively -11.0%
and -11.4% compared to the theoretical concentration.
- For VIDAS, the mean value of the neat and ½ dilution was respectively -15.7%
and -7.6% compared to the theoretical concentration.
CDC reference panel testing, data analysis and results:
The CDC reference panel consisted of 100 specimens, 50 pairs of sera titered by Hem
agglutination (9 negative sera resulting in 18 negative specimens and 41 positive sera
resulting in 82 positive specimens). A single replicate of each of the 100 CDC
reference panel samples was tested on the VIDAS and the VIDAS 3 instruments
using the same VIDAS RUB IgG reagent lot.
The number of positive and negative sera detected are identical between VIDAS and
VIDAS 3 systems: The VIDAS RUB IgG (RBG) assay identified 80/82 (97.6%)
positive tests on 82 positive sera and 18/18 (100%) negative tests on 18 negative sera.
One of the pairs of HI positive sera were reported as VIDAS equivocal (both results).

Human serum sample pools were serially diluted into a total of 11 samples and

Linear regression analysis between the expected values and the observed values
generated the following equation: y= 1.060x – 0.109, R2 = 0.9977 (Sample range
tested from 1.95 - 1607.99 mIU/mL)

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
VIDAS HCG Assay
A carry-over study was performed using a low level sample pool with a concentration
between 2 and 3mIU/mL and a high positive spiked sample pool with an analyte
concentration of 1,000,000 mIU/mL. The high hCG positive sample was tested with the hCG
batch negative sample and carry-over analyte negative samples during 7 runs on three
VIDAS 3 analyzers. Results were found to be acceptable.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
