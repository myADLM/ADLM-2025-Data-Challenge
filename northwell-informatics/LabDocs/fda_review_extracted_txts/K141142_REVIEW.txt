I. Device Description:
The MammaPrint® FFPE test is performed at Agendia’s two central Laboratories, one
located in Netherland and the other one in California, USA. The test is a microarray based
gene expression analysis of RNA extracted from FFPE breast tumor tissue. The test is a
custom-designed array chip manufactured by Agilent Technologies using the Agilent
oligonucleotide microarray platform which assesses the mRNA expression of the 70 genes
printed in nine-fold.
The MammaPrint® FFPE analysis is designed to determine the expression of specific genes
in a tissue sample. The result is an expression profile, or “fingerprint”, of the sample. Using
this expression profile, the MammaPrint® FFPE Index is calculated and the molecular
prognosis profile of the sample is determined (Low Risk, High Risk). The genes and scoring
algorithm for MammaPrint® FFPE are the same as those used for MammaPrint®, performed
with fresh and fresh-frozen tissues.

L. Test Principle:
The MammaPrint® FFPE is a microarray based gene expression analysis of breast tumor
tissue. The analysis is based on several processes: isolation of RNA from FFPE breast
cancer tissue sections; elimination of gDNA, reverse transcription of RNA resulting in
cDNA; amplification and labeling of the cDNA; hybridization of the amplified and labeled
cDNA to the diagnostic microarray; washing and scanning the diagnostic microarray and
data acquisition (feature extraction); calculation and determination of the risk of recurrence.
Briefly, the amplified and labeled cDNA is hybridized to slides at 600C for 17 hours in a
rotation oven. By hybridization only complementary cDNA will bind to a 60-mer oligo on
the array. For scanning the ManmmaPrint® FFPE microarray, an Agilent microarray
scanner is used. The Agilent DNA microarray scanner is a 48-slide scanning system that can
read 1" x 3" glass slide microarrays. The result after scanning is a scan file (multi-page
TIFF). This TIFF contains two pages, one page for each dye used. These are used by the
feature extraction software.
Agilent Feature Extraction Software opens the multipage TIFF and combines those into one
image which shows a pattern of differently colored spots. The Feature Extraction Software
analyses the scan file (TIFF) by determining the intensities of the individual features,
subtracting background signal, perform normalization, and calculate ratios, errors and p-
values for each spot. The feature extraction software uses the MamnmaPrint® FFPE
microarray chip design file as a template in order to identify control features, normalization
features and reporter features. The fluorescent intensity of the features is a measure for the
activity of that particular gene.
Data analysis is performed according to a specific MamnmaPrint ® FFPE algorithm
(MammaPrint® Index, or MPI). The algorithm calculates the correlation of the sample
expression profile to a template (the mean expression profile of 44 tumors with a known
good clinical outcome) and determines the molecular profile of the sample. This algorithm is
designed and programmed by Agendia and compiled into a standalone software program, "X-
Print Analysis Software". The "X-Print Analysis Software" loads a data file (CSV) which is
created by the laboratory technician by extracting specific information from the laboratory
database. The "X-Print Analysis Software" reads the CSV file, opens the Feature Extraction
Software data files (TXT), performs quality control checks, determines the sample
expression profile, calculates the correlation of sample profile to the "Low Risk" template
profile on a scale of -1.000 to +1.000 (MammaPrint® FFPE reportable range), compares the
5

--- Page 6 ---
calculated correlation to a pre-defined cut-off value and determines the samples prognostic
profile (i.e., Low Risk, High Risk, Low Risk Borderline, or High Risk Borderline).

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility of MammaPrint® FFPE
Thirty (30) samples of different risk categories (see table below) with sufficient
amount of FFPE tissue were isolated 4 times by a single operator. Isolation 1 and 2
(I1 and I2) were performed on day 1, and isolation 3 and 4 (I3 and I4) were
performed on day 2. After the isolations were performed the samples were processed
further (amplification, labeling, and hybridization) on different days per isolation
round; I1, I2, I3 and I4. This resulted in the generation of four results per tissue
sample processed on different days. The results were then compared over four
isolations to determine if there is a significant difference in indices between different
isolations for MammaPrint® FFPE.

Figure 1 Reproducibility Results of MammaPrint® FFPE over Four Isolations
A repeated Measurements ANOVA was used to determine if there was a different in
MammaPrint® Index (MPI) over all four isolations. The results show that there is no
significant difference (p=0.994). A Cochran’s Q test was used to assess the
difference in risk reporting outcome over the 4 isolations. The results of this test
show that there is no significant difference in MammaPrint® FFPE outcome over the
different isolations (p=0.290).
Repeatability of MammaPrint® FFPE
A Precision and Evaluation (P&E) experiment (CLSI, Evaluation of Precision
Performance of Quantative Measurement Methods, EP5-A2) was performed to
determine the Repeatability and Method Precision of MammaPrint® FFPE test.
Three controls and four FFPE samples representing all test outcome levels were
analyzed and run repeatedly consecutively over 20 days. RNA was used as starting
material for each sample (no RNA pooling of multiple samples). Per day, one run
was performed consisting of two replicates of each test sample.

Reproducibility of MammaPrint® FFPE Control Samples
MammaPrint® FFPE specific control samples (n=3) were pooled, amplified, labeled
and hybridized according to standard FFPE laboratory protocols in Agendia’s
Amsterdam and Irvine laboratories. This was performed on a daily basis in order to
obtain MammaPrint® FFPE results over time. Results were combined for analysis:
25 days of data from Amsterdam scanner serial number US810R3210, 7 days of data
from Amsterdam scanner serial number US22502555, and 3 days of data from Irvine
scanner serial number US811R3213. The duplicate results on one day were
performed in separate experiments by different technicians in the lab. Therefore, on
some days when only one technician was performing an experiment in the lab this
will result in a single result for that day.
These results met Product Specifications criteria for MammaPrint® FFPE [i.e., std.
dev. ≤ 0.126 (equals 7% of dynamic range (dynamic range=1.8)]. To establish
stability of the control samples over time, the standard deviation of MPI values and
corresponding regression analysis for each sample are provided in table below.

Inter-Laboratory Comparison of MammaPrint® FFPE between Amsterdam and
Irvine Laboratories
FFPE samples (n=25, including 18 high risk and 7 low risk samples) were selected
from which MammaPrint® FFPE results were previously generated using standard
FFPE protocols in Product Support department Amsterdam. From these samples,
sections were taken and processed from isolation onwards by the Diagnostic
departments in both Agendia Irvine and Amsterdam according to standard protocols
(i.e., 25 samples at each site). Diagnostic FFPE control samples (n=3 for Amsterdam;
n=1 to 3 for Irvine) were taken along with each amplification, labeling and
hybridization run of these samples. After hybridization and washing the
MammaPrint® FFPE arrays were scanned using Agilent scanner number
US810R3210 in Amsterdam and US811R3213 in Irvine. The MammaPrint® FFPE
results generated for these 25 samples at Irvine and Amsterdam locations were
compared to the previously generated results. Identical 2x2 contingency tables of
MammaPrint® FFPE outcome were generated for both sites.

Validation for Use of Multiple Microarray Scanners in Amsterdam and Irvine
For validation of both microarray scanners in the Amsterdam central lab, 25 samples
(i.e., 16 high risk, 8 low risk and 1 borderline samples) were scanned two times; first
on the originally validated scanner, serial number US810R3210 and in addition using
the scanner with serial number US22502555. For validation of both microarray
scanners in the Irvine central lab, 27 samples (i.e., 13 high risk, 13 low risk and 1
borderline samples) were scanned two times; first on the originally validated scanner,
serial number US811R3213 and in addition using the additional scanner with serial
number US45103019. MPI were compared between both scanners at each central
lab.
At both central lab testing sites, the comparison of MPI between both scanners met
the predefined acceptance criteria, i.e., both arrays are considered in agreement when

Borderline Range 0.115 0.055
The “borderline region” refers to a range of MPI values surrounding the clinical
classification threshold. In this region the clinical classification result accuracy
potentially falls below the overall predetermined analytical accuracy of 90%. This
occurs as a result of technical variation in the performance of MammaPrint® and
MammaPrint® FFPE, only when the MPI value is close to the classification
threshold. The technical variation was determined using the median standard
deviation of the control sample measurements in the precision and repeatability study.
Samples outside this borderline region have >90% chance of being correctly
classified. This technical variation (i.e., > 10% chance of false classification for
borderline samples) does not change with the mathematical shift of cut-off from
0.415 to 0 for MammaPrint®.
Samples that lie within the borderline region and that are close to the threshold are
more likely to switch classes with repeated analyses. In a diagnostic setting these
samples will be performed in duplicate in order to obtain better outcome accuracy. A
borderline sample will be re-tested from RNA onwards going through the following
steps a second time: synthesis, amplification, labeling, hybridization, and scanning
and XPrint analysis. After two QC-passed results are generated for a borderline
sample, the MammaPrint® Index of both results will be averaged, and the final risk
classification will be made according to the mean value.

for stability in at least 20 measurements prior to diagnostic implementation and well
in advance of depletion of the current control samples.
Quality Controls
Quality of the RNA was assessed for every FFPE sample through the RNA Quality
Assay, and the QC model on the array gives the final call of the quality of the
amplification and hybridization.
Quality of the complete MammaPrint® FFPE is monitored from sample reception up
to and including external reporting. Quality controls (QCs) are used to monitor the
quality of the overall hybridization on the array referred to as Technical QCs as well
as the MammaPrint® FFPE specific test readout referred to as Product Specific QCs.
Combining both types of quality controls results in a total of 28 QCs.
Device Stability
The chip is stable for at least one year. The Cy Dyes are stable for up to 3 months at
2-8°C.
d. Detection limit:
Minimum labeled cDNA Input Amount
For FFPE samples, isolated RNA is diluted to a final concentration of 25 ng/μl prior
to cDNA generation. Labeled cDNA is generated using 13 μl of cDNA at 100.9
ng/µl, which is equivalent to 1311.7 ng as the regular input. When the isolated RNA
and cDNA cannot be diluted to the pre-specified final concentrations of 25 ng/µl, and
100.9 ng/µl, respectively, the samples will not be analyzed and will be reported as
“Quality Not Sufficient” (QNS).
A dilution study was performed to determine the minimum for input of labeled cDNA
in hybridization of MammaPrint® FFPE. Total amount of labeled cDNA (ng) ranged
from 0, 300, 900, 1500, 2100, 2700, and 3300 ng. The MPI showed stable results at
900, 1500, 2100, 2700, and 3300 ng. The lowest hybridization input (900 ng) of
cDNA with stable MPI results is below the regular input of 1300 ng.
Percent (%) Tumor Content
A minimum of 30% tumor content in a sample was used in the method comparison
study as well as in the RASTER study for MammaPrint® FFPE. Therefore,
MammaPrint® FFPE will require a minimum of 30% tumor content in an H&E
stained slide, as stated in Agendia’s “Specimens Sampling Instructions” insert for
MammaPrint® FFPE.

e. Analytical specificity:
The isolated RNA and amplified cDNA are quantified per SOPs using a spectrometer.
The ratio of absorbance at 260nm and 280nm is recorded as a measure to assess the
purity of RNA and cDNA, and included as part of QC to support the absence of
interfering substances. Specifically, the 260/280 ratio for the first method
comparison study dataset (n=122) ranged from 1.74 to 1.90. The 260/280 ratio for
RASTER FFPE dataset (n=345) ranged from 1.6 to 2.41. RNA and cDNA
specifications provided are adequate to exclude the presence of any effect from likely
interfering substances.
f. Assay cut-off:
MPI cut-off is set at +0.0 for MammaPrint® FFPE.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Assay development to correlate MPI between MammaPrint® (for use with fresh and
fresh-frozen samples) and MammaPrint® FFPE was conducted using a training set of
125 samples to lock the MammaPrint® FFPE. The 125 samples with matched fresh-
frozen (FF) and FFPE sections were analyzed with MammaPrint® or MammaPrint®
FFPE, respectively. The genes and algorithm used to calculate the MPI for
MammaPrint® FFPE was unchanged from those used for MammaPrint®. The test
results were used to determine calibration necessary for MammaPrint® FFPE,
utilizing Passing and Bablok regression analysis with Analyse-it for Microsoft Excel
(version 2.20).
The locked MammaPrint® FFPE was subsequently validated against two independent
datasets, where breast cancer tumor samples with matched FF and FFPE were used in
these studies. The FF section of the tumor was subjected to MammaPrint® (internal
version US09.1 / EU09.1) and the FFPE sections were subjected to MammaPrint®
FFPE (internal version US01.1 / EU01.1). The two validation datasets included
breast cancer samples in the IU population (i.e., Stage I or Stage II disease, tumor size
≤ 5.0 cm and lymph node negative). Samples in the two validation datasets do not
include any of the 125 training dataset samples.
First Validation Dataset (n=122)
The first validation dataset used samples collected from two European sites (n=45)
and from a U.S. site (n=77), resulting a total of 122 independent samples for this
dataset. Comparison of MPI and risk reporting outcomes between FF and FFPE is
shown below, graphically for MPI and in a 4x4 table for the risk reporting outcomes.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The microarRAy prognoSTics in breast cancER (RASTER) study was conducted in
16 community hospitals in the Netherlands between 2004 and 2006. The primary aim
of this multicenter observational study was to assess the feasibility of implementing
the MammaPrint® 70-gene signature in a community-based setting and to study the
clinical impact of the 70-gene signature test result on adjuvant systemic therapy
(AST) decision making. For 427 patients enrolled in the RASTER, treatment
decisions were based on standard guidelines, the MammaPrint® 70-gene signature,
and doctors’ and patients’ preferences. In January 2013, the 5 year outcome results of
the prospective observational RASTER study were published1, which included the
analysis of estimated five-year distant-recurrence free interval (DRFI).
To support clinical performance of MammaPrint® FFPE, MammaPrint® FFPE was
also performed on FFPE tissue of the RASTER patients. Results from
MammaPrint® Fresh and MammaPrint® FFPE were compared for the 345 paired
fresh and FFPE samples with 5 year outcome data from the 427 RASTER patient
samples. DRFI was the study endpoint as defined in the RASTER study.
Specifically, DRFI measures the time until the diagnosis of distant metastasis or death
from breast cancer. The local, regional and second primaries prior to Distant
Metastasis are also ignored. Data on all other patients were censored on the date of
the last follow-up visit or date of death. The RASTER samples included in this
comparison (n=345) comply with the MammaPrint® FFPE intended use population.

Not accounting for any covariates other than the patient’s MammaPrint® FFPE
status, patients classified as ‘Low Risk’ by MammaPrint® FFPE (81 adjuvantly
treated and 112 adjuvantly not treated), demonstrated a 2.3% (95% CI 0.1-4.5) chance
of cancer recurrence within 5 years. Patients classified as ‘High Risk’ by
MammaPrint® FFPE (135 adjuvantly treated and 17 adjuvantly not treated),
demonstrated a 11.5% (95% CI 6.0-17.0) chance of cancer recurrence within 5 years.
Kaplan-Meier curves showed a similar difference in DRFI between the Low and High
Risk comparing MammaPrint® and MammaPrint® FFPE.

MammaPrint® and MammaPrint® FFPE
MammaPrint® MammaPrint® FFPE
Prognostic assessment of MammaPrint® FFPE was further investigated using
univariate and multivariate analyses. In the univariate analysis, a MammaPrint®
FFPE High/Low Risk result is significantly associated with high/low risk for
recurrence. Multivariate analysis of the 345 samples analyzed did not conclusively
demonstrate prognostic significance for MammaPrint® FFPE beyond that of other
clinico-pathological factors. This is attributable to the RASTER study design, in
which MammaPrint® result was included along with all relevant clinico-pathological
factors, and treatment decisions were guided by assessed prognostic risk and the
standard of practice. In this real–world context, the overall cohort experienced a low
event rate which, despite the favorable trend, diminishes independent contribution of
MammaPrint® FFPE. Aggregate outcomes were broadly similar between study
patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy and study patients who did not.
