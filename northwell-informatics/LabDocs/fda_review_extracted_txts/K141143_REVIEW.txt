R2 is latex particles in glycine buffer coated with anti-Cystatin C antibodies (rabbit);
preservative and stabilizers.
Calibrator:
C.f.a.s. Cystatin C is a liquid, ready-to-use calibrator based on pooled delipidated human
serum enriched with recombinant human Cystatin C produced in E. Coli. Single level
calibrators with lot specific values are diluted on board the analyzer to create a 6-point
calibration curve.

L. Test Principle:
The Tina-quant Cystatin C Gen. 2 Assay is based on a latex enhanced immunoturbidimetric
assay. Cystatin C in the sample binds to the specific anti-Cystatin C antibody (rabbit), which
is coated on latex particles, and causes agglutination. The degree of the turbidity caused by
agglutination can be measured optically at 546 nm and is proportional to the amount of
Cystatin C in the sample.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed precision studies in accordance with the CLSI EP5-A2
guideline. Three control samples containing 1.0 mg/L, 1.8 mg/L, and 4.1 mg/L and
three human serum pools containing 0.56 mg/L, 2.80 mg/L and 6.39 mg/L Cystatin C
were analyzed in four replicates, twice a day, for 21 days (N=80) using one lot of
reagents on one, cobas c 501 analyzer. Results are summarized below:
Samples Mean Within-run precision Between-run precision
(mg/L) SD (mg/L) CV (%) SD (mg/L) CV (%)
Control 1 1.00 0.02 1.7 0.02 2.2
Control 2 1.84 0.02 0.9 0.03 1.4

serum 1
Human 2.80 0.02 0.6 0.04 1.3
serum 2
Human 6.39 0.04 0.6 0.07 1.1
serum 3
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor performed linearity studies in accordance with the CLSI EP6-A
guideline. 21 levels of serum based (in the range from 0.1 to 7.6 mg/L) and 13 levels
of plasma based (in the range from 0.1 to 8.9 mg/L) samples were tested in triplicates
on the cobas c501 analyzer.
Results are summarized below:
Linear regression equation for serum:
y = 1.001x - 0.0057 r = 1.000
Linear regression equation for plasma:
y = 1.006x – 0.0178 r2 = 1.000
The linearity data and the LoQ data support the sponsor’s claim that the measuring
range of this device is 0.4 to 6.8 mg/L.
Auto-rerun validation study: An auto-rerun study was performed to evaluate the
accuracy of the analyzer’s auto dilution function to obtain results for samples with
analyte concentrations above the measuring range. Three samples were used for the
study (7.26 mg/L; 8.75 mg/L and 9.87 mg/L). Each sample was manually diluted with
1:1.5 ratio. The results of the auto-rerun study support the claim that samples having
higher concentrations can be run via the rerun function which uses a 1:1.5 dilution.

High-dose hook effect: The potential for a high-dose hook effect was evaluated for
this assay. A serum sample containing 27.7 mg/L of Cystatin C was diluted up to the
lower end of the measuring range. The samples were analyzed in triplicate on one
cobas c 501 analyzer. Based on the results, the sponsor concluded that Cystatin C
levels up to 20 mg/L did not exhibit any high dose effect.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators: The calibrator is traceable to the European Reference Material ERM-
DA471/IFCC.
The calibrators were previously cleared in k080811 for use on the Hitachi 917
analyzer. Roche has verified the value assignment on the cobas c 501 analyzer (see
Value assignment below).
Controls: The typical assigned values for the Cystatin C Control Set Gen.2 are:
Low Level: 0.90 - 1.30 mg/L
Mid Level: 1.20 – 2.00 mg/L
High Level: 4.00 – 5.00 mg/L
The Low and High levels were previously cleared in k080811 for use on the Hitachi
917 analyzer. The addition of a Mid-level control and the cobas c 501 analyzer are the
only differences between this control set and the one that was cleared in k080811.
Value assignment: In order to transfer the values previously obtained for the
calibrator and the Low and High level controls to the cobas c501, Roche verified the
value assignment obtained in k080811 and for the new Mid level control previously
assigned on the Hitachi 917 analyzer by running the calibrator and control material
(all three levels) in triplicate, using 2 lots in 3 runs on the cobas c 501 analyzer and
checked for the % recovery. The % recovery was within +/-2 % bias for the calibrator
and +/-3% bias for the control material.
Stability:
Calibrators and Controls:
Closed vial stability claim of 24 months for the calibrator and 10 months for the
controls at 2-8oC was supported by a real-time stability study performed on the cobas
c 501 analyzer.
The open vial stability claim of 30 days at 2-8oC was established in k080811. Open
vial stability of 30 days at 2-8oC for the Mid Level Control was established on the
cobac c 501 analyzer.
Reagents:
Closed reagent stability was assessed on the cobas c 501 analyzer at day 0, 5 months,
8 months and 17 months. The real-time stability testing is still on-going and the
results support the sponsor’s current shelf-life claim
6

--- Page 7 ---
of 15 months at 2-8oC.
On-board reagent stability was assessed on the cobas c 501 analyzer and the results
support the sponsor’s open vial claims of 30 days when stored on-board or at 2-8oC.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor determined the limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit
of quantitation (LoQ) according to the CLSI EP-17-A guideline.
The limit of the blank (LoB) was determined by analyzing a blank sample with 60
replicates daily for 3 days on the cobas c 501 analyzer. The LoB was calculated as the
95th percentile which is the average of the 57th and 58th highest values for the true
blanks and was determined to be 0.3 mg/L.
To determine the LoD five low patient serum samples (0.08; 0.19, 0.77, 1.22 and 1.74
mg/L) were tested in 6 runs daily for 3 days on the cobas c 501 analyzer. The results
demonstrated that the LoD is 0.4 mg/L.
To determine the LoQ 5 diluted patient serum samples (0.645, 0.338, 0.439, 0.575
and 0.576 mg/L) were tested in 2 replicates, for 5 days on the cobas c 501 analyzer.
The results demonstrated that the LoQ is 0.4 mg/L at 13.3% CV.
The claimed measuring range of the device is 0.4 to 6.8 mg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Three to seven levels of each interferent were tested in triplicate with patient serum
samples representing low (~ 1 mg/L) and high (~ 6 mg/L) Cystatin C levels
(controls). The level of interference was considered not to be significant by the
sponsor if there was no more than 10% difference between the result in the presence
of the interferent and the control result. The table below lists the substances tested
and the concentrations at which no significant interference was observed:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 103 human serum samples in the range from 0.420 mg/mL to 6.21 mg/L
were tested on the candidate device and compared with the predicate device. The
results were calculated using Passing/Bablok and Linear regressions shown below:
Passing/Bablok (P/B): y = 0.997x - 0.064 r=0.937
Linear regression: y= 1.031x - 0.153 r= 0.988
b. Matrix comparison:
The effect of the presence of anticoagulants on analyte recovery is determined by
matrix comparison. A total of 57 tubes were collected per anticoagulant type and
filled completely, in addition 9 tubes (Gel Separation tubes, K EDTA), 8 tubes (Li-
2
Heparin) and 6 tubes (K EDTA) were half-filled covering the ranges specified in the
