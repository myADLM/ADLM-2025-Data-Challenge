K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI H59-A Quantitative D-dimer for the exclusion of venous thromboembolic disease;
Approved Guideline
L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on the change in turbidity of a microparticle suspension that is measured
by photometry. A suspension of latex microparticles, coated by covalent bonding with
monoclonal antibodies specific for D-dimer is mixed with the test plasma for which the D-
dimer level is to be assayed. An antigen-antibody reaction takes place, leading to an
agglutination of the latex microparticles which causes an increase in turbidity of the reaction
medium. This increase in turbidity is reflected by an increase in absorbance, the latter being
measured photometrically. The increase in absorbance is a function of the D-dimer level
present in the test sample. D-dimer levels are expressed in fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU).

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
i. Prospective study: A clinical multi-center study (9 sites over North America and
Europe) was performed to demonstrate the ability of STA® - Liatest® D-Di to
exclude pulmonary embolism (PE) using samples of outpatients enrolled in
emergency departments prospectively and consecutively. All patients suspected of
having a PE were evaluated with the Wells’ model to assess their pre-test
probability (PTP) score: low, moderate, or high.
Patients with a low or moderate PTP score were considered for D-dimer testing.
Those with a positive D-dimer result were referred to imaging studies. Those with
negative a D-dimer result were considered as not having PE and assigned to a
three-month follow up to evaluate a potential development of PE and were
included for analysis. Patients with high PTP were sent for imaging studies and
not included in the study population.
The prospective study population was enriched with US banked frozen samples
collected from a similar PE clinical study.
Sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) with upper and lower
limit of 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated with the STA® - Liatest®
D-Di using the previously cleared clinical cut-off of 0.50 μg/mL (FEU) in the
(low and moderate) PTP group of patients:
· US sites: A total of 358 samples of patients from two US clinical centers were
used for analysis.

ii. US banked samples: Data from banked samples were obtained from a plasma
bank in a similar previous prospective clinical PE study in four US sites. STA® -
Liatest® D-Di was performed on frozen plasma samples from patients diagnosed
with PE. Sample stability was assessed by comparison with results obtained prior
to freezing (fresh specimens). The results of the stability study were found to be
acceptable. Data from the stability study was used to enrich data of the
prospective study with positive and negative cases. A total of 70 samples were
used for analysis.

iii. Overall study population: A total of 1,130 samples of patients with a low or
moderate PTP were used for final analysis; 1060 samples were from prospective
study population and 70 samples were from the US banked frozen samples. The
overall prevalence of PE (low and moderate PTP patients) in the prospective
study population was 8.4% with 2.7% in the US population and 11.4% in the
OUS population.
