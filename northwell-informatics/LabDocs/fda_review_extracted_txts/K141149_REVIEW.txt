VITEK® 2 Gram Positive Ceftaroline is designed for antimicrobial susceptibility testing
of Gram positive microorganisms and is intended for use with the VITEK® 2 and
VITEK® 2 Compact Systems as a laboratory aid in the determination of in vitro
susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. VITEK® 2 Gram Positive Ceftaroline is a
quantitative test. Ceftaroline has been shown to be active against most strains of the
microorganisms listed below, according to the FDA label for this antimicrobial.
Active in vitro and in clinical infections
Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates) The
VITEK® 2 Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) is intended to be used with the
VITEK® 2 Systems for the automated quantitative or qualitative susceptibility testing of
isolated colonies for the most clinically significant aerobic gram-negative bacilli,
Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus spp. and clinically significant
yeast.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
VITEK® 2 and the VITEK® 2 Compact Systems
VITEK® 2 Systems 7.01 (PC version) software
I. Device Description:
Each VITEK® 2 test card contains 64 micro-wells. A control well containing only
microbiological culture media is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain
2

--- Page 3 ---
premeasured portions of a specific antibiotic combined with culture media. The bacterial or
yeast isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45 – 0.5% saline
before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK® 2
System automatically fills, seals and places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK® 2
Compact has a manual filling, sealing and loading operation. The VITEK® 2 Systems
monitor the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time. At the completion
of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the
interpretive category result for each antibiotic contained on the card.
The VITEK® 2 AST-GP Ceftaroline has the following concentrations in the card: 0.25, 0.5, 1,
and 2µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL). The MIC
result range for the VITEK®2 card is ≤0.06- ≥4µg/mL.

Each VITEK® 2 test card contains 64 micro-wells. A control well containing only

premeasured portions of a specific antibiotic combined with culture media. The bacterial or
yeast isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45 – 0.5% saline

of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the
interpretive category result for each antibiotic contained on the card.
The VITEK® 2 AST-GP Ceftaroline has the following concentrations in the card: 0.25, 0.5,

result range for the VITEK®2 card is ≤0.06- ≥4µg/mL
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using ten S. aureus isolates at three sites on three
separate days in triplicates. The study included the Auto-dilution and the Manual
dilution with the VITEK®2, and the Manual dilution with the VITEK®2 Compact.
All results were >95% reproducible.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolates were tested on every test occasion with the reference
method and the VITEK®2. The reference method QC results were in range for every
day tested. The VITEK®2 was tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate that
the system can produce QC results in the recommended range. The ceftaroline test
results demonstrate that the VITEK®2 can produce QC results within the expected
range.
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the auto-dilution and the
manual method of diluting the organisms. Results demonstrated that methods were
comparable with the same mode.

An additional QC study was performed with the VITEK®2 Compact, the secondary

auto dilution to inoculate the card. Results were as follows:

2. Comparison studies:
The reference method follows the CLSI approved broth microdilution testing conditions
for ceftaroline:
· Medium: Mueller-Hinton broth with the appropriate dilutions of antimicrobial
solution added.
· Inoculum: Direct colony suspension
· Incubation : 35°C, ambient air, 16 - 20 hours
It is noted in the FDA approved pharmaceutical labeling for ceftaroline that broth dilution
MICs need to be read within 18 hours due to degradation of ceftaroline activity by 24
hours. The sponsor conducted a study with 52 S. aureus isolates to evaluate the 18hrs vs.
20hrs read for the reference method result. The 20hrs read and the 18hrs read were in
agreement.
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical comparative study was performed at three external sites using the VITEK®2
AST- GP Ceftaroline card and the reference broth microdilution containing
Ceftaroline. A total of 302 clinical isolates were tested by auto inoculation and 106
of the 302 isolates were stock isolates (35.1%, 106/302). All Staphylococcus aureus
isolates grew in the study.
The clinical isolates were comprised of 48.8% of oxacillin resistant S. aureus
(MRSA) and 51.2% of oxacillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA); all 78 challenge
isolates were MRSA and were tested at one external site. The VITEK®2 performance
was presented in the table below:

MRSA (clinical+ challenge)
The majority of MIC values were at 0.5µg/mL; there were 14 isolates at the
breakpoint of 1µg/mL, with one minor error, but within EA. The other minor error
was two dilutions higher [reference: 0.5 (S), VITEK®2: 2 (I)].

The MIC result ranges were 0.125- 0.25µg/mL, with 116 MSSA at 0.25µg/mL.
There was one minor error [reference: 2 (I), VITEK®2: 0.25(S)].
The comparative study did not include any ceftaroline resistant S. aureus and a
limitation is in place for the ceftaroline/S. aureus combination in the labeling.
Manual Dilution:
The challenge set of 78 S. aureus isolates were tested at one external site by manual
inoculation method for VITEK®2 and VITEK®2 Compact with the following
performance.
