L. Test Principle:
The AmpliVue® GAS Assay detects GAS DNA isolated from throat swab specimens obtained from
symptomatic patients. The assay consists of three major steps: 1) specimen preparation, 2) isothermal
Helicase-Dependent Amplification (HDA) of a target sequence specific to GAS, and 3) detection of the
amplified DNA by target-specific hybridization probes via a colorimetric reaction on a lateral-flow strip
which is embedded in a self-contained disposable cassette to prevent amplicon contamination.
Patient specimen on a throat swab is transferred to a Lysis Tube and subjected to heat treatment at 95o C for
10 minutes. The heat-treated sample is diluted 10-fold in a Dilution
Tube, and then transferred to a Reaction Tube. A HDA reaction is carried out in the Reaction Tube which
contains lyophilized HDA reagents, dNTPs, primers and probes. Incubation at 64°C for 35 minutes results
in isothermal amplification of the target sequence by GAS specific primers. The amplified DNA is detected
by a set of specific detection probes included in the Reaction Tube: GAS target hybridizes to two specific
probes labeled with biotin-triethylene glycol (Bio-TEG) and 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM). A competitive
process control (PRC) is included in the Lysis Tube to monitor specimen processing and inhibitory
substances in clinical samples, reagent hybridizes to the PRC specific probes labeled with Bio-TEG and 2,4-
dinitrophenyl (DNP-TEG).
Detection of the amplified DNA with specific probes is achieved by AmpliVue cassettes.
The AmpliVue cassettes carry lateral-flow DNA detection strips with of with an internal control stripe of
anti-DNP antibodies (C-line) and a test stripe anti-FAM antibodies (T2-line). GAS amplicon with Bio-TEG
and 6-FAM-labeled probes is captured by anti-FAM antibodies at the T2-line, while the internal control
amplicon with Bio-TEG and DNP-labeled probes is captured by anti-DNP antibodies at the C-line. The
biotin in the amplicon-probe complexes captures the streptavidin-conjugated color particles for visualization
and the test result is shown as colored lines that are visually read.
A positive result for GAS (detection of GAS DNA) is reported when the T2-line is visible through the
detection window of the cassette. A negative result (no detection of GAS DNA) is reported when only the
C-line is displayed. The assay result is regarded as invalid when the T2-line and C-line are not present and
the assay should be repeated. The total time to run this assay is 55-70 minutes.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:

The reproducibility of the AmpliVue® GAS Assay was evaluated at three (3) laboratory sites (two
external, one in-house). Reproducibility was assessed using a panel of four (4) simulated samples
that include moderate positive and low positive, high negative and negative GAS. The panels and
controls were processed and tested on the AmpliVue® GAS Assay at each site by 2 operators for 5
non-consecutive days (2 operators x 3 replicates x 5 days x 3 sites = 90 results per concentration).
The LoD values were based on the values obtained in the LoD study. The reproducibility study
results are acceptable. The results are shown in the Table II below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
AmpliVue® GAS Assay incorporates a process control in the lysis buffer tube that is used to monitor
sample processing and evaluate the presence of inhibitory substances and to confirm the integrity of
assay reagents and cassette detection. The Quidel Molecular A + G Streptococci Control Set #M111,
which contains positive and negative controls, serves as an external processing and extraction
controls for the AmpliVue® GAS Assay and were run each day of testing.
Studies were performed to determine the stability of specimens collected using the following
routinely used swab systems: flocked nylon, rayon and polyester swabs in Amies media, and rayon
and polyester swabs in Stuart media, and rayon swabs in Amies gel. Contrived negative matrix was
spiked with fresh GAS (ATCC 12344) at 1 x LoD was used to inoculate the swabs listed above. The
spiked samples were tested with the AmpliVue® GAS Assay. Triplicate testing for each condition
with each collection/transport system listed above demonstrated that specimens can be stored at
25°C ± 2°C for 2 days and then at 2 to 8°C for up to 8 more days before testing or at ≤-15oC or ≤-
70oC for up to 32 days before testing.
These study results are acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) of the AmpliVue® GAS Assay was determined using quantified
(CFU/mL) contrived stocks of two strains of group A streptococci serially diluted in a negative
matrix (see table below). For each strain, 20 replicates were tested for each of three (3) dilutions.
The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration at which at least 95% of all replicates tested positive.
The LoD study results are shown in Table III below.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Performance characteristics of the AmpliVue®GAS Assay were established during a prospective
study conducted from February to March 2014. One thousand one hundred ninety-two (1192) fresh,
throat swab specimens from female and male patients were prospectively collected and transported
to each laboratory for testing with the AmpliVue® GAS Assay at five distinct geographical sites
across the United States. A single specimen was collected per patient. Samples were collected using
Polyester or Rayon Swab with liquid Amie’s or Polyester Swab or Rayon with liquid Stuart’s. All
one thousand one hundred ninety-two (1192) fresh throat specimens were cultured for Group A β-
hemolytic Streptococcus (GAS) and tested with AmpliVue®GAS Assay. The swab specimens were
cultured at the testing sites and the transport fluid was cultured at a central location. The specimen
was considered positive if culture from either the swab or the transport fluid was positive for Group
A β-hemolytic Streptococcus and this was referred to as Composite Culture. Specimens that returned
an invalid result were retested. If the retest was invalid, then the final result was determined to be
invalid. One result was determined to be invalid in these studies.
The clinical performance of the AmpliVue® GAS Assay was demonstrated with one thousand one
hundred ninety one (1191) prospectively collected fresh throat specimens at five (5) sites across the
United States. The breakdown of performance for AmpliVue® GAS Assay is summarized in Table
VII below:

The external quality control isolates used in these studies were from the Control Set #M111
consisting of Streptococcus pyogenes Z018 and Streptococcus dysgalactiae Z068, which serve as
processing and extraction controls. The positive and negative external control isolates were tested
each day during the clinical studies. All Group A Streptococcus positive controls were detected
accurately (100%, 63/63). All Group G Streptococcus negative controls were detected accurately
(100%, 63/63).
These study results are acceptable.
Rationale and criteria for the exclusion of culture confirmation of assay-negative GAS results:
Several parameters including sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV), analyte prevalence and
data distribution across sites were considered in order to establish a set of criteria to be used for
deciding whether to include a statement requiring follow-up culture for negative results in the
Intended Use for GAS assays or not.
Based on the overall information available to FDA from multiple clinical studies over the last 12
years and a comprehensive benefit-risk assessment, the following criteria for sensitivity and negative
predictive value (NPV) should be demonstrated to exclude the statement requiring follow-up culture
for negative results in the Intended Use for GAS assays:
1) Overall sensitivity ≥98%, with the lower bound of the 95% CI of ≥93% from ≥ 100 positive
specimens, and
2) Overall NPV ≥99%, with the lower bound of the 95% CI of ≥97% extrapolated based on
30% prevalence (recent studies presented to the FDA indicated that it is unlikely that the
prevalence for GAS will exceed 30% during the peak season for GAS pharyngitis), and
3) Each testing site demonstrates an NPV of ≥98% and an approximately even distribution of
samples is observed among the sites.
The overall sensitivity of the AmpliVue® GAS Assay is 98.4% with the lower bound of the 95% CI
of 95.5%, the overall NPV is 99.7% with the lower bound of the 95% CI of 99.0% at a prevalence of

16.1% encountered in this study, with the lowest site NPV of 98.7% (Site 5). When extrapolated to a
prevalence of 30%, the overall NPV is 99.3% with a lower bound of the 95% CI of 97.9%. Based on
these values and the criteria noted above, there is no need to add a statement requiring follow-up
culture for negative results in the Intended Use for this assay.
However, to further mitigate the risks of a false negative result, the following limitation is added to
the limitation section of the package insert: “Additional follow-up testing using the culture method is
required if the result is negative and clinical symptoms persist, or in the event of an acute rheumatic
fever (ARF) outbreak.”
b. Clinical specificity:
See table above.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not Applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The overall incidence of Group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus in patients tested during this study was
16.1% (192/1191) based on composite bacterial culture and 20.1% (239/1191) based on the Amplivue®
GAS Assay. All clinical specimens collected during this study were collected between February, 2014
and March 2014.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence
decision.
