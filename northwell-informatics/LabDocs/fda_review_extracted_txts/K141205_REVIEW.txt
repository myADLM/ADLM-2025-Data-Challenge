2. Indication(s) for use:
The LZI Oral Fluid 6-Acetylmorphine Enzyme Immunoassay is intended for the
qualitative and semi-quantitative determination of 6-Acetylmorphine in neat human oral
fluid, collected into the LZI Oral Fluid Collector, at the cutoff value of 4 ng/mL. The
assay is designed for prescription use with a number of automated clinical chemistry
analyzers.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of (1) enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as
GCMS and LCMS or (2) permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.
The LZI Oral Fluid 6-Acetylmorphine Calibrators are for use as calibrators in the
qualitative and semi-quantitative calibration of the LZI Oral Fluid 6-Acetylmorphine
Enzyme Immunoassay at the cutoff value of 4 ng/mL.
The LZI Oral Fluid 6-Acetylmorphine Controls are for use as assayed quality control
materials to monitor the precision of the LZI Oral Fluid 6-Acetylmorphine Enzyme
Immunoassay at the cutoff value of 4 ng/mL.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific alternative
chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas or
liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS or LC/MS) is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary test result
is positive.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The assay is designed for prescription use with a number of clinical chemistry analyzers.
Performance data was obtained using the Beckman AU400e clinical analyzer.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
EP5-A, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices, Vol. 19, No.2,
February 1999
L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the
enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for a fixed amount of antibody in the
reagent. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, and the drug concentration
in the sample is measured in terms of enzyme activity. In the absence of drug in the sample,
6-Acetylmorphine-labeled G6PDH conjugate is bound to antibody, and the enzyme activity
is inhibited. When free drug is present in the sample, antibody binds to free drug and the
unbound 6-Acetylmorphine -labeled G6PDH exhibits its maximal enzyme activity. Active
enzyme converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH, resulting in an
absorbance change that can be measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision performance of the qualitative and semi-quantitative assays was
evaluated on a single Beckman AU400e clinical analyzer. A tertiary stock solution of
6-Acetylmorphine at 20 ng/mL was spiked into negative neat human oral fluid to
obtain the target concentrations shown below. Samples were tested in duplicate, twice
a day for 20 days (total n = 80). All concentrations for precision studies were
confirmed by GC/MS testing. Testing was conducted by one operator. A summary of
the results for each concentration for qualitative and semi-quantitative modes is

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity and % recovery across the range was tested by diluting a commercially
available 6-Acetylmorphine standard down to 20 ng/mL, which served as the highest
concentration sample evaluated. The 20 ng/mL concentration sample was then
diluted to reach the final concentrations (expected values) listed below. Each sample
was run in replicates of 10 on the Beckman AU400e automated clinical analyzer in
semi-quantitative mode with a calibration curve established with the Oral Fluid 6-
Acetylmorphine calibrators (0, 2, 4, 10, and 20 ng/mL). The average results were
compared to the expected results and percent recovery was calculated.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The starting material for calibrators and controls is a commercially available 6-
Acetylmorphine stock solution of 100 µg/mL of 99.8% purity. Gravimetric
preparation was performed using balances calibrated with NIST traceable weights.
Value Assignment
A secondary stock solution of 1µg/mL (made from the commercially available
standard noted above) was spiked into the synthetic negative oral fluid to the desired
concentration for calibrators and controls. The resulting concentrations were
confirmed by GC/MS.
Stability
Opened vial: Real time studies have been conducted for calibrators and controls at 2-
8 ºC. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable to
support the sponsor’s claimed opened vial stability of 6 months.

Shipping/Recovery Study
A shipping study was performed to demonstrate the recovery of drug from oral fluid
when collected in the LZI Oral Fluid Collector collection tube (provided for
confirmation testing) by testing expected transport conditions. Conditions simulating
transport to 3 different destinations with varied weather conditions (-20 ºC, 2-8ºC,
room temperature and 30ºC) were performed. Four sets of pooled negative oral fluid
samples were spiked with 6-Acetylmorphine into glass flasks to concentrations of 2,
6, 10, and 20 ng/mL. One (1) mL of each concentration (2, 6, 10, and 20 ng/mL) was
transferred to an amber glass vial stored cold (2-8 °C) for GC/MS analysis. These
samples served as pre-shipping controls as well as controls for the recovery of analyte
from the polypropylene collection tubes The samples at each concentration were then
pipetted (4.5 mL) into individual LZI Oral Fluid Collectors and kept at one of the 4
storage temperatures over 3 days. After 72 hours, all 16 samples were brought to
room temperature and tested with LZI Oral Fluid 6-Acetylmorphine Enzyme
Immunoassay. A total of 20 samples were evaluated, consisting of 16 post-shipping
and 4 pre-shipping controls. Recoveries for the samples at 2, 6, 10, and 20 ng/mL
after 72 hours and when compared to the Day 0 values ranged from 80.0% - 106.7%.

The sponsor states in their labeling that confirmatory test samples should always be
shipped cold (2-8 ºC), packed in gel ice and shipped for next day delivery (within 24
hours).
Sample Storage and Stability
Real time and accelerated stability studies have been conducted at concentrations of
2, 6, 10, and 20 ng/mL for sample storage at four conditions (frozen, room
temperature, refrigerated and 30 ºC). Samples were collected into and stored in the
oral fluid collection tubes. At 2 – 8°C, recoveries ranged from 98 – 102%. At -20° C
recoveries ranged from 89% - 101%. Real time stability studies are ongoing.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The
manufacturer claims in their labeling that 6-Acetylmorphine saliva samples may be
stored in the LZI Oral Fluid Collectors (polypropylene collection tubes) for up to two
weeks when stored at 2-8 °C, or up to 3 months when stored at -20 °C.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
The potential effect of endogenous and exogenous interferents was tested by spiking
the interferents into negative oral fluid to the desired concentrations (shown below).
A portion of the oral fluid containing the interferents was then spiked to a
concentration of 2 ng/mL 6-Acetylmorphine (-50% cut-off) or 6 ng/mL 6-
Acetylmorphine (+50% cut-off). No interference was observed with the substances
tested at concentrations as shown in the tables below. Labeling indicates ascorbic acid
concentrations above 3 mg/mL cause false-negative results.
