resuspended using resuspension buffer by pipetting up and down with a transfer pipette. The
reagent cartridge is then loaded onto the BIO-FLASH instrument. Samples are also loaded
onto the instrument in sample racks. A patient serum sample is prediluted by the BIO-
FLASH with system rinse buffer in a disposable plastic cuvette. A small amount of the
diluted patient serum, the beads, and assay buffer are all combined into a second cuvette, and
mixed. This cuvette is then incubated at 37⁰C. The beads are magnetized and washed several
times. Isoluminol conjugated anti-human IgG antibodies are then added to the cuvette, and
again incubated at 37⁰C. The beads are magnetically bound to the cuvette wall and washed
repeatedly. The isoluminol conjugate is oxidized when the “Triggers” are added to the
cuvette, and the flash of light produced from this reaction is measured as Relative Light Units
(RLU) by the BIO-FLASH optical system. The RLU are proportional to the amount of
isoluminol conjugate that is bound to the human IgG, which is in turn proportional to the
amount of anti- SS-B antibodies bound to the SS-B on the beads.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the AMR was evaluated by a study according to CLSI EP6-A. Five
serum samples with various SS-B antibody concentrations were diluted in 10%
increments (from 0% to 90% diluent) with System Rinse to obtain values that cover
the AMR. The resulting dilutions were assayed in duplicates, and obtained values
were plotted against the expected values, calculated based on the dilution factor.
Linear regression analysis was performed on each dataset with the Analyse-it for
Excel method evaluation software, and the slope and intercept of the regression line,
as well as the R2 values were calculated.

The data indicate that for the claimed analytical measuring range of 3.3 – 1550
CU, all specimens met the manufacturer’s pre-determined linearity and dilutional
recovery acceptance criteria.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
There are currently no recognized international standards for the measurement of
anti-SS-B antibodies.
Calibrator and Control values are directly traceable to in-house standards that are
used to create the Master Curves for the QUANTA Flash SS-B assay.
Value Assignment:
The QUANTA Flash SS-B Calibrators and Controls are manufactured by diluting
human serum that contains high titer of anti-SS-B antibodies with commercial
antibody stabilizer, containing preservative. The human serum is obtained from
commercial sources and it is tested for markers of infectious substances. The
target CU is achieved through trial dilutions on small scale. Once a dilution is
selected, the Calibrators and Control are bulked, tested, and adjusted. Upon
completion of the manufacturing process, the Calibrators and Controls are tested
on at least two instruments, on at least two lots of reagent cartridge, in replicates
of 10 to determine final value assignment.
Stability:
Shelf life stability:
Real time stability testing performed at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months on Calibrators,
Controls and reagent cartridge supports a one year expiration claim.
On-board stability:

Calibrators:
During assessing on-board stability, Calibrators were placed uncapped, onboard
the instrument, and calibration was performed altogether five times over 8.5
hours. Controls and a panel of characterized patient specimens were run on each
calibration curve. The manufacturer tested Calibrators are considered stable if all
five calibrations performed in the 8.5 hour period are successful, and average
Calibrator RLU recovery values are between 90% and 110% compared to the first
use. Each Calibrator is measured in triplicate during calibration. The acceptance
criteria were met, and the data support the claim that calibrators can be used for
up to 4 calibrations over an 8 hour period.
Controls:
During assessment of on-board stability, two vials of each Control were assayed
twice a day for a total of 21 runs. The first run was used to establish baseline
value, and then an additional 20 runs were performed. During runs, the Controls
were left uncapped, onboard the instrument for 15 minutes per run. When not in
use, the controls were capped, and stored at 5º ± 3°. Controls are considered stable
by the manufacturer when all replicates are within their stated range, and the
linear regression line obtained by plotting percent recovery values against the
number of runs stays between 85% and 115% at Run 15. All controls ran within
their respective acceptable ranges for all runs and the regression line remained
between 85% and 115% at Run 15 for both Controls. These results support the
claim that controls can be used for up to 15 times, at 10 minutes per use, when
stored at the manufacturer’s recommended temperature.
Reagent Cartridge:
To establish the in-use stability of the QUANTA Flash SS-B reagent cartridge,
three lots of cartridges were tested with up to six serum specimens along with the
Negative and Positive Controls. The specimens were tested periodically up to 69
days.
Using the above criteria, each of the three lots met the manufacturer’s pre-
determined acceptance criteria for stability at for 57, 60, and 68 days. Based on
this, 57 days stability is claimed for the reagent cartridge.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank:
Four blank samples (SS-B: system rinse) from two different lots were run in
replicates of five on two reagent lots, once per day, for 3 days. Sixty (60) data points
per lot were generated. As the results followed a normal distribution, the LoB for
each lot was calculated separately with the Analyse-it for Excel software’s Reference
Interval function, at the 95th percentile, using the parametric method. The LoB for the
two lots was determined to be 269 RLU and 294 RLU. The claimed LoB value is 294
RLU.
9

--- Page 10 ---
Limit of Detection:
Four low level samples (prepared by diluting anti-SS-B positive samples with System
Rinse) were run in replicates of five on two reagent lots, once per day, for 3 days.
Sixty (60) data points per lot were generated for both the LoB and LoD determination
on each lot.
LoD was calculated based on the formula published in the CLSI Guideline EP17-A:
LoD = LoB + (c *SD ), where:
p L
c = 1.645/(1-1/(4*f))
p
f = (# of total data points) – (# of samples used)
SD = Average of the SD’s for all samples
L
The LoD of the QUANTA Flash SS-B assay for the two lots were determined to be
360 and 398 RLU, which are below the value of the lowest QUANTA Flash SSB
Master Curve standard, and therefore below the Analytical Measuring Range of the
assay, e.g. < 3.3 CU. The claimed LoD is 398 RLU.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
The studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A2, Interference Testing in
Clinical Chemistry, Approved Guideline- Second Edition. Three specimens, a high
positive (200.3 CU), a low positive (25.5 CU) and a negative (15.4 CU) were tested.
Interfering substances were spiked into every specimen at three different
concentrations (final min and max concentrations as follows: hemoglobin 50-200
mg/dL; bilirubin 2.5-10 mg/dL; triglycerides 250-1000 mg/dL; rheumatoid factor
100-500 IU/mL) in 10% of total specimen volume, and the resulting samples were
assessed in triplicate with the SS-B assay. Recovery of the unit values was calculated
compared to control samples spiked with the same volume of diluent (10% of total).
No interference (< 10%) was detected with bilirubin up to 10 mg/dL; hemoglobin up
to 200 mg/dL, triglycerides up to 1,000 mg/dL. cholesterol up to 224.3 mg/dL. The
three specimens spiked with Rheumatoid Factor 1gM up to 500 IU/mL showed
recovery from 91% to 112%.
Cross Reactivity:
Cross reactivity was investigated using international reference sera from the Center of
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The CDC ANA reference sera #2 (reference
serum for human antibodies to SS-B/La) and #3 (reference serum, fluorescence
antinuclear antibody, speckled pattern) was tested for SS-B and produced the
following results: CDC ANA #2: 1634.9 CU; CDC ANA #3: 284.1 CU. The other 10
reference sera in the panel were analyzed and found to be negative for SS-B by this
assay.

f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off is 20 CU. Results <20 CU should be reported as negative and
results >20 CU should be reported as positive.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Samples for method comparison analysis included 639 samples from the clinical
validation studies (below) that had predicate ELISA results available. The cohort
consisted of Sjögren’s syndrome (n = 40) and SLE patients (n = 240) and relevant
disease controls (n = 359). No healthy controls were included in this cohort. Of the
639 samples, 142 samples fell within the analytical measuring range of the QUANTA
Flash SS-B.

Total Agreement (129/142) = 90.8% (95% C.I. = 84.9 – 95.0%)
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable since human serum is the only claimed specimen matrix.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
A cohort of characterized samples from serum libraries or on leftover serum
specimens was used to validate the clinical performance of the QUANTA Flash SS-
B. A total of 761 characterized samples were included in the Validation Set for the
QUANTA Flash SS-B. All samples were run on the QUANTA Flash SS-B. Samples
from patients with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) were excluded from
the sensitivity and specificity calculations as primary diagnosis is not known.

*Samples from patients with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) were excluded from
the sensitivity and specificity calculations as primary diagnosis is not known. Other Rheumatic
Diseases category was comprised of the following entities:
Gout, n=2; Gonarthrosis, Polymyalgia rheumatica, n=1; Poluarteriitis nodosa, n=2;
Polymyalgia rheumatica, n=10; Psoriatic arthritis , n=13; Psoriatic arthritis, Synovitis Acne
Pustulosis Hyperostosis Osteitis, n=1; Sarcoidosis, n=1; Seronegative spondylarthritis, n=10.
4. Clinical cut-off:
There is no clinically accepted cut-off defined for this analyte.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected value in the normal population is “negative”. Anti-SS-B autoantibody
levels were analyzed in a cohort of 138 apparently healthy blood donors (118 females
and 20 males, ages 17 to 60 years, with an average age of 32.8 years and median age
of 31 years) using the QUANTA Flash SS-B. This patient population was different
from that used to establish the cut-off, and was only used to assess expected values.
At the cut-off of 20 CU, one (0.7 %) sample was positive. The mean concentration
was < 3.3 CU, and the values ranged from <3.3 to 28.7 CU.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
