L. Test Principle:
Recombinant ß2GP1-Domain1 protein is coated onto paramagnetic beads, which are stored
lyophilized in the reagent cartridge. The reagent pack is prepared for use in the BIO-
FLASH® system by pressing down on the grey lid of the reagent pack to pierce the induction
seals on the reagent tubes. Once the seals are broken, the beads are rehydrated by adding the
entire contents of the vial of resuspension buffer to the bead reagent tube using the transfer
pipette supplied with the kit. Only the hole above the bead reagent tube is accessible at this
point. The beads are then mixed with the resuspension buffer by pipetting up and down 30
times. This amount of mixing ensures complete resuspension of the beads. The label
covering the remaining three reagent holes is now removed, and the reagent cartridge is then
loaded onto the BIO-FLASH instrument. Samples are also loaded onto the instrument in
sample racks. A patient serum sample is pre-diluted 1:10 by the BIO-FLASH with system
rinse in a small disposable plastic cuvette. Small amounts of the diluted patient serum, the

beads, and assay buffer are all combined into a second cuvette, and mixed. This cuvette is
then incubated at 37°C. The beads are magnetized and washed several times. Isoluminol
conjugated anti-human IgG antibodies are then added to the cuvette, and again incubated at
37°C. The beads are magnetized and washed repeatedly. The isoluminol conjugate is
oxidized when Trigger 1 and Trigger 2 are added to the cuvette, and the flash of light
produced from this reaction is measured as Relative Light Units (RLU) by the BIO-FLASH
optical system. The RLU are proportional to the amount of isoluminol conjugate that is
bound to the human IgG, which is in turn proportional to the amount of anti- ß2GP1-
Domain1 antibodies bound to the corresponding ß2GP1-Domain1 on the beads.
The QUANTA Flash® ß2GP1-Domain1 assay utilizes a pre-defined lot specific Master
Curve that is uploaded onto the instrument through the reagent cartridge barcode. Every new
lot number of reagent cartridge must be calibrated before first use, with the QUANTA
Flash® ß2GP1-Domain1 Calibrators. Based on the results obtained with the two Calibrators
included in the reagent kit, an instrument specific Working Curve is created, which is used to
calculate chemiluminescent units (CU) from the instrument signal (RLU) obtained for each
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Since the QUANTA Flash β2GP1-Domain1 assay and the HemosIL AcuStar β2GPI-
Domain 1 assay are identical, performance data for only the QUANTA Flash β2GP1-
Domain1 assay is shown below.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the QUANTA Flash® β2GP1-Domain1 assay was assessed in accordance
with CLSI EP5-A2, by running 8 serum samples that were selected to cover the
analytical measuring range of the assay, including samples around the medical
decision point. Patients were run using duplicate aliquots, twice a day, for 20 days for
a total of 80 replicates. Controls were run as quality control during each run. A
working curve was generated using calibrators prior to run 1 on day 1. Total %CV
values were within the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance limit of ≤10% -
15%. The results were analyzed by Analyse-It.

Lot-to-Lot:
A separate lot-to-lot comparison study was performed using 26 samples from
INOVA’s serum bank covering the analytical measuring range of the assay and
positive and negative controls. Samples were tested in duplicate with three different
reagent lots. All results were within the manufacturer’s pre-defined acceptance.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the analytical measuring range (AMR, 3.6 – 1380.4 CU) was
evaluated by a study according to CLSI EP6-A. Five serum samples with various
ß2GP1-Domain1 antibody concentrations were serially diluted to obtain 10
dilutions of each sample. Percent recovery of obtained results was calculated
compared to the expected results. Obtained values were plotted against expected
values, and linear regression analysis was performed using Analyse-It software.
The slope and intercept of the regression line were calculated with 95% CI as
well as the R2 values. All samples met the manufacturer’s pre-defined acceptance
criteria. Results of the study are summarized below:
Slope y-intercept
Sample Test Range (CU) R2 Recovery Range

5 1.0 – 10.3 0.99 90.9 – 113.9 %
(0.91 – 1.01) (-0.1 to 0.5)
The AMR is defined by the values of the lowest and highest Master Curve Standards.
The QUANTA Flash® β2GP1-Domain1 AMR is 3.6 CU to 1380.4 CU.
High dose hook effect:
To assess hook effect, the measurement signal (relative light units, RLU) was
examined for four high positive specimens, before and after automatic or manual
dilution. All sera produced significantly higher RLU values (above the AMR) when
used "as is" compared to the manually or automatically diluted values, thereby
confirming that high positive specimens above the analytical measuring range do not
show hook effect up to 435,000 RLU.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
There are currently no international reference standards for anti-ß2GP1-Domain1
antibodies. The assay is calibrated in relative arbitrary units (CU or U/mL). The
QUANTA Flash® β2GP1-Domain1 Calibrators and Controls are manufactured by
diluting human serum containing high titers of anti- β2GP1-Domain1 antibodies with
antibody stabilizer buffer. The human serum is obtained from commercial sources
and is tested for markers of infectious substances.
Value Assignment:
The QUANTA Flash® ß2GP1-Domain1 assay utilizes a pre-defined lot specific
Master Curve that is stored in the reagent pack barcode. The target CU is achieved
through trial dilutions on small scale. Once a dilution is selected, the Calibrators and
Control are bulked, tested, and adjusted. Calibrators and Controls are tested on at
least two instruments, on at least two lots of reagent cartridge, in replicates of 10 to
determine final value assignment.
Stability:
Stability studies have been performed and the results support the following claims:
Sample Stability:
Samples were shown to be stable (defined by the manufacturer as recovery of ≤ ±
15%) for up to 48 hours at room temperature, 21 days at 2-8°C, and can undergo
freeze/thaw up to 3 times.
Reagent Pack Stability:
Shelf Life: All components tested by accelerated stability testing (4 weeks at 37°C)
fulfilled the manufacturer’s pre-defined acceptance criteria, therefore one year
expiration dating was assigned to each component stored, unopened, at 2-8°C. Real
time stability is ongoing and currently supports a claim of 12 months.
Open/In use (onboard) Stability:
Opened reagent packs must be stored on-board the instrument. The in-use (on-board)
stability of the reagent cartridge was set at 60 days.
Calibration Stability:
Shelf Life: Calibrators tested by accelerated stability testing (4 weeks at 37°C)
fulfilled the manufacturer’s pre-defined acceptance criteria, supporting assignment of
a one year expiration dating to each component at 2-8°C. Real time stability is
ongoing and currently supports a claim of 12 months.
In use (onboard) Stability:
Calibrators can be used for up to 4 calibrations over an 8 hour period onboard the
instrument.
9

--- Page 10 ---
Control Stability:
Shelf Life: Controls tested by accelerated stability testing (4 weeks at 37°C) fulfilled
the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria, so one year expiration dating was assigned to
each component at 2-8°C. Real time stability is ongoing and currently supports a
claim of 12 months.
Open/In use (onboard) Stability: The controls were given a maximum of 15 uses with
a maximum of 10 minutes onboard the instrument per use. The total time the control
tubes can be used is 2.5 hours or 10 minutes per use.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB):
For the QUANTA Flash β2GP1-Domain1 assay, the LoB was determined according
to CLSI EP17-A guideline by running 58 measurements on blank samples.
For the QUANTA Flash β2GP1-Domain1 assay the LoB was determined to 425.7
RLU. The LoB value is below the bottom limit of the curve that the instrument uses
to calculate chemiluminescent units (CU), and therefore cannot be converted into CU.
Limit of Detection (LoD):
The LoD of the QUANTA Flash® ß2GP1-Domain1 assay is 1296 RLU, which is
below the analytical measuring range of the assay. LoD was determined using the
CLSI EP17-A guideline with proportions of false positives (alpha) less than 5% and
false negatives (beta) less than 5%; based on 264 determinations, with 144
measurements on blank samples and 120 measurements of low level samples. The
LoD value is below the bottom limit of the curve that the instrument uses to calculate
chemiluminescent units (CU), and therefore cannot be converted into CU. The LoD is
below the lower limit of the reportable range, e.g. < 3.6 CU.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
The interference study was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2. Three specimens
were tested (negative: 10.7 CU; positive: 55.9 CU; high positive: 446.6 CU). Each
interfering substance was spiked into each specimen at three different concentrations
per CLSI EP07-A2 and the resulting samples were assessed in triplicate. Recovery of
the unit values was calculated compared to control samples spiked with the same
volume of diluents (10% of total).
No interference (defined by the manufacturer as ≤ ±15%, or ±4 CU difference,

Cross-Reactivity:
A potential cross-reactivity of the QUANTA Flash® ß2GP1 Domain1 CIA with other
autoantibodies was evaluated with 111 clinical samples with unknown disease states,
most having high levels of various other autoantibodies. These samples were known
to be positive for various other autoantibodies including: Sm, RNP, SS-A/Ro60,
Ro52, SS-B, Jo-1, Scl-70, CENP, Ribosomal P, and DFS70. These are autoantibodies
found in individuals with autoimmune diseases such as Systemic Lupus Erythematous
(SLE), Sjögren’s Syndrome, scleroderma, and polymyositis patients. All samples,
except for two, scleroderma samples, were negative for QUANTA Flash® ß2GP1
Domain1 CIA.
f. Assay cut-off:
The reference population for establishing the reference interval for the ß2GP1-
Domain1 assay consisted of 30 subjects with various conditions including infectious
diseases and SLE without a history of thrombotic events.
All specimens were the same matrix as specified in the Intended Use. All specimens
were unaltered. The cut-off was established Using Analyse-it for Excel, to ensure
optimal differentiation between negatives and positives, and found at 7880 RLU. This
point was defined as 20 CU. A result below 20 CU is considered negative and greater
than 20 CU is considered positive.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Samples for method comparison analysis included those samples from the clinical
validation study (below) that were within the reportable range of the assay. For the
first table for the analyte, only samples within the measuring ranges defined by the
lowest and highest calibrators of the QUANTA Flash ß2GP1-Domain1 and predicate
assay is included in the method comparison. The 238 samples in this cohort included
183 APS samples and eight contrived samples within ± 25% of the assay cut-off.
Twenty-two samples (9.2%) were within ± 25% of the assay cut-off.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Clinical specificity:
A set of 1090 samples, none of which were used in establishing the reference range, was
used to validate the clinical performance of the QUANTA Flash β2GP1-Domain1 CIA.
The validation set consists of a set of clinically characterized sera from Primary APS,
Secondary APS, and non-APS diseased controls. The results of the QUANTA Flash
β2GP1-Domain1 CIA device in each disease category are shown below:

While antibodies to Domain 1 of β2GP1 may be important in the pathology of APS,
the test should be used in conjunction with whole β2GP1 molecule testing to aid in
establishing a diagnosis of APS per the current practice guidelines outlined in the APS
Classification Criteria1 (Sydney 2006).
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not Applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected value in the normal population is “negative”. Anti- ß2GP1-Domain1
antibody levels were analyzed in a cohort of 400 apparently healthy blood donors (191
females, ages 17 to 60 years, average age 32.2 years, and 209 males ages 17 to 60 years,
average age 34.7 years) using the QUANTA Flash® ß2GP1-Domain1. This patient
population was different from the one that was used to establish the cut-off. With a cut-
off of 20 CU, one sample (0.2%) was positive (34.2 CU) on the QUANTA Flash ß2GP1-
Domain1. The mean concentration was 3.8 CU, the median concentration 3.6 CU, and the
values ranged from <3.6 to 34.2 CU.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
