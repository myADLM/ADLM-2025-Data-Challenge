I. Device Description:
The TC-Thunderbolt Automated Urine Analyzer System is an automated urine chemistry
analyzer design for use with the TC-Thunderbolt Urine Reagent Strips. The system
transfers a urine sample via a sample-suction needle and pipe, which extracts and applies
the sample to the test strip; the test module then uses the principle of light-reflection to
determine the changes in paper color, conduct a digital analysis on the central portion
most uniform in color of the paper, and obtain results. When one specimen is finished,
the device automatically cleans itself and extracts the next specimen to repeat the testing
process, and if required, prints and saves the urine analysis report.

L. Test Principle:
Glucose: This test is based on a double sequential enzyme reaction. One enzyme, glucose
oxidase, catalyzes the formation of gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide from the oxidation
of glucose. A second enzyme, peroxidase, catalyzes the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with
potassium iodide chromogen to oxidize the chromogen to colors ranging from blue-green to
greenish-brown through brown and dark brown.
Bilirubin: This test is based on the coupling of bilirubin with a diazotized dichloroaniline in
a strongly acid medium. The colors range from light tan to reddish-brown.
Ketone: This test is based on the reaction of acetoacetic acid with sodium nitroprusside in a
strongly basic medium. The colors range from beige or buff-pink color for a “Negative”
reading to pink and pink-purple for a “Positive” reading.
Specific Gravity: This test is based on the apparent pKa change of certain pretreated
polyelectrolytes in relation to the ionic concentration. In the presence of an indicator, the
colors range from dark blue or blue-green in urine of low ionic concentration to green and
yellow-green in urine of higher ionic concentration.
Blood: This test is based on the pseudoperoxidase action of hemoglobin and erythrocytes,
which catalyzes the reaction of 3’,3’,5’,5’-tetramethyl-benzidine and buffered organic
peroxide. The resulting colors range from orange to yellow-green and dark green. Very high
blood concentration may cause the color development to continue to dark blue.
pH: This test is based on the well known double pH indicator method, where bromothymol
blue and methyl red give distinguishable colors over the pH range of 5-9. The colors range
from red-orange to yellow and yellow-green to blue-green.

Protein: This test is based on the protein error-of-indicator principle. At a constant pH, the
development of any green color is due to the presence of protein. Colors range from yellow
for a “Negative” reaction to yellow-green and green to blue-green for a “Positive” reaction.
Urobilinogen: This test is based on a modified Ehrlich reaction in which p-
diethylaminobenzaldehyde reacts with urobilinogen in a strongly acid medium. Colors range
from light pink to bright magenta.
Nitrite: This test depends on the conversion of nitrate to nitrite by the action of Gram-
negative bacteria in the urine. The nitrite reacts with p-arsanilic acid to from a diazonium
compound in an acid medium. The diazonium compound in turn couples with 1,2,3,4-
tetrahydrobenzo(h) quinolin to produce a pink color.
Leukocytes: This test is based on the action of esterase present in leukocytes, which
catalyzes the hydrolysis of an indoxyl ester derivative. The indoxyl ester liberated reacts with
a diazonium salt to produce a beige-pink to purple color.

concentrations of analytes relative to each color block on the test strip. Samples were
performed in replicates of 7 by three operators on three reagents strip lots for a total
of 21 measurements for every sample. A pH meter was used to confirm the pH
results. The specific gravity was confirmed by a clinical, handheld refractometer. A
specific gravity reading of 1.000 was obtained from distilled water. The reportable
range for each pad is defined as the concentration(s) at which there is a >90% exact

Shelf-life and open-vial stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
found to be acceptable for the TC-Thunderbolt URS-10 strips. The stability studies
support the following manufacturer’s claim: The strips can be stored between 15°C -
30°C (59°F-86°F) out of direct sunlight for 28 months. The open-vial stability is for
90 days at room temperature (15-30°C).
d. Detection limit:
A study was performed to validate the cutoff concentration for each analyte on the
TC-Thunderbolt URS-10 strip. Urine samples were prepared by spiking a negative
urine pool with a minimum of 4 levels across the measuring range for each analyte
concentration. The samples were analyzed in replicates of 7 by three operators on
three reagent strip lots, for a total of 21 data points for each level. The low cut-off
concentration for each color block was defined as the lowest concentration at which
≥55% of the test results are positive for each color block.
Summary of the performance at each color block for the tested analyte
concentrations:

e. Analytical specificity:
Studies were performed to assess the effect of various potential interferents on the test
results of the TC-Thunderbolt Automated Urine Analyzer System Testing was
performed using two urine pools with negative and positive concentrations for all
analytes. The positive pool was prepared by spiking each analyte into a negative
urine sample. Each urine sample was tested in 3 replicates using the TC-Thunderbolt
Automated Urine Analyzer System. Possible interference was noted when a
difference of one color pad in any of the three replicates for the particular test analyte
compared to either the negative (specificity) or analyte-spiked positive sample
(interference).

In addition to the interference described in the table above, the sponsor states the
following in the labeling regarding other potential interfering substances: The TC-
Thunderbolt URS-10 Reagent strips may be affected by substances that cause
abnormal urine color such as drugs containing azo dyes (e.g. Pyridium, Azo
Gantrisin, Azo Gantanol), Cephalexin and Gentamicin.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed using a single replicate of each clinical
specimen between the TC-Thunderbolt URS-10 Strips on the TC-Thunderbolt
Automated Urine Analyzer System and the Teco Diagnostic’s URS-10 strips on the
Uritek-720+ Urine Analyzer. Clinical samples were analyzed for the first positive
color block above the negative. No spiked samples were used. Clinically positive
spiked samples were used when insufficient numbers of high concentration samples
were not available. These spiked samples represent less than 5% of the total samples
tested.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Glucose: Small amounts of glucose are normally excreted by the kidney.3 Concentrations
as little as 0.1 g/dl glucose, read either at 10 or 30 seconds, may be significantly
abnormal if found consistently.
Bilirubin: Normally, no bilirubin is detectable in urine by even the most sensitive
method. Even trace amounts of bilirubin are sufficiently abnormal to require further
investigation. Atypical colors (colors produced which are different than the negative or
positive color blocks shown on the Color Chart) may indicate that bilirubin derived bile
pigments are present in the urine sample and are possibly masking the bilirubin reaction.
Ketone: Normally, no ketones are present in urine. Detectable levels of ketone may
occur in urine during physiological stress conditions such as fasting, pregnancy, and
frequent strenuous exercise.4-6 In starvation diets, or in other abnormal carbohydrate
metabolism situation, ketones appear in the urine in excessively large amounts before
serum ketones are elevated.7
Specific Gravity: Random urine may vary in specific gravity from 1.003-1.040+.
Twenty-four hour urine from normal adults with normal diets and normal fluid intake
will have a specific gravity of 1.016-1.022.8 In severe renal damage, the specific gravity
is fixed at 1.010, the value of the glomerular filtrate.
Blood: Any green spots or green color developing on the reagent area within 40 seconds
is significant and the urine should be examined further. Blood is frequently, but not
invariably found in the urine of menstruating females.
pH: 4.5-8.0 average: 6.0.1

--- Page 18 ---
Protein: In 24-hour urine, 1-14 mg/dl of protein may be excreted by the normal kidney.2
A color matching any color block greater than trace indicates significant proteinuria. For
urine with high specific gravity, the test area may most closely match the trace color
block even though only normal concentrations of protein are present. Clinical judgment is
needed to evaluate the significance of trace results.
Urobilinogen: In a healthy population, the normal urine urobilinogen range obtained
with this test is 0.2-1.0 Ehrlich Unit/dl. A result of 2.0 EU/dl may be of clinical
significance and the same patient sample should be evaluated further.
Nitrite: Normally no detectable amount of nitrite is present in urine.1 The nitrite area will
be positive in a proportion of cases of significant infection, depending on how long the
urine specimens were retained in the bladder prior to collection. Retrieval of positive
cases with the nitrite test range from as low as 40%, in instances where little bladder
incubation occurred, to as high as 80% in instances where a minimum of 4 hours
incubation occurred.
Leukocytes: Normal urine specimens generally yield negative results with this test. A
trace result may be of questionable clinical significance and it is recommended that the
test be repeated using a fresh sample from the same patient. Repeated trace and positive
results are of clinical significance.

Yes ___X_____ or No ________
The following sections are presented in the submission and they appear adequate based
on the level of concern and information provided in the Guidance for Content of
Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices, May 11, 2005.
Level of Concern – The sponsor has classified their device as a Moderate Level of
Concern.
3. Specimen Identification:
Bar-code scanner.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The TC-Thunderbolt Automated Urine Analyzer uses automatic sample-suction, strip
advance, and sample-application technologies.
5. Calibration:
The TC-Thunderbolt Automated Urine Analyzer System uses a plastic calibration strip to
perform a calibration reflectance check and test module alignment. The calibration strip
is included with the system. There are two different kinds of calibration. One is to
ensure the stability of the light source; it is performed every time the instrument is
switched on. The other is to align the test module and should be performed every 4 to 6
months.
6. Quality Control:
The labeling states:
For best results, performance of TC-Thunderbolt Urine Reagent Strips should be
confirmed by controls whenever a new bottle is first opened. Each laboratory should
establish its own goals for adequate standards of performance, and should question
handling and testing procedures if these standards are not met.
