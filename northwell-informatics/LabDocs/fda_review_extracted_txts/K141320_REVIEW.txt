H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The LZI Oral Fluid Cannabinoids Enzyme Immunoassay is intended for the qualitative
and semi-quantitative determination of cannabinoids in neat human oral fluid, collected
into the LZI Oral Fluid THC Collector, at the cut-off value of 4 ng/mL with D9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as calibrators. The assay is designed for prescription use
with a number of automated clinical chemistry analyzers.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of (1) enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as
GCMS and LCMS or (2) permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific alternative
chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas or
liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS or LC/MS) is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary test result
is positive.
The LZI Oral Fluid Cannabinoids Calibrators are for use as calibrators in the qualitative
and semi-quantitative calibration of the LZI Oral Fluid Cannabinoids Enzyme
Immunoassay at the cut-off value of 4 ng/mL.
The LZI Oral Fluid Cannabinoids Controls are for use as assayed quality control
materials to monitor the precision of the LZI Oral Fluid Cannabinoids Enzyme
Immunoassay at the cut-off value of 4 ng/mL.

L. Test Principle:
The LZI Oral Fluid Cannabinoids assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay with ready
to use liquid reagents. The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and
drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for a fixed
amount of antibody in the reagents. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody,
and the drug concentration in the sample is measured in terms of enzyme activity. In the
absence of drug in the sample, cannabinoid derivative-labeled G6PDH conjugate is bound to
antibody, and the enzyme activity is inhibited. On the other hand, when free drug is present
in the sample, antibody would bind to free drug, the unbound cannabinoid derivative-labeled

G6PDH then exhibits its maximal enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that can be
measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was performed and evaluated according to the CLSI Document EP5-A2.
Precision studies were conducted on the Beckman AU400e analyzer using samples
containing D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Samples were prepared by spiking a neat
human oral fluid pool collected into LZI Oral Fluid THC Collectors with D9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) for 8 target concentrations and a negative control.
Samples were tested in 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 20 days, total N=80.
The qualitative and semi-quantitative results confirmed by GC/MS. The results are

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Recovery studies were performed by serially diluting a spiked neat human oral fluid
pool containing D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Each sample from these studies was
run in 10 replicates on the Beckman AU400e analyzer. The results were averaged and
compared to the expected result and the percent recovery was calculated. The
linearity results are presented below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and value assignment and Stability
A stock solution of 1000 μg/mL D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) purchased from a
commercial source is spiked into the calibrator and controls to the desired
concentration. The concentration of the calibrator and controls are determined by
GC/MS. Purity determination and gravimetric preparation using balances calibrated
with NIST traceable weights ensure the accuracy of the stock standard solution. The
sponsor claims in-use stability (open-recapped) of 12 months at 2 to 8 °C for the
calibrator and controls and a closed vial stability (shelf life) of at least 6 months when
stored at 2 to 8 °C. Closed-vial real-time stability studies are ongoing. The study
protocols, summary of the results and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to
be adequate.
Shipping / Recovery Study
A shipping study was performed to demonstrate the recovery of drug from oral fluid
when collected in the LZI Oral Fluid Collector tube by testing expected transport
conditions. Conditions simulating transport to 3 different destinations with varied

weather conditions [(1) cold, 2 to 8 °C (2) ambient room temperature ~ 25 °C (3) 30
°C] were used. Three sets of pooled negative oral fluid samples (30 mL each) were
spiked with D9-tetrahydro-cannabinol (THC) to 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, and 300% of
the cutoff concentration to get six target concentrations of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 12 ng/mL,
respectively. These samples served as pre-shipping controls for analyte recovery (Day
1). The samples at each concentration were then pipetted (3.0 mL) into individual
amber glass vials and kept at three temperatures [(1) cold, 2 to 8 °C (2) ambient room
temperature ~ 25 °C (3) 30 °C] over 3 days (72 hours). After 72 hours, all samples
were brought to room temperature and tested with the LZI Oral Fluid Cannabinoid
Enzyme Immunoassay and by GC/MS. Percent recoveries (based on GCMS
measurements) under various shipping conditions are shown in the table below:

The sponsor’s labeling instructs users that samples that cannot be analyzed
immediately should be stored in amber glass vials and may be refrigerated at 2-8 ºC
for up to 22 days or frozen (-20 ºC) for up to 2 months. The labeling also states that
samples to be shipped should always be shipped cold (2-8 ºC), packed in gel ice and
shipped for next day delivery (within 24 hours), with a prominent note that failure to
do so may result in a significant decrease in recovery.
Sample Storage and Stability Study
Three sets of pooled negative oral fluid samples (30 mL each) collected with the LZI
Oral Fluid Cannabinoids collector were spiked in amber glass vials with D9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, and 300% of the cutoff
concentration to get six target concentrations of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 12 ng/mL,
respectively). Testing was performed on samples stored under various conditions
(room temperature, refrigerated and 30 ºC) on day 1, 4,8,11, 15, 22, and 29.
No degradation was seen at the cold (2 – 8o C) condition over 22 days. Percent
recoveries at room temperature (17-25 °C) and at 30o C vs. the cold condition at
various concentrations and time points were determined and percent recoveries
ranged from 98.5 to 101.3% at Day 22 for room temperature and from 96.7 to 101.4%
at Day 22 for 30o C. The manufacturer claims that D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
saliva samples are stable for up to 22 days when stored refrigerated at 2 to 8 °C and
for up to two months when stored frozen (at -20 °C ) in amber glass vials. The
stability claim at -20 °C was supported from the scientific literature.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
The effect of endogenous substances, exogenous substances and structurally unrelated
compounds was evaluated by adding these compounds (at the concentrations
specified below) to neat oral fluid (collected with the LZI Oral Fluid THC collectors)
at 2 ng/mL and 6 ng/mL (±50% of the assay cut-off). Drug-free oral fluid samples
were used as test controls. Data was collected on the Beckman AU400e analyzer and
is summarized below:
