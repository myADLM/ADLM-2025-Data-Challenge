platform is a fully automated closed system with continuous load and random access
capabilities that automatically processes the samples, runs the assay and reports the results.
It includes liquid handling hardware, luminometer and computer with software-user
interface. The QUANTA Flash Ro60 assay utilizes a reagent cartridge format, which is
compatible with the BIO-FLASH instrument.
Purified recombinant Ro60 antigen is coated onto paramagnetic beads. The bead suspension
is lyophilized and stored in the bead tube. Prior to use in the BIO-FLASH system, the sealed
reagent tubes are pierced with the reagent cartridge lid and the beads are rehydrated and
resuspended using resuspension buffer by pipetting up and down with a transfer pipette. The
reagent cartridge is then loaded onto the BIO-FLASH instrument. Samples are also loaded
onto the instrument in sample racks. A patient serum sample is prediluted by the BIO-
FLASH with system rinse in a small disposable plastic cuvette. Small amounts of the diluted
patient serum, the beads, and assay buffer are all combined into a second cuvette, and mixed.
This cuvette is then incubated at 37°C. The beads are magnetized and washed several times.
Isoluminol conjugated anti-human IgG antibodies are then added to the cuvette, and again
incubated at 37°C. The beads are magnetized and washed repeatedly. The isoluminol
conjugate is oxidized when Trigger 1 and Trigger 2 are added to the cuvette, and the flash of
light produced from this reaction is measured as Relative Light Units (RLU) by the BIO-
FLASH optical system. The RLU are proportional to the amount of isoluminol conjugate
that is bound to the human IgG, which is in turn proportional to the amount of anti- Ro60
antibodies bound to the corresponding Ro60 on the beads.
For quantitation, the QUANTA Flash Ro60 assay utilizes a predefined lot specific Master
Curve that is uploaded onto the instrument through the reagent cartridge barcode. Every new
lot number of reagent cartridge must be calibrated before first use, with the QUANTA Flash
Ro60 Calibrators. Based on the results obtained with the two Calibrators included in the
Calibrator Set (sold separately), an instrument specific Working Curve is created, which is
used to calculate chemiluminescent units (CU) from the instrument signal (RLU) obtained
for each sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision:
The precision of the QUANTA Flash Ro60 assay was evaluated according to CLSI
EP5-A2 guideline. Ten (10) samples obtained from a commercial vendor containing
various concentrations of Ro60 antibodies were run in duplicate, twice a day, for 21
days for a total of 84 measurements per sample. Two production reagent lots were
used in the study. Data were analyzed with the Analyse-it for Excel method
evaluation software, and within-run, between-run, between-day and total precision
were calculated and summarized in the Table below. No outliers were removed.

Lot to Lot:
A separate lot-to-lot comparison study was performed using 21samples from
INOVA’s serum bank covering the analytical measuring range of the assay and
positive and negative controls (23 specimens total). Samples were tested in triplicate
with three different reagent lots. All results were within the manufacturer’s pre-
defined acceptance criteria.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the analytical measuring range (4.9-1374.8 CU) was evaluated by a
study according to CLSI EP6-A. Three serum samples with various Ro60 antibody
concentrations were diluted in 10% increments (from 0% to 90% diluent) to obtain
values that cover the AMR. The dilutions were assayed in duplicate. Percent
recovery of obtained results was calculated compared to the expected results (based
on the dilution factor). Obtained values were plotted against expected values, and
linear regression analysis was performed using Analyse-it software. The slope and
intercept of the regression line were calculated with 95% CI as well as the R2 values.
All samples met the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

An additional linearity study was performed comparing the results of the assay when
diluted with either serum or system rinse over a series of concentrations covering the
AMR. The results of the study demonstrated that similar results were obtained from
dilution of Ro60 in serum or system rinse.
The AMR is defined by the values of the lowest and highest Master Curve Standards.
The QUANTA Flash Ro60 AMR is 4.9 CU to 1374.8 CU.

Auto-dilution:
The BIO-FLASH software has an Auto-rerun option available. If this option is
selected, the instrument will automatically rerun any sample that has a result of
>1374.8 by further diluting it by 20 fold, thereby bringing the measured value within
the AMR. The final result will be calculated by the software by taking into account
the additional dilution factor. As the highest value that can be measured is 1374.8
CU, the highest value that can be reported is 27496 CU.
To validate the Auto-rerun function, four high positive specimens with results above
the analytical measuring range were selected. The samples were run with the Auto-
rerun function enabled on the BIO-FLASH. All samples triggered the auto-rerun
function. Then the specimens were manually diluted to the same level as the Auto-
rerun function (20 fold) and tested on the BIO-FLASH. The results were within the
analytical measuring range after auto-rerun or manual dilution for all specimens. The
% recovery values for results obtained with the auto-rerun compared to the results
obtained by manual dilution were between 87% and 101% (average 93%) (within the
manufacturer’s pre-determined ± 20% acceptance limit).
Hook effect:
To assess hook effect, the measurement signal (relative light units, RLU) was
examined for four high positive samples (all results above the AMR) before and after
automatic or manual dilution. All sera produced significantly higher RLU values
(above the AMR) when used neat. Results were compared to the manually and
automatically diluted samples (that were within the AMR), to demonstrate that high
positive specimens above the analytical measuring range do not show hook effect up
to 19,707 CU in the Ro60 assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
There are currently no recognized international standards for the measurement of
anti-Ro60 antibodies. The QUANTA Flash Ro60 Calibrators and Controls are
manufactured by diluting human serum that contains high titer of anti-Ro60
antibodies with commercial antibody stabilizer, containing preservative. The human
serum is obtained from commercial sources and it is tested for markers of infectious
substances.
The target CU is achieved through trial dilutions on small scale. Once a dilution is
selected, the Calibrators and Control are bulked, tested, and adjusted. Upon
completion of the manufacturing process, the Calibrators and Controls are tested on at
least two instruments, on at least two lots of reagent cartridge, in replicates of 10 to
determine final value assignment.

For the Ro60 assay, detection limits were determined according to CLSI EP17-A.
Limit of Blank (LoB):
LoB was determined using the assay specific sample dilution buffer (System Rinse)
as “blank”. Four (4) blank samples from two different lots were run in replicates of
five, one time per day for three days for a total of 60 measurements per lot. LoB was
calculated for each lot separately using the Reference Interval function of Analyse-it
software at the 95th percentile, using the non-parametric method.
The resulting analysis provided a p-value indicating non-normal (p < 0.0001)
distribution of the data points. The resulting LoBs for the two lots were 398 RLU and
452 RLU. The final LoB was determined to be 452 RL.
Limit of Detection (LoD):
To determine LoD, four low level samples were prepared by diluting anti-Ro60
positive samples. The low level samples were run in replicates of five on two reagent
lots, one time per day for three days resulting in 60 measurements per lot. LoD was
calculated based on formula that is published in the CLSI Guideline EP17-A: LoD =
LoB + (cβ*SDS). The LoD was determined separately for each lot and was 519 RLU
and 502 RLU. The final LoD for the QUANTA Flash Ro60 assay is 519 RLU, which
is below the analytical measuring range of the assay e.g. < 4.9 CU.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
The interference study was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2. Three specimens
were tested (near-the cut-off negative: 15.2 CU; weak positive: 40.3 CU; high
positive: 161.4 CU).
Each interfering substance was tested at three concentrations (low, medium, and high)
in three different specimens (15.2, 40.3, and 161.4 CU). The resulting samples were
assessed in triplicate with the Ro60 assay. Recovery of the unit values was calculated
compared to control samples spiked with the same volume of diluent (10% of total).
No interference (≤ ±15%) was detected up to the following concentrations tested:
Substance Concentration % recoveries
Triglyceride 1000 mg/dL 89% to 109%
Cholesterol 224.3 mg/dL 89% to 109%
Bilirubin 10 mg/dL 99% to 109%
Hemoglobin 200 mg/dL 100% to 108%
Rheumatoid Factor 500 IU/mL 90% to 107%

Cross reactivity:
Cross reactivity was investigated using international reference sera from the Center of
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All 12 sera were tested. The CDC ANA
reference sera #2 (reference serum for human antibodies to SS-B/La), #3 (reference
serum, fluorescence antinuclear antibody, speckled pattern) and #7 (reference serum
for human antibodies to SS-A/Ro) were positive for Ro60 by this assay and produced
the following results: CDC ANA #2: >1374.8 CU; CDC ANA #3: 920.0 CU and
CDC ANA #7 >1374.8 CU. The other 9 reference sera in the panel were analyzed
and found to be negative for Ro60 by this assay.
f. Assay cut-off:
The QUANTA Flash Ro60 cut-off was established using unaltered samples in the
same matrix (serum) from 156 subjects indicated in the table below:
Diagnosis #
Apparently healthy blood donors 115
Viral hepatitis positive samples 8
Syphilis positive samples 5
Rheumatoid arthritis 23
HIV positive samples 5
The cut-off was established in accordance to CLSI C28-A3c. The distribution of the
results was non-normal (Shapiro-Wilk p<0.0001), so the non-parametric percentile
method was used. The 99th percentile of the obtained values calculated as 8193.6
RLU.
Additionally, 12 proficiency testing samples from the College of American
Pathologists (CAP) and United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment
Service (UKNEQAS) with known consensus/target results were tested to aid in the
determination of the cut-off. Taking into account the target results of the proficiency
testing samples, the cut-off was increased to 12,000 RLU to ensure optimal
differentiation between negatives and positives, and a 20 CU value was assigned to
this RLU value. No reference sample (156 serum and 12 proficiency) tested positive
at this cut-off level.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The QUANTA Flash Ro60 assay was compared with the predicate using available
samples from the clinical validation set presented below. Because many were outside
the measuring range of the assay, only results within the analytical measuring range
of the assay are presented. The 143 sample cohort consisted of SLE (n=27),
Sjogren’s Syndrome (SS; n=19), and relevant disease controls (n=97).
The predicate has an equivocal region, so the data were analyzed with the equivocal
results as either positive or negative. Of the 143 available samples, 63 were within
the AMR. These samples contained 25 SLE, 18 SS, and 20 disease controls.

b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. is not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
See assay cut-off.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected value in the normal population is “negative”. Anti-Ro60 autoantibody
levels were analyzed in a cohort of 98 apparently healthy blood donors (52 females and
46 males, ages 17 to 60 years, with an average age of 33.2 years and median age of 29
years) using the QUANTA Flash Ro60. This patient population was different from the
one that was used to establish the cut-off, and was only used to assess expected values.
At the cut-off of 20 CU, 2 (2 %) of the samples were positive on the QUANTA Flash
Ro60. The mean concentration was 6 CU, and the values ranged from <4.9 to 84.8 CU.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
