I. Device Description:
The Liat™ Strep A Assay, performed on the Liat™ Analyzer, is a rapid, automated in vitro
diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A b-hemolytic
Streptococcus, Strep A) DNA in throat swab specimens in Amies medium.
The Liat™ Strep A Assay targets a conserved region of the S. pyogenes genome. An Internal
Process Control (IPC) is also included to monitor the adequacy of process steps involved in
nucleic acid extraction and amplification/detection, as well as for the presence of inhibitors.
In order for a sample to be called negative for S. pyogenes, the IPC must be detected. If the
IPC is not detected, the result is reported as invalid and the operator is instructed to repeat the
test. The time-to-result is approximately 15 minutes.
The assay employs a single-use disposable Liat™ Tube that holds the sample preparation and
PCR reagents, and in which the nucleic acid extraction and amplification/detection processes
take place. The reagents are housed in unit dose pre-packed tube segments separated by
frangible seals that are ruptured sequentially by actuators within the Liat™ Analyzer to effect

sample processing, including bacterial cell lysis, DNA recovery and removal of inhibitors,
PCR amplification and detection.
To perform the Liat™ Strep A Assay the operator transfers an aliquot of a throat swab
sample in Amies medium into a Liat™ Strep A Assay tube, scans the relevant tube and
sample identification barcodes and then inserts the tube into the Liat™ Analyzer for
automated processing and result interpretation. An embedded microprocessor coordinates the
functions of the Liat™ Analyzer to move the sample from one segment of the tube to
another, and to control the reaction volume, temperature and duration of each step.
Positive and Negative External Controls are provided separately from the assay reagents in
the Liat™ Strep A Assay Quality Control Kit. The Positive Control comprises dried,
inactivated S. pyogenes bacteria that are rehydrated by the operator with Amies medium. The
Negative Control comprises Amies medium alone.

L. Test Principle:
To perform the Liat™ Strep A Assay a throat swab sample in Amies medium is first added to the
Liat™ Tube using a transfer pipette. The tube is then loaded into the Liat™ Analyzer for
automated processing, the first step of which is mixing of the sample with the Internal Process
Control (IPC). Lysis of both the IPC and the S. pyogenes target organism, if present, are then
induced by chaotropic and proteolytic reagents and the nucleic acids are recovered by binding to
the surface of silica-coated magnetic beads. The beads and bound nucleic acid are captured using
a magnetic field and the lysate is removed, after which a wash step is conducted to remove
potential inhibitors and the captured nucleic acids are eluted under low-salt conditions into a
small volume of buffer.
Target amplification and detection are performed using TaqMan (hydrolysis) probe-based real-
time PCR. Primers and probes for both the S. pyogenes-specific target and the IPC are included
in the reaction mixture. The fluorescence intensity for each optical channel is monitored and
results are interpreted by an automated algorithm based on a combination of cycle threshold (Ct)
and endpoint fluorescence values.
The sample preparation and real-time PCR amplification processes are conducted within the
Liat™ Analyzer in approximately 15 minutes.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the Liat™ Strep A Assay was evaluated at 3 sites. Two
operators at each site tested a 4 member panel in triplicate on 5 different days, for a
total of 360 assay runs (4 panel members X 3 replicates X 2 operators X 5 days X 3
sites). Nine Liat™ Analyzers and 3 Liat™ Strep A Assay tube lots were included in
the study. Each reproducibility panel comprised a negative, a high negative, a low
positive and a medium positive sample prepared in throat swab matrix (Table 1).

The percent agreement with expected results for each panel member from each site is
shown in Table 2 for the S. pyogenes target and in Table 3 for the Internal Process
Control (IPC). The mean and coefficient of variation (%CV) for the Ct and endpoint
fluorescence values are also provided for all samples with valid Ct scores (i.e., this
analysis was not performed for the S. pyogenes target in Negative or High Negative
samples).
All (90/90; 100%) Moderate Positive and 89/90 (98.9%) Low Positive samples
produced positive assay results. All (90/90; 100%) Negative and High Negative
samples produced negative assay results. Overall there was 99.7% (359/360)
agreement with expected results.
At the Low Positive target level, the %CV for the S. pyogenes Ct and endpoint
fluorescence values ranged from 2.5 to 3.6% and from 29.2 to 43.8%, respectively
depending on the site. For the IPC in S. pyogenes negative samples, the %CV for Ct
ranged from 1.7 to 1.9% and for endpoint fluorescence between 12.2 and 13.3%.
Overall, the PCR Ct and endpoint fluorescence values for both the S. pyogenes target
and IPC demonstrated acceptable precision.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls
The Liat™ Strep A Assay incorporates 3 controls:
(1) Internal Process Control (IPC);
(2) External Positive Control;
(3) External Negative Control.
Internal Process Control
The IPC is designed to avoid reporting of false negative results due to excessive
sample inhibition or system operation outside the normal range. The IPC is comprised
of an inactivated bacterium that is pre-packaged in each Liat™ Tube. When
conducting an assay, the sample is first mixed with the IPC which then goes through
all the test process steps to monitor both the sample processing and PCR
performance. The IPC DNA is detected in a separate optical channel from the S.
pyogenes target nucleic acid. If the IPC Ct and fluorescence endpoint values do not
fall within specified limits and S. pyogenes target DNA is not detected, the test is
reported as invalid and the operator is instructed to repeat the test.
External Positive and Negative Controls
Positive and Negative Controls are provided separately from the assay reagents in the
Liat™ Strep A Assay Quality Control Kit and must be tested each time a new lot of
reagents is used. Should either the Positive or Negative Control fail to produce the
expected result during the “Add Lot” process the system software precludes use of
the Liat™ tube lot until the cause of the failure is resolved.
The Positive Control and consists of dried, inactivated S. pyogenes bacteria. The
target level for the Positive Control is designed to be close to the LOD of the assay.
The Negative Control consists of Amies medium without S. pyogenes target
organisms and is provided in unit dose quantity.
Evaluation of Control Performance
The ability of the Liat™ Strep A IPC and Positive Control to monitor the
performance of the assay was verified under various simulated failure modes (Table
3). All of the replicates tested under each simulated failure mode were reported as
invalid thereby demonstrating that the IPC and Positive Control are effective in
monitoring substantial failures in reagent and process integrity.

The ability to monitor for contamination was evaluated by spiking Negative Controls
with low levels of S. pyogenes DNA. In each case the system software indicated that
the control failed.
During the Clinical Study to validate the performance of the Liat™ Strep A Assay, 15
Positive and 15 Negative Controls were tested across 6 lots of Liat™ Tubes and 11
Liat™ Analyzers. All (100%) of the controls produced the expected results as did
20/20 (100%) Negative Controls and 22/22 (100%) Positive Controls or known
positive samples that were used to monitor assay performance during the course of
the in-house analytical studies.
Sample Stability
Sample stability was evaluated by testing S. pyogenes positive and negative throat
swabs after storage at 2-8°C, 25°C or -20°C. S. pyogenes positive samples were
spiked with organisms at 3X LOD. At each test point, all of the samples produced the
expected result, supporting the Package Insert claims for sample stability (48 hours at
2-25°C).
d. Analytical Sensitivity (Detection limit):
The Limit of Detection (LOD) of the Liat™ Strep A Assay was determined by
limiting dilution studies using titered stocks of 4 strains of S. pyogenes that were
spiked into throat swab matrix. The LOD was determined as the lowest concentration
that was detected ≥95% of the time (i.e., ≥19/20 replicates tested positive) and ranged
from 5-20 CFU/mL (Table 4).

BLAST analysis also showed the target region for the Liat™ Strep A Assay to be
conserved across different strains of S. pyogenes.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-Reactivity Study
The analytical specificity of the Liat™ Strep A Assay was evaluated by testing a
panel of 72 potentially cross-reactive organisms and viruses (Table 6). Except where
noted, bacteria and yeast were tested at 1.1-4.4 x 106 Colony Forming Units/mL and
viruses were tested at 1.00-4.45 x 105 TCID /mL. Each virus or species of organism

was tested in triplicate in S. pyogenes negative throat swab matrix. In each case, all
three assay replicates produced negative results indicating no evidence of cross-

BLAST analysis of the Liat™ Strep A primer, probe and amplicon sequences also
showed no homology with other organisms or viruses that is likely to impact assay
performance.

Cross-Contamination Study
In order to evaluate the risk of false-positive results due to contamination between
samples (run-to-run) and between analyzers (instrument-to-instrument), 20 high
positive (3.13 x 106 CFU/mL) and 20 S. pyogenes negative samples were tested on
each of two Liat™ Analyzers (i.e., 40 high positive and 40 negative samples in total).
All 40 high positive and all 40 negative samples produced the expected results,
indicating that the risk of contamination between runs and instruments is acceptably
low.
f. Assay cut-off:
The Liat™ Strep A Assay result algorithm analyses the characteristics of the
fluorescence amplification curves for the S. pyogenes target and Internal Process
Control (IPC) to disposition samples as “Strep A Detected,” “Strep A Not Detected,”
“Indeterminate” or “Invalid.”
The algorithm employs cut-offs for both the cycle threshold (Ct) value and endpoint
amplitude in addition to other parameters. The cut-offs were determined through
analysis of a combination of negative clinical samples and samples that were spiked
with different strains at the LOD target level.
In order for a sample to be called negative for S. pyogenes (“Strep A Not Detected”),
the IPC must be detected. If the IPC is not detected, the result is reported as “Assay
Invalid. Repeat Assay.” In cases in which S. pyogenes is detected but the curve shape
is abnormal, the result is reported as “Indeterminate.”
As indicated in the Package Insert, if the test result is “Indeterminate” or “Invalid”,
the assay should be repeated with the same patient specimen or, if possible, a new
specimen from the same patient. Specimens that have repeat “Indeterminate” or
“Invalid” results should be sent for confirmatory testing by another method.

g. Assay Interference:
Interfering Substances
The Liat™ Strep A was evaluated with 28 substances that may be encountered in
throat swabs (Table 7). Testing was performed in triplicate with medically and/or
physiologically relevant concentrations of each potential interfering substance in
throat swab matrix and in the presence and absence of S. pyogenes ATCC 700294 at
60 CFU/mL (i.e., 3X LOD). In all cases the expected results were obtained, although
with bovine mucin at the concentration tested all three assay replicates exhibited
delayed Ct values and lower endpoint fluorescence for the S. pyogenes target. This is
reflected in the Package Insert in a footnote to the list of potential interfering
substances that were evaluated.

Interfering Microorganisms
The organisms and viruses listed in Table 6, above, were evaluated for the potential
to interfere with the Liat™ Strep A Assay by testing them at the concentrations
shown in the table in the presence of a low level of S. pyogenes ATCC 700294 (i.e.,
60 CFU/mL = 3X LOD). Each organism or virus was tested in triplicate. All assay
replicates produced positive results and there was therefore no evidence of microbial
interference with the Liat™ Strep A Assay.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The performance of the Liat™ Strep A Assay was evaluated in a study that was
conducted at six clinical sites in the U.S. between December 2013 and April 2014.
Specimens were collected from subjects who were 3 years of age or older and who
presented with symptoms that are characteristic of pharyngitis (i.e., sore throat plus at
least one of the following: pharyngeal redness, pharyngeal or tonsillar exudate, tonsillar
swelling, tender cervical lymphadenopathy or fever). Two or three throat swabs were
collected from each subject. One swab for use with the Liat™ Strep A Assay was placed
in 1mL Amies transport medium. The additional swabs were used for standard of care
diagnosis. The order of swab collected was at the discretion of the clinical sites.
The swabs in Amies medium were tested with the Liat™ Strep A Assay at the clinical
sites on the day of collection. Residual specimen was then shipped to a central laboratory
for reference culture where an aliquot of the transport medium was plated on Trypticase
Soy Agar with 5% Sheep Blood and incubated at 35-37°C in an atmosphere of 5-7%
CO . Isolated colonies that exhibited b-hemolysis were typed by latex agglutination
2
(Remel Strepex®). Culture plates that did not exhibit b-hemolytic colonies after 48 hours
were recorded as negative.
Specimens that produced discordant results between the reference culture and the Liat™
Strep A Assay were subject to additional characterization by an alternative PCR method,
followed by bi-directional sequencing.
Throat swabs were collected from a total of 799 subjects during the course of the study.
Two hundred and twenty-nine (229) specimens were excluded from the analysis of
13

--- Page 14 ---
performance due to failure to comply with inclusion criteria (2), delayed reference culture
(16), absence of a Liat™ Strep A result (1), use of the incorrect swab type (130),
incorrect Liat™ Strep assay procedure (20) or protocol deviation (60). A total of 570
specimens was therefore included in the analysis of performance (Table 8).

Of the 570 unique specimens included in the analysis, 7 initially produced invalid Liat™
Strep A test results (invalid rate = 7/577 = 1.2%). All 7 produced valid results on retest
and those results are included in the analysis of performance.
