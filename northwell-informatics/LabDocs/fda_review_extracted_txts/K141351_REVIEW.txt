L. Test Principle:
The test principle for the SuperCheck Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System (Model 5228-
S) and SuperCheck Plus Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System (Model 5228-M)) is an
amperometric method that uses flavin adenine dinucleotide-glucose dehydrogenase (GDH-
FAD) enzyme chemistry. The reaction utilizes the oxidation of glucose by the dehydrogenase
enzyme and then yields electrons, which can be used to generate an electric signal that is
measured by the meter, and after calculation by the meter, the blood glucose concentration
reading is displayed, calibrated to plasma reference. The strength of the current produced by
the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the blood sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All performance characteristics were conducted on the SuperCheck Plus BGMS. Testing
performed on the SuperCheck Plus BGMS to characterize the performance of the
SuperCheck Plus Multi BGMS is adequate since both the SuperCheck Plus and SuperCheck
Plus Multi BGMS are identical with the exception of the names and intended use (i.e. single
vs. multiple patient use).
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability was performed using 5 venous blood samples drawn in heparin tubes
and adjusted to five targeted glucose concentrations by addition of glucose in saline
or by glycolysis. Each sample was tested 10 times on three test strips lots, using 30
meters (10 meters per test strip lot). Results are summarized below:

performed with 3 lots of test strips and 10 meters. Measurements of the same
samples by YSI glucose analyzer were used as a reference. Linear regression
analysis for each test strip lot compared to the YSI resulted in:
Strip lot Linear Regression R2
Lot. #1 y=0.9931x+1.5695 0.9994
Lot. #2 y=0.9950x+1.3617 0.9997
Lot. #3 y=0.9901x+1.6620 0.9997
Combined y=0.9930x+1.5106 0.9998
The study results support the claimed measuring range of 20-600 mg/dL of the
SuperCheck Plus (5228-S) and SuperCheck Plus Multi (5228-M) Blood Glucose
Monitoring Systems.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The SuperCheck Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to the NIST
SRM917A reference material. The reference instrument used is the YSI Model 2300
Glucose Analyzer.
Test Strip Stability
Closed-vial (shelf life) stability and opened-vial (in-use) stability studies were
performed to evaluate the stability of test strips. Closed-vial studies were conducted
for 5 months shelf-life for the real-time test and are ongoing. Opened-vial was
performed for 90 days. Closed-vial and opened-vial stability studies were carried
out at 2°C - 30°C and relative humidity of 20% to 80%.
The results presented that the test strips are stable when stored at the recommended
conditions for 90 days after first opening and have a 5 month shelf life.
Value Assignment:
The control materials are assigned a YSI2300 calibrated to a solution traceable to
NIST SRM 917. The control solutions are evaluated by multiple replicates on the
YSI2300. Then, five vials per lot of the controls are evaluated on 15 SuperCheck
Plus meters. An average of the measurements is used to assign the value of the
controls. The protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
adequate.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20 to 600 mg/dL based on linearity studies (see section
M.1.b).

e. Analytical specificity:
To assess potential interference venous whole blood samples were adjusted to two
glucose concentration intervals of 50 to 100 mg/dL and 250-350 mg/dL (as measured
on the YSI 2300 Analyzer). Each of these samples was divided into a test pool and a
control pool and each of the potential endogenous and exogenous interfering
substances was added to the test pool. Each substance was tested at a minimum of
two concentrations, normal/therapeutic and high/toxic concentrations. The %
difference between the test sample and the control sample was calculated. Results are
presented in the table below:

Certain substances occurring in the body naturally, such as uric acid, or from normal
therapeutic treatments (Ascorbic acid, L-Dopa, Tolazamide and Gentisic acid) will
not significantly affect results. However, higher concentrations in blood may cause
incorrect results.
There is no significant interference in the presence of galactose, maltose or fructose
observed in blood glucose test.
Do not test blood glucose during or soon after xylose absorption test. Xylose in the
blood can give falsely elevated results.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
System accuracy:
To assess system accuracy, fingertip samples and forearm samples were collected
from 151 subjects and compared to a reference method, YSI 2300. Trained
healthcare professionals at each site performed testing on blood obtained from the
finger and forearm from each participant. In order to obtain samples at the lowest and
highest glucose concentrations, nine fresh capillary blood samples from individual
participants were altered to achieve the desired distribution, 4 at the low range (< 50
mg/dL) and 3 at the high range (> 400 mg/dL). Six meters and 3 lots of test strips
were used in the study.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study - The sponsor performed hematocrit studies using eight different
hematocrit (Hct) levels (20, 25, 30, 35, 42, 50, 55, 60%) across the glucose measuring
range (20-600 mg/dL). At each hematocrit level, 3 samples at glucose concentrations
of approximately 45, 125, and, 355 mg/dL were tested against the YSI method. 3 lots
of test strips were tested on 12 meters and the values were compared to the YSI
method and the nominal hematocrit level (42%). The results demonstrated that the
device produces accurate results over the claimed hematocrit range of 20% to 60%.
2. Altitude Study - A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude on the
SuperCheck Plus BGMS. 3 lots of test strips were tested on 10 meters using blood
from venous blood samples obtained from three donors spiked to three glucose
concentrations (47 mg/dL, 135 mg/dL, 371 mg/dL). Samples were tested at ground
level and at 10,744 feet above sea level. Each venous blood sample was also tested
by the YSI 2300 analyzer. The meter readings obtained were compared to the YSI
method and the percent bias against the YSI results. The results support the sponsor’s
claim that the SuperCheck Plus BGMS can be used at altitude up to 10,744 feet.
3. Sample volume study: A minimum sample volume study was performed to verify the
minimum test strip sample volume requirement and the test strip fill error function
established for the SuperCheck Plus BGMS. Three lots of test strips on 30 meters
were tested using blood from six donors. Blood at each concentration was applied to
strips at five target sample volumes of 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 μL.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be acceptable. The
study results supported the Sponsor’s claim that a minimum sample volume of ≥ 0.7
µL produced accurate results and all samples <0.7 µL give an error code and do not
provide results to the user.
4. Temperature and humidity studies: Temperature and humidity operating conditions
were evaluated for temperatures ranging from 10oC to 40oC (50°F – 104°F) and
relative humidity from 20% to 80%. Three lots of test strips on 30 meters were
tested using three whole blood samples at three glucose concentration levels. The
18

--- Page 19 ---
results supported the Sponsor’s claimed operating conditions from 10oC to 40oC
(50oF to 104oF) and 20-80% RH.
5. Infection control studies: The device is intended for single-patient use and multiple-
patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the external meter
materials demonstrating removal of the HBsAg antigen with the chosen disinfectant,
Clorox Bleach Germicidal Wipes (EPA Registration #67619-12). Robustness studies
were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change
in performance or in the external materials of the meter and lancing device after
11,000 cleaning cycles and 11,000 disinfection cycles designed to simulate 3 years of
device use. Labeling
6. EMC Testing: EMC testing was evaluated and certified by Precision Machinery
Research and Development Center; test reports were submitted certifying that
acceptable electromagnetic testing (EMC) had been performed.
7. Readability Assessment: Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and
the results showed that the labeling (Owner’s Guide, test strip package insert and
control solution package insert) were written at the 8th grade level.
8. Customer support: Customer service is available 9AM – 5PM EST Monday through
Friday. Toll free phone number is 1-888-887-4772 for customer support.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
