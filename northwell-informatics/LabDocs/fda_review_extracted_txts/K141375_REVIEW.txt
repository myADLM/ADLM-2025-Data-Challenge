L. Test Principle:
The EliA™ M2 Wells are coated with native pyruvate dehydrogenase complex from
mitochondria and recombinant M2-antigen. If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies to
M2 bind to their specific antigen. After washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled
antibodies against human IgG antibodies (EliA IgG Conjugate) are added to form an
antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the

bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution. After stopping the reaction, the
fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The higher the value of fluorescent signal
detected by the instrument, the higher the amount of antibody bound and detected in the
sample tested. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is compared directly
to the response for calibrators.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
At least 8 serum samples selected from different parts of the claimed assay range were
tested on Phadia® 100 and Phadia® 250 instruments to establish intra- and inter-assay
precision. Each sample was tested in 7 runs over 7 days in 4 replicates per run on 3
instruments. One batch was used to determine the precision of the assays on Phadia®
100 (equal to 84 replicate determinations per sample). Three batches were used to
determine the precision of the assays on Phadia® 250 (equal to 252 replicate
determinations per sample). Results summarized below met the manufacturer’s pre-
determined percent coefficient of variation (%CV) specifications for intra-assay
(<10.6% for Phadia® 100 and <10.1% for Phadia® 250), inter-assay (<11.5% for
Phadia® 100 and <11.0% for Phadia® 250) and total (<16% for Phadia® 100 and
Phadia® 250) imprecision.

The technical measuring range (detection limit, upper limit) for EliA™ M2 is from 0.5
to ≥ 220 U/mL. The upper limit of the reported results in EliA U/ml can vary due to a
lot-specific conversion from μg/L to EliA U/mL. Results above the upper limit are
reported as “above”. Linearity was shown for the range between 0.5 – 276 U/mL. The
labeling states that due to differing binding characteristics of the antibodies in patient
samples, not all sera can be diluted linearly within the technical measuring range.
High dose hook effect: A hook effect was not observed when analyzing a high positive serum
sample with an estimated concentration more than 7 times above the upper limit of the technical
measuring range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i) Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability – The IgG calibrators are traceable (via unbroken chain of calibrations) to
the International Reference Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of Human Serum Immunoglobulins
A, G and M from the World Health Organization (WHO). New batches of IgG
calibrators are compared to a secondary standard (standardized with the IRP) or the IRP
directly and adjusted accordingly to meet the correct concentration.
There is no international standard for IgG antibodies directed to M2. EliA M2 is
calibrated against the non-WHO Reference Material Primary Biliary Cirrhosis Serum,
Human NIBSC code 67/183. The instrument measures specific IgG concentration in μg/L
which is automatically converted to U/mL by using a conversion factor given by the lot-
specific bar code printed on the EliA™ M2 Well package and read by the instrument
during reagent loading.
Calibrators – The calibrators are human serum in standard buffer. There are 6 levels with
assigned values from 0-600 µg/mL. The calibrator curve is acquired by fitting the values
of the 6 calibrators and can be stored for up to 28 days by the instrument to be used on
additional assays. Each additional assay includes calibrator (curve) controls that have to
recover in defined ranges to ensure that the stored calibration curve is still valid.
Controls – The EliA™ M2 Positive is prepared from selected pooled human sera and
contains IgG antibodies to M2. The EliA™ IgG/IgM/IgA Negative Control was cleared
under k091845. EliA™ IgG/IgM/IgA Negative Control is prepared from selected pooled
sera from normal, healthy donors. The controls are pre-diluted and ready for use. Each
EliA™ Control package contains a Control Certificate listing predefined acceptance
criteria for the EliA™ products the Controls can be used with. The target ranges of the

EliA™ Controls tested with the EliA™ M2 on the two Phadia® instruments are
summarized below:
Instrument EliA™ M2 Positive Control

Phadia® 250 22.7 – 52.9 U/mL
Instrument EliA™ IgG/IgM/IgA Negative Control
Phadia® 100 < 6 U/mL
Phadia® 250 < 6 U/mL
ii) Kit Stability:
Shelf-life stability – An accelerated stability study set the shelf-life stability of the EliA™
M2 Wells (from the date of manufacture when stored at recommended temperature 2-
8°C) at 18 months. A real-time stability study is underway and currently available data
supports a 7-month stability claim. All studies were performed on three lots of EliA M2
Wells. The sponsor notes that it is important to store the wells in dry conditions at 2-8°C.
An accelerated stability study set the shelf-life stability of the EliA™ M2 Positive
Control at 15 months. A real-time stability study is underway and currently available data
supported a 14-month stability claim. The shelf life is identical for the Controls for
Phadia® 100 and Phadia® 250 as they contain the identical bulk material and are
packaged in the same vials but just are labeled differently.
Other required components (previously reviewed) of the test method have a shelf life of
18 to 24 months.
Open stability – Stability of the foil bag containing the EliA™ M2 wells after first
opening was tested and determined to be 9 months at 2-8°C.
EliA™ M2 Positive Control 100 and EliA™ M2 Positive Control 250 are for single use
only. Therefore, stability after first opening study is not required.
The stability after first opening study for EliA™ IgG Calibrators and EliA™ IgG Curve
Control are not required as they are for single use only.
On-board stability– The on-board stability of the EliA™ M2 Wells packed in carrier
storage tray without desiccant bag was tested only on the Phadia® 250 instrument since
on the Phadia 100 instrument the reagents are stored outside the instrument and are only
loaded as needed for an assay. The EliA™ M2 Wells can be stored open at 2-8ºC for up
to 28 days or at room temperature for 24 hours (1 day).
iii) Sample Storage:
The package insert recommends following the guidelines in CLSI H18-A3 for sample
storage. Separated serum/plasma should remain at room temperature for no longer than
8

[Table 1 on page 8]
	Instrument			EliA™ M2 Positive Control	
Phadia® 100			24.7 – 57.7 U/mL		
Phadia® 250			22.7 – 52.9 U/mL		
	Instrument			EliA™ IgG/IgM/IgA Negative Control	
Phadia® 100			< 6 U/mL		
Phadia® 250			< 6 U/mL		

--- Page 9 ---
eight hours. If assays will not be completed within eight hours, serum/plasma should be
refrigerated (2 - 8°C). If assays are not completed within 48 hours, or the separated
serum/plasma will be stored beyond 48 hours, serum/plasma should be frozen at or below
-20°C. Freezing and thawing should be avoided.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined in accordance with
CLSI EP17-A. On each Phadia instrument (Phadia® 100 and Phadia® 250), a
immunoglobulin depleted serum (for LoB) and five low antibody samples (for LoD) were
assayed in 12 replicates in each of 6 runs on 6 different days, three runs in two instruments,
for a total of 432 replicates per sample. The runs were spread over three Phadia® 100 and
four Phadia® 250 instruments. The values determined are presented in the table below:
EliA™ M2 LoB LoD
Phadia® 100 0.13 U/mL 0.45 U/mL
Phadia® 250 0.13 U/mL 0.37 U/mL
The package insert states the Detection Limit as 0.5 U/mL for all instruments.
e. Analytical specificity:
i) Endogenous Interference:
Interferences were assessed by testing four samples (one negative, two with concentration
levels around the cut-off, and a positive sample with concentration level around calibrator
5). Each sample was spiked with the interfering substances or substance-specific blanks,
and analyzed in 2 runs, each in 3 replicates (n=6), on one lot of EliA™ M2 Well and one
lot of system reagents. The data demonstrated that EliA™ M2 was not adversely affected
(percent recoveries ranged from 82 to 100%) by high levels of the following substances
up to the concentrations listed in the table below:
Potential Interfering Compound Test Concentration
Bilirubin F 19.2 mg/dL
Bilirubin C 20.1 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 496 mg/dL
Lipemic factor (ClinOleic) 1%
Rheumatoid factor IgM 500 IU/mL
The package insert contains a caution not to use hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric samples.
ii) Cross-reactivity:
A panel of 20 reference NEQAS serum samples which have target specifications for
mitochondrial antibodies but were without a clinical diagnosis was tested using one batch
of EliA™ M2 Wells and one batch of system reagents. The EliA™ M2 test results
matched the targets of the respective assessment scheme.

iii) Carry-over:
A study was carried out on 1 Phadia® 250 instrument using the test EliATM Ro cleared
under k082759. The sample set consisted of a high serum sample (High), a high serum
sample diluted 1:2 (1:2 dilution) and 1:20 (1:20 dilution) by instrument dilution and
manual dilution, and a sample containing EliA sample diluent only (Diluent). They
were assayed in replicates of 5 in the following order: Diluent, High, 1:2 dilution
(instrument), Diluent, 1:20 dilution (instrument), Diluent, 1:2 dilution (manual). The data
demonstrate no carryover effect as the results of the Diluent sample results were not affected
by the results of the previous sample.
f. Assay cut-off:
Based on the results of the expected values/reference range study described below in Section
M.5, the 99th percentile lies below the upper limit of the equivocal range for EliA™ M2. The
assay cutoffs were set as follows:
Decision point Interpretation
<4 U/mL Negative
4 - 6 U/mL Equivocal
>6 U/mL Positive
In case of equivocal results, the manufacturer recommends retesting the patient after 8-12 weeks.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 416 serum samples were assayed in singleton on both EliA™ M2 using Phadia®
250 instrument and QuantaLiteTM M2 EP (MIT3) ELISA. The samples were from the
intended use population (refer to the table in section 3 Clinical studies). In addition, 30
artificial samples with antibody concentrations in the intermediate and upper assay ranges
(140.6 U/mL to 255.2 U/mL) were created by mixing high positive sera with negative blood
donor sera.
The results are summarized below:
