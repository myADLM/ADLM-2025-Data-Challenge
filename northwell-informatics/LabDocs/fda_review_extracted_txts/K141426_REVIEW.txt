L. Test Principle:
The serum sample is first incubated with the folate pretreatment reagents to release bound
folate from endogenous folate binding proteins. Then, the pretreated sample is incubated with
the ruthenium labeled folate binding protein and a folate complex is formed, the amount of
which is dependent upon the analyte concentration in the sample. Next, streptavidin-coated
microparticles and folate labeled with biotin are added and the unbound sites of the
ruthenium labeled folate binding protein become occupied, with formation of a ruthenium
labeled folate binding protein-folate biotin complex. The entire complex is bound to the solid
phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin. The reaction mixture is then aspirated into
the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the
electrode. Unbound substances are washed away and application of a voltage to the electrode
induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier. Results are
determined via a calibration curve.
Results are determined using a calibration curve that is generated specifically on
each instrument by a 2 point calibration and a master curve (5-point-calibration) provided
with the reagent bar code.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the Elecsys Folate III reagent was evaluated according to the CLSI EP5-
A2 guideline using one cobas e411 Immunoassay analyzer and one reagent lot. The
protocol consisted of testing 2 replicates of each control (PC=PreciControl Varia) and
human sera (HS) from native single donors per run, 2 runs per day in duplicate for 21
days (n=84). Total and within-run precision was calculated according to EP5-A2. The
results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the Elecsys Folate III was evaluated on the cobas e411 Immunoassay
Analyzer using CLSI EP6-A as a guideline. Serum linearity was determined by
diluting a high analyte serum sample with low analyte serum sample pool. A total of
14 different concentrations of folate ranging from 1.8 ng/mL to 21.7 ng/mL were
tested in triplicate within a single run. The linear equation generated is y=1.0969x -
1.2552 with a regression coefficient (R2) of 0.997. A polynomial regression analysis
was conducted and the 3rd order was found to be significant. The deviation of the 3rd
order regression was compared against to the first order regression (see table below).

The results of the linearity study support the sponsor’s claim that the assay is linear
from 2 to 20 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Elecsys Folate III CalSet, CalCheck and the PreciControl Varia products were
previously cleared in k082340 and k111506 (PreciControl Varia).
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LOB), Limit of Detection (LOD) and Limit of Quantitation
(LOQ) were determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A guideline. A zero level
(blank) sample buffered in human serum albumin was used for the LOB studies. The
LOB was determined as the 95th percentile of measurements of blank samples. The
Sponsor claims a LoB value of 0.60 ng/mL. For LOD determination, five low-level
serum samples (native as well as diluted with Elecsys Diluent Universal) were used.
The LOD was calculated as LOD = LOB + 1.653 x SD total. The Sponsor claims a
LoD value of 1.2 ng/mL. For LOQ determination, a low level sample set of 10
human serum samples with folate concentrations ranging from 0.9 to 3.5 ng/mL were
evaluated using 12 replicates/sample/lot across 3 reagent lots to calculate the
concentration which corresponds to an inter-assay coefficient of variation (CV) of
20%. The Sponsor claims a LOQ value of 2.0 ng/mL. This assay has a measuring
range of 2- 20 ng/mL for serum folate.
e. Analytical specificity:
The cross-reactivity of the Elecsys Folate III assay was determined using 3 serum
samples, with approximate folate concentrations of 4, 9 and 18 ng/mL folate, from
single native donors spiked with amethopterin, aminopterin and folonic acid. The
spiked and non-spiked samples were tested in duplicate on the cobas e 411
Immunoassay analyzer.

Cross-reactivity studies were performed and a summary of the results are listed below:
Interferent Maximum Highest % cross-reactivity
Concentration
Tested (ng/mL)
Amethopterin 1500 2.5
Aminopterin 1500 4.4
Folonic Acid 1500 0.7
The labeling states the following regarding cross-reactive compounds: It is
contraindicated to measure samples of patients receiving therapy with certain
pharmaceuticals, e.g. methotrexate or leucovorin, because of the cross‑reactivity of
folate binding protein with these compounds.
The effects of endogenous interference by Biotin, Lipemia, Bilirubin, Rheumatoid
Factor, Human IgG, Human IgA and Human IgM on the quantitation of Folate by the
Elecsys Folate III assay were determined on the cobas e411 Immunoassay Analyzer.
One aliquot of human serum samples containing low, mid and high folate
concentrations (approximately 3, 9 and 19 ng/mL) was spiked with interfering
samples. The second aliquot of serum samples was spiked with the same volume of
sample diluent. The interferent spiked sample was then diluted into the unspiked
aliquot in 10% increments. Percent recovery was calculated by comparing the
measured folate concentration to the expected folate initial concentration. No
significant interference was defined as ≤ 0.4 ng/mL for samples <4.0 ng/mL and ≤
10% for samples >4 ng/mL. The following results were obtained:
Endogenous Substance Concentration Showing No Significant
Interference
Biotin 21 ng/mL
Intralipid (Lipemia) 1500 mg/dL
Bilirubin 29 mg/dL
Rheumatic Factor 1000 IU/mL
Human IgG 16 g/L
Human IgM 10 g/L
Human IgA 4 g/L
The labeling states the following regarding hemoglobin interference: Hemolysis may
significantly increase folate values due to high concentrations of folate in red blood
cells. Therefore, hemolyzed samples are not suitable for use in this assay.
Sixteen commonly used pharmaceuticals were examined for potential effect on folate
determination by the Folate III assay. Each drug, including erythropoietin, was spiked
into 3 different human folate serum samples (approximate folate concentrations of 4,
11 and 18 ng/mL) and were tested in 13 replicates using the cobas e411 Immunoassay
