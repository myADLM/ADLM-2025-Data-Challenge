L. Test Principle:
The patient sample is citrate-anticoagulated whole blood, which is automatically dispensed
from the blood collection tube into the test device by the instrument, with no blood handling
required by the user. Fibrinogen-coated microparticles are used in the VerifyNow PRUTest
device to bind activated platelet GP IIb/IIIa receptors. ADP is incorporated into the assay to
activate platelets, and the reagent is formulated to specifically measure P2Y12-mediated
platelet aggregation. When the activated platelets are exposed to the fibrinogen-coated
microparticles, aggregation occurs in proportion to the number of activated platelet receptors.
The VerifyNow PRUTest reports results in P2Y12 Reaction Units (PRU).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reagent precision- whole blood:
Between-lot precision and between-instrument precision were determined in two separate
experiments. Duplicate whole blood samples from each of 9 donors covering the device’s
measuring range were tested on a minimum of five (5) non-consecutive days on three
VerifyNow™ Instruments. A different device lot was tested on each instrument, and
lot/instrument combinations were reassigned each day for randomization purposes.
Precision estimates in this experiment include the effects of both instrument and lot
variability. Within-run, between-run, between-day, and between-lot variability was
determined for each donor. With the exception of donor 7, the data met the pre-
determined acceptance criteria of ≤10% CV.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Real time stability: Real time stability studies with control lot 3 are currently ongoing.
Three lots of WQC Level 2 controls and three lots of reagent are stored at 20±5 ºC.
Each of the three lots of WQC Levels 1 and 2 were tested at time 0, 3, 6, and 9
months with each of three reagent lots. The results did not exceed the pre-specified
10% deviation from the initial measurement, supporting a stability claim of 9 months
at 20±5 ºC for both WQC Level 2 and reagent.
Level 1 WQC simulates a patient samples with highly inhibited platelets and does not
produce a significant aggregation profile. The CVs for Level 1 WQC were not
calculated because the nominal PRU value is zero. The PRU range of the Level 1
WQC does not exceed 30 PRU in the 9-month testing timeframe.
Isochronous stability reagent stability study with patient samples: In addition to real
time stability with the WQC material, blood from two donors and the two levels of
WQC material were tested at 3, 6, and 9 months with three (3) lots of reagent stored
at both -70 ºC and 20±5 ºC. The difference in means between whole blood tested with
the -70 ºC and 20±5 ºC conditions was within ≤10% further supporting the 9-month
stability claim for VerifyNow™ PRUTest reagent storage at 20±5 ºC.
Sample stability: A sample stability study was provided with blood from 11 donors
spanning the analytical measuring range (AMR) of the device. Samples were run in
duplicate after wait times of < 1, 5, 10, 20, 30 , 60, 120, 240, and 300 minutes of
storage. The acceptance criterion was defined as PRUTest values that deviated <10%
from the one-sided 95% lower confidence boundary of the PRUTest value predicted
from the regression line. All but one sample met the VerifyNow™ PRUTest sample
stability acceptance criterion for the 10-240 minute timeframe. The failed sample had
extremely low PRU values (<20 PRU). The VerifyNow™ package insert instructs the
user to wait a minimum of 10 minutes after blood draw before running the assay.

Shipping stability: Device kits were packaged by facilities personnel responsible for
shipping customer material. Effects of initial manual handling, vehicle stacking, loose
load vibration, low pressure (high altitude), vehicle vibration, impacts and final
manual handling were examined. Two test lots of reagent were subjected to
distribution testing. For each donor sample, the mean PRU result must be within
±10% of the mean of the control (un-shipped) treatment. The mean PRU result for the
shipped treatment was within ±10% of the mean of the control treatment, meeting the
pre-determined acceptance criteria.
Expected values: 84 patients with acute coronary syndrome, who are candidates for,
but are not receiving a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor and 71 patients receiving aspirin and
clopidogrel dual therapy were tested in order to determine expected value ranges. The
resulting data and statistical analysis are provided below:

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed in-house to evaluate the effect of common
substances in patient samples on the VerifyNow™ PRUTest Assay. The effect on
medications and dietary substances commonly present in the intended use population
were examined in this study. Blood samples devoid of platelet inhibitor and
containing platelet inhibitor were tested pre and post spiking with the test compound.
Platelet inhibitor containing samples were spiked with 14 mM MeSAMP to produce
PRU values of about 130 PRU. One compound (Prilosec) was tested two hours
following ingestion by healthy volunteers. The effect of the potential interferent
(spiked or ingested) on the assay result was expressed as percent recovery. Samples
were tested in randomized fashion with seven (7) instruments. The following
substances were evaluated at the indicated concentrations and met the acceptance

Fresh citrated whole blood samples are required for use with the VerifyNow PRUTest.
The sample well contains a needle for sampling directly from a closed vacuum collection
tube.
5. Calibration:
The VerifyNow™ PRUTest devices are calibrated at the factory and require no
calibration by the user. The calibration information is contained in the barcode on the
pouch of each assay device. The barcode must be scanned whenever a new lot of assay
devices are to be tested.
6. Quality Control:
Each assay device includes internal controls to determine whether the VerifyNow™
PRUTest result is valid and causes the instrument to report an error message for an
invalid test. The negative internal control test is performed during the first five seconds of
the assay, before platelet activation and binding to the fibrinogen-coated beads occurs.
The positive internal control consists of a reagent channel that is similar to the P2Y12
assay channel, except it uses Thrombin Receptor Activating Peptide (TRAP) instead of
ADP as the agonist. The positive internal control test is performed during the active
phase of the assay.
The VerifyNow™ PRUTest utilizes VerifyNow™ Wet Quality Controls (WQC) Levels 1
and 2 for verifying the integrity of the VerifyNow™ PRUTest reagents. Controls have
been formulated at clinically relevant levels with WQC Level 1 providing low level PRU
results. WQC Level 1 is a carbon sol suspension, used to mimic the optical properties of
whole blood. WQC Level 2 is designed to provide high level PRU results, comparable to
results obtained from patient samples prior to ingestion of clopidogrel. WQC Level 2 is a
lyophilized pellet, which is added to the diluent vial and reconstituted before use.
WQC Level 2 uses a peptide that binds to fibrinogen to induce aggregation, which
simulates the binding of fibrinogen-coated microparticles to platelets in the VerifyNow™
PRUTest. Assigned values for WQC Level 1 (≤ 30 PRU) and Level 2 (228 – 372 PRU)
are included in the package insert.
The VerifyNow™ System contains the following internal controls:
• The instrument automatically verifies sample filling, correct fluid transfer and mixing.
It also monitors the electronic and mechanical components.
• Each assay device incorporates two levels of quality control to identify invalid test runs
caused by random error, reagent degradation or inappropriate blood samples. Before
platelet activation and fibrinogen binding begin, the negative internal control performs a
test for non-specific aggregation. During the active phase of the assay, the positive
internal control channel monitors the reaction and calculates Control Units, which must
fall within specified limits.
Electronic Quality Control (EQC) is one quality control mechanism for the VerifyNow™
instrument. It is a reusable device that is inserted by the operator into the assay port and is
used to perform a comprehensive testing routine that confirms performance of instrument
optics, the pneumatics system, reagent mixing parameters, calibration parameters,

simulates assay testing at two levels to check correct data acquisition and calculation and
the required EQC testing frequency. Accumetrics recommends that EQC be run at least
on a daily basis, although a preferred testing frequency may be selected by the institution.
When the established test interval has elapsed, the user is locked out from running a
patient test until the EQC test has been successfully completed.
P. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
Q. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
