L. Test Principle:
The LIAISON® XL 1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D assay is a modified three-step sandwich
assay that uses a recombinant fusion protein for capture of the 1,25 (OH) D molecule
2
and a murine monoclonal antibody which specifically recognizes the complex formed
by the recombinant fusion protein with the 1,25(OH) D molecule. Results are
2
determined by a two-point calibration conversion of the master curve to a working
curve. The light signal is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is
proportional to the concentration of 1,25dihydroxyvitamin D present in the calibrators,
controls or patient samples.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated based on CLSI EP-6A, Evaluation of the Linearity of
Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach. One serum sample
pool was spiked in order to obtain a concentration above the assay measuring range.
The sample was then diluted with specimen diluent to yield 13 sample concentrations
spanning the measuring range of the assay (5-200 pg/mL). Each dilution point was
tested in singlicate on one LIAISON XL Analyzer. The 1-25 dihydroxyvitamin D
values of the samples were compared to their expected concentrations to determine
the linear regression equations for each sample type shown below:
Linear Regression R2 Sample range
(pg/mL)
y=0.97x – 2.67 0.993 0.015 to 222.0
The linearity results support the claimed measuring range of this device (5- 200
pg/mL).

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification (LoQ)
studies were performed according to CLSI EP-17A2.
To establish the Limit of Blank (LoB), five blank samples consisting of vitamin D
stripped human serum were assayed in duplicate on two analyzers, with two reagent lots
over six runs for a total of 60 test results per reagent lot. The Limit of Blank was
determined by the following equation:
LoB=µ (Blank Dose) + 1.653 * σ (Blank Dose)
The LoB was determined to be 0.35 pg/mL.
To establish the Limit of Detection (LoD), four samples consisting of human serum
diluted with vitamin D stripped human serum in the range of approximately 0 to 9 pg/mL
were tested in duplicate on two analyzers with two reagent lots over six runs over three
days for a total of 96 results. LoD was calculated for each of the 2 reagent lots using the
following equation:
LoD=μ (Blank Dose) + 1.653 * σ (Blank Dose) + 1.655 * σs (Sample Dose)
The LoD was determined to be 0.70 pg/mL
The Limit of Quantification (LoQ) was determined by measuring 9 samples consisting of
human serum diluted with vitamin D stripped human serum in a concentration range of 0
to 20 pg/mL in duplicate on two analyzers with two reagent lots over six runs and three
days yielding 144 results. LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration at which the
interassay precision is ≤ 20%. Of the 3 reagent lots tested, the highest LoQ was found to
be 3.96 pg/mL. The sponsor defines the LoQ as 5.0 pg/mL.

b. Matrix comparison:
Fifty-two (52) matched human sample sets SST serum, EDTA plasma, and Lithium
Heparin plasma samples with values that spanned the range of the assay of serum
were tested to determine if these sample types provide equivalent results on the
LIAISON® XL 1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D assay. The following results were
obtained:
Serum vs Slope 95% CI Intercept 95% CI R2
SST Serum 1.001 0.99 to 1.03 -0.285 -1.08 to 0.83 0.9908
EDTA 1.010 0.98 to 1.04 0.321 -1.15 to 1.64 0.9975
Plasma
Li Heparin 1.000 0.97 to 1.04 0.1000 -1.24 to 1.31 0.9957

5. Expected values/Reference range:
To determine the expected reference range for the LIAISON® XL 1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin
D assay, a study was performed with serum samples from 123 apparently healthy adults
aged 21 -75 years of age from mixed ethnic backgrounds (48% dark skinned and 52%
light skinned). Samples were collected in the winter (48.8%) and summer (51.2%) from
subjects with normal Total Calcium, TSH, and PTH values from the northern, central and
southern regions of the U.S. Based on the 95% Reference Interval, the following values
were established following CLSI guideline C28-A3.
LIAISON® XL 1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D Observed Reference Range
US Subjects Median Observed Range
2.5th to 97.5th percentile
123 47.8 pg/mL 19.9 to 79.3 pg/mL
The sponsor states in the labeling that it is recommended that each laboratory establish its
own range of expected values.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
