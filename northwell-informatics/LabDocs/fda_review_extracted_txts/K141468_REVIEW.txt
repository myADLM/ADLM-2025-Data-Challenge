E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The BD FACSCanto™ II system (4-2-2 and 5-3 configurations) and the BD
FACSCanto™ (4-3-3 configuration) systems consist of a flow cytometer, a self-contained
fluidics cart, and a computer workstation. System options include an automated sample
loader, a barcode reader, and a sample preparation assistant.
All optical configurations of the FACSCanto™ II share the same dimensions: 25.2 inches
in height by 35.7 inches in width by 24 inches in depth. The units are designed to fit a
lab bench 22 inches in depth. Each system weighs less than 320 pounds, excluding the
FACSLoader and computer workstation. They are able to accept 100/115/230 VAC
(volts alternating current) at 50-60 Hertz. Power consumption is rated at 500 Watts.
The FACSCanto™ 4-3-3 configuration shares the same height and width as the
FACSCanto™ II instrument but is 25 inches deep and designed to fit on a 27 inches deep
lab bench. It weighs less than the FACSCanto™ II instrument (270 pounds without
FACSLoader or workstation) and has similar power input and consumption
specifications.

2. Principles of Operation:
Flow cytometers combine fluidics, optics, and electronics subsystems to measure and
analyze signals emitted when particles in a liquid stream flow through a glass cuvette, at
which beams of laser light are directed. The scatter and fluorescence light signals from
these particles provide information about cell size, internal complexity, and relative
fluorescence intensity. The Instructions for Use for each BD FACSCanto™ II and BD
FACSCanto™ instrument includes more details on the system components and theory of
operations.
The instruments are intended for use with cleared or approved in vitro diagnostic (IVD)
assays for the identification and enumeration of human cell subsets that are indicated for

1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
The Accuracy study design was based on recommendations in the CLSI document
EP9-A2. Method comparison with the predicate instrument configuration was used to
determine accuracy through comparative evaluation of the same specimen stained
with the BD Multitest IMK Kit (4-color; IMK) and the BD Multitest 6-color TBNK
reagent (TBNK) and analyzed in parallel with the test method and predicate device.
Surplus samples were obtained with IRB approval from Johns Hopkins Medical
Institutions, Baltimore, MD, and from Biocollections Worldwide, Inc.
For each test system (BD FACSCanto™ II 4-2-2 configuration, BD FACSCanto™ II
5-3 configuration, and BD FACSCanto™ 4-3-3 configuration), the accuracy studies
shared the same design and differed only by the system configuration under test, the
source of samples, and total number of samples tested. For the purposes of the study,
accuracy was defined as the relative or absolute difference between the two systems
for each of the specified parameters.
Manufacture’s pre-defined acceptance criteria were as follows:
Average Predicate Average Predicate
Lymphocyte Value <30% Value >30%
Subset Percentage Criteria = Absolute ±3% of average Criteria = Absolute ±10%
predicate Value of average predicate Value
CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ CD19+,CD16+ CD56+
Lymphocyte ≤ 10% relative
≤ 20% relative to the
Subset Absolute to the predicate,
predicate
Counts i.e. ((test-pred)/pred)x100%)≤10%
All results for all three instrument configurations on both the IMK kit and TBNK kit
were determined by assay, result type (absolute count or subset percentages), and
subset in both Bland Altman (bias) plots and Deming Regression scatter plots. All

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Instrument precision is assay-dependent and should be performed with each IVD
assay intended for use with the instruments.
To assess variability within the instrument configurations, two precision studies were
conducted using control materials and whole blood.
Precision studies with control material were conducted in accordance with CLSI
EP05-A2. Whole blood controls for lymphocyte subset enumeration were used to
estimate precision for the following parameters:
· Percent and absolute count of CD4+ T lymphocytes
· Percent and absolute count of CD8+ T lymphocytes
· Percent and absolute count of CD3+ T lymphocytes
· Percent and absolute count of CD19+ B lymphocytes
· Percent and absolute count of CD16+56+ NK lymphocytes
Data were acquired on multiple test systems (BD FACSCanto™ II 4-2-2
configuration, BD FACSCanto™ II 5-3 configuration, BD FACSCanto™ 4-3-3
configuration) equipped with BD FACSLoaders. For each test system, instruments
were rotated over the study duration for at least 21 days, using one instrument per
day. Multiple different operators were rotated to collect data throughout the study.
Measurements were obtained from two separate runs per day. Each run was
separated by a minimum of 4 hours. Only one operator collected samples per system
per day for both reagents. The instruments were set up for acquisition of samples
using BD FACS 7-color setup beads and the BD FACSCanto™ clinical software
setup module. Tested samples consisted of two levels of whole blood control cells.
Quality control samples were included in each run. Each tested sample was stained in
duplicate, and each quality control sample was stained singly with the BD Multitest
IMK Kit (4-color) and with the BD Multitest 6-color TBNK reagent in BD Trucount
tubes.
The manufacture’s pre-defined acceptance criteria for total precision and within-run
precision values for subset percentages and for absolute counts were as follows:
· Subset percentages: the upper one-sided 95% confidence bound on the
standard deviation should be ≤ 2.5% for CD3+, CD3+CD4+, and CD3+CD8+
lymphocytes.
· Absolute counts: the upper one-sided 95% confidence bound of the percent
CV should be ≤ 10% for T lymphocytes and ≤ 20% for CD19+ lymphocytes
and CD16+56+ lymphocytes.
A second whole blood repeatability study was performed to assess instrument
precision using patient samples. The whole blood specimens used in the accuracy
16

--- Page 17 ---
study were used to determine repeatability (all samples done in duplicate) therefore
results cannot be directly compared across instruments. Samples adequately
represented the CD4 analytical measuring range and included concentrations around
the medical decision points for each kit.
All parameters for the BD Multitest 6-color TBNK reagent and BD Multitest IMK
Kit (4-color) met the precision/reproducibility (control material) and repeatability
(whole-blood) criteria for the BD FACSCanto™ II 4-2-2 with BD FACSCanto™
clinical software, the BD FACSCanto™ II 5-3 configuration with BD FACSCanto™
clinical software, and the BD FACSCanto™ 4-3-3 configuration with BD
FACSCanto™ clinical software.
c. Linearity:
Instrument linearity is assay-dependent and should be performed with each IVD assay
intended for use with the instrument configurations.
Linearity studies were performed on each configuration to mathematically verify that
the relationship between the observed values and the true concentrations of the
analyte was linear for each configuration. The objective of each linearity study was to
estimate the linearity of the test systems (BD FACSCanto™ II 4-2-2 configuration,
BD FACSCanto™ II 5-3 configuration, and BD FACSCanto™ 4-3-3 configuration,
each with BD FACSCanto™ clinical software) using the BD Multitest IMK Kit (4-
color) and the BD Multitest 6-color TBNK reagent for the lyse/no-wash method of
sample preparation.
Linearity was demonstrated in accordance with CLSI EP06-A section 5.3.
Appropriate sample dilutions were chosen across the assays’ ranges. Whole blood
from one donor was collected; the mononuclear cells were harvested and stained to
determine the subset cell count to ensure that the dilutions would cover the full
linearity range. The autologous plasma was reserved and used to pool the specimen
into 11 evenly spaced dilutions. Replicates of each dilution were stained with the BD
Multitest IMK Kit (4-color) and BD Multitest 6-color TBNK Reagent in Trucount
tubes.
For the absolute counts of each detailed subset (CD4+, CD8+, CD3+, CD19+, and
CD16+CD56+), the system was considered linear if the higher order coefficient terms
(2nd and 3rd order terms) of the polynomial model are not statistically significant.
Regression statistics, including 2-sided 95% confidence intervals and percent
recovery were provided for all each cellular subset. The instrument system using the
FACSCanto Clinical software for the IMK and TBNK assay was found to be linear
for each parameter (absolute counts) for each configuration.

--- Page 18 ---
d. Carryover:
Specimen carry over studies were performed on the BD FACSCanto™ II and BD
FACSCanto™ 4-3-3 configuration to determine whether cellular results were
materially affected by residue or other contamination from neighboring samples.
Carryover for both manual and BD FACSLoader acquisition was evaluated on each
of three BD FACSCanto™ 4-3-3 configuration and three BD FACSCanto™ II
instruments. Percent carryover was estimated by introducing three consecutive
abnormally high leucocyte prepared samples followed by three consecutive
abnormally low leucocyte prepared samples, and calculating the percent difference
according to the formula % Carryover = [(L1-L3)/H3-L3)]*100.
Manufactures predetermined acceptance criteria were as follows:
· For each donor on each BD FACSCanto™ II and each BD FACSCanto™ 4-
3-3 configuration instrument used in the study, the leucocyte carryover
percentage shall be ≤ ± 0.1% when the sample is loaded manually.
· For each donor on each BD FACSCanto™ II and each BD FACSCanto™ 4-
3-3 configuration instrument used in the study, the leucocyte carryover
percentage shall be ≤ ± 0.5%, when the sample is automatically loaded.
Carryover from one specimen to another was demonstrated to be less than the
predetermined acceptance limits. The BD FACSCanto™ 4-2-2 and 5-3-
configurations and the BD FACSCanto ™ 4-3-3 configuration showed acceptable
leucocyte carryover.
