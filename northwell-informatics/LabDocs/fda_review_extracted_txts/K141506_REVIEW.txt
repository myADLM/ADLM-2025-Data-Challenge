H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Para-Fix Cary Blair Medium provides a method for collecting and preserving fecal
specimens for the culture of intestinal enteric bacteria. Because the medium is capable of
maintaining the bacteria for 96 hours, immediate transportation and processing of the
specimen is not necessary.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Para-Fix Cary Blair Medium provides a method for collecting and preserving fecal
specimens for the culture of intestinal enteric bacteria. Because the medium is capable of
maintaining the bacteria for 96 hours, immediate transportation and processing of the
specimen is not necessary.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For in vitro diagnostic use only
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
None
I. Device Description:
Para-Fix Cary Blair medium is supplied in a 30 mL vial that contains 15 ml of medium.
The lid has a built in sample collection spoon. The Cary Blair medium is a non-nutritive,
buffered, isotonic solution with a pH indicator added. The medium also contains agar and
sodium thioglycolate to maintain a low oxygen tension for the preservation of anaerobic
species. The phenol red indicator will turn yellow when the solution is acidic and the
conditions are not optimal for recovery of the intended organisms. The transport vial is
intended to transport common enteric parasites found in the stool of infected patients. The
kit does not include a swab.

L. Test Principle:

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
The performance characteristics of Para-Fix Cary Blair transport vials were determined by
spiking enteric organisms prepared either in Para-Fix Cary Blair transport medium or in
clinically negative fecal matrix/Para-Fix Cary Blair transport medium. Swab Elution and
Roll-Plate methods were used in accordance with the CLSI M40-A2 document to determine
recovery of viable enteric organisms. Initially, ten (10) enteric organisms in Para-Fix Cary
Blair transport medium were tested using only the Swab Elution method. Subsequently, as an
additional challenge, further evaluation of the transport device was also performed using
three (3) representative organisms, which were tested in fecal matrix/Para-Fix Cary Blair
transport medium using both the Swab Elution and Roll-Plate methods.
The 10 organisms listed below were added directly to Para-Fix Cary Blair Medium and tested
by the Swab Elution Method:
Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212
Escherichia coli ATCC 8739
Shigella dysenteriae ATCC 9361
Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027
Salmonella enterica ATCC 10708
Vibrio parahaemolyticus ATCC 17802
Clostridium difficile ATCC 9689
Campylobacter jejuni ATCC 33291
Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538

The following 3 challenge organisms were spiked into clinically negative fecal matrix and
Para-Fix Cary Blair Medium and tested by the Roll-Plate and Swab Elution Methods:
Escherichia coli O157 ATCC 43894
Salmonella enterica ATCC 10708
Vibrio parahaemolyticus ATCC 17802
Acceptance criteria for recovery of bacteria as recommended in the CLSI document M40-A2
were applied. No over growth limit is defined by CLSI M40-A2 at room temperature (20-
25°C) for the Swab Elution or Roll-Plate Methods because most commercial transport media
cannot control for it.
Manual colony counts were conducted for the Roll-Plate Method and the Swab Elution
Method at the four time intervals (0 hr, 72 hr, 96 hr and 120 hr) for the representative
organisms. The averages from 3 vials plated in duplicate, (n=6) were used to generate plate
counts and assess recovery and viability of organisms.
Swab Elution Method:
The results of the Swab Elution Method studies are presented in Table 1 for all enteric
organisms in Para-Fix Cary Blair transport medium and in Table 2 for the three (3)
representative challenge enteric organisms in a mixture of Para-Fix Cary Blair transport
medium and fecal matrix. The results demonstrate that the Para-Fix Cary Blair Medium is
able to support and maintain acceptable viability of all organisms up to 96 hours when taken
from pure culture and up to 120 hours when spiked into fecal matrix, at both room
temperature (20-25°C) and under refrigerated (2-8°C) conditions. Acceptability is based on
the acceptance criteria set forth in CLSI M40-A2. For viability in the Swab Elution Method
to be considered acceptable, there shall be no more than a 3 log (1 x 103 +/- 10%) decline in
10
CFU between the zero-time CFU count and the CFU counts for the predetermined end time
point. This was demonstrated for all organisms tested.
Roll-Plate Method for Challenge Organisms:
The results of the Roll-Plate Method study are presented in Table 3 below for the three (3)
representative challenge enteric organisms. The results demonstrate that the Para-Fix Cary
Blair Medium is able to maintain acceptable viability for all organisms up to 120 hours at
room temperature (20-25°C) and under refrigerated (2-8°C) conditions based on the
acceptance criteria set forth in CLSI M40-A2. For the transport system to demonstrate
acceptable viability by the Roll-Plate method, ≥5 CFU should be recovered following the
specified maintenance time from the specific dilution that yielded time-zero plate counts
closest to 300 CFU.

Overgrowth Evaluation:
No over growth limit is defined by CLSI M40-A2 at room temperature (20-25°C) for the
Swab Elution or Roll-Plate Methods because most commercial transport media cannot
control for it. Para-Fix Cary Blair is no different; overgrowth at room temperature (20-25°C)
was recorded as Too Numerous To Count (TNTC) for the studies conducted with fecal
matrix.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Shelf life: The shelf life for Para-Fix Cary Blair vials is 18 months after the date of
manufacture. The stability tests were performed on 3 lots of Para-Fix Cary Blair
Medium up to 18 months of storage.
pH Stability: The pH value of Para-Fix Cary Blair Medium up to 18 months of
storage was 6.88 to 7.05.
Sterilization: Para-Fix Cary Blair Medium vials are not sold as sterile, nor are they
intended to be sterilized by the user. These vials are single use devices that do not
require cleaning by the operator. Although there is no sterility claim, the
manufacturing process includes treatment of finished vials in a steam chamber for 30
minutes to eliminate bioburden.

Bench testing studies were done to determine the ability of Para-Fix Cary Blair Medium
to maintain viability of different strains of intestinal enteric bacteria with and without
fecal matrix. Para-Fix Cary Blair Medium showed recovery of representative bacteria
from fecal matrix within the acceptance criteria recommended in CLSI-M40-A2 and
similar to the predicate device. (See above under Performance Characteristics).
