H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Alere™ i Influenza A & B assay performed on the Alere™ i Instrument is a rapid molecular in vitro
diagnostic test utilizing an isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology for the qualitative detection
and discrimination of influenza A and B viral RNA in nasal swabs from patients with signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection. It is intended for use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of
influenza A and B viral infections in humans in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk
factors. The assay is not intended to detect the presence of influenza C virus.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for
diagnosis, treatment or other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2012-2013 influenza season
when influenza A/H3 and A/H1N1 pandemic were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation.
When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological
screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with
appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to state or local
health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+
facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

I. Device Description:
Overview
The Alere™ i Influenza A & B assay system utilizes an isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology
and is comprised of:
· Sample Receiver – single use, disposable containing the elution buffer
· Test Base – single use, disposable comprising two sealed reaction tubes, each containing a
lyophilized pellet
· Transfer Cartridge – single use, disposable for transfer of the eluted sample to the Test Base
· Alere™ i Instrument – repeat use reader, and
· Alere™ i Influenza A & B positive and negative external controls – for quality control
purposes
2

--- Page 3 ---
· Nasal Swabs – sterile swabs for use with the Alere™ i Influenza A & B Test.
The first reaction tube (Tube 1) in the Test Base contains the reagents required for amplification of the
influenza A target viral nucleic acid, and the second reaction tube (Tube 2) in the Test Base contains
reagents required for amplification of the influenza B target viral nucleic acid and an internal control
synthetic RNA sequence. Alere™ i Influenza A & B utilizes pairs of templates (similar to primers in a PCR
reaction) for the specific isothermal amplification of target RNA sequences from influenza A (highly
conserved region of the PB2 gene), influenza B (highly conserved region of the PA gene), and the internal
control, and fluorescently labeled molecular beacons designed to specifically identify the amplified
products. Alere™ i Influenza A & B is performed within the confinement of the Test Base, and no other part
of the Alere™ i Instrument has contact with the sample during the amplification process.
To perform the assay, the Sample Receiver and the Test Base are inserted into the Alere™ i Instrument and
the elution buffer is automatically heated by the instrument. The sample is added to the Sample Receiver
and transferred via the Transfer Cartridge to the Test Base, resuspending the lyophilized pellet contained
within the Test Base and initiating target amplification. Heating, mixing and detection by fluorescence are
provided by the instrument, with results automatically reported.
Results (positive, negative, or invalid) are displayed by the Alere™ i Instrument separately for influenza A
and influenza B. Results are also stored in an on-board archive and are assigned to a sample ID that has
been entered into the Alere™ i Instrument by the operator, and the date/time the test was performed. Data
can be retrieved and downloaded by the operator at any time after testing. An external Alere™ Universal
Printer can be attached via USB to the Alere™ i Instrument to print test results.
Alere™ i Influenza A & B System Components
Sample Receiver
The Sample Receiver is a foil sealed, single-use, disposable plastic component containing 2.5ml of an
elution/lysis buffer. Rapid elution of influenza virus from swabs and virus lysis occur through the action of
the elution/lysis buffer. The elution/lysis buffer contains salts at the appropriate concentrations that are
required for the test reaction, which upon transfer of the sample using the Transfer Cartridge to the Test
Base, is used to reconstitute the lyophilized pellets. The elution/lysis buffer also contains a chelating agent
to remove any heavy metals found in the sample, as they are potential inhibitors of the test reaction.
Transfer Cartridge
The Transfer Cartridge is a single-use, disposable plastic component for transfer of the eluted sample to the
Test Base. The aspiration of the sample is achieved by placing the Transfer Cartridge over the Sample
Receiver and pressing downwards until a click is heard and the orange indicator on the top of the Transfer
Device is up. The dispense of the sample is achieved by placing the Transfer Cartridge into the Test Base
and pressing on the Transfer Cartridge until the orange indicator on the top of the Transfer Cartridge
descends. When the indicator descends, so does the plunger, thus driving the sample out of the two nozzles
and into the reaction tubes in the Test Base and mixing with the lyophilized reagent in the reaction tubes.
Test Base
The Test Base is a single-use, disposable plastic component comprising two sealed reaction tubes, the first
reaction tube (Tube 1) is for the influenza A reaction and the second tube (Tube 2) is for the influenza B and
the Internal Control reactions. Each reaction tube contains a lyophilized pellet which provides all of the
necessary reagents to drive the respective reaction(s) except for salts. Tube 2 also contains an internal
3

--- Page 4 ---
control synthetic RNA sequence. The salts that are required for the test reactions are provided at their
appropriate concentrations within the elution/lysis buffer contained in the Sample Receiver. Upon transfer
of the sample from the Sample Receiver to the Test Base using the Transfer Cartridge, the sample in
elution/lysis buffer is used to reconstitute the lyophilized pellets. The Alere™ i Influenza A & B reaction is
performed within the Test Base. As soon as the sample is transferred, it comes into contact with the
lyophilized pellets, reconstitutes the lyophilized pellets and initiates the assay reaction. Each Test Base
contains a barcode with assay specific information (assay ID, expiration date and lot number). The barcode
is read automatically from the Test Base upon insertion into the Alere™ i Instrument, providing the
information necessary to run the assay.
Alere™ i Instrument
The Alere™ i Instrument is a portable bench-top unit designed to perform in laboratory and point-of care
environments. Alere™ i Influenza A & B components are color-coded to match the corresponding holder on
the instrument and designed to only fit in the corresponding holder in one direction. The Alere™ i
Instrument uses image analysis to automatically detect the presence of the Test Base and to check the test
type and expiry date on the barcode present on the Test Base. This triggers the test sequence. Heating,
mixing, and detection by fluorescence are provided by the instrument. The Alere™ i Instrument is equipped
with two optical fluorescence modules, FAM™ and ROX™. Each optical module consists of a LED
excitation source and photodiode receiver configured to the fluorescent channel. Fluorescence signals are
optically filtered by a confocal lens and mirror arrangement and processed by software running on an on-
board computer. The results are calculated automatically and presented on the instrument graphical user
interface and available for export in JSON format or printing.
Alere™ i Influenza A & B External Controls
Alere™ i Influenza A & B External Controls are designed for use with Alere™ i Influenza A & B. The
Positive Control swab is coated with inactivated influenza A virus and inactivated influenza B virus dried
onto a swab. The Negative Control swab is coated with inactivated Streptococcus Group C dried onto a
swab.
Nasal Swabs
Sterile swabs for use with the Alere™ i Influenza A & B test are provided as a part of the Alere™ i
Influenza A & B System.
Alere™ i Influenza A & B Workflow
An overview of the Alere™ i Influenza A & B workflow is summarized below:
1. User ID and Patient ID are entered via the touch screen prior to initiating the testing sequence.
Patient information can be entered by two means:
· by using the Instrument touch screen
· by using a barcode reader
2. The Alere™ i Influenza A & B Test Base barcode contains assay information (test type, expiry date,
and lot number). Upon proper insertion into the Test Base holder of the instrument, using image
analysis the instrument automatically detects the presence of the Test Base and checks the test type,
expiry date, and lot number encoded in the barcode. Insertion of an expired Test Base will generate
an error message on the instrument screen and the user is not able to proceed with testing. Upon
confirmation of the Test Base insertion the user is instructed to insert the Sample Receiver.
4

--- Page 5 ---
3. The Alere™ i Instrument detects the insertion of the Sample Receiver into the Sample Receiver
holder and automatically progresses to the warm-up state. The instrument software implements
temperature control of both the Test Base and the Sample Receiver holders (heater blocks). Each of
the heater blocks is managed independently with high precision temperature monitoring and control.
4. Upon completion of the warm-up state, the Alere™ i Instrument instructs the user to remove the foil
seal from the Sample Receiver, insert (direct nasal swab specimen) sample to the elution buffer
contained in the Sample Receiver, and mix as described on the screen.
5. The Alere™ i Instrument then instructs the user to transfer the sample in the Sample Receiver to the
Test Base using the Transfer Cartridge.
6. The Alere™ i Instrument uses image analysis to confirm that the Transfer Cartridge is present in the
Test Base, instructs the user to close the lid, and automatically proceeds to the measurement state
upon detection of test bay lid closure. The lid operates using a magnetic switch system that detects
lid closure and an electrical signal triggers testing commencement. Heating, rotation and detection
by fluorescence is provided by the instrument.
7. Upon completion of the testing sequence, results are displayed on the screen and are presented to the
user as positive, negative, or invalid separately for influenza A and influenza B. Upon
acknowledgement of the test results, the user is instructed to dispose of the used test components.
The turnaround time for testing a sample is approximately 15 minutes.
Quality Control
Internal Control (Procedural Control)
Alere™ i Influenza A & B contains an internal control (IC) that was designed to control for sample
inhibition, amplification, and assay reagent function for both influenza A and influenza B. The IC is an
RNA oligonucleotide contains 5’ and 3’ ends that are complementary to the influenza B target template set’s
recognition regions, but with a spacer region (the region between the two recognition regions) that differs
from the influenza B target’s spacer region. The IC is present in the second reaction tube (Tube 2) of the
Test Base along with all of the necessary reagents to drive the influenza B and the IC reactions except for
salts. Detection of the IC occurs via a molecular beacon that specifically detects the amplified product
generated from the IC RNA oligonucleotide. The two molecular beacons present in the second reaction tube
of the Test Base are labeled with fluorophores with distinct excitation/emission profiles (Influenza B – FAM
and IC – ROX), enabling detection of both beacons simultaneously using a two-color detector.
In positive samples where influenza target amplification is strong, the IC result is ignored. The influenza B
target amplification in Tube 2 of the Test Base also serves as the “Control” to confirm that the clinical
sample was not inhibitory and that influenza A reagent performance in Tube 1 was robust. At a low
frequency, clinical samples can contain inhibitors that may generate invalid results.
Procedural Controls
In addition to the test specific Internal Control described previously, the Alere™ i instrument also employs
additional “Procedural Controls” to ensure that a test is performed appropriately. Each Test Base has a
barcode which identifies the test type – the instrument automatically detects the Test Base and asks the user
to confirm the test type. Each of the additional steps (sample heating, sample transfer, and closing the lid,
etc.) are monitored by the instrument and if the user takes too long to complete a certain step, the instrument
will time out, generate an error and a result is not reported.
5

--- Page 6 ---
“Procedural Control Valid” displayed on the instrument screen indicates that the assay reagents maintained
their functional integrity and the sample did not significantly inhibit assay performance.
External Positive and Negative Controls
Good laboratory practice suggests the use of positive and negative controls to ensure that test reagents are
working and that the test is correctly performed. Alere™ i Influenza A & B kits contain Positive and
Negative Control Swabs. These swabs monitor the entire assay. Test these swabs once with each new
shipment received and once for each new operator. Further controls may be tested in order to conform to
local, state and/or federal regulations, accrediting groups, or laboratory’s standard Quality Control
procedures.
Results Interpretation
The Alere™ i Instrument software automatically interprets test results. Alere™ i Influenza A & B assay
operates in the Test Base with two separate reaction tubes, Tube 1 and Tube 2, for influenza A and influenza B
plus IC respectively. The assay uses the following three fluorescent channels: Flu A (FAM) in Tube 1, Flu B
(FAM) in Tube 2, and IC (ROX) in Tube 2. The ROX channel in Tube 1 is not used. Each channel of each
reaction tube is first individually assessed using a defined channel decision algorithm and assigned a channel
result as “Asserted”, “Not Asserted” or “Indeterminate”. The individual channel results are then combined to
arrive at the influenza A and influenza B results. All nine possible assay result combinations and the respective
underlying assay decision logic rules are presented in Table 1 below:

L. Test Principle:
Individual reactions for influenza A and B and IC, provided as lyophilized pellets contained within the Test
Base, specifically amplify unique target regions within the RNA genomes of these two viruses and the IC.
Alere™ i Influenza A & B employs fluorescently-labeled molecular beacon probes for real-time detection
of amplified products. Alere™ i Influenza A & B amplification technology, Nicking and Extension
Amplification Reaction (NEAR) is isothermal and does not require a heat denaturation step to generate a
single strand target for amplification. Instead a thermostable, strand-displacing DNA polymerase, a
thermostable nicking endonuclease, and two oligonucleotides (typically known as primers, but are referred
to as templates in this technology) are utilized. Reverse transcriptase is also present in the reaction. The
products of Alere™ i Influenza A & B are two complementary oligonucleotides 30 – 40 nucleotides in
length. A product of this size is of sufficient length to be highly unique amongst genomes. The exact length
of the products depends on the specific placement of the templates relative to one another and relative to
their complementary sequences within the target genome. Alere™ i Influenza A & B assay specificity is
achieved through two levels of sequence-specific interrogation, template annealing to complementary target
sequence at an elevated temperature to drive target-specific amplification, and amplification product
detection as the molecular beacon anneals to Alere™ i Influenza A & B amplification product in a
sequence-specific fashion.
Alere™ i Influenza A & B Isothermal Amplification Mechanism
Alere™ i Influenza A & B isothermal amplification, NEAR, is driven by a thermostable strand displacing
DNA polymerase, thermostable nicking endonuclease, two oligonucleotide templates, plus a reverse
transcriptase. The Alere™ i Influenza A & B oligonucleotide template (primer) consists of three distinct
regions. The 5’-end of the template is known as the stabilizing region (SR) which is not involved in target-
specific complementary sequence-dependent annealing, but rather in stabilizing the double stranded
products generated during amplification. The central region of each template maintains the nicking
endonuclease binding site (NEBS) and nicking endonuclease cut site (NECS), which also are not
complementary to the target sequence, but provide the sequence required for single strand nicking activity
by the nicking endonuclease. At the 3’-end of each template is the recognition region (RR), which provides
target-specific, sequence-dependent annealing. Typically, the RR is 11 – 12 nucleotides in length on each
template. As shown in Figure 1 below, step 1a, the recognition region (RR) of template T2 (labeled as Y),
anneals to a complimentary sequence present in the single strand DNA target (labeled as Y’). In step 2a, a
DNA polymerase extends T2 from its 3’-OH group generating sequence X which is complementary to
target sequence X’. In this step only the 3’ end of T2 anneals to a target sequence in a complementary
fashion. The SR, NEBS and NECS regions of the template are not complementary to the target sequence. In
step 3a, a second T2 template displaces the original, partially annealed T2. DNA polymerase extension from
this second T2 displaces the first synthesized strand. T1 recognizes, anneals to and extends from sequence X
of the displaced strand (step 4a). This leaves a product containing a double strand NEBS and NECS (step
5a). A nicking endonuclease will then bind to its recognition site and nick the structure at its cut site. This
generates an accessible 3’-OH that can be extended by the DNA polymerase, resulting in the release of a
single strand DNA (containing regions X and Y) and generation of a double strand DNA product containing
NEBS and NECS on both ends (step 6a), known as the Amplification Duplex. Figure 1 depicts the linear
phase of the mechanism, essentially the generation of the NEAR Amplification Duplex.

Figure 1 – Alere™ i Influenza A & B Mechanism – Linear Phase
In Figure 2 below, the geometric amplification phase is depicted. The NEAR Amplification Duplex is a
double strand DNA structure containing two complete nicking endonuclease binding and cut sites (1b). As
shown in 2b, nicking of the top and bottom strands occurs, providing the DNA polymerase two 3’-OH
groups for initiating strand displacement extension. This results in the release of X’ Y’ (specific product 1)
and X Y (specific product 2) products, and the generation of two double strand DNA moieties containing
single nicking endonuclease binding and cut sites (3b). The two moieties undergo reiterative nicking and
extension, generating additional specific products 1 and 2 (3b). Specific products 1 and 2 are substrates for
T2 and T1 (4b). Extension of these complexes (4b) generates additional double strand DNA moieties
containing single nicking endonuclease binding and cut sites (3b), with the result of this reiterative nicking
and extension being geometric amplification.

Alere™ i Influenza A & B Amplification Detection Mechanism
The intentional skewing of templates leading to asymmetric amplification product formation is necessary
for optimal performance of the real-time fluorescence-based molecular beacon detection system coupled to
the Alere™ i Influenza A & B amplification technology. Molecular beacons are single-stranded DNA
sequences that are able to form hairpin loop structures. The hairpin is formed by complementary 5’ and 3’-
ends that are typically 4 – 7 nucleotides in length. Molecular beacons contain a fluorophore and a quencher,
typically at opposite ends of the molecular beacon’s linear nucleotide sequence. When the molecular beacon
forms a hairpin structure, the fluorophore and quencher are in close proximity, and fluorescence is
quenched. Upon opening of the hairpin, which can occur when a complementary DNA or RNA species
anneals to the molecular beacon’s loop region, the distance between the fluorophore and quencher is
lengthened, reducing the ability of the quencher to quench the fluorescence signal. As a result, fluorescence
is emitted and can be measured using an optical reader. The amount of fluorescence released is directly
proportional to the amount of molecular beacon that has been opened, and concomitantly, the amount of
complementary DNA or RNA species present in the sample. The result of the Alere™ i Influenza A & B
NEAR amplification reaction is two specific products which are perfect complements to one another. These
two specific products form a very stable double strand DNA structure at assay temperature. In order to
combine the use of the Alere™ i Influenza A & B NEAR technology and molecular beacons, the
concentrations of the two templates present in the Alere™ i Influenza A & B assay are skewed relative to
one another to drive asymmetric product formation, i.e., one product is made to a larger extent than the
other. The product that is generated in excess is then targeted by the molecular beacon. Annealing of the
loop region of the molecular beacon to the Alere™ i Influenza A & B product generated in excess results in
opening of the hairpin stem, separation of the fluorophore and quencher, and ultimately fluorescence signal
release.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility Study
Reproducibility performance was evaluated for the Alere™ i Influenza A & B at three testing sites.
Six Alere™ i instruments (per study site) were utilized at Site 1 and Site 2, and four Alere™ i
instruments were utilized at Site 3. Three operators (Operator 1, 2, and 3) participated in the study at
each site. Two Alere™ i Influenza A & B reagent lots were used in the Reproducibility Study.
The reproducibility panel consisted of seven samples at virus concentrations near the respective LoD
(i.e., Moderate Positive Influenza A, Low Positive Influenza A, High Negative Influenza A,
Moderate Positive Influenza B, Low Positive Influenza B, High Negative Influenza B, and True
Negative). Each sample was prepared using the influenza A and B strains (described above) spiked
into simulated nasal swab matrix, the Universal Transport Medium (UTM). The influenza A strain
used in the reproducibility study was Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (Lot J1215A, inactivated), and
the influenza B strain used in the study was Influenza B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (Lot B1012C,
inactivated). The targeted concentrations for the Moderate Positive (MP) samples were
approximately 2 to 3 X the respective LoD, the targeted concentrations for the Low Positive (LP)
samples were approximately 1 X the respective LoD (C concentration), and the targeted
95
concentrations for the High Negative (HN) samples were less than the respective LoD (C
5
11

--- Page 12 ---
concentration). The True Negative samples contain no influenza virus.
Contrived nasal swab samples were prepared using the influenza A and B strains (described above)
dilutions in UTM to the targeted concentrations. The concentrations of the viral stocks (in
TCID /mL) were determined by standard virologic method prior to inactivation by the venders. The
50
targeted concentration for each dilution (in genome equivalents/mL) was also assessed using
laboratory developed and validated influenza A and influenza B quantitative real-time PCR assays.
Swabs were prepared by coating 10 μl of the virus dilution onto the swab. Swab coating was done by
lightly scratching the swab surface with the pipette tip as the dilution was pipetted to ensure liquid
was absorbed into the swab tip. Once all solution was absorbed, swabs were allowed to dry and
assembled into blinded panels.
Samples in each of the seven categories were tested twice by each of the three operators per study
site, on five distinct days, at three clinical sites, using two lots of reagents (Site-to-Site: 2
tests/day/operator x 3 operators/per site x 5 days x 3 sites = 90 data points for each sample category).
The influenza A and influenza B strains were tested as follows:
· Moderate Positive (MP) influenza A: 1.47 x 104 TCID /Swab (2.38 x 104 genome
50
equivalents/Swab); [Note: 10 μl of 1.47 x 106 TCID /mL (2.38 x 106 genome
50
equivalents/mL) virus dilution coated onto a swab]
· Low Positive (LP) influenza A: 4.91 x 103 TCID /Swab (7.95 x 103 genome
50
equivalents/Swab); [Note: 10 μl of 4.91 x 105 TCID /mL (7.95 x 105 genome
50

· High Negative (HN) influenza A : 6.80 x 102 TCID /Swab (1.10 x 103 genome
50
equivalents/Swab); [Note: 10 μl of 6.80 x 104 TCID /mL (1.10 x 105 genome
50
equivalents/mL) virus dilution coated onto a swab]
· Moderate Positive (MP) influenza B: 5.04 x 101 TCID /Swab (6.00 x 102 genome
50
equivalents/Swab); [Note: 10 μl of 5.04 x 103 TCID /mL (6.00 x 104 genome
50
equivalents/mL) virus dilution coated onto a swab]
· Low Positive (LP) influenza B: 1.68 x 101 TCID /Swab (2.00 x 102 genome
50
equivalents/Swab); [Note: 10 μl of 1.68 x 103 TCID /mL (2.00 x 104 genome
50
equivalents/mL) virus dilution coated onto a swab]
· High Negative (HN) influenza B: 4.20 x 10-1 TCID /Swab (5.00 x 100 genome
50
equivalents/Swab); [Note: 10 μl of 4.20 x 101 TCID /mL (5.00 x 102 genome
50
equivalents/mL) virus dilution coated onto a swab]
· True negative (TN): Negative samples (no virus)
All samples were tested using the Alere™ i Influenza A & B on the Alere™ i instruments, according
to the product instructions. Each operator tested one external positive and one external negative
control swab on each instrument used for the study, on each day of testing prior to performing the
study testing.
Operator 2 at Site 2 generated a single invalid result for the external negative control swab tested on
Day 1 of the Reproducibility Study. The expected negative result was obtained upon repeat testing
per the product instructions. All other external positive and negative control swabs tested in the
Reproducibility Study generated the expected results each day of testing at all three sites.
On Day 1 of the Reproducibility Study, Operator 2 at Site 1 generated a “Flu A Invalid/Flu B
12

--- Page 13 ---
Negative” result for a TN sample, and a “Flu A Invalid/Flu B Invalid” result for a HN influenza B
and a MP influenza B sample. Upon repeat testing per the product instructions, valid expected
results were obtained for all three samples. No other invalid results were obtained. These repeated
test results were included in the Reproducibility Study results presented in Table 3 and Table 4
below.
For the Site-to-Site Reproducibility Study, the overall percent agreement with expected result (i.e.,
negative for TN and HN samples, positive for MP and LP samples) was 100% (90/90, 95% CI,
95.9% - 100%) for the influenza A MP, the influenza A LP, the influenza B MP, and the TN
categories; 92.2% (83/90, 95% CI, 84.8% - 96.2%) for the influenza B LP category; and 70.0%
(63/90, 95% CI, 59.9% - 78.5%) and 90.0% (81/90, 95% CI, 82.1% - 94.6%) for the influenza A HN
and the influenza B HN categories, respectively.

Alere™ i Influenza A & B kits contain Positive and Negative Control Swabs. These swabs monitor
the entire assay. The Alere™ i Influenza A & B Instructions for Use requires testing these control
swabs once with each new shipment received and once for each new operator. Further controls may
be tested in order to conform to local, state and/or federal regulations, accrediting groups, or
laboratory’s standard Quality Control procedures.
During the prospective clinical study, control testing using external positive and negative controls
was performed prior to sample testing each day and on each instrument Alere™ i Influenza A & B
testing was performed, at all eight study sites. A total of 335 external positive controls and 335
external negative controls were tested during the prospective clinical study. Seven external positive

Natural Nasal Swab Matrix and Simulated Nasal Swab Matrix Equivalency
Negative natural clinical nasal swab matrix is difficult to obtain in large volumes to be used as
diluent in various analytical studies and the Reproducibility Study. In order to compensate for the
limited availability of negative natural clinical nasal swab matrix, a simulated nasal swab matrix, the
Universal Transport Medium (UTM), was used as diluent in the Reproducibility Study and in a
number of analytical studies (i.e., Carryover Contamination Study, Swab Type Validation Study,
Reagent Shelf Life Study, Interfering Substances Study, Competitive Interference with Non-
Influenza Respiratory Viruses Study, and Competitive Interference with Influenza Viruses Study).
Limit of Detection Studies (UTM vs. natural clinical nasal swab matrix in UTM were carried out to
demonstrate the equivalency between the natural clinical nasal swab matrix and the simulated nasal
swab matrix.
The anchoring influenza strains used in the LoD studies were Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (Lot
D1002B - inactivated, and Lot G1112B), and Influenza B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (Lot B1012C -
inactivated, and Lot C1320E).
For the LoD study using UTM as the diluent, dilutions of each of the two anchoring influenza strains
(described above) were prepared in UTM. 10 μl of each dilution was dispensed onto a swab, using
the pipette tip to scratch and rub liquid onto the swab tip. The swab sample was then tested per the
product instructions. A total of 20 replicates were tested at the estimated LoD level.
For the LoD study using natural clinical nasal swab matrix in UTM as the diluent, presumed
negative natural clinical nasal swabs were eluted in 3 mL of UTM. Swab eluates were combined and
mixed thoroughly to create a swab eluate pool. Dilutions of each of the two anchoring influenza
strains (described above) were prepared in this swab eluate pool. 10 μl of each dilution was
dispensed onto each swab, using the pipette tip to scratch and rub liquid onto the swab tip. The swab
sample was then tested per the product instructions. A total of 20 replicates were tested at the
estimated LoD level.
The concentrations of the viral stocks (in TCID /mL) were determined by standard virologic
50
method by the venders and confirmed by the sponsor (except for the inactivated virus lots, where the
TCID /mL values were determined by standard virologic method by the venders prior to
50
inactivation). The concentration for each dilution (in genome equivalents/mL) was also assessed
using laboratory developed and validated influenza A and influenza B quantitative real-time PCR
assays.
The estimated LoD concentration (defined as the lowest concentration at which
≥ 95% of all replicates tested positive), presented in both calculated TCID /reaction and genome
50
equivalents/reaction, per virus strain tested, is presented in Table 7 below.

This analysis demonstrated that the Alere™ i Influenza A & B assay LoDs using simulated nasal
swab matrix (i.e., UTM) are similar to those using natural nasal swab matrix. Therefore, the
simulated nasal swab matrix is appropriate and adequate to be used in place of natural nasal swab
matrix for the analytical studies, including the Reproducibility Study.
Specimen Stability Study
To provide data supporting the specimen storage recommendations stated in the product package
insert, an analytical study was carried out to evaluate specimen stability.
Dilutions of Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (Lot D1002B, inactivated) and Influenza
B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (Lot B1012C, inactivated) were used in this study to prepare contrived
samples for testing. The concentrations of the viral stocks (in TCID /mL) were determined by
50
standard virologic method prior to inactivation by the venders. The targeted concentration for each
dilution (in genome equivalents/mL) was also assessed using laboratory developed and validated
influenza A and influenza B quantitative real-time PCR assays.
Contrived positive nasal swab samples were prepared using the influenza A and B strains (described
above) dilutions in saline with targeted concentrations near the respective LoD levels (approximately
2 to 3 X the respective LoD). Mock negative nasal swab samples were prepared using saline. Swabs
were prepared by coating 10 μl of the virus dilution or saline onto the swab. Swab coating was done
by lightly scratching the swab surface with the pipette tip as the dilution was pipetted to ensure
liquid was absorbed into the swab tip. All prepared swabs were tested in triplicates at each of the
following three time points/conditions: Time 0, Hour 3 (after being stored at approximately18-22°C
for 3 hours), and Hour 25 (after being stored at approximately 18-22°C for 3 hours , and then placed
at 2-8°C for 22 hours of storage).
The contrived influenza A and influenza B positive swabs were tested at each time point as follows:
· Contrived influenza A swab: 3.30 x 103 TCID /Swab (2.00 x 104 genome equivalents/Swab);
50
[Note: 10 μl of 3.30 x 105 TCID /mL (2.00 x 106 genome equivalents/mL) virus dilution
50
coated onto a swab]
· Contrived influenza B swab: 4.20 x 101 TCID /Swab (5.00 x 102 genome equivalents/Swab);
50
[Note: 10 μl of 4.20 x 103 TCID /mL (5.00 x 104 genome equivalents/mL) virus dilution

This analytical study data supports Alere™ i Influenza A & B product insert sample storage
recommendations for direct nasal swab samples of up to 3 hours at 18-22°C, or at 2-8°C for up to 25
hours (22 hours at 2-8°C and 3 hours at 18-22°C). This analytical study data also supports Alere™ i
Influenza A & B product insert sample storage recommendations for nasal swab of up to 2 hours at
18-22°C, or at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours.

Product Shelf Life Determination
Alere™ i Influenza A & B Assay Components Stability
A product stability study was conducted (and currently on-going) to generate real-time stability data
to support the expiry dating assigned to Alere™ i Influenza A & B Kit.
Two lots of Alere™ i Influenza A & B were included in this stability study. All test components
(Sample Receiver, Test Base, and Transfer Cartridge) were placed at room temperature (28-32°C),
2-8°C and “Customer Storage Condition” (i.e., Test Base at 2-8°C, Sample Receiver and Transfer
Cartridge at 28-32°C), and held at these controlled temperatures for the duration of the stability
study.
Dilutions of Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (Lot D1002B, inactivated) and Influenza
B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (Lot B1012C, inactivated, and A1012A) were used in this study to prepare
contrived positive samples for testing. The concentrations of the viral stocks (in TCID /mL) were
50
determined by standard virologic method prior to inactivation by the venders. The targeted
concentration for each dilution (in genome equivalents/mL) was also assessed using laboratory
developed and validated influenza A and influenza B quantitative real-time PCR assays. Elution
buffer, Alere™ i Influenza A & B Negative Control Swab (polyester swab hand coated with
approximately 1x107 Streptococcus dysgalactiae (ATCC 12388) organisms), and presumed negative
natural nasal swabs (collected from asymptomatic donors) were tested as negative samples in this
study.
Contrived positive nasal swab samples were prepared using the influenza A and B strains (described
above) diluted in UTM with targeted concentrations near the respective LoD levels. 50 μl of each
dilution was added to the Sample Receiver and pipetted up and down to mix. The contrived
influenza A and influenza B positive samples were tested in triplicates at each specified time point
for each stability condition as follows:
· Contrived influenza A #1 (tested at Time 0, Month 4, Month 7, Month 10, and Month 13):
3.30 x 103 TCID (2.00 x 104 genome equivalents) in the Sample Receiver; [Note: 50 μl of

· Contrived influenza B #2C (tested at Month 13): 8.40 x 101 TCID (1.00 x 103 genome
50
equivalents) in the Sample Receiver; [Note: 50 μl of 1.68 x 103 TCID /mL (2.00 x 104
50
genome equivalents/mL) virus dilution added to the Sample Receiver]
To perform testing of the Elution Buffer, no sample was added to the Sample Receiver. The Elution
Buffer contained in the Sample Receiver was transferred to the Test Base using the Transfer
Cartridge when prompted by the instrument according to the product instructions. For testing the
Alere™ i Influenza A & B Negative Control Swabs and the presumed negative natural nasal swabs,
the swabs were tested according to the product instructions.
The Elution Buffer and the Alere™ i Influenza A & B Negative Control Swab sample were tested in
triplicates at Time 0, Month 3, Month 4, Month 7, Month10, and Month13, for each stability
condition. A total of 20 presumed negative natural nasal swabs were tested at Time 0, Month 8, and
Month13, for each stability condition.
The Alere™ i Influenza A & B assay components were considered “stable” as long as they
continued to produce the expected influenza A and B positive results for the positive A & B samples
and expected negative results for the Elution Buffer, the Alere™ i Influenza A & B Negative Control
Swabs, and the presumed negative natural nasal swabs.
The stability study at 2- 8°C and at the “Customer Storage Condition” (i.e., Test Base at 2-8°C,
Sample Receiver and Transfer Cartridge at 28-32°C) is currently ongoing, and available real-time
data supports a shelf life of up to 12 months at 2- 8°C and at the “Customer Storage Condition”. The
stability study for the entire kit at room temperature (28-32°C) was discontinued after four months
due to test results not meeting the acceptance criteria. No stability claim for the entire kit at room
temperature (28-32°C) can be supported by real-time data.
Alere™ i Influenza A & B External Positive and Negative Control Swabs Stability
The Alere™ i Influenza A & B Positive Control Swab is the same swab control currently used in the FDA
®
cleared BinaxNOW Influenza A & B test kit. The Alere™ i Influenza A & B Negative Control Swab is the
®
same swab control currently used in the FDA cleared BinaxNOW Strep A test kit. An analytical study was
carried out to confirm the stability claim for the Alere™ i Influenza A & B Positive Control and Negative
Control Swab, expiry dating of 2 years when stored at room temperature (approximately 18-22°C), which
®
was established based on real-time stability testing data in the context of the FDA cleared BinaxNOW
Influenza A & B test kit and the BinaxNOW
®
Strep A test kit.
For the Alere™ i Influenza A & B Positive Control Swab, 20 Positive Control swabs were tested 25 months
postdate of manufacture (i.e., 1 month post expiry) according to the product instructions. Expected Influenza
A and B dual positive results were obtained for all 20 Positive Control swabs tested.
For the Alere™ i Influenza A & B Positive Control Swab, 20 Negative Control swabs were tested 16 months
postdate of manufacture according to the product instructions. Expected Influenza A and B negative results
were obtained for all 20 Negative Control swabs tested.
This part of the study is on-going and 20 Negative Control swabs will be tested again at expiry (i.e.,
December 2014).

To assess the compatibility of various swabs to be used with the Alere™ i Influenza A & B, an
analytical study was conducted testing the following swabs:
Puritan PurFlock® Ultra flocked swab (standard tip), Puritan PurFlock® Ultra flocked swab (mini
tip), Puritan PurFlock® Ultra flocked swab (large tip), HydraFlock® Flocked swab (standard tip),
Foam swabs, Polyester swabs, Rayon swabs, Puritan Calcium Alginate swabs, and Copan Regular
Flocked swabs.
Dilutions of Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (Lot D1002B, inactivated) and Influenza
B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (Lot B1012C, inactivated) were used in this study to prepare contrived swab
samples for testing. The concentrations of the viral stocks (in TCID /mL) were determined by
50
standard virologic method prior to inactivation by the venders. The targeted concentration for each
dilution (in genome equivalents/mL) was also assessed using laboratory developed and validated
influenza A and influenza B quantitative real-time PCR assays.
Contrived positive nasal swab samples for each swab type were prepared using the influenza A and
B strains (described above) dilutions in UTM with targeted concentrations near the respective LoD
levels (approximately 2 to 3 X the respective LoD). Mock negative nasal swab samples for each
swab type were prepared using UTM. Swabs were prepared by coating 10 μl of the virus dilution or
UTM onto the swab. Swab coating was done by lightly scratching the swab surface with the pipette
tip as the dilution was pipetted to ensure liquid was absorbed into the swab tip. All prepared swabs
were tested in triplicates according to the product instructions for testing direct swabs.
The influenza A and influenza B positive swab samples with concentration approximately 2 to 3 X
times the respective LoD were tested for each swab type as follows:
· Contrived influenza A swab: 3.30 x 103 TCID /Swab (2.00 x 104 genome equivalents/Swab);
50
[Note: 10 μl of 3.30 x 105 TCID /mL (2.00 x 106 genome equivalents/mL) virus dilution

· Contrived influenza B swab: 4.20 x 101 TCID /Swab (5.00 x 102 genome equivalents/Swab);
50
[Note: 10 μl of 4.20 x 103 TCID /mL (5.00 x 104 genome equivalents/mL) virus dilution

A swab type was considered to be compatible for use with the Alere™ i Influenza A & B assay if
expected results for positive and negative samples were achieved for all replicates tested.
Of the nine swab types evaluated in this study, all three Puritan PurFlock® Ultra swab types (with
standard, mini, or large tips) and the Calcium Alginate swabs were found to be not compatible or
appropriate for use with Alere™ i Influenza A & B. The following statement is included in the
“Sample Collection and Handling” section of the Product Insert: “Calcium Alginate and Puritan
Purflock® Ultra flocked swabs are not suitable for use in this assay.”
The other five swab types evaluated in this study, HydraFlock® Flocked swab (standard tip), Foam
swabs, Polyester swabs, Rayon swabs, and Copan Regular Flocked swabs were found to be
compatible for use with Alere™ i Influenza A & B. The following statements have been added to the
“Sample Collection and Handling” section of the Product Insert: “For optimal performance, use the
swabs provided in the test kit. Alternatively, rayon, foam, HydraFlock® Flocked Swab (standard tip),
Copan Regular Flocked Swab or polyester nasal swabs can be used to collect nasal swab samples.”

LoD Study – With Natural Clinical Matrix
An analytical study was carried out to determine the LoD for each Alere™ i Influenza A &
B assay targeted influenza viruses in natural nasal swab matrix. Three strains of influenza A
virus representing each of the three common currently or recently circulating influenza A
subtypes (i.e., A/H1N1, A/H3N2 seasonal, and A/H1N1 pandemic (pdm)) and two strains
of influenza B virus representing each of the two influenza B genetic lineages (i.e., Victoria
and Yamagata) were included in this study.
Presumed negative nasal swab specimens were eluted in 3 mL of UTM. Swab elutes were combined
and mixed thoroughly by gentle vortex to create a clinical matrix pool, and this clinical matrix pool
was used as the diluent throughout this study. Vender provided stocks of Influenza A/Puerto
Rico/8/34 (A/H1N1, Lot G1112B), A/Perth/16/2009 (A/H3N2, Lot A1121B), A/California/7/2009
(A/H1N1 pdm, Lot E1020A1), Influenza B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (Victoria lineage, Lot C1320E), and
B/Bangladesh/3333/2007 (Yamagata lineage, Lot H1012A) were diluted in the natural clinical nasal
swab matrix pool as described previously to generate virus dilutions for testing. The vender provided
virus strains were re-titered and the concentrations (in TCID /mL) were determined by standard
50
virologic method. The concentration for each dilution (in genome equivalents/mL) was also assessed
using laboratory developed and validated influenza A and influenza B quantitative real-time PCR
assays.
Contrived swab specimens were prepared by coating 10 μl of virus dilution onto each swab. Swab
coating was carried out by lightly scratching the swab surface with the pipette tip as virus dilution
was pipetted to ensure liquid was absorbed into the swab tip. The contrived swab samples were
tested according to the product instructions for testing direct swabs.
A range finding experiment was conducted initially testing triplicates per dilution per strain. If 100%
positive results were obtained with the starting dilution, a series of 2-fold dilutions beginning with
the dilution that produced 100% positive results were prepared and tested in triplicates until a
negative result was obtained. 20 replicates of the lowest 2-fold dilution that produced 100% (3/3)
positive results were then tested for the confirmation of the estimated limit of detection (LoD). If
≥95% positive results were achieved, the level was reported as the confirmed LoD. If <95% positive
results were obtained, 20 replicates of the next 2-fold dilution up from the dilution that produced a
<95% positive results were tested.
The confirmed LoD in natural nasal swab matrix, defined as the lowest virus level that was detected
≥95% of the time (i.e., virus level at which at least 19 out of 20 replicates tested positive), for each
influenza strain tested, were presented in Table 9 below:

LoD Study – With Simulated Matrix
An additional analytical study was also carried out to determine the LoD for each Alere™ i
Influenza A & B assay targeted influenza viruses in simulated nasal swab matrix, UTM. Two
strains of influenza A virus (A/H1N1) and two strains of influenza B virus were included in this
study.
Vender provided stocks of Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (A/H1N1, Lot D1002B, inactivated),
A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (A/H1N1, Lot G0931A1), Influenza B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (Victoria
lineage, Lot B1012C, inactivated), and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria lineage, Lot D1029C1) were
diluted in UTM to generate virus dilutions for testing.
The concentrations of the viral stocks (in TCID /mL) for A/Puerto Rico/8/34 and
50
B/Malaysia/2506/2004 were determined by standard virologic method prior to inactivation by the
vender. For B/Brisbane/60/2008, the vender provided virus strain was re-titered and the
concentration (in TCID /mL) was determined by standard virologic method. For A/Solomon
50
Islands/3/2006, the vender provided concentration (in TCID /mL) was not confirmed by re-titering
50
due to unavailability of residual viral stock. The concentration for each dilution (in genome
equivalents/mL) was also assessed using laboratory developed and validated influenza A and
influenza B quantitative real-time PCR assays.
Contrived swab specimens were prepared by coating 10 μl of virus dilution onto each swab. Swab
coating was carried out by lightly scratching the swab surface with the pipette tip as virus dilution
was pipetted to ensure liquid was absorbed into the swab tip. The contrived swab samples were
tested according to the product instructions for testing direct swabs.
A range finding experiment was conducted initially testing triplicates per dilution per strain. If 100%
positive results were obtained with the starting dilution, a series of 2-fold dilutions beginning with
the dilution that produced 100% positive results were prepared and tested in triplicates until a
negative result was obtained. 20 replicates of the lowest 2-fold dilution that produced 100% (3/3)
positive results were then tested for the confirmation of the estimated limit of detection (LoD). If
≥95% positive results were achieved, the level was reported as the confirmed LoD. If <95% positive
results were obtained, 20 replicates of the next 2-fold dilution up from the dilution that produced a
<95% positive results were tested.
The confirmed LoD in simulated nasal swab matrix (UTM), defined as the lowest virus level that
was detected ≥95% of the time (i.e., virus level at which at least 19 out of 20 replicates tested
positive), for each influenza strain tested, were presented in Table 10 below:

Analytical Reactivity Testing
An analytical reactivity (inclusivity) study was performed to determine whether the Alere™ i
Influenza A & B assay is able to detect a variety of influenza A and B strains that represent temporal
and geographic diversity.
Vender provided stocks of influenza A and B strains were diluted in UTM to generate virus dilutions
for testing. The concentration (in TCID /mL, CEID /mL or EID /mL) for each was determined by
50 50 50
standard virologic method. The concentration for each dilution (in genome equivalents/mL) was also
assessed using laboratory developed and validated influenza A and influenza B quantitative real-time
PCR assays.
Contrived swab specimens were prepared by coating 10 μl of virus dilution onto each swab. Swab
coating was carried out by lightly scratching the swab surface with the pipette tip as virus dilution
was pipetted to ensure liquid was absorbed into the swab tip. The contrived swab samples were
tested according to the product instructions.
The starting dilution concentration selected for testing in this study was higher than the established
LoDs in the Limit of Detection studies. Each starting dilution per strain was tested in triplicates
initially. If the initial testing concentration tested positive for all three replicates, the strain was
further diluted 10-fold and tested in triplicates until at least one out three replicates generated a
negative result. When a negative result was obtained, additional 2-fold dilutions were tested, starting
from the highest dilution that produced 100% (3/3) positive results. A concentration level was
considered “reactive/positive” in this study for all but one strain tested (i.e., B/Texas/06/2011 – see
footnote C under Table 11 below) if all three replicates generated a positive result for the expected
influenza virus. A concentration level was considered “non-reactive/negative” for all but one strain
tested (i.e., B/Texas/06/2011 – see footnote C under Table 11 below) in this study if at least one out
of the three replicates generated a negative result for the expected influenza virus.
The Alere™ i Influenza A & B assay was evaluated with 17 Influenza A and nine Influenza B
strains. Influenza A strains included four pre-2009 pandemic seasonal A/H1N1 strains, eight
seasonal H3N2 strains, three 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic strains, one A/H3N2v strain, and one avian
influenza A/H7N9 virus (detected in China in 2013). Influenza B strains included four Victoria
lineage strains and five Yamagata lineage strains. The Alere™ i Influenza A & B assay detected all
strains tested at the concentrations indicated in Table 11 below:

a Although this test has been shown to detect A/H1N1 (pre-2009 pandemic), A/H7N9 (detected in China in 2013) and A/H3N2v viruses cultured
from positive human respiratory specimens, the performance characteristics of this device with clinical specimens that are positive for the A/H1N1
(pre-2009 pandemic), A/H7N9 (detected in China in 2013) and A/H3N2v viruses have not been established.
b Influenza A/Texas/50/2012 lowest level in which 3/3 replicates were positive is approximately 0.01 to 0.06 x the LoD (as comparing to the Genome
Equivalents/Swab values generated in the LoD with simulated matrix study testing A/Puerto Rico/8/34 and A/Solomon Islands/3/2006, respectively).
Based on in silico analysis, no polymorphism within the target sequence was reveled that can account for the observed increased reactivity. A
plausible cause for the observation of increased reactivity is the impact that polymorphisms found outside of the target region can have on
amplification and detection. Influenza virus mutates at a very high frequency, and as a result conservation across the entirety of the Influenza genome
is very limited. The Influenza genome is RNA, and RNA readily folds into complex secondary and tertiary structures based on the primary sequence
of the nucleic acid. Polymorphisms introduced into the primary structure can result in changes in secondary/tertiary structure, potentially making
specific regions more or less accessible to nucleic acid binding moieties. The Alere™ i Influenza A & B test requires access to the target nucleic acid
sequence in order to initiate amplification and detection, therefore it is plausible that specific changes to the genome’s primary structure
(polymorphisms) may result in secondary/tertiary structural changes that could potentially increase (more accessible to nucleic acid binding moieties)
or decrease (less accessible to nucleic acid binding moieties) the test’s analytical reactivity.
c Influenza B/Russia/69 lowest level in which 3/3 replicates were positive is approximately 40 to 150 x the LoD (as comparing to the Genome
Equivalents/Swab values generated in the LoD with simulated clinical matrix study testing B/Malaysia/2506/2004 and B/Brisbane/60/2008,
respectively). A polymorphism within segment PA of the Influenza B genome was identified at a position which is 4 nucleotides from the 3’-end of
template 2. This G to A polymorphism results in a G/C (product/template) match to an A/C (product/template) mismatch. An A/C mismatch is
determined to be moderately destabilizing, and coupled to its position only 4 nucleotides from the 3’-end of the template 2 recognition region, its
impact on annealing is potentially great. The frequency of this G to A polymorphism is determined to be very low. In analyzing the strains present in
the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource database from 2/2005 to 3/2014 (N=986), no strains contained this polymorphism, suggesting that it has not been
circulating for an extended period of time.
d Influenza B/Wisconsin/01/2010 lowest level in which 3/3 replicates were positive is approximately 15 to 60 x the LoD, and Influenza
B/Texas/06/2011 lowest level in which at least 1/3 replicates were positive is approximately 25 to 100 x the LoD (as comparing to the Genome
Equivalents/Swab values generated in the LoD with simulated clinical matrix study testing B/Malaysia/2506/2004 and B/Brisbane/60/2008,
respectively). A single G to A polymorphism within segment PA of the Influenza B genome was identified at a position which is 5 nucleotides from
the 3’-end of the molecular beacon annealing region in both strains. The G to A polymorphism results in a C/G match to a C/A mismatch between the
molecular beacon and product 1. The C/A mismatch is determined to be moderately destabilizing that can significantly reduce assay sensitivity. An
assessment of what impact this polymorphism would have on the melting temperature (Tm) of the molecular beacon/product 1 annealing was
performed and the results showed a Tm drop from 62.3°C to 55.6°C, just below the assay running temperature. This suggests that annealing would
occur, but at a greatly reduced level, with a concomitant loss of assay sensitivity. The frequency of this G to A polymorphism is found at a frequency
of approximately 5% within the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource database covering the time frame from 2/2005 through 3/2014.

Supplemental Reactivity Information for Influenza Strains of Human, Swine and Avian Origin (in
silico analysis):
In addition to laboratory testing, bioinformatics resources were also used to predict reactivity of
additional influenza A strains of human, swine, or avian origin with the Alere™ i Influenza A & B.
Predicted reactivity of the Alere™ i Influenza A&B assay with additional influenza A strains of
human, avian, and swine origin was generated using a bioinformatics approach. Assay template and
probe sequences were aligned with GenBank sequences corresponding to the appropriate gene
targets and reactivity were predicated based on the number and location of mismatches in the
targeted region. For each subtype, multiple GenBank IDs were evaluated, corresponding to the gene
segments targeted by the Alere™ i Influenza A&B assay (PB2 gene for Flu A and PA gene for Flu
B). The strains listed in Table 12 below are predicted to react with the Alere™ i Influenza A&B
assay as indicated:

f. Analytical Specificity:
The Alere™ i Influenza A & B was performed on samples containing high levels of non-target
organisms using the Alere™ i instrument, to demonstrate the specificity of the assay for detection of
influenza A and B. The analytical specificity study testing included 37 bacteria, 15 viruses and 1
yeast common to the nasal cavity/nasopharynx. All bacterial stocks and the yeast stock were
obtained from ATCC, with the exception of Chlamydia pneumoniae (obtained from the University
of Washington). All viral stocks were obtained from ATCC, with the exception of human
metapneumovirus (obtained from the Zeptometrix Corporation).
The majority of the bacteria and yeast were re-grown by Alere Scarborough, Inc. using standard
microbiological culture techniques, reconstituted into saline dilution buffer and then quantified by
spectrophotometer (cells/ml) versus a saline dilution buffer blank. The Mycoplasma pneumoniae
received from the vendor was resuspended by Alere Scarborough, Inc. per vendor instructions and
tested. Re-growth did not yield enough for harvesting and reconstitution in saline. The Chlamydia
pneumonia was supplied by the University of Washington as an irradiated stock and it was,
therefore, not re-grown and titered by Alere Scarborough, Inc. prior to testing. The titers of the
quantified viruses indicated on certificates of analysis from vendors were not confirmed by Alere
Scarborough, Inc. prior to testing.
Swab samples were prepared using the bacterial, viral and yeast strains at the stock concentration
indicated in Table 13 below. 75 μl of each organism was dispensed into each of three 1.5 ml tubes. A
swab was placed into each tube and stirred to absorb all the liquid into the swab head. The samples
were tested in triplicate in Alere™ i Influenza A & B, according to product instructions for testing
direct swabs.

None of the bacteria, yeast, or viruses tested cross-reacted in the Alere™ i Influenza A & B at these
concentrations.
g. Potentially Interfering Substances:
An analytical study was performed to assess the potential interference effects of 25 substances
naturally present in respiratory specimens or that may be artificially introduced into the nasal
cavity/nasopharynx.
Dilutions of Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (Lot D1002B, inactivated), Influenza A/Solomon
Islands/3/2006 (Lot D1326A), Influenza B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (Lot B1012C, inactivated), and
Influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Lot D1326B) were used in this study to prepare contrived positive
samples for testing. The concentrations of the viral stocks (in TCID /mL) were determined by
50
standard virologic method. The targeted concentration for each dilution (in genome equivalents/mL)
was also assessed using laboratory developed and validated influenza A and influenza B quantitative
real-time PCR assays.
Using UTM as the diluent, positive samples were prepared using the influenza A and B strains
(described above) diluted to a concentration approximately 2 to 3 times the respective limit of
detection (LoD) levels and the various interfering substances at the concentrations specified in Table
14 below. (Note: During preparation of the B/Brisbane/60/2008 dilution a calculation error was
made. This strain was inadvertently diluted to a concentration approximately 5 to 10 times the LoD
level.) Each influenza strain, combined with each interfering substance, was evaluated separately.
Negative samples were prepared using UTM and the various interfering substances at the
concentrations specified in Table 10 below.
50 μl of each positive and negative sample with interfering substance was added to the Sample
Receiver and pipetted up and down to mix. Each sample was tested in triplicates per the product
instructions.
The influenza A and influenza B positive samples were tested as follows:
· Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34: 3.30 x 103 TCID (2.00 x 104 genome equivalents) in the
50
Sample Receiver; [Note: 50 μl of 6.59 x 104 TCID /mL (4.00 x 105 genome equivalents/mL) virus
50
dilution contain an interfering substance added to the Sample Receiver]
· Influenza A/Solomon Islands/3/2006: 4.10 x 102 TCID (2.80 x 103 genome equivalents) in
50
the Sample Receiver; [Note: 50 μl of 8.19 x 103 TCID /mL (5.60 x 104 genome
50
equivalents/mL) virus dilution contain an interfering substance added to the Sample Receiver]
· Influenza B/Malaysia/2506/2004: 2.70 x 101 TCID (5.00 x 102 genome equivalents) in the
50
Sample Receiver; [Note: 50 μl of 8.40 x 102 TCID /mL (1.00 x 104 genome equivalents/mL) virus
50
dilution contain an interfering substance added to the Sample Receiver]
· Influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008: 7.50 x 101 TCID (4.06 x 103 genome equivalents) in the
50
Sample Receiver; [Note: 50 μl of 1.50 x 103 TCID /mL (8.12 x 104 genome equivalents/mL) virus
50
dilution contain an interfering substance added to the Sample Receiver]
The Interfering Substances Study Results are presented in Table 14 below.

None of the 25 potential interference substances tested produced false positive or false negative test
results in Alere™ i Influenza A & B at the concentrations specified.
One important substance, FluMistTM was not tested in this study. The following statements have
been added to the “Limitations” section of the Product Insert: “Potential interference effects from
FluMistTM have not been evaluated. Individuals who have received nasally administered influenza
vaccine reportedly may test positive in commercially available influenza diagnostic tests for up to
three days after vaccination.”

Low Loads of Influenza A or Influenza B Co-Spiked with Selected Non-influenza Respiratory
Viruses
An analytical study was performed to assess any potential interference of high concentrations of
selected non-influenza respiratory viruses when co-spiked with low loads of influenza A or influenza
B.
The non-influenza respiratory viral stocks used in this study are listed in Table 15 below.

Dilutions of Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (Lot D1002B, inactivated) and Influenza
B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (Lot A1012A) were used in this study to prepare contrived positive swab
samples for testing. The concentrations of the viral stocks (in TCID /mL) were determined by
50
standard virologic method. The targeted concentration for each dilution (in genome equivalents/mL)
was also assessed using laboratory developed and validated influenza A and influenza B quantitative
real-time PCR assays.
Using UTM as the diluent, positive samples were prepared using the influenza A and B strains
(described above) diluted to a concentration approximately 2 to 3 times the respective limit of
detection (LoD) levels. Swabs were prepared by coating 10 μl of the virus dilution onto the swab.

Swab coating was done by lightly scratching the swab surface with the pipette tip as the solution was
pipetted to ensure liquid was absorbed into the swab tip.
The contrived influenza A and influenza B positive swabs were prepared as follows:
· Contrived influenza A swab: 3.30 x 103 TCID /Swab (2.00 x 104 genome equivalents/Swab);
50
[Note: 10 μl of 3.30 x 105 TCID /mL (2.00 x 106 genome equivalents/mL) virus dilution

For each of the three non-influenza respiratory viruses, 75 μl of each viral stock (described in Table
15 above) was dispensed into each of six 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. One contrived influenza A or
influenza B swab (prepared as described above) was placed into each tube. Swabs were stirred to
absorb all of the liquid into the swab head. A total of three mock co-infection swabs per non-
influenza virus were prepared using the influenza A or influenza B contrived positive swabs. The
mock co-infection swabs were tested immediately according to the product instructions. Three
contrived influenza A positive swabs and three contrived influenza B swabs without co-infection
were also tested as positive experimental controls.

To prepare the co-infection swabs, 10 μl of influenza A virus dilution (1.65 x 106 TCID /mL or 1.00
50
x 107 genome equivalents/mL) was added to the contrived influenza B positive swabs prepared
above by lightly scratching the swab surface with the pipette tip as the solution was pipetted to
ensure liquid was absorbed into the swab tip (1.65 x 104 TCID /swab or 1.00 x 105 influenza A
50

50
2.00 x 106 genome equivalents/mL) was added to the contrived influenza A positive swabs prepared
above using the same method (1.59 x 103 TCID /swab or 2.00 x 104 influenza B genome

i. Carry-Over Study:
A study was conducted to evaluate the risk of carry-over contamination with the Alere™ i
Influenza A & B assay on the Alere™ i instrument.
Dilutions of Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (Lot D1002B, inactivated) and Influenza
B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (Lot B1012C, inactivated) were used in this study to prepare contrived
samples for testing. The concentrations of the viral stocks (in TCID /mL) were determined by
50
standard virologic method prior to inactivation by the venders. The targeted concentration for each
dilution (in genome equivalents/mL) was also assessed using laboratory developed and validated
influenza A and influenza B quantitative real-time PCR assays.
Contrived positive nasal swab samples were prepared using the influenza A and B strains (described
above) dilutions in UTM with targeted concentrations of a minimum of 106 TCID /mL. Mock
50
negative nasal swab samples were prepared using UTM. Swabs were prepared by coating 10 μl of
the virus dilutions or UTM onto the swab. Swab coating was done by lightly scratching the swab
surface with the pipette tip as the dilution was pipetted to ensure liquid was absorbed into the swab
tip. Alere™ i Influenza A & B Negative Control swabs were tested as negative swab samples.
The contrived influenza A and influenza B positive swabs were tested as follows:
· Contrived influenza A and B positive swab:
o For Flu A: 1.00 x 105 TCID /Swab (6.07 x 105 genome equivalents/Swab); [Note: 10 μl of
50
1.00 x 107 TCID /mL (6.07 x 107 genome equivalents/mL) virus dilution coated onto a
50
swab]
o For Flu B: 1.00 x 104 TCID /Swab (1.19 x 105 genome equivalents/Swab); [Note: 10 μl of
50
1.00 x 106 TCID /mL (1.19 x 107 genome equivalents/mL) virus dilution coated onto a
50
swab]
Positive and negative swab samples were tested per the product instructions. Testing between
positive and negative samples alternated for a total of 15 rounds (15 positives and 15 negatives) on
one Alere™ i instrument.
The Carry-over Study results are presented in Table 18 below.

No carry-over/contamination event was observed in this study. This data demonstrated that there
is low risk of carryover/contamination when testing positive and negative samples on the Alere™
i instrument when the product insert instructions are followed.
j. Assay cut-off:
Alere™ i Influenza A & B consists of three sets of fluorescence response curves for Flu A, Flu B,
and IC. The response curves are analyzed within a decision algorithm to form a channel result. There
35

[Table 1 on page 35]
Sample	# Tested		Influenza A and B Positive Sample						Influenza A and B Negative Sample

Direct Nasal Swab	15	+			+			-			-		

--- Page 36 ---
are nine critical parameters (Table 19 below) associated with each channel in the decision algorithm.
Most important among these parameters is the gradient threshold (parameter – GradThreshold). For
each response curve, the gradient values within the threshold window (parameter –
ThresholdWindow) are compared to the gradient threshold (parameter – GradThreshold) and the
results of this comparison are what ultimately determine the channel result, “Asserted” or “Not
Asserted”. In addition, if the calculated NormAve in a NormWindow is not between NormAveMax
and NormAveMin, the channel result is “Indeterminate”.
The values of the nine parameters used within the channel decision algorithm are listed in Table 19
below.
Table 19: Channel Decision Algorithm Parameter Values
Parameter Name Value
NormWindow (s) 40 – 110 (measurement blocks 5 – 12)
ThresholdWindow (s) 120 – End of acquisition (measurement blocks 13 – 58)
GradWindow 5 consecutive data points (50s, 5 measurement blocks)
NormAveMin (mV) Flu A: 1, Flu B: 1, IC: 1
NormAveMax (mV) Flu A:1200, Flu B: 1200, IC: 1200
GradThreshold (mV/s) Flu A: 1.5, Flu B: 1.5, IC: 1.5
GradPlateau (mV/s) 0.2
GradCount 3
AmpMAx (mV) 4000
The gradient thresholds (parameter – GradThreshold) (cut-offs) in the channel decision algorithm
were derived through analysis of clinical testing data (20 Flu A positives and 105 Flu A negatives
for the Flu A GradThreshold ; 9 Flu B positives and 117 Flu B negatives for the Flu B
GradThreshold ) collected during the 2011-2012 respiratory season. The gradients of the true
positive and true negative clinical samples (as determined by viral culture and confirmed by PCR
when there are discrepancies) were analyzed.
These thresholds were subsequently verified during the prospective clinical study conducted during
the 2012-2013 respiratory season.

presenting at the participating study centers with flu-like symptoms. Direct nasal swab specimens
(without elution in VTM) from patients with flu-like symptoms were collected and tested using the
Alere™ i Influenza A & B at the eight study sites. Viral culture performed according to standard
virology culture procedures, was utilized as the reference method for this study.
Two nasal swabs were collected from one nostril from each subject using standard collection
methods. At all sites, one nasal swab was tested directly on Alere™ i Influenza A & B, according to
product instructions, without prior elution in VTM. The other nasal swab was eluted in 3-mLof viral
transport media (VTM). Six of the eight sites (Site 1, Site 4, Site 8, Site 10, Site 11, and Site 12)
shipped nasal swab samples in VTM to a central testing laboratory for viral culture testing. This
central testing laboratory was located at Site 1, which also participated as a sample collection and
Alere™ i Influenza A & B testing site. The nasal swab samples in VTM from Site 2 and Site 9 were
cultured on site by a local laboratory.
External control testing, using Alere™ i Influenza A & B Positive and Negative Controls, was
performed prior to sample testing each day and on each Alere™ i instrument the testing was
performed, at all study sites.
All specimens generating discrepant Alere™ i Influenza A & B and viral culture results were
investigated by testing using an FDA cleared Influenza RT-PCR assay at a central testing laboratory
located at Site 1.
Performance - Direct Nasal Swab (Without Elution in VTM)
A total of 612 nasal swab specimens were enrolled in this study. Of those, 27 direct nasal swab
specimens did not meet eligibility criteria (i.e., five samples failed to meet inclusion/exclusion
criteria, eight samples were not transported to the viral culture testing laboratory per the conditions
required by the clinical study protocol, two samples for which site did not perform external QC
controls testing before sample testing, nine samples were observed with blood, and three samples
had indeterminate viral culture results). A total of 585 direct nasal swab specimens were considered
evaluable. Patient age and gender distribution for the 585 specimens is presented in Table 20 below.

Of the evaluable 585 specimens, the Alere™ i Influenza A & B generated influenza A invalid results
for 14 specimens and influenza B invalid results for 16 specimens, resulting in a total of 571
specimens for influenza A performance analysis and 569 specimens for influenza B performance
analysis.
Compared to the viral culture reference method, the performance of Alere™ i Influenza A & B for
influenza A and influenza B are presented in Table 21 and Table 22 below, respectively.

The Alere™ i Influenza A & B detected one mixed influenza A and B infections in the prospective
clinical evaluation. This sample tested positive for influenza B only by viral culture, but tested
positive for influenza A only by an FDA cleared Influenza RT-PCR assay. Based on this result,
the following have been added to the “Result Interpretation” section of the Product Insert: “Dual
infections of Flu A and Flu B are rare. Repeat testing using new test components. Contact
Technical Support during normal business hours if multiple samples provide this result.”

N. Instrument Name:
Alere™ i Instrument
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Alere™ i Instrument is a portable bench-top unit designed to perform in laboratory and point-of
care environments. Alere™ i Influenza A & B components are color-coded to match the corresponding
holder on the instrument and designed to only fit in the corresponding holder in one direction. Once
properly placed into the instrument, the Alere™ i Instrument uses image analysis to automatically detect
the presence of the Test Base and to check the test type and expiry date on the barcode present on the
Test Base. This triggers the test sequence. Heating, mixing, and detection by fluorescence are provided
by the instrument. The Alere™ i Instrument is equipped with two optical fluorescence modules, FAM™
and ROX™. Each optical module consists of a LED excitation source and photodiode receiver
configured to the fluorescent channel. Fluorescence signals are optically filtered by a confocal lens and
mirror arrangement and processed by software running on an on-board computer. The results are
calculated automatically and presented on the instrument graphical user interface and available for
export in JSON format or printing.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of
product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Specimen ID is entered using on screen keyboard or barcode scanner.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Not applicable. The specimens are manually inserted in the Sample Receiver in the instrument.
5. Calibration:
The Alere™ i Instrument is factory calibrated and does not require any further calibration and
verification at user site. However, if the instrument was transported or moved, a performance check
using Alere™ i Positive and Negative Controls is recommended to ensure proper functionality by the
manufacture.
6. Quality Control:
Quality control is addressed for each specific FDA-cleared assay to be run on the instrument (separately
cleared).
