3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use, for in vitro diagnostic use
The sponsor included the following boxed warnings in the “Warnings and Precautions”
section of the package insert:
· Dilution of samples will create erroneous results. Samples cannot be diluted at
any Lp-PLA2 activity level. Samples with Lp-PLA2 values above the measuring
range should be reported as >382 nmol/min/mL. In the Clinical Validation Study,
> 99% of subjects reported values ≤ 382 nmol/min/mL.
· Hemolyzed samples interfere with the assay and should not be tested. Samples
that are visibly hemolyzed should be redrawn. Testing hemolyzed samples with
>1.0 mg/mL hemoglobin may cause erroneous results.
· Reversing the positions of the reagents on the analyzer will lead to erroneous
results. Make sure to load the R1 reagent in the right location on the analyzer, R1
position, and the R2 reagent in the instrument’s R2 position.

L. Test Principle:
In the PLAC Test for Lp-PLA Activity, Lp-PLA in plasma or serum, hydrolyzes the sn-2
2 2
position of the substrate, 1-myristoyl-2-(4-nitrophenylsuccinyl) phosphatidylcholine,
producing 4-nitrophenyl succinate. The latter is immediately further hydrolyzed to produce
the colored reaction product, 4-nitrophenol. The rate of formation of 4-nitrophenol is
measured spectrophotometrically at 410 nm and the Lp-PLA activity is calculated from the
2
rate of change in absorbance. A set of five Lp-PLA calibrators is used to generate a standard
2
curve fit of change in absorbance versus Lp-PLA activity level in nmol/min/mL from which
2
the sample Lp-PLA activity is derived.

native plasma samples were spiked with recombinant Lp-PLA to create the high
2
plasma samples and low plasma samples were prepared with animal plasma. Both
were combined for the interval between the two extreme levels. Three sets of
high/low plasma samples combined at 13 levels (total 39 samples) ranging in Lp-
PLA activity from 6 to 382 nmol/min/mL were tested in triplicate (117 test points)
2
using each of 3 lots. Replicate values of each sample were averaged to determine the
mean measured value of the sample. All actual results were plotted and the slope,
intercept, and R2 value were calculated using a least squares weighted regression. The
degree of nonlinearity was assessed by analysis of second and third order polynomial
regression.
Results of the linearity analyses demonstrated that from 6 to 382.2 nmol/min/mL
there was a maximum deviation from linearity of ≤ 7%.
The sponsor claims that the measuring range of the assay is 10 to 382.2
nmol/min/mL.
The sponsor also evaluated the linearity of the device using serum samples.
The results of those studies support the sponsor’s reportable range claim.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators are traceable to internal master calibrators. Purified recombinant Lp-
PLA protein is utilized as the analyte in the proposed calibrators and controls. Kit
2
calibrators are value assigned using the master calibrators and are assayed in multiple
replicates and multiple runs. The grand mean for each kit calibrator is calculated.
The kit calibrators must meet specifications compared to the activity values of the
master calibrators. The value assignment process was reviewed and found
acceptable.
Controls are prepared using purified recombinant Lp-PLA protein. They are value
2
assigned using multiple replicates, multiple runs, multiple calibrations and multiple
days. The grand mean is calculated and must fall within a specified range. The
control range is determined by calculating a ± 15% range from the overall mean. The
resulting lot specific means and ranges for each control are supplied in the certificate
of analysis provided with each kit lot. The value assignment process was reviewed
and found acceptable.
Shelf life and open vial stability protocols for the controls and calibrators were
reviewed and found acceptable. The sponsor claims that the controls and calibrators
are stable for 12 months stored at 2 to 8°C. Once opened, the controls and calibrators
are stable for 3 months when stored at 2 to 8°C.
Sample stability: The sponsor performed studies to demonstrate the stability of
EDTA plasma samples and serum samples prior to centrifugation and after
centrifugation. Based on the results of the studies, the sponsor recommends the
following storage conditions:
6

--- Page 7 ---
Prior to centrifugation samples can be kept up to 4 hours at 20-22°C or up to 30
hours at 2-8°C prior to separation.
Following centrifugation EDTA plasma samples and serum samples can be tested
immediately or stored prior to testing under the following conditions:
· 24 hours at 20-26°C
· Up to 2 weeks at 2-8°C
· Up to 18 months at -20°C
· Up to 2 years at -70°C
Plasma and serum samples can be freeze-thawed up to 5 times after freezing at
either -70°C or -20°C.
Detection limit:
Detection limits were determined using the principles in CLSI EP17-A2 with 3 kit
lots on 1 Beckman Coulter AU400 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer.
The limit of blank (LoB) was estimated using 60 replicates of the 0 level calibrator
run over 3 separate runs for each kit lot. The LoB was calculated by the classical
approach using the nonparametric option described in EP17-A2.
The limit of detection (LoD) was estimated using 5 plasma samples with Lp-PLA
2
activity levels at approximately 0.6 to 3.2 nmol/min/mL. Each sample was tested in 5
replicates over 5 days (n=25 for each sample) using 3 kit lots. The data measurements
for each lot showed relatively consistent variability across the low level samples and
were analyzed by the classical approach using the parametric analysis described in
EP17-A2.
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was estimated using the precision profile approach
described in CLSI EP17-A2. Four native plasma samples were prepared to produce 8
total samples with low Lp-PLA activity levels ranging from 0.6 to 5.9 nmol/min/mL.
2
The samples were tested in 5 replicates over 5 days (n=25 for each sample) using
each of the 3 kit lots. For each kit lot, a relationship was determined between the
%CV and the Lp-PLA activity for the set of low samples using a power function
2
model. For each kit lot, this equation was then used to determine the Lp-PLA activity
2
at which the coefficient of variation (CV) was equal to 20%.
The LoB was estimated to be 0.40 nmol/min/mL.
The LoD was estimated to be 0.74 nmol/min/mL.
The LoQ was estimated to be 1.30 nmol/min/mL.
In the package insert the sponsor claims that the analytical sensitivity (limit of
quantitation) of the assay is 10 nmol/min/mL.
The sponsor also estimated the LoB, LoD and LoQ using serum samples. The results
of these studies support the label claim for the LoQ.

e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interference: CLSI EP7-A2 was used in developing the studies to
determine potential interference from endogenous substances. Testing was performed
using 1 Beckman Coulter AU400 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer and one kit lot with 4
native plasma samples with Lp-PLA activity ranging from 85 to 315 nmol/min/mL.
2
The endogenous substances were titrated into samples with known levels of each
endogenous substance and 5 replicates were tested for each level. The results from
samples spiked with endogenous substances were averaged, compared to matching
control sample results and % recoveries were calculated. Samples spiked with the
following substances at the listed concentrations demonstrated percent recoveries of
90–110% in the measured Lp-PLA activity level, calculated based on the expected
2
(control) value.
Substance Concentration
Albumin 60 g/L
Conjugated Bilirubin 12 mg/dL
Unconjugated Bilirubin 20 mg/dL
Cholesterol 300 mg/dL
Triglycerides 400 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 100 mg/dL (1 mg/mL)
In the package insert the sponsor states that no appreciable interference was
observed for the substances at the concentrations listed in the table above.
In the “Warnings and Precautions” section of the package insert the sponsor included
the following prominent warning: “Hemolyzed samples interfere with the assay and
should not be tested. Samples that are visibly hemolyzed should be redrawn. Testing
hemolyzed samples with >1.0 mg/mL hemoglobin may cause erroneous results.”
The sponsor also evaluated potential endogenous interfering substances using serum
samples with Lp-PLA activity ranging from 80 to 315 nmol/min/mL. The results of
2
these studies support the claims in the package insert.
Exogenous Interference: CLSI EP7-A2 was used in developing the studies to
determine potential interference from exogenous substances. Testing was performed
using 1 Beckman Coulter AU400 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer on 4 native plasma
specimens and 1 kit lot. Native plasma samples with Lp-PLA activity ranging from
2
101 to 315 nmol/min/mL were spiked with two levels of the potential interferent and
tested in duplicate. The interferent sample results were averaged and compared to
matching control sample results, and % recoveries were calculated. Samples spiked
with the following substances at the listed concentrations demonstrated percent
recoveries of 90–110% in the measured Lp-PLA activity level, calculated based on
2
the expected (control) value.

b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor performed 2 studies to support the use of different sample matrices.
In one study, native (unaltered) blood samples from 131 donors collected into
serum and K EDTA plasma tubes (both without separators) were evaluated.
2
Samples were tested in singlicate for both matrices and compared using Deming
regression with equal measurement error for the independent and dependent
variable (orthogonal regression). The results of the study are summarized below:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The clinical effectiveness of the proposed device in its intended use population was
established in the PLAC Test for Lp-PLA Activity Validation Study (Clinical
2
Validation Study), a sub-study from the Reasons for Geographic And Racial
Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study. REGARDS, a nationwide observational
population study by the National Institutes of Health with almost 31,000 participants
enrolled, is designed to follow an “all comers” population for potential racial and
geographical differences in the risk of stroke and CHD events. REGARDS targeted a
balanced enrollment of sex and race, and only enrolled black and white participants.
For the Clinical Validation Study, a subset of the REGARDS study was used. A total
of 4,598 subjects (including a total of 933 cases and 3,665 controls) from the
REGARDS study with no history of CHD were tested. The subjects ranged from 45
to 92 years of age and included 41.7% males and 58.3% females, and 41.5% blacks
and 58.5% whites. Median follow-up time was 5.3 years (minimum of 5 days to
maximum of 7.9 years). The primary endpoint used in the Clinical Validation Study
was a composite of total CHD events, comprising 1) acute myocardial infarction, 2)
coronary revascularization, and 3) CHD-related death.
The Clinical Validation Study used a case-cohort study design. Consistent with the
intended use, subjects were randomly sampled from all REGARDS participants with
no prior history of cardiovascular events at baseline enrollment (23,019 participants).
This sampled population was then enriched with all remaining REGARDS CHD
cases that were not included in the original random subset of the Clinical Validation
Study. Descriptive statistics and statistical tests confirmed that the case-cohort was
representative of the full REGARDS population. Efficacy analyses, Kaplan-Meier
analyses and Cox proportional hazards models, were all weighted to adjust the
Clinical Validation Study to the underlying prevalence of cases in the parent study
population.
Frozen EDTA plasma specimens were tested with the PLAC Test for Lp-PLA
2
Activity following the recommended sample handling protocol and the observed
values were analyzed. The sponsor provided data supporting the stability of the
frozen EDTA plasma specimen used in the Clinical Validation Study for the length
and condition of storage of the study specimens.
PLAC Activity Distribution: PLAC Test for Lp-PLA Activity values in the sampled
2
population ranged from a minimum of <10 nmol/min/mL to a maximum of >382
nmol/min/mL, with a median value of 178 nmol/min/mL (interquartile range (IQR)
145 – 216 nmol/min/mL).
Analysis Cut-point: The PLAC Test for Lp-PLA Activity cut-point of 225
2
nmol/min/mL was pre-specified based on prior studies and publications using PLAC

--- Page 12 ---
activity in other independent cohorts. This analysis cut-point was used as a binary
classifier in the study, dividing the study population into the low (below the cut-point)
and high (at or above the cut-point) PLAC Activity groups.
Kaplan-Meier Analyses: In the Kaplan-Meier analysis of the Clinical Validation
Study, absolute risk of CHD events was higher in the high PLAC Activity group (log-
rank p-value < 0.001), as seen in the figure below. The absolute risk of CHD events
of the two groups separated early and was consistently different after one year of
follow-up and at all subsequent timepoints pre-specified for the analysis
The same analysis was also statistically significant within each sex and race analyzed
independently (log-rank p-value < 0.001 for each analysis).
Absolute Rates of CHD by PLAC Activity Group: The absolute risk of CHD events
at 5-year follow-up is presented for each PLAC Activity group of the Clinical
Validation Study in the table below. The study indicated that the absolute risk of
CHD events in the high PLAC Activity group is 2.1 times the absolute risk of CHD
events in the low PLAC Activity group.

Race by Sex Subgroup Analyses: The predictive power of the PLAC Test for Lp-
PLA Activity was also assessed for each combination of race and sex of the Clinical
2
Validation Study. The figure below shows the predictive power of PLAC Activity for
each combination of race and sex using univariate Cox proportional hazards models
[high versus low PLAC activity group], with 5-year Kaplan-Meier rate estimates
provided for each PLAC Activity group. The PLAC Test for Lp-PLA Activity was
2
shown to be a statistically significant predictor of total CHD events in all subgroups,
with a consistently higher HR estimate observed for women compared to that for
men, regardless of race. Summary data is presented in the table below:

LDL, and HDL.
4. Clinical cut-off:
The PLAC Test for Lp-PLA Activity cut-point of 225 nmol/min/mL was pre-specified
2
based on prior studies and publications using PLAC activity in other independent cohorts.
This analysis cut-point was used as a binary classifier in the study, dividing the study
population into the low (below the cut-point) and high (at or above the cut-point) PLAC
Activity groups.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Fresh remnant native EDTA-plasma samples were obtained from an all-comers
population of 300 subjects from a biobank and a clinical lab at 2 different geographical
locations in the United States. The age range for inclusion was 35 to 75 years old
(median age 57). The testing population included 154 males and 146 females of the
clinically relevant age with a racial distribution of 38% White, 32% Black, 21% Hispanic
and 9% Asian. Samples were tested with the PLAC Test for Lp-PLA Activity in
2
singlicate with 1 kit lot on 1 Beckman Coulter AU400 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer and
the expected values were computed. The distribution of the samples tested is presented
in the table below:
