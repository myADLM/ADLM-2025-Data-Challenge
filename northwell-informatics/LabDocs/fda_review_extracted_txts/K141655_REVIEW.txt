L. Test Principle:
The QUANTA Flash® Ro52 assay is a microparticle chemiluminescent immunoassay
designed for use on the BIO-FLASH® instrument. The instrument platform is a fully
automated closed system with continuous load and random access capabilities that
automatically processes the samples, runs the assay and reports the results. It includes liquid
handling hardware, luminometer and computer with software-user interface. The QUANTA
Flash® Ro52 assay utilizes a reagent cartridge format, which is compatible with the BIO-
FLASH® instrument.
Purified recombinant Ro52 antigen is coated onto paramagnetic beads. The bead suspension
is lyophilized and stored in the bead tube. Prior to use in the BIO-FLASH® system, the
sealed reagent tubes are pierced with the reagent cartridge lid and the beads are rehydrated
and resuspended using resuspension buffer by pipetting up and down with a transfer pipette.
The reagent cartridge is then loaded onto the BIO-FLASH® instrument. Samples are also
loaded onto the instrument in sample racks. A patient serum sample is prediluted by the
BIO-FLASH® with system rinse in a small disposable plastic cuvette. Small amounts of the
diluted patient serum, the beads, and assay buffer are all combined into a second cuvette, and
mixed. This cuvette is then incubated at 37°C. The beads are magnetized and washed several
times. Isoluminol conjugated anti-human IgG antibodies are then added to the cuvette, and
again incubated at 37°C. The beads are magnetized and washed repeatedly. The isoluminol
conjugate is oxidized when Trigger 1 and Trigger 2 are added to the cuvette, and the flash of
light produced from this reaction is measured as Relative Light Units (RLU) by the BIO-
FLASH® optical system. The RLU are proportional to the amount of isoluminol conjugate
that is bound to the human IgG, which is in turn proportional to the amount of anti-Ro52
antibodies bound to the corresponding Ro52 on the beads.
For determining the amount of antibody in a sample, the QUANTA Flash® Ro52 assay
utilizes a predefined lot specific Master Curve that is uploaded onto the instrument through
the reagent cartridge barcode. Every new lot number of reagent cartridge must be calibrated
before first use, with the QUANTA Flash® Ro52 Calibrators. Based on the results obtained
with the two Calibrators included in the Calibrator Set, an instrument specific Working
Curve is created, which is used to calculate chemiluminescent units (CU) from the instrument
signal (RLU) obtained for each sample.

Precision: The precision of the QUANTA Flash® Ro52 assay was evaluated on nine
serum samples containing various concentrations of Ro52 antibodies. Each sample
was run in duplicate, twice a day, for 21 days with one reagent lot (total of 84
replicates per sample). Data were analyzed for within run, between run, between day
and total precision. All %CV values were within the manufacturer’s pre-determined
acceptance limit of <10%. The results are summarized in the table below.

Reproducibility: Six samples were tested on two different reagent lots, using two
different lots of calibrators, by two operators. Samples were run in quadruplicate,
twice a day, for 10 days, to generate 80 data points per sample. Data were analyzed
for within run, between reagent lots, between calibrator lots, between operators and
total precision. All %CV values were within the manufacturer’s pre-determined
acceptance limit, 10%. The results are summarized in the tables below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity: The analytical measuring range of the assay is defined by the lowest and
highest points on the master curve (2.3 – 1685.3 CU). The linearity across this range
was evaluated by a study according to CLSI EP6-A. Serially diluted samples with
Ro52 concentrations ranging from 1.8 to 2414.7 CU were prepared by diluting each
of four high positive serum samples with analyte free (stripped) serum. Each dilution

Auto- rerun: To validate the auto-rerun function with 1:35 dilutions, five high
positive specimens with anti-Ro52 antibody concentration above assay measuring
range (2226.7, 8124.4, 10165.7, 21180.4, and 23004.7 CU) were run with the auto-
rerun function enabled on the BIO-FLASH®. The same set of samples prepared
manually with 1:35 fold dilution was used as reference. The % recovery values for
results obtained with the auto-rerun results compared to results obtained with the
manual dilution were between 87% and 97%.
Hook effect: The same set of five high positive samples used in the validation study
for auto-rerun function and having anti-Ro52 antibody concentration above assay
measuring range was examined to assess hook effect. No hook effect was observed
up to 23004.7 CU.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: There is no recognized standard or reference material for anti-Ro52
autoantibodies. The calibrator and control values are directly traceable to in-house
standards that are used to create the master curves for the QUANTA Flash® Ro52.
Value assignment: The QUANTA Flash® Ro52 Calibrators and Controls are
manufactured by diluting human serum that contains high titer of anti-Ro52
antibodies. The target CU is achieved through trial dilutions on small scale. Once a
dilution is selected, the Calibrators and Controls are bulked, tested, and adjusted.
Upon completion of the manufacturing process, the Calibrators and Controls are
tested on at least two instruments, on at least two lots of reagent cartridge, in
replicates of 10 to determine final value assignment. The target values and ranges for
the Calibrators and Controls are listed below:

Stability:
Kit stability (unopened): The accelerated stability study was performed using three
lots of Ro52 coupled beads, calibrators, and controls. Real-time stability is on-going;
the results to date support a claim of 12 months stability for unopened kits, calibrators
and controls stored at 2 – 8°C.
On-board (In-use) stability: On-board stability study was performed for calibrators,
controls and reagent cartridge:
i. Calibrators: Calibrators were placed uncapped, onboard the instrument, and
calibration was performed five times over 8.5 hours. Controls and a panel of
characterized patient specimens were run on each calibration curve. Each
calibrator is measured in triplicate during calibration.
ii. Controls: Two vials of each control were assayed twice a day for a total of 20
runs. The first run was used to establish baseline value, and then an additional
19 runs were performed. During runs, the Controls were left uncapped,
onboard the instrument for 15 minutes per run. When not in use, the controls
were capped, and stored at 5ºC ± 3°C.
iii. Reagent Cartridge: Three lots of cartridges were tested with four serum
specimens (with different reactivity levels) along with the Negative and
Positive Controls. The specimens were tested periodically up to 90 days.
Percent recoveries were calculated compared to the day zero average values,
and linear regression analysis was performed by plotting % recovery against
the number of days.
All results met the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria and support the following
stability claim:
Calibrators 8 hours on-board; up to 4 calibrations.
Controls Up to 15 uses with 10 min on-board per use
Reagent Cartridge 36 days on-board
Sample stability: The study was performed with six samples (two negatives, two
positives, and two around the cut-off), tested at 2 – 8°C, and room temperature (RT).
In addition, the samples were tested for the stability after repeated freeze/thaw cycles
up to three cycles. The results support sample stability up to 48 hours of storage at

d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying four blank samples in five
replicates per sample over three days with two reagent lots. Sixty data points per lot
were generated. LoB for each lot was calculated separately at the 95th percentile
using the non-parametric method, as the dataset showed non-normal distribution (p
values of 0.0068 and < 0.0001, respectively). The LoB for two lots was determined
to be 308 RLU and 319 RLU. The claimed LoB value is 319 RLU.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by assaying five samples with anti-
Ro52 antibody concentration between LoB and approximately four times of LoB.
Each sample was tested in five replicates over three days on two reagent lots. LoD
value was calculated as the LoB + 1.645 x SD of the replicates for the low level
samples. The LoD of the QUANTA Flash® Ro52 assay for the two lots were
determined to be 400 and 402 RLU, which are below the value of the lowest
QUANTA Flash® Ro52 Master Curve standard (2.3 CU), and therefore below the
Analytical Measuring Range of the assay. The claimed LoD is 402 RLU.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interference: Three serum samples with antibody concentration at 16.5
CU (negative), 21.9 CU (around the cut-off), and 64.9 CU (positive) were spiked with
known quantities of bilirubin (10, 5.0 or 2.5 mg/dL), hemoglobin (200, 100, or 50
mg/dL), triglycerides/cholesterol (1000/224.3, 500/112.2, or 250/56.1 mg/dL), or
rheumatoid factor (RF) (about 500, 300, or 100 IU/mL). Each sample was tested in
triplicate and the recovery was calculated by comparing to control samples spiked
with the same volume of diluents. No interference (<15%) was detected in the
samples up to the concentrations listed in the table below:
Potential Interfering Maximum Range of % Recovery
Substances Concentration
Bilirubin 10 mg/dL 87 – 91%
Hemoglobin 200 mg/dL 89 – 93%
Triglycerides 1000 mg/dL 91 – 93%
Cholesterol 224.3 mg/dL 91 – 93%
RF 500 IU/mL 95 – 108%
Analytical cross-reactivity: Cross reactivity of the QUANTA Flash® Ro52 was
investigated using 12 reference sera from the Center of Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). The Reference sera IS2105 ANA #7 (Anti-SS-A/Ro), IS2073
ANA #2 [IIF ANA (speckled pattern); anti-SS-B/La] and IS2187 ANA #10 (Anti-
Jo1) showed a concentration of 32.4 CU, 40.7 CU and 443.7 CU, respectively. The
other nine (9) reference sera in the panel were negative.

f. Assay cut-off:
The QUANTA Flash® Ro52 cut-off was determined by testing samples form a
reference population of 155 subjects (115 apparently healthy blood donors and 40
other control disease samples). The cut-off was established as 20 CU based on the
97th percentile of the results obtained.
Positive Negative
QUANTA Flash® Ro52 ≥ 20 CU < 20 CU
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Samples for method comparison analysis included 319 samples from the clinical
validation study (see below), along with 27 additional samples characterized as
having a speckled pattern on HEp-2 by ANA IIF. From the total sample size of 319,
results for 283 samples were within the reportable range of the assay. These samples
were tested on both the QUANTA Flash® Ro52 and on the predicate. The results are
summarized below:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected value in the normal population is “negative”. Anti-Ro52 antibody levels
were analyzed in a cohort of 111 apparently healthy blood donors (90 females and 21
males, ages 17 to 60 years, with an average age of 32.6 years and median age of 31years)
using the QUANTA Flash® Ro52. The results showed a mean concentration of 8 CU
with the values ranging from <2.3 to 19.3 CU. None of the samples were positive on the
QUANTA Flash® Ro52.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
