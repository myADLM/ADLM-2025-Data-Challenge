L. Test Principle:
The Gmate® mini and Gmate® STEP Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are based on
measurement of a small electrical current produced by the reaction of glucose in the blood
sample with the reagents on the test strip. The current changes with the amount of glucose in
the blood sample. The glucose concentration in the sample is calculated based on the
electrical current and is displayed on the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The repeatability study was performed using venous whole blood (hematocrit ranged
from 35 to 50%) at five different glucose concentrations. The final glucose
concentrations for the blood samples were confirmed by YSI. Each sample was
tested fifty times using twenty meters and one lot of test strips by two operators
(N=50 per concentration level per operator). A vial of test strips was assigned to each
meter. The repeatability study was repeated with two more test strip lots. The results
are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Fourteen venous whole blood samples were prepared by mixing a low glucose
concentration blood sample (7.6 mg/dL) and a high glucose concentration blood
sample (634 mg/dL) to cover the device measuring range. Glucose concentrations
used with 3 test strip lots (7.6, 17.4, 27.2, 46.8, 66.4, 76.2, 86.0, 164.4, 242.7, 321.1,
399.5, 477.9, 556.2 and 634.6 mg/dL) were confirmed by YSI. The study was
performed using ten meters and one vial of test strips from one lot in five replicates.
The linearity study was repeated with two more test strip lots. The results of linear
regression analysis are summarized below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability – The candidate BGMS devices are traceable to NIST SRM 917b.
Value assignment – The Gmate Control Solutions, available in three levels 1, 2 and 3,
were cleared under k113636. Value assignment was reviewed and established under
k113636.
Control Stability - The Gmate Control Solutions, available in three levels 1, 2 and 3,
were cleared under k113636. The sponsor provided Gmate Control Solutions
stability studies. The study protocols and acceptance criteria for opened and closed
vial stability were reviewed and found acceptable. Gmate Control Solutions have a
shelf life of 12 months and are stable for 90 days after opening when stored at 39.2°F
to 86°F (4°C to 30°C).
Test Strip Stability - The Gmate Test Strips Stability Study protocols and acceptance
criteria for opened and closed vial stability were reviewed and found acceptable. The
unopened test strip vials have a 24 month shelf-life and are stable for 3 months after
opening when stored at temperatures between 35.6°F to 89.6°F (2°C to 32°C) and 10
to 90% R.H.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20 to 600 mg/dL based on the linearity/assay reportable range
study above (section M.1.b.).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference study was designed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline on both the
Gmate mini BGMS and Gmate
Twenty nine potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances were
evaluated by spiking venous blood with two levels of glucose concentrations, 100
mg/dL and 300 mg/dL (measured by YSI). The blood samples were spiked with the
potentially interfering compounds and tested in replicates of five using ten meters
(from each of the two candidate devices) and three test strip lots. Five concentrations
(including the therapeutic, intermediate and high toxic levels) of the interfering
substances were tested. Bias was calculated as the individual percent difference in
glucose reading between the test (individual measurements) and control (mean value)
concentration groups.
The sponsor claims no significant interference for the substances and concentrations
shown in the table below for both the devices:

Lay User Results with Capillary Blood from the Fingertip
Two separate user studies were conducted by two sets of 100 lay users and a
healthcare professional using fresh capillary blood samples, over seven days using the
Gmate mini BGMS and the Gmate STEP BGMS. Labeling was provided only in
English and users followed it to perform the testing. The lay user first performed the
testing of the finger followed by the healthcare professional performing the testing.
Then, immediately after the above tests were completed, venous whole blood samples
were collected, plasma separated, and tested on YSI. The samples were tested using
one meter and test strip from one lot of test strips (out of three lots). All results were
compared to the YSI. Results are summarized below:

Alternative Site Testing by Lay User
Two separate AST testing studies by Lay Users using the Gmate mini BGMS and the
Gmate STEP BGMS were performed by two distinct sets of 100 participants and
results were compared to the YSI. The testing on YSI was performed by a healthcare
professional using venous blood collected within 5 minutes of testing by lay users.
The samples were tested using one meter and test strip from one lot of test strips (out
of three lots). Results are summarized below:

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose tests with the two candidate devices are intended to be used with capillary
whole blood from finger, palm, upper arm, forearm, palm, thigh and calf. The capillary
whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
The Gmate mini and Gmate Step meters are autocoding devices. The devices are factory
calibrated and require no additional calibration by the user. The labeling includes
instructions for the user to confirm that the code number on the meter screen matches the
code number on the test strip vial label.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor recommends the use of Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 Gmate control
solutions with these two Gmate™ BGM systems. Control solutions are not included in
the kit. These controls can be purchased using the contact information provided in the
user manual. When the test strip is inserted into the glucose meter, control material can
15

--- Page 16 ---
be measured by following the instructions for “Control Solution Testing” provided in the
user guide for the meter. The Gmate™ mini and Gmate™ Step meters do not recognize
and mark the control result.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1) Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the material components of the two
meters with the disinfectant, CaviWipes (EPA registration #46781-8). The study results
indicated complete inactivation of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Additionally, robustness
studies were conducted and the study results showed no change in the performance or in
the external materials of the two candidate meters after 260 cleaning and disinfection
cycles (each cycle includes one cleaning and one disinfection step) designed to simulate 4
years of single-patient device use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for
the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
2) A readability assessment of the Gmate mini, Gmate STEP User Guide and test strip
insert showed a Flesch- Kincaid reading level of 4.7th , 4.4th and 6.9th grade level,
respectively . The readability assessment of the Gmate Diabetes Management Software
User’s Guide showed a Flesch- Kincaid reading grade level of 7.7.
3) Temperature and humidity studies: To evaluate performance of these two systems under
the extremes of the recommended temperature and humidity conditions, testing was
performed using 3 concentrations of patient samples (~ 45 mg/dL, 110 mg/dL and 310
mg/dL) at temperatures of 50oF (10oC), 75.2 oF (24oC), and 89.6 oF (32oC), and RH of
10%, 50% and 90%; each temperature was tested at all three RH conditions. The results
demonstrated that that the Gmate™ mini and Gmate™ Step BGMS produces accurate
results over the claimed range of operating temperature and humidity conditions.
4) A altitude study was conducted using spiked venous blood samples at four glucose
concentrations (70, 120, 220, and 370 mg/dL), and tested in a hyperbaric chamber set to
simulate atmospheric conditions at sea level (zero feet) and 10,000 feet. Each sample
was tested three times using one test strip lot. Each venous blood sample was also tested
by the YSI 2300 analyzer. The meter readings obtained were compared to the YSI
method. Based on the data, the sponsor claims that the Gmate™ mini and Gmate™ Step
BGMS can be used at altitudes up to 10,000 feet.
5) A hematocrit study was conducted to evaluate potential interference from hematocrit
using five different hematocrit (Hct) levels (20, 30, 40, 50, and 60%) across the glucose
measuring range. At each hematocrit level, five blood samples at glucose concentration
of 50, 100, 150, 230, and 330 mg/dL were tested against the YSI method. Each sample
was tested (in replicates of ten) on ten meters using one lot of test strips and the values
were compared to the YSI value of the 40% Hct sample. The results demonstrated that
the Gmate™ mini and Gmate™ STEP BGMS produces accurate results over the
claimed hematocrit range of 20 to 60% Hct.
6) A minimum sample volume study was performed to verify the test strip minimum
sample volume of 0.5 µL for the Gmate™ mini and Gmate™ STEP BGMS. Venous
blood from donors was collected and the glucose levels were adjusted to 40, 70, 125,
250, and 450 mg/dL. Blood at each concentration was applied to strips (in replicates of
16

--- Page 17 ---
five) at four target sample volumes of 0.3 µL, 0.5 µL, 0.7 µL and 1.0 µL. Protocols and
acceptance criteria were provided and found to be acceptable. The study results showed
that the minimum sample volume of 0.5 µL produced accurate results.
7) Pedometer function: The only difference between the Gmate mini and the Gmate STEP
is the built-in pedometer function in the G mate STEP. The pedometer feature allows the
user to count the number of steps they take. The Gmate STEP utilizes a Piezo electric
sensor to count the number of steps taken. Software validation documentation was
reviewed and found to be acceptable to support this feature.
8) EMC testing was evaluated and certified by IST Co., Ltd., and a declaration of
conformity was issued for each of the two candidate meters.
9) The Customer Care Service Center is available 24/7, 365 days a year. The toll free
phone number is 1-855-464-6283.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
