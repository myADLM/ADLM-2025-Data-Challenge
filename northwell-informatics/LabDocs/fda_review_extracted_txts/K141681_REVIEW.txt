E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Sysmex® XN-Series modules (XN-11, XN-21) are multi-parameter hematology
analyzers intended to perform tests on whole blood samples collected in K₂ or K₃EDTA
anticoagulant and body fluids (pleural, peritoneal and synovial) collected in K₂
anticoagulant. Sysmex® XN-11 and XN-21 are part of the family of XN-Series devices
(XN-10, XN-20 which were cleared under k112605) with technical modifications aimed
to stabilize the HCT/MCV parameters to within +8% after storage at room temperature
(18-26°C) for 24 hours and at refrigerated temperature (2-8°C) for 48 hours. These
modifications include software and hardware updates as well as reagent modifications,
i.e. CELLSHEATH(C). Software and hardware modifications include the addition of a
heating block and changes to the instrument tubing. The listed modifications only impact
the RBC/PLT and HGB dilution step: RBC/PLT and HGB will be diluted with
CELLSHEATH(C) reagent after prewarming past 30°C.

The complete instrument consists of four principal units: (1) Two Main Units (XN-11,
XN-21) which aspirate, dilute, mix, and analyze blood and body fluid samples; (2) Two
Auto Sampler Units (SA-10 for a single module, or SA-20 for two modules) which
supply samples to the Main Unit automatically; (3) IPU (Information Processing Unit)
which processes data from the Main Unit and provides the operator interface with the
system; (4) Pneumatic Unit which supplies pressure and vacuum from the Main Unit.
Operator interface with the IPU is accomplished with the use of a 22-key panel keyboard.
Three configurations for the XN-Series modules are provided:
a. XN-1000 comprised of:
1) XN-11
2) XN-21
3) SA-10 (Auto Sampler for single module)
b. XN-2000 comprised of:
1) Two XN-11 or XN-21 or combination
2) SA-20 (Auto Sampler for two modules)
c. XN-9000 comprised of:
1) One to nine XN-11 or XN-21 or combination of both modules
2) One to nine conveyors (CV), one for each XN module or Slide Preparation
Unit (SP)
3) SP-10 (Slide Preparation Unit)
4) BT-40 (Barcode Terminal)
2. Principles of Operation:
The XN-Series analyzers perform analysis using the following methods: Sheath Flow DC
Detection Method, and Flow Cytometry Methods using a Semiconductor Laser and
Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS)-hemoglobin. Cells pass through the aperture of the detector
surrounded by sheath fluid using the sheath flow method. The principle of flow
cytometry is also used. A semiconductor laser beam is emitted to the cells passing
through the flow cell. The forward scattered light is received by the photodiode; the
lateral scattered light and lateral fluorescent light are received by the photo multiplier
tube. This light is converted into electrical pulses, thus making it possible to obtain cell
information. Particle characterization and identification is based on detection of forward
scatter, fluorescence and adaptive cluster analysis. The system carries out all processes
automatically from aspiration of the sample to outputting results and uses Microsoft
Windows Operating System.
The body fluid analysis mode of the XN-Series analyzers uses the 4 part differential
scattergram and the RBC distribution obtained from a specialized analysis sequence to
calculate and display the WBC (WBC-BF) counts, mononuclear cell (MN) /
polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) counts and percentages, TC-BF (Total Count) & RBC
(RBC-BF) counts found in the body fluid.
Analysis results and graphics are displayed on the IPU screen. They can be printed on
any of the available printers or transmitted to a host computer.

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes ___x_____ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ________ or No ____x____
4. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification input is manual (by operator) or by barcode reader.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
There are two modes of sample introduction: (1) Sampler Mode; (2) Manual Mode. Each
analysis mode uses the same single fluidic and aspiration pathway.
In the Sampler Analysis Mode the operator loads the sample tubes into a rack, which is
then automatically transported and analyzed by the instrument. This mode automatically
mixes, aspirates, and analyzes samples without removing their caps.
In the Manual Analysis Mode, there are two sample tube holders: (1) Normal sample tube
holder; (2) Micro collection tube holder. In this mode the operator loads and mixes the
samples tubes individually by hand.
· In the Normal Sample Tube Holder position, whole blood and body fluid samples
can be analyzed with cap on or cap off.
· The Micro Collection Tube Holder position is used for analyzing a minute amount
of whole blood or whole blood after diluting the sample to 1:7 that has been
collected in a micro collection tube. Samples are analyzed with cap off in this
position.
· Low WBC Count (LWBC) Mode is used for retesting whole blood samples with
low white blood cell counts based on user defined rules criteria. The counting
time is set to 3 times that of the Whole Blood mode to increase white blood cell
measurement accuracy at very low counts.
6. Calibration:
The XN CALTM calibrator (k141962) is used for calibration of the instrument for WBC,
RBC, HGB, HCT, PLT and RET. XN CAL PF TM (k141955) is used for calibration of the
instrument for PLT-F (platelet count obtained from the PLT-F channel). Calibration is
performed as needed (e.g., when QC data is fluctuating) to ensure accuracy of the system.
7. Quality Control:
The XN CHECKTM (k141964) whole blood quality control material (three levels) and the
XN BF CHECKTM (k141957) body fluid quality control material (two levels) are used to
monitor the performance of the XN-Series analyzers. Quality control should be run
according to licensing agency regulations.

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Method comparison:
Whole Blood
Method comparison studies were performed to access the performance of the XN-
Series (XN-11, XN-21) analyzers when compared to the XE-5000 (predicate device).
The XN-11 and XN-21 analyzers are the same as the XN-Series (XN-10, XN-20)
analyzers (k112605) with modifications to stabilize the HCT/MCV parameter to
within +8% at room temperature (18°-26°C) for 24 hours and at refrigerated
temperature (2-8°C) for 48 hours for commercial and reference laboratories. The
changes only impact the RBC/PLT and HGB dilution step. The WBC (WNR, WDF,
WPC), RET and PLT-F measuring channels do not use the CELLSHEATH(C)
reagent and therefore are not impacted. Method Comparison studies were performed
to evaluate the performance of the RBC, HGB, HCT/MCV and PLT-I parameters on
the XN-11 and XN-21 Series analyzers when compared to the XE-5000. The method
comparison studies consisted of a total of 299 residual K₂EDTA whole blood samples
collected by three (3) U.S. sites. All samples were run in the Automated Sampling
Mode in singlet on the XE-5000 and within two hours on the XN-11 and XN-21
Series analyzers. Samples covered clinical medical decision levels and of the full
reportable measuring ranges of the XN-11 and XN-21 Series analyzers. The results of
the linear regression and bias analyses between the XE-5000 and the XN-11, XN-21
Series Whole Blood Mode met the acceptance criteria for all applicable parameters.
An example of the results between XN-11 and XE-5000 is shown below and
comparable results were obtained with the XN-21.

Body Fluid
Method Comparison studies were performed to evaluate the performance of the Body
Fluid Mode RBC-BF parameter of the XN-Series (XN-11, XN21) when compared to
the XE-5000 using a total of 299 residual body fluid samples at three U.S sites. The
body fluids (peritoneal, pleural, and synovial) were collected in K₂EDTA
anticoagulant. All samples were run in singlet on the XE-5000 and within two hours
on the XN-11 and XN-21 analyzers. The samples used in this study covered the full
reportable measuring ranges to the extent possible of the XN-11 and XN-21
analyzers. The estimation of the bias of the body fluids collected met the bias limits.
Shown below are comparison results for XN-11. Similar results were obtained for
XN-21.

Flagging capabilities
Clinical sensitivity/specificity studies were conducted to evaluate the flagging
capabilities of the XN-11, XN-21 analyzers using patient samples representing a
variety of abnormal conditions in comparison to the XE-5000. The results of the XN-
11, XN-21 analyzers flagging to the XE-5000 flagging evaluation were divided into
two categories: (1) Normal, healthy adults – No Flags, Negative Judgment (2)
Patients with positive morphology/Differential – Flags present, Positive Judgment.
The results obtained from the flagging comparison study met the specification of
≥90.0% Agreement. Note: XN-11, XN-21 Site 2, eight (8) samples were removed due
to protocol deviation and three (3) for incomplete results. XN-11, XN-21 Site 3, 14
samples were removed due to protocol deviation and one (1) for incomplete results.
Total number of samples excluded or missing = 26.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision/Repeatability Study – Whole Blood Mode
Within-run precision studies of the direct measurement parameters RBC, HGB, HCT,
and PLT-I which use CELLSHEATH(C) diluent were evaluated by using residual
K₂EDTA whole blood samples around medical decision levels and the upper and
lower limit of the analytical measuring range. Ten replicates of each sample were
tested in the whole blood manual mode at three clinical sites. The mean, standard
deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated for each sample. All
sites met manufacturer’s specifications (CV%) for precision.
Precision/Reproducibility – Whole Blood Mode
Evaluation of whole blood reproducibility for RBC, HGB, HCT/MCV and PLT-I
parameters which use the CELLSHEATH(C) reagent was assessed using three levels
of quality control material (Low, Normal, and High) performed on the XN-11 and
XN-21 analyzers. Each level was run in duplicate twice each day for the length of the
study or a minimum of 20 days using a single lot of control, calibration and reagent at
each of the three test sites. Controls were automatically mixed by the analyzers before
sampling. Results of the whole blood reproducibility included the precision results for
each site separately and then combined data to show the within-run, between-run,
between-day, between-site and total imprecision. Both XN-11 and XN-21 have
similar results and met the acceptance criteria. Table below summarizes results from
XN-11.

Precision/Repeatability – Body Fluid
Repeatability (within-run precision) studies were performed to evaluate the
performance of the RBC-BF parameter when diluted with CELLSHEATH(C)
reagent. The studies were conducted on the XN-11, XN-21 analyzers Body Fluid
Mode at three clinical sites using two high and two low residual body fluid samples
for pleural, peritoneal and synovial fluids around the upper and lower limit of the
analytical measuring range. Pleural, peritoneal and synovial fluids were collected in
K₂EDTA anticoagulant. Each sample was run 10 consecutive times at each clinical
site. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) were
calculated for each sample included in the study. Results of the
Precision/Repeatability met the performance specifications (CV%) for the XN-Series
analyzers.

Evaluation of body fluid reproducibility for the RBC-BF parameter which uses the
CELLSHEATH(C) reagent was performed on the XN-11 and XN-21 Body Fluid
Mode using two levels of quality control material (Low, and High). Each level was
run in duplicate twice each day for the duration of the study or a minimum of 20 days
at each of three test sites using a single control, calibration and reagent lot. All other
body fluid parameters were analyzed only to show that modifications made to create
the XN-11 and XN-21 analyzers does not affect the performance of all other
reportable parameters. All results met the acceptance criteria for both XN-11 and XN-
21. Results of XN-11 are shown below.

Body Fluid
The linearity of the RBC-BF parameter which uses CELLSHEATH(C) diluent was
evaluated at three clinical sites using serial dilutions of known high concentrations of
body fluid samples. The samples spanned the full measuring range of the RBC-BF
parameters. Pleural, peritoneal and synovial fluids were collected in K₂EDTA
anticoagulant. All samples were aspirated in the body fluid mode. Each serial dilution
was run in duplicate. Linearity was demonstrated from lower limit to upper limit and
within measured allowable max % diff for each interval. Results for XN-11 are
shown below. Similar results were obtained for XN-21.

d. Carryover:
Whole blood
Carryover of the XN-11 and XN-21 analyzers for the directly measured RBC, HGB,
HCT and PLT-I parameters which use the CELLSHEATH(C) diluent, was evaluated
by assaying whole blood K₂EDTA samples with high RBC, HGB, and PLT counts
three consecutive times (H1, H2, H3) followed immediately by testing samples with
low target values around medical decision levels consecutively three times (L1, L2,
L3). Three sets of carryover sequences were run for each type of carryover test at
three clinical sites. Carryover effect was calculated for each measurand and results
were within specification (≤1.0%) for WBC, RBC, HGB and PLT.

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Specimen Stability Studies:
Stability – Whole Blood
Whole blood stability was evaluated at one clinical site using a total of 30 (10
normal and 20 abnormal MCV) residual K₂EDTA whole blood samples on
the XN-11. Twenty samples (10 normal and 10 abnormal MCV) were tested
on the XN-21 due to insufficient sample volume. Two sets of samples were
collected from each donor (room temperature and refrigerated). The samples
were run in singlet on the XN-11 and XN-21 analyzers. Each sample was
tested within 2 hours on all methods at baseline or zero (0) time, 8 hours, 24
hours, 36 hours, 48 hours and 56 hours at room temperature (RT) (18-26°C)
and refrigerated temperature (LT) (2-8°C). The mean percent difference was
recorded for each sample. Stability for HCT/MCV on the XN-11 and XN-21
met bias percent limits at 24 and 48 hours.
Short Term Stability– Body Fluid
Body fluid short term stability for RBC-BF parameter which uses
CELLSHEATH(C) diluent was evaluated using two (2) residual Pleural,
Peritoneal and Synovial fluids at Site 3. Pleural, peritoneal and synovial fluids
were collected in K₂EDTA anticoagulant and run in singlet in the Body Fluid
Mode. Each sample was carefully mixed by gentle hand inversion at least 10
times before analyzing on the XN-11 and XN-21 analyzers and tested at
baseline (zero (0) time), 1 hour, 4 hours and 6 hours at room temperature (20-
25°C). The results of the body fluid short term stability study met the
acceptance bias percent limits.
b. Anticoagulant Comparison Study - K₂EDTA vs. K₃EDTA whole blood:
Anticoagulant comparison studies were performed to demonstrate
comparability between K₂EDTA and K₃EDTA whole blood samples for the
RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV and PLT-I parameters using the XN-Series
analyzers. A total of 30 paired whole blood samples (K₂EDTA, K₃EDTA)
drawn from healthy subjects were used for this study. The samples were run in
singlet on the XN-11 and the results of the K₂EDTA samples were compared
to the corresponding results of the K₃EDTA sample for the same donor. The
results of the linear regression analysis and bias between the K EDTA and
2
K EDTA whole blood met the acceptance criteria for all applicable
3
parameters. This study was conducted on the XN-11 module since the data
output from both the XN-11 and XN-21 is considered equal.
c. Bridging Study- Comparison of venous whole blood samples to capillary
20

--- Page 21 ---
whole blood:
A small comparison study was performed to demonstrate comparability
between venous whole blood samples and capillary whole blood samples
using the XN-21 analyzer. A total of 20 paired whole blood venous samples
and capillary samples (K₂EDTA) drawn from healthy subjects were used for
this study. The samples were run in singlet on the XN-21 and the results of the
venous whole blood sample results were compared to the corresponding
results of the capillary sample for the same donor. Testing was performed in
the Whole Blood Manual Analysis Mode. The venous whole blood samples
were placed in the Normal Tube Position of the Manual Mode and the
capillary samples were placed in the Micro-collection Tube Position of the
Manual Mode for analysis. Of the 20 samples tested, less than 10 samples
contained NRBCs which is an insufficient number for correlation coefficient
value. The results of the linear regression analysis and bias between venous
whole blood samples and capillary whole blood samples on the XN-21
analyzer met the acceptance criteria for all applicable parameters.
d. Bridging Study- Comparison of K EDTA tubes and micro-collection tubes:
2
Sixty three residual K₂EDTA whole blood samples with analyte
concentrations representative of normal patient samples and patient samples
across clinical medical decision levels were used to determine the presence or
absence of matrix effect between K₂EDTA normal tubes and micro collection
tubes on the XN-11 analyzer. K₂EDTA whole blood samples were first
analyzed in singlet in the Manual Mode Normal Tube Position and within two
hours of analysis the samples were transferred to micro-collection tubes
(without additive) and analyzed in the Manual Mode Micro-collection Tube
Position. The results of the linear regression analysis and bias between the
K EDTA tube and micro-collection tubes on the XN-11 analyzers met the
2
acceptance criteria for all applicable parameters.
e. Bridging Study- Pre-dilute Mode Normal Tube to Micro Tube Position
Comparison:
Twenty (20) residual K₂EDTA (4mL tubes) patient whole blood samples were
used to determine the equivalency between the Pre-dilute Mode Normal Tube
Position and the Pre-dilute Mode Micro-collection tube position. Pre-dilute
(1:7) samples were prepared for each of the 20 samples by dispensing 420 μL
of the analyzers diluent into plain top tubes (4mL tubes) then adding 70 μL of
whole blood and mixing 10 times by gentle inversion. The plain top 4mL
tubes were analyzed in singlet on the XN-21 analyzer within 1 hour of
dilution preparation in the Pre-dilute Mode normal tube position. Immediately
following, the samples were mixed 10 times then transferred to micro-
collection tubes (without additive) and analyzed in the Pre-dilute Mode
Micro-collection tube position (Cap Off). The pre-dilute mode automatically
multiplies sample results by 7 before results are displayed therefore no
additional calculation is required. The results of the linear regression analysis
21

and bias between the Pre-dilute Mode normal tube and Pre-dilute mode micro-
collection tube on the XN-21 analyzer met the acceptance criteria in the Pre-
dilute Mode for all applicable parameters.
f. Bridging Study- Low WBC Mode Normal Tube to Micro Tube Position
Comparison:
Forty (40) residual K₂EDTA anticoagulated whole blood patient samples were
selected to determine the equivalency between the Low WBC Mode normal
tube position and the Low WBC Mode micro-collection tube position. The
patients original K₂EDTA tube was mixed by gentle hand inversion 10 times
and run in singlet in the Low WBC Mode Normal Tube Position on the XN-
21 analyzer. The samples were then transferred to micro-collection tubes
(without additive), mixed 8-10 times before running in the Low WBC Mode
Micro-collection Tube Position (Cap Off) on the XN-21 analyzer within 1
hour of analysis of the Low WBC Mode Normal Tube Position. The results of
the linear regression analysis and bias between the Low WBC Mode normal
tube position and Low WBC Mode micro-collection tube position met the
acceptance criteria for the Low WBC Mode for all applicable parameters.
g. Determination of limit of blank, lower limits of detection and quantitation:
Verification of Limit of Blank (LoB)
Verification of the Limit of Blank (LoB) was obtained from 40 repeated
measurements of one blank sample (CELLPACK) on the XN-11 module. Testing
was performed by one operator in the appropriate sampling mode for whole blood
and body fluid mode for body fluids. The Mean, SD and Limit of Blank were
calculated for the RBC, HCT, HGB, PLT-I, and RBC-BF parameters. The
estimated LoB equals the 95th percentile of the distribution of blank values. The
LoB for both the XN-11 and XN-21 analyzers for whole blood parameters RBC,
HGB, HCT, PLT-I and the body fluid RBC-BF is zero (0) cells/µL.
Verification of the Limit of Detection (LoD)
Verification of the Limit of Detection was obtained from 40 repeated
measurements of two low concentration samples over a two day period (1 sample
each day) on the XN-11 module. Two whole blood K EDTA samples and two
2
body fluid samples (pleural and peritoneal) were diluted using instrument diluent
to achieve low cell concentrations with target values of 0.02 – 0.06 x 106/µL for
RBC (HGB,HCT), 1 – 3 x 10³/µL for PLT-I and 0.003 – 0.005 x 106/µL for
RBC-BF parameters. Testing was performed by one operator in the appropriate
sampling mode for whole blood and body fluid mode for body fluids. The mean,
SD and LoD were calculated for the RBC, HGB, HCT, PLT-I and RBC-BF
parameters.
Verification of the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
Verification of the Limit of Quantitation was obtained by using the test results
from the LoD study to determine the bias and imprecision for that level of
analyte. Forty replicate measurements (one sample) of the lowest measured
concentration for each analyte were performed on the XN-11 module to verify
precision at the low end of the analytical measuring range. The mean, SD and
22

--- Page 23 ---
2SD were calculated for the RBC, HGB, HCT, PLT-I and RBC-BF parameters to
verify precision at the lower end of the measuring range for each parameter.
The results of the LoB, LoD and LoQ meet the manufacturer’s expected
performance for background limits and the lower limit of the measuring range
for RBC, HGB, HCT and PLT-I.
h. SP-10 automated slide stainer
i. Verification of Method Comparison Using Whole Blood with the addition
of the SP-10 automated slide stainer:
Verification of comparability of whole blood on the XN-Series analyzer
when connected to the SP-10 automated slide preparation and staining unit
were performed by comparing the data from a configuration consisting of
two (2) XN-11 analyzers connected to one another and a SP-10 unit was
compared with data from a standalone XN-21 analyzer (not connected to a
SP-10). Samples included normal healthy donors and abnormal samples
with a variety of hematological conditions and spanned the analytical
measuring range. Samples were analyzed first on the standalone XN-21
analyzer in the Whole Blood Sampling Mode. Within 2 hours of analysis
on the standalone XN-21 analyzer, whole blood samples were analyzed on
the XN-11 analyzer that is connected to the SP-10 unit. The XN-11/XN-21
analyzers performed within the manufacturer’s specifications when
connected to the SP-10.
ii. Verification of XN-Series Body Fluid Performance when connected to the
SP-10 automated stainer:
A small method comparison study was performed to verify performance
claims for the XN-11 and XN-21 analyzers are met when connected to
each other and a SP-10 unit. Samples used in this study covered the full
reportable measuring ranges to the extent possible of the XN-Series
analyzers. All samples were collected in K EDTA anticoagulant. Sample
2
concentrations and dilutions were also used when native samples
representing the full reportable range of WBC-BF and RBC-BF
parameters were not available. Data from a configuration consisting of
two XN-11 analyzers connected to one another and a SP-10 unit was
compared with data from a standalone XN-21 analyzer (not connected to a
SP-10). The XN-11/XN-21 analyzers performed within the manufacturer’s
specifications when connected to the SP-10.
iii. Determination of Limit of Blank (LoB), Lower Limits of Detection (LoD)
and Quantitation (LoQ) when connected to the SP-10:
Verification of Limit of Blank (LoB)
Verification of the Limit of Blank (LoB) was obtained from 40 repeated
measurements of one blank sample (CELLPACK) on the XN-11 module.
Testing was performed by one operator in the appropriate sampling mode
23

--- Page 24 ---
for whole blood. The mean, SD and LoB were calculated for the RBC,
HCT, HGB and PLT-I parameters.
Verification of the Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation
(LoQ)
The manufacturer’s lower bound analytical range for WBC, RBC, HGB,
HCT and PLT parameters were selected as target values to verify the LoD
and LoQ for these parameters. Forty replicate measurements (one sample)
of the lowest measured concentration for each analyte were performed in
the whole blood mode on the XN-11 module to verify precision at the low
end of the analytical measuring range. The mean, SD and 2SD were
calculated for the WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT and PLT to verify precision at
the lower end of the measuring range for each parameter.
The results of the whole blood LoB, LoD and LoQ for the XN-11 module
met the manufacturer’s performance claims for the WBC, RBC, HGB,
HCT and PLT parameters.
iv. SP-10 Functionality - Slides for Positive Specimens
The ability of the SP-10 when connected to two XN-Series analyzers to
appropriately read sample barcode identification labels, receive sample
judgment results (Negative/Positive) and generate blood smears was
conducted using 50 de-identified residual whole blood samples. Sample
flagging (Negative/Positive) results generated from the XN-Series
analyzers were compared to the number of slides produced by the SP-10
(produced for positive/abnormal samples) and slides not produced by the
SP-10 (not produced for negative/normal samples). Slides were divided
into two categories: (1) P - slide was made for a Positive sample, and (2)
N - no slide was made for a Negative sample. Slides for positive
Specimens Analysis results met pre-defined acceptance criteria of the
number of samples flagged as Positive (abnormal) and the number of
slides produced from the SP-10 will have an Overall Agreement of ≥90%.
The SP-10 will not produce slides from samples flagged as Negative
(normal) by the XN analyzers.
i. Reference Intervals:
Verification of Adult Reference Intervals
Adult Reference intervals (normal population reference ranges) were assessed
for the XN-11 and XN- 21 series analyzers by comparing normal K₂EDTA
anticoagulated samples collected from normal male and female donors >21
years of age. Pre-established reference intervals from the XE-5000 predicate
device were used as a default normal range flag. The study results showed that
less than 10 percent of samples tested were outside the proposed reference
intervals.
Due to the unavailability of obtaining normal body fluid samples, it is difficult
for laboratories to establish reference intervals; therefore, Sysmex
24

--- Page 25 ---
recommends that laboratories reference textbook values for their body fluid
reference intervals.
Sysmex recommends that each laboratory establishes its own expected
reference intervals based upon the laboratory’s patient population encountered
during daily operation. Expected reference intervals may vary due to the
differences in sex, age, diet, fluid intake, geographic location.
