· CLSI-I/LA30-A: Immunoassay Interference by Endogenous Antibodies; Approved Guideline
2009
L. Test Principle:
The FastPack High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein Immunoassay employs a Sandwich
immunoassay principle. Endogenous CRP in a patient sample, calibrator, control, or verifier
is dispensed into a FastPack reagent pack. In the reagent pack, the sample binds with a
murine monoclonal anti-CRP antibody covalently linked to alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and a
different murine monoclonal anti-CRP antibody linked to biotin. After incubation,
immunoreacted complex (Monoclonal anti-CRP antibody-ALP conjugate and anti-CRP
antibody linked to biotin reacted with CRP in the sample) is mixed with streptavidin coated
paramagnetic particles. After washing steps (using a Tris buffer containing detergents) to
separate bound from unbound anti-CRP monoclonal antibody-ALP, a chemiluminogenic
substrate mixture is added to the system. This mixture contains indoxyl-3-phosphate, a
substrate for ALP, and lucigenin (N,N’- dimethyl-9,9’-biacridinium dinitrate). ALP
dephosphorylates indoxyl-3-phosphate to indol-3-ol, which subsequently undergoes
oxidation. As a result, lucigenin is reduced to form a dioxetane structure that is cleaved to
yield N-methylacridone. This compound produces a sustained luminescent glow following
excitation. The raw relative luminescence units (RLUs) generated are measured by a
photomultiplier tube in the FastPack Analyzer and are directly proportional to the
concentration of CRP in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated following the CLSI EP5-A2 guidance. Six serum patient
samples with concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 12.5 mg/L CRP were tested
in duplicate determinations in each of two runs per day on each of two FastPack
Reagent lots, two FastPack Analyzers per reagent lot, over a period of 20 days to
yield 320 replicate determinations of each sample. A single FastPack calibrator lot
was utilized for all runs. Within-run, between-run, and between-day components of
variation were calculated and total imprecision using general linear model (GLM).
The table below presents the results:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity:
This linearity study followed CLSI EP6-A. A high patient sample was intermixed
with a low sample to generate 8 concentration levels each tested in triplicate
determinations using one FastPack reagent lot on one FastPack analyzer using one
FastPack calibrator lot. Linear results were compared to 2nd and 3rd order
polynomial fits against a pre-specified allowable error. The linearity range was found
to extend from the LOQ (0.063 mg/L) to 15.0 mg/L.
The linear fit yields an equation of y= 0.00 + 0.97x with percent deviation from
linearity of ≤ ± 10%.
Samples recovering above the range may be diluted using Sample Diluent A.
Dilutional linearity has been validated by the sponsor in their Hook effect study.
Hook effect:
Four patient serum samples with endogenous values of approximately 450, 300, 300,
and 400 mg/L, respectively were run neat and diluted 1:100 in Sample Diluent A in
triplicate determinations using one FastPack Reagent lot, one calibrator lot on two
FastPack Analyzers. The objective of the study was to demonstrate that the Neat
values exceeded the upper limit of the assay (15 mg/L).
The results demonstrate that all high level samples recover > 15 mg/L when run neat
(range: 21.51 - 35.03 mg/L) and that back calculated actual values range from 309.5 -
442.6 mg/L CRP.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor bases its traceability process for hsCRP on the International Standard
prEN ISO 17511:2003, Metrological Traceability of Values Assigned to Calibrator
and Control Material. It is traceable to the ERMDA474/IFCC reference which serves
as the Primary Reference Material. The value assignment process for calibrators,
controls and verifiers was reviewed and found to be adequate.
Shelf Life and Open Vial Stability for Calibrators:
The FastPack calibrator materials have a shelf life stability of 12 months stored at 2-
8°C, and have open-vial stability of 30 days when stored at 2-8°C.
Shelf Life and Open Vial Stability for Controls and Verifiers:
The FastPack controls and verifiers have a shelf life stability of 24 months stored at
2-8°C, and have open-vial stability of 30 days when stored at 2-8°C.
The stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
adequate.
9

--- Page 10 ---
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LOB), limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantitation (LOQ)
were determined according to CLSI EP17.
LoB:
In this study, the limit of blank was determined from 80 replicate determinations of a
blank sample tested on four different FastPack instruments using two reagent lots.
The LOB was determined as the upper 95th percentile of the distribution. This value
was 0.005 mg/L CRP.
LoD:
The LOD was estimated from 80 replicate determinations of three low samples. Per
the CLSI EP17-A guideline, LOD was determined by the following equation:
LOD = LOB + (cß * SDS),
where cß = 1.645/(1-(1/(4 *f)), where f is the degrees of freedom, and SDS is the
pooled standard deviation of the observations. In this study, the LOD was found to be
0.032 mg/L CRP.
LoQ:
The LoQ was determined as the lowest sample which provided <20% CV. The LOQ
was set to 0.063 mg/L CRP.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous substance interference was evaluated by spiking two serum samples (1.0
and 6.0 mg/L CRP, respectively) with hemoglobin, lipid, bilirubin, albumin,
rheumatoid factor (RF), transferrin, human anti-mouse IgG HAMA and
Heterophile/HAMA. The samples testing interference with hemoglobin, lipid,
bilirubin, albumin, rheumatoid factor (RF), transferrin were analyzed in 5 replicate
determinations using one FastPack analyzers and one lot of Fast Pack reagents. The
samples testing interference with human anti-mouse IgG HAMA were tested in
duplicate and samples testing interference with Heterophile/HAMA in triplicate
determinations, respectively. There was no significant interference for the following
endogenous substances in the ranges tested below:
Bilirubin up to 40 mg/dL
Hemoglobin up to 750 mg/dL
Lipids up to 1000 mg/dL
Albumin up to 7.7 g/dL
Rheumatoid factor (RF) up to 1000 IU/mL
Transferrin up to 567 mg/dL
Human IgG up to 2961 mg/mL
Human anti-mouse IgG HAMA up to 4 mg/dL
Heterophile/HAMA up to 3641 ng/mlL.
10

--- Page 11 ---
The sponsor also tested potential interference to the exogenous substances in 5
replicate determinations using one FastPack analyzer and one lot of Fast Pack
reagents. No significant interference was found when these substances were tested in
the concentration ranges indicated below:
L-Ascorbic Acid up to 200 mg/L
Oxaloacetic Acid up to 300 mM
Glutathione up to 300 mM
Isoniazid up to 300 mM
L-DOPA up to 300 mM
The sponsor’s definition of non-significant interference is <10% difference between
the spiked and unspiked samples.
The labeling includes a limitation that heterophilic antibodies may interfere with this
method.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
In this method comparison study, one hundred and thirty three human serum samples
with CRP values across the measuring range were analyzed on the candidate device
and the results were compared to those determined with the predicate device. Deming
regression results from the method comparison study are summarized in the table below:

b. Matrix comparison:
Serum and lithium-heparin plasma
The sponsor performed a matrix comparison study to assess the performance of the
assay when different sample types/tubes (serum vs. EDTA plasma and. Lithium
Heparin plasma) were tested. Forty one human blood samples were processed to
serum, lithium-heparin plasma, or EDTA plasma in parallel. The samples were then

5. Expected values/Reference range:
A reference interval study was carried out with serum samples from 211 subjects
representing 4 different geographic regions of the United States yielded the results in the
table below. The non-parametric 2.5th - 97.5th percentile of 0.2 - 11.4 mg/L provides the
reference interval determined from this study, which is in accord with literature1-4.
Observed values
Mean (SD) 3.2 (3.1) mg/L
Median (Min - Max) 1.9 (0.2 - 13.1) mg/L
2.5th - 97.5th percentile 0.2 - 11.4 mg/L
Newborns with no evidence of infection have CRP concentrations of< 2 mg/L.5
