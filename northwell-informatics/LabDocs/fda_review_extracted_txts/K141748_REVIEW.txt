K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Amphetamine is an In Vitro Diagnostic competitive
immunoassay used to detect amphetamine in human oral fluid. This is a ready-to-use
homogenous system that involves energy transfer between an acceptor fluorophore labeled to an
mouse monoclonal antibody and a donor fluorophore labeled to drug. The assay is based on
competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the donor fluorophore for a fixed
number of binding sites on the antibody reagent. When acceptor and donor fluorophores are
brought into close proximity through a binding event, energy transfer occurs. The fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal is measured at the wavelength of the acceptor
fluorophore and is inversely proportional to the amount of drug in the sample. A Cutoff
Calibrator is used to translate the sample measurement into a positive or negative result. Controls
are used to establish and monitor precision and accuracy.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All performance testing of the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Opiates was performed
on the RapidFRET Integrated Workstation.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed using three lots of the RapidFRET Amphetamine
assay. Negative oral fluid pools were spiked with amphetamine at 0%, 25%, 50%,
75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175% and 200% of the cutoff level of 50 ng/mL. These
samples were processed through the RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector and analyzed
four times daily for a minimum of 20 days by two laboratory operators. The drug
levels in the spiked samples were confirmed by quantitative methods, GC/MS or
LC/MS/MS.
Representative data from one lot is summarized in the table below. The percentage of
negative and positive results was consistent across the three lots tested. Precision data
from this lot was collected over 43 days total with 22 collection days. Two
professional laboratory operators were used to collect this data.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability – Calibrators and Controls
Calibrators and controls are ready-to-use synthetic oral fluid solutions. The cutoff
calibrator and controls are prepared by spiking known concentrations of amphetamine
into synthetic oral fluid to obtain the cutoff level calibrator, and the positive and
negative controls. The negative calibrator is drug free synthetic oral fluid.
Calibrators and controls are prepared from amphetamine from commercial primary
standards purchased from a commercial vendor that uses NIST traceable weights and
specific assays, such as HPLC and GC/MS, to confirm drug levels.
Value Assignment - Calibrators and Controls
Calibrator and Control lots are value assigned during the manufacturing process in
two steps. During the first stage, following bottling and labeling, new lots are assayed
against at least one previously accepted, released and unexpired Calibrator and
Control lot using RapidFRET reagents. Results are qualitatively evaluated for
performance relative to the previously accepted lots. During the second stage, each
new manufactured lot of Calibrator (Cutoff only) or Control (POS and NEG) is
quantitatively confirmed by mass spectrometry (MS)-based method for target analyte
concentration. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
Calibrators and Controls Stability Studies
Real-time stability studies were conducted on multiple lots of RapidFRET Oral Fluid
Calibrators and RapidFRET Oral Fluid Controls. The stability protocols for open and
closed vial were reviewed and found acceptable. The open vial and closed vial study
results support the open vial stability claim of 30 days and closed vial stability claim
of 12 months when stored at 2 to 8 ºC for the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Calibrators and
RapidFRET Oral Fluid Controls.
Sample Shipment – Stability Study
A neat oral fluid pool was spiked with amphetamine to approximate 0%, 25%, 50%,
75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175% and 200% of the cutoff. Each spike was
subsequently processed through a RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collection device to mimic
actual collection process. Aliquots were stored and handled according to the collector
insert. Samples were shipped multiple times at ambient temperature (4ºC to 30ºC) and
at low to high relative humidity conditions (7% to 100% R.H.) from California to
North Carolina and back to California by FedEx Standard Overnight Express.
Samples were evaluated at various time points quantitatively by MS based method
5

--- Page 6 ---
Amphetamine average recovery versus target concentration ranged from 92.8% to
102.0% across all spike levels during the course of 11 shipping days (4 cross country
shipments plus carrier storage). Study data indicates that neat oral fluid samples
containing amphetamine, transported in the RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector showed
quantitative stability around the cutoff under conditions exceeding those outlined in
product insert for expected use.
Sample handling and Storage - Stability Studies
Conditions for oral fluid sample handling and storage were evaluated by preparing
oral fluid samples with amphetamine from approximately 0% Cutoff (0 ng/mL) to
200% Cutoff (100 ng/mL) in approximately 25% increments. Samples were
processed through RapidEASE oral fluid collection devices and stored under various
conditions including room temperature, refrigerated (2 – 8 ºC) and frozen (-10
to -25 ºC). Samples were periodically sampled and analyzed. For each storage
condition two sets of 9 levels each (18 samples total) were prepared and analyzed.
Frozen storage study is ongoing. Average percent target recoveries ranged from
94.3% to 99.1% after storage at room temperature for 30 days, 93.4% to 98.5% after
56 days of refrigeration, and 91.5% to 100.9% freezing for 163 days. Based on the
sample handling and storage study results, the sponsor has included the following
statement in the labeling, “Room temperature storage for up to 7 days, refrigerated
storage (2ºC to 8ºC) up to 30 days and frozen storage (-10ºC to -25ºC) for up to 4
months.”
Sample Recovery Study
Recovery studies were conducted by aliquoting neat, human oral fluid pool into glass
tubes and spiking with amphetamine to achieve concentrations ranging from 0% of
cutoff (0 ng/mL) to 200% of cutoff (100 ng/mL) in replicates of five for each level in
increments of 25% (12.5 ng/mL). Approximately half of the volume of each of these
‘PRE-RapidEASE’ samples was then removed and processed through a new
RapidEASE Oral Fluid collector, mimicking as closely as possible the actual sample
collection protocol, resulting in a ‘PRE-RapidEASE’ sample. The concentration of
amphetamine in both the PRE-RapidEASE and the POST-RapidEASE samples for
each spike level were measured by Mass Spectrometry. The results are summarized
below:

e. Analytical specificity:
A compound library of approximately 167 different structurally related and unrelated
compounds including metabolites, Over-The-Counter and prescription medications
and other drugs of abuse were used to evaluate cross reactivity and interference.
Structurally related compounds were spiked at 30,000 ng/mL into neat oral fluid pool
aliquots with 0 ng/mL amphetamine for cross-reactivity determinations, and
structurally unrelated compounds were spiked at 30,000 ng/mL into neat oral fluid
pool aliquots with 25 ng/mL and 75 ng/mL of amphetamine for interference
determinations. All samples were processed with the RapidEASE Collector and tested
with the RapidFRET AMP assay.

To evaluate the effect of endogenous substances, pH, food, drinks, medications, and
tobacco products that may be present in oral fluid samples, aliquots of a neat oral
fluid pool were prepared and spiked with the potential interferent and amphetamine to
achieve approximately +/- 50% of the cutoff. Samples were then processed through a
RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector and analyzed. No negative or positive interference
was observed in this study.
