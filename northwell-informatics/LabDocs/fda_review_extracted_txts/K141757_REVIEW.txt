Alere™ i Instrument
I. Device Description:
Alere i Strep A is a rapid, instrument-based isothermal assay for the qualitative detection of
Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus) DNA in throat swab specimens from
patients suspected of pharyngitis. The Alere i Strep A System comprises the Alere i
Instrument and the following single-use disposables:
· Sample Receiver
o Containing Elution Buffer for swab expression
· Transfer Cartridge
o For transfer of the eluted sample to the Test Base
2

--- Page 3 ---
· Test Base
o Comprised of two sealed reaction tubes, each containing a lyophilized reagent
pellet;
o One tube is for detection the S. pyogenes target, the other for the Internal
Control
The reaction tubes in the Test Base contain the reagents required for lysis of S. pyogenes, and
the subsequent amplification of the target nucleic acid and an Internal Control. Alere i Strep
A uses a pair of templates (similar to primers) and a strand displacing DNA polymerase to
amplify the S. pyogenes target DNA and Internal Control. Detection of the amplified
products occurs through hybridization of fluorescently labeled Molecular Beacon probes.
Alere i Strep A is performed within the confinement of the Test Base, and no other part of
the Alere i Instrument is in contact with the sample during the amplification process, thereby
reducing the risk of instrument contamination and sample carry-over between measurements.
To perform the assay, the Sample Receiver and Test Base are inserted into the Alere i
Instrument. The sample is added to the Sample Receiver and transferred via the Transfer
Cartridge to the Test Base to dissolve the lyophilized reagent pellets and conduct bacterial
lysis and target amplification. Heating, mixing and fluorescent detection are performed by
the instrument, and results are reported automatically.

Not applicable.
L. Test Principle:
Alere i Strep A uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification for qualitative detection of
Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus) DNA from throat swab specimens from
patients with signs and symptoms of pharyngitis. Alere i Strep A for use on the Alere i
Instrument consists of the following components:
a) Sample Receiver: containing Elution Buffer
b) Transfer Cartridge: for transfer of an aliquot of the eluted sample to the Test Base
c) Test Base: comprised of two sealed reaction tubes, each containing a lyophilized
reagent pellet; one tube is for detection of the S. pyogenes target (if present), the other
tube is for detection of the Internal Control.
The reaction tubes in the Test Base contain the reagents required for enzymatic lysis of S.
pyogenes bacteria and amplification of the target nucleic acid and Internal Control.
Isothermal amplification takes place using specific templates (similar to primers) that target a
conserved region of the S. pyogenes genome. The same template primers are also used to
amplify the oligonucleotide Internal Control. Detection of amplified products occurs through
hybridization of fluorescently labeled Molecular Beacons that are specific to the intervening
regions between the template primers on the Internal Control and S. pyogenes amplicons.
Result interpretation is based upon the gradient and amplitude of the fluorescence curves for
the S. pyogenes and Internal Control targets in their respective optical channels and
comparison to the appropriate threshold values.
To perform the assay, the Sample Receiver and Test Base are inserted into the Alere i
Instrument. A throat swab is then expressed in the Elution Buffer. The operator uses the
Transfer Cartridge to transfer a portion of the Elution Buffer to the Test Base to dissolve the
lyophilized reagent pellets and initiate cell lysis and DNA amplification. Heating, mixing and
fluorescent detection are conducted automatically by the instrument. Results are displayed on
the instrument screen and archived on-board together with the sample identification number
and date and time of testing.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A Reproducibility Study was conducted at three sites, with three operators per site. On
each day of testing, each operator ran two replicates of the following: a true negative
sample (diluent), a moderate positive sample (~19X LOD), a low positive sample (3X
LOD) and high negative sample (<0.05X LOD), for a total of 90 data points per target
level. Samples were prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) from quantified stocks
5

--- Page 6 ---
of S. pyogenes ATCC 19615. The specific concentrations tested are shown in Table 1. To
enable use of samples prepared in PBS rather than a clinical matrix, a study was
performed to demonstrate that limit of detection of the assay was similar in the presence
and absence of throat swab matrix (refer to Section 2b, Matrix Comparison).

Low 3X 800 315
Moderate ~19X 5000 1964
1 LOD = 267 copies of genomic DNA or 105 CFU/swab
Final test results for all three sites are summarized in Table 2. Over the course of the
Reproducibility Study, 5 samples produced Invalid results (5/360; 1.4%), all of which
were reported as positive upon retesting. At each target level, Alere i Strep A
demonstrated acceptable reproducibility.

detected separately from the S. pyogenes target (if present) utilizing a different optical
channel of the Alere i Instrument. The Internal Control must be amplified and
detected in order to report a negative assay result. For S. pyogenes positive samples in
which target amplification occurs, the amplification of the Internal Control is ignored.
If S. pyogenes DNA is not detected and the Internal Control fails to amplify the test
result is reported as “Invalid”.
Positive and Negative Control Swabs
The Alere i Strep A kit contains swabs for use as Positive and Negative Controls that
must be tested once with each new shipment of reagents and once by each new
operator. Additional controls may be tested as necessary to comply with Quality
Control requirements. The Positive Control Swab is coated with inactivated Group A
Streptococcus (3 x 106 organisms/swab). The Negative Control Swab is coated with
inactivated Group C Streptococcus (1 x 107 organisms/swab). The high level of the
Positive Control Swab is a potential source of contamination. This is noted in the
device labeling.
Evaluation of Control Performance
The ability of the Alere i Strep A controls to monitor the performance of the assay
was verified under various simulated failure modes (Table 3).

were tested. The expected results were obtained from 158/163 (96.9%) Positive
Control Swabs and 157/163 (96.3%) Negative Control Swabs.

Reagent Stability
Alere i Strep A kits should be stored at 2-30°C until the expiration date shown on the
outer packaging.
Sample Stability:
During the Clinical Study that was conducted to validate the performance of Alere i
Strep A, all the throat samples were collected using the BD BBL CultureSwab EZ II
device and were tested within 1 day of collection. Those samples not tested within 2
hours of collection were held at 2-8°C.
Additional sample stability was demonstrated analytically using alternative types of
collection swab that were seeded with clinical matrix either with or without S.
pyogenes, and stored for different durations prior to testing. Three S. pyogenes
positive (~3X LOD) and 3 S. pyogenes negative samples were tested at each time
point. All samples produced the expected results. The sample storage conditions that
were validated for each swab type are summarized in Table 4.

Note: The Intended Use of Alere i Strep A requires that all negative test results are
confirmed by culture. The risk for occurrence of false-negative test results due to
inappropriate sample storage is therefore mitigated.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LOD) for Alere i Strep A, defined as the concentration of S.
pyogenes that produces positive results approximately 95% of the time, was identified
by evaluating different concentrations of S. pyogenes in throat swab matrix that was
diluted in Elution Buffer. Testing was performed with two strains of S. pyogenes as
shown in Table 5. Target levels were estimated by plate counts and by quantitative
PCR to determine genomic equivalents (Morozumi et al. J Clin Microbiol 2006 44:
1440-1446).

Thirteen additional strains of S. pyogenes were diluted in phosphate buffered saline
and tested at target levels close to the LOD of the assay. The lowest dilution of each
strain at which each of 3 assay replicates produced a positive result is shown in Table
6.
Because the LOD and Analytical Reactivity Studies were not performed in naturally
occurring throat swab matrix, additional testing was conducted to demonstrate that
limit of detection of the assay is similar in the presence and absence of throat swab
matrix (refer to Section 2b, Matrix Comparison). The results showed that the
analytical sensitivity of the assay is not affected by the presence of throat swab matrix
and therefore that the data from the LOD and Analytical Reactivity Studies can be
considered representative of the performance observed in clinical matrix.

Bioinformatic analysis:
To determine the level of sequence conservation within the targeted region, the NCBI
Nucleotide Database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore) and Genome Database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome?db=genome) were searched by organism and
gene name to collect all relevant S. pyogenes sequences available in the public
domain. BLAST analysis was also performed with the Alere i Strep A amplicon
sequence against the NCBI nucleotide database using MEGABLAST with the “S.
pyogenes (taxid: 1314)” option selected to restrict the results of the search to S.
pyogenes sequences. All the sequences identified in this manner exhibited 100%
homology to the S. pyogenes target sequence, and no other regions of the S. pyogenes
genome showed a significant level of identity.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-Reactivity Study
The analytical specificity of Alere i Strep A was evaluated by testing a variety of
commensal and pathogenic species of bacteria and yeast (Table 7). Suspensions of
each organism were diluted in phosphate buffered saline and tested in triplicate at a
final concentration of 106-109 cells/mL of Elution Buffer. One false-positive result
was obtained with Moraxella catarrhalis at >108 cells/mL. M. catarrhalis and two
other species also produced Invalid results when tested at >106 cells/mL. For each of
these species, negative results were obtained at lower organism concentrations. The
potential for cross-reaction and/or false-positive results with certain species is
included as a limitation in the Package Insert.

MEGABLAST analyses were performed using the NCBI Nucleotide collection
(nr/nt) database and with the organism exclude option selected for “S. pyogenes taxid:
1314” to restrict the results to non-S. pyogenes sequences. No sequences of
significant homology were identified. Additional MEGABLAST analyses of the
NCBI Nucleotide collection were performed with each of the individual species
shown in Table 8. None of the searches showed evidence of homology with the Alere
i Strep A target sequence that is likely to result in cross-reaction and generation of
false-positive results.

Contamination Study
The risk of contamination between samples run on the same Alere i instrument was
assessed by testing an alternating series of S. pyogenes Positive and Negative Control
Swabs. In total, 30 Positive and 31 Negative Control Swabs were tested. The Positive
Control Swabs contained a target level that is equivalent to ~2400X LOD. All the
controls produced the expected results and no false positive results were observed,
indicating that the risk of contamination between runs is acceptably low.
f. Assay cut-off:
S. pyogenes Group A Streptococcus Threshold
The gradient threshold for fluorescence amplification curve of the S. pyogenes target
was established through analysis of Alere i Strep A results from negative samples as
well as samples containing known copy numbers of targets. The threshold for the S.
pyogenes channel was set at 1.5X the highest value observed among the S. pyogenes
negative samples. This threshold enabled all samples estimated to contain ≥25 copies
of target to be distinguished from negative samples and was verified and validated in
subsequent analytical and clinical studies.
Internal Control Threshold
The threshold for the Internal Control was established though evaluation of 134
samples that were presumed to be negative for S. pyogenes. These consisted of a
mixture of throat swabs and analytical samples that were spiked with known
quantities of genomic DNA. The lowest gradient values were observed among
samples that were spiked with 2µg genomic DNA. Analysis of approximately 100
throat swabs obtained from S. pyogenes negative subjects showed that the majority of
clinical throat swabs are likely to contain significantly less than 2µg genomic DNA.
The gradient threshold for the Internal Control was therefore set just below the
measured peak gradient for the sample that had the lowest gradient value.

g. Assay Interference:
Alere i Strep A was evaluated with 21 endogenous and exogenous substances that
may be present in throat swab samples. Each substance was tested in triplicate in the
presence and absence of S. pyogenes ATCC 19615 at 3X LOD for this strain. No
interference was observed with any of the substances when tested at the
concentrations listed in Table 9. Toothpaste and mucin were both shown to interfere
with the assay at high concentration but the effect was alleviated by dilution to lower
levels. This is reflected in the Package Insert in a footnote to the list of potential
interfering substances that were evaluated.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
Several of the studies that were conducted to establish the performance characteristics
of Alere i Strep A were performed in the absence of clinical matrix or in matrix that
was diluted in Elution Buffer. Additional testing was therefore conducted to
determine whether the data from these studies accurately reflect the performance of
Alere i Strep A in the presence of clinical matrix.
Testing was performed to determine the effect of specimen matrix on the analytical
sensitivity of Alere i Strep A. S. pyogenes ATCC 19615 cells were tested at four
different levels around the estimated LOD for this strain in the presence and absence
of throat swab matrix (Table 10). A similar proportion of positive results was
observed at each target level indicating that the presence of throat swab matrix did not
have a noticeable affect the analytical sensitivity of the assay. There were also no
important differences between the two conditions in the gradient values for the
fluorescence curves for either the S. pyogenes target or Internal Control. These data
therefore substantiate the results obtained in analytical studies that were performed in
the absence of throat swab matrix or matrix that was diluted in Elution Buffer.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The clinical performance of Alere i Strep A was established in a multi-center,
prospective clinical study conducted at 8 US trial sites between January and March of
2014 among patients who presented with a sore throat and symptoms congruent with
pharyngitis. A total of 505 subjects were enrolled in the study of whom 10 were
excluded for the following reasons: failure to meet the eligibility criteria (1), lack of a
reference result (5) or protocol violation in sample handling for Alere i Strep A or

reference testing (4). Of the remaining 495 samples, 24 (4.8%) generated an Invalid
result on initial testing, of which 10 resolved upon repeat analysis. The final rate of
Invalid results was therefore 14/495 (2.8%) and 481 subjects were considered
evaluable for the purposes of data analysis, of whom 182 (38%) were male and 299
(62%) were female.
Two throat swabs were collected from each subject using the BD BBL CultureSwab
EZ II device. One swab was used for the reference bacterial culture according to
standard procedures (inoculation of sheep blood agar followed by identification of
beta-hemolytic colonies by latex agglutination). The other swab was tested with Alere
i Strep A.
For the reference method, seven of the eight sites shipped the swabs in dry transport
tubes to a central laboratory for culture. The remaining site performed the reference
culture in a local laboratory. All reference cultures were started within 2 days of
specimen collection. The majority (431/481, 90%) of samples were tested with Alere
i Strep A on the same day that the specimen was collected and all were tested within
24 hours.
The performance of Alere i Strep A for the detection of S. pyogenes relative to
bacterial culture is shown in Tables 11 and 12. Most of the positive specimens were
obtained from three geographically diverse sites (9A, 10A and 33A).
