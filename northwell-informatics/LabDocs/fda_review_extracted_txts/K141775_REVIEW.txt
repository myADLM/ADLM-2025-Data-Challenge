I. Device Description:
The Sofia® Strep A+ FIA is a lateral flow immunofluorescence-based assay encased in a 2-D
barcoded cassette. Antigen-extracted specimen is applied to the sample pad through a sample
port, which is wicked through photoresistant europium chelate-impregnated polystyrene
microparticles coated with polyclonal primary antibodies to Streptococcus pyogenes antigens,
then through a localized stripe of secondary antibodies (Strep A Line), followed by a reference
stripe that acts as a procedural control zone and reference line. The test is designed to reduce
autofluorescence background by using a large Stokes shift from 365 to 618 nm. Once the
barcode is scanned with the external barcode analyzer, the cassette is uni-directionally inserted
into an analyzer drawer in the front of the apparatus. The Sofia® analyzer scans the region of the
test strip containing the Strep A and Reference lines in the result window to yield three possible
results: 1) Positive for Strep A, 2) Negative for Strep A, 3) Invalid. Europium chelate is detected
by a scanning optics unit, exciting by a 365 nm filtered LED (Light Emitting Diode) and
captured by a filtered photodiode, converted from analog RFU (Relative Fluorescence Units)
data to digital.

A positive result for the analyte is determined by detection and analysis of the fluorescent signal
at the test and reference lines, which are processed by an assay-specific algorithm. The algorithm
employs a smoothing algorithm to the data, identifies peak maxima, minima and width, then
calculates the RFU value based on peak height for the Strep A test line. The Limit of Blank
(LoB) is 1948 RFU. When the test line value is ≥ 1948 RFU, the test result is positive; when the
value is < 1948 RFU, the test results is negative. The procedural control zone cutoff for a valid
versus invalid result is 30,000 RFU. If internal controls fail at any point, the result is invalid and
an error code is presented. Results are presented on a screen and can be printed on an integrated
printer (optional). The Sofia® analyzer has the capacity to operate in Read-Now Mode and Walk-
Away Mode; however Read-Now Mode functionality has been disabled for this the Sofia® Strep
A+ FIA.

L. Test Principle:
Analyte detection from the chemically lysed swab specimen with the lateral flow device
begins with the pipetting of the extracted clinical sample into the test cassette’s sample port
and onto the sample pad, after which the sample is drawn by capillary action into and
through the label pad, through the nitrocellulose strip and into the absorbent pad. The
specimen interacts with distinct chemical environments as the fluid migrates along the course
of the lateral flow device. Within the label pad, the specimen comes into contact with
antibodies that have been coupled to the europium chelate-impregnated microbeads. During
this interaction, the beads coated with anti-GAS polyclonal antibodies bind corresponding
GAS carbohydrate antigens that are present in the specimen. The bead-coupled antigen-
antibody complexes then begin to flow through the test strip. As they migrate on, if GAS
antigens are present in the sample, they and the fluorescent beads to which they are bound
will be subsequently captured on the surface of the nitrocellulose by the respective location-
fixed, anti-GAS-specific capture antibodies. The flow and capture of the fluorescent
microbeads coated with GAS antigens allows the accumulation of a fluorescent signal at the
specific analyte line location on the test strip. Upon completion of the test, the Sofia®
analyzer scans the test strip and objectively interprets the assay result. There are three
possible results: (1) positive for Strep A; (2) negative for Strep A; and (3) invalid. It is

important to point out that the fluorescence signals obtained with this assay are invisible to
the unaided eye. The test results can only be obtained with the proper use of the Sofia®
analyzer. This ensures fully objective interpretation of the test result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All analytical studies were conducted in Read-Now Mode with the exception of the
reproducibility studies, which were conducted with the Walk-Away mode. Although the
Read-Now Mode is not available in this version of the device, this feature was unlocked
in order to simplify testing. The primary difference between these modes is that in Read-
Now Mode, the operator is responsible for the incubation time; in the Walk-Away Mode,
the instrument will wait to read the strip until the specified development time has passed.
A validation study was conducted to demonstrate that the Read-Now Mode does not
impact the results of the analytical studies in the conditions tested. See section M.3.c
below for more information and the results of this study.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Specimens for precision and reproducibility studies were prepared by re-suspending
each cultured strain in a contrived negative matrix, freezing until testing then diluting
the strain to the indicated concentration in the table below. The rayon swab that is
provided with the assay was inoculated with a fixed volume of the stock and run with
the Sofia® Strep A+ FIA. The LoD values were based on the values obtained in the
LoD study. See section M.2.b below for details on the matrix equivalency and freeze-
thaw study.
The reproducibility of the Sofia® Strep A+ FIA was evaluated at three (3) laboratory
sites (two external, one in-house) on six (6) different analyzers. Reproducibility was
assessed using a panel of four (4) simulated samples in negative clinical matrix that
include negative, high negative, low positive and moderate positive GAS. The panels
and controls were processed and tested on the Sofia® Strep A+ FIA at each site by 2
operators for 5 non-consecutive days over 2 weeks on 6 different instruments in
Walk-Away Mode (2 operators x 3 replicates x 5 days x 3 sites = 90 results per
concentration). The reproducibility study results are acceptable. The results are shown
in the Table I below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Sofia® Strep A+ FIA has an internal a procedural control zone used to monitor
sample processing and evaluate the presence of inhibitory substances or inadequate
specimen preparation. External controls are used to confirm the integrity of assay
reagents and cassette detection. The external quality controls used in these studies
were positive control swabs spiked with heat inactivated, GAS cells and negative
control swabs spiked with Group C Streptococcal antigen. The positive control serves
as both a processing and extraction control. The positive and negative external control
isolates were tested each day during the clinical studies.
Specimen stability studies demonstrated that contrived specimens were stable when
stored at 2-8o C or 23o C for up to 96 hours. These studies were conducted with
negative matrix and positive contrived specimens at 2.4 x LoD in replicates of six (6)
per condition on a single instrument for 0, 6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours.
Additional temperature studies were conducted with negative matrix and positive
contrived specimens at 1.6 x LoD in replicates of ten (10) per condition on ten (10)
different instruments. These studies were conducted for 30 minutes at 2-8o C, 24o C
and at 37o C.
Extracted specimens were demonstrated to be stable for up to 24 hours at 24o C.
Studies were conducted with negative matrix and positive contrived specimens at 1.6
x LoD in replicates of 5 (five) per condition for 0, 1 and 30 minutes, 1, 2, 6 and 24
hours on six (6) different instruments.

Data was provided to demonstrate that the Sofia Strep A+ FIA can be operated at
temperatures between 15o C -31o C. These studies were conducted with negative
matrix and positive contrived specimens at 1.6 x LoD in replicates of ten (10) per
condition on a single instrument at 15o C, 23o C and 31o C.
An inter-analyzer study demonstrated that results did not vary between instruments.
These studies were conducted with negative matrix and positive contrived specimens
at 1.6 x LoD using ten (10) analyzers in replicates of 20 for positive specimens and
10 for negative specimens.
The studies above meet or exceed the requirements in the labeling.
All controls performed as expected for all stability studies.
These study results are acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) of the Sofia® Strep A+ FIA was determined using
contrived stocks of three (3) strains of GAS which were prepared per the protocol in
M.1.a. The LoD was defined as the point at which at least 95% of all replicates tested
positive (C ). Preliminary testing was conducted to identify the approximate
95
threshold for negative and positive detection for each strain. Low-positive (C )
50
testing was then conducted with 60 replicates per strain. Dose-response curves were
then generated to interpolate the expected LoD concentration for each strain. For each
strain, the LoD was validated with 20 replicates. The LoD study results are shown in
Table II below.

* Adenovirus Type 4 was tested at 4.0 x 103 PFU/ml; The Epstein Barr Virus was tested only
with genomic copies at 4.5 x 107 copies/ml.
None of the eighty-eight (88) organisms cross-reacted at the concentrations tested.
ii. Microbial Interference:
Interference studies were conducted with each of the eighty-eight (88)
microorganisms listed above in Table IV. Each organism was tested in replicates
of five (5) at clinically relevant levels of viruses (1.0 x 105pfu/ml or the highest
achievable concentration) and bacteria (1.0 x 106cfu/mL) in the presence of 1.6 x
LoD Group A Streptococcus ATCC 19615. All strain combinations were spiked
into contrived negative matrix, prepared per the protocol described above in
M.1.a above.
Eleven (11) of the eighty-eight (88) tested microorganisms that might be found in
throat specimens interfered with the assay. When interference was observed,
follow-up tests were conducted to assess the level of interference at other
organism concentration levels. Results are shown in Table V below:

iii. Interfering Substances:
Twenty-five (25) chemical and biological substances were evaluated for potential
to cross-react and interfere with the Sofia® Strep A+ FIA, including fresh whole
human blood, bovine submaxillary mucin and some snack foods that contain
specimen-thickening substances. Each substance was tested in replicates of five
(5) or more using 1.6 x LoD Group A Streptococcus ATCC 19615, prepared per
the protocol described above in M.1.a. Two (2) of the substances tested
demonstrated a potential to cause false negative results, as shown in Table VI
below:
Table VI: Interfering Substances

Bovine Submaxillary Mucin, 28.7 mg/ml 1/10
* #false negative results/total # tests at that concentration.
** Concentrations ≤ 75µl whole blood/swab did not interfere. 2/5 results were
invalid.
No cross-reactivity was observed with any of the chemical or biological
substances. Of the snack foods tested, Nacho Flavor Doritos at 250 mg/ml
increased the viscosity of the specimens which reduced the flow and sample
volume, leading to invalid results 4/10 times in cross-reactivity studies. No
interference was observed at 125 mg/ml. Interferents were noted in the limitations
section in labeling.
These study results are acceptable.
g. Assay cut-off:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) is 1948 RFU is the cutoff for this assay, which is the
numerical threshold that is used to distinguish negative from positive. The procedural
control zone cutoff for a valid versus invalid result is 30,000 RFU.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
The analytical performance studies above were conducted in a contrived negative
matrix that included bovine serum albumin and sodium azide with protocol that
included a freeze-thaw step. In order to demonstrate that the results of analytical
studies conducted in the contrived negative matrix are comparable to studies

conducted in the presence of a clinical matrix, a study was conducted to compare the
following two conditions:
1) fresh bacteria spiked into a negative clinical matrix (pharyngeal swabs from
patients)
2) spiked specimens prepared using a contrived negative the sample preparation
protocol provided in the submission, which includes a freeze-thaw step
This study was conducted by testing twenty replicates each of four (4) different
concentrations of Streptococcus pyogenes (Table VII) for each of the three (3) strains
used to determine the LoD. All testing was conducted in Walk-Away Mode.

at seven (7) distinct geographical sites across the United States. All testing was done
at laboratories holding a certificate of waiver. Three swab specimens were
simultaneously collected were collected using the rayon throat swabs provided with
the assay. One (1) was used for clinical testing, the second was used for Sofia® Strep
A+ FIA testing and the third was shipped on ice in transport media to a central
reference laboratory for culture and discrepant analysis using an FDA-cleared
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. All eight hundred and sixty (860) fresh throat
specimens were cultured for Group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus (GAS) and tested
with the Sofia® Strep A+ FIA. The specimen was considered positive if culture was
positive for Group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus. Two (2) results were determined to
be invalid in these studies. Seven (7) additional results were excluded due to the lack
of valid external controls on the same day of running.
Bacterial culture was performed at the central reference laboratory where specimens
were plated on GAS selective agar with 5% sheep’s blood. Plates were cultured at 37o
C with 5% CO and examined for the presence of β-hemolytic colonies at twenty-four
2
(24) hours. If no β-hemolytic colonies were observed, the plates were placed at room
temperature and cultured aerobically for another twenty-four (24) hours. All β-
hemolytic colonies positive culture plates were tested for catalase and confirmed for
the presence of GAS using the FDA-cleared Streptex® Rapid Agglutination Test for
identification of Lancefield groups A, B, C, D, F and G streptococci.
The clinical performance of the Sofia® Strep A+ FIA was demonstrated with eight
hundred and fifty-one (851) prospectively collected fresh throat specimens at seven
sites across the United States. The breakdown of performance for the Sofia® Strep A+
FIA is summarized in Table VIII below:

The external quality controls used in these studies were: 1) Positive control consisting
of swabs spiked with heat inactivated, Group A Streptococcus cells and 2) Negative
control consisting of swabs spiked with Group C Streptococcal antigen. The positive
control serves as both a processing and extraction control. Positive and negative
external controls were tested each day during the clinical studies. Of 253 Group A
Streptococcus positive controls tested, 250 (98.8%) were detected accurately. Of the
three (3) incorrect results, two (2) were positive upon retesting and one (1) was not
retested. Of the 253 Group C Streptococcus negative controls tested, 253 (98.8%)
were detected accurately. Of the three (3) incorrect results, all three (3) were negative
upon retesting. Results from clinical specimens were included for evaluation of study
performance only if valid positive and negative external control results were attained
on the same day.
These study results are acceptable.
b. Clinical specificity:
See table above.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
