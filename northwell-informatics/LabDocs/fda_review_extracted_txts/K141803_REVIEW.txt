The Immunalysis Tramadol Urine Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous enzyme
immunoassay with a cutoff of 200ng/mL. The assay is intended for use in laboratories
for the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of Tramadol in human urine with
automated clinical chemistry analyzers. This assay is calibrated against Tramadol. This
in-vitro diagnostic device is for prescription use only.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as
GC-MS or permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures. The test is not
intended to differentiate between drugs of abuse and prescription use of Tramadol. There
are no uniformly recognized drug levels for Tramadol in urine.
The Immunalysis Tramadol Urine Enzyme Immunoassay Kit provides only a preliminary
analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to
obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry
(GC/MS) or Liquid Chromatography / Mass Spectroscopy (LC/MS) is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are
used.
The Immunalysis Tramadol Urine Controls are used as control materials in the
Immunalysis Tramadol Urine Enzyme Immunoassay.
The Immunalysis Tramadol Urine Calibrators are used as calibrators in the Immunalysis
Tramadol Urine Enzyme Immunoassay for the qualitative and semi-quantitative
determination of Tramadol in urine on automated clinical chemistry analyzers.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
Not for use in Point of Care settings.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Beckman Coulter AU 400e chemistry analyzer was used to generate data for this
submission.
Automated clinical chemistry analyzers capable of maintaining a constant reaction
temperature, pipetting samples and reagents, mixing reagents, timing reactions and
measuring enzyme rates at 340nm can be used for the assay.

L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on the competition of Tramadol labeled enzyme glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and the free Tramadol in the urine sample for the fixed amount of
antibody binding sites. In the absence of the free Tramadol in the urine sample, the antibody
(goat-polyclonal) binds the Tramadol enzyme conjugate and enzyme activity is inhibited.
This creates a dose response relationship between Tramadol concentration in the urine and
enzyme activity. The enzyme G6PDH activity is determined at 340 nm
spectrophotometrically by the conversion of NAD to NADH.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
All the performance studies were performed on the Beckman Coulter AU 400e chemistry
analyzer.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed by one experienced operator following the CLSI
(EP5‐A2) precision guidelines. Negative urine sample pools were spiked with
Tramadol at 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, and 400ng/mL, representing 0, 25,
50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175 and 200% of the device cutoff (200 ng/mL). Each level
sample was tested in duplicate per run, two runs per day for twenty consecutive days
(total N= 80/level) on the Beckman Coulter AU 400e chemistry analyzer. The results
are summarized in the table below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
Calibrators and controls are prepared from a standard solution of tramadol purchased
from a commercial vendor. This standard solution is diluted with a BSA buffer to
make the cutoff calibrator, control set of low and high controls, and calibrator set (of
5 level calibrators). The concentrations of the prepared solutions are confirmed by
GC/MS or LC/MS/MS.
Value Assignment – Calibrators and Controls
A commercially available standard solution of Tramadol is mixed with a
commercially available BSA buffer to the desired calculated concentrations for the
LOW control, HIGH control and Calibrators. The calibrators and controls are tested
by GC/MS or LC/MS/MS. Values are assigned to the controls once the GC/MS or
LC/MS/MS results are within acceptable ranges. The negative standard is prepared
with the BSA buffer. The negative standard is compared to a reference negative
standard to ensure that it is free of tramadol. Value is assigned when the test result is
within the acceptable range. Acceptance criteria for value assignment were reviewed
and deemed acceptable.
Calibrators and Controls Stability Studies
Accelerated and real-time stability studies in the qualitative and semi-quantitative
modes were conducted on multiple lots of Immunalysis Tramadol Urine Controls and
Immunalysis Tramadol Urine Calibrators. The stability protocols and acceptance
criteria for open and closed vial were reviewed and found acceptable. The open vial

and closed vial study results support the open vial stability claim of six months and
closed vial stability claim of twelve months when stored at 2 to 8 ºC for the
Immunalysis Tramadol Urine Controls and Immunalysis Tramadol Urine Calibrators.
Sample Storage - Stability Studies
A specimen storage study was performed using urine specimens at tramadol
concentration of 147 ng/mL (below the cutoff) and 245 ng/mL (above the cutoff) to
establish specimen storage stability at 2 – 8°C. The urine specimen at tramadol
concentration below the cutoff was negative in comparison to the 200ng/mL cutoff
for day 0, week 1, 2, 3 and 4. The urine specimen at tramadol concentration above
the cutoff was positive in comparison to the 200ng/mL cutoff for Day 0, Week 1, 2, 3
and 4. The stability study supported a one month urine specimen containing tramadol
stability when stored at 2 – 8°C.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
An analytical specificity study to evaluate interference from non-structurally and
structurally related compounds was performed in the qualitative and semi-quantitative
mode. The study design and results are described below. Results were the same for
each mode (qualitative and semi-quantitative modes).
Structurally Related Compounds
Compounds sharing structural or conformational similarity to tramadol were tested
for cross-reactivity with the candidate device. The structurally related compounds
that exhibited cross-reactivity with the candidate device in urine were titrated to
determine the percent cross-reactivity. The concentration (ng/mL) of cross-reactant
that gives a response equivalent to the cutoff, and the percent cross-reactivity are
presented in the table below.

Endogenous Compounds
Potential interference from endogenous compounds was evaluated in the qualitative
and semi-quantitative modes, by spiking these compounds at high concentrations in
pooled negative urine and in pooled urine spiked with tramadol at ± 25% of the cutoff
(150 and 250 ng/mL).

Compounds that showed interference was further evaluated by spiking it in pooled
urine spiked with tramadol at ± 50% of the cutoff (100 and 300 ng/mL). Boric Acid
at 1% w/v caused a false negative response for tramadol at +25% and also at +50% of
the cutoff.
The following statement is listed under the Limitations section of the labeling, “Boric
Acid at 1% w/v may cause false negative results. Boric Acid is not recommended as a
preservative for urine.”
pH and Specific Gravity
For potential interference from the pH of urine, device performance in the qualitative
and semi-quantitative modes was tested using a range of urine pH values (3.0, 4.0,
5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0 and 11.0). All test samples were prepared in drug free
urine containing Tramadol at ± 25% of the cutoff (150 ng/mL and 250 ng/mL
tramadol concentrations). No positive or negative interference was observed at urine
pH values ranging from 3.0 to 11.0 for each test mode.

the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes was tested using a range of urine specific
gravity values (1.000, 1.002, 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025 and 1.030). All test
samples were prepared in drug free urine containing Tramadol at ± 25% of the cutoff
(150 ng/mL and 250 ng/mL tramadol concentrations). No positive or negative
interference was observed at urine specific gravity values ranging from 1.000 to 1.030
for each test mode.
