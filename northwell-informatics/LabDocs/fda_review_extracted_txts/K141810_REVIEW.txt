I. Device Description:
The blood sample to be tested is inoculated into one or more vials which are inserted into the
BACTEC fluorescent series instrument for incubation and periodic reading. Each vial
contains a chemical sensor which can detect increases in CO produced by the growth of
2
microorganisms. The sensor is monitored by the instrument every ten minutes for an
increase in its fluorescence, which is proportional to the amount of CO present. A positive
2
reading indicates the presumptive presence of viable microorganisms in the vial. Detection is
limited to microorganisms that will grow in a particular type of medium.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle:
The BD BACTEC Plus Anaerobic/F medium is an enriched soybean- casein digest broth,
with each vial containing 30 mL of broth. Sodium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) is added to
the medium as an anticoagulant that inhibits bacteriocidal activities in the blood. The
concentration of SPS has been optimized to accommodate blood volumes of up to 10mL per
vial.
Each BD BACTEC Plus Anaerobic/F blood culture medium vial contains a chemical sensor
in a silicon rubber base that can detect increases in CO produced by the growth of
2
microorganisms. Three to 10mL of blood is inoculated into the BD BACTEC Plus
Anaerobic/F blood culture medium vial, which is inserted into the BD BACTEC Fluorescent
Series instrument for incubation, agitation and periodic measurement. When microorganisms
are present in the blood sample, they metabolize nutrients in the culture medium, releasing
CO into the medium. A dye in the sensor reacts with the CO , modulating the amount of
2 2
light that is absorbed by the fluorescent material in the sensor. The instrument’s photo
detectors monitor the sensor every 10 minutes and measure the level of fluorescence, which
is proportional to the amount of CO present in the vial. Positivity of a vial is determined by
2
algorithms resident in the instrument rack’s microprocessor. The algorithms use the rate of
CO production as well as the absolute increase in CO to interpret the data.
2 2
Culture vials flagged as presumptively positive are removed from the instrument for
subculture and Gram stain in order to identify the microorganisms for further evaluation and
proposed patient treatment. Culture vials that are not flagged as positive remain in the
instrument until the test protocol has been completed and negative bottles are discarded at the
end of protocol (120 hours).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The BACTEC Plus Anaerobic/F (Plastic) vial was evaluated across three lots in the
Time To Detection and the Percent Recovery (Sensitivity) studies. For study details,
please see section 1.d and 2.a below. Different lots of key raw materials were used to
manufacture each lot of culture media. The results stratified by lot (combining blood
volumes, inoculum levels, organisms, and instruments) are shown in Table 1. The
precision data for the 10-100 CFU inoculum levels stratified by instrument type
(combining blood volumes, organisms, and lots) are shown in Table 2.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality Control
An internal validation study across three lots with inoculum of <100 CFU/vial was
conducted using the organisms listed below. Clostridium perfringens and
Bacteroides fragilis were evaluated with nine vials each; S. pneumoniae, E. coli,
Bacteroides vulgatus, and S. aureus were evaluated with eight vials each.
Clostridium histolyticum was evaluated in the Time to Detection study of 24
replicates. All the following organisms were detected <72 hours:
Clostridium histolyticum ATCC 19401
Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124
Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 6305
Bacteroides fragilis* ATCC 25285
E. coli ATCC 25922
Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC 8482
Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923
* CLSI recommended strain
d. Detection limit:
Microbial Detection Limit (target inoculum level 0- 1, 1- 10 CFU/vial)
The microbial detection limit study was conducted to assess the capability of the
culture media to detect low numbers of organisms (expected target level of 0-1 and 1-
10 CFU/vial) when present in blood. The study included 13 organisms (six anaerobes
and seven facultative anaerobes) tested at two blood volumes, each at challenging
target inoculum levels of 0-1and 1-10 CFU/vial across three lots with BACTEC FX
and BACTEC 9240:
13 organisms x 2 blood vol. x 2 inoculum vol. x 3 lots x 2 instrument types = 312
The results stratified by organism (combining blood volumes, inoculum levels, lots
and instruments) are shown in Table 3. The results stratified by inoculum level
(combining organisms, blood volumes, lots and instruments) are shown in Table 4.

In summary, the study did not support the claim for target inoculum levels of 0-1 or
1-10 CFU/vial for either type of vials because the percent recovery was less than 50%
at 0-1 CFU/vial, and less than 95% for plastic and 90% for glass vials at target level
of 1-10 CFU/vial. Because of the risk associated with bloodstream infections, the
expected percent recovery is close to 100% for blood culture devices. Therefore, the
claim for the BD BACTEC Plus Anaerobic /F (plastic) was 10-100 CFU/vial as
demonstrated in the Percent Recovery study below (Tables 7, 8, and 9).

2. Comparison studies:
Performance of the BD BACTEC Plus Anaerobic/F (plastic) blood culture vials was
evaluated in a seeded internal analytical studies to demonstrate comparable performance
to the predicate device, the BD BACTEC Plus Anaerobic/F (glass) blood culture vials.
Comparison results were acceptable. The comparisons were made using the following
parameters: Time to detection, percent recovery, false negative rate, false positive rate,
and antimicrobial neutralization capability.
For comparison of time to detection, percent recovery, and false negative rate studies,
95% two-sided bootstrap confidence intervals for differences were used for the statistical
analysis.
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Instrument Time to Detection (TTD) study
The TTD analysis was evaluated in the percent recovery study with 442 pairs of both
glass positive and plastic positive results at inoculum level of 10-100 CFU/vial, two
blood volumes of 3 mL and 10 mL, across three lots and by four instruments. The
study demonstrated the following:

iii. Difference in median TTD (Plastic-Glass): -0.0776 hours
The data indicated that the new device (plastic vial) was 4.62 minutes faster than the
predicate device (glass vial). The new device performed equivalently when compare to
the predicate device.
The data also indicated that the performance for different blood volumes, 3 mL and 10
mL were the same. The TTD results for the 10-100 CFU inoculum levels stratified by
lot (combining blood volumes, organisms, and instruments) are shown in Table 5. The

The percent recovery was evaluated in a study of 528 paired sets at the inoculum of
10- 100 CFU/vial on four instruments across three lots using a diverse set of
microorganisms frequently isolated in blood. Of the 528 paired sets, 442 sets
recovered organisms in both the plastic vial and the glass vial and 70 were negative
by both vials. Fourteen paired sets were recovered in the plastic vials but not in the
glass vials and two were recovered in the glass vials but not in the plastic vials.

False Positive Rates
False positivity was assessed with vials inoculated with fresh human blood of 2, 4, 6,
and 8 mL, but no organisms were added to the vials. There were 240 pair sets across
three lots using BACTEC FX and BACTEC 9240. The false positive rate was 0.42%
(1/240) for the glass vials and 0% (0/240) for plastic vials. These results demonstrated
no significant difference between the plastic vials and the glass vials.
False Negative Rates (Instrument-negative, subculture positive)
A false negative is a vial that was instrument-negative at the end of protocol (120
hours) yet contains viable organisms upon subculturing onto appropriate culture
media. There were a total of 146 paired sets where both the new and the predicate
devices were negative at 120 hours; there were 30 sets where the predicate device
only detected (i.e. 30 plastic vials subcultured) and 67 vials where the new device
detected (i.e. 67 glass vials subcultured)
(146 x 2) +30 +67 = 389
Of the 389 instrument-negative vials, 16 were subculture positive; two were from the
plastic vials while 14 were from the predicate (glass) vials. The two false negative
from the plastic device were Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus at inoculum level of 10-
100 CFU/vial, and Porphyromonas asccharolytica (formerly Bacteroides
melaninogenicus subspp. asaccharolyticus) at inoculum level of 0-1 CFU/vial.
The false negative of Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus and Porphyromonas
asccharolytica were included in the limitation and performance characteristics
sections of the PI respectively. These results demonstrated no significant difference
between the plastic vials and the glass vials.
BACTEC Instrument Compatibility
A total of 132 paired sets at 10-100 CFU/vial were evaluated across four instruments
comprising of BACTEC 9050, 9240, FX, and FX40 in the percent recovery study.
Twenty-two organisms were evaluated with both 3 mL and 10 mL blood. The
performance for different blood volumes, 3 mL and 10 ml, were the same.
The percent recovery results for the 10-100 CFU inoculum levels stratified by
instrument (combining organisms, blood volumes, and lots are shown in Table 9.
These results demonstrated no significant difference between the plastic vials and the
glass vials.
22 organisms x 2 blood vol. x 3 lots = 132
132 x 4 instruments= 528

Antimicrobial Neutralization Capability
The study was to demonstrate the nonionic and cationic resins in the culture media to
enhance the recovery of anaerobes by adsorption of commonly used antibiotics in the
blood samples. The antibiotics evaluated were Ciprofloxacin, Cefazolin,
Cefotaxime, Cefepime, Cefoxitin, Clindamycin, Gentamicin, Meropenem,
Metronidazole, Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Vancomycin.
The study included testing for anaerobes in which each tested anaerobe was
susceptible to the antibiotic concentration inoculated into the culture vial at 10-100
CFU/vial, 7 mL of blood and across three lots by BACTEC FX. Meropenem
susceptible Clostridium perfringens was not recovered in glass or plastic vials, across
three lots when tested at susceptible MIC level in the vials. The result is noted in the
performance characteristics section of the PI. The performance is listed in Table 10
below. These results demonstrated no significant difference between the plastic vials
and the glass vials.

Another study was conducted with facultative anaerobic organisms and the results
were noted in Table 11 below. The performance was acceptable; the result obtained
with Staphylococcus aureus and meropenem was also included in the performance
characteristics section of the PI.

N. Instrument Name:
BACTEC FX, FX40, BACTEC 9240, and BACTEC 9050
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
BACTEC Plus Anaerobic/F culture bottles are for use with the BACTEC 9000 series,
BACTEC FX, and BACTEC FX40 instruments. The BACTEC blood culture system is an
automated microbiology growth and detection system designed to detect microbial
growth from blood specimens. When microorganisms are present in culture vials, they
metabolize nutrients in the culture medium, releasing carbon dioxide into the medium. A
dye in the sensor at the bottom of the vial reacts with CO which modulates the amount
2
of light that is absorbed by a fluorescent material in the sensor. A photo detector at each
station measures the level of fluorescence, which corresponds to the amount of CO
2
released by organisms.
