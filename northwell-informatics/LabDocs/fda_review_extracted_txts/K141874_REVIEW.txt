CLSI EP5-A2 Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods”
Approved Guideline – Second Edition.

CLSI EP9A Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved
Guideline (2002).
L. Test Principle:
The urine will be absorbed into each test portion of the strip and the subsequent chemical and
enzymatic reactions will change the color of the test paper in proportion to the amount of
analyte present in the sample. The reaction for the albumin test is based on dye binding using
a sulfonephthalein dye. At a constant pH, albumin binds sulfonephthalein dye. The resulting
color on the test pad ranges from pale green to aqua blue.
The reaction for the creatinine test is based on the peroxidase-like activity of a copper
creatinine complex that catalyzes the reaction of cummen hydroperoxide and 3,3',5,5'-
tetramethylbenzidine. The resulting color on the test pad ranges from yellow through green to
blue.
The analyzer, a charge coupled device, will measure and analyzes the ratios of the
composition of the primary colors of light, and reads out the extent of change in the color of
the test paper.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision:
Two within run studies were performed; one using 2 levels of controls for each
analyte and one using urine samples for each analyte. The studies were performed at
3 different clinical sites using 3 lots of URiSCAN 2 ACR strips and 10 replicates for
a total of 90 reps per level for each analyte. Three different URiSCAN Optima
analyzers were also used. The control concentrations used are as follows: albumin
control level 1 (≤ 10mg/L) and control level 2 (80 - ≥150mg/L); creatinine control
level 1 (10 -50mg/dL) and control level 2 (100 - ≥300mg/dL) were used for the
studies. The urine samples were spiked at 4 levels of albumin as follows: -(0mg/L),
+(30mg/L), 2+(80mg/L), 3+(150mg/L) and at the following 5 levels of creatinine:
±(10mg/dL), + (50mg/dL), 2+ (100 mg/dL), 3+(200mg/dL) and 4+(300mg/dL) .

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
This assay reports color block outputs of 0mg/L (Negative), 30 mg/L, 80 mg/L, 150
mg/L for albumin, and 10 mg/dL, 50 mg/dL, 100 mg/dL, 200 mg/dL, 300 mg/dL for
creatinine.
A study to evaluate the percent recovery was performed on 3 instruments using 3 lots
of test strips, 5 test per strip lot on each instrument at 4 levels of albumin: negative, +
(30mg/dL), 2+(80mg/dL), 3+(150 mg/dL) and 5 levels of creatinine: Trace
(10mg/dL), 1+ (50mg/dL), 2+(100mg/dL), 3+(200 mg/dL) and 4+(300mg/dL).
Results are summarized below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The firm stated that the albumin strips are traceable to the CRM 475 from IFCC and
the Creatinine is traceable to SRM 914a from NIST. The strips are prepared from
commercial stocks and verified using commercial verifiers. The traceability for
albumin and creatinine is then verified by turbidimetric immunoassay using the
corresponding standard.
Stability protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable and
support the following stability claims: the strip can be stored at 15-30ºC (59-86℉)
and relative humidity of 10-60% in the closed package for up to 24 months and after
opening for at least 3 months.

d. Detection limit:
The cutoff of the assay at each color block was validated by spiking or diluting a
pooled urine sample with albumin and creatinine to achieve 3 levels of albumin and 4
levels of creatinine. Each level was further adjusted to concentrations below and
above the midpoint concentration of each of these levels. Each sample was tested
using 3 lots of strips on 3 analyzers. Each level was tested in replicates of 10. The
cutoffs for each color block are defined as the lowest and highest concentrations of
analyte tested at which over 50% of the results are positive for each color block.
Results for each concentration tested at each color block are shown below:

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed to evaluate the effects of potential interferents
commonly found in urine on the performance of URiSCAN 2 ACR strips, using CLSI
EP7-A2 as a guide. Testing was done with contrived urine samples at 3 levels of
albumin (25, 30, 150 mg/L) and 2 levels of creatinine (50, 300 mg/dL) and different
concentrations of the listed compounds with 3 lots of strips in 3 analyzers. Interference
is defined as a change in output of ≥ ±1 color block between spiked and unspiked
control sample. The results are summarized in the table below:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Albumin: Albumin is normally present in urine at concentrations of less than 20
mg/L. Albuminuria is defined as an albumin excretion rate of 30~299 mg/24 hours.
Urinary albumin excretions can be temporarily elevated by exercise, urinary tract
infections, and acute illness with fever.2, 3, 4
Creatinine: Creatinine is normally present in urine at concentrations of 10 to 300
mg/dL (0.9~26.5 mmol/L)
Albumin to Creatinine Ratio: Albumin is normally present in urine at concentrations of
less than 30 mg albumin/g creatinine (3.4 mg albumin /mmol creatinine). Albuminuria is
indicated at a ratio result of 30~300 mg/g (3.4~33.9 mg/mmol) and clinical albuminuria
at a ratio result of >300 mg/g (>33.9 mg/mmol).1

Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Each sample’s identification can be entered prior to testing by way of an alpha-numeric
keyboard and optional barcode reader.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Room temperature urine samples should be measured within 2 hours.
5. Calibration:
The URiSCAN Optima analyzer calibrates automatically before each measurement. The
analyzer calibrates by reading the white check bar on each test strip at the appropriate
wavelengths to ensure accurate test results. The instrument performs a “self-test” and
calibration each time it is turned on. Each time a test is run, the analyzer re-calibrates
using a white plastic calibration bar located at the bottom of the analyzer optical system.
Reflectance measurements from the bar must match the factory set calibration.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor recommends the use of commercially available controls intended for
monitoring urine strip results at two levels (negative/low and positive).
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Operating conditions of the URiSCAN Optima Urine Analyzer were evaluated and shown to
be at a temperature range of 20 ºC and 28 ºC and relative humidity range between 10% and
70%.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
