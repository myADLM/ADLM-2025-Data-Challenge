I. Device Description:
1. Stat Profile Prime CCS Analyzer
The Stat Profile Prime CCS Analyzer is a small, automatic blood gas, metabolite and
electrolyte analyzer. The sensors and flow path have been integrated into one replaceable
micro-sensor card, which is replaced periodically according to usage. Whole blood
specimens are aspirated into the analyzer’s micro-sensor card from syringes, tubes, or
capillary blood collection devices using a peristaltic pump and a sampling probe. The
3

--- Page 4 ---
disposable micro-sensor card contains the analytical flow-path and all of the measurement
sensors (pH, pCO2, pO2, Hct, Na+, K+, Cl-, iCa, Glu, and Lac). Once the analysis
measurement is complete, the whole blood specimen is automatically flushed out of the
micro-sensor card flow-path and into a self-contained waste collection bag contained
within the disposable calibrator cartridge.
The Stat Profile Prime CCS Analyzer is microprocessor-based and incorporates:
Traditional electrode technology to measure blood pH, pCO2, pO2; Ion selective electrode
technology to measure blood sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium;
Enzyme/Amperometric technology for glucose and lactate measurements; and,
Conductivity method for Hematocrit. The Stat Profile Prime CCS Analyzer has multiple
quality control options. Both traditional internal and external liquid QC will be available,
as well as an onboard Quality Management System (QMS). The Stat Profile Prime CCS
Analyzer has two primary sample modes: syringe and capillary mode. The minimum
sample size for both analysis modes is 100 μL.
2. Stat Profile Prime Auto QC cartridge CCS
This internal auto QC cartridge consists of 3 flexible bags within a cardboard carton. Each
bag contains an aqueous quality control material for monitoring the measurement of pH,
pCO2, pO2, hematocrit (Hct) Na, K, Cl, iCa, Glucose (Glu), and Lactate (Lac). The
aqueous quality control materials are composed of a buffered bicarbonate solution, each
with a known pH and known level of Na, K, Cl, iCa, Lac and Glu. Solutions are
equilibrated with known levels of O2, CO2, and N2. Each bag contains a minimum
volume of 100 mL. The aqueous quality control materials are formulated at three levels:
Control 1: Acidosis, with High Electrolyte, Low-Normal Glu and Lactate.
Control 2: Normal pH, Low-Normal Hct, Normal Electrolyte, High Glu, Normal-High
Lactate.
Control 3: Alkalosis, High Hct, Low Electrolyte, High Abnormal Glu and Lactate.

L. Test Principle:
pH is measured using a hydrogen ion selective membrane. One side of the membrane is in
contact with a solution of constant pH. The other side is in contact with a solution of
unknown pH. A change in potential develops which is proportional to the pH difference of
these solutions. This change in potential is measured against a reference electrode of constant
potential.
pCO2 is measured with a modified pH sensor. Carbon dioxide in the unknown solution
makes contact with a hydrogen ion selective membrane CO2 diffuses across the membrane
into a thin layer of bicarbonate buffer in response to partial pressure difference. This solution
then becomes equilibrated with the external gas pressure of the fluid in contact with the outer
surface of the membrane. CO2 in the solution becomes hydrated producing carbonic acid
which results in a change in hydrogen ion activity. The measured potential is related to the
logarithm of PCO2 content of the sample after compensation of the measured potential of the
pH sensor.
pO2 is measured amperometrically by the generation of a current at the sensor surface. As
oxygen diffuses through a gas permeable membrane, the oxygen molecules are reduced at the
cathode, consuming 4 electrons for every molecule of oxygen reduced. This flow of electrons
is then measured by the sensor and is directly proportional to the partial pressure of oxygen.
Hematocrit is defined as the percentage of red blood cells to the total blood volume and can
be obtained by measuring electrical resistance of the blood sample. Two standard solutions
are used to calibrate the hematocrit sensor and to obtain the slope. The analyzer then
measures the electrical resistance of the blood sample to obtain the hematocrit value. The
hematocrit value obtained is corrected for the concentration of the sodium ion.
Glucose measurement is based on the level of H2O2 produced during the enzymatic reaction
between glucose and oxygen molecules in the presence of the glucose oxidase enzyme. The
9

--- Page 10 ---
current generated by the flow of electrons at the surface of the platinum sensor is
proportional to the glucose concentration of the sample.
Na+, K+, Cl-, iCa are measured by ion selective electrodes. An electrical potential is
developed according the Nernst Equation for a specific ion. When compared to a reference,
this electrical potential is translated into voltage and then in to the ion concentration of the
sample.
Lactate measurement is based on the level of H O produced during the enzymatic reaction
2 2
between lactate and oxygen molecules in the presence of the lactate oxidase enzyme. The
current generated by the flow of electrons generated from oxidation at the surface of a
platinum sensor is proportional to the lactate concentration of the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A within run precision study was performed at three point-of-care (POC) sites on
three Stat Profile Prime CCS Analyzers (one at each site) by a total of 13 POC
personnel, comprised of 4 cardiovascular intensive care unit operators, 6 medical
intensive care operators, and 3 trauma/neuro intensive care unit operators. The study
was performed by analyzing 20 replicates of 3 levels of Stat Profile Prime External
Quality Control material (levels 1-3) and 1 level low hematocrit linearity material in
duplicate each day for a total of 20 measurements on each of the three Stat Profile
Prime CCS analyzers. All three sites produced similar results. Representative within
run precision results from one site are summarized in the table below:

Lactate:
A linearity study was performed using lithium heparin whole blood samples. For
lactate, 11 levels were prepared by spiking a whole blood sample with lactate to
achieve a concentration near 20 mmol/L and then diluting with a whole blood sample
with a 0.2 mmol/L lactate concentration to span the analytical measurement range.
Each blood level was analyzed in triplicate on each of the three Stat Profile Prime
CCS analyzers and on the predicate, the pHOx Ultra analyzers. The pHOx Ultra
analyzers were used to establish the target value of each blood level for each
parameter. Results of the linear regression analysis of one representative analyzer are
shown below.
y=0.9946x + 0.1178, R=0.9992
The linearity study results support lactate claimed measuring range of 0.4-20.0
mmol/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The traceability of the other Stat Profile Prime CCS analytes were previously
reviewed in k131703.
Traceability: Lactate
Nova standards are made from lithium lactate and lithium reference standards were made
from NIST SRM 924A (Lithium Carbonate) and mV ratio was used as means in
establishing the traceability.
Shelf-life Stability:
The real time stability study protocol and acceptance criteria was reviewed and found
acceptable. The results support a shelf-life of 18 months for the Stat Profile Prime
Calibrator Cartridge CCS, Stat Profile Prime Auto QC Cartridge CCS, Stat Profile Prime
Ampuled Control ABG/CCS; and a 24 month shelf-life for the Linearity Standard Set
A when stored at 2-8o C.
Open vial stability:
The controls and calibrators are designed to be used immediately after opening.
Value assignment:
The control and calibrator value assignment of the other Stat Profile Prime CCS
analytes were previously reviewed in k131703.
Lactate:
Prime Cal Cartridge: The calibrator value assignment for lactate was performed over 2
days on three analyzers using 12 samples from the test lot and 6 samples of the reference
lot. The samples were run in replicates of 3. The calibrator range is based on an internal
14

--- Page 15 ---
procedure and acceptance criteria. Calibrator lactate target values are listed below:
Cal A: 2.0 mmol/L
Cal B: 10.0 mmol/L
Control Value assignment: The lactate control value assignment was performed over 2
days on two analyzers using 8 samples from the test lot and 8 samples of the reference
lot. The samples were run in replicates of 3. The control range is based on an internal
procedure and acceptance criteria. Control lactate ranges are listed below:
Stat Profile Prime CCS Control Ranges for Lactate
Prime Auto –QC Cartridge Range ( mmol/L)
Level 1 0.5-1.1
Level 2 2.3-2.9
Level 3 5.7-7.1
Prime Ampuled QC
Level 1 0.7-1.3
Level 2 2.5-3.1
Level 3 6.4-7.8
Linearity Set A Value Assignment: The linearity set concentrations are kept identical
to the reference lot and must pass in-house specifications. The concentrations are
verified by running the linearity set controls in triplicate on two analyzers. The
linearity set lactate ranges are listed below:
Nova Linearity Standard Set A Ranges for Lactate
Linearity Set A Range (mmol/L)
Level 1 15.0-21.0
Level 2 8.3-11.3
Level 3 1.7-2.3
Level 4 0.3-0.7
d. Detection limit:
The detection limits of the other Stat Profile Prime CCS analytes were previously
reviewed in k131703.
Lactate:
Limit of Detection studies were performed according to the CLSI EP-17A guideline.
Limit of Blank (LoB): Blank (zero level) human whole blood samples were measured
25 times of 4 different analyzers for a total of 100 measurements. The LoB was
estimated non-parametrically as the 95th percentile of the measurement. Linear
interpolation between the 95th and 96th result yielded a LoB estimate of 0.30 mmol/L.

--- Page 16 ---
Limit of Detection (LoD): Three low level human whole blood samples ranging from
0.36 to 0.59 mmol/L were measured in replicates of 25 on 4 analyzers. LoD was
determined based on the following equation: LoD= LoB + 1.6494 * SD. The LoD
was determined to be 0.40 mmol/L.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ): The sponsor claims that LoQ is the same as the LoD
because the measurement accuracy relative to the reference method is less than 20%
bias. LoQ was determined to be 0.40 mmol/L.
Stat Profile Prime CCS Analyzer System Lactate Assay Detection Limits
LoB LoD LoQ
0.30 mmol/L 0.40 mmol/L 0.4 mmol/L
The claimed measuring range of lactate is 0.40 to 20 mmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
The specificity of the other Stat Profile Prime CCS analytes was previously reviewed
in k131703.
Lactate:
Interference testing was performed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guidelines. The study
used spiked and diluted whole blood samples with lactate concentrations of
approximately 3.0 to 5.5 mmol/L containing potential interferents at normal
physiological levels. The bias or percent difference between the mean test value and
the mean control value were calculated. The sponsor defines significant interference
as ≥ 10% bias.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison study for all analytes (except for lactate) was previously cleared
in k131703 for clinical laboratory use only. In order to add Point-of-Care claim,
sponsor has conducted POC study using the intended POC operators at the intended
use environment to demonstrate that POC operators could generate equivalent results
as the clinical laboratory professionals. A method comparison study was performed
at 3 POC sites by a total of 53 different POC personnel (respiratory therapist and
nurses) using the analyzer’s syringe mode method. Approximately 230 Lithium
heparin whole blood gas specimens from syringes were analyzed to compare the
whole blood results obtained by trained laboratory personnel vs respiratory therapy
POC personnel on the same specimens. Less than 10% of samples for each analyte
were altered in order to adequately span the measuring range. Each of the three sites

Another method comparison study was performed at 3 POC sites by a total of 53
different POC personnel (respiratory therapists and nurses) using the analyzer’s
capillary mode method. Approximately 170 heparinized blood gas specimens from
capillary tubes were run to compare the whole blood results obtained by trained
laboratory personnel vs POC personnel on the same specimens. Less than 10% of
samples for each analyte were altered in order to adequately span the measuring
range. Each of the three sites produced similar method comparison data. The
capillary mode method comparison study data from one representative POC site and
data from the three combined POC sites is shown in the tables below:
