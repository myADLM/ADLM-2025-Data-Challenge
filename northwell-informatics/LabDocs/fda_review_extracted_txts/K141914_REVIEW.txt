b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed using venous whole blood samples. The
evaluation was conducted with 10 meters and 3 test strip lots. Samples with the
following glucose concentrations (mg/dL) were prepared: 20, 50, 90, 150, 250,
300, 350, 400, 450, 510, and 600.
Low samples were prepared by allowing glycolysis to occur. High samples were
prepared by spiking into the venous whole blood samples. Values were
confirmed using a laboratory reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer) calibrated
with NIST reference material.
Ten strips from each lot were used for testing at each glucose concentration for a
total of n=30 tests per glucose concentration. The evaluation yielded the
following regression equation based on all samples:

1 0.9927 4.6355 0.9978
2 0.9952 3.6973 0.9973

Traceability:
The system is traceable to the NIST SRM #917c glucose reference material.
Test strips and control solutions were previously cleared in k122338.
Control Solution Value Assignment and Stability:
Value Assignment protocols and acceptance criteria for the 2 levels of control
solutions were evaluated and found to be acceptable in k122338. The ranges for
each control solution are provided on the test strip vial label. Stability protocols
and acceptance criteria for the control solutions were evaluated in k122338 and
found to be acceptable to support closed-vial stability of 24 months at 39-86°F
and open-vial stability of 90 days when stored at the recommended storage
temperature (39-86°F) or until the expiration date printed on the label, whichever
comes first.
Test Strip Stability:
Stability protocols and acceptance criteria for the Prodigy No Coding Test Strips
were evaluated in k122338 and found to be acceptable to support closed-vial
stability of 24 months at 39-104°F and open-vial stability of 90 days when test
strips are stored at the recommended storage temperature (39-104°F) and 10-85%
relative humidity or until the expiration date printed on the label, whichever
comes first. The labeling instructs the users not to freeze the test strips.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study in Section M1b above. The meter displays “Lo” with glucose
values below 20mg/dL, and “HI” with glucose values over 600 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by spiking endogenous and exogenous
substances into venous whole blood. Each potential interferent was tested at three
glucose levels (approximately 80, 250, and 450 mg/dL). Ten replicates were
measured for each test sample. Results of test samples measured on the Prodigy
Auto-Code Eject Blood Glucose Meter System were compared to samples
measured on a laboratory-based reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer) and bias
and percent bias were calculated. This procedure was performed for 3 test strip
lots. The compounds at the concentrations listed below did not affect results
(defined by the sponsor as percent bias ≤ 10%):

Based on these results, the sponsor states the following limitation in their labeling:
“The system exhibits interference from Acetaminophen. Do not use during
acetaminophen treatment.”
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To assess system accuracy, results from the Prodigy Auto-Code Eject Blood
Glucose Monitoring System were compared to a reference method (YSI 2300
analyzer). Venous samples and capillary samples from fingerstick, forearm, palm,
upper arm, calf and thigh were obtained by professional users from 100
participants with glucose concentrations ranging from 44-414 mg/dL. To obtain
extreme blood glucose concentrations, seven samples were altered. Results of
linear regression of the first test from each participant are shown below:

To assess the performance of the Prodigy Auto-Code Eject Blood Glucose
Monitoring System in the hands of the intended users, the sponsor performed a
study with 109 lay user participants who collected and tested samples from their
own fingertip, palm, forearm, upper arm, calf and thigh. Results were analyzed by
comparing blood glucose results obtained by the lay users with the Prodigy Auto-
Code Eject Blood Glucose Monitoring System against results obtained using a
laboratory reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The glucose concentrations in
the samples ranged from approximately 55.6 to 330 mg/dL as measured by the
laboratory reference method. Results are summarized in the tables below:

with this system. Instructions on how to order the control solutions are included in the
user manual. The meter has a function for the user to select that they wish to run a
control solution to prevent control results from being stored in the internal memory as
patient results. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided
in the labeling. The control solution readings are not included in the average of the
patient results when the measurements are performed in the “control solution mode”.
An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The
user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study: To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the Prodigy Auto-Code
Eject Blood Glucose Monitoring System, venous blood samples were adjusted to
hematocrit levels of 15 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 60 % and 65 %. Each hematocrit level
was tested at 5 glucose concentration intervals (30-50, 51-110, 11-150, 151-250, 251-
400 mg/dL) for a total of 30 samples. The evaluation included 10 meters, each tested
with 2 lots of test strips, with 10 replicates per lot per Hct level per glucose level (for
a total of 20 replicates for each sample). Results from the meter were compared to
results obtained using a laboratory-based reference measurement (YSI 2300
analyzer). The evaluation of percent bias relative to values obtained on the YSI 2300
analyzer demonstrated acceptable performance across the hematocrit range of 20-
60%.
2. Altitude study: To evaluate the effect of altitude on the Prodigy Auto-Code Eject
Blood Glucose Monitoring System, meters were tested at 6 altitudes above sea level
(298 ft; 2 920 ft; 4,790 ft; 6,234 ft; 8,563ft and 11,161 ft). Five glucose levels (43,
82,134,203, and 321 mg/dL) were tested at each altitude. The evaluation included
three meters and three strip lots. Each lot included 6 replicates for a total of 18
replicates per glucose level/altitude combination. Results were compared to results
obtained using a laboratory-based reference measurement (YSI 2300 analyzer) and
demonstrated that altitudes up to 11,000 feet above sea level have no significant effect
on blood glucose measurements from the Prodigy Auto-Code Eject system .
3. Sample Volume: To demonstrate the minimum sample volume, venous whole blood
samples with volumes ranging from 0.5 -1.5 μL were tested. Sample concentrations
included five glucose levels (0, 76.6, 112, 175, and 340 mg/dL) tested at each volume.
Testing included 10 strips from each of 3 lots for each glucose concentration/sample
volume combination for a total of 30 replicates per volume/glucose level
combination. Ten meters were used during testing. Values obtained were compared
to values obtained using a laboratory-based reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer)
Results support the a minimum sample volume of 0.7 μL.
4. Temperature and humidity studies: To evaluate system performance under the
extremes of the recommended temperature and humidity conditions, sample testing
was performed at temperatures of 50, 77, and 104 0F, and RH of 10 and 85%; each
temperature was tested at both RH conditions. Venous whole blood at glucose
concentrations 48, 149, and 315 mg/dL were tested. The evaluation included 10
Prodigy Auto-Code Eject Meters, and 3 strip lots with a total of 30 replicates per
glucose level/environmental condition combination. The results obtained on the
Prodigy Auto-Code Eject glucose meter were compared to those obtained on the YSI
13

--- Page 14 ---
2300, and support the operating conditions of temperatures from 10-400C and RH
from 10-85% in any combination.
5. Infection Control and Robustness Studies: The device is intended for single-patient
use only. Disinfection efficacy testing on the surface materials of the meter
demonstrated complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen
disinfectant, PDI SUPER SANI-CLOTH germicidal disposable wipes (EPA
Registration # 9480-4). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor
demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of the
meter after 520 cleaning and disinfection cycles (a total of 1040 wipes) designed to
simulate 5 years of device use with a maximum frequency of cleaning and
disinfection 2x/week.
6. EMC testing was certified (Universal Testing Inc., Taiwan) and compliance
certificates were provided.
7. Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted on all labeling and
demonstrated that the User Manual was written at a grade level of 7.8 and the test
strip insert was written at a grade level of 7.9.
8. Usability: Users completed questionnaires regarding ease of use (on a scale of
1(disagree) to 5 (fully agree) as well as specific questions to test understanding of
information in the user manual. Greater than 90% of participants agreed that
instructions were effective and helpful and results were easy to understand.
Participants were also given questions to assess their understanding of the material in
the manual. More than 95% of participants scored 85% or higher.
9. The meter manual states that customer service is available (24 hours, 7 days a week)
by calling 1-800-243-2636.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
