H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Lyra™ Parainfluenza Virus Assay is a Real‐Time PCR assay for the qualitative detection
and identification of human parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3 viral RNA from nasal and
nasopharyngeal swab specimens from symptomatic patients. It is intended for use as an aid in
the differential diagnosis of parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3. This test is not intended to
detect Parainfluenza 4a or Parainfluenza 4b viruses.
Negative results do not preclude parainfluenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole
basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
This is a prescription only test. The assay is intended for use in hospital, reference, or state
laboratory settings. The device is not intended for point-of-care use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The assay can be performed using the Applied Biosystems® 7500 Fast Dx.
I. Device Description:
The Lyra™ Parainfluenza Virus Assay detects viral RNA of Parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 viruses
in nasal and nasopharyngeal swab specimens. First the nucleic acid is extracted from the
patient sample using the NucliSENS® easyMAG® System. The extracted nucleic acid is
then introduced into the master mix which contains the primers, probes, revise transcriptase,
and TaqMan® chemistry and the reaction is loaded into the Applied Biosystems® (ABI)
7500 Fast Dx instrument. First, the reverse transcriptase generates a complimentary DNA
strand from the viral RNA. The primer sets hybridize to the Parainfluenza type 1 nuclear
protein gene, Parainfluenza type 2 phosphate protein gene, and Parainfluenza type 3
phosphate protein gene, and transcription and DNA amplification of the target sequence
occur using real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Fluorescent-labeled
probes bind to the target sequences and the dye is released from the probe containing
quencher via the TaqMan® polymerase 5’-3’ exonuclease activity. The un-quenched dye is
detected in the ABI 7500 Fast Dx and if sufficient fluorescence is detected the result is
reported as positive.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility studies were conducted over 14 days and testing was performed on 5
non-consecutive days at two clinical sites and one in-house laboratory. Each site was
provided with 5 complete panels, which were stored at -70°C until used. Operators were
blinded to the sample identity, which was randomized each day. Testing was conducted
following the package insert instructions for use. One kit lot was used to perform the study.
One strain of each parainfluenza virus was used at 3 different concentrations, 5x LoD, 2x
LoD and 0.5x LoD for the Moderate Positive, Low Positive and High Negative samples
respectively. The following strains were used; Parainfluenza-1 strain C35, Parainfluenza-2
strain Greer, Parainfluenza-3 strain C243.
The following table shows the summary of results for the reproducibility study. The results
show that the assay had appropriate reproducibility at both the external clinical sites and the
in-house laboratory. The reproducibility for this device is acceptable. The instances where
the expected result differed from the actual result are within what is reasonable for C and
5
C samples.

b. Baseline, Threshold and Cut-off:
Baseline:
The baseline was determined using 38 parainfluenza virus negative clinical specimens. Next,
known positive samples were tested and analyzed using two different baseline settings,
manual and auto baseline on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx. When using the manual baseline
background noise was reduced for all channels but the Ct values for all samples were
changed, in some cases more than 2Cts. This resulted in a false positive for PIV-1 in a PIV-2
sample. This did not occur with the auto baseline setting. Therefore the auto baseline setting
was used for all future analysis and is the chosen baseline setting in the package insert.
Signal Threshold:
For the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Instrument, the threshold is defined as the level of fluorescence
above which the ABI 7500 Fast Dx software will assign a “positive” call. The software uses
the baseline and threshold values to calculate the threshold cycle (Ct).
On the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Platform, PIV-1 and PIV-3 targets required no threshold changes
from the default threshold of 1.00E+05 baseline-corrected normalized reporter units (∆Rn).
However, the initial PIV-2 target threshold of 1.00E+05 ∆Rn resulted in a loss of one
positive specimen previously determined positive by culture with DFA confirmation. After
re-analyzing the PIV-2 target using a lower threshold (8.00E+04 ∆Rn), this specimen had a
detectable Ct value. Therefore, the data indicated that lowering the threshold for this target
would allow for maximum sensitivity to detect late positive specimens, but did not decrease
specificity (no false positives were detected with the lower threshold). The threshold for

PIV-3 (1.60E+05 ∆Rn) was raised to compensate for excess background fluorescence noise
resulting from the auto baseline setting in this channel. These threshold levels are the levels
used for all future analysis and are the chosen threshold settings in the package insert.
Cut-Off:
The cut-off was determined using the threshold for PIV-1 (1.00E+05), PIV-2 (8.00E+04) and
PIV-3 (1.60E+05). Auto baseline was used for all targets. These conditions follow the
package insert directions. Most Ct values were recorded between 18-27 cycles; however, at
least 15 percent of samples were recorded after 30 cycles. The figure below shows the Ct
Distribution for all three PIV targets from the ABI 7500 Fast Dx. The highest Ct value was
detected at 44 cycles. The Ct range on this platform was from 17 cycles to 44 cycles,
indicating that the cutoff should be at 45 cycles. Forty five cycles is the cut-off indicated in
the package insert.
c. Stability:
Kit Stability:
Three kit lots were used to determine the real-time stability of the kit reagents when being
stored at 4°C. PIV-1, PIV-2 and PIV-3 samples were tested at 2x LoD for each time point.
Testing was conducted on days 0, 5, 7, 10, 15, 21, 38, 56, 76 and 90 (3 months), testing was
then conducted monthly from months 4-11 and will continue through month 25. The
following strains were used; Parainfluenza-1 strain C35, Parainfluenza-2 strain Greer,
Parainfluenza-3 strain C243. Testing was conducted according to the directions in the
package insert. Testing showed there was no change in Ct value greater than 3 Ct, which
would indicate a significant change in detection and loss of stability, during the first 11
months of storage. Stability of the kit will be listed as 12 months in the package insert, and
will be modified as more real time stability data is available.
Rehydrated Master Mix Stability:
The stability of rehydrated master mix, when stored at -20°C, 4°C, and at room temperature,
was determined in this study. Testing was conducted on the ABI 7500 Dx according to the
package instructions. Parainfluenza-1 strain C35, Parainfluenza-2 strain Greer,
Parainfluenza-3 strain C243 were tested at 2x LoD. Testing for the 4°C and room
7

--- Page 8 ---
temperature conditions was performed at 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 24, 28, 48, 52, 72 and 76 hours.
Testing for the -20°C condition was performed at 24, 28, 48, 52, 72 and 76 hours. Viral
RNA was extracted only once (a minimum of 24 extractions), the RNA was then pooled,
aliquoted and stored at -70°C until used. Each strain was tested in triplicate, with three
separate vials of rehydrated master mix, for every time and temperature condition. At the
end of each incubation period an aliquot of viral RNA was added to the rehydrated Master
Mix and loaded into the ABI 7500 Dx. The time point selected for stability claims in the
package insert is the time point one point earlier than where all replicates were not detected.
The table below shows the stability of the rehydrated Master Mix.
Storage Temperature Stability Time Limit
Room Temperature 2 hours
2-8°C 4 hours
-20°C 52 hours
Extracted Specimen Stability:
The stability of extracted samples was tested at Room Temperature, 4°C, -20°C, and -70°C at
various time points. Testing was conducted on the ABI 7500 Dx according to the package
instructions. Parainfluenza-1 strain C35, Parainfluenza-2 strain Greer, and Parainfluenza-3
strain C243 were prepared at 3X LoD in negative nasal matrix and used in this study. Sufficient
volume was prepared to extract RNA for testing all time points. Samples stored at -20°C and -
70°C were also tested for stability after 1, 2, and 3 freeze/thaw cycles. The table below
shows the different time points tested for each temperature. Testing showed that there was
no change in Ct value greater than 3 Ct, which would indicate a significant change in
detection and loss of stability, at any of the time points tested. The package insert will list
the stability of extracted RNA as stable if stored at Room Temperature, 4°C, -20°C and -
70°C for up to 30 days.

d. Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
No external controls are provided with this assay.
There is an internal control called the ‘process control’ (PRC). It is the MS2 bacteriophage
(Zeptometrix) which is a single stranded RNA virus that can be extracted, amplified, and
detected by primers and probes included in the master mix. Detection of the PRC indicates
that assay conditions allowed proper sample extraction, amplification, and detection.

The limit of detection (LOD) (defined as the lowest TCID /mL that is detected ≥95% of the
50
time) of the Lyra Parainfluenza Virus Assay was determined on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx platform
using three separate validation lots of lyophilized master mix and limiting dilutions of viral
stocks. Parainfluenza-1 strain C35, Parainfluenza-2 strain Greer, and Parainfluenza-3 strain
C243 were used in this study. Twenty replicates for each dilution of each parainfluenza virus
type were prepared and tested. Viral stocks were diluted in negative nasal matrix and then
extracted and stored for up to one month at -70°C. Testing was then conducted according to the
package insert. Data showing the results for each parainfluenza virus strain using each validation
lot was provided at one concentration above and below the determined LoD. The table below
shows the LoD determined for each parainfluenza virus type.
Virus LoD on ABI 7500 Fast Dx Average Ct Value at LoD

Parainfluenza-3, strain C243 80 TCID /mL 38.1

f. Analytical Inclusivity:
In silico analysis to demonstrate inclusivity for all three parainfluenza virus types was
performed. No laboratory studies were performed because there are a very limited number of
characterized strains of any human parainfluenza virus type. In silico analysis was
performed comparing the sequence of the chosen target region for each parainfluenza virus
type with the NCBI database for human parainfluenza virus sequences. Three hundred and
eight human parainfluenza virus type 1, 458 human parainfluenza virus type 2, and 509
parainfluenza virus type 3 full-genome sequences were analyzed. Primers and probes were
designed against consensus sequences found for each virus type and have 100% homology to
all sequences analyzed but do not have homology with other parainfluenza virus types.
Therefore, in silico analysis and primer and probe design demonstrates that the assay should
detect all human parainfluenza viruses of types 1, 2, and 3.

This study was designed to determine potential cross-reactivity of the assay with non-
parainfluenza respiratory viruses, yeast, and bacteria. Organisms were sourced from DHI,
Zeptometrix, or ATCC. Bacteria were tested at 1.00E+6 cfu/ml or higher and viruses were
tested at 1.00E+05 TCID50.mL or higher, stock concentrations permitting. Stocks were
diluted in negative nasal matrix and the samples were extracted and amplified according to
the package insert instructions. All samples were tested in triplicate starting from the
extraction step. The results were analyzed for any cross-reactivity for all three parainfluenza
virus types and are listed below. No Cross-reactivity was observed in this study.

Microbial Interference:
Parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3 were spiked with clinically relevant concentrations of
viruses, bacteria or yeast in order to evaluate possible interference from organisms not
targeted by the assay. Parainfluenza virus types were used at a 2X LoD concentration; all
dilutions were made in negative nasal matrix. Clinically relevant levels of viruses and
bacteria were used when stock concentrations permitted. Samples were extracted and
amplified according to the package insert instructions. All samples were tested in triplicate
starting from the extraction step. The results were analyzed for any interference with any of
the three parainfluenza virus types. The final concentration tested and results are listed in the
table below. No interference was observed in the study.

The results indicate that competitive interference exists for PIV-1 when combined with
PIV-2 at a concentration 1.25 x107TCID or greater and at 4.0 x106TCID or greater
50 50
when combined with PIV-3. When evaluating PIV-2, it was determined that interference
existed when combined with PIV-3 at a concentration 4.0 x106 TCID or greater. No
50
interference was seen when PIV-2 was combined with PIV-1. For PIV-3, there was
competitive interference when combined with PIV-2 at a concentration of 1.25 x107
TCID or greater. No interference was seen when PIV-3 was combined with PIV-1.
50
For all virus combinations, detectable interference was seen at concentrations equal to or
greater than 4.0 x106 TCID . These titers are high and not likely to be found in clinical
50
samples; it is therefore highly unlikely that competitive interference will be seen in the
clinical settings. A limitation indicating competitive interference at high concentrations
will be included in the package insert.
h. Interfering Substances:
A study was conducted to demonstrate that the Lyra Parainfluenza Virus Assay
specifically detects parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3 in the presence of clinically
relevant concentrations of potentially interfering substances. To prepare samples for
testing, parainfluenza virus at 4x LoD in negative nasal matrix was diluted 1:1 with
each test substance. The final concentration after dilution for each substance is listed
in the table below and the final concentration of parainfluenza virus was 2x LoD.
Each mixed sample was then extracted and tested according to the package insert.
Ct values for all testing were reported and there was no significant change from the control.
No interference was detected in the presence of any of the substances tested.

i. Carry-Over/Cross-Contamination:
Simulated parainfluenza high positive samples were analyzed in series alternating with negative
samples (checkerboard pattern) in order to determine whether carry-over/cross-contamination
occurs with the use of the Lyra Parainfluenza Virus Assay. The high positive samples in this
study were at concentration of 1.0 x 105 TCID /mL in negative nasal matrix. Parainfluenza-1,
50
Parainfluenza-2, and Parainfluenza-3 analytes were combined into one sample for this study.
Samples were processed and tested according to the package insert. Testing was performed on 5
separate days where each 96-well plate contained 48 high positive samples alternating with 48
negative samples (negative nasal matrix only). No cross-contamination was observed during the
study. All negative samples tested had negative results and all high positive samples had all three
parainfluenza viruses detected.

b. Matrix comparison:
This study was designed to verify that the assay does not have variable performance
when samples are transported in various viral transport media. Parainfluenza-1 strain
C35, Parainfluenza-2 strain Greer, Parainfluenza-3 strain C243 were used in this study.
Viruses were diluted in the transport media to 2x LoD and testing was performed using six
replicates per virus/media combination.
Transport PIV-1 PIV-2 PIV-3

M4-RT Remel 35.2 33.8 34.8
M5 Remel 34.5 34.1 33.9
M6 Remel 33.8 34.0 34.3
Varying the transport media did not affect the performance of this assay, with no
observed changes in the Ct value. The data demonstrates that all transport media
included in the study are suitable for use with the Lyra Parainfluenza Virus assay.
c. Fresh vs. Frozen sample comparison:
Parainfluenza virus stocks were diluted to 2X and 5X LoD using negative nasal matrix. The
five panels created contained 2X LoD (combined PIV-1, PIV-2 and PIV-3), 5X LoD
(combined PIV-1, PIV-2 and PIV-3) and negative samples. Each panel consisted of 30
aliquots of 5X LoD, 30 aliquots of 2X LoD and 10 aliquots of negative nasal matrix. Panel 1
was extracted on the day of preparation. Panels 2 and 3 were stored at 4°C and then extracted
on day 7 and 8, respectively. Panels 4 and 5 were stored at -20°C and then extracted on day 7
and 8, respectively. A single replicate of each panel member was extracted and tested
according to the instructions in the package insert.

among all conditions. The data presented demonstrates that the performance of this test with
frozen samples is equal to the performance with fresh samples.
3. Clinical studies:
The evaluation of the Lyra™ Parainfluenza Virus Assay occurred in two separate studies:
a prospective multi-center study using 1241 fresh specimens from the upper respiratory
tract; and a retrospective study using 105 frozen specimens from the upper respiratory
tract. In both studies the bioMérieux NucliSENS® easyMag® was used at all sites for the
extraction of nucleic acids from the clinical specimens. The Applied Biosystems® 7500
Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument was used with the Lyra™ Parainfluenza Virus Assay
for the amplification and detection of the target nucleic acids.
The prospective specimens were also tested with direct specimen fluorescent antibody
(DSFA) and cell culture with DFA (CCFA). Specimens for DSFA and CCFA were
shipped to central location daily with cold packs, and were cultured within 72- hours of
collection. The DSFA and CCFA of the specimens were performed at a central location,
DHI reference laboratory (Diagnostic Hybrids, Athens, Ohio).
The study utilized fresh and frozen specimens from the 2013 and 2014 respiratory seasons.
Clinical samples were collected at three geographically diverse locations, all clinical
laboratories
Prospective Study:
A prospective study was conducted with 1241 fresh specimens from male and female
patients with age range of ≤2 to 102 years. The table below shows the age and gender
distribution of the patients in this study.

Similar performance was observed at the 3 clinical sites participating in the study during the
2013 and 2014 respiratory seasons. Therefore, performance results from all sites were pooled
and the summary data for PIV-1, PIV-2 and PIV-3 are presented in the tables below.

for instrument control, data collection and data analysis. The software can measure cycle-by-
cycle real-time signals from the sample. The software provides a variety of tools to help the
user analyze the data extracted from the samples. The software also provides lamp-life
monitoring and other instrument maintenance information. The software runs as an
application on a Windows operating system.
3. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification is described in the “Test Principle” and “Baseline, Threshold, Cut-
off” sections of this document.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
All specimen sampling and handling is manual.
5. Calibration:
N/A
6. Quality Control:
An internal control ‘process control’ (PRC) is included in the device. It is the MS2
bacteriophage (Zeptometrix) which is a single stranded RNA virus that can be extracted,
amplified and detected by primers and probes included in the master mix. Detection of the
PRC indicates that assay conditions allowed proper sample extraction, amplification and
detection.
No external controls are provided with this assay, but they are available from Quidel.
External controls for PIV-1, PIV-2 and PIV-3 from the Lyra Parainfluenza Control Set
#M1XX are recommended to serve as external positive controls. Laboratories may use
previously characterized specimens that are negative for PIV-1, PIV-2 and PIV-3 as negative
controls.
