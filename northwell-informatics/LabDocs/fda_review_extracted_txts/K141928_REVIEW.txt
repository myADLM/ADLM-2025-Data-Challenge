I. Device Description:
The cobas c Acetaminophen Gen.2 assay consists of reagents packaged in a cassette labeled
with their instrument positioning, R1 (Reagent 1) and R2 (Reagent 2).
· R1 contains anti-acetaminophen antibody (sheep polyclonal), Glucose-6-phosphate,
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), bovine serum albumin, preservatives
(Proclin), and stabilizers (pepstatin and aprotinin).
· R2 contains acetaminophen labeled with bacterial Glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase, Tris buffer, preservatives (Sodium Azide and 2-methyl-2H-
isothiazol-3-one (MIT)) bovine serum albumin, and stabilizers (pepstatin and
aprotinin).
The ACET2 calibrator contains a known quantity of acetaminophen (~200 µg/mL), sodium
phosphate, sodium EDTA, sodium chloride (NaCl), and preservatives (Proclin and MIT).
The cobas c 501 analyzer dilutes the ACET2 calibrator on-board the analyzer with NaCl
diluent, in order to create five concentration levels (level 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) containing 10,
30.2, 75.0, 100, and 200 µg/mL of acetaminophen, respectively. Level 1 contains no
acetaminophen.

L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay technique used for the
quantitative analysis of acetaminophen in human serum or plasma. The assay is based on
competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-
phoshate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for antibody binding sites. Enzyme activity decreases
upon binding to the antibody, so the drug concentration in the sample can be measured in
terms of enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts oxidized nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that is measured
spectrophotmetrically (at 415 nm and 340 nm).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
All performance studies were conducted with the Roche Hitachi cobas c 501 clinical
chemistry analyzer.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the Acetaminophen Gen.2 assay was evaluated with a 21-day precision study
according to CLSI EP05-A2, using control material as well as pooled human sera
samples (from patients taking acetaminophen). The acetaminophen concentrations of all
tested samples are noted in the table below. All samples were tested using 3 reagent kit
lots, with 2 replicates per run and 2 runs per day. Data from all lots tested were similar.
Data from a representative lot is presented below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was assessed in a study using serum and Li-Heparin plasma samples
containing acetaminophen concentrations across the measuring range of the assay (5-
200 µg/mL acetaminophen). Samples were prepared by 13 dilutions of a high
concentration sample with an acetaminophen free sample. Expected concentrations
were determined based on the known value of the commercially available standard
material values and the dilution factors. Samples were analyzed in triplicate. Percent
recoveries relative to the expected concentrations are shown below for serum and Li-
Heparin plasma. Results support linearity across the measuring range.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The cobas c Acetaminophen Gen.2 assay is calibrated using a calibrator that was
previously cleared under k002974. The Roche ACET2 calibrator is prepared
gravimetrically from commercially available purified materials. See k002974 for
traceability and stability information.
d. Detection limit:
LoB, LoD, and LoQ studies were performed based upon CLSI EP17-A2.
LoB Protocol
One analyte-free sample was measured in replicates of 5 for 2 runs on 2 analyzers for
3 days for each of 3 reagent lots (for total n=60 per lot). The LoB was determined to
be 1.5 µg/mL .
LoD Protocol
Five low-analyte samples spiked with acetaminophen were measured with 1
determination per run (2 runs) on two analyzers with 3 reagent lots for six runs per
day across three days. This study yielded a LoD of 3 µg/mL.

LoQ Protocol
A set of six low-level samples was measured in two aliquots using 3 lots over at least
6 days (n=12 for each low-level sample). The total number of measurements made
for each lot was 72.
Bias was determined by the difference between average and target values. The target
values were determined by a chromatography system. Standard deviations were
determined over all replicates for each lot. The following results were observed.

Cross reactivity with compounds of similar structure were evaluated by using serum
sample pools, with two acetaminophen target concentrations (~5.0 and ~30.0 µg/mL).
Test samples included the acetaminophen plus potential cross-reactant (at the
concentrations shown below). Control samples contained corresponding
concentrations of acetaminophen without potential interferents. The table below

The assay was also evaluated with hemoglobin (hemolysis), lipids (lipemia), and
bilirubin (Icterus) for potential interferences with the measurement of acetaminophen
using serum sample pools. Evaluation of interference included normal levels of
bilirubin and lipids (triglycerides). Recoveries of acetaminophen were within the
sponsor’s acceptance criteria of ± 10%. No interference was noted when tested up to

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison test was performed on the Roche/Hitachi cobas c 501 analyzer
by testing 117 human serum samples in singlicate on the Acetaminophen Gen.2 assay
and the predicate device. The samples ranged in concentration from 5.2 to 198
µg/mL. An additional set of eleven native serum samples from individual patients
taking acetaminophen were spiked with a stock solution of 4 mg/mL acetaminophen
in NaCl so concentrations were above the measuring range of the assay. These
samples were spiked with a minimal volume of the stock solution, so that dilution
effects were minimized. Deming regression analysis resulted in a slope of 1.02, a y-
intercept of -0.699, and a correlation coefficient of 0.997. Ninety-five percent
confidence intervals for the y-intercept and slope were -0.981 to -0.417 and 1.005 to
1.030, respectively.
b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison studies were performed for Li-Heparin plasma vs serum, K -
2
EDTA plasma vs serum, and K -EDTA plasma vs. serum. A total of 50 tubes were
3
collected per anticoagulant and percent recovery was determined. All percent
recoveries were within ± 10%.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Normal therapeutic doses of acetaminophen result in serum concentrations of 10-30
µg/mL (66-199 µmol/L) in healthy adults. (From Jacobs DS, DeMott WR, Grad HI, et
al. Laboratory Test Handbook 5th ed. Stow, Ohio: Lexi Comp Inc 2001;768).
Toxic manifestations have been observed at serum concentrations > 100 µg/mL ,
however the toxic range is generally reported at > 200 µg/mL . Toxic concentrations can
be more effectively related to post dose interval; > 200, > 100, and > 50 µg/mL serum
concentrations at 4, 8, and 12 hours post dose, respectively. (Rumack BH.
Acetaminophen overdose. Arch Intern Med 1981 ;141 :380)
Each laboratory should investigate the transferability of the expected values of its own
patient population and if necessary determine its own reference ranges.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
