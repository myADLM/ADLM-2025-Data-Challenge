The Lyra™ Adenovirus Assay is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in vitro
diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of human adenovirus (HAdV) viral DNA isolated
from nasal and nasopharyngeal swab specimens obtained from individuals exhibiting signs
and symptoms of acute respiratory infections. The intended use of this test is to aid in the
diagnosis of HAdV in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings.
The test detects, but does not differentiate HAdV species (A, B, C, D, E, and F) or serotypes
(HAdV 1-52).
Negative results do not preclude HAdV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for
diagnosis, treatment or other patient management decisions.

I. Device Description:
The Lyra Adenovirus Assay detects viral nucleic acid that has been extracted from a patient
sample using the NucliSENS easyMAG automated extraction platform. The assay includes a
Process Control (PRC) that is added prior to the extraction procedure. The PRC acts as an
extraction and amplification control.
Real-time PCR is used to generate and detect amplicons for the target virus and the PRC.
This reaction is performed using the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument (“ABI
7500 Fast Dx”).

--- Page 3 ---
During amplification, a DNA polymerase cleaves the sequence-specific probes that have
hybridized to the adenoviral and PRC DNA. This enzymatic step generates a fluorescent
signal as, when the probe is cleaved, the fluorescent dye is separated from the quencher dye.
The fluorescent signal intensity grows as the reaction proceeds and the number of cleaved
probe molecules increases with each thermal cycle. A positive signal for human Adenovirus
(HAdV) and the PRC are achieved when the fluorescent signals reach a certain level above
the threshold. The results of the Lyra Adenovirus Assay are recorded and analyzed by the
ABI 7500 Fast Dx Software (version 1.4 or higher) and then reported to the user.

L. Test Principle:
This is a nucleic acid based test using real-time PCR. Infection with HAdV is detected
through the use of PCR to amplify and detect viral DNA. The DNA sequence for the viral
penton base gene is amplified and detected using a sequence-specific probe that is cleaved
during PCR amplification, resulting in a signal that occurs when the fluorescent reporter dye
is released from the quencher.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility
The reproducibility study was performed with contrived samples extracted using the
bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG System and tested on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx
Instrument. Reproducibility was assessed at three separate sites (two external, one in-
house) where two users at each site tested each virus sample in triplicate over five non-
consecutive days (2 operators x 3 aliquots x 5 days x 3 sites = 90 replicates total for each
panel member). The four member reproducibility panel consisted of a negative sample
(HAdV Negative Nasal Matrix), a high negative (0.5X LoD), low positive/close to the
limit of detection (2X LoD), and moderate positive (5X LoD) sample. To create the
positive panel members, HAdV species A (serotype 31) was diluted in a pooled negative
nasal matrix. The positive and negative controls used in this study were from the Lyra
Adenovirus Control Set (HAdV Positive Control and HAdV Negative Control,
respectively).
The reproducibility panel members were randomized, blinded, stored at -70°C, and
delivered to the testing sites frozen. Each day, the samples were extracted using the
bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG System. The extracted nucleic acids were tested with
the Lyra Adenovirus Assay on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx. A single lot of kits was used to test
reproducibility at each of the three sites.
The data (summarized in Table 1 below) demonstrates good reproducibility as overall

Precision
Precision was assessed at a single site (in-house) where two users performed extraction
and PCR on contrived samples once a day for 12 non-consecutive days. Each virus
sample was tested in triplicate (2 operators x 3 aliquots x 12 days = 72 replicates total for
each panel member). The four member precision panel consisted of a negative sample
(HAdV negative nasal matrix), a high negative (0.5X LoD), low positive/close to the
limit of detection (2X LoD), and moderate positive (5X LoD) sample. To create the
positive panel members, HAdV species A (serotype 31) was diluted in a pooled negative
nasal matrix. Panel members were stored at -70°C until the time of extraction and testing.
The positive and negative controls used in this study were from the Lyra Adenovirus
Control Set.
The data (summarized in Table 2 below) demonstrates good reproducibility as overall
percent agreement for the Lyra Adenovirus Assay was 100% with overall % CV across
operators for all samples and controls ranging from 1.0% to 3.4% depending on the
concentration tested.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
1. The kit contains an internal process control (PRC), consisting of the MS2
Bacteriophage. It is incorporated into every sample and is carried through all steps
of the procedure from nucleic acid isolation and purification through
amplification. The PRC serves as a general process control to ensure that each
step of the procedure was performed correctly and that general reagents are
working.
2. The package insert for this assay includes a reference to an optional external
control set (the Lyra Adenovirus Control Set, #M110).
Fresh vs. Frozen Study
Five viral panels were created by diluting HAdV species A (type 31) in pooled negative
nasal matrix. Panel 1 was extracted and tested on the day of preparation. Panels 2 and 3
were stored at 4°C and then extracted and tested on days 7 and 8, respectively. Panels 4
and 5 were stored at -20°C and then extracted and tested on days 7 and 8, respectively.
Each panel consisted of 30 low positive samples (2X LoD), 30 moderate positive (5X
LoD) samples, and 10 negative samples. Each panel member was extracted and tested
with the Lyra Adenovirus Assay in singlet. The negative control consisted of HAdV
negative nasal matrix. The positive control included in the study was from the Lyra
Adenovirus Control Set.
Data collected from these samples met the acceptance criteria of ≥ 95% agreement
between results obtained on date of preparation and after storage. This indicates that
storage of samples at either 4° or -20°C for up to 8 days does not impact the ability of the
Lyra Adenovirus Assay to detect HAdV in low and moderate positive samples.
Master Mix Stability after Rehydration
An evaluation of master mix stability was carried out using a single lot of master mix that
was rehydrated and stored at -20°C, 4°C, and at room temperature. After storage at time
points ranging from 1 to 76 hours, the master mix was used to test samples that were low
positive (2X LoD) for HAdV species E (type 4). A single working stock of HAdV

positive sample was created by diluting HAdV type 4 in negative nasal matrix, then
extracting the viral DNA and storing it at -70°C until the time of testing.
Three vials of master mix were tested at each time point and temperature combination.
Each vial was tested in triplicate. The negative control consisted of HAdV negative nasal
matrix. The positive control included in the study was from the Lyra Adenovirus Control
Set.
Data collected from these samples met the acceptance criteria of ≤ 3 Cts between results
obtained at time 0 versus after storage. This indicates that storage of rehydrated master
mix at room temperature for up to 4 hours or at 4° or -20°C for up to 3 days does not
impact the ability of the Lyra Adenovirus Assay to detect HAdV in low positive samples.
Extracted Specimen Stability
Stability of extracted specimens was tested with samples that were low positive (3X
LoD) for HAdV species E (type 4). A single working stock of HAdV positive samples
was created by diluting HAdV type 4 in negative nasal matrix, then extracting the viral
DNA. Aliquots were stored at various temperatures and then tested with the Lyra
Adenovirus Assay in triplicate at the time points described in the table below.
Table 3 – Time Points Tested in Extracted Specimen Stability Study
All samples tested in this study met the acceptance criteria of ˂ 3 Cts between results
obtained at time 0 versus results after storage. This indicates that the following storage
conditions are acceptable for extracted samples: 1) storage at room temperature, 4°,
-20°C, or -80°C for up to 31 days and 2) up to three freeze/thaw cycles.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection (LoD)
The LoD was determined using one type from each of the six HAdV serotypes (A-F). For
each virus serotype 2-fold serial dilutions were prepared. Twenty aliquots were extracted
from each dilution and stored at -70°C until testing with the Lyra Adenovirus Assay on
the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Instrument. The LoD was determined to be the lowest titer at
which the virus was detected greater than 95% of the time. For confirmation purposes, at
least one dilution higher than the LoD was included in the study for each serotype.

e. Analytical specificity:
Microbial Interference
This study was conducted to evaluate the potential for false negative results when non-
target pathogens are present at high concentrations in a HAdV low positive sample. A
panel of 57 microorganisms (30 viruses, 26 bacteria, and 1 yeast) representing common
respiratory pathogens or flora commonly present in the nasopharynx was evaluated. This
57 member panel was created and tested three times, once in the presence of HAdV type
4, once in the presence of HAdV type 31, and once in the absence of adenoviruses
(negative nasal matrix).
For the 57 member panel, the level of each microorganism was determined by growing
and titering the microorganism listed; the exceptions were Coronavirus NL63, Epstein
Barr Virus, Measles, Mumps virus, Parainfluenza Type 4A, Chlamydophila pneumonia,
and Mycoplasma pneumoniae for which the original titer provided by the supplier was
used. Each potential cross reactant was individually spiked at a high level into a negative
swab matrix and then added to either a HAdV type 4 or HAdV type 31 working stock
(20X LoD virus diluted in negative nasal matrix). In the final solution, the concentration
was 2X LoD for HAdV.
Bacteria and yeast were tested at concentrations of 106 to 108 CFU/mL; the exceptions
were Chlamydia pneumonia (19.8 ng/mL) and Mycoplasma pneumonia (2.82 x 106 Color
Changing Units/mL). Viruses were tested at concentrations of 103 to 108 TCID /mL; the
50
exception was Epstein Barr Virus (8.34 x 107 copies/mL). Microorganism DNA was
extracted from these solutions and stored at -80°C until samples were tested in triplicate
with the Lyra Adenovirus Assay.
The negative control used in this study consisted of HAdV negative nasal matrix. The
positive control consisted of either HAdV type 4 or type 31 diluted in negative nasal

The results (below in Table 5) showed that all HAdV positive samples remained positive,
indicating that there was no interference with the results of the Lyra Adenovirus Assay
when the microorganisms tested were present at high concentrations.
Cross-Reactivity
This study was conducted to evaluate the potential for false positive results when non-
target pathogens are present at high concentrations in a HAdV negative sample. A panel
57 microorganisms (30 viruses, 26 bacteria, and one yeast) was evaluated.
For the 57 member panel, the level of each microorganism was determined by growing
and titering the microorganism listed; the exceptions were Coronavirus NL63, Epstein
Barr Virus, Measles, Mumps virus, Parainfluenza Type 4A, Chlamydophila pneumonia,
and Mycoplasma pneumoniae for which the original titer provided by the supplier was
used. Each potential cross reactant was individually spiked at a high level into a negative
swab matrix. Bacteria and yeast were tested at concentrations of 106 to 109 CFU/mL; the
exceptions were Chlamydia pneumonia (0.11 ng/mL) and Mycoplasma pneumonia (3.16
x 106 Color Changing Units/mL). Viruses were tested at concentrations of 104 to 108
TCID /mL; the exception was Epstein Barr Virus (9.27 x 107 copies/mL).

Microorganism DNA was extracted with the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG System
and then stored at -80°C until samples were tested in triplicate with the Lyra Adenovirus
Assay on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Instrument.
The negative control used in this study consisted of HAdV negative nasal matrix. The
positive control consisted of HAdV type 4 diluted in negative nasal matrix at a
concentration of 5X LoD with no other microorganisms present.
The results (below in Table 5) showed that all HAdV negative samples remained
negative, indicating that the Lyra Adenovirus Assay did not cross-react with any of the
microorganisms tested.

Interfering Substances
An interfering substances study was carried out to examine whether a panel of 11
endogenous and exogenous potential PCR inhibitors affected the performance of the Lyra
Adenovirus Assay. The panel consisted of substances such as blood, mucin, or
medications (prescription and over-the-counter) for relief of congestion, sore throat,
allergy, and asthma symptoms (concentrations tested are listed in Table 6 below).

Each of the 11 panel members were diluted individually in negative nasal matrix and then
tested three times, once in the presence of HAdV type 4, once in the presence of HAdV
type 31, and once in negative matrix only (no virus added). In the HAdV positive
samples, the virus concentration tested was 2X LoD. Microorganism DNA was extracted
with the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG System and then stored at -80°C until
samples were tested in triplicate with the Lyra Adenovirus Assay on the ABI 7500 Fast
Dx Instrument.

The results of this study showed that all HAdV negative samples remained negative and
all HAdV positive samples remained positive, indicating that there was no assay
interference from any of the substances tested.
Inclusivity
Reactivity of the Lyra Adenovirus Assay was established in the LoD study with one type
from each of the six HAdV serotypes (A-F). An inclusivity study was conducted to test
reactivity of the Lyra Adenovirus Assay with the 52 other known HAdV types.
Forty nine (49) HAdV types were tested initially at a concentration of 2X the serotype
LoD (established in the LoD study above). One sample was generated for each HAdV
type by spiking cultured and titered virus into negative nasal matrix. Viral DNA was
extracted with the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG System. Each extract was tested in
triplicate. Higher concentrations (range of 6-250 X LoD) were tested if the organism was

b HAdV-15 required repeat testing and was ultimately found to be detected at 6X LoD.
c HAdV-17 required repeat testing and was ultimately found to be detected at 6X LoD.
All of the 49 HAdV types tested (above) were detected by the Lyra Adenovirus Assay.
Three types were not detected at 2X LoD. These types were subjected to repeat analysis
and were ultimately detected at 250X LoD (ADV-21/Serotype B) and 6X LoD (ADV-
ADV-15 and ADV-17/Serotype D) for their respective serotypes.
HAdV Species D serotypes 38 and 42 and Species G serotype 52 (often associated with
conjunctivitis and gastroenteritis) were not evaluated for inclusivity as the sponsor could
not obtain these strains. Instead, the manufacturer conducted an in silico analysis where
they aligned their probe and primers with the target regions from a single sequence
(obtained from GenBank) for each of these adenovirus types. The alignments showed a
100% agreement of the forward primer with types 38, 42, and 52. For the reverse primer,
three mismatches were detected in the sequences for types 38 and 42 (84% homology)
and two mismatches with the sequence for type 52 (89.5% homology). For the probe,
there was 100% agreement with types 38 and 42 while three mismatches were observed
with the sequence for type 52 (85% homology).
Carry-Over
The carry-over study was designed to uncover the presence of contamination in negative
specimens due to carry-over of virus during nucleic acid extraction and PCR
amplification. The study was conducted by alternately placing high positive (1.0 x 105
TCID /mL HAdV type 4 diluted in negative nasal matrix) and negative specimens
50
(negative nasal matrix) in each well of the PCR plate. All samples were extracted and
tested fresh.

A total of 48 high positives and 48 negatives were tested in each run, with a total of five
runs, each run on a separate day (48 x 5 = 240 samples total). All 240 replicates of
negative sample were “Not Detected,” therefore, no evidence of carry-over was observed.
f. Assay cut-off:
Baseline
The initial baseline assessment was conducted with a manual baseline setting (starting at
Ct 3.0 and ending at Ct 15.0). A total of 34 positive and 31 negative clinical specimens
were used for the analysis. Testing indicated that the use of the manual baseline resulted
in decreased sensitivity for HAdV positive specimens as three out of five culture negative
specimens (with direct fluorescence antigen confirmation) were detected as positive with
the Lyra Adenovirus Assay on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Instrument. Additional testing
showed that four of the culture negative specimens were detected as positive by the
Prodesse ProAdeno+ Assay on the Cepheid SmartCycler II. As a result, the baseline was
changed to an auto baseline to resolve these results. The clinical specimens were tested
again to verify that the change had no effect on the detection of the PRC and HAdV
culture positive specimens.
Threshold
For the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Instrument, the threshold is defined as the level of
fluorescence above which the ABI 7500 Fast Dx software will assign a “positive” call.
The software uses the baseline and threshold values to calculate the threshold cycle (Ct).
When the panel of clinical specimens (described above) was tested with the Lyra
Adenovirus Assay on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Instrument using the auto baseline setting,
one of the adenovirus positive specimens did not cross the threshold and was therefore
reported as negative. This indicated that the use of the initial threshold setting (8.00 x 104
baseline-corrected normalized reporter units; ∆Rn) could result in decreased sensitivity
for HAdV positive specimens. An analysis was conducted to compare the results of the
initial threshold setting with a new, lower threshold setting (6.50 x 104 ∆Rn) for the ABI
7500 Fast Dx Instrument. Retesting of the clinical specimens confirmed that the HAdV
positive specimen crossed the new threshold and was reported as positive. This change
did not affect the detection of the PRC.
Ct Cut-Off
A Ct cut-off study was conducted prior to the initiation of the clinical study. The clinical
specimens from the baseline and threshold analyses were evaluated for their range in Ct
values to determine the appropriate cut-off for the assay. The majority of samples were
detected around or before 25 cycles. The highest Ct value detected was 33. The cut-off
was set at 35 cycles because an earlier cut-off could result in decreased sensitivity for
HAdV positive specimens.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison was based on the results from the Lyra Adenovirus Assay on the
ABI 7500 Fast Dx Instrument compared to the results obtained from direct specimen
fluorescent antibody (DSFA) and cell culture with direct fluorescent antigen (DFA). The
testing description and data are listed in the Clinical Studies section (below).
b. Matrix comparison:
A transport media study was conducted to show compatibility of five different types of
viral transport media (VTM) with the Lyra Adenovirus Assay. The five VTM tested were
Remel MicroTest M4, M4-RT, M5, and M6, and Universal Transport Medium (UTM)
from Copan or Diagnostics Hybrids Inc.
Low positive (2X LoD) HAdV samples were created by diluting HAdV type 4 or type 31
in transport media. All samples were extracted and then tested immediately afterwards. A
blank extraction control (VTM with no virus added) was included for each type of
transport media. For each virus and VTM combination, three separate extractions were
conducted. Each extract was tested in duplicate (3 extractions x 2 replicates = 6 replicates
tested for each virus and media combination). Results are shown in Table 9.

The “Theoretical Average Ct Value” represents the average Ct value obtained in other analytical studies from HAdV
tested in nasal swab matrix only (no transport media).
The five VTM sample types demonstrated comparable performance, indicating that the
Lyra Adenovirus Assay is compatible with Remel MicroTest M4, M4-RT, M5, and M6,
and Universal Transport Medium (UTM) from Copan or Diagnostics Hybrids Inc.

study with fresh samples collected at three sites in the United States during the winter of
2013 (January 2013) and the winter of 2014 (December 2013 until February 2014). Due
to the overall low prevalence of HAdV, these samples were supplemented with
retrospective frozen samples collected at one site in the United States on dates ranging
from May 2012 until February 2014.
For the prospective study, performance of the Lyra Adenovirus Assay on the ABI 7500
Fast Dx Instrument was compared to an FDA-cleared direct detection kit for respiratory
specimens. The kit is a composite method of viral culture with direct fluorescent antigen
staining (CDFA) followed by direct fluorescent antibody staining of the specimen
(SDFA). A specimen was called positive if either the CDFA or the SDFA were positive.
For a specimen to be called negative, it must be negative for both CDFA and SDFA.
All samples used for this study were remnants of nasal and nasopharyngeal swab
specimens that were collected from symptomatic individuals for routine analysis and that
otherwise would have been discarded. All clinical sites were granted waivers of informed
consent by their IRBs for this study. Inclusion criteria included: samples were submitted
to the testing laboratory by an ordering physician from patients with signs and symptoms
of acute respiratory illness. Exclusion criteria included: inadequate specimen volume,
specimen inappropriately stored or shipped.
Sites 2 and 3 performed the extraction and testing for all samples collected at those sites.
Specimens collected at site 1 were sent to an in-house testing laboratory where they were
extracted and tested using the Lyra Adenovirus Assay. The samples were extracted
within 72 hours of collection using the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMag System and then
tested using the Lyra Adenovirus Assay run on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Instrument.
All reference testing with the comparator method was conducted at an in-house testing
laboratory. Specimens were shipped to this location daily with cold packs and were
cultured within 72 hours of collection.

A total of 1241 nasal and nasopharyngeal swab specimen extracts were tested by both the
Lyra Adenovirus Assay and comparator method. A total of two invalid specimens were
removed from the analysis. These specimens were invalid on initial and repeat testing
with the subject device. Table 12 below details the results for the remaining 1239
specimens. Analysis of individual site data did not show any noteworthy differences
between sites. Therefore, pooling of clinical site data to generate the summary table
below was appropriate.

For the retrospectively selected samples, one hundred five (105) nasopharyngeal swab
specimens were obtained from a pediatric hospital in the southern United States. These
specimens were selected based on a qualitative result previously generated by an FDA-
cleared respiratory panel. All specimens were stored frozen at -70°C until they were
shipped to an in-house testing lab where they were extracted and tested with the Lyra
Adenovirus Assay and the comparator, an FDA-cleared PCR assay. The operator
performing the testing was blinded to the identity of these specimens. Table 13 shows the
results obtained from these specimens.
