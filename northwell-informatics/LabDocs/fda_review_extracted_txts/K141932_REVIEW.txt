L. Test Principle:
Immunofluorescence (and electronic volume sensing) assay for identification and enumeration of
monoclonal antibody labeled leukocytes. Labeled cells in suspension are passed single file through
a laser beam and the resultant scattered and fluoresced light is separated with dichroic filters and
quantified with photomultiplier tubes to determine the proportion and number of cells bearing the
labeled antibodies. Volumetric metering of the sample permits single platform determination of
absolute cell count.
The AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometer is a flow cytometer that has detectors for 4-color analysis. In
addition to detection of fluorescence parameters, the system also has the ability to detect relative
cell diameter using Forward Scatter (FS), relative cell granularity using Side Scatter (SS), and
relative electronic volume (EV) using the Coulter Principle. The AQUIOS CL uses flow cytometric
principles to determine qualitative and quantitative measurements of biological and physical
properties of cells and other particles. These properties are measured when the cells pass through
the laser beam(s) in single file. The AQUIOS System Software is designed for the AQUIOS CL
flow cytometer. It includes the algorithms and test definitions that provide automated analysis and
results for AQUIOS Tetra-1 and 2+ reagents; this application cannot be modified by the user.
The AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometer uses on-board sample preparation as part of the overall system

workflow. The AQUIOS Lysing Reagent Kit is comprised of two ready to-use reagents: Reagent A
lyses the red blood cells, Reagent B quenches the solution, slowing the lyse reaction down in
preparation for analysis.
The AQUIOS Flow Cytometry System also offers an optional standalone offline workstation. This
workstation is identical to the workstation that is physically connected to the instrument and can be
used for off-line analysis of results generated by the AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometer with AQUIOS
Tetra-1 and Tetra-2+ reagents and AQUIOS System software according to the product labeling.
Samples are aliquotted, stained, incubated and lysed onboard using a single-use reagent cassette.
AQUIOS Tetra-1 Panel CD45-FITC/CD4-RD1/CD8-ECD/CD3-PC5 reagent provides
identification and enumeration of CD3+/CD4+, CD3+/CD8+, and CD3+ lymphocyte percentages
and absolute counts in peripheral whole blood. AQUIOS Tetra-2+ Panel CD45-FITC/
(CD56+CD16)-RD1/CD19-ECD/CD3-PC5 provides identification and enumeration of CD3+,
CD3-/CD19+ and CD3-/CD56+ and/or CD16+ lymphocyte percentages and absolute counts in
peripheral whole blood.
AQUIOS Immuno-Trol and Immuno-Trol Low Cells are assayed, lysable whole blood quality
control product for immunophenotyping analysis using monoclonal antibody reagents and flow
cytometry. They provide a positive cell control that is processed in the same manner as a whole
blood sample. This allows verification of instrument and reagent performance. It also verifies the
methods used for staining targeted cells, lysing erythrocytes, and analyzing samples by the
AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assay Repeatability and Reproducibility Using Control Material
Assay reproducibility was assessed using two levels of control material [AQUIOS Immuno-
Trol Cells (IT), and AQUIOS Immuno-Trol Low Cells (ITL)]. Lot variability of AQUIOS
Tetra and AQUIOS Lyse was incorporated and assessed as part of the overall variability of
the study design.
Three lots each of Tetra-1 reagent, Tetra-2+ reagent, and Lyse were tested. Each control
level was run in duplicate twice each day (morning and afternoon) for a minimum of 20
days. A new vial of control material was opened each day of testing. The test was executed
on three AQUIOS CL flow cytometers, with one at each of the three test sites. Less than 1%
of results failed the quality parameters. As instructed in the label, they were excluded from
the analysis; in laboratory practice these samples would not be resulted and, as instructed in
the labeling, would be re-run on the AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometer.

At all levels of control material tested, all markers met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria for
repeatability and reproducibility (between runs, between days, between sites, and total).
Assay Repeatability using Whole Blood:
The study included 82 whole blood specimens covering the CD3+/CD4+ measuring range
with emphasis on the medical decision points. The whole blood specimens were prepared in
replicates of five with AQUIOS Tetra reagents (AQUIOS Tetra-1 and AQUIOS Tetra-2+)
run as a Tetra Combo panel. The test was executed on four AQUIOS CL flow cytometers at
four test sites. Data were analyzed and presented to demonstrate the degree of imprecision
across the measuring range (data not depicted) and were further summarized to illustrate the
imprecision by percentile of results. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria for repeatability are
the same as listed for reproducibility, above. The results of the repeatability study using
whole blood samples are listed in the following table:

Results of the lot-to-lot reproducibility study met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria and
demonstrated acceptable reproducibility.
Laser stability:
Both short-term laser performance (e.g. within-day stability; measured signals at 30 min, 3
hr, 6 hr, 8 hr, 24 hr) and long-term laser performance (e.g. between-day stability; measured
signals at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 3 hours, 6 hours, and 8 hours for a period of five (5) days)
were conducted on two AQUIOS CL instruments. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria of
mean channel of the integral signal intensity does not vary more than ± 10% from the
average signal channel number obtained over a period of 24 hours for short-term laser
performance, and five days for long-term laser performance and the HPCV of the integral
signals is ≤ 3.0 % was met for each of the instruments tested.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity of fluorescence signals:
Instrument photomultiplier tube linearity was assessed in triplicate with SPHEROTM
Rainbow Calibration Particles (RCPs, Spherotech, Chicago, IL). The study was conducted
on three (3) AQUIOS CL flow cytometers at Beckman Coulter, Miami, Florida. The
sponsor’s acceptance criteria of R2> 0.900 for FL1, FL2, FL3, and FL4 was met for all
instruments tested.
Assay linearity:
White blood cell pools were mixed with red blood cells to create specimens having
concentrations of lymphocytes that spanned the measuring range. Each of the concentrations
was prepared and analyzed in triplicate on three AQUIOS CL flow cytometers as a Tetra
Combo panel with AQUIOS Tetra-1 and AQUIOS Tetra-2+ reagents. Linearity of all
reported analytes was determined on 3 separate instruments using the method described in
CLSI EP06-A2, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures.
Linearity was evaluated by fitting linear and non-linear (quadratic and cubic) models and
assessing that the deviations from linearity (difference between the non-linear and linear
fits) were within the acceptance criteria. Deviations from linearity were calculated for the
markers that were not statistically linear and were compared to the linearity acceptance
limits. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria were:
R2 ≥ 0.95;
For result values in the range 0-300, the acceptable bias is ± 30 cells/μL
For result values >300, the acceptable bias is ± 10%
Using these criteria, the linear range was determined for each phenotypic subset and the
results are listed in the following table:

Reagent and control materials were subjected to conditions as stated below and tested for
drift relative to baseline values. Details of each study are provided as follows:
AQUIOS Tetra Reagents:
AQUIOS Tetra Reagents Closed Vial Stability:
Four lots each of AQUIOS Tetra-1 and Tetra-2+ were stored at 2-8°C and tested for closed
vial (CV) stability over ten (10) months. At each time point, one new vial of each Tetra
reagent lot was tested on the AQUIOS CL flow cytometer with AQUIOS Immuno-Trol (IT)
and Immuno-Trol Low (ITL) controls. Triplicate assessments were made at baseline
followed by at least 10 replicates at subsequent time points.

To study the effects of shipping, one lot of each of the AQUIOS Tetra-1 and Tetra-2+
reagents was exposed to a summer (22 to 39°C) and winter (-20 to +22°C) shipping profile
after the T0 time point testing, then returned to 2-8°C storage and included in subsequent
testing points. Triplicate assessments were made at baseline followed by at least 10
replicates at subsequent time points.
AQUIOS Tetra Reagents Open Vial Stability:
For open vial stability testing, new vials of each control lot were opened towards the end of
the products closed vial stability claim (>150 days). Ten replicates were tested at each time
point over the course of 30 days.
AQUIOS Tetra Reagents On-board Stability:
To test on-board stability, once the vials reached their designated closed and open vial
dating, one vial of each of three lots was subjected to thermal cycling and testing on the
AQUIOS CL flow cytometer. At each on-board stability test point including on board T0,
each Tetra reagent lot was tested on the AQUIOS CL flow cytometer with IT and ITL
testing 10 replicates for each control.

Three lots of each AQUIOS Lyse A and Lyse B reagents were tested for closed vial stability
over six (6) months.
AQUIOS Lyse Closed Vial Stability with temperature stress:
To study the effects of shipping, one lot of each AQUIOS Lyse A and B was exposed to a
summer (22 to 39°C) and winter (-20 to +22°C) shipping profile after the T0 time point
testing, then returned to controlled room temperature storage and included in subsequent
testing points.
AQUIOS Lyse Opened Vial Stability:
For open vial stability testing, new containers of each Lyse lot were opened towards the end
of the products closed vial stability claim (>150 days). At each open vial stability test point,
one container of each Lyse reagent lot was tested on the AQUIOS flow cytometer with IT
and ITL gathering ten replicates for each control.
AQUIOS Lyse On-board Stability:
For on-board stability testing, containers of each Lyse lot were opened towards the end of
the products closed vial stability claim (>150 days) and held in controlled room temperature
storage until they reached the open vial dating (>23 days). Once opened, one container of
each lot was subjected to thermal cycling and testing on the AQUIOS CL flow cytometer,
with six to ten replicates at each time point.

Fresh and Prepared Sample Stability:
Samples are automatically processed and run from within 0 to 3 minutes following staining
and lysing. Specimens whose analyses are delayed beyond three minutes are flagged for
rejection and reprocessing. Specimens are typically run at Time 0, however, analyses that
fail are reaquired, providing the acquisition can occur within the 3 minute time frame.
In order to demonstrate sample stability, 73 specimens, including normal and clinical
(HIV+) donors, spanning the analytical measuring range (AMR, CD3+/CD4+: 35-3000
cell/μL) were included in a stability study to compare performance on specimen processed
within 8 hours of draw and analyzed at Time 0 following processing to specimens processed
at 24 hours and analyzed 3 minutes post processing.

d. Detection limit:
This study established the Limit of Blank, Limit of Detection and Limit of Quantitation
values for each AQUIOS Tetra marker when tested on the AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometry
System. Studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP17. The study design
incorporated five (5) repetitions of each of the three (3) prepared blank samples which were
collected each day over four (4) days yielding a total of 60 data collection points per
measuring system. A total of 180 data points were collected for the entire study with three
(3) measuring systems. The study incorporated two (2) lots of each AQUIOS Tetra reagent
(Tetra-1, Tetra-2+), one lot of AQUIOS Lysing Reagents, three (3) Blank samples (prepared
with one (1) lot of Red Cell Pool and three (3) lots of Immuno-Trol Storage Buffer and three
(3) AQUIOS CL flow cytometers. The Limit of Blank was established for each marker as
the upper 95% of the data as recommended in the EP17-A2 Guideline.
Each LoB value was derived by repeated measures and represents the highest absolute count
(cells/μL) expected with the 95% confidence for the corresponding marker in a sample that
contains no analyte. Each LoD value represents the lowest cell count for each marker that
can be detected using the AQUIOS Tetra reagents on the AQUIOS instrument with 95%
confidence.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
In accordance with CLSI EP09-A3, a prospective study was conducted at four sites
comparing the accuracy of the AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometry System to the BD
FACSCalibur with specimens targeting the medically important ranges for CD4. Evaluation
included the use of multiple lots of AQUIOS reagents (AQUIOS Tetra-1, Tetra-2+, and
Lyse A/B) across the clinical sites. A total of 443 samples that covered the CD4 analytical
measuring range, with an emphasis on the medical decision points, were tested on the test
system (AQUIOS CL) and the predicate systems: FACSCalibur for assessment of T cell, B
cell and NK cell phenotypes, and Beckman Coulter UniCel DxH 800 for assessment of
CD45+ and CD45+Low SS. Donor specimens were comprised of 78% clinical specimens
and 22% normal specimens. Clinical specimens included specimens submitted for
assessments associated with HIV infection, transplant, immunosuppressive therapy (plus
other conditions), while the normal specimens consisted of specimens from healthy controls
and clinic specimens that were demonstrated to be hematologically normal. SAS 9.3
statistical software was used for data analysis.

Bias for percent positives comparisons was clinically insignificant. A negative bias for the
comparison of AQUIOS to the BD FACSCalibur was observed in the absolute count data
for all four (4) sites combined. This negative trend was observed for all markers, with
smaller differences observed for CD3+/CD4+. This bias was clinically insignificant at the
medical decision points for CD3+/CD4+ (e.g., <1 cell/mL bias at 200 cells/mL and < 2
cells/mL bias at 50 cells/mL). The bias observed for all CD markers was within the sponsor’s
acceptance limits.
