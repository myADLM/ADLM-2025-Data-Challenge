L. Test Principle:
Users of the Home Access A1C Test kit will collect a capillary blood samples by pricking
their fingertip using the sterile safety lancet included in the kit packaging. The user will place
several drops (30-500µl) of blood into the Home Access Collection Cassette that houses a
strip of glass fiber filter paper, until the cassette window indicator turns red. Once the
capillary blood sample is collected, the user is instructed to allow the sample to dry for 15
minutes and seal the blood sample in the Sample Pouch that has been labeled using the peel-
off label on the Patient Information card. The user mails the sample to Home Access Health
Corporation. Once the dried sample is received in the laboratory, it is punched and eluted.
Once eluted, the sample is assayed using FDA-cleared reagents. All testing is done using the
Beckman Coulter AU640e Chemistry analyzer.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed according to CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. Precision was
evaluated by testing venous whole blood samples obtained from volunteers at three
levels of HbA1c (~5.9, ~6.8 and ~8.9%). A total of 240 samples (80 samples per
level) were spotted to the Home Access A1C Test cassettes and allowed to dry
following the Home Access A1C Test instructions for use. Micro-Blood Samples
(MBS) were eluted and measured using the Beckman Hemoglobin A1c Test method
on the Beckman Coulter AU640e Chemistry analyzer for a total of three levels of
HbA1c x 2 samples per level per run x 2 runs a day x 20 days (n=80).
The results of the precision study are shown below:

3 8.9 0.1 1.8 0.3 3.0
An additional Precision study was conducted by testing a whole blood specimen from
a volunteer at a level of 12.5% HbA1c. A total of 50 Home Access A1C Test
cassettes were spotted and allowed to dry following the Home Access A1C Test
Instructions for use. MBS were eluted and measured using the Beckman Hemoglobin
A1c Test method on the Beckman Coulter AU640e Chemistry analyzer for a total of
5 samples x 2 runs x 5 days ( n=50).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was conducted to validate the linear range of the Home Access A1C
Test. Linearity was assessed following CLSI EP6-A guideline. Paired venous and
capillary samples collected onto Home Access collection cassettes were collected at
19 levels to cover a range of 4.5-15.9% HbA1c. The micro-blood samples were eluted
and measured and the results were compared to the expected values (venous
samples).

Nineteen levels of HbA1c ranging from 4.5 to 15.9% A1c were tested in this study,
with 4 individual samples at each level, or 76 individually prepared dry blood
samples (19 levels of HbA1c x 4 samples per level).
The expected values were plotted versus the observed values. The results using
standard linear regression analysis was as follows:
Y = 1.02x - 0.0553; r=0.995
The assay was determined to be linear over the assay range of 4.5%-14.5% HbA1c.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Home Access HbA1c test system assay is traceable to the IFCC reference
calibrators.
The Home Access A1C Test System is certified with the National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP), with an expiration date of February 1, 2016. The
NGSP certification expires one year from the certification date. See NGSP website
for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
Shelf-life of the Home Access A1C Test Kit was determined by real-time studies
consisting of patient samples collected from venous whole blood and compared to
capillary samples collected with the Home Access A1C Test kit which were stored up
to 39 months. Study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The Collection Cassette and Sample Pouch are stable for 36 months when
stored at room temperature (15-25°C). The outer box labeling of the kit indicates
“Store at Room Temperature (15-25°C, 59-77°F). Avoid exposure to direct Sunlight.”
In addition, a real-time shipping study was conducted using spotted dry samples
shipped in presumably worst-case shipping conditions, during hot and cold months
from the east south-central region (Kentucky) and southwest (California) locations of
the continental USA. Study protocols were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
Furthermore, an additional sample stability study that challenged extreme
temperatures (45°C and -20°C) was conducted to simulate the worst case scenario.
The study consisted of samples stressed at 45°C, then thawed and frozen at -20°C for
3 days. Study protocols were reviewed and found acceptable. Based on the real-time
sample stability study, patient samples are stable for up to 21 days at temperatures
ranging from -20°C - 45°C and humidity levels of 15-100%.
d. Detection limit:
The claimed measuring range of 4.5%-14.5% for the Home Access HbA1c Test, is
based on linearity. See 1b. above.

e. Analytical specificity:
i.) Interference of the Home Access A1C Test was assessed following EP07-A2
guideline. Studies were conducted to assess common or known exogenous substances
that may interfere with the Home Access A1C Test. Two levels of HbA1c (5.8% and
8.3%) were tested. Venous whole blood samples were drawn from volunteers and
split into two pools. One pool was used as the control pool and the other pool was
used to spike with different levels of the potential interfering substance. Stock
solution of the exogenous interferents (acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid,
ibuprofen, L-ascorbic acid, glybenclamide and metformin) were prepared and spiked
into the pooled test samples. Control and test specimens were spotted onto Home
Access collection cassettes, dried, and packaged in desiccated sample pouches
following product instructions. Significant interference was defined by the sponsor as
% recovery +/- 10%. The sponsor claims there was no significant interference by the
following exogenous substances:
· Acetaminophen up to 20 mg/dL
· Acetylsalicylic acid up to 65 mg/dL
· Ibuprofen up to 50 mg/dL
· L-ascorbic acid up to 4 mg/dL
· Metformin up to 4 mg/dL
· Glyburide up to 0.2 mg/dL
ii.) Endogenous interference was also assessed by using two levels of HbA1c (~5.2%
and ~8.3%). Venous whole blood samples were drawn from volunteers and split into
two pools. One pool was used as the control pool and the other pool was used to spike
with different levels of interfering substance. Significant interference was defined by
the sponsor as % recovery +/- 10%. The sponsor claims there was no significant
interference by the following exogenous substances:
· Bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated) up to 30 mg/dL
· Triglycerides up to 1640 mg/dL
· Hemolysis up to 14000 mg/dL
· Rheumatoid Factor up to 600 IU/ml
iii.) Interference from Hemoglobin Variants was tested by using whole blood samples
obtained from a commercial reference laboratory. The whole blood samples
contained three HbA1c levels (5.7, 6.4 and 7.4)% A1c for each variant (Hemoglobin
C, Hemoglobin D, Hemoglobin E, Hemoglobin F, Hemoglobin S). Interference from
each hemoglobin variant was evaluated by spotting blood with the respective
Hemoglobin variant onto Home Access collection cassettes and comparing MBS
HbA1c with the baseline whole blood measurements obtained from the Home Access
A1C test and actual HbA1c concentrations obtained by the commercial reference
laboratory. Significant interference was defined as +/- 10% difference between the
8

--- Page 9 ---
values obtained from the reference samples and those obtained from the Home
Access HbA1c Test kit.
The testing results show there is no significant interference for Hemoglobin D (≤
36%), and Hemoglobin E (≤ 39%).
The sponsor indicates the following in the labeling: “With this Test, Hemoglobin S
and Hemoglobin C may increase HbA1c results by as much as 40%; a blood sample
containing >10% of Hemoglobin F may yield a lower than expected result.”
The sponsor has the following limitation on the front box and package insert labeling
“A1C tests are not reliable for monitoring blood sugar in people with hemoglobin
variants. Ask your Doctor if you have Hemoglobin S, Hemoglobin C or elevated
Hemoglobin F. These variants have been shown to interfere with this A1C Test. Do
Not use this test if you have these variants.”
Additional Studies:
Flex Studies- Flex studies were conducted to assess any potential pre-analytical error
that could be introduced to the sample. These studies evaluated blood sample
acceptability in terms of:
(a) A Blood Volume study was conducted with 3 HbA1c levels across the measuring
range of the test 5.6, 7.2 and 12.4% HbA1c to assess the effect of the minimum and
maximum blood volume collected in the collection cassette on device performance.
Fourteen (14) blood volume levels were tested. Home Access Collection cassettes
were spotted with 10, 20, 30, 40 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 µl of
blood. A total of 420 cassettes were tested (10 cassettes x 3 HbA1c levels x 14
separate volumes of blood). Samples were punched, eluted and tested. Results of the
MBS volumes were compared with expected (known) values for HbA1c as
determined from testing venipuncture blood. Results of the blood volume study
demonstrated acceptable performance with capillary sample volumes of 30 µl to 500
µl.
(b) A Timing (interruption) study, included professional and venous samples which were
collected at the same time. A control group and two variable test groups were
established. The control group complete finger stick blood specimen was collected
within 5 minutes. The two test groups were spotted with the interval of 30 minutes
and of 24 hours. A total of 90 Home Access Collection cassettes were tested (Three
levels x 10 cassettes per group x 3 groups (the control and the two test groups).
Samples were punched, eluted and tested. The study demonstrated that interruption of
specimen collection could be as long as 24 hours and the sample would be acceptable.
(c) A Hematocrit interference study used 39 HbA1c levels which were obtained from
volunteers with HbA1c values ranging from 4.8% to 12.4%. K2-EDTA venous whole
blood samples were collected by phlebotomists and shipped overnight to Home
Access Health Corporation. A Control sample, High Hematocrit Test sample and
9

--- Page 10 ---
Low Hematocrit Test sample were created. After drying, Home Access cassettes with
venous spotted samples were packaged and stored for processing. MBS were then
punched, eluted and tested. Results of this study were found to be acceptable. The
results of the study demonstrated that varying hematocrit levels (34-54%) do not
interfere with the Home Access A1C Test.
(d) Interference from coating solution study included specimens collected using coated
filter paper and specimens collected using uncoated filter paper. The study used 53
levels of HbA1c covering the range of 4.8% to 12.4%. The study included the eluting
and measuring of 106 samples (53 x 2) which were collected professionally as finger
stick capillary specimens from 53 volunteers. This study tested 53 analyte levels, each
with 2 individual capillary Home Access cassettes with coated strips and one Home
Access cassette on uncoated strips. One lot of Home Access A1C test kits and one lot
of uncoated glass fiber filter paper were used for the study. To evaluate the
differences between samples on coated strips and samples on uncoated strips, the
measurements for each sample was calculated and samples on coated strips was
compared to the samples on uncoated strips. The study determined that the coating
solution does not interfere with the testing and the results of HbA1c when using the
Home Access HbA1c Test.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was conducted following CLSI EP09-A2-IR guideline.
A total of 256 patient samples (128 self-collected capillary samples and 128
professionally-collected venous and capillary samples) with a range of 4.8-13.9%
HbA1c were collected. The study was performed to compare test results obtained by
the lay user’s finger-stick samples via the Home Access collection cassette with the
results by the venous samples using the Beckman Coulter Hemoglobin A1c Test
(k031380) in the clinical laboratory of the Home Access Health Corporation
(HAHC). Blood samples were collected by the lay user at two separate clinic sites
following the Home Access A1C Test kit instructions and mailed to HAHC for
analysis. The professionally collected finger-stick and venous blood samples were
also collected at these two separate sites. All samples (venous and capillary) were
mailed at the same time. One sample resulted in HbA1c result higher than the claimed
measuring range of the device (>14.5%) and was removed from the analysis. The
results of the 127 samples tested across the claimed measuring range of the test using
simple linear regression analysis are as follows:
