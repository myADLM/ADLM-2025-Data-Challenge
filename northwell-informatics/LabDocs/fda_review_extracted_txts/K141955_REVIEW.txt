L. Test Principle:
XN Cal™ PF was designed to function as a substitute for fresh whole blood to calibrate the
Sysmex XN Series (XN-10, XN-11, XN-20, XN-21) instruments. XN CAL™ PF is an in-
vitro diagnostic device used by a component human observer to adjust calibration of the
PLT-F (103/µL) measurand on the Sysmex XN Series analyzers (XN-10, XN-11, XN-20,
XN-21).

The precision performance studies were conducted at two sites (Streck and Sysmex
America). Each site performed 10 consecutive runs on each analyzer with separate
vials of control from three specified lots at the beginning and end of the product
dating claim. Control materials were shipped, stored, mixed, and handled in
accordance with the instructions for use. The acceptance criteria were based on a
compilation of the CV% for PLT-F. Results collected across the three manufactured
lots of XN CAL™ PF demonstrate consistent recovery across the XN-11 and XN-21
instruments at both sites within the parameter specific assay assignment range as
demonstrated in the table below.

CV% Acceptance Criteria 5.0
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i. Value Assignment:
Value assignment for XN CAL™ PF was based on data collected across three
(3) XN-21 analyzers (one internal Streck and two external Sysmex). Data was
collected using three separately manufactured lots (3287, 3315, and 3343) and
three primary operators. A 10-run reproducibility study was executed for the
calibrator at the beginning and end of the stated product dating (n=60). The
acceptance criterion takes into account inter-operator, inter-laboratory, and
inter-instrument variability.
ii. Open-Vial Stability:
The 4-hour open-vial stability claim was substantiated by performing
duplicate runs over 2-consecutive days at the end of the 49-day end date
utilizing: two (2) vials each of three separately manufactured lots (3287, 3315,
and 3343), one primary operator, and one XN-21 analyzer at the internal
Streck site. Each vial of calibrator was stored in accordance with the
instructions for use between 2°-8°C. The calculated CV% values were within
the guidelines indicated in the table above M.1 (a).
iii. Closed-Vial Stability:
The 49-day closed-vial stability claim was substantiated by performing
duplicate runs over 21 testing dates spanning the 49-day end date claim
utilizing: two (2) vials each of three separately manufactured lots (3287, 3315,
and 3343), one primary operator, and one XN-21 analyzer at the internal
Streck site. Each vial of calibrator was stored in accordance with the
instructions for use between 2°-8°C. The study was performed in accordance
