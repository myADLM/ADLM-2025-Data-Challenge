separate vials of control from each lot at the beginning and end of the product dating
claim. The datasets collected across the 3 lots of XN CHECK BF illustrate consistent
recovery across multiple instruments at multiple sites with the resulting data sets
recovering within the parameter specific assay assignment ranges set forth for each
measurand.
The acceptance criteria for the XN CHECK BF assayed parameters were based on a
compilation of the CV% for each measurand over the data collected on 3 XN-21
instruments at 2 sites throughout the product dating claim, with the 3 separately
manufactured lots of XN CHECK BF. The acceptance criteria was based on the data
collected internally at Streck and external sites which takes into account inter-
operator, inter-laboratory, and inter-instrument variability. The reported CV% for
each measurand per level, per lot was deemed acceptable if less than the threshold
value as reported in the XN CHECK BF CV% Summary Table.
Results show that the CV% values collected were within acceptable threshold values.

Value assignment:
Value assignment for XN-CHECK™ BF was based on data collected across 3 XN-
21 instruments. Data was collected across three separately manufactured lots. A 10-
run reproducibility study was executed for the bi-level control on each lot at the
beginning and end of the product dating claim (n=60 per level). Three operators
conducted the value assignment study.
Assay values were assigned to the parameters assayed on the XN-11/XN 21 based on
a statistical analysis of the data collected externally and at Streck. The assay ranges
assigned to each parameter were based on the data collected and the acceptance
criteria takes into account inter-operator, inter-laboratory, and inter-instrument
variability.
Open-vial stability:
The open-vial stability claim was verified on the XN-21 instrument. Open-vial
stability testing was performed real-time for the 30-day open-vial stability claim
throughout the stated product life.

Two vials of control per level from each lot were analyzed in duplicate over a period
of 30 days (i.e., analysis performed on days 1, 31 and four intermediate testing days
(days 7, 14, 21 and 28); (n=24)). All of the data for this study was collected
internally at Streck utilizing one operator. Four data points were collected at each
testing event. Throughout the collection of the open-vial stability data each vial of
control was stored between 2° to 8° C and removed from the refrigerator for testing.
After testing, the vial was returned to the refrigerator until the next testing event.
CV% was used to generate acceptance criteria of the open-vial stability study. The
CV% selected was based on a compilation of the CV% shown in the precision
performance studies as well as the performance specifications of the XN-11/XN-21
instruments. Selection of the acceptance criteria was based on the data collected
internally at Streck and external sites. It takes into account inter-operator, inter-
laboratory, and inter-instrument variability. The reported CV% for each measurand
per level, per lot was deemed acceptable if less than the threshold value as reported
in the XN CHECK BF CV% Summary Table (above).
Results show that the CV% values collected were within acceptable threshold values.
Closed-vial stability:
The 84-day Closed-Vial Stability claim was verified on the XN-21 with all three lots
of control material. Two vials of control per level from each reference lot were used
at each testing interval for the study. A minimum of four data points were collected
at each testing event over the 84-day closed-vial stability claim. Data was collected
internally with one operator. All data were collected and analysis of the assayed
parameters on the XN-11/21 analyzers was performed using CLSI EP5-A2 methods.
For each measurand, on each lot, using one instrument, imprecision estimates were
calculated for each level of the 3 separately manufactured lots.
CV% was used to generate acceptance criteria of the closed-vial stability study. The
CV% selected was based on a compilation of the CV% shown in the precision
performance studies. Selection of the acceptance criteria was based on the data

Results show that the CV% values collected were within acceptable threshold values.
Open- and closed-vial stability of XN-CHECK™ BF was assessed in terms of the
measurand drift as suggested in the CLSI EP-25 Guideline. Scatter plots were
provided with fitted linear regression lines and corresponding 95% confidence
intervals. The acceptance criteria were based on a specific percentage of change from
mean level at time 0. All parameters were within the draft acceptance limits for the
target time durations for both open- and closed-vial stability.
