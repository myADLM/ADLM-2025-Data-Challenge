XN CAL™ was designed to function as a substitute for fresh whole blood to calibrate the
Sysmex XN10/20, and XN 11/21 series hematology analyzers. This product is for in-vitro
diagnostic use to calibrate the following parameters: RBC (106/μL), HGB (g/dL), HCT (%),
PLT (103/μL), WBC (103/μL), and RET (%).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Data were collected at two internal sites and at one external site across 3 different
Sysmex XN-21 model analyzers with 3 separately manufactured lots of XN-CAL™.
Studies were conducted for each lot at all three (3) sites. Each site performed 10
consecutive runs on each XN-21 Series Instrument with separate vials of calibrator
from each lot. Calibration materials were shipped, stored, mixed, and handled in
accordance with the instructions for use. The acceptance criteria were based on a
compilation of the CV% for each parameter reported. Results across the three

Streck performed analyses on three Sysmex XN-21 model analyzers using three lots
of calibrator tested 10 times at the beginning and end of the product date claim of 49
days. Assay values were assigned to the parameters assayed (RBC (106/μL), HGB
(g/dL), HCT (%), PLT (103/μL), WBC (103/μL, RET (%)) generated from the
Sysmex XN-21 model based on a statistical analysis of the data collected at Streck
and Sysmex US sites. Final assignment values were determined using total precision
data collected and established product performance characteristics. Expected range
values assigned to each of the measurand were based on 2.5 SD from the total-run
data collected for XN CAL™. All lot specific assay values will be included on the lot

specific assay sheet for each manufactured lot of XN-CAL. An assay sheet will be

Reagent Stability
The acceptance criteria for open and closed-vial stability were based on a compilation
of the CV% for each measurand (RBC (106/μL), HGB (g/dL), HCT (%), PLT
(103/μL), WBC (103/μL, RET (%)) over data collected across three different Sysmex
XN-21 analyzers, at three sites, throughout the product stability claim period, using 3
lots of XN CAL™.
Open-vial stability: A 4-hour real-time open-vial stability claim was conducted at the
end of the 49-day stability study at one internal site on the Sysmex XN-21 model
analyzer. Two vials of calibrator from each of the three reference lots# (3287, 3315,
3343) were analyzed four times at two time intervals over two consecutive days
(n=8) on one analyzer.
Closed-vial stability: A real-time 49-day closed-vial study was conducted on the
Sysmex XN-21 model analyzers. Two vials of calibrators from each of the three
reference lots# (3287, 3315, 3343) were analyzed four times at 21 time interval
(n=84) over 53 days across all the 3 sites. Data was collected at one time interval
beyond the 49-day stability claim. Data were collected and analyzed using CLSI
EP5-A2 methods on the XN-21 model analyzers.
All reported CV% values for open and closed vial reagent stability study were within
the acceptable threshold values as shown in the tables for the acceptance criteria
above in section M.1 (a).
