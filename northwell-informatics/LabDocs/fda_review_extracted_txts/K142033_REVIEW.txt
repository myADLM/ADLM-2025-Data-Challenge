510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
K142033
B. Purpose for Submission
The purpose of the submission is for clearance of an additional two analytes, Norovirus
GI/GII and Rotavirus A, to the already cleared Verigene Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid
Test (EP) (k140083) which is run on the Verigene System.
C. Measurand
The Verigene Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test is performed on the automated Nanosphere
Verigene System utilizing reverse transcription (RT), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and array
hybridization to detect specific gastrointestinal microbial nucleic acid gene sequences for the
following organisms:
· Campylobacter Group (comprised of C. coli, C. jejuni, and C. lari)
· Shigella species (including S. dysenteriae, S. boydii, S. sonnei, and S. flexneri)
· Vibrio Group (comprised of V. cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus)
· Yersinia enterocolitica
· Shiga toxin 1 gene and Shiga toxin 2 gene virulence markers
· Norovirus GI/GII
· Rotavirus A
D. Type of Test:
The Verigene Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test is a qualitative molecular assay which
relies on detection of specific nucleic acid targets in a microarray format. For each of the
bacterial nucleic acid sequences detected by Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test, unique
Capture and Mediator oligonucleotides are utilized, with gold nanoparticle probe-based
endpoint detection. The Capture oligonucleotides are covalently bound to the microarray
substrate and hybridize to a specific portion of the nucleic acid targets. The Mediator
oligonucleotides have a region which bind to a different portion of the same nucleic acid
targets and also have a sequence which allows binding of a gold nanoparticle probe. Catalytic
enhancement of the bound gold nanoparticle probes at the capture sites results in gold-silver
aggregates that scatter light with high efficiency and provide accurate detection of target
capture.

1. Intended Use:
The Verigene Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test (EP) is a multiplexed, qualitative test
for simultaneous detection and identification of common pathogenic enteric bacteria,
viruses and genetic virulence markers from liquid or soft stool preserved in Cary-Blair
medium, collected from individuals with signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal
infection. The test is performed on the automated Nanosphere Verigene System utilizing
reverse transcription (RT), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and array hybridization to
detect specific gastrointestinal microbial nucleic acid gene sequences associated with the
following pathogenic bacteria and viruses:
· Campylobacter Group (comprised of C. coli, C. jejuni, and C. lari)
· Salmonella species
· Shigella species (including S. dysenteriae, S. boydii, S. sonnei, and S. flexneri)
· Vibrio Group (comprised of V. cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus)
· Yersinia enterocolitica
· Norovirus GI/GII
· Rotavirus A

--- Page 3 ---
In addition, EP detects the Shiga toxin 1 gene and Shiga toxin 2 gene virulence markers.
Shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC) typically harbor one or both genes that encode for
Shiga Toxins 1 and 2.
EP is indicated as an aid in the diagnosis of specific agents of gastrointestinal illness, in
conjunction with other clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological information; however, is
not to be used to monitor these infections. EP also aids in the detection and identification
of acute gastroenteritis in the context of outbreaks.
Due to the limited number of positive specimens collected for certain organisms during
the prospective clinical study, performance characteristics for Yersinia enterocolitica,
Vibrio Group and Shigella species were primarily established with contrived specimens.
Concomitant culture is necessary for organism recovery and further typing of bacterial
agents.
EP results should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient
management decisions. Confirmed positive results do not rule out co-infection with other
organisms that are not detected by this test, and may not be the sole or definitive cause of
patient illness. Negative EP results in the setting of clinical illness compatible with
gastroenteritis may be due to infection by pathogens that are not detected by this test or
non-infectious causes such as ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or Crohn’s
disease.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Prescription Use Only
4. Special instrument requirements:
The assay is run on the Verigene System.
I. Device Description:
The Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test is performed on the Verigene System which is a
fully automated, bench-top molecular diagnostics workstation. The System enables
automated nucleic acid extraction from unformed stool specimens (liquid or soft) preserved
in Cary-Blair media and detection of bacterial and viral-specific target DNA. The Verigene
System consists of two components: the Verigene Reader and the Verigene Processor SP.
The Reader is the Verigene System’s user interface, which serves as the central control unit
for all aspects of test processing, imaging, and result generation using a touch-screen control
panel and a barcode scanner. The Verigene Processor SP executes the test procedure,
3

--- Page 4 ---
automating the steps of sample preparation, target amplification hybridization to the
detection microarray. Detection and identification of bacterial and viral-specific DNA is
performed in a microarray format by using gold nanoparticle probe-based technology. Once
the specimen is loaded by the operator, all other fluid transfer steps are performed by an
automated pipette that transfers reagents between wells of the trays and finally loads the
specimen into the Test Cartridge for hybridization. Single-use disposable test consumables
and a self-contained Verigene Test Cartridge are utilized for each sample tested with the
Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test assay.
To obtain the test results after test processing is complete, the user removes the Test
Cartridge from the Processor SP, and inserts the substrate holder into the Reader for analysis.
Light scatter from the capture spots is imaged by the Reader and intensities from the
microarray spots are used to make a determination regarding the presence (Detected) or
absence (Not Detected) of a bacterial or viral nucleic acid sequence/analyte. This
determination is made by means of software-based decision algorithm resident in the Reader.

Statistical Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests
L. Test Principle:
The Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test is performed on samples of stool preserved in
Cary-Blair media, collected from individuals suspected of having acquired an enteric
infection. The provided flocked swab is dipped into the specimen until flocked tip is fully
immersed. Once evenly coated, the swab is transferred to the Stool Prep Buffer tube and
broken at the pre-formed scored breakpoint. The Stool Prep Buffer tube is sealed with a
screw cap and thoroughly vortexed and centrifuged to ensure a proper mixture of the
specimen. A 200 μL aliquot of the prepared Stool Prep Buffer (SLB) is pipetted into the
Specimen Well of the Extraction Tray and the Drawer Assembly of the Verigene SP is closed
to initiate the test. An automated pipettor performs all further fluidic transfers during the
Sample Extraction and Amplification steps.
The steps automated by the Verigene System include:
· Sample Preparation—Cell lysis and magnetic bead-based bacterial and viral NA
isolation from liquid or soft stool samples preserved in Cary-Blair media
· Target Amplification—Multiplex PCR-based amplification to generate specific
amplicons
· Hybridization and Detection—Hybridization of analyte-specific NA to capture
oligonucleotides on a microarray, using gold nanoparticle probe-based technology to
aid detection.
For each of the bacterial or viral nucleic acid sequences/analytes detected by the EP test, two
sets of oligonucleotides are required for the endpoint gold nanoparticle probe-based process:
(i) Capture oligonucleotides (or captures) and (ii) Mediator oligonucleotides (or mediators).
The Capture oligonucleotides are printed on the Test Substrate (or the microarray) and are
designed to specifically bind to one part of the analyte-specific target oligonucleotide (or
target). The Mediator oligonucleotides bind to a complementary portion of the same target
which is now hybridized to the capture and enable binding of gold nanoparticle probes.
Silver enhancement of the bound gold nanoparticle probes at the capture sites results in gold-
silver aggregates that scatter light with high efficiency. Light scatter from the capture spots is
imaged by the Verigene Reader and intensities from the microarray spots are processed by a
decision algorithm to make calls regarding the presence (“Detected”) or absence (“Not
Detected”) of a nucleic acid sequence/analyte.

bacterial analytes.
Preparation of Samples for Precision/Reproducibility Studies (and other analytical
studies):
For preparation of samples for analytical studies, organisms were spiked into a Negative
Stool Matrix (NSM) pool. The NSM was prepared by pooling individual de-identified
residual stool specimens preserved in Cary-Blair medium which were determined to be
negative by standard culture methods as well as by the EP assay. These individual “Cary-
Blair specimens” were originally prepared by diluting unpreserved stool specimens
(obtained from individuals in the intended use population) in Cary-Blair medium such
that the stool comprises 25% by volume of the resulting specimen. NSM was formulated
by pooling the negative Cary-Blair specimens, combining with Enteric Stool Prep Buffer
in a 1:5 ratio, and clarifying by centrifugation and collection of the supernatant. The
NSM pool was again tested with the Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test in replicates of
20 and confirmed as negative.
Analytical samples were prepared using Rotavirus strains obtained from the American
Type and Culture Collection (ATCC) and Norovirus strains obtained from the Center for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Viral strains were characterized and quantified
and then diluted and added to the NSM to achieve appropriate organism concentrations.
These simulated specimens were either used immediately (within 30 min of preparation)
or stored frozen at <-70°C until use.
Precision Study
A Precision Study for the Norovirus and Rotavirus targets was conducted as part of a full
20-sample EP study (bacteria and viruses) previously performed for K140083. The panel
was composed of simulated specimens prepared with three characterized and quantified
viral strains as presented in the table below. In addition, two negative samples were also
run (Negative Stool Matrix and Clostridium difficile). For each EP viral strain the panel
included, a “Low Positive” sample at 1-2x the Limit of Detection (LoD), which would be
expected to produce a positive result approximately 95% of the time, and a “Moderate
Positive” sample at 2-5x LoD, which would be expected to yield a positive result
approximately 99% of the time. Panel members were tested daily in duplicate by two
operators for four non-consecutive days for a total of 16 tests per sample (2
operators/day x 2 replicates/operator x 4 days = 16 tests per sample). Positive and
negative controls were run once per combination of consumable lots received.

The Precision Study yielded the expected results for all 96 samples containing the
targeted viral analytes. With the inclusion of the Norovirus and Rotavirus targets to
the EP test, the results of the positive bacterial as well as negative samples tested in
the full Precision Study performed for K140083 were assessed with the viral target
results unmasked. Across all of the 224 bacterial and negative control samples tested,
there were no cases of false positive results for Norovirus or Rotavirus and therefore
the Precision study results presented in K140083 are unchanged with the addition of
the viral targets.
Two samples returned initial No Calls, giving an initial call rate for viral samples of
97.9% (94/96). In addition, three samples returned pre-analysis (pre-AE) errors for a
rate of 3% (3/101 tests). All initial no-calls and pre-AE errors gave the expected
results upon repeat testing.
Study results as shown in the following table demonstrated acceptable within-
laboratory precision for the EP test.

The inter-laboratory reproducibility of the EP test for Norovirus and Rotavirus was
evaluated in a study performed for the initial clearance of the EP test (K140083) at three
external clinical sites. The viral panel members for the Reproducibility study were the
same as described above for the internal Precision Study. Samples were prepared in NSM
with each strain at two concentrations; low positive and moderate positive. In addition
two negative samples were evaluated (NSM and Clostridium difficile). The study
included five days of testing incorporating the following sources of potential variance:
sites, operators, days, consumable lots and runs. Samples were tested daily in triplicate by
two operators for five non-consecutive days at three sites for a total of 90 tests per sample
(3 sites x 2 operators / site x 3 replicates / operator x 5 days = 90 tests per sample).
Positive and negative controls were run at each site according to the study protocol.
Samples which yielded an initial ‘No Call’ or Pre-Analysis Error test result with the
Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test were repeated from the original sample (new
aliquot) per the package insert instructions and the repeat result was considered the final
result.
The results of the Reproducibility Study for the Norovirus and Rotavirus targets are
summarized in the tables below. In addition to the results presented, a single false
positive Salmonella result occurred for a Rotavirus sample.

Of the 540 tests performed for the viral targets, there were 25 initial No Call results
(4.6%) and after repeat testing, six samples yielded a final No Call result (1.1%). In
addition, three samples gave initial pre-AE errors (0.3%) all of which gave the expected
result after repeat testing.

With the inclusion of the Norovirus and Rotavirus targets to the EP test, the results of the
positive bacterial as well as negative samples tested in the full Reproducibility Study
performed for K140083 were assessed with the viral target results unmasked. Across all
samples tested in the original reproducibility study, there were no false positive results
for Norovirus or Rotavirus and therefore the Reproducibility Study results in K140083
are unchanged with the addition of the viral targets.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Internal Assay Controls
Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test (EP) is a ‘specimen-to-result’ detection system
wherein nucleic acids are isolated and identified by an automated process. In order to
decrease the likelihood of false results due to processing errors, all reagents are
prepackaged in single-use disposables. The following controls are built into the system so
that processing failures are identified and the appropriate actions are taken.
INTL CTL 1: An artificial DNA construct serves as the internal hybridization control or
“positive control for detection.” It is a synthetic DNA construct present in the sample
buffer and is hybridized in parallel with every test sample.
INTL CTL 2: An MS2 Phage serves as a specimen isolation and amplification control
and is referred to as the Internal Processing Control 2. This control is added to each
specimen prior to the extraction step.
For a valid Negative test result, both IC1 and IC2 must be “Detected.” If IC1 or IC2 are
not detected a “No Call – INT CTL 1” or a “No Call – INT CTL 2” is provided
respectively. If both IC1 and IC2 are not detected, a “NO CALL – INT CTL” result is
provided. The recommended action for any “No Call” decision is to repeat the test

No Call - INT CTL 1	1.1% (6/540)

according to the instructions package insert. These internal controls are not utilized for
the detection of positive samples.
Imaging Controls:
These controls comprise a set of oligonucleotide spots on the Test Substrate that act as a
quality check for proper fluid control and movement between the Test Cartridge and the
Reagent Pack. Inability to detect the imaging controls results in a “No Call – No Grid.”
The Imaging Control signal is generated when a signal probe hybridizes to an
oligonucleotide on the substrate. Signal at these spots indicates that the steps of probe
hybridization and signal enhancement were performed as intended.
In summary, the detection algorithm requires that all internal controls are valid before
decisions regarding the presence or absence of any other target on the panel can be
reported. If all controls are not within the predefined specification, a no call result will be
obtained and further action should be taken according to the product labeling.
Positive and Negative External Controls
External controls are not provided with the EP test; however the package insert indicates
that external quality control testing should be performed in conformance with local, state,
and federal regulations or accreditation organizations as applicable and users should
follow their laboratory’s standard quality control procedures. Refer to clinical the study
section below for results of external quality control testing performed during the clinical
study.
d. Detection limit:
Refer to K140083 for Limit of Detection (LoD) Study results for the previously cleared
EP bacterial analytes.
The LoD for the viral analytes was evaluated using samples prepared with previously
characterized and quantified preparations of Norovirus and Rotavirus strains serially
diluted in Negative Stool Matrix (NSM). Each concentration in the dilution series was
tested in replicates of four and the preliminary LoD for each targeted organism was
estimated as the concentration level with the lowest concentration level for which all four
replicates were positive. The LoD was then confirmed by testing 20 additional replicates
at the preliminary LoD concentration to establish that the strain was detected in at least
95% of the measurements. If an organism was detected in all replicates (20/20), the next
lower concentration was also tested to verify a detection rate below 95% (19/20). If the
initial results yielded a 19/20 correct result, no further testing was conducted and the level
was confirmed as the LoD. The validated LoD for the EP test Norovirus and Rotavirus
targets is summarized in the following tables:

e. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity):
Refer to K140083 for Analytical Reactivity Study results for previously cleared EP
bacterial analytes.
An Analytical Reactivity study was performed to determine whether the EP test is able to
detect a variety of organisms that represent the genetic diversity of Norovirus and Rotavirus
stains. This study included different strains that were used to prepare samples at low
concentrations (near the LoD). The study included a panel of 41 viral strains, representing
temporal, geographical, and phylogenetic diversity of the organisms. As propagating
Noroviruses in vitro is challenging, the Norovirus strains evaluated in the study were
patient stool samples, characterized and quantitated by the CDC using a validated real-
time RT- PCR reference assay. The Norovirus samples were prepared by diluting the
stool samples to intermediate concentrations in viral transport media and spiked into
NSM to yield the desired concentration. Rotavirus samples were prepared using titered
stocks diluted in viral transport media and then subsequently added to NSM to give the
appropriate sample concentration. All viral strains were tested in triplicate.
All tested strains of Rotavirus and Norovirus GI were detected at a concentration of 3x
LoD. All strains of Norovirus GII were detected; however for some strains, increased
organism concentrations (10x and 50x LoD) were required to achieve detection of all
replicates. The strains tested are presented in the following table:

In silico Results for Norovirus:
Based on in silico analysis, the majority of genotypes of Norovirus GII are expected to be
detected by the EP test with the exception of GII.11 which is not expected to be detected
by EP. Additionally, GII.6 and GII.13 are expected to either be not detected or to be
detected with reduced sensitivity (i.e., detected only at higher concentrations). Norovirus
GII.2, GII.3, and GII.12 genotypes are predicted to be detected with reduced sensitivity.
Norovirus strains GII.9, GII.14, and GIV.1 are predicted to be detected by EP and
Norovirus strains GII.8 could not be evaluated due to lack of available sequence
information.
The need for higher concentrations for detection of some Norovirus GII strains with the
EP test is likely a reflection of the high genetic diversity within Norovirus GII genotypes
resulting in reduced sensitivity due to inefficient amplification or hybridization or both.

The following limitations are included in the draft EP test Package Insert to address the
detection or predicted detection of various Norovirus genogroups/genotypes:
· EP is expected to be inclusive to most strains of the Norovirus GI, GII, and GIV
genotypes known to cause disease in humans based on empirical testing and
supplemented by in silico analysis. However, due to the high genetic diversity
within Noroviruses, some strains may not be detected or may be detected with
reduced sensitivity by EP. Refer to the Analytical Sensitivity (Inclusivity) section
and Table 16 for details.
· EP inclusivity to Norovirus strains GII.9, GII.14, and GIV.1 was evaluated by in
silico analysis only. Rare Norovirus genotypes GII.6 and GII.13 were determined
to either be detected at reduced sensitivity or predicted to not be detected by EP
based on in silico analysis. For GII.8, EP inclusivity is unknown as, in the
absence of sequence information, in silico analysis could not be performed.
· Norovirus GII.11 is not expected to be detected by EP based on in silico analysis.
In silico Results for Rotavirus:
Rotavirus genotypes G4, G5, G10, G11, and G15 were not wet-tested but are predicted to
be detected based on in silico data. Sequence data regarding genotypes G7, G21, and G24
was not available and therefore it is not known if these strains would be detected by the
EP test. The following limitation is included in the EP test package insert.
· EP inclusivity to Rotavirus A genotypes, G4, G5, G10, G11, and
G15 was evaluated based on in silico analysis only. Inclusivity of
EP to Rotavirus A genotypes G7, G21, and G24 is unknown;
representative strains were not available for empirical testing and in
the absence of sequence information, in silico analysis could not be
performed.
f. Analytical specificity (exclusivity):
Refer to K140083 for Analytical Specificity Study results for previously
cleared EP bacterial analytes.
The specificity of the Norovirus and Rotavirus probes in the EP Test was
addressed through the “unmasking” of the viral target results generated in the
original analytical specificity study performed for K140083. In the study, a
panel of 158 organisms comprised of 34 bacterial organisms, 18 viruses, four
parasites, one fungal organism (C. albicans) and one human cell line were
evaluated. Samples were prepared by spiking NSM with bacterial strains and
Candida albicans at 107 CFU/mL and viral strains at 106 PFU/mL. If an
organism could not be accurately titered or was unavailable in whole
organism form, genomic DNA was tested at approximately 107 CFU/mL. All
samples were tested in triplicate. Results for the Norovirus and Rotavirus
targets yielded a “Not Detected” results in all three replicates for all organisms
evaluated demonstrating no cross-reactivity with the EP test. The organisms

Potential “within panel” cross-reactivity was evaluated using representative targeted viral
and bacterial analytes tested in the Carryover/Cross-Contamination Study performed for
the initial clearance of the EP Test (K140083). The study yielded no EP false positive
results, demonstrating that cross-reactivity does not occur between EP targets. The strains
evaluated are presented in the following table.

For viral strains that were difficult to obtain, the analytical specificity of the EP Test
was evaluated via in silico analysis. This analysis demonstrated that Norovirus
genotype GIV.2, Norovirus genogroups GIII, GV and Rotavirus genogroups B, C, D,
and NADRV (Novel Adult Diarrheal Rotavirus) are not predicted to cross-react with
the EP test. The following product limitations are included in the package insert:
· Norovirus GIII, GIV.2, and GV are not expected to be detected based on in silico
analysis.
· Rotavirus genogroups B, D, and NADRV are not expected to be detected by EP
based on in silico analysis. In addition, Rotavirus genogroup C strains are not
expected to be detected by EP, with the exception of porcine strains within this
genogroup.

· One of three replicates of low-titer Rotavirus with Loperamide HCl gave a false
positive result for Norovirus; however the Rotavirus was detected correctly for
this sample.
· One of three replicates of low titer Rotavirus with Zinc Oxide gave a false
positive for Salmonella; however the Rotavirus was detected correctly for this
sample.
Six additional replicates were tested for both of these samples and the additional testing
yielded no further false positive results and therefore Loperamide HCl and Zinc Oxide
are not considered to interfere with the EP test. In summary, the Interference Study
results indicate that the substances evaluated should not affect the performance of the EP
test for detection of Norovirus and Rotavirus.
i. Fresh versus Frozen Study
Refer to K140083 for Fresh versus Frozen Study results for previously cleared EP
bacterial analytes.
A fresh versus frozen equivalency study was performed to support inclusion of frozen
samples in analytical studies as well as inclusion of frozen archived specimens in the
clinical study. The study included samples prepared with three viral strains at five
concentrations prepared in a 3-fold serial dilution series in NSM. Baseline testing of the
freshly-prepared samples was performed in replicates of four; the four remaining vials
were stored frozen at <70ºC then thawed and tested. For demonstration of equivalence,
the study acceptance criteria required detection of each targeted analyte in fresh and
frozen samples with no higher than a 3-fold difference in the lowest concentration
detected in fresh versus frozen samples.
Study results for both Norovirus strains demonstrated that the lowest concentration for
which all replicates were detected was identical for fresh and frozen samples. For
Rotavirus, frozen samples were detected at a 3-fold higher concentration than fresh
samples, thereby meeting the predefined acceptance criteria. Therefore the fresh versus
frozen study results shown in the table below in combination with study results for the
bacterial analytes (K140083) support the use of simulated samples subjected to a single
freeze/thaw cycle interchangeably with fresh/unfrozen simulated samples in the analytical
studies. Additionally, these study results support the use of archived frozen specimens in
the clinical study.

j. Carryover/Cross-Contamination
Refer to K140083 for Carryover/Cross-Contamination Study results for previously
cleared EP bacterial analytes.
In order to assess the EP assay for potential carryover or cross-contamination from high
positive Norovirus and Rotavirus samples, positive samples (100x LoD) prepared in
NSM were tested in an alternating pattern with negative samples comprised of NSM
only. The following Norovirus and Rotavirus strains were evaluated on three different
Verigene Processor SP instruments as shown in the following tables.

The study results demonstrated that all nine negative samples yielded the
expected “Not Detected” call for all EP analytes. These results combined with
the initial carryover study results for the EP bacterial analytes (K140083)
demonstrate that the carryover/cross contamination rate for the EP test is
acceptable.

In order to assess the EP test for potential competitive inhibition for the Norovirus and
Rotavirus targets, samples were tested that contained various combinations of each viral
target with other EP bacterial and viral EP test panel organisms. Contrived samples were
prepared in NSM with Norovirus and Rotavirus present at approximately 3x LoD mixed
with high concentrations of each potentially interfering organism (>106 CFU/mL). Testing
was performed in triplicate for each unique sample combination. The EP test correctly
detected both expected targets for all sample combinations with one exception in which
one of three replicates of the low titer Rotavirus/high titer Y. enterocolitica sample gave a
false negative result for Rotavirus. Testing of an additional six replicates of this
combination yielded correct calls for both organisms suggesting that high
concentrations of Y. enterocolitica should not interfere with the detection of Rotavirus
by EP.
Evaluation of Potential Interference from Non-targeted Microorganisms
A study was performed to evaluate whether 14 microorganisms commonly present in
stool may interfere with the EP test for detection of Norovirus and Rotavirus. Samples for
this study were prepared in NSM with Norovirus GI and Rotavirus A strains at 3x LoD
mixed with each potentially interfering organism at >107 CFU/mL for bacteria, and 9×106
cells/mL and 7×105 cells/mL respectively for parasites Blastocystis hominis and
Entamoeba histolytica. Additional samples containing only Norovirus or Rotavirus were
included as control samples. Testing was performed in triplicate with the organisms
listed in the following table.
Organisms tested
Genus Species
Bacteroides fragilis
Prevotella oralis
Prevotella melaninogenicus
Bifidobacterium bifidum
Clostridium perfringens
Enterobacter aerogenes
Enterococcus faecalis
Escherichia coli
Klebsiella pneumonia
Lactobacillus acidophilus
Staphylococcus aureus
Blastocystis hominis
Entamoeba histolytica
Candida albicans
The EP test correctly identified the expected analyte for all replicates of each organism
combination, demonstrating that high concentrations of non-targeted organisms did not
interfere with the ability of the EP test to detect Norovirus and Rotavirus.
l. Assay cut-off:
The presence or absence of each EP target analyte is determined by the mean intensity of
target capture spots relative to the Signal Detection Threshold. The capture, mediator,

and PCR primer oligonucleotides in the EP test are designed to eliminate sequence-
related cross-reactivity, resulting in non-specific target signal intensities at capture spots
that are similar to the microarray background signal. In contrast, target amplicon
hybridization to complementary capture and mediator probes are expected to give signals
that are well-separated from negative capture spots. When reading a test slide, multiple
images of each array are taken at increasing exposures times and the final target group
mean intensity value for an analyte is assigned at the shortest exposure at which the
intensity exceeds the Signal Detection Threshold. If none of the target signal exceeds the
threshold for any exposure, the mean spot intensity is evaluated at the longest exposure
taken. With this imaging and analysis design, a signal detection threshold of 30,000 was
established to generate a “Detected” call for the eight bacterial target spot groups, four
virus target spot groups, and two controls of the EP test.
In order to demonstrate the appropriateness of the cut-off value for the selected threshold,
the target mean intensity values observed with the EP test were examined for the final
LoD confirmatory tests for the bacterial and viral targets. Data from 16 bacterial strains,
four viral strains, and two negative samples were evaluated. With replicates of 20 for
each of 22 samples and 14 unique target spot groups evaluated per test, a total of 6160
data points (1320 expected positive) were assessed in the study.
A logistic fit analysis of Expected Results by Target Mean Intensity for the chosen
threshold demonstrated that expected positive signals are well separated from the
expected negative target signal and therefore the chosen threshold value distinguishes the
“True Positives” from the “True Negatives”. The selected threshold was then validated in
the pivotal clinical study.

3. Clinical study
Refer to K140083 for additional details regarding Clinical Study results for previously
cleared EP bacterial analytes.
The clinical evaluation of the EP test for Norovirus and Rotavirus was performed
concurrently with the clinical evaluation of EP bacterial targets for the initial clearance of
the EP test for bacterial analytes (K140083). Due to insufficient positive specimens for
Norovirus and Rotavirus, the viral targets were not included for the initial clearance of
the EP test and therefore the original clinical study was extended at one clinical site in
25

--- Page 26 ---
order to obtain additional performance data for these viral analytes. For this submission
the Norovirus and Rotavirus results from the original clinical study were “unmasked” and
the performance data provided below includes study results from the original study
combined with results from the additional testing.
The clinical study was conducted at eight clinical study testing sites and was conducted
under IRB supervision at each testing and specimen acquisition site. De-identified Cary-
Blair specimens were enrolled from individuals for whom standard of care testing was
ordered. A portion of each leftover residual unformed stool specimen in Cary-Blair media
was obtained for testing.
The clinical study utilized the following four categories of specimens to establish
performance for the EP bacterial and viral targets:
· Fresh: Prospectively-collected fresh Cary-Blair specimens enrolled and tested at
the study test sites;
· Frozen: Prospectively-collected frozen Cary-Blair specimens enrolled and tested
at the study test sites;
· Selected: De-identified archived frozen specimens collected and stored in Cary-
Blair media were obtained from the specimen acquisition sites. These specimens
were shipped frozen from each specimen acquisition site to the Sponsor, blinded
and sent to clinical testing sites. In parallel, each specimen was tested by analyte-
specific PCR amplification and bi-directional sequencing (BDS) to confirm the
original result. If the original analyte identification could not be confirmed, the
specimen was excluded from the study dataset.
· Contrived specimens (for selected bacterial analytes)
Reference/Comparator methods for Bacterial Analytes: Each specimen was cultured and
suspected colonies were isolated and identified using an FDA Cleared Automated
System. All samples were enriched in MacConkey Broth for suspected Shiga toxin
producing organisms followed by EHEC EIA testing. In addition, bi-directional
sequencing (BDS) assays were developed to confirm the identity of targeted analytes.
Overall, these BDS systems were used in the EP test Clinical Study in various capacities:
(i) for species-level identification of clinical positives, if applicable, (ii) typing of
virulence markers (Stx1, Stx2), and (iii) discordant analysis between the EP test and the
reference method identification. An overview of comparator methods performed for the
bacterial analytes are listed in the following table:

Comparator Methods for Viral Analytes: For both the Norovirus and Rotavirus targets,
the comparator methods used for prospectively collected fresh and frozen specimens
were a composite of one real-time PCR and two conventional PCR assays. Positive
conventional PCR tests were confirmed with bi-directional sequencing. Specimens that
were positive by real-time PCR and negative by the first conventional PCR assay were
tested with a second conventional PCR assay and bi-directional sequencing, if
applicable. Specimens were characterized as negative when both the real-time RT-PCR
assay and the first conventional PCR assay were negative. The algorithm used to
determine the composite comparator result is shown in the following table:
Composite Test Algorithm for Norovirus and Rotavirus

Result w/BDS Result w/BDS Result Comparator Result
Positive Positive N/A Positive
Negative Positive N/A Positive
Positive Negative Positive Positive
Positive Negative Negative Negative
Negative Negative N/A Negative
The Norovirus comparator assays included three well-established, validated and
published assays from the CDC CalciNet Laboratory: a real-time PCR assay and two
conventional PCR assays. These assays were also used to quantitate and characterize
all Norovirus GI and GII strains used for LoD and analytical reactivity testing.
Validation of the three assays was performed by CDC and the acceptability of these
assays for use in the Norovirus composite comparator algorithm was supported by
literature references provided by the sponsor.
For the Rotavirus comparator assays, primers for the real-time PCR and one of the
conventional PCRs were obtained from published protocols. The second conventional
PCR was developed and validated by Nanosphere. None of the primers used for each of
three reference assays overlap with the EP test primers. Validation of the three
comparator Rotavirus assays included evaluation of each assay’s LoD and as well as
inclusivity testing.

Clinical Study Results
The clinical study included a total of 1940 evaluable specimens comprised of 1328
prospectively collected fresh and frozen specimens, 203 selected archived specimens
and 409 contrived specimens.
Following the clearance of K140083, confirmatory PCR sequencing results were
received for an additional nine selected archived specimens positive for EP bacterial
analytes that were not included in the original submission. These specimens included
one specimen for Stx1/Stx2, two specimens positive for Shigella spp., and six
specimens positive for Salmonella spp. For this submission, EP test results for these
nine specimens have been added to the valid clinical dataset evaluated for K140083.
A total of 2102 specimens were tested with the EP test at the eight study sites.
Excluded specimens included 60 fresh prospectively-collected, 73 selected specimens,
and three simulated specimens. Of the remaining 1966 specimens, 26 specimens had a
final No Call resulting in 26 indeterminate specimens. The following tables show the
number of clinical specimens, arranged by site, determined to be valid, indeterminate,

In the Verigene EP Methods Comparison study, 1328 prospectively collected fresh and
frozen specimens were obtained from multiple medium to large-sized healthcare
institutions geographically distributed across the United States. The number and
percentage of positive cases (positivity rate) determined by Verigene EP stratified by
geographic region for each of the organisms detected by the test are presented in the table
below. Overall, EP detected at least one target in 11.2% (149/1328) of prospectively
collected specimens. In routine practice, prevalence rates may vary depending on the
institution, geographical location, and patient population.

N. Instrument Name:
Verigene® System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Verigene® System has one mode of operation available to the User. Prior to initiating
a test run the User places the sample into the sample loading well, loads the consumable,
and enters identifying information into the system. After the Processor SP run has
completed, the test cartridge is removed from the instrument and the reagent pack is
manually separated from the Substrate Holder. The barcode on the substrate holder is
scanned prior insertion into the Reader. The Reader images the Substrate and
automatically determines the test result without further user intervention.

2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes __X______ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
All tests must be ordered through the Verigene Reader. No tests can be processed on the
Verigene Processor SP without the user entering the Test Cartridge ID and Sample ID
into the Verigene Reader.
The User enters the Test Cartridge ID by scanning the barcode using the barcode scanner
attached to the Reader. The user may manually enter in the Test Cartridge ID by selecting
MENU and ‘Enter Barcode’ and then keying in the Test Cartridge ID number with the
Reader’s keyboard. The User has the option to scan the Test Cartridge Cover’s 2D
barcode using a barcode gun-style scanner to display the Test Cartridge’s Reference
Number, Expiration Date, and Lot Number on reports. The User enters the Sample ID by
scanning or manually entering the Sample ID using the Reader’s touch-screen keyboard
then confirming the Sample ID in the software.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The user is instructed to perform the following steps after which all specimen handling is
performed by the automated Verigene System:
· Put on fresh gloves.
· For each Cary-Blair preserved specimen to be tested, place one sterile flocked
swab and one uncapped Stool Prep Buffer tube (place the cap to the side for
recapping later) into a biological safety cabinet (BSC).
· Wipe down the outside of the specimen vial with a lint-free decontaminating
wipe.
· Invert the vial containing the Cary-Blair preserved specimen twice and vortex the
specimen for 5-10 seconds to ensure homogeneity.
· To prepare the Stool Prep Buffer tube, dip the provided flocked swab into either
the primary Cary-Blair preserved specimen vial or the secondary tube until the
flocked tip is fully immersed in specimen. Once evenly coated, transfer the swab
to the Stool Prep Buffer tube and break swab at the pre-formed scored breakpoint.
Leave the swab in the Stool Prep Buffer tube and screw the cap finger tight on to
Stool Prep Buffer tube.
· Recap the original, primary Cary-Blair preserved specimen container and set
aside.
· Repeat steps 1-6 for each specimen, changing gloves between each specimen.
· Vortex each Stool Prep Buffer tube for 15-20 seconds.
