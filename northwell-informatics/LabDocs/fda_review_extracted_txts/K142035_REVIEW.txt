K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
ISO 14971: Medical devices – Application of risk management of medical devices
L. Test Principle:
The sample (whole blood) is drawn into the tip of the test strip by capillary action.
Glucose in the sample reacts with glucose oxidase and hexaammineruthenium (III)
chloride in the test strip. This produces hexaammineruthenium (II) chloride.
Hexaammineruthenium (II) chloride is produced in proportion to the glucose
concentration of the blood sample. Oxidation of the hexaammineruthenium
(II) chloride produces an electric current. The meter converts the current to the
glucose concentration and displays it as the test result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The GLUCOCARD 01-mini Blood Glucose Monitoring System and ReliOn Micro
Blood Glucose Monitoring System are the same system under two brand names. The
only difference between the two systems is the outer case design and material. As
such, separate performance testing was not necessary for each brand, a common name
of “meter” and “strips” is therefore referred to in the below described performance
studies.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision was evaluated using venous blood samples collected in
sodium heparin tubes. The pooled sample was glycolyzed overnight,
oxygenated to 60 - 80 mmHg pO2 and adjusted to a hematocrit of 41-44%.
The whole blood pool was divided into aliquots and spiked with concentrated
glucose solution to achieve five different glucose concentrations, 30-50, 51-
110, 111-150, 151-250, and 251-400 mg/dL. Each sample was measured in 10
replicates with 10 meters using each of the three lots of test strips (N=100/lot).
Reference glucose concentrations were determined with a YSI Model 2300.
Results are summarized below:

concentrations adjusted to create high (800 mg/dL) and low (10mg/dL) pools.
These high and low pools were combined in various volume ratios to produce
15 test samples with glucose concentrations ranging from 10 – 750 mg/dL.
The YSI reference concentrations at each level are: 13, 23, 43, 74, 95, 123,
204, 263, 333, 406, 500, 520, 567, 685, 764 mg/dL. Each sample was tested in
singlicate using 10 meters and 3 lots of test strips. The meter was configured
to allow the reporting of results outside the ‘LO’ and ‘HI’ limits (i.e. below 20
mg/dL and above 600 mg/dL). Lot specific meter values were plotted against
the YSI reference values in the liner regression analysis (N=150). The result
of the regression analysis is summarized in the below table:
Strip Lot Slope 95% CI slope Intercept 95% CI R2
/Meter intercept
Lot 1 1.06 1.05 to 1.07 -6.251 -10.08 to -2.42 0.998
Lot 2 1.05 1.04 to 1.06 -7.965 -12.13 to -3.80 0.998
Lot 3 1.05 1.04 to 1.06 -8.125 -12.10 to -4.15 0.998
Combined 1.05 1.05 to 1.06 -7.45 -9.76 to -5.14 0.998
Based on these results, the sponsor claims a measuring range of 20-600 mg/dL
for the proposed glucose monitoring system.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Traceable to NIST SRM 917c
Stability:
Test Strip Stability:
The sponsor provided real-time and accelerated studies to verify the closed-
and open- vial stability of the test strips. The stability studies were reviewed
and found to be acceptable. The closed-vial claim is 18 months when stored at
of 18 months at 1-30 °C (34-86 °F) and 20-80% relative humidity. The open-
vial stability claim is 3 months when stored at 1-30 °C (34-86 °F) and 20-80%
relative humidity.
Control Solution:
The control solutions were previously cleared and stability and value
assignment was previously established in k073416. The names of the control
solution levels have been changed from L, N and H to L1, L2 and L3.
When stored at 34-86°F (1-30°C), unopened controls have an 18-month shelf
life and are stable for 3 months after opening.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference
Interference studies were conducted in accordance with CLSI EP7-A2. Stock
interferent solutions were prepared and spiked in aliquots of the low (100
mg/dL) and high glucose (300 mg/dL) whole blood pools to achieve final
concentrations listed in the following table. “Untreated” control samples were
spiked with the carrier solvent only. The glucose concentration of each test
sample was determined with five meters using 3 lots of strips. The highest
concentration for each substance that did not show interference, as defined by
the sponsor, is tabulated below.
With the exception of pO , all other substances tested did not interfere with
2
glucose measurements based upon the sponsor’s definition of significant
interferences (bias > ± 10% compared to un-spiked samples of glucose ≥ 75
mg/dL, or > ± 10 mg/dL for samples with glucose concentrations < 75
mg/dL). The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling: “Patients
undergoing oxygen therapy may yield false results”.

and palm. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary
action.
5. Calibration:
The meter is automatically coded. No calibration is required.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor manufactures three levels of glucose control solution, L1, L2, and L3
to be used with the GLUCOCARD™ 01-Mini Blood Glucose Monitoring System
and the ReliOn Micro Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The L2 Control is
included only in the System Kit for the GLUCOCARD™ 01-Mini Blood Glucose
Monitoring System. Otherwise, these control solutions must be purchased
separately. Instructions for how to purchase the control solution are provided in
the user manuals. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test
strip vial label. If the control values fall outside these ranges, the user is referred
to the user manual and customer support for assistance.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Sample volume study
Venous whole blood was collected and prepared to establish glucose levels of
approximately 50, 130 and 300 mg/dL. Sample volumes ranging from 0.15 μL to
10 μL were tested using 3 lots of strips and five meters. The sponsor defined
acceptance criteria as bias of <10 mg/dL (for glucose concentrations < 75 mg/dL)
or 10% (glucose concentrations >=75 mg/dL) for the various sample volumes
tested in reference to control volume of 1 μL. Based on the results, the sponsor
concluded that the proposed device provides accurate results with sample volumes
as low as 0.3 μL.
2. Altitude study
An altitude study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude up to 10,000
feet on performance of the blood glucose monitoring system. Venous whole
blood samples at four glucose concentrations approximately 60, 150, 300, and 450
mg/dL were tested on one lot of test strips. Each sample was also evaluated by the
YSI method. The results met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria and demonstrated
that the performance of the Blood Glucose Monitoring System is not affected by
altitude up to 10,000 feet.
3. Hematocrit study:
The effect of hematocrit on the performance of the meter and test strip was
evaluated. Eight hematocrit levels (25-60%) each at 9 glucose concentrations
(30.2 - 425.8 mg/dL) were tested using three lots of test strips and ten meters.
Sample bias was calculated relative to the YSI reference method. The results
13

support the sponsor’s claim that the system is accurate in hematocrit range of 30-
55%.
4. Test system operating conditions:
Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated for temperatures
ranging from 10oC to 40oC and relative humidity range from 20% to 80%
including extreme combinations of temperature and humidity, e.g. lowest
humidity with lowest and highest temperature and highest humidity with lowest
and highest temperature. Protocols and acceptance criteria were provided and
found to be acceptable.
5. EMC Testing:
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic
testing (EMC) had been performed.
6. Software documentation:
The software documentation was reviewed and found to be acceptable.
7. Infection control studies:
The devices are intended for single–patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies
were performed using constituent surface materials of the GLUCOCARD 01-Mini
meter, the ReliOn Micro Blood Glucose Meters by an outside commercial testing
lab demonstrating complete inactivation of duck hepatitis B Virus (DHBV) with
the chosen disinfectant, Clorox Germicidal Wipes (EPA Reg. No: 67619-12).
Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there
was no change in performance or external materials of the meter after 416
cleaning and disinfection cycles, using Clorox Germicidal Wipes, to simulate
cleaning twice a week over 4 years of single-patient use. Labeling has been
reviewed for adequate instructions in validated cleaning and disinfection
procedures.
