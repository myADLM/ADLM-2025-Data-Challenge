H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Cepheid Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay is an automated, multiplex real-time, reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay intended for the in vitro
qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV) viral RNA. The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay uses nasopharyngeal
swab and nasal aspirate/wash specimens collected from patients with signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection. The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay is intended as an aid
in the diagnosis of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infections in conjunction
with clinical and epidemiological risk factors.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus infection
and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management
decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2013-2014
influenza season. When other novel influenza A viruses are emerging, performance
characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel
virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral
culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to
receive and culture specimens.
Ancillary Specimen Collection Kit
Xpert® Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit
The Xpert Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve and
transport nasopharyngeal swab specimens and to preserve and transport nasal
aspirate/wash specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory
infection prior to analysis with the Xpert Flu Assay or the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay.

I. Device Description:
The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay is a rapid, automated in vitro diagnostic test for
qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV). The assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert Instrument
Systems (GeneXpert Dx systems and GeneXpert Infinity Systems). The GeneXpert
Instrument System platform automates and integrates sample purification, nucleic acid
amplification, and detection of the target sequence in simple or complex samples using
real-time PCR and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays. The systems require
the use of single-use disposable cartridges (the Xpert Flu/RSV XC cartridges) that hold
the PCR reagents and host the PCR process. Because the cartridges are self-contained
and specimens never come into contact with working parts of the instrument modules,
cross-contamination between samples is minimized.
The single-use, multi-chambered fluidic cartridges are designed to complete sample
preparation and real-time RT-PCR for detection and differentiation of influenza A,
influenza B and RSV viral RNA in approximately 60 minutes or less. The GeneXpert
Instrument Systems, comprised of the GeneXpert Dx Systems and the GeneXpert
Infinity Systems, have 1 to 80 randomly accessible modules, depending upon the
instrument, that are each capable of performing separate sample preparation and real-
time PCR and RT-PCR tests. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing
fluids (i.e., the syringe drive activates the plunger that works in concert with the rotary
valve in the cartridge to move fluids between chambers), an ultrasonic horn for lysing
cells or spores, and a proprietary I-CORE® thermocycler for performing real-time PCR
and RT-PCR and detection.
Specimens are collected following the user’s institution standard procedures for
collecting NA/W specimens and NP swab specimens for influenza and RSV testing.

The Cepheid Xpert Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit or Cepheid’s Sample
Collection Kit are required for the assay but not provided in the kit.
Quality Control
The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay includes reagents for the detection and differentiation of
influenza A, influenza B, and RSV viral RNA directly from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab
and nasal aspirate/wash (NA/W) specimens collected from patients with signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe
Check Control (PCC) are also included in the cartridge. The SPC is an armored RNA
pseudovirus present to control for adequate processing of the target viruses and to
monitor the presence of inhibitors in the PCR reaction. It is composed of RNA
fragments which do not share any homology to assay gene targets. The Probe Check
Control (PCC) verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe
integrity and dye stability.
Results Interpretation
The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay has two channels (Flu A 1 and Flu A 2) to detect most
influenza A strains. The primers and probes in the Flu A 1 channel have 100%
homology to human influenza A strains. The primers and probes in the Flu A 2
channel have approximately 80% homology to human influenza A strains. All
influenza A strains detected by the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay are reported as Flu A
POSITIVE.
The results are interpreted by the GeneXpert Instrument System from measured
fluorescent signals and embedded calculation algorithms and will be shown in the View
Results window. All possible results are shown in Table 1.

RNA targets. The primers and probes in the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay are designed to
amplify and detect unique sequences in the genes which encode for the following proteins:
Flu A Matrix (M), Flu A Basic Polymerase (PB2), Flu A Acidic protein (PA), Flu B Matrix
(M), Flu B Non-Structural protein (NS), and the RSV A and RSV B Non-Structural
proteins. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) verifies adequate lysis of the target virus and
sample processing, and detects assay interference. The SPC is mixed with the sample
automatically inside the test cartridge to control for adequate sample processing and to
monitor the integrity of the RT-PCR assay. Sample organism and SPC are lysed using an
ultrasonic device on-board the GeneXpert Instrument. A pump dispenses fluid to and from
different cartridge chambers and the PCR and RT-PCR amplification and fluorophore
detection occur within the I-CORE module of the instrument.

three sites (10 specimens x 1 time/day x 10 days x 2 operators x 3 sites). Each site
used a different GeneXpert Instrument (running the same analytical software) for
the analysis. The reproducibility and precision study specimen panel consisted of
one seasonal influenza A strain (Flu A/Perth/16/09), one influenza B strain (Flu
B/Wisconsin/01/2011), and one respiratory syncytial virus (RSV-A/2/Australia/61)
strain. Virus strains were prepared in a simulated matrix: (2.5% (w/v) porcine
mucin, 1% (v/v) human whole blood in 0.85% sodium chloride (NaCl) formulated
in a 1X PBS solution with 15% glycerol). Each virus strain was prepared at three
concentration levels: a “high negative” sample with an analyte concentration below
the limit of detection, a “low positive” sample with an analyte concentration
approximately 1x the limit of detection, and a “moderate positive” sample with an
analyte concentration approximately 2x the limit of detection. Negative samples
included in the study were comprised of the simulated background matrix only. One
lot of Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay cartridges was used at each of the 3 testing sites.
The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay was performed according to the Xpert Flu/RSV XC
Assay procedure. For the preparation of the precision panel and reproducibility
panels, Cepheid established panel concentration levels and expected results for
panel members at those concentrations. This information is summarized in Table 3
below. Reproducibility results are summarized in Table 4.

During the panel preparation, it was noted that the final concentration of the Mod
Positive panel members were closer to 2x LoD than 3X LoD, but still within the
overall targeted range. The reproducibility of the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay was
also evaluated in terms of the fluorescence signal expressed in Ct values for each
target detected. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation
(CV) between-sites, between-days, and between-operators for each panel member
are presented in Table 5. One replicate was performed per day per operator,
therefore, operator and assay (within-run) precision are confounded.

Instrument System Precision
An in-house precision study was conducted to compare the performance of the
GeneXpert Dx and the GeneXpert Infinity instrument systems and to provide
supplemental information to the reproducibility of the assay. A panel of 10
specimens with varying concentrations of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV was
tested on 12 different days by two operators. Each operator conducted four runs of
each panel specimen per day on each of the two instrument systems (10 specimens
x 2 times/ day x 12 days x 2 operators x 2 instrument systems). Three lots of Xpert
Flu/RSV XC Assay cartridges were used for the study. The Xpert Flu/RSV XC
Assay was performed according to the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay procedure.
Results are summarized in Table 6.

The data demonstrated acceptable reproducibility as it shows ≥ 95% detection of all
analytes at the moderate positive level on all three instruments. Detection of low
positive specimens (1x LoD) was ≥ 90% for influenza B and RSV and 88.0% for
influenza A. Due to the relatively low LoD concentrations for RSV and Flu A, it is
believed that small variations in sample aliquots contributed to detection levels
below the anticipated 95%.

Shipping and Storage Stability
Storage conditions were evaluated for nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens and
nasal aspirate/wash (NA/W) specimens during the period between collection and
processing on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems. A specimen stability study was
conducted to establish transport and storage claims for specimens to be analyzed
with the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay. The following transport media were included in
this study: Becton Dickinson Universal Viral Transport Medium (UVTM), Remel
M5 Transport Medium, Copan Universal Transport Medium (UTM). Positive and
negative specimens were included in the study. Positive specimens consisted of one
seasonal Flu A strain (A/H3/Victoria/361/2011), one Flu B strain
(B/Wisconsin/01/11), and one RSV strain (RSV-A/Long/MD/56) spiked at 2x the
LoD into a simulated matrix. Negative specimens consisted of the simulated matrix
only.
Aliquots of each positive and negative specimen were stored at 2°C and 8°C to
represent the limits of the recommended refrigerated storage temperature range and
at 15°C and 30°C to represent the limits of the recommended room temperature
storage temperature range. Replicates of 8 positive specimens and replicates of 4
negative specimens were tested at T=0, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6
days, 7 days, and 8 days for 2°C and 8°C. Replicates of 8 positive specimens and
replicates of 4 negative specimens were also tested at T=0, 4 hours, 8 hours, 24
hours, and 48 hours for 15°C and 30°C. For extreme storage conditions, aliquots of
each positive and negative specimen were stored refrigerated at 2°C for 7 days.
Specimens were then transferred to 30°C and stored for 24 hours and then tested on
day 9 with the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay. These conditions represent the extremes
of all recommended storage temperatures and storage times. Replicates of 8 positive
specimens and replicates of 4 negative specimens were tested at T=0 and 9 days.
One replicate each of three external controls (one Flu A/B positive, one RSV
positive and one negative) was tested with the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay on each
day of the study. All positive and negative specimens at all storage conditions and
temperatures tested were correctly identified using the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay.
The study supports the recommended specimen storage conditions at refrigerated
(2-8°C) temperatures for up to seven days and at room temperature (15-30°C) for
up to 24 hours until testing is performed on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems for
all three transport media types: Becton Dickinson UVTM, Remel M5, and Copan
UTM. The study also supports specimen stability at an extreme storage temperature
and storage time (7 days at 2°C followed by 24 hours at 30°C, and tested on day 9)
for all three transport media.

Specimen Stability – Cartridge Hold Time Study
Xpert Flu/RSV XC samples that are prepared for testing on a GeneXpert Infinity
System may wait up to four hours for a GeneXpert module to become available
after the cartridge is loaded onto the System. During this wait time, the target viral
particles may degrade or become unstable such that a low positive signal is
rendered “NEGATIVE” by the Xpert Flu/RSV Assay. A Cartridge Hold Time
Study was performed to determine an acceptable maximum hold time for the Xpert
Flu/RSV XC Assay between sample addition and cartridge processing.
One lot of the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay was subjected to a sample hold time study
where the sample was added to cartridges to be held at three storage conditions
(ambient, 25°C/75% relative humidity, and 35°C) and processed at scheduled
hourly time intervals ranging from 0-5 hours. “Ambient” storage condition refers to
the controlled temperature of the open laboratory set to 72°F (22.2°C) ±5°F.
Chambers set to 25°C with 75% relative humidity and 35°C were monitored
continuously as part of Cepheid’s automated temperature monitoring and access
control system. Positive and negative samples were tested in replicates of eight.
Negative samples contained the simulated matrix only.

Limit of Detection (LoD)
LoD was established using two influenza A H3N2 strains, two influenza A 2009
H1N1 strains, two influenza B strains, two respiratory syncytial virus A (RSV A)
strains, two respiratory syncytial virus B (RSV B) strains, and one influenza A
H7N9 strain diluted into a negative pooled clinical matrix. The LoD is defined as
the lowest concentration (tissue culture infective dose, TCID /mL) per sample
50
that can be reproducibly distinguished from negative samples with 95%
confidence or the lowest concentration at which 19 of 20 replicates were positive.
Each strain was initially tested in a range finding study at 5 different
concentrations in replicates of 20 per concentration of virus. Testing was
performed with two lots of reagents across three testing days. The higher LoD
observed per strain and per lot was selected for verification. Verification of the
estimated LoD claim was performed on one reagent lot across a minimum of
three testing days using 20 replicates per strain.
The LoD was determined empirically as the lowest concentration that had 19/20 or
20/20 positive results. The LoD point values for each strain tested are summarized
in Table 8.

e. Analytical reactivity:
Analytical Reactivity
The analytical reactivity of the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay was evaluated against
multiple strains of influenza A H1N1 (seasonal pre-2009), influenza A H1N1
(pandemic 2009), influenza A H3N2 (seasonal), avian influenza A (H5N1, H5N2,
H6N2, H7N2, H7N3, H2N2, H7N9, and H9N2), influenza B (representing strains
from both Victoria and Yamagata lineages), and respiratory syncytial virus
subgroups A and B (RSV A and RSV B) at levels near the analytical LoD. A total
of 64 strains including 54 influenza viruses and 10 RSV strains were tested in
this study with the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay. Three replicates were tested for
each strain. Results are shown in Table 9.

Although this test has been shown to detect the novel avian influenza A (H7N9) cultured
material, the performance characteristics of this device with clinical specimens that are
positive for the novel avian influenza A (H7N9) virus have not been established. The Xpert
Flu/RSV XC Assay can distinguish between influenza A and B viruses, but it cannot
differentiate influenza subtypes.
f. Analytical Specificity:
The analytical specificity of the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay was evaluated by testing
a panel of forty-four (44) microorganisms consisting of 16 viral, 26 bacterial, and 2
yeast strains representing common respiratory pathogens or those potentially
encountered in the nasopharynx. One replicate each of three external controls (one
positive control for Flu A/B, one positive control for RSV, and one negative
control) was tested with the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay on each day of the study.
Bacterial stock cultures were prepared by suspending the bacterial growth from an
agar plate in PBS buffer containing 15% glycerol. All bacterial strains were tested
in triplicate at concentrations of ≥106 CFU/mL with the exception of one strain
which was tested at 105 CFU/mL (Chlamydia pneumoniae). Viral stock cultures
were propagated using recommended tissue culture cell lines and hemagglutination
assays were used to establish titers. All viral strains were tested in triplicate at
concentrations of ≥105 TCID /mL. Three replicates of a no template control
50
(background matrix diluted in background matrix) were also tested.
All the strains were diluted into a simulated background matrix. The simulated
background matrix consisted of 2.5% (w/v) porcine mucin, 1% (v/v) human whole
blood in 0.85% sodium chloride (NaCl) formulated in 1X PBS solution with 15%
glycerol, which was then diluted in UTM to a final concentration of 16.7%.
Negative specimens consisted of the diluted simulated background matrix only.
Dilutions were prepared daily and kept on ice prior to testing.

a1 out of the 3 original replicates tested as “Flu A Positive”. The Ct score associated with the false positive
was 39.4; near the cut-off of 40.0 for a positive call. An additional 23 replicates were tested and all 23 were
negative for all three analyte channels.
g. Potentially Interfering Substances:
In a non-clinical study, potentially interfering substances that may be present in the
nasopharynx were evaluated relative to the performance of the Xpert Flu/RSV XC
Assay. Negative samples (n = 8) were tested per each substance to determine the
effect on the performance of the sample processing control (SPC). Positive
samples (n = 8) were tested per substance with six influenza (four influenza A
and two influenza B) and four RSV (two RSV A and two RSV B) strains spiked
at 2x the analytical LoD determined for each strain. All results were compared to
positive and negative Universal Transport Medium (UTM) controls. The evaluated
substances are listed in Table 11 with active ingredients and concentrations tested
shown. There was no assay interference in the presence of the substances at the
concentrations tested in this study. All positive and negative replicates were
correctly identified using the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay.
FluMist vaccine samples were correctly reported as Flu A POSITIVE; FLU B
POSITIVE; RSV NEGATIVE as expected. Samples containing FluMist may
cause false positive results.

*FluMist contains live, attenuated influenza strains comprised of influenza A H3N2, influenza A H1N1, and
influenza B. FluMist tested positive for Flu A and Flu B and negative for RSV using the Xpert Flu A/B &
RSV XC Assay as expected. The strains listed in Table 12 were not tested in the presence of FluMist.
Negative samples were not tested in the presence of FluMist due to an inability to assess the effect of FluMist
on the SPC controls as compared to a positive sample.
Competitive interference
Competitive interference caused by clinically relevant co-infections of the targets in
the Xpert Flu/RSV XC was evaluated by testing individual influenza and RSV

strains at LoD and spiking in different influenza or RSV strains at a higher
concentration in a simulated background matrix. The concentration of each strain at
LoD ranged from 0.57 TCID50/mL to 2.0 TCID50/mL and the concentration of the
competitive strains ranged from 103 TCID50/mL to 104 TCID50/mL. Analytical
competitive interference was assessed using one (1) seasonal Flu A H3 strain
(H3/Victoria/361/2011), one (1) Flu B strain (Flu B/Mass/2/2012), one (1) RSV A
strain (RSV-A/2/Australia/61), and one (1) RSV B strain (RSV-B/Wash/18537/62).
Replicates of 20 were tested for each target strain and each competitive strain
combination. The normal binomial distribution with 20 replicate samples at LoD is
between 17 and 20 positive results based on the binomial distribution with N=20,
p=.95 (X~Bin(20,0.95)). Therefore, sets of 20 with 16 or less positives would be
rare and an indication of a competitive inhibitory effect due to high levels of a
competing analyte. One replicate each of three external controls (one Flu A/B
positive, one RSV positive and one negative) was tested with the Xpert Flu/RSV
XC Assay on each day of this study.
Under the conditions of the study using the normal binomial distribution with 20
replicate samples at LoD of between 17 and 20 positive results, no competitive
inhibitory effects were observed at the analytical LoD for each of the strains tested
in the presence of another analyte. The results for each analyte at LoD in
combination with another competitive analyte are shown in Tables 13 through 16.
The average Ct values for each strain tested at LoD without a competitive analyte
are taken from the Limit of Detection study.

f. Assay cut-off:
The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay detects Flu A, Flu B, and RSV targets. For Flu A,
Flu B and RSV, the valid cycle threshold (Ct) range is 12.0 to 40.0. A Flu A 1, Flu
A 2 cycle threshold (Ct) outside the maximum valid range is reported “Flu A
NEGATIVE”. A Flu B cycle threshold (Ct) outside the maximum valid range is
reported “Flu B NEGATIVE”. A RSV cycle threshold (Ct) outside the maximum
valid range is reported “RSV NEGATIVE”. The Ct cutoffs are included as
automatic calculations in the assay definition file (ADF) provided with the Xpert
Flu/RSV XC Assay.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
N/A
b. Matrix comparison:
To demonstrate that the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay performs equivalently in either
mid-turbinate (MT) swab clinical matrix or simulated matrix, an equivalency study
was performed. The MT swab specimens were collected from healthy individuals
and pooled to obtain a “clinical background matrix” for the equivalency study. The
simulated background matrix consisted of 2.5% (w/v) porcine mucin, 1% (v/v)
human whole blood in 0.85% sodium chloride (NaCl) formulated in 1X PBS
solution with 15% glycerol, which was then diluted in Copan UTM to a final
concentration of 16.7%. This simulated background matrix represents both swab
specimens and nasal aspirate/wash (NA/W) specimens. Both matrices were

Sensitivity (positive agreement) for all strains in both MT swab clinical matrix and
simulated matrix was 100% (Lower 95% CI = 94.5%) using the Fisher Exact
Method (all 65 positive samples for each strain in MT swab clinical matrix and
simulated matrix background were correctly reported positive for all strains).
c. Fresh versus frozen equivalency
Fresh and frozen specimen equivalency in the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay was
evaluated by testing individual influenza and RSV strains at three different
concentrations representing low positives (2x LoD), moderate positives (5x LoD),
and high positives (10x LoD) in simulated background matrix. Negative samples
consisted of simulated background matrix only. Fresh and frozen specimen
equivalency was determined using one seasonal Flu A H3N2 strain
(A/Victoria/361/2011), one Flu B strain B/Wisconsin/01/11), one RSV A strain
(RSV A/Long/MD/56), and one RSV B strain (RSV B/9320/MA/77). Replicates of
20 were tested for each specimen type and concentration. All positive and negative
specimens were tested fresh, after one freeze-thaw cycle, and after two freeze-thaw
cycles. There was no statistically significant effect in the performance of the Xpert
Flu/RSV XC Assay between fresh virus dilutions and two sequential freeze thaw
cycles for positive and negative samples. All positive and negative replicates were
correctly identified using the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity
A total of 1275 subject specimens were collected in the clinical study. Of the
1275 eligible specimens, 1254 were included in the study (16 specimens were
delayed for shipment for reference testing, 3 specimens leaked during transit or
were mislabeled, 1 specimen was not tested on the subject device within 24

hours, and one specimen was unresolved on the comparator assay). There were
18 indeterminate results on first attempt. One of the indeterminate results was not
retested according to protocol. Of the remaining 17 indeterminate results, 14
yielded valid results upon repeat testing resulting in 1250 results (657 NA/W and
593 NP swab specimens) included in the final dataset used for the analyses.
Three results were invalid and therefore not included in the final results. Of the
1250 specimens included in the data analyses, 637 were collected from female
subjects and 613 from male subjects. Collection and testing was performed at 6
geographically diverse locations representing intended use sites.
Age distribution of the patients from whom the specimens were obtained was as
follows: 332 (26.6%) of the specimens 5 years or younger; 258 (20.6%) from ages 6
to 21; 413 (33.0%) from ages 22 to 59; 235 (18.8%) from ages 60 or older; and 12
(1.0%) were from patients of unknown age.
The study included prospectively collected NP swab or NA/W specimens from
subjects with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. Inclusion criteria
required leftover specimens with volumes ≥ 2mL in order to allow for sufficient
aliquots for testing (0.6 mL to 0.8 mL for Xpert Flu/RSV XC testing, 1.0 mL for
reference method testing, and 0.2 mL available for sequencing in the event of a
discrepancy). Due to the low prevalence of some influenza strains during the study
season, the study population was supplemented with frozen specimens. Frozen
specimens consisted of archived positive specimens originally collected for
standard of care influenza testing between November 28, 2012 and May 3, 2014. A
fresh vs. frozen equivalency study was performed prior to including the frozen
specimens in the clinical study. Only those samples meeting the inclusion and
exclusion criteria were included. Specimens were tested on the Xpert Flu/RSV XC
Assay and an FDA-cleared molecular assay as the comparator method.
Specimens were tested with the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay within 24 hours of
collection (fresh) or 24 hours of thawing (frozen). Discordant results between the
Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay and the FDA-cleared molecular comparator assay were
further analyzed by bi-directional sequencing using primers different from those
used in the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay.
A total of 657 NA/W specimens were tested for influenza A, influenza B and
RSV by the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay and the comparator assay. Of the 657
NA/W specimens, 581 were fresh, prospectively collected and 76 were frozen,
archived specimens.
When testing fresh, prospectively collected NA/W specimens, the Xpert Flu/RSV
XC Assay demonstrated a PPA and NPA for detection of influenza A of 100%
and 100%, respectively, relative to the comparator assay. The Xpert Flu/RSV
XC Assay PPA and NPA for influenza B were 99.2% and 100%, respectively.
The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay PPA and NPA for RSV were 98.5% and 99.6%,
respectively.

--- Page 28 ---
When testing frozen, archived NA/W specimens, the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay
demonstrated a PPA and NPA for detection of influenza A of 97.1% and 100%,
respectively, relative to the comparator assay. The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay PPA
and NPA for influenza B were 100% and 100%, respectively. The Xpert Flu/RSV
XC Assay PPA and NPA for RSV were 84.6% and 100%, respectively. Results are
summarized in Table 18.

A total of 593 NP swab specimens were tested for influenza A, influenza B and
RSV by the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay and the FDA-cleared molecular comparator
assay. Of the 593 NP swab specimens, 190 were fresh, prospectively collected and
403 were frozen, archived specimens.
When testing fresh, prospectively collected NP swab specimens, the Xpert Flu/RSV
XC Assay demonstrated a PPA and NPA for detection of influenza A of 85.7% and
98.9%, respectively, relative to the comparator assay. The Xpert Flu/RSV XC
Assay PPA and NPA for influenza B were 100% and 100%, respectively. The
Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay PPA and NPA for RSV were 100% and 100%,
respectively.
When testing frozen, archived NP swab specimens, the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay
demonstrated a PPA and NPA for detection of influenza A of 99.0% and 92.8%,
respectively, relative to the comparator assay. The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay PPA
and NPA for influenza B were 98.8% and 100%, respectively. The Xpert Flu/RSV
XC Assay PPA and NPA for RSV were 90.4% and 99.1%, respectively. Results are

4. Clinical cut-off:
The assay cut-off was determined by analysis of pre-clinical data derived from a
beta study using the comparator assay. The valid minimum cycle threshold setting
for Flu A 1, Flu A 2, Flu B, and RSV was set at 12 Ct (Cycle threshold) because a
Ct cannot be calculated before the end of the minimum background subtraction
range, which is 10 cycles. The earliest Flu A 1, Flu A 2, Flu B, and RSV Ct
reported in true influenza A positive, influenza B positive, and RSV positive results
during pre-clinical testing was greater than 12 Ct. Pre-clinical testing of Flu A Ct in
NP and NA/W specimens indicated a Mean Ct of 23.55 with a standard deviation of
4.98 Ct. Testing of Flu B NA/W specimens indicated a Mean Ct of 24.52 with a
standard deviation of 4.20 Ct. Testing of RSV NP and NA/W specimens indicated a
mean Ct of 24.24 with a standard deviation of 4.60 Ct. The valid maximum cycle
threshold setting for Flu A 1, Flu A 2, Flu B, and RSV was set at 40.0 to account for
true positives with low viral concentrations.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The Xpert Flu/RSV XC clinical study included a total of 771 prospectively
collected fresh specimens and 479 prospectively collected frozen specimens. The
number and percentage of cases positive for one or more of influenza A, influenza
B, and RSV, as determined by the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay are shown by age
category and specimen type (NA/W or NP swab specimen) in Tables 20 and 21:
