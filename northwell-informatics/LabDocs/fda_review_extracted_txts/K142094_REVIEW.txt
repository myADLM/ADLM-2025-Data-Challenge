Recovery:
Bacterial recovery studies were performed using two methods based on CLSI M40-A2 to
determine recovery of viable enteric organisms. Dilutions of representative enteric
pathogenic microorganisms were prepared in physiological saline and used as inoculum.
For Method 1, 100 µL from each dilution of inoculum was added directly to the
FecalSwab tube. For each inoculum concentration, one tube from each of three device
lots was inoculated for each temperature / time storage condition. The inoculated tubes
were stored at 2 – 8 oC for 0, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours or at 20 – 25 oC for 0, 6, 24 and 48
hours. After storage, 100 µL from each device was transferred to each of three plates of
appropriate culture medium and spread across the surface using a sterile spreader. The
inoculated plates were incubated under appropriate conditions. Manual colony counts
were performed. Plate counts from dilutions generating 25 – 250 colony forming units
(CFU) were considered valid for determining the organism concentration. The average
CFU from the nine plates (three plates per lot x three lots) for each temperature / time
storage condition was compared to the CFU at time zero.

For Method 2, 100 µL from each dilution of inoculum was absorbed by each of three
swabs from each of three lots of Copan FecalSwab System. The swab was then added to
the device tube. The inoculated tubes were stored at 2 – 8 oC for 0, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours
or at 20 – 25 oC for 0, 6, 24 and 48 hours. After storage, the swab was removed from the
device and used to streak a plate of the appropriate culture medium. The inoculated plates
were incubated for 24 hours under appropriate conditions. Manual colony counts were
performed. Plate counts from dilutions generating 25 – 250 CFU were considered valid.
The average CFU from nine plates (three plates per lot x three lots) for each time /
temperature storage condition was compared to the CFU at time zero.
The acceptance criterion for Method 1 and Method 2 was an average CFU for the stored
FecalSwab Systems that was within 2 log of the time zero CFU.

Overgrowth:
No overgrowth limit is defined by CLSI M40-A2 for devices held at room temperature
(20-25 °C) because most commercial transport media cannot control for it. The capacity
of the Copan FecalSwab System to inhibit overgrowth of normal flora found in stool
specimens was evaluated using the procedure described for Method 2 above. A solution
of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was prepared in physiological saline and used to inoculate
three FecalSwab tubes from each of six lots. The inoculated tubes were stored at 2 – 8 oC
for 0, 24, or 48 hours. After storage, the swab was removed and used to streak the surface
of a nonselective culture plate.
The acceptance criterion was < 1 log increase in CFU, relative to time zero, after
10
storage of the FecalSwab tubes at 2 – 8 oC for 48 hours.

All FecalSwab tubes met the acceptance criterion, showing less than a 1 log increase in
CFU, relative to time zero, for swabs stored at 2 – 8 oC for 48 hours.
Bio-Burden:
Testing was performed in accordance with M40-A2. Ten FecalSwab kits from each of
three lots were included in the testing.
The acceptance criterion was < 2 bacteria in 10 microscopic fields examined for each
slide. All 10 of the FecalSwab kits from each of the three lots met the acceptance
criterion of less than or equal to two bacteria in 10 microscopic fields.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Shelf-life testing was performed at months 1, 8 and 16 after storage at 2 – 6 oC or 28
– 32 oC. Three lots of the Copan FecalSwab Collection, Transport and Preservation
System were included in the study. Stability was evaluated by testing for:
· pH
Acceptance criterion: pH must remain within the target range of 6.90 – 7.50
· Bacterial recovery of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella
sonnei. After storage under the designated conditions, the devices were inoculated
and held at 2 – 8 oC or 20 – 25 oC prior to plating. The inoculation and plating
methods described for Method 1 and Method 2 above were included in the study.
Acceptance criterion: the average CFU must remain within 2 log of the initial
10
time zero CFU.
Results of the shelf life testing:
· The target pH range for the medium of 6.90 – 7.50 was maintained for all devices
at each time point.
· The acceptance criterion of average CFU remaining within 2 log of the initial
10
microorganism CFU was met for all bacterial strains and each test condition.
These data demonstrate the ability of the Copan FecalSwab System to maintain pH

and bacterial viability under the intended use conditions and support the shelf life
claim of 15 months from the date of manufacture.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Not applicable.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison is not applicable for a bacterial transport medium. The device itself
does not provide a result that can be used in making a clinical decision.
Bench testing studies were performed to determine the ability of the Copan
FecalSwab Collection, Transport and Preservation System to maintain viability of
different strains of pathogenic enteric bacteria. Results of these studies demonstrated
recovery of bacteria within the acceptance criteria recommended in CLSI M40-A2.
Refer to Analytical Performance in Section M.1 above.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Not applicable.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
