K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Cocaine is an In Vitro Diagnostic competitive
immunoassay used to detect cocaine in human oral fluid. This is a ready-to-use homogenous
system that involves energy transfer between an acceptor fluorophore labeled to an antibody
and a donor fluorophore labeled to drug. The assay is based on competition between drug in
the sample and drug labeled with the donor fluorophore for a fixed number of binding sites
on the antibody reagent. When acceptor and donor fluorophores are brought into close
proximity through a binding event, energy transfer occurs. The fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (FRET) signal is measured at the wavelength of the acceptor fluorophore and
is inversely proportional to the amount of drug in the sample. A Cutoff Calibrator is used to
translate the sample measurement into a positive or negative result. Controls are used to
establish and monitor precision and accuracy.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All performance testing of the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Cocaine was
performed on the RapidFRET Integrated Workstation.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed using three lots of RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for
Cocaine. Negative oral fluid pools were spiked with Cocaine derived from NIST
weight traceable standards, at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175% and
200% of the cutoff level. The samples were analyzed in triplicate on 4 plates per day
over 5 days for a total of 60 data points. Each spike level was processed through a
RapidEASE collector and confirmed by LC/MS/MS.

b. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The cutoff calibrator and controls are prepared by spiking known concentrations of
Cocaine into synthetic oral fluid to obtain the cutoff level calibrator (20.0 ng/mL),
and the positive (30.0 ng/mL) and negative (10.0 ng/mL) controls. The negative (0
ng/mL) calibrator is drug free synthetic oral fluid. Calibrators and controls are
prepared from primary standards (Cocaine at 1 mg/mL in methanol) purchased from
a commercial vendor that uses NIST traceable weights and specific assays, such as
HPLC and GC/MS, to confirm drug levels.
Value Assignment – Calibrators and Controls
Calibrator and Control lots are value assigned during the manufacturing process in
two stages. During the first stage new lots are assayed against a minimum of one
previously accepted, released and unexpired Calibrator and Control lot using
RapidFRET reagents. During the second stage, each new manufactured accepted
lot of Cutoff Calibrator, and of both Positive and Negative Controls is
quantitatively confirmed by MS based method for target analyte concentration, and
released only if the Sponsor’s acceptance criteria are met.
Calibrators and Controls Stability Studies
Real-time stability studies were conducted on multiple lots of RapidFRET Oral
Fluid Calibrators and RapidFRET Oral Fluid Controls. The stability protocols for

closed vial study results support the open vial stability claim of
30 days and closed vial stability claim of 12 months when stored at 2 to 8 ºC for
the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Calibrators and RapidFRET Oral Fluid Controls.
Sample Shipment - Stability Studies
A neat oral fluid pool was spiked with Cocaine to 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%,
100%, 125%, 150%, 175% and 200% of cutoff corresponding to approximately 0, 5,
10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 ng/mL concentration of Cocaine. Each spike was
subsequently processed through a RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collection device to mimic
the actual collection process as closely as possible. Aliquots were stored and handled
according to the collection device insert. Two sets of samples were shipped from
California to Maine multiple times by FedEx Standard Overnight Express over 8
days, (one set shipped at ambient temperature of 6.0 °C to 24.5 °C and high R.H. of
51.5% to 100% with most readings above 95% and the second set shipped at ambient
temperature of 0 °C to 24.0 °C and low R.H. of 2.0% to 48.5% with the majority of
readings less than 15%). Samples were assayed using the RapidFRET Oral Fluid
Assay for Cocaine before and after each shipment. In addition, at various time
points, aliquots were reserved and analyzed quantitatively by a mass
spectrophotometry based method. The physical integrity of the RapidEASE sample
tube was also evaluated following each shipment. The mass spectrometric
quantitative results for high R.H. and low R.H. exposed samples were consistent with
RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Cocaine results. Percent recoveries (at various time
points compared to time before shipping) ranged from 98.6% to 104.5% and 98.7%
to 104.7% for the samples exposed to high RH and low RH conditions, respectively.
Sample Handling and Storage - Stability Studies
Conditions for oral fluid sample handling and storage were evaluated by preparing
oral fluid samples with Cocaine from approximately 0% Cutoff (0 ng/mL) to 200%
Cutoff (40 ng/mL) in approximately 25% increments. Samples were processed
through RapidEASE oral fluid collection devices and stored under various
conditions including room temperature (21ºC to 28ºC) for 22 days, refrigerated (3ºC
to 7ºC) for 56 days, and frozen (-10ºC to -25ºC) for 231 days (MS data). Samples
were periodically sampled and analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry. For
each storage condition two sets of 9 levels each (18 total samples) were prepared and
analyzed individually. Percent recoveries ranged from 90.6% to 95.8% after
storage at room temperature for 22 days,
92.8% to 97.5% after 56 days of refrigeration, and 92.2% to 97.7% freezing for 231
days. Based on the sample handling and storage study results, the sponsor has
included the following statement in the labeling, “Room temperature storage for up
to 7 days, refrigerated storage (2ºC to 8ºC) up to 30 days and frozen storage (-10ºC
to -25ºC) for up to 6 months.”
Sample Recovery Study
Recovery studies were conducted by aliquoting neat, human oral fluid pool into
7

--- Page 8 ---
glass tubes and spiking with cocaine to achieve concentrations ranging from 0% of
cutoff (0 ng/mL) to 200% of cutoff (40 ng/mL) in replicates of five for each level in
increments of 25% (5.0 ng/mL). Approximately half of the volume of each of these
‘PRE-RapidEASE’ samples was then removed and processed through a new
RapidEASE Oral Fluid collector, mimicking as closely as possible the actual sample
collection protocol, resulting in a ‘POST- RapidEASE’ sample. The concentration of
cocaine in both the PRE- RapidEASE and the POST-RapidEASE samples for each
spike level were measured by Mass Spectrometry. Recoveries ranged from 92.0% to
108.5% for single point measurements with average (N=5) recovery values ranging
between 96.0% and 104.5% indicating complete recovery of analyte from the device
following collection.

To evaluate potential interference from additional food and dental
products, volunteers used the indicated product according to common
practice or product instructions, then provided an oral fluid sample
using the RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector. Each oral fluid sample was
then spiked with cocaine at approximately 50% (10 ng/mL) or 150%
(30 ng/mL) of cutoff. Samples were tested using the RapidFRET Oral
Fluid Assay for Cocaine. All samples spiked at 50% tested negative,
and all samples spiked at 150% screened positive.
