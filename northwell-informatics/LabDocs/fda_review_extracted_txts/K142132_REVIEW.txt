ii. STA-R®; STA Compact® and STA Satellite®: STA® PTT A (k861190)
Precision was also tested using three (3) lots of Pool Norm across all instruments
according to the following design. One lot of PTT A assay was tested with three (3)
lots of Norm Pool on the STA-R® and STA Compact® and STA Satellite®. One lot
of dRVV Screen and one lot of dRVV Confirm were tested with three (3) lots of
Norm Pool on the STA-R® and STA Compact® only. Within-laboratory SD and
%CV, as well as total SD and %CV were calculated. Study results met the pre-
determined acceptance criteria.
Reproducibility study
Reproducibility was conducted at three (3) sites - two external and one internal site.
The same three (3) lots of Pool Norm and one (1) lot of assay reagent were tested
across all sites, over five non-consecutive days including two runs per day, three (3)
replicates per run and three (3) operators.
The coefficient of variation (CV) and the standard deviation (SD) for within-run,
between-run, between-day and within-laboratory/total precision were calculated
separately for each site and each lot. In addition, the CV and SD for within-run,
between-run, between-day, between-lot and within-laboratory/total precision were
calculated for combined data of three lots of Pool Norm.
For pooled data obtained on the STA-R® at three sites (combined data from the three
lots), the CV% and SD for within-run, between-run, between-lot, between-day,
between-site and total precision were also calculated.
Results show that data met pre-determined acceptance criteria and demonstrated
acceptable reproducibility of the Pool Norm under tested conditions. Test data are

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability study
The open-vial stability and real-time stability claims were verified using STA®-PTT
A and STA®-Staclot® dRVV Screen and STA®-Staclot dRVV Confirm on the
STAR® analyzer. Three (3) lots of Pool Norm (three vials per lot) at each time point
were tested. The acceptance criteria for open-vial and real time stability were ≤ 5%
and ≤ 10%, respectively. The results met the acceptance criteria and supported open-
vial stability of 8 hours at 20±5oC and real-time stability for 24 months at 2-8oC.
Value assignment
Value assignment for the Pool Norm was based on data for both APTT and dRVVT
assays. Testing was performed in triplicate using 3 different lots of assay reagent
yielding 27 values. The determinations were carried out on a minimum of 3 analyzers
and by a minimum of 2 laboratory technicians over a minimum two days. The
