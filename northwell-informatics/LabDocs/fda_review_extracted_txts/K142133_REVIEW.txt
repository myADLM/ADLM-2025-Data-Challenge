4. Special instrument requirements:
Elecsys immunoassay analyzers
I. Device Description:
(1) Elecsys CMV IgM:
The Elecsys CMV IgM is a µ-capture immunoassay with streptavidin microparticles,
biotinylated recombinant CMV-specific antigen labeled with a ruthenium complex and
2

--- Page 3 ---
electrochemiluminescence detection. The results are determined using a calibration curve
which is instrument-specifically generated by a 2-point calibration and a master curve
provided via the reagent bar code. The test system contains the human serum-based
calibrators intended for use with the system.
The CMV IgM assay begins with an automatic 1:20 predilution of sample with Elecsys
Diluent Universal and the addition of biotinylated monoclonal anti-h-IgM-specific
antibodies.
During the second incubation, CMV-specific recombinant antigen labeled with a ruthenium
complexa and streptavidin-coated microparticles are added. Anti-CMV IgM antibodies
present in the sample react with the ruthenium-labeled CMV-specific recombinant antigen.
The complex becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin.
The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are
magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then
removed with ProCell. Application of a voltage to the electrode induces chemiluminescent
emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.
The analyzer automatically calculates the cutoff based on the measurement of Cal1 and Cal2.
The result of the samples is given either as reactive or non-reactive as well as in the form of a
cutoff index (signal samples/cutoff). Samples with a cutoff index (COI) < 0.7 are non-
reactive. Samples with a COI between 0.7 and < 1.0 are considered indeterminate (border).
Samples with a COI ≥ 1.0 are considered reactive.
(2) Elecsys PreciControl CMV IgM:
The Elecsys PreciControl CMV IgM contains liquid control serum based on human serum.
The controls are used for monitoring the accuracy of the Elecsys CMV IgM immunoassay.
The reagents and calibrators are packaged together in the Elecsys CMV IgM assay kit, while
the associated Elecsys PreciControl CMV IgM is packaged separately.

on-board reagent stability, and reagent stability stored alternately on-board the
analyzer and refrigerated.
1. Reagent Stability (Unopened) at 2 – 8°C: Shelf-life reagent stability for the
Elecsys CMV IgM assay was tested on one Elecsys 2010 immunoassay
analyzer. Three lots of reagent were evaluated using PreciControl CMV IgM
(Levels 1 and 2). A fresh kit was placed on the analyzer and calibrated.
Reference values for the PreciControl CMV IgM Levels 1 and 2 were then
determined. After measurement, the kit was closed and stored refrigerated (2-
8°C). The on-test reagent was stored at 2-8°C and PC CMV IgM materials
tested in duplicate at several time points and the acceptance criteria were met at
each time point. The Elecsys CMV IgM reagent was stable unopened at 2 – 8°C
up to 18 months, which supports the claimed shelf life of 15 months.
2. Reagent Stability (Opened) at 2 – 8°C: Reagent stability after first opening for
the Elecsys CMV IgM assay was tested on an Elecsys 2010 immunoassay
analyzer with duplicate measurements. A fresh kit was placed on the analyzer
and calibrated. Reference values for samples on-test were then determined.
After measurement, the kit was removed from the analyzer and kept at 2-8°C
for up to 13 weeks (92 days). Calibration was repeated and all samples were
placed on the analyzer and re-measured. The acceptance criteria were met for
reagent stability after opening at 2 – 8°C for 13 weeks, supporting the claim of
12 weeks.
3. On-Board Reagent Stability: On-board reagent stability for the Elecsys CMV
IgM assay was tested on one Elecsys 2010 immunoassay analyzer. A fresh kit
was placed on the analyzer and calibrated. Reference values for the samples
tested were then determined. After measurement, the kits were closed and stored
at 20°C ± 3°C to simulate on-board conditions. At specific time points, the kits
were placed on the analyzer, calibrated, and the original test samples re-
measured. Samples were measured in duplicate with one reagent lot in one run
per day. Acceptance criteria were met at each time point for 34 days, supporting
the on-board reagent stability claim of 2 weeks.
4. On-Board/Refrigerated Reagent Stability: On-board/refrigerated reagent
stability for the Elecsys CMV IgM assay was tested on one Elecsys 2010
immunoassay analyzer by comparing the stressed samples with the reference
samples. A fresh kit was placed on the analyzer and calibrated. Reference
values for the samples tested were then determined. After measurement, the kit
was closed and kept 5x4 hours on-board (20°C ± 3°C) per week; the rest of the
time it was stored refrigerated (2-8°C). The acceptance criteria were met,
supporting reagent stability up to 6 weeks when stored alternately in the
refrigerator and on the analyzer.
Sample Stability:
Four studies were conducted to evaluate sample stability: sample stability at 2 – 8°C,
8

--- Page 9 ---
sample stability at 20 – 25°C, sample stability at -20°C, and sample stability through
multiple freeze/thaw cycles.
1. Sample Stability at 2 – 8°C: Reference and on-test materials were tested in
triplicate on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer. Samples were measured directly after
collection (reference) and then stored at 2-8°C for 35 days. These samples were
tested after storage at 2-8°C at multiple time points up to 35 days. The on-test
recovery was calculated as a percent of the reference value. The acceptance
criteria were met, supporting sample stability up to 4 weeks when stored at 2 –
8°C.
2. Sample Stability at 20 – 25°C: Reference and on-test material (human serum and
plasma samples) was tested in triplicate and the controls were tested in duplicate
on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer. The samples were measured directly after
collection (reference) and then stored at 20-25°C for up to 10 days. The on-test
recovery was calculated as a percent of or difference from the reference value.
The acceptance criteria were met, supporting claimed sample stability up to 7
days at 20 – 25°C,
3. Sample Stability at -20°C: Reference and on-test material was tested in
triplicate on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer. The samples were measured
immediately after collection (reference) and then stored frozen at -20°C for
approximately 4 months (119 days). The samples were re-measured after 119
days of frozen storage at -20°C. The on-test recovery was calculated as a
percent of or difference from the reference value. The acceptance criteria were
met, supporting claimed sample stability for 3 months at -20°C.
4. Sample Stability Through Multiple Freeze/Thaw Cycles: Reference and on-test
material was tested in triplicate on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer. The samples were
measured immediately after collection (reference) and aliquots were
frozen/thawed 6 times. A sample measurement was taken after each freeze/thaw
cycle and the results compared to the reference result. The acceptance criteria
were met, supporting claimed sample stability through 5 freeze/thaw cycles.
Calibration Stability:
Two studies were conducted to evaluate calibration stability: lot calibration stability
and on-board calibration stability.
1. Lot Calibration Stability: The lot calibration stability was determined by
comparing the calibration for two kits of the same lot. On Day 1, the first
reagent kit was opened and calibrated, and samples were measured at Days 1
(reference), 29, and 36 on one Elecsys 2010 analyzer. All samples were
measured in duplicate with one reagent in one run per day on Days 1, 29, and
36. The acceptance criteria were met for lot calibration stability of 28 days on
the Elecsys 2010 analyzer.
9

--- Page 10 ---
2. On-Board Calibration Stability: On-board calibration stability for the Elecsys
CMV IgM test system was tested on one Elecsys 2010 analyzer. One reagent kit
was opened and samples were measured on Day 1 (reference). The same
samples were then retested after 15 days with reagent bottles stored at 20 ± 3°C
(on-board condition) using the calibration from Day 1. Recovery was calculated
based on the initial (reference) values. All samples were tested in duplicate with
one reagent lot on one Elecsys 2010 analyzer in one run per day on two days.
The acceptance criteria were met for on-board calibration stability of 8 days on
the Elecsys 2010 analyzer.
Calibrator Stability:
Two studies were conducted to evaluate calibrator stability: calibrator stability at 2 –
8°C and open vial calibrator stability.
1. Calibrator Stability at 2 – 8°C: Reference and on-test materials were tested in
duplicate with one reagent lot in one run per day on one Elecsys 2010 analyzer.
The on-test material was opened and stored at 2 – 8°C for 8 weeks. It was
measured at Day 1 (reference) and again at 8 and 10 weeks. The on-test
recovery was calculated as the signal (counts) of the reference value. The
acceptance criteria were met for calibrator stability at 2 – 8°C for 8 weeks.
2. Open Vial Calibrator Stability: Reference and open vial, on-test materials were
tested in duplicate with one reagent lot on one Elecsys 2010 analyzer. The on-
test material was opened and stored at 25°C for 6 hours to simulate on-board
conditions. Open vial (on-test) material was also stored at 32°C for 6 hours on
one Elecsys 2010 analyzer to simulate on-board conditions. Every hour, each
calibrator was tested and the on-test recovery of signal (counts) was calculated
as a percent of the reference value. The acceptance criteria were met for open
vial calibrator stability for 5 hours on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer.
Preci-Control Value Assignment:
The Elecsys CMV IgM calibrators and Elecsys PreciControl CMV IgM values are
assigned through at least six independent series of analysis performed on at least three
analyzers. All samples are tested in duplicate. The sample recovery (COI) is
calculated as the median of each sample as reference to the target value.
Stability of PreciControl CMV IgM:
Three studies were conducted to evaluate the stability of the Elecsys PreciControl
CMV IgM materials: control stability at 2 – 8°C, open vial control stability, and
shelf-life stability.
1. Control Stability at 2 – 8°C: Stressed and unstressed samples of PreciControl
CMV IgM were tested in duplicate with one reagent lot in one run per day on
one Elecsys 2010 analyzer. All samples met the acceptance criteria, supporting
the claimed PreciControl CMV IgM stability for 8 weeks when stored at 2 –
8°C.

2. Control Open Vial Stability: Reference and open vial, on-test controls were
tested in singlicate with one reagent lot on one Elecsys 2010 analyzer. The on-
test material was opened, kept at 25°C on the Elecsys 2010 to simulate on-board
conditions, and tested every hour for 6 hours. The on-test recovery of signal
(counts) was calculated as a percent of the reference value. The acceptance
criteria were met, supporting the claimed PreciControl CMV IgM open vial
stability of 5 hours on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer.
3. Control Shelf-Life Stability: The on-test material was stored at 2-8°C and tested
in duplicate on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer at several time points during and
beyond the shelf life time of 18 months. Stability was measured by comparing the
measurements of the stressed controls with the measurements of the unstressed
controls (reference). The acceptance criteria were met at each time point,
supporting the claimed PreciControl CMV IgM shelf-life stability of 15 months.
d. Detection limit:
Not Applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-Reactivity:
A study was conducted to evaluate the Elecsys CMV IgM for potential cross-
reactivity using samples from individuals with antibodies to various medical
conditions. Specimens (n = 205) were tested in duplicate with the Elecsys CMV IgM
assay and a comparator CMV IgM assay. The first result was used for the
performance evaluation. The presence of the potential cross-reactants in the samples
tested was confirmed using FDA-cleared devices or laboratory methods. Potential
cross-reactivity with autoimmune markers and antibodies against influenza
vaccination could not be ruled out from the study.

Interferences:
To evaluate the effect of elevated levels of hemoglobin, bilirubin, Intralipid, and
biotin on the CMV IgM assay, eight CMV IgM samples (negative, near cutoff and
positive) were spiked with the potential interferents. Each interferent was evaluated at
11 numerical values. All samples were tested in singlicate on the Elecsys 2010
analyzer. Acceptance criteria for hemoglobin, bilirubin, Intralipid, and biotin:
samples with COI < 0.7 to be found non-reactive, and samples with COI ≥ 0.7 to give
recovery of ±15%.
To evaluate the effect of rheumatoid factor (RF), 34 samples were spiked with
different concentrations of RF and measured in singlicate on the Elecsys 2010
analyzer as well as a comparator device. The acceptance criterion for RF was
agreement > 90% against the comparator device.
The results of the interference studies are presented below:
Interferent tested No interference up to (Concentration)
Hemoglobin < 0.621 mmol/L or < 1.0 g/dL
Bilirubin < 342 µmol/L or < 20 mg/dL
Intralipid < 1500 mg/dL
Biotin < 410 nmol/L or < 100 ng/mL
Rheumatoid factor < 2000 IU/mL
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off for the Elecsys CMV IgM assay was established with in-house studies by
characterizing samples using several commercially available CMV IgG and CMV
IgM assays. The specificity of the assay was evaluated using 931 samples from a low
prevalence cohort. The assay cutoff was optimized to increase sensitivity by
measuring 152 samples from individuals at different stages of primary CMV
infection. Validation of the assay cutoff was performed by external clinical studies.
The classification of samples, based on the cut-off establishment, verification, and
validation, is as follows:
• Sample results < 0.7 COI = Non-Reactive Sample
• Sample results ≥ 0.7 to < 1.0 COI = Indeterminate (Border) Sample
• Sample results ≥ 1.0 COI = Reactive Sample
g. High Dose Hook-Effect:
Testing with the Elecsys CMV IgM assay demonstrated no high dose hook effect.
Five highly positive, high-titer CMV IgM human samples were diluted with negative
human serum in a dilution series with 11 steps. Each dilution was tested in triplicate

with one reagent lot in one run on one Elecsys 2010 analyzer. No high dose hook
effect was observed up to 32.9 COI.
h. IgM Specificity:
To confirm that the Elecsys CMV IgM assay specifically detects IgM-class
antibodies, 11 samples with moderate to high levels of CMV IgM antibodies were
selected for testing. These samples were treated with dithiothreitol (DTT) to destroy
the IgM and then were retested using the Elecsys CMV IgM assay. Ten samples were
rendered non-reactive (negative) following treatment with DTT, and one sample had
an 82% decrease in COI value, confirming the specificity of the Elecsys CMV IgM
assay for detecting IgM-class antibodies. The Elecsys CMV IgM assay is designed to
specifically bind the anti-CMV IgM antibodies due to the µ-capture design and
antigens minimizing interference from CMV IgG antibodies.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison between Analyzers:
The equivalence of the Elecsys CMV IgM assay on the Elecsys 2010 and
MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 immunoassay analyzers was evaluated by a method
comparison study. Native serum samples were tested on one Elecsys 2010 analyzer
and one MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 analyzer. Positive and negative agreement
of the results between the two platforms was calculated and demonstrated
equivalence between the analyzer platforms for the determination of IgM antibodies
to CMV using the Elecsys CMV IgM assay:
Concordance Rates:
Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) = 97.98 %
Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) = 99.22 %
b. Matrix comparison:
Studies were conducted to evaluate the suitability of the following types of samples to
be used with the Elecsys CMV IgM immunoassay: Li-heparin plasma, K -EDTA
2
plasma, K -EDTA plasma, and serum separator tubes. Samples were collected into
3
matched serum and plasma collection tubes and assayed in duplicate. These studies
were conducted using negative (non-reactive), near cutoff (indeterminate/border) and
positive (reactive) samples. The results support the use of the following sample types:
Li-heparin plasma, K -EDTA plasma, K -EDTA plasma, and serum separator tubes.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
A multi-center study was conducted in the US to evaluate the performance of the
Elecsys CMV IgM immunoassay in comparison to a consensus result derived from 2
or 3 FDA-cleared devices (depending on the availability of sample volume for
testing). A two-out-of-three approach was used to determine the consensus result for
samples where three FDA-cleared devices could be tested. Where only two FDA-
cleared devices could be tested, results for which the FDA-cleared devices disagreed
were omitted from analysis. All equivocal results obtained using the Elecsys CMV
IgM assay were treated as not in favor of the Elecsys CMV IgM assay.
The main study was a prospective study consisting of 617 samples, all of which were
from a population of patients suspected of CMV infection for whom a CMV IgM test
was ordered. A subset of this population (n = 199) were pregnant women. In addition,
a retrospective study was conducted, consisting of 134 samples that were preselected
from a population of patients positive for CMV IgM as determined by the comparator
device consensus of 3 FDA-cleared CMV IgM assays. Testing of specimens was
done at three clinical sites and one internal site. The results of these studies are
presented in the following tables.
