I. Device Description:
The Anyplex™ II HSV-1/2 Assay uses PCR to generate amplified product from HSV-1 and
HSV-2 DNA present in clinical specimens. The presence of HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 target
DNA is indicated by the fluorescent signal generated through the use of fluorescently-labeled
oligonucleotide probes (duplex Catcher) on the Cepheid SmartCycler® II Dx instrument. The
probes do not generate a signal unless they are specifically bound to the amplified product. A
preparation of HSV-1 and HSV-2 plasmids is included as the positive control in the
Anyplex™ II HSV-1/2 Assay. The positive control serves to demonstrate that the HSV-1/2
PCR reagents are functional and to check the validity of the run. An internal control (IC) is
also included in the assay kit. The IC is added to each sample specimen during sample
preparation, and is also used to create a Blank Negative Control by adding a set amount to
viral transport media to serve as an extraction control. In addition, RNase-free water is used
to create the Negative Control by adding a set volume to the prepared master mix. Users are
instructed to include all three controls, Positive, Negative, and Blank Negative Control with
each test run.
The AnyplexTM II HSV-1/2 Assay detects and differentiates HSV-1 and HSV-2 genomic
DNA in a single assay utilizing Seegene’s TOCE™ technology. Clinical samples are spiked
with an Internal Control and DNA is extracted utilizing a standard QIAGEN QIAamp® DNA
Mini Kit. Extracted DNA is then mixed with the Seegene reagents and processed in a
Cepheid SmartCycler® II Dx System. In approximately 2.5 hours, results can be available,
including validity and acceptance criteria for the sample.
The one reagent kit for the Anyplex™ II HSV-1/2 Assay is sufficient for 50 reactions. The
kit contains:
• 10X HSV-1/2 TOM - consisting of TOCE Oligo Mix (TOM), amplification and
detection reagents

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): N/A
L. Test Principle:
The Anyplex™ II HSV-1/2 Assay is based on real-time PCR technology combined with
Seegene’s TOCE™ (Tagging Oligonucleotide Cleavage and Extension) technology on the
SmartCycler II Dx instrument system. A typical real-time PCR consists of denaturation of
purified DNA, primer annealing and extension. The detection of target by the TOCE™
technology depends on two novel oligonucleotides, the Pitcher and the Catcher. When the
PCR reaction initiates, Dual Priming Oligonucleotides (DPO™) specifically hybridize to the
Glycoprotein D gene of HSV-1 and HSV-2 and the portion of the Pitcher at the 3’-end binds
between the priming oligonucleotides. During PCR extension, the unbound 5’ portion (Tag)
of the Pitcher oligonucleotide is cleaved off by Taq DNA polymerase exonuclease.
Subsequently, the released Tag anneals to a dual-labeled and single-stranded artificial
template, called the Catcher. Extension of the Tag on the Catcher template results in a
Duplex Catcher causing the physical distance of the fluorescent reporter from the quencher to
increase, thereby generating signal. Thus, fluorescent signal is proportional to the
concentration of Glycoprotein D gene of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in the original specimen, and is

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Reproducibility:
Reproducibility studies were performed at three sites using three lots of reagent kits. Each
site tested one lot of the reagent kit. The test panel of seven members was prepared
randomized and blinded and tested for five (5) days non-consecutive days by two
operators with each operator running the panel, in triplicate, once a day for a total of 90
results per panel member. The panel was formulated using intact virus diluted in M4
Viral Transport Media. Panel members were prepared with a single target present (HSV-
1 or HSV-2) at three concentrations: ~3X LoD (High Positive), 1X LoD (Low Positive),
and ~0.125X LoD (High Negative). A seventh panel member (HSV Negative) was
prepared using M4 medium without HSV present. Reproducibility testing was carried out
using panels that had been randomized and blinded prior to providing to the test site. The
table below summarizes the results from each site as well as the combined results.

b. Precision:
The precision studies were conducted in-house using a five membered panel tested twice
a day by a single operator using one lot of reagents for twenty days. Panel members were
tested in triplicate for each run (for a total of 600 data points for the 40 runs). The panel
was prepared with a single target present (HSV-1 or HSV-2) at two concentrations:
HSV-1 Low Positive (1X LoD), HSV-1 High Positive (10X LoD), HSV-2 Low Positive
(1X LoD), HSV-2 High Positive (10X LoD), and HSV-1/2 Negative. The HSV-1/2
Negative member was prepared using M4 medium without HSV present. The table below

The Anyplex™ II HSV-1/2 Assay Positive Control, Negative Control, and Blank
Negative Control are included in each run to evaluate run validity.
• The Anyplex™ II HSV-1/2 Positive Control is constructed from plasmids
with gDNA extracts from HSV-1 HF (VR-260) and HSV-2 G (VR-734). The
Positive Control serves to demonstrate that the HSV-1/2 PCR reagents are
functional, and to check the validity of the run.
• The Anyplex™ II HSV-1/2 Negative Control is constructed of RNase-free
water added to the Master Mix prior to PCR. The presence of HSV-1 and/or
HSV-2 must not be detected in the Negative Control.
• The Anyplex™ II HSV-1/2 Blank Negative Control is comprised of Internal
Control added to blank VTM. The Blank Negative Control is carried through
sample preparation alongside the clinical specimens.
e. Detection limit:
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Limit of Detection (LoD) of the
Anyplex™ II HSV-1/2 Assay. The study was performed with two representative
strains of HSV-1 (MacIntyre and HF) and two representative strains of HSV-2 (MS
and G). A preliminary study was performed for each HSV-1 and HSV-2 strain. A
series of seven (7) 10-fold dilutions of virus was made in pooled negative matrix,
then tested with the Anyplex™ II HSV-1/2 Assay in replicates of three (3). Results
from the preliminary LoD estimation study were used to determine the range for the

LoD analysis. The last dilution with a 100% detection rate was used to prepare a
series of five (5) 2-fold dilutions using negative matrix as a diluent. These five (5)
dilutions were tested on three (3) Anyplex™ II HSV-1/2 Assay kit lots in replicates
of 20. Results from the three (3) kit lots were combined and the detection rate was
calculated for each dilution. From this study, the LoD was determined to be the
lowest concentration of target that was detected in at least 95% of the replicates.
The LoD of the Anyplex™ II HSV-1/2 Assay was determined to be 3.75 X 102

Analytical Reactivity/LoD Confirmation: In addition, an LoD confirmation study
using titered stocks of cultured clinical isolates obtained from a supplier was
conducted in house to confirm the observed LoD values for HSV-1 and HSV-2. A
total of 42 clinical isolates (21 HSV-1 and 21 HSV-2) were diluted to the observed
LoD in the negative matrix pool. Each HSV-1 and HSV-2 clinical isolate was
extracted and tested in 3 replicates using the three different lots of kit reagents (9
replicates for each isolate). All strains were detected by the assay, demonstrating that
the AnyplexTM II HSV-1/2 Assay can detect a broad range of HSV-1 and HSV-2
isolates.
f. Analytical specificity:
A study was performed to evaluate cross reactivity of the Anyplex™ II HSV-1/2
Assay with fifty (50) microorganisms that might be found in anogenital lesion
specimens. The panel members were obtained from suppliers as quantified cultures
(CF), or prepared in house (IHC) by growing each organism and quantifying the
culture. Bacteria were tested at 106 cfu/mL or higher and viruses were tested at
105 pfu/mL or higher. For bacteria that were difficult to obtain or grow, purified DNA
was used in the place of the intact microorganism and tested at a concentration of
≥ 1×106 genome copies/mL. Human DNA was tested at a concentration of 1 × 105
genome copies/mL. All samples were prepared by diluting microorganisms or DNA
into M4RT viral transport medium prior to testing for cross-reactivity. No
microorganisms tested positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2 using the Anyplex™ II HSV-1/2
Assay indicating no cross reactivity with these microorganisms.
To assess microbial interference, each test microorganism from the cross reactivity
panel was added to a sample tube with two representative strains of HSV-1
(MacIntyre and HF), and HSV-2 (MS and G) at 3X LoD in M4RT viral transport
medium. Each potentially interfering microorganism was tested in three (3) replicates
at the same levels used in the cross-reactivity study described above. No evidence of
microbial interference was observed for any of the 50 test microorganisms included in
the analysis.

g. Interfering Studies
This study was performed to evaluate potential interference with the Anyplex™ II
HSV-1/2 Assay with a panel of twenty-two (22) biological and chemical substances.
All of the potentially interfering substances were tested at concentrations at or above
physiological levels or typical usage levels with HSV-1 (MacIntyre) and HSV-2 (MS)
at 3X LoD to evaluate potential interference with the detection of the HSV-1 and
HSV-2 targets. The study was also carried out in the absence of HSV to evaluate
potential interference with the detection of the internal control of the Anyplex™ II
HSV-1/2 Assay. Each potentially interfering substance was tested in triplicate. No
interference was observed with any of the substances tested.

h. Specimen Stability in Viral Transport Media
The performance of the Anyplex™ II HSV-1/2 Assay was evaluated with respect to
the specimen stability in viral transport media such as Remel M4, Remel M4RT,
Remel M5, Remel M6, Copan Universal Transport Media (UTM), and BD Universal
Viral Transport (UVT). Each transport medium was spiked with HSV-1 or HSV-2
positive clinical specimens at 3X LoD and stored and tested at the following
temperatures and intervals: Refrigerated (2°C to 8°C)/Day 0, 3, 5, and 7; Frozen
(-200C)/Day 0, 15, 30, and 35. All samples were run in triplicate for all time points.
Testing consisted of removing specimens from storage temperature, thawing (if
frozen), extracting the DNA, and then running the Anyplex™ II HSV-1/2 Assay.
There was no interference observed with any of the viral transport media listed above
for the detection of HSV-1 and HSV- 2 target or the internal control. The study data
supported the stability claims for HSV-1 and HSV-2 specimens collected in Remel
M4, Remel M4RT, Remel M5, Remel M6, Copan Universal Transport Media (UTM),
and BD Universal Viral Transport (UVT) refrigerated (2°C to 8°C) for 7 days and
frozen (-20°C) for 30 days.
i. Competitive Inhibition
Competitive inhibition of the Anyplex™ II HSV-1/2 Assay was evaluated to assess
the potential for interference in HSV-1/2 target detection when both HSV-1 and
HSV-2 are present in a sample. The study was conducted by using simulated samples
with equal or varying concentrations of HSV-1 and HSV-2 (3X, 10X, 100X and
1000X LoD). The results showed that competitive inhibition was not observed when
the concentration of HSV1 and HSV2 strains are equal or varying. There was no
influence of competitive inhibition between HSV-1 and HSV-2 on the performance of
the AnyplexTM II HSV-1/2 Assay.
h. Carry-over/Cross Contamination
The analytical carry-over/cross contamination study was performed to assess the
potential for carry-over contamination of HSV target from a high-positive sample into
a negative sample during the Anyplex™ II HSV-1/2 Assay run. The carry-over/cross

contamination study was performed using HSV-1 MacIntyre and HSV-2 MS high-
positive (~100,000X LoD) samples in M4 medium. Alternating high positive samples
and negative samples (M4 medium) were extracted, placed in sequential wells of the
SmartCycler® II Dx and run. The run was repeated five (5) times.
No carry-over (0/100) or cross contamination (0/100) events were observed between
positive and negative samples.
j. Assay cut-off: Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The clinical performance evaluation was performed against a gold standard/reference
method i.e., Cell Culture using an enzyme linked virus inducible system with HSV
typing by fluorescently labeled antibodies.
b. Matrix comparison: N/A
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity: N/A
b. Clinical Specificity: N/A
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The performance of the Anyplex™ II HSV-1/2 Assay was compared with the
ELVIS® HSV ID/Typing Test System (Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc.) which is a gold
standard/reference method, i.e., Cell Culture using an enzyme linked virus inducible
system with HSV typing by fluorescently labeled antibodies.
Clinical Performance
The performance of the Anyplex™ II HSV-1/2 Assay was evaluated at three
geographically diverse locations within the United States. A total of 656 prospective
specimens were tested by the Anyplex™ II HSV-1/2 Assay and compared to results
obtained with the ELVIS® (Enzyme Linked Virus Inducible System) HSV ID and D3
Typing Test System (Diagnostic Hybrids, Athens, OH). The reference ELVIS viral
culture method used in this study is unable to detect co-infected specimens and
cannot identify HSV-1 if HSV-2 is identified first. Consequently, if a specimen was
positive for HSV-2, it was removed from the calculation of the HSV-1 clinical
performance. Quality Controls (positive, negative, blank negative, and internal
control) were run with each Anyplex™ II HSV-1/2 Assay run. The internal control
was introduced into each specimen and the blank negative control prior extraction.
Results from the prospective studies are presented in the tables below.

Positive and Negative Predictive Value: Hypothetical positive and negative predictive
values (PPV & NPV) for the AnyplexTM II HSV-1/2 Assay are shown below. These
calculations are based on hypothetical prevalence and overall sensitivity and specificity per
specimen type as determined in the clinical trial.
For HSV-1, these calculations are based upon an overall sensitivity and specificity of 98.9%
and 93.7%, respectively, for anogenital swabs.
For HSV-2, these calculations are based upon an overall sensitivity and specificity of 97.2%
and 93.6%, respectively, for anogenital swabs.
PPV was calculated using: (Sensitivity x Prevalence)/(Sensitivity x Prevalence + [1 -
Specificity] x [1 - Prevalence]).
NPV was calculated using: (Specificity x [1 - Prevalence])/([1 - Sensitivity] x Prevalence +
Specificity x [1 - Prevalence]).
