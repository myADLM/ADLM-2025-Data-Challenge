L. Test Principle:
The RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Methamphetamine is an In Vitro Diagnostic competitive
immunoassay used to detect methamphetamine in human oral fluid. This is a ready-to-use
homogenous system that involves energy transfer between an acceptor fluorophore labeled to an
antibody and a donor fluorophore labeled to drug. The assay is based on competition between drug
in the sample and drug labeled with the donor fluorophore for a fixed number of binding sites on
the antibody reagent. When acceptor and donor fluorophores are brought into close proximity
through a binding event, energy transfer occurs. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer
(FRET) signal is measured at the wavelength of the acceptor fluorophore and is inversely
proportional to the amount of drug in the sample. A Cutoff Calibrator is used to translate the sample
measurement into a positive or negative result. Controls are used to establish and monitor precision
and accuracy.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three reagent lots of the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Methamphetamine were analyzed
in 1-3 replicates per day on 1-4 plates per day for a minimum of 20 days. Negative oral fluid
pools were spiked with methamphetamine derived from NIST weight traceable standards at
0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175% and 200% of the cutoff level
corresponding to approximately 0, 12.5, 25, 37.5, 50, 62.5, 75, 87.5 and 100 ng/mL
methamphetamine. Each spike level was processed through a RapidEASE collector and
confirmed by LC/MS/MS.
Results for all lots are summarized below. All samples at concentrations higher than the
cutoff reported positive results, and all samples at concentrations lower than the cutoff
reported negative results.

Traceability
The cutoff calibrator and controls are prepared by spiking known concentrations of
methamphetamine into synthetic oral fluid to obtain the cutoff level calibrator (50 ng/mL),
and the positive (75 ng/mL) and negative (25 ng/mL) controls. The negative calibrator is
drug free synthetic oral fluid. Calibrators and controls are prepared from d-
methamphetamine (1 mg/mL) in methanol commercial primary standards from a vendor that
uses NIST traceable weights and specific assays, such as HPLC and GC/MS, to confirm
drug levels.
Value Assignment – Calibrators and Controls
Calibrator and Control lots are value assigned during the manufacturing process in two
stages. During the first stage following bottling and labeling, new lots are assayed against
previously accepted, released and unexpired Calibrator and Control lot(s) using RapidFRET
reagents. Results are qualitatively evaluated for performance relative to the previously
accepted lots. If any of the new material does not pass this stage of evaluation it is not
passed to the second stage.
During the second stage, each new manufactured lot of Calibrator or Control is
quantitatively confirmed by a Mass Spectroscopy based method for target analyte
concentration. Quantitative results within the sponsor’s acceptance criteria are released.
Quantitative results that do not meet acceptance criteria are not released pending
investigation and analysis.
Calibrators and Controls Stability Studies
Real-time stability studies were conducted on multiple lots of RapidFRET Oral Fluid
Calibrators and RapidFRET Oral Fluid Controls. The stability protocols for open and closed
vial were reviewed and found acceptable. The open vial and closed vial study results
support the open vial stability claim of 30 days and closed vial stability claim of 12 months
when stored at 2 to 8 ºC for the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Calibrators and RapidFRET Oral
Fluid Controls.
Sample Shipment - Stability Studies
A neat oral fluid pool was spiked with methamphetamine at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%,
125%, 150%, 175%, and 200% of the cutoff, corresponding to 0, 12.5, 25.0, 37.5, 50.0,
62.5, 75.0, 87.5, and 100 ng/mL. Each spike was subsequently processed through a
RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collection device to mimic actual collection process. Aliquots were
stored and handled according to the collector insert.
One set of samples (9 concentrations) was shipped under high relative humidity conditions
and a second set was shipped under low relative humidity conditions. Both sets were tested
by RapidFRET and confirmed by LC/MS/MS prior to shipment. The procedure was to ship
using an overnight commercial carrier from California to Maryland and back again to
6

--- Page 7 ---
California and this was done twice over five days.
The “high humidity” set of samples was shipped under relative humidity conditions of 39-
98% with a large majority of readings greater than 86.5% relative humidity. The
temperatures for this set ranged from 10-25°C.
The “low humidity” set of samples was shipped under relative humidity conditions of 0-
45% with a large majority of readings less than 15% relative humidity. The temperatures
for this set ranged from 10.5-26.5°C.
Samples were quantitatively assayed by MS at study start and at various time points over the
duration of the study. Methamphetamine recovery vs. day 1 at various time points over the
course of the study ranged from 98.0 – 108.6% at high relative humidity and from 90.1 –
107.5% at low relative humidity conditions. The physical integrity of the RapidEASE
sample tube was also evaluated following each shipment and no signs of degradation were
noted.
Sample Storage and Stability:
Conditions for oral fluid sample handling and storage were evaluated by preparing oral fluid
samples with Methamphetamine at concentrations of 0, 12.5, 25.0, 37.5, 50.0, 62.5, 75.0,
87.5, and 100.0 ng/mL (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, and 200% of the
cutoff). Samples were processed through RapidEASE oral fluid collection devices and
stored under various conditions including room temperature (21ºC to 28ºC) for 29 days,
refrigerated (3ºC to 7ºC) for 86 days, and frozen (-10ºC to -25ºC) for 231 days. Samples
were periodically sampled and analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry. For each storage
condition two sets of 9 levels each (18 total samples) were prepared and analyzed
individually. Individual percent recoveries ranged from 89.6% to 109.6% after 29 days
storage at room temperature, 88.8% to 110.4% after 86 days under refrigeration, and 88.8%
to 107.2% after frozen storage for 231 days.
The sponsor states the following in their regarding sample storage: Samples may be stored
at ambient temperatures for up to 7 days including shipping. Short term storage of samples
is recommended at 2 – 8 ºC for up to 30 days. Samples should be frozen at -10 ºC to -25 ºC
for long-term storage up to 7 months. All samples should be stored protected from light in
collection vial with cap securely tightened.
Sample Recovery Study
Recovery studies were conducted by aliquoting neat, human oral fluid pool into glass tubes
and spiking with methamphetamine to achieve concentrations ranging from 0% of cutoff (0
ng/mL) to 200% of cutoff (100 ng/mL) in 5 replicates for each level in 25% (12.5 ng/mL)
increments. Approximately half of the volume of each of these ‘PRE-RapidEASE’ samples
was then removed and processed through a new RapidEASE Oral Fluid collector,
mimicking as close as possible actual collection protocol, resulting in a ‘POST-RapidEASE’
sample. Both the PRE-RapidEASE and POST-RapidEASE for each spike level was
7

confirmed for methamphetamine concentration by Mass Spectrometry. Results are
summarized below:

e. Analytical specificity:
An analytical specificity study of the assay to evaluate the interference from non-structurally
and structurally related compounds was performed. The study design and results are
described below.
Non-Structurally Related Compounds
Potential interference from structurally unrelated drugs and metabolites were evaluated by
spiking these compounds at high concentrations into pooled negative oral fluid and in pooled
oral fluid spiked with methamphetamine at ± 50% of the cutoff (25 ng/mL and 75 ng/mL). No
interference was observed with the following structurally unrelated compounds when tested up
to a concentration of 30,000 ng/mL. 11-Hydroxy-Δ-9-THC, Δ-8-THC and O-
Desmethylvenlafaxine were tested up to a concentration of 3000 ng/mL; LSD was tested up to a
concentration of 1,500 ng/mL). Results are summarized below:

Potential Interferents and Common Substances
An interference study was performed to evaluate potential interference from endogenous
substances that may be present in the oral fluid samples. Aliquots of a neat oral fluid pool
were prepared and spiked with the potential interferent and with methamphetamine at
concentrations of 0 ng/mL and approximately 25 and 75 ng/mL (±50% of the cutoff).
Samples were then processed through a RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector per Instructions
and screened using the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Methamphetamine. All zero
concentration samples and at -50% of cutoff gave negative results, and all samples at +50%
of cutoff gave positive results. The potential interferents and concentrations tested are listed
below:

To evaluate potential interference from additional food and dental products, volunteers used
the indicated product according to common practice or product instructions, then provided
an oral fluid sample using the RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector. Each oral fluid sample was
then spiked with methamphetamine to approximately 25 and 75 ng/mL (±50% of the cutoff)
and analyzed. All samples at -50% of cutoff gave negative results, and all samples at +50%
of cutoff gave positive results. Results of the study are summarized below:

Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration of 50 ng/mL methamphetamine is described in the precision section, M.1.a.
above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Neat oral fluid was collected with the RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector from volunteers. A
total of 92 samples were randomized and blinded to the instrument operator and assayed
using the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Methamphetamine and LC/MS/MS reference
method. Samples are categorized in the Method Comparison table according to the sum of d
and l-methamphetamine concentration as measured by LC/MS/MS. The screening method
is calibrated to d-methamphetamine. The results from the method comparison study are
summarized in the table below:
