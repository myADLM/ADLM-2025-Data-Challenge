L. Test Principle:
The IDS 25-Hydroxy Vitamin Ds assay is an enzyme immunoassay for the quantitation of
25(OH) D and other hydroxylated metabolites in serum or plasma. All patient samples,
controls, and calibrators are run in duplicate and the mean results are reported in this assay
procedure. 25μL of each calibrators, controls and samples are diluted with biotin labelled
25(OH) D. The diluted samples are incubated in microtitre wells which are coated with a
highly specific sheep 25(OH) D at room temperature before aspiration and washing. Enzyme
(horseradish peroxidase) labelled avidin, is added and binds selectively to complexed biotin
and, following a further wash step, color is developed using a chromogenic substrate (TMB).
The absorbance of the stopped reaction mixtures are read in a microtitre plate reader, color
intensity developed being inversely proportional to the concentration of 25(OH) D.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated in accordance with a modified protocol based on CLSI EP5-A2,
Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods. Ten serum
samples including 3 QC samples (ranging from approximately 12 ng/mL to
approximately 80 ng/mL) were assayed using 3 lots of reagents in duplicate, twice per
day for a minimum of 20 days (n ≥ 80 replicates per sample). The within run, between
run, between day and total precision results are summarized in the table below using one
representative lot of reagent:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linear range of the assay was determined following a protocol based on the CLSI
guidance EP6-A, Evaluation of the linearity of quantitative measurement procedures: a
statistical approach. Samples were prepared by diluting a high serum sample with a
low serum sample to obtain eleven (11) concentration levels through the measuring
range. Samples were run in replicate of six, using one reagent lot with sample range
tested between 6.5 to 115 ng/mL. The observed concentrations of high and low
samples were used to calculate the expected concentrations of the 11 evenly spaced
dilution samples.
The resulting weighted linear regression equation of the observed concentrations versus
the expected concentrations is:
Y = 1.02x + 0.23 ng/mL, R2= 1.00
Maximum deviation from linearity; -8.8% for samples > 20 ng/mL and 2.37 ng/ml for
samples < 20 ng/mL

The results of the linearity study support the sponsor’s claim that the assay is linear from
6.5-100 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Standardization and Traceability:
The 25-Hydroxy Vitamin DS EIA assay is traceable to the isotope dilution-liquid
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (ID-LC-MS/MS) 25(OH)D Reference
Method Procedure (RMP) which is traceable to the National Institute of Standards and
Technology Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2972 in accordance with the Vitamin D
Standardization Program (VDSP). The VDSP is an international collaborative effort to
standardize the laboratory measurement of serum 25(OH) D. This collaboration
involves the coordinated efforts of the National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary
Supplements (ODS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the
National Institutes for Standards and Technology (NIST), Ghent University, and other
institutions. Please refer to http://ods.od.nih.gov/Research/VitaminD.aspx for more
information on the VDSP program.
The reference calibrators were initially value assigned by using the in-house internal
standards with multiple kit lots over multiple runs. These values were further
adjusted to align against the ID-LC-MS/MS by method comparison using a panel of
68 single donor samples from VDSP, over multiple runs with multiple kit lots.
The results summary below shows correlation of the final calibrator adjustment to the
original assigned calibrator values.
Deming regression (n =68):
y=1.02x- 0.36(ng/mL), r = 1.00
The 25-Hydroxy Vitamin DS EIA assay (candidate device) has passed the certification
process for the CDC VDSP and a certificate has been provided by the CDC. Please see
the certification process at http://www.cdc.gov/labstandards/hs.html.
Stability:
Shelf life stability: The sponsor performed an accelerated stability study on the
reagent kit. The accelerated stability study demonstrated an 8 month shelf life for the
microtitre plates when stored at 2-8º C. The stability study protocols and acceptance
criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. Current accelerated shelf life
studies support the assigned 8 month shelf-life, with real time studies ongoing.
Open Vial stability: Open vial stability study has been conducted and found adequate.
The stability data supports the sponsor’s claims that the kit components are stable for
8 weeks after opening when stored at 2-8oC.The stability study protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. All kit components,
except for the microtiter plates, have the same shelf life as stated below.

Value assignments:
For value assignment, a set of reference standards were value assigned and verified
from the CDC aligned reference standards. The kit calibrators were tested as
unknowns in a minimum of 10 assay runs using multiple operators. For each lot,
multiple replicates were assayed, the concentration of the kit calibrators were
calculated from the reference standards, and the mean result was used as the assigned
calibrator concentration.
Target values for Calibrators:
Calibrators Target value

For the two levels of QC, for each lot, 10 replicates were tested, mean and SD were
calculated and the QC range is +/- 2 SD from the calculated mean. The kit controls
have the following target range.

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) and Limit of Detection (LoD)
were determined based on guidance from CLSI EP17-A, Protocols for the
Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation.
Limit of Blank (LoB): 5 different lots of calibrator buffer were used as the blank to
determine the LoB, by running 60 replicates using 3 reagent lots. LoB was
calculated as: LoB = mean+ (1.645 x SD).
Limit of Detection (LoD): To determine the LoD, 10 samples with low concentrations
of 25-OH vitamin D were run in duplicate. LoD was calculated from a total of 6
assay runs tested over 4 days for a total of 118 results for each lot by using 3 lots of
reagent (355 samples in total). LoD= LoB+1.645 x pooled SD
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ): Human serum samples were diluted in calibrator buffer
to achieve low levels of 25-OH D in the sample. For calculation of LoQ, 10 different
low samples were run in duplicate, with 3 reagent lots, for a total of 120 results. The
sponsor determines LoQ based on functional sensitivity. LoQ is determined by the
concentration at which 20%CV was obtained (using the upper 95% confidence
interval).
Results of Detection Limit claims:
LoB LoD LoQ
1.3 ng/mL 2.7 ng/mL 4.8 ng/mL
The claimed measuring range of the assay is 6.5-100 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
To determine potential interference, two serum samples at two different concentrations of
25(OH) D from pooled serum spiked with the potential interferent. The mean of 26
replicate (except RF has 6 replicates), for both spiked and control samples, were then
compared. One reagent lot was used for interference testing. The study results
demonstrate that the following substances have non-significant interference in the 25-
Hydroxy Vitamin DS EIA assay when the concentrations presented in the following table

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed to compare the modified (standardized) 25-
Hydroxy Vitamin DS EIA assay (candidate device) to the non-standardized 25-Hydroxy
Vitamin D assay (predicate device), following CLSI EP-9A2 guideline. A total of 195
serum samples were tested on the candidate device and the predicate device. The
relationship between the candidate device (y) and the predicate device (x) is described by
using Passing Bablok regression, as shown below:

Passing Bablok regression:
y= 0.88 x + 3.23 ng/mL
95 % CI of the slope: 0.86 to 0.91
95 % CI of the intercept: 2.7 to 3.8 ng/mL
Pearson correlation coefficient, r: 0.97
Sample range tested: 8.1 ng/mL to 79.6 ng/mL
The slope showed an approximate bias of -12% between the candidate device and the
predicate device. Based on the raw data, there is a significant negative trend/bias with
results above the medical decision point (>30 ng/mL), but results below 30 ng/mL has a
positive trend/bias. However, this shift is expected because the purpose of the device
modification was to adjust the calibration to better align with the VDSP reference sample
concentration target levels. Therefore, test results from the candidate device do not, and
are not expected to, directly correlate with test results from the predicate device.
Laboratories that use the IDS 25-Hydroxy Vitamin Ds assay should be aware of the
significantly different performance of the modified assay.
An additional method comparison study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy between
the candidate device and the RMP, University of Ghent’s ID-LC/MS/MS method. The
method comparison against the RMP was the basis of the substantial equivalence
determination.
An additional method comparison study was performed to demonstrate the accuracy
of the newly aligned IDS- 25 Hydroxy Vitamin Ds assay. A total of 109 independent
native serum samples in the range of 7.3 to 93.4 ng/mL were used to compare the
Ghent/CDC ID-LC-MS/MS 25(OH) Vitamin D Reference Method Procedure and the
candidate device. Result of the method comparison is summarized below:
Deming Regression: y=0.97x-0.84 ng/mL
Slope, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.90 to 1.04
Intercept, 95%confidence Interval: -2.75 to 1.08 ng/mL
Correlation Coefficient, r=0.947
c. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed using sample sets with 25(OH) D
concentrations that ranged from 6.6 to 82.7 ng/mL. Some of the samples were spiked
in order to cover the high end of the claimed measuring range of the assay. Passing
Bablok regression was used to compare the results from the different tube types
against serum. The summary of the results are shown in the table below:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
A reference range study was performed according to the non-parametric method in CLSI
C28-A2 guideline. Samples from 280 apparently light skin and dark skin, healthy male
(71.1%) and female adults (28.9%), ages 21-77 years living in geographical diverse
regions of the United States to represent a broad spectrum of UV light exposure in the
intended population were assayed by the 25-Hydroxy Vitamin DS Assay. Samples were
from individuals with normal values for intact PTH, calcium, phosphate, and TSH, and
not taking any interfering medications.
The 95% reference interval was calculated and the following range was obtained:
95% Reference Range (2.5-97.5)
