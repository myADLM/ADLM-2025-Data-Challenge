L. Test Principle:
The Access 25(OH) Vitamin D Total assay is a two‐step competitive binding
immunoenzymatic assay. In the initial incubation, sample is added to a reaction vessel with a
vitamin D binding protein (DBP) releasing agent and paramagnetic particles coated with
sheep monoclonal anti‐25(OH) vitamin D antibody. 25(OH) vitamin D is released from DBP
and binds to the immobilized monoclonal anti‐25(OH) vitamin D on the solid phase.
Subsequently, a 25(OH) vitamin D analogue‐alkaline phosphatase conjugate is added which
competes for binding to the immobilized monoclonal anti‐25(OH) vitamin D. After a second
incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound
materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate Lumi‐Phos 530 is added to
the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light
production is inversely proportional to the concentration of 25(OH) vitamin D in the sample.
The amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a stored, multi‐point calibration
curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated according to the CLSI Document EP5-A2, Evaluation of
Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods. Four patient samples
with different concentrations were run in duplicates over 20 days (2 runs per day) for
a total of 40 runs and 80 replicates per sample. The study was run at an internal site
on three Unicel DxI 800 instruments, using three reagent pack lots, one calibrator lot
and one lot of reagent pack per instrument. The study results of representative reagent
lot are presented in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study was carried out according to the CLSI EP6-A, Evaluation of the
Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach;
Approved Guideline.
A linearity study was performed across the assay measuring range using a high and a
low sample. Additionally, seven evenly spaced dilutions were created by mixing the
high and low samples to cover the range of the assay of 7.0 ng/mL - 120 ng/mL. The
study was carried out on three UniCel DxI 800 instruments, with three reagent pack
lots and one calibrator lot. The low and high samples were run in replicates of eight
while the rest of the dilutions were run in replicates of four. The linearity study results
using one representative reagent lot with the polynomial regression equations are
summarized and presented in the table below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The calibrators are traceable to a Joint Committee for Traceability in Laboratory
Medicine (JCTLM) ‐ approved isotope dilution mass spectrometry (ID‐LC‐MS/MS)
reference method procedure (RMP) developed at Ghent University. This RMP is
further traceable to the NIST SRM 2972.
The traceability of Access 25(OH) Vitamin D Total Calibrators for the UniCel DxI
was verified using a panel of forty (40) serum samples from the Vitamin D
Standardization-Certification Program that were assigned by the ID-LC-MS/MS RMP
for Vitamin D from Ghent University (Termed VDSCP samples). The traceability
verification study was run on two UniCel Dxl 800 instruments using two reagent pack
lots and three calibrator lots. Each sample was tested in singleton on two instruments.
The correlation between the two methods was analyzed by fitting the observed
Access 25 (OH) Vitamin D into a linear regression model using a weighted Deming
method. The results of weighted Deming regression are presented below:
N Range (ng/mL) Slope Intercept R
40 9.0-79.2 0.97 -1.88 0.96
Calibrator value assignment:
Primary reference calibrators are prepared from 25(0H) Vitamin D and human serum.
A stock is prepared by volumetrically mixing the 25(0H) Vitamin D to a known
concentration based on the ID-LC-MS/MS reference method. The stock is diluted to
designated (assigned) concentrations using serum based matrix. Primary working
calibrators are prepared at six calibrator levels; zero, and approximately 6, 17, 37, 87
and 210 ng/mL.

Product (commercial) calibrators are value assigned using the Primary reference
calibrators on the Access 2 Immunoassay System through an internal procedure.
Verification of these assigned values is performed in a statistical comparison of
calibration curves generated by both the Primary reference and Product calibrators at
concentrations spanning the measuring interval. The product calibrators are prepared
at six levels; zero, and approximately 6, 17, 37, 87 and 210 ng/mL.
Calibrator stability:
The sponsor claims that the calibrators are stable until the expiration date when stored
unopened at -15 - 30°C. Once opened, the sponsor claims that the calibrators are
stable for 56 days when stored at 2 to 8°C.
The sponsor recommends use of commercially available controls to assess validity of
the 25(OH) Vitamin D assay in the labeling.
d. Detection limit:
LoB:
LoB was tested using a protocol based on CLSI EP17-A2, Protocols for
Determination of Limits of Detection and Limit of Quantitation; Approved Guideline.
A total of 156 replicates of a zero analyte sample (Access 25(OH) Vitamin D Total
Calibrator S0) were measured in 12 runs on three UniCel DxI 800 instruments, using
three reagent pack lots and two calibrator lots. This study determined the LoB for the
Access 25(OH) Vitamin D assay to be 0.98 ng/mL.
LoD:
LoD was tested using a protocol based on CLSI EP17-A2, Protocols for
Determination of Limits of Detection and Limit of Quantitation; Approved Guideline.
Three replicates from five low-level diluted patient samples were measured in 12 runs
on three UniCel DxI 800 instruments, using three reagent pack lots and two calibrator
lots. A total of 180 replicates were generated over 4 days. This study determined the
LoD for the Access 25(OH) Vitamin D assay to be 1.47 ng/mL.
LoQ:
LoQ was tested using a protocol based on CLSI EP17-A2, Protocols for
Determination of Limits of Detection and Limit of Quantitation; Approved Guideline.
Three replicates of 3 naïve and 7 diluted patient samples (sample range from 1.0 to 16
ng/mL) were measured on three UniCel DxI 800 instruments, using three reagent
pack lots and one calibrator lot in 22 runs. The mean concentration and total percent
coefficient of variation (%CV) were calculated for each sample on each day for
multiple days. LoQ was determined as the lowest concentration with a total
imprecision ≤ 20% CV obtained using 3 different lots of reagent. This study
determined the LoQ for the Access 25(OH) Vitamin D assay to be 4.4 ng/mL with a ≤
20% CV.

--- Page 9 ---
The LoB, LoD and LoQ are summarized below:
LoB LoD LoQ
0.98 ng/mL 1.47 ng/mL 4.4 ng/mL
The measuring range of the Beckman Access 25(OH) Vitamin D Total assay is 7 –
120 ng/mL. The sponsor’s claimed LoQ of the assay is 7 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
The sponsor performed studies to evaluate the effects of potential interferents on the
performance of the ADVIA Centaur Vitamin D Total assay, following CLSI EP7-A2,
Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline. Testing was done in
the presence of 20, 40 and 150 ng/mL 25(OH) vitamin D and different concentrations
of the listed compounds. Eight replicates were tested for each control and spiked
sample preparation at ~20 ng/mL and five replicates were tested for each control and
spiked sample preparation at ~40 and ~150 ng/mL. Percent recovery was calculated
relative to control samples containing vitamin D without spiked endogenous
compounds. The table below lists all substances tested at concentrations with non-
significant (<10%) interference defined by the sponsor when compared to the control
samples:

The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling:
“Vitamin D Levels should not be tested in patients who have received Paricalcitol
within 24 hours of obtaining the sample”
Patients who have been regularly exposed to animals or have received
immunotherapy or diagnostic procedures utilizing immunoglobulins or
immunoglobulin fragments may produce antibodies, e.g. HAMA, that interfere with
immunoassays. Additionally, other heterophile antibodies (e.g. human anti-sheep
antibodies) may be present in patient samples. Such interfering antibodies may cause
erroneous results. Carefully evaluate the results of patients suspected of having these
antibodies.
The limitations section states that heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react
with reagent immunoglobulins or other reagent material, interfering with in vitro
immunoassays.
The specimen collection section states: “Do not assay hemolyzed samples.
Hemoglobin concentrations greater than 50 mg/dL may lead to falsely elevated
results.”
Cross-reactivity:
The sponsor performed studies to estimate if compounds similar to 25-hydroxy
Vitamin D (25(OH) D2 and D3) cross react with the Access 25(OH) Vitamin D Total
assay. These studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP7-A2, Interference
Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline. Specificity of the Access 25(OH)
Vitamin D Total assay was determined by adding the cross reactants to the vitamin D
samples with an approximate concentration of 20, 40, and 100 ng/mL. Each test
sample was compared to a matched unspiked sample. Five replicates of each spiked
and unspiked sample were tested on one UniCel DxI 800 instrument, using one
reagent pack lot and one calibrator lot. Values for percent cross-reactivity were
calculated using the equation below.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed according to CLSI EP9-A3 to compare
the performance of the Access 25(0H) Vitamin D Total Assay on the UniCel Dxl
Immunoassay System with that of the 25(0H) Vitamin DID LC-MS/MS Reference
Measurement Procedure (RMP) from Ghent University (Ghent RMP). One hundred
and ten native independent patient samples value assigned by Ghent RMP were tested
in duplicates and the singlet set of results was used to compare against the candidate
method. The linear regression was calculated using the Passing-Bablok method and
the method comparison study results are summarized below:
N Intercept (ng/mL) Slope (ng/mL) R Sample range tested
(95% CI ) (95% CI)
109 -3.96 1.03 0.94 7.1 to 120 ng/mL
(-5.48 to -1.04) (0.91 to 1.07)
b. Matrix comparison:
A sample type comparison study was performed on the Access 25(OH) Vitamin D
Total assay using 45 matched sets of serum and plasma (lithium-heparin) samples.
The samples (40 neat and 5 spiked) spanned the reportable range of the assay (12.0 to
102.4 ng/mL) were tested on one UniCel DxI 800 instrument using one reagent pack
lot and one calibrator lot. One singlet set of data was used for the data analysis.
Following CLSI recommendations in EP9-A2, Method Comparison and Bias
Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline, 2nd Edition, Passing Bablok
analysis was used to evaluate the sample type comparison. The study linear
regression analyses are summarized in the table below:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
A reference range study was conducted using serum samples from 367 apparently healthy
adults between 21-89 years of age. The study population included male and female
subjects from various geographically diverse regions of the US and reflected the overall
US population in terms of gender, race and ethnicity. The samples were collected during
the cold and warm weather. All subjects self-reported their health status. Normal levels
of serum calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, PTH and TSH were confirmed following
enrollment. Twenty percent of the subjects that participate in this study took vitamin D
supplements. The observed range of 25(OH) Vitamin D concentrations is summarized in
the table below:
95% Reference Interval
N Median
2.5th Percentile 97.5th Percentile
