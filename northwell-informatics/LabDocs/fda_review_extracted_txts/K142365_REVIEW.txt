510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
K142365
B. Purpose for Submission:
The Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct, originally cleared under k120413, was modified to
improve detection of newer circulating influenza strains while maintaining sensitivity for
detection of previous influenza strains. The labeling was updated to include analytical
reactivity data for the following additional six (6) strains of influenza A and two (2) strains
of influenza B: influenza A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N7) , influenza A/California/12/2012 (H1N1)
pdm09, influenza A/Indiana/08/2011 (H3N2)v, influenza A/Minnesota/11/2010 (H3N2)v,
influenza A/Ohio/02/2012 (H3N2), influenza A/Texas/50/2012(H3N2), influenza
B/Brisbane/60/2008, and influenza B/Wisconsin/01/2010.
C. Measurand:
The Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct detects target RNA sequences for the highly
conserved regions of the matrix protein genes of influenza A and influenza B viruses, and the
M gene of RSV.
D. Type of Test:
This is a qualitative Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
assay used with the 3M Integrated Cycler instrument for the in vitro qualitative detection and
differentiation of influenza A virus, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) from symptomatic patients. The assay measures viral
RNA directly from un-extracted nasopharyngeal swab specimens. An on-board pre-heating
step opens the viral coat releasing the viral RNA. A bi-functional fluorescent probe-primer is
used together with a reverse primer to amplify a specific target for each analyte and the RNA
internal control. Amplification and detection is performed on the 3M Integrated Cycler with
Integrated Cycler Studio Software version 4.2 or higher.

1. Intended use(s):
Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct (REF MOL2650)
The Focus Diagnostics SimplexaTM Flu A/B & RSV Direct assay is intended for use on
the 3M Integrated Cycler instrument for the in vitro qualitative detection and
differentiation of influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV) RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) from human patients with signs and
symptoms of respiratory tract infection in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological
risk factors. This test is intended for use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of
influenza A, influenza B, and RSV viral infections in humans and is not intended to
detect influenza C.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus or RSV infection and should not be used
as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established with clinical specimens
collected during the 2010/2011 influenza season when 2009 H1N1 influenza and H3N2
were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses
are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
influenza viruses and sent to the state or local health department for testing. Viral culture

The Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct (K120413) was modified to improve the detection of
newer, evolving strains of influenza viruses. The changes were made in two phases. The first
phase of the modifications (Gen 2.0) included changes to the reaction mix formulation and
cycling conditions: (a) change in the annealing temperature (decreased), (b) change in the run
time (increased), (c) change in the enzyme used, and (d) change to the RSV cut-off Ct
(decreased). Limited changes (Gen. 2.1) were also made to the manufacturing process and
materials to increase the stability of the reaction mix and to minimize non-specific products.

L. Test Principle:
The Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV is a real-time RT-PCR amplification and detection system
that utilizes a bi-functional fluorescent probe-primer for the detection and differentiation of
human influenza A virus RNA, human influenza B virus RNA and respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV) RNA directly from unextracted nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens. An on-board
pre-heating step opens the viral coat releasing the viral RNA. A bi-functional fluorescent
probe-primer is used together with a reverse primer to amplify a specific target (for each
analyte and the RNA internal control). A fluorescent signal is generated as a result of the
binding of a probe element to the extended DNA fragment synthesized during the
amplification. The 3M Integrated Cycler is a thermocycler capable of heating, cooling,
mixing of sample and reagents, amplification, and real-time detection of fluorescence. There
are four optical channels allowing for detection of up to four targets simultaneously. The
table below shows the excitation and emission wavelengths for each of the standard channels
provided as part of the Integrated Cycler instrument.

Direct Gen 2.1 using three reaction mix lots. The sample panel used for testing consisted
of one low positive each for influenza A, influenza B, and RSV, one medium positive
each for influenza A, influenza B, and RSV, one negative and one positive control for a
total of 8 samples in the panel. Low positive samples were created by spiking influenza
A, influenza B, or RSV organisms into negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix at 1.5 times
LoD. Medium positive samples were created by spiking influenza A, influenza B, or RSV
organisms into negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix at 4 times LoD. Pooled negative
nasopharyngeal swab matrix was used as the negative samples. Each sample panel
member was tested in duplicate per reaction mix lot in each run, two runs per day for
total of three days. The study was performed using a total of four Integrated Cyclers, each
operated by a different operator. One lot of Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct Positive
Control Pack was used throughout testing. The Negative Template Control (NTC) and
Positive Control were tested on each instrument once each day as a control set. The table

d. Detection limit:
Three strains of influenza A, two strains of influenza B and two strains of RSV were
tested to determine the limit of detection (LoD) for the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV
Direct Gen 2.1 assay kit. Serial dilutions of quantified virus stocks spiked into negative
nasopharyngeal swab matrix were prepared. Four concentrations per virus were tested in
triplicate during the screening phase to determine the tentative LoD for each target virus.
The lowest concentration with all three replicates of the target virus detected during the
screening phase was tested in thirty two (32) replicates to confirm the reliable detection at
that concentration. The LoD is determined to be the concentration at which at least 31/32
(≥95.0%) replicates are detected. The comparison of the limit of detection of the
Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV between the original device (Gen 1.0) and the modified device
(Gen 2.1) is shown below.

were used to perform 15 experimental runs across two days by a single operator. One lot
of reaction mix and one lot of positive control were used to conduct the study. Each
organism was spiked into negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix and tested in triplicate. A
total of five replicates of baseline negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix were tested. One
set of controls, a Negative Template Control (NTC) and a Positive Control, was tested on
each instrument on each day of testing. No cross-reactivity was observed with the
organisms tested, as shown below.

Interference
Ten relevant potentially interfering substances were tested to evaluate their effect on the
performance of the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen 2.1 Kit. One baseline sample
was prepared containing all three target viruses (influenza A, influenza B, and RSV) at
the level of 3 times the determined LoD of each virus. Each of the potential interferents
was spiked into a baseline sample and tested in triplicate. All dilutions were prepared in
negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix. The virus strains and the concentrations used in
the sample preparation are shown below.

f. Analytical reactivity
A total of 34 viruses (19 strains of influenza A (including H1, H3 and H5 subtypes), 11
strains of influenza B and 4 strains of RSV) were tested to evaluate analytical reactivity
of the modified (Gen. 2.1) Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct assay. The most recent
strains and geographically diverse strains were chosen. A total of three 3M Integrated
Cyclers were used to perform 19 experimental runs over four days by a single operator.
One lot of reaction mix and one lot of Positive Control were used to conduct the study.
Each organism was spiked into negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix and tested at least
in triplicate. Total of five replicates of the baseline negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix
were tested. One set of controls (NTC and Positive Control) was tested on each
instrument on each day of testing. With the exception of the influenza A/Ohio/02/2012
(H3N2), all of the analytical reactivity panel viruses were detected with the modified
device at the same concentrations as they were with the original device. The influenza
A/Ohio/02/2012 (H3N2) was detected at 200 CEID /mL by the modified device while
50
the original device (Gen 1.0) detected the same strain at 100 CEID . The newly tested
50
influenza A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus was detected at 25,000 EID /mL.

NOTE: Although this test has been shown to detect novel avian influenza A (H7N9) and
H3N2v cultured viruses, the performance characteristics of this device with clinical
specimens that are positive for novel avian influenza A (H7N9) and H3N2v influenza
viruses have not been established.
g. Assay cut-off:
Refer to k120413 for additional performance studies.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The modified device was validated with clinical samples in each of the two phases of the
changes, Gen 2.0 and Gen 2.1.
1. Comparison between Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen 1.0 and Simplexa™
Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen 2.0
The changes implemented for Gen 2.0 were evaluated with archived clinical samples.
Based on historical data, 265 samples in Universal Transport Medium (UTM) or
Viral Transport Medium (VTM) were assembled with 55 samples positive for
influenza A, 55 samples positive for influenza B, 55 samples positive for RSV and
100 samples negative for all of the viruses tested. The 265 samples tested included
131 archived clinical samples originally tested in the clinical study conducted in
support of the 510(k) submission (K120413). The other 134 samples included 33
archived samples from the 2010-2011 flu season and 101 samples from the 2013-
2014 flu season. The samples were tested in parallel using the Simplexa™ Flu
A/B&RSV Gen 1.0 kit and the Simplexa™ Flu A/B&RSV Gen 2.0 kit. The positive
percent agreement (PPA) and the negative percent agreement (NPA) between the
results obtained with the Simplexa™ Gen 1.0 and the Simplexa™ Gen 2.0, for each
virus, are shown below:
