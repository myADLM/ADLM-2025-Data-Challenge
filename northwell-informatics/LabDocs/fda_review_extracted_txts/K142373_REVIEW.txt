L. Test Principle:
The Access 25(OH) Vitamin D total assay is a two-step competitive binding
immunoenzymatic assay. In the initial incubation, sample is added to a reaction vessel with a
DBP releasing agent and paramagnetic particles coated with sheep monoclonal anti-25(OH)
vitamin D antibody. 25(OH) vitamin D is released from DBP and binds to the immobilized
monoclonal anti-25(OH) vitamin D on the solid phase. Subsequently a 25 (OH) vitamin D
analogue-alkaline phosphatase conjugate is added which competes for binding to the
immobilized monoclonal anti-25(OH) vitamin D. After a second incubation, materials bound
to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away.
Then, the chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phos 530 is added to the vessel and light
generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is inversely

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A twenty day reproducibility/precision study based on CLSI EP5-A2 was performed
at an internal site using three Access 2 analyzers and 3 reagent lots. Four patient
serum samples with different concentrations were run in duplicates over 20 days (2
runs per day) for a total of 40 runs and 80 replicates per sample. The study was run at
an internal site on three Access 2 instruments, using three reagent pack lots, one
calibrator lot and one lot of reagent pack per instrument. The study results of one
representative reagent lot are provided in the table below:
Sample Mean (n=80) Within-run Between-run Total

Sample 4 110.5 1.6 1.5 7.3 6.6 7.5 6.8
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was conducted based on CLSI EP6-A. A high human serum based
sample and a low human serum based sample were analyzed in addition to 7 evenly
spaced dilutions which were created by mixing the high and low sample to cover the
range of the assay (7.0-120 ng/mL). Each diluted sample was analyzed in replicates
of 4 and the low and high samples were analyzed in replicates of eight using three
Access 2 analyzers, three reagent pack lots and one calibrator lot. The linearity study
results using one representative reagent lot with the polynomial regression equations
are summarized and presented in the table below:

Program (VDSP). The VDSP is an international collaborative effort to standardize the
laboratory measurement of serum 25-OH vitamin D. This collaboration involves the
coordinated efforts of the National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary
Supplements (ODS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the
National Institutes for Standards and Technology (NIST), Ghent University, and other
institutions. Please refer to http://ods.od.nih.gov/Research/VitaminD.aspx for more
information on the VDSP program.
In accordance with the recommendations of the program, the traceability of Access
25 (OH) Vitamin D Total Calibrators for the Access 2 analyzer was verified using a
panel of forty serum samples from the Vitamin D Standardization-Certification
Program that were assigned by the ID-LC-MS/MS RMP for Vitamin D from Ghent
University. Standardization of total 25OHD in serum was verified through method
comparison and bias estimation between the reference method and the Access
25(OH) Vitamin D Total assay. This value assignment has aligned the candidate
device to the RMP.
The relationship between the Access 25 (OH) Vitamin D Total for use on the Access
2 analyzer and ID-LC/MS/MS 25-OH vitamin D RMP is described using Deming
regression:
y=1.01x-2.87 ng/mL, r=0.99
Value Assignment:
Primary reference calibrators are prepared from 25(OH) Vitamin D and human
serum. A stock is prepared by volumetrically mixing the 25(OH) Vitamin D to a
known concentration based on the ID-LC-MS/MS reference method. The stock is
diluted to designated (assigned) concentrations using a serum based matrix. Primary
working calibrators are prepared at six calibrator levels; zero, and approximately 7,
18, 35, 74 and 167 ng/mL.
Product (commercial) calibrators are value assigned using the Primary reference
calibrators on the Access 2 Immunoassay System through an internal procedure.
Verification of these assigned values is performed in a statistical comparison of
calibration curves generated by both the Primary reference and Product calibrators at
concentrations spanning the measuring interval.
Stability:
The sponsor claims the calibrators are stable until the expiration date indicated when
stored unopened at -15-30°C. Once opened, the sponsor claims the calibrators are
stable for 56 days when stored at 2-8°C. The sponsor recommends the use of
commercially available controls for use with this assay in the labeling.

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and the limit of Quantitation
(LoQ) were determined following CLSI EP17-A2 guidelines.
The LoB was determined as the 95% non-parametric upper distribution limit of the
result concentration. LoB was performed by analyzing 154 replicates of the S0
calibrator over 12 runs using three Access 2 Immunoassay Systems, three reagent lots
and two calibrator lots.
The LoD determination was performed by analyzing 5 very low Vitamin D
concentration serum samples between the anticipated LoB and 10 times the
anticipated LoB in triplicate over 12 runs (180 replicates in total) using 3 reagent
packs and three Access 2 Immunoassay Systems over 4 days.
The LoQ determination was performed by analyzing 3 replicates of 10 patient
samples within 22 runs using multiple Access 2 Immunoassay Systems over multiple
days. LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration which met the design
requirements of total imprecision of ≤ 20%CV.
The LoB, LoD and LoQ are summarized below:
LoB LoD LoQ
0.55 ng/mL 1.0 ng/mL 3.0 ng/mL
The Access 25 (OH) Vitamin D assay has a measuring range of 7.0-120 ng/mL
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was conducted per CLSI EP7-A2. Serum samples containing
Vitamin D concentrations of approximately 20, 40 and 100 ng/ml were used in the
study. Potential interferents were spiked individually into each patient sample in up
to four different concentrations. Results of the spiked patient samples were compared
to results of the unspiked sample (control). Samples at Vitamin D concentration of
~30 ng/mL were tested in replicates of 8 and samples at ~40 and ~150 ng/mL were
tested in replicates of five. The highest concentration at which no interference
(defined by the sponsor as ≤10% bias relative to the control) was seen is shown in the
table below.

A cross-reactivity study was conducted according to CLSI-EP7-A2 to evaluate the
potential cross-reactivity of the assay with other substances that are similar in
structure to 25(OH) Vitamin D. The potential cross-reactants were added to the
Vitamin D samples with an approximate 25(OH) vitamin D concentration of 20, 40
and 100 ng/mL. Results from these cross-reactant spiked serum samples were
evaluated against that of matched unspiked serum samples. Samples at 20 ng/ml were
tested in replicates of eight. Samples at 40 and 100 ng/mL were tested in replicates of
five. The substances shown in the following table were spiked into samples
containing 25(OH) vitamin D and analyzed on the Access 2 Immunoassay system.
Values for percent were calculated using the equation below.

The labeling contains the following limitations:
“Do not assay hemolyzed samples. Hemoglobin concentrations greater than 50 mg/dL
may lead to falsely elevated results.
“Vitamin D Levels should not be tested in patients who have received Paricalcitol
within 24 hours of obtaining the sample”
Patients who have been regularly exposed to animals or have received
immunotherapy or diagnostic procedures utilizing immunoglobulins or
immunoglobulin fragments may produce antibodies, e.g. HAMA, that interfere with
immunoassays. Additionally, other heterophile antibodies (e.g. human anti-sheep
antibodies) may be present in patient samples. Such interfering antibodies may cause
erroneous results. Carefully evaluate the results of patients suspected of having these
antibodies.

Not Applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed according to CLSI EP9-A3 to compare
the 25-OH vitamin D concentrations of serum samples using the candidate device on
the Access 2 analyzer and the University of Ghent ID-LC/MS/MS 25-OH vitamin D

Reference Measurement Procedure (RMP). 109 native independent patient samples
with RMP assigned concentrations were tested in duplicates and the singlet set of
results was used to compare against the candidate method. The linear regression was
calculated using the first result obtained and the Passing-Bablok method. The results
are summarized below:
N Intercept Slope (ng/mL) Correlation Sample range
(ng/mL) [95% CI] Coefficient tested
[95%CI]
109 -3.57 1.02 0.95 8 . 0 -109.4 ng/mL
[-6.15 to- 1.30 ] [0.95-1.12] [0.92 to 0.96]
b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was conducted using 45 matched sets of serum and
plasma (lithium-heparin) samples which spanned the reportable range of the assay
(8.3 to 87.9 ng/mL). The samples (40 neat and 5 spiked) were analyzed on the Access
2 analyzer. The results of the study using Passing Bablok analysis are as follows:
Sample Type n Intercept Slope 95% CI R
Serum (no gel) 45 0.97 1.01 0.96-1.06 0.99
vs. Serum (gel)
Serum (no gel) 45 -0.02 1.05 1.02-1.10 0.99
vs. Lithium
Heparin
Based on the study data, the sponsor claims that serum, serum with gel and lithium
heparin (plasma) tubes are acceptable anti-coagulants for the vitamin D assay.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
A reference range study was conducted using serum samples from 367 apparently
healthy adults between 21-89 years of age. The study population included male and
female subjects from various geographically diverse regions of the US and reflected the
overall US population in terms of gender, race and ethnicity. These samples were
collected during the cold and warm weather. Samples included subjects with Vitamin D
supplements (20% of the participants) and without Vitamin D supplements. Samples
were only included in this study if the samples had normal Calcium, Magnesium,
Phosphorus, PTH and TSH values. The results of the study are as follows:
Method N Median 95% Reference Range (2.5-97.5)
Concentration Percentile
Access 25(OH) 367 24.9 ng/mL 11.9 ng/mL to 43.6 ng/mL
Vitamin D Total
(ng/mL)
The sponsor stated in their labeling that it is important for each laboratory to establish its
own reference range, representative of its typical population.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
substantial equivalence decision.
