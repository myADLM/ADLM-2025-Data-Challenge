L. Test Principle:
The Mission U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer is a reflectance photometer that analyzes the
intensity and color of light reflected from the reagent areas of a urinalysis reagent strip.
Using a light emitting diode (LED) as the light source and a CMOS image sensor as a light
sensor, the optical system reads the color change in the urine test strips after a sample is
applied.
The albumin test is based on affinity binding of albumin to a sulfonephthalein dye at a
constant pH. The development of pale green to aqua blue indicates the presence of albumin.
The creatinine test is based on the peroxidase-like activity of a copper creatinine complex
that catalyzes the reaction of diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide and 3,3',5,5'-

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To evaluate between-run precision, 3 levels of albumin and creatinine in contrived
urine samples were tested at 3 external sites with three lots of strips on the Mission
U120 Ultra urine analyzer. Testing was performed by three operators at each site
typically found at these settings on blind labeled samples, with each operator
performing the test for 6-7 days. Each sample was assayed for 20 days with 2 runs
per day. For within-run precision, 3 levels of albumin and creatinine were run for 1
day with 20 replicates per sample. Results for each of the 3 POC sites are
summarized:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and Value Assignment: The control solutions were prepared in house by
adding a commercially available stock of albumin and creatinine in buffered
solutions. The controls are traceable to internal standards. The values for the internal
standards for creatinine are assigned through an internal procedure. The target values
are:
Control Level 1: Albumin 10-30 mg/L; Creatinine 10-100 mg/dL
Control Level 2: Albumin 80-150 mg/L; Creatinine 100-300 mg/dL
Calibration: The Mission U500 performs a “self-test” and calibration each time it is
turned on. Each time a test is run the analyzer re-calibrates using a white plastic

Shelf life stability and open vial protocols for the controls were reviewed and found
acceptable. The sponsor claims that the controls are stable for 24 months when stored
at 2°C to 8°C in closed package, opened package for 30 days at 15ºC to 30ºC
Shelf-life and open-vial stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
found to be adequate for Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips (Microalbumin/
Creatinine). The stability studies support the following manufacturer’s claim: The
strip can be stored at 2ºC to 8ºC in closed package to 24 months, opened package for
30 days at 15ºC to 30ºC.
d. Detection limit:
The sensitivity of the assay was evaluated at each color block of albumin (10, 30, 80,
150 mg/L) and creatinine (10, 50, 100, 200, 300 mg/dL). Urine samples were spiked
or diluted to known concentrations for each analyte with a minimum of 4 levels
across the measuring range of each color block. Each sample was tested by three
operators with 3 lots of strips for 3 days generating 81 datapoints for each level. The
cutoff for each block is defined as the lowest concentration at which >50% of the
results are positive for each color block.
The cut-off values for each color block of albumin and creatinine are summarized
below:
Analyte Color Block Cut-off Concentration % Positive results
10 mg/L 0 mg/L 100%
30 mg/L 20 mg/L 72.8%

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed to evaluate the effects of potential interferents
commonly found in urine on the performance of Mission Urinalysis Reagent strips,
following CLSI EP7-A2. Testing was done with contrived urine samples at 3 levels
of albumin (10, 30, 150 mg/L) and creatinine (10, 100, 300 mg/dL) and at least two
levels of the listed compounds with 3 lots of strips. Interference was defined as a
change in output of ≥±1 color blocks between spiked and unspiked control sample.

The sponsor states the following in the labeling regarding potentially interfering
substances:
The Urinalysis Reagent Strips (Urine) may be affected by substances that cause
abnormal urine color such as drugs containing azo dyes (e.g. Pyridium, Azo
Gantrisin, Azo Gantanol), nitrofurantoin (Microdantin, Furadantin), and riboflavin.
Urine specimen contaminated with soaps, detergents, antiseptics, or skin cleansers
may also affect test results.
For albumin, a pH ≥10.0 or a specific gravity of 1.000 will affect albumin test results.
Whereas, a specific gravity ≥1.035 will generate falsely elevated results for
creatinine.
Specific Gravity and pH studies:
5 fresh urine samples were pooled and separated into 9 aliquots. The specific gravity
of the aliquots was adjusted with purified water and sodium chloride to 1.000, 1.005,
1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025, 1.030, 1.035 and 1.040 respectively. The adjusted
samples were spiked or diluted to achieve the desired albumin (10, 80, and 150 mg/L)
and creatinine (10, 100, 300 mg/dL) concentrations. For albumin, urine specific
gravity range of 1.010 to 1.035 does not affect the results of the albumin test, but
specific gravity at 1.000 will generate false low result on albumin test. For creatinine,
specific gravity from 1.000 to 1.030 will not affect the results; however specific
gravity higher than or equal to 1.035 will generate false high results of creatinine test.
5 fresh urine samples were pooled and separated into 7 aliquots. The pH of the
aliquots was adjusted to a range of 4.00 to 10.00 in 1 pH unit increments and were
spiked or diluted with albumin and creatinine respectively. Samples were tested
using three lots of each format of the devices, and results showed that urine pH range
of 4.00 to 9.00 does not affect the results of the albumin test but samples at pH 10.0
would generate false high results. Urine sample pH from 4 to 10 did not affect the
creatinine test results.
Humidity studies:
Testing was done with contrived urine samples at 3 levels of albumin (10, 30, 150
mg/L) and creatinine (10, 50, 300 mg/dL). 50 strips were placed in relative humidity
of <20%, 30-50%, 60-70%, and 85% environments at 15º C and 45° C, and stored in

these conditions for 0.5hr, 1hr, 2hr, 4hr, 8hr, 16hr, and 24hr. 5 replicates were tested
for each level. The strips were stable up to 50% humidity for over 24hrs, at humidity
conditions above 60%, the strip was stable for 1 hr.
Timing Flex Study:
The effect of different dipping times and strip wetting times on strip test results were
assessed. Results of the timing flex studies demonstrated that the dipping time or
strip wetting time had no interfering effect on the color development.
Sample Carryover Studies:
To assess the interference from sample carried over from one pad to the adjacent pad,
pooled urine samples with adjusted levels of albumin (10, 30, 150 mg/L) and
creatinine (10, 50, 300 mg/dL) were tested. The strip was dipped into a urine sample,
and then upon removal, held vertically to allow the sample to move from the albumin
pad to the creatinine pad. The same process was repeated for the creatinine pad. 5
replicates were tested for each level. The results indicated that sample carryover from
adjacent pads do not interfere with the results.
f. Assay cut-off:
See detection limits above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
At least 120 native samples were tested at each of 3 point-of-care settings by three
operators per site. Urine specimens were randomly collected from patients.
Additionally, 18 contrived samples (12-13%) were generated to cover the measuring
range. Each specimen was tested by ACON U120 Ultra Urine Analyzers with one
ACON Urinalysis Microalbumin/ Creatinine Reagent strip and by Clinitek Status
Analyzer with Clinitek Microalbumin 2 reagent strip in duplicates. The results are
presented in the tables below:

The agreement of A:C ratios of positives and negatives at cutoff of <30 mg/g were
94.89% and 5.11%, respectively. Of the 217 A:C predicate positive results, 7.37%
(16/217) were Mission Strip negative. Of the 196 assay A:C ratio predicate negative
results, 5.11% (10/196) were positive. In summary, the overall exact agreement between
Mission Urinalysis Strips (Microalbumin/Creatinine) and Clinitek Microalbumin 2
Reagents strips for positive albumin results is 90.67%, and the overall agreement for ±1
block is 100%.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected values are included in the labeling and are taken from literature references.
Normally, albumin is present in urine at concentrations < 20 mg/L1. Results of 20-200
mg/L may indicate microalbuminuria. It is associated with early-stage kidney disease
when a small amount of Albumin, also called Microalbumin is consistently present in
urine. Clinical albuminuria is indicated by results of >200 mg/L. These levels can be
predictive of albumin excretion rates of 30-300 mg/24hours and >300 mg/24hours,
respectively2-3. Exercise, acute illness and fever, and urinary tract infections may
temporarily elevate urinary albumin excretions. Creatinine concentrations of 10-300
mg/dL are normally present in urine.
Albumin is normally present in urine at concentrations of <30 mg albumin/g creatinine.
Microalbuminuria is indicated at a ratio result of 30-300 mg/g (Abnormal) and clinical
albuminuria at a ratio of >300 mg/g (High Abnormal)4.

N. Instrument Name:
Mission U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Semi-automatic reading of Mission Urinalysis Microalbumin/Creatinine Reagent strip on
Mission U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer. Each reagent strip is single use and must be
replaced with a new strip for additional readings. The labeling and user guide specify
that the strips are for single use.

or mobile device?
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ____X____ or No ________
2. Software:

this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
An external bar code reader, or manual entry of sample numbers are used for sample
identification. Mission U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer can be interfaced with a laboratory
information system for data management via serial port or USB port.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Mission U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer can only accept one test strip at a time. Test strips
are dipped in urine, and read on the analyzer. The analyzer also stores up to 2000 patient
results which can be recalled by the operator using the Records Review Function.
5. Calibration:
The instrument performs a “self-test” and calibration each time it is turned on. Each time

--- Page 18 ---
a test is run the analyzer re-calibrates using a white plastic calibration bar located at the
bottom of the analyzer optical system.
6. Quality Control:
Each canister of strips contains a code that includes information such as brand, type of
strip, strips per canister, expiration date. This code is entered into the U120 Ultra Urine
analyzer either manually or by a barcode reader prior to testing. An error code is
generated if this is not done.
The instrument includes a quality control function (QC), and a lock out function. When
the QC function is enabled, the instrument will ask for control testing during the system
initialization prior to the routine testing run.
