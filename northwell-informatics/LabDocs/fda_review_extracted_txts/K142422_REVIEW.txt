I. Device Description:
The Roche Molecular Systems (RMS) cobas Cdiff Test utilizes real-time polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) for the detection of toxigenic Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) DNA from
unformed (liquid or soft) stool specimens to aid in the diagnosis of C. difficile infections in
humans.
The cobas Cdiff Test contains two major processes: (1) automated sample preparation to
extract nucleic acids from the unformed stool specimens; (2) PCR amplification of target
DNA sequences using C. difficile specific primers and real-time detection of cleaved
fluorescent-labeled C. difficile specific oligonucleotide detection probes. An Internal Control
(IC), containing unrelated randomized DNA sequence, is added to all samples prior to
automated sample preparation and is amplified and detected simultaneously with each
sample to monitor the entire process.

L. Test Principle:
Sample preparation for the cobas Cdiff Test is automated with the use of the cobas x480
instrument. Unformed stool specimens are transferred into cobas PCR Media by using a
swab. Organisms are lysed with chaotropic agent, proteinase K, and SDS reagents. Released
nucleic acids, along with added Internal Control DNA, are bound by magnetic glass particles.
They are washed and then eluted into a small volume of buffer. The instrument then takes an
aliquot of the eluted material and sets up the PCR reaction with an activated Master Mix.
The PCR cycling steps and detection of target signal occurs in the cobas z480 Analyzer. The
Master Mix reagent contains primer pairs and probes for two targets: C. difficile toxin B gene
and Internal Control. If the target nucleic acid sequences are present, amplification with the
corresponding primers will occur by a thermostable DNA polymerase, generating PCR
products (amplicons). These products are detected by specific TaqMan probes containing a
fluorescent dye and a quencher. If the PCR product is present, the probe hybridizes to the
product and gets cleaved by the 5’ to 3’ nuclease activity of the polymerase. This reaction
allows the fluorescence to be emitted from the dye, and the signal is recorded in real time
during each PCR cycle by the cobas z480 analyzer. The signal is interpreted by the cobas
4800 System Software and reported as final results.
The cobas 4800 System uses the cobas x480 Instrument for sample preparation, and the
cobas z480 Analyzer for amplification and detection. Both the cobas x480 Instrument and the
cobas z480 Analyzer are controlled by a computer workstation running the cobas 4800
System Software.

cultures diluted into negative stool matrix in cobas PCR Media to concentration levels
below Limit of Detection (LOD), near LOD and above LOD of the cobas Cdiff Test.
A negative level composed of only the stool suspension in cobas PCR Media was also
tested. The study used three unique lots of cobas Cdiff Test reagents and three
instruments for a total of 36 runs over 12 days. A description of the precision panels
and the study summary is shown in Table 1. Analysis of the variance components
(Table 2) suggested that most variability of target Ct values was attributed to within
run and lot to lot factors (60.0% and 25.3%, respectively) for concentrations at or
around LOD. For concentration levels above LOD, most of the Ct value variability
was attributed to within run and instrument to instrument factors (72.5% and 24.7%,
respectively). Overall percent coefficients of variation (CV) for panel members at
LOD and above LOD were 1.5% and 1.1%, respectively (Table 3).

Reproducibility
The reproducibility of the cobas Cdiff Test on the cobas 4800 System was established
in a multi-site investigation using simulated clinical samples evaluated across lot,
site/instrument, operator, day and within-run.
Reproducibility test panels of four specimens, with three replicates each, were
prepared at varying concentrations of C. difficile strain ATCC 43255 (Negative,
Below LOD, 1 x LOD, and 3 x LOD) into pooled, C. difficile-negative, unformed
stool matrix in cobas PCR Media and tested at three sites by two operators/day for
five days/lot over two lots for an overall total of 720 tests (4 specimens x 3 replicates
x 3 sites x 2 operators/site x 5 days/lot x 2 lots) or 180 tests/panel member or 90
tests/panel member/lot.
Overall, 60 runs were performed; all external controls and all runs were valid. Of the
720 test performed across all panel members, there were 712 (98.9%) valid results;
Seven failed results were due to clot detection or pipetting errors, and one invalid
result was due to an invalid internal control result. Only valid test results were
included in percent agreement analyses.
Table 4 summarizes the Ct values and the overall percent agreement (two-sided 95%
exact CI) by site and panel member. The SD and CV (%) for Ct values across positive
panel members ranged from 0.64 to 0.71 and 1.7 to 1.9%, respectively. The positive
percent agreements for the C. difficile positive panel members Below LOD, 1 x LOD,
and 3 x LOD were 66.1% (95% CI: 58.7% to 73.0%), 100.0% (95% CI: 98.0% to
100.0%), and 100.0% (95% CI: 97.9% to 100.0%), respectively. The negative percent
agreement for negative panel member was 100.0% (95% CI: 97.9% to 100.0%).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Specimen stability
Unformed stool specimen stability was demonstrated by testing ten C. difficile
positive and two negative clinical specimens on the cobas 4800 system after
consecutive storage at 30 ± 1°C for two days, followed by 2-8°C for five days,
followed by -20°C for 60 days. The results supported the storage of unformed stool
specimens at 2-30°C for two days, or 2-8°C for seven days, and at -20°C for 60 days.
The stability of stool specimens mixed with the cobas PCR media was demonstrated
by testing the specimen panel mixed in the cobas PCR media after storage at 30 ± 1°C
for seven days and at 2-8°C for one and two months. The results supported the
storage of stool specimen mixed with cobas PCR media at 30°C for seven days or at
2-8°C for 60 days.
Controls
The cobas Cdiff Test uses Positive (+) and Negative (-) Controls (cobas 4800 Cdiff
Controls and Cofactor Kit), and an Internal Control (cobas 4800 System Internal
Control Kit 1). One set of Positive and Negative Controls are included in each run.
For any run, valid results must be obtained for both the Positive and Negative Control
for the cobas 4800 Software to display the reportable cobas Cdiff Test results from
that run.
Positive control. The Cdiff (+) Control contains non-infectious DNA plasmids of C.
difficile. The Cdiff (+) Control monitors nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and
detection steps in a given run of the test. The Cdiff (+) Control result must be ‘Valid’.
Negative control. The (-) Control result must be ‘Valid’.
Internal control. The Internal Control is a recombinant bacteriophage lambda that
contains randomized sequences and targets for internal control-specific primers and
probe. The Internal Control is added to all specimens and the Positive and Negative
Controls during sample preparation on the cobas x 480 instrument. The Internal
Control monitors nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and detection steps for a
given specimen. The Internal Control is also required for validation of the run
controls.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity (Limit of Detection or LOD) for the cobas Cdiff Test was
determined by analyzing quantified cultures of seven toxigenic C. difficile strains
diluted into pooled negative stool specimen matrix in cobas PCR Media. All levels
were analyzed using cobas Cdiff Test across three unique reagent lots. At least 21
9

--- Page 10 ---
replicates per reagent lot were tested at each level. The LOD of the test was defined
as defined as the target concentration which was detected as positive in ≥ 95% of the
replicates tested, based on results generated by the worst performing reagent lot. The
seven C. difficile strains tested are shown in Table 7.

Inclusivity/reactivity
The sensitivity of the cobas Cdiff Test was determined for 28 additional strains of
toxigenic C. difficile tested at a minimum of three concentrations and 40 replicates
per concentration level. The lowest levels that had at least a 95% hit rate are
summarized in Table 8. All 28 strains were detected as positive in ≥ 95% of
replicates at concentrations ranging from 77.9 to 460 CFU/swab.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity:
Cross reactivity was evaluated with a panel that consisted of 103 bacteria, fungi, and
viruses that may be found in stool specimens and one human cell line (Table 9). In
addition, 28 Clostridium genus organisms including non-toxigenic C. difficile were
tested (Table 10).
Bacteria were quantified as colony forming units (CFU)/mL, human cells were
quantified as cells/mL, and viruses were quantified as plaque forming units
(PFU)/mL, except for the following microorganisms: Chlamydia trachomatis was
quantified as elementary bodies (EB)/mL, and Cytomegalovirus, Human Echovirus,
and Human Enterovirus were quantified as IU/mL.
All bacteria and human cells were spiked to 1 x 106 Units/mL, and all viruses were
spiked to 1 x 105 Units/mL, except for Adenovirus Type 40, Cytomegalovirus
(HHV5), and Human Rotavirus, which were spiked to lower concentrations due to
stock concentration limitations. Testing was performed with the organisms alone or
with two C. difficile isolates present individually at 3 x Limit of Detection (LOD) of
the cobas Cdiff Test. Results indicated that none of these organisms interfered with
detection of the intended C. difficile targets. None produced false positive results
when there was no intended C. difficile target present.

Clostridium botulinum cross reactivity was evaluated in silico using BLAST and
Fuzznuc programs against the GenBank nucleotide sequence database to mimic PCR
amplicon generation and probe detection steps. In silico analysis indicated that cross
reactivity with C. botulinum is highly unlikely.

Interference
Twenty-six commonly used medications, as well as fecal fat, whole blood, and
mucin, were tested for potential interference effects with the cobas Cdiff Test. The
amount of potentially interfering substance is expressed as the concentration in the
primary stool specimen. The effects of the potentially interfering substances were
evaluated in the presence and absence of two toxigenic C. difficile isolates spiked to
approximately three times the LOD of the cobas Cdiff Test as determined for those
strains in the LoD study (54 and 113 CFU/mL). No interference was observed for the
exogenous substances tested. For fecal fat, no interference was observed up to 28%,
for whole blood, no interference was observed up to 50%, and for mucin, no
interference was observed up to 25%. Mucin at 50% interfered with the detection of
the toxigenic C. difficile isolates. These results are summarized in Table 11.

Cross Contamination and Carryover Contamination:
The cross contamination rate was assessed by testing a series of high positive
toxigenic C. difficile samples and negative samples in a checkerboard configuration
on the cobas 4800 system. High positive samples were prepared by spiking pooled
negative stool matrix with C. difficile culture to generate a Ct of the 95th percentile of
the clinical specimen population. A total of 94 samples were included per run.
A total of nine runs were performed using three cobas 4800 systems with alternating
checkerboard configurations to assess the cross contamination rate. A total of three
runs of negative samples following checkerboard runs were performed to assess the
carry-over contamination rate. In the nine checkerboard runs, one out of 423 negative
samples produced a positive result for a cross contamination rate of 0.24%. None of
the 282 negative samples from the carry-over contamination runs produced a positive
result.

f. Assay cut-off:
Data from pre-clinical testing of stool specimens as well as limit of detection,
inclusivity, and within-laboratory repeatability studies were compiled and analyzed to
verify the preliminary cut-off value. None of the negative results exhibited a Ct value
before the cut-off. The cut-off was validated in the prospective clinical study which
demonstrated an adequate separation between the cut-off and the highest Ct value
observed for a positive specimen.

toxigenic culture using leftover, de-identified, unformed stool samples from subjects
suspected of having CDI. Specimens were collected at five geographically diverse
sites across the US from symptomatic eligible male and female subjects. The
toxigenic culture was performed at a single reference laboratory and the cobas Cdiff
Test was performed at one of three designated sites. A specimen was considered
positive for toxigenic C. difficile if C. difficile was recovered from stool either by
direct or enriched toxigenic culture and if the recovered isolates tested positive by
cytotoxicity testing. If toxigenic C. difficile was isolated from the direct culture, the
enrichment culture was not further processed. Specimens were classified as negative
for toxigenic C. difficile only if they tested negative by both direct, and repeat direct
and enrichment culture. The sensitivity, specificity, and PPV and NPV values were
calculated by comparing cobas Cdiff Test results with the combined results of direct
and enrichment toxigenic culture. In addition, the positive percent agreement (PPA)
and negative percent agreement (NPA) was determined comparing the cobas Cdiff
Test with the initial direct culture results. Discrepant analysis was performed using an
FDA cleared nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) on all samples with discordant
results between the cobas Cdiff Test and toxigenic culture.
Specimens were collected from 683 evaluable subjects: 306 males (44.8%) and 377
females (55.2%) with a mean age of 56 years (range 3 to 99). Specimens from all 683
subjects had valid results for both direct toxigenic culture but one sample lacked
15

sufficient volume for repeat direct and enrichment culture and was not included in the
statistical analysis. Of the 683 specimens, 113 were positive for toxigenic C. difficile
during the initial direct toxigenic culture and 141 of 682 were positive for toxigenic
C. difficile using the combined results of direct and enrichment toxigenic culture, for
a prevalence rate of 20.7% for the study.
In a total of 49 cobas Cdiff Test runs in the clinical study, all external positive and
negative controls were valid. Two failed runs (4.1%) were observed in the study due
to one hardware error and one operational incident. Out of 683 specimens, the initial
cobas Cdiff Test invalid rate was 0.3% (2/683) and the final invalid rate following
one retest as per the labelled instructions for use was 0% (0/683). The initial cobas
Cdiff Test failed rate was 0.7% (5/683) and the final failed rate following one retest
was 0% (0/683).
Comparison with combined direct and enrichment culture
The clinical performance of the cobas Cdiff Test compared with the combined direct
culture and enrichment culture results is shown in Table 12. The sensitivity and
specificity of the cobas Cdiff Test were 92.9% (131/141; 95% CI: 87.4% to 96.1%)
and 98.7% (534/541; 95% CI: 97.4% to 99.4%), respectively; and the PPV and NPV
were 94.9% (95% CI: 89.9% to 97.5%) and 98.2% (95% CI: 96.6% to 99.0%),
respectively.

a Includes combined results from an initial direct culture and a repeat direct and
enrichment culture performed on all initial direct culture-negative samples. One
specimen with an initial direct culture-negative result had insufficient specimen
volume to perform repeat direct culture and enrichment culture and was excluded
from the analysis. Thirty-six (36) specimens with initial direct culture-negative
results had their combined direct and enrichment culture results based on repeat
culture that used three culture plate media (CCFA, CCFA-HB, CCFA-VA) in
combination with enrichment culture. Of these 36 specimens, 21 were culture
positive.
b Of the 10 specimens with false-negative cobas Cdiff Test results relative to
combined direct and enrichment culture, all 10 were negative by a second NAAT
c Of the seven specimens with false-positive cobas Cdiff Test results relative to
combined direct and enrichment culture, three were positive and four were
negative by that second NAAT method.
