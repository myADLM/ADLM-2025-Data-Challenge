See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The VARIANT II TURBO HbA1c Kit – 2.0 is intended for the quantitative
determination of hemoglobin A1c (IFCC mmol/mol and NGSP %) in human whole blood
using ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on the
VARIANT™ II TURBO Hemoglobin Testing System and VARIANT II TURBO Link
Hemoglobin Testing System.
This test is to be used as an aid in diagnosis of diabetes and as an aid in identifying
patients who may be at risk for developing diabetes.
The VARIANT™ II TURBO HbA1c Kit – 2.0 is intended for Professional Use Only.
The Hemoglobin Capillary Collection System (HCCS) is intended for the collection of
human whole blood for the percentage determination of hemoglobin A1c using Bio-Rad
HPLC methods
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The HbA1c test is not intended for analysis of samples collected from newborns.
The HbA1c test should not be used to replace glucose testing in pediatric patients,
pregnant women, or patients with Type 1 diabetes.
The HbA1c test should not be used to diagnose diabetes during pregnancy.
The HbA1c test should not be used to diagnose diabetes in patients with the following
conditions:
· Any condition that alters the life span of the red blood cells, including recent
blood loss, transfusion, significant iron deficiency, hemolytic anemia (including
hereditary spherocytosis), or other hemolytic diseases, hemoglobinopathies and
thalassemias, as the altered red blood cell turnover interferes with the relationship
between mean blood glucose and HbA1c values.
· Malignancies or severe chronic hepatic and renal disease.
2

--- Page 3 ---
· In cases of rapidly evolving type 1 diabetes the increase of HbA1c values might
be delayed compared to the acute increase in glucose concentrations. In these
conditions diabetes mellitus must be diagnosed based on plasma glucose
concentration and/or the typical clinical symptoms.
· Hemoglobin A1c should not be used in the diagnosis of gestational diabetes.
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
All performance data was conducted using the Bio-Rad VARIANT II TURBO

L. Test Principle:
The test principal of the device is based on chromatographic separation of HbA1c on a cation
exchange cartridge. The various forms of hemoglobin exhibit charge differences (positive) at
the acidic pH of the mobile phase, and thus can be separated on a support that is negatively
charged (cation exchange). The use of ion-exchange chromatography then allows molecules
to be separated based upon a molecule's charge. Separation is optimized to minimize
interferences from hemoglobin variants (HbS, HbC, HbD and HbE trait), labile A1c,
hemoglobin F and carbamylated hemoglobin.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed per CLSI EP06-A: Evaluation of the Linearity of
Quantitative Measuring Procedures; Linearity across the reportable range was
performed using altered samples to obtain a low 3.4% HbA1c (14 mmol/mol) and a
high 20.65% HbA1c (203 mmol/mol) EDTA whole blood patient samples. These
samples were mixed together in varying ratios to obtain the 9 intermediate samples
levels. The measured values were compared to the expected values. Polynomial
regression analysis (for first, second, and third order polynomials) were performed to
determine the statistical significance of non-linearity. The higher order coefficients
were found not to be significant and linearity was demonstrated using the second
order regression analysis. The regression parameters (slope, intercept, and R2) were
the following:
NGSP:
Slope Intercept R2 Sample range tested
1.033 -0.269 0.998 3.4-20.65% HbA1c
IFCC:
Slope Intercept R2 Sample range tested
1.033 -2.171 0.998 14-203 mmol/mol HbA1c
The linearity study supports the device’s claimed assay measuring range of 3.4 to
20.6% HbA1c (NGSP) and 14 to 203 mmol/mol HbA1c (IFCC).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The assigned HbA1c values of the VARIANT™ II TURBO HbA1c Kit -2.0 are
certified with the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). The
NGSP certification expires in one year. See NGSP website for current certification at
http://www.ngsp.org.
The final reportable result is traceable to both the International Federation of Clinical
Chemistry (IFCC) and the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). The
International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) units of mmol/mol are
calculated using the Master Equation NGSP (%) = 0.09148 x IFCC (mmol/mol) +
2.152. HbA1c results are provided to the customers using two different units: NGSP
equivalent units (%) and IFCC equivalent units (mmol/mol).

Calibrator and Control Materials:
Value assignment for calibrators (VARIANT™ II TURBO HbA1c Kit – 2.0
Calibrator/Diluent Set) which are recommended for use with this device, were
previously reviewed under 510(k) submission k070452. Bio-Rad’s commercially
available control materials were previously reviewed in submission k070546 and
k052838.
Reagent Stability:
Reagent stability was previously reviewed in k070452. The Elution Buffers and
Wash/Diluent Solution are stable until the expiration date when stored unopened at
15–30 °C. After opening the bottles, Elution Buffer A is stable for 30 days, Elution
Buffer B is stable for 90 days, and Wash/Diluent Solution is stable for 60 days, when
stored at 15–30 °C. The reconstituted Calibrators are stable for 24 hours when stored
capped at 2–8 °C. The labeling indicates “Do not use the reconstituted Calibrators
after 24 hours.”
Sample Stability:
A study was conducted to show the stability of frozen samples collected in K and
2
K EDTA. Samples with concentration values spanning 3.50% to 20.60% HbA1c
3
were collected in K -EDTA tubes, K -EDTA tubes and the aliquots of the whole
2 3
blood samples were placed at -70°C for four months. Study protocols were reviewed
and found to be acceptable. The data supports the use of K -EDTA tubes and K -
2 3
EDTA tubes with frozen whole blood aliquoted and stored at -70°C for up to for 4
months when using the VARIANT II TURBO HbA1c Kit 2.0.
d. Detection limit:
Not Applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
i.) Endogenous Interference:
Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could interfere
with the VARIANT II TURBO HbA1c Kit-2.0. Whole blood samples with HbA1c
values of ~6.5% HbA1c and ~8% HbA1c were analyzed by spiking the interfering
substance into each of the two whole blood samples and then preparing serial
dilutions to achieve 10 concentrations. Ten replicates of each of the ten varying
concentrations were analyzed and compared to the reference sample (sample
containing no interferent). Significant interference was defined by the sponsor as %
recovery ≥ +/-7% of the expected 100% recovery.

Total protein 21 g/dL
ii.) Drug Interference:
A Drug Interference study was performed based per CLSI EP07-A2, Interference
Testing in Clinical Chemistry. Two EDTA whole blood sample pools were evaluated
using a whole blood sample with a concentration ~6.5%HbA1c and whole blood
sample with a concentration of ~8.0%HbA1c. Test samples were prepared by spiking
each drug at the interferent concentration shown in the Table below. Ten replicates of
each drug prepared with the test and control samples were analyzed using the
VARIANT™ II TURBO HbA1c Kit-2.0 on the VARIANT™ II TURBO
Hemoglobin Testing System.
Significant interference was defined as a more than ± 7% change in %HbA1c value
from the control. No significant interference was observed at therapeutic levels up to
the stated concentrations in the table below.

iii.) Cross Reactivity with Hemoglobin Derivatives:
A Hemoglobin Derivatives Interference study was performed based on CLSI EP07-
A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry. Potential interference from
Acetylated hemoglobin (Hb), Carbamylated hemoglobin (Hb) and Labile HbA1c
were evaluated using a whole blood sample with a concentration ~6.5%HbA1c and a
whole blood sample with a concentration of ~8.0% HbA1c. The potentially
interfering hemoglobin derivatives were spiked into the whole blood samples and
each sample was analyzed using ten replicates each in the same analytical run on the
VARIANT™ II TURBO Hemoglobin Testing System with the VARIANT™ II
TURBO HbA1c Kit – 2.0.
Significant interference was defined as more than a ±7% change in HbA1c value
from the control. The test result conclusions are as follows:
• Acetylated Hb- (up to 50 mg/dL) does not interfere with this assay.
• Carbamylated Hb - (up to 21 mg/dL) does not interfere with this assay.
• Labile A1c- (up to 1000mg/dL) glucose does not interfere with this assay.
Results showed there was no cross reactivity with these substances at physiological
levels.
