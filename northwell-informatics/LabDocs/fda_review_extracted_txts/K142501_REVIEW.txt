I. Device Description:
The Xpert Norovirus Assay is a, automated in vitro diagnostic test for detection and
differentiation of nucleic acid sequences for norovirus genogroup I and genogroup II
from human stool specimens collected from individuals with symptoms of acute
gastroenteritis. The test utilizes automated, multiplex real-time, reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect specific viral gene sequences associated
with norovirus genogroup I and genogroup II.
The Xpert Norovirus Assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert Instrument Systems
(GeneXpert Dx, GeneXpert Infinity-48, GeneXpert Infinity-48s, and GeneXpert Infinity-
80 systems). The GeneXpert Instrument System platform automates sample preparation,
amplification and real-time detection. The GeneXpert Instrument Systems require the use
of single-use, disposable cartridges (the Xpert Norovirus Cartridges) that hold the PCR
reagents and host the PCR process.
The Xpert Norovirus Assay includes reagents for the detection and differentiation of
nucleic acid sequences for norovirus genogroup I and genogroup II human stool specimens
collected from patients with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis. All reagents except the
Sample Reagent are contained pre-loaded in the cartridge. A Sample Processing Control
(SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) are also included in the cartridge. The SPC is
present to control for adequate processing of the target viruses and to monitor the presence
of inhibitors in the PCR reaction. The Probe Check Control (PCC) verifies reagent
rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity and dye stability.
The single-use, multi-chambered fluidic cartridges are designed to complete sample

preparation and real-time RT-PCR for detection and differentiation of norovirus
genogroup I and genogroup II viral RNA in 90 minutes or less. The GeneXpert
Instrument Systems, comprised of the GeneXpert Dx Systems and the GeneXpert
Infinity Systems, have 1 to 80 randomly accessible modules, depending upon the
instrument, that are each capable of performing separate sample preparation and real-
time PCR and RT- PCR tests. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing
fluids (i.e., the syringe drive activates the plunger that works in concert with the
rotary valve in the cartridge to move fluids between chambers), an ultrasonic horn for
®
lysing cells or spores, and a proprietary I-CORE thermocycler for performing real-
time PCR and RT-PCR and detection.
Specimens are collected following the user’s institution standard procedures for collecting
®
stool specimens for norovirus testing and sent to the GeneXpert testing area for
processing. The specimen may be stored at 2–8 ºC for up to two days prior to processing.
When ready to process the specimen, a single-use disposable dry swab is used for transfer
of the stool specimen to the Sample Reagent bottle that is provided with the Xpert
Norovirus Assay kit. The user vortexes the capped Sample Reagent bottle for
10 seconds and transfers the entire contents to the sample chamber in the top of the
disposable fluidic cartridge with a transfer pipette. The user initiates a test from the
system user interface and places the cartridge into the GeneXpert instrument platform,
which performs hands-off real-time, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for
detection of RNA. The results are automatically generated at the end of the process in a
report that can be viewed and printed.
The Xpert Norovirus Assay kit contains sufficient reagents to process 10 specimens or
quality control samples.

L. Test Principle:
The Xpert Norovirus Assay is automated and utilizes reverse real-time RT-PCR to detect
specific viral gene sequences associated with norovirus genogroup I and genogroup II. The
primers and probes in the Xpert Norovirus Assay are designed to amplify and detect unique
gene sequences within the conserved region of the Norovirus genome. The stool specimens are
collected from individuals with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis and transported to the
laboratory in a clean container. A swab is inserted into the stool specimen and then placed in
a tube containing sample reagent. Following a brief vortexing, the eluted sample is
transferred into the sample chamber of the disposable fluidic cartridge (the GeneXpert
®
cartridge). The GeneXpert cartridge is loaded onto the GeneXpert Instrument System
platform, which performs hands-off automated sample processing and real-time RT-PCR for
identification and differentiation of norovirus genogroup I and genogroup II. Test results are
obtained in 90 minutes.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was performed using a panel of 7 specimens with varying
concentrations of norovirus GI and norovirus GII; the panel was tested two times on
five different days by two different operators, at each of three sites (7 samples x 2
times/day x 5 days x 2 operators x 3 sites). One lot of Xpert Norovirus Assay
cartridges was used at each of the 3 testing sites. Results are presented in the table
below.

b. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Xpert Norovirus Assay includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe
Check Control (PCC). The success rate was >95% on the first attempt and was
acceptable.
Recommended external quality control organisms were also tested at the sites. External
controls should be used in accordance with accrediting institutions and government
regulations. External controls are commercially available and not provided in the test kit;
however, the catalog numbers for a source of external controls are provided in the
“Materials Available but Not Provided” section of the Xpert Norovirus Assay Package
Insert.
c. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) study was performed to evaluate the analytical sensitivity
of the Xpert Norovirus Assay using norovirus GI.3 and norovirus GII.4 diluted into a
negative stool matrix. The LoD of the Xpert Norovirus Assay is defined as the
lowest concentration (copies/mL) per sample that can be reproducibly distinguished
from negative samples with 95% confidence. The LoD was determined using seven
(7) dilutions per norovirus genotype with a minimum of 23 replicates per dilution using
two reagent lots across 3 testing days. Dilutions were prepared with a pooled negative
clinical stool matrix to achieve final concentrations ranging from 3.32 x 104

concentrations ranging from 1.03 x 104 copies/mL to 4.97 x 105 copies/mL for the
norovirus GII.4 genotype.
The LoD was estimated for each reagent lot using probit regression and the highest LoD
observed per genotype from both lots was further verified by testing 20 replicates
(verification of LoD).
The LoDs of the Xpert Norovirus Assay for the two genotypes are presented in the

d. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)
The analytical reactivity of the Xpert Norovirus Assay was evaluated against thirty-
one genotypes representing norovirus genogroups GI and GII. The studies were
carried out with positive clinical stool specimens or RNA transcripts (when clinical
specimens were not readily available) representing multiple GI and GII genotypes at
levels near the LoD. Positive clinical stool specimens were tested for six (6) GI
genotypes and fourteen (14) GII genotypes including the recently circulating Norovirus
GII.4 Sydney strain and the previously dominant Norovirus GII.4 New Orleans strain
with the Xpert Norovirus Assay. Eleven (11) RNA transcripts were tested for three (3)
GI genotypes and eight (8) GII genotypes with the Xpert Norovirus Assay. The results of
the analytical reactivity (inclusivity) study demonstrated that the Xpert Norovirus Assay
appropriately identified all the temporally and geographically diverse samples selected to
represent the range of norovirus genotypes. The table below shows the data for the
analytical studies.

An estimated concentration or titer was provided based on a Ct value; because of the difficulty in
culturing norovirus particles, an exact concentration cannot be provided. The Ct value for each
clinical specimen in the inclusivity study was extrapolated to the titer obtained from the LoD study
for well-characterized GI and GII samples using a standard curve at CDC

e. Analytical specificity (Cross Reactivity):
The analytical specificity of the Xpert Norovirus Assay was evaluated by testing a
panel of 68 organisms, consisting of 54 bacteria, 1 fungus, 9 viruses, and 4 parasites,
representing common gastroenteritis pathogens or those potentially encountered in
stool. All organisms were tested with a minimum of three replicates. The bacteria
and fungus were tested at concentrations ≥ 106 CFU/mL. The viruses were tested at
concentrations ≥ 105 TCID /mL, with the exception of two viruses obtained from
50
clinical samples with unknown concentrations. The parasites were tested at
concentrations ≥ 106 copies/mL. All organisms tested were correctly reported as
Norovirus GI not DETECTED; Noro GII not DETECTED by the Xpert Norovirus
Assay. Results are shown in the table below.

benzalkonium chloride (1% (w/v), 0.2% (w/v), and 0.04% (w/v)). False negative
test results were reported for the Norovirus GII target at 1% (w/v) benzalkonium
chloride. In the presence of 5% (w/w) barium sulfate, a statistically significant
inhibitory effect was observed on the Norovirus GII Ct in positive samples relative
to the control sample (p-value <0.05). No statistically significant effect was
observed on the Norovirus GII Ct relative to the control sample in the presence of
1% (w/w) barium sulfate.
No other potentially interfering substances were found to be inhibitory and no
false-negatives were reported for these substances.

g. Carry-over Contamination Study
A study was conducted to demonstrate that the single-use, self-contained GeneXpert
cartridges prevent carry-over contamination in negative samples that are run
immediately after very high positive samples have been run in the same GeneXpert
module. The study consisted of a negative sample processed in a GeneXpert module
immediately followed by a highly positive Norovirus GII sample processed in the
same GeneXpert module. This testing scheme was repeated 21 times in two
GeneXpert modules for a total of 42 runs for 20 positive and 22 negative specimens.
All 19 positive samples were correctly reported as “Norovirus GI not Detected;
Norovirus GII Detected” and one positive sample was reported as an Error. All 22
negative samples were correctly reported as “Norovirus GI not Detected; Norovirus
GII not Detected.”

Clinical Performance
Performance characteristics of the Xpert Norovirus Assay were evaluated at seven
institutions in the U.S. and Europe. The study specimens consisted of raw or
unpreserved unformed stool specimens from subjects with symptoms of acute
gastroenteritis. The Xpert Norovirus Assay performance was compared to a
composite reference test method performed at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. A total of 1403 specimens were tested for norovirus GI by the Xpert
Norovirus Assay and the composite reference test. Of the 1403 specimens, 914 were
fresh, prospectively collected and 489 were frozen, archived specimens. A total of
1401 specimens were tested for norovirus GII by the Xpert Norovirus Assay and the
composite reference test. Of the 1401 specimens, 914 were fresh, prospectively
collected and 487 were frozen, archived specimens.
With fresh, prospectively collected specimens, the Xpert Norovirus Assay
demonstrated a Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) of 100% and a Negative Percent
Agreement (NPA) of 99.6% for detection of Norovirus GI, relative to the composite
reference test. The Xpert Norovirus Assay demonstrated 98.5% PPA and 98.8%
NPA for detection of Norovirus GII in fresh, prospectively collected specimens.
With frozen, archived specimens, the Xpert Norovirus Assay demonstrated 98.1%
PPA and 94.6% NPA for detection of Norovirus GI, relative to the composite
reference test. The Xpert Norovirus Assay demonstrated 100% PPA and 96.8% NPA
for detection of Norovirus GII with frozen, archived specimens.
