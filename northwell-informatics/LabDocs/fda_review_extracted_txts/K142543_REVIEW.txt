Edition.
L. Test Principle:
The Mission® U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer is a reflectance photometer that analyzes the
intensity and color of light reflected from the reagent areas of a urinalysis reagent strip.
Using a light emitting diode (LED) as the light source and a CMOS image sensor as a light
sensor, the optical system reads the color change in the urine test strips after a sample is
applied.
The Mission® U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer is used in conjunction with the Mission®
Urinalysis Reagent Strips and can detect qualitatively and/or semi-quantitatively the
following analytes in urine: glucose, bilirubin, ketone (acetoacetic acid), specific gravity,
pH, blood, protein, urobilinogen, leukocytes and ascorbic acid as well as the qualitative
detection of nitrite. The chemical reactions between the analytes in the urine and each test
pad on the Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips that causes a change in color are described
below:
Ascorbic acid: This test involves decolorization of Tillmann’s reagent. The presence of
ascorbic acid causes the color of the test field to change from blue-green to orange.
Glucose: This test is based on the enzymatic reaction that occurs between glucose oxidase,
peroxidase and chromogen. Glucose is first oxidized to produce gluconic acid and hydrogen
peroxide in the presence of glucose oxidase. The hydrogen peroxide reacts with potassium
iodide chromogen in the presence of peroxidase. The extent to which the chromogen is
oxidized determines the color which is produced, ranging from green to brown.
Bilirubin: This test is based on azo-coupling reaction of bilirubin with diazotized
dichloroaniline in a strongly acidic medium. Varying bilirubin levels will produce a pinkish-
tan color proportional to its concentration in urine.
Ketone: This test is based on ketones reacting with nitroprusside and acetoacetic acid to
produce a color change ranging from light pink for negative results to a darker pink or purple
color for positive results.
Specific Gravity: This test is based on the apparent pKa change of certain pretreated
polyelectrolytes in relation to ionic concentration. In the presence of an indicator, colors
range from deep blue-green in urine of low ionic concentration to green and yellow-green in
urine of increasing ionic concentration.
Blood: This test is based on the peroxidase-like activity of hemoglobin which catalyzes the
reaction of diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine. The
resulting color ranges from light orange to dark green.
pH: This test is based on a double indicator system which gives a broad range of colors
covering the entire urinary pH range. Colors range from orange to yellow and green to blue.
Protein: This reaction is based on the phenomenon known as the "protein error” of pH
indicators where an indicator that is highly buffered will change color in the presence of
proteins (anions) as the indicator releases hydrogen ions to the protein. At a constant pH, the
development of any green color is due to the presence of protein. Colors range from yellow
to yellow-green for negative results and green to green-blue for positive results.
7

--- Page 8 ---
Urobilinogen: This test is based on a modified Ehrlich reaction between p-
diethylaminobenzaldehyde and urobilinogen in strongly acidic medium to produce a pink
color. Urobilinogen is one of the major compounds produced in heme synthesis and is a
normal substance in urine.
Nitrite: This test depends upon the conversion of nitrate to nitrite by the action of Gram
negative bacteria in the urine. In an acidic medium, nitrite in the urine reacts with p-arsanilic
acid to form a diazonium compound. The diazonium compound in turn couples with 1N-(1-
naphthyl) ethylenediamine to produce a pink color.
Leukocytes: This test reveals the presence of granulocyte esterases. The esterases cleave a
derivatized pyrazole amino acid ester to liberate derivatized hydroxyl pyrazole. This
pyrazole then reacts with a diazonium salt to produce a beige-pink to purple color.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
In-house Precision Study:
The precision of the Mission U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer used with the Mission
Urinalysis Reagent Strips was evaluated using control solutions at level 1 (negative),
level 2 (low analyte concentration) and level 3 (high analyte concentration). The
target concentration of the analytes in each control solution was confirmed using
previously cleared methods. The total precision of the Mission U120 Ultra Urine
Analyzer was evaluated by testing each control solution was tested by two operators
with two lots of strip in duplicate per run, two runs each day for 20 days on two
Mission U120 Ultra Urine analyzers. A total of 160 strips were used for each level
control solution tested (2 strips x 2 run x 20 days x 2 operators/analyzers/strip lots =
160 tests per control). The repeatability of the Mission U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer
was evaluated by testing each level control solution by three operators on three
analyzers in replicates of 20 per run per day with three lots of strip for one day. A
total of 180 strips were used for each level control solution tested (20 strips x 3 strip
lots x 1 day x 3 operators/analyzers = 180 tests per control). The results from the in-
house precision evaluation are summarized below:

Point-of-Care (POC) Precision Study:
The precision of the Mission® U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer at point-of-care (POC)
sites was evaluated using control solutions at level 1 (negative), level 2 (low) and
level 3 (high). Control solutions were prepared by spiking each analyte in negative
urine pool to the target concentrations shown in the table below. The concentrations
of the analytes were confirmed using previously cleared methods. The three level
control solutions were dispensed in to different containers and were labeled randomly
with coded numbers. Three set of coded samples were sent to three POC sites (in
U.S.) for testing by three POC operators at each site. Each sample was tested once
per run, two runs per day for 20 days (N = 40 testing per sample). The results from
the point-of-care precision study are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A study to evaluate the reportable range (percent recovery) for each analyte color
block on the Mission® Urinalysis Reagent Strips was performed by measuring
negative urine and negative urine spiked with known concentrations corresponding to
the color blocks for each analyte on the test strip. The negative or expected value of
each sample was confirmed using the previously cleared methods. Each sample was
tested using three lots of strip, three strips per lot on three analyzers/operators for
three days. A total of 81 strips were used for each analyte concentration tested (3
strips x 3 strip lots x 3 operators / analyzers x 3 days = 81 strips per sample). The
percentages of exact block match of reported results at each analyte concentration
were calculated and recorded.
The percent recovery for each analyte at each concentration block (N=81 per sample)
is shown in the table below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability – The raw material for each analyte used for the two controls is
purchased from supplier with a certificate of analysis and prepared gravimetrically to
specific target analyte concentrations. The traceability chart provided by the sponsor
is acceptable.
Value assignment - The Mission Liquid Urine Control and the Mission Liquid
Diptube Urine Control (level 1 and 2) were value assigned by testing three lots of
control on three Mission U120 Ultra Urine Analyzers using three lots of Mission
Urinalysis Reagent Strips, for three consecutive days by three operators (N=243).
The assigned reference value range is printed in the “Expected Values” sheet included
with the package insert for each lot of urine controls. The target concentrations for
the two control levels are summarized in the table below:

Stability of the Mission Liquid Urine Control and the Mission Liquid Diptube Urine
Control (level 1 and 2) – The real time stability study protocol for the open vial
storage stability and shelf-life, and the acceptance criteria for the two controls was
reviewed and cleared under k103387. The two controls have a claimed shelf life of
24 months when stored at 2 to 8 ºC. Open control vials are stable for 30 days when
stored at 15 to 30 ºC and for 24 months when stored at 2 to 8 ºC.
Stability of the Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips – The stability study protocol and
acceptance criteria for the reagent strips was reviewed and found acceptable. Based
on the accelerated and real time studies, the claimed shelf life is 24 months when
stored at 2 to 8 ºC or at room temperature (30 ± 3 ºC). Open canister strips (opened
100 times) are stable for 98 days when stored at room temperature and 50 to 80%
relative humidity conditions.
d. Detection limit:
The cutoff of the assay at each color block was validated by spiking or diluting a
pooled urine sample with the stock solution of an analyte to achieve several
concentration levels. Each sample was tested with three test strips on three analyzer
by three operators, using three test strip lots for three days (3 strips x 3
operators/analyzers x 3 strip lots x 3 days = 81 tests). The cutoffs for each color
block are defined as the lowest and highest concentrations of analyte tested at which
over 50% of the results are positive for each color block.

e. Analytical specificity:
To evaluate interferences, known amounts of potential interfering substances
commonly found in human urine were added to pooled urine samples and tested using
the Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips and the Mission U120 Ultra Urine Analyzers.
Ten normal fresh urines were pooled and confirmed to be negative for the eleven
analytes. The pooled urine was spiked with the eleven analytes at the target
concentrations listed in the table below. The concentration of each analyte in the

The three level urine controls were spiked with the interfering substances. Three
levels of each analyte and at least two (or more when needed) levels of interfering
substance per analyte were evaluated in the study as per the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline.
Each urine sample was tested with one strip per lot and one analyzer. A total of three
strip lots and three analyzers (N = 9 testing per sample) were used for the study.
Interference is defined when the testing result with spiked interfering substance is not
the same color block as the expected result with the control solution with no
interfering substance. No interference is defined when the testing result with spiked
interfering substance is the same color block as the expected result with the control
solution with no interfering substance.

pH Interference:
The sponsor performed an additional study to evaluate the effect of sample pH on
the test results for the ten analytes in human urine. The study result shows that
sample pH from 5.0 to 9.0 does not affect the test results for urobilinogen, ketone,
bilirubin and glucose. Samples with pH greater than 8.0 affected the protein test
resulting in a false high result, and the blood test resulting in a false low result.
Samples with pH greater than 9.0 affected leukocyte and specific gravity tests giving
falsely high results and affected nitrite and ascorbic acid tests giving falsely low
results.
Specific Gravity Interference:
The sponsor performed an additional study to evaluate the effect of sample specific
gravity on the test results for the ten analytes in human urine. The study result
shows that sample specific gravity from 1.000 to 1.040 does not affect the test results
for urobilinogen, pH, blood, ketone, bilirubin and ascorbic acid. Samples with
specific gravity higher than 1.025 affected nitrite, protein and glucose tests giving
false low results. Samples with specific gravity higher than 1.020 affected leukocyte
test giving false low result.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Comparison studies were performed at five different POC sites to evaluate the
performance of the Mission® Urinalysis Reagent strip read by the Mission® U120
Ultra Urine Analyzer compared to the performance of the predicate method,
Mission® Urinalysis Reagent strip read by ACON U120 Urine Analyzer. A total of
120 patient urine specimens were randomly collected from patients at each of the
three POC sites (combined total of 360 clinical specimens), and tested by three POC
users at each site (total of nine users for all sites). In order to evaluate the
performance of the candidate device over the entire measuring range of each analyte,
additional samples, including contrived urine samples, were tested at two additional
POC sites resulting in up to 468 samples evaluated at all sites. Results of the
comparison study for the combined sites are shown in the tables below.

Semi-automatic reading of Mission reagent strips on Mission U120 Ultra urine analyzer.
Each reagent strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional
readings. The labeling and user guide specify that the strips are for single use.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes __X______ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
The Patient ID is entered either manually using the keyboard or scanned using the
barcode reader (Barcode ID).
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
It is recommended that collection of the urine is in a clean and dry container and testing
is completed as soon as possible. The use of urine preservatives is not recommended. If
testing cannot be done within an hour after voiding, the specimen should be refrigerated.
The refrigerated specimen should be brought to room temperature before testing.
The labeling also warns as “Prolonged storage of unpreserved urine at room temperature
may result in microbial proliferation with resultant changes in pH. A shift to alkaline pH
may cause false positive results with the protein test area. Urine containing glucose may
decrease in pH as organisms metabolize the glucose. Contamination of the urine
specimen with skin cleansers containing chlorhexidine may affect protein (and to a lesser
extent, specific gravity and bilirubin) test results.”
5. Calibration:
The Mission® U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer performs an automatic calibration each time a
test is run.
6. Quality Control:
Recommendations for quality control are described in the labeling. Additionally, the
users should follow local, state and federal regulations.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
A study to validate the pH versus specific gravity correction function (pH compensation) of
the Mission U120 Ultra Urine analyzer. pH compensation corrects the effect of sample pH
on the test results of specific gravity. The study evaluated the effect of sample pH (4.0, 4.5,
