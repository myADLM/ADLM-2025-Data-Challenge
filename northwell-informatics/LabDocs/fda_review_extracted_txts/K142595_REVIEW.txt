H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
For in vitro diagnostic use only. VITROS Chemistry Products HbA1c Reagent Kit is used
on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemisty System, VITROS 4600 Chemistry System and the
VITROS 5600 Integrated System for the quantitative determination of percent glycated
hemoglobin A1c (DCCT/NGSP) and mmol/mol hemoglobin A1c (IFCC) in human whole
blood. The test is to be used as an aid in diagnosis of diabetes, as an aid in identifying
patients who may be at risk for developing diabetes and for the monitoring of long-term
blood glucose control in individuals with diabetes mellitus.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. VITROS Calibrator Kit 31 is used to calibrate the
VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System, VITROS 4600 Chemistry System and the VITROS
5600 Integrated System for the determination of percent glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in
human whole blood.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. VITROS Chemistry Products %A1c Performance
Verifiers I and II are assayed controls used on the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System, the
VITROS 4600 Chemistry System and the VITROS 5600 Integrated System to monitor
performance of the VITROS d%A1c and VITROS HbA1c Reagent Kits.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Prescription Use Only
This device has significant negative interference with fetal hemoglobin (HbF). HbA1c
results are invalid for patients with abnormal amounts of HbF including those with
known Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin.”
The result from this or any other diagnostic test should be used and interpreted only in the
context of the overall clinical picture.
Hemoglobin A1c should not be used to diagnose diabetes mellitus in patients with a
hemoglobinopathy but normal red cell turnover (e.g. sickle cell trait).
Hemoglobin A1c should not be used in patients with homozygous sickle cell trait,
hemolytic anemia, or other hemolytic diseases and recent significant or chronic blood
loss.
2

--- Page 3 ---
Hemoglobin A1c should not be used to diagnose gestational diabetes. It reflects the
average blood glucose levels over the preceding 3 months (the average life of a red blood
cell) and therefore may be falsely low during pregnancy or any condition associated with
reset onset of hyperglycemia.
In very rare cases of rapidly evolving type 1 diabetes, the increase of HbA1c values
might be delayed compared to the acute increase in glucose concentrations and/or the
typical clinical symptoms.
Hemoglobin A1c should not be used to diagnose diabetes mellitus in patients with
malignancies or severe chronic hepatic and renal disease.
Hemoglobin A1c testing should not replace glucose testing for type 1 diabetes, in
pediatric patients and in pregnant women.

L. Test Principle:
Whole blood samples are hemolyzed on the VITROS 5,1 FS and VITROS 4600 Chemistry
Systems and the VITROS 5600 Integrated System. Calibrators, controls and hemolyzed
whole blood samples are mixed with Reagent 1 containing anti-HbA1c antibody to form a
soluble antigen-antibody complex. Hemoglobin in the hemolyzed whole blood is converted
with Reagent 1 to a hematin derivative that is measured bichromatically at 340 nm and 700
nm. Unbound anti-HbA1c antibody reacts with polyhapten (hexapeptide-glycan, A1c
Reagent 2) to form an insoluble antibody-polyhapten immune complex, which is measured
turbidimetrically at 340 nm. %A1c is a derived test calculated from the quantitative
measurements of hemoglobin and hemoglobin A1c.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed according to CLSI EP05-A2- Evaluation of
Precision Performance of Clinical Devices; Approved Guideline using three VITROS
Chemistry HbA1c Reagents lots tested on each of three VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry
Systems, three VITROS 4600 Chemistry Systems and three VITROS 5600 Integrated
Systems analyzers. Two runs were performed for a minimum of 20 days on each of
three VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems, VITROS 4600 Chemistry Systems and
VITROS 5600 Integrated Systems analyzers. Each run included four whole blood
based control fluids (~5, ~6.5, ~8 and ~12% HbA1c). The whole blood based control
fluids were analyzed in duplicate for a minimum of 720 measurements per sample.
An additional precision study was also performed with three VITROS Chemistry
HbA1c reagent lots tested on each of three VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems, three
VITROS 4600 Chemistry Systems and three VITROS 5600 Integrated Systems
analyzers. Two runs were performed for 4 consecutive days on each of three VITROS
5,1 FS Chemistry Systems, three VITROS 4600 Chemistry Systems and three
VITROS 5600 Integrated Systems analyzers. Each run included four whole blood
patient samples (~5, ~6.5, ~8 and ~12% HbA1c). Each of the whole blood patient
samples were analyzed in duplicate for a total of 144 measurements per patient
sample.
The results of the two precision studies are as follows:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was conducted according to CLSI EP06-A- Evaluation of the
Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedure: A statistical Approach. Linearity
was assessed by taking a low (2.54% HbA1c) pool and a high (20.9% HbA1c) pool
and inter-mixing the two pools to create 17 intermediate pools. The measured values
were compared to the theoretical values based upon the dilution factor. Polynomial
regression analysis (for first, second, and third order polynomials) were performed to
determine the statistical significance of non-linearity. The higher order coefficients
were found not to be significant and linearity was demonstrated using the second
order regression analysis. The regression parameters (slope, intercept and r2) were the
following:
NGSP:

Tested
VITROS 5,1 FS 0.005 0.9995 0.999 2.39 to 17.35 %HbA1c

VITROS 5600 0.099 0.9988 0.999 8.1 to 149.1 mmol/mol
The results of the linearity studies support the sponsor’s claim that the VITROS
Chemistry HbA1c assay is linear across the measuring range of 4-14% HbA1c when
using the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System, the VITROS 4600 Chemistry System
and the VITROS 5600 Integrated System analyzers.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The values assigned to the VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 31 for %A1c
are traceable to the IFCC (International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and
Laboratory Medicine) Reference Method. The VITROS® Chemistry Products HbA1c
Reagent Kit is certified by The National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program
(NGSP). See the website for current certification at: http://www.ngsp.org

The derived result (%A1c) is calculated from the individual quantitative results for
hemoglobin (Hb) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). The International Federation of
Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) units of mmol/mol are calculated using the Master
Equation IFCC = (NGSP- 2.15) / 0.092. Two different units are provided to the
customers: NGSP equivalent units (%) and IFCC equivalents units (mmol/mol).
Value Assignment
The values assigned to the VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 31 and
VITROS Chemistry Products %A1c Products %A1c Performance Verifiers are
aligned to IFCC reference calibrators through an internal value assignment in which
calibrator values must meet the sponsor’s pre-determined acceptance criteria within a
set specification, determined by the manufacturer. Each lot of VITROS Chemistry
Products Calibrator and VITROS Chemistry Products %A1c Products %A1c
Performance Verifiers are value-assigned. The concentration of glycated hemoglobin

e. Analytical specificity:
i. Endogenous Interference
Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could interfere
with the VITROS Chemistry Products HbA1c reagent kit. To determine endogenous
interference, two samples pools containing %A1c at approximate concentrations of
6.5% and 8.5% were used as control pools. These pools were spiked with the test
substances and the %A1c result was compared to the control pool with no interferent
present. Samples were analyzed in replicates of ten on the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry
System the VITROS 4600 Chemistry System and the VITROS 5600 Integrated
System. Significant interference was defined as greater or equal to +/- 7% difference
from the expected concentration. Results showed that no significant interference was
21

ii. Cross –Reactivity with Hemoglobin Derivatives: To determine interference from
labile, acetylated, and carbamylated hemoglobin as well as HbA0, HbA1a and
HbA1b, 3 EDTA whole blood patient samples for each interferent containing %A1c
concentrations of ~5%, ~6.5% and ~8.5% were used. Samples were treated to create
labile, acetylated and carbamylated hemoglobin and the % A1c result was compared
to the control samples with heat treatment but no chemical addition. Samples were
analyzed in replicates of ten. Significant interference was defined as greater or equal
to +/- 7% difference from the expected concentration. Results showed that no
significant interference was observed with the following substances up to the stated
