H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Please see Indications for Use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
CR3 Keyless Split Sample Cup Nortriptyline–Buprenorphine is a rapid test for the
qualitative detection of Nortriptyline (a major metabolite of Tricyclic Antidepressants)
and Buprenorphine in human urine at a cutoff concentration of 1000ng/mL and 10ng/mL,
respectively. The test is the first step in a two-step process. The second step is to send the
sample for laboratory testing if preliminary positive results are obtained. The test is
intended for over-the-counter and for prescription use.
The test may yield preliminary positive results even when prescription drugs including
Tricyclic Antidepressants and Buprenorphine are ingested, at prescribed doses; it is not
intended to distinguish between prescription use or abuse of these drugs. There are no
uniformly recognized cutoff concentration levels for Nortriptyline and Buprenorphine in
urine. The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative
chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS is
the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment
should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary
result is positive.
For in vitro diagnostic use only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Prescription and Over-the-counter Use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable; this is a visually read single use device.
I. Device Description:
The CR3 Keyless Split Sample Cup Nortriptyline–Buprenorphine test uses
immunochromatographic assays for nortriptyline and buprenorphine. The test is a lateral flow
system for the qualitative detection of nortriptyline and buprenorphine in human urine.

L. Test Principle:
The CR3 Keyless Split Sample Cup Nortriptyline - Buprenorphine test is a rapid flow
chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of Nortriptyline and
Buprenorphine in urine samples. Each assay uses a mouse monoclonal anti-drug antibody-
dye conjugate, fixed drug-protein conjugates, and anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibodies
coated on the test membranes. When the absorbent end of the test is immersed into a urine
sample, the urine is absorbed into the device by capillary action and mixes with the antibody-
dye conjugate, flowing across the pre-coated membrane. At analyte concentrations below the
target cut-off, antibody-dye conjugates bind to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the

Test Region (T) of the device. This produces a colored test line that indicates a negative
result. When analyte concentration is above the cut-off, analyte molecules bind to the
antibody-dye conjugate, preventing the antibody-dye conjugate from binding to the drug-
protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. No colored band shows
in the Test Region, indicating a potentially positive result. A band should form in the Control
Region (C) of the device regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Cross-reactivity was tested by adding various drug metabolites and other components
that are likely to be present in negative urine samples. The drug metabolites and other
components were tested at different concentrations. These samples were tested using
three lots of the CR3 Keyless Split Sample Cup Nortriptyline–Buprenorphine by three
different operators. The obtained lowest detectable concentration was used to calculate
the cross-reactivity. Results are shown below:

Effect of Specific Gravity and pH
Twelve urine samples of normal, high, and low specific gravity ranges (1.000 to
1.035) were collected and spiked with either Nortriptyline or Buprenorphine at 25%
below and 25% above the corresponding cut-off levels. The samples were tested
using three lots of the CR3Keyless Split Sample Cup Nortriptyline–Buprenorphine by
three different operators.
The pH of an aliquot negative urine pool was adjusted to pH ranges of 4.00 to 9.00 in
1 pH unit increments and spiked with Nortriptyline or Buprenorphine at 25% below
and 25% above the corresponding cut-off levels. The samples were tested using three
lots of the CR3Keyless Split Sample Cup Nortriptyline–Buprenorphine by three
different operators.
The device performance was found to not be affected by varying urine specific
gravity and pH.

Lay-user study
A lay user study was performed at three sites with 260 participants (20 tested drug-
free samples, 120 tested nortriptyline samples, and 120 tested buprenorphine
samples). They had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in
age from 21 to > 50 years. Urine samples were prepared at the following
concentrations; -100%, +/-75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of the cut-off by spiking drug(s) into
drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples w ere confirmed
by GC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers, blind-labeled and
randomized. Each participant was provided with the package insert, 1 blind labeled
sample and a device. The results are summarized below:

Lay-users were also given surveys on the ease of understanding the package insert
instructions. All lay users indicated that the device instructions can be easily followed
A Flesch-Kincaid reading analysis was performed on the package insert and the score
revealed a reading grade level of less than 7.
Temperature Strip
The temperature test strip that is a part of the test cup was evaluated for accuracy.
The temperature test strip provides a reading in the temperature range of 32 to 38ºC.
To test for accuracy, water samples were adjusted to different temperatures (32, 33,
34, 36, 37 and 38 ℃) and added to device test cups. Technicians read the temperature
on the strip on the cup and recorded the results. The temperature of the water
samples were also measured with a separate thermometer. Results obtained from the
temperature strip were consistent with the thermometer readings.
To validate the performance of the temperature test strip in the hands of the intended
user, a user study was conducted. In this user study, 100 lay users filled the device
test cups with urine according to the device labeling and used the temperature test
strip to record the temperature of their samples. Results were compared to readings of
the same samples by professionals. The study demonstrated that the lay users could
accurately read the test strip. Urine samples in the study were within the temperature
range of the test strip.
