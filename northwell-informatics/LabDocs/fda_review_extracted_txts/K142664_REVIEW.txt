caused by antigen-antibody reactions. The R1 Reagent contains: 0.13% latex, buffer,
stabilizers. The R2 Reagent contains: 0.05mg/ml Mouse anti-human HbA1c monoclonal
antibody, 0.08mg/ml Goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody, buffer, and stabilizers. The
reagent kit contains test cartridge, capillary holder, desiccant bag, cartridge instruction and
calibration card.
Two levels of URight Hemoglobin A1c controls will be included as part of the URight
Hemoglobin A1c System. Two levels of FORA A1c controls will be included as part of the
FORA A1c system. The controls are exactly the same except for their names. All
performance studies described below apply to the URight Hemoglobin A1c controls and the
FORA A1c controls. Throughout the discussion of the performance studies, the device will
be termed the URight Hemoglobin A1c controls. URight Hemoglobin A1c controls and
FORA A1c controls are provided for routine quality checks - level 1 in the normal HbA1c
range and level 2 in the elevated HbA1c range. The HbA1c controls are lyophilized

Methods
L. Test Principle:
The URight Hemoglobin A1c system and the FORA A1c System are an immuno-
turbidimetric method enhanced by latex particles using a two-reagent sequence. Hemolysate is
mixed with the R1 reagent. Addition of the R2 reagent leads to agglutination complexes,
formed by the interaction between latex-bound HbA1c and the corresponding antibodies.
Turbidity created by these aggregates is proportional to the amount of latex-bound HbA1c
therefore is proportional to the % of HbA1c in the total hemoglobin.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated according to CLSI-06A. The linearity of the hemoglobin A1c
system was verified using a low level (4.3%) and a high level (13%) of K2 EDTA
whole blood donor samples. The normal and high samples were intermixed to create
eleven samples. Two additional samples, 14.3% and 15.5% HbA1c, were created by
spiking in order to cover the assay range of 4-16%. The following sample
concentrations were tested;
No. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13

Conc.
All samples were analyzed using three lots of reagent cartridges. The observed %
HbA1c value was determined for each intermediate dilution and plotted versus the
relative analyte concentration obtained on the Tosoh Bioscience G8 HPLC analyzer.
The linear regression is as follows:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The URight Hemoglobin A1c Reagent Cartridge uses the Tosoh Bioscience G8 HPLC
analyzer to confirm the analyte concentrations used for calibration. The Tosoh
Hemoglobin A1c Calibrator Set is used to calibrate the Tosoh Bioscience G8 HPLC
analyzer and is produced by the Tosoh Corporation. The assigned values of Tosoh
Hemoglobin A1c Calibrator Set are traceable to the Diabetes Control and Compilation
Trial (DCCT) Reference method.
The URight Hemoglobin A1c system is certified with the National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP). The NGSP certification expires in one year. See
NGSP website for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
Value Assignment: The control value assignment is performed using two levels of
URight HbA1c control solutions, one lot of URight Hemoglobin A1c Reagent
Cartridges and one URight Hemoglobin A1c Analyzer. Each control level is run 15
times and the mean, SD and CV% is calculated and are lot specific and must meet the
sponsor’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.
Calibration:
The values for calibration curve for each reagent lot are contained within the barcode
and encoded onto the Master Calibration card. A calibration card is provided in the
reagent kit and should be used to calibrate the analyzer every time before using each
new box of reagent cartridges.
Stability:
The URight Hemoglobin A1c Reagent Cartridge can be stored at temperatures from
2°C - 8°C (35.6°F to 46.4°F) for 12 months and can be used at temperatures from 15°C
to 32°C (59°F to 89.6°F) at a relative humidity from 10% to 90%. The stability studies
were found to be acceptable and support the claimed stability and operating temperature
conditions.
The URight Hemoglobin A1c Control can be stored unopened at 2°C - 8°C for 18
months and 3 weeks at 2°C - 8°C after opening.

Please see linearity study above in M1b.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was performed according to EP7-A2 guidance to assess common
or known endogenous and exogenous substances that could interfere with the
hemoglobin A1c system. The limiting level of interference was determined by the dose
response testing results. Three lots of URight Hemoglobin A1c Reagent Cartridge and
10 URight Hemoglobin A1c Analyzers were used in the study. The potential
interferents acetaminophen, ibuprofen, glibenclamide, metformin, L-ascorbic acid and
bilirubin (unconjugated) were spiked into K2EDTA whole blood samples from
volunteers containing low level (4-6%) and high level (8-9%) of HbA1c. The %HbA1c
values of the spiked samples were compared to reference samples (sample containing
no interferent). Samples were tested once and the sponsor defined non-significant
interference as the % recovery ± 6%. If bias >6%, the substance is a potential
interferent at the tested concentration. The interferent study results are summarized in
the table below:
Non-Interfering Substances and Test Concentrations
Substance Test Concentration
Acetaminophen 20 mg/dL
Glibenclamide 0.19 mg/dL
Ibuprofen 50 mg/dL
Metformin 4 mg/dL
Triglycerides >3000 mg/dL
Bilirubin (unconjugated) 20 mg/dL
Ascorbic acid 3 mg/dL
Rheumatoid Factor 26 IU/mL
Acetylated Hb 5mmol/L
Carbamylated Hb 5mmol/L
Labile A1c study was performed using three lots of URight Hemoglobin A1c Reagent
Cartridge and 10 URight Hemoglobin A1c Analyzers and K2EDTA whole blood
samples from volunteers containing low level (4-6%) and high level (8-9%) of HbA1c.
Samples spiked with a high glucose solution (approx. 20,000 mg/dL) to a
concentration of 1400 mg/dL) were incubated for 3 hours at 37°C and control samples
prepared to ensure that the dilutions of the spiked and control samples were identical
were tested. Samples were tested in once and test samples were compared to the
control samples. The sponsor defined non-significant interference as the % recovery ±
6%. The results showed that no significant interferences (± 6%) are observed in this
study.

A hemoglobin variant study was performed using high level Hb variant samples to
include Hemoglobin C, Hemoglobin D, Hemoglobin E, Hemoglobin A2, Hemoglobin
F and Hemoglobin S. Two HbA1c concentrations (low and high) were tested for each
variant. The samples were tested in singlicate using three lots of URight Hemoglobin
A1c Reagent Cartridge and 10 URight Hemoglobin A1c Analyzers. The sponsor
defined non-significant interference as the % recovery ± 6%. The testing results
indicate there is no significant interference for HbC ≤37.4%, HbD ≤48.5%, HbE
≤21.4% and HbA2 ≤7.0%. HbF shows interference at 21.2% and HbS shows
interference at 20.3%.
The sponsor has the following limitations in the labeling:
HbF and HbS levels tested with this assay show interference and samples
containing HbF or HbS will show a lower than expected HbA1c result.

Not Applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison:
A POC method comparison study was performed with 149 (146 natural and 3 spiked)
venous whole blood samples and 146 capillary blood patient samples in three point of
care (POC) sites. Capillary blood was collected from patients and analyzed once using
the URight Hemoglobin A1c Reagent Cartridge on the URight Hemoglobin A1c
analyzer. Venous blood samples were collected from the same patients using an EDTA
collection tube and analyzed once using the URight Hemoglobin A1c Reagent
Cartridge on the URight Hemoglobin A1c analyzer and once on the Tosoh Bioscience
G8 HPLC analyzer. The range tested was 4.0 to 15.8% HbA1c. Site 1 tested 49
samples (48 natural and 1 spiked venous blood), Site 2 tested 50 samples (48 natural
and 2 spiked venous blood) and Site 3 tested 50 samples (49 natural and 1 spiked
venous blood). In the capillary blood study, Site 1 tested 49 samples, Site 2 tested 48
samples and Site 3 tested 49 samples.
The linear regression of EDTA venous whole blood and capillary blood between the
URight Hemoglobin A1c Reagent Cartridge and Tosoh G8 (the comparator in each
study) is as follows:

b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed using capillary blood, K2 EDTA venous
blood, K3 EDTA venous blood and sodium heparin venous blood. 120 total donor
samples were collected from 3 POC sites and analyzed using the URIGHT Hemoglobin
A1c Reagent Cartridge on the URight Hemoglobin A1c analyzer. 40 donor samples
were collected from site 1 using capillary fingerstick blood, K2 EDTA venous blood
and sodium heparin venous blood, 40 donor samples were collected from site 2 using
capillary fingerstick blood, K2EDTA venous blood and sodium heparin venous blood
and 40 donor samples were collected from site 3 using capillary fingerstick blood,
K3EDTA venous blood and sodium heparin venous blood. 9 venous blood samples
were spiked to 13-16% HbA1c samples. Each sample was tested once using the URight
Hemoglobin A1c Reagent Cartridge on the URight Hemoglobin A1c analyzer. Samples
tested ranged from 4.5-16% HbA1c. The linear regression analyses are as follows:

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Sample volume studies were performed using 5.2 % HbA1c K2 EDTA whole blood
samples and three lots of cartridge tested 10 times at different sample volumes (0.1, 0.15
and 0.2 uL). Test results support the sample volume claim of at least 0.15 uL.
Altitude studies were performed using a glove box system which simulates different
altitude conditions with varying atmospheric pressure and pO2 in blood. The HbA1c level
tested ranged from 4.3 -15.5%. The altitude study protocol and results were reviewed and
found to be acceptable to support an operating altitude claim of up to 2000 meters (6000
feet).
