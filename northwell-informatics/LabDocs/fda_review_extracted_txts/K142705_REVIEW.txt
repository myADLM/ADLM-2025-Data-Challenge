L. Test Principle:
The LeadCare® PlusTM Blood Lead Testing System is an in vitro diagnostic device that relies
on electrochemistry (Anodic Stripping Voltammetry or ASV) with a sensor to detect lead in
whole blood. When a sample of whole blood is mixed with Treatment Reagent (a dilute
solution of hydrochloric acid), the red blood cells are lysed and the lead becomes available
for electrochemical detection. When a test is run, the analyzer applies an electrical potential
that causes the lead to collect on the Sensor. The analyzer measures the amount of lead on the
Sensor and displays the result in micrograms per deciliter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The LeadCare® PlusTM precision was demonstrated using bovine blood standards
at lead concentrations of 3.1, 5.1, 11.7, 24.7 and 45.4 µg/dL. An additional human
blood sample at a lead concentration of 59.1 µg/dL was also included to challenge
the high end of the range. Eighty (80) data points were collected per concentration
level over a 20 day period using two Sensor/Reagent Lot Pairs. The combined
data set is shown:
Mean, WR* SD, Total SD, WR Total
µg/dL µg/dL µg/dL CV CV
3.1 0.44 0.49 14.1% 15.6%
5.1 0.44 0.50 8.5% 9.6%
11.7 0.64 0.71 5.3% 6.0%
24.7 0.80 1.00 3.2% 4.0%
45.4 1.61 1.71 3.5% 3.7%
59.1 1.89 2.42 3.2% 4.0%
WR = within run
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearityassessments wereperformed on two Sensor/Reagent Lot Pairs using nine
human donor blood samples, spiked with lead to concentrations of 0-2 µg/dL, 2-5
µg/dL, 5-10µg/dL, 15-25 µg/dL, 25-35µg/dL, 35-45 µg/dL, 45-55 µg/dL, 55-65, 65-
70 µg/dL. One whole blood sample, unadulterated in K EDTA vacutainers, was also
2
included.

R = 0.998 R = 0.997
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed reportablerange of 1.9–65
µg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The LeadCare® PlusTM system is traceable to the NIST Standard
Reference Material 955c analyzed on Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption
Spectrometer (GFAAS).
Test Kit Stability: Protocols and acceptance criteria were previously reviewed and
found to be acceptable (k123563) for the test kit. The sponsor’s stability claims are
for 18 months when stored at 59°F to 80°F (15°C - 27°C). The labeling instructs the
user not to freeze or refrigerate the reagent. The sensors should be kept sealed until
the sample is prepared and the treatment reagent should be used immediately after
opening the tube.
Control Solutions: Two levels of Quality Controls material are provided with the test
kit, Level 1 and Level 2. Theses control solutions were previously cleared k063398.
The labeling instructs the user to store the control solutions at: 15ºC - 27ºC (59ºF -
80ºF) and not to refrigerate.
Sample stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to
acceptable to support the claims in the labeling that samples collected in micro-
capillary K2EDTA tubes can be stored for up to 72 hours (3 days) from collection at
33°F - 77°F (1°C - 25°C) prior to being mixed with treatment reagent.
d. Detection limit:
The Limits of Blank, Detection and Quantification were established using the Total
Error Analysis Method and by following the CLSI EP17-A2 guidelines.
The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by running 60 replicates of near blank
bovine blood samples, over 5 days. Samples were analyzed using two
Sensor/Reagent Lot Pairs. The average LoB was calculated to be 0.98 µg/dL.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification (LoQ) were determined by
running 60 replicates of 10 different whole blood samples, collected in K EDTA
2
vacutainers. The replicates were run, using two Sensor/Reagent Lot Pairs on
5

--- Page 6 ---
LeadCare Plus analyzers over five days. The average LoD was calculated to be 1.2
µg/dL.
The Limit of Quantification LoQ was calculated using the Total Error equation:
Total Error LoQ = absolute (Bias) + (2 x SD)
The average LoQ was calculated to be 1.6 µg/dL.
The Total Error at the LoQ was 18%.
Obtained LoB, LoD, and LoQ values for the LeadCare® PlusTM differ slightly from
those obtained for the predicate, LeadCare Ultra® (See k123563). For product family
consistency between LeadCare® PlusTM and LeadCare Ultra®, the claimed values for
LoB, LoD and LoQ of the LeadCare® PlusTM are provided in the table below and are
identical to the values obtained for the LeadCare Ultra®:
LeadCare® PlusTM
LoB 1.5 µg/dL
LoD 1.9 µg/dL
LoQ 1.9 µg/dL
e. Analytical specificity:
The assay reagents and controls are unchanged from the predicate, therefore please
refer to k123563where analytical specificity was established.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was conducted at one site with two Sensor/Reagent Lot
Pairs, two labs, two users and two stations of six LeadCare Plus analyzers. To assess
system accuracy 169whole blood samples collected in K EDTA Vacutainers with
2
lead concentrations within the claimed analytical range of 1.9 -65 µg/dL were run on
the LeadCare® PlusTM system and the results were compared to the reference
method, Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (GFAAS). The
LeadCare® PlusTM results from each sample were compared to the average of two
GFAAS results. The linear regression results are as follows:
y = 1.029x-0.98, R2 = 0.994
b. Matrix comparison:

[Table 1 on page 6]
	LeadCare® PlusTM
LoB	1.5 µg/dL
LoD	1.9 µg/dL
LoQ	1.9 µg/dL

--- Page 7 ---
A total of 50micro-capillary tubes with K EDTA fingerstick samples were spiked
2
with lead to achieve concentrations of 1.9-63.1μg/dL lead as measured by GFAAS.
Samples tested included unaltered native patient samples and spiked samples. These
samples were analyzed on the LeadCare® PlusTM system and compared to values
obtained from GFAAS. The linear regression results are as follows:
y= 1.018X – 0.023; R2 = 0.983
The assay reagents and controls are unchanged from the predicate, therefore please
refer to k123563 for matrix comparison information for EDTA Vacutainer and
Heparin Vacutainer samples.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Thecurrent labeling includes the following:
In 2012, based on the increased body of evidence demonstrating there is no safe level of
lead in the blood, experts established a new reference value to identify children who
have elevated blood lead levels (BLL). According to the Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) website, this level is based on the U.S. population of children ages 1-5 years who
are in the top 2.5% of children when tested for lead in their blood (when compared to
children who are exposed to more lead than most children). Currently this reference value
is 5 μg/dL, a change from the previously utilized “level of concern” set at 10 μg/dL.*

Recommendations in “Low Level Lead Exposure Harms Children: A Renewed Call of
Primary Prevention.” June 7, 2012.

5. Calibration:
8

--- Page 9 ---
Calibration is done using the calibration button which is supplied in each test kit. The
calibration button is specific for the test kit in which it is supplied. It is used to download
all calibration information, analytical test parameters, and expiration date code
information for the sensor lot supplied within the test kit. This lot specific calibration
button is held against the calibration reader on the analyzer to calibrate the analyzerfor
use with a particular test kit. The labeling states that the analyzer must be calibrated for
each test kit lot and instructs the user to make sure the calibration code on the calibration
button matches the lot number on the sensor container and on the controls.
6. Quality Control:
Two levels of liquid Quality Controls (Level 1 and Level2) are supplied with the Test
Kit. The labeling states that controls should be tested, at a minimum, as follows: eachday
or shift before patient samples are tested.
