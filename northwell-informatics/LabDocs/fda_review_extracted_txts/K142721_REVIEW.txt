H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The cobas® MRSA/SA Test on the cobas® 4800 system, is a qualitative in vitro
diagnostic real-time PCR assay, for the direct detection of methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and S. aureus (SA) DNA from nasal swabs to aid in the
prevention and control of MRSA and SA infections in healthcare settings. The cobas®
MRSA/SA Test is not intended to diagnose, guide or monitor treatment for MRSA or SA
infections, or provide results of susceptibility to methicillin. A negative result does not
preclude MRSA/SA nasal colonization. Concomitant cultures are necessary to recover
organisms for epidemiology typing or for further susceptibility testing.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as the intended use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
cobas® 4800 System
I. Device Description:
The cobas® 4800 System uses the cobas x 480 Instrument for sample preparation, and the
cobas z 480 Analyzer for amplification and detection. Both the cobas x 480 Instrument and
the cobas z 480 Analyzer are controlled by a computer workstation running the cobas® 4800
System Software.
The Roche Molecular Systems (RMS) cobas® MRSA/SA Test utilizes real-time polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) and Staphylococcus aureus (SA) DNA from nasal swab specimens collected in
MSwab medium to aid in the prevention and control of MRSA and SA infections in
healthcare settings.

--- Page 3 ---
The cobas® MRSA/SA Test contains two major processes: (1) automated sample preparation
to extract nucleic acids from the nasal swab specimens; (2) PCR amplification of target DNA
sequences using MRSA and SA specific primers, and real-time detection of cleaved
fluorescent-labeled MRSA and SA specific oligonucleotide detection probes. An Internal
Control (IC), containing unrelated randomized DNA sequence, is added to all samples prior
to automated sample preparation and is amplified and detected simultaneously with each
sample to monitor the entire process.
The MSwab Collection, Transport and Preservation System (Copan Flock Technologies
S.r.l.) is used for specimen collection, transportation and storage of specimen for the cobas®
MRSA/SA Test.
The cobas® MRSA/SA Test utilizes six reagent kits:
1. cobas® 4800 MRSA/SA Amplification/Detection Kit
2. cobas® 4800 MRSA/SA Controls and Cofactor Kit
3. cobas® 4800 System Wash Buffer Kit

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff. Establishing the
Performance Characteristics of Nucleic Acid-Based In Vitro Diagnostic Devices for the
Detection and Differentiation of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and
Staphylococcus aureus (SA). Document issued on June 15, 2011.
L. Test Principle:
Sample preparation for the cobas® MRSA/SA Test is automated with the use of the cobas x
480 instrument. Organisms in nasal swab specimens collected in MSwab medium are lysed
with chaotropic agent, proteinase K, and SDS reagents. Released nucleic acids, along with
added Internal Control DNA, are bound by magnetic glass particles. They are washed and
then eluted into a small volume of buffer. The instrument then takes an aliquot of the eluted
material and sets up the PCR reaction with an activated Master Mix.
Target Selection
The well-characterized Right Extremity (RE) junction between the Staphylococcus aureus
orfX gene and SCCmec cassette carrying the mecA drug-resistant gene was chosen to be the
target to specifically detect MRSA. The capsular polysaccharide enzyme CAP5N (CPE) gene
was chosen as the target for Staphylococcus aureus identification. This gene is conserved in
Staphylococcus aureus and present in both methicillin resistant and methicillin sensitive
organisms. Internal Control (IC) DNA sequence is unique and unrelated to either MRSA or
SA target sequences.
Target Amplification and Detection
The PCR cycling steps and detection of target signal occurs in the cobas z 480 Analyzer. The
Master Mix reagent contains primer pairs and probes for orfX (MRSA), CPE (SA) and IC
targets. If the target nucleic acid sequences are present, amplification with the corresponding
primers will occur by a thermostable DNA polymerase, generating PCR products
(amplicons). These products are detected by specific TaqMan probes containing a fluorescent
dye and a quencher. Normally, the quencher suppresses the fluorescence of the dye.

However, if the PCR product is present, the probe hybridizes to the product and gets cleaved
by the 5’ to 3’ nuclease activity of the polymerase. This reaction allows the fluorescence to
be emitted from the dye, and the signal is recorded in real time during each PCR cycle by the
cobas z 480 analyzer. The signal is interpreted by the cobas® 4800 System Software and
reported as final results.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision Study
Within-laboratory precision was evaluated for the cobas® MRSA/SA Test at one (1)
site with four (4) panel members:
1) Negative,
2) High Negative (HN), < 1.0 x LoD,
3) Low Positive (LP), 1 x LoD and
4) Moderate Positive (MP), 3.0 x LoD.
The study was conducted over twelve (12) days using three (3) reagent lots of two (2)
kit sizes on three (3) cobas® 4800 systems. Each run contained two (2) replicates of
each of the panel members (12 days x 3 lots x 2 replicates = 72 replicates/panel
member/strain).
The results for the study are summarized in Table I, below. The upper limit of the 2-
sided exact binomial 95% confidence interval (CI) of the detection for panel members
at or near the limit of detection was 100% for MRSA and SA culture isolates. Positive
rates for all other panel members were as expected.

The overall coefficient of variation (CV%) of the C values for cobas® MRSA/SA
t
Test was less than or equal to 1.3% indicating good reproducibility. C value
t
variability of the cobas® MRSA/SA Test is mostly attributed to random factors with
contributions of reagent lot, kit size, run/day and instrument/operator being
substantially (several-fold) lower or negligible across the detected targets.
The precision study results met the pre-defined acceptance criteria for LP, MP, and
HN samples. The cobas® MRSA/SA Test reproducibly detected both targets at
concentrations around and above the LOD of the test. Reproducibility has been
demonstrated across multiple runs/days, reagent lots, kit sizes and
instruments/operators.
The results of this study are acceptable and these results are described in labeling.
Reproducibility Study
The reproducibility of the cobas® MRSA/SA Test on the cobas 4800 System was
established in a multi-center study. The same strains and panel members were tested
as listed in the precision study above (Table I). Panels were tested at three (3) sites by
two (2) operators per site with one (1) run per operator per day, for five (5) days per
lot, over two (2) lots for a total of one-thousand eight hundred (1,800) tests (180
tests/panel member or 90 tests/panel member/lot). Overall, sixty (60) runs were
performed per site, per condition and all were valid runs. There were no failed/invalid
tests.
The MRSA/SA reproducibility test panels were prepared by seeding MRSA strains
NRS384 (MRSA-384) and ATCC 43300 (MRSA-43300), or SA strain RMSCC
10851 into contrived sample matrix (simulated clinical MSwab nasal specimens with
mucin and human epithelial cells) at 1 of 3 concentrations (<1 x LoD, 1 × LoD, and 3
× LoD); a MRSA/SA-negative panel member was included as a panel member
control. In all, there were 10 members per test panel with 3 replicates per panel
member included in each run. The results of the reproducibility study are summarized
in Table II below.

external Positive and Negative Controls listed below.
One set of cobas® MRSA/SA Test Positive and Negative Controls are included in
each run. For any run, valid results must be obtained for both the Positive and
Negative Control for the cobas® 4800 Software to display the reportable cobas®
MRSA/SA Test results from that run.
Positive Control
The MRSA (+) Control which is provided with this assay contains non-infectious
DNA plasmids of both MRSA and Staphylococcus aureus. The MRSA/SA (+)
Control monitors the nucleic acid amplification, and detection steps in a given run
of the test. The MRSA/SA positive control result must be ‘Valid’.
Negative Control
The negative control, which is provided with this assay, contains Poly rA RNA.
The negative control result must be ‘Valid’.
During the clinical study, the positive and negative external control isolates were
tested each day of testing. All MRSA/SA positive controls were detected accurately
(100%, 116/116). All negative controls were detected accurately (100%, 116/116).
Kit stability:
Many components of assay stability were previously assessed during previous
submissions for the cobas HSV 1 and 2, C. diff and CT/NG tests, as components of
the kit are identical.
Three production lots of new reagent components of the kits required for cobas®
MRSA/SA testing were entered into the stability program to establish shelf life. The
expiration date for each test kit was defined by the shortest dated component in that
kit. These reagents include cobas® MRSA/SA Test specific reagent kits: the cobas®
MRSA/SA Amplification/Detection Kit, the cobas® MRSA/SA Controls & Cofactor
Kit; and the cobas® 4800 IC Kit 1, and Lysis Buffer 1 from the cobas® 4800 System
Lysis Kit 1. Stability testing of the MRSA/SA specific reagents was carried out using
the cobas® MRSA/SA Test. Stability of the cobas® 4800 IC Kit 1 was carried out
using cobas® MRSA/SA Test, and stability of Lysis Buffer 1 was assessed using
chemical/analytical tests.
The stability of these existing generic reagents demonstrated stability from 0-25
months in real-time experiments with the exception of Lysis Buffer-1, as was
previously established. To date, the 2-8 ºC storage real time testing stability results
for three (3) lots of cobas® 4800 System Lysis Buffer-1 supports a shelf life of fifteen
(15) months. Testing will continue, and the initial dating will be extended when data
becomes available. Accelerated stability (25 ºC storage) testing results predicts a shelf
life of at least 19 months for cobas® 4800 System Lysis Buffer-1 at the storage
temperature of 2-8ºC.

Specimen stability:
The study was performed to determine the stability of MRSA and SA nasal swab
specimens in MSwab medium (Copan MSwab™ Collection, Preservation and
Transport System) after storage under various storage conditions for use with the
cobas® MRSA/SA Test.
A total of twenty-six (26) nasal swab specimens (12 MRSA, 10 SA, 2 MRSA/SA and
2 negative) were included in the stability testing. Of these twenty-six (26) samples,
six (6) MRSA positive, six (6) SA positive and two (2) MRSA/SA negative samples
were prepared by pooling clinical specimens to create enough volume to test at all
scheduled time-points. The remaining samples were prepared by spiking MRSA
culture isolates (10364 or 8065) and/or SA culture isolate (10851) at 3 x LoD into
negative clinical specimen pool.
All positive and negative specimens generated positive and negative results,
respectively, at all time-points of up to 40 days of cumulative storage.
The results indicated that nasal clinical specimens collected in Mswab medium were
stable for:
1. up to 2 days at room temperature (15-30 °C) followed by 5 days stored at 2-8 °C;
2. up to 4 days at room temperature (15-30 °C) followed by 5 days stored at 2-8 °C
followed by 1 month frozen at -20 °C before testing with the cobas® MRSA/SA Test.
There is at least a two (2) hour interval from the completion of sample preparation
and amplification/detection plate setup to the start of amplification/detection on the
cobas® z480 Analyzer for the cobas® MRSA/SA Test.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) of the cobas® MRSA/SA Test was determined using
contrived stocks of one Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and two methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains per CLSI guideline EP17-A2.
The titer of each culture isolates was determined by counting colonies from plates of
serial dilutions. Each of the culture isolates was diluted in collection and transport
medium, then spiked into a flocked swab, which was then immersed in simulated
nasal swab matrix to produce a panel consisting of nine (9) concentration levels and
one (1) negative level (simulated matrix only). The swab type and medium used for
these assays are components of the Copan MSwab Collection, Transport and
Preservation System designated in the labeling for use with the cobas® MRSA/SA
Test.
Three lots of reagents and two different batch sizes were used for this study. For each
reagent lot, a minimum of three independent panel dilutions were prepared. A
minimum of 19 valid replicates per testing level were generated from multiple
10

--- Page 11 ---
instruments and runs for each reagent lot, yielding a minimum of 61 valid replicates
for each testing level with all three lots of reagents.
The LoD of the cobas® MRSA/SA Test is the concentration where at least 95%
observed positive rate for which all higher concentrations had an observed positive
rate above 95%. The LoD study results are shown in Table III below.

These study results are acceptable and they are described in labeling.
e. Analytical reactivity:
The analytical inclusivity of the cobas® MRSA/SA Test was determined for 35
additional MRSA culture isolates and 5 additional SA culture isolates. The panel
included a variety of strains, taking into account geographic origin, SCCmec type, RE
type, SPA type, and Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) type. The panels of at
least three concentrations per isolate were used to determine the LoD for each strain
in simulated nasal swab matrix. The LoD was calculated as the lowest concentration
level with ≥ 95 % positive rate for which all higher concentration levels show ≥ 95 %
positive rate.
For the five (5) SA isolates (Table IV) and thirty-five (35) MRSA isolates (Table V)
tested the LoDs range from 1.30 x 105 and 1.23 x 106 CFU/ml. The cobas MRSA/SA
Test detected the right extremity (RE) types 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 11, 14, 24 and 25. The
cobas® MRSA/SA Test detected MRSA staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec
(SCCmec) types I, II, III, IV, V, VI and VIII, as well as MRSA pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE) types USA 100 to 1000.

eighty-one (281) MRSA isolates, two hundred seventy-seven (277, 98.6%) of the
MRSA isolates were detected. Sequencing results suggest that the target regions for
the four (4) MRSA isolates not detected by the cobas® MRSA/SA Test contained
sequences not recognized by the primers and probes in the assay. One of the four
isolates was a mecA strain (also known as mecC). All other results were as
LGA251
expected.
These study results are acceptable and they are described in labeling.
f. Analytical specificity:
Microbial cross-reactivity and interference:
The cobas® MRSA/SA Test was examined for analytical specificity by testing non-
MRSA/SA microorganisms, including coagulase-negative (CoNS) and methicillin-
resistant CoNS (MR-CoNS) in negative nasal matrix in the presence or absence of
MRSA and SA targets.
Organisms were spiked at high concentration into the simulated nasal swab matrix,
without (cross-reactivity) or with the targets (interference) at approximately 3 x LoD.
All bacteria and fungi were tested at 1.00 x 106 CFU/ml. All viruses except for
Adenovirus type 1 (1.00 x 104 PFU/ml) were tested at 1.00 x 105 PFU/ml. The same
two MRSA and one SA isolates used in the LoD study were used. The list of strains
used for the cross-reactivity and microbial interference studies is listed below in
Tables VI and VII.

These study results are acceptable and these results are described in labeling.
Co-infection Studies:
To test for competitive interference with the MRSA target, SA organisms including
borderline oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (BORSA) strains and empty cassette variants
(mecA drop-outs) were tested at high concentration to examine any cross-reactivity
and/or interference with MRSA detection at 3 x LoD using the two (2) MRSA strains
used in the LoD study. Both MRSA strains were correctly identified in every case.
Ten (10) BORSA strains and sixteen (16) empty-cassette (mecA drop out) MRSA
strains were also tested in the absence of MRSA. The cobas®MRSA/SA test correctly
detected 2/2 MSSA, 10/10 BORSA and 13/16 mecA drop out isolates as positive for
SA and negative for MRSA. Three (3) of the mecA drop out isolates were detected as
positive for SA and MRSA. The risk of incorrect identification of MRSA from mecA
drop-outs is mitigated in the labeling by requiring follow-up testing for results
indicating the presence of MRSA. A limitation is also included in labeling indicating
that false positive MRSA result may occur if an “empty cassette variant”
Staphylococcus aureus is present.
Additionally, two (2) methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and two (2) methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) isolates were spiked at increasing
concentrations to determine if there is any competitive inhibition effect on the
detection of the MRSA and SA targets (SA strains were tested against MRSA targets
only). In the presence of increasing concentration of SA or MRSE, low positive
MRSA targets were consistently detected as positive. This demonstrates that there is
no competitive inhibition by these organisms.
In consideration of microbial specificity overall, none of the 135 closely related
Staphylococcus species or microorganisms commonly found in the nasal flora at
tested levels yielded false positive or false negative results. The cobas® MRSA/SA
Test detected all 10 BORSA isolates, 13 of 16 empty cassette variants and 2 SA
isolates correctly as SA only. Increasing concentration of MSSA did not compete
with the detection of low level MRSA targets and increasing concentrations of MRSE
did not compete with the detection of MRSA and SA targets.
g. Interfering substances:
Twenty-seven (27) substances (Table VIII) that may potentially be present in the
sampling area including human whole blood, mucin, nasal sprays, medications or
moisturizers were evaluated in this study.

For blood and mucin, three levels of each interferent were spiked into samples
constructed with a simulated nasal swab matrix at 3 x LoD for reach strain used in the
LoD studies. Interferents were added into the samples in the amounts corresponding
to a percentage of volume/volume (v/v) or weight/volume (w/v) based on the
maximum capacity of the flocked swab used with the cobas® MRSA/SA Test.
Ten (10) replicates were prepared this way for each interferent at each level, for each
of the three (3) strains. Samples with interferents but no targets were also tested. At
100% v/v whole blood level and at 20% w/v mucin level, false negative results were
observed for target positive samples, as listed in Table VI below.
For exogenous substance testing, substances were tested in concentrations specified
per the manufacturer’s labeling. Each product was spiked into simulated nasal swab
matrix and tested in the absence or presence of MRSA and SA targets used in the
LoD studies at approximately 3 x LoD. Each substance was introduced in the

was tested at the maximum prescription dosage. For substances that interfered with
the cobas® MRSA/SA Test at initial testing concentration, lower concentrations were
tested to identify the level that is tolerated by the test. Each condition was tested in
triplicate.
The performance of the cobas® MRSA/SA Test was not affected by 23 out of 25
exogenous substances tested. Rhinaris® Nasal gel and ReleevTM interfered with the
performance of the cobas® MRSA/SA Test when present in the amounts above 15%
(Rhinaris® Nasal gel) and above 25% (ReleevTM) of the swab capacity.

These study results are acceptable. A limitation is included in labeling indicating that
false negative or invalid results may occur due to interference from these various
substances.
h. Carry-Over:
A cross-contamination study was conducted for the cobas® MRSA/SA Test. MRSA
and negative samples were processed in a checkerboard configuration on the cobas®
4800 system. High titer samples were prepared by spiking MRSA culture to
simulated nasal swab matrix to generate a cycle threshold (C) that exceeded 95% of
t
signal from specimens of infected patients of the clinical specimen population.
Five (5) runs were performed on each of the three (3) cobas® 4800 systems (3
instruments x 5 runs = 15 runs total). The first run on each system contained only the
negative samples to confirm the instrument was clean. The three (3) subsequent runs
on each system had alternating positive and negative samples in checkerboard
configurations to assess the cross contamination rate (3 instruments x 3 checkerboard
runs = 9 checkerboard runs total). The last run on each system contained only the
negative samples to assess the carry-over contamination rate.
There were no cross-contamination events in any of the nine checkerboard runs
across three cobas® 4800 systems (a total of 423 MRSA negative samples) for an
observed cross-contamination rate of 0%. All results in the last three (3) runs
containing only the negative samples were negative, suggesting that there was no
carry-over run-to-run contamination.

i. Assay cut-off:
The C cut-off values for the cobas® MRSA/SA Test was determined to achieve the
t
balanced performance against the established reference culture method. The initial C
t
cut-off values were determined using 533 nasal swab samples collected at two sites in
the United States for a pre-clinical feasibility study. These samples were tested on the
cobas®4800 System using two lots of reagents. Direct and enrichment MRSA and SA
culture procedures were also conducted on these specimens. Final combined direct
and enrichment culture results were designated as reference culture results.
The initial cut-off values were further evaluated in an interim analysis of the United
States clinical utility study data with first 1,643 subject results. The results of this
analysis and final cut-off values are listed in Table X below.

All analytical studies were conducted in a simulated negative matrix. A comparison
study was conducted between negative clinical matrix and a contrived negative
matrix in order to validate the use of the contrived negative matrix in place of a
clinical negative matrix for the analytical studies in section M1 above. Contrived
negative matrix was constructed to mimic challenging clinical specimens, consisting
of mucin, human cells and an isotonic (MSwab) media.
The performance results of the simulated matrix compared to the natural nasal swab
specimen was demonstrated using two different MRSA isolates spiked into each
matrix at 1 x LoD. The C values between the two matrices demonstrate that the
t
simulated matrix is comparable to a natural specimen. All specimens were detected
(100%). The results of this matrix comparison study are listed in Table XI below.

3. Clinical studies:
This was a prospective multi-site study to evaluate the performance of the cobas®
MRSA/SA Test compared with direct culture and enrichment culture in the screening of
patients for nasal colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
and Staphylococcus aureus (SA). Six (6) collection sites participated in this study and
three (3) sites performed testing with the cobas® MRSA/SA Test. Reference testing using
direct and enrichment culture was performed at a central reference laboratory that
specializes in culture and molecular detection of MRSA and SA.
Swabs were collected from patients that met the inclusion criteria. Each subject had one
(1) Standard-of-Care (SOC) swab collected, for SOC testing if applicable, and one (1)
study swab collected using the Copan MSwab Collection, Transport and Preservation
System. The study swab was processed using the cobas® MRSA/SA Test and used for
direct and enrichment culture as the reference method.
On the day of collection, the swab was expressed into MSwab media and discarded. An
aliquot of the eluted specimen was transported to a reference laboratory at 2-8o C to be
cultured within 48 hours of collection. The remainder of the swab-expressed media in the
MSwab tube is tested with the cobas® MRSA/SA Test.

At the reference laboratory, the aliquoted swab-expressed media was divided into three
(3) even fractions. Two fractions are applied to HardyCHROM™ MRSA,
HhardyCHROM™ Staph aureus for direct culture. If growth was observed within twenty-
four (24) hours, presumptive colonies were subcultured onto blood agar. Confirmed
colonies are reported as MRSA or SA, as appropriate. The third fraction was incubated in
tryptic soy broth (TSB) with 6.5% w/v sodium chloride for up to fourty-eight (48) hours,
subcultured on blood agar then confirmed if direct culture results did not detect MRSA.
Presumptive MRSA isolates from the MRSA plate were confirmed using the cefoxitin
disk screening test for methicillin resistance.
Clinical performance was based on comparison of the cobas® MRSA/SA Test results to
those obtained by a composite culture of directly plated patients’ nasal swabs and culture
of the transport fluid material at a central location.
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Of the two thousand five hundred twenty-eight (2528) specimens collected (1
specimen collected/enrolled patient) in the clinical study, twelve (12) were excluded
due to inclusion/exclusion criteria, withdrawal or consent errors. Twelve (12) were
non-evaluable due to errors in sample handling or invalid cobas® MRSA/SA Test
results. During culture enrichment, four (4) cultures were confounded due to Proteus
overgrowth, excluding them from evaluation for enrichment. One of the four was
positive for SA from direct culture evaluation.
Table XII below shows the comparison of the cobas® MRSA/SA Test with
combined direct and enrichment culture results for the 2,500 evaluable specimens for
MRSA and 2,501 evaluable specimens for SA. MRSA sensitivity and specificity
relative to combined direct and enrichment culture were 93.1% and 97.5%,
respectively. The overall PPV and NPV of the cobas® MRSA/SA Test for MRSA
were 71.6% and 99.5%, respectively. Similarly, SA sensitivity and specificity
relative to combined direct and enrichment culture were 93.9% and 94.2%,
respectively. The overall PPV and NPV of the cobas® MRSA/SA Test for SA were
85.3% and 97.7%, respectively. Across test sites, MRSA sensitivity and specificity
ranged from 91.4% to 94.5% and from 97.0% to 97.9%, respectively. The
corresponding ranges for SA were from 91.6% to 96.1% and from 92.9% to 95.4%.
