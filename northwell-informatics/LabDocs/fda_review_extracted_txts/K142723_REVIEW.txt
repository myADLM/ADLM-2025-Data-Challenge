L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA Centaur Cortisol assay is a competitive immunoassay using direct
chemiluminescent technology. Cortisol in the patient sample competes with acridinium ester
labeled cortisol in the Lite Reagent for binding to polyclonal rabbit anti-cortisol antibody in
the Solid Phase. The polyclonal rabbit anti-cortisol antibody is bound to monoclonal mouse
anti-rabbit antibody, which is covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles in the Solid
Phase. An inverse relationship exists between the amount of cortisol present in the patient
sample and the amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the instrument.
Either serum sample or urine sample (24 hours collection) could be used with the assay. For
the urine sample, user can select either the direct urine configuration or the extracted urine
configuration. The urinary cortisol extraction procedure utilizes the extraction of free
cortisol from the urine sample with methylene chloride before measurement of the sample on
the instrument. The extraction procedure is provided in the labeling.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
All studies were performed on the ADVIA Centaur XP analyzer.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A 20-day precision study was performed according to CLSI EP5-A2. The samples
consisted of controls, serum, and urine pools (direct and extracted). Each sample was
tested in 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 20 days for a total of 80 replicates.
Results from a representative lot are presented below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity of the ADVIA Centaur Cortisol assay was assessed according to EP06-A by
evaluating equally spaced serum, and urine (direct and extracted) dilutions across the
assay claimed measuring range. Nine (9) serum samples and 10 urine samples with
cortisol concentrations ranging from approximately 0.5–79.5 μg/dL were tested.
Samples were prepared by diluting the high sample (79.5μg/dL) to 87.5%, 75%,
62.5%, 50%, 37.5%, 25% and 12.5% with the low sample (0.5μg/dL) or
reconstitution buffer. The samples were assayed in triplicate and the mean of the
results was used for the analysis. Expected values were calculated from gravimetric
concentration of both high and low samples. .Linear regression results:
Serum: y=1.057x - 0.051, r2 = 0.9991.
Direct Urine: y=1.011x+0.090, r2 = 0.9975.
Extracted Urine: y=0.914x +0.017, r2 = 0.9997.
The linearity study results support the sponsor’s claimed measuring range of the
following:
Serum: 0.50–75 μg/dL
Urine (direct and extracted): 0.50–53 μg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ADVIA Centaur Cortisol assay is standardized using internal standards
manufactured analytically which are traceable to gas chromatography-mass

spectroscopy (GCMS). Assigned values for calibrators are traceable to this
standardization.
Controls: Siemens recommends the use of any commercially available quality control
materials with at least two levels (low and high).
The ADVIA Centaur Cortisol assay uses the Siemens ADVIA Centaur Calibrator E,
which is cleared under k932955. Calibrator E consists of two level calibrators (Low
and High), supplied separately. Values of these 2 levels of calibrators were
established in 6 runs on 2 reagent lots for a total of 12 runs (using a minimum of 3
ADVIA Centaur instruments) x 6 reps per calibrator for a total of 72 replicates. The
calibrator values were calculated as the overall mean of the value assignment runs
read off the full standard curve. Level 1 is ~ 3 μg/dL and Level II is ~ 40 μg/dL.
Shelf-Life and Open Vial Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for the
reagents were described and found to be adequate.
d. Detection limit:
The determinations of the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit
of Quantitation (LoQ) were performed according to CLSI guideline EP17-A2.
Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined as the 95th percentile of measurement of 6
blank samples with 5 replicates per day over 3 days (n=90). The LoB for the serum
matrix of the ADVIA Centaur Cortisol assay is 0.06 μg/dL. The LoB values for direct
and extracted urine are 0.19 μg/dL and 0.18 μg/dL.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) is the smallest amount that the assay can reliably detect
to determine presence or absence of an analyte. The LoD was determined using five
low cortisol serum samples tested over 3 days, 5 replicates per day (n=75). The LoD
for the ADVIA Centaur Cortisol assay is 0.14 μg/dL for serum, 0.45 μg/dL for direct
and 0.44 μg/dL for extracted urine.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined from the precision profile. Sponsor
defined the LoQ as the concentration of the analyte having an observed within
laboratory CV of 20% and not less than the LoD. Six samples with GCMS assigned
doses were tested over 3 days, in 5 replicates (n=60). The LoQ for the ADVIA
Centaur Cortisol assay is 0.31 μg/dL for serum, and 0.48 μg/dL for direct urine and
0.44 μg/dL for extracted urine.
The measuring ranges of the ADVIA Cortisol assay are: Serum: 0.50–75 μg/dL,
Urine (direct and extracted): 0.50–53 μg/dL

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference Study:
Interfering substances were tested using serum and direct urine sample pools. The
extracted urine samples were not tested in these studies because methylene chloride
used in extraction steps removes potential interferents and direct urine is
representative of urine matrix. Each potential interfering substance was tested at
least 2 different concentrations and was spiked into 2 sample pools at 5 μg/dL and 30
μg/dL of cortisol. The same sample pools with no interferents were used as controls.
All samples were run in triplicate on an ADVIA Centaur XP with one reagent lot.
Sponsor defined non-significant interference as ≤10% difference between the spiked
and unspiked samples. Results are summarized below.

specimens with Cortisol levels of approximately 6 μg/dL. The spiked and unspiked
samples were tested in triplicate. The cross-reactivity results are summarized in the

The following limitations are provided in the labeling:
· Circulating cortisol results from patients receiving Prednisolone or Prednisone
(which is converted to Prednisolone in vivo) therapy may be falsely elevated.
Exercise caution with cortisol determinations for patients undergoing therapy with
these and structurally related synthetic corticosteroids.
· Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with reagent immunoglobulins,
interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely exposed to animals or to
animal serum products can be prone to this interference and anomalous values may be
observed. Additional information may be required for diagnosis.
· The performance of the ADVIA Centaur systems Cortisol assay has not been
established with neonatal specimens.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
A reference interval study was performed according to CLSI EP28-A3c using the
ADVIA Centaur COR assay on 252 serum samples from apparently healthy male and
female individuals. Based on a central 95% interval, the following reference intervals
were established:

N=125; PM Serum (3–9 PM); Reference Interval: 3.44–16.76 (μg/dL)
Reference intervals for 24 hour direct urine and extracted urine, previously established
with the predicate device (ADVIA Centaur Cortisol assay), were verified using 20
apparently healthy subjects according to the CLSI EP28-A3c criteria of transferability.
Sponsor’s reference range for the direct urine and extracted urine are as follows:
Direct Urine: N=105; 20.9–292.3 μg/24 hr
Extracted Urine: N = 105; 9.5–136.2 μg/24 hr
Sponsor stated the following in the labeling: “As with all diagnostic assays, each
laboratory should determine its own reference range(s) for the diagnostic evaluation of
patient results.
