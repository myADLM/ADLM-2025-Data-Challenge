I. Device Description:
The artus HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx Kit is an in vitro PCR assay for the qualitative detection
and differentiation of nucleic acids encoding the Glycoprotein D and UL30 genes isolated
from HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA present in genital or oral lesions from male and female
patients. Samples are extracted and prepared for PCR using the QIAsymphony SP/AS
instrument with the QIAsymphony DSP Virus/Pathogen Mini Kit. Amplification and
detection are carried out using the artus HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx Kit with the Rotor-Gene Q
MDx (RGQ MDx) and Rotor-Gene AssayManager software. The presence of a HSV-1 or
HSV-2 target sequence is indicated by the fluorescent signal generated through the use of
fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes. The probes do not generate a signal unless they
are specifically bound to the amplified product. The amplification cycle at which fluorescent
signal is detected by the RGQ MDx is inversely proportional to the HSV-1 and/or HSV-2
target concentration present in the original specimen. A plasmid construct containing DNA
2

--- Page 3 ---
unrelated to HSV-1 and HSV‑2 is introduced into each specimen during sample preparation
to serve as an internal control. Run as a separate control, the positive control serves to
demonstrate that the HSV-1/2 PCR reagents are functional. In addition, the positive control
functions as a process control, to demonstrate that sample preparation has proceeded
correctly during the run.

L. Test Principle:
The HSV-1/2 Master A and HSV-1/2 Master B components contain reagents and enzymes
for the specific amplification of target regions within the HSV-1 and HSV-2 genomes and for
the direct detection of the specific amplicon in fluorescence channels Cycling Orange and
Cycling Green respectively of the Rotor-Gene Q MDx.
In addition, the artus HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx Kit contains a second heterologous control
system to identify potential failures during the assay process. This is detected as an internal
control (IC) in fluorescence channel Cycling Crimson of the Rotor-Gene Q MDx.
The contents of the artus HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx Kit are sufficient for 72 tests in one to 3
batches of 24 reactions on the QIAsymphony RGQ MDx. The Rotor-Gene Q MDx rotor
holds up to 72 reaction tubes.

Materials Required but Not Provided
The following is a list of some of the major materials required but not provided with the kit.
1. Equipment for sample preparation and assay setup:
QIAsymphony SP (module of the QIAsymphony RGQ MDx)*
QIAsymphony AS (module of the QIAsymphony RGQ MDx)*
QIAsymphony software version 4.0
2. Equipment for PCR
Rotor-Gene Q MDx (module of the QIAsymphony RGQ MDx)*
Rotor-Gene AssayManager® version 1.0 (module of the QIAsymphony RGQ MDx)
Interpretation of Results
The artus HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx Kit Assay Profile automatically analyzes samples,
positive and negative controls, and run results. Every sample and control displays an
independent result for each target: HSV-1, HSV-2, and Internal Control. Each result is
reported as “Signal detected”, “No signal”, or “INVALID”.
All targets for the positive control and negative control must be valid to confirm that the
assay status is successful and that the test results may be reported. If any target of the positive
control or negative control is invalid, results for every sample in the run will display
“INVALID”; the entire assay run must then be retested.
The positive control must report a “Signal detected” result for HSV-1, HSV-2, and Internal
Control. The negative control must report a “Signal detected” result for Internal Control and
“No signal” for the specified HSV-1 and HSV-2 target.
It is expected that in some positive HSV-1/2 samples the Internal Control PCR may be
inhibited due to competition from amplifying HSV-1/2, which will cause a “No signal” or
“INVALID” result for Internal Control.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the artus HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx Kit was assessed using a seven-
member precision panel consisting of 2 strains of HSV: HSV-1 MacIntyre and HSV-2
MS, diluted in M4RT viral transport medium. Panel members were formulated with a
single HSV strain present (HSV-1 or HSV-2) at three concentrations; Positive (~2-3X
LoD), Low Positive (1X LoD), and High Negative (<1X LoD, targeting a 20-80%
positivity rate). A seventh panel member (Negative) was prepared using M4RT viral
transport medium only. The data obtained were used to determine the mean C ,
T
standard deviation (ST DEV) and the coefficient of variation (%CV) for each target
and the internal control.
For the within laboratory repeatability study, the seven-member panel was tested in
replicates of three, once a day for a total of twelve days. The testing was conducted
by two alternating operators using one QIAsymphony RGQ MDx (QS-RGQ MDx)
instrument platform and one reagent kit lot.

To measure site-to-site reproducibility, the 7-member panel was run by 2 users at
each of 3 external sites. Each of the 2 users performed 5 runs on alternating testing
days for a total of 90 test results per panel member. Panel members were tested in
replicates of 3 that were randomized and blinded to the user. A single QIAsymphony
RGQ MDx instrument platform and one lot of the artus HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx Kit
were used at each site to conduct the study.

Stability studies:
On-Board Reagent Stability
Two HSV strains (HSV-1, McIntyre strain and HSV-2, MS strain from Zeptometrix
Corporation (ZMC) were diluted to 2-3X LoD in M4RT viral transport medium. The
samples and reagents were incubated on-board the QIAsymphony SP/AS for 65
minutes before initiating the QIAsymphony SP/AS run. Following completion of the
QIAsymphony AS run, assembled PCRs were held in the instrument for an additional
65 minutes before transferring the assembled reactions to the RGQ MDx instrument
and initiating PCR. All 35 replicates were detected for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 after
65 minutes of incubation before initiating the QIAsymphony SP/AS run followed by
65 minutes of incubation before initiating the PCR reaction in the RGQ MDx
instrument.
Sample Stability
One HSV-1 Isolate #15 strain and one HSV-2 MS strain, both from ZMC, were used
to prepare contrived positive samples to assess specimen stability. Both strains were
prepared in M4RT viral transport medium plus matrix at 2-3X LoD (54.6 TCID /mL
50
for HSV-1 Isolate #15 and 2.94 TCID /mL for HSV-2 MS Strain) and ≥10X LoD
50
(190 TCID /mL for HSV-1 Isolate #15 and 12 TCID /mL for HSV-2 MS Strain).
50 50
Contrived negative specimens were also prepared, consisting of M4RT viral transport
medium plus matrix alone. Six replicates of each strain at 2-3X LoD were stored at
2ºC to 8ºC, -15ºC to -10ºC, and -30ºC to -20ºC. Three replicates of each strain at
≥10X LoD as well as the negative specimen were also stored at the stated
temperatures. Samples were removed at defined time intervals for testing. Testing
was performed with samples stored at both ends of the temperature range (-15ºC to
-10ºC and -30ºC to -20ºC) to support a specimen stability claim at -30ºC to -10ºC. A
specimen was considered to be stable for a given time point/condition if the HSV-1 or
HSV-2 target was detected for each positive sample replicate tested. The data from
this study supports the HSV-1/2 specimen stability for 30 days at -30°C to -10°C and
7 days at 4°C and up to three freeze-thaw cycles in M4RT.
Transport Stability
The artus HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx Kit is a frozen product, stored at -30°C to -10°C
and shipped on dry ice. The storage of the artus HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx Kit at
alternating temperatures for different time intervals was tested to simulate storage and
transport conditions on dry ice for 72 hours. Individual kit lot materials were cycled
from required storage conditions (-30°C to -10°C freezer) to shipping conditions
(-90°C to -70°C freezer) and back to required storage conditions (-30°C to -10°C
freezer), before testing the kit reagents. The artus HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx Kit was
tested at Day 0 in order to establish baseline performance. All replicates in each run
(following 1X, 2X and 3X temperature cycles) passed stability testing.

Controls:
HSV-1/2 Internal Control:
The internal control consists of synthetic plasmid DNA. The Internal Control is input
into the lysis buffer at a low concentration so that it is susceptible to the presence of
potential inhibitors present in the sample matrix. Its function is to monitor the
integrity of PCR reagents as well as the integrity of the PCR process without
interfering with the target specific PCR.
External controls:
HSV-1/2 positive and negative controls are loaded onto the QIAsymphony SP before
DNA purification in place of a patient sample. They monitor the efficiency of sample
preparation and assist in identifying contamination during sample preparation and/or
the downstream assay. Positive Control should always be positive for HSV-1 and
HSV-2 targets. Negative control should always be negative for HSV-1 and HSV-2
targets. However, the negative control may exhibit a signal in some cases but will still
be considered negative as long as the signal obtained is outside the negative control
C cutoff.

d. Detection limit:
Analytical Sensitivity (Limit of Detection):
The limit of detection (LoD) was assessed for the artus HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx Kit
using two strains of HSV-1 (MacIntyre and Isolate #15 from ZMC) and two strains of
HSV-2 (MS and Isolate #2 from ZMC). The LoD is defined as the HSV titer
(TCID /mL) detected with a probability of 95% or greater and was determined by
50
probit analysis. The results, representative of the analytical sensitivity of the artus
HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx Kit, are summarized in the following table.
Limit of Detection
Strain LoD (95 % CI) TCID /mL

HSV-1 Macintyre 4.42 x 100 (2.81 x 100 - 9.14 x 100)
HSV-1 Isolate 15 1.82 x 101 (0.96 x 101 - 5.47 x 101)
HSV-2 MS 9.78 x 10-1 (6.6 x 10-1 - 2.01 x 100)
HSV-2 Isolate 2 1.91 x 102 (1.26 x 102 - 3.55 x 102)
Analytical Reactivity:
The analytical reactivity of the artus HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx Kit was assessed to
determine whether the kit could detect a broad range of HSV-1 and HSV-2 strains.
Strains were obtained from ZMC. A total of 39 strains (20 HSV-1 and 19 HSV-2)
were diluted in M4RT viral transport medium to 2–3X LoD and tested with the artus
HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx Kit. The intended HSV-1 or HSV-2 was detected in all
strains tested.

Cross Reactivity:
A panel of microorganisms that may be present in patient specimens was tested to
determine whether these microorganisms interfered with the detection of HSV-1 or
HSV-2 or were cross-reactive with the artus HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx Kit. Organisms
were tested at a target concentration of approximately 1 x 106 CFU/ml for bacteria
(with the exception of Neisseria gonorrhea, which was tested at 3.5 x 105 CFU/mL
due to the low titer of the stock culture) and fungi or ≥1 x 105 TCID /ml for viruses
50
separately in the presence of 2–3X LoD of each of three HSV strains: HSV-1
MacIntyre, HSV-1 Isolate #15, or HSV-2 MS. None of the potential interfering
organisms cross-reacted or interfered with the detection of any of the HSV strains by
the artus HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx Kit.

Target Carryover Study:
Absence of carryover between samples for the entire workflow was demonstrated by
performing 5 runs with alternating high positive (≥ 1.0 x 105 TCID /mL) and
50
negative samples. All samples were detected correctly, generating a carryover rate of
0.0%.
Interfering Substances:
A panel of 24 substances that may be present in oral/genital patient specimens was
tested to determine whether these substances interfered with the performance of the
artus HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx Kit. Two strains of HSV: HSV-1 MacIntyre and
HSV-2 MS, were diluted to approximately 2–3X LOD in M4RT viral transport
medium and spiked with each potentially inhibitory substance. None of the
substances showed an inhibitory effect on the detection of HSV-1 or HSV-2 by the
artus HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx Kit.

Ninety-six (96) prospective specimens identified as HSV-2 positive by ELVIS viral
culture were removed from the initial 510 genital specimens for the calculation of the
HSV-1 clinical performance. As a result, there were 566 samples (414 genital and
152 oral) used to determine clinical performance for HSV-1. The clinical
performance for HSV-1 and HSV-2 mucocutaneous lesions was also assessed.
Prospectively collected samples that were classified as mucocutaneous included oral,
cervical, vaginal, rectal, and any sample taken from a vesicle or lesion. The
performance information is presented in the following tables:

HSV-2 Oral Retrospective Sample Study and Contrived Sample Study:
A retrospective study was conducted using oral samples for HSV2 detection. A total
of 38 oral retrospective specimens were tested with the artus HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx
assay and ELVIS HSV ID and D3 Typing Test System. There were no HSV-2
positive specimens detected in 38 oral specimens.
A contrived specimen study was performed to provide additional performance data
for detection of HSV-2 in oral samples. A panel of seventy (70) individual samples
consisting of 15 HSV-1/2 negative oral samples, 10 HSV-1 positive oral samples, and
45 HSV-1/2 negative oral samples spiked with HSV-2 at a concentration from 3X
LoD to 1000X LoD was tested with the artus HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx Kit. The HSV-
1 positive oral samples and HSV-1/2 negative oral samples obtained from the method
comparison study were used to make the panel. All samples were randomized and
blinded to the operator prior to testing. HSV-2 was detected in all 45 contrived
samples at all concentrations tested, supporting the claim for detection of HSV-2 in
oral samples by the artus HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx Kit.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not Applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The observed expected values for HSV-1 and HSV-2 during a multi-center clinical trial
were calculated for the artus HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx kit. The expected values for the
patients ages 18 and older are shown for genital lesion samples and for all ages for the
oral samples. The observed prevalence rates for HSV-1 were estimated as 18.6%
(91/489) for genital samples and 42.1% (64/152) for oral samples. The prevalence rates
for HSV-2 were estimated as 26.2% (128/489) for genital samples and 0% (0/152) for
oral samples. Gender and age distribution is provided in the following tables.

Positive and Negative Predictive Value: Hypothetical positive and negative predictive
values (PPV & NPV) for the artus HSV-1/2 QS-RGQ MDx kit are shown in the table
below. These calculations are based on hypothetical prevalence and overall sensitivity
and specificity per specimen type as determined in the clinical study.
For HSV-1, these calculations are based upon an overall sensitivity and specificity of
96% and 94%, respectively, for genital swabs and 94% and 82%, respectively, for oral
swabs.
For HSV-2, these calculations are based upon an overall sensitivity and specificity of
97% and 91%, respectively, for genital swabs and 0.0% and 100%, respectively, for oral
swabs.
PPV was calculated using: (Sensitivity x Prevalence) / (Sensitivity x Prevalence + [1 -
Specificity] x [1 - Prevalence]).
NPV was calculated using: (Specificity x [1 - Prevalence]) / ([1 - Sensitivity] x
Prevalence + Specificity x [1 - Prevalence]).
