for over-the-counter (OTC) use only.
Surearly Digital Pregnancy Test is an in vitro diagnostic medical device for the
rapid determination of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine. The test is
for the qualitative detection of hCG to aid in the determination of pregnancy. It is
intended for over-the-counter (OTC) use only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For over the counter use
4. Special instrument requirements:
None
I. Device Description:
Both Surearly Pregnancy Test Strip and Surearly Digital Pregnancy Test are in vitro
diagnostic medical devices, which use the qualitative assay for the detection of human
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine, as an aid in the early determination of
pregnancy. The assays are based on a lateral-flow immunochromatographic assay.
For Surearly Pregnancy Test Strips, users immerse the sample pad of the strip into the
collected urine, see their test results with colored lines on the strip and interpret the test
result according to the instructions for use. Users are able to read test results in 5
minutes.
For Surearly Digital Pregnancy Test, the colored lines are not visible to users as the
strip is located inside a plastic housing of the test reader. The pregnancy test result is
displayed as a “YES” or “NO” on the device. The device displays the test result after 3
minutes. The digital device could be used in either dip mode or mid-stream mode.

L. Test Principle:
Both devices (Surearly Pregnancy Test Strip and Surearly Digital Pregnancy Test) use
a double antibody sandwich method. Each test device contains mouse monoclonal anti-
β-hCG antibody colloidal gold conjugate pre-dried on a pad. Mouse monoclonal anti-α-
hCG antibody (on the Test Line) and goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody (on the
Control Line) are coated and immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane. During the
test procedures, hCG in the urine specimen reacts with the dye conjugate (mouse anti-
β-hCG antibody- colloidal gold conjugate specific to the beta subunit of hCG) and
forms a complex. Because of capillary and chromatographic effects of the
nitrocellulose membrane, the complex migrates along the membrane to the α-hCG
antibody line (T), and remains captured in the T line. As a result a red colored band
develops in the T line, indicating a positive result. If there is no hCG in the urine, there
is no red band in the test zone, indicating a negative result. The Control line should
develop in the control zone regardless of the test result if sufficient sample volume has
been applied to the test strip.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Both devices (Surearly Pregnancy Test Strip and Surearly Digital Pregnancy
Test) were tested using the protocol described below. For the digital device,
both the dip method and the stream method were tested.
Eight samples containing intact hCG at concentrations of 0, 6.25, 8.5, 22.25, 25,
50, 250, 500 mIU/mL were prepared in negative urine. The hCG used for
spiking contained purified intact hCG traceable to the WHO 5th International
Standard (IS) for hCG. The stream method in this study was a simulated
midstream testing. For within-run precision, each sample was tested in
replicates of 30 using one lot of each device. For lot-to-lot and day-to-day
precision, each sample was tested 3 times/day for 5 days, using 3 lots of each
device. For between-run & between-operator precision, each sample was tested
by three laboratory professionals 2 times/day for 5 days using one lot of each
device.
The results obtained with Surearly Pregnancy Test Strip and Surearly Digital
Pregnancy Test are summarized in the tables below:

Urine was collected from thirty (30) confirmed non-pregnant women and
divided into aliquots spiked with the indicated amounts of hCG standard (0,
6.25, 8. 8.5, 9, 9.4, 12.5, 18.75, 22.5, 25, 50, 100 mIU/mL). The samples were
masked and randomized prior to testing.
The test was performed by laboratory professionals using the Surearly
Pregnancy Test Strip and the Surearly Digital Pregnancy Test, and by 120 lay
users (aged 19-45 years) using the Surearly Pregnancy Test Strip. The results

The results demonstrated that the sensitivity of the Surearly Pregnancy Test
Strip and Surearly Digital Pregnancy Test (the lowest concentration that yields
100% positive results) is 25mIU/mL. The concentration at which approximately
half of the devices yield positive results is 12.5 mIU/ml.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity:
Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), and Thyroid
Stimulating Hormone (TSH) were tested for cross-reactivity by spiking high
concentrations of each substance into negative urine samples and negative urine
samples spiked with 6.25 mIU/mL, 25 mIU/mL and 50 mIU/mL hCG. Each
sample was tested in triplicate using both the Surearly Pregnancy Test Strip and
the Surearly Digital Pregnancy Test. No cross-reactivity was observed for FSH
at concentrations up to 1000 mIU/mL, LH at up to 500 mIU/mL and TSH at up
to 1000 μIU/mL.
Interference:
Fourteen endogenous and exogenous substances were tested for interference by
spiking high concentrations of each substance into negative urine samples and
negative urine samples spiked with 6.25 mIU/mL, 25 mIU/mL, and 50 mIU/mL
hCG. Each sample was tested in replicates of 3 using both the Surearly
Pregnancy Test Strip and Surearly Digital Pregnancy Test. The highest
concentration tested that demonstrate no interference are summarized in the
below table.

PH effect:
The pH of negative urine pools were adjusted to a pH range of 4 to 9 in 1 pH
unit increments and spiked with hCG to 6.25 mIU/mL, 25 mIU/mL and 50
mIU/mL. The unspiked aliquots (hCG at 0 mIU/mL) were used as controls.
Each test was performed in triplicate with Surearly Pregnancy Test Strip and
Surearly Digital Pregnancy Test according to the instructions for use. The
results demonstrate that pH ranging from 4 to 9 in urine samples does not
interfere with the performance of the test.
Specific gravity:
To evaluate potential interference from changes in specific gravity, urine
samples with specific gravity from 1.000 to 1.030 in 0.010 unit increments were
tested with the urine samples spiked with hCG to 6.25 mIU/mL, 25 mIU/mL

and 50 mIU/mL. Each test was performed in triplicate with Surearly Pregnancy
Test Strip and Surearly Digital Pregnancy Test according to the instructions for
use. The results demonstrate that specific gravity ranging from 1.000 to 1.030
in urine samples does not interfere with the performance of the test.
High dose hook effect:
The high dose hook effect was evaluated using intact hCG standards (WHO 5th
IS) ranging from 0.1 to 500 IU/mL hCG concentrations, and hCG βcf at
500,000 and 1,000,000 pmol/L levels. All samples yielded the expected
positive results. The results demonstrate that no hooks effect was observed at
the concentrations tested.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 456 urine specimens were tested by laboratory technicians, including
150 samples from non-pregnant women and 306 samples from women who
were clinically confirmed to be pregnant, among them 156 were in their first
trimester based on their last menstrual period. Ages of subjects ranged from 18
to 48 years. The samples were blind coded and randomized prior to testing. The
results are summarized below.

Lay user study
A total of 198 lay users aged 18 to 45 years participated in this study. Among
the 198 users, 100 were non-pregnant and 98 were recruited who might be
pregnant or were clinically confirmed to be pregnant. Each user tested their own
urine using the Surearly Pregnancy Test Strip and Surearly Digital Pregnancy
Test. For the digital test, 100 users (randomly assigned) tested with urine
midstream procedure and the other 98 users tested with urine dip procedure. The
same urine samples collected from the lay users were also tested by
professionals using the dip procedure and the results are presented in the table
below.

All lay users were instructed to read the proposed package insert in order to
operate the device for the studies above. Each lay user was also given a
questionnaire to rate how well they understood the instructions and how easy to
use the device. The devices were demonstrated to be easy to use, and the results
easy to interpret.
The readability of the labeling (strip format and the digital format) was found to
be at the 7th grade level using a Flesch-Kincaid analysis.
Pre-, Peri- and Post-Menopausal study
A study of Pre-, Peri- and Post-Menopausal women was performed by 510 non-
pregnant lay users (170 women in pre-menopausal age of 18-40 years old, 170
women in peri-menopausal age of 41-55 years old, and 170 women in post-
menopausal age over 55 years old) to demonstrate whether the test devices
might have false positive results from women who are not pregnant. Each
