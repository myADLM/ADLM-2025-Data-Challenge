K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA Centaur HAV Total assay is a fully automated, competitive immunoassay using
direct, chemiluminescent technology. The assay consists of three reagent addition and incubation
steps. First, the sample is pretreated with Ancillary Reagent containing cysteine. Next, HAV
antigen is added from the ancillary well (Antigen Reagent). Lite Reagent and Solid Phase are
then added. The Lite Reagent contains monoclonal mouse antibody to HAV antigen labeled with
acridinium ester and biotinylated Fab fragment of a monoclonal mouse antibody to HAV antigen.
The Solid Phase contains streptavidin covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles. After the
final incubation, the immuno-complex formed is washed with Wash 1 prior to initiation of the
chemiluminescent reaction. The relative light units (RLUs) detected by the ADVIA Centaur
System are used to calculate the Index Value from the Master Curve.
Interpretation of results
· Samples with a calculated value of less than 1.00 Index Value are considered nonreactive
for antibodies to hepatitis A virus.
· Samples with a calculated value greater than or equal to 1.00 Index Value are considered
reactive for antibodies to hepatitis A virus.
Assay results above the cutoff of the assay are not indicative of antibody level.

Fifty-five (55) pediatric serum samples (male and female, age range from 2 to 21 years),
including samples from a high risk population, were evaluated with the ADVIA Centaur
HAVT assay and another commercially available assay.

Neonate vs Adult Comparison
A study was conducted to evaluate the results observed when neonatal samples are
tested with the ADVIA Centaur HAVT assay. Cord blood serum was used as a surrogate
for neonatal serum. A total of thirty (30) cord blood and 30 adult serum samples were
spiked with anti-HAV positive stock to yield samples at different analyte levels. The
