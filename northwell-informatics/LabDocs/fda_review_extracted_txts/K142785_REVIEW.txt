I. Device Description:
The PRODIGY iConnect Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the PRODIGY
iConnect Blood Glucose Meter, PRODIGY No Coding Blood Glucose Test Strips and
PRODIGY Control Solutions (2 Levels – Level 1 and Level 2). The PRODIGY iConnect
Blood Glucose Monitoring System is marketed as a Meter kit with a carrying case, battery,
Meter User Guide, Quick Reference Guide, Logbook, Warranty Card, PRODIGY Lancing
Device, PRODIGY Lancets, PRODIGY No Coding Blood Glucose Test Strips, and
PRODIGY Control Solution (Level 1). The system is also marketed as a Simple kit that
includes all components of the Meter Kit except for PRODIGY No Coding Blood Glucose
Test Strips and PRODIGY Control Solution. The test strips and control solutions are
available separately.
The system has the ability to physically connect to mobile devices for the purpose of storing
blood glucose measurements via a mobile App. When the PRODIGY iConnect meter is
connected to a compatible phone, the App receives the test results and allows users to
display, store, and track blood glucose measurement data. Users can also use the App to
upload their blood glucose measurements to a Cloud account or email the data to others. For
real-time measurements, the App can serve as an aid to the user in operating the meter, e.g.
by displaying a prompt to insert a test strip into the meter and by counting down 6 seconds
after a blood sample is applied. The App is specific to the PRODIGY iConnect Blood Gluose
Monitoring System and cannot be used with other glucose meters. The App is compatible
with iOS 6.0 and higher as well as the Android Jelly Bean and Android KitKat operating
systems.
The PRODIGY iConnect blood glucose meter can function independently of the App and
without connection to a mobile device.
The PRODIGY No Coding Blood Glucose Test Strips contain the following reagent
composition: 0.4% glucose oxidase (Aspergillus Niger), 3.8% potassium ferricyanide
(electron shuttle), and 95.8% non-active ingredients and enzyme protector. The test strips are
available for purchase separately.
The PRODIGY Control Solutions Level 1 and Level 2 were previously cleared in k122338.
Level 1 is included in one kit configuration (Meter kit) and both Level 1 and Level 2 are
available for purchase separately.

IEC 60601-1-2 “Medical electrical equipment, Part 2. Electromagnetic compatibility –
Requirements and tests”
L. Test Principle:
Blood glucose is measured by an electrical current that is produced when a blood sample
mixes with the reagents of the test strip. The electrical current changes with the amount of
glucose in the blood sample. The meter measures the strength of the electrical current,
calculates the blood glucose level and then displays the result in either milligrams of glucose
per deciliter (mg/dL) or millimoles of glucose per liter (mmol/L).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-Run Precision
The sponsor performed within-run precision studies using venous whole blood
samples spiked to five different glucose concentration levels (30 to 50, 51 to 110, 111
to 150, 151 to 250, 251 to 400 mg/dL). Each glucose concentration level was
analyzed in replicates of 10, with 3 test strip lots, and 10 meters, for a total of 300
tests per glucose level for each meter. Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed using venous whole blood samples. The evaluation
was conducted with 10 meters and 3 test strip lots. Samples with the following
glucose concentrations (mg/dL) were prepared: 15, 25, 95, 165, 235, 305, 375, 445,
515, 585, and 615.
Low samples were prepared by allowing glycolysis to occur. High samples were
prepared by spiking into the venous whole blood samples. Values were confirmed
using a laboratory reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer) calibrated with NIST
reference material.
10 strips from each lot were used for testing at each glucose concentration for a total
of n=30 tests per glucose concentration. The evaluation yielded the following

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 20
– 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The system is traceable to NIST standard NISH SRM #917c Clinical Dextrose.
Test strip stability:
Stability protocols and acceptance criteria for the PRODIGY No Coding Blood Glucose
Test Strips were evaluated and found to be acceptable to support closed-vial stability of
24 months at 39.2-104°F (10-85% relative humidity) and open-vial stability of 90 days
when test strips are stored at the recommended storage temperature (39.2-104°F) and 10-
85% relative humidity or until the expiration date printed on the label, whichever comes
first.
Control Solution Value Assignment and Stability:
PRODIGY Control Solutions were previously cleared in K122338. When stored
between 39 and 86°F, the PRODIGY Control Solutions are stable for 18 months
when unopened, and 90 days after first opening.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20 to 600 mg/dL and is supported by results of the linearity
study described above (M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by spiking endogenous and exogenous potentially
interfereing substances into venous whole blood. Each potential interferent was tested at
3 glucose levels (60, 120, and 250 mg/dL). Ten replicates were measured for each test
sample. Results of test samples measured with the PRODIGY iConnect Blood Glucose
Monitoring System were compared to samples measured on a laboratory-based reference
method (YSI 2300 analyzer) and bias and percent bias were calculated. This procedure
was performed using 3 test strip lots. Significant interference was defined by the
sponsor as a bias ≥ ±10 % of the test samples relative to control samples.

Tolbutamide 400 mg/dL
Triglyceride 2000 mg/dL
Uric acid 8.0 mg/dL
Xylose 100 mg/dL
The following information has been added to the labeling for this device based on results of the
interference studies:
The system exhibits interference from acetaminophen. Do not use during treatment with
medications containing acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol).
Uric acid and ascorbic acid (when occurring in normal blood or taken at normal
therapeutic concentrations) do not significantly affect results. However, abnormally high
concentrations of these substances in the blood may cause inaccurately high results. For
example, if you are ingesting high levels of Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) you may get
inaccurate results. If you have a disease or condition in which uric acid levels in your
blood may be elevated, such as gout, you may also get inaccurate results with this system.

6. Quality Control:
Control materials comprise the two control solution levels which available for use with
the device. PRODIGY Control Solution Level 1 is included with one kit configuration
and both Level 1 and Level 2 are available separately for use with this system.
Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. The
control solution readings are not included in the average of the patient results. An
acceptable range for each control solution level is printed on the test strip vial label. The
user is cautioned not to use the meter if results of control solution testing fall outside of
these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study: To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the PRODIGY iConnect
Blood Glucose Monitoring System, venous blood samples were adjusted to
hematocrit levels of 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, and 60%. Each
hematocrit level was tested at 5 glucose concentration intervals (30 to 50, 51 to 90,
120 to 150, 151 to 250, and 280 to 350 mg/dL) for a total of 30 samples. The
evaluation included 10 meters, each tested with 3 lots of test strips. Results from the
meter were compared to results obtained using a laboratory-based reference
measurement (YSI 2300 analyzer). The evaluation of percent bias relative to values
obtained on the YSI 2300 analyzer demonstrated acceptable performance across the
hematocrit range of 20-60%.
2. Altitude study: To evaluate the effect of altitude on the PRODIGY iConnect Blood
Glucose Monitoring System, meters were tested at 3 altitudes above sea level (2,920
ft; 6,234 ft; and 11,161 ft). Venous whole blood samples altered to 5 glucose levels
(30 to 50, 51 to 110, 111 to 150, 151 to 250, and 251 to 400 mg/dL) were tested at
each altitude. The evaluation included 3 meters and 3 test strip lots. Each test strip lot
included 10 replicates for a total of 30 replicates per glucose level/altitude
combination. Results were compared to results obtained using a laboratory-based
reference measurement (YSI 2300 analyzer) and demonstrated that altitudes up to
11,161 feet above sea level have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements
from the PRODIGY iConnect Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
3. Sample Volume: To demonstrate the minimum sample volume, venous whole blood
samples with volumes ranging from 0.2 -1.5 μL were tested. Sample concentrations
included 5 glucose levels (30 to 50, 51 to 110, 111 to 150, 151 to 250, 251 to 400
mg/d) at each sample volume. Testing included 10 strips from each of 3 lots for each
glucose concentration/sample volume combination for a total of 30 replicates per
volume/glucose level combination. 10 meters were used during testing. Values
obtained were compared to values obtained using a laboratory-based reference
method (YSI 2300 analyzer). Results support a minimum sample volume of 0.7 μL.
The device produces an error message (“Lb”) when the blood sample is ≤ 0.6µL.

4. Operating Conditions Study: Temperature and humidity operating conditions were
using venous whole at 3 glucose concentration levels (38-68, 132-188, 280-420
mg/dL), 10 meters, and 3 lots of test strips. The following temperature and relative
humidity (RH) conditions were tested: 50°F and 10% RH, 50°F and 85% RH, 104°F
and 10% RH, 104°F and 85% RH. Individual glucose measurements were compared
to an established laboratory reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer) and percent biases
were calculated. Results support the claimed operating temperature range of 50°F to
104°F (10°C to 40°C) and relative humidity range of 10 to 85% RH.
5. Infection Control and Robustness Studies: The device is intended for single-patient
use only. Disinfection efficacy testing on the surface materials of the meter
demonstrated complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen
disinfectant, PDI SUPER SANI-CLOTH germicidal disposable wipes (EPA
Registration # 9480-4). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor
demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of the
meter after 3650 cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate 5 years of
device use with a maximum frequency of cleaning and disinfection 2x / day.
6. EMC Testing and Electrical Safety Studies: EMC testing was certified and
appropriate compliance certificates were provided.
7. Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results showed that the
labeling (meter user guide, App user guide, test strip package insert, control solution
package insert) were written at grade levels ranging from 6th to 8th grade.
8. The meter user guide states that technical support is available Monday through
Friday, 9AM to 5 PM EST by calling1-800-243-2636.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
