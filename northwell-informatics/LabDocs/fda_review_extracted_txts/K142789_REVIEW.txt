H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The A1c iGear is intended for in vitro diagnostic use only for the quantitative
measurement of the percent hemoglobin A1c (%HbA1c) from finger-stick blood or
venous blood collected in either EDTA or sodium fluoride (NaF) for clinical laboratory
and point of care use. The measurement of HbA1c is recommended to monitor long-term
glycemic control of persons previously diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. This test is not
for screening or diagnosis of diabetes.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
· For prescription use only.
· This test is not for screening or diagnosis of diabetes.
· Clinical setting and Point-of-Care.
· This test should not be used in monitoring daily glucose control.
· Should not be used to replace daily home testing of urine and blood glucose levels.
· Should not be used for analyzing samples from patients with conditions causing
shortened red cell survival, such as hemolytic disease, pregnancy, and significant
acute or chronic blood loss.
· Hemoglobinopathies may interfere with glycated hemoglobin analysis. Samples
containing the following hemoglobin variant have been shown to interfere with this
assay: Hemoglobin C, Hemoglobin D, Hemoglobin E, Hemoglobin F (>10%), and
Hemoglobin S.
4. Special instrument requirements:
A1c iGear spectrophotometric analyzer
I. Device Description:
The A1c iGear System is comprised of a fully automated electrical spectrophotometer that
measures %HbA1c in human whole blood or finger-stick samples using a dedicated reagent
(MEDIDAS HbA1c). The A1c iGear system shines light from a 660 nm light emitting diode
(LED) through the test material and measures the quantity of hemoglobin A1c in the total
hemoglobin (HbA1c%) based on the lot-specific reagent parameter and changes in light
absorbency caused by antigen-antibody reactions.
The MEDIDAS HbA1c test kit is comprised of test cartridge, capillary, pipette tip, and
master calibration card. The cartridge is pre-filled with reagent: latex (Reagent1:R1),
antibody (Reagent 2:R2), and sample diluent solution.

The A1ciGear System is the same device as the A1cGear system previously cleared in
k130014; however, the device has been modified to include a change in the name of the test
system, an external connection has been added to enable the analyzer to connect to external
PC and USB flash memory, and the air filter has been simplified and air circulation has been
improved from the front side of the analyzer. Finally, electrical system improvements
included addition of a color LCD touch panel and control, A/D converter, external
communication, and Operational board integrations. There was no change to the reagent
component (MEDIDAS HbA1c cartridge).

L. Test Principle:
The A1c iGear system is an immune-turbidimetric method enhanced by latex particles using
a two-reagent sequence. Hemolysate is mixed with the R1 reagent. Total Hemoglobin and
HbA1c have the same absorption affinity for these particles; therefore, the % of HbA1c
present in the total hemoglobin is proportional to the latex-bound HbA1c. Addition of R2
reagent leads to agglutination complexes, formed by the interaction between latex-bound
HbA1c and the corresponding antibodies. Turbidity created by these aggregates is
proportional to the amount of latex-bound HbA1c therefore is proportional to the % of

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Internal Precision Study
Precision studies were performed according to CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. The within-
run precision, between-run precision, between –day precision and total precision were
determined using the A1c iGear System. The study included whole blood samples
representing low, middle, and high levels of %HbA1c and a 3-level whole blood
control. The mean values for the controls were 5.9% (low level), 7.4% (middle
level), and 11.7% (high level). The mean value for the whole blood samples were
5.6% (low level), 7.3% (middle level), and 10.7% (high level). Each sample was
tested in duplicate for 10 days on two iGear instruments for a total of 40 results per
sample. Results are shown below:

the barcode and encoded onto the Master Calibration card and are traceable to the
International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) reference material.
Stability: The A1c iGear System (Master Calibration Card and test cartridge) should
be refrigerated at 2-8 °C (36-46 °F) and used immediately after opening. The
expiration date of the Master Calibration Card and cartridge as stated on the seal of
the outer box package is 12 months after the date of manufacture.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were previously evaluated in K130014
The interferent study results are summarized in the table below:
Potential Interferent Highest concentration in which no
significant interference was observed
Unconjugated Bilirubin 37 mg/dL
Triglycerides 2,000 mg/dL

Acetaminophen 20 mg/dL
Ibuprofen 50 mg/dL
Glibenclamide 0.2 mg/dL
Metformin 5.1 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid 6.0 mg/dL
An interference study was previously evaluated to assess the effect of labile A1c,
Carbamylated hemoglobin, and acetylsalicylic acid with the A1c Gear System in
k130014. The sponsor concluded there was no significant interference with the
following:
· Labile A1c concentrations up to 2000 mg/dL
· Carbamylated hemoglobin up to 10 mg/dL
· Acetylated hemoglobin up to 200 mg/dL
A hemoglobin variant study was evaluated using commercial samples known to
contain Hemoglobin variants C, D, E, S, and F in k130014. Samples contained both
low and high levels of % HbA1c at concentrations from 4.2-11.6% HbA1c. These
variant samples were tested in duplicate using the A1C Gear System. The results
indicated samples containing Hemoglobin C were elevated by 24%, samples
containing Hemoglobin D were elevated by 16%, samples containing Hemoglobin E
were elevated by 13%, and samples containing Hemoglobin S were elevated by 13%.
Samples containing >10% Hemoglobin F were decreased by 22%. All variants tested
were shown to interfere with this device.
The device labeling contains the following boxed warning:
“Hemoglobinopathies may interfere with glycated hemoglobin analysis. Samples
containing the following hemoglobin variants have been shown to interfere with this
assay: Hemoglobin C, Hemoglobin D, Hemoglobin E, Hemoglobin F (>10%) and

Sample is obtained via a capillary tube that is inserted into a sampling cartridge. A pipette tip
is added to the sampling cartridge along with the capillary tube. The sampling cartridge,
which contains the capillary tube and the pipette tip, are inserted into the sampling slot.
Samples must be tested within one hour after inserting the capillary into the cartridge. The
sampling door is closed and the system beeps to start the test. A barcode printed on the
reagent cartridge is recognized by a barcode reader and verified to use the appropriate
calibration values for the particular lot number of the test cartridge.
5. Calibration:
The reagent kit contains a master calibration card. It is recommended to enroll the Master
Calibration card after opening every reagent kit.
6. Quality Control:
In the labeling the sponsor recommends that control measurements be assayed when
installing the device, when using a new lot of reagent, when using a new shipment of reagent,
when test results do not match other clinical findings or symptoms, when using the device or
reagent that had been stored for long-term, when reagents are stored improperly, when
training and confirming performance of new operators, following national and/or local
regulations for the facility, at regular intervals determined by the laboratory procedures.
P. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
Q. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
