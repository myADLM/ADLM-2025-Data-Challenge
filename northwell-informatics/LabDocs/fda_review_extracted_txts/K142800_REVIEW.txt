are no uniformly recognized drug levels for Barbiturates and Benzodiazepine in urine.
The assays provide only a preliminary analytical test result. Gas Chromatography/Mass
spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly
when preliminary positive results are indicated.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use, including point-of-care sites and over the counter use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
No applicable; these are visually read single use devices.
5. Device Description:
The Rapid Single/Multi-drug test Cup and Rapid Single/Multi-drug test Dipcard are
competitive binding, lateral flow immunochromatographic assays for the qualitative detection
of Amphetamine, Cocaine, Marijuana, Methamphetamine, Morphine, Barbiturates,
Benzodiazepines, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Methadone, Oxycodone, Phencyclidine
and their metabolites (specifically THC) at or above the cut-off levels as indicated. The tests
can be performed without the use of an instrument. The devices are available in one of two
formats: 1) Test Cup and 2) Test Dipcard. The test configurations consist of single drug
screening tests or any combinations of multiple drug screening tests.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The Rapid Single/Multi-drug test Cup and the Rapid Single/Multi-drug test Dipcard employ
lateral flow immunochromatographic technology based on the principle of competitive
binding. Drugs, if present in concentrations below the cutoff level, will not saturate the
binding sites of monoclonal antibody (mouse) coated particles in the device. The antibody-
coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-specific conjugate and a colored
line will appear in the test line region indicating a negative result. The colored line will not
form if the sample contains drug in excess of the cutoff level because the drug will saturate all
the binding sites of the drug-specific antibody, indicating a preliminary positive result. Each

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using the single drug and multi-drug test formats.
Drug free specimens were spiked with analytes at 0, ±75% cutoff, ±50% cutoff,
±25% cutoff and +100% cutoff of drug. The concentrations of the target drugs were
confirmed with GC/MS. In both the single drug test and multi-drug test precision
studies each concentration of the urine specimen was divided into aliquots. Each
aliquot was blindly labeled by a nonparticipant. Separate sets of blinded coded
samples were assigned and randomized prior to testing. The study was conducted by
6 operators at 3 Point-of-Care sites. Two operators per location tested 3 aliquots at
each concentration for each lot per day (3 runs/day) for 10 non-consecutive days
using one device lot per location. One operator tested the test dipcard format and the
second operator tested the test cup format. Results from these studies are presented in
the following tables:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
External controls are not supplied with this device. The labeling provides
information on where external controls can be obtained.
Stability:
Accelerated and real time studies have been conducted for The Rapid Single/Multi-
drug Test Cup and the Rapid Single/Multi-drug Test Dipcard devices. Protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The information
supports the following expiration date for the unopened (shelf-life) stability: 24
months under 4 to 30° C for both the Test Cup and Dipcard formats.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable. These are qualitative devices.
e. Analytical specificity:
I. Cross Reactivity
Cross reactivity with structurally similar compounds was tested for each device.
Each compound was spiked into drug-free urine. If any positive result was observed,
the compounds were further diluted with known drug-free urine. The lowest
concentration that produced a positive result was identified as the cross-reactive
concentration and the percent (%) cross-reactivity was determined. The study results
for both formats (dipcard and cup) were the same and are reported below:

II. Exogenous Interference:
Interference from structurally similar and dissimilar compounds was evaluated by
spiking them at a concentration of 100 µg/mL into urine containing drug
concentrations at ±50% of the cutoff. The concentrations of the target drugs were
confirmed with GC/MS. Each sample was tested in 3 replicates using each device
format (dipcard and cup). The compounds listed in this table were found not to
interfere with test results at a test concentration of 100 µg/mL.

III. Effect of urinary pH: The pH of an aliquot of negative a urine pool adjusted to
a pH range of 3 to 9 in 1 pH unit increments was spiked with ±50% cutoffs and each
device format (dipcard and cup) was evaluated. All concentrations were confirmed
by GC/MS. No interference was observed from pH for the target drugs.
IV. Effect of urinary specific gravity: Each device format (dipcard and cup) was
evaluated for interference from specific gravity. Drug free urine was adjusted to
±50% cutoffs and concentrations confirmed by GC/MS. The specific gravity studies
were conducted on specific gravity ranges from 1.002 to 1.040 and no interference
was observed from specific gravity for the target drugs.
f. Assay cut-off:
The test cut-off was evaluated in the precision studies. See precision studies above in
section 1.M.1.a.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted method comparison studies using unaltered clinical specimens
compared to GC/MS. Each sample was divided into 2 sets, one for cup format testing
and one for dipcard format testing. All aliquots were blindly labeled by a
nonparticipant and samples were randomized prior to testing. The study was
conducted by 4 nurses at two POC sites. The single and multi-drug dipcard tests were
tested at one site and the single and multi-drug cup tests were tested at the second
site. Different nurses evaluated each test. For each drug analyte, a total of 80
specimens were tested for each of the single drug and multi-drug dipcard and the
single drug and multi-drug cup tests. Results were the same for single and multi-drug
test cups and also the same for single and multi-drug test dipcards. The results are
presented below:

Home Use Consumer Study:
Groups of three hundred and sixty (360) lay users were used to test both the single
drug and multi-drug test devices. Different groups tested the Dipcard format and Cup
formats. Drug free specimens were spiked with analytes at 0, ±75% cutoff, ±50%
cutoff, ±25% cutoff and +100% cutoff of drug. The concentrations of the target drugs
were confirmed with GC/MS. In both the single drug test and multi-drug test user
study each concentration of the urine specimen was divided into aliquots. Each
aliquot was blindly labeled by a nonparticipant. Separate sets of blinded coded
samples were assigned and randomized prior to testing. Each lay user was provided
the package insert in English to perform the test, 1 blind labeled sample and a device.
Results of the study are presented below:

After testing, the participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire in English. The results
showed that 100% of respondents stated the tests were easy to use and the instructions were
clear. A SMOG readability assessment was performed on the Instructions Insert and
resulted in a reading level of 6.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Not applicable.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
