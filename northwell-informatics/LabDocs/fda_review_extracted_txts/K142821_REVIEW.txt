L. Test Principle:
The PAXgene Blood DNA Tube is intended to be placed inside a tube holder or an adaptor
that contains a needle designed to pierce the tube closure and allow blood to flow into the
tube. Once the vein has been penetrated (using a standard blood collection needle or a blood
collection set), the tube is pushed into the holder, and the blood enters the tube. Once a tube
has drawn the appropriate amount of blood, it is disengaged from the holder and inverted 8-
10 times to mix the additive with the blood.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility:
A multi-site study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the PAXgene Blood
DNA Tube. DNA was isolated and purified from whole blood aliquots using
commercially available, automated, silica membrane based DNA isolation kits. 126
subjects were enrolled in the study at the collection site to provide samples for one or
more of the assays below. Of the 126 subjects enrolled, 6 were withdrawn due to
incomplete or no blood draw. Three lots of candidate tubes were used in this study.
All subjects participating in the study were tested with a commercially available,
FDA cleared Cystic Fibrosis assay and a commercially available, FDA cleared SSO
HLA Typing assay. Subjects with viable blood draws numbered 41 through 120 were
additionally tested with a commercially available, FDA cleared Thrombophilia Risk
assay.
Site-to-Site Reproducibility:
Data from 20 subjects with three candidate tubes from the same lot per subject
were evaluated for site-to-site reproducibility across three sites (1 candidate tube for
each site). For each assay, either a Cystic Fibrosis assay or a SSO HLA assay, if one
subject had the same genetic markers detected with tubes tested at all three sites the
subject was designated concordant. Otherwise, the subject was designated discordant.
The results are summarized below:

*For all SSO HLA assay results across all reproducibility studies, in addition to the
two-field concordance presented in the 3 tables, probe hit patterns were analyzed and
a total of 7 probes out of 14,400 (200 comparisons × 72 probes) were found to be
discordant. The overall probe concordance was 99.95% with a 95% CI lower bound
of 99.9%.
Lot-to-Lot Variation:
Data from 20 subjects with three candidate tubes per subject (1 tube from each lot)
were evaluated for lot-to-lot variation at one site. For each assay, Cystic Fibrosis
Assay or SSO HLA assay and for each subject, if the same genotyping results were
obtained from specimens collected in candidate tubes from all 3 lots, the subject was
designated as concordant. Otherwise, the subject was designated discordant.

**CF Assay results shown were determined after retest. These include 1 sample from
Site B showing a result of “No Call” that was not retested. Three previous runs at Site
B included up to 38 samples showing a result of “No Call” due to a degraded enzyme
in the CF Assay Kit. Run 4 used a new enzyme to perform the test at Site B. The
results exclude 3 subjects from Site B where the assay was not repeated for 3
evaluation tubes.
***SSO HLA Assay results shown were determined after retest. These results include
4 samples from Site C that were re-extracted and retested due to a labeling error.
Inter and Intra-lot reproducibility:
Venous whole blood from 12 subjects drawn into 9 candidate tubes from lot 1 and 3
replicate candidate tubes each of lots 2 and 3 per subject. DNA extraction was
performed using a commercially available, automated, magnetic bead based DNA
isolation kit on one instrument by a single operator. DNA eluate concentration and
purity was determined on all DNA samples. The results are summarized below:
DNA purity: All DNA eluates extracted from the proposed tube yielded an
A260/A280 ratio range of 1.7-2.0.
DNA concentration: DNA eluates from 179 out of 180 tubes yielded DNA
concentration of ≥12.5 ng/μl. The DNA elute from the remaining tube yielded DNA
concentration of ≥10 ng/μl.

subjects drawn into 2 candidate tubes. DNA from each subject was extracted by one
operator on 1 commercially available, automated, magnetic bead based DNA
isolation kit. Blood collected into 1 candidate tube per subject were processed on the
day of collection. The remaining candidate tubes were frozen at −20°C and processed
after 1, 2 or 3 freeze thaw cycles total. DNA purity and concentration were
determined on all eluates. The results are summarized below:

Sample Stability Summary:
The results of the studies support the sponsor’s claim that the PAXgene Blood DNA
tubes are suitable for storage of whole blood for 14 days at 18-25°C, 28 days at 2-
8°C, 3 days at 35°C, 12 months at -20°C or when subjected to three freeze-thaw
cycles prior to DNA extraction.
Samples stored at -20°C or subjected to freeze thaw cycles yielded sufficient DNA to
perform the SSP HLA assay in each study, however, overall the DNA recovery for
specimens stored at -20°C or subjected to freeze thaw cycles was decreased compared
to samples that were never frozen. The following limitation was added to product
labeling:
“DNA concentrations in eluates extracted from blood specimens which
have undergone 1 freeze-thaw cycle have been shown to fall by more than
25%, which subsequent freeze-thaw cycles not seen to further reduce
DNA yield. For highest yield, DNA should be extracted from blood
collected in the PAXgene Blood DNA Tube prior to freezing. Up to 3
freeze-thaw cycles does not negatively affect DNA quality or performance
in molecular diagnostic test methods.”
Real time stability studies for PAXgene Blood DNA tubes:
Shelf-life stability study:
Shelf-life stability testing of the proposed tube was evaluated for 13 months at room
temperature. The sponsor tested specimens from 15 subjects using tubes and assessed
the following endpoints: For the 6 month, and 7 month timepoint, DNA eluates were
evaluated for DNA concentration and purity. For the 12 month and 13 month
timepoint, DNA eluates were evaluated for DNA concentration and purity and were
tested using a SSP HLA typing assay compared to DNA from duplicate control tubes.
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found
acceptable. Current real-time data supports a shelf-life of 12 months at ambient
temperature.
10

--- Page 11 ---
Transport simulation study: Transport stability was assessed using temperature
cycling for short durations between high (45°C ) and low (-20°C ) durations after 6 or
12 months at the recommended storage conditions. Specimens from 15 subjects were
evaluated at each time point. Using the cycling profile below:
Condition Temperature Duration

Specimens from control tubes were processed immediately after collection, and
candidate tubes were processed after temperature cycling. The resulting eluates were
evaluated for DNA concentration, purity and SSP HLA genotype assay compared to
paired specimens collected in control tubes. Stability testing protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable.
Current real-time data supports the claimed transport conditions of up to 7 days at
40°C.

Short Draw Studies:
Venous whole blood was analyzed from 10 subjects drawn into 10 candidate and 2
control tubes. From each subject, partial-filled candidate tubes were drawn in
quadruplicate for each of the two targeted fill volumes (50% and 28% of nominal
draw), and duplicate candidate and control tubes were filled to the nominal draw
volume. DNA was extracted using 2 commercially available, automated, magnetic
bead based DNA isolation kits by two operators. DNA purity, concentration and SSP
HLA genotype was evaluated on DNA from tubes collected from each subject: two
control tubes and one candidate tube from each of the targeted fill volumes (100%,
50% and 28% of nominal). The results are summarized below:
Genotyping: All HLA results generated from the samples collected in the proposed
tube for all short-draw conditions and for the nominal draw were concordant with the

The following limitation is provided by the sponsor in the device labeling to clarify
that this tube has not been validated with manual extraction methodologies:
“The PAXgene Blood DNA Tube has not been validated with DNA extraction
methods involving manual precipitation. “
Additional studies in support of the tubes:
Incomplete tube inversion:
Venous whole blood was analyzed in replicate tubes from each of 10 subjects drawn
into 8 control tubes and 8 candidate tubes. DNA from each specimen was extracted
on two instruments by two operators using a commercially available, automated,
magnetic bead based DNA isolation kit. Per subject, duplicate control and duplicate
candidate tubes were not inverted after blood collection , while the three other sets of
duplicate control and duplicate candidate tubes were inverted 1, 5, and 8 times. After
inversion, tubes were incubated at room temperature (18– 25°C) for 1 day, followed
by processing on the first day after blood collection. DNA purity, concentration and
SSP HLA genotype were assessed. The results are summarized below:
Genotyping: All HLA results generated from the samples collected in the candidate
tube which had been inverted 1x and 8x were concordant with the results obtained
from the samples obtained using the control tube which had been inverted 8x.
DNA purity: All DNA eluates extracted from the candidate tube yielded an
A260/A280 ratio range of 1.7-1.9.
DNA concentration: All DNA eluates extracted from the candidate tube yielded
DNA concentrations of ≥ 15 ng/uL.
