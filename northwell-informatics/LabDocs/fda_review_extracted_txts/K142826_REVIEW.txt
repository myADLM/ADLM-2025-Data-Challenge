L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA Centaur Toxo M assay is an immunoglobulin class-capture sandwich
immunoassay using direct, chemiluminometric technology. The anti-human IgM monoclonal
antibody is covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles in the Solid Phase. In the Lite
Reagent, the T. gondii antigen is complexed with an anti-p30 monoclonal antibody (F(ab)2
fragment) labeled with acridinium ester. Antibody-antigen complexes will form if
toxoplasma IgM is present in the sample.
ADVIA Centaur systems automatically perform the following steps for the Toxo M assay:
• Dispenses 10 μL of sample into a cuvette.
• Dispenses 340 μL of Solid Phase and incubates the mixture for 18 minutes at 37°C.
• Separates the Solid Phase from the mixture and aspirates the unbound reagent.
• Washes the cuvette with Wash 1.
• Dispenses 200 μL Lite Reagent and incubates the mixture for 18 minutes at 37°C.
• Separates the Solid Phase from the mixture and aspirates the unbound reagent.
• Washes the cuvette with Wash 1.
• Dispenses 300 μL each of Acid Reagent and Base Reagent to initiate the
chemiluminescent reaction.
• Reports results according to the selected option, as described in the system operating
instructions or in the online help system
A direct relationship exists between the amount of toxoplasma IgM activity present in the
patient sample and the amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the system. A result
of reactive (positive) or nonreactive (negative) is automatically determined using an Index
Value.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the modified ADVIA Centaur Toxo M assay was evaluated according to
CLSI EP05-A2. The study was conducted for 20 days with 2 runs per day using 1 lot
of reagents and 2 instruments. The materials tested consisted of lot-specific
5

--- Page 6 ---
calibrators, one lot of controls, and four patient samples (low positive, moderate
positive, high positive). For each run, samples were tested in duplicate. Within-run
CV and total CV were calculated. The predetermined acceptance criteria of < 10%
(with in run CV) and < 15% (total CV) for specimens ranging from 0.4 to 0.9 Index
and < 8% (with in run CV) and < 12% (total CV) for specimens > 1.0 index. The
within-run and total precision obtained with the modified ADVIA Centaur Toxo M
reagents on the ADVIA Centaur (XP) system meets acceptance criteria.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The modified ADVIA Centaur Toxo M assay is a qualitative assay. Linearity studies
are not applicable. The assay reportable range is 0.10–10.00 Index.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability:
Stability studies were performed to establish the in-use stability claims (onboard
stability and calibration interval) for modified ADVIA Centaur Toxo M reagents kept
onboard the ADVIA Centaur (XP) system. The onboard stability of the ADVIA
Centaur Toxo M reagents is 28 days with a calibration interval of 14 days. The
reagents and calibrators are stable until the date printed on the box label when stored
at 2-8°C. The claimed shelf-life of the modified ADVIA Centaur Toxo M reagents
and calibrators are 14 months.
The predetermined acceptance criteria were met and the results claim the 28-day on
board stability claim with the 14 day calibration interval for the for modified ADVIA
Centaur Toxo M reagents on the ADVIA Centaur (XP) system.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-Reactivity:
The performance of the modified ADVIA Centaur Toxo M assay was evaluated in the
presence of 204 potentially cross-reacting substances using two lots of reagent. The
results are summarized in Table 1 below.

*This sample was equivocal in lot 1 and lot 2 when tested with the modified ADVIA Centaur Toxo M assay and
negative when tested with the unmodified predicate ADVIA Centaur Toxo M assay.
The predetermined acceptance criteria were no false positive results with any
interfering disease states tested. The results demonstrated no false positives results
found, the results of the cross reactivity study were acceptable.
Endogenous Interference:
The performance of the modified ADVIA Centaur Toxo M assay was evaluated
according to CLSI EP07-A2 in the presence of low and high levels of endogenous
substances (hemoglobin, conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, triglycerides
(intralipids), and total protein). Samples in 3 matrices (serum, LiHep plasma, and
EDTA plasma) from 3 donors were spiked with toxoplasma IgM at three levels
(negative, low positive and high positive), then the potentially-interfering endogenous
substance were added. The results are pooled and summarized in Table 2 below.
The bias was calculated as follows for the low positive and high positive samples:
%Bias = (Index of Interferent-Spiked Sample – Index of Diluent-Spiked Sample)

For nonreactive specimens, all samples (serum, LiHep plasma, and EDTA plasma)
remained negative in the presence of interferents at the levels tested. For both low
positive and high positive toxoplasma IgM spiking levels in each matrix (serum,
LiHep plasma, and EDTA plasma) and across matrices, the calculated bias was below
10% for all interferents: therefore the predefined acceptance criteria of nonreactive
samples must remain nonreactive in the presence of interferents and for reactive
samples, the grand mean % difference in Index (across all 3 matrices) must be less
than 10% were met.
f. Assay cut-off:
The modifications to the ADVIA Centaur Toxo M assay did not alter the cutoff (as
reported in K010755).
• Samples with a calculated value of less than 0.9 Index are considered nonreactive
(negative).
• Samples with a calculated value between 0.9 and 0.99 Index are considered
equivocal.
• Samples with a calculated value greater than or equal to 1.0 Index are considered
reactive (positive).
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison study was conducted by assaying 1111 clinical specimens.
The testing included: 1) Panel specimens (n = 126) containing well characterized
clinical specimens and 2) Patient specimens (n = 985) consisting of prenatal
specimens, prospective, and characterized specimens with known clinical status from
various locations, including the US and France.
Specimens were assayed in single replicate on ADVIA Centaur (XP) with the
modified ADVIA Centaur Toxo M assay and the unmodified predicate ADVIA
Centaur Toxo M assay.
Table 3 shows results obtained for the 985 patient specimens. The composition of the
patient specimens is as follows:
• 98 prenatal specimens (Source: US)
• 164 prenatal specimens (Source: France)
• 507 prospective (Source: US)
• 187 characterized (Source: US)
• 25 characterized (Source: France)
• 4 characterized (Source: in-house)

4. Clinical cut-off:
The unmodified predicate ADVIA Centaur Toxo M assay was designed to have a
positive cutoff of 1.00 Index. The cutoff for the unmodified predicate ADVIA
Centaur Toxo M assay was originally established by running a known population of
1295 samples using the unmodified predicate ADVIA Centaur Toxo M assay and
adjusting the cutoff Index value between known positives and non-positives to 1.0.
The modifications to the current modified ADVIA Centaur Toxo M assay did not
alter the cutoff.
