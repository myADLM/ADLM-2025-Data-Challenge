4. Panel:
Toxicology (91)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay for Methamphetamine (Meth) and
3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is an in vitro diagnostic test that is
intended for the qualitative detection of Methamphetamine (calibrated with
Methamphetamine) and MDMA (calibrated with MDMA) at or above 500 pg/mg in
human head and body hair. To confirm a screen positive result, a more specific alternate
chemical method, such as Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) operating
in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode with deuterated internal standards is the
preferred method. Professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test
result, particularly when presumptive positive results are obtained.
This test is intended exclusively for single laboratory use only and is not intended for sale
to anyone.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate
chemical method, such as Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) operating
in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode with deuterated internal standards is the
preferred method. Professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test
result, particularly when presumptive positive results are obtained.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The screening assay is for use with an automated microplate reader capable of
measuring at 450 and 630 nm.
I. Device Description:
The assay consists of two parts; a pre-analytical hair treatment procedure (to extract
methamphetamine and MDMA from the solid hair matrix to a measurable liquid matrix), and the
screening assay. The screening assay is an Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA).
The Hair Drug Screening Assay for Methamphetamine (Meth) and 3,4-
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) uses the International Diagnostic Systems Corp

(IDS) One-Step ELISA Methamphetamine micro-plate/reagents and a micro-plate reader for the
qualitative detection of Methamphetamine in hair samples. The test system consists of micro
strip plates coated with rabbit anti-BE polyclonal antibody, enzyme conjugate (horseradish
peroxidase conjugated to Methamphetamine substrate (containing tetramethylbenzidine), and
wash solution. Cut off concentration is 500 pg/mg hair.

None referenced
L. Test Principle:
The test consists of two parts; a pre-analytical hair treatment procedure (to remove
Methamphetamine and MDMA from the solid hair matrix to a measurable liquid matrix), and
the screening assay. The screening assay is an Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay
(ELISA). Sample is added to a well of the micro strip plate and enzyme conjugate is added,
followed by incubation. During this phase the enzyme-labeled drug conjugate competes with
drug in the sample for a limited number of binding sites on the rabbit antibody-coated micro
wells. The two bind in proportion to their concentrations. A wash solution is applied to
remove any unbound materials.
Enzyme substrate solution containing a chromagen is added. The reaction is
stopped with an acid and the absorbance is read using a plate reader at 450 nm and a
background reading is also taken at 630 nm. Color intensity is inversely proportional to the
amount of drug present in the sample.

In addition to studies conducted in k101973, the sponsor performed additional cross
reactivity testing on several structurally similar compounds including ((+/-) 2, 5-
Dimethoxy-4-Bromoamphetamine, 1S, 2R (+) Ephedrine, Phentermine, R(+)
Methcathinone, and R, R (-)-Pseudoephedrine). These compounds appeared to
contribute to a Methamphetamine or MDMA positive ELISA result at -50% cutoff,
but did not show cross reactivity when tested at concentrations up to 400,000 pg/mg.
To investigate this discrepancy, cross reactivity was tested at up to 10 fold higher
concentrations. Expected results were obtained. The results are summarized in the
tables below. The tables below are also included in the device labeling.
