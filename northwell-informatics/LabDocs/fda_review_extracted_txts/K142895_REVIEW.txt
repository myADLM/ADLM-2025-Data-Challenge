L. Test Principle:
CA 125 is an antigen recognized by the monoclonal antibody OC125, produced using
cultured cells derived from ovarian serous cystadenoma as an immunogen. This is the
second-generation CA 125 assay reagent, consisting of the monoclonal antibodies OC125
and M11, used as the solid phase antibody and the labeled antibody, respectively. CA 125
can be detected in more than 80% of patients with surgically demonstrable epithelial ovarian
cancer and levels of CA 125 showed a significant correlation with clinical course in ovarian
cancer patient. Determining blood CA 125 levels is thus useful as an aid in monitoring the
course of disease and assessment of the response to therapy in ovarian cancer patients.
This CA 125 assay reagent, consisting of the monoclonal antibodies OC125 and M11, is used
as the solid phase antibody and the labeled antibody, respectively. The latter antibody was
obtained using the antigen purified with the OC125. Lumipulse G CA125II is an
immunoassay reagent for the quantitative measurement of CA 125 in specimens, based on
CLEIA (Chemiluminescent Enzyme Immunoassay) technology by a two-step sandwich
immunoassay method on the Lumipulse G1200 System as follows:
1. First reaction step: CA 125 in specimens specifically binds to anti-CA 125 monoclonal
antibody (mouse) on the particles and antigen-antibody immunocomplexes are formed.
2. Washing step: The particles are washed and rinsed to remove unbound materials.
3. Second reaction step: Alkaline phosphatase (ALP; calf)-labeled anti-CA 125 monoclonal
antibody (mouse) specifically binds to CA 125 of the immunocomplexes on the particles
and additional immunocomplexes are formed.
4. Washing step: The particles are washed and rinsed to remove unbound materials.
5. Enzyme reaction step: Substrate Solution is added and mixed with the particles. AMPPD
5

--- Page 6 ---
(AMPPD: 3-(2’-spiroadamantane)-4-methoxy-4-(3”-phosphoryloxy) phenyl-1, 2-
dioxetane disodium salt) contained in the Substrate Solution is dephosphorylated by the
catalysis of ALP indirectly conjugated to particles.
6. Luminescence measurement step: Luminescence (at a maximum wavelength of 477 nm)
is generated by the cleavage reaction of dephosphorylated AMPPD. The luminescent
signal reflects the amount of CA 125.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
i. Linearity
Four sample pools were created: a High serum and a High K2-EDTA plasma
pool, and a Low serum and a Low K2-EDTA plasma pool. The high pools were
supplemented with antigen purified from pooled patient samples to concentrations
of CA 125 of 1198.4 U/mL and 1166.8 U/mL in serum and plasma, respectively.
The low pools were prepared by using patient samples stripped of antigen to a
concentration of CA 125 of 0.1 U/mL in both low pools. Sixteen dilutions of the
high pools by the low pools were prepared covering the AMR of the assay
(2 U/mL–1000 U/mL). Neat high and low pools of each matrix type were tested
as sample 1 and sample 16 in the dilution series. The samples were assayed in
quadruplicate on a LUMIPULSE G1200 instrument and the % recovery and linear
regression were evaluated.

Weighted and unweighted linear regression was performed as the variance was
not constant across the range of the analyte. The equation for the unweighted
linear regression lines were y = 0.9973x+1.5017, R2 = 0.9999 for the serum
samples and y = 1.0147 + 3.9653, R2 = 0.9996 for the plasma samples.
These data demonstrate that the assay is sufficiently linear throughout the assay
measuring range of 2.5 to 1000.0 U/mL.
ii. Spike recovery study
A spike recovery study was performed by spiking known concentrations of
purified antigen into patient samples (serum and plasma) and assayed in triplicate
on a LUMIPULSE G1200 instrument. All samples met the manufacturer’s
acceptance criterion of recovery of 100 ±15%.

on the Lumipulse G CA125II Immunoreaction Cartridge case. The calibration
curve is created based on recorded master calibration data and the calibration data
from each calibration cycle. The CA 125 concentration of a specimen is
automatically calculated from the calibration curve. The result of the calculation
is reported in units/mL (U/mL).
Calibration of the Lumipulse G CA125II is traceable to in-house reference
calibrators, whose values have been assigned to correlate to Fujirebio Diagnostics,
Inc.’s (FDI) CA 125 II Radioimmunoassay (RIA).
Primary and secondary calibrator preparations are prepared by spiking purified
CA 125 antigen into buffer. The amount spiked is determined gravimetrically.
Dilutions at 1000, 500, 100, 50, and 20 U/mL are produced for the primary
calibrator. The secondary calibrator preparation is similarly prepared from the
stock and compared with the primary calibrator and the values adjusted to match.
The tertiary calibrators (included in the kit) are produced by spiking the purified
antigen into buffer at 1000 U/mL; the 0 calibrator is buffer alone. The values are
compared with the secondary calibrator and adjusted to match.
ii. Controls
The Quality Control material recommended by the manufacturer is the Fujirebio
Diagnostics Tumor Marker Control (TMC) (k101809) (sold separately). The
ranges established for the lots of TMC used in the studies presented here are
17.5–32.5 U/mL and 280–520 U/mL for the low and high levels, respectively.
iii. Antigens
The CA 125 II antigen used in the preparation of the calibrators and controls
is purified from cell culture supernatant of a proprietary human ovarian
carcinoma cell line maintained by Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc. The antigen is
purified through a series of steps and the purified antigen is characterized by
several QC steps.
iv. Stability
a. Shelf life: The sponsor provided data demonstrating a shelf-life stability of 10
months at 2–10° C.
b. On board: The sponsor provided data demonstrating stability of 10 months
when cartridges and calibrators were stored open under on-board conditions
(12° C). Labeling recommends calibrator storage for 30 days.
c. Transport: The sponsor provided data demonstrating the transport stability of
the instrument cartridge at 25° C, 37° C, and −20° C and the transport stability
of the calibrators at 2–10° C, 20 ± 2° C, and −20° C.
d. Calibration curve: The sponsor provided data demonstrating that the
calibration curve is stable for 30 days.
e. Sample Stability: The sponsor provided data demonstrating that samples
12

--- Page 13 ---
collected in all five matrices (Red top serum tube, SST, Li-heparin, Na-
heparin, K2-EDTA) were stable in that 88% of the samples (22/25)
demonstrated < 10% difference from Day 0 and (12 % (3/25) of the samples
demonstrated a difference of ≤ 16 % from Day 0 when stored for 10 days at
2–10° C. 100% of the samples demonstrated < 10% difference from Day 0
when stored at −20°C ± 10° C for 10 days.
f. Freeze-thaw: The sponsor provided data demonstrating that measured
concentration of CA 125 in serum and plasma samples was < 5% different
from unfrozen controls for up to ten freeze-thaw cycles when stored at −20⁰ C
and thawed at room temperature. The recommendation on the package insert
is to avoid more than six freeze-thaw cycles.
v. Hook effect
The hook effect was evaluated by spiking very high levels of purified antigen into
a pool of normal serum and diluting this with a pool of serum from which CA 125
had been depleted. The CA 125 concentrations ranged from 275,000 U/mL
through the bottom of the measuring range. All concentrations above the top of
the measuring range had RLU measurements above the top calibrator, and no
hook effect was seen at concentrations > 200,000 U/mL. There was a plateau in
the response > 20,000 U/mL; therefore, the sponsor included a statement that
results > 20,000 should be interpreted with caution.
vi. Instrument dilution study
Five patient samples with concentrations ranging from 1072.7 to 1353.0 U/mL
were diluted in Sample Diluent either 1:10 or 1:100 manually or using the
LUMIPULSE G1200 auto-dilute functions. The observed concentrations from
each sample set were compared with the expected concentrations, and the
manufacturer’s acceptance criterion was that the calculated concentration needed
to be < 10% different from the expected concentration. In addition, the difference
observed versus expected differences between the manual and the auto-dilute
methods needed to be <10% as well. Both the manual and auto-dilute methods
met the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria for 1:10 dilution for all samples;
however, the samples diluted with the auto-dilute function failed to meet the
acceptance criterion for the 1:100 dilution; therefore, manual dilution may be used
for either manual dilution is 1:10 or 1:100; however, auto-dilution may only be
used for a 1:10 dilution. This limitation is explicitly stated in the package insert.
d. Detection limit:
i. Limit of Blank (LoB)
Sixty replicates of Lumipulse G Specimen Diluent were run on each of two
LUMIPULSE G1200 instruments. The mean and SD were calculated. The LoB
was determined to be 0.1 U/mL.
13

--- Page 14 ---
ii. Limit of Detection (LoD)
A low-level panel set with concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 U/mL were
prepared from normal serum pools diluted to the desired concentration with
Lumipulse G Specimen Diluent. Thirty replicates of each were measured each of
two LUMIPULSE G1200 instruments using each of two lots, and mean and SD
were calculated for each set and overall. As the distribution was not normal and
the variances were unequal, the LoD was determined as the 5th percentile of the
observed concentrations and was 0.5 U/mL.
iii. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
The individual biases and mean biases between the target values and measured
values of each replicate of each member of the low-level sample set per
Lumipulse G CA125II Immunoreaction Cartridge lot were calculated, along
with total error and percent total error. Because the percent total error in all
cases is less than 30%, the LoQ was determined to equal the LoD, i.e., LoQ =
0.5 U/mL, and met the manufacturer’s predetermined acceptance criteria of
LoD < 2 U/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Endogenous Interference
The study was modeled after CLSI EP07-A2 Interference Testing in Clinical
Chemistry; Approved Guideline – Second Edition (2005). Four sample pools with
concentrations just above the normal range, moderately elevated, mid-range, and
near the top of the measuring range were prepared in the assay matrices with the
CA 125 concentrations shown below. These concentrations included a sample
near what is considered the limit for a normal reading (35 U/mL).

no interference was observed.

Melphalan 15 µg/mL
Methotrexate 450 µg/mL
Paclitaxel 3.5 ng/mL
Tamoxifen 60 µg/mL
The manufacturer’s acceptance criterion was that there was < 10% difference
between the spiked sample and the control sample; all samples met the criterion
and therefore no interference was observed.

2. Comparison studies
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study with 120 samples was performed on the LUMIPULSE G
1200. The concentrations of 102 of the samples spanned the range in common
between the two devices of 2.0–600.0 U/mL. Because the range of the Lumipulse G
CA125II assay is 2.5–1000.0 U/mL, whereas the range of the ADVIA Centaur only

rises to 600 U/mL, 18 samples with CA 125 concentrations above 600.0 U/mL also
were analyzed, using dilution to bring them into range of assays. Fifteen of these
were not diluted for the Lumipulse CA125II assay but were diluted for the predicate,
and three were diluted to bring them into range for both assays.
The primary analysis was conducted on the undiluted samples in the common range
of the two instruments, and the secondary analysis included the samples > 600 U/mL
that fell outside the range of the predicate. No outliers were excluded.
The manufacturer’s acceptance criteria for this study were that the Lumipulse G
CA125II assay must have a Deming regression analysis slope whose 95% confidence
interval lie entirely within the range of 0.9–1.1 and the correlation coefficient > 0.9
across the range of 2.0–600.0 U/mL when compared with the predicate device.

Both analyses had regression correlation coefficients > 0.9; however, for both
analyses the 95% CI of the slope of the Weighted Deming regression analysis fell
outside the required range of 0.9 to 1.1 and therefore exceeded the acceptance criteria.
This indicates that, according to the manufacturer’s pre-determined criteria, there is a
difference in the performance of the assays; however, this difference was deemed not
to be clinically meaningful if the same assay is always used to monitor the patient.
The sponsor included a warning in the package insert to inform the clinician that
results are not interchangeable between assay methods and only one assay should be
used for serial measurements.

b. Matrix comparison:
This study design was based on CLSI EP09-A3, Measurement Procedure and Bias
Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline – Third Edition. Five donors
each provided five tubes of blood: two serum tubes (serum control (red-top) tubes and
serum separating (SST) tubes) and three different plasma anti-coagulants (K2 EDTA,
Li-heparin, and Na-heparin). The 25 tubes were spiked with one of eight
concentrations of CA 125: 25 U/mL, 50 U/mL, 100 U/mL, 250 U/mL, 300 U/mL,
500 U/mL, 700 U/mL, and 950 U/mL, or left unspiked. This was repeated for each
tested concentration, resulting in samples from 45 different donors. Each set of
concentrations was tested in duplicate with all members of a sample set run together.
Weighted Deming regression analyses were performed to compare the results from
the different matrices to that of the samples collected in serum control tubes. The
manufacturer’s acceptance criterion was that the 95% CI for the slope must lie
entirely with the range of 0.9–1.1 and the Pearson correlation coefficient must be > 1.
The results below indicate that the results met the manufacturer’s acceptance
criterion.

All post-baseline visits were characterized by clinical disease status and by whether the
patient’s CA 125 was higher than at the previous visit. One cross tabulation was made:
disease progression as defined by the physician was related to changes in the
concentration of CA 125. From this data, the sensitivity and a specificity of the change
in CA 125 was computed. The manufacturer’s success criterion for the study was
the sum of sensitivity and specificity for progression should exceed 125%.
A total of 348 evaluable samples from 59 subjects were used for the analysis,
resulting in 289 pairs of observations. The mean number of draws per subject was
5.9, ranging from 3–20 draws. The length of time over which the subjects were
monitored ranged from 29–2446 days (median = 229 days). The median interval
between successive visits ranged from 7–1086 day (median = 35 days). The ability of
the device to distinguish between progression and no progression was evaluated.

The table below presents a summary of the CA 125 ratios (i.e., change from one
measurement to the next) between successive samples broken down by clinical
disease status. The ratio of 1.20, or 20% change, at the median is exceeded only for
progressive disease.

4. Clinical cut-off
A clinically meaningful change is defined as a reading at least 20% higher than the
previous reading.
A CA 125 reading was classified as significantly elevated if the ratio of that result to the
previous result exceeded the 95% point of the ratio of two estimates. This 95% point of
this ratio is given by 1.645 * √2 * the total CV or 8.6 = 20%. The cut-off of > 20% was
chosen to balance sensitivity and specificity.
An ROC curve for the diagnosis of progression from the ratio of successive CA 125II
readings using the 20% change cut-off was calculated. The area under the AUC curve
is 0.727 with SE 0.047.
5. Expected values/Reference range
Samples from women with cancer, other differential diagnoses or normal healthy donors
were tested to establish the reference range for the study. The samples, obtained from
commercial brokers, are listed below:

2. Software
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes __X______ or No ________
The LUMIPULSE G System software is the computer program that interprets system and
assay information, calculates results, and provides the interface for controlling the system
hardware. The software interface is the portion of the computer program which a user
operates to make selections and enter information. The interface allows users to initiate
commands or make choices by selecting icons, buttons, items from lists, etc. The
LUMIPULSE G System software interface is designed to provide consistent and easy
access to system information, software functions, and troubleshooting.
3. Specimen Identification
Patient samples are barcoded and barcodes are read by the instrument. The assay to be
performed can be identified by manual entry of the patient ID number and associated
information or information can be imported from a host computer.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling
Sample containers are set in Sample Racks. Barcode IDs attached to sample container
are read, along with the type of Sample rack and Rack ID. The operator follows the
system prompts and inputs the appropriate sample, rack, and assay information. The
LUMIPULSE G System automatically performs various processes including dispensing,
agitation, washing, photometric measurement, and result calculation.
Two methods of designating the assay to be performed are: Rack ID assay, in which the
entire rack of samples is tested by one assay (sample position in the rack is manually
entered) and Patient ID assay, in which each sample is individually designated for its own
assay. The Rack ID assay is conducted according to the Rack ID and rack position where
samples are registered during the sample registration process. Samples are manually set
in the positions in the rack where they are registered. Patient ID assay is conducted
according to the Patient ID barcode on the sample containers. Sample containers can be
set in any position of any rack.
5. Calibration
Calibrators are provided in a cartridge that bears a bar code containing lot-specific
calibration information and standard curve. The CA 125 concentration of a specimen is
automatically calculated from the calibration curve.
Recalibration is required after a pre-determined calibration interval, when 30 days have
elapsed since the previous calibration, quality control results fall out of range, or when a
new Lumipulse G CA125II Immunoreaction Cartridge lot is loaded.
6. Quality Control
Quality control materials, Tumor Markers 1 and 2, are not provided, but should be tested
22

--- Page 23 ---
at least two levels: low and high. Quality control materials must pass acceptance criteria
for the assay to proceed. If the controls fail to pass the acceptance criterion the
instrument calls out the failure by error code errors, e.g., aspiration, for operator review
and re-test if identified as such.
