H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
VALIDATE® Anemia Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Kit solutions are intended
for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of linearity, calibration
verification and verification of reportable range for the following analytes: Ferritin Set:
ferritin (FERR), Vitamin B12/ Folate Set: vitamin B12 (VIT B) and folate (FOL), on
automated instrument systems. The product is intended for use with quantitative assays
on the indicated analyzers specified in the labeling.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended use above
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use. For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Roche Cobas, Beckman Access
I. Device Description:
Each VALIDATE® Anemia Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Kit contains two analyte
sets of purified chemicals in a human serum base. The kit includes a ferritin set containing
five liquid levels, 3.0 mL each, and a Vitamin B12 /Folate set containing five liquid levels,
4.0 mL each. Prior to use, users should remove the VALIDAE Anemia materials from
storage and allow coming to room temperature. Invert gently several times before
dispensing. To maximize stability, it is recommended that exposure to room temperature be
minimized. Tightly cap opened bottles and return to -10 to -25°C immediately after
dispensing.
CAUTION POTENTIAL BIOHAZARD
Material of human origin used in the manufacture of this test kit was tested at the donor level
using FDA approved methods and was found to be non-reactive for HBsAG and to
antibodies to HCV, HIV-1 and HIV-2.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
All the analytes contained in the Validate Anemia Calibration Verification/ Linearity Test
Kit were obtained from commercially available sources.
Value Assignment:
The VALIDATE® Anemia Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Kits are
manufactured such that an equal relationship exists among Levels 1 through 5; Level
1 being the lowest concentration and Level 5 being the highest. Levels 1 and 5 are
prepared independently by the addition of specific amounts of ferritin, Vitamin B12
and folate chemicals (bought from a commercial source) to a human serum base.
Intermediate Levels 2, 3, and 4 are subsequently prepared from Levels 1 and 5 by
equal part dilutions following the CLSI EP6-A guidelines. The testing was performed
on five separate days, six replicates per analyte to have five testing events and total of
30 replicates. A total mean value, total standard deviation and total percent coefficient
of variation (CV %) for the high value level and low value level are calculated. All
values assignment results met their pre-determined acceptance criteria. Typical mean
values for each analyte for each specific instrument are provided in the package
insert. Typical mean recovery values for all levels for one representative lot are
presented in Table 1 below.

Stability:
Real-Time stability studies were conducted to support the shelf-life and open-vial
claims. The sponsor provided testing time points included date of manufacture
(DOM), followed by testing at specific intervals of 1,2,3,6,9,12,and 13 months post
manufacture. The last testing event is one month post-expiration. Acceptance
criteria and studies protocols were reviewed and found to be acceptable to support
the sponsor’s following stability claims: VALIDATE Anemia materials are stable
up to 12 months when stored between -10 to -25°C prior to opening. Open vial
stability studies support a maximum of 4 freeze/thaw cycles when materials are
stored between -10 to -25°C until the expiration date of the vials.
