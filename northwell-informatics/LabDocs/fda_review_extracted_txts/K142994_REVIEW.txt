L. Test Principle:
The IDS-iSYS Aldosterone assay is based on chemiluminescence technology. There is no
sample pre-treatment necessary for measurement of aldosterone in EDTA plasma samples.
The samples are placed into an appropriate secondary tube and then onto the IDS-iSYS
sample rack which is then loaded on the IDS-iSYS system.
The IDS-iSYS Aldosterone assay is designed in a competitive immunoassay format. A
volume of the sample is pipetted into a cuvette on the instrument’s carousel. Biotinylated
monoclonal anti-Aldosterone antibody is then added and the reaction is incubated. Following
this incubation step, an Aldosterone- acridinium-conjugate tracer is added. The acridinium
tracer will bind to any sites on the antibody not already occupied by the Aldosterone present
in the sample. The final incubation step is for the addition of Streptavidin-coupled magnetic
particles grouped with an assay buffer to increase the reaction volume and allow better
distribution of the magnetic particles within the sample. Following this third incubation step
the particles are “captured” using a magnet and undergo a series of three washing cycles. The
washing step will separate the bound from any un-bound analyte in the sample. Finally, the
addition of NaOH and H O will cause light to be emitted by the acridinium label. As the
2 2
signal generated [shown as Relative Light Units (RLUs)] comes from the Aldosterone-
acridinium-tracer, the signal will be inversely proportional to the concentration of the
analyte, Aldosterone, present in the sample.
The RLUs generated from each sample are read off a two-point calibration curve which is
adjusted using two Aldosterone calibrators and using the equation parameters of a stored
Master Curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was determined in accordance with CLSI EP5-A2.
Three lots of IDS iSYS Aldosterone assay reagents were used to assay six samples
(produced from pooled K3 EDTA plasma) over a minimum of 20 assay days on two
instruments. Samples were run in duplicates, twice a day, to provide 80 replicates
over 40 runs. Results are summarized in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed assay range for this device is 3.9 to 120ng/dL. The linear range of the
assay was determined following a protocol based on CLSI EP6-A guidelines. A high
plasma sample with Aldosterone concentrations at 133.6ng/dL was diluted with a low
sample at 2.7ng/dL at equal proportions to create 11 intermediate samples. A total of
13 samples with different concentrations of aldosterone were tested in quadruplicate
using one reagent lot . The observed concentrations were plotted against the expected
concentrations and a linear regression curve was fitted.
The overall linearity analyses were: y=1.00x-1.24, r2=1.00.
The sponsor’s claimed measuring range is 3.9 to 120 ng/dL, which was supported by
the linearity study.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The IDS-iSYS Aldosterone calibrators, controls and calibration
verifiers are traceable to in-house reference calibrators produced by dissolving
Aldosterone in Dioxane. The concentration was calculated by UV quantitation using
the molar extinction coefficient of e=15000 at an absorbance of 240nm. Preparation
was gravimetric with no adjustment.
Stability
Accelerated and Real-time stability studies were performed with the IDS-iSYS
Aldosterone reagent cartridges, calibrators and calibration verifiers. The data
demonstrate the reagent cartridges and calibrators are stable for 6 months, calibration
verifiers are stable for 15 months and controls are stable for 12 months when stored at
4°C unopened, upright and in the dark.
After reconstitution, the calibrators and kit controls may be stored for 2 hours at room
temperature and on-board the analyzer continuously for 4 hours. Calibration verifiers
may be stored on-board the analyzer continuously for 4 hours.

The stability study protocol and acceptance criteria has been provided and found to be
adequate.
Calibration frequency: A master calibration curve, generated against the internal
reference calibrators, is supplied to the user on a CD with each IDS-iSYS
Aldosterone kit. The IDS-iSYS Aldosterone kit Calibrator A and Calibrator B are
assayed in triplicate to adjust the master calibration. The sponsor recommends that
the kit controls be run in duplicate to verify the calibration at least once per day or
according to local regulations when patient samples are being assayed. The
calibration is stable for 4 days and the user will receive an automated message by the
software upon expiration.
Value Assignment:
The concentration values of the kit calibrators, controls and verifiers are assigned
through an internal procedure. To assign acceptable ranges to the kit assay controls
and calibration verifiers, each is assayed in the IDS-iSYS Aldosterone assay with On-
Board 2 point calibration. The assay controls and calibration verifiers are run in
triplicate in at least 18 assays on a total of at least three analyzers. The assigned
range is then calculated as the mean ±3SD for both controls and verifiers. The kit
calibrators are run in duplicate for 20 assays on one analyzer and the concentration
values obtained must fall within the below specified ranges.
The Kit Calibrators have the following nominal ranges:
Kit Calibrator A 5-8 ng/dL
Kit Calibrator B 85-115 ng/dL
IDS iSYS Aldosterone Control Set have the following nominal ranges:
Kit CTL1 6.5-9.5 ng/dL
Kit CTL2 12-18 ng/dL
Kit CTL3 40-65 ng/dL
IDS-iSYS Aldosterone Calibration Verifiers have the following nominal ranges:
Cal Ver 0 0.0 ng/dL
Cal Ver 1 25-35 ng/dL
Cal Ver 2 70-80 ng/dL
Cal Ver 3 125-145 ng/dL
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
were determined based on guidance from CLSI EP17-A. For one batch (MB5) LoD
and LoQ calculations, 2 replicates of 7 samples were used. The samples were tested
once per day over 8 days. Sample concentrations ranged from 2.1 to 8.8ng/dL. For
the second batch (MB6), LoD study, 8 samples were run in 2 replicates, once per
day for 5 days and for the LoQ study, 7 samples were run in 2 replicates, once per
dayfor 5 days. The LoD concentrations tested were from 0 to 8.45ng/dL. The LoQ
8

--- Page 9 ---
concentrations tested were from 1.1 to 16.38ng/dL. LoB was calculated using an
EDTA plasma sample with zero aldosterone tested in 5 replicates over 5 days. LoQ
was defined as the lowest concentration for which an imprecision level of less than
20% CV. The highest values taken from the two lots of reagents were used to
determine the detection limits values for LoB, LoD, and LoQ.
The LoB, LoD and LoQ results are summarized below:
LoB 2.0ng/dL
LoD 3.2ng/dL
LoQ 3.9ng/dL
The claimed measuring range of the device is 3.9 to 120ng/dL for EDTA plasma.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed interference and cross-reactivity studies in accordance with
CLSI guidance EP7-A2. To determine potential interference in the specific detection
of Aldosterone, two base plasma samples, one in the range of approximately 10ng/dL
Aldosterone (“Low”) and another at approximately 40ng/dL (“High”), were spiked
with the potential interferent. Control samples (blank) were spiked with a volume of
relevant diluent equal to that of the spiked interferent. The mean of 26 replicates, for
both spiked and control samples (Blank), were then compared. One reagent batch was
used for interference testing. The differences observed between the mean spiked and
control sample values were examined and assessed according to acceptance criteria of
≤10% concentration bias to the unspiked sample. Results of non-significant
interference are summarized in the table below:

“In patients receiving therapy with a high biotin dose (i.e. >5 mg/day), no sample
should be taken until at least 8 hours after the last biotin administration.”
Cross Reactivity:
A cross reactivity study was performed using other endogenous steroids and some
commonly used anti-hypertensive medication according to CLSI EP 7-A2 guidelines.
Stock concentrations of the substances to be checked for cross-reactivity were
prepared initially in an organic solvent. A commercially available blank serum
sample was used to spike the potentially cross-reacting substances. Cross reactivity
was assessed using one reagent lot. Cross reactivity was defined as the point where
the reduction in signal corresponds to 50% of the signal achieved in the absence of
analyte, as a percentage of the analyte concentration giving the same fall in signal.
Percent cross reactivity calculation is as follows:
%cross reactivity = ED50 (ng/dL) Aldosterone / ED50 (ng/dL) compound.
The results demonstrated that all substances showed <0.001% cross reactivity with
the exception of 18-OH-Corticosterone and 3a, 5b-tetrahydroaldosterone.

samples were used in the correlation studies across both methods, following the
manufacturers’ instructions. 12 of the total samples were diluted in order to achieve
the hard to find sample range. Sample range tested was 3.9-110.9ng/dL on the IDS
iSYS Aldosterone assay and was 3.0-98.0 on the comparative device. Regression
analysis is summarized below:
Passing-Bablok linear regression analysis resulted the following:
Slope (95% CI) Intercept (95% CI)
1.070 (1.043 to 1.096) -0.29 (-0.98 to 0.46)
Linear regression analysis resulted the following:
Slope (95% CI) Intercept (95% CI) r2
1.053 (1.029 to 1.076) 0.09 (-0.86 to 1.05) 0.980

5. Expected values/Reference range:
A reference range study was performed using healthy adults between 18 to 65 years old
according to the CLSI C28-A guideline. Subjects have normal blood pressure and
normal BMI. The exclusion criteria include aged below 18 or older than 65, need for
prescription medications for chronic diseases, need for doctor prescribed restricted diet,
pregnancy, breastfeeding or chronic diseases. Blood collection takes place between
7:00am and 10am after an overnight fasting with the same subjects in two positions:
upright and supine. Upright samples were collected after walking and standing for a
minimum of 30 minutes. Supine samples were collected after lying down for at least 30
minutes.
228 samples were assessed for the reference range determination. These samples were
assessed using MB1 only but on multiple machines and assessed by multiple operators.
4 subgroups (male supine, male upright, female supine and female upright) were
analyzed. The observed mean and central 95% reference intervals for upright and supine
positions are listed below.

Upright (male) 61 7.8 4.8 <3.9 -23.2
All supine 111 7.5 7.73 <3.9 -31.1
All upright 117 10.6 9.38 <3.9 -44.3
The package insert recommends that “each laboratory should determine reference ranges
for their local population”.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
