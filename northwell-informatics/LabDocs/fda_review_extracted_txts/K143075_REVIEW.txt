4. Special instrument requirements:
Tosoh AIA-2000 System Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The ST AIA-PACK SHBG consists of 5 trays of 20 test cups which contain twelve
lyophilized magnetic beads coated with anti-SHBG mouse monoclonal antibody and 100 µL
of anti-SHBG mouse monoclonal antibody conjugated to bovine alkaline phosphatase with
sodium azide as a preservative.
ST AIA-PACK Sample Diluting Solution (sold separately) consists of a protein matrix with
no detectable concentration of SHBG with sodium azide as a preservative.
The ST AIA-PACK SHBG Calibrator Set contains a protein matrix with assigned levels of
sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). The calibrator set contains six levels of calibrators
with the following SHBG concentrations: 0, 0.10, 0.30, 1.25, 6.25, and 15.0 nmol/L. The
calibrators are supplied at a 1:20 dilution; therefore, the measured concentrations would be
equivalent to 0, 2.0, 6.0, 25.0, 125.0, and 300 nmol/L after the analyzer performs an
automatic multiplication by a factor of 20.
Each serum/plasma donor unit used in the preparation of these products has been tested by an
U.S. FDA approved method and found to be non-reactive for the presence of the antibody to
Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 and 2, the Hepatitis B surface antigen, and the antibody to
Hepatitis C.

enzyme-labeled antibody and are then incubated with a fluorogenic substrate, 4-
methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4MUP). The amount of enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody
that binds to the beads is directly proportional to the SHBG concentration in the test sample.
A standard curve is constructed, and unknown sample concentrations are calculated using
this curve. The concentration of range of the calibration curve is displayed in 1/20th of the
assay range in patient specimens. The concentrations of patient specimens and control
material are calculated by multiplying the concentrations obtain on the calibration curve with
the dilution factor. The AIA-2000 analyzer will automatically calculate the concentrations of
patient samples and controls using the dilution factor and report the results.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was assessed by assaying three levels of serum and Na-heparin plasma
samples. The precision for the ST AIA-PACK SHBG assay was evaluated using
three AIA-2000 analyzers and three different lots of reagent for both serum and Na-
heparin plasma samples. Total and within run precision were obtained from
measurements of 2 replicates in a single run, 2 times a day for 20 non-consecutive
days (n=80).
The precision results for each of the three lots assayed were similar. The study results
of one representative lot are provided in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed in accordance to CLSI EP6-A for both serum and
Na-heparinized plasma samples. For both serum and Na-heparin plasma, a total of
eleven samples ranging from 0.07 to 257 nmol/L SHBG were prepared from
performing intermediate dilutions of a low-level and a high-level SHBG sample. The
linearity of the ST AIA-PACK SHBG assay was evaluated in a single study,
performed on one day, using one AIA-2000 analyzer. Each of the eleven linearity
samples was run in replicates of four. The mean, SD and CV% were calculated for
each replicate. The linear regression analysis results are summarized below:
Serum: y = 1.038x – 1.4013, R2 = 0.9924
Na-Heparin Plasma: y =1.001x – 0.6649, R2 = 0.9997
The linearity results for both serum and Na-heparin plasma support the claimed
measuring range of this assay (0.2- 250 nmol/L).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The ST AIA-PACK SHBG calibrators have been standardized against WHO (Sex
Hormone Binding Globulin 2nd International Standard NIBSC Code 08/266 (version

2.0, dated 03/28/2013). The calibrators are a gravimetrically prepared dilution of
human serum SHBG antigen with buffered bovine serum base.
Value assignment:
The values of the product calibrator were assigned using two AIA 2000 analyzers
with three lots of reagents with 5 replicate runs per calibrator (n=30). The values are
verified by an internal procedure and must meet specifications. The target values for
the calibrators are as follows:
ST AIA-PACK SHBG Calibrator 1: 0.10 nmol/L
ST AIA-PACK SHBG Calibrator 2: 0.30 nmol/L
ST AIA-PACK SHBG Calibrator 3: 1.25 nmol/L
ST AIA-PACK SHBG Calibrator 4: 6.25 nmol/L
ST AIA-PACK SHBG Calibrator 5: 15.0 nmol/L
Stability:
Real time stability studies were performed to determine the shelf-life stability and the
open-vial stability of the ST AIA-PACK SHBG Calibrators. The stability study
protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and were found to be adequate to
support the sponsor’s following stability claims:
The ST AIA-PACK SHBG Calibrator Set is stable for 12 months when stored at
2-8o C (shelf life) and for 24 hours after reconstitution when stored at 2-8o C (open-
vial).
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB):
Four lots of calibrator 1(blank samples) were measured in 60 replicates. The
following equation was used to determine the LoB:
LoB= Result at Position [NB(p/100)=0.5] where p represents the 95th percentile and
NB represent the number of replicates.
The LoB was determined to be 0.017 nmol/L
Limit of Detection (LoD):
To determine the LoD, the standard deviation of the sample measurements was
obtained from 12 measurements of 10 low-level human serum samples by running
four replicates over a period of three days. The following equation was used to
calculate the LoD: LoD = LoB + CB x SDs where CB represents the value derived
from 95th percentile of the standard distribution.
The LoD was determined to be 0.063 nmol/L
7

--- Page 8 ---
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ):
To determine the LoQ, sample measurements was obtained from 12 measurements of
5 low level human serum samples by running four replicates over a period of three
days using 2 lots of reagent. The LoQ of 0.2 nmol/L was based on a percent total
error of 12%. The LoQ was determined to be 0.20 nmol/L
Detection Limits:
LoB LoD LoQ
0.017 nmol/L 0.063 nmol/L 0.20 nmol/L
The claimed measuring range of the assay is 0.2 to 250 nmol/L
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity to structurally similar endogenous steroids with the ST AIA-PACK
SHBG assay was determined by spiking human serum samples with each compound
and comparing the SHBG results to a control sample spiked with an equivalent
volume of sample diluting solution. The cross reactivity study was performed at one
site using one AIA-2000 analyzer and one lot of reagent. The sponsor’s defined
significant cross reactivity as ≥ ±10% of the control value. The equation that was
used to calculate % cross reactivity is as follows:
Cross-reactivity (%) = (Conc. of spiked sample- Conc. of non-spiked sample) x 100
Conc. of cross-reactant
