H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) is a multiplexed nucleic acid test intended for use
with FilmArray Systems for the simultaneous qualitative detection and identification of
multiple respiratory viral and bacterial nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS)
obtained from individuals suspected of respiratory tract infections. The following
organism types and subtypes are identified using the FilmArray RP: Adenovirus,
Coronavirus 229E, Coronavirus HKU1, Coronavirus NL63, Coronavirus OC43, Human
Metapneumovirus, Influenza A, Influenza A subtype H1, Influenza A subtype H3,
Influenza A subtype 2009 H1, Influenza B, Parainfluenza Virus 1, Parainfluenza Virus 2,
Parainfluenza Virus 3, Parainfluenza Virus 4, Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus,
Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and
Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The detection and identification of specific viral and bacterial
nucleic acids from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory infection
aids in the diagnosis of respiratory infection if used in conjunction with other clinical
and epidemiological information. The results of this test should not be used as the sole
basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other management decisions. Negative results in the
setting of a respiratory illness may be due to infection with pathogens that are not
detected by this test or, lower respiratory tract infection that is not detected by a
nasopharyngeal swab specimen. Positive results do not rule out co-infection with other
organisms: the agent(s) detected by the Film Array RP may not be the definite cause of
disease. Additional laboratory testing (e.g. bacterial and viral culture,
immunofluorescence, and radiography) may be necessary when evaluating a patient with
possible respiratory tract infection.
Due to the small number of positive specimens collected for certain organisms
during the prospective clinical study, performance characteristics for Bordetella
pertussis, Coronavirus 229E, Coronavirus OC43, Influenza A H1, Influenza A H3,
Influenza A H1-2009, Influenza B, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Parainfluenza Virus 1,
Parainfluenza Virus 2, and Parainfluenza Virus 4 were established primarily with
retrospective clinical specimens. Performance characteristics for Chlamydophila
pneumoniae were established primarily using contrived clinical specimens.
Due to the genetic similarity between Human Rhinovirus and Enterovirus, the FilmArray
RP cannot reliably differentiate them. A positive FilmArray RP Rhinovirus/Enterovirus
result should be followed-up using an alternate method (e.g., cell culture or sequence

--- Page 3 ---
analysis).
The FilmArray RP assay for Coronavirus OC43 may cross-react with some isolates of
Coronavirus HKU1. A dual positive result may be due to cross-reactivity or may
indicate a co- infection.
Performance characteristics for Influenza A were established when Influenza A 2009
H1N1, A H1, and A H3 were the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation.
Performance of detecting Influenza A may vary if other Influenza A strains are circulating
or a novel Influenza A virus emerges. If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is
suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by
public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control
precautions for novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments
for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is
available to receive and culture specimens.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
This device is for prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
FilmArray Instrument or FilmArray 2.0
I. Device Description:
The FilmArray Respiratory Panel is a multiplex nucleic acid test designed to be used with
FilmArray system. The FilmArray RP pouch contains freeze-dried reagents to perform nucleic
acid purification, reverse transcription, and nested, multiplex PCR with DNA melt analysis.
FilmArray RP simultaneously conducts 20 tests for the identification of respiratory pathogens
from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) obtained from individuals suspected of respiratory tract
infections (Table 1). Results from the FilmArray RP test are available within about one hour.

A test is initiated by loading Hydration Solution and an unprocessed patient nasopharyngeal
swab (NPS) specimen (i.e. specimen mixed with Sample Buffer) into the FilmArray RP pouch.
The pouch contains all reagents required for specimen testing and analysis in a freeze- dried
format; the addition of Hydration Solution and specimen/Sample Buffer Mix rehydrates the
reagents. After the pouch is prepared, the FilmArray software guides the user though the steps
of placing the pouch into the instrument, scanning the pouch barcode, entering the sample
identification, and initiating the run.
The FilmArray instrument contains a coordinated system of inflatable bladders and seal points,
which act on the pouch to control the movement of liquid between the pouch blisters. When a
bladder is inflated over a reagent blister, it forces liquid from the blister into connecting
channels. Alternatively, when a seal is placed over a connecting channel it acts as a valve to open
or close a channel. In addition, electronically controlled pneumatic pistons are positioned over
multiple plungers in order to deliver the rehydrated reagents into the blisters at the appropriate
times. Two Peltier devices control heating and cooling of the pouch to drive the PCR reactions
and the melt curve analysis.
Nucleic acid extraction occurs within the FilmArray pouch using mechanical and chemical lysis
followed by purification using standard magnetic bead technology. After extracting and
purifying nucleic acids from the unprocessed sample, a nested multiplex PCR is executed in two
stages. During the first stage, a single, large volume, highly multiplexed reverse transcription
PCR (rt-PCR) reaction is performed. The products from first stage PCR are then diluted and
combined with a fresh, primer-free master mix and a fluorescent double stranded DNA binding
dye (LC Green® Plus, BioFire Defense, LLC). The solution is then distributed to each well of the

array. Array wells contain sets of primers designed specifically to amplify sequences internal to
the PCR products generated during the first stage PCR reaction. The 2nd stage PCR, or nested
PCR, is performed in singleplex fashion in each well of the array. At the conclusion of the 2nd
stage PCR, the array is interrogated by melt curve analysis for the detection of signature
amplicons denoting the presence of specific targets. A digital camera placed in front of the array
captures fluorescent images of the PCR reactions and software interprets the data.
The FilmArray software automatically interprets the results of each DNA melt curve analysis
and combines the data with the results of the internal pouch controls to provide a test result for
each organism on the panel.

L. Test Principle:
The FilmArray RP System is multiplex nucleic acid test system composed of the FilmArray
instrument, the FilmArray software (preinstalled on a laptop computer) and the FilmArray RP
pouch. The FilmArray RP pouch contains freeze-dried reagents to perform nucleic acid
purification, reverse transcription, and nested, multiplex PCR with DNA melt analysis. A
FilmArray test is initiated by loading water and a patient NPS sample mixed with the provided
Sample Buffer into the FilmArray RP pouch and placing it in the FilmArray instrument. This
process is simplified by the use of a specifically designed pouch loading station. After the pouch
is prepared, the FilmArray software guides the user though the steps of placing the pouch in the
instrument, scanning the pouch barcode, entering the sample identification, and initiating the run.
Please refer to previously cleared submissions k103175, k110764, k120267 and k123620 for
additional information.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The scope of this 510(k) submission is limited to presenting supporting data to obtain FDA
clearance for use of the RP Panel with the BioFire Multi-instrument FilmArray 2.0 system (i.e.
modified system) using two different methods to place sample into the pouch; the syringe
method, which is the method used in the predicate (K123620) and the injection vial, which is an
improved more simplified way of introducing sample to the pouch. Currently the other
FilmArray assays use the injection vial.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The goal of this study was to demonstrate that the performance of the FilmArray
Respiratory Panel (RP) was highly reproducible when evaluated on the modified
system in conjunction with both the current (syringe) and modified (injection vial)
pouch loading procedures. Testing was performed at three sites by multiple operators
using three different pouch lots over the course of five days, 3sites x 2 operators x 3
lots x 5 days =90 replicates per condition.
Reproducibility of the FilmArray RP was evaluated for a subset of four RP analytes
representative of the types of organism(s) detected by the panel; bacteria (Bordatella
pertussis) and both DNA (Adenovirus C1) and RNA (Influenza A H1N1 2009, RSV
A) viruses. Each analyte was evaluated in a viral transport medium (VTM) sample
matrix at different concentrations; Moderate Positive (3xLoD), Low Positive
(1xLoD), and Negative. For each pouch loading procedure, a total of 90 replicates per
concentration were tested and the observed tests were compared to the expected
results to calculate percent agreement with the expected results and the corresponding
95% confidence interval. The study design was similar to the original RP
reproducibility evaluation performed in k123620.
The following table shows the summary of results for the reproducibility study. The
results show that the assay had appropriate reproducibility at both the external clinical
sites (sites A and B) and the in-house laboratory (site C). The reproducibility of the
predicate system from submission k103175 is listed in the last column of the table as

reference to the original reproducibility. The reproducibility for this device is
acceptable. The instances where the expected result differed from the actual result
are within what is reasonable for C and C samples.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There are no changes to the traceability, stability or controls for the modified assay.
Please refer to previously FDA-cleared 510(k) Premarket Notifications, k103175,
k110764, k120267 and k123620.
d. Detection limit:
Performance of the current FilmArray system and the modified system with both
poach loading procedures was evaluated at high and low analyte levels. All three
systems were tested at 10xLoD, 1xLoD, 0.1xLoD and 0.01xLoD based on LoD data
from the predicate device. The samples were generated by titration of the stock
source and the titers tested are listed below.

Once initial testing confirmed that the detection of all analytes was equivalent
between the configurations at each concentration additional side-by-side testing was
performed with 20 replicates at 1xLoD shown below (and 10 replicates at 0.1xLoD,
not shown). Testing confirmed the LoD for all systems and loading procedures were
the same as the previously determined LoD titer.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The specimens used for this study were previously obtained during the original
FilmArray RP prospective clinical evaluations. These specimens were supplemented
with archived specimens collected from external medical facilities and reference
laboratories to increase the number of positives for low prevalence analytes being
tested. A total of 100 specimens were selected that represented 3-5 positives for each
analyte targeted by the FilmArray RP. Specimens with more than one positive
analyte result were not excluded and there was no effort to choose higher analyte
level specimens. During the course of testing, it was discovered that some specimens
had either been mislabeled by the source laboratory and found to contain analytes
other than what had been indicated or the analyte of interest was not present. When
the analyte of interest was not present in all three testing systems the specimen was
excluded from analysis. In order to ensure that at least three positive detections were
observed for each analyte, two additional B. pertussis specimens were added to
sample set at the end of testing. FilmArray operators were unaware of the analyte
content of these two extra specimens at the time of testing. Therefore, the total
number of specimens tested in the study was 102.The following is a summary of the
specimens selected for this study.

All specimens were assigned a new study code number (SCN) in order to randomize
and blind the known analyte content to the operators. This allowed for specimens
which are positive for one (or multiple) panel member analyte(s) to be followed by
samples which were anticipated to be negative for the same panel member analyte(s).
In this way, the carryover potential of the new design was further evaluated.
Specimens were thawed for testing and then split into three different aliquots for
testing with the current system with syringes (CS + S), the modified system with
syringes (MS + S), and the modified system with FAIVs (MS + F).

Test results were then analyzed to compare system performance ( ; where the
system is the only variable compared), loading tools performance ( ; where
loading tools are the only variable compared), and multifactor performance ( ;
where both system and loading tool variables are compared).
For the current system, a total of 108 FilmArray runs were attempted, 104 of which
were completed (96.3%; 104/108). There were two run failures each for software
(1.9%) and instrument (1.9%) errors. No control failures were observed. Two
specimens were retested due to Influenza A ‘equivocal’ results. For the Modified
System (paired with syringe and FAIV loading) a total of 205 FilmArray runs were
attempted, all of which were completed (100%; 205/205). There were no control
failures. One specimen tested with the FAIV loading tools was retested due to an
Influenza A ‘equivocal’ result. All specimens were of sufficient volume that retesting
was possible in order to obtain valid runs for all testing configurations.
