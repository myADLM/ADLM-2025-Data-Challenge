510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
K143178
B. Purpose for Submission:
Premarket notification for the FilmArray 2.0 is intended for use with FDA cleared or
approved assays which have been cleared or approved for use on the FilmArray 2.0.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
BioFire Diagnostics, LLC
The FilmArray 2.0 is composed of the FilmArray 2.0 instrument and FilmArray software.
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
The tests consist of multi-step chemical processes designed to isolate and detect nucleic acid
targets using nested amplification followed by DNA melt curve analysis detection in an array
format.
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The multi-instrument FilmArray 2.0 is composed of a computer pre-installed with
FilmArray Software, a computer stand and printer, a barcode scanner, an external
Ethernet switch that allows up to eight instruments to connect to a single computer, and
an optional modular rack system to stack multiple instruments. The modular rack system
will hold the instruments at a 15° angle. The functional specifications of the individual
FilmArray 2.0 instruments (including the steps in the testing process and the data
interpretation) are unchanged with respect to the original FilmArray 2.0 instrument.
2. Principles of Operation:
The FilmArray 2.0 is an automated in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device designed to work
with panel specific reagent pouches to detect multiple nucleic acid targets in clinical
specimens. The FilmArray 2.0 instrument interacts with the reagent pouch to purify
nucleic acids and amplify targeted nucleic acid sequences using nested multiplex PCR in
a closed system. The resulting PCR products are evaluated using DNA melting analysis.
The FilmArray Software automatically determines the results and provides a test report.
In order to support higher throughput testing the FilmArray 2.0 was developed to support
1

--- Page 2 ---
up to eight instruments connected to one computer and a holding rack. The FilmArray 2.0
was designed to reduce the system footprint, support increased through-put, and update
data management capabilities.
3. Modes of Operation:
The instrument Dashboard serves as a home screen from which the operator can navigate
to instrument Control for individual instruments. The instrument Dashboard is designed
to display instrument details and information (e.g. status and availability) for up to eight
instruments. The instrument Dashboard allows the operator to view the status of each
instrument in the system, view the status of all testing runs (e.g., run details such as
sample ID, operator, time remaining and estimated time of completion, and if the test
report is available), and navigation to instrument Control. An instrument Information
button is available on the dashboard that allows an operator to retrieve error messages
and other information associated with an individual instrument.
4. Specimen Identification:
Once the pouch is inserted, the FilmArray Software prompts the operator to scan the
pouch barcode (which contains the pouch identification information, including the pouch
type and serial number), enter the sample ID, and enter the operator ID and password.
When all required information has been entered, the user closes the FilmArray 2.0
instrument lid and clicks “Start Run”
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
See assay specific labeling for specimen sampling and handling recommendations.
6. Calibration:
The FilmArray 2.0 does not require reagent specific set-up, calibration, or cleaning
procedures in order to perform testing with different reagent panels. The optics system
contained in the FilmArray 2.0 instrument is aligned, focused, and calibrated at the
manufacturer. Proper operation and calibration of instrument optics is monitored by
automated on-board self-tests and pouch control reactions. The barcode reader can be
calibrated if there is a functional error. Bar code calibration instructions are provided in
the operator’s manual.
7. Quality Control:
See assay specific labeling for quality control information.
8. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and Software Development processes for
this line of product types:

Yes X or No
Level of Concern: Moderate
Software Description:
The FilmArray 2.0 is controlled by Windows-based software running on a computer
configured with a standard version of Microsoft Windows Operating system (Windows
7). The FilmArray Software interfaces with the operator to control the instrument, collect
data, report test results, and save and retrieve test data from the database. In addition to
the FilmArray Software, each reagent pouch requires a specific FilmArray Software
pouch module. The pouch module interacts with the FilmArray Software and provides
pouch-specific instructions, including the definition of a pouch, the information required
to run a pouch on an instrument, analysis instructions used to interpret the data from a run
and to display the results, and instructions for generating the test report. Pouch modules
are developed and deployed independently of the core software. Each pouch module
contains information necessary to perform a test with the corresponding test panel.
Device Hazard Analysis:
Part of the software and firmware development process includes performing a risk
analysis to identify risks, their possible causes, and appropriate controls. Risk
Management of the FilmArray Software and Firmware followed the processes stated to
comply with ISO 14971:2012, Medical devices – application of risk management to
medical devices. In brief, risk management started by identifying the hazards associated
with the use of the system. The identified hazards fell into four categories: false positive
results, false negative results, assay reporting errors, and delayed test results. Risk scores
were calculated as a function of severity and the likelihood of occurrence. After
mitigation, all hazards associated with the FilmArray Software have the lowest Risk
score as defined by the Firm.
Software Requirements Specification:
Requirements for the FilmArray Software were derived from the system-level design
inputs document that describes the instrument and software. The design inputs were
converted into high-level software requirements that describe the overall function of the
software.
After the high-level requirements were determined, detailed specifications, called
subsystem requirements, were developed that describe the function of the software.
Appropriate teams reviewed and approved the specification documents, and they were
used to drive both the software development and testing processes.
Requirements for the FilmArray Firmware were also derived from the system-level
design inputs document. The design inputs were converted into high-level instrument
requirements that describe the overall function of the instrument. The instrument
requirements then drove the detailed firmware specifications. The firmware was
3

--- Page 4 ---
developed to meet these specifications.
Architecture Design Chart:
A high-level architecture design chart for the FilmArray Software was provided.
Additional information about the architecture of the FilmArray Software, including state
diagrams and flow charts were provided.
Software Design Specification:
During software and firmware development, detailed development documents were
written, formally reviewed, and approved by the project manager and technical leads.
These development documents were the design specifications which drove the software
and firmware development, dictated the behavior of the modules, and formed the basis of
design verification. A complete list of software and firmware design specifications for the
FilmArray Software was provided.
Traceability Analysis:
The software traceability analysis was conducted according to procedures defined in the
submitted Standard Operating Procedures documentation. FilmArray Software risk
analysis links potential hazards to the software requirements that are designed to mitigate
each of the identified hazards. A number of individual trace matrices are compiled into a
master trace matrix linking each of the FilmArray software requirements to the
verification test cases or the validation test cases.
Firmware traceability is conducted according to procedures defined internal to the Firm
with each firmware requirement tracing to an associated verification test case.
Software Development Environment:
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) was a modified waterfall method with
frequent specification modifications and review. Design inputs cascaded into high-level
requirements, software specifications, design specifications, and test cases. However, the
waterfall method was modified to allow for changes to requirements at any time before
validation. When changes occurred, the process repeated to ensure documentation of
dependent features was updated.
The FilmArray Software was written in an object-oriented style using .NET technology
and the C# programming language. The software is based on the FilmArray shell
application that uses the Composite Application Library from Microsoft to dynamically
discover and configure loosely coupled modules at run time. The analysis software for
FilmArray was written in MatLab.
Firmware development follows a V-model method with frequent reviews. system-level
design inputs lead to high-level instrument requirements, firmware specifications, and
verification test cases. Changes to requirements may occur at any time up to firmware
verification.

--- Page 5 ---
Verification and Validation:
Verification of the FilmArray Software consisted of automated scripts and manual test
cases designed to test requirements of the software. To verify software to instrument
interactions, the automated test suite requires an instrument simulator. The simulator is a
software program written to mimic the FilmArray 2.0 instrument. The simulator accepts
instructions from the software and sends messages and data in return.
For requirements not easily tested through automated scripts, manual test cases were
written, approved, and executed to verify the software. Both automated and manual test
cases were used to ensure complete coverage of the software requirements.
The system level software validation was performed by laboratory personnel who execute
formal written test cases that validate each of the high level requirements. This testing
uses production pouches and instruments, and provides an independent software
validation. In addition to the test cases, laboratory personnel assess whether the software
meets personal usability criteria not captured in the specifications. A validation test report
is created at the end of the testing phase. Because the firmware is used to perform this
system level testing, the software validation also serves to validate the firmware.
Revision Level History:
There is one released version of the FilmArray software.

All software defects were evaluated during software design reviews and tracked using
unique identifiers. Four minor defects were reported which required no mitigation. One
defect was reported as “the instrument lost power during a run, which resulted in the loss of
that run. The user was able to run the pouch again because the pouch serial number was not
in the database.” This hazard associated with this defect was mitigated by the adding
specific instructions for pouch handling after loss of power during a run to the product
labeling.
