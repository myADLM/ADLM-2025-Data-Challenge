2. Indication(s) for use:
Healgen Amphetamine Test
Healgen Amphetamine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative
determination of Amphetamine in human urine at a Cut-Off concentration of 1000
ng/mL. The test is available in a Strip format, a Cassette format, a Dip Card format and a
Cup format.
The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should
be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is
positive.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. It is intended for over-the-counter and for prescription
use.
Healgen Oxycodone Test
Healgen Oxycodone Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative
determination of Oxycodone in human urine at a Cut-Off concentration of 100 ng/mL.
The test is available in a Strip format, a Cassette format, a Dip Card format and a Cup
format.
The test may yield preliminary positive results even when prescription drug Oxycodone
is ingested, at prescribed doses; it is not intended to distinguish between prescription use
or abuse of this drug. There is no uniformly recognized cutoff concentration level for
Oxycodone in urine. The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result.
GC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional
judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the
preliminary result is positive.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. It is intended for over-the-counter and for prescription
use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For over the counter (OTC) and prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable. The devices are visually read single-use devices.

I. Device Description:
The Healgen Amphetamine Test and Healgen Oxycodone Test come in four formats: Strip,
Cassette, Cup, and Dip Card. The Healgen tests use a lateral flow system for the qualitative
detection of Amphetamine and Oxycodone in human urine. The tests are intended for use as
the first step in a two-step process to provide consumers with information concerning the
presence or absence of the above stated drugs in a urine sample. Information regarding
confirmatory testing – the second step in the process is provided in the instructions for use.

L. Test Principle:
The Healgen Amphetamine and Oxycodone Urine Tests use a lateral flow system for the
qualitative detection of Amphetamine and Oxycodone in human urine. Each assay uses a
monoclonal anti-mouse antibody-dye conjugate against the drugs containing gold chloride
and fixed drug-protein conjugates and anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody in the test
membranes.
When the absorbent end of the tests are immersed into the urine specimen, the urine is
absorbed into the devices by capillary action, mixes with the antibody-dye conjugate, and
flows across the pre-coated membrane. When sample drug levels are zero or below the target
Cut-Off, antibody-dye conjugate binds to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test
Region (T) of the devices. This produces a colored Test line that, regardless of its intensity,
indicates a negative result.
When sample drug levels are at or above the target Cut-Off, the free drug in the sample binds
to the antibody-dye conjugate preventing the antibody-dye conjugate from binding to the
drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the devices. This prevents the
development of a distinct colored band in the test region, indicating a preliminary positive
result.
To serve as a procedure control, a colored line will appear at the Control Region (C), if the
tests have been performed properly because of the antibody-dye conjugate binding to anti-
mouse IgG immobilized in the Control Region(C) of the devices.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision performance of the Healgen Amphetamine and Oxycodone tests was
evaluated using 3 lots for each format (Strip, Cassette, Cup, Dip Card) of the device.
Each lot was evaluated by a different operator. The testing consisted of analyzing
samples in 2 runs per day for 25 days (n = 50 per lot) and by spiking drug free urine
samples to achieve 100% cut off, -75% cut off, -50% cut off, -25% cut off, +25% cut
off, +50% cut off , +75% cut off and +100% cut off drug concentrations. Each drug
concentration was confirmed by GC/MS. Results are summarized below for each lot
and device.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
External control materials are not supplied with the devices; however, the package
inserts provides information on how to obtain control materials.
Stability protocols and acceptance criteria of all test formats were reviewed and
deemed acceptable. The stability information supports the claimed shelf life of 24
months at 4 to 30 ºC. The information also supports that the devices are stable for 35
days when exposed to extreme transport temperatures of -20 ºC to 40 ºC.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable. The assays are intended for qualitative use.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was evaluated by spiking various concentrations of similarly
structured drug compounds into drug-free urine using three lots of each device for all
formats. Results are expressed as a minimum concentration of metabolite or
compound required to produce a response approximately equivalent to the cutoff
concentration of the assay. The percent cross-reactivity of those compounds is listed
below:

Specific Gravity and pH studies:
Twelve urine samples with specific gravity ranges (1.000-1.035) were collected and
spiked with each drug at 25% below and 25% above cutoff levels. Each sample was
tested using three lots of each format of the test devices. The results showed that a
specific gravity range of 1.000 to 1.035 does not affect the accuracy of the tests.
A negative urine pool was adjusted to a pH range of 4.00 to 9.00 in 1 pH unit
increments and was spiked with each drug at 25% below and 25% above cutoff
levels. Samples were tested using three lots of each format of the devices, and results
showed that urine pH range of 4.00 to 9.00 does not affect the accuracy of the
accuracy of the tests.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cutoff characterization study was performed using the Healgen
Amphetamine Test and the Healgen Oxycodone Test with three lots for each format
(Cup, Dip Card, Cassette, and Strip format) by three operators. The study samples
were made by spiking drug-free urine samples (confirmed by GC/MS) with known
amounts of amphetamine or oxycodone. Results are shown in the tables below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison for the Healgen Amphetamine Test and the Healgen
Oxycodone Test was performed internally against the reference method, GC/MS.
Operators ran 80 unaltered urine samples on each format of the devices, where each
device format was tested by an independent set of three operators. The samples were
masked and randomized prior to testing and device results were compared to GC/MS.
The results are presented in the table below:

the four formats (Strip, Cassette, Dip Card, Cup) of the Healgen Amphetamine Test
and the Healgen Oxycodone Test (140 readers across three sites x 4 formats x 2
analytes = 1120). The participants had diverse educational and professional
backgrounds and ranged in age from 21 to 63 years. Urine samples were prepared at
the following concentrations; negative, ±75%, ±50%, ±25% of the cutoff by spiking
drug into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were
confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers, blind-
labeled, and randomized prior to testing. Each participant was provided with the
package insert, one masked sample and a device. The results are summarized below.

Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Not applicable.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
