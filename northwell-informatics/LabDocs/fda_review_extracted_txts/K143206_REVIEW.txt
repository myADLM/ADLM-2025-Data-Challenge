H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The AmpliVue® Bordetella Assay is an in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection
of Bordetella pertussis nucleic acids isolated from nasopharyngeal swab specimens obtained
from patients suspected of having respiratory tract infection attributable to Bordetella
pertussis.
The AmpliVue® Bordetella Assay utilizes helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) of the
insertion sequence IS481 and a self-contained disposable amplification detection device that
allows for manual evaluation of assay results. The IS481 sequence can also be found in
strains of other organisms (i.e., B. holmesii and B. bronchiseptica). B. holmesii infection
may cause clinical illness similar to B. pertussis, and mixed outbreaks involving both B.
pertussis and B. holmesii infection have been reported. Additional testing should be
performed if necessary to differentiate B. holmesii and B. pertussis. B. bronchiseptica is a
rare cause of infection in humans. When clinical factors suggest that B. pertussis may not be
the cause of respiratory infection, other clinically appropriate investigation(s) should be
carried out in accordance with published guidelines.
Negative results for the AmpliVue® Bordetella Assay do not preclude B. pertussis infection
and positive results do not rule out co-infection with other respiratory pathogens. Results
from the AmpliVue® Bordetella Assay should be used in conjunction with information
obtained during the patient's clinical evaluation as an aid in diagnosis of Bordetella pertussis
infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management
decisions.
The AmpliVue® Bordetella Assay is intended for use in hospital, reference or state
laboratory settings. The device is not intended for point-of-care use.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For in vitro diagnostic use only
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Heat blocks capable of 95oC ± 2oC and 64oC ± 2oC.

I. Device Description:
The AmpliVue® Bordetella Assay combines simple sample processing, an isothermal
amplification technology named helicase-dependent amplification (HDA), and a self- contained
disposable amplicon detection device, for the detection of Bordetella pertussis from
nasopharyngeal swabs.
Patient samples are collected using a nasopharyngeal swab and placed into a liquid medium.
Fifty microliters (50 µL) of the sample are then transferred to a process buffer that is provided
with the kit and mixed. The Process Buffer tubes are heated at 95 °C for 10 minutes. Fifty
microliters (50 µL) of the Process Buffer containing sample is added to a reaction tube
containing lyophilized mix of HDA reagents. Included in the reaction mix are the isothermal
polymerase, helicase and single stranded binding protein. After completion of the HDA reaction
the reaction tube is transferred to the amplicon cartridge containing the running buffer. The
amplicon cartridge is closed and inserted into the detection chamber. The detection chamber is
activated by depressing the detection chamber handle. Upon activation, the reservoir containing
the running buffer and the 0.2 mL tube containing the amplicon is punctured and the solutions
are wicked to the lateral flow strip.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Not applicable.
L. Test Principle:
The AmpliVue® Bordetella Assay detects Bordetella pertussis DNA isolated from
nasopharyngeal swab specimens obtained from symptomatic patients suspected of having
respiratory tract infection attributable to Bordetella pertussis. The assay consists of three
major steps: 1) specimen preparation, 2) isothermal Helicase-Dependent Amplification
(HDA) of a target sequence of B. pertussis, and 3) detection of the amplified DNA by target-
specific hybridization probes via a colorimetric reaction on a lateral-flow strip which is
embedded in a self-contained disposable cassette to prevent amplicon contamination.
Patient samples are collected using a nasopharyngeal swab and placed into a liquid medium.
Fifty microliters (50 µL) of the sample are then transferred to a process buffer that is
provided with the kit and mixed. The Process Buffer tubes are heated at 95 °C for
10 minutes. Fifty microliters (50 µL) of the Process Buffer containing sample is added to a
reaction tube containing lyophilized mix of HDA reagents.
A HDA reaction is carried out in the Reaction Tube which contains lyophilized HDA
reagents, dNTPs, primers and probes. Incubation at 64°C for 60 minutes results in isothermal
amplification of the target sequence by B. pertussis specific primers. The amplified DNA is
detected by a set of specific detection probes included in the Reaction Tube: B. pertussis
target hybridizes to two specific probes labeled with Biotin (BioTEG) and
6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM). A competitive process control (PRC) is included in the Lysis
Tube to monitor specimen processing and inhibitory substances in clinical samples, reagent
failure or device failure. The PRC target is amplified and hybridizes to the PRC specific
probes labeled with Biotin (BioTEG) and 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP).
Following completion of the HDA reaction, the Reaction Tube is transferred to a
proprietary Cassette for detection. The Cassette is comprised of two components: 1) an
Amplicon Cartridge that holds the running buffer and the 0.2 mL Reaction Tube and 2) the
Detection Chamber which houses the Amplicon Cartridge and an embedded vertical-flow
DNA detection strip. The DNA detection strip is coated with anti-FAM and anti-DNP
antibodies. Once the Cassette is closed, a razor blade and plastic pin located at the bottom of
the Cassette opens the Reaction Tube and running buffer bulb, resulting in the release of their

contents. The contents flows through a fiberglass paper connected to the DNA detection strip
that is attached to a fiberglass pad pre-loaded with streptavidin-conjugated color particles.
The B. pertussis amplicon with biotin- and FAM-labeled probes is captured by the anti-FAM
antibodies at the test (T2) line, and the Process Control amplicon with biotin- and DNP-
labeled probes is captured by the anti-DNP antibodies at the control (C) line. The
streptavidin-conjugated color particles bind to the biotin in the probe-amplicon hybrid and
the test results are displayed in the Cassette window as colored T2 and/or C lines that are
visible to the naked eye.
Detection of B. pertussis is reported when the T2 line is visible through the detection window
of the Cassette. No detection of B. pertussis is reported when only the C line is displayed.
The assay is regarded as invalid when none of the lines are displayed.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies for the AmpliVue® Bordetella Assay were conducted by two (2)
operators three times (3x) per day for twelve (12) days with a panel of three (3)
simulated samples that include moderate positive (5x LoD) and low positive (2x
LoD), and Bordetella pertussis (BP) negative. The study results are acceptable. The
results are shown in the Table I below.

The reproducibility of the AmpliVue® Bordetella Assay was evaluated at three (3)
laboratory sites (two external, one in-house). Reproducibility was assessed using a panel
of three (3) simulated samples that include moderate positive and low positive (5x and 2x
LoD), and Bordetella pertussis (BP) negative. The panels and controls were processed
and tested on the AmpliVue® Bordetella Assay at each site by 2 operators for 5 non-
consecutive days (2 operators x 3 replicates x 5 days x 3 sites = 90 results per
concentration). The LoD values were based on the values obtained in the LoD study. The
results are shown in the Table II below.

Traceability:
Not applicable. This assay is qualitative.
Stability:
A study was performed to determine the stability of samples in nasal matrix that are
used in the AmpliVue® Bordetella Assay. A contrived positive sample was prepared
by spiking a pooled negative clinical sample with a bacterial stock of Bordetella
pertussis that was prepared and frozen during the LoD study at a concentration of 2x
LoD. The contrived positive sample was tested with AmpliVue Bordetella Validation
Lot reagents using the AmpliVue Bordetella assay workflow, to establish a 0 hour (h)
time point. The contrived positive sample was aliquoted into four tubes and stored at
2°C to 8°C. An aliquot of the specimen was tested at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h time
points. A total of 15 positive samples were assayed for each time point along with a
positive and negative control.
Based on this study, clinical samples are expected to be stable between 2°C to 8°C for

up to 96 hours.
Controls:
Controls (Quidel Molecular Bordetella Control Set #M117, which contains positive
and negative controls, serves as an external processing and extraction control) were
run on the AmpliVue® Bordetella Assay each day of testing. All Bordetella pertussis
positive controls were detected accurately (100%, 111/111). All Bordetella pertussis
negative controls were detected accurately (100%, 111/111) in the clinical study.
These controls are described as follows:
a. The process control is used to monitor sample processing, to detect HDA
inhibitory specimens and to confirm the integrity of assay reagents and
cassette detection. The process control is included in the Lysis Buffer tube.
b. The external positive control may be treated as a patient specimen.
The control should be sampled and tested as if it were a swab specimen and
processed as described in the Assay Procedure. The external positive
control is intended to monitor substantial reagent and cassette failure.
c. The external negative control may be treated as a patient specimen. The
control should be sampled and tested as if it were a swab specimen and
processed as described in the Assay Procedure. The external negative
control is used to detect reagent or environmental contamination (or carry-
over) by B. pertussis DNA or amplicon.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection or LoD) of the AmpliVue® Bordetella
Assay was determined using quantified (CFU/mL) cultures of two (2) Bordetella
pertussis bacterial stocks, BP A639 and E431 serially diluted in negative nasal
matrix. The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration at which 95% of all replicates
tested positive.
The two bacterial strains of Bordetella pertussis (BP) were freshly grown. The
organisms were cultured onto Bordet-Gengou (BG) Blood Agar plates from
commercially obtained glycerol stock. The resulting colonies were harvested and
collected in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), and the density of the bacterial cell
suspension was determined using the McFarland assay. After a cell suspension of
0.25 McFarland units was established, the bacteria were serially diluted in PBS. BP
CFU/mL concentrations were confirmed by plating onto fresh BG Blood Agar and
colony counts.
After the LoD was determined, 20 replicates of the LoD dilutions of BP A639 and
E431were tested using two additional validation lots of buffers and amplification
reagents. If 19 or 20 of 20 replicates of the dilution showed positive results for BP,
the three lots were deemed equivalent. For the three validation lots of reagents to be
11

--- Page 12 ---
deemed equivalent, the LoD across the three reagent lots must not exceed three
halving concentrations (i.e. must not exceed 8 fold).
The assay LoD for Bordetella pertussis is 3.93 CFU/assay or 2,358 CFU/mL (sample
input), which was demonstrated on three Validation Lots. The LoD study results are
shown in Table III below.
Table III: LoD for Bordetella pertussis
Strain Strain ID CFU/mL
Bordetella pertussis strain 1 A639 2,358
Bordetella pertussis strain 2 E431 760.8
These study results are acceptable.
e. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity):
The reactivity of the AmpliVue® Bordetella Assay was evaluated against an
additional six (6) strains of Bordetella pertussis. The testing was performed at
concentrations near the level of detection (LoD).
Each strain was tested as three replicates in the AmpliVue® Bordetella Assay. The
study was performed in multiple experiments of no more than 14 assays per
experiment. For each experiment, three replicates of up to four strains were
performed, along with a positive and a negative run control. All six (6) strains were
detected by the AmpliVue® Bordetella Assay in this study at the 1x LoD
concentration (3.93 CFU/assay or 2,358 CFU/mL). The inclusivity study results and
the final organism concentrations tested are shown in Table IV below.

An in silico BLAST analysis of primers used in the AmpliVue® Bordetella Assay
against twenty-three (23) Bordetella strains in the NCBI database was done to further
demonstrate inclusivity. The Bordetella primers matched 1068 Bordetella sequences,
including eight (8) B. pertussis complete genome/WGS sequences and 25 gene/CDS

sequences. The primers and probes all have 3-4 mismatches in less than 10% of all
sequences, indicating that the region is well conserved. The primers, however, did not
match one WGS strain, B. pertussis B1917. In addition, the primers will also detect B.
bronchiseptica and B. holmesii strains. The primers did not show evidence of cross-
reactivity with other organisms.
f. Cross Reactivity:
A study was performed to evaluate the cross-reactivity of the AmpliVue® Bordetella
Assay with seventy-nine (79) other microorganisms potentially found in specimens
collected to test for Bordetella pertussis (BP) infection. Cross-reactive microorganism
was tested at clinically relevant levels of viruses (105 PFU/mL) and bacteria
(106 CFU/mL) in the device. The organisms and their concentrations included in the
cross-reactivity study are shown in Table V below.

The Cross Reactivity study tested a panel of 79 microorganisms. This study
determined that 1 of 4 Bordetella bronchiseptica strains (strain 4617) and 4 of 4
Bordetella holmesii strains tested were cross-reactive with the AmpliVue®
BordetellaAssay. These results can be expected as 5% of all Bordetella
bronchiseptica strains and all Bordetella holmesii strains are known to carry the
IS481 target sequence.
These cross-reactive results are noted in the intended use and limitation sections.
g. Interference:
A panel of seventeen (17) chemical and biological substances potentially present in
Bordetella pertussis infection specimens were evaluated for interference with the
AmpliVue® Bordetella Assay. Each substance was tested in three replicates at
concentrations which were medically significant in the presence and absence of near
LOD (2x) levels of B. pertussis in the AmpliVue® Bordetella Assay.
None of the substances tested were found to interfere with the AmpliVue® Bordetella
Assay. The interference substances and their concentrations included in the
interference study are shown in Table VI below.

b. Matrix comparison:
The compatibility of eight (8) different types of media with the AmpliVue Bordetella
assay was determined testing four (4) strains each of pre-titered BP bacterial strains at
1x LoD concentrations. A diluted bacterial strain and one of the eight types of media
(Tris EDTA, Molecular Grade Water, E-swab, M4, M4-RT, M5, 0.85% Saline) were
added to three Process Buffer tubes and were tested in the AmpliVue Bordetella assay
according to the established workflow using Validation Lot reagents
The study was performed in multiple assay runs, with up to four strains tested per
assay run. Each experiment included a positive and a negative run control. Any media
that resulted in BP- positive detection for 3 of 3 replicates was considered to be
compatible with the AmpliVue Bordetella assay.
All four Bordetella pertussis strains were determined to be compatible with the 8
different media types when tested at the assay LoD. Based on these results, Tris

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Performance characteristics of the AmpliVue® Bordetella Assay was established in
2014 (April to August 2014) at four locations in the United States. Eight hundred
forty two (842) fresh nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained from female and
male patients suspected of having respiratory tract infection attributable to Bordetella
pertussis. Specimens were collected and transported to each laboratory for testing
with the AmpliVue® Bordetella Assay.
Clinical performance was based on comparison of the AmpliVue Bordetella Assay
results to those obtained by Composite Reference Method that included two
manufacturer validated, IS481-targeted real-time PCR assays (PCR1 and PCR2)
followed by bi-directional sequencing from PCR positive specimens. The PCR1 and
PCR2 assay protocols included 37 amplification cycles. Bi-directional sequencing
was performed for all specimens producing amplicon prior to the end of 37-cycle
amplification. Specimens were considered positive when bi-directional sequence
sequencing results from either comparator PCR assay confirmed the presence of
Bordetella pertussis amplicon. Specimens were considered negative when neither
comparator PCR assay produced Bordetella pertussis amplicon at the end of the 37-
cycles.
Eight hundred forty two (842) fresh nasopharyngeal swab specimens were tested as
described above. Six (6) specimens (0.7%) were invalid (in both the initial and repeat
test neither the T2 or control lines were detected) and have been removed from
additional analysis. The table below details the comparison data of the AmpliVue
Bordetella Assay and the Composite Reference Method for the remaining eight
hundred thirty six (836) specimens.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The prevalence of Bordetella pertussis detected with the AmpliVue® Bordetella Assay
has been calculated for the combined sites based on the age of the patient. Six (6)
specimens (0.7%) were invalid (in both the initial and repeat test neither the T2 or control
lines were detected) and have been removed from the Expected Values table. All clinical
specimens collected during this study were collected between April, 2014 and August
2014. Table VIII below presents the data for the remaining eight hundred forty two (842)
specimens.
