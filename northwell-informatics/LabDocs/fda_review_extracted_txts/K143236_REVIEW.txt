Test Principle:
During the first incubation step, the HSV-1 IgG antibodies present in the positive control and
sample bind to the gG recombinant antigen on the coated surface. Following the first
incubation step, unbound materials are removed with a wash cycle. Then the detection
reagent-AP conjugate is added and during the second incubation step, the detection reagent-
AP conjugate reacts with the HSV-1 IgG antibodies already bound to the capture surface.
Following the second incubation, unbound materials are removed with a wash cycle. The
chemiluminescent substrate is added to the capture-analyte-detection complex during the
third incubation step to initiate the chemiluminescence reaction. Light generated by this
reaction is detected and analyzed by the Theranos System using a calibration function to
determine the cut-off index (COI) values for the sample and controls. The results for the
Positive and Negative controls must be within specified limits for a run to be considered
valid
MATERIALS PROVIDED

The Theranos Capillary Tubes and Nanotainer Tubes are non-sterile, single use only
collection devices consisting of two Capillary Tubes paired with two Nanotainer Tubes that
are capable of collecting, preserving, and transporting fingerstick whole blood samples for
use with the Theranos HSV-1 IgG Assay. Each capillary is coated with di-potassium EDTA
(K -EDTA) anticoagulant which is intended to preserve the specimen during transport and/or
2
storage (there are no anticoagulants in the Nanotainer Tubes). A needle interfaces with each
capillary to transport blood from each capillary into a dedicated Nanotainer Tube.
Theranos Cartridge (HSV-1 IgG Assay)
The Theranos HSV-1 IgG Assay reagents are assembled in a self-contained, ready-to-use
pouched cartridge that is sufficient to run one test. The pouched cartridge should be removed
from the refrigerator at least 10 minutes prior to use, but must be used within 24 hours after
removal from the refrigerator. Any cartridge that has exceeded the 24 hour time limit should
be discarded. The cartridge pouch should be kept sealed until it is needed to run a sample.
The components of the cartridge are described in Table 1 below:

THERANOS PATIENT SERVICE CENTERS – SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND PREPARATION
The Theranos HSV-1 IgG Assay is intended for use with K2-EDTA anticoagulated human
plasma from fingerstick whole blood. Fingerstick whole blood samples should be collected
with the Theranos Capillary Tubes and Nanotainer Tubes. This device is designed to collect
80µL of whole blood in each of a pair of Nanotainer Tubes (160µL of whole blood in the
paired Tubes).
CLIA LABORATORY – SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND PREPARATION
The Theranos HSV-1 IgG Assay is intended for use with human serum from venous blood
and K2-EDTA anticoagulated human plasma from venous and fingerstick whole blood.
Venous blood should be collected aseptically using approved venipuncture techniques by
qualified personnel. For the collection of fingerstick specimens, fingerstick whole blood
samples should be collected with the Theranos Capillary Tubes and Nanotainer Tubes in
accordance with the instructions provided. For the serum specimens collected by
venipuncture, the blood should be allowed to clot, and the serum separated from the clot as
soon as possible. Store and ship Nanotainer Tubes in controlled insulated and refrigerated
containers specified by Theranos, following Nanotainer Tubes sample storage and shipment
instructions as specified by Theranos. Store and ship venous samples in controlled insulated
and refrigerated containers specified by Theranos, following venous sample storage and
shipment instructions as specified by Theranos.
Upon receipt in the CLIA-certified laboratory, the fingerstick whole blood samples in the
Nanotainer Tubes should be centrifuged at 1200g for 5 minutes within 48 hours of sample
collection. The venous K2-EDTA anticoagulated whole blood samples should be centrifuged
at 1300g for 10 minutes per standard vacutainer protocols.
The separated plasma from fingerstick specimens can remain at room temperature for no
longer than 6 hours. If the assay will not be completed within 6 hours, refrigerate the sample
at 2 to 8°C. If the assay will not be completed within 48 hours of storing at 2-8C, the
samples should be frozen at –20°C. Frozen specimens should be thawed and mixed well prior
to use. A maximum of 3 freeze thaw cycles are allowed.
The minimum volume required from the sample in the collection device is approximately 30
µL of specimen (plasma or serum) (10 µL of specimen is used for the assay and
approximately 20 µL of dead volume).
CAUTION: All specimens must be treated as potentially infectious material.
CLIA LABORATORY – THE HSV-1 IGG ASSAY PROCEDURE
To ensure proper test performance, strictly adhere to the following operating instructions:
1. Pouched “HSV-1 IgG Assay, CLIA lab location” cartridges should be stored at 4°C.
They should be kept right-side-up as indicated by a sticker on the top side of each
pouch.
2. For fingerstick whole blood samples provided in the Capillary Tubes and
Nanotainer Tubes:
a. Scan QR code on bottom of Nanotainer Tube into SampleID field of the tracking
file.
7

--- Page 8 ---
b. Open cartridge pouch labelled “HSV-1 IgG Assay, CLIA lab location” and
discard wrapper and desiccant in biohazard bin.
c. Scan QR code on side of cartridge into Barcode field of tracking file and enter the
patient number into the PatientID field.
d. Orient the cartridge such that the barcode is on the right hand side and the
Nanotainer Tube slot is on the upper right. The green arrow on the cartridge
should point into the device.
e. Transfer 30µL of plasma using a manual pipette into the round vessel highlighted
with a red ring near the center of the “Theranos HSV-1 IgG Assay, CLIA lab
location” cartridge.
3. For venous blood collected with a commercially available venous blood EDTA-
anti-coagulated collection device or commercially available serum collection
device:
a. Scan barcode on the sample container into SampleID field of the tracking file.
b. Open cartridge pouch labelled “HSV-1 IgG Assay, CLIA lab location” and
discard wrapper and desiccant in biohazard bin.
c. Scan QR code on side of cartridge into Barcode field of tracking file and enter the
patient number into the PatientID field.
d. Orient the cartridge such that the barcode is on the right hand side and the
Nanotainer Tube slot is on the upper right. The green arrow on the cartridge
should point into the device.
e. Transfer 30µL of plasma or serum using a manual pipette into the round vessel
highlighted with a red ring near the center of the “Theranos HSV-1 IgG Assay,
CLIA lab location” cartridge.
4. Prompts on the TSPU touch screen should be followed to insert the cartridge into the
TSPU and to start the test run.
5. Once the TSPU application has initialized, the Home Screen will appear. Tap the
Home Screen to begin.
6. Tapping on the Home Screen brings you to the Open Screen.
7. Touch the Open Button to open the cartridge door on the front of the TSPU. This will
start a 90-second countdown timer.
8. If the cartridge is not inserted within the 90-second period, the door will close. If this
happens, the screen will go back to the Open Screen (Step 6). Press the Open Button
to reopen the cartridge door (Step 7).
9. Insert the cartridge so its green arrow points into the TSPU. Upon detection, the
TSPU will pull the cartridge into the TSPU.
10. Once the cartridge is pulled into the TSPU, the screen will indicate that the
processing is initializing.
11. Once the initialization is complete, the TSPU will automatically execute the protocol
and the screen will display a circular indicator displaying the percentage of the total
8

--- Page 9 ---
time to execute the protocol in its center, and an estimated countdown of the time
remaining to complete the protocol.
12. When the protocol is successfully completed, a “complete” message will appear
briefly indicating that the process completed successfully, followed by a “Test
complete” screen.
13. The final Eject Screen will indicate that the test has been completed and the cartridge
may be ejected by pressing the button.
14. The door will open and the cartridge will be ejected. The door will remain open for
up to 120 seconds at which time the TSPU retracts the cartridge and shuts the door to
maintain the temperature within the TSPU. In that case, the screen will go back to the
Eject Screen (Step 13).
15. The cartridge should be discarded into a biohazard bin.
16. The TSPU detects that the ejected cartridge is removed, and the cartridge door will
close and navigate back to the Home Screen.
Once the cartridge is loaded into the TSPU the following steps are automatically
implemented in sequence over approximately 78 minutes.
1. Sample plasma, negative control material and positive control material are mixed
with sample diluent to yield sample diluent and diluted control samples in separate
vessels.
2. During the first incubation step, the HSV-1 IgG antibodies present in the controls and
sample bind an HSV-1 glycoprotein G (gG) recombinant antigen on a coated surface.
3. Following the first incubation step, unbound materials are removed with a wash
cycle.
4. Then the detection reagent-AP conjugate is added and during the second incubation
step, the detection reagent-AP conjugate reacts with the HSV-1 IgG antibodies
already bound to the capture surface.
5. Following the second incubation, unbound materials are removed with a wash cycle.
6. The chemiluminescent substrate is added to the capture-analyte-detection complex
during the third incubation step to initiate the chemiluminescence reaction.
7. Light generated by this reaction is detected and analyzed by the Theranos System
using a calibration function to determine the cut-off index (COI) values for the
sample.
QUALITY CONTROL (QC)
The Theranos HSV-1 IgG Assay cartridges are completely self-contained and ready-to-use,
and include the use of on-board positive and negative controls. Each laboratory should follow
applicable local laws, regulations and standard good laboratory practice to establish its own
QC ranges and frequency of QC testing. The on-board positive and negative controls are
purchased from commercial sources. These on-board control samples are run simultaneously
with the assay each time a patient sample is run, processed in parallel with the patient
samples, in exactly the same way as the patient sample is processed.

Expected Control Results
Control Type Expected result
Positive control: Liquid (65 µL), human serum
Positive
based, containing HSV-1 IgG
Negative control: Liquid (65 µL), human serum
Negative
based, containing no HSV-1 IgG.
The output from these positive and negative control runs are analyzed by the Theranos
System for any performance deficiencies in the system in real time. Calibration functions
consist of pass/fail limits, for both the positive control and the negative control. If the control
value lies outside the pass limit, the run is considered to be invalid. If either control fail, or if
it is out of range, the test result will be INVALID as described in Table 2 below.
INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
The result returned by the Theranos HSV-1 IgG test automatically factors in the validity of
on-board controls. The user obtains a result with one of the following possibilities:

The results of the study demonstrate that the precision of the Theranos HSV-1 IgG Assay
(including different TSPU devices, different lots of cartridges, and different operators)
when performed in a CLIA Laboratory was in the range 10.2% to 14.2%.
Precision –CLIA Laboratory Model, Fingerstick Whole Blood
A study for estimating the precision of the Theranos HSV-1 IgG Assay for fingerstick
whole blood samples in a CLIA Laboratory model was performed by testing a panel of 3
fingerstick plasma samples spanning the analytical range [high negative (P), equivocal
(Q), moderate positive (R)]. The precision study was conducted at one site with thirty-six
(36) TSPU devices, three (3) lots of cartridges and nine (9) operators in total. The study
duration was 4 days in total. Details of the study design for different samples are
presented in Table 6 below.

The results of the study demonstrate that the precision of the Theranos HSV-1 IgG Assay
(including different TSPU devices, different lots of cartridges, and different operators)
when performed in a CLIA Laboratory was in the range from 10.9% to 12.2%.
Reproducibility
A study designed to process multiple fingerstick whole blood samples from individual
subjects was performed to evaluate the reproducibility of the Theranos HSV-1 IgG Assay
when used with Theranos Capillary Tubes and Nanotainer Tubes. The study was
conducted at 3 collection sites with 10 subjects at each site. From each of 30 subjects, 9
Capillary Tubes and Nanotainer Tubes from 3 manufacturing lots (i.e. 3 Capillary Tubes
and Nanotainer Tubes per lot) and 2 serum separator tubes (SSTs) were collected. Each
subject had the following measurements:
 Each of the 9 Capillary Tubes and Nanotainer Tubes was tested. These data were
used for the evaluation of Between-Capillary Tubes and Nanotainer Tubes
imprecision, Between-lot imprecision and Total imprecision that includes Between-
Capillary Tubes and Nanotainer Tubes and Between-lot imprecisions.
 One Nanotainer Tube (from one of the 3rd lot of Capillary Tubes and Nanotainer
Tubes for each subject) was tested in duplicate via recovering a sample from one
Capillary Tubes and Nanotainer Tubes device and transferring a sample to another
Capillary Tubes and Nanotainer Tubes device. These data were used for evaluation of
Within-Capillary Tubes and Nanotainer Tubes imprecision.
 Each of the 2 SSTs was tested. These data were used for evaluation of Between-SST
imprecision.
For samples with mean COI value at the baseline ≥0.5, percent differences were
calculated and for samples with mean COI value at the baseline <0.5, differences were
calculated. Table 9 summarizes the results of the precision study broken down by
collection site and by high or low COI subjects; the variability metrics are averaged
across all subjects within the site.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls: The two on-board controls used in the test are from commercially available
sources. Acceptable limits for control measurements were established by averaging 813
runs. Any control measurement outside the acceptable range invalidates the cartridge run.
Calibrators: Calibrators for factory calibration are formulated using commercially
available calibrators and an in-house standard to obtain three calibrator levels at COI
values of 0.9, 1.1 and 2.0. Calibration of Theranos HSV-1 IgG assay is tied to a particular
lot of reagents, and a particular lot of cartridges. The cut-off is set for the lot of cartridges
based on the Relative Light Units value of the cut-off calibrator. The other calibrators are
used to verify the modulation of the assay. The modulation should be within specified
conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied, the lot is considered to not have sufficient
modulation and is disqualified.
Analyte Stability
An analyte stability study was performed to characterize the stability of HSV-1 IgG in
clinical matrices as measured by the Theranos HSV-1 IgG Assay under different sample
storage conditions and time periods as shown in Table 10.

Within 2 hours after collection, one aliquot of each sample type or matrix was tested with
the Theranos HSV-1 IgG Assay in duplicate, to establish the value at baseline. The
samples were stored in Nanotainer Tubes under the appropriate conditions. Comparison
of an average of two replicates at the predetermined time points with the average of two
replicates at baseline was performed. For samples with a mean COI value at the baseline
≥0.5, percent differences were calculated and for samples with a mean COI value at the
baseline <0.5, differences were calculated.
Acceptance criteria were as follows: i) a difference averaged over all samples with a
baseline mean COI value ≥0.5 must be less than ±10% and a difference averaged over all
samples with a baseline COI mean <0.5 must be less than 0.02 and ii) for each sample, an
observed difference must be less than 15% for the samples with a baseline mean COI
value ≥0.5 and must be less than 0.08 for the samples with a baseline mean COI value
<0.5 (the range of differences expected if there is no effect of storage on the HSV-1 IgG
analyte).

e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering Substances
A study was designed and performed (in accordance with CLSI EP07-A2) to evaluate the
performance of the Theranos HSV-1 IgG Assay in the presence of potentially interfering
substances to assess the impact of these endogenous substances and commonly used
drugs on the performance of the Theranos HSV-1 IgG Assay. Interferents were tested
with three serum samples (negative (mean COI 0.024), high negative (mean COI 0.77)
and low positive (mean COI 1.52)) that were contrived by using a high positive sample
and diluting it with pooled negative serum. Samples were spiked with the interferent at
levels shown in Table 12. Each serum pool was tested in duplicate.
For the low positive and the high negative pools, the acceptance criteria were a mean
recovery within +/- 20% of the value of the unspiked sample (i.e., in the absence of the
potential interferent or drug). All low positive and high negative samples showed a signal
change of less than 15% for all interfering substances. All positive samples remained
positive and all negative samples remained negative upon spiking of drug or other
interferents. For the negative pool, the acceptance criterion was a deviation of less than
0.02 COI. All negative samples showed a mean deviation of ≤0.02 COI, except Intralipid.
Intralipid spikes did not show any effect on recovery for near cut-off samples, high
negative and low positive samples.

Cross-reactivity
A study was performed to evaluate the performance of the Theranos HSV-1 IgG Assay in
the presence of IgG antibodies against twenty-one (21) infectious agents defined as
potential cross-reactants in the FDA guidance on HSV serological assays. Banked serum
samples confirmed positive for IgG against the infectious agents of interest were acquired
from commercial vendors. At least three (3) samples, independently confirmed as
positive for that agent and negative for HSV-1 IgG on the reference method, were tested
on the Theranos HSV-1 IgG Assay in order to rule out cross-reactivity of the Theranos
HSV-1 IgG Assay with IgG against a potential cross reactant. The results of this study are
displayed in Table 13 below.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Fingerstick Plasma – CLIA Laboratory Model
To demonstrate the performance of the Theranos HSV-1 IgG Assay for fingerstick whole
blood samples were collected at 3 Theranos Patient Service Centers (TPSCs) and
processed at the CLIA-certified laboratory.
At each site, fingerstick whole blood samples were collected into a pair of Theranos
Capillary Tubes and Nanotainer Tubes, and venous samples were collected into serum
tubes from 20, 16 and 25 adult subjects at three collection sites.
Samples were shipped refrigerated to the Theranos CLIA-certified laboratory in Palo
Alto, CA. Upon receipt, fingerstick whole blood samples in the Nanotainer Tubes were
centrifuged at 1200g for 5 minutes. Plasma was extracted and processed and analyzed on
the Theranos System. All samples were processed or frozen as plasma within 48 hours of
draw. The venous samples were processed into serum for testing with the reference
method (FOCUS HerpeSelect Immunoblot).
A summary of the performance information is shown in the following Table 15.

b. Matrix comparison:
The effect of anticoagulants and different sample types (fingerstick and venous) on the
performance of the Theranos HSV-1 IgG Assay was determined by comparing matched
venous serum, venous K2-EDTA plasma, and fingerstick K2-EDTA plasma samples
from 70 donors. Forty-three matched sample sets were contrived to have analyte values
close to the cut-off. The acceptance criterion was a recovery of positive plasma samples
within ± 20% of the corresponding serum reference value (serum drawn into primary
tubes without gel). For negative samples, the acceptance criteria was a difference of <=
0.02 COI from the corresponding serum value. All anticoagulant–treated plasma samples
met this criterion. Weighted Deming regression was performed. The slope and an
intercept of the regression line and their 95% confidence intervals along with correlation
coefficients are shown in Table 16 and a graphical depiction is shown in Figure 1.

Clinical Performance in the Intended Use Populations (CLIA Laboratory Model)
A clinical study was conducted to characterize the performance of the Theranos HSV-1
IgG Assay in the Theranos CLIA-certified Laboratory in comparison to the FOCUS
HerpeSelect Immunoblot (as the reference method for performance analysis).
Prospectively collected, archived venous serum samples collected from pregnant women
and sexually active adults (18 years and older) who had a prescription for a HSV-1 IgG
test. Samples were obtained from multiple specimen sources covering 10 US states and
Mexico.
The equivocal results on the Focus HerpeSelect Immunoblot (that repeatedly tested
equivocal) were resolved using a validated western blot reference test (University of
Washington, Seattle) as per the instructions of the package insert for the reference
method. Ten samples from the sexually active adult sub-population tested initially
equivocal on the Focus HerpeSelect Immunoblot and were resolved by the University of
Washington western blot as 2 negatives and 7 positives. One sample was not resolved.
There were no samples in the sexually active adult sub-population that returned an
invalid result.
In the pregnant women sub-population, 8 samples tested initially equivocal on the Focus
HerpeSelect immunoblot. Of these, 4 samples could not be resolved by the University of
Washington western blot due to insufficient volume availability. Of the remaining 4
samples, 1 (one) were resolved as negative and 3 as positive. There were 3 samples that
returned an invalid result on the Theranos HSV-1 IgG test. These samples were rerun and
resulted in valid results included in the analysis. The clinical performance information for
the sexually active adults and pregnant women population is presented in Tables 17 and
18 below:

CDC Panel Testing:
The objective of this study was to demonstrate agreement of the Theranos HSV-1 IgG
Assay with the CDC panel. A panel of well characterized serum samples (n=100) was
obtained from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC
sample panel was tested with the HSV-1 IgG Assay and the results obtained by Theranos
were sent to the CDC for confirmation. The panel consisted of 54 positives and 46
negatives. The Theranos HSV-1 IgG Assay demonstrated 100% agreement with the
results provided by the CDC.
Low Prevalence Population
Serum samples were collected from a low prevalence population: individuals who are not
sexually active, and without a recent or current sexually transmitted disease (Hepatitis,
Syphilis, HIV, HPV, Trichomonas, Chlamydia, and Gonorrhoeae) as determined in an
interview. Performance of the assay on this population is summarized in Table 19. The
Samples were obtained from multiple specimen sources covering 10 US states and
Mexico.
