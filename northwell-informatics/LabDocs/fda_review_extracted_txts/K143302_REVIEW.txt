H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay, performed on the GeneXpert® Instrument Systems, is a
qualitative, nested real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in vitro diagnostic test for
the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA in raw sputum or
concentrated sputum sediment prepared from induced or expectorated sputum. In
specimens where Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB-complex) is detected, the
Xpert MTB/RIF Assay also detects the rifampin-resistance associated mutations of the
rpoB gene.
The Xpert MTB/RIF Assay is intended for use with specimens from patients for whom
there is clinical suspicion of tuberculosis (TB) and who have received no antituberculosis
therapy, or less than three days of therapy. This test is intended as an aid in the diagnosis
of pulmonary tuberculosis when used in conjunction with clinical and other laboratory
findings.
An Xpert MTB/RIF Assay result of “MTB NOT DETECTED” from either one or two
sputum specimens is highly predictive of the absence of M. tuberculosis complex bacilli
on serial fluorescent acid-fast sputum smears from patients with suspected active
pulmonary tuberculosis and can be used as an aid in the decision of whether continued
airborne infection isolation (AII) is warranted in patients with suspected pulmonary
tuberculosis. The determination of whether testing of either one or two sputum
specimens is appropriate for decisions regarding removal from AII should be based on
specific clinical circumstances and institutional guidelines. Clinical decisions regarding
the need for continued AII should always occur in conjunction with other clinical and
laboratory evaluations and Xpert MTB/RIF Assay results should not be the sole basis for
infection control practices.
The Xpert MTB/RIF Assay must always be used in conjunction with mycobacterial
culture to address the risk of false negative results and to recover organisms when MTB-
complex is present for further characterization and drug susceptibility testing. However,
decisions regarding the removal of patients from AII need not wait for culture results.
Sputum specimens for TB culture, AFB smear microscopy, and Xpert MTB/RIF Assay
testing should follow CDC recommendations with regard to collection methods and time
frame between specimen collection.
The Xpert MTB/RIF Assay does not provide confirmation of rifampin susceptibility
since mechanisms of rifampin resistance other than those detected by this device may
exist that may be associated with a lack of clinical response to treatment.
Specimens that have both MTB-complex DNA and rifampin-resistance associated
mutations of the rpoB gene detected by the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay must have results
confirmed by a reference laboratory. If the presence of rifampin-resistance associated
mutations of the rpoB gene is confirmed, specimens should also be tested for the
2

--- Page 3 ---
presence of genetic mutations associated with resistance to other drugs.
The Xpert MTB/RIF Assay should only be performed in laboratories that follow safety
practices in accordance with the CDC/NIH Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical
Laboratories publication and applicable state or local regulations.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay is for prescription use only in accordance with 21 CFR
801.09.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay is for use with the GeneXpert® Instrument Systems,
including the GeneXpert® Diagnostic (Dx) Systems and GeneXpert® Infinity Systems.
I. Device Description:
The Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay is an automated in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative
detection of MTB-complex DNA and the genetic mutations associated with rifampin
(Rif) resistance in raw sputum samples or concentrated sputum sediments from patients
for whom there is clinical suspicion of TB and who have received no antituberculosis
therapy, or less than 3 days of therapy. The primers in this test amplify a portion of the
rpoB gene containing the 81 base pair core region. The probes are designed to
differentiate between the conserved wild-type sequence and mutations in the core region
that are associated with Rifampin (Rif) resistance. The assay is performed on Cepheid
GeneXpert®Instrument Systems.
The Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay includes single-use disposable cartridges and sample
reagent for sample preparation. The Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay cartridges contain reagents
for the detection of MTB-complex DNA and Rif resistance associated mutations. A
Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) are also included in
the cartridge. The SPC is present to control for adequate processing of the target
microorganism and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the PCR reaction. The Probe
Check Control (PCC) verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge,
probe integrity and dye stability.
Sputum specimens are collected according to the institution’s standard procedures and
transported to the GeneXpert® Instrument System area. For raw sputum, Sample Reagent
is added to the sample (2:1, v:v). Sample Reagent is added to the resuspended sputum
sediment (1.5 mL Sample Reagent to 0.5 mL suspension or 3:1, v:v, for larger volumes
of sediment suspension). For both specimen types, the solution is shaken vigorously to
3

--- Page 4 ---
mix, and then incubated at 20-30ºC for 15 minutes. Using the transfer pipette provided,
the specimen is transferred to the open port of the Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay cartridge.
The user initiates a test from the system user interface, the Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay
cartridge is loaded onto the GeneXpert® Instrument System platform, which performs
hands-off, automated sample processing, and real-time PCR for detection of DNA.
Summary and detailed test results are obtained in approximately 2 hours and are
displayed in tabular and graphic formats.
The Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay simultaneously detects MTB-complex and the genetic
mutations associated with rifampin resistance by amplifying a MTB-complex specific
sequence of the rpoB gene, which is probed with five molecular beacons (Probes A – E)
for mutations within the rifampin-resistance determining region (RRDR). Each molecular
beacon is labeled with a different fluorophore.
The valid maximum cycle threshold (Ct) of 39.0 for Probes A, B and C and 36.0 for
Probes D and E are set for data analysis.
· “MTB DETECTED”, is reported when at least two probes result in Ct values within
the valid range and a delta Ct min (the smallest Ct difference between any pair of
probes) of less than 2.0.
· “Rif Resistance NOT DETECTED” is reported if the delta Ct max (the Ct difference
between the earliest and latest probe) is ≤4.0.
· “Rif Resistance DETECTED” is reported if the delta Ct max is >4.0.
· “Rif Resistance INDETERMINATE” is reported when the following two conditions
are met:
1. the Ct value of any probe exceeds the valid maximum Ct (or is zero, i.e. no
threshold crossing); and
2. the earliest rpoB Ct value is greater than [(Valid maximum Ct of probe in
condition1) - (delta Ct max cut-off of 4.0)]
· “MTB NOT DETECTED” is reported when there is only one or no positive probe.
All assay settings are included as automatic calculations in the Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay
protocol and cannot be modified by the user.

L. Test Principle:
The primers and probes in the Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay detect the presence of a unique gene
sequence in MTB-complex DNA by using fluorogenic target-specific hybridization for
detection of the amplified DNA. Sputum specimens are collected from patients with clinical
suspicion of tuberculosis. The specimen is mixed with Sample Reagent, shaken 10 to 20
times or vortexed for at least 10 seconds, and incubated for 15 minutes at 20-30ºC. At 5 to
10 minutes into the incubation period, the specimen is shaken or vortexed again, and
incubated for the remainder of the 15 minute incubation period prior to transferring it to the
assay cartridge for testing. The GeneXpert® performs sample preparation by mixing the
prepared sample with the lyophilized Sample Processing Control. The cells are filtered and
washed with buffer to remove inhibitors and contaminants, and lysed using glass beads and
an ultrasonic horn, eluting the released DNA. The DNA is mixed with dry real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reagents and transferred into the integrated PCR tube for
real-time PCR amplification and detection of chromosomal DNA gene sequences for MTB-
complex.

A prospective multi-center study (Study 2) was conducted at multiple sites in the United
States, as well as South Africa and Brazil. Performance of the MTB/RIF Assay was
assessed as an alternative to fluorescent stained AFB-smear microscopy as an aid in
determining the need for continued airborne infection isolation in patients with suspected
active pulmonary tuberculosis. Results from Xpert MTB/RIF Assay testing of two serial
sputum specimens in study subjects with suspected active pulmonary tuberculosis were
compared to results of fluorescent stained AFB smears of the same specimens; a subset of
subjects had a third sputum specimen tested by AFB-smear but not by the Xpert
MTB/RIF Assay. Each specimen was cultured for MTB-complex using liquid and solid

culture media, with mycobacterial growth confirmed for MTB-complex and rifampin
drug susceptibility testing performed via the Middlebrook agar proportion method. Study
2 was also designed to evaluate the clinical performance of the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay
using prospectively collected sputum specimens in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected
populations
Study subjects 18 years or older were eligible for enrollment if they were suspected of
pulmonary tuberculosis, on no treatment or had fewer than 48 hours of TB treatment
within 180 days prior to collection of the first sputum specimen, and had
determination/documentation of HIV status. Subjects were included in the analysis if they
produced at least two sputum specimens collected in sufficient volume for testing by
Xpert MTB/RIF Assay, AFB smear, and MTB culture, and interpretable results were
available for all three methods. A third specimen for analysis was collected at some sites
based on standard of care protocols. Of 992 eligible and tested subjects, thirty-two
subjects (3.2%) were excluded from the analysis: 7 due to absence of culture results and 3
due to MTB culture contamination. Twenty-two subjects (2.2%) were excluded due to
Xpert MTB/RIF Assay non-determinate results (i.e., INVALID, ERROR, or NO
RESULT). Therefore, 960 subjects were used in the analysis based on the first Xpert
MTB/RIF Assay result. Twenty of the 22 subjects excluded from analysis based on the
first Xpert MTB/RIF Assay result gave valid results for the second Xpert MTB/RIF
Assay test specimen, therefore, analysis based on two Xpert MTB/RIF Assay test
specimens included a total of 980 subjects.
Study subjects were 62% male, 38% female. Sixty-five (65%) percent of subjects were
from the U.S., and 35% were from non-U.S. sites. Forty-five (45%) percent of study
subjects were HIV-infected and 55% were HIV-uninfected subjects. Expectorated and
induced sputa represented 59.6% and 33.6% of specimens respectively; 7% of sputum
specimens were unspecified. Twenty-eight percent of specimens were raw sputa and 72%
were concentrated sputum sediments.
Xpert MTB/RIF Assay Performance as Predictive of Results of Serial Fluorescent
Stained AFB Smears
Of 215 study subjects with culture confirmed MTB-complex (14.2% [88/618] of U.S.
subjects and 37.1% [127/342] of non-U.S. subjects), 99% of subjects (97% of U.S.
subjects and 100% of non-U.S. subjects) with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis where
MTB-complex was detected by acid-fast microscopy of two or three serial sputum
specimens also had MTB-complex detected by testing of a single sputum by the Xpert
MTB/RIF Assay. Results from testing of two serial sputum specimens by the Xpert
MTB/RIF Assay detected MTB-complex in all AFB-smear-positive subjects (100% in the
U.S. subjects and 100% in non-U.S. subjects).
A single negative Xpert MTB/RIF Assay result predicted the absence of AFB smear-
positive pulmonary tuberculosis with an overall negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.7%
(99.6% in the U.S. and 100% in non-U.S.). Two serial negative Xpert MTB/RIF Assay
results predicted the absence of AFB smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis with an
12

overall NPV of 100%.
One Xpert MTB/RIF Assay Result as Predictive of Results of Serial Fluorescent
Stained AFB Smears
Tables 2 and 3 present the overall performance of one Xpert MTB/RIF Assay result
compared to the results of MTB culture, stratified by AFB smear result (Table 2). Table 3
is a side-by-side comparison of the performance of one Xpert MTB/RIF Assay result
versus the composite result of two AFB smears in U.S. and non-U.S. subjects (N=960).
Overall sensitivity of one Xpert MTB/RIF Assay in AFB smear-positive and AFB smear-
negative subjects (based on two AFB smears) was 98.5% (95% CI: 94.6%, 99.6%) and
54.8% (95% CI: 44.1%, 65.0%) respectively, and overall specificity was 98.7% (95% CI:
97.5%, 99.3%). One Xpert MTB/RIF Assay result of “MTB Not Detected" was associated
with a probability of MTB culture-positive/AFB smear-positive results of 0.4% for U.S.
subjects and 0.0% for non-U.S. subjects.

Xpert MTB/RIF Assay Performance in an HIV Population
To compare performance of the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected
subjects, data from Study 2 were analyzed by smear status of specimens and HIV status of
the population. Tables 7 and 8 compare the sensitivities and specificities of one Xpert
MTB/RIF Assay result in specimens obtained from HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected
subjects stratified by AFB smear-positive and AFB smear-negative results, respectively. For
both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected subjects, the sensitivity of the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay
for detection of MTB-complex was higher in AFB smear-positive specimens (100.0% and
97.8%, respectively) than in AFB smear-negative specimens (52.1% and 58.3%,
respectively). These data are summarized in Table 8.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The likelihood that a positive test result is a true positive will vary based on the prevalence
of the tuberculosis in the population being tested and whether the AFB smear is positive or
negative.
In two multicenter prospective clinical evaluations of Xpert MTB/RIF Assay
performance in subjects in the United States with suspected active TB, overall
prevalence of culture-confirmed disease was 13.2%. Of subjects with culture confirmed
TB, 71.6% were AFB smear-positive.

Predictive Values for One Xpert MTB/RIF Assay Result
Hypothetical estimated positive and negative predictive values of MTB detection for
different prevalence rates for detecting MTB using the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay are shown
in Table 9. These calculations are based on hypothetical prevalences and the overall
sensitivity and specificity (when compared to culture) observed in the multi-center clinical
studies. The sensitivity of the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay for AFB smear-positive specimens was
99.4% (479/482) and sensitivity for AFB smear-negative specimens was 67.2% (135/201).
Overall specificity of Xpert MTB/RIF Assay was 98.7% (1355/1373). The prevalence of
MTB was 11.8% in the first U.S. prospective study and 14.2% in the second prospective U.S.
study.

Predictive Values Based on Two Xpert MTB/RIF Assay Results
Hypothetical estimated positive and negative predictive values of MTB detection for
different prevalence rates for detecting MTB using two Xpert MTB/RIF Assay results are
shown in Table 10. These calculations are based on hypothetical prevalence and the overall
sensitivity and specificity (when compared to culture) observed in the second of the two
multi-center studies where two Xpert MTB/RIF Assays were performed on each subject.
The sensitivity of two Xpert MTB/RIF Assay results for AFB smear-positive specimens was
100% (133/133) and the sensitivity for AFB smear-negative specimens was 69.4% (59/85).
Overall specificity of two Xpert MTB/RIF Assay results was 97.9% (746/762).

Shelf-Life Testing Update:
The Xpert MTB/RIF Assay shelf-life studies have demonstrated acceptable stability using
real-time stability results and linear regression analysis for a shelf-life of 24 months when
reagents and cartridges are stored at 2-28°C.
The shelf-life stability of the product was evaluated at four temperatures (5°+ 3°C, 25° +
3°C, 35º + 3°C, and 45º + 3°C) at predefined time points up to 36 months, following the
study plan described in the 510k submission. At the 24 month time point and subsequent
time points, the storage condition at 25° + 3°C was changed to 30° + 3°C and the storage
condition of 35º + 3°C was changed to 37º + 2°C.
