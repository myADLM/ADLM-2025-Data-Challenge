L. Test Principle:
The PA500 Portrait Analyzer automates and integrates sample lysis, genomic DNA
extraction, amplification, and detection of target sequence using PCR technology. An aliquot
of the enriched media culture is placed into the sample port of the Test Cartridge for
processing. Multiple fluidic channels are used to move reagents through chambers where
reagent mixing and sample processing occur.
Briefly, genomic DNA is extracted from microbial cells and diluted to reduce potential
inhibitors of the PCR reaction. In a duplex PCR, biotin-labeled primers enable amplification
of specific nucleic acid sequences within the cfb gene for identification of S. agalactiae
species and to an additional sample processing control (SPC) bacterial construct. Following
PCR, biotin-labeled, amplified target DNA sequences are hybridized to sequence specific
capture probes immobilized on the silicon chip surface, then incubated with anti-biotin
antibody conjugated to the horseradish peroxidase enzyme. The unbound conjugate is
removed by washing, and tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) is added to produce a colored
precipitate at the location of the probe/target sequence complex. The resulting signal is
detected by the automated Portrait Optical Reader within the PA500 Portrait Analyzer
System. A self-contained waste chamber within the Test Cartridge collects and stores
reagent waste. All reagents are contained within the assay test cartridge.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A panel of five samples with varying concentrations of two different GBS strains
[ATCC BAA1177 (GBS serotype Ia) and ATCC 12403 (GBS serotype III)] were
tested by 2 operators each in triplicate on 5 non-consecutive days at 3 sites for a total
of 90 replicates (30 at each site) tested for each sample. Eight different GBS Assay
cartridge lots were used across the three testing sites.
Moderate positive (2-3X LoD) and low positive (1-2X LoD) concentrations of GBS
strains were made by spiking the respective cultures into a negative clinical LIM
broth matrix. True Negative samples consisted of only a negative clinical LIM broth
matrix. The negative clinical LIM broth matrix was defined as clinical specimens
made up of LIM broth matrix previously inoculated with vaginal/rectal swabs and
determined to be GBS negative. All study participants were blinded to the identity
and expected result for each sample. The results are summarized in Table 1.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls
Sample Processing Control (SPC): The SPC controls for all analytical steps in the
procedure for each cartridge tested. The SPC is a strain of protein-stabilized Bacillus
cells lyophilized within the Portrait GBS Test Cartridge. The SPC is enzymatically
lysed concurrently with the sample specimen. A region of the SPC is targeted for
amplification by the PCR and detected by target-specific capture probes on the chip
surface. The SPC may not amplify in a high-positive specimen, and in this case will
not be required during the diagnostic calling of a GBS Positive. If the SPC fails in the
absence of GBS target detection, the test result will be INVALID and the test should
be repeated.
Fiducial Controls: Establish orientation of the silicon chip for image analysis.
Hybridization Detection Control (HC): The HC consists of a biotinylated
oligonucleotide that is complementary to a capture probe attached to the silicon chip
surface. The HC confirms the integrity of all reagents after PCR and steps leading to
signal generation and detection. Failure of HC detection results in an INVALID call,
which indicates the test should be repeated.
LIM Broth Stability
The stability of LIM broth cultures was evaluated at room temperature for up to 16
hours and 2-8°C for up to 5 days. Two strains of GBS (ATCC BAA1177 and ATCC
12403) were spiked into negative clinical LIM broth matrix at 2X and 10X LoD and
held across the claimed storage times. Under conditions of this study, all samples
were identified correctly with no difference in performance at any time point tested.
d. Detection limit (LoD):
A study was performed to determine the limit of detection (LoD) of the Portrait GBS
Assay with two different strains of GBS—ATCC strain 12403 (serotype III) and
ATCC strain BAA1177 (serotype Ia). The strains tested were serially diluted into
clinical LIM broth matrix previously inoculated with vaginal/rectal swabs and
determined to be GBS negative. The initial analytical sensitivity was determined
using 4-5 serial dilutions for each strain as shown in Table 2. The LoD was then
established with 20 replicates of each strain. All concentrations were verified by
colony counting (CFU/ml). The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration of GBS at
which a minimum of 19 of 20 replicates were positive. The LoD results are shown in
Table 3.

g. Interference:
Microbial Interference
The Portrait GBS Assay was evaluated for microbial interference using the same
panel of human DNA and non-target microflora (bacteria, yeast, viral stock strains)
tested in the Cross-Reactivity Study. Concentrations of potentially interfering DNA
and microorganisms were similar to levels stated in the Cross-Reactivity Study.
Strains were spiked into negative clinical LIM broth matrix containing GBS at a low
positive concentration of 1-2X LoD. Studies assessed the detection of two GBS
strains—ATCC BAA1177 (serotype Ia) and ATCC 12403 (serotype III). A minimum
of three replicates for each target/non-target suspension was tested with the Portrait
GBS Assay. Out of the test panel, only Enterococcus durans interfered with the
detection of GBS. When GBS strain ATCC 12403 was spiked into culture negative
LIM broth at a concentration of 1-2X LoD, 4/10 runs in the presence of Enterococcus
durans yielded a GBS “negative” call. However, when the concentration of ATCC
12403 was increased to 3X LoD, no interference was observed with Enterococcus
durans in 6/6 runs. A statement reporting Enterococcus durans interference with
GBS detection was added to the package insert. Three ‘Invalid’ calls were recorded
during the microbial interference study; however, when all three invalids were re-run,
the correct call was observed.
Interfering Substances
The potentially inhibiting substances listed in the table below were tested with the
Portrait GBS Assay in triplicate. Results of the study yielded no inhibitory effects for
GBS positive specimens in the presence of any of the interfering substances. All
replicates of positive specimens using ATCC BAA1177 (serotype Ia) and ATCC
12403 (serotype III) were correctly reported as ‘GBS positive’ at 1-2X LoD
concentration with the assay. Only one ‘Invalid’ run was reported with contraceptive
gel and strain ATCC 12403. The list of potentially interfering substances is shown in
Table 6.

Carry-over/Cross-contamination Study
A Carry-over/Cross-contamination Study was conducted for the Portrait GBS Assay by
alternatively testing high titered GBS samples (>107 CFU/ml) followed by true negative
samples. Six runs were performed on each of six Portrait GBS analyzers (6 instruments x
6 runs = 36 total runs). Samples were prepared in negative clinical LIM broth matrix. All
results yielded the expected results with no cross-contamination events reported.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Performance characteristics of the Portrait GBS Assay were evaluated at 3 institutions
in the U.S. using the PA500 Portrait Analyzer System. Subjects included individuals
whose standard of care screening called for the collection of vaginal/rectal swab
specimens for GBS testing. Specimens for the clinical study consisted of excess
leftover de-identified LIM broth cultures from pregnant women at 35 – 37 weeks of
gestation. These specimens were initially collected using a standard double swab
(vaginal and rectal) for GBS testing, placed into transport media, and then inoculated
into LIM broth for an overnight incubation (18-29 hours) at 35°C (+/- 2°C). An
aliquot of leftover LIM broth was used for testing by the Portrait GBS Assay,
reference culture method, and comparator molecular methods.
Over the course of the Clinical Study, 518 samples were collected from all three sites.
70 samples did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria (incubation between 18-29
hours) and, therefore, were not included for the purpose of performance evaluation.
The remaining 448 clinical specimens were used to evaluate the performance of the
Portrait GBS Assay in comparison to the reference culture method. Enriched LIM
broths were subcultured to 5% sheep blood agar plates and incubated at 24 hours at
35°C (+/-2°C) with 5% CO . If no growth was observed, then plates were incubated
2
for an additional 24 hours. Suspected GBS colonies (both hemolytic and non-
hemolytic) were gram stained and tested with catalase reagent. Gram-positive,
catalase negative colonies were confirmed as GBS by latex agglutination testing.
The Portrait GBS Assay demonstrated an overall sensitivity and specificity for
detection of GBS colonization of 97.9% and 96.0%, respectively, relative to the
reference culture method. The initial invalid rate for the Portrait GBS Assay was
2.01% (9/448) across all three sites. After re-testing, all invalids were resolved
yielding a final invalid rate of 0% for the Portrait GBS Assay. Table 7 and Table 8
show performance of the Portrait GBS Assay across all sites and for each site,
respectively.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Approximately 10-30% of pregnant women may be colonized with GBS in the vagina or
rectum. Culture screening for GBS in pregnant women at 35-37 weeks gestation is used
as an indicator of women who may be colonized with GBS at the time of delivery.
During clinical evaluation for the assay, 23.9% (107/448) of women were reported as
positive for GBS DNA by the Portrait GBS Assay. 21.2% (95/448) of women were
colonized with GBS according to the reference culture method.
