Traceability and Value Assignment:
Value assignment for IDS-iSYS CTX-I Calibration Verifiers was performed on the
IDS-iSYS Multi-Discipline Automated Analyzer using assigned reference calibrators.
The reference calibrators are traceable to in-house reference standards (CTX-I in
horse serum). The lot-specific assigned target value of each calibrator verifier was
calculated using the mean of all runs (3 replicates x 3 analyzers x 5 runs). The
assigned target value of each calibrator verifier was defined as the mean of all the
runs for each calibrator verifier. The Guideline Range of each calibrator verifier level
was defined as the target mean ± 2SD. The lot-specific target values are provided in
the IDS-iSYS CTX-I Calibration Verifiers Certificate of Analysis. The following
target mean values and ranges for each calibrator verifier are intended to be used as a
guide only. Values may vary from lot to lot.

Stability:
An accelerated stability study was performed to support closed-vial shelf life claim.
The stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
adequate. All acceptance criteria were met and support a shelf life stability claim of
12 months when stored at 2-8oC. Real time stability study protocols and acceptance
criteria were reviewed and found acceptable. A real time stability study to support the
shelf life stability claim is ongoing.
On board stability studies were performed to validate the on board stability claims for
the IDS-iSYS CTX-I Calibration Verifiers. All acceptance criteria were met and
support a stability claim of 3 hours when stored on board the IDS-iSYS Multi-
Discipline Automated Analyzer at 23°C±3°C.
