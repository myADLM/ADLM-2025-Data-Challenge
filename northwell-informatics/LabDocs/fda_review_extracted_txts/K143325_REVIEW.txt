I. Device Description:
OC-Light S FIT is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic device designed for the immunochemical
detection of human hemoglobin (hHb) in stool specimens.
1. Components of OC-Light S FIT: OC-Light S FIT consists of a test strip and a sampling
bottle.
a. OC-Light S FIT test strip consists of a nitrocellulose membrane with immobilized
mouse monoclonal antibodies specific to human hemoglobin at the test region and
immobilized rabbit anti-mouse antibodies at the control region, a sample pad, a
conjugate pad which contains human hemoglobin specific mouse monoclonal
antibodies conjugated with colloidal gold, an absorption pad, and a plastic backing.
b. OC-Light S FIT sampling bottle is a plastic bottle for collecting fecal sample. It
contains 2.0 mL of extraction buffer. The sampling bottle is specially designed for:
i. Proper sampling of feces: Sample probe is attached to the top bottle cap. The
sample probe insertion slot is designed to rub off excess amount of stool before
it reaches the area with extraction buffer, enabling only stool caught in the
grooved portion (approximately 10 mg) of the sample probe to be mixed with
the buffer solution.
ii. Thorough mixing of fecal sample with extraction buffer: Sample probe itself
acts as a stopper, preventing excess amount of collected stool from entering into
the extraction buffer area and buffer solution from leaking outside.

L. Test Principle:
OC-Light S FIT is a qualitative test designed for the immunochemical detection of human
hemoglobin (hHb) in stool specimens. When the sample end of test strip is dipped in the fecal
extract, the liquid fecal extract wicks through a series of absorbent materials and contacts
colloidal gold conjugated with monoclonal antibodies specific to hHb. If hHb is present in the
sample, it reacts with the antibodies on the colloidal gold. When the gold conjugate with hHb
reaches the test region of the membrane, it binds with the immobilized antibodies also specific
to hHb to form visible reddish/pink line. The procedural control region of the membrane
contains anti-mouse antibodies that capture any unreacted/excess antibody-gold conjugates,
forming a distinct reddish/pink line. The reddish/pink line in the procedural control region
demonstrates the validity of the test.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The repeatability of OC-Light S FIT was evaluated at one intended use site, using one
test kit lot and one operator. The repeatability study was performed using 21 replicates
of fecal test samples collected in OC-Light S FIT sampling bottles from Hb-free stool
specimens spiked with human blood to obtain test samples containing seven different
concentrations of human hemoglobin: 0 µg/g stool, 5 µg/g stool, 8 µg/g stool, 10 µg/g
stool, 12 µg/g stool, 15 µg/g stool, and 400 µg/g stool, that are equivalent to 0, 25 (C5),
40 (C50, C95-20%), 50 (C95, cutoff), 60 (C95+20%), 75, and 2000 ng/mL, respectively.

Test samples were also prepared by spiking Hb-free stool specimens with known levels
of HbS supernatant to obtain fecal samples with eight different HbS concentrations and
known levels of HbC supernatant to obtain fecal samples with eight different HbC
concentrations: 0 µg/g stool, 20 µg/g stool, 100 µg/g stool, 150 µg/g stool, 200 µg/g
stool, 250 µg/g stool, 300 µg/g stool, and 400 µg/g stool, that are equivalent to 0, 100,
500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500, and 2000 ng/mL, respectively. Twenty one aliquots of each
sample concentration were mixed with extraction buffer and tested in randomized order.
FOBT-CHECK ‘Negative and Positive Controls’ were also tested to ensure and confirm
the validity of the test results of the test prozone/hook effect study. OC-Light S FIT was
not found susceptible to prozone/hook effect as it would display positive test results with
fecal samples containing a hemoglobin concentration up to 2000 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Internal Control: Procedural controls are included in the test device. A reddish/pink line
appearing the control region is considered as the internal procedural control. It confirms
sufficient specimen volume, adequate membrane wicking and correct procedural
technique.
External Control: Controls are not provided with this kit. It is recommended that positive
and negative controls be performed to verify proper test performance. The FOBT-CHEK
Control Kit, cleared under K041297, is recommended for use as the external controls.
Stability Studies
1. Stability of fecal samples
Samples for stability testing were prepared by spiking stool samples with human
blood (of known hemoglobin level) to obtain fecal samples containing seven
different hemoglobin concentrations: 0 µg/g stool, 5 µg/g stool, 8 µg/g stool, 10 µg/g
stool, 12 µg/g stool, 15 µg/g stool, and 400 µg/g stool, that are equivalent to 0, 25
(C5), 40 (C50, C95-20%), 50 (C95, cut-off), 60 (C95+20%), 75 and 2000 ng/mL,
respectively. Twenty one aliquots of each of the seven concentrations of spiked stool
test samples were mixed with detection buffer in OC-Light S FIT sample collection
bottles and analyzed in random order.
To claim 30 days of sample stability at 2 to 8°C each sample was tested with OC-
Light S FIT and stored at 2, 4, 8, and 10°C at time points of 15, 30, and 31 days from
the start of storage. OC-Light S FIT sampling bottles must be brought back to room
temperature before testing.
To claim 15 days of sample stability at room temperature each sample was tested
with OC-Light S FIT and stored at 15, 25, 30, and 32°C at time points of 7, 15, and
16 days from the start of storage.

--- Page 7 ---
FOBT-CHECK ‘Negative and Positive Controls’ were also tested daily to ensure and
confirm the validity of the test results of the stability study. Stool samples collected
in OC-Light S FIT sampling bottles are stable up to 30 days when stored at 2 to 8°C,
and stable up to 15 days when stored at room temperature.
2. Test Kit Stability (Accelerated)
Accelerated stability study was conducted with 3 lots of OC-Light S FIT test kit (test
strips and sampling bottles). Test kit stability testing was performed by preparing 21
aliquots of spiked stool test samples collected in detection buffer in OC-Light S FIT
sample collection bottles. The Hb-free stool specimens were spiked with human
blood (of known hemoglobin level) to obtain fecal samples containing seven
different hemoglobin concentrations: 0 µg/g stool, 5 µg/g stool, 8 µg/g stool, 10 µg/g
stool, 12 µg/g stool, 15 µg/g stool, and 400 µg/g stool that are equivalent to 0, 25
(C5), 40 (C50, C95-20%), 50 (C95, cut-off), 60 (C95+20%), 75 and 2000 ng/mL,
respectively. Each spiked stool test sample was analyzed in random order. The three
lots of OC-Light S FIT test strips (contained in canisters) and sampling bottles were
stored and tested at 50°C, 56°Cand 60°C. The test kit stability was performed at the
following time intervals:
Device kit stored at 60°C: 1.04 months (31 days) from the start of storage.
Device kit stored at 56°C: 1.49 months (45 days) from the start of storage.
Device kit stored at 50°C: 2.58 months (77 days) from the start of storage.
FOBT-CHECK ‘Negative and Positive Controls’ were also tested daily to ensure and
confirm the validity of the test results of the stability study. The results showed that
the test kit was stable for an estimated period of 18 months at 30°C when Arrhenius
equation is applied.
3. Fecal Sample Shipping Stress Test
Three sets of OC-Light S FIT test kits (3 lots of test strips plus 3 lots of sampling
bottles) were evaluated during the fecal sample shipping stress test. Fecal samples
were prepared by spiking stool samples with human blood (of known hemoglobin
level) to obtain fecal samples containing seven different hemoglobin concentrations:
0 µg/g stool, 5 µg/g stool, 8 µg/g stool, 10 µg/g stool, 12 µg/g stool, 15 µg/g stool,
and 400 µg/g stool that are equivalent to 0, 25 (C5), 40 (C50, C95-20%), 50 (C95,
cut-off), 60 (C95+20%), 75 and 2000 ng/mL, respectively. Twenty one aliquots of
each of the seven concentrations of spiked stool test samples were mixed with
detection buffer in OC-Light S FIT sample collection bottles. The initial tests were
performed with randomized samples that are not stressed to confirm that all sets give
expected results. The OC-Light S FIT sampling bottles with fecal samples of known
Hb concentrations were stored at -40°C, -20°C, 30°C, 45°C, and 50°C. The stool
samples/test kit stored at -40°C and -20°C were brought to room temperature on day
1 to have a freeze-thaw cycle, and was then returned to storage. At time points of 2,
3, and 4 days from the start of storage, 147 OC-Light S FIT sampling bottles (21
aliquots of 7 Hb concentrations) of each set from the storage were taken out and
brought back to room temperature. The samples were randomized and tested with a
paired lot of OC-Light S FIT test strips. FOBT-CHECK ‘Negative and Positive
7

--- Page 8 ---
Controls’ were also tested daily to ensure and confirm the validity of the test results
of the stability study. Studies demonstrated that fecal samples collected in OC-Light
S FIT sampling bottles are stable for 3 days of storage at 45°C and stable for 3 days
with 3 freeze/thaw cycles.
4. Test Kit Shipping Stress Test
Three sets of OC-Light S FIT test kits (3 lots of test strips plus 3 lots of sampling
bottles) were evaluated during the test kit shipping stress test. The unused sets of
OC-Light S FIT test strips and sampling bottles (containing no fecal samples) were
stored at -40°C, -20°C, 30°C, 45°C, and 50°C. The test kit stored at -40°C and -20°C
were brought to room temperature on day 1 to have a freeze-thaw cycle, and was
then returned to storage. At time points 2, 3, and 4 days from the start of storage, 147
OC-Light S FIT test strips and sampling bottles of each test set from the storage were
taken out and brought back to room temperature. To evaluate the performance of
stressed test kits, fecal samples for testing were prepared by spiking stool samples
with human blood (of known hemoglobin level) to obtain fecal samples containing
seven different hemoglobin concentrations: 0 µg/g stool, 5 µg/g stool, 8 µg/g stool,
10 µg/g stool, 12 µg/g stool, 15 µg/g stool, and 400 µg/g stool that are equivalent to
0, 25 (C5), 40 (C50, C95-20%), 50 (C95, cut-off), 60 (C95+20%), 75 and 2000
ng/mL. Twenty one aliquots of each of the seven concentrations of spiked stool test
samples were mixed with detection buffer in OC-Light S FIT sample collection
bottles. The samples were randomized and tested with a paired lot of OC-Light S FIT
test strips. FOBT-CHECK ‘Negative and Positive Controls’ were also tested daily to
ensure and confirm the validity of the test results of the stability study. Studies
demonstrated that OC-Light S FIT test kits are stable for 3 days of storage at 45°C
and stable for 3 days with 3 freeze/thaw cycles.

e. Analytical specificity:
Specificity to human hemoglobin variant
The ability of OC-Light S FIT to detect human hemoglobin variants was determined by
testing hemoglobin-S (HbS) and hemoglobin-C (HbC) by preparing spiked stool samples
containing seven different hemoglobin concentrations: 0 µg/g stool, 5 µg/g stool, 8 µg/g
stool, 10 µg/g stool, 12 µg/g stool, 15 µg/g stool, and 400 µg/g stool that are equivalent
to 0, 25 (C5), 40 (C50, C95-20%), 50 (C95, cut-off), 60 (C95+20%), 75 and 2000
ng/mL, respectively. Twenty one aliquots of each of the seven concentrations (7 HbS
and 7 HbC supernatants) of spiked stool test samples were mixed with detection buffer
in OC-Light S FIT sample collection bottles. Samples were tested in a randomized order.
Results showed OC-Light S FIT equivalently recognizes variants of hemoglobin HbS
and HbC.
Cross-Reactivity
Cross-reactivity of OC-Light S FIT with animal hemoglobin was evaluated by testing
8

--- Page 9 ---
prepared test samples in OC-Light S FIT sample collection bottles by spiking Hb-free
stool specimen with known levels of human Hb solution to obtain fecal samples with
seven different Hb concentrations: 0 µg/g stool, 5 µg/g stool, 8 µg/g stool, 10 µg/g stool,
12 µg/g stool, 15 µg/g stool, and 400 µg/g stool, that are equivalent to 0, 25 (C5), 40
(C50, C95-20%), 50 (C95, cut-off), 60 (C95+20%), 75 and 2000 ng/mL, respectively.
Twenty one replicates of spiked hemoglobin-negative stool concentrations listed above
were then spiked with the intended level of respective animal hemoglobin such as bovine
(500 μg/mL), turkey (500 μg/mL), fish (500 μg/mL), equine (500 μg/mL), goat (500
μg/mL), rabbit (500 μg/mL), porcine (500 μg/mL) and sheep (500 μg/mL). All samples
were tested in a randomized order. OC-Light S FIT did not show significant cross-
reactivity with any of the animal hemoglobins tested.
Interfering Substances
Susceptibility of OC-Light S FIT to interference from extracts (animal meat and
vegetable) was evaluated by testing 21 replicates of prepared test samples by spiking
Hb-free stool specimen with known levels of human Hb solution to obtain fecal samples
with seven different Hb concentrations: 0 µg/g stool, 5 µg/g stool, 8 µg/g stool, 10 µg/g
stool, 12 µg/g stool, 15 µg/g stool, and 400 µg/g stool that are equivalent to 0, 25 (C5),
40 (C50, C95-20%), 50 (C95, cut-off), 60 (C95+20%), 75 and 2000 ng/mL, respectively.
The 21 replicates of the spiked hemoglobin-negative stool concentrations listed above
were spiked with the intended level of respective animal meat extracts: beef meat extract
(2.5%), pork meat extract (2.5%), fish meat extract (2.5%), horse meat extract (2.5%),
goat meat extract (2.5%), rabbit meat extract (2.5%), lamb meat extract (2.5%), and
chicken meat extract (2.5%).
The 21 replicates of hemoglobin-negative stool spiked listed above were also spiked
with the intended level of respective vegetable extracts: broccoli extracts (2.5%),
cantaloupe extract (2.5%), cauliflower extract (2.5%), horseradish extract (2.5%),
parsnip extract (2.5%), red radish extract (2.5%), and turnip extract (2.5%). All samples
were mixed with detection buffer in OC-Light S FIT sample collection bottles and tested
in a randomized order. OC-Light S FIT did not show significant interference from any of
the animal meat or vegetable extracts.
Interfering Supplements
Susceptibility of OC-Light S FIT to interference from iron and sodium L-ascorbate was
evaluated by testing 21 replicates of prepared test samples by spiking Hb-free stool
specimen with known levels of human Hb solution to obtain fecal samples with seven
different Hb concentrations: 0 µg/g stool, 5 µg/g stool, 8 µg/g stool, 10 µg/g stool, 12
µg/g stool, 15 µg/g stool, and 400 µg/g stool that are equivalent to 0, 25 (C5), 40 (C50,
C95-20%), 50 (C95, cut-off), 60 (C95+20%), 75 and 2000 ng/mL, respectively. The 21
replicates of spiked hemoglobin-negative stool concentrations were spiked with iron
(0.5% (w/v)), and sodium L-ascorbate (0.5% (w/v)). All samples were mixed with
detection buffer in OC-Light S FIT sample collection bottles and tested in a randomized
order. OC-Light S FIT did not show significant interference from iron and sodium L-
ascorbate.

Interference from Toilet Cleaners
Susceptibility OC-Light S FIT to interference from toilet cleaners was evaluated by
testing 21 replicates of prepared test samples by spiking Hb-free stool specimen with
known levels of human Hb solution to obtain fecal samples with seven different Hb
concentrations: 0 µg/g stool, 5 µg/g stool, 8 µg/g stool, 10 µg/g stool, 12 µg/g stool, 15
µg/g stool, and 400 µg/g stool that are equivalent to 0, 25 (C5), 40 (C50, C95-20%), 50
(C95, cut-off), 60 (C95+20%), 75 and 2000 ng/mL respectively. The 21 replicates of
spiked hemoglobin-negative stool concentrations were spiked with the following
cleaners: ef Bio (5 mg/mL), LIME A-WAY (5 mg/mL), Nuriper (5 mg/mL), Lysol
bleach (5 mg/mL), Lysol cleaner (5 mg/mL), Scrubbing Bubbles (5 mg/mL). All
samples were mixed with detection buffer in OC-Light S FIT sample collection bottles
and tested in a randomized order. OC-Light S FIT did not show significant interference
from substances contained in the tested toilet cleaners.
FOBT-CHECK ‘Negative and Positive Controls’ were also tested to ensure and confirm
the validity of the test results of the interference studies.
f. Assay cut-off:
Fecal test samples for cut-off testing were prepared by spiking stool samples with human
blood (of known hemoglobin level) to obtain fecal samples containing seven different
hemoglobin concentrations: 0 µg/g stool, 5 µg/g stool, 8 µg/g stool, 10 µg/g stool, 12
µg/g stool, 15 µg/g stool, and 400 µg/g stool that are equivalent to 0, 25 (C5), 40 (C50,
C95-20%), 50 (C95, cut-off), 60 (C95+20%), 75 and 2000 ng/mL, respectively. Twenty
one aliquots of each of the seven concentrations of spiked stool test samples were mixed
with detection buffer in OC-Light S FIT sample collection bottles and Polymedco OC-
Light FOB Test sample bottles. Samples were tested in randomized order. Testing was
performed side-by-side with the predicate by comparing the test results of the device
with that of the predicate. Cut-off was determined to be 10 μg hemoglobin/g stool or 50
ng/mL (hemoglobin in fecal sample mixed with detection buffer).

A method comparison of OC-Light S FIT with the predicate test, Polymedco OC-Light
FOB Test, was conducted by assessing patient samples and one Hb-spiked sample of
known concentration at 75 ng/mL (near the cut-off) at each intended use site, physician
office laboratories (POLs) and professional medical laboratories (PMLs). The FOBT-
CHEK external controls (positive and negative) were run prior to testing. Statistical
analysis of site-wise test results as well as combined results showed that OC-Light S FIT
test results have acceptable overall percent agreement as well as positive percent
agreement and negative percent agreement with Polymedco OC-Light FOB test results.

3. Specimen Identification:
Enter patient identification information manually on the label of the Sampling Bottle.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
It is recommended that the laboratory should give the OC-Light S FIT Sample Collection
Bottle to the patient so that the patient can collect the fecal sample and do the sampling
himself/herself and submit it to the laboratory for testing as per the appropriate instructions
received from the laboratory. The sample must be returned or mailed to the
doctor/laboratory within 5 days of sampling. The laboratory may store sample at room
temperature for up to 15 days or can be refrigerated at 2–8°C (36–46°F) for up to 30 days.
5. Calibration:
Not applicable
6. Quality Control:
Internal Control: The Procedural Control is found in the Procedural Control Region of the
Test Strip to assure the operator that (a) sample addition and migration through the test strip
has occurred and (b) the control anti-mouse antibody and the reporter MAb are intact and
functional. This control does not ensure that the capture antibody is accurately detecting the
presence or absence of Hb in the sample.
External controls: External controls are used to assure the operator that the capture and
conjugated antibodies are present and reactive. Controls should be assayed according to
manufacturer instructions once per kit lot, following the local and state guidelines. If
controls do not perform as expected, the test results should not be used.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Test Kit Reaction Time:
Reaction time test samples were prepared by spiking Hb-free stool specimen with known
levels of human Hb solution to obtain fecal samples with seven different Hb concentrations:
0, 25 (C5), 40 (C50, C95-20%), 50(C95, cut-off), 60 (C95+20%), 75 and 2000 ng/mL. Each
sample was collected with 21 OC-Light S FIT sampling bottles and tested in a randomized
order. The test was performed in-house with OC-Light S FIT test strips and the results read
at 3, 5, 10, and 30 minutes. Positivity rate of 25ng/mL was 0%, positivity rate of 40ng/mL
was 43%, and positivity rate of 50ng/mL was 100% at 5 minutes of reaction, and the
appropriate reaction time of OC-Light S FIT was demonstrated as 5 minutes. The
appropriate reaction time of OC-Light S FIT was demonstrated as 5 minutes.

2. Operator Intensity Reading:
The operator intensity reading test was performed by utilizing seven (7) levels of stool
samples spiked with Hb concentrations by adding human Hb to Hb-free stool samples with
concentrations at 0, 25, 37.5 (C95-25%), 50 (C95, cut-off), 62.5(C95 +25%), 75, and 2000
ng/mL. The negative and positive controls were performed in the same manner as the spiked
stool test samples. Five groups of samples were created, each group consisting of seven
samples per concentration and controls each tested in a randomized order. Five participant
readers from an intended use site analyzed the group of samples and recorded the results and
graded the intensity of the test line from 6 levels: N (negative), F (faint), 1+, 2+, 3+, and 4+.
The intensity of the test line increased in correlation with the Hb concentration of stool test
samples. There was no statistical significance in the analyses of the test samples performed
by the operators for the intensity reading test study.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports substantial
equivalence decision.
