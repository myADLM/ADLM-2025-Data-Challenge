I. Device Description:
The AmpliVue® Trichomonas Assay is a self-contained disposable amplicon detection
device that uses an isothermal amplification technology named Helicase-Dependent
Amplification (HDA) for the detection of Trichomonas vaginalis in clinician-collected
vaginal swabs from symptomatic and asymptomatic women. The assay targets a conserved
multi-copy sequence of the T. vaginalis genomic DNA.
The vaginal swab is eluted in a lysis tube, and the cells are lysed by heat treatment. After heat
treatment, an aliquot of the lysed specimen is transferred into a dilution tube. An aliquot of
this diluted sample is then added to a reaction tube containing a lyophilized mix of HDA
reagents including primers specific for the amplification of a conserved DNA sequence only
found in T. vaginalis. The assay includes an internal control for monitoring the integrity of
the assay reagents and detection cassette as well as for monitoring HDA-inhibitors that may
be present within the clinical specimens. The HDA reaction is asymmetric generating an
excess of single-stranded DNA amplicons. The sequence specific capture probes as well as a
biotinylated detection probe shared by both target and internal control bind to the
corresponding single-stranded amplicons, forming dual labeled probe-amplicon hybrid.
After completion of the HDA reaction, the reaction tube is transferred to a cassette for rapid
detection and test result display. The dual-labeled probe-amplicon hybrid is detected by the
lateral flow strip within the cassette. The bottom line captures the T. vaginalis amplicon and
the top line captures the control amplicon. The biotin label binds the streptavidin-conjugated
color particles for visualization and the test result is shown as a visible colored lines.

--- Page 3 ---
The cassette is comprised of two individual components: an amplicon cartridge that holds the
running buffer and a single 0.2 mL thin wall reaction tube containing the amplified product;
and the detection chamber which houses the amplicon cartridge and a vertical-flow DNA
detection strip embedded into the cassette. The DNA detection strip is coated with different
anti-hapten antibodies that serve as the T. vaginalis test (T) line and the control (C) line in the
assay. A razor blade and a plastic pin located at the bottom of the detection chamber open the
HDA reaction tube and the running buffer bulb when the handle of the cassette is closed. The
mixture flows through a fiberglass paper connected to the DNA detection strip containing a
fiberglass pad pre-loaded with streptavidin-conjugated color particles for color visualization.
Detection of T. vaginalis DNA is reported whenever the T2 (Test line 2) is visible through
the detection window of the cassette. The presence of T1 line is an invalid result for this
assay and the test should be repeated with the lysed specimen. The presence of the C line is
not required for positive results. No detection of T. vaginalis DNA is reported when only the
C line is displayed. The assay is regarded as invalid when neither line is displayed.

L. Test Principle:
The AmpliVue® Trichomonas Assay uses HAD to detect T. vaginalis genomic DNA in
vaginal swab specimens. The vaginal swab is eluted in a lysis tube, and the cells are lysed by
heat treatment. An aliquot of the lysed specimen is transferred into a dilution tube which is
then added to a reaction tube containing a lyophilized mix of HDA reagents including
primers specific for the amplification of a conserved DNA sequence of T. vaginalis. The
reaction tube also includes an internal control to confirm the integrity of the assay reagents
and cassette detection as well as to monitor for HDA-inhibitors that may be present within
the clinical specimens. The sequence specific capture probes as well as a biotinylated
detection probe are shared by T. vaginalis target sequences and the internal control bind to
the corresponding single-stranded amplicons (product of HDA reaction), forming a dual
labeled probe-amplicon hybrid.
After completion of the HDA reaction, the reaction tube is transferred to a cassette for rapid
detection. The test result is displayed in the window of the cassette as test and/or control
colored lines visible to the naked eye.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
With-in laboratory Precision
With-in laboratory precision for AmpliVue® Trichomonas Assay was determined via a
study, where a four-member panel (3x LoD (Moderate positive), 1x LoD (Low positive),
1/9x LoD (High negative, C to C ), and a negative sample) was tested at one site in a
20 80
random manner by two operators, three samples per concentration, twice a day for 12
days.
All negative samples generated negative results for T. vaginalis. The percent agreement
with positive results for High negative samples is 39% (within the target range of 20 to
80%). A 100% agreement was observed with expected results for Low positive and
Moderate positive samples.

stored at room temperature and one set was tested and stored at 2-8°C. Each set was
further processed, amplified and detected at times 0, 24, 48, 72, and 73 hours. The
resulting data showed that the sample eluted into the Lysis buffer was stable at both
room temperature and 2-8°C for up to 72 hours.
Controls:
Controls were run on the AmpliVue® Trichomonas Assay each day of testing. Quidel
Molecular Trichomonas Control Set #M119 contains positive and negative controls
and serves as an external processing and extraction control. These controls are
described as follows:
a. The internal control is used to detect HDA inhibitory specimens and to
confirm the integrity of assay reagents and cassette detection. The internal
control is included in the reaction tube.
b. The External assay positive control listed in “Materials Required But Not
Provided” in the Package Insert contains intact non-viable trophozoites and
has titers near the limit of detection for the assay. The external assay positive
control is intended for monitoring substantial reagent and cassette failure.
c. The External assay negative control listed in “Materials Required But Not
Provided” is the same matrix as the positive control, but is trophozoite-free.
The external assay negative control is intended for detection of reagent or
environment contamination or carry-over by either T. vaginalis DNA or
amplicons.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) of the AmpliVue® Trichomonas Assay was determined
using quantified (trophozoite/mL) stocks of two T. vaginalis strains, one
metronidazole-susceptible G3 and one metronidazole-resistant CDC888 serially
diluted in negative vaginal matrix. The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration at
which 95% of all replicates tested positive.
The strains were freshly grown and quantified using a hemocytometer. The cells were
serially diluted in Liquid Stuart medium with negative vaginal matrix at five
concentrations in the preliminary LoD determination study. Each dilution was tested
as 10 replicates on three reagent lots.
LoD was confirmed by testing each reference strain with 20 replicates on three
reagent lots in the negative vaginal matrix.
The assay LoD for T. vaginalis strain G3 is 307 trophozoites/mL and for strain
CDC888 is 921 trophozoites/mL.

e. Reactivity:
A study was performed to verify the in silico inclusivity results with functional
testing of the AmpliVue® Trichomonas Assay using 20 additional strains of
Trichomonas vaginalis tested in triplicate at concentrations near the LoD.

Trichomonas Assay with 45 microorganisms (36 bacteria, 4 yeasts, 4 viruses, 1
parasite) potentially found in specimens collected for testing T. vaginalis infection.
Cross-reactive microorganisms (or DNA/RNA) were tested at clinically relevant
levels of viruses (≥105pfu/mL or genome copies/mL), bacteria, yeast, and parasite
(≥106cfu/mL or genome copies/mL). All organisms were diluted in Liquid Stuart
medium and tested in negative vaginal matrix in triplicate using the AmpliVue®
Trichomonas assay. The organisms included in the cross-reactivity study and their
tested concentrations are shown in the table below.

No cross-reactivity was observed with the AmpliVue® Trichomonas Assay when
testing any of the 45 microorganisms.
Microbial Interference:
The 45 microorganisms tested in cross-reactivity study were evaluated in the presence
of each of the two T. vaginalis strains (G3 and CDC888) at 2x LoD level. Each
microorganism was diluted in Liquid Stuart medium to the desired concentration (106
or higher CFU/mL or genome copies/mL for bacteria, yeast, parasite or DNA/RNA
and 105 or higher pfu/mL or TCID50/mL or genome copies/mL for viruses), and
tested in triplicate in negative vaginal matrix. No interference was observed with the
detection of each of the two T. vaginalis strains in the AmpliVue® Trichomonas
Assay.
g. Interference:
A study was conducted to determine whether the AmpliVue® Trichomonas Assay is
inhibited in the presence of 13 substances potentially present in specimens collected
for T. vaginalis infection testing. Each of the potential interfering substances was
tested in three replicates in the presence and absence of T. vaginalis strains G3 and
CDC888 at 2x LoD in a negative vaginal matrix. Substances were tested at medically
relevant concentrations. No interference was observed by the substances tested and
listed in the table below.

i. Carryover-Cross Contamination:
In the Carryover-Cross Contamination study High positive samples (containing
approximately 2.5x 106 trophozoites/mL) were tested in series alternating with
negative samples, and a minimum of five runs were performed between two
operators. For each run, five replicates of T. vaginalis high positive sample in Liquid
Stuart medium alternating with five replicates of negative Liquid Stuart medium were
tested in the AmpliVue® Trichomonas Assay along with an external positive control
and an external negative control. In total, five runs consisting of five samples positive
for T. vaginalis and five negative samples were tested by two operators for a total of
50 positive and 50 negative samples.
Consecutive testing of alternating T. vaginalis high positive samples and T. vaginalis
negative samples resulted in no carry over or cross contamination.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
A multi-center study was conducted to evaluate the AmpliVue® Trichomonas Assay
from April to November 2014. A total of 992 clinician-collected vaginal swab
specimens were obtained from symptomatic (n=342) or asymptomatic (n=650)
patients at four locations in the United States and one location in Canada. Specimens
were obtained from each subject after informed consent was obtained.
For each subject, three vaginal specimens were collected using polyester or rayon
Swabs w/ Liquid Stuart’s, and one vaginal specimen collected with a collection swab
from a FDA-cleared molecular device. The four clinician collected vaginal swabs
were used for reference testing and AmpliVue® Trichomonas Assay. The first two
polyester/rayon swabs were randomized, one swab was tested for the Wet Mount
(reference method) and the other swab was used for the InPouch TV Culture
(reference method). The third swab was used for testing the AmpliVue® Trichomonas
Assay. The FDA-cleared molecular device collection swab was used for discordant
testing.
All sensitivity and specificity calculations were based on a composite reference
method of Wet Mount and InPouch TV culture. The specimen was considered as
positive for T. vaginalis if either the wet mount or the T. vaginalis culture was
positive. The specimen was considered negative for T. vaginalis if both of the
reference methods were negative.
One specimen was removed from the study due to a delay in the culture inoculation.
Eight specimens yielded invalid results upon initial testing with the AmpliVue®
Trichomonas Assay (0.8%). Upon re-testing six of the specimens yielded valid results
(5 negative and 1 positive results). Two specimens yielded a second invalid result
(0.2%). The table below shows the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the
AmpliVue® Trichomonas Assay and the prevalence of T. vaginalis (by asymptomatic,
symptomatic status and combined) in the study population.
