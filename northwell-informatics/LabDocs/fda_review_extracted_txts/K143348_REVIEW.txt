E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The BC-3600 Auto Hematology Analyzer is a quantitative, automated hematology
analyzer and leukocyte differential counter for in vitro diagnostic use in clinical
laboratories. It is only to be used by trained medical professionals to identify the normal
patient, with all normal system-generated parameters, and to flag or identify patient
results that require additional studies. The analyzer provides analysis results for 16
parameters of human blood and three histograms.
The BC-3600 Auto Hematology Analyzer system consists of: the BC-3600 Auto
Hematology Analyzer, M-30D Diluent, M-30CFL Lyse, M-30R Rinse, Probe Cleanser,
BC-3D Controls (low, normal and high), and SC-CAL PLUS Calibrator.
2. Principles of Operation:
The BC-3600 Auto Hematology Analyzer (hereafter referred to as BC-3600) uses the
impedance method to count and measure the size of WBC, RBC and PLT in human
whole blood. The WBC, RBC and PLT are counted in a dedicated channel using the
measurement of changes in electrical resistance. These blood cells are suspended in a
conductive diluent and hydrodynamic technology is used to ensure the cells pass through
an aperture of known dimensions. The intensity of the electronic pulse from the cells
passing through the aperture is proportional to the cell volume. HGB is determined by the
colorimetric method. In addition, the analyzer uses a volumetric metering unit to control
the count cycle and to ensure that a precise volume of sample is analyzed for the
measurement.

WBC (103/μL) is the number of leukocytes measured directly by counting the white
blood cells passing through the aperture. The analyzer presents a WBC histogram, whose
x-coordinate represents the cell volume (fL), and y-coordinate represents the number of
cells. With the help of the diluent and lyse, this analyzer can size the white blood cells
into three subpopulations: lymphocytes, mid-sized cells (including monocytes, basophils
and eosinophils) and granulocytes (neutrophils). Based on the WBC histogram, the
analyzer calculates the Lymph %, Mid %, and Gran % and expresses the results in
percentage.
RBC (106/μL) is the number of erythrocytes measured directly by counting the
erythrocytes passing through the aperture. The analyzer also presents a RBC histogram,
where the x-coordinate represents the cell volume (fL) and y-coordinate represents the
number of cells. Based on the RBC histogram, the analyzer calculates the mean cell
volume (MCV) and expresses the result in fL. In addition, the analyzer calculates the
Coefficient of Variation of the erythrocyte distribution width (RDW).
HGB is determined by the colorimetric method and expressed in g/dL. In addition, the
analyzer uses a volumetric metering unit to control the count cycle and to ensure that a
precise volume of sample is analyzed for the measurement.
PLT (103/μL) is measured directly by counting the platelets passing through the aperture.

reproducibility studies across three clinical laboratory sites.
The repeatability study was conducted with normal and abnormal venous whole blood
samples collected in K EDTA collection containers. The samples were selected to span
2
the lower, normal and upper limits of the analytical measuring range. Each sample was
analyzed 10 consecutive times in the whole blood and predilute analysis modes.
Reproducibility performance was conducted over 20 operating days utilizing three
levels of commercial control material (BC-3D low, normal, and high) performing two
runs per day and two replicates per run, yielding a total of 80 replicates per control
level. To further demonstrate precision performance, SD and CV% of within-run,
between-run, between-day, and within-device were calculated per site and for the
combined sites as shown below.

c. Linearity
Linearity of the WBC, PLT, RBC, and HGB parameters was evaluated on three
instruments at one clinical laboratory site. WBC and PLT linearity samples were
derived from commercial linearity material diluted to different levels spanning the
targeted range. Fresh whole blood diluted to different levels was utilized for RBC and
HGB linear range studies. Relative concentrations of each dilution were obtained using
the density-weight method.

d. Carryover
Carryover was determined for the following parameters: WBC, RBC, HGB and PLT.
Testing was performed to test the different analytical cycle combinations of within-
mode for whole blood, within-mode for predilute and mode-to-mode.
For whole blood and predilute sampling, within-mode and mode-to-mode sampling
carryover were tested. To assess within-mode carryover of the whole blood and
predilute modes, three high concentration (H1, H2, and H3) samples were
consecutively analyzed followed by three low concentration (L1, L2, and L3) samples.
To assess whole blood to predilute mode carryover three whole blood high
concentration samples were analyzed followed by three consecutive runs of low
concentration pre-diluted samples. To assess predilute to whole blood mode carryover,
three high concentration prediluted samples were analyzed followed by three

consecutive runs of low concentration whole blood samples.
Carryover % was determined using the following calculation: % Carryover =
(LTV1−LTV3) / (HTV3−LTV3) × 100. The results of the carryover study were within
the predefined specifications of ≤ 0.5% for WBC, RBC, HGB, and ≤ 1.0% for PLT.
e. Interfering Substances
A study was conducted to determine the interference level of bilirubin and intralipid
with the hematology results of the BC-3600 analyzer. Ten whole blood samples were
collected for each interference study and contrived with commercially derived bilirubin
or intralipid. Each sample was contrived to yield five interferent concentrations and
analyzed in the whole blood analysis mode.
There was no significant bilirubin interference up to a concentration of 500 mg/L for
the WBC, Lymph#, Mid#, Gran#, Lymph%, Mid%, Gran%, RBC, HCT, MCV, MCH,
MCHC, RDW, PLT and MPV parameters; and no significant bilirubin interference up
to a concentration of 40 mg/L for the HGB parameter.
There was no significant intralipid interference up to a concentration of 11.7 g/L for the
following parameter: WBC, Lymph#, Mid#, Gran#, Lymph%, Mid%, Gran%, RBC,
HCT, MCV, RDW, PLT and MPV.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Sample Stability
To determine sample stability, 35 whole blood specimens collected in K EDTA were
2
analyzed in the whole blood analysis mode, and 25 whole blood specimens collected in
K EDTA were analyzed in the predilute analysis mode. Aliquots were prepared and
2
stored at the defined condition for each specimen, then analyzed in duplicate at
different time points according to the study design. When samples were stored for the
durations defined at controlled room temperature [64–79° F (18–26° C)] or at
refrigerated temperature [35.6–46.4° F (2–8° C)] the analyzer performance met the
defined acceptance criteria. Predilute whole blood sample stability is 30 minutes when
stored at 18–26°C after preparation for all parameters. Whole blood sample stability of
all parameters is listed in the following table.

c. Anticoagulant Comparison (K EDTA vs. K EDTA)
2 3
A total of 60 paired fresh whole blood samples collected in K EDTA and K EDTA
2 3
anticoagulant tubes were analyzed on the BC-3600 analyzer in the whole blood analysis
mode at one site. The samples were selected to cover the analytical measuring range
and medical decision levels for each parameter. The results were analyzed according to
CLSI EP09-A3 and were within the defined acceptance criteria.
d. Sample Matrix Comparison (venous vs. fingerstick)
A total of 52 paired whole blood specimens were collected from each subject by
capillary method in a K EDTA microtainer and by venipuncture method in a K EDTA
2 2
collection tube, and analyzed in the BC-3600 whole blood analysis mode. Specimens
were selected to cover the analytical measuring range and medical decision levels for
each parameter. The results were analyzed according to CLSI EP09-A3 and were
within the defined acceptance criteria.
e. Determination of limit of blank, lower limits of detection and quantitation
Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined using five blank samples containing the predilute
solution (diluent).
To determine the Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ), five low
level samples were derived by adding whole blood to diluent. Five replicate
measurements of the low level samples were performed in the whole blood analysis
mode to verify precision at the lower end of the analytical measuring range.

f. Background Counts
Background count specifications were verified by analyzing M-30D Diluent in the
whole blood and predilute analysis modes. The results demonstrated that the
background counts were within the predefined acceptance criteria.

g. Reference Intervals
Adult reference intervals were assessed utilizing whole blood samples collected from
255 normal subjects between the ages of 19–85 (124 male and 131 female),
representative of the United States population. The non-parametric method was utilized
to calculate the lower and upper limits of the reference ranges. Confidence intervals for
the reference limits were calculated using a 90% probability (90% CI).
