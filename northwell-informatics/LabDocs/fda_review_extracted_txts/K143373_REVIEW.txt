a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Value assignment and stability studies were performed on the IMMULITE 2000
analyzer.
Value assignment:
Value Assignment for the IMMULITE 2000 Calcitonin CVM was based on using
assigned reference calibrators. The assigned reference calibrators were prepared using
Calcitonin antigen stock traceable to WHO 2nd IRP 89/620. The CVM was tested on
27 replicates (in total comprised of 9 runs, 3 replicates per run) on 8 IMMULITE
2000 systems, using 3 reagent kit lots. The Guideline Range (95% confidence
interval) for each CVM level was established based on the Target Mean and ± 2
Standard Deviation (SD). The target values are provided in the IMMULITE® 2000
CVM Calibration verification Material lot- specific value card. The expected assay
range is 2 to 2000 pg/mL. The target values in table below can be considered as
guidelines.

Value Assignment for the IMMULITE 2000 Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PAP) CVM
was based on using PAP antigen stock traceable to an internal standard which was
gravimetrically prepared. The CVM was tested on 15 replicates (in total comprised of
5 runs, 3 replicates per run) on 4 IMMULITE 2000 systems, using 3 reagent kit lots.
The Guideline Range (95% confidence interval) for each CVM level was established
based on the Target Mean and ± 2 Standard Deviation (SD), except CVM4 needs to
be diluted with CVM1 before assaying. The expected assay range is 0.2 to 100 mg/L.
The target values in table below can be considered as guidelines.

Stability:
Shelf-Life and Open Vial Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for the
IMMULITE 2000 Calcitonin CVM were described and found to be adequate. The
real time stability study shows study results up to 5 years when stored at -20°C,
supporting the claim of 5 years shelf life and up to 9 hours at ambient or room
temperature (15-25°C) supporting the claim of 8 hours after reconstitution. The study
results were within 90% to 110% recovery.
