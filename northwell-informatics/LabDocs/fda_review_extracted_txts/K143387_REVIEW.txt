L. Test Principle:
The GE Blood Glucose Monitoring System 333 measures glucose amperometrically. The
reaction of glucose oxidase and potassium ferricyanide in the test strip with glucose in the
sample produces an electrical current which is proportional to the amount of glucose in
the sample. The meter measures the current and converts it to the corresponding glucose
concentration, which is displayed on the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed within-run precision studies using venous blood samples
diluted or spiked to five glucose concentrations (30-50, 51-110-, 111-150, 151-200,
251-400 mg/dL) across the claimed measuring range. Samples were tested using
three lots of strips and 10 meters per test strip lot. Ten replicates were tested per

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using 3 test strip lots and 15 prepared venous blood glucose
samples. Glucose concentrations of these levels measured using an established
laboratory reference method (YSI 2300 Analyzer) was as follows: 0, 15, 23, 49, 91,
135, 193, 250, 302, 361, 405, 468, 538, 575, 604 mg/dL. Each glucose level was
measured in triplicate with each of the 3 test strip lots and the values from the GE
Blood Glucose Monitoring System 333 were compared with those obtained from the
reference method. Results from regression analysis:
Test Strip Lot 1: y = 0.9928x – 0.4439; R2 = 0.9992
Test Strip Lot 2: y = 0.9886x+ 0.0378; R2 = 0.9987
Test Strip Lot 3: y = 0.9923x + 0.2624; R2 = 0.9988
y= 0.9912x - 0.0479; R2 = 0.9990 for the three lots combined
The results of the study support the sponsors claimed glucose measuring range of 20-
600 mg/dL. Data from the bench studies and software verification studies were
provided to demonstrate that if a sample is less than 20 mg/dL glucose, the result
displayed by the meter is “LO” and if the sample result exceeds 600 mg/dL glucose,
the result displayed by the meter is “HI.”
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The GE Blood Glucose Monitoring System 333 is traceable to the NIST 917b dry D-
glucose reference material.
Test Strip Stability
The GE Blood Glucose Test Strips 333 remains unchanged compared to the test strips
of the predicate device cleared under k092052. Only the brand name of the glucose
test strip has been changed from the Rightest Blood Glucose Test Strips GS550 to the
GE Blood Glucose Test Strips 333. Test strip stability was established in k092052 to
support a 12 month shelf life when stored at unopened at 39°F to 86°F (4°C to 30°C)
and open vial stability of 6 months when stored within the recommended storage
temperature range of 39°F to 86°F (4°C to 30°C) and relative humidity of 10% to
90%.
Control Solution Value Assignment and Stability
The GE Blood Glucose Monitoring System 333 is used with the Rightest Control
Solution GC550 (k092052). Stability of control solutions was established with real-
time studies in k092052. Protocols and acceptance criteria were adequate to support a
shelf-life of 24 months and open vial stability of 90 days when stored between 39°F
to 86°F (4°C to 30°C) and tightly closed after use.

--- Page 7 ---
Value assignment for use of the control solutions with the Rightest GS550 blood
glucose test strips is based on measurements using an appropriately calibrated
established laboratory reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer calibrated with YSI 2747
calibrator solutions, NIST SRM #917b Clinical Dextrose). The values for the Control
Solutions were assigned by repeat analysis using three different lots test strips and ten
meters. The mean and standard deviation are used to establish the acceptable range
for the strips. The range for each control solution is provided in the labeling.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study
e. Analytical specificity:
To assess potential interference the sponsor used three test strip lots to evaluate two
glucose concentration intervals (60-100 and 150-300 mg/dL) spiked with potentially
interfering substances at therapeutic and toxic levels. Each sample was analyzed 5
times with 5 meters to analyze the 19 substances tested. Glucose values measured
with the GE Blood Glucose Monitoring System 333 with test samples (containing
potential interfering substances) were compared with values measured from control
conditions (without potential interfering substances). Interference was calculated as
((Conc. – Conc. )/Conc. x100), and the sponsor defined significant
Test Control Control
interference as £10%. Results are presented in the table below:
Potential Interfering Substance Highest Concentration at which no significant
interference was observed (mg/dL)

Based on these results, the sponsor has the following limitations in the labeling:
High concentrations of Uric acid ≧ 10 mg/dL, Cholesterol ≧ 600 mg/dL, and
Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) ≧5 mg/dL may interfere with the glucose test causing
inaccurate test results.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To assess system accuracy of the GE Blood Glucose Monitoring System 333,
healthcare professionals tested 103 capillary blood samples from the fingertip, palm,
and forearm, ranging in glucose concentration from 21.9 - 591.0 mg/dL, using 2
meters and 3 lots of test strips. Results were compared to the same samples measured
using an established laboratory reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer). Five samples
<45mg/dL and five samples >400mg/dL were altered.

User performance study
To assess the performance of the GE Blood Glucose Monitoring System 333 in the
hands of the intended users a study was conducted at clinical centers and home-
environment simulated sites at 10 locations. The study participants were provided
with the User’s Manual in English and performed finger stick, palm and forearm tests
without additional instruction or assistance. A technician collected additional samples
from each participant for measurement on an established laboratory reference method
(YSI 2300 analyzer). Sufficient sample volume for measurement with the reference
method was obtained from 157 study participants. Three study participants failed to
obtain sufficient sample volume for forearm testing. Results from participants were
compared to results obtained with the reference method. The range of glucose values
tested was 67.4 - 480 mg/dL. Three test strip lots were used in the study. The results
are summarized below:

N. Instrument Name:
GE Blood Glucose Meter 333
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and requires a sample volume of 0.75 µL.
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes _X_______ or No ________
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
The meter automatically distinguishes control solution from blood and marks control
solution tests with a check “cs” icon and excludes them from average calculations.
The GE Blood Glucose Monitoring Meter 333 memory stores up to 500-blood glucose
test results (including control solution results) with the date and time.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip,
palm or forearm. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary
action.

5. Calibration:
There is no calibration required for the blood glucose meter by the user. The meter is
automatically coded.
6. Quality Control:
Two levels of aqueous glucose control solutions are available with this system, Level 2
and Level 4. These solutions are available for purchase separately. Recommendations on
when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for
each control level is printed on the test strip bottle label. The user is cautioned not to use
the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Sample volume Study:
The GE Blood Glucose Monitoring System 333was tested with venous blood at three
glucose concentration intervals (40-60, 80-120, and 300-330 mg/dL) and nine specimen
volumes. For each glucose interval, the specimen volumes were adjusted to 0.60, 0.65,
0.70, 0.75, 0.80, 1.00, 1.25, 2.00, and 3.00 µL. Each sample was measured in three
replicates for each of the three strips and the same sample was also measured by an
established laboratory reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer)). The bias for above
replicates in each test strip lot calculated. Results support the claimed minimum sample
volume of 0.75 µL.
2. Altitude Study:
To evaluate the effects of altitude, three test strip lots were tested with 3 meters using
three whole blood samples with glucose concentrations of 50-75, 80-120, and 270-330
mg/dL. The samples were tested at 0, 1000, 2000, and 3275 m sea level. Results
obtained were compared with those obtained with an established laboratory reference
method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The results demonstrate acceptable bias relative to the
reference method to support the claim in the labeling that altitudes up to 10,745 ft. (3275
meters) do not affect device performance.
3. Hematocrit Study:
The GE Blood Glucose Monitoring System 333was tested with venous blood at six
glucose concentration intervals (20-50, 60-80, 135-165, 180-220, 270-330, and 360-440)
and nine hematocrit levels. For each glucose concentration interval, the hematocrit levels
were adjusted to 10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 55, 60, 65, and 70%. Each sample was measured in
five replicates for each of the three test strip lots and the same sample was also measured
with an established laboratory reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer). Results from this
study support the sponsor’s claim that hematocrit in the range of 20-60% does not
interfere with glucose measurements.

4. Test System Operating Conditions:
The GE Blood Glucose Monitoring System 333 was evaluated using three meters under
three different temperatures 50-52 °F (10-11°C), 77 ±2°F (25±2 °C) and102-104 °F (39-
40 °C) at two levels of relative humidity (10±5% and 90±5%) with glucose control
solutions at 3 levels. Each sample was tested in 5 replicates. The results were compared
against an established laboratory reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer). Results support
claims in the labeling that the GE Blood Glucose Monitoring System 333 can be used in
conditions of 50 to 104°F (6 to 44°C) with relative humidity of 10 to 90%.
5. Readability Assessment:
The readability of the labeling (user’s manual, getting started guide, instructions for use
and blood glucose test strip insert) using Flesch-Kincaid analysis were found to be
written at the 8th grade level. During the lay users study the participants were asked to
complete a questionnaire to evaluate the ease of use of the device and the clarity of the
English language labeling. Overall, the users indicated they could successfully perform
the test and the user manual was clearly written.
6. Infection Control:
The device is intended for a single-patient use only. The studies were performed to
validate the virucidal efficacy of disinfectant used to clean and disinfect the two external
materials on the exterior surface of the blood glucose meter against Hepatitis B.
Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no
change in performance or external materials of the meter. The robustness studies were
designed to simulate disinfection procedures 8 times a month and approximately 520
times in a meter’s five-year lifetime.

calling 1-866-613-7085.
8. Software validation:
Software validation and verification has been reviewed and the information provided was
deemed to be adequate.
9. EMC Testing:
The sponsor provided appropriate documentation certifying that electromagnetic testing
(EMC) has been performed and the GE Blood Glucose Monitoring System 333 was
found to be compliant.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
