glucose with the reagent of the strip. The meter utilizes the current signal to calculate the
blood glucose level.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability studies (within-day precision) were performed with venous whole blood
samples at five glucose concentration ranges (30-50 mg/dL, 51-110 mg/dL, 111-150
mg/dL, 151-250 mg/dL, 251-400 mg/dL) using 3 test strip lots. Ten runs were
performed on each sample across the three test strip lots with 10 replicates per run
resulting in a total of 100 replicates collected for each glucose level. Results are

Intermediate precision (day-to-day precision) was evaluated using three glucose
control solutions. Ten strip vials, from three test strip lots, were assigned to each of
the three control levels (30-50mg/dL, 96-144 mg/dL, 280-420 mg/dL). From each
strip vial, a test was performed on each of the 3 control level solutions for 10 days.
A total of 10 replicates were collected per glucose level tested per day for a total of
100 measurements per glucose level tested across the three test strip lots. Results
are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using 3 test strip lots and 10 venous blood samples ranging in
glucose concentrations from 12 to 654 mg/dL (12, 35, 77, 113, 189, 274, 369, 453,
565, and 654 mg/dL). Three runs were performed on each sample, on each strip lot,
with replicates of 5 for each run and test strip lot resulting in a total of 15 replicates
for each test strip lot and glucose level tested. The values from the FORA GD43
meter were compared with those obtained from the reference method. The results
from regression analysis are summarized below:
Lot #1: y=1.0059 x - 0.091; R2 = 0.9983
Lot #2: y=1.0167 x - 0.5132; R2 = 0.9982
Lot #3: y=1.0106 x - 1.4375; R2 = 0.9980
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of
20 to 600 mg/dL.

Traceability: According to the sponsor, the FORA GD43 system is traceable to the
NIST SRM 917 glucose reference material. A method comparison was performed
using the candidate device and the YSI-2300 analyzer as the reference method (see
Section 2.a.)
Value Assignment for Control Solutions: Established in k093724.
Control Solution Stability: Protocols and acceptance criteria for open vial and closed
vial (shelf-life) stability for the control solutions and linearity set solutions were
previously reviewed and found to be acceptable under k093724. The sponsor claims
24 month shelf life stability and 3 month open-vial stability when stored at the
recommended storage temperatures of 39°F to 86°F (4°C to 30°C).
Test Strip Stability: The protocols and acceptance criteria for the FORA GD43 test
strips were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims closed-vial
(shelf life) and open-vial stability of 24 months when stored at 35.6-86°F (2-30°C)
and 10-90% RH.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range for the FORA GD43 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is 20 to
600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity study (M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
To assess potential interference the sponsor used venous whole blood samples
adjusted to 2 different glucose levels of 75 and 330 mg/dL, split into a control sample
and a test sample. Various endogenous and exogenous substances were then added to
the test sample only. The % difference between the test and control sample was
calculated and highest concentration tested at which no significant interference was
observed is presented in the table below:

· Exogenous substances: Dopamine, L-Dopa, methyldopa, tolazamide, ascorbic
acid (vitamin C), acetaminophen and mannose may cause inaccurate results if
concentrations of these substances is greater than therapeutic/physiologic
concentrations.
· Endogenous substance: Uric acid may cause inaccurate results if concentration of
the substance greater than therapeutic/physiologic concentration.
· Xylose: Do not test blood glucose during or soon after a xylose absorption test.
Xylose in the blood can give falsely elevated results.
· Mannitol: Up to 5000 mg/dL do not affect the results significantly, but may cause
inaccurate results at higher level.
· Lipemic Effects: Blood triglycerides up to 3000 mg/dL do not affect the results
significantly, but may affect results at higher level.
· Glutathione reduced and pralidoxime iodide: Do not test blood glucose during or
soon after a glutathione reduced or pralidoxime iodide treatment. The two
compounds within the therapeutic/physiologic concentration range (Glutathione:
47 – 100 mg/dL; Pralidoxime iodide: ~ 10 mg/dL) may affect the glucose results.

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes X or No .
The applicant has provided documentation that indicates the device was designed and
developed under good software life-cycle processes.
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip, palm,
forearm, and upper arm. There is not patient identification with this system.
5. Calibration:
Calibration is automatic. The user only needs to verify the code number displayed on the
meter matches with the code number on the test strip vial before use.
6. Quality Control:
The FORA Control Solutions are used as quality control checks to make sure that the
meter and test strips are working correctly and that the user is performing the test
correctly. The labeling provides instructions on when quality control testing should be
performed. The control ranges are printed on the test strip vial label.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1) Hematocrit study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using venous whole blood
samples with hematocrit levels of 20 - 70% (20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70%) spiked with
glucose to achieve target concentrations of 40.5, 102.5, 142.5, and 356 mg/dL with 3 lots
of test strips. A total of 30 replicates were performed for each combination of strip lot,
glucose concentration, and hematocrit level tested. The results demonstrated that the
FORA GD43 Blood Glucose Monitoring System produces accurate results over the
claimed hematocrit range of 20-70%.
2) Altitude study:
To evaluate the effects of altitude on the FORA GD43 system results, venous blood
samples from three donors were altered to 5 glucose concentrations (66, 121, 230, 375
and 560 mg/dL) and tested at various levels of atmospheric pressure and pO2 levels in a
glove box to simulate equivalent altitudes from sea level to 15,000 feet above sea level.
The meter results were compared to those obtained with the YSI-2300 analyzer. The
results demonstrate acceptable bias to the reference to support the claims in the labeling
that altitudes up to 15,000 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements
from the FORA GD43 Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
3) Temperature and humidity studies:
The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous blood samples at
target glucose concentrations of 65, 125, and 320 mg/dL to evaluate temperatures ranging
from 46-113°F (8-45°C) and relative humidity from 10-90%. Extreme combinations of
the claimed temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated and meter
results compared to a reference method. The results support the claimed range of
operating conditions: 46-113°F and 10-90% relative humidity.
4) Sample volume study:
The sponsor performed a sample volume study to support the claimed minimum sample
volume requirement for the FORA GD43 system (0.5 mL) using blood samples at three
glucose concentrations (42.5, 128, 319 mg/dL). Results support the claimed sample volume
of 0.5 mL.
5) Infection Control Studies:
The device is intended for single-patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing
laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the
chosen disinfectant, MicroKill+ Disinfectant Wipes (EPA registration #598940-10-
37549). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there
was no change in performance or external materials of the meter after 260 cleaning and
disinfection cycles (520 wipes). The robustness studies were designed to simulate 5
11

years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the
validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
6) Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing was performed and found to be adequate
for the FORA GD43 system.
7) FORA Customer Service is available from 7am to 6pm PST, Monday through Friday by
calling 1-888-307-8188.
