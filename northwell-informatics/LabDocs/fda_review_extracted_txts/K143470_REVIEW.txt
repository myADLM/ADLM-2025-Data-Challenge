3. Diazyme Fibrinogen Control Set contains two levels of serum based control. The
controls are in lyophilized form containing purified human fibrinogen antigen,
defibrinated human serum and sodium azide.
The Diazyme Fibrinogen Assay is run on Roche Modular P analyzer. The patient’s venous
blood sample is first collected by a phlebotomist and then submitted to the clinical laboratory
for determination of fibrinogen concentration using Diazyme Fibrinogen Assay. The
Diazyme Fibrinogen Modular P application parameters are programmed into the Modular P
analyzer. The reagents, calibrators and controls are loaded into the analyzer. Reagent and
sample pipettes automatically aspirate and dispense specified amounts of reagent or
calibrators, controls, and patient sample into reaction cells. The change in absorbance is
measured at specified wavelengths.
The Roche Modular P analyzer calculates the fibrinogen concentration of a patient sample by
interpolation of the obtained signal to a stored 4-point calibration curve.

L. Test Principle:
The Diazyme Fibrinogen Assay is based on an immunoturbidimetric test principle.
Fibrinogen in plasma binds to specific anti-fibrinogen antibody and forms immune
complexes. The degree of turbidity caused by immune complexes can be measured
optically (340 nm), and is proportional to the quantity of fibrinogen in the sample. The
Roche Modular P analyzer calculates the fibrinogen concentration by interpolation of the
obtained signal of a 4-point calibration curve prepared from calibrators of known
concentrations.

The results showed that the best fitting model for Diazyme Fibrinogen Assay is linear
up to 1032.8 mg/dL and the recovery mean values for each level were within 10% of
the expected values. The AMR of Diazyme Fibrinogen assay is claimed to be 100–
900 mg/dL.

Master Calibrator (reference calibrator) Preparation and Value Assignment
i. The reference calibrators were prepared by spiking fibrinogen to diluted
human serum to target concentrations. The value point of the three levels of
the calibrators is set across the reportable range. The highest calibrator is set
to close to the upper measuring range. Since the calibration curve is non-
linear, manufacturing targets for each level is designed for best curve fit.
The initial value of the fibrinogen at each level was assayed by the predicate
method, Kamiya Biomedical K-Assay Fibrinogen. The initial assigned value
of the master calibrators was finalized after verification testing with WHO
fibrinogen reference materials NIBSC code 09/242. The WHO fibrinogen
reference material was used to prepare the stock solution (1500 mg/dL) and
three diluted fibrinogen solutions (375, 500, and 750 mg/dL). After calibration
with the Diazyme Fibrinogen Calibrator Set, the reference material dilutions
were tested with the Diazyme Fibrinogen Assay in duplicate on the Modular P
analyzer. The result showed that the WHO reference material dilutions
recovered within ±10% of the target values. Therefore, Diazyme Fibrinogen
Calibrators of the Diazyme Fibrinogen Assay are traceable to WHO reference
material NIBSC code 09/242.

Production Calibrator Preparation and Value Assignment
ii. Production calibrator and value assignment is prepared from a calculated amount
of human fibrinogen stock solution is added into a diluted serum base to target
concentrations. The value point of the three levels of the calibrators is set across
the reportable range. The highest calibrator is set close to the upper measuring
range. Since the calibration curve is non-linear, manufacturing targets for each
level is designed for best curve fit. The production calibrators are value
assigned by use of master calibrator and Diazyme reagent with multiple
testing runs in three days.
The mean value of each level was used to calibrate Diazyme Fibrinogen
Assay.
Production Control Preparation and Value Assignment
Production controls are prepared by spiking fibrinogen stock solution to a diluted
human serum to the target fibrinogen concentrations. For the level 1 (normal)
control the manufacturing target is approximately 180 mg/dL. For level 2
(abnormal) control the manufacturing target is approximately 600 mg/dL. The
Diazyme Fibrinogen Assay and calibrators are used in replicate analysis to
determine the mean value of the newly prepared controls. Testing was performed
with one Modular P analyzer in two runs in duplicate for three days. The final
value is the mean of replicate values and the expected range is calculated as
±15% from the mean value for the respective controls.
Stability:
Reagent Shelf-life Stability:
Three lots of Diazyme Fibrinogen Assay reagents were used to determine shelf-life
stability. The reagents from each lot were kept in incubators at 37°C and 25°C for the
accelerated stability study and 2-8°C for the real-time stability study. At the indicated
time, the Diazyme Fibrinogen Assay reagents were removed from the incubators and
evaluated by testing six citrated human plasma samples containing fibrinogen covering
the claimed AMR after each calibration. The acceptance criterion was sample value
recovery within 10% deviation from the results at day 0.

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) of the Diazyme Fibrinogen Assay
were determined by testing on Roche Modular P analyzer with three lots of reagents and three
lots of calibrators according to CLSI EP17-A2. True blank is 7.5% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) solution in saline with 60 replicates for LoB determination. To determine LoD, five
low level positive plasma samples were diluted with 7.5% BSA in 0.9% saline to a targeted
low sample range using 12 replicates.
LoD = LoB + (1.645 × SD of LoD low sample)
The LoQ of the Diazyme Fibrinogen Assay was determined by following CLSI EP17-A2.
Five citrated plasma samples were diluted with 7.5% BSA to concentrations of 1 to 20 times
of assumed LoB. The diluted citrated plasma samples were tested with three lots of the
Diazyme Fibrinogen Assay reagents on the Roche Modular P analyzer. The results are
summarized below.
LoB, LoD and LoQ (3 lots reagents)
LoB LoD LoQ
2.15 mg/dL 5.08 mg/dL 12.9 mg/dL
e. Analytical specificity:
i. To determine the level of interference from substances present in citrated
plasma, the Diazyme Fibrinogen Assay was used to test three citrated plasma
samples, which contain low (100 mg/dL), medium (300 mg/dL), and high
(800 mg/dL) fibrinogen concentrations spiked with various concentrations of
substances according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. Each spiked sample was
tested in triplicate on the Roche Modular P analyzer using one lot of Diazyme
Fibrinogen Assay reagent and one lot of calibrator. The acceptance criterion
was the difference of mean fibrinogen concentration between the spiked
sample and the un-spiked sample < ± 10%.
The common endogenous and exogenous interfering substances and their
interference results are listed below and showed no significant interference (<
± 10%) up to the indicated concentration for all three tested citrated plasma
samples at 100 mg/dL, 300 mg/dL and 800 mg/dL, respectively. The

Due to the solubility limit of fibrinogen antigen, extremely high
concentrations of the analyte could not be stably prepared. The same linearity
set prepared above was tested again with a 1:5 sample dilution. The test
results showed that the sample containing theoretical fibrinogen concentration
of 4990 mg/dL was recovered as 1715.1 mg/dL. This value was still greater
than the upper end of the AMR of 900 mg/dL. Therefore, the Diazyme
Fibrinogen Assay demonstrated no hook effect at least at 4990 mg/dL
Fibrinogen concentration.
