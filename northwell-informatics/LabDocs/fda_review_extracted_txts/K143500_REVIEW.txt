Refer to Indications for Use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Immunalysis Amphetamine Urine Enzyme Immunoassay Kit is a homogeneous
enzyme immunoassay with dual cutoffs of 500 ng/mL and 1000 ng/mL. The assay is
intended for use in laboratories for the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of
Amphetamine in human urine with automated clinical chemistry analyzers. This assay is
calibrated against Amphetamine. This in-vitro device is for prescription use only.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as
GC-MS or permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.
The Immunalysis Amphetamine Urine Enzyme Immunoassay Kit provides only a
preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be
used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass
Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should
be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results
are used.
Immunalysis Amphetamine Urine Controls: The Immunalysis Amphetamine Urine
Controls are used as control materials in Immunalysis Amphetamine Urine Enzyme
Immunoassay.
Immunalysis Amphetamine Urine Calibrators: The Immunalysis Amphetamine Urine
Calibrators are used as calibrators in the Immunalysis Amphetamine Urine Enzyme
Immunoassay for the qualitative and semi-quantitative determination of Amphetamine in
urine on automated clinical chemistry analyzers.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
For in vitro diagnostic use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The Beckman Coulter AU400e Chemistry Analyzer was used to generate the
performance data in this submission. Instruments must be capable of maintaining a
constant reaction temperature, pipetting samples and reagents, mixing reagents, timing
reactions and measuring enzyme rates precisely.
I. Device Description:
The assay consists of antibody/substrate reagent and enzyme conjugate reagent. The
2

--- Page 3 ---
antibody/substrate reagent includes monoclonal mouse antibodies to Amphetamine, glucose-
6-phosphate (G6P) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in Tris buffer with Sodium
Azide as a preservative. The enzyme conjugate reagent contains glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH) labeled with Amphetamine in Tris buffer with Sodium Azide as a
preservative.
Calibrators and control materials are prepared by mixing a commercially available standard
solution of Amphetamine with BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin) to the desired concentrations.
The negative standard is prepared with BSA Buffer and is compared to a negative reference
standard to ensure that it is free of analyte.
The following calibrators and controls are available:

Second Edition
L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on the competition of Amphetamine labeled enzyme glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and the free drug in the urine sample for a fixed amount of
antibody binding sites. In the absence of the free drug in the sample, the antibody binds the
drug enzyme conjugate and enzyme activity is inhibited. This creates a dose response
relationship between drug concentration in the urine sample and enzyme activity. The
enzyme G6PDH activity is determined at 340 nm spectrophotometrically by the conversion
of NAD to NADH.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed precision studies in-house following the guidelines provided
in CLSI EP5-A2. The study was performed using drug free urine samples spiked with
amphetamine and analyzed on a Beckman Coulter / Olympus AU400e Chemistry
Analyzer. Samples were measured in duplicate in two runs per day for 20 days (n =
80). The data are summarized in the following table:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A drug free urine pool was spiked with a high concentration of Amphetamine at a
level above the highest calibrator and was used as the high value specimen.
Additional pools were made by serially diluting the high value specimen with drug
free urine in increments of approximately 10%. Aliquots from each pool were
analyzed in duplicate in the semi-quantitative mode. The results of the study are

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls and calibrators are traceable to a commercially available amphetamine
standard solution. The amphetamine standard is diluted with BSA (Bovine Serum
Albumin) Buffer to make the calibrator and controls to the desired concentrations.
Calibrator and control concentrations are confirmed by GC/MS or LC/MS/MS.
Stability protocols and acceptance criteria for the calibrators and controls were
reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims that when stored at 2 – 8o C
calibrators and controls are stable for one year. The sponsor claims that once opened,
the calibrators and controls are stable for 6 months when stored at 2 – 8o C.
Values are assigned to the controls and calibrators once the GC/MS or LC/MS/MS
results are within the acceptable ranges. The negative standard is prepared with BSA
Buffer. The standard is compared to a reference negative standard to ensure that it is
free of analyte. The value is assigned when the test is within the acceptable range.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Potential interference from non-structurally related compounds and endogenous
compounds was evaluated in both the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes by
following CLSI EP 7-A2: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry. Potential
interferents were spiked into drug free urine containing Amphetamine at ± 25% of the
cutoff (375 ng/mL and 625 ng/mL for the 500 ng/mL cutoff or 750 ng/mL and 1,250

Effect of pH: The sponsor evaluated the effect of pH on the test results using both
qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. Drug free urine containing Amphetamine at
± 25% of the cutoff (375 ng/mL and 625 ng/mL for the 500 ng/mL cutoff and 750
ng/mL and 1250 ng/mL for the 1000 ng/mL cutoff) were pH adjusted using
hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. pH values of 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0,
10.0 and 11.0 did not interfere with the test result at either cutoff in qualitative or
semi-quantitative mode.
Effect of specific gravity: The sponsor evaluated the effect of specific gravity on the

containing Amphetamine at ± 25% of the cutoff (375 ng/mL and 625 ng/mL for the
500 ng/mL cutoff and 750 ng/mL and 1250 ng/mL for the 1000 ng/mL cutoff) were

f. Assay cut-off:
Analytical performance of the device around the claimed cutoff is described in the
precision section M.1.a. above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison study was performed in-house using unaltered, clinical urine
samples obtained from clinical testing laboratories. A total of 80 samples were
analyzed using the 500 ng/mL cutoff, and 81 were analyzed using the 1000 ng/mL
cutoff. Each sample was run in singlicate on a Beckman Coulter AU400e Chemistry
Analyzer and the result was compared to that obtained by liquid
chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS). The results of the assay performance
compared to LC/MS are summarized below:
