2. Indication(s) for use:
The Immunalysis Opiates Urine Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous enzyme
immunoassay with a dual cutoff of 300ng/mL and 2000ng/mL. The assay is intended for
use in laboratories for the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of opiates in human
urine with automated clinical chemistry analyzers. This assay is calibrated against
Morphine. This in-vitro diagnostic device is for prescription use only.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as
GC-MS or permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.
The Immunalysis Opiates Urine Enzyme Immunoassay Kit provides only a preliminary
analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to
obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)
or Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory
method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug
of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.
The Immunalysis Opiates Urine Calibrators 300 are intended for in vitro diagnostic use
for the calibration of assays for the analytes currently listed in the package insert:
Morphine. The Immunalysis Opiates Urine Calibrators 300 consists of 4 levels, with
Level 1 containing 100ng/mL, Level 2 containing 300ng/mL, Level 3 containing
500ng/mL and Level 4 containing 1000ng/mL of morphine. The calibrators are designed
for prescription use with homogenous enzyme immunoassays on automated clinical
chemistry analyzers.
The Immunalysis Multi-Drug Controls are intended for in vitro diagnostic use to monitor
the performance of assays for the analytes currently listed in the package insert:
Benzoylecgonine, Methadone, Methamphetamine, Morphine, PCP, Secobarbital and
Oxazepam for Immunalysis Multi-Drug Controls 1 and Benzoylecgonine,
Methamphetamine and Morphine for Immunalysis Multi-Drug Controls 2. The controls
are designed for prescription use with homogenous enzyme immunoassays on automated
clinical chemistry analyzers.
The Immunalysis Opiates Urine Calibrators 2000 are intended for in vitro diagnostic use
for the calibration of assays for the analytes currently listed in the package insert:
Morphine. The Immunalysis Opiates Urine Calibrators 2000 consists of 4 levels, with
Level 1 containing 1000ng/mL, Level 2 containing 2000ng/mL, Level 3 containing
4000ng/mL and Level 4 containing 6000ng/mL of morphine. The calibrators are designed
for prescription use with homogenous enzyme immunoassays on automated clinical
chemistry analyzers.

antibody binding sites. In the absence of the free drug in the sample, the antibody binds the
drug enzyme conjugate and enzyme activity is inhibited. This creates a dose response
relationship between drug concentration in the urine sample and enzyme activity. The
enzyme G6PDH activity is determined at 340nm spectrophotometrically by the conversion of
NAD to NADH.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision/cutoff characterization study was performed by an in-house technician for
20 days, 2 runs per day in duplicate (N=80) on drug-free negative urine samples
spiked with morphine to concentrations of ±0%, ±25%, ±50%, ±75%, and ±100% of
each cutoff. The morphine concentrations in spiked samples were confirmed by mass
spectrometry.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study in the semi-quantitative mode was conducted by spiking a drug-free
urine pool with a high concentration of morphine and generating serial dilutions in
increments of 10% to achieve concentrations ranging from 100ng/mL to 1100ng/mL
for the 300 ng/mL cutoff, and 600 ng/mL to 6600 ng/mL for the 2000 ng/mL cutoff.
Each concentration was tested in triplicate and drug recovery calculated using the
mean concentration of the replicates. The results are summarized below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
Calibrators and controls are prepared from a commercially available, certified
standard solution. This standard solution is diluted with the negative calibrator matrix
to make the calibrator and control materials in the desired concentrations. The
concentrations are confirmed by GC/MS or LC/MS-MS. The negative calibrator is a
processed, drug-free urine matrix.
Value Assignment/Expected Values
A commercially available standard solution is added to the negative calibrator matrix
to make the calibrator and control materials in the desired concentrations.
Concentrations are confirmed by GC/MS or LC/MS-MS. If any of the analytes are
below the acceptable range, the calibrator or control is adjusted and re-tested. Values
are assigned once the GC/MS or LC/MS-MS results are within the acceptable range.
The negative calibrator is compared to a reference negative standard to ensure that it
is free of analyte. Value is assigned when the test is within the acceptable range.

Stability
A closed-vial accelerated stability study and an onboard, open vial stability study
were conducted on one lot each of calibrators, and controls. Real-time stability
studies are ongoing. All stability protocols were reviewed and found acceptable.
These studies support the one year stability claim for closed vials and 28 days
stability claim for open vials of calibrators, and controls when stored at 2-8°C.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
An analytical specificity study to evaluate possible interference from non-structurally
and structurally related compounds was performed in the qualitative and semi-
quantitative mode for each cutoff concentration.
Structurally related compounds
To evaluate potential cross-reactants for the Immunalysis Opiates Urine Enzyme
Immunoassay kit, morphine and other opiates were spiked into drug free urine at
concentrations that will yield a result that is equivalent to the 300ng/mL or
2000ng/mL Opiates cutoff. The results were the same for the qualitative and semi-
quantitative modes.

Compounds that showed interference were further evaluated by spiking them into drug
free urine containing morphine at ±50% of the cutoff. Riboflavin at 0.0075 g/dL caused a
false negative response for morphine at ±25% but not at ±50% of the 300 ng/mL cutoff.
Boric Acid at 1% w/v caused a false negative response for morphine at ±25% and ±50%
of the 300 ng/mL cutoff, and caused a false negative response for morphine at ±25% but
not at ±50% of the 2000 ng/mL cutoff. The results were the same for the qualitative and
semi-quantitative modes.
The following statement is provided in the limitations section of the labeling: “Boric
Acid is not recommended as a preservative for urine. Boric Acid and Riboflavin can
cause a falsely low test result.”
pH and Specific Gravity
For potential interference from the pH of urine, device performance in the qualitative and
semi-quantitative modes was tested using a range of urine pH values (3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0,
7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0 and 11.0). All test samples were prepared in drug free urine containing
morphine at ± 25 of the 300ng/mL cutoff (225ng/mL and 375ng/mL) and 2000ng/mL
cutoff (1500ng/mL and 2500ng/mL). No positive or negative interference was observed
at urine pH values ranging from 3.0 to 11.0 for each test mode.
For potential interference from the specific gravity of urine, device performance in the
qualitative and semi-quantitative modes was tested using a range of urine specific gravity
values (1.000, 1.002, 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025 and 1.030). All test samples were
prepared in drug free urine containing morphine at ± 25% of the 300ng/mL cutoff
(225ng/mL and 375ng/mL) and 2000ng/mL cutoff (1500ng/mL and 2500ng/mL). No
positive or negative interference was observed at urine specific gravity values ranging
