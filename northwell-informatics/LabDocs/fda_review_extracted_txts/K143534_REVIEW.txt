H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Elecsys CA 125 II assay:
Elecsys CA 125 II is an immunoassay for the in vitro quantitative determination of OC
125 reactive determinants in human serum, Li-heparin, K2-EDTA and K3-EDTA
plasma, as well as Li-heparin plasma tubes containing separating gel on the cobas e 411
analyzer.
These determinants are associated with a high molecular weight glycoprotein in serum
and plasma of women with primary epithelial invasive ovarian cancer (excluding those
with cancer of low malignant potential).
This immunoassay is indicated for use as an aid in the detection of residual or recurrent
ovarian carcinoma. This immunoassay is further indicated for use in monitoring patients
for disease progress or response to therapy.
The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on the cobas e
411 immunoassay analyzers.
Elecsys CA 125 II CalCheck:
For use in the verification of the calibration established by the Elecsys CA 125 II reagent
on the Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use on the cobas e 411 analyzer
I. Device Description:
The Elecsys CA 125 II Assay is a kit intended for use in the measurement of OC 125 reactive
determinants in human serum or plasma. The assay employs a sandwich immunoassay

format using biotinylated M11 monoclonal antibody as a capture reagent and ruthenium-
labeled OC125 monoclonal antibody as a detection reagent. Streptavidin-coated
microparticles are used for capture of antibody-antigen complexes and detection is by
electrochemiluminescence.
Elecsys CA 125 II CalCheck calibration verification solutions comprise three levels—low,
mid and high—each with a defined CA 125 concentration. The low solution concentration is
near the lower detection limit of the assay. The mid solution is in the middle or at a clinically
critical point of the measuring range. The high solution is near the upper limit of the
measuring range.

L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys CA 125 II assay is a two-step sandwich immunoassay. First, sample is
incubated with a biotinylated monoclonal CA 125-specific antibody and a monoclonal CA
125-specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium to form a sandwich complex. After addition
of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex bounds to the solid phase via interaction
of biotin and streptavidin. The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where
the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound
substances are then removed. A voltage is applied to the electrode to induce
chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier. The results are
determined via a calibration curve that is instrument-specifically generated by 2-point
calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Total Imprecision: Six human sera were measured with two replicates and two runs
per day for 20 days (n = 80). The human sera were pooled patient and single donor
spiked samples. Samples were measured using one lot of reagent, on one instrument
(cobas e 411), at two different sites as indicated in the table below. Analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was used to calculate repeatability and reproducibility according
to CLSI EP05-A3. All data met the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria for % CV and
95% confidence intervals for % CV.

Linearity: The studies followed CLSI EP06-A, where 15 dilutions were prepared by
diluting three human serum samples and three human plasma samples spiked with CA
125 down across the lower end of the measuring range. Each dilution was measured
in three replicates on cobas e411. Results are summarized in the following table:

The data support linearity from 2.0–3000 U/mL. Values below the LoD are reported
as <2.0 U/mL and values above the measuring range as >3000 U/mL.
Automatic dilution versus manual dilution: Three human serum samples were spiked
with CA 125 to concentrations above the analytical measuring range. These samples
were diluted 1:5 manually or automatically on the cobas e 411analyzer using Diluent
Universal. Each sample was measured in triplicate with one lot on one analyzer and
the median value was used to compare percent recovery of the manual dilution to that
of the automated dilution. The manufacturer’s acceptance criteria of percent recovery
90–110% were met.
High dose hook effect: Hook effect was measured using two human serum samples
spiked with CA 125 to 50000 U/mL. Each sample was then diluted with Diluent

Universal to a level below the upper limit of the analytical measuring range and
measured with a single replicate using one lot of reagent and one analyzer (cobas e
411). The data demonstrated the assay is not susceptible to antigen excess up to a
concentration of 50000 U/mL.
c. Traceability and Stability:
i. Traceability:
There are no reference standards for CA 125. The results are reported in U/mL
and the method has been standardized against the Enzymun-Test CA 125 II
method. This in turn has been standardized against the CA 125 II RIA from
Fujirebio Diagnostics.
ii. Kit Stability:
Shelf-Life Stability: A real-time stability study set the shelf-life stability of the
Elecsys CA 125 II assay at 18 months when stored at 2–8°C.
Open-Vial Stability: The assay reagents can be stored opened at 2–8°C for up to
12 weeks.
On-Board Stability: The assay reagents can be stored on-board the cobas e 411
analyzer at 20±3°C for up to 6 weeks.
iii. Sample Stability:
Ten human samples for each sample type (serum, K -EDTA-plasma, K -EDTA-
2 3
plasma, Li-heparin-plasma) that covered the analytical measuring range were
tested under four different conditions: 2-8°C, 15-25°C, -20°C, and after multiple
freeze/thaw cycles. Each sample was measured with three replicates and percent
recovery was compared to the sample stored at -80°C. Samples were determined
to be stable for up to 5 days at 2–8°C, up to 8 hours at 15–25°C, up to 24 weeks
at-20°C or following 2 freeze/thaw cycles.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined according
to CLSI EP17-A2. To estimate LoB, five measurand-free human serum samples were
measured in six runs on two instruments with three different reagent lots (n = 60
replicates per reagent lot). LoB was calculated as the highest 95th percentile value
from the three reagent lots. The LoB was determined to be 0.6 U/mL. To determine
LoD, five human serum samples with low analyte values were measured in six runs
on two instruments with three different reagent lots (n = 60 replicates per reagent lot).
LoD was calculated from the following equation: LoD = LoB + 1.653 x (total
standard deviation). The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined using six
9

--- Page 10 ---
pooled human serum samples that were diluted to have CA 125 concentrations
between 1.0-6.3 U/mL. Each sample was measured in six runs, on two instruments,
with three different reagent lots (n = 72 replicates per reagent lot). The detection
limit values are presented in the table below:
LoB LoD LoQ
0.6 U/mL 1.2 U/mL 2.0 U/mL
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Endogenous Interference:
Interferences were assessed by testing two human serum samples with CA 125
concentrations of 35 and 2260 U/mL. Each sample was split in half, and a high
concentration of each potentially interfering endogenous substance was spiked
into one half. The spiked sample was then mixed with the non-spiked half to
create a series of eleven samples containing different concentrations of the
potential interferent and tested in. a single replicate. The manufacturer’s
acceptance criteria for non-interference were met and the assay was not affected
by the following substances at the indicated concentrations:

Bilirubin 75 mg/dL
Rheumatic Factor 1500 IU/mL
Hemoglobin 3200 mg/dL
HAMA 805 µg/mL
ii. Exogenous Interference:
A total of 16 common drugs and 23 cancer drugs were tested for interference
using two spiked human serum samples with CA 125 concentrations of 11 and
313 U/mL. Each sample was spiked with a high concentration of interferent and
measured with three replicates in one run using one reagent lot on one analyzer
(cobas e 411). The manufacturer’s acceptance criteria for non-interference were
met and the assay was not affected by the following drugs at the indicated
concentrations:

the assay was evaluated in 199 subjects with various cancers (bladder cancer, breast
cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, endometrial cancer, lung cancer) and in 411 women with
benign conditions. A total of 80 women with conditions other than cancers (hypertension
and pregnancy) were also included. A total of 690 specimens were analyzed. The mean,
