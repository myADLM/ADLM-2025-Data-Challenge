510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
K143577
B. Purpose for Submission:
Clearance of a new device
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Sysmex America Inc., Sysmex XW-100 and XW QC CHECK
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Complete blood count (WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, PLT, MPV),
leukocyte 3-part differential (LYM%, other WBC%, NEUT%, LYM#, other WBC#,
NEUT#), RDW-SD and RDW-CV.
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The XW-100 Automated Hematology Analyzer, hereafter referred to as Sysmex XW-
100, is an electrical resistance blood cell counter. The Sysmex XW-100 analyzes human
whole blood specimens anticoagulated with dipotassium and tripotassium
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K EDTA and K EDTA) and reports results for the
2 3
following 17 parameters: white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin
(HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular
hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), platelet
(PLT), percent lymphocytes (LYM%), percent other WBC (WBC%), percent neutrophils
(NEUT%), absolute lymphocytes (LYM#), absolute other WBC (WBC#), absolute
neutrophils (NEUT#), red cell distribution width standard deviation (RDW-SD), red cell
distribution width coefficient of variation (RDW-CV), and mean platelet volume (MPV).
2. Principles of Operation:
The patient sample is aspirated, measured, diluted with diluent (and lysed for WBC and
hemoglobin measurement), then directed into a transducer chamber by a hydrodynamic
focusing nozzle. The transducer chamber has a minute hole, or aperture. Electrodes are
mounted on both sides of the aperture chamber, through which the direct current flows.
Blood cells suspended in the diluted sample are injected through the aperture by the
hydrodynamic focusing nozzle. The hydrodynamic focusing nozzle is positioned in front
of the aperture and in line with the aperture’s center. This method improves cell counting
accuracy because all blood cells are separated from each other and pass through the
1

--- Page 2 ---
aperture in one direction, one cell at a time. When a cell passes through the aperture, it
causes a change in the direct current resistance, which is proportional to the cell’s size.
The resistance changes are captured as electric pulses. The various blood cell counts are
calculated by counting the electric pulses that occur in each cell size category. The
analyzer then determines blood cell volume and identifies rare and pathological cells by
creating and analyzing histograms of the various cell populations using their respective
pulse heights. Hemoglobin is measured photometrically by a non-cyanide method.

b. Flagging Comparison
A flagging comparison study was performed across three point-of-care clinical sites to
evaluate flagging agreement between the candidate and comparative methods, the
Sysmex XW-100 and Sysmex pocH-100i respectively. The Sysmex XW-100 flagging
system includes flagging limits (+/-) and particle distribution analysis (PDA) for all
claimed parameters as described in the instructions for use (IFU). A two-sided 95%
confidence interval (CI) for each agreement estimate was calculated using the Bayesian
method provided below.

Positive Percent Agreement = 100 × a/(a+c) = 100 × 257/(257+7) = 97.3%
95% CI: 94.6% to 98.6%
Negative Percent Agreement = 100 × d/(d+b) = 100 × 117/(117+10) = 92.1%
95% CI: 86.1% to 95.6%
Overall Agreement = 100 × (a+d)/n =100 × (257+117)/(391)= 95.6%
95% CI: 93.1% to 97.2%
c. Precision/Reproducibility
Precision performance of the Sysmex XW-100 was evaluated by performing
repeatability and reproducibility studies across three point-of-care (POC) clinical sites
with the intended POC operators.
The repeatability study was conducted for the WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT and PLT
parameters with residual whole blood samples collected in K EDTA collection

containers. The samples were selected to span the medical decision levels, the lower
and upper limits of the analytical measuring range. Each sample was analyzed 10
consecutive times. SD (standard deviation) and CV% (coefficient of variation) were
calculated and provided for each measurand at each site. The predefined acceptance
criteria were met.
Reproducibility performance was conducted at each site over 20 operating days
utilizing three levels of commercial control material (XW QC CHECK – low, normal

d. Carryover
Carryover of the Sysmex XW-100 was evaluated by assaying whole blood K EDTA
2
samples with high WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT counts. Three high concentration (H1,
H2, and H3) samples were consecutively analyzed followed by three low concentration
(L1, L2, L3) samples. Three sets of carryover sequences were run for each type of
carryover test on three separate instruments.
Carryover % was determined using the following calculation: % Carryover =
(LTV1−LTV3)/(HTV3−LTV3) × 100. The results of the carryover study were within
the predefined specifications.
e. Interfering Substances
A verification study was conducted to determine the interference level with the
hematology results generated by the Sysmex XW-100 for the following interfering
substances: Bilirubin F, Bilirubin C, hemolytic hemoglobin, chyle, and lipids
(Intralipid). Six whole blood K EDTA tubes were collected from each of the three
2
study subjects. A total of 3 samples were contrived with the specified interferent at
various dilutions, mixed, and then analyzed three times.
There was no significant Bilirubin F interference up to a concentration of 37.1 mg/dL
for the WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT parameters. There was no significant bilirubin F
interference for HCT up to a concentration of 29.6 mg/dL.
There was no significant Bilirubin C interference up to a concentration of 38.1 mg/dL
for the WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, and PLT parameters.
There was no significant hemolysis interference up to a concentration of 936 mg/dL for
the WBC, RBC, HCT, and PLT parameters. There was no significant hemolysis
interference up to a concentration of 749 mg/dL for the HGB parameter.
There was no significant Intralipid interference up to a concentration of 55.980 OD for
the WBC, RBC, and HCT parameters. There was no significant Intralipid interference
up to a concentration of 1.119 OD for the HGB parameter and up to a concentration of
11.196 OD for the PLT parameter.
There was no significant chyle interference up to a concentration of 2579 FTU for the
WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, and PLT parameters.
f. Quality Control Stability
The XW QC CHECK 30-day open-vial stability claim was substantiated by performing
three runs over eight time points spanning the 30-day claim utilizing two vials from
each of the three QC lots, one operator, and two Sysmex XW-100 analyzers at one
internal site.

--- Page 11 ---
The 45-day closed-vial stability claim was substantiated by performing three runs over
ten time points spanning the 45-day end date claim utilizing two vials from each of the
three QC lots, one operator, and two Sysmex XW-100 analyzers at one internal site.
The control vials used in the open and closed-vial stability studies were stored and used
in accordance with the instructions for use at room temperature (59–86°F or 15–30°C).
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Sample Stability
Whole blood stability was evaluated using a total of 20 (10 normal and 10 abnormal)
K₂EDTA whole blood samples on the Sysmex XW-100. The samples were run in
triplicate to obtain the baseline on time zero. Single measurements of each sample
were subsequently obtained at 8 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, and 48 hours at
room temperature (18‒26°C) and refrigerated temperature (2‒8°C). The mean percent
difference was calculated for each sample and was within the predefined acceptance
criteria. Whole blood samples stored at room temperature (59–77° F or 15–25°C ) are
stable for up to 8 hours and samples stored refrigerated (36‒46°F or 2–8° C) are stable
for up to 36 hours.
b. Anticoagulant Comparison (K EDTA vs. K EDTA)
2 3
Anticoagulant comparison studies were performed to demonstrate comparability
between K EDTA and K EDTA whole blood samples for all reportable parameters. A
2 3
total of 10 paired whole blood samples (K₂EDTA, K₃EDTA) were collected from study
subjects. The samples were run in duplicate on the Sysmex XW-100 and the results of
the K EDTA samples were compared to the corresponding results of the K EDTA
2 3
sample from the same study subject. The results of the study met the predefined bias
limits for all reportable parameters.

c. Determination of limit of blank, lower limits of detection and quantitation
Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by performing 60 repeat measurements using
two blank samples containing XW-Pack D (system diluent). The mean, SD, and LoB
were calculated for the WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, and PLT parameters.
Parameter Mean SD LoB
WBC 0.0 x 103/µL 0.0 x 103/µL 0.0 x 103/µL
RBC 0.0 x 106/µL 0.0 x 106/µL 0.0 x 106/µL
HGB 0.0 g/dL 0.0 g/dL 0.0 g/dL
HCT 0.0% 0.0% 0.0%
PLT 0.0 x 103/µL 0.0 x 103/µL 0.0 x 103/µL
To determine the Limit of Detection (LoD), a total of 60 replicate measurements of
three low level samples with target values of 0.3–0.5 x 103/µL for WBC, 0.02–0.04 x
106/µL for RBC, 0.1–0.4 g/dL for HGB, 0.1–0.3% for HCT, and 10–14 x 103/µL for
PLT were performed in the whole blood analysis mode.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined by using the test results from the LoD
study to determine the bias and imprecision for that level of analyte. A total of 45
replicate measurements from three samples (15 measurements per sample) at the lowest
concentration for each analyte were performed to verify precision at the low end of the
analytical measuring range. The mean, SD, and 2SD were calculated for the WBC,
RBC, HGB, HCT, and PLT parameters.
The results of the LoD and LoQ for the Sysmex XW-100™ met the expected lower
measuring range for WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, and PLT.
