The Chemtrue® Drug Screen Cup Tests panel can consist of any combination of the
above listed drug analytes.
The tests are intended for prescription and Over-The-Counter (OTC) use.
The tests provide only a preliminary result. A more specific alternative chemical method
must be used in order to obtain a confirmed assay result. Gas Chromatography I Mass
Spectrometry (GCIMS) or Liquid Chromatography I Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) are the
preferred confirmatory methods. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should
be applied to any drugs of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results
are indicated.

L. Test Principle:
The Chemtrue® Drug Screen Cup Tests are rapid lateral flow immunoassays in which drug-
protein conjugates in the test device compete with drugs or drug metabolites that may be
present in urine. On each test strip, a drug-protein conjugate is added to the test band of the
membrane – known as the test region (T), and the anti-drug antibody-colloidal gold
conjugate pads are placed at the forward end of the membrane. Monoclonal anti-drug
antibodies derived from mice are used on the BUP, AMP, COC, MET, MOR, OPI2000, PCP,
THC, BAR, MDMA, MTD, and OXY tests. Monoclonal anti-drug antibodies derived from

sheep and mice are used on the TCA and BZO tests. If target drugs are present in the urine
specimen below its cut-off concentration, the solution of the colored antibody-colloidal gold
conjugates moves along with the sample solution by capillary action across the membrane to
the immobilized drug-protein conjugate zone on the test band region. The colored antibody-
gold conjugates then complexes with the drug-protein conjugates to form visible lines.
Therefore, the formation of the visible precipitant in the test band indicates a negative result.
If the target drug level exceeds its cut-off concentration, the drug/metabolite antigen
competes with drug protein conjugates on the test band region for the limited antibody on the
colored drug antibody-colloidal gold conjugate pad. The drug will saturate the limited
antibody binding sites and the colored antibody-colloidal gold conjugate cannot bind to the
drug-protein conjugate at the test region of the test strip. Therefore, absence of the color band
on the test region indicates a preliminary positive result. A band should form in the control
region (C) of the devices regardless of the presence of drug in the sample to indicate that the
test has been performed properly.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Performance characteristics for Buprenorphine (BUP) and Tricyclic Antidepressants
(TCA) test strips in cup format were established in k142396, unless otherwise noted. The
same BUP and TCA test strips from k142396 are used in the candidate devices.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision performance of the test strips of the devices was evaluated using 3 lots
and 3 operators. Drug-free (negative) urine samples were analyzed and also spiked to
concentrations of -50% of cutoff, -25% of cutoff, cutoff, cutoff + 25% and cutoff +
50%. Each drug concentration was confirmed by GC/MS. Each lot was evaluated by
a different operator and results were collected over ten non-consecutive days. Results
are summarized below.

described and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims that the devices are
stable for two years (24 months) when stored at 2–30º C.
Quality control: Control materials are not supplied with the devices; however the
labeling provides information on how to obtain quality control materials.
d. Detection limit:
See Precision/Reproducibility section in M.1.a above.
e. Analytical specificity:
For each drug, specificity was evaluated by spiking various concentrations of
similarly structured drug compounds into drug-free urine. Results are expressed as a
minimum concentration of metabolite or compound required to produce a response
approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay. The percent cross-
reactivity of those compounds is listed below with the calibrator analyte(s) in bold:

The sponsor also evaluated the potential for positive and negative interference from
non-structurally related compounds, endogenous compounds, pH, and specific
gravity. The structurally unrelated compounds and endogenous substances study was
performed by spiking structurally unrelated compounds and endogenous substances at
a concentration of 100 μg/mL into urine samples containing drug at ± 25% of the
respective drug cutoff concentrations. The following structurally unrelated
substances showed no positive or negative interference in this study:

To evaluate the effect of pH value on the test results, urine controls at ± 50% of the
cutoff value were used. Each control level was adjusted by either 1N NaOH solution
or 1N HCl to pH levels of 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0 and 9.0.
Each test sample was tested in duplicate.
To evaluate the effect of specific gravity, urine controls at ± 50% of the cutoff values
were spiked with deionized water or sugar to obtain specific gravities of 1.001, 1.010,
1.015, 1.020, 1.025, and 1.030. Each test sample was tested in duplicate.
The results demonstrated that pH and specific gravity do not affect the results from
the device.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration appears in the precision section, M.1.a., above.
2. Comparison studies:
The sponsor performed a method comparison study comparing performance of the test
strips of the cup devices to the GC/MS reference method. For each drug test, at least 40
unaltered positive clinical samples and 40 unaltered negative clinical samples with
known GC/MS values were tested. Results are summarized below:

Not applicable. This device is for use with urine samples only.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
A consumer study was performed for all analytes, including BUP and TCA, to
evaluate the ability of untrained users to interpret the devices properly when given
only the labeling (package insert) provided with the devices. One hundred (100)
intended lay-users participated in this study from three (3) intended user sites with
GC/MS confirmed urine samples at the following concentrations: negative, 50%,
75%, 125% and 150% of the cutoff. Samples were created by spiking drugs into drug-
free urine pool. Each sample was aliquotted into an individual blind-labeled
container. Each lay-user was provided with a package insert in English only and one
blind-labeled sample for testing.

Consumers were also given surveys on the ease of understanding the package insert
instructions and ≥ 98% of the lay users indicated that the device instructions can be
easily followed. A Flesch-Kincaid reading analysis was performed on the package
inserts and the score revealed a reading grade level of less than 7.
