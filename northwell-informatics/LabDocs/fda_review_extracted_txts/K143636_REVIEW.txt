The package insert has the following warning:
CAUTION POTENTIAL BIOHAZARD
Contains human source material. Each donation of human blood or blood component was
tested by FDA-approved methods for the presence of antibodies to human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2) as well as for hepatitis B
surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to hepatitis C virus (HCV). The test results
were negative (not repeatedly reactive.). No test offers complete assurance that these or
other infectious agents are absent; this material should be handled using good laboratory
practices and universal precautions.

Traceability:
The IMMULITE Androstenedione CVMs are 4 level materials which are a subset of
7 level Androstenedione calibrators. Calibrators are not commercialized but are used
internally during manufacture and release testing of Androstenedione reagents and
two point adjustors. The assigned reference calibrators are prepared using
Androstenedione antigen stock and are traceable to an internal material which has
been gravimetrically prepared.
The IMMULITE Troponin I CVMs are 4 level materials which are a subset of 10
level Troponin I calibrators. Calibrators are not commercialized but are used
internally during manufacture and release testing of Troponin I reagents and two
point adjustors. The assigned reference calibrators are prepared using Troponin I

antigen stock and are traceable to an internal standard which have been
gravimetrically prepared.
Value Assignments:
Androstenedione: The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by
assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the
recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are
then averaged across all systems. Quality control is performed by calculating the
recovery of patient samples and controls using the assigned CVM values. The
CVMs were tested on 27 replicates in total comprised of 9 runs, 3 replicates per run,
8 IMMULITE 2000 systems, and 3 different reagent kit lots.
Troponin I: The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by
assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the
recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are
then averaged across all systems. Quality control is performed by calculating the
recovery of normal patient samples, spiked samples and controls using the assigned
CVM values. The assay controls must fall within their target ranges. The CVMs
were tested on 15 replicates in total comprised of 5 runs, 3 replicates per run, on 4
IMMULITE 2000 systems and 2 different reagent kit lots.
Expected Values/Target Values/Reference Range:
Androstenedione: The Guideline Range (95% confidence interval) for each CVM
level was established based on the Target Mean and ± 2 Standard Deviation (SD). The
target values are provided in the IMMULITE® 2000 CVM Calibration verification
Material lot-specific value card.

Stability:
Androstenedione Stability Summary:
A stability study was performed to validate the real-time shelf life and open vial
stability claims for the IMMULITE 2000 Androstenedione Calibration Verification
Material (CVM). The stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed
and were found to be adequate to support the sponsor’s following stability claims:
The Calibration Verification Materials are stable up to 3 years when stored at -20°C
prior to opening. Open vial stability studies support 8 hours of stability at room
temperature (15-25°C).
Troponin I Stability Summary:
A stability study was performed to validate the real-time shelf life and open vial
stability claims for the IMMULITE 2000 Troponin I Calibration Verification Material
(CVM). The stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and were
found to be adequate to support the sponsor’s following stability claims: The
Calibration Verification Materials are stable up to 10 months when stored at -20°C
prior to opening, and for 2 hours at room temperature (15-25°C) after reconstitution.
