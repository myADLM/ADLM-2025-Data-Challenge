1. Intended use(s):
The BD MAX™ Enteric Parasite Panel performed on the BD MAX™ System is an
automated in vitro diagnostic test for the direct qualitative detection of enteric parasitic
pathogens. The BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel detects nucleic acids from:
• Giardia lamblia
• Cryptosporidium (C. hominis and C. parvum only)
• Entamoeba histolytica
Testing is performed on unpreserved or 10% formalin-fixed stool specimens from
symptomatic patients with suspected gastroenteritis, enteritis or colitis. The assay is
intended to aid in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal infection when used in conjunction
with clinical evaluation and other laboratory findings. The test is performed directly on
the specimen, utilizing real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the amplification
of specific targets. The test utilizes fluorogenic gene-specific hybridization probes for
detection of the amplified DNA.
This test is intended for use, in conjunction with clinical presentation, laboratory
findings, and epidemiological information, as an aid in the differential diagnosis of
Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium hominis and C. parvum, as well as Entamoeba
histolytica infections. Results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for
diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decision. Positive results do not rule
out co-infection with other organisms that are not detected by this test, and may not be
the sole or definitive cause of patient illness. Negative results in the setting of clinical
illness compatible with gastroenteritis and/or colitis may be due to infection by pathogens
that are not detected by this test or non-infectious causes such as ulcerative colitis,
irritable bowel syndrome, or Crohn’s disease.

L. Test Principle:
Stool specimens are collected from patients and transported to the laboratory in a clean
container, unpreserved or 10% formalin-fixed. The specimen is vortexed and a 10 μL loop is
inserted to the depth of the loop into the specimen, and expressed using a swirling motion
into a BD MAX Sample Buffer Tube. The Sample Buffer Tube is closed with a septum cap
and then heated on the BD Pre-warm Heater to facilitate lysis of the parasite organisms. The
Sample Buffer Tube is then vortexed and transferred to the BD MAX System. Once the work
list is generated and the sample is loaded on the BD MAX instrument with a BD MAX
Enteric Parasite Panel Unitized Reagent Strip and PCR Cartridge, the run is started and no
further operator intervention is required. The BD MAX System automates sample
preparation, including target organism lysis, DNA extraction and concentration, reagent
rehydration, target nucleic acid sequence amplification and detection using real-time PCR.
The interpretation of the signal is performed automatically by the BD MAX System. The
assay also includes a Sample Processing Control that is provided in the Extraction Tube and
subjected to extraction, concentration and amplification steps. The Sample Processing
Control is incorporated into the lysis, extraction, concentration and amplification steps to
monitor for the presence of potential inhibitory substances as well as system or reagent
failures.
Following enzymatic cell lysis at an elevated temperature, the released nucleic acids are
captured on magnetic affinity beads. The beads, with the bound nucleic acids, are washed
and the nucleic acids are eluted by heat and high pH in Elution Buffer. Eluted DNA is
neutralized and transferred to the Master Mix Tube to rehydrate the PCR reagents. After
rehydration, the BD MAX System dispenses a fixed volume of PCR-ready solution into the
BD MAX PCR Cartridge. Microvalves in the BD MAX PCR Cartridge are sealed by the
system prior to initiating PCR to contain the amplification mixture thus preventing
evaporation and contamination.
The amplified DNA targets are detected using hydrolysis (TaqMan®) probes, labeled at one
end with a fluorescent reporter dye (fluorophore) and at the other end with a quencher
moiety. Probes labeled with different fluorophores are used to detect amplicons for enteric
parasite targets and the Sample Processing Control in four different optical channels of the
BD MAX System: Giardia lamblia target amplicons are detected in the FAM channel,
Cryptosporidium parvum/hominis target amplicons are detected in the ROX channel,
Entamoeba histolytica target amplicons are detected in the VIC channel and Sample
Processing Control amplicons are detected in the Cy5.5 channel. When the probes are in their
native state, the fluorescence of the fluorophore is quenched due to its proximity to the
quencher. However, in the presence of target DNA, the probes hybridize to their
complementary sequences and are hydrolyzed by the 5’-3’ exonuclease activity of the DNA
polymerase as it synthesizes the nascent strand along the DNA template. As a result, the
fluorophores are separated from the quencher molecules and fluorescence is emitted. The BD
MAX System monitors these signals at each cycle and interprets the data at the end of the
program to report the final results.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Site-to-site reproducibility
Site-to-site reproducibility was evaluated for the BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel at
three clinical sites by two operators at each site for eight days. Each panel member
was tested in triplicate for each run resulting in a total of 144 data points per panel
member. The panel members were prepared as organism mixes of G. lamblia cysts,
C. parvum oocysts, and E. histolytica trophozoites spiked at varying concentrations
per target in negative unpreserved stool matrix:
Moderate Positive (MP): 2 to 5x LOD
Low Positive (LP): 0.6 to 1.2x LOD
High Negative (HN): 0.1 to 0.5x LOD
True Negative (TN): No Target
Three replicates of each positive mix and true negative sample were included in each
run. Panel members were prepared by spiking SBTs with organism mixes. Testing
panels were shipped to testing sites and prior to testing, the user expressed a 10μl
loop of pooled stool matrix (previously determined to be negative for all analytes by
the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel) into each sample.
Site-to-site reproducibility results are presented as percent agreement with expected
result (%), (ratio of count with expected result/total count), and [95% confidence
interval] in Table 1.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Positive and Negative External Controls:
External control materials are not provided by BD; however, Quality Control strains
and procedures are recommended in the package insert. External positive controls are
intended to monitor for substantial reagent failure, and External negative controls are
used to detect reagent or environmental contamination (or carry-over) by target
nucleic acids. External positive and negative controls are not used by the BD MAX
System software for the purpose of sample test result interpretation. External controls
are treated as patient samples. Various types of external controls are recommended to
allow the user to select the most appropriate for their laboratory quality control
program. Due to lack of commercial availability of organism oocysts/cysts for all
targets and burdensome culture methods for the trophozoite form of the target
organisms, BD recommends genomic DNA preparations according to the listing
below:
Commercially available external positive control materials
- Giardia intestinalis (Lambl) (ATCC 3088D) (2,475 pg/mL gDNA)
- Cryptosporidium parvum (ATCC PRA-67D) (11,025 pg/mL gDNA)
- Entamoeba histolytica (ATCC 30459D) (150 pg/mL gDNA)
Recommended external negative control
- A non-inoculated BD MAX™ Enteric Parasite Panel SBT
During the clinical study, the above mentioned external positive and negative controls
were included in each run. A failed control invalidated the entire run. In the case of a
failed control, the testing was repeated for all samples in the run from the
appropriately stored SBTs, along with a new set of controls. A total of 253 external
positive controls and 253 external negative controls were tested resulting in valid
expected results for 242 (95.6%) and 240 (94.9%) of positive controls and negative
controls, respectively. Three runs were invalidated due to Incomplete results (1.2%),
and one run was invalidated due to an Indeterminate result (7.4%). Positive control
testing resulted in five valid but incorrect results (2.0%) and two Unresolved results
(0.8%). Negative control testing resulted in three Unresolved results (1.2%).
Internal Sample Processing Control:
Each BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Extraction Tube contains a Sample Processing
Control (SPC) which is a plasmid containing a synthetic target DNA sequence. The
SPC monitors the efficiency of DNA capture, washing and elution during the sample
processing steps, as well as the efficiency of DNA amplification and detection during
PCR analysis. If the SPC result fails to meet the acceptance criteria, the test result of
will be reported as Unresolved (UNR). An Unresolved result is indicative of sample-
associated inhibition or reagent failure. The user is instructed to repeat any sample
12

--- Page 13 ---
reported as Unresolved.
Sample Processing Control Effectiveness Study
A Sample Processing control effectiveness study was performed to evaluate the
effectiveness of the SPC to monitor for substantial reagent or process failure. This
study was designed to test for failure in the extraction process, failure in PCR
amplification and/or failure due to the presence of PCR inhibitors.
Twenty-four replicates were tested for each of the following conditions:
- Failure in PCR amplification was tested by replacing the BD MAX Enteric
Bacterial Panel Master Mix tube with an empty Snap Tube (expected result =
IND).
- Failure in the Extraction process was tested by replacing the BD MAX Enteric
Bacterial Panel Extraction tube with an empty Snap Tube (expected result =
UNR).
- Failure due to the presence of PCR inhibitors was tested by placing 100 mM
EDTA solution into an empty Snap Tube of the BD MAX System test rack prior
to beginning a run (expected result = UNR).
- Valid SPC control (expected result = positive SPC)
Each test condition produced the expected SPC detection or failures for all replicates.
Specimen Stability Study:
Stability studies were performed to demonstrate that target DNA is stable in both
unpreserved and 10% formalin-fixed stool specimens prior to testing with the BD
MAX EPP. The claimed storage conditions for either unpreserved or 10% formalin-
fixed stool are at 2 – 25 °C for a maximum of 48 hours and at 2 – 8 °C for up to 120
hours (five days). The claimed storage conditions for samples inoculated into Sample
Buffer Tubes are at 2 – 25 °C for a maximum of 48 hours and at 2 – 8 °C for up to
120 hours.
C. parvum, G. lamblia, and E. histolytica target organisms were spiked into negative
unpreserved and fixed stool matrices at a final target concentration of 2X LoD.
Contrived specimens were also inoculated into SBTs and stability was evaluated
either before or after the pre-warm step of the BD MAX EPP procedure. Testing
included 24 replicates for each test condition at baseline, 24, and 48 hours for storage
claims at 25°C ± 2°C, and at 48 hours and 120 hours for storage claims at 5 °C ± 3°C.
The specimen stability studies support the claimed storage times and conditions for
target DNA in both unpreserved and 10% formalin fixed stool. The SBT stability
studies support the claimed storage times and conditions for target DNA in SBT
either before or after the pre-warm step.

d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined in an analytical study: Stock organisms
were purified and quantified for inclusion in this study. Individual inoculating loops
were dipped into each organism preparation and were then transferred to a Sample
Buffer Tube, already containing fecal matrix (unpreserved or 10% formalin-fixed)
that was pre-determined to be negative for all the targets detected by the BD MAX
Enteric Parasite Panel. Each organism was tested with a minimum of 30 replicates per
specimen type (unpreserved or 10% formalin-fixed), by a single operator, using three
different production lots of the BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel kits. Each LOD,
defined as the lowest concentration at which greater than 95% of all replicates are
expected to test positive, ranged from 10.67 to 160.17 organisms per milliliter (in
SBT) and 1,601 to 24,026 organisms per milliliter (in stool) for unpreserved
specimens, and 10.04 to 154.25 organisms per milliliter (in SBT) and 6,024 to 92,550
(in stool) for 10% formalin-fixed specimens.
Results are shown in the following table.

Inclusivity/reactivity
Inclusivity was assessed through testing clinically relevant and geographically diverse
organism isolates for each of the assay target organisms. Twenty-two isolates
representing the three assay targets were tested (11 isolates of Giardia lamblia and
Giardia intestinalis, 10 isolates of Entamoeba histolytica, and one isolate of
Cryptosporidium hominis). The isolates were tested at 2X the LOD in unpreserved

stool matrix either as target pools containing two assay targets each or individually
(Table 13). The BD MAX EPP detected all isolates.
Genomic DNA extracts from 13 individual human clinical stool specimens (nine C.
hominis, three C. parvum, and one C. ubiquitum) collected during routine clinical
testing or from a Cryptosporidiosis outbreak in 2005 were also tested (Table 14). The
assay identified all 13 genomic DNA extracts as being positive for C.
hominis/parvum.
Additionally, genomic DNA and prepared genomic DNA libraries were also
evaluated. One genomic DNA representative of each BD MAX Enteric Parasite
Panel target was tested at 2X the LOD for the assay (Table 15). Due to the lack of
availability of Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium hominis organisms,
commercially available genomic DNA libraries prepared from nine distinct
Cryptosporidium parvum isolates were also evaluated as supplementary information.
The BD MAX EPP detected all samples at the concentrations tested.

Cross reactivity:
The BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel was performed on samples containing
phylogenetically related species and other organisms (bacteria, viruses, parasites and
yeast) likely to be found in stool specimens. Potentially cross-reacting organisms are
listed in Tables 16 - 18. Results are summarized below:
· Six (6) out of 6 Entamoeba spp. (Entamoeba species other than E. histolytica)
produced negative results with the BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel. The
organisms were tested directly from stock at a 1:10 dilution to obtain the
highest possible concentration in the Sample Buffer Tube, with concentrations
ranging from 4.00x103 organisms/mL to 2.90x105 organisms/mL in the
Sample Buffer Tube. E. barretti (ATCC 30996) was provided as non-titered
stock.
· One (1) out of 1 Cryptosporidium meleagridis strain tested at a concentration
≥ 1x105 cysts/mL in the Sample Buffer Tube, produced positive results with
the BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel. C. meleagridis has been documented in

Interference:
Twenty-two (22) biological and chemical substances occasionally used or found in stool
specimens were evaluated for potential interference with the BD MAX Enteric Parasite
Panel near the LOD for each particular target. Antibiotics were included as a combination
of 8 different antibiotics tested simultaneously, with each antibiotic at a concentration
that may be excreted in a stool specimen. Three of the substances exhibited potential
interference with the BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel (refer to Table 19). Vagisil cream
demonstrated potential interference at concentrations greater than 9% in stool. Whole
human blood demonstrated potential interference at concentrations greater than 25% in
stool. Additional testing with grossly bloody clinical stool specimens showed potential
interference in one out of a total of 12 specimens tested. Substances that demonstrated
interference may result in unresolved (UNR), indeterminate (IND), or false negative
assay results.

Fresh versus Frozen Study
A fresh versus frozen study was performed to support the use of frozen unpreserved stool
specimens in the clinical study; the test is not intended for use on frozen samples. Seven
individual negative clinical unpreserved stool specimens were used to prepare a panel of
sixty-six positive samples spiked with each of the three target organisms at various
concentrations. The panel included low positive (2X LoD; 24 replicates), moderate
positive (4X LoD; 24 replicates), as well as high positive samples (10X, 50X, and 100X
LoD; 6 replicates each). Panels were tested with the BD MAX EPP at baseline, stored at
-20 °C, and then exposed to a total of 10 freeze/thaw cycles. The samples were tested
again after every other freeze/thaw cycle. One C. parvum replicate and one E. histolytica
replicate produced Unresolved results at baseline testing and were excluded from
analysis. All replicates with positive baseline results were positive with the BD MAX
EPP for up to 10 freeze/thaw cycles. The results indicate that up to 10 freeze/thaw cycles
with unpreserved stool should not significantly affect the performance of the BD MAX
EPP as compared to fresh specimen testing.

Carryover/Cross-Contamination
A study was conducted to investigate within-run carryover and between-run carryover
while processing specimens with a high load of Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium
parvum, and Entamoeba histolytica in the BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel. A panel was
prepared with one high positive member containing all three target organisms and one
negative member. Isolates of Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica and
Cryptosporidium parvum were spiked at 1 x 105 cysts/trophozoites per mL to prepare the
high positive panel member. The negative member did not contain any target analyte.
Twelve (12) replicates of the high positive panel member and 12 replicates of the
negative panel member were tested in each run by alternating negative and positive
samples. Two (2) operators performed a total of 15 runs with each run containing 24
samples.
Carryover contamination was assessed for each target in the BD MAX Enteric Parasite
Panel. A total of 180 Sample Buffer Tubes, each containing the three BD MAX Enteric
Parasite Panel targets, were assessed in the carryover contamination study. All of the 180
spiked Sample Buffer Tubes produced the expected positive results for all three target
organisms. A total of 180 Sample Buffer Tubes, each negative for all three BD MAX
Enteric Parasite Panel targets, were also assessed in the carryover contamination study.
One hundred and seventy-eight (178) of the 180 spiked Sample Buffer Tubes produced
the expected negative results. One expected negative result was positive for Giardia
lamblia and the second was positive for both Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica
in a single Sample Buffer Tube. The overall carryover/cross-contamination rate was
1.1%.
Mixed Infection/ Competitive Interference
The mixed infection/competitive interference study was designed to evaluate the ability
of the BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel to detect low positive results in the presence of
other targets at high concentrations. Four (4) organisms (Giardia lamblia,
Cryptosporidium parvum and two preparations of Entamoeba histolytica) were
individually prepared at 2X their respective LOD to serve as a low concentration target in
the BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel Sample Buffer Tube. A high concentration target
mix of the other two BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel analytes was spiked into the
Sample Buffer Tube at a final concentration of > 1x105 organisms/mL along with 10 µL
of unpreserved stool and tested to simulate mixed infections. The second target mix for
Entamoeba histolytica also contained Entamoeba dispar prepared as just described for
the other high concentration targets. All four low concentration target organisms were
successfully detected by the BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel when combined with other
organisms at high concentrations to simulate mixed infections.
f. Assay cut-off:
Assay cut-offs for the BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel were determined in analytical
verification experiments and then subsequently validated using data from the multi-site

3. Clinical studies:
A multicenter clinical study was conducted to assess the performance of the BD MAX
Enteric Parasite Panel for the identification of Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium
parvum/hominis and Entamoeba histolytica, from unpreserved or 10% formalin-fixed
stool specimens from symptomatic patients suspected of gastroenteritis, enteritis and/or
colitis. The study evaluated results obtained with the BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel
compared to those obtained with the reference method.
The study involved a total of five (5) clinical sites where specimens were collected and
tested on the BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel, as well as seven (7) sites which served as
collection sites. Clinical centers were selected for the study based on a number of criteria,
such as investigator and site personnel availability, number of specimens of interest,
target prevalence, routinely collected specimen types, and familiarity with PCR
methodology. Additionally, an internal site was involved as a clinical center to perform
BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel testing on specimens supplied by collection sites.
Samples tested at BD were obtained from all collection sites. Specimens consisted of a
mix of 10% formalin-fixed and unpreserved specimens as well as a mix of prospective
and retrospective specimens. Only excess, de-identified patient specimens were used.
A total of 2204 prospective specimens (1128 10% formalin-fixed, 1058 unpreserved and
18 non-compliant) and 411 retrospective specimens (148 10% formalin-fixed, 251
unpreserved and 12 non-compliant) were enrolled in the clinical evaluation.
Retrospective unpreserved specimens were stored at -20 °C or colder. Out of 978
compliant prospective unpreserved specimens, 287 were stored at -20 °C or colder. A
total of 128 retrospective specimens were not included in the performance calculations as
the historical results were not confirmed by an alternate PCR and bi-directional
sequencing.

For the 10% formalin fixed specimen type, the BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel identified
90.3% and 99.8% of the Cryptosporidium parvum/hominis prospective positive and
negative specimens, respectively, and 93% and 100% of the retrospective positive and
negative specimens, respectively. For the unpreserved specimen type, the BD MAX
Enteric Parasite Panel identified 100% and 99.5% of the Cryptosporidium
parvum/hominis prospective positive and negative specimens, respectively, and 97.7%
and 98.4% of the retrospective positive and negative specimens, respectively (Table 22).
Because DFA identifies Cryptosporidium to the genus level, DFA-positive specimens
identified by bi-directional sequencing as other than C. hominis or C. parvum were
considered reference method negative.

1 All six specimens were positive by the DFA component of the reference method. One specimen sequenced as C. parvum,
three (3) specimens were negative, and two (2) were non-reportable by the alternate PCR and bi-directional sequencing
components of the composite reference method.
2 Discrepant repeat testing with the alternate PCR and bi-directional sequencing was performed on all six (6) specimens. One
(1) specimen sequenced as Cryptosporidium parvum, one (1) specimen sequenced as Cryptosporidium felis and the remaining
four (4) were PCR negative by discrepant repeat testing. Discrepant testing was also performed using an antigen detecting
EIA that does not distinguish between Cryptosporidium and Giardia. Two specimens were EIA negative and four specimens
were EIA positive, of which two were positive for Giardia by other test methods.
3 One DFA-positive specimen was classified as reference method negative based on alternate PCR and bi-directional
sequencing results that identified Cryptosporidium meleagridis.
4 Six DFA-positive specimens were classified as reference method negative based on alternate PCR and bi-directional
sequencing results that identified (4) Cryptosporidium canis, (1) C. meleagridis and (1) Cryptosporidium spp. (undefined).
5 Discrepant repeat testing was performed with BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel in twelve (12) replicates per specimen. One

As Entamoeba histolytica is a rare analyte, both prospective and retrospective testing
efforts were unable to demonstrate the positive percent agreement of the BD MAX
Enteric Parasite Panel. To supplement the prospective and retrospective data, an
evaluation of contrived specimens was performed. Surrogate clinical specimens were
prepared using residual specimens that had previously tested negative for all BD MAX

In the event of an unsuccessful pre-warm step with the BD MAX Pre-Warm heater, the
BD MAX System will display an error message. There were a total of 211 pre-warm
runs during the BD MAX EPP clinical study. A single BD MAX Pre-Warm failure was
observed for a failure rate of 0.5% (1/211).

Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
In the BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel clinical study, reportable results from compliant
specimens were obtained from clinical sites and compared to a composite reference
method. The study population was grouped based on specimen type and age. The number
and percentage of positive cases by target, as determined by the BD MAX Enteric
Parasite Panel during the prospective segment of the clinical trial, are presented below in
Table 30. Table 30 includes data from all clinical trial sites, including a state reference
laboratory that enrolled specimens that were presumptively positive for Cryptosporidium
as well as specimens collected outside of the US.
