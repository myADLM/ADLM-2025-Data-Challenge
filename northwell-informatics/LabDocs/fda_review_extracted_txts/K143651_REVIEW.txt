L. Test Principle:
The Simplexa™ Group A Strep Direct assay system is a real-time PCR system that enables
the direct amplification and qualitative detection of Group A Strep bacterial DNA from
throat swabs that have not undergone a nucleic acid extraction. The system consists of the
Simplexa™ Group A Strep Direct assay, the 3M Integrated Cycler (with Integrated Cycler
Studio Software), the Direct Amplification Disc (DAD) and associated accessories.
In the Simplexa™ Group A Strep Direct assay, bi-functional fluorescent probe-primers are
used together with corresponding reverse primers to amplify Group A Strep bacterial DNA
and the Internal Control (DNA IC). The assay targets a conserved region of Group A Strep
(pyrogenic exotoxin B gene) to identify this bacteria in the specimen. The DNA IC is used to
detect PCR failure and/or inhibition.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision Study
Within-laboratory, inter-lot precision was evaluated for the Simplexa™ Group A
Strep Direct assay at one (1) site using two (2) strains of Group A Streptococci (GAS)
representative of serotypes M1 and M3 with four (4) panel members:
1) Negative
2) Low Positive (LP), 1 x LoD and
3) Moderate Positive (MP), 3.0 x LoD.
4) Positive Control (PC)
Contrived specimens were spiked from freshly-grown bacterial stocks into a
simulated negative matrix with target GAS at the final intended target concentration
(confirmed by titration and plate count). Cell preparations were frozen at -70oC after
preparation until testing. The LoD values were based on the values obtained in the
LoD study. See section M.2.b below for details on the matrix equivalency and freeze-
thaw study.
The study was conducted with three (3) different Reaction Mix lots. Each panel
member was run in duplicate (2), twice (2) per day for three (3) non-consecutive days
by one (1) operator at one (1) site (2 replicates x twice per day x 3 days x 3 lots = 36
replicates/panel member/strain). The results are shown in Table I.

in labeling.
Reproducibility Study
The reproducibility of the Simplexa™ Group A Strep Direct assay was established in
a multi-center study. The same strains and panel members were prepared and tested
as listed in the precision study above (Table I). Panel members were tested in
triplicate (3) in two (2) runs per day each by a different operator at three (3) sites for
five (5) non-consecutive days (3 replicates x 2 operators runs x 3 sites x 5 days = 90
replicates/panel member). These studies were conducted with a single (1) lot of
positive control and reagents across the three (3) sites. The results are shown in Table
II.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Simplexa™ Group A Strep Direct and Simplexa™ Group A Strep Positive
Control Pack have been determined to be stable for at least 14 months of real-time
stability over a temperature range from -14 oC to -28 oC. The products are labeled
with a 12 month expiration date.
To assess the room-temperature stability of positive control aliquots of positive
control were thawed and kept at room temperature for 8 hours and 24 hours and
tested to determine room temperature stability. The positive control is stable up to 24
hours when stored at room temperature.
To assess the room-temperature stability of Simplexa™ Group A Strep Reaction Mix,
the Reaction Mix was thawed from -20oC and kept at room temperature for 30 and 60
minutes. Positive Control (PC) was tested in quadruplicate (4) with singlet (1) of
unspiked Aimes medium as a negative sample. The Reaction Mix stability was
established and the labeling instructs the end user to use within 30 minutes from
thawing.
Clinical studies demonstrate that swab specimens are stable for over 24 h.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) of the Simplexa™ Group A Strep Direct assay was
determined using contrived stocks of two (2) GAS serotypes which were prepared per
the protocol described in the precision study section (see M.1.a above). The LoD
study was conducted using two (2) lots on four (4) instruments. The LoD was defined
as the point at which at least 95% of all replicates tested positive (C ). Eight (8)
95
dilutions from each serotype were screened in triplicate (3). The lowest dilution at
which all three (3) replicates were detected was confirmed using twenty (20)
additional replicates for each serotype at that concentration. Two invalid replicates
were observed due to internal control failure. The LoD study results are shown in
Table III below.

with twenty-one (21) GAS strains, in addition to those tested in the LoD studies, in
replicates of three (3) per strain near at 2-3 x LoD (1.50 x 103) using the LoD
determined for the M1 serotype (LoD = 682 CFU/ml) as the basis. If detection failure
was experienced, the concentration of the particular strain was increased until all
three (3) replicates were positively detected.
This study was performed with one (1) reagent lot on two (2) different instruments,
performed by two (2) operators. Each cultured strain was prepared per the protocol
described above in M.1.a above. The inclusivity study results and the final organism
concentrations tested are shown in Table IV below. All GAS strains were correctly
detected by the assay at the concentrations indicated.

i. Microbial cross-reactivity
An in silico BLAST analysis of primers used in the Simplexa™ Group A Strep
Direct assay against the NCBI database did not show evidence of cross-reactivity
with organisms that might be found in throat swab specimens.
A study was performed to evaluate the performance of the Simplexa™ Group A
Strep Direct assay in the presence of sixty-four (64) potentially cross-reacting
bacteria and viruses commonly found in throat specimens (see Table V below).
Each organism was tested in triplicate in the presence of clinically relevant levels
of viruses (105 PFU/ml) and bacteria (106 CFU/ml) or higher. All strains were
spiked into simulated negative matrix and evaluated using one (1) lot and two (2)
instruments by two (2) operators.

None of the sixty-four (64) bacteria and viruses tested that might be found in
throat swab specimens cross-react with the assay.
These study results are acceptable and these results are described in labeling.
ii. Microbial interference
Interference studies were conducted with each of the sixty-four (64)
microorganisms listed above in Table V. Each organism was tested in triplicate in
the presence of clinically relevant levels of viruses (105 PFU/ml) and bacteria (106
CFU/ml) or higher. All strains were spiked into simulated negative matrix along
with 2-4 x LoD Group A Streptococcus serotypes M1 and M3 and evaluated
using one (1) lot and two (2) instruments by two (2) operators. None of the
organisms interfered with the detection of the Group A Streptococcal strains.
iii. Interfering substances
Twenty-nine (29) chemical and biological substances likely to be found in throat
swab specimens were evaluated for potential to interfere with the Simplexa™
Group A Strep Direct assay, including blood (10% v/v), mucin (60µg/ml) and
saliva (50µl/swab). Each substance was tested in triplicate using two serotypes of
Streptococcus pyogenes (M1 and M3), tested near 3 x LoD at medically relevant
concentrations. None of the substances tested were found to interfere with the
Simplexa™ Group A Strep Direct assay.
iv. Carryover/Cross-contamination
A study to assess carryover contamination was conducted with another previously
cleared kit (k120413) and the results were determined to be acceptable. Due to the
similarities of risks posed by the previous device and the Simplexa™ Group A
Strep Direct device, no carryover studies were conducted for this assay.

A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to determine the
cycle threshold (Ct) cutoff for the Simplexa™ Group A Strep Direct assay. Using
ROC analysis and the Ct spread from the LoD as well as the clinical study, the Ct cut-
off was set at 45. This value was used to determine assay results in the analytical and
clinical studies.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
A comparison study was conducted between negative clinical matrix and a contrived
negative matrix in order to validate the use of the contrived negative matrix in place
of a clinical negative matrix for the analytic studies in section M1 above. Contrived
negative matrix was comprised of Amies medium with 9% w/v mucin and 1% v/v
whole blood, constructed to mimic challenging clinical specimens. The matrix
comparison study results are shown in Table VI below.

These studies demonstrate that the contrived negative matrix is produces results that
are equivalent to those obtained with a clinical matrix. These study results are
acceptable.
3. Clinical studies:
Performance characteristics of the Simplexa™ Group A Strep Direct assay were
established during a prospective study using fresh left-over throat swabs collected from
and tested at four (4) clinical sites across the United States between May 6, 2014 and
October 28, 2014. The assay was evaluated for the qualitative detection and
differentiation of Group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus nucleic acids in comparison to
culture. Discrepant analysis was conducted using bi-directional sequencing.
One thousand three hundred and ninety-seven (1397) specimens collected during clinical
trials, of which one thousand three hundred and ninety-six (1396) were tested with the
Simplexa™ Group A Strep Direct. Of these, one thousand three hundred and ninety-two
(1392) specimens provided valid results from the Simplexa™ Group A Strep Direct and
one thousand three hundred and fifty-seven (1357) were evaluable by culture. Of these,
one thousand three hundred and fifty-two (1352) specimens were evaluable by both the
test and reference method and could be used to evaluate the Simplexa™ Group A Strep
Direct. The invalid rate observed during the clinical prospective study for this device was

The positive control for this assay is an inactivated GAS strain. The negative control
is a no-template control. The positive and negative external quality control isolates
provided were tested at least once per day during the clinical studies for each
instrument used in the study for that day. One positive control lot was used
throughout the clinical trials. All valid Group A Streptococcus positive controls were
detected accurately (100%, 203/203). All valid no-template controls were detected
accurately (100%, 204/204). During these studies, there were four (4) invalid negative
controls and five (5) invalid positive controls. In each instance, the controls were
repeated successfully during the same day on the same instrument.
b. Clinical specificity:
See table above.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The overall incidence of Group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus in patients tested during this
study was 11.2% (152/1352) based on culture results. All clinical specimens collected
during this study were collected between May 6, 2014 and October 28, 2014.
