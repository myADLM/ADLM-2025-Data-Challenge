infection, if used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings. The results of
this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or patient
management decisions.
Negative results in the presence of a respiratory illness do not preclude respiratory
infection and may be due to infection with pathogens that are not detected by this test or
lower respiratory tract infection that is not detected by an NPS specimen. Conversely,
positive results do not rule-out infection or co-infection with organisms not detected by RP
Flex. The agent(s) detected may not be the definite cause of disease. The use of additional
laboratory testing and clinical presentation may be necessary to establish a final diagnosis
of respiratory infection.
Clinical evaluation indicates a lower sensitivity specific to RP Flex for the detection of
Rhinovirus. If infection with Rhinovirus is suspected, negative samples should be
confirmed using an alternative method.
Performance characteristics for Influenza A were established when Influenza A/H1 (2009
Pandemic) and A/H3 were the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation. RP Flex
may not detect novel Influenza A strains. If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is
suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended
by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection
control precautions used specifically for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to
appropriate health authorities for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these
cases unless a biosafety level (BSL) 3+ facility is available to receive and culture
specimens.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Verigene® System
I. Device Description:
The Verigene RP Flex is performed on the Verigene System. The Verigene System consists of
a Verigene Reader and multiple Verigene Processor SP modules or units. Each Processor SP
module processes one sample at a time under the control of the Verigene Reader. The RP Flex
components required to perform the test include the following single-use, disposables:
• RP Flex Test Cartridge
• RP Flex Extraction Tray (with Tip Holder Assembly)
• RP Flex Amplification Tray
• Verigene Sample Well Caps
3

--- Page 4 ---
Prior to initiating a test on the Verigene Processor SP, a 200 μL aliquot of NPS in Viral
Transport Media (VTM) is pipetted into the Sample Loading Well within the Extraction Tray
and a Sample Well Cap is used to cover the Sample Loading Well. The Extraction Tray, Tip
Holder, and Amplification Tray are loaded into the Verigene Processor SP. Next, the barcode
located on the RP Flex Test Cartridge is entered via the scanner attached to the Verigene
Reader, and the associated sample information is entered either using the barcode-scanner or
the Verigene Reader touch-screen interface. This links specific patient information to a
specific Test Cartridge number. The RP Flex Test Cartridge is then inserted into the Processor
SP. The Drawer Assembly is closed to initiate the test. The Processor SP identifies the Test
Cartridge via an internal barcode scanner and communicates with the Verigene Reader to
receive test instructions. Once the Processor SP module completes processing (about 2 hours),
the RP Flex Test Cartridge is removed and inserted into the Verigene Reader for automated
identification of the gene-specific nucleic acids.
The RP Flex detects a total of 17 nucleic acid targets as listed in Table 1 below. For each
intended RP Flex target, four sequence components, referred to as oligonucleotides (Oligos),
consisting of one or more Capture probe(s), Mediator probe(s), forward primer(s), and reverse
primer(s), are required.

*Detection of Influenza A without an Influenza A/H1 or Influenza A/H3 subtype may occur at low titer of the
virus in the specimen or may indicate a false positive due to contamination. The result could also indicate a
novel Influenza A strain. In these cases, the sample should be retested. If an Influenza A detected result is
obtained without detection of an Influenza A/H1 or A/H3 subtype upon retesting, contact local or state public
health authorities for confirmatory testing.
**Detection of Influenza A/H1 or Influenza A/H3 subtypes without an Influenza A “Detected” result may
occur at low titer of the virus in the specimen or may indicate a false positive due to contamination. The result
could also indicate potential genetic mutations in the Matrix protein gene among circulating seasonal Influenza
A viruses. In these cases, the sample should be retested. If an Influenza A/H1 or A/H3 subtype detected result
is obtained again without detection of Influenza A upon repeat testing, further investigations may be
warranted.
***Since the RP Flex Bordetella parapertussis/bronchiseptica probes also detect Bordetella pertussis, if a
Bordetella pertussis “Detected” result is obtained, the results for Bordetella parapertussis/bronchiseptica are
not to be considered as they do not indicate the presence or absence of Bordetella parapertussis / Bordetella
bronchiseptica. The result of Bordetella parapertussis/bronchiseptica is reported as “N/A” upon a “Detected”
result for Bordetella pertussis.
Calls related to an invalid Verigene RP Flex test are listed in Table 3 below, together with the
appropriate recourse which should be taken by the user.

The Verigene RP Flex test is a multiplexed molecular assay with automated isolation,
amplification, and detection of unique genomic sequences of target pathogens. Verigene RP
Flex is performed using the Verigene System, which is a bench-top sample-to-result molecular
diagnostics workstation consisting of two modules: the Verigene Processor SP and the
Verigene Reader. The Verigene Processor SP automates the Verigene RP Flex sample
analysis steps including: (1) Specimen Extraction—Magnetic bead-based RNA/DNA
extraction from nasopharyngeal swab specimens obtained from symptomatic patients; (2)
Target Amplification--Multiplex RT-PCR- and PCR-based amplification of the extracted
nucleic acids to generate target-specific amplicons; (3) Hybridization—Amplicon
hybridization to target specific capture DNA in a microarray format and mediator and gold-
nanoparticle probe hybridization to captured amplicons. Silver enhancement of the gold
nanoparticle probes bound at the capture sites results in gold-silver aggregates that are imaged
optically with high efficiency by the Verigene Reader. The Verigene Reader also serves as
the user interface and central control unit for the Verigene System, storing and tracking
information throughout the assay process.
The Verigene Processor SP utilizes single-use consumables to perform Verigene RP Flex test,
including an Extraction Tray, Amplification Tray and Test Cartridge. A separate Tip Holder
Assembly contains two pipette tips that are used to transfer and mix reagents during the assay.
The user tests a specimen by loading the single-use consumables into the Verigene Processor
SP, pipetting the prepared specimen into the Extraction Tray, and initiating the protocol on the
Verigene Reader by scanning or entering the Test Cartridge ID and specimen information.
Following assay completion, the user inserts the Substrate Holder portion of the Test
Cartridge into the Verigene Reader for optical analysis and generation of Verigene RP Flex
test results.
Extraction
The isolation consists of an initial lysis of the viral or bacterial cells using proteases and
chaotropic agents followed by the binding of the released nucleic acids to magnetic beads. The
nucleic acid-bound magnetic beads are washed to eliminate cell debris, lysis buffers, and
potential interferents, following which, the nucleic acids are eluted off the beads and made
available for amplification.
Amplification
The nucleic acid amplification consists of a first step reverse transcription (RT) to convert any
viral genomic RNA to complimentary DNA (cDNA) amenable to subsequent multiplexed
PCR amplification. The multiplexed RT-PCR step is conducted in a single closed tube that
contains both the reverse transcriptase and the PCR polymerase enzymes along with the
target-specific primers, dNTP nucleotides, and buffers.
Contamination Control
The RP Flex test has multiple mitigations in place to handle potential contamination of PCR.
First, each test is performed with a set of single-use consumables that inherently minimize
contamination due to carryover and cross-contamination. Second, the RP Flex test includes a
Uracil DNA Glycosylase (UDG) enzyme-based strategy to eliminate amplicon contamination.
10

--- Page 11 ---
Briefly, the dNTP formulation contains deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) in place of the
standard deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP), and during the multiplexed RT-PCR step
dUTP is incorporated into the amplicons. Prior to the start of an amplification step, the UDG
enzyme renders any dUTP-containing amplicons non-amplifiable by selectively hydrolyzing
at the uracil base. The RP Flex test uses a thermolabile version of UDG enzyme which is
inactivated by heat prior to the RT step and does not interfere with the newly-generated cDNA
and/or the amplicon from the test. While the UDG-based strategy mitigates false positive risk
due to lab-based carryover and cross-contamination, incomplete hydrolysis of uracil-
containing amplicons may lead to amplification and detection of a contaminant. Additionally,
this strategy does not address genomic contamination during the preparation of the samples.
Strict adherence to the prescribed handling/preparation of samples and laboratory/system
cleaning protocols and careful disposal of the used consumables can reduce the likelihood of
contamination from user-based sources.
End-Point Detection and Analysis
The target-specific amplicon is detected in an endpoint assay that utilizes a microarray format.
For each of the bacterial or viral nucleic acid sequences/analytes detected by the RP Flex test,
two types of oligonucleotides are required for the endpoint gold nanoparticle probe-based
detection: (1) Capture oligonucleotides (or captures) and (2) Mediator oligonucleotides (or
mediators). The Capture oligonucleotides are printed on the Test Substrate (the microarray)
and are designed to specifically bind to one part of the analyte-specific target amplicon. The
Mediator oligonucleotides bind to a different portion of the same amplicon and enable binding
of gold nanoparticle probes. Notably, in a multiplexed detection system, numerous unique
target-specific mediators can coexist and form unique hybridizations at the different captures
on the microarray. Since all the mediators have a target specific region and a poly-A tail
region, a single, universal gold nanoparticle poly-T probe is sufficient for target/mediator
labeling. Silver enhancement of the bound gold nanoparticle probes at the capture sites results
in gold-silver aggregates that scatter light with high efficiency. Light scatter from the capture
spots is imaged by the Verigene Reader and intensities from the microarray spots are
processed by a decision algorithm to make calls regarding the presence (Detected) or absence
(Not Detected) of a nucleic acid sequence/analyte.

a. Precision Study and Reproducibility Study :
Precision Study
A study was conducted to evaluate the precision (repeatability) of the RP Flex. RP Flex
performance was assessed across several sources of variability including operators, days,
consumable lots, and Verigene instruments. The Precision Study used three lots of each
of the consumables (cartridges, extraction trays and amplification trays). All precision
testing was performed at a single laboratory site with one Verigene reader and 12
Verigene Processor SPs.

In this study, a representative test panel was tested daily in duplicate by two operators
for 12 non-consecutive days for a total of 48 tests per sample. The test panel,
representing all the RP Flex analytes except for B. parapertussis and B. bronchiseptica,
consisted of two negative samples (one negative simulated NPS matrix and one
Staphylococcus aureus spiked in negative simulated NPS matrix), as well as seven
positive mixed samples at two different concentrations for a total of 16 unique samples.
The composition and concentration of each sample is provided in Table 4 below.
Samples were prepared by spiking previously characterized and quantified organism
stocks into simulated NPS matrix at Moderate Positive (5x LoD) and Low Positive (2x
LoD) concentrations. Each unique sample was divided into single-use aliquots of 300
µL each and frozen at ≤ -70 °C until ready for use.

Reproducibility Study
A reproducibility study was also conducted at three testing sites to evaluate the inter-
laboratory reproducibility of the RP Flex. RP Flex performance was assessed across
several sources of variability including locations, operators, days, sample replicates,
consumable lots, and Verigene instruments. The RP Flex reproducibility study
encompassed five cartridges lots, six extraction tray lots and four amplification tray lots.
A total of three Verigene Readers and 39 Verigene Processor SP systems were utilized
across the three testing sites (one internal and two external laboratory sites), with each
site using one Verigene Reader with 12 to 14 Verigene Processor SPs.
In this reproducibility study, the same representative test panel of samples as presented
in Table 2 previously was tested daily, in triplicate, by two operators for five non-
consecutive days at three sites for a total of 90 tests per sample (3 sites x 2 operators /
site x 3 replicates / operator x 5 days = 90 tests per sample).
The RP Flex results obtained during the Reproducibility Study are presented for each
RP Flex target evaluated in Table 6 below. The positive percent agreement for each
analyte was determined for the low and moderate positive samples. The negative
percent agreement for each analyte was assessed for the negative samples, as well as
all samples that did not contain the particular target organism.

The RP Flex microarray contains two sets of oligonucleotide spots that are used as
process controls to check for proper fluid control, extraction, amplification,
hybridization and signal detection. The IC1 (hybridization control) internal processing
control probes detect the presence (hybridization and signal enhancement) of a DNA
oligonucleotide and mediator oligo contained within the Sample Buffer on the
Extraction Tray. The IC2 (extraction control) control probes verify the presence of an
amplicon for Bacteriophage MS2, which is added to the sample prior to the nucleic acid
extraction step. Both internal processing controls IC1 and IC2 must be present for a
valid respiratory pathogen Not Detected call for all targets to be reported. If IC1 or IC2
is Not Detected, a No Call – INT CTL 1 or a No Call – INT CTL 2 result, respectively,
is generated. If both IC1 and IC2 are Not Detected, a No Call – INT CTL result is
generated. The IC2 is not utilized for the detection of positive samples. The IC1 is
required for the detection of positive samples.
A set of regions on microarray which do not contain capture oligonucleotides is used as
a control for background signal levels. If the signal in these background regions is too
high, a No Call - BKGD is generated. Additionally, negative control oligomer spots are
included on the array to ensure the hybridization stringency was sufficient. If the
negative control signal is too high a No Call – NEG CTL is generated.

Each capture probe has six separate oligonucleotide spots on the microarray in six
different areas. Mathematical algorithms, called spot filters, compare the array spot
signals for a particular target as a set. Any individual spot signal in the target set that is
determined to be an outlier is discarded. After applying the spot filters, the probe set
must include four or more capture spots for a Call decision to be made for a target.
Additionally, the coefficient of variation of spot intensities in the set must be less than or
equal to 70%. If these requirements are not met a No Call - VARIATION results. The
spot signal comparison algorithms protect against some hybridization failures and also
against fluidics failures such as the partial filling of the hybridization chamber.
External controls are not provided with the RP Flex. However, five external control
mixes (see Table 8 below) were provided to the clinical study sites for daily testing
during the prospective clinical study. External controls were tested on each day of
testing, utilizing one external negative control and one of four external positive controls
(tested on a rotating basis) representing all of the RP Flex targets.

The sponsor is also recommending the following in the product package insert: “Good
laboratory practice recommends running external positive and negative controls
regularly. Viral transport medium may be used as the external Negative Control, and
previously characterized positive samples or negative sample spiked with well
characterized target organisms may be used as external Positive Controls. Regardless of
the choice of quality control materials, external controls should be used in accordance
with local, state, federal accrediting organizations, as applicable.”
Specimen Stability
An analytical study was performed to establish the recommended transport and storage
conditions for nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens eluted in VTM that will be tested
using the RP Flex.
A total of 14 viral and bacterial strains in negative natural clinical NPS in VTM were
evaluated. These strains are representative of all of the 16 RP Flex targets. Each strain
was prepared at Low Positive (2x LoD) and Moderate Positive (5x LoD)
concentrations in pooled negative natural clinical NPS in VTM. The negative natural
clinical NPS (collected in VTM) used for this study consisted of nasopharyngeal swab
in VTM specimens that were previously screened to be negative for any respiratory

organisms in the RP Flex panel. Each sample was tested once with the RP Flex test and
generated negative results for all RP Flex panel analytes.
Initial testing was performed to establish the baseline time point (t = 0) for the study,
and additional aliquots of the samples were stored at each of the following temperature
conditions: (1) 20-25°C, (2) 2-8°C, and (3) Frozen (≤-70°C).
At the designated time points, shown in Table 9 below, one aliquot of each strain at
each concentration was tested with the RP Flex test in replicates of three. The 2-8°C
and 20-25°C samples were tested immediately, while the frozen aliquots were thawed
at room temperature for 10-30 minutes prior to testing.

The results of this specimen stability study support the stability claim for RP Flex testing
of clinical NPS specimens preserved in VTM at the following storage conditions: 4
hours at 20-25°C, 72 hours at 2-8°C, and 30 days at <-70°C.
Simulated Nasopharyngeal Swabs in VTM Sample Matrix (Simulated NPS)
The RP Flex test is intended for use with nasopharyngeal swabs specimens (NPS)
collected in Viral Transport Media (VTM). However, the collection, and screening of
negative clinical natural NPS collected in VTM is burdensome. Additionally, such
clinical specimens are likely to contain low concentrations of RP Flex targeted
organisms which could lead to unexpected positive test results. Consequently, a
simulated nasopharyngeal swab (Simulated NPS) matrix was developed and used to
contrive samples for the majority of the analytical studies.
The Simulated NPS matrix was formulated to resemble the content of a clinical NPS
specimen collected in VTM as closely as possible, such that the matrix would not
artificially alter the performance of the test. A matrix comprised of 2.00E+03 HeLa
cells/mL in Universal Transport Media (UTM) was selected as the composition of
Simulated NPS. Analytical study demonstrated that 2.00E+03 HeLa cells/mL in UTM
had similar DNA content as observed in NPS specimens collected in VTM from human
20

donors. Accordingly, Simulated NPS matrix for the contrived samples used for
analytical testing was UTM containing HeLa cells at a concentration of 2.00E+03
cells/mL.
Equivalence of Simulated and Natural Clinical NPS
This study was designed to demonstrate the equivalence of Simulated NPS used in
analytical studies, with clinically-derived natural NPS. As described in the “Simulated
NPS” section previously, the Simulated NPS tested in this study was UTM containing
HeLa cells at a concentration of 2.00E+03 cells/mL. The negative natural clinical NPS
(collected in VTM) used for this study consisted of nasopharyngeal swab in VTM
specimens that were previously screened to be negative for any respiratory organisms in
the RP Flex panel.
Sixteen (16) of the 28 strains described in the “Detection Limit” section representing all
of the RP Flex targets, were evaluated for their LoD performance in negative natural
clinical NPS (collected in VTM). Freshly prepared samples in negative natural clinical
NPS were tested in replicates of 20 at the LoD established for fresh Simulated NPS as
detailed in the “LoD Studies” section. If all 20 replicates of the negative natural clinical
NPS sample were detected (100%), 3-fold lower concentrations were tested until a
detection rate ≤ 95% was obtained. If the initial detection rate was less than 95%, 3-fold
higher concentrations were tested until the detection rate of the intended analyte was ≥
95%. The performance of the test with samples prepared in negative natural clinical NPS
and in Simulated NPS was considered to be equivalent if the LoD for the two sample
types are within one dilution (i.e. 3-fold).
Confirmation of the LoD for the 16 organisms contrived in the negative natural clinical
NPS is summarized in Table 10 below. In all cases, the LoDs for strains contrived in
negative natural clinical NPS were determined to be equivalent to the LoDs for the
strains contrived in Simulated NPS; all LoDs were within one dilution (+/- 3-fold) of
the fresh Simulated NPS samples, meeting the criterion for equivalency.

Fresh vs. Frozen Study
In order to utilize frozen banked clinical samples in the evaluation of RP Flex to
supplement the prospective clinical study data, and to use frozen simulated samples in
analytical studies, an analytical study was conducted to demonstrate that preservation of
samples (by freezing at ≤-70°C) does not affect the accuracy of the test results compared
to freshly collected or freshly prepared samples.
The study evaluated the analytical sensitivity (LoD) of frozen samples of organisms
prepared in Simulated NPS in comparison to LoD results of fresh samples prepared in
Simulated NPS as described in the “Equivalence of Simulated and Natural Clinical
NPS” study above. A panel of 16 strains, representing all of the RP Flex targets, was
prepared in Simulated NPS and frozen and stored at ≤ -70°C until used in testing.
Each of these samples was tested in replicates of 20 at the same LoD established for
fresh Simulated NPS as described in the “Equivalence of Simulated and Natural Clinical
NPS” study above. If all 20 replicates of the frozen sample were detected (100%), 3-
fold lower concentrations were tested until a detection rate of ≤ 95% was obtained. If
the initial detection rate was less than 95%, 3-fold higher concentrations were tested
until the detection rate of the intended analyte was ≥ 95%. The frozen Simulated NPS
samples were considered to be equivalent to the fresh Simulated NPS samples, if their
LoDs were within one dilution (i.e. 3-fold) of each other.
Confirmation of the LoD for the 16 frozen viral and bacterial samples contrived in the
Simulated NPS is summarized in Table 11 below. All LoDs for the frozen Simulated
NPS samples were found to be within one dilution (+/- 3-fold) of the fresh Simulated
NPS samples, meeting the criterion for equivalency.

This fresh vs. frozen study demonstrated that freezing and thawing of samples did not have a
significant impact on the sensitivity of the RP Flex detection of the target organisms. This
supports the use of the frozen NPS samples in the RP Flex analytical and clinical validation
studies.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of detection (LoD) studies were carried out with freshly-prepared samples in
Simulated NPS matrix designed to resemble a natural clinical NPS specimen, as
described in the “Simulated Nasopharyngeal Swabs in VTM Sample Matrix (Simulated
NPS)” section previously. An equivalence study was performed which confirmed that
the simulated matrix was equivalent to the natural clinical NPS matrix and does not
impact RP Flex test performance. Refer to the “Equivalence of Simulated and Natural
Clinical NPS” section for details of the study.
The LoDs of the RP Flex were established with the 28 representative strains of
organisms listed in Table 12 below. Identities of all viral and bacterial strains used in
LoD testing were confirmed by PCR and bi-directional sequencing (BDS) using
validated PCR systems for each RP Flex target.

To determine the LoDs, these previously characterized and quantitated bacterial and
viral strains were used to prepare a three-fold dilution series in Simulated NPS, and
each concentration was tested in replicates of four. The preliminary LoDs were
assessed to be the lowest concentration in which expected analytes were detected in all
four replicates. The preliminary LoD for a specific strain was then confirmed by
preparing and testing 20 additional replicates at that preliminary LoD concentration and
demonstrating that the intended analyte is detected >95% of the time. If the detection
rate was 100% (20/20), a further 20 replicates were tested at the next lowest
concentration. In the event that a detection rate below 95% was observed (<19/20) a 3-
fold higher concentration was tested.
The RP Flex results for the preliminary (upper row for each organism) and confirmatory
(lower row for each organism) LoD tests are summarized in Table 13 and Table 14 for

* As there is no susceptible cell line to grow Rhinovirus C, the strain was cloned into a plasmid vector and
transfected into WisL cells (primary human lung fibroblasts). Identity of the clone was confirmed by sequencing. The
titer was established by qPCR using serial dilutions of Rhinovirus 16 as a surrogate to provide actual PFU/mL values
for the standard curve. Therefore, it has been assumed that Rhinovirus 16 has similar virulence rates to Rhinovirus
C.

The final confirmed LoDs of the RP Flex targets determined in the LoD study for a
panel of 28 strains are summarized in Table 16 and Table 17 for viral and bacterial
organisms respectively. The final confirmed LoD values for each RP Flex target are
shown in Table 18. In cases where multiple strains were tested, the final RP Flex LoD
for a given target was assessed to be the highest LoD of the various strains.

e. Analytical Reactivity:
The analytical reactivity of the RP Flex test was demonstrated with a comprehensive
panel of 108 strains (see Table 19 below) representing temporal, evolutionary, and
geographic diversity for each of the RP Flex panel organisms. The selection of strains to
test was based on those detected by previously cleared assays including the Nanosphere
RV+ Nucleic Acid Test (K103209) and BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel (K123620,
K120267, K110764, and K103175), and on FDA recommendations during the pre-
submission review process. Together with the 28 strains evaluated as part of the Limit of
Detection Study, a total of 136 strains were evaluated for analytical inclusivity to RP
Flex through wet testing.

The organisms in the inclusivity panel were prepared in Simulated NPS. Thirteen (13)
strains of Influenza A (subtypes H2N2, H2N3, H5N1, H5N3, H7N2, H7N7, H7N9,
H9N2 & H10N7) were prepared and tested at a BSL 3 laboratory. Each sample was
tested with the RP Flex in triplicate at an initial concentration 3-fold higher than the LoD
determined for each analyte. In cases where the expected targets were not detected in
one or more replicates, concentrations at a 3-fold higher level were evaluated.
RP Flex demonstrated analytical reactivity to all 108 strains tested, with some strains
requiring higher titers for detection. The individual strains and concentrations at which
positive test results were obtained for all three replicates are presented by target
organism in Table 20 though Table 28 below.

*Based on in silico analysis, the oligonucleotide identities of all the tested Adenovirus C subtypes have very similar
ranges. Based on the investigation of viral stocks titers using a quantitative TaqMan real-time PCR developed at
Nanosphere that is specific for all Adenovirus species (note: the primers for the TaqMan assay are not the same primers
used in the RP Flex), it appears that the amplifiable genome equivalents available in these two adenovirus viral stocks are
significantly reduced comparing to that of the other adenovirus stocks tested in the study.

*For Parainfluenza 3, the extracted eluate from the three strains tested in the inclusivity study were each evaluated with
PCR/bi-directional sequencing, and the sequence information were used to assess the homology to the RP Flex oligos.
Based on the in silico analysis, the three strains have the identical homology to the RP Flex oligos, indicating that the
apparent difference in sensitivity was not due to sequence diversity in the gene targeted by the RP Flex. The apparent
variation in the sensitivity of the RP Flex test for these strains is likely attributable to inconsistencies in the quantification
of the viral stocks.

*As there is no susceptible cell line to grow Rhinovirus C, the strains were cloned into a plasmid vector and transfected
into WisL cells (primary human lung fibroblasts). All were sequenced to confirm identity. The titers were established by
qPCR using serial dilutions of Rhinovirus 16 as a surrogate to provide actual PFU/mL values for the standard curve.
Therefore, it has been assumed that Rhinovirus 16 has similar virulence rates to Rhinovirus C.

Supplemental Adenovirus Reactivity Information (in silico analyses):
In silico analysis predicts that the RP Flex will detect Adenovirus species G as the oligo
sequence match to the target sequence for Adenovirus G is identical to that for
Adenovirus A.
f. Analytical Specificity/Cross-reactivity Evaluation:
An analytical specificity study was carried out to assess the potential for false positive
results due to cross-reactivity between RP Flex assays and in-panel or non-panel
bacterial, viral, and fungal organisms known or expected to be present in the upper
respiratory system and that may be present in NPS.
The RP Flex analytical specificity study assessed the performance of the RP Flex against
organisms using contrived and clinical samples of strains that are:
1) Phylogenetically-related to RP Flex target organisms,
2) Clinically relevant (colonize the upper respiratory tract or cause respiratory
symptoms),
3) Common skin flora or laboratory contaminants, or
4) Microorganisms with which much of the human population may have been
infected (e.g. Herpes Simplex Virus), and
5) In-panel organisms (tested for cross-reactivity to other RP Flex targets).
The viral and bacterial samples were contrived in Simulated NPS at high concentrations
(1.00E+05 TCID /mL for viral targets and at 1.00E+06 CFU/mL for bacterial and
50
fungal targets, except for Mumps virus which was tested at the highest available
concentration of 1.60E+04 TCID /mL). Four (4) organisms which were not available as

titered stocks were evaluated using genomic DNA at 1.00E+06 copies/mL. All samples
were tested in triplicate with the RP Flex.
A total of 107 organisms were tested at high titer for analytical specificity
(exclusivity), including 46 bacteria/fungi (Table 29), 26 viruses (Table 30), 22 in-panel
organisms from the LoD Study, and 13 additional influenza A virus strains with other
hemagglutinin (HA) types (Table 31).
Any RP Flex positive result with an exclusivity panel organism was tested
additional six times to further assess any potential reactivity with the RP Flex
probes. Additionally, it was anticipated based on feasibility studies that some
Enterovirus strains may cross-react with Rhinovirus probes, and in cases of cross-
reactivity lower concentrations were assessed.

a Prepared and tested at a BSL 3 laboratory.
The 46 bacteria or fungi strains (as listed in Table 29 above) tested for analytical
specificity on the RP Flex all returned “Not Detected” results at the concentrations
tested, with the exception of Pneumocystis jirovecii (from a clinical sample), which gave
“Rhinovirus detected” results in all three replicates.
In silico analysis determined that Pneumocystis jirovecii sequences have a maximum
Oligo Identity to RP Flex targets of 67% and therefore Pneumocystis jirovecii was not
predicted to be cross-reactive to RP Flex Rhinovirus probes. This suggests that the
clinical sample may have been contaminated by Rhinovirus which is a common
organism in clinical samples. Additional testing was performed using two other
Pneumocystis jirovecii positive clinical samples obtained from the same source. Test
results with these samples showed Rhinovirus in 1/3 and 3/3 replicates, respectively. To
investigate the Pneumocystis jirovecii clinical samples for potential contamination,
extracted nucleic acids from all seven Rhinovirus positive tests were evaluated with an
analytically validated PCR/BDS Rhinovirus assay. PCR/ BDS test results confirmed the
presence of Rhinovirus in all seven samples.

The RP Flex results for the representative serotypes from Enterovirus A, B, C and D (a
total of 15 strains listed in Table 30 above) are shown in Table 32 below. All
Enterovirus A and B serotypes tested were exclusive to all RP Flex targets, with no cross
reactivity observed at the concentrations tested. However, for three of the four
Enterovirus C serotypes (Coxsackievirus A24, Poliovirus 2, and Poliovirus 3) tested at
high titer, there was reported false detection of Rhinovirus. To further characterize the
cross-reactivity, additional tests with these strains were performed at a lower titer. The
test results indicated that, Poliovirus 2, which was detected in 2 of 3 replicates at high
titer (1.00E+05 TCID /mL) was not detected at a 3x lower concentration (3.33E+04
50
TCID /mL). With Coxsackievirus A24 and Poliovirus 3, cross-reactivity with
50
Rhinovirus was detected in all three replicates at 9x (8.10E+02 TCID /mL) or 27x
50
(2.43E+03 TCID /mL) the RP Flex Rhinovirus LoD (9.00E+01 TCID /mL). RP Flex
50 50
tests of Enterovirus 68 at high titer reported cross-reactivity with Rhinovirus in 2/3 tests.
Additional testing at 3x lower titer of 3.33E+04 TCID /mL, did not detect Rhinovirus in
50
any of the three replicates.

Based on in silico analyses, a number of Enterovirus strains have a relatively high
homology to RP Flex Rhinovirus oligos, with percent identities to Rhinovirus RP Flex
oligos of up to 84%. As a result, occasional cross- reactivity at high titer was expected.

The observed cross-reactivity of the RP Flex Rhinovirus oligos to select strains
of Enterovirus and the potential cross-reactivity of the RP Flex Rhinovirus oligos
to other strains of Enterovirus based on in silico analyses are indicated as a
limitation in the product package insert: “Due to the genetic similarity between
human Rhinovirus and Enterovirus, some strains of Enterovirus may be detected
as Rhinovirus. Cross-reactivity with Human poliovirus 2, Human poliovirus 3,
Enterovirus D68, and Coxsackievirus A24 was demonstrated through empirical
testing.”
Eleven (11) additional viruses (listed in Table 30 above) were also tested at high titer
for exclusivity to the RP Flex. All were negative for RP Flex targets. A summary of
these test results are presented in Table 34 below.

other than A/H1 and A/H3 (listed in Table 31 above) were tested in triplicate at
1.00E+05 TCID /mL for the viral targets and at 1.00E+06 CFU/mL for the bacterial and
50
fungal targets. All strains listed in Table 31 generated the expected results for the high
titer organisms in all replicates. Additionally, there were no false positive results
generated at the concentrations tested.
g. Assay cut-off:
The presence or absence of each target analyte is determined by the mean intensity of
target capture spots relative to the Signal Detection Threshold. The forward and reverse
PCR primer oligonucleotides as well as the capture and mediator oligonucleotides in the
RP Flex test are designed to eliminate sequence-related cross-reactivity, thereby
ensuring that the non-specific target signal intensities at capture spots are similar to the
microarray background signal. By contrast, target amplicon hybridization to
complementary capture and mediator probes are expected to give signals that are well-
separated from negative capture spots.
After completion of the RP Flex hybridization step, the microarray is placed into the
Verigene Reader where a camera detects light scattered from the different analyte-
specific capture oligo spots. Each target capture is represented by a total of six replicate
spots on the RP Flex microarray and the average intensity from these spots is used in the
analysis. Multiple images of each array are taken at increasing exposures times and the
final target group mean intensity value for an analyte is assigned at the shortest exposure
at which the intensity exceeds the Signal Detection Threshold. If none of the target
signal exceeds the threshold for any exposure, the mean spot intensity is evaluated at the
longest exposure taken. With this imaging and analysis design, a signal detection
threshold of 30,000 was established to generate a Detected call for the 15 viral target
spot groups, three bacterial target spot groups, as well as two assay controls within the
RP Flex (see Table 35 below).

In order to demonstrate the appropriateness of the cut-off value of the RP Flex, a Cut-
off Verification study utilizing image analysis data from the RP Flex LoD Study was
conducted. Specifically the target mean intensity values from the final 20 confirmatory
tests at the limit of detection for the 28 strains contrived in simulated NPS media and
evaluated while fresh were used for this study. With replicates of 20 for each of the 28
samples and 20 unique target spot groups evaluated per test, a total of 11200 data points
were assessed in this Cut-off Verification study. Of these, 1860 data points were
expected to be positive. However, since the dataset is at the established strain LoD and
some samples were detected in 19/20 replicates and these were expected to provide
false negative results.
A logistic fit plot of Expected RP Flex Results by observed Target Mean
Intensity is shown in Figure 1 for all of the target groups on the RP Flex panel.
The signal detection threshold is represented by the vertical red line in the figure.
It is evident that the positive signals are well separated from the negative target
signals, and that the threshold value clearly distinguishes the “True Positives”
(●) from the “True Negatives” (●). As presented in Table 36 below, with this
threshold there were 1844 True Positives, 9340 True Negatives, no discrepant
false-positive result and 16 false negative results.

Thirteen (13) of the 16 False Negatives were expected given the LoD confirmatory
testing results of 19/20 at the sample/target LoD. It is notable that the signal intensity in
these cases is similar to the signals for the expected negative target spots (lower left
corner of Figure 1). This suggests that the target organism at this low titer did not have
significant amplification during the RT-PCR process.
Two (2) of the remaining three false negative results were for Adenovirus C capture
targets with Adenovirus 4 (E) sample in which the Adenovirus B/E capture was
detected. Both of these cases had relatively high signals (18643 and 27229), just below
the threshold. These two results are readily observed in Figure 1. Note that for an

Adenovirus Detected call, detection at either target spot group is sufficient, thus a false
negative call is not generated in these cases.
The final false negative result occurred with the Extraction Control target with Influenza
B sample. Since the Influenza B target was detected, the extraction control result did
not impact the expected target call.
It is apparent in Figure 1 that the provided Signal Detection Threshold of 30,000
should be appropriate to make a reliable ‘Detected’ or ‘Not Detected’ decision. The
threshold is able to clearly identify the targets that have been amplified in the assay
and is well separated from the background or negative target signals.
h. Interfering Substances:
An analytical study was performed to assess the potential inhibitory effects of
exogenous and endogenous substances that may be commonly found in nasopharyngeal
specimens (NPS). Three RP Flex target organisms − one DNA virus (Adenovirus), one
RNA virus (Influenza A), and one gram-negative bacterium (Bordetella pertussis) −
were individually challenged with various exogenous substances at medically-relevant
“worst-case” concentrations. The selected organisms for testing in this study and the
concentrations tested are listed in Table 37 below.

On the day of RP Flex testing, the three representative organisms were prepared to a
concentration of 3x LoD in the interfering substance samples. A control containing no
interfering substance was also prepared and tested for each target organism. Aliquots of
each sample were tested in triplicate with the RP Flex. Additionally, all potential
interferents were tested in triplicate without RP Flex target organisms as negative
controls. No false positive was observed for the negative controls, except for the
MedImmune FluMist® Influenza Vaccine Live, Intranasal Spray (2011-2012 Formula).

The FluMist® Influenza Vaccine Live was obtained from ATCC and further tested in a
serial dilution range from 0.2% – 0.000002% in Simulated NPS. Positive results were
obtained in at least one replicate for Influenza A, Influenza A/H1, and Influenza A/H3
down to 0.02% dilution. Similarly, Influenza B was detected down to a dilution of
0.002%.
The observed reactivity to the FluMist® Vaccine is indicated as a limitation in the
product package insert which states: “Recent vaccination with the intranasal influenza
vaccine may produce false positive results for Influenza A and/or Influenza B”.
None of the substances or microorganisms at the concentrations tested in this study
showed any inhibitory effect on the detection of target respiratory pathogens using the
RP Flex.
i. Competitive Interference Study:
In order to assess competitive inhibition in the RP Flex test, binary combinations of 14
organisms, representing the 16 RP Flex targets, were evaluated as presented in Table 40
below. The samples were prepared in Simulated NPS, with one panel member organism
at a high titer and a second organism at a low titer representing all possible dual
infections. High-positive titer strains were tested at 1.00E+05 TCID /mL for viruses
50
and 1.00E+06 CFU/mL for bacteria, while low-positive titer strains were tested at 3x
LoD. A total of 182 unique combinations of high positive/low positive titer samples
were prepared, and each was tested in triplicate in RP Flex.

The results of the Competitive Interference testing are summarized in Table 41
below. The expected targets of the organisms present at a high titer were
detected in all of the 182 unique combinations (14 × 13) tested. For the low titer
organisms, there were 10 cases in which a false negative result was obtained in
one of the three replicates.
To further evaluate the cases in which the low titer organism was detected only in two
of the three replicates, an additional six RP Flex tests per combination were performed.
In all of the additional tests both the low and high titer analytes were accurately
detected in all six replicate tests. Thus, the initial false negative results are likely
reflective of the low titer (3x LoD) and not of systemic competitive inhibition in the RP
Flex.

j. Carry-Over Contamination:
The RP Flex is designed such that all of the sample contact components for the test
are single-use consumables that minimize the risk for carryover or cross-
contamination. An analytical study was performed to assess potential carryover or
cross-contamination in the RP Flex by alternately testing high positive and negative
samples on the Verigene System. The high positive samples consisted of three
respiratory pathogens, representing the three major types of panel analytes: a DNA
virus (Adenovirus), an RNA virus (Influenza A), and a gram negative bacterium
(Bordetella pertussis). Each strain was prepared in Simulated NPS at a high positive
titer, 1.00E+05 TCID /mL for viral targets, and 1.00E+06 CFU/mL for bacterial
50
targets. Specific strain information and the expected RP Flex results are shown in
Table 42 below.

All of the negative samples yielded “Not Detected” calls for all the analytes, with the
exception of three tests that returned an initial “No Call” result (Influenza A Run 4,
SP5; Influenza A Run 8, SP5; Bordetella pertussis Run 10, SP6). For these tests,
analysis of the capture spot intensities showed no elevated signal from the previously
run high positive samples and the “No Call” was not attributable to a carryover event.
For each “No Call” result, an additional test of the high titer sample and negative
sample were performed. In all cases, the high positive samples yielded the expected
“Detected” results and the subsequent negative samples returned “Not Detected”
results. These results confirm that there is no evidence of carryover from samples tested
with the RP Flex in this study.
During the study, a single false positive result was observed with a high positive B.
pertussis sample. In addition to the correct calls for Bordetella
parapertussis/bronchiseptica and B. pertussis, the test also detected Influenza B.
Evaluation of the eluted material from this sample with PCR/Bi- directional Sequencing
did not identify the presence of Influenza B. Influenza B was not one of the organisms
being tested as part of this study. This suggests that the observation of the false positive
result is not an indication of cross-contamination from samples or reagents across the
SP systems in use during this study. Although the Verigene System and the RP Flex
consumables have been designed to minimize nucleic acid contamination both from
genomic and amplicon-based sources, the source of the Influenza B false positive was
most likely due to sample contamination from the laboratory environment.

k. Comparator Assays Analytical Validation Studies
In the prospective clinical study for the Verigene RP Flex, the RP Flex results were
compared to the results of an FDA-cleared multiplexed respiratory pathogens panel
performed by eight of the nine comparator testing sites for the majority of the RP Flex
analytes (Adenovirus, Influenza A, Influenza B, Influenza A/H1 and A/H3 subtypes,
Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, and 4, Human Metapneumovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus,
Rhinovirus, and Bordetella pertussis). The remaining RP Flex analytes (Bordetella
holmesii and Bordetella parapertussis/bronchiseptica) required two analytically
validated PCR followed by bi-directional sequencing (PCR/BDS) comparator assays
which were tested using the residual nucleic acids samples extracted from the NPS
specimens by the Verigene RP Flex at one dedicated PCR/Sequencing comparator
testing site. Since the FDA-cleared multiplex respiratory pathogen panel comparator
reports a general RSV result without distinguishing RSV A from RSV B, following a
positive result for RSV on the FDA-cleared comparator, residual nucleic acid samples
extracted from the NPS specimens by the Verigene RP Flex were sent for RSV
subtyping by an analytically validated PCR/BDS assay. In addition, due to the fact that
the FDA-cleared multiplexed respiratory pathogen panel comparator reports a
Rhinovirus/Enterovirus result without disguising Rhinovirus from Enterovirus,
following a positive result for Rhinovirus/Enterovirus on the FDA-cleared comparator,
residual nucleic acid samples extracted from the NPS specimens by the Verigene RP
Flex were sent for confirmation of Rhinovirus by two analytically validated PCR/BDS
assays.

Bordetella parapertussis/bronchiseptica 2 PCR/BDS tests on extracted samples
RSV A and B 1 PCR/BDS test on extracted samples
Rhinovirus 2 PCR/BDS tests on extracted samples
These analytically validated PCR/BDS assays have different primer/probe sequences
from those used in the RP Flex. In some cases, the PCR/BDS amplicon overlaps with
the RP Flex assay amplicon due to design limitations (availability of conserved regions).
However, none of the PCR/BDS primers are designed to overlap with any of the RP Flex
assay primers/probes (Table 45 below). This eliminates the possibility that the PCR/BDS
amplicon is derived from the RP Flex assay amplicon.

Validation studies included analytical sensitivity (LoD) study and analytical reactivity
study. The results of these validation studies demonstrated that the analytical sensitivity
and reactivity of the PCR/BDS comparators are either equivalent or better comparing to
that of the RP Flex.
l. Specimen Stability Study
An analytical study was carried out to support the RP Flex stability claim for clinical
specimens preserved in viral transport media (VTM), and to demonstrate the long-term
stability of frozen banked clinical samples (retrospective samples) that were used to
supplement the prospective clinical study data.
A total of fourteen viral and bacterial strains in pooled negative natural clinical NPS
were evaluated in this study. These strains are representative of all of the sixteen RP
Flex targets and were also part of the LoD study. Each strain was prepared at Low
Positive (2xLoD) and Moderate Positive (5xLoD) concentrations in pooled negative
natural clinical NPS collected in VTM.
Initial testing was performed to establish the baseline time point (t = 0) for the study,
and additional aliquots of the samples were stored at each of the following temperature
conditions: (1) 20-25°C, (2) 2-8°C, and (3) Frozen (≤-70°C).
At the designated time points, shown in Table 46 below, one aliquot of each strain at
each concentration was tested with the RP Flex in replicates of three. The 2-8°C and 20-
25°C samples were tested immediately, while the frozen aliquots were thawed at room
temperature for 10-30 minutes prior to testing.

Prospective Clinical Studies
The clinical performance of the RP Flex was evaluated during prospective studies at a
total of five geographically separated U.S. testing sites. The study sites were located in
the Midwest (Milwaukee, WI and Indianapolis, IN), the Mid-Atlantic (Baltimore, MD),
the Northeast (Liverpool, NY), and the Southwest (Albuquerque, NM). Each study
location was representative of the intended use setting (clinical laboratories) and testing
was performed by trained clinical laboratory personnel.
Fresh Prospective Specimens (All-comers)
Fresh (never frozen) nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens in viral transport media
(VTM) that were prospectively collected at the respective clinical sites were tested at the
five U.S. testing sites (Site 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) during July 2014 thru November 2014.
Additional fresh (never frozen) NP swab samples in VTM that were prospectively
collected from two additional specimen collection sites (one in Mexico and the other one
in the Midwest part of the U.S.) were also prospectively tested at two of the five testing
sites (Site 2 and 5) during July 2014 thru November 2014. Prospective clinical studies
testing fresh NPS specimens in viral transport media (VTM) were also conducted at two
of the five testing sites (Site 1 and 4) during February 2015 thru March 2015.
Most of the fresh prospective specimens tested in these studies were de-identified and
enrolled from residual specimens collected from individuals presenting with signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection at the testing sites. These clinical specimens were de-
identified during enrollment by the testing sites and assigned a unique study
identification number. In some cases, a third-party collection site labeled residual fresh
prospective clinical specimens with an external unique de-identification number and
shipped at 4°C overnight to testing sites, who then assigned a unique study identification
number for enrollment.
50

--- Page 51 ---
Fresh specimens were residual, de-identified and consisting of ≥ 1.5 mL NPS specimen
collected in VTM. Specimens were aliquoted in accordance with the study protocol.
One aliquot was used for Verigene RP Flex testing at the test sites. If RP Flex testing
was not performed immediately, the sample was stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours
before testing. Another aliquot was immediately stored at ≤ -70°C and subsequently
shipped overnight on dry ice, to a third-party reference laboratory for comparator testing
using an FDA-cleared multiplexed respiratory pathogens panel.
Frozen Archived Prospective Specimens (All-comers)
In addition, archived (previously frozen) NPS specimens in VTM that were
prospectively collected and archived from September 2013 thru March 2014 at one U.S.
clinical reference laboratory in the Midwest (Indianapolis, IN) were randomly
distributed to, enrolled and tested at the same five U.S. testing sites (Site 1, 2, 3, 4, and
5) that tested the fresh prospective samples, from July 2014 thru December 2014.
Frozen specimens (all-comers) were collected at the collection site using an external
unique de-identification number. Samples for this study included all positive and
negative specimens submitted to the laboratory for routine respiratory pathogen testing.
Frozen specimens were residual, de-identified and consisted of ≥ 1.0 mL NPS specimen
collected in VTM. Specimens were stored at ≤ -70°C and shipped frozen to the sponsor.
Prior to sending specimens to the testing sites, the sponsor thawed, de-identified, and
aliquoted the specimens for study use by assigning another unique study identification
number. Specimens were randomized and shipped to the testing sites in accordance with
the site’s availability to receive and test specimens. One aliquot was immediately stored at
≤-70°C and subsequently shipped overnight on dry ice, to a third-party reference
laboratory for comparator testing using an FDA-cleared multiplexed respiratory
pathogens panel. Another aliquot was immediately stored at ≤ -70°C and shipped
overnight on dry ice, to the testing sites for Verigene RP Flex testing.
Verigene RP Flex Testing of All Prospective Specimens
Fresh prospective specimens were tested within 48 hours of collection while frozen
prospective samples were tested within 48 hours of sample thaw at the test sites. If a
specimen test yielded a result of a) No Call or b) Pre-Analysis Error (PAE), the
specimen was re-tested using 200 μL from the remaining sample volume in accordance
with study protocol. If a specimen could not be re-tested within 48 hours of collection, it
was frozen until the repeat test could be performed. At the conclusion of each Verigene
RP Flex test, the residual nucleic acids were collected from the Extraction Tray into a
microcentrifuge tube and stored frozen at ≤-70°C. The tube was shipped overnight on
dry ice to the sponsor and was sent to a third party laboratory for PCR/BDS testing. In
the event that a sample residual nucleic acids in the Extraction Tray was less than 50 μL
(insufficient volume for required PCR/BDS testing), repeat RP Flex testing was
performed to generate additional volume of nucleic acids. However, the first RP Flex
test was used as the test of record for all performance calculations.
51

Fresh and Frozen Prospective Specimens Comparator Method Testing
For all fresh and frozen prospective specimens, comparator testing was performed at one
of the eight comparator testing sites that are different from the five RP Flex test sites. An
FDA-cleared multiplexed respiratory pathogens panel was used as the primary
comparator method for the majority of the targets on the RP Flex panel (i.e.,
Adenovirus, Influenza A, Influenza B, Influenza A/H1 and A/H3 subtypes,
Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, and 4, Human Metapneumovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus,
Rhinovirus, and Bordetella pertussis). As the FDA-cleared multiplexed respiratory
pathogens panel does not distinguish RSV types nor Rhinovirus and Enterovirus, the
comparator method for RSV subtypes consisted of the FDA-cleared multiplexed
respiratory pathogens panel followed by an analytically validated polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and bi-directional sequencing (BDS) assay, and the comparator method
for Rhinovirus consisted of the FDA-cleared multiplexed respiratory pathogens panel
followed by a composite of two analytically validated polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
and bi-directional sequencing (BDS) assays. For the targets on the RP Flex panel but not
detected by the FDA-cleared multiplexed respiratory pathogens panel (i.e., Bordetella
parapertussis/bronchiseptica and Bordetella holmesii), a composite of two analytically
validated PCR/BDS assays was used as the comparator method. The PCR/BDS testing
for the prospective clinical studies was performed at an external third-party site.
An overview of the composite algorithm to determine comparator results is listed in
Table 47 below.

Following a detected result for RSV on the FDA-cleared multiplexed respiratory
pathogens panel, samples (i.e., the residual nucleic acids collected from the Verigene
Processor SP Extraction Tray) were sent for PCR/BDS for RSV subtype identification.
Samples that were negative by PCR/BDS were considered negative. The composite
algorithm used to determine the comparator result for RSV is summarized in Table 48
below.

Following a positive result for Rhinovirus/Enterovirus on the FDA-cleared multiplexed
respiratory pathogens panel, samples (i.e., the residual nucleic acids collected from the
Verigene Processor SP Extraction Tray) were sent for confirmation of Rhinovirus by a
composite of two PCR/BDS assays. If the first PCR/BDS assay failed to provide a valid
positive Rhinovirus or Enterovirus result, a second PCR/BDS assay targeting a different
region of the viral genome was performed. The result of the second PCR/BDS assay was
used as the final result. Samples were considered positive for Rhinovirus only upon a
positive detection by a PCR/BDS assay. Samples were considered negative for
Rhinovirus with 1) a negative Rhinovirus/Enterovirus result on the FDA-cleared
multiplexed respiratory pathogens panel; 2) negative Rhinovirus results from both
PCR/BDS assays; 3) a positive Enterovirus result from one PCR/BDS assay. The
composite algorithm used to determine the comparator result for Rhinovirus is

approach, samples were considered positive if an analyte was detected by at least one of
the PCR/BDS assays. Samples were considered negative when both the PCR/BDS
assays were negative. The composite algorithm used to determine the comparator result
for Bordetella parapertussis/bronchiseptica and Bordetella holmesii is summarized in

Quality Control Testing
Quality Control testing was performed on each day of RP Flex testing, using a single-use
aliquot of external positive and negative control samples provided by the sponsor.
Control samples were shipped on dry ice to the study testing sites where they were
stored frozen at ≤ -70°C until use. Controls were tested per the RP Flex IUO Package
Insert instructions. If either control yielded a “PAE” or “No Call” test result, a new
aliquot was tested per the study protocol.
Discrepant Result Investigation Testing
Samples for which false positive and/or false negative results (i.e., discrepant result)
were obtained when comparing the Verigene RP Flex result to the comparator method
result were further tested. The discrepant investigation testing was performed using
analytically validated PCR assays followed by BDS to confirm the identity of the
specific target in the discordant sample. The PCR/BDS methods were developed and
validated for the identification and confirmation of the panel analytes on RP Flex with
PCR primers that are different from the RP Flex primers.
Patient Demographics
A total of 2412 prospective specimens (fresh and frozen) were included in the
prospective clinical studies for testing with the RP Flex. The following table (Table 51)
provides a summary of demographic information for the 2412 prospectively collected
specimens (fresh and frozen) that were enrolled in the prospective studies:

Prospective Specimens Accountability
A total of 2412 prospective specimens (1082 fresh and 1330 frozen) were initially
included in the prospective clinical studies for testing with the RP Flex.
Of the 1082 fresh prospective specimens, two specimens were excluded from
performance analyses due to the lack of comparator testing results for all analytes; five
specimens generated a “No Call” result initially by the RP Flex but were not retested per
the product instructions, and were therefore excluded from performance analyses; six
specimens generated a “No Call” result initially and a “No Call” result again upon
retesting by the RP Flex, and were therefore excluded from the performance analyses. A
total of 1069 fresh prospective specimens were included in the performance analyses of
the RP Flex.
Of the 1330 frozen prospective specimens, five specimens were excluded from the
performance analyses due to the lack of comparator testing results for all analytes; three
specimens generated a “No Call” result initially by the RP Flex but were not retested per
the product instructions, and were therefore excluded from performance analyses; one
specimen was excluded from performance analyses due to uncertainty in determining the
correct specimen ID; four specimens generated a “No Call” result initially and a “No
Call” result again upon retesting by the RP Flex, and were therefore excluded from
performance analyses. A total of 1317 frozen prospective specimens were included in
the performance analyses of the RP Flex.
Of the total of 2386 prospective clinical specimens that were included in the
performance analyses of the RP Flex, 189 specimens were excluded from the RP Flex
performance analysis for Adenovirus due to the lack of Adenovirus comparator results;
264 specimens were excluded from the RP Flex performance analysis for Rhinovirus
due to the lack of Rhinovirus comparator results; 193 specimens were excluded from the

Prospective Clinical Studies Mixed Infection Analysis
The RP Flex detected a total of 91 mixed infections in the prospective clinical
evaluations. Eighty-six (86) (86/91; 94.5%) were double infections, four (4/91; 4.4%)
were triple infections, and one (1/91; 1.1%) was quadruple infections. The single most
common co-infection (27/91; 29.7%) was Rhinovirus with Adenovirus, followed by
the second most common co-infection (22/91; 24.2%) of Rhinovirus with RSV B. Out
of the 91 co-infections, 46 contained one or more analytes that had not been detected
with the comparator method(s), i.e. discrepant co-infections.

Retrospective Clinical Study
A retrospective clinical evaluation of the RP Flex was also performed to supplement the
prospective evaluation data. In this study, retrospective pre-selected archived specimens
were further confirmed by the same comparator methods described in the “Prospective
Clinical Studies” section previously. The retrospective pre-selected archived specimens
were randomly distributed to a total of six testing sites in the U.S., the same five testing
sites as described in the “Prospective Clinical Studies” section previously plus one
additional testing site located in the Southeast, and tested with the RP Flex from July
2014 thru March 2015.
Frozen Archived Retrospective Specimens (Selected)
Nanosphere worked with four laboratories in the U.S., one in the Southeast (Atlanta,
GA), one in the Midwest (South Bend, IN), one in the Southwest (Albuquerque, NM),
and one in the Mid-Atlantic (Chapel Hill, NC), to source selected frozen archived
retrospective specimens for analytes with lower prevalence. Frozen specimens were
residual, de-identified and consisting of ≥ 1.0 mL NPS specimens collected in VTM.
Specimens were stored at ≤ -70°C and shipped frozen to the sponsor. Prior to sending
specimens to the study testing sites, the sponsor thawed, split, and de-identified the
specimens for study use by assigning a unique study identification number. Specimens
were randomized and shipped to the testing sites in accordance with the site’s availability to
receive and test specimens. One aliquot was immediately stored at ≤-70°C and
subsequently shipped overnight on dry ice, to a third-party reference laboratory for
comparator testing using an FDA-cleared multiplexed respiratory pathogens panel.
Another aliquot was immediately stored at ≤ -70°C and shipped overnight on dry ice, to
the testing sites for Verigene RP Flex testing. Upon receipt, study testing sites stored the
samples at ≤ -70°C until ready to test.
Verigene RP Flex Testing of Retrospective Specimens
Frozen selected retrospective samples were tested within 48 hours of sample thaw at the
test sites. If a specimen test yielded a result of a) No Call or b) Pre-Analysis Error

(PAE), the specimen was re-tested using 200 μL from the remaining sample volume in
accordance with study protocol. If a specimen could not be re-tested within 48 hours of
collection, it was frozen until the repeat test could be performed. At the conclusion of
each Verigene RP Flex test, the residual nucleic acids were collected from the Extraction
Tray into a microcentrifuge tube and stored frozen at ≤ -70°C. The tube was shipped
overnight on dry ice to the sponsor and was sent to a third party laboratory for PCR/BDS
testing. In the event that a sample residual nucleic acids in the Extraction Tray was less
than 50 μL (insufficient volume for required PCR/BDS testing), repeat RP Flex testing
was performed to generate additional volume of nucleic acids. However, the first RP
Flex test was used as the test of record for all performance calculations.
Frozen Archived Retrospective Specimens (Selected) Comparator Methods Testing
The “Retrospective Selected” specimens consisted of positive specimens (as identified
by the acquisition site) collected and frozen at ≤ -70°C. These specimens were tested
using the same comparator methods described in the “Prospective Clinical Studies”
section previously to confirm the results that were provided to Nanosphere by the
original acquisition sites.
The comparator method(s) results (an FDA-cleared multiplexed respiratory pathogens
panel or PCR/BDS) were compared to the results provided to Nanosphere by the original
acquisition sites. If the expected results agreed, the specimen was enrolled into the study
for Verigene RP Flex testing. If the expected results did not agree, the specimen was not
enrolled into this study. In the event that the specimen was positive by the FDA-cleared
multiplexed respiratory pathogens panel for the expected result and additional target(s)
were detected, the specimen was enrolled as positive for the additional targets as well.
Table 55 shows the number of specimens acquired for each target and the percent for
which the comparator method(s) agreed with the expected results. Fifty three (53)
enrolled specimens were positive for the expected target and at least one additional
target.

Quality Control Testing
Quality Control testing was performed on each day of RP Flex testing, using a single-use
aliquot of external positive and negative control samples provided by the sponsor.
Control samples were shipped on dry ice to the study testing sites where they were
stored frozen at ≤ -70°C until use. Controls were tested per the RP Flex IUO Package
Insert instructions. If either control yielded a “PAE” or “No Call” test result, a new
aliquot was tested per the study protocol.

Mock Clinical Study
Frozen contrived NPS in VTM specimens for three bacteria with very low prevalence in
the prospective clinical studies and for which retrospective natural NPS specimens in
VTM are difficult to acquire were prepared by spiking bacterial strains of known origin
and concentration into unique previously-screened, negative clinical NPS specimens in
VTM. Organisms used in these preparations were obtained from the following sources:
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), BEI Resources, Nationwide Children’s
Hospital (NCH), and Zeptometrix.
A summary of contrived positive clinical specimens included in this study are provided
in Tables 58 - 60. Contrived specimens were blinded and assigned Nanosphere
identification numbers at Nanosphere, shipped to the three testing sites on dry ice and
tested at the study testing sites. The testing sites stored the samples at ≤ -70°C until
ready for Verigene RP Flex testing, at which point the samples were thawed and tested.
To avoid bias, a total of 201 negative NPS specimens were blinded and randomized and
included with the positive spiked samples to be tested by testing sites.

The RP Flex mock clinical study (contrived samples) performance data in positive
percent and negative percent agreements against the expected results (all sites combined)
are presented in the following Table 61 by analyte. One negative contrived sample
generated a “No Call” result initially and a “No Call” result again upon retesting per the
product instructions by the RP Flex, and was therefore excluded from this performance
analysis.

Initial No Call Results and Pre-Analysis Errors (PAE) During Clinical Testing
For the total of 3299 specimens tested with the RP Flex in the clinical trials (i.e., 1082
fresh prospective specimens, 1330 frozen prospective specimens, 526 frozen selected
retrospective specimens, and 361 frozen contrived specimens), there were 152
specimens that had an initial “No Call” result. Therefore, the initial No Call rate was
4.6% (152/3299) (95% CI: 3.9% - 5.4%). Upon repeat testing per the product
instructions, all of the specimens except 15 yielded a valid call, resulting in a final No
Call rate of 0.5% (15/3299) (95% CI: 0.3% - 0.7%).
For a total of 1082 fresh natural specimens, the initial No Call rate was 5.9% (64/1082)
(95% CI: 4.7% - 7.5%), and the final No Call rate upon repeat testing per the product
instructions was 0.6% (6/1082) (95% CI: 0.3% - 1.2%). For the total of 1856 frozen
natural specimens, the initial No Call rate was 4.5% (84/1856) (95% CI: 3.7% - 5.6%),
and the final No Call rate upon repeat testing per the product instructions was 0.4%
(8/1856) (95% CI: 0.2% - 0.8%)
There were a total of 17 PAEs observed during the clinical studies for a PAE failure rate
of 0.5% (17/3299) (95% CI: 0.3% - 0.8%). Upon repeat testing per the product
instructions, all of the specimens yielded a valid call.

O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Verigene Respiratory Pathogens Flex Nucleic Acid Test (RP Flex) is conducted on
the Verigene System, which is a “sample-to-result”, fully automated, bench-top molecular
diagnostics workstation. The Verigene System consists of two components: the Verigene
Reader and the Verigene Processor SP. A single Verigene Reader may be connected to up
to 32 Processor SP units. Each Processor SP unit can be accessed independently through
the Reader to run different tests. Each test utilizes single-use, disposable test consumables
and a self-contained Verigene Test Cartridge to analyze nucleic acid samples. The RP Flex
test is run on the Verigene System, which incorporates automated nucleic acid extraction,
amplification, and target detection of specific viral and bacterial nucleic acid gene
sequences.

5. Calibration:

6. Quality Control:
The RP Flex microarray contains two sets of oligonucleotide spots that are used as process
controls to check for proper fluid control, extraction, amplification, hybridization and
signal detection. The IC1 (hybridization control) internal processing control probes detect
the presence (hybridization and signal enhancement) of a DNA oligonucleotide and
mediator oligo contained within the Sample Buffer on the Extraction Tray. The IC2
(extraction control) control probes verify the presence of an amplicon for Bacteriophage
MS2, which is added to the sample prior to the nucleic acid extraction step. Both the
internal processing controls IC1 and IC2 must be present for a valid respiratory pathogen
Not Detected call for all targets to be reported. If IC1 or IC2 is Not Detected, a No Call –
INT CTL 1 or a No Call – INT CTL 2 result, respectively, is generated. If both IC1 and
IC2 are Not Detected, a No Call – INT CTL result is generated. The IC2 is not utilized for
the detection of positive samples. The IC1 is required for the detection of positive
samples.
A set of regions on microarray which do not contain capture oligonucleotides is used as a
control for background signal levels. If the signal in these background regions is too high,
a No Call - BKGD is generated. Additionally, negative control oligomer spots are included
on the array to ensure the hybridization stringency was sufficient. If the negative control
signal is too high a No Call – NEG CTL is generated.
Each capture probe has six separate oligonucleotide spots on the microarray in six
different areas. Mathematical algorithms, called spot filters, compare the array spot signals
for a particular target as a set. Any individual spot signal in the target set that are
determined to be outliers are discarded. After applying the spot filters, the probe set must
include four or more capture spots for a Call decision to be made for a target.
Additionally, the coefficient of variation of spot intensities in the set must be less than or
equal to 70%. If these requirements are not met a No Call - VARIATION results. The spot
signal comparison algorithms protect against some hybridization failures and also against
