The sponsor has the following caution statement in their labeling: “While each human serum
or plasma donor unit used in the manufacture of this product was tested by FDA-approved
methods and found nonreactive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis
C (HCV), and antibody to HIV-1/2, all products manufactured using human source material
should be handled as potentially infectious. Because no test method can offer complete
assurance that hepatitis B or C viruses, HIV, or other infectious agents are absent, these
products should be handled according to established good laboratory practices.”

Value Assignment
Value assignment for the ADVIA Centaur FSH MCM was based on using assigned
reference calibrators and MCMs. The assigned reference calibrators were prepared
using follicle-stimulating hormone stock and are traceable to internal material, which
is standardized against World Health Organization (WHO) 2nd International Standard
for human FSH (IS94/632) reference material. The MCMs are manufactured using
qualified materials and measurement procedures. MCM1 was run in 5 replicates on
two separate runs using one reagent lot kit on one ADVIA Centaur system. MCM2-8
were tested on 20 replicates (comprised of 1 run with 4 sample cups run in 5
replicates) on 1 ADVIA Centaur system, using 1 reagent kit lot. The lot-specific
assigned ranges are the lot-specific customer ranges established per the sponsor’s
internal procedural specifications for FSH MCM. MCM1 is assigned a 0.0 dose.
MCM8 targeted greater than the assay range is diluted with MCM1 to meet the
reportable range of the assay. The target values and target ranges for the customer are
provided in the ADVIA Centaur FSH Master Curve Material lot-specific value card.

Value assignment for the ADVIA Centaur FT4 MCM was based on using assigned
reference calibrators and MCMs. The assigned reference calibrators were prepared
using United States Pharmacopeia (USP) T4 stock and are traceable to USP internal
material. The MCMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement
procedures. MCM1 was run in 5 replicates on two separate runs using one reagent lot
kit on one ADVIA Centaur system. MCM2-7 were tested on 20 replicates (comprised

Stability
Shelf-life and open vial stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for the
ADVIA Centaur FSH MCM were described and found to be adequate. The real time
stability study results support the shelf life claim of 6 months when stored unopened
at 2-8°C. Open vial (reconstituted) stability studies support the sponsor’s open vial
claim of 28 days when properly stored at 2-8°C, or on board the ADVIA Centaur
system for 4 hours at room temperature.
Shelf-life and open Vial Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for the
ADVIA Centaur FT4 MCM were described and found to be adequate. The real time
stability study results support the shelf life claim of 6 months when stored unopened
at 2-8°C. Open vial (reconstituted) stability studies support the sponsor’s open vial
claim of 14 days when properly stored at 2-8°C, or on board the ADVIA Centaur
system for 4 hours at room temperature.
Shelf-life stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for the ADVIA Centaur
T4 MCM were described and found to be adequate. The real time stability study
results support the shelf life claim of 10 months when stored unopened at 2-8°C.
There is no open vial claim for the T4 MCM because materials are intended to be
used only once when opened.
Shelf-life and open vial stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for the
