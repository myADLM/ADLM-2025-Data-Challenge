L. Test Principle:
The QUANTA Flash® CCP3 assay is a microparticle chemiluminescent immunoassay
designed for use on the BIO-FLASH instrument. The instrument platform is a fully
automated closed system with continuous load and random access capabilities that
automatically processes the samples, runs the assay and reports the results. It includes liquid
handling hardware, luminometer and computer with software-user interface. The QUANTA
Flash® CCP3 assay utilizes a reagent cartridge format, which is compatible with the BIO-
FLASH instrument.
Synthetic cyclic citrullinated peptide is coated onto paramagnetic beads. The bead
suspension is lyophilized and stored in the bead tube. Prior to use in the BIO-FLASH
system, the sealed reagent tubes are pierced with the reagent cartridge lid and the beads are
rehydrated and resuspended using resuspension buffer by pipetting up and down with a
transfer pipette. The reagent cartridge is then loaded onto the BIO-FLASH instrument.
Samples are also loaded onto the instrument in sample racks. A patient serum sample is
prediluted by the BIO-FLASH with system rinse in a small disposable plastic cuvette. Small
amounts of the diluted patient serum, the beads, and assay buffer are all combined into a
second cuvette, and mixed. This cuvette is then incubated at 37°C. The beads are magnetized
and washed several times. Isoluminol conjugated anti-human IgG antibodies are then added
to the cuvette, and again incubated at 37°C. The beads are magnetized and washed
repeatedly. The isoluminol conjugate is oxidized when Trigger 1 (Fe(III) coproporphyrin in
sodium hydroxide solution) and Trigger 2 (urea-hydrogen peroxide in sodium chloride
solution) are added to the cuvette, and the flash of light produced from this reaction is
measured as Relative Light Units (RLU) by the BIO-FLASH optical system. The RLU are
proportional to the amount of isoluminol conjugate that is bound to the human IgG, which is
in turn proportional to the amount of anti-CCP3 antibodies bound to the corresponding beads.
For quantitation, the QUANTA Flash® CCP3 assay utilizes a predefined lot specific Master
Curve that is uploaded onto the instrument through the reagent cartridge barcode. Every new
lot number of reagent cartridge must be calibrated before first use, with the QUANTA
Flash® CCP3 Calibrators. Based on the results obtained with the two Calibrators included in
the Calibrator Set (sold separately), an instrument specific Working Curve is created, which
is used to calculate chemiluminescent units (CU) from the instrument signal (RLU) obtained
for each sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision: The precision of the QUANTA Flash® CCP3 assay was evaluated by
testing eight serum samples containing various concentrations of anti-CCP3 antibody.
Each sample was run in duplicate, twice a day, for 20 days with one reagent lot (total
of 80 replicates per sample). All %CV values were within the sponsor’s pre-

Reproducibility: A total of eight samples were tested at three sites with one reagent
lot to evaluate site-to-site reproducibility. Three samples were run in quadruplicate,
twice a day, for five days, to generate 40 data points for each sample at each site. An
additional five samples were tested in replicates of five, once a day, for five days, to
generate 25 data points for each sample at each site. Data were analyzed for within-
run, between-run, between site and total precision. The results are summarized in the
table below. All %CV values were within the sponsor’s pre-determined acceptance

To evaluate lot-to-lot reproducibility, five samples with anti-CCP3 antibody
concentration at various levels across the measuring range (16.2, 24.9, 77.5, 341.1,
and 1528.7 CU) were tested. Each sample was tested in replicates of five, one run per
day for five days using three difference reagent lots. Mean and %CV for each sample
were calculated and %CV values were from 2.8% to 4.0% for all samples.

highest points on the master curve (4.6–2776. 8 CU). The linearity across this range
was evaluated by a study according to CLSI EP6-A. Serially diluted samples with
CCP3 concentrations ranging from 3.5 to 3164.9 CU were prepared by diluting each
of five high positive serum samples with negative serum in 10% increments. Each
dilution was tested in duplicate. Percentage recovery of obtained mean results was
calculated compared to the expected results and the linear regression analysis was
performed using the samples falling within the master curve. The results are
summarized as follows:

Auto-rerun: To validate the auto-rerun function with 1:20 dilution, four high positive
specimens with anti-CCP3 antibody concentration above the assay measuring range
(7401.5, 3641.7, 6391.1, and 7859.8 CU) were run with the auto-rerun function
enabled on the BIO-FLASH. The same set of samples prepared manually with 1:20
fold dilution was used as reference and tested with the concentration of 7192.9,
3953.1, 6325.1, and 7694.9 CU, respectively. The % recovery values for results
obtained with the auto-rerun results compared to results with manual dilution were
between 97% and 109%.
Hook effect: The same set of four high positive samples used in the validation study
for auto-rerun function and having anti-CCP3 antibody concentration above assay
measuring range was examined to assess hook effect. No hook effect was observed
up to 7695 CU.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: There is no recognized standard or reference material for anti-CCP3
antibodies.
Value assignment: The QUANTA Flash® CCP3 Calibrators and Controls are
manufactured by diluting human serum that contains high titer of anti-CCP3
antibodies with stabilizer and preservative. The target CU is achieved through trial

dilutions on small scale. Once a dilution is selected, the Calibrators and Controls are
bulked, tested, and adjusted. Upon completion of the manufacturing process, the
Calibrators and Controls are tested on at least two instruments, on at least two lots of
reagent cartridge, in replicates of 10 to determine final value assignment. The target
values and ranges for the Calibrators and Controls are listed below:
Target Value Target Range

Calibrator 2 300 270–330
QUANTA Flash® CCP3 Controls
Negative control 10 8–12
Positive control 50 40–60
Stability:
Kit stability (unopened): The accelerated stability study was performed using three
lots of CCP3 coupled beads, calibrators and controls. Real-time stability is on-going.
The results to date support a claim of 12 months stability for unopened kit, calibrators
and controls stored at 2–8°C.
On-board (In-use) stability: On-board stability study was performed for calibrators,
controls and reagent cartridge:
i. Calibrators: Calibrators were placed uncapped on the instrument, and
calibration was performed five times over 8.5 hours. Controls and a panel of
characterized patient specimens were run on each calibration curve. Each
calibrator is measured in triplicate during calibration.
ii. Controls: Two vials of each control were assayed twice a day for a total of 20
runs. The first run was used to establish baseline value, and then an additional
19 runs were performed. During runs, the Controls were left uncapped
onboard the instrument for 15 minutes per run. When not in use, the controls
were capped, and stored at 5ºC±3°C.
iii. Reagent Cartridge: Three lots of cartridges were tested with six serum
specimens (with different reactivity levels) along with the Negative and
Positive Controls. The specimens were tested periodically up to 90 days.
Percent recoveries were calculated compared to the day zero average values,
and linear regression analysis was performed by plotting percent (%) recovery
against the number of days.

All results met the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria and support the following
stability claim:
Calibrators 8 hours on-board; up to 4 calibrations.
Controls up to 15 uses with 10 min on-board per use
Reagent Cartridge 60 days on-board
Sample stability: the study was performed with six samples (two negatives, two
positives, and two around the cut-off) tested at 2–8°C and room temperature (RT). In
addition, the samples were tested for the stability after repeated freeze/thaw cycles up
to three cycles. The results support sample stability up to 48 hours of storage at RT,
up to 21 days of storage at 2–8°C, and up to three freeze/thaw cycles when samples
are stored at or below -20°C.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying four blank samples in five
replicates per sample over three days with two reagent lots. Sixty data points per lot
were generated. LoB for each lot was calculated separately at the 95th percentile
using the non-parametric method, as the dataset showed non-normal distribution. The
LoB for two lots was determined to be 410 RLU and 341 RLU. The claimed LoB
value is 410 RLU.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by assaying four samples with low
level anti-CCP3 antibody concentration. Each sample was tested in five replicates
over three days on two reagent lots. LoD value was calculated as the LoB + 1.645 x
SD of the replicates for the low level samples. The LoD of the QUANTA Flash®
CCP3 assay for the two lots were determined to be 465 and 478 RLU, which are
below the value of the lowest QUANTA Flash® CCP3 Master Curve standard (1600
CU), and therefore below the lower limit of the Analytical Measuring Range of the
assay. The claimed LoD is 478 RLU.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interference: Three serum samples with antibody concentration at 10.1
CU (negative), 40.5 CU (low positive), and 939.8 CU (high positive) were spiked
separately with endogenous interferents. The control samples were prepared for each
interfering substance by spiking with the same volume of diluents. Each sample was
tested in triplicates and the recovery was calculated by comparing to corresponding
control sample. The interferents tested were: bilirubin (10, 5.0 or 2.5 mg/dL),
hemoglobin (200, 100, or 50 mg/dL), and triglycerides/cholesterol (1000/224,
500/112 or 250/56 mg/dL). No interference (<15%) was detected in the samples up
to the concentrations listed in the table below:

Substances Concentration % Recovery
Bilirubin 10 mg/dL 101–102%
Hemoglobin 200 mg/dL 97–108%
Triglycerides 1000 mg/dL 98–111%
Cholesterol 224 mg/dL 98–111%
Analytical cross-reactivity: The reference reagent for citrullinated peptide/protein
antibodies (ACPA) (P/N IS2723 L/N 08-0202) from the Center of Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) has been tested and showed a concentration of 379.5 CU.
Twelve ANA human reference sera from CDC were also tested for the cross
reactivity of the QUANTA Flash® CCP3. The sera of CDC9 (human antibodies to
Scl-70) showed a concentration of 7.2 CU, and all other reference sera in the panel
showed the test results below the lower limit of the measuring range, 4.6 CU.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off was determined by testing samples from reference population of
210 subjects (170 apparently healthy blood donors and 40 other control disease
samples). The cut-off was established as 20 CU based on the 99th percentile of the
results obtained.
Positive Negative
QUANTA Flash® CCP3 ≥20 CU <20 CU
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Samples for method comparison analysis included 728 samples from the clinical
validation study. All these samples were tested on both the QUANTA Flash® CCP3
and the predicate. From the total sample size of 728, results for 420 samples were
within the measuring ranges of the assays. The analysis of the results comparing the
QUANTA Flash® CCP3 to the predicate is summarized below:
