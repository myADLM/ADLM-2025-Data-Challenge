H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Wondfo One Step HCG Urine Pregnancy Test Strip is a rapid chromatographic
immunoassay for the qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in
urine, as an aid in early detection of pregnancy, in some cases as early as five (5) days
before the expected period, i.e., as early as six (6) days before the day of the missed
period.
Important note regarding negative results:
Some pregnant women will not be able to detect hCG in their urine 5 days before the
expected period. If you test negative before your missed period, but think you may still
be pregnant, you should test again a few days after your missed period.
Important note regarding positive results:
Because this test detects low levels of hCG, it is possible that this test may give positive
results even if you are not pregnant. If you test positive, but think you may not be
pregnant, you should check with your doctor.
All results should be confirmed by your healthcare provider, especially when making
decisions about future medical care.
This product is intended for both prescription use and over-the-counter use.

L. Test Principle:
The Wondfo One Step HCG Pregnancy Test (Strip, Cassette, Midstream) is a lateral flow
chromatographic immunoassay. When the absorbent end is immersed into a sample, the
sample is absorbed into the device by capillary action and mixes with the antibody-dye
conjugate (mouse anti-beta HCG monoclonal antibody), flowing across the pre-coated (Goat
anti HCG polyclonal antibody) membrane. During the test, hCG in the urine specimen reacts
with the dye conjugate and forms a complex. The complex migrates along the membrane to
the α-hCG antibody line (T), and remains captured in the T line. As a result, a red colored
band develops in the T line, indicating a positive result. If there is no hCG in the urine, there
is no red band in the test zone, indicating a negative result. The control line should develop
in the Control zone regardless of the result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed using negative human urine samples spiked with
hCG traceable to the 4th WHO international standard to obtain samples with hCG
concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 8.0, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 50 mIU/mL. The urine
samples were measured in 10 replicates per day using 3 different lots for each device
format. Testing was performed for 5 consecutive days by 3 different operators at
each of 3 point-of-care sites for a total of 9 operators. A different set of operators
tested each format. The results are summarized in the following tables:

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference study
To evaluate potential interference from certain exogenous compounds, each
interferent was made at 100X concentrate bulk and spiked into negative urine and
positive urine samples (containing 10 and 100 mIU/mL hCG). Each spiked urine
sample was mixed for 5 minutes to ensure a homogeneous solution before testing.
Each sample was tested using 3 different lots of the testing kit. The interference
studies demonstrated that there was no interference from the highest concentrations of
substances tested for each of the three reagent lots and for each concentration of hCG
tested (negative, 10, and 100 mIU/mL hCG). The results are summarized in the
following table.

Cross reactivity of similar compounds:
Negative and positive urine containing10 mIU/mL hCG were spiked with various
concentrations of the following potential cross reactants: hLH, hFSH, and hTSH. The
samples were tested by three operators with three lots of the strip format device. The
results from spiked samples demonstrated no cross reactivity at the following
concentrations:
Reactant Concentration
hLH 500 mIU/mL
hFSH 1000 mIU/mL
hTSH 1000 µIU/mL
Effects of urine pH:
A study was performed to evaluate the effects of pH on the device. Negative urine
and positive urine (containing10 and 100 mIU/mL hCG) were adjusted to have pH
values of 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0. The negative and positive hCG samples with
the different pH levels were tested on each format of the device. The positive and
negative hCG results were not affected by urine pH levels between the ranges of 4.0
and 9.0.
Effects of urine specific gravity:
A study was performed to evaluate the effects of urine specific gravity on the device.
The device was challenged with negative urine and positive urine (containing10 and
100 mIU/mL hCG) with specific gravities of 1.000, 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025,
1.030, and 1.035. The positive and negative hCG results were not affected by urine
specific gravity concentrations between 1.000 and 1.035.
High dose hook effect study:
Negative urine samples were spiked with hCG at concentrations of ranging from
6,250 mIU/mL to 200,000 mIU/mL. Three lots of the device were tested by 3
different operators. The results demonstrated that no hook effect was observed at
hCG concentrations ranging from 6,250 mIU/mL to 200,000 mIU/mL.
Effects of hCG β-core fragment:
Interference testing was performed to evaluate whether high levels of beta core
fragment interfere with the device. Negative urine hCG and positive urine samples
(containing 10 mIU/mL hCG) were spiked with hCG beta core fragment at

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Urine samples were collected from 300 women at three different physician’s offices
for pregnancy testing. Of the 300 women, 146 of them were suspected to be pregnant.
Samples were randomly collected at various times throughout the day. Ages of these
women ranged from 20 to 45 years. Samples were masked and randomized by people
who labeled the samples but did not participate in the testing. A total of 100 samples
were tested for each format (strip, cassette, and midstream). All samples were tested
by nine different health care professionals at three different physician offices with
proposed and the predicate device. Each person tested three different lots of each
format device at the same time, but not sequentially. For the midstream format, 50
samples were tested by the dip method and the other 50 samples were tested by
simulated stream method. The results are summarized in the tables below:

Detection of hCG in Early Pregnancy Clinical Samples
A total of 585 urine samples were collected from 65 different women (21-40 years
old) who planned to become pregnant. These women were followed throughout their
conception cycles with urine collected from day -8 to day 0 of their expected period.
These 585 samples were then tested by laboratory technicians (one for strip, one for
cassette format, and two midstream with one each for both dip and stream methods).
Urine samples were masked and randomized by people who prepared samples but did
not participate in the testing. One lot of each test device was used. The day of the
expected period was based on the average number of menstrual cycle days reported
for the previous 3 cycles. The pregnancy was confirmed by ultrasound scan. The
results are summarized below:

Lay user Study
A lay user study was performed at three intended use sites with a total of 300 females
with diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ages ranging from 21 to >
50 years. In this study, 100 lay users tested with the strip devices, 100 lay users tested
with the cassette devices and 100 lay users tested with the midstream devices (60 by
stream method, 40 by dip method). Of these 300 lay users, 146 of them were
suspected to be pregnant. In addition to testing their own urine samples, lay users also
tested urine samples at 5.0 and 10mIU/ml hCG concentrations (prepared by spiking
hCG into negative pooled urine specimens). The results are summarized below.

A Flesch-Kincaid reading analysis was performed on each package insert and the
score demonstrated a reading Grade Level of 7. The results of the questionnaire
reflected that the consumers found the test easy to use and that they did not have
trouble understanding the labeling or interpreting results.
Specificity Study to Determine False-Positive Results Rate:
A study was performed to determine the incidence of false positive results in
urine from 900 non-pregnant females when tested with the each of the three
formats of the candidate device at three different physicians’ offices. Urine
samples from non-pregnant women in pre-menopausal (18-40 years, n=300),
peri-menopausal (41-55 years, n=300), and post-menopausal (>55 years, n=300)
age groups were evaluated. Three lots of each test format were used in the study
and were randomly distributed among the participants. Non-pregnant females
from each age group tested their own urine with each of the test formats based on
package insert instructions. The results are summarized in the tables below:
