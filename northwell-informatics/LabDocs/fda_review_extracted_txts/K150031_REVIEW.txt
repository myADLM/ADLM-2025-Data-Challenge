L. Test Principle:
The hemoFISH Masterpanel is a Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)-based assay that
uses DNA Beacon probes to detect specific bacterial rRNA sequences on microscope slides
prepared from positive blood cultures. The assay identifies the targeted Gram-positive and
Gram-negative panel members to family, genus or species level within 30 minutes. Other
“off-panel” species are also detected using a universal Eubacterial probe.
The method is based on classical fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using
fluorescently labeled molecular beacon probes. The molecular beacons consist of a DNA
sequence folded into a hairpin-like structure that is linked to a fluorophore on the 5´end and
to a quencher on the 3´end. A part of the DNA sequence on both ends forms a stem region
through complementary base-pairing. This structure keeps the fluorophore and quencher in
close proximity, suppressing the generation of fluorescent signal. The DNA sequence
between the stem regions of the probe is complementary to an rRNA region that is specific to
the targeted group of organisms. Because each bacterial cell includes more than 10,000
copies of rRNA, no amplification step is necessary. The DNA sequences of the beacons that
are specific to the target region form a loop-like structure and are able to bind to their rRNA
targets after passing through the bacterial cell wall and membrane. In a bound state, the
fluorophore of the beacon is spatially separated from its quencher and fluoresces when
excited with an appropriate light source.
Every rRNA copy with a bound beacon contributes to the overall fluorescent signal and cells
containing hybridized probe can be detected under a fluorescence microscope. Unbound
beacons do not fluoresce, so that no washing step is required.
To conduct the assay, solutions of fluorescently labeled molecular DNA beacons are
dispensed onto fixed, permeablized cells that are prepared from a positive blood culture.
Different wells of the microscope slide are used for each probe combination. Hybridization is
carried out at 52±1°C for 10 minutes. Slides are immersed in a bath containing a stop
solution and rinsed in alcohol to end the reaction. Mounting Medium is then added to each
well to prevent fading of fluorescence. After applying a cover slip, the slide is ready for
examination by fluorescence microscopy.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the hemoFISH Masterpanel was assessed by testing slides
prepared from positive blood cultures at 3 sites over a period 10 days. Two sites (A
6

--- Page 7 ---
and B) used cultures grown in VersaTREK REDOX 1 medium and one site (C) used
BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F Culture Vials. Cultures that were positive for 9
different bacterial species were included in the study. All slides were prepared at
“bottle ring”, dried and stored until testing. Three replicate slides for each strain were
tested on each day. There were two operators per site and each operator tested 45
slides (total = 90 slides per strain). The results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The
study showed that the results of the hemoFISH Masterpanel were reproducible, with
no important differences in performance between sites, type of culture medium,
operators or days of testing.

Assay Controls
One well of each hemoFISH Masterpanel microscope slide is used for quality control.
This well is used for hybridization of an ATTO550-labeled Eubacterial probe. In
order for the results from hybridization of the hemoFISH probes in the other wells of
the slide to be interpreted, cells in the control well with a morphology that is
consistent with that observed under Gram stain should fluoresce red (Positive
Control) and there should be no green fluorescent cells (Negative Control). In
addition, in order to interpret positive results from E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S.
aureus species-specific probes, the appropriate family or genus probe must also
produce a positive result.

During the clinical study, a total of 244 External Controls were tested (88 E. coli, 75
S. aureus and 81 P. aeruginosa), all (100%) of which produced the expected results.
Note: No External Controls were tested during the Clinical Study to monitor the
performance of the Streptococcus or K. pneumoniae probes. However, the Eubacterial
Control was included on every slide and served to monitor hybridization conditions
and clinical performance for the detection of these analytes was determined to be
acceptable.
Specimen Stability
Studies were performed to evaluate the ability of the hemoFISH Masterpanel to
produce the expected results with blood culture bottles that were held under different
conditions after turning positive. Testing was conducted with BD BACTEC Plus
Aerobic/F blood culture bottles inoculated with different species of bacteria
representing each of the targeted analytes. After turning positive, the bottles were
either tested with the hemoFISH Masterpanel immediately or held for 8 or 12 hours at
either room temperature or 35°C prior to testing. The appropriate results were
obtained for each organism at each time point. The instructions in the Package Insert
therefore indicate that testing with the hemoFISH Masterpanel may be conducted up
to 12 hours after bottle ring.
Fixed Slide Stability
The stability of dried microscope slides after heat fixation and prior to
permeablization and hybridization was established by storing fixed slides in the dark
for up to 14 days at ~25°C prior to testing with the hemoFISH Masterpanel. The
slides were prepared from BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F Culture Vials using the
strains listed in Table 5. All results were as expected. The Package Insert indicates
that fixed slides may be stored for up to 14 days in the dark prior to testing.

Post Hybridization Slide Stability
The stability of microscope slides after hybridization and mounting was determined
by reading slides prepared from positive blood cultures of different organisms after
storage for up to 24 hours in the dark at ~25°C. The bacterial strains and culture
media used in the study are shown in Table 5. All results at each time point (0, 2, 4
and 24 hours) were as expected. The Package Insert indicates that slides may be
stored for up to 12 hours in the dark after hybridization prior to reading.

performance of the hemoFISH Masterpanel (refer to Section M 3(a), Table 28)
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LOD) of each probe in the hemoFISH Masterpanel was
estimated by testing serial dilutions of different bacterial species prepared from
positive BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F blood culture vials. The LOD was confirmed
by testing 20 replicates at the estimated LOD target level. Target levels were
determined by colony counts. The LOD was considered confirmed if ≥19/20
replicates produced a positive result for the hemoFISH probe(s) under evaluation
(Table 6).

f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
g. Assay Interference:
A study was conducted to determine the ability of the hemoFISH Masterpanel to
report the correct results from mixed cultures of two species that are identified in the
same microscope field. Testing was performed with BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F
culture vials containing whole blood that was inoculated with different ratios of S.
aureus (103-105 CFU/mL) and E. coli (106-108CFU/mL) or S. pneumoniae (103-105
CFU/mL) and K. pneumoniae (106-109 CFU/mL). The blood culture vials were
incubated until they turned positive and were then tested with the hemoFISH
Masterpanel. All assay results were as expected, indicating that the hemoFISH
Masterpanel is capable of correctly identifying mixed cultures of specific organisms
that are detected in the same field when the target levels are above the limit of
detection of the assay.
Note: Based on the design of the hemoFISH Masterpanel and the performance
observed with mixed cultures observed in the Clinical Study (Section M 3), the
following specific Limitations are included in the device labeling.
· The hemoFISH assay does not differentiate species of Staphylococcus other
than Staphylococcus aureus. Therefore, whether a sample contains one or
multiple species of Staphylococcus (other than S. aureus), the result will be

reported as “Other staphylococci.” Samples that are reported as positive for S.
aureus may also contain other Staphyloccocus species. The blood culture
bottle should be plated on solid medium to obtain isolated colonies for
Staphyloccus species identification and/or susceptibility testing.
· The hemoFISH assay does not differentiate species of Streptococcus.
Therefore, whether a sample contains one or multiple species of
Streptococcus, the result will be reported as “Streptococci.” The blood culture
bottle should be plated on solid medium to obtain isolated colonies for
Streptococcus species identification and/or susceptibility testing.
· The hemoFISH assay does not differentiate species of Enterobacteriaceae
other than E. coli, and K. pneumoniae. Therefore, whether a sample contains
one or multiple species of Enterobacteriaceae (other than E. coli, or K.
pneumoniae), the result will be reported as “Other Enterobacteriaceae.”
Samples that are reported as positive for E. coli, or K. pneumoniae may also
contain other species of Enterobacteriaceae. The blood culture bottle should
be plated on solid medium to obtain isolated colonies for species identification
and/or susceptibility testing.
· The hemoFISH assay may produce false-negative results with mixed cultures
that contain one or more organisms below the limit of detection.
· If a mixed culture is suspected on the basis of Gram stain or if the hemoFISH
Masterpanel result is positive for “Other” (not Staphylococci, Streptococci or
Enterobacteriaceae), the blood culture bottle should be plated on solid
medium to obtain isolated colonies for further identification.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
An analytical study was performed to evaluate the compatibility of the hemoFISH
Masterpanel with 13 different types of culture media (Table 14). Testing was
performed with blood cultures containing representative isolates of each species,
genus or family in the hemoFISH Masterpanel. Bottles were inoculated at low levels
and incubated at 35°C for 20-23 hours prior to testing depending on the culture
medium. The expected results were obtained with each of the culture medium in
which growth occurred. No growth was obtained when E. coli was inoculated into in
VersaTREK REDOX 2 vials, although the ability of the hemoFISH Masterpanel to
detect E. coli in this culture medium was demonstrated in the Clinical Study (Section
M 3, Table 28).

An additional analytical study was conducted to verify the tolerance of the hemoFISH
Masterpanel to differences in the volume of blood inoculated into the culture
medium. Testing was performed with a representative panel of organisms grown in
BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F and Plus Anaerobic/F culture vials containing volumes
of blood ranging from 5 to 10mL per vial. All results were as expected, with no
difference in performance according to blood volume.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The performance of the hemoFISH Masterpanel was evaluated in a prospective
Clinical Study that was conducted at three testing sites (two in the US and one ex-
US). Samples included in the study were residual blood culture vials that were called
positive by an automated blood culture system and which were confirmed to contain
bacteria by Gram stain.
The prospective study at the clinical sites was supplemented with in-house testing of
additional contrived samples prepared by inoculating blood culture vials with whole
human blood containing organisms and incubating until “bottle ring.” Table 15
shows the total number of samples included in the study.

1 Includes 1 sample that was positive by the reference method for yeast. Based on in silico analysis, the
expected hemoFISH result with cultures that are positive for yeast when no bacteria are present is “Fail” due
to the absence of signal with the Eubacterial probe. As noted in the Package Insert, cultures identified as
positive for “Other” (not Staphylococci, Streptococci or Enterobacteriaceae) require additional follow-up for
definitive identification of the species present.

1 Includes 1 sample that was positive by the reference method for yeast. Based on in silico analysis, the expected
hemoFISH result with cultures that are positive for yeast when no bacteria are present is “Fail” due to the absence of
signal with the Eubacterial probe. As noted in the Package Insert, cultures identified as positive for “Other” (not
Staphylococci, Streptococci or Enterobacteriaceae) require additional follow-up for definitive identification of the species
present.
Note:
Based on analysis of the prospectively clinical samples and contrived monomicrobial
samples combined (Table 21):
1) The lower 95% confidence interval for identification of “Other
Enterobacteriaceae (not E. coli or K. pneumoniae)” was 89.3%, which is below
the acceptance criterion of ≥90%. However, with the prospective samples alone,
the point estimate and lower 95% confidence interval for identification of “Other
Enterobacteriaceae” were 100% and 91.4%, respectively (Table 18). In addition,
according to the design of the hemoFISH Masterpanel, samples that are negative
for “Other Enterobacteriaceae” and not positive for any of the other individual
species or genera identified by the panel are reported as positive for “Other (not
Staphylococci, Streptococci or Enterobacteriaceae).” A Limitation in the Package

Insert stipulates that samples reported positive for “Other (not Staphylococci,
Streptococci or Enterobacteriaceae)” should be subcultured for further
identification. The risk of reporting a false-negative result for “Other
Enterobacteriaceae” is therefore mitigated.
2) The lower 95% confidence interval for identification of E. coli was 89.8%. With
rounding to the nearest integer, this meets the acceptance criterion of a lower 95%
confidence interval ≥90%. All 4 samples that were reported by the hemoFISH
Masterpanel as false-negative for E. coli were from the ex-US clinical site. Three
of the 4 were reported as positive for “Other (not Staphylococci, Streptococci or
Enterobacteriaceae)” and 1 was reported as positive for Other Enterobacteriaceae
(not E.coli or K. pneumoniae).”

Polymicrobial Cultures
The performance of the hemoFISH Master panel for identification of organisms in
polymicrobial blood cultures is summarized in Tables 29 and 30. Results from 55
prospectively collected polymicrobial samples were included in the analysis. The
hemoFISH Masterpanel correctly identified each of the organisms present in only
5/55 (9.1%) polymicrobial samples, all of which contained 2 bacterial species. For
49/50 (98.0%) of the remaining samples, the hemoFISH Masterpanel correctly
identified at least one of the organisms present.
The performance of the hemoFISH Masterpanel with mixed cultures in part reflects
the inability to discriminate between co-infecting species of the same genus (for
Staphylococci and Streptococci) or family (Enterobacteriaceae). As noted in Section
M 1(g), Limitations with respect to correct identification of organisms in
polymicrobial cultures are included in the device labeling.
