3. Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing - 24th Informational
Supplement, Ml00-S24 (QC parameters only)
L. Test Principle:
The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are miniaturizations of the broth dilution susceptibility
test which have been dehydrated. Various antimicrobial agents are diluted in Mueller-Hinton
broth supplemented with calcium and magnesium to concentrations bridging the rage of
clinical interest. Breakpoint Combo panels use concentrations equivalent to the categorical
breakpoints of FDA and/or CLSI. After inoculation and rehydration with a standardized
suspension of organism and incubation of 35°C for a minimum of 16 hours, the minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test organism is determined by observing the lowest
antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility data for 10 isolates including one E. casseliflavus, one E. faecalis,
two E. faecium, three S. aureus (one MSSA and two MRSA), two S. epidermidis and
one S. haemolyticus and one QC strain (E. faecalis ATCC 29212) were generated at 5
clinical trial sites. Organism selection was based on the intended use of the
antimicrobial agent. Each strain was tested at each site in triplicate over three days
using 2 inoculation methods (Turbidity and Prompt) and 3 reading methods (manual,
WalkAway Instrument and autoSCAN-4 Instrument).

The mode of the test panel MIC results was determined for each isolate. MIC results
at each site were compared to the mode value for each strain. Results were considered
in agreement if the test panel MIC was equal to or within ± 1 dilution of the mode for
that isolate. Agreement was calculated assuming any off-scale results were within one
well from the mode (best case) and by assuming any off-scale results were greater
than one well from the mode (worst case). Data were analyzed for all dilutions of
Vancomycin (0.25-64 µg/mL). The agreement was calculated for each site and for
the five sites combined.
For all sites combined, agreement within 1 ± dilution from the mode for all
inoculation and reading methods was > 95% for best case and for worst case
scenarios. The reproducibility study results are acceptable. The results of the best case
scenarios are shown in Table 2 below.
The results were acceptable.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
This 510(k) application was submitted to demonstrate that MicroScan Dried Gram-
Positive MIC/Combo panels with reformulated vancomycin (Test panels) are
substantially equivalent to frozen CLSI reference panels (Reference panels). Device
performance was evaluated in a clinical trial that included gram-positive isolates.
A total of 128 challenge isolates were tested (40 Enterococcus spp, 15 MRSA, 21
MSSA, 17 CNS, 9 VRSA and 26 VISA). Of the 128 challenge isolates, the expected
results for 71 strains were susceptible, and 25 strains were Resistant. The 9 VRSA
strains were tested at an internal site, while the rest of the isolates were tested at
external sites.
A total of 947 clinical isolates were tested (166 Enterococcus spp, 205 MRSA, 207
MSSA and 369 CNS). Six hundred eighty-seven (687) organisms were fresh and two
hundred sixty (260) were stock isolates. The results were compared to the reference
method or expected results. Of the 947 gram positive isolates tested, 882 were
identified by the Reference panel to be Susceptible, and 62 isolates were identified as
Resistant.
Tables 5-8 below demonstrate the performance for each group of isolates (MRSA,
MSSA, CNS and Enterococcus species) based on essential agreement and category
agreement for the overall performance of the clinical and challenge isolates. Data is
shown for each inoculum preparation method (Turbidity and Prompt) and reading
(Overnight Manual, Walk-Away, and autoScan4). Accurate detection of resistance
requires extended incubation times of 24 hours for Enterococci. Staphylococci results
were read after 16-20 hours incubation (18-20 h for autoSCAN-4 instrument reads).
The results were comparable to those obtained at 24 hours with the reference method.
The performance data for VRSA and VISA is shown in Tables 9 and 10, respectively.
Table 11 shows the overall performance summary for all organisms.

min-minor discrepancies maj-major discrepancies vmj-very major discrepancies
Evaluable results are those that fall within the test range of the reference method and could also
be on-scale with the new device if within plus/minus one dilution. Essential Agreement (EA)
occurs when there is agreement between the result of the reference method and that of
MicroScan® within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Category
Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees
exactly with the interpretation of the MicroScan® result.
The overall combined %EA and %CA consistently meet the acceptance criteria of greater than or
equal to 90%.
MIC Trend Analysis:
Using the data provided by the sponsor in the diagonal table format recommended in the AST
Guidance, an analysis was conducted to check for trending in MIC values.
As summarized in Table 12 below, a lower reading trend was observed in the overall
performance of Coagulase negative Staphylococcus for the turbidity inoculation method in the
three reading methods (overnight manual, WalkAway and autoScan4) compared to the CLSI
broth micro-dilution method, which raises concerns for potential very major errors.

Based on our analysis, the overall performance of S. aureus (MRSA, MSSA) for the prompt
inoculation method, demonstrates a trend towards higher reading compared to the CLSI broth
micro-dilution method for all reading methods. This information is summarized in Table 13
below.

This trending and the potential for occurrence of major and very major errors(s) for Vancomycin
when testing Coagulase negative S. aureus and MRSA and MSSA was also addressed by adding
the following footnotes in the in labeling:
· Footnote 1:
“MicroScan vancomycin MIC values tended to be one doubling dilution lower when testing
coagulase negative Staphyloccus by the turbidity inoculation method using manual,
WalkAway and autoScan4 reading methods compared to reference broth micro-dilution.
· Footnote 2:
“MicroScan vancomycin MIC values tended to be one doubling dilution higher when testing
S. aureus (MR and MS) by the Prompt inoculation method using manual, WalkAway and
AutoScan-4 reading methods compared to reference broth micro-dilution.
Growth Rate:
All isolates tested during the clinical (efficacy) trials grew in both the frozen reference panel and
the dried MicroScan panels.
Prompt Hold Study:
An external study was performed to determine the agreement of results obtained with the Prompt
inoculation method using hold times of 0 hours and 4 hours prior to inoculation of the panels.
Results of 4-hour holds were compared to 0-hour hold using the same inoculum and with
expected results as determined by the reference method. Testing was performed with all three
read methods (WA, AS4 and manually). The results showed that there is no statistical difference
in the Vancomycin dried result between 4 hours and 0 hours to all read. There is no statistical
