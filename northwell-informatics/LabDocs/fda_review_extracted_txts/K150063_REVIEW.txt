I. Device Description:
The ACCU NEWS One Step hCG Pregnancy Test (Strip, Cassette, Midstream) is a
qualitative lateral flow immunoassay for the detection of hCG. The device comes in three
formats: strip, cassette, and midstream. Each device contains an airtight pouch that includes
the assay, a desiccant, and instructions for use. The OTC strip format also contains a urine
collection cup. The OTC cassette format contains a dropper pipette. The nitrocellulose test
strip of the midstream device is encased in plastic housing. These tests are conducted by
immersing the test strips in urine and observing the formation of colored lines. The specimen
migrates via capillary action along the membrane to react with the colored conjugate. Users
are able to read test results in 5 minutes. The assay cut-off is 25 mIU/mL.

L. Test Principle:
The ACCU NEWS One Step hCG Pregnancy Test (Strip, Cassette, Midstream) uses a double
antibody sandwich method. The membrane of the test strip is coated with mouse anti-β hCG
monoclonal antibody and anti-a hCG antibody immobilized on the test line region (T-line),
and goat anti-mouse immobilized on the control line region (C-line). During testing, the
urine specimen is mixed with the mouse anti-β hCG monoclonal antibody-colloidal gold
conjugate that allows β hCG to react with the antibody. The mixture then moves upward on
the membrane chromatographically and reacts with the anti-α hCG antibody on the T-line. If
β hCG is present, a pink line will appear indicating a positive result. If no β hCG is present,
no test result line will appear indicating a negative result. The mixture will continue to travel
up the test strip and react with the goat anti mouse on the C-line. Regardless of the presence
of hCG, as the mixture continues to move across the membrane to the immobilized goat anti-
mouse IgG polyclonal antibody, a pink-colored line at the C-line will always appear. This
serves as an internal procedural control.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using hCG free urine samples spiked with hCG to
achieve the following concentrations: 0, 12.5, 18.75, 25, 50, and 100 mIU/mL. The
hCG used for spiking contains the purified intact hCG traceable to the WHO
International 3rd Standard. The precision study was carried out at three different sites;
one internal site and two external point of care sites. Each study site tested a unique
lot of test device for each of the three formats (strip, cassette, midstream), for a total
of three lots of each test format. Each site performed blinded testing of the samples
with a total of 60 urine samples (10 from each urine sample) over 3-5 days. The
results are shown below for each test format:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The test is calibrated against the WHO 3rd International Standards for hCG.
Stability:
The device is stable for 2 years when stored at 4-30⁰C. The stability protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
See precision section above (M(1)(a)).
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity:
To determine if structurally similar analytes to hCG would interfere with test results,
three glycoprotein hormones were analyzed: Luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-
stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Negative and
positive hCG urine samples (25 mIU/mL) were spiked with different levels of
hormones; LH: 750, 1000, 3750, and 7500 mIU/mL, FSH: 750, 1000, 3750, and 7500

The sponsor completed testing with urine samples containing high concentrations of
hCG to determine if they would cause false negative results. Negative urine samples
were spiked with hCG standard to achieve concentrations of 50, 100, 200, 300, and
500 IU/mL. Three devices of each format were tested at each hCG concentration
(three tests per device format per concentration). The test results demonstrated no
hook effect at hCG concentrations up to 500 IU/mL.
hCG β-core fragment test:
To evaluate hook effects of the hCG β-core fragment, negative and positive hCG
urine samples (25 mIU/mL) were spiked with β-core hCG fragment standard
(traceable to WHO reference reagent 99/708) at several different concentrationsup to
1,000,000 pmol/L. Each spiked urine sample was tested using three devices from
each format. However, the results demonstrated that no hook effect was observed at
an hCG β-core fragment concentration up to 100,000 pmol/L.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was conducted at 1 internal site and to external point of
care sites to compare results obtained from each test format of the candidate device to
test results obtained from the predicate device in the hands of professional users. A
total of 250 urine samples were collected from 250 donors (age ranging between 18-
43 years old), and approximately half of the participants were suspected to be
pregnant. Data of tested participants are below.
