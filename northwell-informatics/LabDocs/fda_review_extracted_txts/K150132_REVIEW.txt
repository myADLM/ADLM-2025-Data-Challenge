b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and Value assignment:
The IMMULITE IGF-I controls are value assigned using assigned reference
controls. The assigned reference controls are prepared using IGF-I and IGFBP-3
antigen stock. Human Recombinant IGF-I antigen and IGF-I/IGFBP-3 positive
human serum are used. IGF-I and IGF BP-3 antigens are sourced from
commercially available vendors with high purity. IGF controls are required to have
a minimum of 100 control points from at least 3 kit lots and 3 instruments on both
IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 and IMMULITE 2000 platforms and for both IGF-I
and IGFBP-3. The control mean values are based on the calculated averaged values
from all the instruments. Control mean values and 2 SD control ranges for one
reagent lot are shown below.
IGF-I:
Control Level Mean 2SD Range
(ng/mL) (ng/mL)
1 91 73-109
2 277 222-332
IGFBP-3:
Control Level Mean 2SD Range
(ng/mL) (ng/mL)
1 1.10 0.86 – 1.34
2 4.4 3.6 – 5.2
The IMMULITE Gastrin controls are value assigned using assigned reference
controls. The assigned reference controls are prepared using gastrin antigen stock.
Gastrin antigen is sourced from a commercially available vendor with high purity.
Gastrin controls are required to have a minimum of 100 control points from at least
3 kit lots and 3 instruments on both IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 and IMMULITE
2000 platforms. The control mean values are based on the calculated averaged
values from all the instruments. Control mean values and 2 SD control ranges for
one reagent lot are shown below.

Stability:
Shelf-Life and Open Vial Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for the
IMMULITE IGF Control Module were described and found to be adequate. The
real time stability study shows study results up to 3 years when stored at 2 - 8 °C
supporting the claim of 3 years shelf life from date of manufacture when stored at
2 - 8 °C prior to opening. The open vial stability study shows study results up to 35
days at –20°C supporting the claim of 30 days after opening and reconstitution if
aliquoted and frozen immediately at –20°C.
