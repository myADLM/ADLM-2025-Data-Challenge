M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility/Precision Study:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three sites (one internal and two external),
testing three individual lots at each site, two runs per day in triplicate for five non-
consecutive days. At each testing site, each of the three VisuCon Low Control lots
were tested by one operator using one lot of Diagnostica STA-Fibrinogen Assay
(K840211) on STA Compact Analyzer (K093167).
All data points from the study were pooled and analyzed in a mixed effect model with
lot, test site, day and run treated as random effects. The coefficient of variation (CV)
and the standard deviation (SD) for each of the random effects (variance): lot-to-lot,
site-to-site, between-day, between-run, within-run and total reproducibility precision
was calculated.
Results show that data met pre-determined acceptance criteria and demonstrated
reproducibility of the VisuCon Low Control under tested conditions. Results of the
pooled data are presented below:
Instrument: STA Compact Analyzer
Source of Variance Standard Deviation %CV
(SD) (SD/mean)*100
Lot-to-lot 0.059 7.2%
Site-to-site 0.013 1.5%
Between-Day 0.006 0.7%
Between-Run 0 0%
Within-Run (Repeatability) 0.025 3.0%
Total Variability 0.07 8.0%
Repeatability study/Within-Laboratory Precision Study: Three lots of VisuCon-F
Low Fibrinogen Control Plasma were tested on two different Diagnostica Stago STA-
Compact Analyzers using the Diagnostica Stago STA-Fibrinogen 5 assay. Testing
was conducted in duplicate, two runs per day over a period of 20 days. Data from the
repeatability study was pooled (n=480) and analyzed in a mixed effect model with the
lot, instrument, day and run treated as random effects.
Results show the data met pre-determined acceptance criteria, and are summarized
below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability Study:
Open Vial Stability Study: The open vial stability study was conducted at the
refrigerated temperature of 2°C to 8°C and on-board temperature of 19°C to 22°C, on
two lots of VisuCon-F Low Fibrinogen Control plasma. The study demonstrated the
VisuCon-F Low Fibrinogen Control Plasma is stable up to 72 hours when stored at 2-
8°C and up to 8 hours at 19-22°C. The study met the pre-determined acceptance
criteria.
Closed Vial Stability Study: The closed vial stability study was conducted at the
storage temperature of ≤ -60°C using three lots of the VisuCon-F Low Fibrinogen
Control Plasma. The study demonstrated that the VisuCon-F Low Fibrinogen Control
Plasma is stable up to 36 months when stored at or below -60°C. The study met the
pre-determined acceptance criteria.
Value Assignment: The value assignment for VisuCon-F Low Fibrinogen Control
Plasmas were assigned to fibrinogen by testing 20 vials, 5 vials per day over 4 days
(n=20). The ranges for the controls were assigned to fibrinogen by calculating and
applying ± 2 standard deviations (SD) from the mean. Three lots were tested using
the Diagnostica Stago Fibrinogen-5 Assay, which was calibrated against SSC/ISTH
Secondary Coagulation Standard. The mean values assigned to each lot met the
acceptance criteria and is as follows:
