L. Test Principle:
Samples diluted 1:80 in PBS are incubated with the antigen substrate (HEp-2 cells) coated on
the slide. After incubation, unbound antibodies are washed off. The substrate is then
incubated with anti-human IgG-FITC conjugate. The conjugate contains a DNA-binding
blue fluorescent dye, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) that is required for NOVA
View® use. Unbound reagent is washed off, and the slides are coverslipped. Stained slides
can be read by manual fluorescence microscopy, or scanned with the NOVA View®. The
NOVA View® will suggest a result (positive/negative) and a pattern (homogeneous,
speckled, centromere, nucleolar, nuclear dots or unrecognized) for positive results. The
resulting digital images can be reviewed and interpreted from the computer monitor.
Samples that are positive at 1:80 may be titered manually by performing a two-fold serial
dilution from the initial screening dilution with PBS buffer (i.e. 1:80, 1:160, 1:320, 1:640,
1:1280, 1:2560, etc.) to determine the endpoint titer.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Nomenclature used in studies:
· Throughout the submission, results obtained by manual reading of the same slides are
used as reference method
· “Manual” and “Manual reading” refer to results obtained by the operator reading and
interpreting the slides with a traditional fluorescence microscope.
· “Digital”, Digital reading” and “Digital image” refers to results obtained by the
operator reading NOVA View® generated images on the computer monitor, blinded
to the suggested interpretation.
· “NOVA View®” refers to results obtained with the NOVA View® Automated
Fluorescent Microscope, such as Light Intensity Units (LIU), positive/negative
classification and pattern information.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability
To assess repeatability of the NOVA Lite® DAPI ANA kit using the NOVA View®
and a manual microscope, three different studies were performed. For each study,
samples were diluted for each run separately; therefore, if 10 runs were performed, 10
dilutions were prepared at the beginning of the slide processing. Within one run, the
same dilution was tested in triplicate. The same reagent lot was used by all three
repeatability studies.
The first study tested three negative and 10 positive samples with various patterns and
intensities were stained with NOVA Lite® DAPI ANA kit, and tested in triplicates in
10 runs (two runs per day), resulting in 30 data points for each sample. The slides
were scanned by NOVA View®, and the resulting digital images were interpreted by
the operator. The slides in this study were not read with a manual microscope; i.e.
only two set of results were generated: NOVA View® output and digital image
reading results. The percentage of positive/negative calls are presented below:

A second study cohort of samples was selected to challenge the cut-off LIU of the
NOVA View® System. Twenty-two samples covering all patterns identified by the
NOVA View® which included 20 samples considered borderline/LIU values around
cut-off, and 2 samples with 3+ average grade intensity level. Samples were tested in
three replicates, in 10 runs (2 runs per day), resulting in 30 data points for each
sample. Samples were diluted to target low-positive samples and challenge the
NOVA View® LIU and then diluted a second time at 1:80 per the kit instructions for
use. The slides were scanned with NOVA View®, and digital images were
interpreted. The same slides were then read with a manual microscope. In total, three
set of results were generated: NOVA View® output, digital image reading results and
manual reading results.

For both digital image reading and manual reading for study one and study two,
intensity grades were within ± 1 reactivity grade within one run (within triplicates),
and the average grade was no more than one reactivity grade different between runs.
Pattern determination was consistent for 100% of the replicates (for positive samples
only).
Reproducibility:
To assess between operator and between instrument variability, a reproducibility
study was performed at Inova Diagnostics (internal; Site#1) and at two external sites
(Sites #2, #3) using the same sample cohort.
A cohort of 120 samples at each location was processed with NOVA Lite® DAPI
ANA kit, and scanned with NOVA View®. Digital images were interpreted and
confirmed. Additionally, a second operator read and interpreted the same digital
images at each location. Altogether, six digital image datasets were generated (three
locations, two operators at each site). The same digital images were read by the two
operators at each site, but different slides were read at all three locations.

Within-Site Pattern Agreement across method:
Pattern agreement was assessed in pair-wise comparison between manual reading,
NOVA View® results, and digital image reading at each site. Only definitive
patterns (Homogeneous, Speckled, Centromere, Nucleolar, Nuclear dots) were
considered as pattern agreement. NOVA View® reported “Unrecognized” patterns
and user reported “Other” patterns were not considered as an agreement.
Out of the 120 samples in the reproducibility cohort, there were 57 positive samples
at Site #1, 60 at Site #2 and 56 at Site #3 by manual reading (reference method). A

Stability:
Accelerated stability study was performed on three lots of conjugate with DAPI
according to an isochronous design, at 37 ± 3°C for 4 weeks. Each week a new vial
of sealed component was placed in the incubator at 37 ± 3°C, and all components
were tested at the end of the study period together with a vial that was stored at 5 ±
3°C (control). Testing was performed by staining the slides with characterized
samples. All calculations were performed by comparing results obtained with the
control vial (stored at 5 ± 3°C) to those obtained with vials stored at 37 ± 3°C for 1, 2,
3, and 4 weeks, where one week is equal to six months at 5 ± 3°C. All slides were

Three specimens were tested (one negative, one medium positive, and one strong
positive) in triplicate for each level of interferant. Interfering substances
(hemoglobin, bilirubin, triglycerides, and cholesterol) were spiked into every
specimen at three different concentrations in 10% of total specimen volume resulting
in the final interferant concentrations indicated in the table above. To assess
interference with rheumatoid factor (RF), 10%, 30% and 50% RF positive sample by
volume was added to the test samples. Appropriate controls were made by adding
10% sample diluent to the same samples. All samples were processed with NOVA
Lite® DAPI ANA kit, and scanned with NOVA View®. Digital images were
interpreted and confirmed. All slides were read by the same operator with manual
microscopy.
Reactivity grades of samples containing the interfering substance were within ± one
grade of the control samples with both manual and digital reading.
No interference was detected with bilirubin up to 10 mg/dL, hemoglobin up to 200

f. Assay cut-off:
The recommended starting dilution, above which the result is reported as positive and
below which the result is reported as negative, is 1:80 for use with the NOVA View®
System and manual microscopy. The serum dilution of 1:80 was selected to provide
optimal clinical sensitivity and specificity.
Light Intensity Unit (LIU) Cut-off:
The cut-off LIU has been established on 120 serum samples from apparently healthy
blood bank donors. All samples were processed with NOVA Lite® DAPI ANA kit,
and scanned with NOVA View®. Digital images were interpreted and confirmed.
All slides were read by the same operator with manual microscopy.
The specificity value for the manual read was used as reference to establish the cut-
off in LIU values with the performance goal that the NOVA View® report results
showing good agreement with results generated by manual reading.
The LIU values for the 120 samples ranged from 0 to 286 LIU, with a mean value of
20 and SD of 34. The cut-off was established with the non-parametric percentile
method. The 90th percentile of LIU values was 48.8 (90% CI: 31 to 78%), so 48 LIU
was selected as the cut-off LIU. The cut-off value is entered in the software during
NOVA View® installation and setup, and is used for classification of samples as
negative or positive. The cut-off for the NOVA View® cannot be modified.
At a cut-off level of 48 LIU, NOVA View® classification showed 98.3% overall

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To demonstrate the equivalent performance of the NOVA Lite® DAPI ANA Kit
which contains the DAPI conjugate and is used with a cut-off of 1:80 to the predicate
kit without DAPI and a 1:40 starting dilution, a method comparison study was
performed using 410 samples made up of 400 clinically characterized sera, and 10
samples with known ANA patterns.
All slides were interpreted with traditional fluorescence microscopy only.
Interpretation included positive/negative categorization, pattern interpretation and
grading of positive samples on a scale of 1+ to 4+.
The distribution of the cohort and the frequency of positive results are shown in the

**Control samples include RA and infectious disease population
Conjugate comparison:
The NOVA Lite® DAPI ANA Kit contains the same components as the predicate
device, with the exception of the conjugate. To adapt the assay for use on NOVA
View®, the blue fluorescent dye DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) that binds
strongly to A-T rich regions in DNA was added to the conjugate. The addition of
DAPI does not influence the test utility and performance when used manually, as it is
not visible at the wavelength used for reading slides with traditional fluorescence
microscopy, and does not interfere with antibody binding.
To demonstrate the equivalent performance of the conjugate with and without DAPI,
a comparison study has been performed on clinical samples.
407 individual serum samples have been tested. Two sets of slides were stained: one
with the conjugate without DAPI (the predicate device), the other with the conjugate
with DAPI (NOVA Lite® DAPI ANA Kit). The 1:80 serum dilution was used for
both kits. The two sets of slides were read by the same operator by manual
microscopy. Positive/negative agreement, pattern agreement and grade correlation
were evaluated.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
To determine accuracy and clinical sensitivity and specificity, a cohort of 463
clinically characterized samples were processed with NOVA Lite® DAPI ANA kit,
and scanned with NOVA View®. Digital images were independently interpreted and
confirmed by a trained operator. Additionally, slides were read with traditional
manual microscope by the same operator. The same slides were read at three
different locations, one internal (site 1) and two external (sites 2 and 3).
The number and distribution of the samples are shown below:

Within-Site Pattern Agreement:
Pattern agreement was assessed in pair-wise comparison between manual reading,
NOVA View® results, and digital image reading. Only definitive patterns
(homogeneous, speckled, centromere, nucleolar, nuclear dots) were considered as
pattern agreement. NOVA View® reported “Unrecognized” patterns and user
reported “Other” patterns were not considered as an agreement.
Out of the 463 clinical samples, there were 171 positive samples at Site #1, 190 at
Site #2 and 209 at Site #3 by manual reading (reference method). Agreement
between digital image reading and manual reading was above 90% at all three testing
sites.
Summary table of pattern percent agreement is shown below:
Number (%) of samples with pattern agreement*
N=463
Site#1 Site#2 Site#3
Digital vs Manual 94.7% 94.7% (94.7%
NOVA View vs Manual 76.0% 86.3% (72.7%
Digital vs NOVA View 69.6% 69.6% 69.6%
*As percentage of samples that were positive with manual interpretation.
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
See analytical cut-off.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The clinical validation study population included samples from 75 apparently healthy
controls (different cohort from those used for cut-off LIU establishment) which were
used to determine the reference range.
Out of the 75 samples tested at the Inova site, there were 4 (5.3%), 5 (6.7%) and 4 (5.3%)
positive results with Manual, Digital, and NOVA View® classification respectively.
With the NOVA View®, the average ± SD was 20 ± 49 LIU, with a median value of 9
LIU, and a range of 0-367 LIU, with non-normal distribution. The expected result in the
normal population is negative; however, 10-20% of positivity may be seen in reference
subjects according to published literature.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
