2. Indication(s) for use:
The Dimension Tacrolimus Flex® Reagent Cartridge (TAC) is an in vitro diagnostic test
for the quantitative measurement of tacrolimus in human whole blood on the Dimension®
clinical chemistry system. Measurements of tacrolimus are used as an aid in the management
of tacrolimus therapy in renal and hepatic transplant patients.
The Dimension Tacrolimus Calibrator (TAC CAL) is an in vitro diagnostic product for the
calibration of the Tacrolimus (TAC) method on the Dimension® clinical chemistry system.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use only
The instrument reporting system contains flags and comments to provide the user with
information regarding instrument processing errors, instrument status information and
potential errors in TAC results. Refer to the Dimension® Operator’s Guide for the
meaning of report flags and comments. Any result containing flags and/or comments
should be addressed according to your laboratory’s procedure manual.
Patient samples may contain heterophilic antibodies that could react in immunoassays to
give falsely elevated or depressed results. Antibodies to ß-galactosidase can be
encountered in samples as a consequence of bacterial infection and may produce falsely
elevated results which may not be consistent with clinical evaluation. The assay has been
designed to minimize interference from antibodies to ß-galactosidase. In very rare
instances, immunoassays may produce falsely elevated or decreased results due to other
patient-specific interferents. A number of these interferents are present in the plasma of
affected patient samples and will be detected by the automatic rerun procedure. Complete
elimination of such interference from all patient specimens cannot be guaranteed. A test
result that is inconsistent with the clinical picture and patient history should be
interpreted with caution. Confirmation of unexpected or atypical results by an alternative
methodology is recommended prior to any adjustments in tacrolimus dosage. For patients
with impaired liver function and patients receiving other drugs which may induce or
inhibit microsomal enzyme activity, the routine use of the Dimension® Tacrolimus assay
may be supported by HPLC data to assess possible changes in biotransformation and
elimination.

If TACR (Cat.No. DF107) and TAC (Cat. No. DF207) assays are processed on the same
instrument, there is a remote potential for carryover from the TACR pretreatment reagent
to produce falsely elevated results with the TAC assay. This potential has been mitigated
as much as possible through the instrument software.
If use of the TAC and TACR assays on the same instrument cannot be avoided, as a
further safeguard, each run of the TAC assay should be immediately preceded by flushing
the reagent and sample probes (10 cycles) using the Prime Pump routine (SYSTEM
PREP, PUMP PRIME, PRIME WATER). TAC reagent hydrations should also be
preceded by flushing of the probes using this routine. Laboratories should convert as
rapidly as possible to consistent use of the TAC assay for individual patients, discontinue
use of the TACR assay and remove any remaining TACR reagent from the instrument
inventory.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The Dimension® clinical chemistry system
I. Device Description:
The automated Dimension® TAC method is performed using a method specific Flex® reagent
cartridge. The reagents for this assay are packaged in an 8-well Flex® Reagent Cartridge that
contains a pretreatment reagents, antibody-ß-galactosidase conjugate, tacrolimus immobilized on
chromium dioxide particles, chlorophenol red ß-d-galactopyranoside (CPRG) substrate, and
diluent to hydrate the tablets.
Dimension® Tacrolimus (TAC) Calibrator is five level frozen liquid, whole blood hemolysate
containing purified tacrolimus. The product is provided in 4.0 mL vials, 2 vials per level. There
are five calibrator levels per kit which span the assay range for the Dimension® Tacrolimus
(TAC) assay. The calibrators are packaged at 1.0 mL per vial for levels 2 – 5. Level 1, calibrator
base with no tacrolimus has 2.0 mL per vial so that it can also be used as a high sample diluent.
Each level of TAC Calibrator is prepared from human whole blood hemolysate base. Levels 2 – 5
are spiked with purified tacrolimus drug to achieve target concentrations of 3 ± 1 ng/mL; 6 ±
1ng/mL; 12 ± 2ng/mL and >30.0 ng/mL. Level 1 calibrator has no drug added.
The calibrator package insert contains the following caution: “Contains human source material.
Each donor unit used in the preparation of this product was tested by FDA-approved methods for
the presence of antibodies to Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) and Type 2 (HIV-
2), as well as for Hepatitis B surface Antigen and antibody to Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), and
found to be negative (not repeatedly reactive). Because no testing can offer complete assurance
that these or other infectious agents are absent, this material should be handled using good
laboratory practice to avoid skin contact and ingestion”.

L. Test Principle:
The Dimension® TAC method is an automated immunoassay in which free and tacrolimus-
bound antibody-enzyme conjugate is separated using magnetic particles. The tacrolimus
present in the sample is bound by the tacrolimus antibody. Magnetic particles coated with
tacrolimus are added to bind free (unbound) antibody-enzyme conjugate. The reaction
mixture is then separated magnetically. Following separation, the supernatant containing the
tacrolimus-antibody-enzyme complex is transferred to a cuvette and mixed with the
substrate; chlorophenol red ß-d-galactopyranoside (CPRG). ß-galactosidase catalyzes the
hydrolysis of CPRG to produce chlorophenol red (CPR) that absorbs light maximally at 577
nm. The change in absorbance at 577 nm due to the formation of CPR is directly proportional
to the amount of tacrolimus in the patient’s sample and is measured using a bichromatic (577,
700 nm) rate technique.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the Dimension® TAC method was evaluated at two external testing sites,
and at Siemens internal laboratory following EP5-A. Whole blood patient pools and
control materials were chosen at concentrations which represented the sub-
therapeutic, therapeutic and toxic range of the assay. For each test level, a single test
from two independent cups was analyzed twice per day for 20 days (N=80). A single
lot of reagent and calibrators was tested at each of the two external sites; whereas two
additional lots of reagents were tested at the internal site to evaluate lot-to-lot
variability. A whole blood sample with extremely low concentration of Tacrolimus
was also tested at the internal site. The results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity
A high tacrolimus native patient pool (40.6 ng/mL) and a patient pool with no
tacrolimus were combined in different ratios to produce nine levels of patient pools
which bracketed both the high and low end of the proposed assay range. The expected
concentrations of the samples based on the dilution factors are 0.0, 5.1, 10.2, 15.2,
20.3, 25.4, 30.5, 35.6, 40.6 ng/mL. All nine pools were assayed in replicate of 4 on a
single Dimension® analyzer. The measured values (Y) were compared to the
expected values (X). The result of linear regression based on each replicate is
summarized in the below table. The results below support the proposed measuring
range of 1.0 – 30.0 ng/mL.

Spiked recovery
Recovery of tacrolimus by the Dimension TAC assay was determined by adding a
known amount of USP standard tacrolimus to five human blood pools from patients
receiving tacrolimus therapy. The results for the samples spiked with tacrolimus
were compared to the control samples and the recovery was calculated using mean of
10 replicates of each sample. The sponsor defined acceptance criterion is 90-110%
recovery of the expected value.
The results are summarized in the table below.

Testing was performed to validate the manual dilution protocol (1:1 dilution on
samples with results > 30.0 ng/mL) recommended by the manufacturer in the package
insert. Four native serum samples, with tacrolimus concentrations >30 ng/mL on the
Dimension® TAC assay, were used for this study. The expected values for these
samples were assigned by LC-MS and ranged from 38.8 to 51.4 ng/mL. Two
preparations of a 1:1 dilution of each sample were prepared using TAC Calibrator
Level 1 as the diluent. Each aliquot of each sample tested in duplicate using the
Dimension TAC method. The % recovery values after dilution are summarized
below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and expected values
Siemens Tacrolimus (TAC) Calibrators are traceable to an internal reference standard
gravimetrically prepared and confirmed via HPLC. Calibrators’ values must be within
±1 % of the reference calibrator value.
Calibrator Stability
Real-time testing was performed. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed
and deemed acceptable. The shelf life for the Dimension TAC Calibrator is 12
months, at a storage temperature range of -15 to -25° C. Once thawed, assigned
values are stable for 30 days when recapped immediately after use and stored at 2-
8°C.
Sample Stability
The sponsor presented a study that supports the claim that whole blood samples
collected in EDTA may be stored at 2 – 8 °C or at ambient room temperature (23.6°C
to 24°C) for up to 8 days before testing. A freeze-thaw study was also conducted to
validate that EDTA whole blood samples could be stored frozen (-20oC) and thawed
prior to analysis without affecting test results.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical sensitivities were determined following EP17-A2. LoB and LoD were
determined using 5 patient samples free of tacrolimus, and 5 patient samples with low
tacrolimus levels ranging from 0.2 to1.7 ng/mL. For limit of quantitation (LoQ),
patient samples spiked with tacrolimus at 0.80, 0.85, 0.90, 0.95 and 1.00 ng/mL were
tested. All samples were measured in replicates of 4 using two reagent lots over a
period of 3 days. LoQ is defined as the lowest analyte concentration where the %CV
at the upper 95% confidence limits is ≤ 20%.
The results are summarized in the below table.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed following EP-7A2. The compounds tested
included endogenous compounds, drugs that are commonly co-administered with
tacrolimus, as well as common over-the-counter drugs and the anticoagulant EDTA.
The samples used for this study were prepared from whole blood to which purified
tacrolimus drug was added to achieve target concentrations of 5ng/mL and 20ng/mL.
Comparison between the test and control was done using the mean of five (5)
replicates for each sample. The % difference between the spiked sample and the
control sample with no substance was calculated. The sponsor defines no significant
interference as bias within ±10%. For compounds that showed >10% bias, a dose
response study was performed to determine the highest concentration at which no
interference is observed. No interference was observed with the exogenous
compounds tested and a complete list of the compounds and results are tabulated in
the package insert. The endogenous substances tested and the maximum allowed
concentration with no interference are summarized in the below table.

Cross-reactivity:
Cross-reactivity was performed following EP-7A2. The samples used for this study
were prepared from whole blood with or without the metabolite. Each sample was
tested in replicate of 5 and the mean was used to calculate cross-reactivity using the
below formula:
% Cross-reactivity=100x (Test-Control)/ Concentration of Compound
The results are summarized in the table below.

In the labeling, the sponsor has the following statement:
Patients undergoing retinal fluorescein angiography can retain amounts of fluorescein
in the body for up to 36 to 48 hours post-treatment. In the cases of patients with renal
insufficiency, including many diabetics, retention could be much longer. Such
samples can produce falsely elevated values when tested with this assay, and should
not be tested.
Triglycerides at 1500 mg/dL [16.9 mmol/L] decreases TAC results by -18.7 % at a
TAC concentration of 5 ng/mL [6.5 nmol/L] and decreases TAC results by -12.1 % at
20 ng/mL [26.0 nmol/L].
Intralipid at 1500 mg/dL [16.9 mmol/L] decreases TAC results by -13.6 % at a TAC
concentration of 5 ng/mL[6.5 nmol/L] and decreases TAC results by -18.6 % at a

TAC concentration of 20 ng/mL [26.0 nmol/L].
Patient samples may contain heterophilic antibodies that could react in immunoassays
to give falsely elevated or depressed results. Antibodies to ß-galactosidase can be
encountered in samples as a consequence of bacterial infection and may produce
falsely elevated results which may not be consistent with clinical evaluation. The
assay has been designed to minimize interference from antibodies to ß-galactosidase.
In very rare instances, immunoassays may produce falsely elevated or decreased
results due to other patient-specific interferents. A number of these interferents are
present in the plasma of affected patient samples and will be detected by the
automatic rerun procedure.
Complete elimination of such interference from all patient specimens cannot be
guaranteed. A test result that is inconsistent with the clinical picture and patient
history should be interpreted with caution.
Confirmation of unexpected or atypical results by an alternative methodology is
recommended prior to any adjustments in tacrolimus dosage. For patients with
impaired liver function and patients receiving other drugs which may induce or
inhibit microsomal enzyme activity, the routine use of the Dimension® Tacrolimus
assay may be supported by HPLC data to assess possible changes in
biotransformation and elimination.

Not applicable – this is a quantitative assay.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed at two external sites and an internal site
using 3 lots of reagents (one lot/site). The collection protocol is the same across the 3
different sites, with approximately 100 patients enrolled at each site, and half from
liver and half from kidney transplant patients. Each sample was tested in singlet using
the candidate assay, and compared to the result of the predicate assay and the LC-MS
method, respectively. The LC-MS method measures the parent drug of tacrolimus
(MRM, mass transition of 821.6 m/z to 768.7 m/z). The exact number of patients
tested at each site, and the Passing- Bablok regression analysis results are summarized
in the below tables. The samples tested ranged from 1.2 – 25.6 ng/mL, which covered
>80% of the assay range (1.0 – 30 ng/mL).

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
NA
b. Clinical specificity:
NA
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
NA
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable; this is a quantitative assay.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The following is stated in the package insert:
No firm therapeutic range exists for tacrolimus in whole blood. The complexity of the
clinical state, individual differences in sensitivity to immunosuppressive and nephrotoxic
effects of tacrolimus, co-administration of other immunosuppressants, type of transplant,
time post-transplant, and a number of other factors will cause different requirements for
optimal blood levels of tacrolimus. Individual tacrolimus values cannot be used as the
sole indicator for making changes in the treatment regimen. Each patient should be
thoroughly evaluated clinically before treatment adjustments are made. Each assay user
must establish therapeutic ranges based on clinical experience. Therapeutic ranges vary
according to the commercial test method used, and therefore should be established for
each commercial test. Values obtained with different assay methods cannot be used
interchangeably due to differences in assay methods and cross-reactivity with
metabolites, nor should correction factors be applied. Therefore, consistent use of one
assay for individual patients is recommended.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
