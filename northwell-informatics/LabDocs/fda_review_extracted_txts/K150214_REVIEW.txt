L. Test Principle:
The OneTouch Verio Flex Blood Glucose Monitoring System employs flavin adenine
dinucleotide-glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH) enzyme chemistry as the standard dry
reagent assay for glucose in whole blood. This enzymatic assay, with a redox chemical
“mediator” reaction, is used to generate an electrical current proportional to the glucose
concentration in the blood sample. The system is designed as an amperometric measurement
device using the current generated from the redox reaction as the measurable response.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity of the system was evaluated using venous blood from 9 donors adjusted to
nine glucose levels at21.67, 61.58, 100.99, 200.94, 298.17, 398.83, 496.04, 602.03,
705.93 mg/dL by YSI. The meter results for each strip lot (Y) were compared with
the reference value obtained from the YSI method (X). The results from regression
analysis are summarized below:
Lot 1: y = 1.013x-4.365, R2=0.998
Lot 2: y = 1.002x-2.969, R2=0.998
Lot 3: y = 1.003x-3.208, R2=0.997
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of
20 to 600 mg/dL. Data from bench studies and software verification studies were
provided to demonstrate that if a sample is less than 20 mg/dL, the result is flagged
by the meter as LO. If a sample result exceeds 600 mg/dL, the result is flagged by
the meter as HI.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor performed a system accuracy evaluation comparing the candidate
BGMS to YSI 2300 (reference method). The study was performed at three clinical
sites. Capillary fingerstick samples were collected from 115 subjects with glucose
concentrations ranging from 31.6 to 492.5mg/dL (2 of these samples were adjusted to
<50mg/dL and 1 sample was adjusted to >400mg/dL). The candidate BGMS was
tested in duplicate with each of three different strip lots providing a total of 6 meter
results per participant. The results for a singlet set of data relative to the reference
method are summarized in the tables below:

User Performance Study:
To assess the performance of the candidate BGMS in the hands of the intended users,
the sponsor performed a study with 172 untrained lay user participants at 3 different
clinical sites. Each subject was asked to review the instructions for use and meter
manual and perform testing on a fingertip. The health care professional collected
capillary blood for YSI 2300 tests and for hematocrit testing. The range of glucose
values for the samples as measured by the reference method was 42.1 to 533.3
mg/dL. Three (3) lots of test strips were randomly assigned and used in the study. The
results relative to the reference method are summarized below:
For glucose concentrations <75 mg/dL
Number of Within Within Within
test results ± 5 mg ± 10 mg ± 15 mg

During the lay user study the participants were asked to complete a questionnaire to
evaluate the ease of use of the device and the clarity of the English language labeling.
The responses to the Instructions for Use Questionnaire met the acceptance criteria, with
Lay Users demonstrating acceptable levels of comprehension of the user manual and the
strip insert. The readability of the labeling using a Flesch-Kincaid analysis was found to
be: Owners Booklet (7.7); OneTouch Verio Test Strip Insert (7.3) and OneTouch Verio
Control Solution Insert (7.0)
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor states the expected glucose range for non-diabetic, non-pregnant fasting
adults to be under 100 mg/dL, and two hours after meals, the levels should be less than
140 mg/dL

3. Specimen Identification:
13

--- Page 14 ---
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to
the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger. The whole
blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
The meter is automatically coded. No calibration is required by the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor provides two levels of glucose control solutions (OneTouch Verio Level 3
Control Solution and OneTouch Verio Level 4 Control Solution) that can be used with this
device but are sold separately. The sponsor recommends the user to use either OneTouch
Verio® Level 3 Control Solution or OneTouch Verio® Level 4 Control Solution with the
OneTouch Verio Flex™ Meter.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using venous whole blood
samples with 5 hematocrit levels (19, 30, 42, 50, 61%), each at six glucose levels (40±5,
65±5, 90±5, 120±6, 350±17, and 560±28 mg/dL). Results of samples at each hematocrit
level were compared to samples with the same glucose concentration at normal (42%)
hematocrit as well as to the corresponding YSI value. The data supports the claimed
hematocrit range of 20 – 60%.
2. Altitude study:
Venous whole blood samples collected from 3 blood donors were adjusted into 3
concentration levels (70, 240, and 450 mg/dL). The glucose meter readings at an altitude
of 10,000 feet were compared to the readings at sea level as well as the YSI method. The
results demonstrate acceptable bias to YSI to support the claims in the labeling that
altitudes up to 10,000 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements
from the candidate Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
3. Sample volume study:
The sponsor performed a study to verify the test strip sample volume requirement and the
test strip fill error requirement established for the proposed device. Blood samples at
glucose concentrations of 65 and 450 mg/dL were tested on the meter and compared to
the YSI values at 4 sample volumes of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 μL. The results show that
accurate results are obtained at sample volume ≥ 0.4 μL. For sample volumes below 0.4
μL, the sponsor validated that 99.49% of tests generated either an accurate glucose result
or a fill error message. A fill error message was computed when sample volume is
14

insufficient.
4. Temperature and humidity studies:
The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous blood samples
with glucose concentrations at 65, 150, 240, 350 and 450 mg/dL. Temperatures ranging
from 43°F - 111°F (6-44oC) and relative humidity from 10% to 90% were tested. Meter
results were compared to YSI reference analyzer. Four temperature and humidity
combinations were tested including low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high
humidity, high temperature/low humidity and high temperature/high humidity. The
results support the claims in the labeling that the system can be used in conditions of
43°F - 111°F (6-44oC) with relative humidity of 10 to 90%.
5. EMC Testing:
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing
(EMC) had been performed and the OneTouch Verio Flex Blood Glucose Monitoring
System was found to be compliant.
6. Infection Control Studies:
The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies
were performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing
laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the
chosen disinfectant, Clorox Germicidal Wipes, 0.55% sodium hypochlorite (EPA
Registration #67619-12). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor
demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of the meter
after 412 cleaning and disinfection cycles. The robustness studies support 3 years of
single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated
cleaning and disinfection procedures.
7. Customer service is available 8am to 10pm., 7 days a week by calling 1-888-567-3003.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10, and 21
CFR 801.109(b)(1) to contain the following language “Precautions: For In Vitro Diagnostic
Use Only.”
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
