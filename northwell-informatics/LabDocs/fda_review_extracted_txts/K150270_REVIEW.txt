L. Test Principle:
The ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D is a one-step delayed competitive enzyme
immunoassay which, after sample pretreatment, is performed entirely in the ST AIA-PACK
25-OH Vitamin D test cup. Sample pretreatment reagents (containing sodium hydroxide)
disassociate 25-OH vitamin D from its binding proteins in the test sample. 25-OH vitamin D
present in the pretreated sample is bound to 25-OH vitamin D-specific monoclonal antibody
immobilized on magnetic beads. After that, the enzyme-labeled 25-OH vitamin D is added to
the reaction mixture. The enzyme-labeled 25-OH vitamin D competes with 25-OH vitamin D
for binding to the antibody on magnetic beads in the reaction mixture.
After the second incubation, the magnetic beads are washed to remove the unbound enzyme-

labeled 25-OH vitamin D and are then incubated with a fluorogenic substrate, 4-
methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4MUP). The amount of enzyme-labeled 25-OH vitamin D
that binds to the beads is inversely proportional to the 25-OH vitamin D concentration in the
test sample. A standard curve is constructed, and unknown 25-OH vitamin D concentrations
are calculated using this curve.

prepared by diluting a serum sample with a high 25-OH vitamin D concentration with
a serum sample with a low 25-OH vitamin D concentration to obtain eleven (11)
intermediate concentration levels across the measuring range. Samples were run in
four replicates, using one reagent lot. The samples tested ranged from 3.4 to 128.5
ng/mL. The linear regression of the observed mean concentrations versus the
expected concentration was calculated.
The resulting linear regression equation was y = 1.02x-0.56 ng/mL, R2 = 1.00
The results of the linearity study support the sponsor’s claim that the assay is linear
from 4 -120 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Standardization and Traceability
The ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D Assay was originally cleared under 510(k)
k123131. Tosoh has modified the assay by standardizing the cleared vitamin D assay
in accordance with the Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP). The VDSP is an
international collaborative effort to standardize the laboratory measurement of serum
25-OH vitamin D. This collaboration involves the coordinated efforts of the National
Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes for Standards and Technology
(NIST), Ghent University, and other institutions. Please refer to
http://ods.od.nih.gov/Research/VitaminD.aspx for more information on the VDSP
program.
To achieve standardization against the VDSP recognized Reference Measurement
Procedure (RMP), the ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D Assay master calibration
parameters were aligned to the CDC VDSP by using 107 human serum samples from
the CDC VSDP program which were value assigned by the RMP, Ghent University
ID-LC-MS/MS and traceable to NIST SRM2972.
Calibrator traceability and value assignment
This assay is traceable to the isotope dilution-liquid chromatography/tandem mass
spectrometry (ID-LC-/MS/MS) 25-OH Vitamin D Reference Method Procedure
(RMP) that is traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2972. The calibrator traceability and value
assignment are prepared according to an internal procedure.
The values of the ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D primary reference materials were
assigned to align with CDC VDSP recognized RMP, Ghent University ID-LC-
MS/MS. The values of the secondary reference material were assigned using the AIA
instruments with the primary reference materials as calibrators. The values of the ST
AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D Calibrators supplied to the user, are assigned using the
AIA instruments with the secondary reference materials as calibrators. The ST AIA-
PACK 25-OH Vitamin D Calibrator target values are listed below:

--- Page 7 ---
Calibrator Level 1: 0 ng/mL
Calibrator Level 2: 8 ng/mL
Calibrator Level 3: 17 ng/mL
Calibrator Level 4: 33 ng/mL
Calibrator Level 5: 66 ng/mL
Calibrator Level 6: 135 ng/mL
The ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D assay (candidate device) has passed the
certification process for the CDC VDSP and a certificate has been provided by the
CDC. Please see http://www.cdc.gov/labstandards/hs.html for more information on
the CDC VDSP certification program.
Stability
The calibrator shelf-life and open-vial stability testing protocols and acceptance
criteria were previously reviewed in k123131. Reconstituted calibrators are stable for
one day when stored at 2-8° C.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification (LoQ)
studies were performed according to CLSI EP-17A.
To establish the Limit of Blank (LoB), three blank samples (human serum based
calibrator 1) were assayed 60 times using two reagent lots over multiple days on two
analyzers. The Limit of Blank was the value at the 95th percentile and was determined to
be 1.6 ng/mL.
To determine the Limit of Detection (LoD), four low level human serum samples, with
concentrations in the range from LoB to approximately 4xLoB, were measured in four
replicates per day for three days on two analyzers using two reagent lots for a total of 48
measurements per sample. The LoD was determined to be 3.2 ng/mL using the following
equation: LoD=LoB + C X SD.
B
To determine the Limit of Quantification (LoQ), four low level human serum samples,
with concentrations in ranging from LoB to approximately 5xLoB, were measured in
replicates of 8 for five days on one analyzer using one reagent lot for a total of 40
measurements per sample. The LoQ claim is 3.3 ng/mL based on a functional sensitivity
at 20% CV.
Detection limits results:
Limit of Blank Limit of Detection Limit of Quantitation
1.6 ng/mL 3.2 ng/mL 3.3 ng/mL
The claimed measuring range of the assay is 4-120 ng/mL.

e. Analytical specificity:
Potential interference from common endogenous substances, as well as potential cross
reactivity of substances with a similar chemical structure as 25(OH) vitamin D, was
evaluated in k123131.
The package insert contains the following limitation: Do not use hemolyzed samples.
Hemolyzed samples will give erroneous results.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed to compare the candidate device
(standardized ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D assay) to the predicate device (non-
standardized ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D assay, k123131). A total of 181 native
serum samples were tested in singleton on an AIA-200 analyzer. Deming regression
analysis was performed and the results are shown below:
Standardized vs non-standardized ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D
N=181 Deming regression (95%CI)
Slope 0.808 (0.801 to 0.816)
Intercept 0.26 (-0.15 to 0.67)
r 0.9979
Range tested 9.4 to 92.3 ng/mL
The slope showed an approximate bias of -20% between the candidate device and the
predicate device; however, this shift is expected because the purpose of the device
modification was to adjust the calibration to better align with the VDSP reference
sample concentration target levels. Therefore, test results from the candidate device
do not, and are not expected to, directly correlate with test results from the predicate
device. Laboratories that use the Tosoh ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D should be
aware of the significantly different performance of the modified assay.
An additional method comparison study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy
between the candidate device and the RMP, University of Ghent’s ID-LC/MS/MS
method. The method comparison against the RMP was the basis of the substantial
equivalence determination. In this method comparison study, a total of 111 unaltered
serum samples value assigned by ID-LC-MS/MS RMP (Ghent University) were
tested in singleton on an AIA-200 analyzer using the candidate device. Results from
the Weighted Deming regression analysis is shown below:

A total of 252 serum specimens from 111 females and 141 males from ages 21 to 86
years were assayed in singleton utilizing the ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D assay on
the AIA-2000 analyzer. The specimens were obtained from the diverse regions of the
United States to represent a broad spectrum of UV light exposure in the intended use
population. The samples were obtained from apparently healthy light skin and dark skin
individuals who were not taking Vitamin D supplements of more than 2000 IU.
Specimens with abnormal PTH, TSH, Calcium, Magnesium and Phosphorus were
excluded from the data. The 95% reference interval was calculated by a non-parametric
