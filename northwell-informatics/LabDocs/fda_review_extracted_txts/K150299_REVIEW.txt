L. Test Principle:
This device is an in vitro diagnostic product intended for the measurement of the glucose
concentration of human capillary whole blood. The principle of the test is based on the
measurement of a small electrical current produced by the reaction of glucose in the blood
sample with the reagents (including a glucose oxidase enzyme) on the test strip. This reaction
produces an electrical current which is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the blood
sample. The current is detected by the meter and converted by the App to a blood glucose value
which is displayed to the user.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
All performance testing for this device was conducted using mobile platforms and operating
system appropriately representative of the mobile platforms and operating systems for use with
this device (Samsung Galaxy S3, S4 and S5 phones and Android operating system version 4.0 or
higher).

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run precision was evaluated using venous whole blood spiked with an aqueous
glucose solution or allowed to glycolyze to generate samples within five different
glucose concentration ranges (30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-200 and 251-400 mg/dL).
Three test strip lots and 20 meters were used for this study. For each test strip lot,
each sample was tested 50 times by each of two operators. The mean values and
coefficients of variation were calculated for each sample and are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated by preparing high and low glucose venous blood samples and
preforming a dilution to achieve 14 evenly spaced glucose levels from 7.6 to 634.6
mg/dL (7.6, 17.4, 27.2, 46.8, 66.4, 76.2, 86, 164.4, 242.7, 321.1, 399.5, 477.9, 556.2,
634.6 mg/dL) as measured by the comparator method (an established laboratory
reference method, YSI 2300 analyzer). Each level was tested in replicates of 5 with
each of three test strip lots, resulting in a total of 15 replicates for each glucose level.
The values from the Gmate SMART Blood Glucose Meter were compared to those
obtained from an established laboratory reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The
results from regression analysis are summarized below:
Lot 1: y = 0.997x + 0.4738, R2 = 0.9999
Lot 1: y = 01.001x - 0.3625, R2 = 0.9999
Lot 1: y = 0.9971x – 0.3239, R2 = 0.9999
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of
20 to 600 mg/dL. The meter displays “Low” with glucose values below 20mg/dL, and
“Hi” with glucose values over 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The system is traceable to NIST standard reference material 917b.
Stability
Test strip closed vial stability:
Stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable
to support a shelf life of 24 months when stored at a temperature ranging from 36°F-
86°F (2°C to 30°C) and between 10%-90% relative humidity.
Test strip open vial stability:
Stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable
to support an open-vial use life of 3 months at a temperature ranging from 36°F-86°F
(2°C to 30°C) and between 10%-90% relative humidity.
Control Solution Stability
The control solutions compatible for use with the current device (Gmate Control
Solutions) were previously cleared, and stability and value assignment were
established in k113636. Control solutions are stable for 3 months when stored in a

cool, dry out of direct sunlight between 40°F to 86°C (4°C to 30°C). Once opened the
controls are stable for 3 months when closed tightly after use and stored between
40°F to 86°C (4°C to 30°C).
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range for the Gmate SMART Blood Glucose Monitoring System is 20
to 600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity study ( see Section M.1.b,
above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Twenty-three endogenous and exogenous substances were screened for interference
by spiking each substance into a venous whole blood sample altered to contain either
a low glucose value of 80-120 mg/dL or a high glucose value of 300-350 mg/dL. The
high and low glucose blood samples spiked with a potentially interfering substance
was diluted with unspiked sample to generate 5 total samples (including the unspiked
sample) with different concentrations of the potentially interfering substance. Each
sample was tested in replicates of 5 on each of 3 strip lots. The % difference between
the spiked samples and the control sample with no substance was calculated. The
sponsor defined no significant interference as bias within ±10%.
The system exhibits no significant interference from the following substances up to
the concentrations listed below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A user evaluation study was performed with 100 lay-users to determine whether
glucose readings from the fingertip, upper arm, forearm, thigh, calf and palm obtained
by a lay-user provided with only the device labeling as testing instructions were
comparable to results from venous whole blood measured using a laboratory glucose
reference method. The labeling provided to the users was in English only. Each
participant performed their own fingerstick or testing of an alternative site using the
device and instructions in the proposed labeling, including the user manual. The
samples ranged in glucose concentration from 55.9 to 449 mg/dL (as measured with
the laboratory reference method, the YSI 2300 analyzer). Results are summarized

N. Instrument Name:
Gmate SMART Blood Glucose Monitoring System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes ____X____ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ____X____ or No ________
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
The applicant has provided documentation that indicates the device was designed and
developed under good software life-cycle processes.
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm, or
forearm only. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are
no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
No user-entered coding or calibration is required for this device. Coding is accomplished
by the storage of code numbers and test strip lot-specific information in the meter, which
can be controlled because the meter manufacturer also manufactures the test strips for
this device. Each test strip code is embedded in the test strips by laser carving each test
strip with a code number pattern, which is recognized by the meter and used for
12

calibration.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at three different concentrations (Levels 1, 2, and 3) are
provided with one kit configuration of the device and also available separately. Device kit
configurations that do not include control solutions indicate that the control solutions are
required but not included and must be purchased separately. Recommendations on when
to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for each
control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the
meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the
Gmate SMART Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using whole blood
samples manipulated to contain hematocrit levels of 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60% and spiked
with glucose or allowed to glycolyze to achieve concentrations between 50 and 325
mg/dL. Each sample was then tested 10 times and the individual values were compared
with those obtained from an established laboratory reference analyzer (YSI 2300
analyzer). The device demonstrated adequate performance to support the hematocrit
claim of 20% and 60%.
2. Altitude study: Venous whole blood samples were collected from four blood donors and
spiked with glucose into four concentration levels (70, 130, 230 and 380 mg/dL). Blood
glucose target concentrations were then verified by comparison to an accepted laboratory
reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The study was performed using a hyperbaric
chamber to simulate altitudes of 3000, 6000 and 10,000 feet. The results demonstrate
acceptable bias relative to the reference method to support the claims that the Gmate
SMART blood glucose monitoring system can be used at altitudes up to 10,000 feet.
3. Temperature and humidity studies: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity
studies using blood samples with three target concentrations of glucose (<75 mg/dL, 100-
200 mg/dL and > 300mg/dL) to evaluate temperatures ranging from 50ºF to 104ºF and
relative humidity from 10% to 90%. Meter results were compared to results from an
accepted laboratory reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer). Four temperature and
humidity combinations, including low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high
humidity, high temperature/low humidity and high temperature/high humidity were tested
using three lots of test strips. No significant effect (relative to an established laboratory
reference method, YSI 2300 analyzer) was observed with any of the temperature and
humidity combinations tested. The results support the claims in the labeling that the
system can be used in temperatures of 50ºF to 104ºF with relative humidity of 10 to 90%.
4. Sample Volume Studies: The sponsor performed sample volume studies using venous
blood altered to five target glucose concentrations (50, 70, 120, 230 and 430 mg/dL). At
each target concentration, samples of different volumes (0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0 µl) were
13

--- Page 14 ---
measured with the device and compared to results from an accepted laboratory reference
method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The results support a minimal sample volume of 0.5µl.
5. Infection Control Studies: The Gmate SMART Blood Glucose Monitoring System is
intended for single-patient use. The sponsor stated that the disinfection efficacy for the
meter was evaluated in k131230 and that the materials comprising the meter are identical
to k131230. CaviWipes disinfecting towelettes (EPA registration # 46781-8), were
validated by an outside testing laboratory to demonstrate complete inactivation of live
virus for use with the Samsung Galaxy S3, S4 or S5 phones. The sponsor also
demonstrated that there was no change in performance of the system or in the external
materials of the Gmate SMART meter or Samsung Galaxy S3, S4 or S5 phones after 520
cleaning and disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one cleaning wipe plus one
disinfecting wipe) to simulate 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for
adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
6. Usability Questionnaire: A usability test was conducted with one hundred lay users.
Each user was provided with a Gmate SMART Blood Glucose Monitoring System and
the proposed labeling and asked to perform a blood glucose self-test and complete a
survey about the ease of use of the device and software. More than 95% of users
indicated a level of satisfaction of “Good” or “Very Good” for each question related to
usability of the device and the instructions, indicating that there are no areas of concern
regarding the usability of the device by the intended users.
7. Software: Software documentation was reviewed and demonstrated that the device was
developed under appropriate software lifecycle processes.
8. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing: The sponsor provided documentation
certifying that appropriate electromagnetic compatibility testing (EMC) had been
performed.
9. Customer service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by calling 1-855-464-6283.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
