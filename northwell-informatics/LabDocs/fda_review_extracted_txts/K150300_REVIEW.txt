Value Assignment:
The mean values and the corresponding ±3SD ranges printed in the package inserts
were derived from replicate analyses and are specific for each lot of product. The
tests listed were performed by the manufacturer and/or independent laboratories using
manufacturer supported reagents and a representative sampling of this lot of control.
It is recommended that each laboratory establish its own means and acceptable ranges
and use those provided only as guides.
Stability Studies:
Real time stability studies were performed to establish thawed and opened stability
claims. Thawed and open vial stability when stored at 2ºC to 8ºC is as follows: N-
terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) is15 days, Troponin 1 is 10
days, B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) is 8 days, Troponin T is 4 days and all other
analytes are 20 days. Frozen aliquot stability is 30 days at when stored at –20ºC to
