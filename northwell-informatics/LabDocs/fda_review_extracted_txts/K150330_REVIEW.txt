M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To evaluate within run and total precision, three lots of Mission Urinalysis Test Strips
(Microalbumin/Creatinine) were used to test urine albumin concentrations of 10, 30,
and 150 mg/L and urine creatinine concentrations of 10, 50, and 300 mg/dL. Within-
run precision was evaluated at 3 point of care (POC) sites by 3 POC personnel testing
each level of the control solution in 20 replicates in one day. Between run precision
was evaluated by 3 POC personnel at each of 3 POC sites testing each of the three
levels in singlet, 2 runs per day, for 20 days. The samples were blind labeled
samples. The exact match block agreement precision study test results are
summarized in the tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
This assay reports color block outputs of 10mg/L, 30 mg/L, 80 mg/L, 150 mg/L for
albumin, and 10 mg/dL, 50 mg/dL, 100 mg/dL, 200 mg/dL, 300 mg/dL for
creatinine.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and Expected values: No calibrators or controls are being cleared with
this submission.
Stability: Real time and accelerated stability studies were performed for closed vial
stability and real time stability study was performed for open vial stability. The study
protocol and acceptance criteria was reviewed and found acceptable. Stability data
support the following manufacturer’s claim: The strip can be stored in 2ºC to 30ºC
(35.6 o F to 30 o F) in closed package to 24 months, opened package stable for at least
3 months from the manufacture date.
Temperature: Studies were performed to validate the optimal temperature range for
testing Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips (Microalbumin/Creatinine) on the Mission
U120 analyzer. The study protocol and acceptance criteria was reviewed and found
acceptable. The temperature study data showed that correct Microalbumin/Creatinine
results can be obtained by the Mission U120 Urine Analyzer at temperatures between
2ºC and 45ºC.
Humidity: Studies were performed to validate the optimal humidity range for testing
Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips (Microalbumin/Creatinine). The study protocol
and acceptance criteria was reviewed and found acceptable. The results
demonstrated that the strips were stable up to 50% humidity for over 24 hrs, and at
humidity conditions above 60%, the strip was stable for 1 hr.
d. Detection limit:
The cutoff of the assay at each color block was validated by spiking or diluting a
pooled urine sample with albumin and creatinine to achieve 4 levels of albumin and 5
levels of creatinine. Each level was further adjusted to concentrations below and
above the midpoint concentration of each of these levels. Each sample was tested by
three operators with 3 lots of strips for 3 days generating 81 data points for each level.
The cutoffs for each color block are defined as the lowest and highest concentrations
of analyte tested at which over 50% of the results are positive for each color block.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed to evaluate the effects of potential interferents
commonly found in urine on the performance of Mission Urinalysis Reagent strips,
using CLSI EP7-A2 as a guide. Testing was done with contrived urine samples at 3
levels of albumin (10, 30, 150 mg/L) and creatinine (10, 100, 300 mg/dL) and
different concentrations of the listed compounds with 3 lots of strips. Interference is
defined as a change in output of ≥ ±1 color block between spiked and unspiked
control sample. The results are summarized in the table below:

Specific Gravity and pH:
To test the effects of specific gravity, 5 fresh urine samples were pooled and
separated into 9 aliquots with approximate specific gravities of 1.000, 1.005, 1.010,
1.015, 1.020, 1.025, 1.030, 1.035 and 1.040. The samples were spiked or diluted to
achieve the desired albumin (10, 80, and 150 mg/L) and creatinine (10, 100, 300
mg/dL) concentrations. Interference was defined by the sponsor as results being ≥ 1
block outside the expected color block. The results showed that urine specific gravity
range of 1.005 to 1.040 does not affect the results of the albumin test, but specific
gravity at 1.000 will generate a false low result on the albumin test. Specific gravity
from 1.000 to 1.030 will not affect the results of creatinine test; however specific
gravity higher than or equal to 1.035 will generate a false high result on the creatinine
test.
To test the effects of pH, 5 fresh urine samples were pooled and separated into 7
aliquots. The pH of the aliquots was adjusted to a range of 4.00 to 10.00 in 1 pH unit
increments and were spiked or diluted with albumin and creatinine, respectively.
Interference was defined by the sponsor as results being ≥ 1 block outside the
expected color block. Samples were tested in replicates of 5, using three lots of each
format of the devices, and results showed that urine pH range of 4.00 to 9.00 does not
affect the results of the albumin test but samples at pH 10.0 would generate false high
results. Urine sample pH from 4 to 10 did not affect the creatinine test results.
The sponsor includes the following in the labeling regarding potentially interfering
substances:
Results of the substances at the indicated concentration were found to interfere with
the albumin and/or creatinine test are summarized in the table below:

The Urinalysis Reagent Strips (Urine) may be affected by substances that cause
abnormal urine color such as drugs containing azo dyes (e.g. Pyridium, Azo
Gantrisin, Azo Gantanol), nitrofurantoin (Microdantin, Furadantin), and riboflavin.
Urine specimen contaminated with soaps, detergents, antiseptics, or skin cleansers
may also affect test results.
For albumin, a pH ≥10.0 or a specific gravity of 1.000 will affect albumin test results;
whereas, a specific gravity ≥1.035 will generate falsely elevated results for creatinine.
Sample Carryover study:
The sponsor performed a carryover study to evaluate the interference of the reagent
pad to each other on the Microalbumin/Creatinine reagent strip when read by the
Mission U120 analyzer. Three concentration of albumin (10, 30, and 150 mg/L) and
creatinine (10, 50, and 300 mg/dL) were tested. The reagent strip was dipped into the
urine sample and removed. The strip was held vertically to allow excess liquid from
the microalbumin pad to run onto the creatinine pad before blotting and testing on the
analyzer. The process was repeated to allow excess liquid from the creatinine pad to
run onto the Microalbumin pad before blotting and testing on the analyzer.
Interference was defined by the sponsor as results being outside the expected color
block. Each urine concentration was tested in replicates of 5. The results of the study
demonstrated no interference between the reagent pads was observed when liquid form
one reagent pad is carried over to another reagent pad and tested on the Mission U120
analyzer.
Dipping/wetting time study:
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate the effect of different dipping and wetting
times of the Microalbumin/Creatinine reagent strip in urine on the Mission U120
Analyzer albumin and creatinine result reading. Three concentration of albumin (10,
30, and 150 mg/L) and creatinine (10, 50, and 300 mg/dL) were tested. The strips
were dipped into the urine samples and allowed to remain in the urine for 2s, 5s and
10s. Then, the strips were removed from the urine sample but allowed to remain wet
(not blotted) for 0 s, 15s, 30s, 60s, 90s, 2min, 3 min, 5 min, and 10 min before placing
the strip on the analyzer for testing. Testing was performed for each time point in
replicates of 5. Interference was defined by the sponsor as results being ≥ 1 block
outside the expected color block. Data from the study showed that to generate the
correct testing results, the optimum ranges of strip dipping time and strip wetting time
for Microalbumin/Creatinine strips are listed below:
Reagent Range of strip dipping time Range of strip wetting time
Microalbumin 0-10s 0s-10 min
Creatinine 0-10s 0s-1 min

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed to evaluate the accuracy of the Mission
Urinalysis Microalbumin/Creatinine Reagent Strips read by the Mission U120 Urine
Analyzer compared to the predicate, the Clinitek Microalbumin Reagent Strips read
by the Clinitek Status Analyzer. Testing was performed at 3 point-of-care (POC)
sites by 9 operators (3 per site). One hundred and twenty total urine samples were
randomly collected from patients at each of the 3 POC sites for a total of 360 native
samples. An additional ten samples at each site (8% of the total number of samples
tested) were contrived to cover the entire measuring range, for an overall total of 390
samples. Each intended user tested approximately the same number of samples at
each site. Three lots of strips were used for the study.
The method comparison data for urine albumin and creatinine testing for each of the 3
sites are shown in the tables below:

Normally, albumin is present in urine at concentrations < 20 mg/L1. Results of 20-200
mg/L may indicate microalbuminuria. It is associated with early-stage kidney disease
when a small amount of albumin, also called microalbumin, is consistently present in
urine. Clinical albuminuria is indicated by results of > 200 mg/L. These levels can be
predictive of albumin excretion rates of 30-300 mg/24 hours and >300 mg/24 hours,
respectively2-3. Exercise, acute illness and fever, and urinary tract infections may
temporarily elevate urinary albumin excretions. Creatinine concentrations of 10-300
mg/dL are normally present in urine.
Albumin is normally present in urine at concentrations of <30 mg albumin/g creatinine.
Microalbuminuria is indicated at a ratio result of 30-300 mg/g (abnormal) and clinical
albuminuria at a ratio of >300 mg/g (high abnormal)4.
