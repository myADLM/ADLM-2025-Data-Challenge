instrument automates sample preparation and results interpretation.
I. Device Description:
The GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System is a non-treponemal test for the qualitative
determination of reagin antibodies in human serum to aid in the diagnosis of syphilis. The
test is also used to detect non-treponemal antibodies in samples serially diluted to establish
titer information. The system consists of the AIX1000 Analyzer and RPR test reagents. The
AIX1000 Analyzer delivers serum from collection tubes into test wells. After the antigen
suspension is added, the test wells are then incubated while being shaken. An onboard
camera is used to create a high resolution image. This image is analyzed by the proprietary
software algorithm to interpret the results.
The RPR test reagents consist of a reactive control, a non-reactive control, and the antigen
suspended in a carbon solution. When the antigen is mixed with sera, if antibodies are
present, they will bind to the antigen and form black flocculants due to the presence of
carbon particles. If no antibodies are present, then the carbon particles remain evenly
distributed.

The antigen used in the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System is a modified VDRL
carbon antigen. The formulation is the same as that established by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC)1 containing 0.03% cardiolipin, 0.9% cholesterol, and 0.21%
lecithin.
The kit also includes untreated sterile 48 well reaction plates, a reactive control, and a non-
reactive control.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision
The within-laboratory precision study was conducted in-house with clinical samples diluted at
the following concentrations: low RPR reactivity (<1:8), moderately reactive (1:16), reactive
(1:64), highly reactive (1:128), and non-reactive serum (the highly reactive sample was a pooled
sample while all the other samples were individual patient sera). Each concentration level was
tested in replicates of nine. These nine replicates were spread across five panels (as shown in
Table 1 below) that were tested every day for five consecutive days by one operator using one
instrument (9 replicates x 5 days = 45 measurements for each concentration tested). The sample
panels were masked and randomized. Reactive and non-reactive controls were run each day of
testing.

The data presented in Table 2 demonstrates acceptable precision when multiple samples of
various concentrations are run on the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System by a single
operator on a single instrument over multiple days.
Reproducibility
To investigate operator-to-operator and instrument-to-instrument variability, six operators, three
instruments, and two runs were tested each day over five consecutive days as outlined in the
testing schedule below (3 instruments x 6 operators x 2 runs per day x 5 days = 180 observations
per panel).

External Controls
The kit contains an external control set, consisting of a non-reactive control (human serum) and a
reactive control (human serum reactive for syphilis). The controls are preserved with sodium
azide (1mg/ml).
Shipping and Storage Stability
1. Fresh vs. Frozen
A fresh vs. frozen study was conducted to demonstrate that freezing does not alter the
performance of human serum samples in the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System. In
this study, 65 RPR non-reactive serum samples were collected within 52 hours from bleed time,
refrigerated, and delivered to GSD. Sixty (60) of the RPR non-reactive samples were spiked to
create RPR reactive samples. Each concentration was spiked using a single RPR reactive patient
sample (e.g., the five 1:8 samples were created using five individual RPR non-reactive samples
spiked with one RPR reactive sample).The 65 member panel consisted of 40 samples (40/65 =
61.5%) having low reactivity (20 samples at 1:2 and 20 samples at 1:4), five samples having a
titer of 1:8, five samples having a titer of 1:16, five samples having a titer of 1:32, five samples
having a titer of 1:64, and five non-reactive samples.
All “fresh” testing was conducted on samples tested within 72 hours from bleed time. All
“frozen” testing was conducted on samples that had been stored at -20°C for 24 hours and then
thawed at room temperature. The qualitative (non-titer) results from frozen samples were
compared with the qualitative results from the fresh samples. Results are summarized in Table 5.
Table 5 – Results from the Fresh vs. Frozen Study
Concentration Level Percent Agreement 95% Confidence Interval
Non-reactive 5/5 = 100% 54.9% - 100%
Low reactivity (1:2) 20/20 = 100% 96.1% - 100%
Low reactivity (1:4) 20/20 = 100% 96.1% - 100%

Reactive (1:62) 5/5 = 100% 54.9% - 100%
These results indicate that it is acceptable to use frozen serum samples as part of the clinical
evaluation for K150358 as their performance was similar to that of freshly collected human
serum.

2. Long and Short Term Sample Storage
The conditions claimed for specimen transport and storage were evaluated for human serum
tested with the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System. In this study, RPR non-reactive
serum samples were collected within 52 hours from bleed time, refrigerated, and delivered to
GSD. The RPR non-reactive samples were spiked with individual RPR reactive samples to create
a four-member panel of low reactivity samples (two samples with a titer of 1:2 and two samples
with a titer of 1:4). These four samples were tested “fresh” (within 72 hours from bleed time) and
then split into two groups that were stored at different conditions (short term storage at 2-8°C or
long term storage at -20°C). For each of the four panel members, three aliquots were evaluated
per storage condition.
• Samples stored at 2-8°C were tested at selected time points up to 11 days (t = 0, 4, 7, and
11 days).
• Samples stored at -20°C were tested at selected time points up to 18 days (t = 0, 4, 11,
and 18 days).
The qualitative (non-titer) results were compared to the results at day 0 (“fresh”). Results are
included in Tables 6 and 7.

The results of this study support the following claims for specimen shipping and storage:
• Human serum stored at refrigerated at 2-8°C for 7 days.
• Human serum stored frozen at -20°C for 14 days.
3. Multiple Freeze Thaw Cycles
Stability after multiple freeze thaw cycles was evaluated for human serum tested with the GSD
AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System. In this study, RPR non-reactive serum samples were
collected within 52 hours from bleed time, refrigerated, and delivered to GSD. The RPR non-

reactive samples were spiked to create an 80 member panel at the following concentrations: 20
samples each at titer levels 1:2 and 1:4, 10 samples each at titer levels 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, and 1:64,
and 10 non-reactive samples. Each concentration was spiked using one RPR reactive sample
(e.g., the ten 1:8 samples were created using ten individual RPR non-reactive samples spiked
with one RPR reactive sample).
All “fresh” testing was conducted on samples tested within 72 hours from bleed time. All
“frozen” testing was conducted on samples that had been stored at -20°C for 24 hours and then
thawed at room temperature. This cycle was repeated twice more for a total of three freeze thaw
cycles. For each freeze-thaw cycle an aliquot was removed and tested. The qualitative (non-titer)
results of each freeze thaw cycle were compared with the freshly tested results. Results are
included in Table 8.

Cross Reactivity
This study was conducted to evaluate potential cross reactivity in the GSD AIX1000 RPR
Automated Test System when non-target antibodies are present (e.g., due to infection or
autoimmune disease). A panel of antibodies from 17 different conditions (10 viral, 3 bacterial,
and 4 autoimmune conditions) was obtained from serum brokers who confirmed the presence of
each disease marker. For each condition, 10-16 individual patient samples were tested. Reactive
and non-reactive controls were run on each day of testing. Results are summarized in Table 9
below.

Interfering Substances
An interfering substance study was conducted to examine if substances that may be present in
serum at high concentrations would affect the performance of the GSD AIX1000 RPR
Automated Test System. The panel consisted of seven endogenous substances and two
prescription drugs that could be used to treat syphilis patients. Five samples, one non-reactive
and four reactive samples from four individual patients (with titers of 1:2, 1:4, 1:16, and 1:64),
were obtained from a serum broker and were tested in the presence (interferents spiked in-house
at the concentration described in Table 6 below) or absence of interferents. The qualitative (non-
titer) result was recorded for each sample. The concentrations selected were recommended in
CLSI EP7-A2 document. Reactive and non-reactive controls were run on each day of testing. For
all interfering substances tested, the RPR reactive samples remained reactive and RPR non-
reactive samples remained non-reactive, therefore, the tested substances did not affect the
performance of the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System. Results are shown in Table 10.

RPR Automated Test System. The study was conducted over three consecutive days on a single
AIX1000 Analyzer. One reactive (1:64), one highly reactive (1:128) and two negative samples
were tested over five runs. The samples used were from individual patients (not pooled). The
qualitative (non-titer) result was recorded for each sample. Highly reactive samples were
alternated with non-reactive samples 96 times per run. All 480 replicates of the negative samples
were reported as non-reactive, therefore, no evidence of carry-over was observed.
f. Assay cut-off:
No numerical value is given by the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System. The instrument
captures an image and the assay software uses an interpretation algorithm to analyze it. The
samples used to validate the assay interpretation algorithm were purchased; reactive samples
obtained from serum brokers and non-reactive samples obtained from a clinical laboratory. The
samples obtained from the serum brokers contained different concentration (titers) of antibodies.
The samples from the clinical laboratory were samples routinely submitted for syphilis test.
In all, 560 samples (280 reactive and 280 non-reactive) were used to demonstrate that the
algorithm correctly identified RPR reactive and non-reactive samples.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison was based on the results from the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated
Test System (which consists of the GSD RPR reagents and the AIX1000 Analyzer)

i. Prospectively Collected Samples
Prospective sample collection was conducted at two geographically distinct (Southeastern and
Western United States) reference laboratories that received samples from local clinics, hospitals,
and doctor’s offices. Testing was conducted at three sites (one in house and two locations that
represented the intended use sites for the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System). For all
testing sites, reactive and non-reactive controls were run on each day of testing. All 765 serum
samples were collected prospectively from patient samples with a physician’s order to perform
syphilis testing. Samples were stored frozen at -20°C for a maximum of 5 months before testing.
12

--- Page 13 ---
All samples that were shipped were transported and stored frozen until testing. All sites
performed their own comparator testing.
All prospectively collected samples were “de-identified,” therefore only pregnancy and HIV
status were recorded. No information regarding gender, age, syphilis stage, or antibiotic use was
available.
Seven hundred and sixty five (765) serum samples were tested on both the GSD AIX1000 RPR
Automated Test System and the comparator device (a commercially available FDA cleared RPR
assay). The initial tests resulted in 26 invalid results (invalid rate = 26/765 = 3.4% with 95% CI:
2.33%-4.93%). All 26 samples were re-tested and gave non-reactive results. The results for the
prospectively collected clinical samples are summarized in Tables 11 and 12 below.

*The two discrepant samples were tested on a third FDA cleared RPR assay. Both samples were non-reactive on the
third RPR assay.
The positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement of the GSD AIX1000 RPR
Automated Test System with the comparator device (along with their 95% confidence intervals)
are 95.5% (95%CI 77.2% - 99.9%) and 99.9% (95% CI 99.3% - 100%), respectively.
To further investigate the serologic status of the non-treponemal antibody positive samples
(NT+), the samples that gave a reactive result either by the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test
System or by the comparator device were further tested on an FDA cleared treponemal (TP)
assay. Of the 21 samples that were non-treponemal antibody reactive on both the GSD AIX1000
RPR Automated Test System and on the comparator device, only 18 (18/21 = 85.7%) had
enough volume for further testing; all 18 samples were positive for TP antibodies. The one
sample that was NT+ on the GSD AIX1000 Automated Test System and RPR non-reactive (NT-
) on the comparator device was negative for TP antibodies. The one sample that was NT- on the
GSD AIX1000 Automated Test System and NT+ on the comparator device was negative for TP
antibodies. The 742 samples that were concordant non-reactive with the test device and the
comparator device did not receive further TP testing (742/765 = 97.0%).
ii. Retrospectively Collected Samples
In addition, 2,246 retrospectively collected samples from patients referred for syphilis testing
were tested on the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System and on the comparator device.
The samples were obtained from two geographically distinct reference laboratories that received
samples from local clinics, hospitals, and doctor’s offices. The samples were collected between
January 2005 and July 2014 (the collection dates for 195 samples were not disclosed) and stored
at -20°C until the time of testing. Samples included 607 men and 666 women 10 to 98 years of

the remaining samples were not disclosed. No information regarding syphilis stage or antibiotic
use was available. All samples were tested in-house by a single operator. Reactive and non-
reactive controls were run on each day of testing. The initial tests resulted in six invalid results
(percent invalid = 6/2,246 = 0.27%). All six samples were re-tested and gave one reactive and
five non-reactive results. The results are summarized in Table 13 below.

are 97.2% (95%CI 95.5% - 98.4%) and 99.1% (95%CI 98.5% - 99.5%), respectively.
To further investigate the serologic status of the non-treponemal antibody positive samples
(NT+), the samples that gave a reactive result either by the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test

iii. Retrospectively Collected Samples from Special Populations
Pregnant Women
In addition, 250 samples that were non-reactive for non-treponemal antibodies (NT-) were
retrospectively collected from pregnant women at one site (Southeastern United States). The age
of these women ranged from 15-44 years old (median = 29 years old) for 163 samples (the age of
the remaining samples were not disclosed). The samples were collected between July 2012 and
August 2013 (the collection dates for 25 samples were not disclosed) and stored at -20°C until
the time of testing. To create non-treponemal antibody reactive (NT+) samples, sera from 30
individual pregnant women were collected and spiked with a pool created by combining highly
reactive RPR positive samples.
Sera from 30 pregnant women were obtained and were tested on an FDA cleared Human
Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) test to confirm the pregnancy status. All sera gave a positive
HCG result. The 30 sera were then spiked with a pool of highly reactive (1:128 and 1:64) RPR
positive samples. No more than 10% of the volume from the sera of pregnant women was
supplanted by spiking. The spiked sera were tested again on the HCG test to confirm a positive
result.
These samples were tested on the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System and on the
comparator device. All samples were tested in-house by a single operator. The identity of the
samples was masked. For all testing sites, reactive and non-reactive controls were tested with the
assay on each day of testing. No invalid results were obtained. The results are summarized in
Table 15 below.

HIV Positive Individuals
In addition, 250 samples that were non-reactive for non-treponemal antibodies (NT-) and 30
samples that were reactive for non-treponemal antibodies (NT+) were retrospectively collected
from HIV positive individuals at four sites (one Southeastern, one Mid-Western, and two
Western States). The age ranged from 19-60 years old (median = 41 years). Sixteen (16) women
and 71 men were included in this group (the age and gender of the other samples were not
disclosed). The samples were collected between February 2012 and June 2015 (the collection
dates for 156 samples were not disclosed) and stored at -20°C until the time of testing.
These samples were tested on the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System and the
comparator device. All samples were tested in-house by a single operator. The identity of the
samples was masked and the samples from HIV positive individuals were randomized with
samples collected from HIV negative individuals. For all testing sites, reactive and non-reactive
controls were tested with the assay on each day of testing. No invalid results were obtained. The
results are summarized in Table 16 below:

Apparently Healthy Individuals
To determine the percentage of RPR reactivity with the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test
System in a population of apparently healthy individuals, 100 serum samples prospectively
collected from healthy individuals not at risk for syphilis and for whom a syphilis test had not
been ordered (samples were submitted to the source laboratories for routine chemistry testing)
were tested with the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System. All 100 samples were non-
reactive with the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System.

The percentage of RPR reactivity with the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test system in the
765 prospective serum samples collected from two geographically distinct regions of the United
States from patients with a physician’s order to perform syphilis testing, 2.9% (22/765) were
reactive with the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System.
Correlation with Clinically Diagnosed Syphilis Sera – Various Stages
A panel of sera samples collected from patients clinically positive for syphilis at various stages
of the disease was purchased from the University of Washington. The sera consisted of treated
and untreated samples at the primary, secondary, and latent stages of syphilis. The age, gender,
and collection dates for the samples were not disclosed. The primary syphilis samples given were
characterized by documented genital lesion with positive dark field microscopy (if performed)
and with reactive treponemal test. The secondary syphilis samples were characterized by
documented rash or mucous patches or candylomata lata with reactive treponemal test. And the
latent syphilis samples were characterized by having reactive treponemal and non-treponemal
test with a non-reactive non-treponemal test for more than a year or for an unknown duration of
infection.
The sera were tested on both the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System and on the
comparator device. The sample panel members were masked and the order of testing was
randomized. There were no invalid results reported for any of the samples tested. The results are
summarized in Table 17 below.
