5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the
device and its components, and the results of the analysis.
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities
required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied. Stability studies
on reagents, calibrators, controls and serum were carried out. Precision and matrix effect studies
were also performed.
c) A “Declaration of Conformity” statement was also submitted for the manufacturing facility
and validation activities and signed by the Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs
Manager, Italy. The statements indicate that:
I. The manufacturing facility is in conformance with design control procedure
requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are available for review.
II. The validation activities, as required by the risk analysis, for the modification were
performed by the designated individuals and the results demonstrated that the
predetermined acceptance criteria were met.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use
for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular
modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices
demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the
design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the
device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
