L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA Centaur TSH3-Ultra assay is a third-generation assay that employs anti-FITC
monoclonal antibody covalently bound to paramagnetic particles, and FITC-labeled anti-
TSH capture monoclonal antibody, and a tracer consisting of a proprietary acridinium ester
and an anti-TSH monoclonal antibody conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) for
chemiluminescent detection. A direct relationship exists between the amount of TSH
present in the patient sample and the amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the
system.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
A pediatric reference range study using population age from 1 month old to 20 years
old was conducted. Serum samples were collected at 8 U.S. sites to be representative of
the U.S. population diversity. Data from a total of 442 pediatric patients (94 infants, 198
children, and 150 adolescents) from one ADVIA Centaur analyzer and three reagent lots
were analyzed to establish the ADVIA Centaur TSH-3 Ultra assay reference ranges for
the studied pediatric population. Results from the 2.5th to 97.5th percentile were used as
the pediatric reference ranges. The reference interval for the infant group was calculated

by performing a log-transformation of the raw data followed by the application of the
robust symmetric method to the transformed data. This approach was selected to be
most appropriate for the smaller sample size as the data from this population was highly
skewed to the right and a transformation was necessary to obtain a normal distribution.
The sponsor has added language to their package insert explaining the uncertainty in the
value for the upper limit of the reference range. A non- parametric approach was used to
establish the reference intervals for children and adolescents based on the CLSI C28-A3
recommendation because the sample size was greater than 120. Reference ranges are
summarized in the table below.
Age Range Reference Ranges
Infants (01 – 23 months) 0.87 - 6.15 µIU/mL
Children (02 – 12 years) 0.67 - 4.16 µIU/mL
Adolescents (13 – 20 years) 0.48- 4.17 µIU/mL
Confidence intervals for the limits of the infant reference range are as follows:

N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
