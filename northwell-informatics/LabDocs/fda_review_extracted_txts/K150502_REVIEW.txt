The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as
LC-MS/MS or GC-MS and permitting laboratories to establish quality control
procedures.
This assay provides a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative
chemical method must be used in order to confirm an analytical result. Gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and Liquid Chromatography/tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) are the preferred confirmatory methods. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test
result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.
The DRI Hydrocodone assay calibrators are intended for the calibration of the DRI
Hydrocodone assay. For in vitro diagnostic use only.
The DRI Hydrocodone assay controls are unassayed quality control material intended for
the use in the DRI Hydrocodone assay to detect and monitor systematic deviations from
accuracy resulting from reagent or instrument defects. For in vitro diagnostic use only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Beckman Coulter AU 680 chemistry analyzer was used to generate data for this
submission.
I. Device Description:
The DRI Hydrocodone assay is supplied as a liquid ready-to-use homogeneous enzyme
immunoassay.
The DRI Hydrocodone Assay is a kit comprised of two reagents, Reagent A and Reagent E,
which are bottled separately but sold together within the same kit.
The Reagent A solution contains: mouse monoclonal anti-hydrocodone antibody, glucose-6-

L. Test Principle:
The DRI® Hydrocodone Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay. The assay uses
specific antibodies that can detect Hydrocodone and its metabolites without any significant
cross-reactivity to other opiate compounds. The assay is based on competition between a
drug labeled with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and free drug from the
urine sample, for a fixed amount of specific antibody binding sites. In the absence of free
drug from the sample, mouse monoclonal anti-hydrocodone antibody binds to the drug
labeled with G6PDH and causes a decrease in enzyme activity. In the presence of free drug,
the free drug occupies the antibody binding sites, allowing the drug bound G6PDH to
interact with the substrate, resulting in enzyme activity. This phenomenon creates a direct
proportional relationship between the drug concentration in urine and enzyme activity. The
enzyme activity is determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by measuring the
conversion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed by one trained operator following the CLSI
(EP5‐A2) precision guidelines. Drug free urine samples were spiked with
hydrocodone at 0, 75, 150, 225, 300, 375, 450, 525 and 600ng/mL, representing 0, 25,
50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175 and 200% of the device cutoff (300 ng/mL). Each level
sample was tested in duplicates per run, two runs per day for twenty consecutive days
(total N= 80/level/reagent lot) using 2 lots on the Beckman Coulter AU680 chemistry
analyzer. The results of one representative lot are shown below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity study in the semi-quantitative mode was conducted by spiking drug free
urine pool with hydrocodone (serial dilutions of a high concentration hydrocodone in
negative urine pool) to achieve concentrations ranging from 0ng/mL to 1000ng/mL,
and testing each level on two reagent lots in replicates of five on the Beckman

Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The primary controls and calibrators are traceable to the 1 mg/mL Hydrocodone stock
solution purchased from a commercial source which is established at 99.9% purity.
The concentration of the primary control and calibrator stocks is confirmed by LC-
MS/MS from three independent laboratories.
Value Assignment – Calibrators and Controls
The primary controls and calibrators are used to prepare secondary controls and
calibrators and the performance testing is performed on AU680 analyzers against the
primary controls and calibrators, in replicates of five. The testing required two
passing runs on two different AU680 analyzers. The preset acceptance criteria is that
replicates have less than or equal to 5% rate (mA/min) difference between the
secondary and the primary controls and calibrators. The concentration of the controls
and calibrators are further corroborated with validated LC-MS/MS and the values
should be within 10% of the nominal values.

Calibrators and Controls Stability Studies
Accelerated a stability studies in the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes were
conducted on three lots of DRI Hydrocodone Controls and DRI Hydrocodone
Calibrators. Real time stability studies are ongoing. The stability protocols and
acceptance criteria for open and closed vial were reviewed and found acceptable. The
open vial and closed vial study results support the open vial stability claim of 60 days
and closed vial stability claim of thirteen months when stored at 2 to 8 ºC for the DRI
Hydrocodone Controls and DRI Hydrocodone Calibrators.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
An analytical specificity study to evaluate interference from non-structurally and
structurally related compounds was performed in the qualitative and semi-quantitative
mode. The study design and results are described below. Results were the same for
each mode (qualitative and semi-quantitative modes).
Structurally Related Compounds and Other Opiates
To evaluate potential cross-reactivity for the DRI Hydrocodone assay, structurally
similar compounds were spiked into drug free urine at concentrations that will yield a
result that is equivalent to the 300ng/mL cutoff. Non-cross-reacting compounds were
titrated to the highest levels yielding negative results in the assay. The percent cross-
reactivity is presented in the table below.

pH and Specific Gravity
For potential interference from the pH of urine, device performance in the qualitative
and semi-quantitative modes was tested using a range of urine pH values (4.0, 5.0,
6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0). All test samples were prepared in drug free urine
containing hydrocodone at ± 25% of the cutoff (225 ng/mL and 375 ng/mL
hydrocodone concentrations). No positive or negative interference was observed at
urine pH values ranging from 4.0 to 10.0 for each test mode.
For potential interference from the specific gravity of urine, device performance in
the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes was tested using a range of urine specific
gravity values (1.000, 1.006, 1.007, 1.010, 1.013, 1.018, 1.021, 1.025, 1.028, 1.034
and 1.036). All test samples were prepared in drug free urine containing
hydrocodone at ± 25% of the cutoff (225 ng/mL and 375 ng/mL hydrocodone
concentrations). No positive or negative interference was observed at urine specific
gravity values ranging from 1.000 to 1.036 for each test mode.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration of 300 ng/mL hydrocodone is described in the precision section, M.1.a.
above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 100 unaltered urine samples from pain management laboratories were
analyzed by two lots of the candidate device in the qualitative and semi-quantitative
modes on the Beckman Coulter AU680 clinical chemistry analyzer and the
comparative mass spectrometry based quantitative method (LC-MS/MS). LC-
MS/MS and immunoassay qualitative results are based on a 300ng/mL cutoff. The
results from the study in the two modes were same and are summarized below:
Qualitative and Semi-quantitative Mode
