L. Test Principle:
Cortisol in the sample and enzyme labelled antigen compete for binding sites of the
antibodies coated onto the microwells. After addition of the luminescence substrate solution,
the intensity of the luminescence measured is inversely proportional to the amount of antigen
in the sample.
All kit standards, control, and patient saliva samples must be run in duplicates.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All performance data were obtained using Sarstedt Cortisol Salivette (Cat#51.1534.500)
saliva collection tube.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Study Protocol:
A precision study based on CLSI guideline EP5-A3 was performed by testing six
assays daily using 3 different reagent lots and two operators. Within each assay, the
high, and low kit controls and 7 saliva pools were used. Each pool consists of the
following: 2 low concentrated cortisol samples (up to 0.3 µg/dL), 2 medium
concentrated cortisol samples (0.3 to 0.8 µg/dL), 2 high concentrated cortisol samples
(0.8 to 1.0 µg/dL) and 1 very high concentrated cortisol samples (1.0 to 3.2 µg/dL)
run in triplicate for 21 days. Total N is 63. The precision results of the statistical
analysis are summarized in the tables below:

levels of endogenous cortisol were spiked with known quantities of cortisol and
assayed. The percent recovery ranged from 93.7% to 109.6%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Study Protocol:
Linearity was evaluated based on the CLSI EP6-A guideline. A high spiked cortisol
saliva sample (3.486 µg/dL) and a low cortisol concentration saliva sample (0.009
µg/dL) were used in the study. Dilutions were prepared from these two saliva
samples to produce intermediate concentrations. A total of 12 levels of cortisol
concentrations (0.009, 0.322, 0.660, 0.949, 1.263, 1.666, 1.886, 2.430, 2.585, 3.017,
3.267, 3.486 µg/dL) were tested with each sample tested in duplicates. Statistical
evaluation using linear regression with 11 levels tested (sponsor excluded the highest
level) showed that the assay is linear from 0.012 – 3.134 µg/dL, yielding a linear
regression result of y = 1.03x-0.05 with r2 = 0.99
The sponsor’s claim measuring range of this assay is 0.012 to 3.0 µg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The assigned cortisol values of the calibrators are traceable to the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) cortisol reference material (code 921).
Value Assignment of Calibrators and Controls
A stock solution was prepared by weighing in a fixed amount of Cortisol. The kit
calibrators are produced from this stock solution. Value assignment of the kit
calibrators is performed with multiple replicates and verification is conducted by
direct comparison with each kit lot calibrators to the NIST reference material.
Target values of the calibrators are: CAL A-G: 0, 0.015, 0.03, 0.10, 0.40, 1.00 and
3.20 µg/dL.
The kit controls are produced similarly to the kit calibrators. The controls are
measured in 5 different runs and in quadruple measurements (reaching 20 values).
The mean is calculated and the controls ranges are defined as ± 18% from mean value
for Control 1 and as ± 15% for Control 2.
Target ranges of controls are:
Control 1 is 0.049 to 0.102 µg/dL
Control 2 is 0.47 to 0.88 µg/dL
6

--- Page 7 ---
Stability of the kit, including calibrators and controls:
Sponsor claimed that the kit is stable unopened for 18 months when stored at 2-8oC.
Once open, the kit is stable for 19 days when stored at 2-8oC. Real-time stability and
open kit stability has been performed. Study protocol and acceptance criteria has
been provided and found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), the limit of detection (LoD), and the limit of quantitation
(LoD) for salivary cortisol was conducted according to CLSI EP17-A guidance
document.
LoB was determined from five contrived samples utilizing 5 different lots of Standard
A, on one analyzer. LoB study was performed using 2 reagent lots, over 3 days, run
in duplicate, one run per day, for a total number of 150 determinations.
LoD was determined from five low salivary cortisol samples (0.007 – 0.023 µg/dL),
on one analyzer, with 2 reagent lots, run in in duplicate, one run per day for 3 days,
for a total number of 150 determinations. Each sample generated a total of 30 values.
LoQ was determined from five salivary cortisol samples (0.006-0.108 µg/dL) on one
analyzer, with 2 reagent lots, run in duplicate, one run per day for 3 days, for a total
number of 150 determinations. Each sample generated a total of 30 values. LoQ is
defined as an inter-assay precision of less than 20% CV.
The LoB was determined to be 0.004µg/dL; the LoD was determined to be 0.012
µg/dL and the LoQ was determined to be 0.012 µg/dL.
This assay has a measuring range of 0.012 to 3.0 µg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference Study Protocol:
The interference study was conducted by spiking three levels of saliva samples (low,
medium and high) with high concentrations of potentially interfering substances. The
study was conducted by spiking the saliva samples with commercially available
interfering substances.

spiked and unspiked sample. Results are summarized in the table below.

The package insert has the following limitations: “The patient should not eat, drink,
chew gum, or brush teeth for 30 min. before sampling. Otherwise, rinse mouth
thoroughly with cold water 5 minutes prior to sample collection. Do not collect
samples when oral disease, inflammation, or lesions exist (blood contamination).”
Cross-Reactivity Study Protocol:
The sponsor evaluated cross-reactivity by using analyte free zero standards.
Cortisol and the cross reactants were spiked into the standards to obtain a suitable
range of concentrations. Two replicates of each contrived sample were tested. Each
of the potential cross-reactive substances were tested in at least 6 different
concentrations between 1-10, 000 µg/dL concentration range.
The % cross-reactivity will be calculated as:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Study Protocol:
A total of 180 human saliva specimens collected using a Cortisol Salivette (Sarstedt
Inc.Cat. 51.1534.500) were collected from one clinical site and used in the method
comparison study against the predicate device (Pantex Cortisol Salivary EIA).
Samples were aliquoted into four 0.2 mL aliquot tubes, frozen and shipped to the
sponsor’s facility. A total of 25 contrived samples were included in the method
comparison to cover the measuring range. Eleven samples were excluded from the
analysis due to the cortisol concentration being outside the measurement range of the
predicate k102841. All testing was performed in-house over 5 days and the samples
were run in duplicate on both candidate device and the predicate device. Samples
range tested from 0.012 to 2.942 µg/dL and results are summarized in the table
below.
