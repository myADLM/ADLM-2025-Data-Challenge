L. Test Principle:
The individual assays for APO and TRF each contain a biomarker specific polyclonal antibody which
forms an immune complex with the target when reacted with a serum specimen. The levels of immune
complexes can be measured turbidimetrically and are proportional to the concentration of biomarker in
the serum specimen for each specific assay. The individual assays for CA 125 II, FSH and HE4 each
use two mouse monoclonal antibodies to their respective biomarkers. The quantity of each biomarker
present is then measured by chemiluminescence emission.
The Cobas 6000 is an automated analyzer with electrochemiluminescence detection. The amount of
analyte in each assay is determined against the calibration curve. Each assay uses its own specific
calibrator and controls.
The user enters results of the five analytes manually into an Excel spreadsheet together with the headers
needed by OvaCalc Software. There is no physical or electronic connection between the immunoassay
devices and the OvaCalc Software. Using an algorithm and the values of these five analytes, the
OvaCalc Software generates a single unit-less numerical score from 0.0 to 10.0.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance: All results met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.
a. Precision: Precision performance of the OVA1 Next Generation test was evaluated in
accordance with CLSI guideline EP05-A2 “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative
Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline.” Five pooled serum samples spanning the OVA1
Next Generation score range (three close to the cut-offs, one low and one high value) were tested
over 20 days, two runs per day, and two replicates per run by multiple operators (equal to 80
replicate determinations per pool). There were no un-evaluable results. Total percent coefficient
of variation (%CV) for all pools is 1.54%.

Reproducibility: Five pooled serum samples spanning the OVA1 Next Generation score range
(three close to the cut-offs, one low and one high value) were tested in duplicate, two runs each
day, over six non-consecutive days, by two operators at each of three sites. Each operator
performed the test on three nonconsecutive days, i.e., operator 1 ran the test on days one, three,
and five; operator 2 ran the test on days two, four, and six. At each site, the test was run with the
same lots of calibrators, kit reagents, and controls for the duration of the study. Each operator
performed the complete analysis of the OVA1Next Generation test for the day on the cobas® 6000
and imported the five biomarkers into Vermillion’s OvaCalc Software for generation of the
OVA1Next Generation score. For an assessment of the components of imprecision in the
reproducibility study, the mean score, SD and %CV of each of the five pools were estimated and
shown in the table below. The overall %CV including all sites was 1.63%.

Each biomarker immunoassay uses its own calibrator and controls. For APO, the method has
been standardized against IFCC SP1‑01 (WHO IRP October 1992). For TRF, the method has
been standardized against BCR470/CRM 470 (Reference Preparation for Proteins un Human
Serum). For CA 125 II, the method is standardized against Enzymun-Test CA 125 II method
which in turn has been standardized against the CA125 II RIA from Fujirebio Diagnostics.
For FSH, the method is standardized against Enzymun-Test FSH method which in turn has
been standardized against the 2nd IRP WHO reference standard 79/549. For HE4, the method
is standardized against the HE4 EIA method from Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc.
ii. Reagent Stability

iii. Specimen Stability
Seven serum pools spanning the OVA1 Next Generation risk score range (two close to the
cut-off, one low and four high values) were tested to determine sample storage and
freeze/thaw stability. The mean, SD, mean change, and %mean change from Day 0 (the day
of specimen collection) were used to describe the OVA1 Next Generation risk score for each
pool stored refrigerated up to nine days or four freeze/thaw cycles. The results support the
following stability claims: fresh serum stored can be stored up to eight days between 2 ̶ 8°C
and may be subjected to four freeze/thaw cycles prior to testing.
d. Detection limit:
The limits of detection and limits of quantitation reported in each assay’s package insert are
summarized in the table below. They were confirmed and incorporated into the algorithm such

e. Analytical specificity:
i. Endogenous Interference:
Three pooled serum samples with low (~3.28), medium (~5.15) and high (~8.50) OVA1 Next
Generation scores were evaluated for interference by hemoglobin, bilirubin (conjugated and
unconjugated), triglycerides and rheumatoid factor. The effect of each interfering substance
on the OVA1 Next Generation score was assessed using a mean of four repeated
measurements on each sample spiked with the potentially interfering substances and
compared to control measurements of samples without the interfering substances but with the
same amount of solvent. Based on the manufacturer’s acceptance limits for non-interference,
none of the interfering substances demonstrated significant interference on the OVA1 Next
Generation score up to the concentrations evaluated.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
For analysis of agreement with the predicate device, a total of 493 preoperatively collected
serum specimens from pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women presenting with an adnexal
mass requiring surgical intervention (refer to the section ‘Clinical Studies’ for a description of
the clinical study and patient demographics) were assayed on both OVA1 Next Generation and
OVA1 Test to generate OVA1 scores. All women had a physician’s pre-surgical assessment
(PA) by a non-gynecological oncologist and clinical prediction of malignant ovarian tumor
(prior to surgery) using the combination of PA and OVA1 score (dual assessment) if either the
PA was malignant or the OVA1 score indicated high risk for finding malignancy on surgery.
The comparison of performance for risk stratification between dual assessment of PA with
OVA1 Next Generation (PA + OVA1 Next Generation) and dual assessment of PA with OVA1
Test (PA + OVA1 Test) for all evaluable subjects, and malignant and benign cases as determined
by pathology is summarized in the table below. Results showed that PA+OVA1 Next Generation
and PA+OVA1 Test agreed on 187 high risk cases and 168 low risk cases for a total percentage
agreement of 355 of 493 cases (72%). For risk stratification agreement of malignant cases,
PA+OVA1 Next Generation and PA+OVA1 Test agreed on 88 high risk cases and 2 low risk
cases (misclassified) for a total percentage agreement of 86 of 92 cases (93.5%). For benign
cases, PA+OVA1 Next Generation and PA+OVA1 Test agreed on the classification of 166 of
401 benign cases (41% of all benign cases) but incorrectly classified 103 benign cases as high
risk (26%). PA+OVA1 Next Generation correctly classified 94 benign cases as low risk which
PA+OVA1 Test classified as high risk (23% of benign cases correctly classified by PA+OVA1
Next Generation but not PA+OVA1 Test). PA+OVA1 Next Generation incorrectly classified 38
benign cases as high risk which PA+OVA1 Test classified as low risk (9% of benign cases
correctly classified by PA+OVA1 Test but not PA+OVA1 Next Generation). Overall,
PA+OVA1 Next Generation showed a net improvement of 14% in the classification of benign
subjects.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical sensitivity and specificity:
The ability of OVA1 Next Generation to contribute to the physician’s pre-surgical assessment
(PA) was evaluated in two studies. The first study used archived serum specimens collected
from a prospective, multi-site clinical study for pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women
presenting with an adnexal mass requiring surgical intervention (Bristow et al. 2013; Ovarian
malignancy risk stratification of the adnexal mass using a multivariate index assay. Gynecologic
Oncology 128; 252-259). The clinical study subject enrollment centers are representative of
institutions where ovarian tumor subjects potentially undergo a gynecologic examination. The
specimens were collected at 27 non-gynecologic oncology practices.
A total of 493 women (age range 18–87) were evaluable in the study. For each patient, an initial
PA was completed by a non-gynecological oncologist, providing the assessment of the patient’s
mass as benign (negative) or malignant (positive) based upon the information available to the
non-gynecological oncologist during their work-up of the patient. The corresponding
histopathology reports were collected after surgery.
Using a preoperatively collected serum sample, the OVA1 Next Generation test score was
determined and the patient was stratified into a low or high risk group for finding malignancy
on surgery. For each patient, the OVA1 Next Generation test result was compared to the
pathology report from biopsied tissue. Malignancy included epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC),
other primary ovarian malignancy, ovarian tumor with low malignant potential, malignancy
extending to, or metastatic to ovaries, and malignancy that neither arose in nor involved the
ovaries. A positive result, indicating high probability of malignancy for pre-menopausal and
post-menopausal subjects was defined as an OVA1 Next Generation high risk result (risk score
value of 5.0 or greater).
Subject enrollment demographics and pathology diagnoses are presented in the table below.

Performance Characteristics for OVA1 Next Generation Alone
The OVA1 Next Generation test is not for use as a stand-alone test. Clinical/imaging evaluation
is needed in order to identify patients in the intended use population (women over age 18,
ovarian adnexal mass present for which surgery is planned, and not yet referred to an
oncologist), for whom the performance characteristics of the test are established. These tables
below compare the performance of the OVA1 Next Generation test to that of the predicate
OVA1 Test as stand-alone tests, despite the fact that both are intended to be used in conjunction
with PA.

There were no differences in the number of primary ovarian malignancies detected between
OVA1 Next Generation and OVA1 Test (61/65 vs. 61/65). One fewer non-ovarian malignancy in
a pre-menopausal woman was classified as high risk by OVA1 Next Generation (sensitivity of
75% or 3/4 for OVA1 Next Generation vs. 100% or 4/4 for OVA1 Test). One fewer Stage I
primary ovarian malignancy (sensitivity of 85.7% or 24/28 for OVA1 Next Generation vs. 89.3%
or 25/28 for OVA1 Test) and one more Stage III primary ovarian was detected (sensitivity of
100% or 25/25 for OVA1 Next Generation vs. 96% or 24/25 for OVA1 Test). The single stage I
missed and the single stage III case picked up by OVA1 Next Generation were both in the post-
menopausal subgroup.

One fewer Stage I primary ovarian malignancy (sensitivity of 85.7% or 24/28 for OVA1 Next
Generation vs. 89.3% or 25/28 for OVA1 Test) and one more Stage III primary ovarian was
detected (sensitivity of 100% or 25/25 for OVA1 Next Generation vs. 96% or 24/25 for OVA1
Test). The single stage I missed and the single stage III case picked up by OVA1 Next
Generation were both in the post-menopausal subgroup.
In the second study, in addition to the long-term archived serum specimens collected from the
multi-site clinical study described above, sensitivities and specificities of OVA1 Next Generation
and OVA1 Test were compared using serum specimens that been stored at -65 °C to -85 °C and
tested for OVA1 Next Generation and OVA1 Test no more than one year after collection. These
samples were acquired from prospective studies that recruited premenopausal and
postmenopausal women presenting with an ovarian adnexal mass requiring surgical
intervention. The purpose of the comparison was to demonstrate that for samples archived less
than one year prior to testing, the OVA1 Next Generation test showed similar sensitivity

The reference interval of OVA1 Next Generation test was determined in 68 pre-menopausal and 84
post-menopausal healthy women (total = 152 evaluable subjects). Ages ranged from 18 to 91 years
and represented whites (84.9%), Hispanic/Latino (7.2%) and African American (5.3%) subjects. The
mean, SD, median, range and 5th to 95th percentile of OVA1 Next Generation scores and the OVA1
Next Generation test results are shown for each group in the table below. It is recommended that
each laboratory establish its own reference range for the population of interest.
