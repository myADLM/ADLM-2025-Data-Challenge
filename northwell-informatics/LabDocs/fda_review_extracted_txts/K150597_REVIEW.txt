L. Test Principle:
The allergen of interest, covalently coupled to ImmunoCAP, reacts with the specific
IgE in the patient sample. After washing away non-specific IgE, enzyme labeled
antibodies against IgE is added to form a complex. After incubation, unbound enzyme-
anti-IgE is washed away and the bound complex is then incubated with a developing
agent. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence of the eluate is measured. The
higher the response value, the more specific IgE is present in the specimen. To evaluate
the test results, the responses for the patient samples are transformed to concentrations
with the use of a calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i. Within-Lot Imprecision
Imprecision of the allergen component was evaluated by using two positive plasma
samples including a low range sample (0.35 ± 25% kU /L) and a high range sample
A
(≥ 0.7 kU /L), each tested in four replicates in one assay run per day for a total of 20
A
operating days (a total of 80 replicates per sample). The assay was performed
according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Directions for Use using Phadia 250
instrument. Between-day and within-run coefficients of variance (%CV) were

ii. Kit Stability
Real-time and Accelerated stability: The stability studies were performed in
accordance with CLSI EP25-A: Evaluation of Stability of In Vitro Diagnostic
Reagents. Accelerated stability studies demonstrated 24 months unopened shelf-
life stability of d202, rDer p 1 dust mite allergen. For real-time stability study,
three lots of ImmunoCAP Allergen Component d202 were stored at recommended
storage temperature, 2–8°C. Two positive plasma samples (0.8 and 1.2 kU /L) and
A
one negative plasma sample (<0.1 kU /L) were tested at different occasions
A
according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use, using Phadia 250
instrument. The study is ongoing.
Accelerated stability was assessed with three lots of ImmunoCAP Allergen
Component d202 stored at 30°C and tested after four and eight weeks using two
positive plasma samples and one negative plasma sample. The same lots stored at
2–8°C were used as reference. The results support the manufacturer’s claim of 24
months.
The stability of the calibration curve, real time and on-board stability of
ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Calibrators are detailed in K100999.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and the Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined for d202,
rDer p 1 allergen component on the Phadia 250 instrument according to CLSI EP17-A
guideline. The LoB was based on single determinations of 100 negative samples
(blank samples) and was estimated as the 95th percentile of the distribution. LoD was
calculated according to the equation: LoD = LoB + c SD where SD, the standard
βx
deviation, was based on 20 determinations of three low positive samples, in total 60
determinations (20 determinations of three low positive samples). The results are
shown in the table below.

The allergen solution was serially diluted with buffer to show an overall dose
dependent inhibition. The unrelated allergen solutions were not further diluted.
Equal volumes of a positive sample and varying dilutions of allergen solution
(inhibitor) were premixed. The mixture was incubated in a sample tube at room
temperature for one hour before being analyzed with the corresponding
ImmunoCAP Allergen Component on Phadia 250 instrument according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The testing was performed in duplicate in one assay
run and mean values were calculated.
The inhibition test was evaluated with inhibition values in %, calculated according
to the formula below:
1 -
r -b
X 100 =i %
t-b
r = response [RU]
b = background response (100% inhibition) [RU]
t = total response (0% inhibition) [RU]
i = inhibition
The results of the inhibition with the allergen solution and the unrelated inhibitors
indicate that ImmunoCAP Allergen d202; Allergen component rDer p 1, House
dust mite contains the immunologically relevant allergen as shown below:
The House dust mite d202, rDer p 1 allergen inhibition study showed that ≥ 85%
inhibition was achieved with the related inhibitor (rDer p1 allergen) at a final
inhibitor concentration of 40 µg/mL. The inhibition studies using three unrelated
inhibitors, including three from unrelated groups (rPla l 1, Plantain; rPla a 1,
London Plane; and rFel d 2, Cat) and one from the related/same group (rDer p 2,
House dust mite) did not show any significant inhibition at the highest inhibitor
concentration of 0.4 mg/mL. The inhibition studies indicate that the ImmunoCAP
Allergen d202, rDer p1, House dust mite solid phase contains the immunologically
relevant allergen.

ii. Interference
a. Endogenous Substance Interference
In order to demonstrate that icteric, hemolytic or lipemic samples do not
adversely affect the results in ImmunoCAP Specific IgE assays using
representative allergens, bilirubin C [final concentration (fc) 20 mg/dL],
bilirubin F (fc 19 mg/dL), hemoglobin (fc 489 mg/dL) and chyle (1,440
Formazine Turbidity Units) were spiked and analyzed in duplicate in one assay
run using Phadia 250. The results demonstrate that icteric, hemolytic or
lipemic samples do not adversely affect the results in ImmunoCAP Specific IgE
assays.
b. Exogenous Substance Interference
Two literature references were provided to support that commonly prescribed
"allergy medications" do not interfere with ImmunoCAP Specific IgE. The
references included (i) Robert G. Hamilton, Accuracy of US Food and Drug
Administration-cleared IgE antibody assays in the presence of anti-IgE
(omalizumab), J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2006; 759– 766, and (ii) Linda Cox et
al., Pearls and pitfalls of allergy diagnostic testing: report from the American
College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology/American Academy of Allergy,
Asthma and Immunology Specific IgE Test Task Force, Annals of Allergy,
Asthma & Immunology, 2008; 101:580–592.
f. Assay cut-off
Limit of Quantitation for ImmunoCAP Specific IgE is 0.10 kU /L. All results > 0.1
A
kU /L are interpreted as being analytically positive.

2. Comparison Studies
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Refer to clinical studies
b. Matrix comparison:
Demonstration that different sample matrices (heparin plasma, EDTA plasma and
serum) are interchangeable for representative ImmunoCAP Allergen Components was
provided in the clearance for K101251. Serum, sodium heparin plasma, and EDTA
plasma samples were collected from four patients with known clinical history of
specific allergies and four non-atopic patients. The samples contained specific IgE
antibodies for one or more of the allergen components tested. All sample matrices
(heparin plasma, EDTA plasma and serum) from each patient were tested with
ImmunoCAP Allergen Components in two replicates in one assay run using Phadia
250 instrument. Mean concentration values for each sample matrix were calculated.
Mean logarithmic ratios for 17 results were -0.022 (Plasma heparin/Serum) and 0.054

(Plasma EDTA/Serum). The results from the study show that samples of different
matrices (heparin plasma, EDTA plasma and serum) are interchangeable for
ImmunoCAP Allergen Components.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical sensitivity and specificity:
The performance of ImmunoCAP allergen d202 components, rDer p 1 and nDer p 1,
was compared. The objective of this study was (i) to demonstrate that the rDer p 1
Allergen Component d202 performs as well as the currently cleared product using
samples with clinical information of house dust mite allergy, and (ii) to demonstrate
that samples from healthy, non-atopic donors with no reported clinical reaction to the
allergen have undetectable or very low levels of specific IgE to the rDer p1 component
of ImmunoCAP Allergen d202. At least 35 clinical serum samples (atopic) from
individuals with a clinical history of allergy-like symptoms upon exposure to the
allergen, as diagnosed by a physician, were used in the study. Information about
clinical symptoms and manifestations was available for all clinical samples. A total of
100 negative (non-atopic) samples (< 0.35 kU /L) from healthy non-atopic donors with
A
no reported clinical reaction to the allergen were also tested. The assay was performed
according to ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Directions for Use using Phadia 250
instrument. Results are presented in the table below:
