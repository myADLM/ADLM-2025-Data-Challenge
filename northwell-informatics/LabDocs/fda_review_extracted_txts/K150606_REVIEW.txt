2. Indication(s) for use:
Emit® II Plus Buprenorphine Assay.
Emit® II Plus Buprenorphine Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay with a 5
ng/mL cutoff. The assay is intended for use in laboratories for the qualitative and/or
semi-quantitative analyses of buprenorphine in human urine. Emit® II Plus assays are
designed for use with a number of chemistry analyzers.
The semi-quantitative mode is for the purpose of enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as
LC/MS or permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.
The Emit® II Plus Buprenorphine Assay provides only a preliminary analytical test
result. A more specific alternative chemical method(s) must be used to obtain a
confirmed analytical result. GC/MS and LC/MS are the preferred confirmatory methods.
Other chemical confirmation methods are available. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be applied to any drug-of-abuse test result, particularly
when preliminary positive results are used.

I. Device Description:
The Emit® II Plus Buprenorphine assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay with a 5
ng/mL cutoff. The assay, used for the detection of Buprenorphine in human urine, utilizes a
2

--- Page 3 ---
two-reagent system. The Antibody/Substrate Reagent 1 is a liquid ready-to-use product
comprised of mouse monoclonal antibodies to buprenorphine, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P),
and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in a diluent containing bovine serum albumin
(BSA), preservatives and stabilizers. The Enzyme Reagent 2 is a liquid, ready-to-use product
containing norbuprenorphine labeled bacterial recombinant glucose-6 phosphate
dehydrogenase (rG6PDH) in a diluent containing bovine serum albumin (BSA), Hepes
buffer, preservatives and stabilizers.
The assay kit consists of Reagent 1 and Reagent 2 in plastic containers and is available in
three sizes: large kit (1L), small kit (115 mL), and 28 mL kit. Emit II Plus assays are
designed for use with a number of chemistry analyzers.
The Emit® II Plus Buprenorphine assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A
more specific alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical
result.
Calibrators and controls are sold separately.

L. Test Principle:
The Emit® II Plus Buprenorphine Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay technique
used for the analysis of a specific compound in human urine. The assay is based on
competition between drug in the specimen and drug labeled with the recombinant glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (rG6PDH) for antibody binding sites. Enzyme activity decreases
upon binding to the antibody, so the drug concentration in the specimen can be measured in
terms of enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)
to NADH in the presence of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), resulting in an absorbance change
that is measured spectrophotometrically. Endogenous serum G6PDH does not interfere
because the coenzyme NAD functions only with the bacterial (Leuconostoc mesenteroides)
enzyme employed in the assay.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted using urine pools spiked with Buprenorphine into
drug free human urine at 8 concentrations. For each level, samples were analyzed in
duplicate twice a day, for 20 days (N=80). Precision data were calculated according
to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Guidelines EP5-A2. Results
are summarized in tables below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Emit® II Plus Specialty Drug Calibrator/Control is traceable to Cerilliant
Buprenorphine Cat. No. B-902. This stock solution is used directly to prepare Master
pools. The secondary stock solution is then spiked into the calibrators and controls to
the desired concentration. The concentrations are confirmed by LC/MS/MS.
Stability Studies:
Real time and on-board stability studies for both controls and calibrators were
conducted. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The manufacturer claims the following expiration date for both controls
and calibrators:
Real-time stability studies show that when stored at 2-8 ºC, open and unopened
product is stable for nine months. Real time stability studies are on-going to support a
12 month shelf life stability claim.
Testing supports on-board storage stability of over 30 days.

Buprenorphine Metabolite Recovery:
Buprenorphine and the buprenorphine metabolites norbuprenorphine, buprenorphine
glucuronide and norbuprenorphine glucuronide were spiked into aliquots of drug free
urine at the levels shown and run at N=5 replicates. The samples were assayed and

Endogenous Substances Interference:
Each compound was spiked into a -40% cutoff and a +40% cutoff concentration pool
which ware prepared by spiking buprenorphine to aliquots of drug-free human urine.
The results show that the tested endogenous substances at the levels tested caused no
interference relative to the 5 ng/mL cutoff. Qualitative and semi-quantitative results
are provided in the table below.

Specific Gravity and pH:
Negative urine pools with specific gravity values ranging from 1.002–1.035 and pH
values ranging from 3.0–11.0 were tested in the presence of two levels of controls at
+/- 40% (3 and 7 ng/mL) of the cutoff concentration. All samples were tested in
triplicates and no interference was observed.
f. Assay cut-off:
Analytical performance of the device around the claimed cutoff is described in
precision section (1 a.) above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
One-hundred twenty seven (127) unaltered human urine samples were qualitatively
and semiquantitatively evaluated using the Emit® II Plus Buprenorphine Assay on
the Viva-E® analyzer and compared with the results obtained by the reference
method – LC/MS/MS. Two replicates were run on each sample on one reagent lot.
The results are presented below:
