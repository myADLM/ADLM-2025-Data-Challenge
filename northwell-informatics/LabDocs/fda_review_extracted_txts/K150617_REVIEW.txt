L. Test Principle:
Target Selection
The cobas® HSV 1and 2 Test utilizes real-time PCR technology to detect the conserved
regions of HSV-1 Thymidine Kinase and HSV-1 DNA Polymerase as well as HSV-2
Thymidine Kinase and HSV-2 Glycoprotein B genes. Fluorogenic target-specific probes are
used for the detection of the amplified HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA as well as Internal Control.
Since two HSV type targets are detected with different fluorescent dyes, the cobas® HSV 1
and 2 Test has the ability to simultaneously detect and differentiate HSV-1 and HSV-2.
Primer and probe oligonucleotide sequences were designed to select HSV-1 and HSV-2
conserved sequences without cross reacting to other viruses, or other bacterial organisms
commonly found in human genital areas.
Sample Preparation
Sample preparation for the cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test is automated with the use of the cobas
x 480 instrument. Organisms from swab specimens collected in MSwab medium are lysed®
with chaotropic agent, proteinase K, and SDS reagents. Released nucleic acids, along with
added Internal Control DNA, are bound by magnetic glass particles. The particles are washed
and the bound nucleic acids are then eluted into a small volume of buffer. The instrument
then takes an aliquot of the eluted material and sets up the PCR reaction with an activated
Master Mix.
PCR Amplification and TaqMan® Detection
The PCR cycling steps and detection of target signal occurs in the cobas z 480 Analyzer.
The Master Mix reagent contains primer pairs and probes for HSV-1, HS®V-2 and Internal
Control targets. If the target nucleic acid sequences are present, amplification with the
corresponding primers will occur by a thermostable DNA polymerase, generating PCR
products (amplicons). These products are detected by specific TaqMan probes containing a
fluorescent dye and a quencher. Normally, the quencher suppresses the fluorescence of the
dye. However, if the PCR product is present, the probe hybridizes to the product and is
subsequently cleaved by the 5′ to 3′ nuclease activity of the polymerase. This reaction allows
the fluorescence to be emitted from the dye, and the signal is recorded in real time during
each PCR cycle by the cobas z 480 analyzer. The signal is interpreted by the cobas 4800
System Software and reported® as final results. ®
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test on the cobas® 4800 System was
established at three sites using contrived clinical samples evaluated across lot, site/instrument,
operator, day, and run. HSV test panels were prepared by spiking HSV-1 (Maclntyre
strain) and/or HSV-2 (G strain) into contrived sample matrix in transport media at one of
three concentrations (Below LOD, 1 × LOD, and 3 × LOD); HSV-1 and HSV-2 negative
panel members were included as panel member controls. In all, there were 6 members per
5

--- Page 6 ---
test panel with 3 replicates per panel member included in each run, not including external
positive and negative assay controls. Panels were tested at 3 sites by 2 operators per site
with 1 valid run per operator per day, for 6 days per lot over 2 lots for 216 tests per panel
member.

b. Precision:
The precision studies were conducted using three lots of reagents and three instrument for
a total of 36 runs over 12 days. A six member study panel was prepared by spiking
cultured HSV-1 (Maclntyre strain) and/or HSV-2 (G strain) virus into contrived sample
matrix in transport media. The results from the precision study are presented in the tables
below.

d. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Assay Controls
Positive Control (PC): The Positive Control (PC) contains non-infectious DNA
plasmids of both HSV-1 and HSV-2. The PC monitors the nucleic acid extraction,
amplification, and detection steps in a given run of the test.
Negative Control (NC): The Negative Control (NC) contains a buffer solution. The
NC is processed in each run that contains a batch of HSV specimens and should
invalidate the run if there is contamination during the assay process that results in a
positive signal in any of the assay target detection channels and/or if Internal Control
signal is negative or invalid.
Internal Control: The Internal Control is a lambda phage molecule that contains
randomized sequences and targets for IC-specific primers and probe. The IC is added
to all specimens and the positive and negative Controls during sample preparation on
the cobas® x 480 instrument. The IC monitors nucleic acid extraction, amplification,
and detection steps for a given specimen. The IC is also required for validation of the
run controls.
e. Analytical Sensitivity (Limit of Detection)
The analytical sensitivity (Limit of Detection or LOD) for the cobas® HSV 1 and 2
Test was determined by analyzing quantified HSV-1 and HSV-2 viral cultures diluted
at multiple concentration levels into a simulated anogenital lesion swab matrix. The
simulated matrix composed of mucin and human cells and mimics the effect of the
clinical anogenital background for the cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test. All levels were
tested with at least 21 replicates using the full cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test workflow
across five lots of cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test reagents. The LoD of the cobas® HSV 1
and 2 Test is defined as the target concentration which can be detected as positive in ≥
95% of the replicates tested, based on results generated by the worst performing lot.

Analytical Inclusivity: In addition, four HSV-1 strains (VR-260, VR-733, VR-735
and VR-1493) and three HSV-2 strains (VR-1779, VR-1781 and VR-540) were tested
for reactivity with the cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test. These strains were obtained from
ATCC and were cultured and quantified by Virapur, LLC (California, US). Each strain
was diluted in a similar fashion as described in the Limit of Detection Section and
was tested in 40 replicates near the LoD. All strains were detected by the assay,
demonstrating that the cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test can detect a broad range of both
HSV-1 and HSV-2 strains.
f. Analytical Specificity/Cross Reactivity and Microbial Panel:
The analytical specificity/cross reactivity of the cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test was
assessed by testing a panel of organisms that could be present in anogenital swab
specimens. The panel consisted of bacteria, fungi viruses, human cells, and HSV-1
and HSV-2. Testing was performed with the organisms alone to determine the
analytical specificity of the cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test or in the presence of HSV-1
and HSV-2 at three times of the LoD to assess the potential interference of the
organisms cells on detection of HSV-1 and HSV-2 by the cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test.
All samples were prepared by diluting microorganisms or DNA into M4RT viral
transport medium prior to testing for cross-reactivity.
All organisms, human cells, HSV-1 and HSV-2 viruses were spiked to 1 x 106
Units/mL or higher except for Treponema pallidum; Chlamydia trachomatis serovar
H, and Mycoplasma genitalium which were spiked to lower concentrations due to
stock concentration limitations.
All bacteria were quantified as Colony Forming Units (CFU) except Chlamydia
trachomatis serovar H and Chlamydia trachomatis serovar I which were quantified
as Inclusion Forming Units (IFU); Toxoplasma gondii and Treponema pallidum which
were quantified as DNA copies and Trichomonas vaginalis which was quantified in
cells.
Cytomegalovirus (HHV5), Human Herpes Virus 6B Strain Z29, Human Herpes Virus
7 Strain SB, Echovirus 11, Human enterovirus 71 and Rubella Virus were quantified
as TCID units/mL; HHV-6A strain GS, HSV-1 and HSV-2 were quantified as viral
50
particles, HIV-1 Strain IIIB and HBV were quantified as International Units (IU).
HIV-2 Strain NIH-Z, Epstein-Barr Virus (HHV4), Varicella-Zoster Virus (HHV3) and

HPV plasmids (HPV11, HPV16, HPV18, HPV6) were quantified as DNA copies.
Two sources of Human Herpes Virus 8 were used, one was quantified as DNA copies
and the other was quantified in cells and estimated as 150 DNA copies per cell.
Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) were quantified as number of
cells.
No microorganisms tested positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2 using the cobas® HSV 1 and
2 Test when there was no HSV-1 and HSV-2 target present indicating no cross
reactivity with these microorganisms. In addition, none of the organisms or a high
concentration of human cells interfered with the detection of HSV-1 and HSV-2
targets. A high concentration of HSV-1 (1x106 vp/mL) did not produce false positive
HSV-2 results and a high concentration of HSV-2 (1x106 vp/mL) did not produce
false positive HSV-1 results.

g. Interfering Studies
This study was performed to evaluate potential interference with the cobas® HSV 1
and 2 Test with twenty commonly used over the counter (OTC) products and anti-
viral medications, as well as whole blood, human serum albumin, urine, feces, and
mucin. All OTC products were tested at or above (20 mg or 40 mg per swab for solids
and 100% of swab capacity for liquids) the levels that could be reasonably expected
to be collected by a swab in an anogenital lesion specimen. Anti-viral medicine was
tested at 3 x Cmax (maximum concentration of the drug as defined in the drug’s
labeling) in the collected specimen. HSV-1 and HSV-2 were spiked at ~ 3 x LOD
(Limit of Detection) of the cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test and used as targets in the tests.
No interference was observed for the OTC products except for Vagisil Crème
(interference observed at 10 mg and above). For whole blood, no interference was
observed up to 40% of the swab capacity; for mucin, no interference was observed up
to 4.8 mg per swab: for urine, no interference was observed up to 100% of the swab
capacity; for feces, no interference was observed up to 1.6 mg per swab and for
human serum albumin, no interference was observed up to 16 mg per swab. The
results are summarized in the table below.

h. Competitive Inhibition
Competitive inhibition of the cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test was evaluated to assess the
potential interference in HSV-1/2 target detection when both HSV-1 and HSV-2 are
present in a sample. The panels were constructed with HSV-1 at ~ 3 x LOD (Limit of
Detection), and competing HSV-2 at ~ 300 x LOD of the cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test;
and vice versa. One hundred fold higher concentration of HSV-1 did not affect the
detection of HSV-2 at approximately 3 x LOD concentration and one hundred fold
higher concentration of HSV-2 did not affect the detection of HSV-1 at approximately
3 x LOD concentration.
i. Carry-over/Cross Contamination
The “worst case use scenario” cross contamination rate for the cobas® HSV 1 and 2
Test was assessed by testing HSV-2 high positive and negative samples that were
processed in a checkerboard configuration on cobas® 4800 system. High positive
samples were prepared by adding HSV-2 plasmid (DNA) to MSwab medium to
generate a Ct that exceeded the signal obtained in specimens from 95% or more of
infected patients in the intended use population.
Five runs were performed on each of the three cobas® 4800 systems. The first run on
each system contained only the negative samples to confirm that the instrument was
clean. The three subsequent runs had alternating positive and negative samples in
checkerboard configurations to assess the cross contamination rate. The last run
contained only the negative samples to assess the carry-over contamination rate.
In the nine checkerboard runs, 5 out of 422 HSV negative samples exhibited HSV-2
positive results, for an observed cross-contamination rate of 1.18%. All results in the
last 3 runs containing only the negative samples were negative, suggesting that there
was no carry-over run-to-run contamination.

The performance of the cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test was compared to the composite
reference method comprised of culture using the ELVIS® HSV ID/Typing Test
System (Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc.) and PCR followed by bidirectional sequencing.
The clinical performance of the cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test was also compared to the
culture method alone using the FDA cleared ELVIS® HSV ID/Typing Test System.
Clinical Performance
The clinical performance of the cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test was established in a
prospective, multi-site, investigation using the combined results of culture and PCR
followed by bi-directional Sanger sequencing as the reference method. In addition,
the performance of the cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test was also compared to the culture
method alone using the ELVIS® HSV ID and D³ Typing Test System.
A total of 408 prospective specimens (205 female and 203 male) were tested by the
cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test and compared to the combined results of culture (ELVIS®
HSV ID/Typing Test System) and PCR followed by bidirectional sequencing. Two
external anogenital swab specimens were collected from symptomatic eligible male
and female subjects 17 years of age or older attending family planning, OB/GYN and
sexually transmitted disease clinics at eight geographically diverse sites (seven across
the United States and one in the United Kingdom). The first swab was used for (a)
culture by the ELVIS® HSV ID and D³ Typing Test, (b) PCR followed by bi-
directional Sanger sequencing for HSV-1 and HSV-2, and (c) discordant analysis by
using an FDA cleared nucleic acid amplification test. The second swab was for the
cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test.
Comparison with composite reference method (culture and Sanger sequencing)
A total of 408 prospective specimens collected from 205 female and 203 male
subjects were evaluated in the study. There were 243 HSV positive subjects;

a Of the 4 specimens with HSV-1 false-positive cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test results relative to the Reference Method, 2 were HSV-
1 positive by a FDA-cleared nucleic acid amplification test.
b Of the 6 specimens with HSV-1 false-negative cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test results relative to the Reference Method, all 6 were
HSV-1 negative by a FDA-cleared nucleic acid amplification test.
c Of the 13 specimens with HSV-2 false-positive cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test results relative to the Reference Method, 5 were
HSV-2 positive by a FDA-cleared nucleic acid amplification test.
d Of the 5 specimens with HSV-2 false-negative cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test results relative to the Reference Method, all 5 were
HSV-2 negative by a FDA-cleared nucleic acid amplification test.
Comparison with culture
The clinical performance of the cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test was compared to the
culture method alone using the ELVIS® HSV ID and D3 Typing Test system. The
ELVIS® HSV ID and D3 Typing Test system used in this study is unable to detect
patients co-infected with HSV-1 and HSV-2 and cannot detect HSV-1 if HSV-2 is
detected first. Consequently, if a specimen was positive for HSV-2, it was removed
from the calculation of the HSV-1 clinical performance. Only HSV-2 negative
anogenital specimens were detected for HSV-1. Therefore, the number of samples
used for the calculation of HSV-1 clinical performance equals the total number of
specimens (408) minus the number of samples positive for HSV-2 by culture (129).

a The reference viral culture and typing method (ELVIS® HSV ID and D3 Typing Test system) used in this study is unable to
detect co-infected patients. Only HSV-2 negative specimens can be typed for HSV-1. Therefore, the number of samples used
for the calculation of HSV-1 clinical performance equals the total number of evaluable specimens (408) minus the number of
samples positive for HSV-2 by culture (129) for 279 evaluable specimens.
b Of the 13 specimens with HSV 1 false-positive cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test results relative to the culture and typing, 6 were
HSV-1 positive by a FDA-cleared nucleic acid amplification test and 4 of which were also HSV-1 positive by Sanger
sequencing; 5 additional samples were HSV-1 positive by Sanger sequencing alone.
c Of the 47 specimens with HSV 2 false-positive cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test results relative to the culture and typing, 32 were
HSV-2 positive by a FDA-cleared nucleic acid amplification test.
d The one specimen with a HSV 2 false-negative cobas® HSV 1 and 2 Test result relative to the culture and typing was HSV-2
negative by a FDA-cleared nucleic acid amplification test.

3. Specimen Identification:
Specimens are identified using barcodes on specimen vials.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimens are placed on the cobas x 480 instrument as open tubes and specimen
processing is fully automated. After completion of specimen processing, the user
transfers the plate carrier to the cobas z 480 instrument for automated amplification and
detection. Specimens can be processed directly from primary collection vials or as
aliquots of the specimen in secondary vials. See section I for more information on
specimen handling.
5. Calibration:
No calibration is required by the user. Roche technicians perform calibration periodically
as required.
6. Quality Control:
See section M.1.d for information on internal and external controls.
