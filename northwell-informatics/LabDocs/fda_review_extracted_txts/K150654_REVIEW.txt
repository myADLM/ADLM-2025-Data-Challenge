L. Test Principle:
Cholesterol esters in serum are completely hydrolyzed by cholesterol esterase to free
cholesterol and free fatty acids. The cholesterol liberated by the esterase, plus any endogenous
free cholesterol, are oxidized by cholesterol oxidase to yield hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which
then reacts oxidatively with phenol and 4-aminoantipyrine (AAP) in a reaction catalyzed by
peroxidase, producing a red colored quinoneimine complex. The amount of colored complex
formed, determined by quantitatively measuring the increase in absorbance at 510 nm/700 nm, is
directly proportional to the cholesterol concentration in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the Cholesterol test system was evaluated according to CLSI EP5-A2.
Two reagent lots and 2 RX Daytona Plus analyzers were utilized in the study. A
native patient serum pool, altered serum sample pools, control pools and a calibrator
serum sample were all evaluated. Two replicates of the serum samples were tested on
two separate runs per day for 20 days, leading to the generation of 80 data points for each
sample. The results of one representative lot are shown below:

series of serum samples containing the cholesterol analyte. Samples were prepared
by mixing a high spiked serum sample with a low diluted serum sample to obtain 11
samples with concentrations spanning the claimed measuring range, 25 to 618 mg/dL.
Each level was analyzed in replicates of five using two lots of Randox Cholesterol
reagent on one RX Daytona Plus analyzer system. The results of the linear regression
analysis of one representative lot are shown below:
y = 1.00x - 5.49; r = 0.999
The RX Daytona Plus analyzer is capable of auto diluting with a 1:15 dilution factor
when measuring samples > 619 mg/dL, and an auto-dilution study was conducted
against a manual dilution and all results were within a pre-specified acceptance
criteria.
The reportable range of the assay is 25 - 618 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The controls and calibrator to be used with this assay are manufactured by Randox
Laboratories. Calibrator (Randox Calibration Serum Level 3) and controls (Randox
Assayed Multisera Level 2 and Level 3) were previously cleared in k053153 and
k942458 respectively. Randox Calibration Serum Level 3 is traceable to Cholesterol
reference material NIST 1952a.
Stability Studies:
Stability of the Cholesterol kit is based on real-time stability study data of three kit
lots. The stability study protocol and acceptance criteria was reviewed and found to
be acceptable. The real time stability study supports a shelf life stability of 24 months
when materials are stored at 2-8ºC. Once opened, the kit is stable for 28 days at 2-
8ºC.
d. Detection limit:
A detection limit study was performed according to CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. Limit
of Blank (LoB) was determined by running 4 blank samples (serum based matrix free
of analyte) in 20 replicates across 3 days giving 60 determinations in total on the RX
Daytona Plus analyzer, and LoB was the value at the 95th percentile. The Limit of
Detection (LoD) was determined by evaluating 4 diluted patient serum sample pools
in 20 replicates across 3 days for a total of 60 data points on a RX Daytona Plus
analyzer. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined by running 4 diluted patient
serum sample pools in 12 replicates across 5 days yielding a total of 60 results.
Sponsor defines the LoQ as the lowest analyte concentration where the %CV is ≤
20%.
Analyte LoB LoD LoQ
Cholesterol 3.1 mg/dL 6.31 mg/dL 23.2 mg/dL
The claimed measuring range is 25 - 619 mg/dL for the Randox Cholesterol Assay.

Interference testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP-7A2 with 2 different
concentrations of cholesterol (150 mg/dL and 250 mg/dL) using one RX Daytona
Plus analyzer and one reagent lot. Samples with added potential interferents were
tested in replicates of 10, and the mean recoveries were compared to samples without
interferent. The sponsor defined no significant interference as ≤10 % difference from
the control sample.
Summary of interference study showing highest concentration that does not interfere:
Interferent Concentration at which no
interference was observed
Hemoglobin 750 mg/dL
Total Bilirubin 60 mg/dL
Bilirubin (conjugated) 60 mg/dL
Intralipid 1000 mg/dL
Ascorbic acid 6 mg/dL
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP9-A2. A total
of 107 serum patient samples spanning the range of 25 to 599.5 mg/dL were analyzed
with the candidate cholesterol assay on the Randox Daytona Plus system versus the
predicate device. Of the 107 samples, 9 samples were diluted or spiked. All samples
were analyzed in singlicate. Results of the linear regression are presented below:

b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was conducted using matched sets of serum and plasma
(lithium-heparin and K EDTA plasma) samples which spanned the reportable range

of the assay. The samples (6 diluted and 4 spiked) were analyzed on the RX Daytona
Plus analyzer. The details and results of the study using simple linear regression
