ii. Clinical cut-off: Validation for pulmonary embolism (PE)
The INNOVANCE® D-Dimer assay was evaluated internally on the Sysmex CS-
5100 coagulation analyzer. The samples were collected from a multi-center study
including 15 sites in the United States and 4 sites in Germany to validate the
exclusion of PE using frozen specimens collected prospectively from 1,930
consecutive outpatients who presented to the emergency or ambulatory department
with suspected PE. Exclusion of 96 subjects yielded in a total of 1,834 evaluable
subjects. All centers used the same clinical protocol following the recommendations
of CLSI H59-A “Quantitative D-Dimer for the Exclusion of Venous Thromboembolic
Disease.”
The Wells’ score were used to estimate a high, intermediate or low pre-test
probability (PTP) of PE for all subjects. Patients with a high PTP score were excluded
from the study. Patient samples were tested with the INNOVANCE® D-Dimer assay
and results were compared to a cutoff value of 0.50 mg/L FEU. A D-dimer result
≥0.50 mg/L FEU was considered positive. A D-dimer result <0.50 mg/L FEU was
considered negative. Patients with a positive D-dimer result were evaluated by
imaging methods, e.g. spiral computer tomography (CT) and/or ventilation/perfusion
(VQ) scan. Patients with a negative D-dimer result underwent imaging at the
physician’s discretion. All patients with a negative diagnosis of PE were followed for
three months to evaluate potential development of PE. Patients with unobtainable
follow-up data were excluded from analysis yielding a total of 1,467 patients for final
analysis. The overall prevalence of PE in those patients available for final analysis
was 6.9% (101/1467) with 6.0% in the U.S. population and 37.2% in the German
outside U.S. (OUS) population. The instrument-specific sensitivity, specificity,
negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) with lower
bound (LCL) of two-sided 95% confidence interval were obtained with the
INNOVANCE® D-Dimer clinical cut-off of 0.50 mg/L FEU.

d. Carryover:
i. Reagent Carryover
Reagent carryover was assessed in-house to ensure there is no contamination from
one assay application to another. Washing steps are included between all pipetting
steps. The results were evaluated to confirm the absence of any reagent carryover of
the applications and results were within the acceptance criteria. All possible carryover
events were analyzed for all reagent components for every application of the PT,
APTT, Fibrinogen, Antithrombin, and D-dimer quantitation assays.
ii. Sample Carryover
Sample carryover studies were conducted in-house to evaluate whether a sample
could cause contamination by being carried over into the next test. The analyzer’s
aspiration and washing of the sample probe between pipetting steps would eliminate
the possibility of contamination. Results met predetermined acceptance criteria for
PT, APTT, Fibrinogen, Antithrombin, and D-dimer quantitation assays.
e. Interfering Substances:
i. Interference testing (hemolysis, icterus, and lipemia) to determine the level of
optical interference was conducted for each assay.

ii. Additional testing of Hydroxyethyl Starch (HES) was performed for Fibrinogen
with Dade® Thrombin Reagent. For the low and normal plasma pools (i.e. low and
normal D-dimer level), interference with HES was observed at an HES level of
21g/L and above. For the high plasma pool, the interference with HES was
observed at an HES level of 29 g/L.
iii. Prozone testing – D-dimer assay
The only immunochemical reagent measured on the Sysmex CS-5100 coagulation
analyzer is D-dimer with INNOVANCE® D-Dimer reagent. Purified D-dimer was
used to spike a plasma sample of an apparently healthy blood donor in order to
achieve the concentration of 500 mg/L FEU. Three replicates were performed for
each of the 10 dilutions. All results above the analytical measuring range at a
concentration greater than 4.4 mg/L FEU are automatically re-diluted by the
Sysmex CS-5100 coagulation analyzer.
The intrinsic high dose hook (HDH) algorithm correctly detected potential antigen
excess; therefore results were flagged by the instrument at concentrations at and
above 19.12 mg/L FEU. The instrument automatically re-diluted the samples to
obtain results within the clinically reportable range.
The results of the study confirmed a result of 611.84 mg/L FEU, which met the pre-
established acceptance criterion that there is no high dose hook effect up to 500
mg/L FEU.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i. Traceability: All assay reagents are 510(k) cleared and traceability is specific to
reagent performance.
ii. Reagent stability: All assay reagents are 510(k) cleared and reagent stability studies
are specific to reagent performance.
iii. Sample stability: All assay reagents are 510(k) cleared and sample stability studies
are specific to reagent performance.
iv. On-Board Stability Testing—Reagents: To assess reagent stability during use on the
analyzer, an on-board reagent stability study was conducted to establish the
maximum on-board stability claims stated in the labeling. A reference value was

measured at the beginning of the study (day 0) by measuring 10 replicates of the
individual assay reagent aliquot. Control materials were used as samples. The mean
value was determined and was then used as the reference value. Results were
analyzed by linear regression analysis. The shortest on-board stability time
determined for all samples used with all test batches was then considered the
maximum on-board stability time.
v. On-System Stability Testing—Control Material: To assess the on-board stability of
commercial control material during use on the Sysmex CS-5100 coagulation
analyzer, a stability study was conducted to establish the maximum on-board
stability storage claims stated in the labeling. A reference value was measured at the
beginning of the study (day 0) by measuring 10 replicates of the individual assay
reagent aliquot. The mean value was determined and was then used as the reference
value. Three lots of controls were evaluated with at least four replicates of each
control. The shortest on-board stability time determined for all samples used with all
test batches was then considered the maximum on-board stability time.
vi. Ambient Temperature Testing: The effects of the defined instrument ambient
temperature interval, as stated in the instructions for use (IFU) of the Sysmex CS-
5100 coagulation analyzer, were evaluated. The IFU states the operating
environment’s ambient temperature interval is 15 to 30ºC. Plasma pools and controls
were tested using one reagent lot at three temperature ranges (15, 22, and 30°C) in a
temperature controlled environmental chamber. All results met the pre-established
acceptance criteria.
b. Expected values/Reference range:
Clinical studies were performed to quantify reference ranges for the reagent
applications for Dade® Innovin, Dade® Actin® FSL, Dade® Thrombin Reagent,
INNOVANCE® Antithrombin, and INNOVANCE® D-Dimer. One reagent lot was
used for each assay. The reference range is established by calculation of the 95%
confidence interval 2.5 – 97.5 percentiles.

reagent package insert.
e. Lupus sensitivity for APTT
An in-house study of lupus sensitivity was conducted for APTT assay to assess
instrument performance. Two lots of APTT reagent and 21 well-defined lupus
samples were used in the study. All lupus samples yielded APTT results that
exceeded the upper limit of the reference interval for both APTT reagent lots.
f. Heparin Sensitivity for APTT
Heparin sensitivity study was conducted for APTT assay to assess instrument
performance. Samples from patients receiving unfractionated heparin (UFH) therapy
were measured with both the Sysmex® CA-1500 and Sysmex CS-5100 coagulation
analyzers using two APTT reagent lots. Passing-Bablok analysis for two lots yielded
the following correlation.
• Lot 1: n = 118, y = 1.040x - 1.481, r = 0.991
• Lot 2: n = 116, y = 1.006x - 0.637, r = 0.991
In a study comparing APTT using Actin FSL on Sysmex CS-5100 System with Anti
Xa testing using Berichrom® Heparin on Sysmex®CA-1500 System, a correlation
coefficient r = 0.721 was obtained. Classifying the samples using the Anti Xa
therapeutic range (0.3–0.7 IU/mL) and the calculated APTT therapeutic range
demonstrated a 34% discordance level (21 results out of 62 samples were discordant).

g. Factor Sensitivity for PT and APTT reagents
Factor sensitivity study was conducted for PT and APTT to assess instrument
performance. The study used five lots of PT and APTT reagents to test Factor V and
Factor VII for PT assay and Factor VIII and Factor IX for APTT assay. The
coagulation factor sensitivity level of the PT and APTT assays on the Sysmex CS-
5100 coagulation analyzer was determined by comparing its results to the lower limit
of the respective reference range. Factor sensitivity for five reagent lots yielded:
• Factor V: 37 to 50%
• Factor VII: 42 to 54%
• Factor VIII: 47 to 57%
• Factor IX: 41 to 49%
h. Dilution analysis options:
The auto dilution and 4:1 processing mode are analysis features performed
automatically by the Sysmex CS-5100 coagulation analyzer where a calibration range
was exceeded or where a hook effect for an immunological reagent should be
prohibited. Fibrinogen and D-dimer reagent assays are applicable for these two
options. A bridging study was performed using three different plasma samples.
Samples were tested using manual dilution followed by dilution with the analyzer.
• Auto-dilution: Mean results of manually diluted samples were compared
to the mean results of the same samples automatically diluted by the
analyzers.
• 4:1 processing mode: Mean results of undiluted samples were compared to
the mean results of the same samples diluted in the auto-dilution mode and
4:1 processing mode.
Deviation was calculated for each dilution analysis option and the results were within
±10% of the pre-defined acceptance criteria.
i. Normal Mode vs. Micro Mode
A comparison study was conducted in-house to demonstrate equivalence between two
modes. Resultant data for PT (seconds), PT (INR), APTT, fibrinogen, Antithrombin,
and D-dimer assays were within pre-established acceptance criteria.
j. Closed tube vs. open tube performance
A comparison study was conducted in-house to demonstrate equivalence between
close tube and open tube modes. Resultant data were within pre-established
acceptance criteria.
