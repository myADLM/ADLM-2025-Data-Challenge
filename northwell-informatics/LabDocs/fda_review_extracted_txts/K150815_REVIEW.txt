L. Test Principle:
The BD FACSPresto instrument is an automated multicolor fluorescent imaging cytometer
and absorbance spectrometer with camera, light-emitting diode (LED) illumination,
touchscreen user-interface, battery backup power, and onboard software algorithms that
analyze images and report results. The instrument acquires images of the cartridge at
multiple fields of view and images are analyzed using on-board BD FACSPresto Software to
determine CD4, %CD4, and Hb. Additionally, the instrument has on-board, built in QC
features and algorithms to verify its performance at power-on-self-test (POST) and during
cartridge runs.
The BD FACSPrestoCD4/Hb Cartridge is designed to take whole blood from a venipuncture
or fingerstick, incubate sample for 18 minutes to 2 hours in the BD FACSPresto CD4/Hb
Cartridge, and then run on the BD FACSPresto instrument to obtain accurate results. When
using an aliquot of blood from an EDTA tube, a pipette will be required to transfer the blood
to the cartridge. The BD FACSPresto CD4/Hb Cartridge product provides a disposable
transfer pipette for each cartridge to be used for this purpose.
The dried reagent in the BD FACSPresto CD4/Hb Cartridge features controlled release of the
reagent upon rehydration and contains EDTA to prevent coagulation of fingerstick
specimens. CD4 PE-Cy5 stains CD4-positive cells, while CD3-APC and CD45RA-APC
stain total lymphocytes for use in the %CD4 calculation. CD14-PE is used for staining
monocytes to exclude CD4 and/or CD45RA expressing monocytes from analysis.
Image processing and gating is performed automatically in the FACSPresto software.
Briefly, the gating logic is first to identify CD14 expressing cells and exclude them from
further analysis, second to identify CD3-APC and CD45RA-APC expressing cells to
generate the total lymphocyte population, and third to identify CD4-PECy5 expressing cells
within the total lymphocyte population. Percent CD4 is calculated directly from the ratio of
CD4-expressing to total lymphocytes. CD4 absolute count is the CD4-expressing
lymphocyte count divided by the volume of the imaged field of views.

Bench-Total precision for the BD FACSPresto system was measured for 21
operational days using duplicate Streck CD-Chex Plus BC Normal and CD4-Low
controls for CD4 and %CD4 and duplicate Eurotrol Hb 301 Controls (Levels 1−3) for
Hemoglobin. Daily precision measurements were performed on alternating BD
FACSPresto systems (three instruments in total) in two separate runs per day
(morning/afternoon) by three operators. The study was performed with one
instrument and operator using one lot for seven days, then the next instrument and
operator with a second lot was run for the next seven days, and then the final
instrument and operator with a third lot was run for the final seven days. All

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Five samples with evenly spaced CD4 concentrations were evaluated in the lower
CD4 range of 40−200 cells/µL. Twelve samples with evenly spaced CD4
concentrations were evaluated in the CD4 range of 40–2500 cells/µL and the total
lymphocyte range of 200–5000 cells/µL. Eleven evenly spaced samples were
evaluated for hemoglobin (Hb) in the range of 2–26 g/dL. These samples were
prepared by manipulating whole blood samples, which were collected in EDTA
tubes. The concentration pools for CD4, lymphocytes, and Hb were prepared by
proportionally mixing pools of samples with high and low analyte concentrations.
Samples were tested in triplicate on BD FACSPresto Cartridges for each study.
Three BD FACSPresto instruments and three lots of BD FACSPresto Cartridges were
used for this evaluation.
Because %CD4 is not an analyte by itself but is determined by CD4 and lymphocyte
absolute counts (numerator and denominator, respectively), BD evaluated CD4 and
lymphocyte linearity in this study. Linearity for lymphocyte absolute counts was

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
There are currently no international reference standards for CD4 marker antibodies.
The BD Multi Check Controls were manufactured by diluting human whole blood
containing leukocytes and erythrocytes in a stabilizing medium. The human whole
blood was obtained from commercial sources and was tested for markers of infectious
substances.
The FACSPresto system was evaluated for its accuracy performance against the
HiCN method for hemoglobin determination. Performance was evaluated for the
range of 2−22 g/dL on the BD FACSPresto system and the HiCN reference method
system using manipulated and donor samples. Manipulated levels were spaced
equidistant from each other. These equidistant levels were prepared by manipulating
whole blood samples collected in EDTA tubes. A minimum of one FACSPresto
instrument and one lot of BD FACSPresto Cartridges were used for this evaluation.
The BD FACSPresto System demonstrated agreement with the HiCN method. The
Hb assay is linear and accurate across the reported linear range (2−20 g/dL) as
compared to the HiCN method.
Control Value Assignment:
The value assignment for BD Multi-Check Control and BD Multi-Check CD4 Low
Control included controls were tested on three instruments, with three lots of reagent
cartridge, at two incubation time points: 18 minutes and two hours, for a total of 18
values to determine the final value assignment. The BD Multi-Check results acquired
on the BD FACSPresto system shall fall within the FACSPresto-specific ranges at
least 95% of the time and meet the FACSPresto system error rate of < 5%. All
acceptance criteria were met. Precision testing was performed on the controls using
three lots of BD Multi-Check Control and BD Multi-Check CD4 Low Controls
performed at three sites on three instruments spanning a minimum of 20 days. In
addition to verifying the precision of the process controls on the BD FACSPresto
system, this study further verifies the acceptability of the FACSPresto-specific assay
ranges.
Eurotrol FACSPresto Hb Control value assignment was established using vials from
each level (1, 2, and 3) of Eurotrol FACSPresto Hb Control. Three lots of BD
FACSPresto Cartridges are tested on three FACSPresto Instruments at three
incubation time-points: 1−5 min, 18−30 min and 2 hours (±15min), for a total of 27
values to determine the final value assignment. The hemoglobin results acquired on
the BD FACSPresto system shall fall within the FACSPresto specific ranges at least
95% of the time and meet the FACSPresto system < 5% error rate at each site. All

acceptance criteria were met. Three lots of Eurotrol FACSPresto Hb Control were
run on three instruments to test precision over 20 days verifying the FACSPresto-
assigned ranges were acceptable for use.
Stability:
Stability studies have been performed and the results support the following claims:
Sample Stability:
For specimens acquired via the venipuncture method, staining was performed after
age of blood reached 22−24 hours. These specimens were stained then analyzed at
18−22 minutes later and then again at 2 hours and 15 min after initiating staining.
The acceptance criteria was that a 24 hours post-drawn venipuncture blood in EDTA
shall remain readable and the bias of CD4 count, %CD4, and Hb results shall be
within ±15% with 95% confidence interval of fresh (< 6 hours post-drawn)
venipuncture blood in EDTA. Samples were shown to be stable for up to 22 hours at
room temperature.
Age of Stain:
The acceptable age of staining after reconstitution was determined through the time
course evaluation of the BD FACSPresto Cartridge using fresh (within six hours of
draw) patient blood (both capillary and venous). These specimens were stained and
analyzed for 18−22 minutes after incubation (i.e., standard operating procedures) and
then analyzed again at 2 hours and 15 min after initiating staining. For specimens
acquired via the venipuncture method, age of stain was also performed after age of
blood reached 22−24 hours. These specimens were stained then analyzed at 18−22
minutes later and then again at 2 hours and 15 min after initiating staining. The
staining of the cells was shown to be stable for one hour after the sample has been
applied to the cartridge.
Reagent Cartridge Stability:
Shelf Life: Cartridge for closed pouch expiration is assigned a shelf life of one year
in a temperature and humidity range of 4°C to 31°C and 10% to 95% relative
humidity. The acceptance criteria of CD4, %CD4, or Hb results within ± 10% of
reference reagent (pouched cartridges at -20°C) were met. Real time stability is
ongoing and currently supports a claim of one year.
Open/In use Stability: Open pouch expiration for the cartridges is assigned 30 minute
stability in a temperature and humidity range of 10°C to 40°C and 10% to 95%
relative humidity. The acceptance criteria of CD4, %CD4, or Hb results within ±10%
of reference reagent (pouched cartridges at -20°C) were met.
Control Stability:
Shelf Life: The acceptance criteria for the BD Multi-Check Control and BD Multi-
Check CD4 Low Control results acquired on the BD FACSPresto system shall fall
within the FACSPresto-specific ranges at least 95% of the time and meet the

FACSPresto system error rate of < 5%. Three lots of controls were tested. All lots of
the BD Multi-Check Control and BD Multi-Check CD4 Low Control were within the
established acceptance criteria. Expiration dating reflects the validated time period
that assures adequate device performance throughout the shelf life of 45 days.
The acceptance criteria for shelf life stability of the Eurotrol FACSPresto Hb Control
was the measurement results of the controls must demonstrate no more than 7%
allowable drift with 95% confidence interval from the mean value at T=0 throughout
the claimed shelf life. All three lots of the Eurtotrol FACSPresto Hb Control were
within the established acceptance criteria. Expiration dating reflects the validated
time period that assures adequate device performance throughout the shelf life of one
month.
Open Vial/In-use Stability:
Real time stability testing of the BD Multi-Check Control and BD Multi-Check CD4
Low Control passed the acceptance criteria for all stability tests through the stated
open vial shelf life of nine thermal cycles, stored at 2-8°C and sampled at room
temperature.
Real time stability testing of two lots of the Eurotrol FACSPresto Hb Control (Levels
1–3) passed the acceptance criteria for all stability tests through the stated open vial
shelf life of 30 days, stored at 2–8°C and sampled at room temperature.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB):
For the FACSPresto CD4 assay, the LoB was determined by producing a blank
sample for the CD4 assay by blocking all CD4 binding sites with CD4-FITC. The
CD4-PECy5 will be prevented from binding. There will be no CD4 signal and the
algorithm will not count and gate any CD4 cells. The instrument average of blank
samples, after running the blank 60 times, was 5.02 counts, with a SD of 3.16, and the
95th percentile of blank sample of 9.92.
The sponsor has stated that it is not feasible to use the BD FACSPresto system to
perform the Hb assay at zero g/dL for LoB determination due to an internal algorithm
quality control process.
Limit of Detection (LoD):
For the FACSPresto CD4 assay, the LoD was determined by testing 20 replicates
from a sample with the lowest detectible level of analyte and 20 replicates from the
blank sample were tested for CD4 per lot of cartridges per instrument. The LoD of
the CD4 assay was determined to be 22 cells/µL.
For the FACSPresto Hemoglobin assay the LoD was determined by following the
Probit approach in accordance with CSLI EP-17-A2. The LoD of the Hemoglobin
assay was determined to be 0.91 g/dL.

--- Page 19 ---
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ):
For the FACSPresto CD4 assay the LoQ was determined by following the variant
approach described in Section 6.6 of the CSLI EP17-A2 guideline. Five samples
were tested in six replicates for each of two lots of cartridges. The LoQ of the CD4
assay was determined to be 35 cells/µL.
The LoQ for Hemoglobin (Hb) was determined to be 2.0 g/dL. To determine the
LoQ of Hb, 20 replicates from a sample with the lowest detectible level of analyte
were tested for Hb per lot of cartridges per instrument (60 replicates total). Whole
blood was concentrated by removing the plasma to obtain a sample with high Hb
level and then diluted with plasma to target an Hb level of 2 g/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The endogenous and exogenous interference studies were performed in accordance
with CLSI EP07-A2 guidelines. Clinically significant means a 15% or lower
difference from a negative control. The acceptance criteria for CD4, %CD4, and Hb
results were: for each of the sample results, intra-sample precision shall have a CV
under 7% and for each of the analytes, with 95% confidence interval applied, the
mean difference (or bias) between the sample with target concentration and the
negative control sample shall be less than 15%. The following interfering substances
were tested and passed the acceptance criteria for the concentrations stated below.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A study population of HIV+ paired fingerstick (FS) and venipuncture (VP) samples
measured in duplicate on the FACSPresto system and the predicate devices. Remnant
venous blood samples without corresponding capillary specimens were also included.
The tests were performed using three lots of the BD FACSPresto cartridge, three
instruments, and two operators.
Venipuncture samples were prospectively obtained from 796 de-identified and de-
linked donors, of which 692 provided matched capillary blood specimens. Male
(322) and female (410) subjects from apparently healthy, HIV negative subjects with
other diseases, and HIV positive patients were included. Seven hundred seventeen
(717) subjects from CHIL, DIT, KEM, NAR, PEK SIR and SFG were enrolled in the
study, and 75 venous blood specimens were procured from an external vendor for
sample manipulation at MED and added to the venous portion of the study. The
samples were manipulated by combining cell fractions and plasma in appropriate
ratios to reach target concentrations of analyte(s) to fill the low bins (CD4 and Hb) or
high bins (CD4 and Hb) in the accuracy evaluation. Of the non-manipulated samples,
57 samples were from children (2 to 11 years), 68 samples were from adolescents (12
to 21 years), and 592 samples were from adults (≥ 22 years). None of the capillary
blood specimens was manipulated.
Acceptance criteria were as follows:

%CD4 5 to 60
Hemoglobin (Hb) (g/dL) 5 to 18
b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor provided matrix comparison studies that included 678 matched pairs of
fingerstick blood samples and venous blood samples for measurement of CD4
absolute counts, %CD4, and hemoglobin measurements in whole blood.
Venous Peripheral Blood vs. Fingerstick linear regression
N Slope 95% CI y-Intercept 95% CI R2
CD4 678 1.07 1.05 to 1.09 0.58 -6.44 to 7.59 0.96
%CD4 678 1.00 0.99 to 1.02 -0.80 -1.17 to -0.44 0.96
Hb 685 1.00 0.97 to 1.02 0.23 -0.08 to 0.53 0.89
Note that for 14 of the 692 paired capillary vs venous blood samples, the difference in
results between matrices would result in different result interpretation based on the
cutoff of 200 cells/µL. However, as a clinician would not use 200 cells/µL alone as
an absolute cutoff value for decision making, and all clinical factors are considered
important to evaluate the patient diagnosis, having a discordant reading between
capillary and venous blood samples in these cases would not result delayed or missed
treatment.
Multiple sources of CD4 count variability are recognized, including intra-laboratory
measurements and individual patient physiologic factors. CD4 results must be
interpreted in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Two BD FACSPresto instruments and three lots of BD FACSPresto Cartridges were used
for testing venous and capillary blood specimens collected from 133 male and 142 female
apparently healthy subjects, between 18 to 70 years of age, at one clinical site (BCW).
On each day of testing, BD FACSPresto instruments were set up and process controls
were run obtaining passing results. The first replicate was used to calculate CD4, %CD4,
and Hb values. Data were analyzed using parametric (ANOVA) and non-parametric
methods described in Section 7.3 of CLSI Guideline EP28-A3c Defining, Establishing,
and Verifying Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory; Approved Guideline –
Third Edition. We recommend that laboratories and other users establish their own
reference intervals for their patient populations using the BD FACSPresto system to
reflect potential sources of variability, such as patient gender, race, age, and preparation
techniques.

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ________ or No ___x___
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____x___ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification can be entered either manually or with a barcode reader.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Collection is by aliquot from an EDTA-coated tube containing whole blood from
venipuncture or from fingerstick via lancet. To prepare the cartridge, the user transfers
the whole blood specimen directly from an EDTA tube or fingerstick to the inlet port of
the cartridge. Once blood flows in the cartridge, the cap is closed and the cartridge
automatically performs all sample preparation. During this process the sample flows
through the reagent disk and into the cartridge channel where staining of white cells by
fluorescent-antibody conjugates occurs. The tear-strip on the cartridge label protects the
stained sample from light exposure. After 18 minutes (and up to two hours) stain time,
the tear-strip is removed and the cartridge can be read on the instrument.
5. Calibration:
Performed by manufacturer
6. Quality Control:
BD Multi-Check Control and BD Multi-Check CD4 Low Control are assayed whole
blood quality control products for analysis using monoclonal antibody reagents and
image cytometry. They provide positive cell controls that are processed in the same
manner as a whole blood sample. This allows verification of instrument and reagent
performance.
Eurotrol FACSPresto Hb Control is an assayed hemoglobin control product for analysis
using spectrophotometry. The control is processed in the same manner as a whole blood
sample. This allows verification of instrument and reagent performance.

Fifty seven (57) samples were analyzed, comprised of 18 HIV- samples and 39 HIV+
samples on two different BD FACSPresto systems: a BD FACSCalibur instrument with BD
Tritest CD3/4/45 (the predicate assay), and a BD FACSCalibur instrument with the BD
Multitest Immune Monitoring Kit (IMK) consisting of CD3/4/8/45 and CD3/16+56/19/45 (2
tube T/B/NK assay), to compare total lymphocyte counts between methods. The Tritest
assay uses SSC and CD45 signals to identify lymphocytes as SSC low and CD45 high. The
IMK assay similarly uses SSC and CD45 to identify lymphocytes and then uses CD3, CD19
and CD16+CD56 to identify these lymphocytes as T-cells, B-cells and NK-cells respectively.
Both FACSCalibur methods used BD Trucount beads for calculating absolute lymphocyte
counts.
