CLSI EP7-A2:2003, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures:

L. Test Principle:
The Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System measures glucose electrochemically. The glucose
biosensor is capable of recognizing the glucose present in whole blood or control solutions by
virtue of the glucose specificity of the enzyme glucose oxidase present on the glucose test strip.
A voltage is applied and the glucose concentration is calculated by the meter from the electrical
current. The final results are communicated to the smart mobile device through the audio jack.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed within-run precision studies using venous whole blood spiked
to five (5) different glucose concentration ranges (30 to 50, 51 to 110, 111 to 150, 151 to 250,
and 251 to 400 mg/dL). Fifty (50) samples were prepared at each glucose level, and each
sample was analyzed in duplicate for a total of 100 results per glucose level. Results were
collected using three (3) test strip lots and 10 meters. Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated in 2 studies:
Linearity in Study #1 was evaluated using three (3) test strip lots and 11 mixed pools of
venous blood with glucose concentrations at 16, 86, 157, 230, 301,367,438, 510, 578, 649
and 728 mg/dL, as measured by the YSI reference method.
Linearity in Study #2 was evaluated at low concentrations, using three (3) test strip lots
and six (6) mixed pools of venous blood with glucose concentrations at 16, 37, 57.5,
78.4, 99.2 and 118.8 mg/dL as measured by the YSI reference method. In both studies,
each level was measured in replicates of five (5) with each of three (3) test strip lots and
the values from the Dario™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System were compared with
those obtained from the YSI-2300. Results from the combined regression analysis are as
follows:
y = 1.008x – 1.459, r2 =0.998
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of 20-600
mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to The
method comparison study was performed using the candidate device and YSI as the
reference method (see Section 2.a. above) NIST SRM 917b.
Test Strip Stability:
Test strip stability was assessed in accelerated and real-time studies. The testing
protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The
manufacturer claims shelf life stability of 24 months and an open-vial stability of 6
months at the recommended storage conditions of 36°F-90°F (2°C-32°C) and 10-90%
relative humidity. The instructions state not to refrigerate open test strip cartridges or put
test strips in a freezer.
Control Solution Value Assignment and Stability:
The Dario Glucose Control Solutions Level 1 and Level 2 were previously cleared
(k082683). The control solutions offered are Level 1 (range 90-140mg/dL) and Level
2 (range 170-240 mg/dL). The value assignment protocol and the stability protocols
and acceptance criteria were reviewed under k082683. The control solutions are
stable for 24 months and for 3 months after opening when stored at the recommended
storage conditions of 46°F-86°F (8°C-30°C) and 10-90% humidity.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study in Section M1b above.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by spiking venous blood with two levels of glucose
concentrations (65 and 250 mg/dL). Each of these samples was divided into a test pool
and a control pool and each potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substance
was added to the test pool. Each substance was tested at three concentrations. Each
sample was analyzed 10 times with the Dario meter and the % difference between the
individual measurements and the reference (YSI) calculated. The sponsor defines no
significant interference as ≤10% difference relative to YSI. Results are presented in the
table below:

The following limitations have been added to the labeling:
If you are taking acetaminophen containing drugs (e.g. Tylenol) or Vitamin C (ascorbic acid)
you may get inaccurate results with this system.
If you have a disease or condition in which uric acid levels in your blood may be elevated
(>11 mg/dL), such as gout, you may get inaccurate results with this system.
If you have very high levels of triglyceride (>810mg/dL), you may get inaccurate results with
this system.
This system should not be used when undergoing xylose absorption tests.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1) Hematocrit Study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the
Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using venous whole blood
samples with hematocrit levels of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60 and 65% spiked with
glucose to achieve three (3) concentrations at 50-70, 100-200, and 250-300 mg/dL. Each sample
was then tested using 10 Dario Meters and three (3) lots of test strips. The values were compared
with those obtained from YSI 2300 analyzer. The % biases relative to YSI were acceptable
within the claimed hematocrit range of 20 to 60%.
2) Altitude study: Capillary fingerstick samples with glucose concentrations ranging from
48 to 423.5 mg/dL were collected from 52 participants at 10,152 feet above sea level.
Results were obtained from each participant sample in on the Dario for each of 3 test
strip lots compared to additional fingerstick samples measured on the YSI. The results
demonstrate acceptable bias to YSI to support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up
to 10,000 feet (3048 meters) have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements
from the Dario meter.
3) Sample volume study: The sponsor performed a study to support the claimed minimum
sample volume for the Dario system. Blood samples with three levels of glucose (50-65,
100-120, and 200-250 mg/dL) were tested at six sample volumes (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5,
0.75, 0.8, and 1.0 µL) and values obtained were compared to YSI values. Results support
the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.3 µL.
4) Temperature and humidity studies: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity
studies using venous blood samples at five glucose concentrations (approximately 60,
110, 200, 300, and 475 mg/dL) to evaluate temperatures ranging from 12±2oC to 43±2oC
and relative humidity from 10% to 90%. Meter results were compared to YSI values.
Six temperature and humidity combinations were tested including low temperature/low
humidity, low temperature/high humidity, average temperature/low humidity, average
temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low humidity, and high temperature/high
humidity. The results support the claims in the labeling that the system can be used in
conditions of 50 to 113°F (10 to 45°C) with relative humidity of 10 to 90%.
5) Infection Control Studies: The device is intended for single-patient use only. Super
Sani-Cloth wipes with EPA registration #9480-4 were validated demonstrating complete
inactivation of live hepatitis B virus for use with the test strips cartridge cap, Dario meter
and Dario BGMS housing device . The sponsor also demonstrated that there
was no change in performance or in the external materials of the test strips cartridge cap,
Dario meter and Dario BGMS housing device after 156 cleaning and disinfection cycles
(one cycle includes one cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting wipe) to simulate 3 years of
single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated
cleaning and disinfection procedures.
