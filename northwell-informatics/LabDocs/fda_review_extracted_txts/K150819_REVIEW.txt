L. Test Principle:
Triglycerides are hydrolyzed by a lipase to glycerol and fatty acids. In the presence of
ATP and glycerol kinase, the glycerol is phosphorylated to glycerol-3-phosphate, which
is then oxidized by glycerol-3-phosphate-oxidase to produce hydrogen peroxide (H O ).
2 2
H O reacts with 4-aminophenazone and 4-chlorophenol under the catalytic action of
2 2
peroxidase to form a colored quinoneimine complex. The absorbance of the
quinoneimine complex at 510 nm is proportional to the concentration of triglycerides in
the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the Triglycerides (TRIGS) test system was determined in accordance
with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP5-A2 guideline. Two
reagent lots, 2 RX Daytona Plus analyzers and 2 operators were utilized in the study.
Two replicates of each of the control and serum samples were tested on two separate
runs per day for 20 days, leading to the generation of 80 data points for each sample.
The mean, SD, and %CV calculated for within-run and total imprecision for each lot
yielded similar results. The results from one representative lot is shown below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Two linearity studies were performed. For both studies, samples were prepared by
mixing a high spiked serum sample with a low diluted serum sample to obtain 11
concentrations. In Study 1, the samples spanned the range of 19.8 to 1017 mg/dL and
in Study 2, the samples spanned the range of 12.04 mg/dL to 995.60 mg/dL, with
each sample assayed in 5 replicates. The results of linear regression analyses for each
study are summarized below:
Study 1: y = 1.02x - 0.25; r=0.999
Study 2: y = 0.96x + 3.30; r= 1.000.
The RX Daytona Plus analyzer is capable of auto diluting with a 1:15 dilution factor,
and an auto-dilution study was conducted against a manual dilution and all results
were within a pre-specified acceptance criteria.
The reportable range of the assay is 12.4 to 1000 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The controls and calibrators to be used with this assay are manufactured by Randox
Laboratories. The Randox Calibration Serum Level 3 has previously been cleared
under k053153, and the control under k942458.
Value Assignment for Calibrators
A 2 point calibration is recommended every 28 days or with change of reagent lot.
0.9% NaCl as zero calibrator and Randox Calibration Serum Level 3 are
recommended for calibration. The Randox Calibration Serum Level 3 is a
lyophilized calibrator prepared with human serum at a target value of 241 mg/dL.
Value assignment is done in-house by testing 2 lots of the calibrator against the
master lot in replicates of 5 on the Triglycerides (TRIGS) test system. The protocol
and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
A detection limit study was performed according to CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. Limit
of Blank (LoB) was determined by running 4 blank samples in 20 replicates across 3
days giving 60 determinations in total on the RX Daytona Plus analyzer, and LoB
was the value at the 95th percentile. The limit of detection (LoD) was determined

using 4 diluted patient serum sample pools in 20 replicates across 3 days for a total of
60 data points on the RX Daytona Plus analyzer. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was
determined by running 4 diluted patient serum sample pools in 12 replicates across 5
days yielding a total of 60 results. The LoQ was defined by the mean concentration
of the lowest sample that met the performance goal (intermediate precision of ≤ 20%
CV).
LoB 2.65 mg/dL
LoD 3.96 mg/dL
LoQ 12.4 mg/dL
The claimed measuring range for the triglyceride assay is 12.4-1000 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed at 2 different concentrations of triglycerides (150
mg/dL and 496 mg/dL) using one RX Daytona Plus analyzer and one reagent lot.
Samples with added potential interferents were tested in replicates of 10, and
compared to a sample without interferent. The sponsor defined no significant
interference as < 10 % difference from the control sample.
Results are summarized in the table below:
Interferent Concentration at which no
interference was observed
Ascorbic acid 3 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 750 mg/dL
Unconjugated bilirubin 60 mg/dL
Total bilirubin 60 mg/dL
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed following the recommendations in CLSI
EP9-A2 comparing testing on the Randox Triglycerides (TRIGS) reagent on a Rx
Daytona Plus analyzer to the predicate device. A total of 109 serum samples
covering the range 14.2 to 986 mg/dL were assayed in singlicate. Of these, 10 were
spiked or diluted samples. Linear regression analysis yielded the following results:
y = 0.97x + 1.22, r = 0.999
95% CI of slope = 0.96 to 0.97
95% CI of y-intercept = -0.03 to 2.47
