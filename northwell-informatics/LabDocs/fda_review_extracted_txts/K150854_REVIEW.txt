L. Test Principle:
The allergen of interest, covalently coupled to ImmunoCAP solid phase, reacts with the specific
IgE in the patient sample. After washing away nonspecific IgE, enzyme-labeled antibodies
against IgE are added to form a complex. After incubation, unbound enzyme-anti-IgE is washed
away and the bound complex is then incubated with a developing agent. After stopping the
reaction, the fluorescence of the eluate is measured. The higher the response value, the more
specific IgE is present in the specimen. To evaluate the test results, the responses for the patient
samples are transformed to concentrations with the use of a calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i) Within-Lot imprecision:
Imprecision of the individual allergen components was evaluated by using two positive
plasma samples, including a low range sample (0.35 ± 25%) and a high range sample
(≥0.7 kU /L). Each sample was tested in 4 replicates in one assay run per day for a
A
total of 20 operating days (a total of 80 replicates per sample). The assay was
performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Directions for Use using Phadia
250. Between-day and within-run coefficients of variance (%CV) were calculated for
each component and each sample separately. Results of CV% values for individual
allergen components were all within the acceptance criteria and are shown below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the individual allergens was assessed following the CLSI I/LA20-A2
guidelines. For each allergen component, three positive plasma samples were each diluted
in negative plasma generating at least five 2-fold consecutive dilutions. Undiluted samples
were tested in 12 replicates and diluted samples were tested in four replicates in one assay
run. The assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for
Use using the Phadia 250 instrument. For each product, one lot of ImmunoCAP Allergen
Component was used. The working range of the ImmunoCAP Specific Total IgE is LoD
to100 kU /L.

The results of the inhibition with the allergen solution and the unrelated inhibitors
indicate that the five new ImmunoCAP Allergen Components s contain the
immunologically relevant allergen as shown below:
ImmunoCAP Allergen, f439, Allergen Component rCor a 14 (Hazelnut)
The f439, rCor a 14 (Hazelnut) allergen Inhibition study showed that >50% inhibition
was achieved with the related inhibitor (rCor a 14 allergen) at a final inhibitor
concentration of 0.92 mg/mL. The inhibition studies using four unrelated inhibitors,
including three from unrelated groups (rPla l 1, Plantain; rPla a 1, London Plane; and
rFel d 2, Cat) and one from the related/same group (rCor a 8, Hazelnut) did not show
any significant inhibition. The inhibition studies indicate that the ImmunoCAP
Allergen f439, rCor a 14 (Hazelnut) solid phase contains the immunologically relevant
allergen.
ImmunoCAP Allergen, f440, Allergen Component nCor a 9 (Hazelnut)
The f440, nCor a 9 (Hazelnut) allergen Inhibition study showed that >50% inhibition
was achieved with the related inhibitor (nCor a 9 allergen) at a final inhibitor
concentration of 22 µg/mL. The inhibition studies using four unrelated inhibitors,
including three from unrelated groups (nAmb a 1, Ragweed; rOle e 9, Olive; and rCan f
5, Dog) and one from the related/same group (rCor a 1, Hazelnut) did not show any
significant inhibition. The inhibition studies indicate that the ImmunoCAP Allergen
f440, nCor a 9 (Hazelnut) solid phase contains the immunologically relevant allergen.
ImmunoCAP Allergen, f441, Allergen Component rJug r 1 (Walnut)
The f441, rJug r 1 (Walnut) allergen Inhibition study showed that >50% inhibition was
achieved with the related inhibitor (rJug r 1 allergen) at a final inhibitor concentration
of 23 µg/mL. The inhibition studies using four unrelated inhibitors, including three
from unrelated groups (rCan f 4, Dog; rOle e 9, Olive; and rPla l 1, Plantain) and one
from the related/same group (rJug r 3, Walnut) did not show any significant inhibition.
The inhibition studies indicate that the ImmunoCAP Allergen f441, rJug r 1 (Walnut)
solid phase contains the immunologically relevant allergen.
ImmunoCAP Allergen, f442, Allergen Component rJurg r 3 (Walnut)
The f442, rJurg r 3 (Walnut) allergen Inhibition study showed that >50% inhibition was
achieved with the related inhibitor (rJug r 3 allergen) at a final inhibitor concentration
of 19 mg/mL. The inhibition studies using four unrelated inhibitors, including three
from unrelated groups (rCan f 4, Dog; rOle e 9, Olive; and rPla l 1, Plantain) and one
from the related/same group (rJurg r 1, Walnut) did not show any significant inhibition.
The inhibition studies indicate that the ImmunoCAP Allergen f442, rJurg r 3 (Walnut)
solid phase contains the immunologically relevant allergen.
ImmunoCAP Allergen, f443, Allergen Component rAna o 3 (Cashew nut)
The f443, rAna o 3 (Cashew nut) allergen Inhibition study showed that >50% inhibition

was achieved with related inhibitor (rAna o 3 allergen) at a final inhibitor concentration
of 43 µg/mL. The inhibition studies using four unrelated inhibitors, including three
from unrelated groups (nAmb a 1, Ragweed; rOle e 9, Olive; and rCan f 5, Dog) and
one from the related/same group (rCor a 1, Hazelnut) did not show any significant
inhibition. The inhibition studies indicate that the ImmunoCAP Allergen f443, rAna o
3 (Cashew nut) solid phase contains the immunologically relevant allergen.
ii) Interference:
a) Endogenous Substance Interference:
In order to show that icteric, hemolytic or lipemic samples do not adversely affect
the results in ImmunoCAP Specific IgE assay using representative allergens,
Bilirubin C [final concentration (fc) 20 mg/dL], Bilirubin F (fc 19 mg/dL),
Hemoglobin (fc 489 mg/dL) and Chyle (fc 1,440 Formazine Turbidity Units) were
spiked into 2 samples per allergen and were analyzed in duplicates in one assay run
using Phadia 250. Refer to K1138441. The results demonstrate that icteric,
hemolytic or lipemic samples do not adversely affect the results in ImmunoCAP
Specific IgE.
b) Exogenous Substance Interference:
Two literature references were provided supporting that commonly prescribed
"allergy medications" do not interfere with ImmunoCAP Specific IgE. The
references included (i) Robert G. Hamilton, Accuracy of US Food and Drug
Administration-cleared IgE antibody assays in the presence of anti-IgE
(omalizumab), J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2006; 759-766, and (ii) Linda Cox et. al.,
Pearls and pitfalls of allergy diagnostic testing: report from the American College
of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology/American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and
Immunology Specific IgE Test Task Force, Annals of Allergy, Asthma &
Immunology, 2008; 101:580-592.
f. Assay cut-off:
Limit of Quantitation for ImmunoCAP Specific IgE is 0.1 kU /L. All results >0.1 kU //L
A A
are interpreted as being analytically positive.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable
b. Matrix comparison:
In order to show that different sample matrices (heparin plasma, EDTA plasma and serum)
are interchangeable for ImmunoCAP Allergen Components, serum, sodium heparin
plasma, and EDTA plasma samples were collected from four patients with clinical history
of known specific allergies and four non-atopic patients. The samples contained specific
IgE antibodies for one or more of the allergen components tested. All sample matrices
(heparin plasma, EDTA plasma and serum) from each patient were tested with
ImmunoCAP Allergen Components in two replicates in one assay run. The results from
the study demonstrate that samples of different matrices (heparin plasma, EDTA plasma
and serum) are interchangeable for ImmunoCAP Allergen Components. Refer to K101251.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical sensitivity and specificity:

--- Page 10 ---
The performance of the five new individual allergen components was compared to a
clinical diagnosis of allergy. The objectives of this study were: (i) to show the linkage
between specific IgE antibodies to ImmunoCAP Allergen Component and the
corresponding extract based ImmunoCAP Allergen, using clinical samples, and (ii) to
demonstrate that samples from healthy, non-atopic donors with no reported clinical
reaction to the allergen have undetectable or very low levels of specific IgE to the
individual ImmunoCAP Allergen Component. Thirty or more clinical serum samples from
individuals with a clinical history of allergy-like symptoms upon exposure to the allergen,
as diagnosed by a physician were used in the study. Information about clinical symptoms
and manifestations was available for all clinical samples. Negative samples (<0.35 kU /L)
A
from 100 healthy non-atopic donors were also tested.
