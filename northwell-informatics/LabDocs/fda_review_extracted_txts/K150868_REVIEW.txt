I. Device Description:
The Solana™ GAS Assay detects GAS DNA isolated from throat swab specimens obtained
from patients with the signs and symptoms of pharyngitis. The assay consists of three major
steps: 1) sample processing 2) specimen preparation, and 3) amplification and detection of
target sequence specific to GAS using isothermal Helicase-Dependent Amplification (HDA)
in the presence of target-specific fluorescence probe.
Patient specimen on a throat swab is transferred to a Lysis Tube and subjected to heat
treatment at 95°C for 5 minutes. The heat-treated sample is added to a Dilution Tube, and
then transferred to a Reaction Tube. The Reaction Tube contains lyophilized HDA reagents,
dNTPs, primers and probes. Once rehydrated with the diluted sample, the Reaction Tube is
placed in the Solana™ for amplification and detection of GAS-specific target sequence. In
the Solana™ GAS Assay, the target sequence is amplified by GAS-specific primers and
detected by a GAS-specific fluorescence probe included in the Reaction Tube. A competitive
process control (PRC) is included in the Lysis Tube to monitor sample processing, inhibitory
substances in clinical samples, reagent failure or device failure. The PRC target is amplified
by GAS specific primers and detected by a PRC specific fluorescence probe.

Solana measures and interprets the fluorescent signal, using on-board method-specific
algorithms. Solana instrument will then report the test results to the user on the display
screen. Results can also be printed out. The total time for assay completion from specimen
processing to result is < 45 minutes.

L. Test Principle:
Patient specimen on a throat swab is transferred to a Lysis Tube and subjected to heat
treatment at 95°C for 5 minutes. The heat-treated sample is added to a Dilution Tube, and
then transferred to a Reaction Tube. The Reaction Tube contains lyophilized helicase-
dependent amplification (HDA) reagents, dNTPs, primers and probes. Once rehydrated with
the diluted sample, the Reaction Tube is placed in Solana for amplification and detection of
GAS-specific target sequence. In Solana, the target sequence is amplified by GAS specific
primers and detected by a GAS specific fluorescence probe included in the Reaction Tube. A
competitive process control (PRC) is included in the Lysis Tube to monitor sample
processing, inhibitory substances in clinical samples, and reagent or device failure. The PRC
target is amplified by GAS specific primers and detected by a PRC specific fluorescence
probe.
The target and PRC probes are labeled with a quencher on one end and a fluorophore on the
other end. The target and PRC fluorescent probes have a RNA linker that is cleaved by
RNaseH2 upon annealing to GAS or PRC amplicons, and the fluorescence signal increases
due to separation of fluorophore from quencher. The Solana™ Instrument measures and
interprets the fluorescent signal, using on-board method-specific algorithms. Solana
instrument will then report the test results to the user on its display screen, and it can print
out the results via a printer.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Specimen Stability:
Solana™ GAS Assay incorporates a process control (PRC) in the lysis buffer tube
that is used to monitor sample processing and evaluate the presence of substances
inhibitory to helicase dependent amplification (HDA) and to confirm the integrity of
assay reagents. The Quidel Molecular A + G Streptococci Control Set #M111, which
contains positive and negative controls, serves as an external processing and
extraction controls for the Solana™ GAS Assay and were run each day of testing.
Studies were performed to determine the stability of specimens collected using the
following routinely used swab systems: nylon, rayon and polyester swabs in Amies
media, and rayon and polyester swabs in Stuart media, and rayon swabs in Amies gel.
A freshly grown stock of GAS bacteria of known titer was used to spike the swabs
listed above. Triplicate testing for each condition with each collection/transport
system listed above demonstrated that specimens can be stored at 25°C ± 2°C for 2
days and then at 2 to 8oC for up to 8 more days prior to being tested in the Solana™
GAS Assay. A separate study was performed where the spiked samples were stored
at £-15oC or £-70oC for a minimum of 32 days before testing.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) of the Solana™ GAS Assay was determined using
contrived stocks of two (2) GAS strains on three (3) instruments. For each strain,
stocks were prepared by suspending and diluting freshly grown colonies on to 5%
sheep blood tryptic soy agar. Colony counts from preliminary serial dilutions were
associated with optical density to determine the LoD. The LoD was defined as the
point at which at least 95% of all replicates tested positive (C ). The GAS strains
95
were serially diluted then spiked onto swabs. For each strain, the LoD was confirmed

A study was performed to evaluate the performance of the Solana™GAS Assay
in the presence of forty-six (46) potentially cross-reacting bacteria, yeast and
viruses commonly found in throat specimens, in triplicate (3) using three (3)
instruments. Clinically relevant levels of virus (105 PFU/ml) and bacteria/yeast
(106 CFU/mL) or higher were inoculated onto swabs and run with the Solana™
GAS Assay. For bacteria/yeast, each organism was cultured then suspended and
diluted to the indicated concentration and frozen. Viruses were titered by PFU/ml
unless stocks had to be purchased and were represented in different terms. Each
swab was inoculated with a panel member and run with the Solana™ GAS Assay.

None of the forty-six (46) bacteria, yeast or viruses tested that might be found in
throat swab specimens cross-react with the assay.
ii. Microbial interference
Microbial interference studies were conducted in triplicate (3) with each of the
forty-six (46) bacteria, yeast and viruses listed above in Table V in triplicate (3) in
the presence of clinically relevant levels of viruses (105 PFU/ml) and
bacteria/yeast (106 CFU/ml) or higher. All strains were prepared as described in
the cross-reactivity studies in M.1.f.i above along with GAS spiked onto the swab
at a 2 x LoD concentration. These studies were conducted with the two (2) strains
used in the LoD studies in M.1.d above using three (3) instruments. None of the
bacteria, yeast or viruses demonstrated interference with the detection of the
Group A Streptococcal strains in any of the replicates tested.
These study results are acceptable and they are described in the labeling.
iii. Interfering substances
Twenty-eight (28) chemical and biological substances were evaluated for
potential to interfere with the Solana™ GAS Assay, including blood (5% v/v) and
human saliva (10% v/v). Each substance was tested in triplicate using two strains
of Streptococcus pyogenes (ATCC 19615 and 12344), tested at 2 x LoD at
medically relevant concentrations. None of the substances tested were found to
interfere with the Solana™ GAS Assay in any of the replicates tested.
These study results are acceptable and they are described in the labeling.
iv. Carryover/Cross-contamination
A study to assess carryover contamination was conducted by three (3) operators
using three (3) different Solana™ Instruments with one GAS strain (ATCC
19615). Fifty (50) high positive (1 x 106 CFU/ml) and fifty (50) negative samples
were spiked onto swabs and tested on the Solana™ instruments. Five (5) positive
and five (5) negative swabs were tested in an alternating order. No
carryover/cross contamination was observed in the course of this study.
These study results are acceptable and they are described in the labeling.
g. Assay cut-off:
Cut-off values are based on set time thresholds for amplification and were determined
based on results from preliminary LoD studies and initial clinical specimen testing.
The cut-offs were set based on the longest time observed to achieve a valid GAS
result from these studies.

eighty-two (1082) fresh throat swab specimens were collected and tested during clinical
trials, all of which were cultured and tested with the Solana™ GAS Assay at four (4)
distinct geographical sites across the United States. A single specimen was collected per
patient. Samples were collected using the Liquid Amies Single Plastic Applicator, the
Liquid Stuart Single Plastic Applicator, the Puritan Liquid Amies Transport System,
sterile rayon throat swabs and polyester throat swabs.
All one thousand eighty-two (1082) fresh throat specimens were cultured for Group A β-
hemolytic Streptococcus (GAS) and tested with Solana™ GAS Assay. The swab
specimens were cultured at the testing sites and the transport fluid was cultured at a
central location. The specimen was considered positive if culture from either the swab or
the transport fluid was positive for Group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus and this was
referred to as Composite Culture. One (1) result was determined to be invalid in these
studies. The invalid rate observed during the clinical prospective study for this device
was 0.09% (1/1082). These results are shown in Table VIII below for all sites combined
and for each study site separately.
