510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
K150877
B. Purpose for Submission:
To introduce new pre analytical features and software on the currently marketed ACL TOP
Family (reference: K073377 and K091980 ‒ LAS model).
‐
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Instrumentation Laboratory (IL) Co., ACL TOP Family 50 Series Models: ACL TOP 350
CTS, ACL TOP 550 CTS, ACL TOP 750, ACL TOP 750 CTS, ACL TOP 750 LAS.
NOTE: CTS = Closed Tube Sample; LAS = Laboratory Automated System.
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Clotting, chromogenic and immunological coagulation assays
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The ACL TOP Family 50 Series are fully automated coagulation analyzers that utilize the
same intuitive software, the same consumables, reagents, calibrators and controls, and
provide the same analytical methodology for routine and specialty assay result reporting
as the predicate ACL TOP Family. The ACL TOP Family 50 Series instruments perform
the following types of tests, using the same optical measuring wavelengths and test
parameters as the predicate ACL TOP Family:
• Coagulometric (Turbidimetric) Measurements
• Chromogenic (Absorbance) Measurements
• Immunological Measurements
The ACL TOP Family 50 Series also offers new pre-analytical features not available on
the predicate ACL TOP Family as described below. These features are not intended to
replace laboratory quality policies. The features simply alert the instrument operator to a
potential HIL (Hemoglobin, Icteric and Lipemia) interference situation specific to the
assays requested for a sample, underfilled sample tubes or a detected clog.
The new pre-analytical features and software are as follows:
1

--- Page 2 ---
Pre-Analytical HIL Check detects and measures interference caused by the presence of
hemoglobin, bilirubin, and light scattering lipids in patient samples.
• H – Hemolysis (hemoglobin)
• I – Icterus (bilirubin)
• L – Lipemia (turbidity)
A third measurement wavelength at 535 nm and an additional emitter control channel
have been introduced to support the new Pre Analytical HIL Check feature.
Pre Analytical Tube Fill Height (THF) Chec‐k aids laboratories by screening open and
closed tube samples during the first sample aspiration to determine whether the tube fill
mee‐ts the minimum level based on the tube manufacturer's recommendations.
Pre Analytical Clog Detection is performed on all samples during aspiration. A
pre analytical error or warning for fluidic obstruction is an indication for the user to
revi‐ew the sample integrity, following established laboratory sample quality procedures.
A p‐ressure transducer has been introduced to support this new Pre Analytical Clog
Detection feature.
‐
Instrument software has been updated to support the new features.
2. Principles of Operation:
Following is an overview of the ACL TOP Family 50 Series control modules and
analytical technology:
A. Control Module (CM)
The CM provides a user interface and operation control. It consists of a personal
computer running Windows™ software, keyboard, touch screen display monitor,
mouse, and communications interfaces to the AM and external devices/systems. The
CM provides the major functionality associated with the user interface (UI) including
data management, data reduction, LIS (Laboratory Information System)
communications, sample identification, test materials management, fluid
management, reporting, test tracking and QC management, and monitoring.
B. Analytical Module (AM)
The AM consists primarily of sample and reagent handling hardware. It processes
reagents and auxiliary materials. It can perform coagulometric (turbidimetric),
chromogenic (absorbance), and immunological measurements.
C. Coagulometric (Turbidimetric) Measurement
The principle of coagulometric (turbidimetric) clot detection is used in the system to
measure and record the amount of time required for a plasma specimen to clot. This
2

--- Page 3 ---
technique assesses coagulation endpoint by measuring change in optical density.
Clot detection is based on the principle that light passing through a medium in which
fibrinogen is converted to fibrin is absorbed by the fibrin strands. Light (405 nm or
671 nm) is transmitted through a sample onto a photodetector, which is positioned
180° to the source. Light absorption increases as fibrin clot formation progresses.
Consequently, light transmittance through the sample continuously decreases and is
measured by the photodetector. The corresponding electrical signal output from the
photodetector changes according to the detected light. The signal output is processed
via software through a series of algorithms to determine the clot point.
D. Chromogenic (Absorbance) Measurement
Chromogenic tests can be either direct or indirect.
• Direct test – Test where the analyte of interest (e.g. protein C, plasminogen)
acts directly on a specified synthetic substrate.
• Indirect test – Test where the analyte of interest (antithrombin, plasmin
inhibitor) reacts with a fixed quantity of enzyme to form inactive complexes.
Under optimized test conditions, residual enzyme activity is then measured
using a specific synthetic substrate.
In most cases, the reaction is monitored at 405 nm by the continuous release of
paranitroaniline (pNA) from the synthetic substrate.
The chromogenic channels use the colorimetric principle of measuring absorbance in
the cuvette. An optical sensor reads light (405 nm) that passes through the cuvette.
The light is absorbed by the fluid in the cuvette in direct proportion to the
concentration of pNA. The amount of light reaching the photodetector is converted
into an electrical signal that is proportional to the enzyme activity.
E. Immunological Measurements
The principle of immunological measurement is used on the system to directly
measure and record the amount of an analyte. This technique assesses the physical
concentration of the analyte (and not its activity) by measuring change in optical
density. Although similar to the turbidimetric method, the immunological method
relies on the formation of antigen antibody complexes to affect light transmission.
Immunological testing of the ACL TOP uses the 405 nm or the 671 nm channels
depending on the test and the reag‐ent formulation. Both the 405 nm and the 671 nm
channels use the principle of measuring absorbance in the cuvette. An optical sensor
reads the light (405 nm or 671 nm) that passes through the cuvette. The light is
absorbed by the fluid in the cuvette in direct proportion to the concentration of
antigen antibody complexes. The amount of light reaching the photodetector is
converted into an electrical signal that is proportional or inversely proportional to the
analyte ‐concentration.

Method Comparison Study – External (Pre-Analytical HIL Check)
External method comparison studies for the new Pre Analytical HIL Check feature
were conducted at three US sites with patient samples. Testing at each site compared
a representative ACL TOP Family 50 Series model (‐ACL TOP 550 CTS) to the
reference devices listed in the table below. The Pre Analytical HIL Check feature
flagged sample results to alert instrument operators of potential HIL interference
specific to the assays requested for a sample. ‐

(see acceptance criteria above for the internal precision study).
c. Linearity:
An internal linearity study was performed on an ACL TOP 350 CTS, ACL TOP 550
CTS, ACL TOP 750 CTS and ACL TOP 750, using 10 representative commercially
available assays and prepared plasma pool panels at a minimum of 9 levels. Each of
the different panel levels was tested in quadruplicate on each instrument model with
the resultant data supporting equivalent linearity range claims to the current ACL
TOP Family. Linearity results for all assays on all instrument models passed the
acceptance criteria of Slope 1.0 ± 0.1 and r2 ≥ 0.960.
d. Carryover:
Sample Carryover: Hemoglobin
Hemoglobin carryover was assess in an internal study using two pools prepared as
follows: one with no interferent (Normal Pooled Plasma or NPP), and one with high
levels of interferent (hemoglobin). A series of samples of each pool were run in the
following sequence: NPP, NPP, interferent, interferent, interferent, interferent, and
NPP on each model instrument. The results for the seventh cup (i.e., NPP) were
compared to the NPP baseline results and percent difference was calculated by (test
result baseline/baseline) x 100. The hemoglobin carry over studies were performed
on the ACL TOP 350 CTS, ACL TOP 550 CTS, ACL TOP 750 and ACL TOP 750
CTS. ‐Results on all instruments passed the acceptance criteria of % change from
baseline +15%.
Sample Carryover: Bilirubin
Bilirubin carryover was assessed in an internal study using two pools prepared as
follows: one with no interferent (Normal Pooled Plasma or NPP), and one with high
levels of interferent (bilirubin). A series of samples of each pool were run in the
following sequence: NPP, NPP, interferent, interferent, interferent, interferent, and
NPP on each model instrument. The results for the seventh cup (i.e., NPP) were
compared to the NPP baseline results and percent difference was calculated by (test
result baseline/baseline) x 100. The bilirubin carry over studies were performed on
the ACL TOP 350 CTS, ACL TOP 550 CTS, ACL TOP 750 and ACL TOP 750 CTS.
Resul‐ts on all instruments passed the acceptance criteria of % change from baseline ≤
(4 within run SD/control mean) x100, using the within run SD and control (or
≤19.6%).
