L. Test Principle:
The LIAISON 1-84 PTH assay is a modified two-step, two-site sandwich assay that uses two
polyclonal antibodies for capture and detection of the 1-84 PTH molecule. The assay uses
150 µL of human serum or EDTA plasma incubated with and isoluminol conjugated
polyclonal antibody with high specificity for the N-terminus of the 1-84 peptide. Following
incubation, paramagnetic particles coated with a second polyclonal antibody that binds to the
C-terminal region of the 1-84 molecule are added to the reaction and incubated. The design
of these antibodies is intended to detect the whole intact 1-84 PTH with no cross reactivity to
fragments such as the 7-84 PTH fragment. After the second incubation, the unbound
material is removed with a wash cycle. The starter reagents are then added and a flash
chemiluminescent reaction is initiated. The light signal is measured by a photomultiplier as
relative light units (RLU) and is proportional to the concentration of 1-84 PTH present in the
calibrators, controls or samples.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
One sample pool of each sample type, serum and EDTA plasma, was spiked with
PTH 1-84 to achieve PTH levels above the measuring range of the assay and then was
diluted with a low patient sample of the same sample type to obtain intermediate PTH
concentrations. The low sample was further diluted with specimen diluent which
contains no PTH to levels near the claimed LoQ of the assay. Each of the resulting
19 concentrations, ranging from 0.3-2044 pg/mL for EDTA and 0.2- 1802 pg/mL for
serum, were analyzed by the LIAISON 1-84 PTH Assay in replicates of three. The
results were analyzed by a regression of observed mean PTH concentration versus
expected PTH concentration. The resulting equations for each sample type are shown
below:
Serum: y= 0.9992 x - 0.0835, R2= 0.9976
EDTA plasma: y= 0.9679 x – 3.328, R2 = 0.9971
The linearity results for both serum and EDTA plasma support the claimed measuring
range of this assay (4.0-1800 pg/mL).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The LIAISON 1-84 PTH Calibrators and Calibration Verifiers concentrations are
traceable to an in-house standard preparation containing synthetic human PTH (1-84).

Cross reactivity study: Testing was performed to assess the cross-reactivity of the
LIAISON 1-84 PTH Assay with other PTH fragments as well as structurally similar
proteins. Potential cross reactants, each at a concentration of 200,000 pg/mL, were
spiked into LIAISON1-84 PTH Specimen Diluent (horse serum-based zero sample)
and tested. The PTH fragments were tested in triplicate using one lot of reagent; and
the calcitonin, osteocalcin, and C-telopeptide cross-reactants were tested in
quadruplicate with a different kit lot of the assay. The equation used to calculate %
cross reactivity is as follows:
(Mean conc. of spiked sample - Mean conc. of the original sample) X 100 Spiked

Hook Effect Study: Testing was performed to determine if the LIAISON 1-84 PTH
Assay is susceptible to falsely low results in the presence of very high levels of PTH.
Three serum and 3 EDTA plasma samples were spiked with 1-84 PTH equal to
several concentrations above the assay measuring range of 1800 pg/mL. The spiked
samples were run in triplicate. No high dose hook effect was observed at 1-84 PTH
concentrations measured up to 60,000 pg/mL.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed following CLSI EP9-A3. The samples
tested consisted of 186 native EDTA plasma samples and 7 spiked samples for a total
of 193 samples. The mean of duplicate results for the comparator assay, Scantibodies
Laboratory Whole PTH (1-84) Specific, and singlicate results for the LIAISON 1-84
PTH Assay were compared. Passing and Bablok linear regression analyses were
performed and the following results were obtained:

b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed on 188 matched human sample sets of
EDTA plasma and serum. A total of 8 samples were spiked in order to span the
claimed measuring range. Each sample type was tested in singlicate using one
reagent lot. The matrix comparison analysis resulted in the following equation:
y=1.05x + 0.14 (y = serum, x= EDTA plasma), R2 = 0.9981
The study supports EDTA plasma and serum sample types for use with the LIAISON
1-84 PTH assay.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
To establish the expected reference range for the LIAISON 1-84 PTH assay, matched
pairs of EDTA plasma and serum samples from 125 apparently healthy adults, comprised
of 91 females and 34 males, ages 21-70 years old were tested. Subjects tested had normal
concentrations of 25OH vitamin D, TSH, total calcium, phosphorus, magnesium,
creatinine, and alkaline phosphatase. The Reference range for the LIAISON 1-84 PTH
was determined from 125 EDTA samples (91 females and 34 males) and 124 serum
samples (90 females and 34 males). Based on the parametric method with 95% reference
limit, the following reference range values were established:
O b s e r v e d Range 2.5th to 97.5th
Sample type N Median PTH (pg/mL) Percentile
EDTA plasma 125 25.0 5.72-45.4 pg/mL
Serum 124 25.2 5.68-47.8 pg/mL
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
