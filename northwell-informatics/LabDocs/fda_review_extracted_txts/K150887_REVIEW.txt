1. Intended use(s):
Para-Fix C&S Medium provides a method for collecting and preserving fecal specimens
for the culture of intestinal enteric bacteria. Because the medium is capable of
maintaining the bacteria for 96 hours, immediate transportation and processing of the
specimen is not necessary.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Para-Fix C&S Medium provides a method for collecting and preserving fecal specimens
for the culture of intestinal enteric bacteria. Because the medium is capable of
maintaining the bacteria for 96 hours, immediate transportation and processing of the
specimen is not necessary.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For in vitro diagnostic use only
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
None
I. Device Description:
Para-Fix C&S medium is supplied in a 30 mL vial that contains 15 ml of medium. The lid
has a built in sample collection spoon. The C&S medium is a non-nutritive, buffered,
isotonic solution with a pH indicator added. The medium also contains agar and sodium
thioglycolate to maintain a low oxygen tension for the preservation of anaerobic species.
The phenol red indicator will turn yellow when the solution is acidic and the conditions
are not optimal for recovery of the intended organisms. The transport vial is intended to
transport common enteric parasites found in the stool of infected patients. The kit does
not include a swab.

L. Test Principle:

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
The performance characteristics of Para-Fix C&S transport vials were determined by spiking
enteric organisms prepared either in Para-Fix C&S transport medium or in clinically negative
fecal matrix/Para-Fix C&S transport medium. Swab Elution and Roll-Plate methods were
used in accordance with the CLSI M40-A2 document to determine recovery of viable enteric
organisms. Initially, ten (10) enteric organisms in Para-Fix C&S transport medium were
tested using only the Swab Elution method. Subsequently, as an additional challenge, further
evaluation of the transport device was also performed using three (3) representative
organisms, which were tested in fecal matrix/Para-Fix C&S transport medium using both the
Swab Elution and Roll-Plate methods.
The 10 organisms listed below were added directly to Para-Fix C&S Medium and tested by
the Swab Elution Method:
Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212
Escherichia coli ATCC 8739
Shigella dysenteriae ATCC 9361
Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027
Salmonella enterica ATCC 10708
Vibrio parahaemolyticus ATCC 17802
Clostridium difficile ATCC 9689
Campylobacter jejuni ATCC 33291

The following 3 challenge organisms were spiked into clinically negative fecal matrix/Para-
Fix C&S Medium and tested by the Roll-Plate and Swab Elution Methods:
Escherichia coli O157 ATCC 43894
Salmonella enterica ATCC 10708
Vibrio parahaemolyticus ATCC 17802
Acceptance criteria for recovery of bacteria as recommended in the CLSI document M40-A2
were applied. No over growth limit is defined by CLSI M40-A2 at room temperature (20-
25°C) for the Swab Elution or Roll-Plate Methods because most commercial transport media
cannot control for it.
Manual colony counts were conducted for the Roll-Plate Method and the Swab Elution
Method at the four time intervals (0hr, 72hr, 96hr and 120hr) for the representative
organisms. The averages from 3 vials plated in duplicate, (n=6) were used to generate plate
counts and assess recovery and viability of organisms.
Swab Elution Method:
The results of the Swab Elution Method studies are presented in Table 1 for all enteric
organisms in Para-Fix C&S transport medium and in Table 2 for the three (3) representative
challenge enteric organisms in a mixture of Para-Fix C&S transport medium and fecal
matrix. The results demonstrate that the Para-Fix C&S Medium is able to support and
maintain acceptable viability of all organisms up to 96 hours when taken from pure culture
and up to 120 hours when spiked into fecal matrix, at both room temperature (20-25°C) and
under refrigerated (2-8°C) conditions. Acceptability is based on the acceptance criteria set
forth in CLSI M40-A2. For viability in the Swab Elution Method to be considered
acceptable, there shall be no more than a 3 log (1 x 103 +/- 10%) decline in CFU between
10
the zero-time CFU count and the CFU counts for the predetermined end time point. This was
demonstrated for all organisms tested.
Roll-Plate Method for Challenge Organisms:
The results of the Roll-Plate Method study are presented in Table 3 below for the three (3)
representative challenge enteric organisms. The results demonstrate that the Para-Fix C&S
Medium is able to maintain acceptable viability for all organisms up to 120 hours at room
temperature (20-25°C) and under refrigerated (2-8°C) conditions based on the acceptance
criteria set forth in CLSI M40-A2. For the transport system to demonstrate acceptable
viability by the Roll-Plate method, ≥5 CFU should be recovered following the specified
maintenance time from the specific dilution that yielded time-zero plate counts closest to 300
CFU.

Overgrowth Evaluation:
No over growth limit is defined by CLSI M40-A2 at room temperature (20-25°C) for the
Swab Elution or Roll-Plate Methods because most commercial transport media cannot
control for it. Para-Fix C&S is no different; overgrowth at room temperature (20-25°C) was
recorded as Too Numerous To Count (TNTC) for the studies conducted with fecal matrix.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Shelf life: The shelf life for Para-Fix C&S vials is 18 months after the date of
manufacture. The stability tests were performed on 3 lots of Para-Fix C&S Medium
up to 18 months of storage.
pH Stability: The pH value of Para-Fix C&S Medium up to 18 months of storage
was 7.08 to 7.83.
Sterilization: Para-Fix C&S Medium vials are not sold as sterile, nor are they
intended to be sterilized by the user. These vials are single use devices that do not
require cleaning by the operator. Although there is no sterility claim, the
manufacturing process includes treatment of finished vials in a steam chamber for 30
minutes to eliminate bioburden.

Bench testing studies were done to determine the ability of Para-Fix C&S Medium to
maintain viability of different strains of intestinal enteric bacteria with and without fecal
matrix. Para-Fix C&S Medium showed recovery of representative bacteria from fecal
matrix within the acceptance criteria recommended in CLSI-M40-A2 and similar to the
predicate device. (See above under Performance Characteristics).
