1. Intended use(s):
See Indication(s) for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Immunalysis Benzoylecgonine Urine Enzyme Immunoassay
The Immunalysis Benzoylecgonine Urine Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous
enzyme immunoassay with a dual cutoff of 150 ng/mL and 300 ng/mL. The assay is
intended for use in laboratories for the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of
Benzoylecgonine in human urine with automated clinical chemistry analyzers. This assay
is calibrated against Benzoylecgonine. This in-vitro device is for prescription use only.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as
GC-MS or permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures. The
Immunalysis Benzoylecgonine Urine Enzyme Immunoassay Kit provides only a
preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be
used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/ Mass
Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should
be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results
are used.
Immunalysis Benzoylecgonine Urine Calibrators

the calibration of assays for the analytes currently listed in the package insert:
Benzoylecgonine. The calibrators are designed for prescription use with homogenous
enzyme immunoassays on automated clinical chemistry analyzers.

I. Device Description:
The Immunalysis Benzoylecgonine Urine Enzyme Immunoassay Kit contains two reagents,
which are provided as ready-to-use:
· Antibody/Substrate Reagent (RA) – This reagent contains polyclonal sheep
antibodies to benzoylecgonine, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD) in Tris buffer with Sodium Azide as a preservative.
· Enzyme Conjugate Reagent (RE) – This reagent contains glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH) labeled with benzoylecgonine in Tris buffer with Sodium
Azide as a preservative.
The Immunalysis Benzoylecgonine Urine Calibrators and the Immunalysis Benzoylecgonine
Urine Control Sets are sold as individual bottles and are liquid and ready-to-use. The
negative calibrator is a processed, drug-free synthetic urine matrix with sodium azide as a
preservative. Each calibrator and control level contains a known concentration of
Benzoylecgonine spiked into the negative calibrator matrix.

L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on the competition of benzoylecgonine labeled enzyme glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and the free drug in the urine sample for the fixed
amount of antibody binding sites. In the absence of the free drug in the sample, the antibody
binds the drug enzyme conjugate and enzyme activity is inhibited. This creates a dose
response relationship between drug concentration in the urine sample and enzyme activity.
The enzyme G6PDH activity is determined at 340 nm spectrophotometrically by the
conversion of NAD to NADH.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study in the semi-quantitative mode was conducted by spiking a drug-free
urine pool with a high concentration of benzoylecgonine and generating serial
dilutions to achieve concentrations ranging from 100 ng/mL to 1100 ng/mL. Each
concentration was tested in triplicate and drug recovery calculated using the mean
concentration of the replicates. The results are summarized below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The analyte in the calibrator and controls is traceable to a commercially available
standard solution. The standard is certified material with the concentration verified by
GC-MS or LC/MS-MS. This standard is diluted with the proper calibrator buffer to
make the calibrator and controls to the desired concentrations. The concentrations are
confirmed by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry Analysis (GC/MS) and/or

Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS/MS).
Value Assignment/Expected Values
The Negative Calibrator is a processed, drug free urine matrix. The standard is
compared to a reference negative standard to ensure that it is free of analyte. A value
is assigned when the test is within the acceptable range.
The non-zero calibrators and the controls are prepared by spiking known
concentrations of benzoylecgonine into the negative calibrator matrix. The
concentrations are confirmed by GC/MS or LC/MS/MS. If any of the analytes are out
of the acceptable range, then the calibrator or control is adjusted and re-tested. Values
are assigned to the calibrator or control once the GC/MS or LC/MS/MS results are
within the acceptable range.
Stability
A closed-vial accelerated stability study and an onboard, open vial stability study
were conducted for the calibrators and controls. Real-time stability studies are
ongoing. All stability protocols were reviewed and found to be acceptable. These
studies support the closed vial stability claim of one year and the opened vial stability
claim of 28 days when calibrators and controls are stored at 2-8°C.

Not applicable.

Non-structurally related compounds
Potential interference from non-structurally related drugs and metabolites was
evaluated in the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes by spiking these compounds
into drug free urine containing benzoylecgonine at ± 25% of the 150 ng/mL cutoff
(112.5 ng/mL and 187.5 ng/mL) and ± 25% of the 300 ng/mL cutoff (225 ng/mL and

Endogenous compounds
Potential interference from endogenous compounds was evaluated in the qualitative
and semi-quantitative modes by spiking these compounds into drug free urine
containing benzoylecgonine at ± 25% of the 150 ng/mL cutoff (112.5 ng/mL and
187.5 ng/mL) and ± 25% of the 300 ng/mL cutoff (225 ng/mL and 375 ng/mL). The
results were the same for the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes and are

to cause false negative results at + 25% of the 150 and 300 ng/mL cutoffs in both the
qualitative and semiquantitative modes and the following statement is provided in the
limitations section of the labeling: “Boric Acid is not recommended as a preservative for
urine.

pH and Specific Gravity
To evaluate potential interference from the pH of urine, device performance in the
qualitative and semi-quantitative modes was tested using a range of urine pH values
(3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0 and 11.0). All test samples were prepared in drug
free urine containing benzoylecgonine at ± 25% of the 150 ng/mL cutoff (112.5
ng/mL and 187.5 ng/mL) and ± 25% of the 300 ng/mL cutoff (225 ng/mL and 375
ng/mL). No positive or negative interference was observed at urine pH values ranging
from 3.0 to 11.0 for each test mode.
To evaluate potential interference from the specific gravity of urine, device
performance in the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes was tested using a range
of urine specific gravity values (1.000, 1.002, 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025 and
1.030). All test samples were prepared in drug free urine containing benzoylecgonine
at ± 25% of the 150 ng/mL cutoff (112.5 ng/mL and 187.5 ng/mL) and ± 25% of the
300 ng/mL cutoff (225 ng/mL and 375 ng/mL). No positive or negative interference
was observed at urine specific gravity values ranging from 1.000 to 1.030 for each
test mode.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentrations of 150 ng/mL and 300 ng/mL is described in the precision section,
M.1.a. above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Eighty unaltered urine samples from clinical testing laboratories were analyzed for
benzoylecgonine by the candidate device on the Beckman Coulter AU400e clinical
chemistry analyzer and with LC/MS. Results were obtained in both qualitative and
semi-quantitative modes and are summarized below:
