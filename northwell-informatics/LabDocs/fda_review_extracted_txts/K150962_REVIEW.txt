L. Test Principle:
The Simplexa™ HSV 1 & 2 Direct system is a real-time PCR for the direct amplification,
detection and differentiation of HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA from unprocessed genital lesion
samples without nucleic acid extraction. The system consists of the Simplexa™ HSV 1 & 2
Direct, the 3M Integrated Cycler (with 3M Integrated Cycler Studio Software), the Direct
Amplification Disc and associated accessories.
In the Simplexa™ HSV 1 & 2 Direct assay reaction, bi-functional fluorescent probe-primers
are used together with corresponding reverse primers to amplify HSV-1, HSV-2 and internal
control (IC) targets. Well conserved regions of the HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA polymerase
genes are targeted to identify HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA, respectively, in the sample. The IC is
used to detect PCR failure and/or inhibition. The principle of the test and the procedural steps
are summarized below.
Sample Collection:
The acceptable specimen type is a swab sample collected from a herpetic genital lesion and
stored in BD UVT, Remel M4, Remel M4RT, Remel M5, Remel M6 or UTM transport
media. The manufacturer’s package inserts should be followed for collection media and
acceptable swab types. Calcium alginate swabs should not be used, as they may contain
substances that inhibit PCR testing. Specimens should be transported on ice and stored at 2
to 8°C for up to 7 days post collection. If there is a delay greater than 7 days before
processing of the specimen, store specimen at -70° C.
Real-Time PCR Instrument Setup:
The 3M Integrated Cycler Operator Manual provides details on how to configure the 3M
Integrated Cycler Studio Software, to add an assay definition, and to set up and analyze runs
on the 3M Integrated Cycler.
Direct Amplification Disc Loading and Real-Time PCR Amplification:
1. Select samples that need to be tested.
2. Thaw Reaction Mix vials at room temperature (approximate range 18 to 25°C). Thaw one
Reaction Mix vial for each sample or control to be tested.
3. Scan the barcode on the Simplexa™ HSV 1 & 2 Direct Reaction Mix vial or barcode
card.
4. Scan the disc barcode on the Direct Amplification Disc (DAD).
5. Scan or type in each sample identifier.
6. For one wedge at a time, peel the adhesive foil back to expose the Sample (SAMPLE)
and Reaction (R) wells without completely removing the adhesive foil cover (Figures 1 &
2). Avoid touching the under side of the foil that will be in contact with the wells and disc
surface.
7. Ensure that the Reaction Mix is completely thawed. Briefly spin down the tubes as
needed. (Do not vortex the Reaction Mix).
8. Use the fixed volume pipette to transfer 50 µL of the Reaction Mix into the Reaction (R)
well.
5

--- Page 6 ---
9. Use the fixed volume pipette to transfer 50 µL of sample or control; pipette sample or
control into the Sample well (SAMPLE).
10. Cover the wedge sealing the wells with the peeled adhesive foil, pressing down firmly
near the edge of the wedge. If the original foil is torn, do not load the wells in the wedge.
Instead load another wedge.
11. Tear off the tab portion of the foil cover along the perforation.
12. Repeat steps 6 to 11 for the next sample(s).
13. Load the sealed Direct Amplification Disc into the 3M Integrated Cycler and start the
run.

Sample and Reaction Wells for wedge #3 [R] Wells
Interpretation of Results:
Upon completion of the run, the Integrated Cycler Studio Software automatically calculates
and displays results. The display presents the user with a separate report box for each of the
analytes as well as the IC. The IC can be reported as “valid” or “invalid”.
The software reports one of four possible outcomes for each of HSV-1 and HSV-2 after a run
is completed for each sample ID entered: “Detected”, “Not Detected”, “Invalid” or “EC500”.
a. “Detected” result indicates that HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 DNA were detected in the patient
sample tested (whether the DNA IC was detected or not detected).
b. “Not Detected” result indicates that HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 DNA were not detected in the
patient sample tested whereas the DNA IC was detected.
c. “Invalid” result points to the inability to detect presence or absence of HSV-1 and/or
HSV-2 DNA in the patient sample. This result may be due to:
1. DNA Internal Control (DNA IC) failure, or
2. Failure to detect sufficient sample.
If an invalid result occurs, the sample needs to be re-tested per the instructions provided
in the device Package Insert.

d. “EC500” result points to a data quality error for the particular viral analyte(s). The
software was unable to determine a valid amplification for that analyte(s). The sample
should be re-tested.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the Simplexa™ HSV 1 & 2 Direct assay was evaluated at three
investigative sites by assessing the device's inter-site, inter-day and inter/intra-assay
reproducibility. Each of the laboratories tested the positive control and a panel of five
contrived sample pools including a low (approximately 1-2 times LoD) and medium
positive (approximately 2-4 times LoD) for each analyte and a high negative. The
high negative sample contained a small amount of HSV-1 and HSV-2, and it was
designed to be negative approximately 95% of the time. The assays were performed
in triplicate on five different days. Each site had two operators; each operator assayed
the entire sample panel and positive control once per day, for a total of two sets of
data per day. The combined results for all sites are presented in the tables below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The positive control for this product is a blend of inactivated HSV-1 and HSV-2
provided in single use aliquots frozen at -20°C. The positive control has been
assigned an expiration date of 12 months at -20°C.
To assess the room temperature stability of the positive control, aliquots of the
positive control were thawed and kept at room temperature for up to 24 hours, and
were then evaluated. No significant change in detection of each target analyte was
observed when positive control was stored on the bench top at room temperature for
24 hours. Based on these results, positive control is stable for at least 24 hours at
room temperature.
d. Assay cut-off:
The Ct cut-offs for the Simplexa™ HSV 1 & 2 Direct assay were determined during
feasibility and verification studies. During verification, all studies were performed to
a maximum of 45 cycles of amplification for informational use, but the data were
calculated with a cut-off of Ct=40 for the HSV-1 and HSV-2 targets. When the
verification data were analyzed, there were some results that prompted the Ct cut-off
for HSV-2 to be re-set from Ct=40 to Ct=42. The LoD verification study detected
HSV-2 between a Ct of 40 and 41 for four replicates at HSV-2 concentrations below
the established HSV-2 LoD concentration. No HSV-2 LoD replicates (at or below
LoD concentration) were detected beyond Ct=41. The HSV-1 cut-off was not
adjusted from Ct=40 because no HSV-1 LoD replicates from the LoD verification
study were detected at a Ct>40. Based on the results of the verification studies, the
final cut-offs were set at Ct=40 for HSV-1 and at Ct=42 for HSV-2. The PCR cycling
protocol was reduced to 42 cycles because all target cut-offs are at Ct≤42. The Ct cut-
offs and cycling protocol is stored in the assay definition for the Simplexa™ HSV 1
& 2 Direct.
e. Detection limit (LoD):
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined for the Simplexa™ HSV 1 & 2 Direct
assay using quantified stocks of HSV-1 and HSV-2 serially diluted into negative
genital swab matrix containing male and female genital swabs. The LoD was
determined to be the lowest concentration that could be detected positive > 95% of
the time.

f. Analytical Reactivity:
The analytical reactivity of the Simplexa™ HSV 1 & 2 Direct assay was evaluated
using different strains of HSV-1 and HSV-2 that were not used in the determination
of the limit of detection (LoD) for the assay. Quantified viral material was spiked into
negative genital swab matrix containing male and female genital swabs using a single
dilution and assayed in triplicate. The Simplexa™ HSV 1 & 2 Direct assay was able
to detect other strains of HSV-1 and HSV-2 viruses.

Cross-Reactivity
The analytical specificity of the Simplexa™ HSV 1 & 2 Direct assay was evaluated
by testing the ability to exclusively identify HSV-1 and HSV-2 viruses with no cross-
reactivity to organisms that are closely related, or cause similar clinical symptoms or
may be present on swabs of the genital region. Thirty six (36) potential cross-
reactants were spiked into negative genital swab matrix containing male and female
genital swabs and assayed in triplicate. No cross-reactivity was observed.

Competitive Interference
Competitive interference was studied to evaluate the effects of clinically relevant co-
infections with each of the analytes detected by the Simplexa™ HSV 1 & 2 Direct
assay. The study assessed whether a high concentration of one virus in the sample
could potentially affect the Simplexa™ HSV 1 & 2 Direct assay performance for
another target present at low levels. A low positive sample was contrived at
approximately 4 times LoD for each target (HSV-1 McIntryre strain and HSV-2 G
strain), and a baseline Ct was determined for each sample. Each potential concomitant
infecting virus was spiked into the low level sample and assayed in triplicate.
Baseline sample results are also shown below. No competitive interference was
observed as summarized in the following table.

The Simplexa™ HSV 1 & 2 Direct assay was evaluated by testing the ability to
identify HSV-1 and HSV-2 viruses when other potentially inhibitory organisms are
present. The panel of thirty-six (36) potentially inhibitory organisms was individually
spiked into a pool with a low concentration (approximately 4 times LoD) of HSV-1

and HSV-2 in genital swab matrix. Each microorganism sample was initially tested in
triplicate and if any one of the replicates was “Not Detected” for either the HSV-1 or
the HSV-2 targets then five additional replicates were tested to confirm if any
inhibition was caused by the microorganism. If the majority (>4/8) replicates were
“Not Detected” then an inhibitory effect was determined. None of the
microorganisms caused >4/8 of the replicates to be “Not Detected”. The results are
summarized in the table below.

h. Sample stability studies:
Storage conditions were validated by spiking various transport media with HSV at
concentrations ranging from 3 times LoD to 50 times LoD and testing at different
storage temperatures and durations. The following transport media were evaluated:
BD VTM, M4, M4RT, M5, M6, and UTM.
The studies indicated that samples should be transported on ice and can be stored at 2
to 8°C for up to 7 days post collection.
i. Stability studies:
A real-time stability was completed over a 14 month time period and the data support
a shelf-life claim of 12 months for the Simplexa™ HSV 1 & 2 Direct and the
Simplexa™ HSV 1 & 2 Positive Control Pack.
j. Carryover contamination:
The amplification carry-over for the Simplexa™ HSV 1 & 2 Direct assay was
assessed from the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct (K120413) viral assay, and can
be found on the FDA website. The study can be applied to the Simplexa™ HSV 1 &

2 Direct assays as the study is not analyte specific. In the Simplexa™ Flu A/B &
RSV Direct (K120413), the amplification carry-over study searched for the presence
of contamination in negative samples adjacent to strong positive samples. The study
was designed by alternately placing high positive and negative samples on each disc.
No evidence of carry-over contamination was observed.

Prospective Study
A total of 718 genital swab samples, was prospectively collected from patients with
signs and symptoms of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection from 6
geographically diverse locations. Of the 718 samples collected, 9 samples were
removed from the analysis because they were either not tested or had invalid results
with the 3 assays (Simplexa™ HSV 1 & 2 Direct, culture or bi-directional
sequencing) that were used in the clinical study . Of the 709 remaining samples, 13
samples were removed from the analysis because there was insufficient volume to
generate a final comparator result. A total of 696 samples, was used for the analysis.
The clinical performance of the Simplexa HSV 1 & HSV 2 assay was evaluated by
comparing the positive and negative percent agreement to a composite comparator
algorithm consisting of culture, bi-directional sequencing and an FDA cleared NAAT.
A positive result for HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 was determined by a positive test result in
either the culture or the bi-directional sequencing. If both the culture and the bi-
directional sequencing yielded positive results but disagreed in the differentiation of
HSV-1 versus HSV-2, the results of the FDA cleared NAAT were used and a 2 out of
3 rule was followed to determine the type of the virus (e.g. if two of the methods were
16

--- Page 17 ---
positive for HSV-1, the final comparator result was HSV-1 positive). All sites
collected and tested the genital swab samples on the Simplexa™ HSV-1 and HSV-2
Direct and sent samples to a central lab for culture testing. For culture, each sample
was tested for HSV- 2 first and, if positive for HSV-2, no further testing was
performed. Samples that were HSV-2 culture negative were further tested for HSV-1
culture positivity. Dual positives could not be identified in the culture assay.
The available retained samples were sent to Focus Diagnostics and tested in a
validated bi-directional sequencing assay. Of the 24 discordant samples that were
positive for HSV-2 by the culture method but positive for HSV-1 by the bi-directional
sequencing assay, 18 samples had valid results and 1 sample had an invalid result
when tested on an FDA cleared NAAT. There were 5 samples that were not tested on
the FDA cleared NAAT due to insufficient volume and therefore 6 out of 24 samples
were excluded from the analysis. There were 2 samples that were positive for HSV-1
by the culture method but positive for HSV-2 by the bi-directional sequencing assay
that were not tested on the FDA cleared NAAT for insufficient volume and therefore
were excluded from analysis. The results for Simplexa™ HSV 1 & 2 Direct
compared to the composite comparator algorithm are presented in the following

*Positive Predictive Value (PPV) was calculated using:
(Sensitivity x Prevalence)/(Sensitivity x Prevalence + [1 - Specificity] x [1 - Prevalence]).
**Negative Predictive Value (NPV ) was calculated using:
(Specificity x [1 - Prevalence])/([1 - Sensitivity] x Prevalence + Specificity x [1 - Prevalence]).
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
