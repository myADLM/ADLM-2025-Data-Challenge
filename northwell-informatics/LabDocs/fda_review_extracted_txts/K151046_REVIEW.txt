H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The illumigene HSV 1&2 DNA amplification assay, performed on the illumipro-10™, is
a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the direct detection and differentiation of herpes
simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) DNA in
cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesion specimens from male and female patients suspected
of Herpetic infections.
illumigene HSV 1&2 utilizes loop-mediated isothermal DNA amplification (LAMP)
technology to detect HSV-1 and HSV-2 by targeting segments of the herpes simplex
virus 1 and herpes simplex virus 2 genomes. Results from illumigene HSV 1&2 are used
as an aid in the diagnosis of HSV infection in symptomatic patients.
The assay is intended for use in hospital, reference or state laboratory settings. This
device is not intended for nonlaboratory point-of-care use.
WARNING: illumigene HSV 1&2 is not FDA cleared for use with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
or to aid in the diagnosis of HSV infections of the central nervous system (CNS). The device
is not intended for prenatal screening.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Testing is performed on the illumipro-10™ Automated Isothermal Amplification and
Detection System from Meridian Bioscience, Inc.
I. Device Description:
The illumigene Molecular Diagnostic Test System is comprised of the illumigene
HSV 1&2 DNA Amplification Assay Test Kit, the illumigene HSV 1&2 External
Control Kit, and the illumipro-10™ Automated Isothermal Amplification and Detection
System.
The illumigene HSV 1&2 molecular assay utilizes loop-mediated amplification (LAMP)
technology to detect herpes simplex virus in cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesion swab
specimens. The illumigene HSV 1&2 kit includes the illumigene Sample Preparation
Apparatus III (SMP PREP III), illumigene HSV 1 Test Devices, illumigene HSV 2
2

--- Page 3 ---
Test Devices, Mineral Oil, illumigene Heat Treatment Tubes, and 50 µL transfer
pipettes. The specimen is added directly to the single-use SMP PREP III, which
contains buffer and formalin-treated E. coli harboring S. aureus DNA. The S. aureus
DNA serves as internal control DNA. A sample processed through the SMP PREP III is
then heat-treated to make target and internal control DNA available for amplification.
The heat-treated sample is added to each illumigene HSV 1 and illumigene HSV 2 Test
Device. Mineral oil is added to each illumigene Test Device to prevent evaporation.
The illumigene HSV Test Device is a two-chambered device containing lyophilized
amplification reagents (DNA polymerase, deoxynucleotide triphosphates) and either
HSV-1 or 2-specific primers in the TEST chamber and S. aureus-specific primers in the
CONTROL chamber. The illumigene HSV 2 Test Device is visually identified by an
orange band on the Test Device closure tab.
The illumipro-10 heats each illumigene HSV 1 and HSV 2 Test Device containing
prepared sample and control material, facilitating amplification of target and internal
control DNA. When HSV-1 or HSV-2 is present in the specimen, a 208 base pair
sequence (bp) of the HSV-1 glycoprotein G (US4) gene or a 189 bp sequence of the
HSV-2 glycoprotein G (US4) gene is amplified and magnesium pyrophosphate is
generated. Magnesium pyrophosphate forms a precipitate in the reaction mixture.
The illumipro-10 monitors the absorbance characteristics of the reaction solutions at the
assay Run Start (Signal initial, Si) and at the assay Run End (Signal final, Sf). The
illumipro-10 calculates the change in light transmission between Run End and Run
Start (Sf:Si) and compares the ratio to a fixed cut-off value for disposition of results.
Fixed cut-off values for the CONTROL chamber are used to determine validity. Fixed
cut-off values for the TEST chamber are used to report sample results.
CONTROL chamber Sf:Si ratios less than 90% are considered valid and allow for
reporting of TEST chamber results. CONTROL chamber Sf:Si ratios greater than or
equal to 90% are considered invalid and prevent reporting of TEST chamber results.
Invalid CONTROL chamber reactions are reported as ‘INVALID’. TEST chamber Sf:Si
ratios less than 82% are reported as ‘POSITIVE’; TEST chamber Sf:Si ratios greater
than or equal to 82% are reported as ‘NEGATIVE’. Numerical values are not reported.
More stringent cut-off criteria are applied to the CONTROL chamber reaction to
ensure amplification is not inhibited, reagents are performing as intended and that
sample processing was performed appropriately.
The illumigene HSV 1&2 External Controls Kit contains a combined HSV-1 and HSV-2
Positive Control and a Negative Control (Negative Control IV) for use in routine Quality
Control testing. External Control reagents are provided to assist the user in detection of
reagent deterioration, adverse environmental or test conditions, or variance in operator
performance that may lead to test errors.

L. Test Principle:
The illumigene HSV 1&2 assay is based on loop mediated isothermal amplification
technology (LAMP). Loop mediated amplification of DNA is accomplished by the use of
specially designed primers that provide specific and continuous isothermal amplification.
When HSV target DNA is present in the patient sample, the target sequence is amplified.
Magnesium pyrophosphate, a by-product of DNA amplification, will reach saturation and
precipitate thereby producing a turbid solution in the TEST chamber of the test device.
When sample preparation has been performed successfully and inhibition has not
occurred, the internal control DNA in the CONTROL chamber of the test device will
amplify. Magnesium pyrophosphate produced by the DNA amplification will precipitate
and form a turbid solution in the CONTROL chamber.
The illumipro-10™ instrument detects the change in light transmission through the reaction
mixture created by precipitating magnesium pyrophosphate. Sample results are reported as
Positive or Negative based on the detected change in light transmission. If there is a failure
in the amplification of the internal control DNA in the CONTROL chamber, an Invalid
report is provided.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility studies were performed at three illumigene HSV 1&2 clinical sites.
Studies were conducted using blind coded panels consisting of moderately positive
(n=3), low positive (n=3), high negative (n=6) and negative (n=6) samples for each of
HSV-1 and HSV-2. Contrived moderately positive, low positive and high negative
samples were prepared by inoculating simulated negative matrix (cheek swab matrix
in MicroTest™ M4® medium) with HSV-1 (strain HF) and HSV-2 (strain MS) to the
final concentrations indicated in Table 1. The moderate and low positive samples for
HSV-1 were used as the negative samples for HSV-2 and vice versa. Qualification of
each sample included baseline testing in triplicate with illumigene HSV 1&2 prior to
storage at -70°C. The frozen samples were thawed and tested in twenty (20) replicates
with each of three kit lots of illumigene HSV 1&2 to qualify the samples according to
the overall expected correlation in Table 1.

Three lots of illumigene HSV 1&2 and five illumipro-10 instruments were used in
the reproducibility studies. Positive and Negative Controls were tested with each
panel. Each clinical site tested two panels each day for five days. At least two
operators at each facility performed the testing to demonstrate reproducibility. The
results from the reproducibility study are provided in Table 2 below:

The expected correlation for each sample type was achieved for all samples except
the HSV-2 Near Cut-Off sample which demonstrated a higher overall negative
correlation (87.8%) for all sites combined. By definition, the sample was designed to
generate a positive or negative result with low probability (20-80%). Therefore, the
sample type range is difficult to target with a qualitative assay such as the illumigene
HSV 1&2 assay. The High Negative sample was manufactured at a higher confidence
range (95% negative) and met all expected correlation specifications, demonstrating
reproducibility with a high negative sample. The studies demonstrate that the
reproducibility of the illumigene HSV 1&2 assay with the illumipro-10 is acceptable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable as the illumigene HSV 1&2 DNA Amplification Assay is a qualitative
assay.
c. Specimen Stability:
Specimen Stability
Sample stability was evaluated to determine transport and storage conditions prior
to sample preparation. The study included testing of cheek swab matrix and vaginal
swab matrix specimens stored in each viral transport medium to be evaluated. Three
simulated negative samples and three combined HSV-1/HSV-2 low positive
samples were each tested in triplicate for the baseline sample type (MicroTest™
M4® medium/polyester swab). One simulated negative sample and one combined
HSV-1/HSV-2 low positive sample were tested in triplicate for each additional viral

or 1.5X the limit of detection for the illumigene HSV 1&2 kit used for the study.
Specimen stability was evaluated by storing prepared specimens at the upper
temperature limit (32 ± 2°C; actual maximum: 30.9°C) or refrigerated (2-8°C) prior
to initiation of illumigene HSV 1&2 Specimen Preparation. Specimens stored at 32 ±
2°C were tested through a minimum of 25 hours and specimens stored refrigerated
were tested through 8 days.
The results support the stability claim that specimens stored in viral transport
medium may be held refrigerated (2-8°C) for up to 7 days prior to initiation of
illumigene HSV 1&2 Specimen Preparation.
Specimens stored at 32 ± 2°C for a minimum of 25 hours did not meet the acceptance
criteria for all transport media. This temperature storage will not be included in the
illumigene HSV 1&2 DNA Amplification Assay Package Insert as an acceptable
specimen storage condition.

Amplification Assay. The study included testing of cheek swab matrix and vaginal
swab matrix specimens stored in each viral transport medium to be evaluated. Three
simulated negative specimens and three combined HSV-1/HSV-2 low positive
specimens were tested in triplicate for the baseline sample type (MicroTest™ M4®
medium/polyester swab). One simulated negative specimen and one combined
HSV-1/HSV-2 low positive specimen were tested in triplicate for each additional
viral transport medium. The viral transport media evaluated are the same as
summarized in Table 3.
Simulated negative matrix was prepared by inoculation of each viral transport
medium with confirmed negative cheek or vaginal specimens collected with
traditional-tipped flocked or polyester swabs. Contrived HSV-1/HSV-2 combined
low positive specimens were prepared by inoculating simulated negative matrix
with HSV-1 strain MacIntyre (VR-539) and HSV-2 strain G (VR-734) to
approximately 1.48 x 105 TCID /mL and 1.80 x 103 TCID /mL, respectively, or
50 50
1.5X the limit of detection for the illumigene HSV 1&2 kit lot used for the study
(LoD: HSV-1, 9.89 x 104 TCID /mL and HSV-2, 1.20 x 103 TCID /mL).
50 50
Specimens processed through SMP PREP III were stored at the upper temperature
limit (32 ± 2°C; actual maximum: 30.9°C) or refrigerated (2-8°C) prior to initiation
of heat treatment. Specimens stored at 32 ± 2°C and refrigerated were tested through
at least 3 hours. External Positive and Negative Controls were tested daily.
Specimens that produced unacceptable results were repeated by two technicians in
duplicate.
The cheek and vaginal specimens processed through SMP PREP III and then stored at
32 ± 2°C produced acceptable results with storage up to 3 hours prior to heat
treatment for all transport media. One contrived positive vaginal matrix sample
prepared in ViraTrans VTM and stored refrigerated (2-8°C) for 3 hours produced
unacceptable results with illumigene HSV 1 only (1/3 replicates produced false
negative results). Repeat testing confirmed the previous false negative results (4/4
false negative results).
As a result of the failure observed at 2-8°C storage with HSV-1 contrived positive
vaginal matrix specimens prepared in ViraTrans VTM, additional testing was carried
out to support the lower limit of the claimed 19-30°C range for processed specimen
stability. The additional testing was performed with HSV-1 in vaginal matrix in
ViraTrans VTM, MicroTest M4, and MicroTest M4RT at 17 ± 2°C).
The study results support storage of SMP PREP III processed specimens for up to 2
hours at 19-30°C prior to heat treatment.

d. Kit Stability
Data derived from accelerated stability studies support an initial shelf life claim of the
test kit for 18 months at 2-30°C. Accelerated stability testing was performed with
three lots of SMP PREP III, illumigene HSV 1 Test Devices, and illumigene HSV 2
Test Devices. Real-time stability studies are ongoing.
e. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators
No calibrators are supplied or used with this assay.
Controls
External Controls: The illumigene HSV 1&2 External Controls Kit contains a
combined HSV-1 and HSV-2 Positive Control and a Negative Control (Negative
Control IV) for use in routine Quality Control testing and is sold separately from
the illumigene HSV 1&2 DNA Amplification Assay Kit. The external Positive
Control contains non-infectious plasmid DNA with either HSV-1 or HSV-2
inserts. The external Negative Control consists of buffer. It is recommended that
external controls are run with each new lot and new shipment of illumigene HSV
1&2 kits. External control testing should be performed thereafter in accordance
with appropriate federal, state and local guidelines. External control reagents are
provided to aid the user in detection of reagent deterioration, adverse
environmental or test conditions, or variance in operator performance that may
lead to test errors. Results from the illumigene HSV 1&2 test kit should not be
reported if external controls do not produce the expected results.
Storage Conditions: External Control reagents are intended to be stored at 2-
8°C when not in use.
Stability: Accelerated stability testing of the external controls supports a
stability claim of 18 months at 2-8°C. Accelerated stability testing was
performed with three lots of Positive Control and Negative Control IV. Real
time studies to confirm the shelf life claim are ongoing.
Traceability: Traceability to reference material does not apply to the External
Controls. Controls are prepared from fully documented materials.
Validation: The performance of External Positive and Negative Controls
were validated during the clinical trials.
Internal Control DNA: Primers for amplification of the internal control DNA are
incorporated into each device in the CONTROL chamber. Internal control DNA is
11

--- Page 12 ---
present in the SMP PREP III buffer as formalin-treated E. coli cells harboring a
plasmid carrying a segment of the S. aureus genome and is thus combined with
each specimen and processed through all steps of the procedure. The internal
control DNA is present to monitor for sample processing, amplification inhibition,
and assay reagent integrity.
Storage Conditions: The illumigene HSV 1&2 kit components are intended
to be stored at 2-30°C when not in use.
Stability: The stability of the internal control DNA has been studied as part of
the kit.
Traceability: Traceability to reference material does not apply to the SMP
PREP III or Test Devices. Components are prepared from fully documented
materials.
Validation: The performance of the illumigene HSV 1&2 kit components,
including the internal control DNA, was validated as part of the clinical trials.
f. Assay cut-off:
The illumigene HSV 1&2 assay is manufactured with fixed cut-off values. The
product is designed with a pre-selected cut-off value and amplification reagent
concentrations are optimized to ensure appropriate reactions are obtained.
Development optimization included the evaluation of characterized positive and
negative clinical specimens. Amplification reagent concentrations were adjusted
during design as needed to ensure that illumigene HSV 1&2 assay results are
aligned with clinical specimen reported results.
Cut-off values are applied as described in the Device Description section.
g. Detection limit (LoD):
Analytical Sensitivity studies were designed to determine the analytical limit of
detection (LoD) of the illumigene herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 DNA
Amplification Assay. The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration of analyte
(TCID /mL) that gives a 95% positivity rate.
50
Two strains of HSV-1 (HF and MacIntyre) and two strains of HSV-2 (G and MS)
diluted in a simulated negative cheek swab matrix (MicroTest™ M4® viral transport
medium inoculated with HSV negative cheek swabs) were used to establish the LoD
with three kit lots of illumigene HSV 1&2 and six illumipro-10 instruments. A
minimum of four dilutions near the expected LoD were evaluated for each HSV
strain during preliminary testing of twenty (20) individually prepared replicates.
Replicates for each dilution were tested with the illumigene HSV 1&2 DNA
Amplification Assay; however, testing for a specific concentration was discontinued
12

--- Page 13 ---
when more than one negative result was obtained. The lowest dilution producing
positive results in a minimum of 19 of 20 replicates was identified as the tentative
LoD. The tentative LoD for HSV-1was determined to be 7.20 x 103 TCID /mL for
50
the HF Strain (VR-260) and 9.89 x 104 TCID /mL for the MacIntyre Strain (VR-
50
539). For HSV-2, the tentative LoD was 1.20 x 103 TCID /mL for the G Strain (VR-
50
734) and 533 TCID /mL for the MS Strain (VR-540).
50
Confirmatory LoD studies were done through testing of an additional 60 individually
prepared replicates at the identified preliminary LoD for each strain. The target
dilutions were prepared by two technicians who did not prepare the original dilution
series. If the selected target dilution did not meet acceptance criteria for LoD
(minimum of 57/60 positive), the next dilution containing a greater concentration of
measurand was prepared and tested in 60 replicates. All testing was performed using
three kit lots of illumigene HSV 1&2 and six illumipro-10 instruments.
External Positive and Negative Controls were tested daily during preliminary and
final LoD assessment by each technician for each kit lot.
The overall confirmed analytical LoD by HSV strain for illumigene HSV 1&2 is
summarized below:

The final confirmed LoD for the illumigene HSV 1&2 Assay is 9.89 x 104
TCID /mL for HSV-1 and 1.60 x 103 TCID /mL for HSV-2.
50 50
h. Analytical Reactivity:
Analytical sensitivity of illumigene HSV 1&2 was verified through testing of
twenty (20) HSV-1 and twenty (20) HSV-2 confirmed positive clinical specimens
from a variety of anatomical locations (i.e. oral, genital, anorectal, etc.) at the assay
LoD. Each clinical sample was quantified and diluted in the corresponding viral
transport medium to 9.89 x 104 TCID /mL or 1.60 x 103 TCID /mL for HSV-1
50 50
and HSV-2, respectively; specimens quantified at concentrations less than the limit
of detection were tested undiluted. All specimens were detected by illumigene HSV
1&2 at LoD or lower, except one HSV-1 clinical sample, which was detected at 7.20
x 107 TCID /mL.

i. Analytical specificity/ Cross-Reactivity:
Cross-reactivity studies were performed to determine if potential microbial co-
contaminants of cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesion swab specimens react with the
illumigene HSV 1&2 DNA Amplification Assay. Potential interference of the
illumigene HSV 1&2 DNA Amplification Assay with these microbial organisms was
also evaluated.
Simulated negative samples were prepared by vortexing traditional-tipped polyester
swabs in MicroTest™ M4® viral transport medium. Contrived HSV-1/HSV-2
combined low positive samples were prepared by inoculating simulated negative
matrix with HSV-1 (strain HF) and HSV-2 (strain MS) to approximately 1.08 x 104
TCID /mL and 2.40 x 103 TCID /mL, respectively, or 1.5X the limit of detection
50 50
(LoD) for these strains.
Potentially cross-reactive microorganisms were added to simulated negative and
contrived positive samples at minimum concentrations of 1.0 x 106 CFU/mL (bacteria
and fungi) or 1.0 x 105 TCID /mL or comparable units (viruses). Quantified genomic
50
DNA or RNA used for microorganisms and human genomic DNA was tested at 1.0 x
106 copies/mL (cp/mL) or higher. Negative and positive samples spiked with
potential cross-reacting microorganisms were tested in triplicate.
External Positive and Negative Controls were tested daily. Dilution Controls were
prepared by adding 0.85% saline or Tris-EDTA buffer in place of the potentially
cross-reactive organisms or genetic material. Matrix Controls (prepared negative and
positive matrix alone) and Dilution Controls were tested in triplicate.
None of the following organisms or their genetic material reacted with the
illumigene HSV 1&2 DNA Amplification Assay:
Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Bacteroides fragilis, Bordetella
bronchiseptica, Bordetella pertussis, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida

Human genomic DNA was nonreactive at 1.0 x 106 copies/mL. In addition, there
was no competitive inhibition observed from the organisms listed above with HSV-1
or HSV-2 in the illumigene HSV 1&2 assay.
j. Interference Studies:
Interference Substances:
A panel of 23 chemical and seven biological non-microbial contaminants,
representing substances expected to be found in cutaneous or mucocutaneous lesions,
was evaluated for the potential to interfere with the illumigene HSV 1&2 assay.
The potentially interfering substances were tested with one simulated negative sample
(N1) and two unique contrived HSV-1/HSV-2 low positive samples prepared with
HSV-1 (strains HF and MacIntyre) and HSV-2 (strains G and MS).
Simulated negative matrix (N1) was prepared by vortexing traditional-tipped
polyester swabs in Remel MicroTest™ M4 viral transport media.
Contrived HSV-1/HSV-2 combined low positive samples were prepared by
inoculating simulated negative matrix with quantified HSV-1 and HSV-2 stocks to
approximately 1.5X LoD.
Positive sample P1 was prepared using HSV-1 (strain MacIntyre) and HSV-2 (strain
G) at final concentrations of 1.48 x 105 TCID /mL and 1.80 x 103 TCID /mL,
50 50
respectively.
Positive sample P2 was prepared using HSV-1 (strain HF) and HSV-2 (strain MS) at
final concentrations of 1.08 x 104 TCID /mL and 2.40 x 103 TCID /mL,
50 50
respectively.
Potentially interfering substances were then added to negative and positive samples at
final concentrations of 60 μg/mL, 7% v/v, 7% w/v, or greater (final concentrations
are provided in the data summary Table 5).
The prepared samples, Matrix Controls, and Dilution Controls were tested in
triplicate. Replicates producing unexpected results were further evaluated in
15

--- Page 16 ---
replicates of ten for N1, P1 and P2 matrices.
Cold-EEZE® (7% v/v) produced unexpected results (3/3 invalid results) during
original testing of both negative and positive specimens. Repeat testing with 10
replicates for each sample type (N1, P1, P2) produced invalid results for all replicates.
Casein at concentrations greater than 5 mg/mL was found to interfere with the assay,
producing false negative results.

Viral Transport media:
An equivalency study was performed to confirm the suitability of viral transport
medium and specimen collection kits commonly used for cutaneous and
mucocutaneous lesion specimen collection and transport. The viral transport media
and specimen collection kits evaluated in the study were the same as those
summarized in Table 3. One negative sample and one HSV-1/HSV-2 combined low
positive sample were evaluated with each viral transport medium collection kit.
Negative matrix was prepared by vortexing each swab in the corresponding viral
transport medium. Contrived low positive samples were prepared through
inoculation of negative matrix with HSV-1 (strain HF) and HSV-2 (strain MS) to
approximately 1.5X LoD. Each combined HSV-1/HSV-2 low positive sample was
prepared at final concentrations of 1.08 x 104 TCID /mL and 2.40 x 103
50
TCID /mL, respectively. The collection device and viral transport medium in the
50
HealthLink UTM collection kit were considered to be equivalent to Quest V-C-M;
therefore, only HealthLink UTM was evaluated as a representative sample type for
both viral transport media collection kits.
Negative samples were tested in triplicate and positive samples were tested in
replicates of twenty.
All negative and positive replicates were correctly detected. The results confirmed the
equivalence of all viral transport media collection kits evaluated.
Viral transport media containing protein stabilizers, such as Remel MicroTest™
M5® and calcium alginate swabs, were previously identified to impact performance

study and are indicated in the Package Insert as not acceptable for use with the
illumigene HSV 1&2 assay.
k. Carry-over/ Cross Contamination:
Analysis of the illumigene HSV 1&2 assay design, procedure, sample preparation
equipment, Test Devices, and user interface demonstrates that the risk of carry-over is
comparable to the previously cleared illumigene assays.
Carry-over studies previously completed for illumigene Mycoplasma (K123432),
illumigene Pertussis (K133673), and illumigene Group A Streptococcus (K122019)
have demonstrated that illumigene sample preparation equipment and test devices do
not contribute to cross-contamination between samples.

Clinical Performance
The performance of the illumigene HSV 1&2 DNA Amplification Assay with
cutaneous (e.g., skin lesion, genital (penis)) or mucocutaneous (e.g., anorectal, genital
(vaginal/cervical), nasal, ocular, oral lesion and urethral) specimens was determined
from testing of 1,158 eligible specimens collected in seven clinical sites. The
performance of the illumigene HSV 1&2 DNA Amplification Assay was compared
with the ELVIS® HSV ID/Typing Test System (ELVIS), Diagnostic Hybrid, Inc.,
which is a gold standard reference method i.e., cell culture using an enzyme linked
virus inducible system with HSV typing by fluorescently labeled antibodies.
Specimens were excluded in the performance analysis due to ELVIS cell
contamination (n=1), inability to be HSV-typed by the reference ELVIS method
(n=1), or invalid results by the illumigene HSV 1&2 DNA Amplification Assay
without repeat testing (n=1 for HSV-1 and n=1 for HSV-2). Finally, samples which
gave HSV-2 positive results from the ELVIS method were excluded from the HSV-1
performance calculation because of the inability of the ELVIS method to distinguish
18

--- Page 19 ---
an HSV-1 positive sample when HSV-2 was detected first (n=181).
In summary, 974 HSV-1 and 1155 HSV-2 specimen results were included in the
performance analysis of the illumigene HSV 1&2 DNA Amplification Assay versus
the ELVIS reference method.
A total of 723 (74.3%) female and 247 (25.3%) male specimens were tested for HSV-
1 and a total of 873 (75.6%) female and 277 (24.0%) male specimens were tested for
HSV-2. There were four (4) specimens tested for HSV-1 (0.4%) and five (5) tested
for HSV-2 specimens with unknown gender (0.4%). There is no expectation that
assay performance is influenced by gender.
For HSV-1 cutaneous specimens, there were 264 valid results with the ELVIS
method. No invalid results were generated by the illumigene HSV 1&2 DNA
Amplification Assay.
For HSV-1 mucocutaneous specimens, there were 710 valid results with the ELVIS
method with six initially invalid results by the illumigene HSV 1&2 DNA
Amplification Assay. All initially invalid results were resolved by repeat testing as
per the Package Insert and included in the performance calculation.
For HSV-2 cutaneous specimens, there were 306 valid results with the ELVIS
method with one initially invalid result by the illumigene HSV 1&2 DNA
Amplification Assay. The initially invalid result was resolved by repeat testing and
included in the performance calculation.
For HSV-2 mucocutaneous specimens, there were 849 valid results with the ELVIS
method with one originally invalid result by the illumigene HSV 1&2 DNA
Amplification Assay. The initially invalid results was resolved and included in the
performance calculation.
The performance of the illumigene HSV 1&2 DNA Amplification Assay against the
ELVIS reference method is presented in Table 6 below:

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The observed expected values in the clinical study were calculated using all eligible
cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesion specimens submitted for HSV testing that gave
valid illumigene HSV 1&2 assay results. Three HSV-1 and two HSV-2 specimens
producing invalid illumigene results that could not be resolved were excluded from the
1158 total eligible sample population. Therefore, the total number of tested specimens
that were included in the prevalence calculation were N=1155 for HSV-1 and N=1156 for
HSV-2. The overall incidence of HSV infection by the illumigene HSV 1&2 assay during
the clinical study was 20.5% (237/1155) for HSV-1 and 19.4% (224/1156) for HSV-2.
The prevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 with the illumigene HSV 1&2 DNA Amplification
Assay was calculated for the combined sites based on the specific source of specimen and
the age of the patient.
Of the eligible specimens, 306 were from cutaneous lesions. 849 were mucocutaneous
specimens tested for HSV-1 and 850 were mucocutaneous specimens tested for HSV-2.
There were three specimens tested for HSV-1 and two tested for HSV-2 mucocutaneous
from patients with unknown age. The study population included specimens from
pediatric, adult, and geriatric patients, with ages ranging from 1 day to 89 years.
The prevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 by the illumigene HSV 1&2 assay by anatomical
location and patient age is provided in the tables below.
