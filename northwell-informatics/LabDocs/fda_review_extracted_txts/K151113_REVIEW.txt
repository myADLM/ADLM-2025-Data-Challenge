L. Test Principle:
The assay utilizes a dye binding procedure in which calcium forms a blue-purple complex
with Arsenazo under acidic condition. Calcium reacts with Arsenazo in an acidic solution to
form a blue-purple colored complex. The intensity of color produced is directly proportional
to the calcium concentration in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run and total precision studies were performed according to CLSI EP5.
Studies were performed by conducting two runs per day, two measures per run, for 3
levels of serum and urine samples, on 2 Selectra ProM instruments for 20 operating
days. Results are presented in the tables below.
N Sample Within Run Total %CV
Mean %CV
(mg/dL)
Serum 80 8.28 1.1 1.7
(mg/dL) 80 10.32 0.5 1.4

Urine 80 4.53 1.3 1.8
(mg/dL) 80 10.89 0.5 1.2
80 17.51 0.3 0.8
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Serum:
Linearity was evaluated according to CLSI EP6-A by comparing observed versus
expected values for 11 equally-spaced serum samples. Samples were prepared from
high (15.35 mg/dL) and low (4.94 mg/dL) analyte concentration serum pools. Each
sample was evaluated in triplicate on the Selectra ProM instrument.

Urine:
Linearity was evaluated by mixing a high (18.60 mg/dL) and low (1.45 mg/dL) urine
concentrations to obtain 11 levels. Each sample was evaluated in triplicate on the
Selectra ProM instrument.
Linear regression results from these studies are found in the table below:
Slope Intercept R2 Standard Error Concentration
Ranges tested
Serum 1.0173 -0.2048 0.9976 0.19 4.94 to 15.35 mg/dL
Urine 1.0003 -0.1174 0.9983 0.25 1.45 to 18.60 mg/dL
The linearity supports the sponsor’s claimed reportable range of 5.00 – 15.00 mg/dL
for serum and 1.50 – 18.00 mg/dL for urine.
Automatic dilution of 1: 5 by the instrument is available for sample that has
concentration greater than the measuring range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
ELITech Clinical Systems ELICAL 2 calibrator was cleared under k132399.
Traceability for calcium is to NIST SRM 956c materials.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantification (LoQ)
were determined according to CLSI EP17-A with the Selectra ProM. LoB was
determined using a blank sample tested over multi-runs over multi-days. For LoD
and LoQ, testing using serum samples and urine samples was conducted over
multiple days, with one run across two instruments, and with two reagent lots. The
LoB, LoD, and LoQ results are as follows:
Serum Urine
(mg/dL) (mg/dL)
LoB 0.04 0.09
LoD 0.04 0.15
LoQ 5.00 1.50
The sponsor claimed the following measuring ranges: 5.00 – 15.00 mg/dL for serum
and 1.50 – 18.00 mg/dL for urine

e. Analytical specificity:
Interferences due to unconjugated bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, triglycerides,
ascorbic acid, acetylsalicylic acid and acetaminophen were investigated following the
recommended sample levels in CLSI EP07-A2 protocol. Two serum sample pools at
two different calcium concentrations (8.0 and 12.0 mg/dL) and two urine pools at two
different calcium concentrations (4.0 and 16.0 mg/dL) were used for the study.
Sponsor defines non-significant interference as bias of <10% between the spiked and
unspiked samples. The results of the highest concentration tested without significant
interference are summarized in the table below.

Interferent Test range
Unconjugated bilirubin up to 30.0 mg/dL
Conjugated bilirubin up to 29.5 mg/dL

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Serum Method Comparison:
Two sets of method comparison studies, serum and urine, were performed according
to the CLSI EP9-A2 guideline. The serum study was completed with 106 human
serum samples (5 spiked, 5 diluted and 96 unaltered samples) spanning the linear
range of the assay. The urine study was completed with 52 native samples spanning
the linear range of the assay. Each serum and urine sample was analyzed in singlet
using the Selectra ProM analyzer (test method) and in duplicate on the predicate ABX
Pentra Calcium AS CP reagent on an ABX Pentra analyzer. Comparison of individual
test values versus mean predicate values yielded the following results:

Serum 0.949 0.41 0.986 5.07 – 14.79 mg/dL
Urine 0.936 0.20 0.995 1.50 – 17.14 mg/dL
,
b. Matrix comparison
73 paired serum and plasma patient specimens (in lithium heparin samples, ranging
from 5.19 to 14.38 mg/dL), were tested on ELITech Clinical Systems Selectra ProM
Analyzer according to CLSI protocol EP09-A2. 10% of the samples were either
diluted (5) or spiked (2) to achieve the full range for comparison.
