E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The PENTRA XLR is a device modification to the ABX PENTRA 80 (K024002),
which consists in the addition of the measurement of reticulocytes (RET) parameters
to the existing Complete Blood Count (CBC) and Differential (DIFF) counts already
performed by the analyzer.
The additional RET mode, based on the use of thiazol orange reagent and
fluorescence detection by optical bench, is independent from the modes already
existing on the ABX PENTRA 80: the CBC and the CBC+DIFF modes. There have
been no modifications to the existing mechanical and analytical portions of the
original device.
The existing fundamental scientific technology for the analyzer has not changed.
Hematological parameters for complete blood count and differential leucocyte count,
1

--- Page 2 ---
the reagents and controls, measuring principles, and the principles of operation are
the same as previously cleared by the FDA.
The parameters already available on the ABX PENTRA 80 are unchanged:
- CBC parameters: WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, PLT,
MPV
- DIFF parameters: LYM#, LYM%, MON#, MON%, NEU#, NEU%, EOS#,
EOS%, BAS#, BAS%
The additional reticulocytes parameters are the following:
RET#: reticulocyte absolute value
RET%: reticulocyte percentage
CRC: corrected reticulocyte count
IRF: immature reticulocyte fraction
RBC parameter is also reported in the RET mode.
Software changes reflect routine updates to the cycle operation, increased user
interface options, and the support of the reticulocyte counting.
2. Principles of Operation:
The PENTRA XLR performs hematology analyses using the following methods:
· RBC / PLT: Impedance
· WBC: Impedance
· HGB: Spectrophotometry
· DIFF: Impedance with DHSS (Double Hydrodynamic Sequential System) for
Cytometry and Cytochemistry
· MCV: Calculated
· RET: Fluorescence and Impedance
The principles of operation for the parameters already existing on the ABX PENTRA 80
are unchanged and are, therefore, not explained again. The principle of operation for the
reticulocyte parameters is described below.
The instrument samples 35 μL of blood and injects 10 μL of it into the DIL1 chamber. It
then mixes the sample with 1.7 mL of ABX Diluent. Then the instrument samples 28 μL
of diluted blood and mixes it with 2.5 mL of ABX Fluocyte. This reagent contains a
fluorescent stain which is specific to nucleic acids: thiazol orange.
The solution is warmed at 35°C for 50 seconds. The stain molecules enter through the
cell membrane and fix the ribonucleic acid molecules. This binding gives an increase of
the fluorescence (enhancement: ~3000x). After 50 seconds, the solution is transferred to
the laser optical bench to be measured.
2

--- Page 3 ---
The laser optical bench simultaneously measures the fluorescence of the cells passing
through the measuring point into the flowcell and the volume by impedance. A cell
passing through the flowcell gives two types of information:
· the size of the cell measured by resistivity (Cell Impedance Signal (CIS));
· the fluorescence signal (Orthogonal Fluorescence Light (OFL)).
The fluorescence is collected using:
· a lens focused on the optical flowcell and located at 90° from the laser beam;
· an interferential filter specific to the thiazol orange stain selecting only the fluorescent
wavelength;
· an avalanche photodiode.
The reticulocytes matrix is generated from two measurements: CIS and OFL of cells
according to the X and Y axes respectively. Mature red blood cells without RNA show
little or no fluorescent signal. They are located at the bottom of the matrix and
horizontally distributed according to their MCV and RDW. Reticulocytes are separated
from the red blood cells by their fluorescence which is proportional to the RNA content
and their immaturity. The most fluorescent elements, which are saturated at the top of
the matrix, are the most immature. Erythroblasts may also be found in this area.
3. Modes of Operation:
The PENTRA XLR instrument can operate in:
- CBC mode (Complete Blood Count)
- DIFF mode (CBC + WBC Differential)
- RET mode (Reticulocytes + RBC)
Sampling modes:
The PENTRA XLR operates in:
· Automatic sampling (auto mixer and auto loader) for CBC and DIFF modes only or
· Manual sampling (STAT mode) for CBC, DIFF and RET modes.
Therefore, for the RET mode, only the manual sampling (STAT mode) is available.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
PENTRA XLR has both open tube sampling and closed tube sampling with cap-piercing
mechanism. For the open tube sampling the cap is removed before placing tube into the
tube holder and closing the door of the analyzer. Under the closed tube sampling, the
blood collection tube is placed directly in the analyzer without removing the cap. The
User Manual provides a list of tubes that can be used with PENTRA XLR. Both
K EDTAand K EDTA anticoagulants are acceptable.

a. Method Comparison
A total of 376 venous whole blood specimens (collected in K EDTA) were analyzed at
2
three test sites in the US. Different instruments and operators were used at each site.
Each of the samples was analyzed in duplicate on the PENTRA XLR and on the
predicate ABX PENTRA DX 120. Each replicate from the PENTRA XLR was
compared to the mean value of duplicates from the ABX PENTRA DX 120. The study
population included subjects ≥ 18 years of age.
Individual site and combined results for RBC, RET%, RET#, IRF and CRC passed the
acceptance criteria at all the pre-determined medical decisions points when sample
results analyzed by the PENTRA XLR were compared to the same sample analyzed by
the predicate device. These findings support the claim that the PENTRA XLR candidate
device and the ABX PENTRA DX 120 predicate device are substantially equivalent.

Reproducibility
Reproducibility was assessed on four PENTRA XLR instruments at four different sites,
one operator per site. At each site; high, normal, and low levels of a single lot of control
material (Minotrol Retic for the Reticulocyte parameters, Difftrol for the RBC parameter)
were run in duplicate, twice each day, during a minimum of 25 days.
Standard deviation and CV% were calculated for each measurand and the results obtained
were within specifications. RBC results are consistent with ABX PENTRA 80 claim.

c. Linearity:
Commercial linearity kits were used to perform the linearity studies. The expected values
of the kit samples were considered the “true values”. Each level was run in replicates of
four (n=4) as recommended by the kit supplier. For each level, the four replicate results
were plotted versus the theoretical value. The findings of the polynomial regression
analysis indicate that the PENTRA XLR exhibits linearity across the claimed range.
The Analytical Measuring Range (AMR) is defined as the range comprised between the
Analytical Limit or Limit of Quantitation and the High Linearity Limit determined for
each parameter. The claimed AMR are provided below:

RBC results are consistent with ABX PENTRA 80 claim.
d. Carryover:
The potential for sample carryover was tested in duplicate on the PENTRA XLR
instrument using alternating high and low concentrations samples according to the process
below: low4 - low6
- Process a sample in RET mode with “low values” three times (low 1, low 2, low 3)
- Then process a sample with a “high values” three times (high 1, high 2, high 3)
Ct % = ´100
- Finally process again the sample with “low values” three times (low 4, low 5, low 6)
The percentage of carryover is calculated using the formula behlow: igh3 - low6
All carry-over results are within specifications for the PENTRA XLR. RBC results are
consistent with ABX PENTRA 80 claim.
Carry-over Limit (%CV)
RBC (106/mm3) <2%
RET% <1%
RET# (106/mm3) <1%
e. Interfering Substances:
The interference effect is evaluated following two methodologies.
By addition - evaluating the effect of potentially interfering substances added to the
sample of interest:
A potential interfering substance is added to a sample and the bias relative to a control
portion of the sample is evaluated ("paired-difference testing"). This bias was compared
to the acceptance criteria.
For all tests performed with the following potential interferents: urea, bilirubin,
lipemia, and hemolysis, the bias remained below the acceptable limit, therefore, no
significant interference was observed.
By comparison - evaluating the bias of individual specimen:
Representative patient specimens (with known or potential reticulocyte interferents, as
given in CLSI H44-A2 guidance document) and control samples (without interferent) are
run in duplicate in comparison to a comparative measurement procedure (ABX PENTRA
DX 120). Then the bias versus comparative measurement values was plotted for each

specimen group. Both measurement procedures had 10 to 20 samples in each group to
demonstrate sufficient precision. A comparable effect was observed on the PENTRA
XLR and the reference device for the interferences from: abnormal RBC, basophilic
stippling, cold agglutinins, giant platelets, hemolysis, Howell-Jolly bodies, leukocyte
fragments, nucleated erythrocytes, Pappenheimer bodies, paraproteins, platelet clumps,
platelet/erythrocyte coincidence.
Additionally, Heinz Bodies, parasites and autofluorescence are potential interferents on
WBC and Monocytes counts that could not be tested, but that are well described in
literature.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Specimen Stability Studies
Ten whole venous blood specimens (collected in K EDTA) were analyzed on the
2
PENTRA XLR at one site in US. Following the collection (T0), each specimen was
divided in half, with one half of the sample stored at ambient temperature (24oC) and
the other stored under refrigerated conditions (4oC). Testing for stability was
performed at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48 and 72 hours after T0 When sufficient volume is
.
available, each time point is tested in duplicate. The acceptance criteria for sample
stability is given as an acceptable maximum bias of the value at T with the value at T0.
All data passed specifications. RBC results are consistent with ABX PENTRA 80 claim.

b. Comparability between CBC and RET modes for RBC
A total of 107 normal and pathological blood specimens were analyzed on two PENTRA
XLR instruments at one site in France. The specimens used in this study were venous
blood specimens collected in K EDTA. Each subject specimen was analyzed in duplicate
2
on both instruments in RET mode and CBC mode. Each replicate from the RET mode
was compared to the mean value of the replicates from the CBC mode.
Bias was estimated at three points for RBC parameter: the low end of the distribution of
observations, the mid-point, and the high end of the distribution. Bias was estimated
separately for each replicate. Acceptance criteria were met at all levels. These findings
support the claim that CBC and RET modes give comparable RBC results as measured
on the PENTRA XLR hematology analyzer.

c. Anticoagulant Comparison Study - K₂EDTA vs. K₃EDTA whole blood:
A total of 90 normal and pathological blood specimens were analyzed on the PENTRA
XLR at two sites in the US. Different instruments and operators were used at each
site. The specimens used in this study were venous blood specimens that were
prospectively collected for this study specifically. Each subject provided blood collected
in both K EDTA and K EDTA. Each of the samples was analyzed in duplicate on the
2 3
PENTRA XLR.
Bias was estimated at three points for each reticulocyte parameter: the low end of the
distribution of observations, the mid-point, and the high end of the distribution. Bias
was estimated separately for each replicate. Acceptance criteria were met for all
measurands at all levels. These findings support the claim that K EDTA and K EDTA
2 3
specimens give comparable results as measured on the PENTRA XLR hematology
analyzer.
d. Determination of limit of blank, lower limits of detection and quantitation:
Analytical Limits at Low Level
Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) studies cannot be performed for
reticulocyte parameters, because it is not possible to have result when there is no or not
enough RBC in the sample. A verification of the LoB and LoD has been done for the
RBC parameter.
Analytical sensitivity has been determined for the Reticulocyte parameters according to
CLSI H44-A2 guideline. A verification of the LoQ according to CLSI EP17-A2
guideline has been done for the RBC parameter.
Limit of Blank (LoB)
Plasma samples, obtained by centrifugation of normal samples, were used as blank

samples, in order to be as close as possible as the blood sample matrix. To estimate the
LoB, a total of 60 repeated measurements of different plasma are run in the same series
(six different samples run 10 times). This test is performed on two PENTRA XLR
instruments with two reagents lots. RBC results on PENTRA XLR met specifications
and are consistent with ABX PENTRA 80 claim.
LoB obtained from 60 repeated measurements of six different plasma samples, are:
Measurand LoB
RBC 0 x 106/mm3
Limit of Detection (LoD)
A set of six samples with very low parameter concentration are run 10 times over several
days. To estimate the LoD, 60 results and calculate the pooled standard deviation (SDs).
This test was performed on two PENTRA XLR instruments with two reagents lots. RBC
results on PENTRA XLR met specifications and are consistent with ABX PENTRA 80
claim.
LoD obtained from 10 runs of 6 low samples on each instrument are:
Measurand LoD
RBC 0.01 x 106/mm3
Analytical sensitivity - Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
For Reticulocyte parameters:
To estimate the analytical sensitivity for reticulocyte parameters, a range of samples in
low concentrations is prepared. Seven levels are prepared and run four times each.
Testing was performed on three PENTRA XLR instruments using four reagents lots.
The analytical sensitivity data are considered acceptable when the distribution of the
residuals is randomly distributed and r² higher than 0.98. The lowest value obtained in
agreement with the acceptance criteria is the sensitivity limit and will be used as low
limit for measuring range.
Analytical sensitivity limits obtained are:
Measurand Analytical sensitivity
RET% 0.7%
RET# 0.01 x 106/mm3
For RBC parameter:
To estimate the limit of quantitation, several ranges of linearity in low concentrations
were prepared. Between three to six samples per level were prepared and run at least five

times each, 40 replicates per level. The LoQ data are considered acceptable when the
%Total-error is smaller than the desired total error for each measurand. This test is
performed on two PENTRA XLR instruments with two reagents lots. RBC results on
PENTRA XLR met specifications and are consistent with ABX PENTRA 80 claim.
LoQ obtained from at least 40 runs of 4 samples by level are:

RBC 0.24 x 106/mm3
e. Reference Intervals:
A total of 242 (122 female and 120 male) normal adult samples (whole blood samples
collected in K EDTA) were analyzed in duplicate on the PENTRA XLR at two test sites
2
in the US. The nonparametric data analysis method was used, depending only on the
ranks of the reference data arranged in order of increasing size. Per EP28-A3, the
reference interval is determined to be between and including the lower and upper
reference limits, which enclose 95% of the values from the reference population
subjects. Confidence intervals for the reference limit were calculated using a 90%
probability (90% CI).
For each gender, a reference interval has been defined as described in the following table.
FEMALES MALES
PENTRA XLR (N=122) (N=120)
Reference Interval

RET% 0.70 2.35 0.70 2.06
RET# (106/mm3) 0.022 0.106 0.024 0.106
CRC 0.44 2.27 0.51 2.15
IRF 0.018 0.191 0.033 0.232
These intervals are given in the labeling of the PENTRA XLR. However, expected
values will vary with sample population and/or geographical location. Horiba highly
recommends that each laboratory establish its own normal ranges based upon its local
population.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
L. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
