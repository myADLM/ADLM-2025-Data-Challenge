1. Intended use(s):
Assay:
The Cepheid Xpert® Flu+RSV Xpress Assay, performed on the GeneXpert® Xpress System,
is an automated, multiplex real-time, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-
PCR) assay intended for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A,
influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) viral RNA. The Xpert Flu+RSV Xpress
Assay uses nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from patients with signs and symptoms
of respiratory infection. The Xpert Flu+RSV Xpress Assay is intended as an aid in the
diagnosis of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus in conjunction with clinical and
epidemiological risk factors.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus infection and
should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2014-2015 influenza
season. When other novel influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics
may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture should
not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and culture
specimens.

2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
This is a prescription only test.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The assay is performed using the GeneXpert® Xpress System.
I. Device Description:
This assay uses nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of
respiratory infection. Viral nucleic acid is extracted from the sample and the influenza
and/or RSV RNA is amplified and detected through real-time reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Detection and differentiation of influenza A, influenza
B, and RSV is reported to the user.
The assay uses single use disposable cartridge that has a separate section for specimen
loading. The cartridge also contains all PCR reagents and is where the PCR reaction takes
place. The GeneXpert Xpress System performs all assay steps from clinical sample to
reporting assay results automatically. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe
Check Control (PCC) are also included in the cartridge. The SPC is present to control for
adequate processing of the target viruses and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the PCR
reaction. The Probe Check Control (PCC) verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in
the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability.
The GeneXpert Xpress System, comprised of the GeneXpert Dx System GX-I, has one
module that is capable of performing separate sample preparation and real-time PCR and RT-
PCR tests. This single module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids (i.e., the syringe
drive activates the plunger that works in concert with the rotary valve in the cartridge to
move fluids between chambers), an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells, and a proprietary I-
CORE® thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and RT-PCR and detection.
Turnaround time for analysis of a sample is approximately 60 minutes. The assay results are
automatically generated at the end of the process and provided in a report that can be viewed
and printed.

L. Test Principle:
The assay detects viral nucleic acids that have been extracted from a patient respiratory
sample. A multiplex Real-time RT-PCR reaction is carried out under optimized conditions
generating amplicons for influenza A, influenza B, RSV, and the Sample Process Control
(SPC). Identification of influenza A, influenza B, RSV, and the SPC occurs by the use of
target-specific primers and fluorescent-labeled probes that hybridize to conserved regions in
the genomes.

Analytical Studies: provided in support of K142045 and the current submission
The following study data were originally submitted for the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay in
K142045 and also included in the current submission. The majority of samples in these studies
were tested by the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay and a smaller proportion of samples were tested by
the Xpert Flu+RSV Xpress Assay. All reagents, buffers, and other components that comprise
both assays are exactly the same. The detection method, the signal analysis, and the software
algorithm used to calculate the results are also identical.
c. Baseline, Threshold and Cut-off:
The lot specific parameters (LSP) and assay settings (background subtraction, background
minimum cycle, background maximum cycle, manual threshold, curve analysis, and valid
minimum and maximum Ct values) for the Xpert Flu+RSV XC Assay were determined
using pre-clinical and analytical data with the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay cleared in K142045.
The technology was not significantly changed from the XC Assay to the Xpress Assay; the
assay reagents and assay analysis algorithm have not changed. The LSP and assay settings
were confirmed for the Xpert Flu +RSV Xpress Assay.
d. Stability:
The Flu/RSV XC Assay was used to determine the stability of reagents in the Xpert
Flu+RSV Xpress Assay because all reagents, buffers, and other components that comprise
both assays are exactly the same. The detection method, the signal analysis, and algorithm
used by the different software to calculate the results are the same.
Kit Stability:
The real-time reagent stability data for the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay is currently available
for nine months at the claimed storage temperatures of 2°C and 28°C. Results to date show
that averaged Ct values are within each assay lot acceptance criteria and testing is ongoing
for up to 37 months on three lots.
Specimen Stability:
The study data supports specimen stability at extreme storage temperatures and storage times
(7 days at 2°C followed by 24 hours at 30°C followed by testing on day 9) for all three
claimed transport media (Becton Dickinson UVTM, Remel M5, and Copan UTM).
e. Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
An internal assay control called the ‘sample processing control’ (SPC) monitors adequate
sample processing and the integrity of the RT-PCR. The SPC is mixed with the sample
automatically inside the test cartridge to control for adequate lysis of the target viruses,
sample processing, and detection of assay interference.
No external controls are provided with this assay. The recommended external controls are:
· ZeptoMetrix inactivated virus controls: (catalog # NATFLUAB-6C and catalog #
NATRSV-6C) are external positive controls required for the Xpert Flu/RSV XC
Assay.
11

--- Page 12 ---
· ZeptoMetrix (catalog # NATCXVA9-6C) is an inactivated Coxsackie virus external
negative control required for the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay.
f. Analytical Inclusivity:
The analytical reactivity of the Xpert Flu+RSV Xpress Assay was evaluated against multiple
strains of influenza A H1N1 (seasonal pre-2009), influenza A H1N1 (pandemic 2009),
influenza A H3N2 (seasonal), avian influenza A (H5N2, H6N2, H7N3, and H7N9, and
H9N2), influenza B (representing strains from both Victoria and Yamagata lineages), and
respiratory syncytial virus subgroups A and B (RSV A and RSV B) at levels near the
analytical LoD. All virus identities and titers were confirmed prior to analysis. Sixty-four
(64) strains comprised of 54 influenza viruses and 10 RSV strains were tested in this study
with the Xpert Flu+RSV Xpress Assay. Virus dilution and sample preparation was
performed with simulated background matrix consisted of 2.5% (w/v) porcine mucin, 1%
(v/v) human whole blood in 0.85% sodium chloride (NaCl) formulated in 1X PBS solution
with 15% glycerol, which was then diluted in UTM to a final concentration of 16.7%. An
aliquot of 300 μL of the final inocula was added to the Xpert Flu+RSV Xpress Assay
cartridge and 3 replicates were tested for each strain. Due to the biosafety restrictions on
viable viral particles, purified nucleic acids at ≤ 1ρg/mL in simulated background matrix
were tested for 9 avian influenza A strains. Three replicates of a no template control were
also tested which contained the simulated background matrix only. One replicate each of
three external controls (one positive control for Flu A/B, one positive control for RSV, and
one negative control) was tested with the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay on each day of the study.

“Flu A POSITIVE; FLU B NEGATIVE; RSV NEGATIVE” with a Flu A Ct value of 39.4 (cut-
off = 40). A Ct value of 39.4 is not typical of positive Cts for Flu A and the false positive result
was likely caused by contamination. An additional twenty-three (23) replicates of Acinetobacter
baumannii were tested; all 23 replicates were correctly reported as “Flu A NEGATIVE; Flu B
NEGATIVE; RSV NEGATIVE”. Based on the results of this study, the Xpert Flu+RSV Xpress
Assay showed no cross-reactivity with any of the organisms tested.
Microbial Interference:
The analytical specificity of the Xpert Flu+RSV Xpress Assay was evaluated by testing a
panel of forty-four (44) microorganisms consisting of 16 viral, 26 bacterial, and 2 yeast
strains representing common respiratory pathogens or those potentially encountered in the
nasopharynx. One replicate each of three external controls (one positive control for Flu A/B,
one positive control for RSV, and one negative control) was tested with the Xpert Flu/RSV
XC Assay on each day of the study.
All bacterial strains were tested in triplicate at concentrations of ≥106 CFU/mL with the
exception of one strain which was tested at 105 CFU/mL (Chlamydia pneumoniae). All viral
strains were tested in triplicate at concentrations of ≥105 TCID /mL. Three replicates of a
50
no template control (background matrix diluted in background matrix) were also tested.
All the strains were diluted into a simulated background matrix. The simulated background
matrix consisted of 2.5% (w/v) porcine mucin, 1% (v/v) human whole blood in 0.85%
sodium chloride (NaCl) formulated in 1X PBS solution with 15% glycerol, which was then
diluted in UTM to a final concentration of 16.7%. Negative specimens consisted of the
diluted simulated background matrix only. Dilutions were prepared daily and kept on ice
prior to testing.
Results are summarized below. The results demonstrate that the Xpert Flu+RSV Xpress
Assay does not cross-react with any of the 44 common respiratory microorganisms tested in
this study.

a1 out of the 3 original replicates tested as “Flu A Positive”. The Ct score associated with the false positive was 39.4;
near the cut-off of 40.0 for a positive call. An additional 23 replicates were tested and all 23 were negative for all
three analyte channels.
Competitive Interference:
The purpose of this study is to determine whether competitive interference exists between
analytes when more than one analyte is present in a clinical sample. Competitive
interference caused by clinically relevant co-infections of the targets in the Xpert Flu+RSV
Xpress Assay was evaluated by testing individual influenza and RSV strains at LoD and
spiking in different influenza or RSV strains at a higher concentration in a simulated
background matrix. The concentration of each strain at LoD ranged from 0.57 TCID50/mL
to 2.0 TCID50/mL and the concentration of the competitive strains ranged from 103
TCID50/mL to 104 TCID50/mL. Analytical competitive interference was assessed using one
(1) seasonal Flu A H3 strain (H3/Victoria/361/2011), one (1) Flu B strain (Flu
B/Mass/2/2012), one (1) RSV A strain (RSV-A/2/Australia/61), and one (1) RSV B strain
(RSV-B/Wash/18537/62).

Replicates of 20 were tested for each target strain and each competitive strain combination.
The normal binomial distribution with 20 replicate samples at LoD is between 17 and 20
positive results based on the binomial distribution with N=20, p=.95 (X~Bin(20,0.95)).
Therefore, sets of 20 with 16 or less positives would be rare and an indication of a
competitive inhibitory effect due to high levels of a competing analyte. One replicate each of
three external controls (one Flu A/B positive, one RSV positive and one negative) was tested
with the Xpert Flu+RSV Xpress Assay on each day of this study.
Under the conditions of the study using the normal binomial distribution with 20 replicate
samples at LoD of between 17 and 20 positive results, no competitive inhibitory effects were
observed at the analytical LoD for each of the strains tested in the presence of another
analyte. The results for each analyte at LoD in combination with another competitive analyte
are shown in the following four tables.
Note: The average Ct values for each strain tested at LoD without a competitive analyte are
taken from the Limit of Detection study.

h. Interfering Substances:
In a non-clinical study, potentially interfering substances that may be present in the
nasopharynx were evaluated relative to the performance of the Xpert Flu+RSV Xpress
Assay. Negative samples (n = 8) were tested per each substance to determine the effect
on the performance of the sample processing control (SPC). Positive samples (n = 8)
were tested per substance spiked at 2x the analytical LoD determined for each of the
following six influenza viruses, two 2009 H1N1 strains (A/California/7/2009 and
A/Florida/27/2011), two Flu A H3N2 strains (H3/Perth/16/09 and H3/Victoria/361/2011,
and two Flu B stains (Flu B/Wisconsin/01/11 and Flu B/Mass/02/2012), and four RSV
viruses, two RSV A strains (RSV-A/Long/MD/56 and RSV-A/2/Australia/61) and two
RSV B strains (RSV-B/Wash/18537/62 and RSV-B/9320/MA/77). All results were
compared to positive and negative Universal Transport Medium (UTM) controls. The
evaluated substances are below with active ingredients and concentrations tested
shown. There was no assay interference in the presence of the substances at the
concentrations tested in this study. All positive and negative replicates were correctly
identified using the Xpert Flu+RSV Xpress Assay.
FluMist vaccine samples were correctly reported as FLU A POSITIVE; FLU B
POSITIVE; RSV NEGATIVE as expected. Samples containing FluMist may cause false
positive results.

strain. Negative samples of this substance cannot be tested to observe its impact on SPC Ct. The FluMist vaccine
samples tested with the Xpert Flu+RSV Xpress Assay were correctly reported as “Flu A POSITIVE; Flu B
POSITIVE; RSV NEGATIVE” as expected. Samples containing FluMist may cause false positives. This is
addressed in the Limitations Section of the Package Insert.
i. Carry-Over/Cross-Contamination:
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate whether single use, self-contained GeneXpert
cartridges prevent specimen and amplicon carry-over contamination into negative samples when
these are run following very high positive samples in the same GeneXpert module. GeneXpert
cartridges are designed such that patient specimens and all assay reagents are confined within the
self-contained GeneXpert cartridge and do not come into contact with the instrument and/or its
moving parts.
This study consisted of a negative sample (16.7% simulated background matrix only) processed
in the same module of the GeneXpert Xpress System (GX-I) immediately following a high
positive sample comprised of a Flu A strain (A/Canada/6294/2009, 1x106 TCID50/mL) or a RSV
A virus (A/2/Australia/61, 1x104 TCID50/mL) spiked into a 16.7% simulated background matrix.
This process was repeated 20 times in a single GeneXpert module for a total of 41 runs resulting
in 20 positives and 21 negatives. The simulated background matrix consisted of 2.5% (w/v)
porcine mucin, 1% (v/v) human whole blood in 0.85% sodium chloride (NaCl) formulated in 1X
PBS solution with 15% glycerol, which was then diluted in UTM to a final concentration of
16.7%.
All of the 42 negative replicates were correctly reported as “Flu A NEGATIVE; Flu B
NEGATIVE; RSV NEGATIVE”. All the negative sample Cts were zero.
All 20 high Flu A positive replicates were correctly reported as “Flu A POSITIVE; Flu B
NEGATIVE; RSV NEGATIVE”. All 20 high RSV positive replicates were correctly reported as
“Flu A NEGATIVE; Flu B NEGATIVE; RSV POSITIVE”.
Of the total 121 runs, two runs provided indeterminate GeneXpert results (2 ERROR). Both runs
were repeated such that 21 negative and 20 positive replicates were tested for each virus strain.
Under the conditions of this study, no evidence of specimen or amplicon carry-over
contamination was observed in the GeneXpert Dx GX-IV module.

--- Page 24 ---
Fresh vs. Frozen study data was originally submitted for the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay in
K142045. The Flu/RSV XC Assay was used to determine the stability of the Xpert Flu+RSV
Xpress Assay because all reagents, buffers and other components that comprise both assays
are exactly the same. The detection method, the signal analysis, and algorithm used by the
different software to calculate the results are the same.
3. Clinical studies:
A total of 12 sites, 10 CLIA waived and 2 High Complexity CLIA laboratories participated
in the study. Five sites were emergency departments, five sites were walk-in clinics or
student health centers, and two sites were hospital laboratories. The study was conducted
from September 2014 to March 2015.
One nasopharyngeal swab was collected from each subject and placed into UTM after
collection. This sample was used for immediate testing with Xpert Flu+ RSV Xpress Assay
and the Comparator NAAT. Due to the low prevalence of Flu B and RSV during the
sampling time frame of this study, supplementation with pre-selected archived NP swab
specimens known to be positive for Flu B or RSV was required to meet the sample size for
these targets. A total of 2435 NP swab specimens were tested for influenza A, influenza B,
and RSV by the Xpert Flu+RSV Xpress Assay and the comparator assay. Of the 2435 NP
swab specimens 2176 were fresh, prospectively collected and 259 were pre-selected frozen,
archived specimens.
Of the Xpert Flu+RSV Xpress Assay runs performed with eligible specimens, 95.0%
(2335/2459) of these specimens were successful on the first attempt. The initial invalid rate
was 5.0% (95% CI 4.2-6.0%). Invalid results were returned on the first attempt for 124
specimens (121 NO RESULT-REPEAT TEST and 3 INSTRUMENT ERROR). One-
hundred eighteen of the 124 specimens were retested, of which 107 yielded valid results after
a single retest. There were 17 NP swab specimens with invalid results upon retest which
were excluded from the analyses.
The tables below show the performance of the Xpert Flu+RSV Xpress Assay, the data are
stratified by analyte, Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV and by sample collection,
prospective or retrospective.

O. System Descriptions:
The GeneXpert Xpress System automates and integrates sample purification, nucleic acid
amplification, and detection of the target sequences in simple or complex samples using real-
time PCR and RT-PCR. The system consists of a GeneXpert GX-I instrument (also referred to
as GeneXpert I), touchscreen computer, and preloaded software for running the tests and
viewing the results. The GeneXpert Xpress System requires the use of single-use disposable
assay-specific cartridges (the Xpert Flu+RSV Xpress Assay cartridge) that hold the PCR
reagents and host the PCR process. In this platform, sample preparation, amplification, and real-
time detection are fully-automated and completely integrated.
The GeneXpert Xpress System platform is the same platform as the GeneXpert Dx System
(model GX-I) that is used with Cepheid’s previously cleared Xpert assays (including K142025).
The detection method, the signal analysis, and algorithm used by the systems to calculate the
results are the same. The differences between the systems lie in the user interface of the system
and the reporting of results: 1) the Xpress system has an ATM-like user interface and is
simplified to utilize pictures and videos to guide the user through ordering and running a test,
and 2) the test results for INVALID and ERROR results are simplified.
1. Modes of Operation:
The Xpert Flu+RSV Xpress Assay can be used with GeneXpert Xpress software version 4.4.2
and GeneXpert Dx software version 4.4. Directions for operating the system are included in the
package insert.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line
of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
Level of Concern:
Moderate
Software Description:
The GeneXpert Xpress software utilizes the same GeneXpert module control (optics,
thermal, fluidics, etc.), data collection and data analysis as the GeneXpert Dx software
using the GeneXpert GX-I instrument (identical instrument as the GeneXpert Dx GX-I
instrument). Two major differences are: 1) Xpress software user interface is simplified to
utilize pictures and videos to guide the user through ordering and running a test, and 2) the
test result interpretations for INVALID and ERROR results are simplified. The following
table outlines the similarities and differences:

6. Quality Control:
· Sample Processing Control (SPC): Ensures the sample was processed correctly.
The SPC is an Armored RNA® that is included in each cartridge to verify
adequate processing of the sample. The SPC verifies that release of RNA from
the Flu or RSV virus has occurred if the organism is present and verifies that the
specimen processing is adequate. Additionally, this control detects specimen-
associated inhibition of the RT-PCR and PCR reactions. The SPC should be
positive in a negative sample and can be negative or positive in a positive sample.
The SPC passes if it meets the validated acceptance criteria.
