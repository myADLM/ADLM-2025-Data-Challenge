Disease”.
The Wells’ score was used to estimate a high, intermediate or low pre-test probability
(PTP) of PE for all subjects. Patients with a high PTP score were excluded from the
study. Patient samples were tested with the INNOVANCE® D-Dimer assay and
results were compared to a cut-off value of 0.50 mg/L FEU. A D-dimer result ≥0.50
mg/L FEU was considered positive. A D-dimer result <0.50 mg/L FEU was
considered negative. Patients with a positive D-dimer result were evaluated by
imaging methods, e.g. spiral computer tomography (CT) and/or ventilation/perfusion
(VQ) scan. Patients with a negative D-dimer result underwent imaging at the
physician’s discretion. All patients with a negative diagnosis of PE were followed for
three months to evaluate potential development of PE. Patients with un-obtainable
follow-up data were excluded from analysis, yielding a total of 1467 patients for final
analysis. The overall prevalence of PE in those patients available for final analysis
was 6.9% (101/1467) with 6.0% in the U.S. population and 37.2% in the German
outside U.S. (OUS) population. The instrument-specific sensitivity, specificity,
negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) with lower
bound (LCL) of two-sided 95% confidence interval were obtained with the
INNOVANCE® D-Dimer clinical cut-off of 0.50 mg/L FEU.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
A 20-day precision study was performed at three clinical sites, one in US and two in
Germany. Control materials and plasma samples were used to evaluate the device
performance. The study followed the scheme of two runs per day, with two replicates
per run at each of the three sites following CLSI EP05-A2. Within-run, between-run,
between-day, and total precision within site were calculated.

Fibrinogen, Antithrombin, and D-dimer quantitation assays.
ii. Sample Carryover
Sample carryover studies were conducted in-house to evaluate whether a sample
could cause contamination by being carried over into the next test. The analyzer’s
aspiration and washing of the sample probe between pipetting steps would eliminate
the possibility of contamination. Results met predetermined acceptance criteria for
PT, APTT, Fibrinogen, Antithrombin, and D-dimer quantitation assays.
e. Interfering Substances:
i. Interference testing (hemolysis, icterus, and lipemia) to determine the level of
optical interference was tested conducted for each assay.

each of the 10 dilutions. All results above the analytical measuring range at a
concentration greater than 4.81 mg/L FEU are automatically re-diluted by the
Sysmex CS-2100i coagulation analyzer.
The intrinsic high dose hook (HDH) algorithm detected correctly potential antigen
excess; therefore, results were flagged by the instrument at concentrations at and
above 19.23 mg/L FEU. The instrument automatically re-diluted the samples to
obtain results within the clinically reportable range.
The results of the study confirmed a result of 615.25 mg/L FEU, which met the pre-
established acceptance criterion that there is no high dose hook effect up to 500
mg/L FEU.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i. Traceability: All assay reagents are 510(k) cleared and traceability is specific to
reagent performance.
ii. Reagent stability: All assay reagents are 510(k) cleared and reagent stability studies
are specific to reagent performance.
iii. Sample stability: All assay reagents are 510(k) cleared and sample stability studies
are specific to reagent performance.
iv. On-Board Stability Testing - Reagents: To assess reagent stability during use on the
analyzer, an on-board stability study was conducted to establish the maximum on-
board stability claims stated in the labeling. A reference value was measured at the
beginning of the study (day 0) by measuring 10 replicates of the individual sample
aliquot. The mean value was determined and was then used as the reference value.
Results were analyzed by linear regression analysis. The shortest on-board stability
time determined for all samples used with all test batches was then considered the
maximum on-board stability time.
v. On-System Stability Testing - Control Material: To assess the on-board stability of
commercial control material during use on the Sysmex CS-2100i coagulation
analyzer, a stability study was conducted to establish the maximum on-board
stability storage claims as stated in the labeling. A reference value was measured at
the beginning of the study (day 0) by measuring 10 replicates of the individual
sample aliquot. The mean value was determined and was then used as the reference
value. Three lots of controls were evaluated with at least four replicates of each
control. The shortest on-board stability time determined for all samples used with all
test batches was then considered the maximum on-board stability time.
vi. Ambient Temperature Testing - The effects of the defined instrument ambient
temperature interval as stated in the instruction for use (IFU) of the Sysmex CS-
2100i coagulation analyzer was evaluated. The IFU states the operating
environment’s ambient temperature interval is 15 to 30ºC. Pooled plasma samples
and controls were tested using one reagent lot at three temperature ranges (15, 22,
and 30°C) in a temperature controlled environmental chamber. All results met the
15

d. Assay cut-off:
The D-dimer assay has a pre-determined cut-off at 0.5 mg/L FEU as stated in the
reagent package insert.
e. Lupus sensitivity for APTT
An in-house study of lupus sensitivity was conducted for APTT assay to assess
instrument performance. Two lots of APTT reagent and 21 well-defined lupus
samples were used in the study. All lupus samples yielded APTT results that
exceeded the upper limit of the reference interval for both APTT reagent lots.
f. Heparin Sensitivity for APTT
Heparin sensitivity study was conducted for APTT assay to assess instrument
performance. Samples from patients receiving unfractionated heparin (UFH) therapy
were measured with both the Sysmex® CA-1500 and Sysmex CS-2100i coagulation
analyzers using two APTT reagent lots. Passing-Bablock analysis for two lots using
yielded the following correlation.
• Lot 1: n = 118, y = 1.067x – 2.003, r = 0.993
• Lot 2: n = 107, y = 1.006x – 1.629, r = 0.996
In a study comparing APTT using Actin FSL on Sysmex CS-2100i System with Anti
Xa testing using Berichrom® Heparin on Sysmex® CA-1500 System, a correlation
coefficient r = 0.718 was obtained. Classifying the samples using the Anti Xa
therapeutic range (0.3 – 0.7 IU/mL) and the calculated APTT therapeutic range
demonstrated a 31.4% discordance level (17 results out of 54 samples were
discordant).
g. Factor Sensitivity for PT and APTT reagents
Factor sensitivity study was conducted for PT and APTT to assess the instrument
performance. The study used five lots of PT and APTT reagents to test Factor V and
Factor VII for PT assay and Factor VIII and Factor IX for APTT assay. The
coagulation factor sensitivity level of the PT and APTT assays on the Sysmex CS-
2100i coagulation analyzer was determined by comparing its results to the lower limit
of the respective reference range. Factor sensitivity for five reagent lots yielded:
• Factor V: 37 to 56%
• Factor VII: 46 to 56%
• Factor VIII: 45 to 51%
• Factor IX: 37 to 47%
h. Dilution analysis options:
The auto dilution and 4:1 processing mode are analysis features performed
automatically by the Sysmex CS-2100i coagulation analyzer where a calibration
range was exceeded or where a hook effect for an immunological reagent should be
prohibited. Fibrinogen and D-dimer reagent assays are applicable for these two
options. A bridging study was performed using three different plasma samples.
17

--- Page 18 ---
Samples were tested using manual dilution followed by dilution with the analyzer.
• Auto-dilution: Mean results of manually diluted samples were compared to
the mean results of the same samples automatically diluted by the analyzers.
• 4:1 processing mode: Mean results of undiluted samples were compared to the
mean results of the same samples diluted in the auto-dilution mode and 4:1
processing mode.
Deviation was calculated for each dilution analysis option and the results were within
±10% CV of the pre-defined acceptance criteria.
i. Normal Mode vs. Micro Mode
A comparison study was conducted in-house to demonstrate equivalence between two
modes. Resultant data for PT (seconds), PT (INR), APTT, fibrinogen, Antithrombin,
and D-dimer assays were within pre-established acceptance criteria.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
L. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
