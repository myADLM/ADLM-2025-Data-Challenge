L. Test Principle:
The SD GlucoNFC and SD GlucoNFC Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems use an
amperometric biosensor technology to measure the glucose level in human blood. The
reaction between glucose and the materials contained in the test strip, GDH-FAD, and
potassium ferrocyanide, results in an electrical current. The glucose concentration is
calculated from this current.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Performance testing was conducted on the SD GlucoNFC Blood Glucose Meter only.
This is acceptable because the only differences between the SD GlucoNFC and SD
GlucoNFC Multi BGMS are the name and intended use (single-patient vs. multiple-
patient use).
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability:
Venous blood was spiked with five different glucose concentrations (30-50, 51-110,
111-150, 151-250, and 251-400mg/dL) and tested on ten SD GlucoNFC meters and
three lots of test strips. Ten replicates were tested per meter per glucose
concentration. The results from all strip lots are summarized below:

Intermediate Precision:
Intermediate Precision was evaluated using three lots of test strips and ten SD
GlucoNFC meters. Three levels of Glucose control solutions were used. For each
level of control, ten replicates were taken each day for ten days, so that 100 individual
measurements were generated per control level. The results from all strip lots are
summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed measuring range for this device is 20-600mg/dL. Linearity was
evaluated using three lots of test strips, five SD GlucoNFC meters and 11 venous
whole blood samples with the following glucose concentrations: 16.8, 39.3 60.4, 86.4
119.5156.8, 227.3, 299.3, 367.8, 436.5, 512.5, 573.8, 647.3, and 720.3 mg/dL,
obtained by spiking with glucose solution. Each glucose level was analyzed 5 times
on each meter. Linear regression analysis for each meter compared to results
obtained using YSI resulted in the following:
Lot 1: y = 0.999x – 0.199; R2 = 0.998
Lot 2: y = 0.994x + 1.007; R2 = 0.998
Lot 3: y = 0.986x + 2.394; R2 = 0.997
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of
20-600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The SD GlucoNFC and SD GlucoNFC Multi systems are traceable to the NIST SRM
917c reference material. The method comparison study was performed using the YSI
2300 Glucose analyzer as the reference method (see Section M.2.a.)
Test strip stability:
Real time closed and open vial stability for the SD GlucoNFC and SD GlucoNFC
Multi blood glucose test strips were assessed in real-time studies. Study protocols
and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable to support the sponsor’s
claimed closed vial (shelf life) stability of 24 months, and open vial stability of 6
months when stored under the recommended storage conditions of 36°F to 90°F (2-
32°C) and relative humidity of 10-90%.

Control solution stability:
Real time closed and open vial stability for the control solutions were assessed in
real-time testing Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found
acceptable to support the sponsor’s claimed closed vial (shelf life) stability of 24
months, and open vial stability of 3 months when stored at the recommended storage
temperature of 46-86°F (8-30°C).
Value assignment of controls:
Three targeted concentrations of the controls are prepared gravimetrically and
analyzed using the YSI 2300 STAT Plus. Each level of the control solution is tested
40 times. The mean along with SD and CV are used to establish the ranges for each
level which are then provided on the test strip vial label.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the device is 20-600 mg/dL. This range is validated via
linearity study. See section M.1.b.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed interference studies with spiked venous blood samples at 2
different glucose concentrations (YSI reference values of 65 and 250mg/dL). The
samples were divided into 4 groups (1 control and 3 test conditions with 3 different
levels of interferent). Each sample was measured twice by the reference method and
once with five GlucoNFC meters per glucose concentration. The sponsor defines no
significant interference as bias < ± 10% for the test compared to control samples. The
following table lists the concentrations of each substance at which no significant
interference was detected.

b. Matrix comparison:
Venous whole blood samples from 120 volunteers were collected into sodium heparin
tubes. The blood glucose concentration was first measured by YSI, then the blood
glucose concentration was tested using three lots of test strips on 15 SD GlucoNFC
meters. The total range of samples tested was 25.9 – 513 mg/dL. To achieve
concentrations of glucose <50 mg/dL, 5 samples were allowed to glycolyze. To
achieve concentrations of glucose >400 mg/dL, 5 samples were spiked. The results
relative to the reference, YSI, are summarized below:

An additional study was done to support use of the device with venous whole blood when
collected with additional anticoagulants. The sponsor collected venous blood samples
from 100 volunteers into 4 separate tubes, containing sodium heparin, lithium heparin,
EDTA-K2 and EDTA-K3, using 3 test strip lots. The total range of samples tested was 38
to 475 mg/dL. To achieve glucose concentrations < 50 mg/dL and > 400 mg/dL samples
were spiked and allowed to glycolyze. The meter results relative to the reference, YSI,

Each subject collected fingerstick and AST (palm, forearm, upper arm) samples and
tested using the NFC meter. After self-testing, the healthcare professional measured
the blood glucose concentration from new fingerstick and alternative site punctures
using the YSI only. After each procedure, the subjects were asked to answer a
questionnaire evaluating their understanding of the procedures. The range of glucose
values for the finger stick samples was 62 - 416 mg/dL as measured by the reference,
YSI. The results are summarized below:

N. Instrument Name:
SD GlucoNFC Blood Glucose Meter
SD GlucoNFC Multi Blood Glucose Meter
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes _____x___ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes _____x___ or No ________
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___x_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm,
forearm, and upper arm. The SD GlucoNFC Multi BGMS may also be used with venous
whole blood. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary
action therefore there are no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
This is a non-coding device, therefore no calibration is required by the user.
6. Quality Control:
Each SD GlucoNFC Multi BGMS comes with one level of SD GlucoNavii Control
Solution (Level 2). The control solution is used to check if the meter and test strips as a
16

--- Page 17 ---
system are working normally, or if the user is performing the test correctly. Control
solution tests should be performed when a new box of test strips is opened, the test strip
container is left open or the test strips are damaged, if the strips are left in extreme
temperature or humidity, if the patient wants to check the meter and test strips, whenever
the meter is dropped, whenever a result does not agree with the level felt by the patient or
the patient wants to check if they are testing correctly.
Each system includes a SD Glucose check strip, which is used to check the electronic
performance of the meter. The check strip may be used before using the meter for the
first time, or after a long period of disuse of the meter. The check strip test does not
replace the Control Solution test.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Altitude study: An altitude study was performed in a barometric pressure test
chamber to simulate the following 4 different altitudes: sea level, 3,280 ft, 6,561ft,
and 11,480 ft. Venous blood was spiked with glucose to achieve three glucose
concentrations (45.5 mg/dL, 112 mg/dL and 348 mg/dL, as measured by YSI). Each
sample was tested in duplicate with 5 meters and the results were compared to YSI.
The results demonstrate acceptable bias to the reference to support the claims that
altitudes up to 11,480 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements
with the SD GlucoNFC and SD GlucoNFC Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring
Systems.
2. Hematocrit study: The effect of different hematocrit levels were evaluated using
venous whole blood samples with hematocrit levels of 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, 60%,
70%, and 75%, spiked to five glucose concentrations (42, 68, 92, 128, and 360
mg/dL, as measured by YSI). The samples were tested with 10 meters and three lots
of test strips. The results were compared to YSI and the normal 40% hematocrit. The
percent bias of the SD GlucoNFC meter results relative to YSI demonstrated adequate
performance to support the claimed hematocrit range of 10-70%.
3. Infection control studies: The SD GlucoNFC meter is intended for single-patient
use, and the SD GlucoNFC Multi meter is intended for multiple-patient use.
Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter
by an outside commercial laboratory service to demonstrate complete inactivation of
hepatitis B virus (HBV) with DisCide Ultra Disinfecting Towelettes (EPA Reg. No.
10492-4). Robustness studies were performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there
was no change in performance or in external materials of the meter after 10,950
cleaning and disinfection cycles with DisCide Ultra Disinfecting Towelettes. The
robustness studies were designed to simulate 3 years of multiple-patient use and 5
years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the
validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
4. Sample volume study: A sample volume study was performed using venous whole
blood samples spiked to three levels of glucose concentrations (50 mg/dL, 110 mg/dL
17

--- Page 18 ---
and 220 mg/dL, as measured by YSI) to evaluate the effect of different sample
volumes (0.2 mL, 0.3 mL, 0.4 mL, 0.5 mL, 0.6 mL, 0.8 mL, and 1.0 mL) on the
performance of the device. Results at each sample volume were compared to the
corresponding YSI values. Two lots of test strips and 10 meters were used. Results
from these studies support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.5 mL. The meter
displays error message E-2 when an insufficient amount of blood sample is applied.
The sponsor provided adequate validation for this error message.
5. Operating Temperature and Humidity: Operating temperature and humidity
conditions were evaluated using six meters and three lots of test strips with venous
whole blood samples at three glucose concentrations (55 mg/dL, 110 mg/dL, and 300
mg/dL by YSI). The following temperature and humidity conditions were tested:
46°F (8°C)/10% RH, 46°F (8°C)/90% RH, 113°F (45°C)/10%RH, and 113°F
(45°C)/90% RH. The results support the sponsor’s claimed operating temperature
from 46°F to 113°F (8°C - 45°C) and relative humidity range from 10-90%.
6. EMC testing and Electrical Safety Studies: The sponsor states that they followed
requirements of IEC 61010-1:2001, IEC61010-2-101:2002, and IEC 61326-2-6:2005.
The sponsor provided documentation stating that the SD GlucoNFC and SD
GlucoNFC Multi meters were found to be in compliance with the test standards IEC
61010-1:2001, IEC61010-2-101:2002, and IEC 61326-2-6:2005.
7. Readability Assessment: A Flesch-Kinkaid reading level assessment was conducted
demonstrating that the user manuals and test strip inserts were written at or below an
8th grade reading level.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
