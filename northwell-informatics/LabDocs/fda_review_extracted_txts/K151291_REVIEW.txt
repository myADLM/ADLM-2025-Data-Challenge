Features BD Veritor™ System Flu A+B assay BD Veritor™ System Flu
A+B assay
Intended Use The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B is a rapid Same
chromatographic immunoassay for the direct and qualitative
detection of influenza A and B viral nucleoprotein antigens from
nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs of symptomatic patients. The BD
Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B is a differentiated test,
such that influenza A viral antigens can be distinguished from
influenza B viral antigens from a single processed sample using a
single device. The test is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of
influenza A and B viral infections. A negative test is presumptive and
it is recommended that these results be confirmed by viral culture or
an FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay. Outside the
U.S., a negative test is presumptive and it is recommended that
these results be confirmed by viral culture or a molecular assay
cleared for diagnostic use in the country of use. FDA has not cleared
this device for use outside of the U.S. Negative test results do not
preclude influenza viral infection and should not be used as the sole
basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. The test
is not intended to detect influenza C antigens.
Performance characteristics for influenza A and B were established
during January through March of 2011 when influenza viruses
A/2009 H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage
were the predominant influenza viruses in circulation according to
the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the CDC entitled
“Update: Influenza Activity—United States, 2010-2011 Season, and
Composition of the 2011-2012 Influenza Vaccine.” Performance
characteristics may vary against other emerging influenza viruses.
If infection with a novel influenza virus is suspected based on current
clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by
public health authorities, specimens should be collected with
appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza
viruses and sent to the state or local health department for testing.
Virus culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL
3+ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

Differences:
The modified device differs from the currently marketed BD Veritor™ System Flu A+B
(Physician Office Kit) in the following way:
The labeling has been updated to reflect the addition of influenza A and B strain
analytical reactivity data and the lowest concentration detected for each of the tested
strains. Footnotes explaining TCID50/mL, EID50/mL, CEID50/mL, and HA have been
added to the “Analytical Sensitivity (Limit of Detection)” table and the “Strain Reactivity
with Influenza A and B Viruses” table in the package insert.
5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the
device and its components, and the results of the analysis
BD’s Risk Assessment process is based on a BD Product Risk Management procedure
which meets the requirement for risk management as set forth in ISO 14971:2007 and EN
ISO 14971:2012. Using this procedure, the following are estimated:
§ the Hazard,
§ the Adverse Effect(Harm to Patient),
§ the Potential Causes of the Hazard,
§ The probability of severity and the probability of occurrence are estimated.
Based on a resulting calculated Risk Index*, Risk Control Measures are identified, required
verification and validation activities are determined, and verification of the effectiveness of risk
control measures is determined.
*Risk Index:
Insignificant (GR) – individual risks in the green region are deemed negligible in comparison with other risks and in
relation to the benefit of using the product. Even if the risk falls into this region, the risk must be reduced as far as
possible. For risks falling into this region, the medical benefit is considered to outweigh the individual residual risk since
the combination of the occurrence and severity is considered low. These risks do not require individual risk benefit
analysis. Because risk of harm in this region are deemed negligible, risk control measures implemented in this region,
will not require documented verification of risk control measure effectiveness.
Investigate (YE) –individual risks in the yellow region are not negligible in comparison with other risks, therefore further
risk reduction must be investigated. This category requires evaluation for risk reduction and once all possible risk control
measures have been implemented, the residual risk is not reduced to insignificant (GR) is not possible, the individual
item in this region require a documented risk/benefit analysis to document acceptance of the residual risk (See
Attachment 3 for a Risk Benefit Analysis model.
Unacceptable/Intolerable (RE) – individual risks in the red region are unacceptable. This region requires the
implementation of risk control measures to reduce the risk. In general, BDDS products should not have items with
residual risks falling into this region. However, in an exceptional and rare circumstance, these items may be
documented in the risk/benefit analysis with approval by Medical Affairs at a director level or higher.

Analytical Reactivity Testing was conducted as described in section 3, Device Modifications.
BD Veritor™ System Flu A+B (Physician Office Kit) was successful in detecting all strains tested.
The acceptance criteria were fully met. The package insert was updated to include the data
obtained during this strain reactivity testing. The results of the strain reactivity testing reduced the

c) Declaration of Conformity with Design Controls
A “Declaration of Conformity with Design Controls” statement was submitted for the validation
activities and manufacturing facility by the Director of Regulatory Affairs and Quality Systems.
The statement indicates that;
1) To the best of knowledge of the Director of Regulatory Affairs and Quality Systems, the

6. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary, and the Indications for
Use Enclosure.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the
indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the
submitter’s description of the particular modifications and the comparative information between
the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has
not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New
510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially
equivalent to the previously cleared device.
