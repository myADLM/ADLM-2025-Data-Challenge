Features BD Veritor™ System Flu A+B assay (Laboratory Kit) BD Veritor™ System Flu A+B assay
(Laboratory Kit)
Intended Use The BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B is a rapid Same
chromatographic immunoassay for the direct and qualitative
detection of influenza A and B viral nucleoprotein antigens from
nasopharyngeal wash-aspirate and swab in transport media
samples from symptomatic patients. The BD Veritor System for
Rapid Detection of Flu A+B is a differentiated test, such that
influenza A viral antigens can be distinguished from influenza B viral
antigens from a single processed sample using a single device. The
test is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza A and B viral
infections. A negative test is presumptive and it is recommended
that these results be confirmed by viral culture or an FDA-cleared
influenza A and B molecular assay. Outside the U.S. a negative
test is presumptive and it is recommended that these results
be confirmed by viral culture or a molecular assay cleared for
diagnostic use in the country of use. FDA has not cleared this
device outside the U.S. Negative test results do not preclude
influenza viral infection and should not be used as the sole basis for
treatment or other patient management decisions. The test is not
intended to detect influenza C antigens.
Performance characteristics for influenza A and B
nasopharyngeal (NP) washes/aspirates were established during
January through March of 2011 when influenza viruses A/2009
H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage were
the predominant influenza viruses in circulation according to the
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the CDC entitled
"Update: Influenza Activity-United States, 2010-2011 Season, and
Composition of the 2011-2012 Influenza Vaccine." Performance
characteristics may vary against other emerging influenza viruses.
Performance characteristics for influenza A and B NP swabs
in transport media were established during January through
April of 2012 when influenza viruses A/2009 H1N1, A/H3N2,
B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage were the
predominant influenza viruses in circulation according to the
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the CDC entitled
"Update: Influenza Activity-United States, 2011-2012 Season, and
Composition of the 2012-2013 Influenza Vaccine."
If infection with a novel influenza virus is suspected based on current
clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by
public health authorities, specimens should be collected with
appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza
viruses and sent to the state or local health department for testing.
Virus culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL
3+ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

Differences
The package insert has been updated to include detection of the additional influenza A and B strains
in the analytical reactivity information section and minimal detected concentration information has
been listed for these additional viruses in the reactivity table.
The following limitation statement in the package insert has been moved from the “Analytical
Sensitivity (Limit of Detection)” section to the “Strain Reactivity with Influenza A and B Viruses”
section:
“Although this test has been shown to detect novel avian influenza A (H7N9) and H3N2v cultured
viruses the performance characteristics of this device with clinical specimens that are positive for
novel avian influenza A (H7N9) and H3N2v influenza viruses has not been established. The BD
Veritor™ System Flu A+B assay can distinguish between influenza A and B viruses, but it cannot
differentiate influenza A subtypes.”
Additional footnotes explaining TCID /mL, EID /mL, CEID /mL, and HA have been added to the
50 50 50
“Analytical Sensitivity (Limit of Detection)” table and the “Strain Reactivity with Influenza A and B
Viruses” table in the package insert.
6. Design Control Activities Summary, which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the
device and its components, and the results of the analysis
BD’s Risk Assessment process is based on a BD Product Risk Management procedure which
meets the requirement for risk management as set forth in ISO 14971:2007 and EN ISO
14971:2012. Using this procedure, the following are estimated:
§ the Hazard,
§ the Adverse Effect(Harm to Patient),
§ the Potential Causes of the Hazard,
§ The probability of Severity and the probability of occurrence are estimated.
Based on a resulting calculated Risk Index*, Risk Control Measures are identified, required
verification and validation activities are determined, and verification of the effectiveness of risk
control measures is determined.
*Risk Index:
Insignificant (GR) – individual risks in the green region are deemed negligible in comparison with other risks and in relation to the
benefit of using the product. Even if the risk falls into this region, the risk must be reduced as far as possible. For risks falling into
this region, the medical benefit is considered to outweigh the individual residual risk since the combination of the occurrence and
severity is considered low. These risks do not require individual risk benefit analysis. Because risk of harm in this region are
deemed negligible, risk control measures implemented in this region, will not require documented verification of risk control
measure effectiveness.
Investigate (YE) –individual risks in the yellow region are not negligible in comparison with other risks, therefore further risk
reduction must be investigated. This category requires evaluation for risk reduction and once all possible risk control measures
have been implemented, the residual risk is not reduced to insignificant (GR) is not possible, the individual item in this region
require a documented risk/benefit analysis to document acceptance of the residual risk (See Attachment 3 for a Risk Benefit
Analysis model.

[Table 1 on page 3]
	BD’s Risk Assessment process is based on a BD Product Risk Management procedure which	
	meets the requirement for risk management as set forth in ISO 14971:2007 and EN ISO	
	14971:2012. Using this procedure, the following are estimated:	
		§ the Hazard,
		§ the Adverse Effect(Harm to Patient),
		§ the Potential Causes of the Hazard,
		§ The probability of Severity and the probability of occurrence are estimated.
	Based on a resulting calculated Risk Index*, Risk Control Measures are identified, required	
	verification and validation activities are determined, and verification of the effectiveness of risk	
	control measures is determined.

Unacceptable/Intolerable (RE) – individual risks in the red region are unacceptable. This region requires the implementation of
risk control measures to reduce the risk. In general, BDDS products should not have items with residual risks falling into this
region. However, in an exceptional and rare circumstance, these items may be documented in the risk/benefit analysis with
approval by Medical Affairs at a director level or higher.
RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS:
The results of the analysis indicated an initial possible combination of severity and occurrence
that fell into S-3/P-3 category (i.e., Risk Index of “Investigate”):

b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities
required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied
To implement the indicated investigation, Protocol SDSP15001 was developed and approved
based on previously accepted FDA submissions regarding strain reactivity. Specific influenza
strains selection for this reactivity study was based on new circulating strains for 2015/2016
Influenza Season, as well as availability of other strains through CDC and WHO. Acceptability
criteria were the ability of the BD Veritor™ System Flu A+B assay (Laboratory Kit) to detect these
additional influenza strains.
Analytical Reactivity Testing was conducted as described in section 3, Device Modifications.
BD Veritor™ System Flu A+B assay (Laboratory Kit) was successful in detecting all strains tested.
The acceptance criteria were fully met. The package insert will be updated to include the data
obtained during this strain reactivity testing. The results of the strain reactivity testing reduced the
