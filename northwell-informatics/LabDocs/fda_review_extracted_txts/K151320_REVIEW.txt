I. Device Description:
The BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System (Phoenix System) is an
automated system for the rapid identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility
testing (AST) of clinically relevant bacterial isolates. The system includes the
following components:
• BD Phoenix instrument and software.
• BD Phoenix panels containing biochemical for organism ID testing and
antimicrobial agents for AST determinations.
• BD Phoenix ID Broth used for performing ID tests and preparing AST
Broth inoculum.
• BD Phoenix AST Broth used for performing AST tests only.
• BD Phoenix AST Indicator solution added to the AST Broth to aid in
bacterial growth determination.
The Phoenix panel is a sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene tray with
136 micro-wells containing dried reagents. Organisms for susceptibility testing
must be a pure culture and preliminary identified as a Gram-negative or Gram-
positive isolate. Phoenix panels are inoculated with a specified organism density
and placed into the instrument. Inoculum for use with the Phoenix system may be
prepared either manually or may be automated using the BD Phoenix AP System.
The Phoenix AST method is a broth based microdilution test. The Phoenix
System utilizes a redox indicator for the detection of organism growth in the
presence of an antimicrobial agent. Measurements of changes to the indicator as
well as bacterial turbidity are used in the determination of bacterial growth. Each
AST panel configuration contains several antimicrobial agents with a wide range
of two-fold doubling dilution concentrations.
The instrument houses the panels where they are continuously incubated at a
nominal temperature of 35° ± 1°C. The instrument takes readings of the panels
every 20 minutes. The readings are interpreted to give an identification of the
isolate, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values and category
interpretations, S, I, R (susceptible, intermediate, or resistant). For some
3

organism/drug combinations with susceptible/non-susceptible interpretation, the
category N (non-susceptible) is used.

L. Test Principle:
The AST portion of the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System is a broth-
based microdilution method that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-
reduction) to enhance detection of organism growth. The MIC is determined by
comparing growth in wells containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to
the growth in growth control wells which contain no antibiotic.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
In the original 510(k) pre-market submission cleared for the addition of
ertapenem to the Gram negative ID/AST or AST only Phoenix panels
(K123266), reproducibility testing was conducted at two external sites and
one internal site. Results of inter-site and intra site reproducibility studies
were acceptable and demonstrated best-case reproducibility of ≥ 95%.
In support of the current 510(k) submission, no new reproducibility studies

were conducted. However, the drug reporting range in the current 510(k) pre-
market submission is 0.0625-4µg/ml for Enterobacter aerogenes compared to
0.0625-8µg/mL in original 510(k) K123266. This decrease in drug range
resulted in fewer than 10 strains for reproducibility. Eight on-scale organisms
were re-analyzed using the modified algorithm.
Re-analyzed results of inter-site and intra-site reproducibility studies were
acceptable and demonstrated best-case reproducibility of ≥ 95% for both

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
In the original 510(k) pre-market submission cleared for the addition of
ertapenem to the Gram negative ID/AST or AST only Phoenix panels
(K123266), the FDA and CLSI recommended quality control isolates E.coli
ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were tested each
day of testing with the CLSI reference method and with the BD Phoenix
System. The inocula were standardized using both the automated (Phoenix
AP) and manual (PhoenixSpec) inoculum dilution/standardization methods.
In this current 510(k) pre-market submission, daily QC testing was performed
during the conduct of both the validation study of the revised algorithm and
the additional internal study requested by the FDA. The results of QC testing
are summarized in Table 1 below. The expected MIC range for
ertapenem/E.coli ATCC 25922 is below the reporting range of the device and
reference panels. Therefore, the MIC range for ertapenem/P. aeruginosa
ATCC 27853 was used to assess the QC acceptance criteria.

In the original 510(k) pre-market submission cleared for the addition of
ertapenem to the Gram negative ID/AST or AST only Phoenix panels
(K123266), Enterobacter aerogenes did not meet the expected performance
and the following limitation was added to the labeling:

0.0625-4µg/mL. The drug range for all other gram negative organism group
remains unchanged from the original submission 0.0625-8µg/mL.
Algorithm Modification:
BD determined that the cause of the decreased performance for Enterobacter
aerogenes and ertapenem in the original 510(k) pre-market submission
(K123266) was due to the device algorithm which biased the ertapenem MIC
value by one two-fold doubling dilution higher than that of the reference
method. To adjust for this bias the device algorithm was modified to utilize
the 8µg/mL well MIC result for the 4µg/mL well result. This algorithm
change was specific only to Enterobacter aerogenes (see Table 2).

Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the result
of the reference method and that of BD Phoenix within plus or minus one
serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are
on-scale for both the BD Phoenix panel and the reference method. Category
Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference
method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the BD Phoenix result.
The data re-analysis demonstrated that performance of Enterobacter
aerogenes is improved using the modified algorithm.

Validation Study:
To validate the algorithm modification, testing was performed at BD using 90
Enterobacter aerogenes strains read at MIC 4 and > 4 µg/mL. Comparative
testing results using both the CLSI reference broth microdilution and the
Phoenix system using the adjusted algorithm are summarized in Table 3.

In the validation study (Table 3), testing of 90 E. aerogenes isolates for
ertapenem using the modified algorithm demonstrated that the overall %EA
and % CA met the acceptance criteria of greater than or equal to 90%. No
very major or major errors were observed with either inoculation method.
Additional Internal Study:
In response to a request from the FDA, BD conducted an additional internal
study using the modified algorithm. The study included testing of a total of
129 (105 clinical and 24 challenge) Enterobacter aerogenes isolates. The 105
clinical isolates consisted of 54 fresh and 51 stock strains collected within the
past three years. The accuracy of results obtained with the Phoenix System
was determined by comparison to the CLSI reference broth microdilution
method. CLSI Reference panels included the drug range of (0.0625- 8 µg/ml)
and (0.0625- 4µg/mL) and compared to the Phoenix panel for E. aerogenes
(0.0625-4 µg/mL). Testing was performed with isolate inocula prepared
manually (primary method) and prepared with the BD Phoenix AP instrument
as summarized in Tables 4 and 5 below.

(0.9%) observed with the manual inoculum preparation method. There were
three major errors (2.8%) observed with the AP inoculum preparation method
(acceptance criteria ≤ 3%). No very major errors were observed with either
inoculation method.
Validation and Additional Studies Combined:
The internal study data, a total of 129 E. aerogenes isolates (105 clinical and
24 challenges), were added to the data from previously run validation study
which consisted of 90 isolates for a total of 219 E. aerogenes isolates. Testing

The overall % EA and % CA consistently met the acceptance criteria of greater
than or equal to 90% for the manual inoculum preparation method. There was
one major error (0.6%) and no very major errors.
The overall % EA and % CA consistently met the acceptance criteria of greater
than or equal to 90% for isolate inocula prepared with BD Phoenix AP
instrument. There were three major errors (1.7%) and no very major errors.
The data for both validation and internal studies showed acceptable
performance for ertapenem and E. aerogenes.
Resistant Isolates:
The data of the 219 E. aerogenes isolates provided by the sponsor in the
diagonal table format, showed that only 12 on-scale resistant isolates (35.3%)
at the MIC range of 2-4 µg/mL were tested. The majority 22 out of 34 (64.7%)
of resistant isolates tested resulted in MICs of > 4µg/mL or were not within
essential agreement. Similarly, in the AP inoculum preparation, only 10 on-
scale resistant E. aerogenes isolates (29.4%) at MIC range 2-4 µg/mL were
observed. The majority (24 out of 34 or 70.6%) resistant isolates tested were
either not evaluable or not within the essential agreement. This was addressed
by adding the following footnote to the labeling:
“Due to an insufficient number of on-scale resistant Enterobacter aerogenes
available during comparative testing, the performance of BD Phoenix
Automated System for isolates with MIC range of 2-4 µg/mL is unknown.”
Growth Rate:
The growth rate of the 219 isolates tested in the Phoenix System during both
the validation and additional studies was 100% for both preparation systems
(manual and BD Phoenix AP instrument). This meets the acceptance criteria of
< 10% non-growth of organisms tested.

MIC Trends:
Using the data provided by the sponsor in the diagonal table format
recommended in the AST Guidance, an analysis was conducted to check for
trending in MIC values.
As shown in Table 7, the data for E. aerogenes demonstrated an upward trend
of one doubling dilution in the MIC of ertapenem on the Phoenix Panel as
compared to the reference method 26.9% of the time, for the manual inoculum
preparation method and 28% of the time for the AP inoculum preparation
method. This may raise concerns for potential major errors.
Table 7. Trending of Results For Enterobacter aerogenes
Difference in MIC as Compared to the CLSI Reference Method
-2 -1 0 +1 +2 + ≥3
Manual Combined 0% 3.7% 66.4% 26.9% 2.2% 0%
(validation, internal (1/268) (10/268) (178/268) (72/268) (6/268) (1/268)
and re-analyzed data)
AP inoculum 0% 3% 64% 28% 4% 0%
Preparation (validation (0/219) (7/219) (141/219) (62/219) (8/219) (1/219)
and internal additional
study)
This higher MIC trend was addressed by adding the following footnote in the
labeling:
“The BD Phoenix Ertapenem MIC values tended to be one doubling dilution
higher when testing Enterobacter aerogenes (n=268) by the manual and the
AP inoculation methods compared to broth micro-dilution”.
