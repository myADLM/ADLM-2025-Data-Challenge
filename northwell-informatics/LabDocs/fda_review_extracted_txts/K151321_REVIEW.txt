2. Indication(s) for use:
The D-100 HbA1c test is intended for the quantitative determination of hemoglobin A1c
(IFCC mmol/mol and NGSP %) in human whole blood using ion-exchange high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on the D-100 Hemoglobin Testing System.
Hemoglobin A1c measurements are used as an aid in diagnosis of diabetes, as an aid in
identifying patients who may be at risk for developing diabetes mellitus, and for the
monitoring of long-term blood glucose control individuals with diabetes mellitus.
The Bio-Rad D-100 HbA1c test is intended for Professional Use Only.
Calibrators:
The D-100 HbA1c Calibrator Pack is for the calibration of the D-100 Hemoglobin
Testing System used for the quantitative determination of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in
human whole blood.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The D-100 HbA1c test is not intended for analysis of samples collected from newborns.
The D-100 HbA1c test should not be used to replace glucose testing in pediatric patients,
pregnant women, or patients with Type 1 diabetes.
HbA1c should not be used to diagnose diabetes during pregnancy or to diagnose
gestational diabetes. HbA1c reflects the average blood glucose levels over the preceding
3 months (the average life of a red blood cell), and therefore may be falsely low during
pregnancy or any other condition associated with recent onset of hyperglycemia and/or
decreased red cell survival.
The D-100 HbA1c test should not be used to diagnose diabetes in patients with the
following conditions:
• Any condition that alters the life span of the red blood cells, including recent
blood loss, transfusion, significant iron deficiency, hemolytic anemia (including
hereditary spherocytosis) or other hemolytic diseases, hemoglobinopathies and
thalassemias, as the altered red blood cell turnover interferes with the relationship
between mean blood glucose and HbA1c values.
• Malignancies or severe chronic hepatic and renal disease.
In cases of rapidly evolving Type 1 diabetes, the increase of HbA1c values might be
delayed compared to the acute increase in glucose concentrations. In these conditions,
diabetes mellitus must be diagnosed based on plasma glucose concentration and/or the
typical clinical symptoms.
For prescription use only.

L. Test Principle:
The device is based on chromatographic separation of HbA1c on a cation exchange cartridge.
A high pressure pumping system first delivers a buffer solution to a cation exchange
cartridge and detector. Whole blood samples undergo automatic hemolysis and dilution
before being delivered to the cation exchange cartridge in a buffer gradient of increasing
ionic strength. The various forms of hemoglobin exhibit charge differences at the pH of the
buffer and are separated on the cation exchange cartridge based on these charge differences.
The separated hemoglobin species then pass through a flow cell where changes in absorbance
are measured and recorded as a digital chromatogram. Software performs an analysis of the
hemoglobin peaks in the chromatogram and identifies peaks as target analytes. The software
includes an optional feature (Advisor) that compares the sample report against a set of rules
that are programmed to take user-specified actions.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the D-100 HbA1c test was evaluated based on CLSI EP05-A2 guidelines,
Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved
Guidelines - Second Edition. Four K -EDTA whole blood samples at concentrations near
3
5%, 6.5%, 8% and 12% HbA1c and five whole blood quality control solutions (Control 1,
Control 2, QC1, QC2, QC 3)were analyzed in duplicate, twice a day, with three lots of

sample levels. The eleven test samples (high, low and 9 intermediates) were run in
duplicate on one instrument; measured values were compared to expected values.
The regression parameters (slope, intercept, and R2) were the following:
Table 9: linearity Regression parameters
Units/Values Slope Intercept R2
NGPSP 0.9992 0.03961 0.9997
IFCC 0.999 0.455 0/9997
The linearity study was reviewed and found acceptable. Results of the linearity study
support the claimed measuring range of the device of 3.5% to 20% HbA1c (15-195
mmol/mol).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
D-100 HbA1c test standardization is traceable to both the International Federation of
Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) reference calibrators and the Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial (DCCT). The assay is certified by the National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP).The NGSP certification expires in one year. See the
NGSP website for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
HbA1c results are provided to users in two different units: NGSP equivalent units (%)
and IFCC equivalent units (mmol/mol). Results in % HbA1c from the NGSP
correlation are calculated from the individual quantitative results for Hemoglobin
A1c. The IFCC units of mmol/mol are calculated using the Master Equation: NGSP
(%) = 0.09148 x IFCC (mmol/mol) + 2.152.
Closed-Vial Stability:
Accelerated and real time stability study protocols and acceptance criteria for
reagents including the Analytical Cartridge, Prefilter, Sample Diluent, Elution Buffer
A, Elution Buffer B, Wash Solution and Cleaning Tube were reviewed and found to
be acceptable. The Analytical Cartridge and Prefilter are stable for 24months when
stored at 2–8°C, the Sample Diluent is stable for 24 months when stored unopened at
15–35°C, Elution Buffers and Wash Solution are stable for 24 months when stored
unopened at 2–8°C, the Cleaning Tube is stable for 12 months when stored unopened
at 15–35°C. Real time stability studies are ongoing.
In-Use Stability:
In-use stability study protocols and acceptance criteria for reagents including the
Analytical Cartridge, Prefilter, Sample Diluent, Elution Buffer A, Elution Buffer B,
and Wash Solution were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The Analytical

Cartridge and Prefilter are stable for 90 days when stored at 15–35°C when installed
on the instrument, the Sample Diluent is stable for 90 days after opening when stored
at 15–35°C, the Elution Buffers and Wash Solution are stable for 90 days at 15–35°C
when installed on the instrument.
Calibrators and Control Materials
Value assignment:
Value assignment for the D-100 HbA1c Calibrator Pack (Level 1 and Level 2) is
conducted by measuring each Level over multiple runs using multiple D-100
Hemoglobin Testing System instruments. The D-100 HbA1c Calibrator Pack Levels
are assigned final concentration values based on the mean of multiple runs and
comparison to values of IFCC reference calibrators run in parallel.
The commercially available Bio-Rad Lyphocheck Diabetes control materials and the
Bio-Rad Liquicheck Diabetes control materials were previously reviewed in k070546
and k052838 respectively.
Open Vial Stability:
The open-vial stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
found acceptable. Results support the open vial stability claim for reconstituted D-100
HbA1c Calibrator Pack of 24 hours when stored at 2-8 °C.
Closed Vial Stability:
The closed-vial stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
found acceptable. Results support a closed vial stability claim for reconstituted D-100
Calibrator Pack of 24 months when stored at 2-8 °C. Real time stability studies are
ongoing.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Endogenous Interference
An Endogenous Interference studies was performed based on CLSI EP07-A2,
Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry. This study assessed common or known
endogenous substances that could interfere with the D-100 HbA1c test. Potentially
interfering endogenous substances were analyzed by spiking whole blood samples
with HbA1c values of ~6.5% HbA1c and ~8% HbA1c with potentially interfering
substances to create test samples. Ten replicates of each test and reference sample
10

--- Page 11 ---
(sample containing no potential interferent) were analyzed and the difference in
HbA1c value between the mean of test and reference replicates was determined.
Significant interference was defined by the sponsor as ≥7% change in HbA1c value
of the mean of the test samples relative to mean of the reference samples.
The following endogenous substances showed no significant interference at the
concentrations described below:

Total protein 21 g/dL
ii. Drug Interference
A Drug Interference studies was performed based on CLSI EP07-A2, Interference
Testing in Clinical Chemistry. This study assessed common or known drugs that
could interfere with the D-100 HbA1c Test. Two whole blood sample pools at ~6.5%
HbA1c (Low) and ≥8.0% HbA1c (High) were spiked with each potentially interfering
drug to create test samples. Ten replicates of each test and reference sample (sample
containing no potential interferent) were analyzed and the difference in HbA1c value
between the mean of test and reference replicates was determined. Significant
interference was defined by the sponsor as ≥7% change in HbA1c value of the mean
of the test samples relative to mean of the reference samples.
The following endogenous substances showed no significant interference at the
concentrations described below:

iii. Cross Reactivity with Hemoglobin Derivatives
Hemoglobin Derivatives Interference studies was performed based on CLSI EP07-
A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry. These studies study assessed potential
interference from Acetylated hemoglobin (Hb), Carbamylated hemoglobin (Hb) and
Labile HbA1c. Two whole blood sample pools at ~6.5% HbA1c (Low) and ≥8.0%
HbA1c (High) were spiked with each potentially interfering hemoglobin derivative.
Serial dilutions of each high concentration test sample were prepared, resulting in five
or six levels of each potentially interfering hemoglobin derivative. Ten replicates of
each level and reference sample (sample containing no potential interferent) were
analyzed and the difference in HbA1c value between the mean of each level and the
reference was determined. Significant interference was defined by the sponsor as
≥7% change in HbA1c value of the mean of the test samples relative to mean of the
reference samples. The test result conclusions are as follows:
• Carbamylated Hb - (up to 5% Carbamylated Hb) does not interfere with this assay.
• Labile A1c- (up to 7% Labile A1c, ≈1200mg/dL glucose) does not interfere with

• Acetylated Hb- (up to 50 mg/dL acetylsalicylic acid) does not interfere with this
assay.
Results showed there was no cross reactivity with these substances at physiological
levels and the labeling states that at physiologically occurring concentrations there is
no interference from labile A1c, carbamylated hemoglobin or acetylated hemoglobin.
iv. Hemoglobin Variant Interference
A Hemoglobin Variant Interference study was performed using a total of 135 samples
known to contain hemoglobin variants S, C, E, D, A2 and F. 78 whole blood patient
samples containing an HbA1c ~6.5% and ~9.0% and the appropriate hemoglobin
variant concentrations at levels typically found in heterozygous individuals (up to
30% to 40%) were tested using the D-100 HbA1c Test on the D-1000 Hemoglobin
Testing System and compared to results obtained by a reference method that has been
demonstrated to be free from interference with the hemoglobin variant being tested
(Trinity Biotech Ultra2 A1c and Premier Hb9210 analyzers). The following tables
show the samples that were measured (Table 12) and the range of biases that were
observed (Table 13) for Hemoglobin Variants S, C, D and E, and the mean biases
with 2 standard deviations observed for Hemoglobin Variants F and A2 :

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
A study was conducted to show the stability of samples collected in: (1) K -EDTA, (2)
2
K -EDTA, (3) Potassium Oxalate/Sodium Fluoride, (4) Sodium Citrate, (5) Sodium
3
Heparin, and (6) Lithium Heparin. Study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed
and found to be acceptable to support storage of samples in all of these matrices at 15-
35°C for 1 day, at 2-8°C for 7 days, at -20°C for 7 days and at -70°C for 6 months.
Additional real-time studies of sample stability at -70°C are ongoing.
A study was conducted to show the stability of pre-diluted samples at system operating
temperatures. Study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable to support storage of pre-diluted samples for 3 hours at15-35°C.
5. Calibration:
Calibration must be performed once following the installation of every new analytical
cartridge. Additional calibration may be performed at the discretion of the laboratory.
Calibration is performed using the D-100 HbA1c Calibrator Pack.
6. Quality Control:
Quality control of the D-100 Hemoglobin Testing System can be conducted using
commercially available Bio-Rad Lyphocheck Diabetes control materials and Bio-Rad
Liquicheck Diabetes control materials; these were previously cleared in k070546 and
k052838 respectively. Labeling for the device states that in keeping with good laboratory
practice, at least one diabetic and one non-diabetic control specimen should be tested
each day patient samples are tested and that each laboratory should establish its own
guidelines for corrective action to be taken if the expected control values are not
obtained.
