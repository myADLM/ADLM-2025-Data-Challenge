2. Indication(s) for use:
Healgen Propoxyphene Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative
determination of Propoxyphene in human urine at a Cut-Off concentration of 300 ng/mL.
The test is available in a Strip format, a Cassette format, a Dip Card format and a Cup
format.
The test may yield preliminary positive results even when the prescription drug
Propoxyphene is ingested, at prescribed doses; it is not intended to distinguish between
prescription use or abuse of this drug. There is no uniformly recognized cutoff
concentration level for Propoxyphene in urine. The test provides only preliminary test
results. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a
confirmed analytical result. GC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test
result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive. For in vitro diagnostic use
only. It is intended for prescription and for over-the-counter use.
Healgen Nortriptyline Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative
determination of Nortriptyline in human urine at a Cut-Off concentration of 1000 ng/mL.
The test is available in a Strip format, a Cassette format, a Dip Card format and a Cup
format.
The test may yield preliminary positive results even when the prescription drug
Nortriptyline is ingested, at prescribed doses; it is not intended to distinguish between
prescription use or abuse of this drug. There is no uniformly recognized cutoff
concentration level for Nortriptyline in urine. The test provides only preliminary test
results. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a
confirmed analytical result. GC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test
result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive. For in vitro diagnostic use
only. It is intended for prescription and for over-the-counter use.
Healgen EDDP (Methadone Metabolite) Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the
qualitative determination of EDDP (2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine)
in human urine at a Cut-Off concentration of 300 ng/mL. The test is available in a Strip

I. Device Description:
Healgen Propoxyphene Test, Healgen Nortriptyline Test and Healgen EDDP Test are
immunochromatographic assays for Propoxyphene, Nortriptyline and EDDP. Each assay
test is a lateral flow system for the qualitative detection of Propoxyphene, Nortriptyline
and EDDP (target analyte) in human urine. The products are in vitro diagnostic devices,
which come in the form of: Strips, Cassettes, DipCards, or Cups. Each product contains
a Test Device (in one of the four formats), and a package insert. Each test device is
sealed with a desiccant in an aluminum pouch. The test is intended for use as the first
step in a two-step process to provide consumers with information concerning the
presence or absence of the above stated drugs in a urine sample. Information regarding
confirmatory testing – the second step in the process is provided in the instructions for
use.

None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
Healgen Propoxyphene Test, Healgen Nortriptyline Test and Healgen EDDP Test are
rapid tests for the qualitative detection of Propoxyphene, Nortriptyline and EDDP in urine
samples. Each assay test is a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay. Each assay uses
a monoclonal anti-mouse antibody -dye conjugate against the drugs containing gold
chloride and fixed drug-protein conjugates and anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody in the
test membranes.
When the absorbent end of the test is immersed into the urine specimen, the urine is
absorbed into the device by capillary action, mixes with the antibody-dye conjugate, and
flows across the pre-coated membrane. When sample drug levels are zero or below the
target Cut-Off, antibody-dye conjugate binds to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in
the Test Region (T) of the device. This produces a colored Test line that, regardless of its
intensity, indicates a negative result.
When sample drug levels are at or above the target Cut-Off, the free drug in the sample
binds to the antibody-dye conjugate preventing the antibody-dye conjugate from binding
to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. This
prevents the development of a distinct colored band in the test region, indicating a
preliminary positive result.
To serve as a procedure control, a colored line will appear at the Control Region (C), if the
test has been performed properly because of the antibody-dye conjugate binding to anti-
mouse IgG immobilized in the Control Region(C) of the device.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision performance of the Healgen Propoxyphene Test, Healgen
Nortriptyline Test and Healgen EDDP was evaluated using 3 lots for each format
(Strip, Cassette, Cup, Dip Card) of the device by three operators. For each
concentration, tests were performed two runs per day for 25 days by three different
operators for each format of devices. The testing consisted of analyzing samples in
2 runs per day for 25 days (n = 50 per lot) and by spiking drug free urine samples to
achieve 100% cut off, -75% cut off, -50% cut off, -25% cut off, +25% cut off, +50%
cut off , +75% cut off and +100% cut off drug concentrations. Each drug
concentration was confirmed by GC/MS. Results are summarized below for each lot
and device.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was evaluated by spiking various concentrations of similarly
structured drug compounds into drug-free urine. Samples were tested using three lots
of each device for all formats. Results are expressed as a minimum concentration of
metabolite or compound required to produce a response approximately equivalent to
the cutoff concentration of the assay. The percent cross-reactivity of those
compounds is listed below:

Specific Gravity and pH studies:
Twelve urine samples with specific gravity ranges (1.000-1.035) were collected and
spiked with each drug at 25% below and 25% above cutoff levels. Each sample was
tested using three lots of each format of the test devices. The results showed that a
specific gravity range of 1.000 to 1.035 does not affect the accuracy of the tests.
A negative urine pool was adjusted to a pH range of 4.00 to 9.00 in 1 pH unit
increments and was spiked with each drug at 25% below and 25% above cutoff
levels. Samples were tested using three lots of each format of the devices, and results
showed that urine pH range of 4.00 to 9.00 does not affect the accuracy of the tests.
f. Assay cut-off:
The characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed
cutoff concentration of 300 ng/mL Propoxyphene, 1000 ng/mL Nortriptyline, and 300
ng/mL EDDP is described in the precision section, M.1.a. above.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison for the Healgen Propoxyphene Test, Healgen Nortriptyline
Test and Healgen EDDP Test was performed internally against the reference method,
GC/MS. Operators ran 80 unaltered urine samples on each format of the devices,
where each device format was tested by an independent set of three operators. The
samples were masked and randomized prior to testing and device results were
compared to GC/MS. The results are presented in the table below:

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 560 lay persons
testing each of the Propoxyphene, the Nortriptyline and the EDDP devices. Total of
1680 individuals performed the study. A total of 204 females and 356 males tested
the Propoxyphene samples, 213 females and 347 males tested the Nortriptyline
samples and 209 females and 351 males tested the EDDP samples. They had diverse
educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 21 to > 50 years.
Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations; negative, +/-75%,
+/-50%, +/-25% of the cutoff by spiking drugs into drug free-pooled urine specimens.
The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample was
aliquoted into individual containers and blind-labeled. Each participant was provided
with the package insert, 1 blind labeled sample and a device. The results are
summarized below.
