Immunalysis EDDP Specific Urine Enzyme Immunoassay
The Immunalysis EDDP Specific Urine Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous enzyme
immunoassay with cutoffs of 100ng/mL, 300ng/mL and 1000ng/mL. The assay is
intended for use in laboratories for the qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of EDDP
in human urine with automated clinical chemistry analyzers. The 100ng/mL and
300ng/mL cutoff is for qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis. The 1000ng/mL cutoff
is for qualitative analysis only. This assay is calibrated against EDDP. This in-vitro
device is for prescription use only.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as
GC-MS or permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.
The Immunalysis EDDP Specific Urine Enzyme Immunoassay Kit provides only a
preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be
used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/ Mass
Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional
judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when
preliminary positive results are used.
Immunalysis EDDP Urine Control Sets
The Immunalysis EDDP Urine Control Sets are used as control materials in Immunalysis
EDDP Specific Urine Enzyme Immunoassay.
Immunalysis EDDP Urine Calibrators
The Immunalysis EDDP Urine Calibrators are used as calibrators in the Immunalysis
EDDP Specific Urine Enzyme Immunoassay for the qualitative and semi-quantitative
determination of EDDP in urine on automated clinical chemistry analyzers.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
Not for use in Point of Care settings.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Beckman Coulter AU 400e chemistry analyzer was used to generate data for this
submission.
Automated clinical chemistry analyzers capable of maintaining a constant reaction
temperature, pipetting samples and reagents, mixing reagents, timing reactions and
measuring enzyme rates at 340nm can be used for the assay.

L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on the competition of EDDP labeled enzyme glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and the free EDDP in the urine sample for the fixed amount of
antibody binding sites. In the absence of the free EDDP in the urine sample, the antibody
(recombinant antibody) binds the EDDP enzyme conjugate and enzyme activity is inhibited.
This creates a dose response relationship between EDDP concentration in the urine and
enzyme activity. The enzyme G6PDH activity is determined at 340 nm
spectrophotometrically by the conversion of NAD to NADH.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
All the performance studies were performed on the Beckman Coulter AU 400e chemistry
analyzer.
1. Analytical performance:
NOTE: the 1000 ng/mL cutoff is for qualitative analysis only.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed by one experienced operator following the CLSI
(EP5‐A2) precision guidelines. Drug free negative urine was spiked with EDDP to
concentrations representing 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175 and 200% of the device
cutoff (100ng/mL, 300ng/mL and 1000ng/mL). Each level sample was tested in
duplicate per run, two runs per day for twenty days (total N= 80/level) on the
Beckman Coulter AU 400e chemistry analyzer. The results are summarized in the
table below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
Calibrators and controls are prepared from a standard solution of EDDP purchased
from a commercial vendor. This standard solution is diluted with drug-free synthetic
urine matrix to make the three control sets of low and high controls, and calibrator set
(of 5 level calibrators). The concentrations of the prepared solutions are confirmed
by GC/MS or LC/MS/MS.
Value Assignment – Calibrators and Controls
A commercially available standard solution of EDDP is mixed with a commercially
available drug-free synthetic urine matrix to the desired calculated concentrations for
the LOW and HIGH controls for the three cutoffs and the calibrators. The calibrators
and controls are tested by GC/MS or LC/MS/MS. Values are assigned to the controls
once the GC/MS or LC/MS/MS results are within acceptable ranges. The negative
standard is prepared with the drug-free synthetic urine matrix. The negative standard

is compared to a reference negative standard to ensure that it is free of EDDP. Value
is assigned when the test result is within the acceptable range. Acceptance criteria for
value assignment were reviewed and deemed acceptable.
Calibrators and Controls Stability Studies
Accelerated and real-time stability studies in the qualitative and semi-quantitative
modes were conducted on multiple lots of Immunalysis EDDP Urine Controls and
Immunalysis EDDP Urine Calibrators. The stability protocols and acceptance criteria
for open and closed vial were reviewed and found acceptable. The open vial and
closed vial study results support the open vial stability claim of twelve months and
closed vial stability claim of twelve months when stored at 2 to 8 ºC for the
Immunalysis EDDP Urine Controls and Immunalysis EDDP Urine Calibrators.

Potential interference from non-structurally related drugs and metabolites was
evaluated in the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes by spiking these compounds
into drug free urine containing EDDP at ± 25% of the cutoff (75ng/mL and 125ng/mL
for the 100ng/mL cutoff, 225ng/mL and 375ng/mL for the 300ng/mL or 750ng/mL
and 1,250ng/mL for the 1,000ng/mL cutoff). The results were the same for the
qualitative and semi-quantitative modes and are summarized below:

Endogenous compounds
Potential interference from endogenous compounds was evaluated in the qualitative
and semi-quantitative modes by spiking these compounds into drug free urine
containing EDDP at ±25% of the cutoff (75ng/mL and 125ng/mL for the 100ng/mL
cutoff, 225 ng/mL and 375 ng/mL for the 300 ng/mL cutoff or 750 ng/mL and1,250
ng/mL for the 1,000 ng/mL cutoff).. The results were the same for the qualitative and
semi-quantitative modes for all cutoffs and are summarized below:

(750ng/mL cutoff and 1250ng/mL) in both the qualitative and semiquantitative
modes. The following statement is provided in the limitations section of the labeling:
“Boric Acid at 1% w/v may cause false negative results. Boric Acid should not be
used as a preservative for urine specimens.”
pH and Specific Gravity
To evaluate potential interference from the pH of urine, device performance in the
qualitative and semi-quantitative modes was tested using a range of urine pH values
(3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0 and 11.0). All test samples were prepared in drug
free urine containing EDDP at ± 25% of the 100 ng/mL cutoff (75 ng/mL and 125
ng/mL), 300 ng/mL cutoff (225 ng/mL and 375 ng/mL) and 1000 ng/mL cutoff (750
ng/mL cutoff and 1250 ng/mL). No positive or negative interference was observed at
urine pH values ranging from 3.0 to 11.0 for each test mode.
To evaluate potential interference from the specific gravity of urine, device
performance in the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes was tested using a range
of urine specific gravity values (1.000, 1.002, 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025 and
1.030). All test samples were prepared in drug free urine containing EDDP at ±25%
of the 100 ng/mL cutoff (75 ng/mL and 125 ng/mL), 300 ng/mL cutoff (225 ng/mL
and 375 ng/mL) 1000 ng/mL cutoff (750 ng/mL cutoff and 1250 ng/mL). No positive
or negative interference was observed at urine specific gravity values ranging from
1.000 to 1.030 for each test mode.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration of 100 ng/mL, 300 ng/mL and 1000ng/mL EDDP is described in the
precision section, M.1.a. above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 80 unaltered urine samples from clinical testing laboratories were analyzed
by the candidate device in the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes on the
Beckman Coulter AU 400e clinical chemistry analyzer and the comparative mass
spectrometry based quantitative method (LC/MS). The results from the study are
summarized below:
