Purified recombinant Jo-1 antigen is coated onto paramagnetic beads. The bead suspension is
lyophilized and stored in the bead tube. Prior to use in the BIO-FLASH® system, the sealed
reagent tubes are pierced with the reagent cartridge lid and the beads are rehydrated and
resuspended using resuspension buffer by pipetting up and down with a transfer pipette. The
reagent cartridge is then loaded onto the BIO-FLASH® instrument. Samples are also loaded
onto the instrument in sample racks. A patient serum sample is prediluted by the BIO-
FLASH® with system rinse in a small disposable plastic cuvette. Small amounts of the
diluted patient serum, the beads, and assay buffer are all combined into a second cuvette, and
mixed. This cuvette is then incubated at 37°C. The beads are magnetized and washed several
times. Isoluminol conjugated anti-human IgG antibodies are then added to the cuvette, and
again incubated at 37°C. The beads are magnetized and washed repeatedly. The isoluminol
conjugate is oxidized when Trigger 1 and Trigger 2 are added to the cuvette, and the flash of
light produced from this reaction is measured as Relative Light Units (RLU) by the BIO-
FLASH® optical system. The RLU are proportional to the amount of isoluminol conjugate
that is bound to the human IgG, which is in turn proportional to the amount of anti-Jo-1
antibodies bound to the corresponding Jo-1 on the beads.
For determining the amount of antibody in a sample, the QUANTA Flash® Jo-1 assay
utilizes a predefined lot specific Master Curve that is uploaded onto the instrument through
the reagent cartridge barcode. Every new lot number of reagent cartridge must be calibrated
before first use, with the QUANTA Flash® Jo-1 Calibrators. Based on the results obtained
with the two Calibrators included in the Calibrator Set, an instrument specific Working
Curve is created, which is used to calculate chemiluminescent units (CU) from the instrument
signal (RLU) obtained for each sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision: The precision of the QUANTA Flash® Jo-1 assay was evaluated by
testing nine serum samples prepared to contain various concentrations of anti-Jo-1
antibody. Each sample was run in duplicate, twice a day, for 20 days with one
reagent lot (total of 80 replicates per sample). All %CV values were within the
manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance limit (< 10%). The results are
summarized in the table below.

Reproducibility: A total of five samples were tested at three different sites with one
reagent lot to evaluate the site-to-site reproducibility. Each sample was run in
replicates of five, once a day for five days, to generate 25 data points at each site
(N=75 per sample for all sites combined). Data were analyzed for within-run,
between-run, between-site, and total precision. The results are summarized in the
tables below. All %CV values were within the manufacturer’s pre-determined
acceptance limit (< 15%).

To evaluate lot-to-lot reproducibility, five samples with anti-Jo-1 antibody
concentration at various levels across the measuring range (18.6, 23.3, 73.3, 382.5,
and 911.9 CU) were tested. Each sample was tested in replicates of five, one run per
day for five days using three difference reagent lots. Mean and %CV for each sample
were calculated and %CV values were from 3.6% to 7.9% for all samples.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity: The analytical measuring range (AMR) of the assay is defined by the
lowest and highest points on the master curve, e.g., 2.2–1147.2 CU. The linearity
across this range was evaluated by a study according to CLSI EP6-A. Serially diluted
samples with anti-Jo-1 antibody concentrations ranging from 1.7 to 1226.6 CU were
prepared by diluting each of four high positive serum samples with analyte free
(stripped) serum in 10% increments. Each dilution was tested in duplicate.
Percentage recovery of obtained mean results was calculated compared to the
expected results with the acceptant criteria of recovery between 80 and 120%, or ± 4
CU, whichever is greater. The linear regression analysis was performed using the
samples falling within the master curve and the results of samples within AMR are

Auto-rerun: To validate the auto-rerun function with 1:20 dilutions, two high positive
specimens with anti-Jo-1 antibody concentrations above assay measuring range
(8967.5 and 19914.0 CU) were run with the auto-rerun function enabled on the BIO-
FLASH®. The same set of samples prepared manually with a 1:20 fold dilution was
used as reference and tested with the concentration of 9815.2 and 19343.6 CU,
respectively. The % recovery values for results obtained with the auto-rerun results
compared to results obtained with the manual dilution were 91% and 103%,
respectively.
Hook effect: Two high positive samples having anti-Jo-1 antibody concentration
above assay measuring range (31783.1 CU and 65625.5 CU) were examined to assess
potential hook effect. No hook effect was observed up to 65625.5 CU.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: There is no recognized standard or reference material for anti-Jo-1
autoantibodies. The calibrator and control values are directly traceable to in-house
standards that are used to create the master curves for the QUANTA Flash® Jo-1.
Value assignment: The QUANTA Flash® Jo-1 Calibrators and Controls are
manufactured by diluting human serum that contains high titer of anti-Jo-1 antibodies.
The target CU is achieved through trial dilutions on small scale. Once a dilution is
selected, the Calibrators and Controls are bulked, tested, and adjusted. Upon
completion of the manufacturing process, the Calibrators and Controls are tested on at
least two instruments, on at least two lots of reagent cartridge, in replicates of 10 to
determine final value assignment. The target values and ranges for the Calibrators
and Controls are listed below:

Stability:
Kit stability (unopened): The accelerated stability study was performed using three
lots of Jo-1 coupled beads, calibrators, and controls. Real-time stability is on-going;
the results to date support a claim of 12 months stability for unopened reagent
cartridge, up to 15 months on calibrators, and up to 16 months on controls stored at
2–8°C.
On-board (In-use) stability: On-board stability study was performed for calibrators,
controls and reagent cartridge:
i. Calibrators: Calibrators were placed uncapped, onboard the instrument, and
calibration was performed five times over 9.5 hours. Controls and a panel of
characterized patient specimens were run on each calibration curve. Each
calibrator is measured in triplicate during calibration.
ii. Controls: Two vials of each control were assayed twice a day for a total of 21
runs. The first run was used to establish baseline value, and then an additional
19 runs were performed. During runs, the Controls were left uncapped,
onboard the instrument for 15 minutes per run. When not in use, the controls
were capped, and stored at 5ºC ± 3°C.
iii. Reagent Cartridge: Two lots of cartridges were tested with four serum
specimens (with different reactivity levels) along with the Negative and
Positive Controls. The specimens were tested periodically up to 92 days.
Percent recoveries were calculated compared to the day zero average values,
and linear regression analysis was performed by plotting % recovery against
the number of days.
All results met the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria and support the following on-
board stability claim:
Calibrators 8 hours on-board; up to 4 calibrations
Controls Up to 15 uses with 10 min on-board per use
Reagent Cartridge 71 days on-board
Sample stability: The study was performed with seven samples (two negatives, three
positives, and two around the cut-off), tested at 2–8°C, and room temperature (RT).
In addition, the samples were tested for the stability after up to three repeated

freeze/thaw cycles. The results support sample stability up to 48 hours of storage at
RT, up to 14 days of storage at 2–8°C, and up to three freeze/thaw cycles when
samples are stored at or below -20°C.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying four blank samples in five
replicates per sample over three days with two reagent lots. Sixty data points were
generated. LoB was calculated at the 95th percentile using the non-parametric
method, as the dataset showed non-normal distribution. The LoB was determined to
be 337 RLU.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by assaying four samples with anti-Jo-
1 antibody concentration between LoB and approximately four times of LoB. Each
sample was tested in five replicates over three days with two reagent lots. LoD value
was calculated as the LoB + 1.645 x SD of the replicates for the low level samples.
The LoD of the QUANTA Flash® Jo-1 assay was determined to be 409 RLU, which
is below the value of the lowest QUANTA Flash® Jo-1 Master Curve standard (2.2
CU), and therefore below the AMR of the assay.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interference: Three serum samples with antibody concentrations at 11.3
CU (negative), 21.1 CU (around the cut-off), and 117.0 CU (positive) were spiked
with known quantities of bilirubin (10, 5.0, or 2.5 mg/dL), hemoglobin (200, 100, or
50 mg/dL), or triglycerides/cholesterol (1000/224.3, 500/112.2, or 250/56.1 mg/dL).
Each sample was tested in triplicate and the recovery was calculated by comparing to
control samples spiked with the same volume of diluents. For rheumatoid factor (RF)
interference, three samples with antibody concentrations at 7.3 CU (negative), 32.5
CU, and 123 CU were tested by spiking with different proportions of a high positive
RF IgM serum sample (1894 IU/mL). Each sample was tested triplicate and the
recovery was calculated by comparing to control samples spiked with the same
proportions of a negative serum. No interference (85%–115% recovery for samples
above the cutoff, and ± 4 CU difference for samples below the cutoff) was detected in
the samples up to the concentrations listed in the table below:
Potential Interfering Maximum
Substances Concentration
Bilirubin 10 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 200 mg/dL
Triglycerides 1000 mg/dL
Cholesterol 224.3 mg/dL
RF 947 IU/mL
Analytical cross-reactivity: Cross reactivity of the QUANTA Flash® Jo-1 was
investigated using 12 reference sera from the Center of Disease Control and

Prevention (CDC) with three lots of QUANTA Flash Jo-1 reagents. The ANA human
reference serum #10 (for human antibodies to Jo-1) tested positive on all three lots
with an average of 935.9 CU. The other reference sera in the panel were below 2.2
CU for all three lots tested.
f. Assay cut-off:
The QUANTA Flash® Jo-1 cut-off was determined by testing a set of samples from a
reference population of 207 subjects (31 systemic sclerosis samples, 30 systemic
lupus erythematosus samples, 21 Crohn’s disease samples, 19 multiple sclerosis, 19
hepatitis C positive samples, 18 ulcerative colitis samples, 13 psoriatic arthritis
samples, 10 syphilis positive samples, 10 healthy individuals, 9 polymyalgia
rheumatica samples, 8 rheumatoid arthritis samples, 5 spondylarthritis samples, 3
Sjögren’s syndrome samples and 11 other disease control samples). The cut-off was
established as 20 CU (10000 RLU) based on the 99th percentile of the results
obtained.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Samples for method comparison analysis included 487 samples from the clinical
validation study (see below) along with 26 additional samples contrived by diluting
Jo-1 positive samples with negative serum to cover the reportable range of assay.
These samples were tested on both the QUANTA Flash® Jo-1 and on the predicate
FIDIS Connective 10. From the total of 513 samples, results for 105 samples were
within the reportable range of the assay. The results are summarized below:
FIDIS Connective 10
