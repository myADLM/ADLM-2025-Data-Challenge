L. Test Principle:
The Glucose (Hexokinase) method is based on a modification of Slein, using Hexokinase and
glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase to catalyze the reaction. Glucose is phosphorylated with
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the reaction catalyzed by Hexokinase (HK). The product,
glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) is then oxidized with the concomitant reduction of nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH in the reaction catalyzed by glucose-6-
phosphatedehygrogenase (G6PDH). The formation of NADH caused an increasing in
absorbance at 340nm. The increase is proportional to the amount of glucose in the sample.
The ISE method uses ion selective principles to measure the sodium, potassium, and
chloride. The ISE module measures the potentials developed when the sample is positioned
in the electrodes. Next, Calibrant A is positioned in the electrodes. The difference in the two

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed according to CLSI document EP5-A2, Evaluation
of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved
Guideline. Three levels of serum based controls were tested on the Pictus 700 Clinical
Chemistry Analyzer for each analyte in one run of 20 replicates to obtain the within
run precision (N=20). Three levels of serum based controls were tested in duplicate
twice per day for 20 days to obtain the total precision (N=80). Results are

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The glucose calibrator material is traceable to NIST SRM #917b, Clinical Dextrose.
The ISE calibration material is traceable to commercially-available, 99.9% ACS
grade materials. The glucose calibrator material was previously cleared under
k020454. The ISE calibrator material for sodium, potassium and chloride (Calibrant
A and B) was previously cleared under k070057.
d. Detection limit:
Glucose:
The Level of Blank (LoB) study was performed using a glucose-depleted serum
sample, run 30 times per day over three days on the Pictus 700 Clinical Chemistry
Analyzer resulting in a LoB of 0 mg/dL.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined to be 0.4 mg/dL using low analyte
sample run 30 times/day over three days. Following CLSI EP17-A, the Limit of
Quantitation (LoQ) was determined to be 7.0 mg/dL.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed to determine the effects from potential
interferents on the Glucose and the ISE assays. Various concentrations of potential
interferents were spiked into two levels, (low and high concentrations) of each
analyte. Testing was performed in duplicate on the Pictus 700 Clinical Chemistry
Analyzer. Six levels of each interferent were tested for each analyte. The sponsor
states that interference is considered to be non-significant if the bias between the
tested and control samples are within +/-10%. The highest concentration tested that
shows non-significant interference are summarized below:
Reagent Hemoglobin Triglycerides Bilirubin
Glucose 600 mg/dL 700 mg/dL 12 mg/dL
Sodium 600 mg/dL 2500 mg/dL 24 mg/dL
Potassium * 2500 mg/dL 24 mg/dL
Chloride 600 mg/dL 2500 mg/dL 24 mg/dL
*Do not use hemolyzed samples
The labeling for the ISE Reagent Pack includes the statement:
“Hemolyzed samples should not be used with sodium, potassium and chloride
assays.”
The sponsor also references the literature in their labeling:
“Young, D.S. et al, Clin. Chem 21: ID (1975) for drugs and substances that may
affect the accuracy of these methods.”
