H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only.
The ARCHITECT Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ARCHITECT
ROMA) is a qualitative serum test that combines the results of the
ARCHITECT HE4, ARCHITECT CA 125 II and menopausal status into a
numerical score.
ARCHITECT ROMA is intended to aid in assessing whether a premenopausal or
postmenopausal woman who presents with an ovarian adnexal mass is at high or
low likelihood of finding malignancy on surgery. ARCHITECT ROMA is
indicated for women who meet the following criteria: over age 18; ovarian
adnexal mass present for which surgery is planned, and not yet referred to an
oncologist. ARCHITECT ROMA must be interpreted in conjunction with an
independent clinical and radiological assessment. The test is not intended as a
screening or stand-alone diagnostic assay.
PRECAUTION: ARCHITECT ROMA should not be used without an
independent clinical/radiological evaluation and is not intended to be a screening
test or to determine whether a patient should proceed to surgery. Incorrect use of
ARCHITECT ROMA carries the risk of unnecessary testing, surgery, and/or
delayed diagnosis.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
ARCHITECT i2000SR system
I. Device Description:
The ARCHITECT ROMA is a qualitative serum test that combines the results of two
analytes, HE4 (ARCHITEC HE4) and CA 125 (ARCHITECT CA 125II) and
menopausal status into a numerical score between 0.0 and 10.0. The premenopausal
or postmenopausal status must be based on ovarian function determined with
information available from clinical evaluation and medical history.
The test system consists of the ARCHITECT HE4 assay, the ARCHITECT CA 125 II
2

--- Page 3 ---
assay and the ARCHITECT i2000SR. The ARCHITECT i2000SR is capable of
calculating the ARCHITECT ROMA score. The immunoassays are performed
according to the directions detailed in each product insert.
Both ARCHITECT HE4 and ARCHITECT CA 125 II are previously cleared devices,
K093957 and K042731, respectively. The ARCHITECT HE4 assay is a
chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) for the quantitative
determination of HE4 antigen in human serum. The assay is to be used as an aid in
monitoring recurrence or progressive disease in patients with epithelial ovarian
cancer. Serial testing for patient HE4 assay values should be used in conjunction
with other clinical methods used for monitoring ovarian cancer. ARCHITECT CA
125 II assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) for the
quantitative determination of CA 125 reactive determinants in human serum and
plasma on the ARCHITECT i System and was previously cleared as an aid in
monitoring response to therapy for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.
Using an algorithm and the value of the two analytes, ARCHITECT ROMA scores
(numerical score from 0.0–10.0) for both premenopausal and postmenopausal will be
calculated and indicate a low likelihood or high likelihood for finding malignancy on
surgery.

Guidance document entitled Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Ovarian
Adnexal Mass Assessment Score Test System
L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT HE4 assay is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative
determination of HE4 antigen in human serum using chemiluminescent microparticle
immunoassay (CMIA) technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as
Chemiflex. In the first step, sample and anti-HE4 coated paramagnetic microparticles
are combined. HE4 antigen present in the sample binds to the anti-HE4 coated
microparticles. After washing, acridinium-labeled anti-HE4 conjugate is added.
Following another wash cycle, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the
reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative
light units (RLUs). A direct relationship exists between the amount of HE4 antigen
in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT i System optics.
The ARCHITECT CA 125 II assay is a two-step sandwich technique immunoassay to
determine the presence of OC 125 defined antigen in human serum and plasma using
CMIA technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex. In the first
step of the assay, sample and antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-OC 125) coated
paramagnetic microparticles are combined. CA 125 reactive determinants present in
the sample bind to the antibody coated microparticles. After washing, a second
acridinium-labeled antibody conjugate is added in the second step. Pre-Trigger and
Trigger Solutions are then added to the reaction mixture; the resulting
chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). A direct
relationship exists between the amount of CA 125 reactive determinants in the sample
and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT™ i optical system.
The ARCHITECT i2000SR is capable of calculating the ARCHITECT ROMA score.
Using the value of the two analytes, ARCHITECT ROMA scores (numerical score
from 0.0–10.0) for both premenopausal and postmenopausal will be calculated and
will indicate whether a woman is at low likelihood or high likelihood for finding
malignancy on surgery. Both premenopausal and postmenopausal ARCHITECT
ROMA results will be reported to the ordering physician who will decide which result
to use based on patient's menopausal status.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
Both ARCHITECT HE4 and ARCHITECT CA 125 II are previously cleared
devices. Analytical performance for ARCHITECT HE4 and ARCHITECT CA

--- Page 7 ---
125 II were validated in K093957 and K042731, respectively. There have been
no modifications of assay methods for ARCHITECT HE4 and ARCHITECT CA
125 II since the original clearance for each assay. Thus, a limited study was done
to evaluate the analytical performance of the ARCHITECT ROMA score.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Lot-to-Lot Precision Study: A panel of five serum samples was tested using a
combination of three lots each of ARCHITECT HE4 and ARCHITECT CA
125 II reagents and calibrator kits for a total of four different
reagent/calibrator combinations. Each kit was used according to the package
insert. The panel consisted of human serum samples spiked with OC125
defined antigen and HE4 recombinant antigen. Samples were tested in two
replicates per run, two runs per day for 10 days (n = 40 replicates per sample
per lot).
Premenopausal and postmenopausal ARCHITECT ROMA scores were
calculated using the ARCHITECT ROMA algorithm on-board the
ARCHITECT analyzer utilizing the ARCHITECT System Software Version
9.00 or higher. The first ARCHITECT HE4 replicate and the first
ARCHITECT CA 125 II replicate were used to compute the ARCHITECT
ROMA score using both the premenopausal and postmenopausal algorithms.
The second ARCHITECT HE4 replicate and the second ARCHITECT CA
125 II replicate were used to compute the ARCHITECT ROMA score using
both the premenopausal and postmenopausal algorithms. This same process
was used for calculating the four scores for the second run and subsequent
panel runs on each day of testing. The following table displays the results for
the lot-to-lot precision parameters. All data met the manufacturer’s
predetermined acceptance criteria.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and stability studies for the HE4 and CA 125 assay kits were
presented in K093957 and K042731, respectively. No new traceability and
stability data were presented in this submission.
Each assay uses its own calibrator and controls.
ARCHITECT HE4 Calibrator and Controls: Ig-HE4 is a fusion protein
consisting of a human Fc antibody fragment and Human Epididymis protein
HE4. The Ig-HE4 antigen is used as a calibrator protein in the HE4 assay to
determine HE4 concentrations in human serum samples. The protein is
produced in a stably transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. The
cell line was adapted to serum free growth medium at Fujirebio Diagnostics,
Inc. Recombinant antigen is used to prepare calibrators and controls for
ARCHITECT HE4.
ARCHITECT CA 125 II Calibrator and Controls: The OC125 defined antigen
is used in the ARCHITECT CA 125 II Calibrators and Controls. The
concentrations are specific to each calibrator and control level. This material
is obtained from Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc. proprietary human ovarian
carcinoma cell line, McDonalds. OC 125 defined antigen is produced by the
McDonalds cell line. The stock solution for calibrators is prepared by adding
OC 125 defined antigen to a diluent to achieve the desired concentrations. The
stock solution is tested to determine its actual concentration. Each Calibrator
and Control is then prepared based on the actual concentration of the stock
solution.
Stability:
Specimen: ARCHITECT ROMA is intended for use with serum. The
specimen stability and storage claims are limited to the ARCHITECT HE4
assay. Serum can be stored at 2–8°C for 4 days before being tested. Samples

d. Detection limit:
The limits of detection and limits of quantitation reported in each assay’s
package insert are incorporated into the algorithm such that results outside of
the measuring interval are not imported and do not yield an ARCHITECT
ROMA score.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference: Studies were conducted to evaluate the interference of
ARCHITECT ROMA score by hemoglobin, bilirubin (conjugated and
unconjugated), lipid (triglyceride), rheumatoid factor (RF), and human anti-
mouse antibodies (HAMA). CLSI guideline, EP7-A2 was used to design the
interference experiments. Three pooled serum samples with ARCHITECT
ROMA score at low, medium, and high were used in the studies. These
samples were then supplemented with each interfering substance. The control
samples were prepared without corresponding interfering substance. The
control samples and test samples were tested in replicates of five using
ARCHITECT ROMA. The ARCHITECT ROMA score was calculated for
each sample and its control sample using a mean of five replicates of
ARCHITECT HE4 and the mean of five replicates of ARCHITECT CA 125
II. The effect of each interfering substance on the ARCHITECT ROMA score
was assessed by comparing the measurement of each test sample to the
control. The summary of the results are shown in the following table, and all
data met the manufacturer’s predetermined acceptance criteria.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 188 samples were used for the method comparison study covering
the premenopausal ROMA range 0.1–10.0 and the postmenopausal ROMA
range 0.3–9.8. The enrolled patients consist of 138 diseased patients (78
premenopausal women and 60 postmenopausal woman) and 50 apparently
healthy women (25 premenopausal women and 25 postmenopausal women).
The ARCHITECT CA 125 II assay is used in both the test device and the
predicate, and was performed so that ROMA scores could be calculated, but
the same ARCHITECT CA 125 II assay result was used to calculate the
ROMA scores for both the HE4 EIA and the ARCHITECT HE4 platforms.
This study, therefore, focused on the comparison of the two HE4 platforms.
Data analysis was performed using Deming and Passing-Bablok regression
analysis and all data met the manufacturer’s predetermined acceptance
criteria. The results are summarized in the following table:

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity/Clinical Specificity:
A clinical study was performed to evaluate the performance of ARCHITECT
ROMA in pre- and postmenopausal women presenting to a generalist with an
adnexal mass, for whom a decision to undergo surgery has been made. The
study enrolled 512 patients at the 13 study sites. The patients were female
patients over 18, presenting to a generalist at a general or specialty hospital
with an ovarian cyst or an adnexal mass (defined as a simple, complex or a
solid ovarian/pelvic mass) who were scheduled to undergo surgery. Blood
samples were collected from all patients and tested with ARCHITECT HE4
and ARCHITECT CA 125 II at Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc.
The Initial Cancer Risk Assessment (ICRA) and all clinical information
relating to the surgical procedures, including imaging reports and final
pathology reports, were collected. All patients underwent surgery and tissues
were examined by local pathologists. An independent pathologist reviewed
all imaging reports, case report forms and histopathology reports from each
patient’s institution pathologist, checking for discrepancies in the data. The
performance of standalone use of ICRA, standalone use of ARCHITECT
ROMA and adjunctive use of ICRA and ARCHITECT ROMA were evaluated
by comparing to histopathology results for detecting the presence of ovarian
malignancy.
Of the 512 patients, 53 patients were excluded from analysis. The most
common reason for exclusion was no surgery was performed to remove an
adnexal mass. In the final total of 459 (89.6%) evaluable patients, 250
(54.5%) were premenopausal and 209 (45.5%) were postmenopausal. All of
the major racial groups were represented with 85% of White, 7% of Black,
3% Hispanic, 3% Asian, and 2% of other ethnicity.
The statistics for the 459 enrolled subjects with pathology classification are
summarized in the following table:

The ARCHITECT ROMA test used the following cut points to evaluate the
performance of the test in pre- and postmenopausal women presenting to a
generalist with an adnexal mass, for whom a decision to undergo surgery has
been made:
Premenopausal:
ARCHITECT ROMA score ≥ 1.31: High likelihood of finding malignancy
ARCHITECT ROMA score < 1.31: Low likelihood of finding malignancy
Postmenopausal:
ARCHITECT ROMA score ≥ 2.77: High likelihood of finding malignancy
ARCHITECT ROMA score < 2.77: Low likelihood of finding malignancy
The information provided by the ARCHITECT ROMA test should be used
only as an adjunctive test to complement, not replace, other diagnostic and
clinical procedures. The ability of ARCHITECT ROMA to contribute to the
ICRA was evaluated by comparing the sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) for standalone
use of ARCHITECT ROMA, and adjunctive use of ICRA and ARCHITECT
ROMA for the diagnosis of epithelian ovarian cancer (EOC) including tumors
with low malignant potential (LMP) and all cancers including LMP. The
results were cross-tabulated in a 2x2x2 table of the malignancy as determined
by histopathology, test result (positive or negative) by ICRA, and test result
(positive/high likelihood or negative/low likelihood) by ARCHITECT
ROMA. The results are presented in the tables below.

Combined pre- and postmenopausal subjects:
For diagnosis of EOC including LMP, the counts for combined pre- and
postmenopausal subjects with malignancy by pathology and with no
malignancy by pathology are summarized in separate tables below.

ratio by ICRA alone (4.90). The performance of adjunctive use of
ARCHITECT ROMA and ICRA for diagnosis of EOC including LMP was
further evaluated by calculating sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV and
compared to standalone use of ICRA. The table below shows the
performance characteristics of the tests.

decreased from 84.2% to 75.7%. PPV for the adjunctive use of ICRA and
ARCHITECT ROMA decreased from 46.4% to 39.7% due to an increase in
the number of false positive test added by addition of ARCHITECT ROMA to
ICRA. However, NPV of adjunctive use of ICRA and ARCHITECT ROMA
increased from 95.5% to 97.9%. This observed increase of 2.5% in NPV was
statistically significant.

To demonstrate whether higher ARCHITECT ROMA is associated with an
increased likelihood of cancer, additional analysis was conducted by splitting
the patients at the cut-off point and finding the median ARCHITECT ROMA
score within each split gives two balanced groups below the cutoff and
additional groups above. The results are summarized below.

4. Clinical cut-off:
The following cut-offs are used to interpret the result. The ARCHITECT ROMA
score is between 0.0 and 10.0.
Premenopausal:
ARCHITECT ROMA score ≥ 1.31: High likelihood of finding malignancy
ARCHITECT ROMA score < 1.31: Low likelihood of finding malignancy
Postmenopausal:
ARCHITECT ROMA score ≥ 2.77: High likelihood of finding malignancy
ARCHITECT ROMA score < 2.77: Low likelihood of finding malignancy
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Expected values in healthy women: In order to determine the normal reference
ranges of the ARCHITECT ROMA score in healthy women, 122 premenopausal
samples and 120 postmenopausal samples were tested. Samples covered ages
ranging from 18 to 87 and represented whites (95.0%), African American (3.3%)
and Hispanic (0.1%) and Asian (0.1%) subjects. The results for the ARCHITECT
ROMA score obtained from the pre- and postmenopausal populations are
presented in the tables below:

1Standard deviation
Overall, 95% of the premenopausal healthy women had an ARCHITECT ROMA
score equal to or below 1.65. 95% of the postmenopausal healthy women had a
ARCHITECT ROMA score equal to or below 2.02. It is recommended that each
laboratory establish its own reference value for the population of interest.
Expected values in Non-Ovarian Malignancy Condition:
To evaluate the performance of ARCHITECT ROMA in subjects with other
benign and other malignant conditions, the ARCHITECT ROMA was evaluated
in women with benign conditions (benign gynecological disease, congestive heart
failure (CHF), hypertension, pregnant, and other benign disease) and in women
with other malignant conditions (bladder cancer, breast cancer, endometrial
cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, and lung cancer). 733 samples were analyzed.
The tables below summarize the results analyzed for premenopausal and
postmenopausal samples.
