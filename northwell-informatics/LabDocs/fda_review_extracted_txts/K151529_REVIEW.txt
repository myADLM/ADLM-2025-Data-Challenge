L. Test Principle:
The Dimension Vista LOCI Total Testosterone (TTST) Flex method is a homogeneous,
competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay based on LOCI technology. LOCI reagents
include two synthetic bead reagents and labeled testosterone antibody. The first bead reagent
(Chemibeads) is coated with a testosterone analog and contains a chemiluminescent dye.

The second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitive
dye. Chemibeads and labeled testosterone antibody are added sequentially to the reaction
vessel. Testosterone from the patient sample competes with the testosterone-analog-
chemibeads for a limited amount of labeled testosterone antibody. Sensibeads are then added
and bind to the biotinylated portion of the labeled testosterone antibody to form bead pair
immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex by light at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen
for the Sensibeads which diffuses to the Chemibeads triggering a chemiluminescent reaction.
The resulting signal is measured at 612 nm and is an inverse function of the concentration of
total testosterone in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A2 guidance. Three
serum and one plasma pools, and three levels of human serum based commercial
controls were run using one reagent lot and one analyzer in duplicate, twice a day for
20 days for a total of 80 measurements per sample. A result summary of the precision
study is shown in the table below:
Within-Run Total (n=80)
Sample Mean SD %CV SD %CV
(ng/dL)
Serum 1 13 0.7 5.2 1.0 7.3
Serum 2 75 1.4 1.9 1.6 2.1

Control 2 441 4.1 0.9 5.6 1.3
Control 3 855 13.2 1.6 16.9 2.0
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were performed for serum and Li-heparin, Na-heparin, and K2-
EDTA plasma samples. One high sample and one low pool for each sample type
were combined in varying ratios to produce ten dilutions across the claimed
measuring range of 8.0 to1000 ng/dL. The expected values were calculated based on
the dilution factor used. The following linear regression equations were obtained:

Serum: y=0.97x + 0.1, R2=0.998
Li-Heparin: y= 0.98x + 0.0, R2=0.999
Na-Heparin: y= 0.98x + 0.1, R2=0.996
K2-EDTA: y= 0.96x + 0.1, R2=0.999
The linearity data supports the claimed measuring range of 8.0-1000 ng/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The Dimension Vista Testosterone Calibrator is traceable to a primary
reference method, CDC Reference Method: ID-LC/MS/MS. Traceability was
verified by serum sample method comparison on the Dimension Vista against the
CDC reference method, ID-LC/MS/MS.
The sponsor has obtained certification in the CDC Hormone Standardization (HoST)
program. Please see CDC Hormone Standardization program at
http://www.cdc.gov/labstandards/hs.html.
Value Assignment: Each lot of calibrator is assigned during manufacturing with a
Testosterone Masterpool, which is traceable to CDC ID-LC/MS/MS. The lot value
assignment of the calibrators are determined by measuring 5 replicates of each
calibrator, during 3 runs, over 3 days, using 3 reagent lots and 3 analyzers. The
calibrator results must meet internal specifications before release. The calibrator
target concentrations are as follows:
Level A: 0 ng/dL
Level B: 20 ng/dL
Level C: 50 ng/dL
Level D 100 ng/dL
Level E: 200 ng/dL
Level F: 1100 ng/dL
Stability: Real-time open-vial and shelf-life stability studies were performed to
determine the stability of the Dimension Vista Testosterone Calibrator. The study
protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The
stability studies support the sponsor’s shelf-life stability claim of 12 months when
stored at -15 to -25o C. Once reconstituted, the calibrators are stable for 14 days when
stored on board the Dimension Vista System. Reconstituted calibrators are stable for
30 days when recapped immediately after use and stored at 2-8oC.
The sponsor recommends the use of commercially available control material in the
package insert labeling.

d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB):
The LoB was estimated using a nonparametric approach. Six blank samples
(testosterone stripped serum) were tested on three reagent lots on one analyzer over
three days, for a total of 90 measurements. The LoB for each lot was taken as the
rank position at the 95th percentile calculated from the following equation, Rank
position= 0.5 + 0.95B, where B = total number of replicates. The largest result across
lots was taken as the LoB. The LoB was determined to be 1.1 ng/dL.
Limit of Detection (LoD):
The LoD was calculated parametrically for each of three reagent lots using 8
individual serum samples with low endogenous testosterone (0.6 to 8.5 ng/dL). For
each reagent lot tested, 120 replicate determinations were made over three days.
The LoD was calculated using the following equation: LoD= LoB + c SD where c
p L, p
is a multiplier to give the 95th percentile of a normal distribution and L is the total
number of all low level ample results across all reagent lots. The maximum observed
LoD across all reagent lots was taken as the LoB estimate value. The LoD was
determined to be 2.4 ng/dL.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ):
The LoQ was determined using 8 individual low-level serum samples (0.6-8.5 ng/dL)
and 5 low-level plasma samples for each plasma sample type (Li-Hep, Na-Hep, K2-
EDTA). All sample types were analyzed in duplicate, twice a day for 20 days for a
total of 80 measurements per sample. The LoQ is defined as the lowest analyte
concentration that can be reproducibly measured with a total precision CV of ≤ 20%.
The maximum LoQ for two lots tested for serum was 4.5 ng/dL
The maximum LoQ for the two lots tested for sodium-heparin and lithium-heparin
sample types was 6.0 g/dL; and for the K2- EDTA sample type was 5.0 ng/dL
The sponsor lists the following detection limits in the assay package insert labeling:
LoB LoD LoQ
4.0 ng/dL 5.0 ng/dL 8.0 ng/dL
The claimed measuring range of the assay is 8.0 to 1000 ng/dL
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
The Testosterone assay was evaluated for interference according to CLSI EP7-A2.
Hemolysis, icterus, and lipemia and several specific interferents were tested using a

paired-difference approach. Serum and plasma samples containing the substance to be
tested and control sample not containing the substances were spiked with
approximately 50 and 300 ng/dL of testosterone. Five replicates were tested for each
test and control sample. The sponsor defines significant interference as greater than
10% difference in the test sample results as compared to the control samples. The
results are summarized in the table below:

HAMA interference study:
Human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) interference was evaluated according to
CLSI EP07-A2 guideline. Samples tested consisted of individual human serum
samples with low and high endogenous HAMA. The samples were spiked with two
levels of testosterone, approximately 150 ng/dL and 700-800 ng/dL testosterone. The
sponsor defined significant interference as ≥ ±10% difference between the tested
sample and the control sample. Five replicates were run on each sample. The results
are summarized in the table below:
HAMA Concentration Testosterone Level % Interference
1248 ng/mL 149 ng/dL -4%
285 ng/mL 156 ng/dL -2%
1248 ng/mL 887 ng/dL -6%
285 ng/mL 746 ng/dL -5%
The sponsor includes the following limitation in the labeling regarding heterophilic
antibody (HAMA) interference:
“Patient samples may contain heterophilic antibodies, of which human anti-mouse
antibodies (HAMA) are the most commonly encountered. Heterophilic antibodies
such as HAMA may cause falsely decreased or elevated results in immunoassay tests.
Siemens characterized the impact of HAMA in accordance with CLSI EP7-A2 and
this testing indicated ≤ 10% bias with the TTST assay. While the TTST reagent has
been designed to mitigate interference from heterophilic antibodies, complete
elimination of these interferences from all patient specimens cannot be guaranteed.
A test result that is inconsistent with the patient’s clinical presentation and history
should be interpreted with caution.”
The sponsor includes the following literature references in the labeling regarding
interference from other patient specific interferents such as anti-dextran or anti-
streptavidin antibodies:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was conducted to compare the Dimension Vista TTST
assay to the predicate device, the Roche Elecsys Testosterone II assay. Two-Hundred
and fifteen (215) unaltered patient serum samples were tested using one reagent lot.
The sample results on the candidate device ranged from 11.0 to 982 ng/dL. Passing
Bablok was used to analyze the data and the following regression data was obtained:
y= 0.90x - 2.6, r=0.99
The slope showed an approximate bias of -10% between the candidate device and the
predicate device; however, this shift is expected because the purpose of the device
modification was to adjust the calibration to better align with the CDC reference sample
concentration target levels. Therefore, test results from the candidate device do not, and
are not expected to, directly correlate with test results from the predicate device.
An additional method comparison study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy
between the candidate device and the CDC reference method. The method
comparison against the CDC reference method was the basis of the substantial
equivalence determination.
A method comparison study was performed between the Dimension Vista TTST
assay and the CDC reference method, ID-LC/MS/MS. One hundred thirteen (113)
native serum samples were run in singlet on the candidate and comparator methods.
The test results as measured by the candidate device ranged from 8.0 to 949 ng/dL.
Regression analysis was performed using Passing-Bablok to obtain the following
regression equation:
Slope 95% CI Intercept 95% CI r n
0.93 0.92-0.95 4.0 0.4-5.7 0.994 113
b. Matrix comparison:
Fifty nine sample sets were collected and analyzed by Deming weighted regression to
compare testosterone results obtained from serum to serum collected in a serum
separator tube (SST), Li-Heparin plasma, Na-Heparin plasma, and K2-EDTA plasma.
Results from the serum samples ranged from 12 to 924 ng/dL. The regression
equations are summarized in the following table:
13

[Table 1 on page 13]
Slope	95% CI	Intercept	95% CI	r	n
0.93	0.92-0.95	4.0	0.4-5.7	0.994	113

Na-Hep plasma 0.99 -1.4 0.996
K2-EDTA plasma 1.00 -1.1 0.998
SST serum 0.97 -0.7 0.995
The matrix comparison study results support the use of SST serum, Li-heparin, Na-
heparin, and K2-EDTA plasma with this assay.

b. Clinical specificity:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A reference interval study was performed for the Dimension Vista LOCI Total
Testosterone assay. The sample groups tested consisted of males, > 50 years old
(n=146); males between the ages of 21 to 50 years old (n=174); post-menopausal
females, ages 48 to 85 years (n=146); and pre-menopausal females, ages 21 to 60 years
(n=189). The central 95th percentile range of each sample category was calculated by
finding the 2.5th ranked sample on the low end and the 97.5th ranked sample on the high
end. The follow reference intervals were obtained for each category:
Adult males (21 to 50 yrs): 113 to 1065 ng/dL
Adult males (>50 yrs): 95 to 948 ng/dL
Pre-menopausal females: 9 to 53 ng/dL
