L. Test Principle:
The test is performed as a solid phase immunoassay. Controls, calibrators and patient sera are
incubated in the antigen coated wells to allow specific antibodies present in the serum to bind
to the centromere antigen. Unbound antibodies and other serum proteins are removed by
washing the microwells. Bound antibodies are detected by adding an enzyme labeled anti-
human IgG conjugate to the microwells. Unbound conjugate is removed by washing. Enzyme
substrate (TMB) is then added to the wells and the presence of antibodies is detected by a
color change produced by the conversion of TMB substrate to a colored reaction product.
The reaction is stopped and the intensity of the color change, which is proportional to the
concentration of antibody, is read by a spectrophotometer at 450 nm.
Semi-quantitative results are determined from a series of five calibrators (160 EU/mL, 80
EU/mL, 40 EU/mL, 20 EU/mL, and 1 EU/mL). Values less than 20 EU/mL are considered
negative results while values greater than 25 EU/mL are considered positive; results between
20 EU/mL and 25 EU/mL are considered ‘indeterminate’. Qualitative results are determined
using a ratio of the absorbance of the sample to the absorbance of the cut-off calibrator (20
EU/mL). The ratio is multiplied by the concentration of the cut-off calibrator to give a
numerical value. Values greater than 20 EU/mL are reported as positive.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Semi-Quantitative Precision:
Sera from seven patients from the Intended Use population were selected to cover the
analytical measuring range of the assay and included samples in the negative range,
~20% below cut-off, around the cut-off, ~20% above cut-off and in the moderate
positive range of the assays. Samples were run in duplicate, twice per day for 20 days
(n = 80 replicates per sample). Assays were run by two operators on two different sets
of equipment, each using a multichannel pipettor, microplate washer and microplate
reader. The manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria met for all measures.

High dose hook effect: High concentrations specimens were serially diluted (from
approximated 407 EU/mL) to assess the presence of a decrease in assay signal
associated with antigen excess (hook effect). A hook effect at concentrations up to
407 EU/mL was not seen.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i) Traceability:
There are currently no recognized international standards for the measurement of
anti-centromere antibodies. Calibrator and Control values are directly traceable to in-
house standards.
ii) Value Assignment:
Calibrators and Positive Controls are dilutions of pooled Centromere antibody-
positive sera. The sponsor formulates new calibrator and control lots from an array of
antibody positive sera obtained from commercial plasma centers stored frozen at -
70°C. The calibrators and controls are taken from different pooled sera. All source
sera has been tested and found negative for infectious disease as stated in the product
insert. Manufactured calibrator sets are stored in aliquots frozen at -70°C. As new
lots of calibrators are developed, comparison studies are performed to calibrate values
against original calibrators. Each lot of calibrator is also tested in comparison with
normal human sera, clinical samples and internal standards.
iii) Stability:
Shelf life stability:
Accelerated and open kit studies for each device were performed on three lots of
components/reagents. Accelerated studies were conducted with materials
incubated at 37°C. In these conditions, one day is considered equivalent to one
month stored at 2°–8°C. Materials are removed from the incubator for testing at
three-day intervals for a minimum of 18 days.
Real time stability of three kit lots was tested using five specimens with
reactivities across the analytical measuring range; current results support a six
month shelf life stability claim.

Open Kit Stability:
For open kit stability studies, materials are opened and stored as required for
bench-top usage, then assayed at 15, 45 and 90 day intervals. Open vial stability
studies demonstrate opened reagents are stable at 45 days, but the sponsor chose a
more restrictive one month open kit stability claim.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and the Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined using
60 replicates of the blank and 10 replicates each of 6 low-level (normal human)
samples by following CLSI EP17-A. Sixty samples of diluent were run as blank
samples and six different normal human sera were each assayed 10 times. LoB was
determined to be 3.5 and LoD was determined to be 3.9 EU/ml.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
The studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A2, Interference Testing in
Clinical Chemistry, Approved Guideline- Second Edition. Interference was studied by
mixing sera with known Centromere antibody levels with serum samples containing
potentially interfering substances and studying deviation from expected results.
Samples were selected from the negative range, near the assay cutoff and in the low,
moderate and high positive range less than the value of the top calibrator. No
significant interference (defined as > 15% deviation from expected) was
demonstrated in the Centromere assay for the following substances at the levels
indicated: Hemoglobin (2 g/L), Bilirubin (342 μmol/L), Rheumatoid Factor (100
EU/mL), Triglycerides (37 mmol/L) and Cholesterol (13 mmol/L).
Comparison to Reference Sera:
Twelve ANA human reference sera from the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention were tested with the ImmuLisa Centromere Antibody ELISA. As
expected, the CDC sample known to contain anti-Centromere antibodies tested
strongly positive. The eleven other samples were negative. The other samples
represent other ANA-type antigens such as SS-A, SS-B, Jo-1, etc.
Ten ANA human reference sera from the Association of Medical Laboratory
Immunologists were tested with the ImmuLisa Centromere Antibody ELISA. As
expected, the AMLI sample known to contain anti-Centromere antibodies tested
strongly positive. The nine other samples were negative. The other samples represent
other ANA-type antigens such as SS-A, SS-B, Jo-1, etc.
f. Assay Cut-off:
Positive assay cut-offs were assigned a unit values of 25 EU/mL for the semi-
quantitative method and 20 EU/mL for the qualitative method, based on the
standardized method used by other IMMCO products. Indeterminate/borderline
results (defined as 20–25 EU/mL) for the semi-quantitative method, are
8

--- Page 9 ---
recommended to be retested and evaluated along with other laboratory methods for
detection of antibodies to ENA.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed with the QUANTA Lite™ Centromere
ELISA kit, using 119 samples from patients with limited system sclerosis (LcSSc)/
CREST Syndrome (SSc)] and 288 disease controls. Sample values were within the
analytical measuring range for the device. Performance relative to the predicate was
determined by calculating agreement where borderline values were considered
positive or negative. Qualitative results were the same as those obtained when semi-
quantitative indeterminate values are considered positive.

a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
The clinical sensitivity and specificity of the IMMCO Centromere assay was
evaluated in 989 serum samples representing various autoimmune and infectious
conditions; the performance was assessed against the clinical diagnosis. Borderline
results were considered positive and negative for these analyses. When results were
calculated by the qualitative method, sensitivity and specificity are identical to the
semi-quantitative results when borderline results are considered positive.

4. Expected values/Reference range:
Test results in a normal population are expected to be negative. A study of 117 normal,
apparently disease-free samples tested with the anti-Centromere assay yielded no
borderline results (0.0%) and no positive results (0.0%).
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
