I. Device Description:
The Xpert TV Assay is an automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in vitro
diagnostic test for qualitative detection of genomic DNA from Trichomonas vaginalis. The
Xpert TV Assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of trichomoniasis.
The Xpert TV Assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert® Instrument Systems
(GeneXpert Dx, GeneXpert Infinity-48, GeneXpert Infinity-48s, and GeneXpert Infinity-80
systems). The GeneXpert Instrument System consists of an instrument, personal computer,
and preloaded software for running tests and viewing the results. The GeneXpert Instrument
System requires single-use, disposable cartridges (the Xpert TV cartridges) that hold the PCR
reagents and host the PCR process. The cartridges are self-contained, so specimens never
come into contact with the working parts of the instrument.
A Sample Processing Control (SPC), Sample Adequacy Control (SAC), and a Probe Check
Control (PCC) are controls utilized by the GeneXpert Instrument System. The SPC is present
to control for adequate processing of the target trichomonads and to monitor the presence of
inhibitors in the real-time PCR reaction to reduce the possibility of false negative results. The
SAC reagents detect the presence of a single copy human gene and monitor whether the
specimen contains human cells. The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, real-time PCR tube
filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability.
The ancillary specimen collection kits for use with the Xpert TV Assay are the Cepheid
Xpert Vaginal/Endocervical Specimen Collection Kit and the Cepheid Xpert Urine Specimen
Collection Kit. The swab and/or urine specimens are collected from asymptomatic or
symptomatic patients and placed into a specimen transport tube containing preservative.
After transferring the specimen to the sample chamber of the Xpert TV cartridge, the user
initiates a test, and places the cartridge into the GeneXpert Instrument System. Results are
automatically generated by the instrument at the end of the process in a report that can be
viewed and printed.

L. Test Principle:
This is a nucleic acid based test using real-time PCR. T. vaginalis is detected through the use of
real-time PCR to amplify and detect TV DNA. Genomic TV DNA is amplified and detected
using a sequence-specific probe that is cleaved during PCR amplification, resulting in a signal
that occurs when the fluorescent reporter dye is released from the quencher.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility
A panel of 8 specimens with varying concentrations of TV (ATCC 30001) was tested on twelve
non-consecutive days by two different operators, at each of three sites (8 specimens x 2 operators
x 2 runs per day x 12 days x 3 sites = 1152 measurements total). Two runs were performed per
day by each of the 6 study operators (12 days x 2 runs per day = 24 runs per operator). Each site
used a different GeneXpert Instrument (running the same analytical software) for the analysis.
Site 1 used an Infinity-80 instrument. Sites 2 and 3 used GeneXpert Dx instruments. The
specimen panel was prepared in clinical matrix (either pooled vaginal swabs or urine in their
respective Cepheid transport reagent). The panel consisted of four concentration levels per
matrix: a high negative sample with an analyte concentration below the limit of detection (LoD),
an LoD sample with an analyte concentration of 1X LoD, a moderate positive sample with an
analyte concentration of 3X LoD, and a negative sample which was comprised of matrix only.
Three lots of Xpert TV Assay cartridges were used at each of the 3 testing sites, with each lot
being used for 4 days of testing. One TV positive and one negative control were tested daily
prior to testing the panel specimens (inactivated TV ATCC 30001 and human A549 cells in
Cepheid Swab Transport Reagent, respectively). Results are presented in Table 1.

The data presented in Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate good reproducibility for the Xpert TV Assay
on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems. The assay shows ≥ 88.8% detection of TV in LoD
samples diluted in pooled vaginal swab and urine matrix (detection in LoD samples is 93.1% if
operator 1 from site 1 is excluded). Due to the relatively low LoD concentrations of TV analyte,
it is believed that small variations in sample aliquots contributed to detection levels below the
anticipated 95%.
Detection of TV was 100% for moderate positive samples diluted in pooled vaginal swab and
urine matrix. Detection was ≤ 76.4% for the high negative samples, which is acceptable and
typical for real-time PCR assays.
Agreement between all operators was evaluated using Fisher’s Exact test to assess operator
performance. No statistically significant differences were observed for any of the specimens
(including the Urine LoD sample; p-value =0.061). Therefore, the operator performance was
deemed acceptable. Detection was ≤ 76.4% for the high negative samples, which is acceptable
and typical for real-time PCR assays.

Instrument Precision
An in-house precision study was conducted to compare the performance of the GeneXpert Dx and
the GeneXpert Infinity Instrument Systems. A panel of 8 specimens with varying concentrations of
TV was tested on 12 different days by two operators. Each operator conducted four runs of the
specimen panel per day on three different instruments (8 specimens x 12 days x 2 operators x 4 runs
per day x 3 instrument systems = 2304 measurements total). The three instruments included in this
study were the GeneXpert Dx, the Infinity-48, and the Infinity-80 (running the same analytical
software). Three lots of Xpert TV Assay cartridges were used for the study, each lot used for 4
days of testing. One TV positive and one negative control were tested daily prior to testing the
panel specimens (inactivated TV ATCC 30001 and human A549 cells in Cepheid Swab
Transport Reagent, respectively). Results are summarized in Table 3.

lots of these controls were tested in replicates of six (positive external control) or four (negative
external control). Of the 33 runs, all 18 runs with positive controls were reported as “TV
DETECTED” by the Xpert TV Assay. Of the 12 runs with negative controls, 11 were reported as
“TV NOT DETECTED” and one provided an indeterminate GeneXpert result (ERROR). To
verify that N. gonorrhoeae cells were present in the three negative control lots tested, a single
sample from each of the lots was taken tested in triplicate using the Xpert CT/NG Assay. All
three runs were reported as “CT NOT DETECTED, NG DETECTED.” These results indicate
that the external controls gave the expected results using the Xpert TV Assay.
Internal Controls
The Xpert TV Assay includes the following internal controls: Sample Adequacy Control (SAC),
Sample Processing Control (SPC), and the Probe Check Control (PCC).
1. Sample Adequacy Control (SAC): The SAC verifies that human DNA is present in the
sample, indicating that sample collection was adequate. Test results are reported as
“INVALID” if the SAC fails to meet the valid minimum or maximum Ct specification
(range 9-45 Ct). Examination of all SAC values obtained from samples tested in the
clinical study indicated that, out of 5391 total runs for eligible specimens, two samples
(0.037%) received a GeneXpert result of “INVALID.” Both were due to SAC failure. In
addition, examination of the SAC Ct values of the 4744 samples that were negative
relative to the patient infected status, indicated that none of the Ct values obtained from
clinical samples with valid Xpert TV Assay results approached the SAC maximum cycle
cut-off of Ct 45. This data indicates that the Ct range for the SAC is appropriate and that
the SAC functions as an adequate control for sample adequacy.
2. Sample Processing Control (SPC): The SPC bead contains genomic DNA of Bacillus
globigii that is included in each cartridge to verify adequate processing of the sample.
The SPC is processed with the sample and verifies the effectiveness of each sample
preparation step including; binding and elution of DNA, correct reaction tube filling,
PCR components are present and functioning, and monitors the presence of potential
inhibitor(s) in the real-time PCR assay. Test results are reported as “INVALID” if the
SPC fails to meet the valid minimum or maximum Ct specification (range 9-45 Ct). From
5391 eligible samples tested during the clinical study, zero “INVALID” GeneXpert
results were due to an SPC failure alone and zero “INVALID” GeneXpert results were
caused by failure of both the SAC and SPC. In addition, examination of the SPC Ct
values of the 4744 samples that were negative relative to the patient infected status,
indicated that none of the Ct values obtained from clinical samples with valid Xpert TV
Assay results approached the SPC maximum cycle cut-off of Ct 45. This data indicates
that the Ct range for the SPC is appropriate and that the SPC functions as an adequate
control to monitor nucleic acid extraction and amplification.
3. Probe Check Control (PCC): After sample preparation, bead reconstitution, and reaction
tube filling, but prior to thermal cycling, the GeneXpert Instrument System is
programmed to perform a probe check on the amplification mixture. The PCC verifies
reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability.
The PCC is considered to PASS if the fluorescence generated meets the validated
acceptance criteria. If the PCC fails for the TV target or the SAC and SPC controls, a
12

--- Page 13 ---
probe check error is reported and the test will not continue. If a probe check error is
reported, the test may be repeated using a new sample, a new cartridge, and new reagents.
During clinical testing, one test result was reported as “ERROR” due to a PCC failure out
of 5391 total runs for eligible specimens (0.02%).
Shipping and Storage Stability
The conditions claimed for specimen transport and storage were evaluated for first-catch urine,
endocervical swabs, and patient-collected vaginal swabs (collected in a clinical setting). Cultured
and titered TV cells (strain ATCC 30001) were spiked into pooled negative urine or swab
specimens (in their respective Cepheid transport reagent) at a concentration of 3X LoD. One TV
positive and one negative control were tested daily (inactivated TV ATCC 30001 and human
A549 cells in Cepheid Swab Transport Reagent, respectively). The data for this study was
collected with the GenXpert Dx (GX-IV and GX-XVI) Instrument. For the TV positive samples,
replicates of 16 were tested at t = 0 and replicates of 8 were tested at all other time and
temperature combinations. For the TV negative samples (matrix only), replicates of 8 were tested
at t = 0 and replicates of 4 were tested at all other time and temperature combinations.
• Pooled negative urine in Cepheid transport reagent was stored at 2°C and 8°C and tested at
selected time points up to 61 days (t = 0, 7, 14, 28, 42, and 61 days), or stored at 15°C and
30°C and tested at selected time points up to 28 days (t = 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days).
• Pooled unpreserved urine was stored at 2°C and 8°C, and tested at selected time points up to
7 days (t = 0, 1, 4, and 7 days), or stored at 15°C and 30°C, and tested at selected time points
up to 7 hours ( t = 0, 2, 4, and 7 hours).
• Pooled vaginal or endocervical swabs stored in Cepheid transport reagent were stored at 2°C
and 30°C and tested at selected time points up to 61 days (t = 0, 14, 28, and 61 days).
The results of this study support the following claims for specimen shipping and storage:
• Female urine in Xpert Urine Transport Reagent refrigerated at 2-8°C for 28 days or at 15-
30°C (room temperature) for 14 days.
• Vaginal and endocervical swabs in Xpert Swab Transport Reagent at 2-30°C for 60 days.
• Female urine neat (no preservative) refrigerated at 2-8°C for 4 days or at 15-30°C for 4
hours.
Specimen Stability – Cartridge Hold Time Study
If an Xpert cartridge is loaded onto a fully loaded GeneXpert Infinity Instrument, samples may
wait up to two hours before a GenXpert module becomes available. During this wait time, the
assay target organisms and human cells may degrade or become unstable, resulting in a low
positive (“NEGATIVE”) or invalid (SAC Ct not within the valid range) result.
The cartridge hold time study was conducted to determine the acceptable maximum hold time for
Xpert TV Assay cartridges held on the GeneXpert Infinity System. Cultured and titered TV cells
(strain ATCC 30001) and human A549 cells were spiked into pooled negative urine or vaginal
swab specimens (in their respective Cepheid transport reagent) at a concentration of 3X LoD and
as a 10X high positive cell mix, respectively. Samples loaded into Xpert TV cartridges were
13

--- Page 14 ---
tested after incubation for 1, 4, or 5 hours at ambient conditions (room temperature and ambient
humidity), high humidity (25°C and 75% relative humidity), and at high temperature (35°C and
ambient humidity). Replicates of 8 positive and 8 negative samples (human A549 cells and
matrix only) were tested at each of the time and temperature combinations. One TV positive and
one negative control were tested daily (inactivated TV ATCC 30001 and human A549 cells,
respectively). The data for this study was collected with the GenXpert Dx (GX-IV and GX-XVI)
Instruments. Xpert TV Assay cartridges were held at three storage conditions (room temperature,
25°C/75% relative humidity, and 35°C) and tested at t = 0, 1, 4, and 5 hours. Positive and
negative samples were tested in replicates of eight.
The results of this study support the following claims for on-board specimen storage:
• Urine and swabs in Cepheid transport reagent loaded into Xpert TV cartridges can be
stored on-board the GeneXpert Infinity for up to 4 hours prior to testing with the Xpert
TV Assay.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection (LoD)
LoD was established using two TV strains, one metronidazole sensitive (ATCC 30001) and one
metronidazole resistant (ATCC 30238) diluted into negative clinical matrix (either pooled vaginal
swabs or urine in their respective Cepheid transport reagent). The LoD is defined as the lowest
concentration (expressed as number of cells per milliliter; cells/ml) per sample that can be
reproducibly distinguished from negative samples with 95% confidence or the lowest concentration
at which 19 of 20 replicates were positive. Each strain was initially tested in a range finding study at
5 different concentrations in replicates of 20 per concentration of TV. Testing was performed with
two lots of reagents across three testing days. One TV positive and one negative control were
tested daily (inactivated TV ATCC 30001 and human A549 cells in Cepheid Swab Transport
Reagent, respectively). The data for this study was collected with the GenXpert Dx (GX-IV and
GX-XVI) and the GeneXpert Infinity-80 Instruments. The results of the LoD range finding study
are shown in Tables 5 to 8 below.

Table 8. Concentrations of TV ATCC 30001 Tested in Vaginal Swabs
For each TV strain, the LoD estimate selected for verification was the highest value determined from
the two lots. Verification of the estimated LoD claim was performed on one reagent lot across three
testing days using 20 replicates per strain. The LoD was determined empirically as the lowest
concentration that had 20/20 positive results. In addition to the empirical determination of LoD,
Cepheid also conducted Probit analyses and the results were identical. One TV positive and one
negative control were tested daily (inactivated TV ATCC 30001 and human A549 cells in
16

Cepheid Swab Transport Reagent, respectively). The data for this study was collected with the
GenXpert Dx (GX-IV and GX-XVI) and the GeneXpert Infinity-80 Instruments. The LoD point
values for each strain tested are summarized in Table 9 below.

The results of the LoD verification study indicate that the LoD for TV strains ATCC 30001 and
ATCC 30238 in vaginal swab matrix is 2 cells/mL and that the LoD for TV strain ATCC 30001 in
urine matrix is 3 cells/mL. The claimed LoD for TV strain ATCC 30238 in urine matrix is 2
cells/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Inclusivity
An inclusivity study was conducted to test reactivity of the Xpert TV Assay with 17 strains of
TV, tested at a concentration of 3X LoD. The TV isolates were obtained from ATCC. TV cells
were diluted into negative clinical matrix (either pooled vaginal swabs or urine in their respective
Cepheid transport reagent). One TV positive and one negative control were tested daily
(inactivated TV ATCC 30001 and human A549 cells in Cepheid Swab Transport Reagent,
respectively). The data for this study was collected with the GenXpert Infinity-80 Instrument.

Microbial Interference (Cross-Reactivity and Competitive Interference)
This study was conducted to evaluate interference in the Xpert TV Assay when non-target
organisms are present at high concentrations. A panel of 124 microorganisms (5 viruses, 6
yeasts, 6 protozoans, and 107 bacteria) representing pathogens or flora commonly present in the
urogenital system were evaluated. Each bacterial or fungal strain was tested at 1 x 106 CFU/mL
or greater or at 1 x 106 genomes/mL. Viral strains were tested at 1 x 105 U/mL or 105
genomes/mL or greater. Protozoans were cultured in growth media, visually enumerated by light
microscopy and tested at 1 x 105 cells/mL or greater or 105 genomes/mL. All microorganisms
were tested in triplicate in the presence (competitive interference) and absence (cross-reactivity)
of TV (ATCC 3001) at 3X LoD. All microorganisms tested were diluted into negative clinical
matrix (either pooled vaginal swabs or urine in their respective Cepheid transport reagent).
One TV positive and one negative control were tested daily (inactivated TV ATCC 30001 and
human A549 cells in Cepheid Swab Transport Reagent, respectively). The data for this study was
collected with the GenXpert Dx (GX-IV) Instrument.
One organism, Trichomonas tenax, demonstrated cross-reactivity (result of TV DETECTED in
the absence of TV) at 1 x 105 cells/mL for the urine and vaginal swab matrix samples. This
microorganism was subjected to repeat analysis at various other concentrations until a result of
TV NOT DETECTED was obtained (at 1 x 102 cells/mL). For the other 123 microorganisms, all
TV positive samples remained positive and all TV negative samples remained negative, indicating
that there was no interference or cross-reactivity with the results of the Xpert TV Assay for these
microbes. Results are summarized in Tables 11 and 12 for urine and vaginal swab matrix,
respectively.

Additional three microorganisms, Dientamoeba fragilis, Agrobacterium radiobacter, and
Erwinia herbicola, were not available for direct testing. An in silico analysis was conducted
using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) to compare the Xpert TV Assay primer
and probe sequences with all available sequences associated with these three microorganisms in
the GenBank database. Available sequence data for D. fragilis was examined and showed a
maximum of 7% homology to the Xpert TV primer and probe sequences. Available sequence
data for A. radiobacter was examined and showed a maximum of 38% homology to the Xpert
TV primer and probe sequences. Available sequence data for E. herbicola was examined and
showed a maximum of 10% homology to the Xpert TV primer and probe sequences. Results are
shown in Table 13.

Potentially Interfering Substances
An interfering substances study was carried out to examine if substances or conditions that may
be present in urine or vaginal swab specimens could affect the performance of the Xpert TV
Assay. The panel consisted of endogenous substances such as blood, mucin, and leukocytes, and
medications (prescription and over-the-counter) that could be used to treat urogenital conditions.
Eight replicates were tested for each interfering substance. All substances were tested in the
presence (interference) and absence (cross-reactivity) of TV (ATCC 3001) at 3X LoD.
Substances were diluted in negative clinical matrix (either pooled vaginal swabs or urine in their
respective Cepheid transport reagent) as appropriate. One TV positive and one negative control
were tested daily (inactivated TV ATCC 30001 and human A549 cells in Cepheid Swab Transport
Reagent, respectively). The data for this study was collected with the GeneXpert Dx (GX-IV and
GX-XVI) Instrument.
One substance, blood at > 60% v/v demonstrated interference (result of TV NOT DETECTED in

the presence of TV) in the vaginal swab matrix samples. This substance (blood) was subjected to
repeat analysis at various other concentrations until a result of TV DETECTED was obtained
(50% v/v). For the other conditions and substances tested, all TV positive samples remained
positive and all TV negative samples remained negative, indicating that there was no interference
or cross-reactivity with the results of the Xpert TV Assay for these microbes. Results are
summarized in Tables 14 and 15 for urine and vaginal swab matrix, respectively.

a. In tests with substances diluted into pooled T. vaginalis-positive swab matrix, assay interference was observed in
tests with blood at 60% v/v. No assay interference was observed in tests with blood at 50% v/v. This is
addressed in the labeling Section 14, Limitations.
Carry-Over
The purpose of the carry-over study was to uncover the presence of contamination in negative
specimens due to carry-over of TV during nucleic acid extraction and amplification in the
GeneXpert cartridge. The study was conducted over six days (not necessarily consecutive) on
two modules using the same GeneXpert Dx Instrument (GX-IV). Twenty high positive samples
were tested per module and 21 negative samples were tested per module. Two modules were
used in the study for a total of 40 positive samples and 42 negative samples tested in the study.
Negative samples consisted of pooled vaginal swab specimens in Cepheid Swab Transport
Reagent and high positive samples consisted of1 X 106 cells/mL of TV ATCC 3001 in vaginal
swab in Cepheid Swab Transport Reagent. High positive samples were alternated with negative
samples. One TV positive and one negative control were tested daily (inactivated TV ATCC
30001 and human A549 cells in Cepheid Swab Transport Reagent, respectively). All 42 replicates
of negative sample were reported as “TV NOT DETECTED,” therefore, no evidence of carry-
over was observed.
f. Assay cut-off:
Pre-clinical testing data generated with 309 prospectively collected clinical female samples
(collected from 105 subjects, providing urine, endocervical swabs, and/or vaginal swab samples)
was used to determine the valid minimum and maximum cycle threshold settings for TV. The
results of this preliminary study indicated that the valid minimum cycle threshold setting for TV
was 9 and the valid maximum cycle threshold setting for TV was 45.
These assay cut-offs were subsequently validated in the clinical study. For each specimen type,
an analysis of receiver operator curves (ROCs) was conducted for the Xpert TV Assay results
versus patient infected status (PIS) to confirm that the correct cut-off was chosen to optimize
both sensitivity and specificity. The Youden’s Index and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) were
used to make the final decision because the cut-off that maximizes the Youden’s index will give
the optimal results in terms of sensitivity and specificity and the AUC gives an indication of how
well the assay performs. In this study, all AUC statistics were greater than or equal to 98% and
the Youden Index value was the highest at the chosen cut-off of 45 Ct.

The minimum and maximum Ct values observed for TV in the clinical study were 12 and 43.7,
respectively. These values were within the valid minimum and maximum cycle threshold ranges
described above. Taken together with the ROC analysis, these results indicate that the cut-off
values selected for detection of TV with the Xpert Assay are appropriate.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison was based on the results from the Cepheid Xpert TV Assay on the
GeneXpert Instrument Systems compared to the patient infected status (PIS) obtained
from an FDA cleared NAAT assay and TV culture for all female specimen types
(endocervical swabs, patient-collected vaginal swabs, and urine). The testing description
and data are listed below in the Clinical Studies section.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity
Specimen collection was conducted at 17 geographically diverse locations in the United States.
Sites included (but were not limited to) OB/GYN, sexually transmitted disease (STD), and
family planning clinics. Testing was conducted at 11 locations that represented the intended use
sites for the Xpert TV Assay. For sites performing the Xpert TV Assay, positive and negative
external controls (inactivated TV ATCC 30001 and human A549 cells in Cepheid Swab Transport
Reagent, respectively) were tested with the assay on each day of testing. One testing site used a
GeneXpert Infinity-80 Instrument. All other testing sites used the GeneXpert Dx Instrument (IV
or XVI).
For each specimen type, results of the Xpert TV Assay were compared to a patient infected
status (PIS) algorithm comprised of an FDA cleared NAAT test and culture. A specimen was
called positive for PIS if either of the reference test results were positive. A specimen was called
negative for PIS if both of the reference test results were negative. Specimens were collected in
the following order: urine, vaginal swabs (patient-collected first then clinician-collected second),
and endocervical swabs. Samples collected and tested on the Xpert TV Assay included first-
catch urine, patient-collected vaginal swabs (collected in a clinical setting), and endocervical
swabs. Two clinician-collected vaginal swabs were collected and used for reference testing.
Three endocervical swabs were collected (two for reference testing and one for testing with the
Xpert TV Assay). Study subjects were instructed to collect first-catch urine which was used for
reference testing and testing with the Xpert TV Assay. Urine was collected from study subjects
who had not urinated at least one hour prior to specimen collection.

Study participants were included in the study if they could provide informed consent, were
sexually active, and were ≥ 14 years of age. Subjects were excluded from the study if they had
been previously enrolled, received antimicrobial treatment within the previous 21 days, or had a
history of hysterectomy (partial or complete removal of the cervix). The mean age of eligible
study participants was 33.5 years (Range = 18 to 78 years old). A total of 1867 eligible female
subjects were enrolled in the study. Of the 5383 valid Xpert TV Assay results (1799 endocervical
swabs, 1791 vaginal swabs, and 1793 urine), 85 had initial ERROR, INVALID, or NO RESULT
outcomes (1.58%; 95% CI 1.26-1.95). Upon retest, 77 of these specimens had valid results that
were included in the final dataset used for the analyses and eight specimens had indeterminate
results. These 8 specimens with indeterminate results were otherwise eligible specimens so were
included in the calculation of indeterminate rate/assay success rate. The overall valid reporting
rate for the assay was 99.9% (5383/5391). Specimens with discrepant results between the Xpert
TV Assay and the PIS were analyzed by validated bi-directional Sanger sequencing and results
are footnoted in Table 6 for informational purposes only.
For all three specimen types, there were no statistically significant differences between
symptomatic and asymptomatic women for the performance of the Xpert TV Assay. Results
from the clinical study are provided in Table 16.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
During the clinical evaluation of the Xpert TV Assay, the observed prevalence of TV infection in
females was 10.3%. The estimated positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value
(NPV) of the Xpert TV Assay across different hypothetical prevalence rates are shown for each
specimen type in Table 17. These calculations are based on the overall estimated sensitivity and
specificity observed for each specimen type during the Xpert TV multi-center clinical study
(Table 16). The overall sensitivity and specificity for female urine (UR) were 98.4% and 99.7%,
respectively. In patient-collected vaginal swab specimens (PC-VS), the overall sensitivity and
specificity were 96.4% and 99.6%, respectively. For endocervical swabs (ES), the overall
sensitivity and specificity were 98.9% and 98.9%, respectively.
