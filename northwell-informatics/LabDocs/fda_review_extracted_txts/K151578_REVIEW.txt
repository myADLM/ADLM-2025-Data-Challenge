L. Test Principle:
The Carbamazepine Generation 4 assay is for the quantitative determination of
carbamazepine in human serum or plasma on automated clinical chemistry analyzers. It is a
homogeneous microparticle agglutination immunoassay based on the kinetic interaction of
microparticles in solution. Biotinylated drug hapten serves as the binding partner to anti-
carbamazepine antibody and streptavidin coated latex beads. A competitive reaction to a
limited amount of specific anti-carbamazepine antibody takes place between the hapten and
free carbamazepine in the sample. A decrease in the apparent signal produced by the
microparticle agglutination is proportional to the amount of drug present in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated following the CLSI EP5-A2 guidance. A total of 8 samples,
5 human serum samples and 3 control samples, were tested at five and three
carbamazepine levels, respectively. Testing was performed at one site on a cobas c
501 clinical chemistry analyzer using three lots of reagent. Each carbamazepine
sample was assayed in replicates of two, twice a day for 21 days and n=84. The
mean, within-run and total-run SD, and within-run and total-run %CV were
calculated. The results obtained are as shown in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed assay range is 2.0 to 20 µg/mL. To evaluate linearity, a series of
carbamazepine concentrations in serum and plasma were prepared by diluting the
high concentration serum and plasma pool with analyte free serum to obtain 11 levels
spanning the assay range, in accordance with CLSI EP6-A. Serum carbamazepine
concentrations ranged from 2.32. to 21.9 µg/mL, and plasma carbamazepine
concentrations ranged from 2.09 to 21.1 µg/mL. In addition, values slightly outside
the measuring range of 2 - 20 µg/mL were used per CLSI EP6-A. Three replicates
were measured for each concentration and the mean of the measured concentration
was compared with its expected concentration. The expected concentration was
based on dilutions of the high sample concentration sample. The concentration of the
high sample was determined by chromatographic testing traceable to purified
carbamazepine.
The linear regression results using the sample concentrations listed above were:
Sample Type Slope Intercept R
Serum 1.000 0 0.997
Plasma 1.013 -0.195 0.999
This evaluation supports linearity across the claimed measuring range of 2.0 to 20.0
ug/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators were previously cleared under k031856. See k031856 for traceability,
stability, and expected values information on calibrators.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical sensitivities were determined following CLSI EP17-A2 guidelines. LoB
was determined using 0.9% saline with 3 lots of reagent on cobas c 501 analyzer in 2
runs per day for 3 days, and 10 replicates per run. LoD was determined using 6
serum samples spiked with carbamazepine levels ranging from LoB to approximately
4 times specified LoB (n=60). For limit of quantitation (LoQ), nine serum samples
that cover the range between LoB and 2x LoQ were prepared. All samples were
measured in replicates of 4 using three reagent lots over a period of 3 days. LoQ is
defined as the lowest analyte concentration where %Total Error is ≤20%.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference by metabolites, drugs, and endogenous compounds was tested by spiking
the potential interferents into human serum containing carbamazepine at
concentrations of 3 and 12 µg/mL on a cobas c 501 analyzer. Corresponding control
samples were prepared by adding the equal volume of solvent that was in the stock
solution of the compound tested. Samples were measured in duplicate by the
carbamazepine assay. The compounds listed below did not interfere at the
concentrations shown below in the table. Recoveries were all within ± 10% of
expected.

b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison studies were performed to evaluate the performance of the
following: serum gel separation tube, K2-EDTA plasma, K3-EDTA plasma, Li-
Heparin plasma, Na-Heparin plasma compared to the control matrix (serum from a
plastic tube) in the candidate carbamazepine assay.
Thirty-three samples were spiked with carbamazepine at multiple concentrations
spanning the assay range. Each spiked sample was measured in duplicate by the
ONLINE TDM Carbamazepine Gen.4 assay. The results of samples prepared in the
evaluating matrix were compared to those of serum in plastic tubes by determining
the slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient, and recovery for each sample relative
to expected (y = reference tube, x = tested tube):

Lower concentrations may provide effective therapeutic response when other
anticonvulsants are used in combination with carbamazepine.
Serum or plasma level monitoring provides an indicator for individual dosage regimen.
Some patients may require levels outside these ranges for effective treatment. The ranges
are therefore, provided only as a guide for interpretation along with other clinical
symptoms, and are not to be taken as the sole indicator for adjustment of dosage. Peak
concentrations above 12 μg/mL (50.8 μmol/L) are often associated with toxicity. For
diagnostic purposes, the results should always be assessed in conjunction with the
patient’s medical history, clinical examination and other findings.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
