L. Test Principle:
TM TM
The BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay on BD MAX System consists of automated DNA
extraction and real-time PCR for the qualitative detection of CT/GC/TV DNA from the
urogenital specimens. The specimen collected using the BD MAX UVE Specimen Collection Kit
is vortexed briefly and then heated on the BD Pre-warm Heater to dissolve mucous, homogenize
the specimen matrix and lyse the target organisms. A worklist is created and the BD MAX UVE
TM
Sample Buffer Tube, the BD MAX CT/GC/TV Unitized Reagent Strip, and the BD MAX
TM TM
PCR Cartridge are loaded on the BD MAX System. The BD MAX System automates
sample preparation, including target organism lysis, DNA extraction and concentration, reagent
rehydration, and target nucleic acid amplification and detection using real-time PCR. The BD
TM
MAX System performs results interpretation automatically.
Following cell lysis, the released nucleic acids are captured on magnetic affinity beads, washed,
eluted, neutralized, and transferred to the Master Mix to rehydrate the PCR reagents. After
TM
reconstitution, the BD MAX System dispenses a fixed volume of PCR-ready solution
containing extracted nucleic acids into the BD MAX PCR Cartridge. Microvalves in the BD
MAX PCR Cartridge are sealed by the system prior to initiating PCR to contain the amplification
mixture, thus preventing evaporation and contamination. The amplified DNA targets are detected
using hydrolysis (TaqMan®) probes, labeled at one end with a fluorescent reporter dye
(fluorophore), and at the other end, with a quencher moiety. Probes labeled with different
fluorophores are used to detect amplicons for target analytes and the Sample Processing Control
TM
in four different optical channels of the BD MAX System. When the probes are in their native
state, the fluorescence of the fluorophore is quenched due to its proximity to the quencher. In the
presence of target DNA, the probes hybridize to their complementary sequences and are
hydrolyzed by the 5’-3’ exonuclease activity of the DNA polymerase as it synthesizes the
nascent strand along the DNA template. As a result, the fluorophores are separated from the
TM
quencher molecules and fluorescence is emitted. The BD MAX System monitors these signals
at each cycle and interprets the data at the end of the reaction to provide qualitative test results
for each analyte.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision
Within-laboratory precision was evaluated for the BD MAX™ CT/GC/TV assay at one site.
Testing was performed over 12 days, with 2 runs per day (2 technologists, alternating
operators each day), for a total of 24 runs. Each panel contained vaginal swab or female urine
specimen matrix and included Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and
Trichomonas vaginalis panel members. The following concentrations were used as spike
levels for the target organisms contained in each panel member:
· Moderate Positive (MP): 3x LoD
· Low Positive (LP): 1.5x LoD
· High Negative (HN): <1x LoD
· True negative (TN): no target
Precision study results for the BD MAX CT/GC/TV are described in Table 1.

The BD MAXTM CT/GC/TV assay includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC)
which is present in the Extraction Tube and monitors DNA extraction steps, thermal
cycling steps, reagent integrity and the presence of inhibitory substances.
Specimen Stability Studies:
First void urine specimens must be transferred from the collection cup to the BD
MAX UVE Sample Buffer Tube within 4 hours of collection when kept at 2-30 °C or
within 24 hours of collection when stored at 2-8 °C. Clinician-collected endocervical
swab and patient-collected vaginal swab specimens must be transferred immediately
or within two hours after collection to the BD MAX UVE Sample Buffer Tube when
kept at 2-30 °C (Table 7).

e. Detection limit:
The Limit of Dection (LoD) for the BD MAX™ CT/GC/TV assay in urine and
vaginal swab specimen matrix was determined by testing two representative strains
for each of the target organisms detected by the BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay. Each
target organism was prepared and quantified prior to testing. Positive specimens were
prepared by inoculating pooled female urine and pooled vaginal swab matrix in BD
MAX UVE Sample Buffer and tested at multiple concentrations of each
representative strain. Each matrix suspension was tested with at least 20 replicates per
LoD concentration using at least 6 BD MAX Systems and 3 different production lots
of the BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay. Analytical sensitivity (LoD) was defined as the
lowest concentration at which 95% of all replicates tested positive. The LODs for
urine and vaginal swab matrices are presented in Table 10 below.

Sample Buffer and tested with both pooled female urine and pooled vaginal swab
specimens. The BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay correctly identified 51 of the
serovars/strains tested for urine specimens and 49 of the serovars/strains tested for
vaginal swab specimens upon initial testing. Three strains of Trichomonas vaginalis
and one serovar of Chlamydia trachomatis in vaginal swab specimen, in addition to
two strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in urine, did not meet acceptance criteria and
were further evaluated. Of the six strains further evaluated, one was confirmed at 2X
LoD and five were confirmed at 1X LoD.
f. Analytical specificity:
The BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay was performed on samples containing
phylogenetically related species and other microorganisms likely to be found in
urogenital specimens. The bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites were tested in the
BD MAX UVE Sample Buffer Tube at 1x106 cells/mL, genomic DNA cp/mL, and
viruses were tested at 1x105 viral particles or genomic equivalents/mL. Organisms
tested are represented below in Table 11.
Of all microrganisms tested 98% (168/170) produced negative results with the
BD MAX CT/GC/TV. No cross-reaction was observed for Chlamydia trachomatis or
Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
Pentatrichomonas hominis (commensal of the large intestine) produced positive
results at a concentration ≥ 3.39 x 105 organisms/mL for Trichomonas vaginalis and
negative results for all other targets with the BD MAX™ CT/GC/TV assay.
Trichomonas tenax (commensal of the oral cavity) produced positive results at a
concentration ≥ 10 organisms/mL for Trichomonas vaginalis and negative results for
all other targets with the BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay. These limitations are included
in the labeling.

3. Clinical studies:
A multi-site (geographically diverse) study was conducted to evaluate the BD
MAX™ CT/GC/TV assay. A total of 2166 female subjects and 908 male subjects
from OB/GYN, sexually transmitted disease (STD) and family planning clinics were
enrolled in the Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae assay arm of the
study. Of these, 1327 female subjects were enrolled in the Trichomonas vaginalis
assay arm of the study. The final data analysis included 2114 evaluable female
subjects for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, with 1291 of these
female subjects evaluable for Trichomonas vaginalis. For males, 892 were evaluable
subjects for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae analyses. From these
compliant subjects, Chlamydia trachomatis performance was calculated from 1836
patient-collected vaginal swab, 1831 endocervical swab, 1849 female urine and 830
male urine specimens. Neisseria gonorrhoeae evaluable specimens included 1836
patient-collected vaginal swab, 1824 endocervical swab, 1849 female urine and 840
male urine specimens. Trichomonas vaginalis compliant specimens consisted of 1048
patient-collected vaginal swab, 1039 endocervical swab, and 1047 female urine
specimens. Exclusions included but are not limited to: enrollment issues, missing
specimens, transport errors, collection errors, shipping errors, processing errors,
TM
and/or BD MAX System operating errors.
Eight specimens were collected from each eligible female subject. Each female study
participant provided one urine specimen, one self-collected vaginal swab (collected in
TM
a clinical setting for testing on the BD MAX CT/GC/TV), three clinician-collected
vaginal swab specimens (two for the Trichomonas vaginalis reference testing and one
for discrepent analysis), and three endocervical swab specimens (for testing on the
TM
BD MAX CT/GC/TV and the two CT/NG reference tests). Each male study
participant provided one urine specimen and one urethral swab specimen.
TM
The performance of the BD MAX CT/GC/TV was calculated compared to Patient
Infected Status (PIS). PIS included two different commercially available Nucleic
Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs) for females and three NAATs for males from at
least two different specimen types for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria
gonorrhoeae, and two tests (culture and wet mount) for Trichomonas vaginalis. The
subject was designated infected with Chlamydia trachomatis and/or Neisseria
gonorrhoeae if at least two different reference NAATs were positive. For
14

Trichomonas vaginalis, the subject was designated infected if at least one of the
reference results (wet mount or culture) was positive. Both Trichomonas vaginalis
reference results were required to be negative to establish a non-infected status.
TM
The sensitivity, and specificity of the BD MAX CT/GC/TV for each specimen type
by symptom status is presented in Table 12 below .

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The prevalence of infection with CT and/or NG, and/or TV in patient populations
depends on risk factors such as age, gender, the presence or absence of symptoms, the
type of clinic, and the sensitivity of the test used to detect infections. During the clinical
evaluation of the BD MAXTM CT/NG/TV, the observed CT prevalence rates in females
and males were 7.6% and 21.2%, respectively. The observed NG prevalence rates in
females and males were 2.6% and 12.6%, respectively. The observed TV prevalence rate
in females was 14.6%.
Positive and Negative Predictive Values
Hypothetical estimated positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) for
TM
different prevalence rates using the BD MAX CT/NG/TV are shown in tables 17 – 19
below. These calculations are based on the hypothetical prevalence and overall sensitivity
and specificity compared to the PIS.
