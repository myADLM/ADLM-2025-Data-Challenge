The On Call Express Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System that is the subject of this
submission uses identical technology, software, measurement algorithm, test strips, and
quality control solutions as the predicate device, the On Call Express Blood Glucose
Monitoring System, which was cleared in k132086. The only differences between this
device and the predicate are the name, labeling (for multiple patient use by health care
professionals) and the materials of the meter.
Test strips are packaged in vials of 50 and also available individually packaged. Each test
strip contains the following reagent compositions: Glucose Oxidase (from Aspergillus
niger).
Each box of control solutions (Control Solution 0, Control Solution1, Control Solution 2)
contains one vial of each control solution level (2.0 mL per vial) of viscosity-adjusted,
buffered aqueous control solutions that contain known concentrations of d-glucose.
Control solutions were previously cleared under k132086 as the On Call Express Blood
Glucose Control Solutions and are being renamed under this submission.

L. Test Principle:
The test is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary
action. A blood sample is drawn into the test strip by capillary action, and reacts with
reagents on the test strip. This reaction produces an electrical current which is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the samples. The electrical current is
measured by the meter and is displayed to the user as a corresponding blood glucose
level.
M. Performance Characteristics:
Technological characteristics of this device are unchanged relative to the predicate device
(k132086). Performance characteristics were established in k132086 and as described
below.

humidity and that test strips in vials are stable for 6 months after first opening when
stored at 41-86 °F (5-30 °C) and 10-90% relative humidity.

--- Page 7 ---
Control Solution Stability:
Accelerated and real time stability studies were conducted to assess control solution
open and closed vial stability. The study protocols and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found to be adequate to support claims that unopened control solutions
have a 24 month shelf life and are stable for 6 months after first opening when stored
at 41-86ºF (5-30ºC ).

diabetes as:
Time Range (mg/dL) Range (mmol/L)
Fasting and Before Meals 70-100 3.9-5.6
2 Hours After Meal Less than 140 Less than 7.8
These ranges were cited from the ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 2015.
N. Instrument Name:
On Call Express Pro Blood Glucose Meter
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and requires a sample volume of 0.4 µL.

Yes ____x____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip,
forearm, or palm. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by
capillary action.
5. Calibration:
There is no calibration required for the On Call Express blood glucose meter by the
user. The meter is automatically coded by calibration information embedded in the
test strip.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at 3 different concentrations are available to be run with
this device. The user marks control solution tests by selecting an option from the
menu on the meter. Control solution tests are indicated on the display with a pound
(#) sign, this is described in the labeling, and these test results are excluded from
calculated average results. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are
provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the
test strip vial label and on the bottom of the test strip box. The user is cautioned not to
use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.
