The OneTouch Ultra Plus Flex Blood Glucose Monitoring System employs flavin adenine
dinucleotide glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH) enzyme chemistry as the standard dry
reagent assay for glucose in whole blood. This enzyme assay, with a redox chemical
“mediator” reaction, is used to generate an electrical current proportional to the glucose
concentration in the blood sample. The system is designed as an amperometric measurement
device using current generated from the redox reaction as the measurable response.

2 1.032 -4.060 0.998
3 1.047 -5.374 0.998
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 20
– 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The system is traceable to NIST SRM #917b reference material and calibrated to be
plasma-equivalent.
Test strip stability:
Real time stability studies are ongoing to assess the shelf-life and open-vial stability of
the OneTouch Ultra Plus Test strips. Real-time stability protocols and acceptance criteria
were evaluated and found to be acceptable to support closed-vial stability of 12 months at
41-86°F (65% relative humidity) and open-vial stability of 6 months when test strips are
stored at the recommended storage temperature range of 41-86°F and 65% relative
humidity.
Control Solution Value Assignment and Stability:
The OneTouch Ultra Plus Control Solutions were previously cleared under k120708.
Stability studies support a closed-vial shelf life of 24 months and an open-vial shelf life
of 6 months when stored at 41- 86° F.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range for the OneTouch Ultra Plus Flex Blood Glucose Monitoring
System is 20 to 600 mg/dL supported by the linearity assay study above (M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by spiking endogenous and exogenous substances
into venous whole blood. Each potential interferent was tested with 3 test strip lots at 2
glucose levels (70 and 300 mg/dL) for a total of 96 samples (12 replicates per lot per

The sponsor lists the following limitations in the Owner’s Manual and the Test Strip
Insert:
• The OneTouch Ultra Plus Flex™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System should
not be used within 24 hours of receiving a D-xylose absorption test as it may
cause inaccurately high results.
• Do not use the OneTouch Ultra® Plus Flex™ Blood Glucose Meter when
PAM (Pralidoxime) is known or suspected to be in the whole blood sample.
• If you have medical conditions that are associated with high uric acid level or
hyperuricemia (e.g. gout), then please check with your Doctor before using
the One Touch Ultra Plus Flex Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Uric acid
at concentrations greater than 8.0 mg/dL can interfere with glucose
measurements.
• If you take drugs containing acetaminophen (e.g Tylenol etc.) or Dopamine at
doses higher than the recommended high therapeutic level, then you may
obtain inaccurate readings from the OneTouch Ultra Plus Flex blood glucose
monitoring system. Please check with your Doctor if you are unsure.

Usability Study:
A usability study was performed to assess the readability of the labeling. 99 lay users
were provided the owner’s manual for 4-6 days at home prior to completing a system
use evaluation (under study staff observation) followed by a questionnaire designed
to evaluate the ease of use of the device and the clarity of the English language
labeling. The responses to the Instructions for Use Questionnaire met the acceptance
criteria, with lay users demonstrating acceptable levels of comprehension of the user
manual and the strip insert. The readability of the labeling using a Flesch-Kincaid
analysis was found to be: OneTouch Ultra Plus Flex Owners Booklet (7.7);
OneTouch Ultra Plus Test Strip Insert (7.6) and OneTouch Ultra Plus Control
Solution Insert (6.9).

5. Calibration:
The OneTouch Ultra Plus Flex Blood Glucose Monitoring System is calibrated such that the
result displayed is equivalent to the glucose level in a plasma sample. Calibration is
automatic. There is no user input for coding.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at two different concentrations can be run with this device.
Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. An
acceptable range for each control level is printed on the control solutions vial label. The
user is cautioned not to use the meter and to contact customer support if the control result
falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study:
To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the OneTouch Ultra Plus Flex Blood Glucose
Monitoring System, venous blood samples with hematocrit levels of 19%, 30%, 42%,
50%, and 61% were tested at 6 glucose concentrations (40±5, 65±5, 90±5, 120±6,
350±17, and 560±28 mg/dL). The evaluation included 8 meters, each tested with 2
replicates for 3 lots of test strips for a total of 864 measurements per hematocrit level.
Results from the meter were compared to results obtained using a laboratory-based
reference method (YSI). The evaluation of percent bias relative to YSI demonstrated
acceptable performance across the hematocrit range of 20-60%.
2. Altitude study:
To evaluate the effect of altitude on the OneTouch Ultra Plus Flex Blood Glucose
Monitoring System, meters were tested at 2 altitudes above sea level (0 ft and 10,000
ft). Venous whole blood samples spiked at 3 glucose levels (70, 240, and 450 mg/dL)
were tested at each altitude. The evaluation included 16 meters and 3 test strip lots.
Each lot included 2 replicates for a total of 288 measurements per test strip lot.
Results were compared to results obtained using a laboratory-based reference method
(YSI) and demonstrated that altitudes up to 10,000 feet above sea level have no
significant effect on blood glucose measurements from the OneTouch Ultra Plus Flex
Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
3. Sample Volume:
To demonstrate the minimum sample volume, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5µL of venous
whole blood samples at glucose concentrations of 65 and 450 mg/dLwere tested.
Testing included 6 replicates from 3 test strip lots for each glucose
concentration/sample volume combination for a total of 240 measurements per test
strip lot. 1 meter was used during testing. Values obtained were compared to values
14

--- Page 15 ---
obtained using a laboratory-based reference method (YSI). Results support a
minimum sample volume of 0.4 μL.
4. Operating Conditions Study:
Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated for temperatures
ranging from 41°F to 113°F (5°C to 45°C) and relative humidity between 10 and 90%
R.H. using 5 glucose concentration levels of venous whole blood (65, 150, 240, 350,
and 450 mg/dL), 6 meters, and 3 lots of test strips over 11 days for a total of 540
measurements per glucose concentration. Individual glucose measurements were
compared to the reference method (YSI) and percent bias were calculated. Results
demonstrated that glucose measurements on the OneTouch Ultra Plus Flex Blood
Glucose Monitoring System were not affected at temperatures ranging from 50°F to
104°F (10°C to 40°C) and relative humidity between 10 to 90% R.H. If the operating
temperature is outside of these conditions, the meter displays an error message
instead of a blood glucose value.
5. Infection Control and Robustness Studies:
The device is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy testing on the
surface materials of the meter demonstrated complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus
(HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Clorox Germicidal Wipes, 0.55% sodium
hypochlorite (EPA Registration # 67619-12). Robustness studies were also performed
by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external
materials of the meter after 3316 cleaning and 475 disinfection cycles designed to
simulate 4 years of device use with a maximum frequency of cleaning at 1x/day and
disinfection at 1x/week. Cleaning and disinfection durability of the OneTouch Delica
Lancing Device was previously shown in k131363.
6. EMC testing was certified and a compliance certificate provided.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
