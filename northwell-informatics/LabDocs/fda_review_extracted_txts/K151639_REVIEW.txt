For in vitro diagnostic use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
ABL80 FLEX and ABL80 FLEX CO-OX Analyzers
I. Device Description:
The ABL80 FLEX and ABL80 FLEX CO-OX analyzers are portable, automated systems
intended for in vitro testing of samples of whole blood for the parameters pH, pO , pCO ,
2 2
potassium, sodium, calcium, chloride, glucose, hematocrit (ABL80 FLEX analyzer only) and
the oximetry parameters (ABL80 FLEX CO-OX only) total hemoglobin, oxygen saturation,
FO2Hb, FCOHb, FMetHb, and FHHb.
The ABL80 FLEX and ABL80 FLEX CO-OX analyzers each exist in two different software
configurations differing in the number of parameters available.
The ABL80 FLEX and ABL80 FLEX CO-OX analyzers consist of an instrument with a
sensor cassette and a solution pack as the main accessories. Multiple models of sensor
cassettes are available. The various sensor cassette models include models for different
2

--- Page 3 ---
parameter combinations. For each parameter combination, models allowing for different test
loads are available. The solution pack is available in four models, one model for each of the
four different configurations of the analyzer.
The ABL80 FLEX and ABL80 FLEX CO-OX analyzers were previously cleared in k051804
and k080370. The current modification to the glucose measurement software is to
automatically handle certain glucose results depending on the pO value in the sample. This
2
will allow incorporating limitations of reporting glucose results when the pO value of the
2
sample is low.

L. Test Principle:
The amperometric test principle is used for the measurement of both pO and glucose
2
because glucose measurement is dependent upon enough pO in the sample; therefore, pO
2 2
and glucose are measured simultaneously. The magnitude of an electric flow of current is
proportional to the concentration of the substance being oxidized or reduced at an electrode.

Analytical Specificity for glucose measurement was reviewed and cleared in k051804
and k080370. However, additional studies were conducted to further characterize the
impact of, or interference from, limitations on the amounts of oxygen in the sample.
The cause of this interference effect is that the enzymatic conversion of glucose in the
sensor is oxygen consuming, the oxygen coming from the sample. The interference
study was performed according to the CLSI “Interference testing in clinical
chemistry; Approved Guideline – Second Edition”, CLSI document EP7-A2. Testing
was performed on three ABL80 FLEX and three ABL80 FLEX CO-OX instruments
with five levels of glucose and four levels of pO . Base pools of whole blood were
2
prepared for each glucose level and split into two samples with one being
tonometered to 100 mmHg pO (control sample) and the other to the pO level being
2 2
tested (test sample). Each sample was tested on the ABL80 FLEX and ABL80 FLEX
CO-OX analyzers, and the glucose bias for each test sample vs. the control sample
was calculated. The bias for the test sample was calculated and should be less than or
equal to the acceptance criterion which was set to 10% of the control value. Results
are summarized below:

The labeling (reference manual and owner’s manual) highlights awareness of
dependency of glucose measurement on sample pO levels and includes the following
2
description for flagging glucose results outside the validated glucose linear range and
the pO level of the sample:
2
· All glucose results at pO level <20 mmHg are suppressed and flagged by the
2
symbol “>” with a message “Glu not usable. pO too low for reliable
2
cGlucose measurement”.
· All glucose results >180 mg/dL at pO level between 20 – 40 mmHg will be
2
suppressed and flagged by the symbol “>” with a message “Glu not usable.
pO too low for reliable cGlucose measurement”.
2
· When the measured value of pO is not numeric (Not Reportable (N/R)) or
2
pO parameter is Lockout (P/L) or Not Derived (N/D) or Inactive (I/A) or QC
2
Lockout (L/O), then the results for glucose measurement will not be displayed
and the symbol “N/R” is displayed.
· If the results are outside the test range of the analyzer for glucose
measurement (see table above), the results are highlighted in red and flagged
with “ or ”.
