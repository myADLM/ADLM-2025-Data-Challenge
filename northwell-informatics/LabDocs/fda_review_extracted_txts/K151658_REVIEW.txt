L. Test Principle:
The Gmate Origin Blood Glucose Monitoring System is an in vitro diagnostic device
intended for the measurement of glucose in capillary blood. The reaction of glucose oxidase
in the test strip with glucose in the sample produces an electrical current which is
proportional to the amount of glucose in the sample. The meter measures the current and
converts it to the corresponding glucose concentration, which is displayed on the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed within-run precision studies using venous whole blood samples
consisting of five glucose concentration ranges (30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-200, and
251-400 mg/dL). Samples were tested using three lots of strips and 10 meters per test
strip lot. Each of the five samples was tested in replicates of fifty by two operators
using three lots of test strips and twenty meters for a total of 100 results per strip lot per
glucose level. Results are summarized below:

strip lots and the values from the Gmate Origin meter were compared with those
obtained from the reference method (YSI). Results from regression analysis:
Test Strip Lot 1: y = 1.000x - 0.812; R2 = 0.999
Test Strip Lot 2: y = 1.002x- 0.212; R2 = 0.999
Test Strip Lot 3: y = 0.997x + 1.48; R2 = 0.999
The results of the study support the sponsors claimed glucose measuring range of 20-
600 mg/dL. Studies were provided demonstrating that the meter displays “Low” when
glucose values below 20 mg/dL are tested, and “Hi” with glucose values over 600
mg/dL are tested.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The Gmate Origin Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to NIST SRM 917b.
The method comparison study was performed using the candidate device and YSI as the
reference method (see Section 2.a.)
Test Strip Stability
Test strip stability was established in k113636 to support the sponsor’s claim of 24
month shelf life and 3 month open vial stability when stored at 36°F to 90°F (2°C to
32°C) and relative humidity of 10% to 90%.
Control Solution Value Assignment and Stability
Value assignment and stability were established under k113636. The control solution
stability protocols and acceptance criteria provided in k113636 support the sponsor’s
claim of a 24 month shelf life and a 3 month open vial stability when stored at 4-30°C
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study in Section M.1.b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
To assess potential interference, the sponsor tested samples with 2 levels of glucose
concentrations of approximately 100 and 330 mg/dL by spiking with potentially
interfering substances at 4 different concentrations. Each sample was analyzed 5 times
with the Gmate Origin meter. The test results of the spiked samples were compared
with results measured from control samples without potential interfering substances.
The percent difference between the test and control samples was calculated and the
sponsor defined no significant interference as £±10%. Results are presented in the table
below:

Based on these results, the sponsor has the following limitations in the labeling:
If you are taking acetaminophen (e.g. Tylenol, etc.) or Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) at a higher
than therapeutic doses (>20 mg/dL acetaminophen or >3 mg/dL ascorbic acid) you may get
inaccurate results using this meter.
Cholesterol levels greater than 500 mg/dL, or triglyceride levels greater than 3,000 mg/dL
may produce elevated readings.

To assess system accuracy, results from the Gmate Origin Blood Glucose Monitoring
System were compared to an established glucose reference method, the YSI 2300
STAT. Three hundred (300) capillary blood samples from the fingertip, palm, forearm,
upper arm, thigh and calf (300 samples from each site) were tested by trained operators
using 10 meters and 3 lots of test strips. The candidate results were compared to results
obtained by the YSI 2300 method. The glucose concentrations of the total tested
samples ranged from 34.4 mg/dL to 450 mg/dL as measured by the YSI2 300 reference
method. To obtain glucose levels of less than 50 mg/dL and greater than 400 mg/dL
samples were allowed to glycolyze or were spiked. The results from the YSI 2300
STAT vs. Gmate Origin Blood Glucose System are summarized in the tables below:

5. Calibration:
There is no calibration required for the blood glucose meter by the user. The meter is
automatically coded. The test strips are coded with a test strip lot-specific code during
manufacture. When the test strip is inserted into the meter it provides the appropriate
calibration code information to the meter, therefore, the user is not required to enter any
coding information or verify the coding.
6. Quality Control:
Three levels of aqueous glucose control solutions are available with this system, Level 1,
Level 2 and Level 3. These solutions are available for purchase separately.
Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. An
acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip bottle label. The user is
cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges. The meter
automatically distinguishes control solution from blood and marks control solution tests
with an icon and excludes them from average calculations
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Sample volume Study:
The sponsor performed a study to verify the test strip minimum sample volume requirement
for the Gmate Origin Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Blood samples were tested at a
four sample volumes (0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1.0 µL) and five glucose concentrations (50, 70,
120, 230, and 430 mg/dL). Glucose values obtained with the Gmate Origin system were
compared to YSI values. Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.50 µL.
2. Altitude Study:
A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude on the Gmate Origin Blood
Glucose Monitoring System. Venous whole blood samples adjusted to concentrations of
70, 130, 230, and 380 mg/dL were evaluated using a hyperbaric chamber at three altitude
levels (sea level at 0 feet, 3000, 6000, and 10,000 feet). Results were compared to YSI
values. The results demonstrate acceptable bias to YSI to support the claims in the labeling
that altitudes up to 10,000 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements
from the Gmate Origin Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
3. Hematocrit Study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the Gmate Origin Blood
Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using venous whole blood at five glucose
concentrations (50, 100, 150, 230, and 330 mg/dL) and five hematocrit levels (20, 30, 40,
50, and 60%). Each sample was measured in ten replicates and values were compared to
those measured with an established laboratory reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer).
Results relative to YSI were acceptable and support the sponsor’s hematocrit claim of 20-
60%.

4. Temperature and Relative Humidity:
The effect of temperature and relative humidity on the Gmate Origin Blood Glucose
Monitoring System was evaluated using ten meters and three test strip lots. Whole blood
samples with approximate glucose concentrations of 70, 120, and 325 mg/dL were tested in
triplicate on each of the ten meters. The Gmate Origin Blood Glucose Monitoring System
was evaluated under the following conditions: 10oC, 10% RH (low temperature, low
humidity); 10ᵒC, 90% RH (low temperature, high humidity); 40ᵒC, 10% RH (high
temperature, low humidity); and 40ᵒC, 90% RH (high temperature, high humidity). The
results of the Gmate Origin Blood Glucose Monitoring System relative to YSI support the
claimed operating conditions of 10-40oC (50-104ᵒF) and 10-90% relative humidity.
5. Readability Assessment:
A Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results demonstrated that
the Owner’s Manual was written at an 8th grade level. Readability for the test strip insert
was evaluated during the review for k113636 and was determined to be at an 8th grade level
or below.
6. Infection Control/Robustness Studies:
The device is intended for a single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed on the external materials of the blood glucose meter by an outside commercial
testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of Hepatitis B virus with the chosen
disinfectant, CaviWipes with EPA registration # 46781-8. Robustness studies were also
performed by the sponsor to demonstrate that there was no change in performance or in the
external materials of the meter after 260 cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to
simulate 5 years of single-patient devise use (260 cleanings and 260 disinfections).
Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection
procedures.
7. Customer Support Center is available 24/7, 365 days a year. The toll free phone number
is: 1-855-464-6283.
8. Software validation:
Software validation and verification has been reviewed and the information provided was
deemed to be adequate.
9. EMC Testing:
The sponsor provided appropriate documentation certifying that electromagnetic testing
(EMC) has been performed and the Gmate Origin Blood Glucose Monitoring System was
found to be compliant.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
