L. Test Principle:
chromID MRSA is a selective medium for the detection and direct identification of MRSA.
The selectivity of this medium is based on the presence of an antibiotic mixture that inhibits
most bacteria not belonging to the genus Staphylococcus, as well as yeasts. Identification is
based on the cleavage of a chromogenic substrate in the medium by Staphylococcus aureus,
leading to a green coloration of the growing Staphylococcus aureus colonies. Skin and skin
structure infection specimens are inoculated directly onto the chromID MRSA agar plates
and incubated aerobically at 35°-37°C for 24 hours. The cultures are examined after 24 hours
incubation for the presence of green colonies, in which the presence of at least one green
colony gives the sample a positive MRSA status. Any color of green should be interpreted as
a positive result. No growth or colonies presenting as other than green in appearance should
be interpreted as a negative result.

Reproducibility was demonstrated at three sites using a blinded panel of ten well-
characterized Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including both mecA positive and
mecA negative isolates. At each site, panel members were tested in triplicate at 1x103
CFU/ml with multiple lots of chromID MRSA each day for five days. chromID
MRSA plates were observed for the growth of green colonies at 24 hours. All strains
produced the expected results with the chromID MRSA at 24 hours (450/450).
Isolates were also plated to BAP to ensure viability and purity of cultures.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality control (QC) testing was performed at each testing site for growth/color
development on chromID MRSA. Two quality control organisms (Staphylococcus
aureus ATCC 29213 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300) were tested at each
study site on chromID MRSA for each day of testing. The strains were also
subcultured to Trypticase Soy Agar w/ 5% sheep blood to ensure viability of the
organism. A single colony was touched with a sterile loop and then inoculated onto
chromID MRSA agar according to the package insert instructions. QC testing results
provided expected reactions at each of the four testing sites on each day tested, except
on two days (Table 1). Two days Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 grew, but
colonies were not green. The submitted QC data are acceptable.

An Expression of Resistance Study was conducted to demonstrate chromID MRSA
performance with 28 well-characterized strains [10 low level methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus, 10 high level methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 5
border-line oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA), and 3 methicillin-
susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA)] at multiple organism concentrations.
Eight non-MRSA strains (5 BORSA and 3 MSSA) did not grow on chromID MRSA
at the four tested concentrations. No false positives were observed. At 24 hours, all
MRSA strains were detected at 105 CFU/ml. Table 3 lists results of the Expression of
Resistance Study for MRSA strains at 24 hours and 48 hours.

In order to evaluate the performance of chromID MRSA agar against microorganisms
potentially encountered in skin and skin structure infections, a Cross-Reactivity Study
was performed with 71 non-MRSA strains (gram negative bacteria, gram positive
bacteria, and yeast) at approximately106 CFU/ml. Results showed that 44 organisms
from the cross-reactivity panel did not grow on chromID MRSA.
Please see Table 4 below for a list of strains yielding green colonies on chromID
MRSA after 24 hours.

Interference Study
Eight strains of Staphylococcus [4 MRSA, 2 methicillin resistant coagulase negative
Staphylococcus species (MRCNS) and 2 methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus
aureus (MSSA)] were used in an Interference Study. Interfering substances were
evaluated at physiologically or biologically relevant concentrations and mixed with
bacterial suspensions (9:1, v:v). Benzocaine (14 g/l) may delay the colony coloration
or inhibit growth of MRSA on chromID MRSA. MRSA colony color and growth
were not significantly affected by sodium citrate, citrate phosphate dextrose, plasma,
whole blood, and buffy coat.
Swab transport media was tested, and the data was provided in K091024 for the
chromID MRSA 510(k) claim for nasal specimens. Transport media tested included:
Amies Gel Medium, Liquid Amies Medium, Stuart Gel Medium, Liquid Stuart
Medium, and Cary-Blair Transport Media.
Mixed Infection Study
A Mixed Infection Study was conducted to demonstrate that high levels (104, 106 or
108 CFU/ml) of non-target organism will not suppress growth of MRSA. Ten MRSA
strains exhibiting different levels of methicillin-resistance were included in the study
and incubated with three non-target organisms (MSSA, MRCN Staphylococcus
epidermidis, and Escherichia coli). MRSA strains were tested at approximately 103
CFU/ml. At 24 hours, all five low level resistant MRSA strains were detected in the
Mixed Infection Study; however, this number varied from 2/5 up to 4/5 strains for the
high-level resistant MRSA strains at 24 hours. Two of the MRSA strains not
producing green colonies at 24 hours also did not produce green colonies during the
Analytical Reactivity Study at 24 hours. Results of the study revealed that MRSA was
still detected on chromID MRSA in the presence of high levels of MSSA, S.
epidermidis, or E. coli and that non-target organisms did not suppress growth of the
ten MRSA strains tested on chromID MRSA. Please refer to Table 5 for results of

690 SSSI specimens. Three specimens were excluded because they did not meet
specimen acceptance criteria. Seven specimens were removed due to protocol
deviations. A total of 680 compliant SSSI specimens were included in the
performance calculations for chromID MRSA.
All samples were inoculated onto the following media:
• chromID MRSA
• Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) with 6.5% NaCl
For the enrichment culture method, specimens inoculated into TSB with 6.5% NaCl
were incubated at 35°C for 24 hours in ambient air. Positive broth cultures were
subcultured to Tryptic Soy Agar with 5% sheep blood, while negative broth cultures
were incubated for an additional 24 hours before calling negative. Suspected
Staphylococcus aureus colonies from plates were identified by Gram stain, catalase,
latex agglutination, and cefoxitin screen test (30 µg disk).
chromID MRSA plates were incubated at 35°C for 24 hours in ambient air. Green
colonies detected on chromID MRSA plates after 24 hours of incubation indicated the
presence of MRSA. Performance (sensitivity and specificity) of chromID MRSA
compared to the enriched culture method is presented in Table 6 below.
