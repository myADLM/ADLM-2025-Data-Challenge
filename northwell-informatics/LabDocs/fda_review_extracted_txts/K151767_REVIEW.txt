Trinidad CH System
I. Device Description:
The Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Trinidad CH system is a floor model, fully automated,
microprocessor-controlled, integrated instrument system that uses prepackaged reagent packs
to measure a variety of analytes in human body fluids. The system is a multi-functional
analytical tool that processes chemical and immunochemical methodologies, utilizing
photometric, and integrated ion selective multisensor detection technologies (IMT) for
clinical use. The system includes the analytical module and the sample handler (Direct Load,
DL).The TD-LYTE IMT system consists of the following:
• TD-LYTE Integrated Multisensor (Na, K, Cl): four electrodes (one ion-selective
electrode for Na, K, Cl, respectively, and one reference electrode.
• TD-LYTE IMT Standard A & Standard B + Salt-bridge: calibrators used for
calibration of Na, K, and Cl assays. The salt bridge solution is packaged together
with the Standard B calibrator. The target concentrations of the TD-LYTE IMT
Standard A include: Na+ at 14 mmol/L, K+ at 0.4 mmol/L and Cl- at 10.4 mmol/L.
The target concentrations of the TD-LYTE IMT Standard B include: Na+ at 7
mmol/L, K+ at 6 mmol/L and Cl- at 16 mmol/L. The target concentrations of the Salt
Bridge include: K+ at 120.0 mmol/L and Cl- at 120.0 mmol/L.
• TD-LYTE IMT Diluent: A diluent consists of tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide,
phosphoric acid, BSA preservative, buffer, preservative and surfactant. All samples
are pre-diluted (1:10) with this diluent before analyzing.
• TD-LYTE IMT Dilution Check: solution used for verification of the Trinidad CH
system dilution ratio during instrument preventive maintenance or if indicated by
quality control results.
The Trinidad CH Albumin BCP Reagent (Alb_P) consists of Reagent R1 (bromocresol
purple, 1.1 mmol/L, acetate buffer, surfactant and microbial inhibitor). The Trinidad CH
Albumin BCP Calibrator is a lyophilized human serum-based product containing albumin
with a target concentration of 4.3 g/dL.
The Trinidad CH Albumin BCP Reagent (Alb_P) and Calibrator are the same reagent and
calibrator as those cleared in the predicate device (k132664), which are repackaged with the
Trinidad CH System labeling.
Each donation of human blood or blood component human was tested by FDA approved
methods and found non-reactive for the presence of the antibody to Human
Immunodeficiency Virus 1 and 2 (HIV 1/2), the Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and
the antibody to Hepatitis C (HCV).

L. Test Principle:
The TD-LYTE Integrated Multisensor (Na, K, Cl) uses indirect Integrated Multisensor
Technology (IMT). There are four electrodes used to measure electrolytes. Three of these
electrodes are ion selective for sodium, potassium and chloride. A reference electrode is also
incorporated in the multisensor.
A diluted sample (1:10 with IMT Diluent) is positioned in the sensor and Na+, K+ or Cl- ions
establish equilibrium with the electrode surface. A potential is generated proportional to the
logarithm of the analyte activity in the sample. The electrical potential generated on a sample
is compared to the electrical potential generated on a standard solution, and the concentration
of the desired ions is calculated by use of the Nernst equation.
The Trinidad CH IMT system performs a two point automatic calibration in duplicate every 4
7

hours. In addition, the system will routinely perform a one point calibration check with each
sample measurement. Auto-calibration occurs after power on, with the changing of standards
A, B, or a sensor and when the system software is reset.
The Trinidad CH Albumin BCP Regent (Alb_P) assay is an adaptation of the bromocresol
purple (BCP) dye-binding method reported by Carter and Louderback, et al. In the Trinidad
CH System Alb_P assay, serum or plasma albumin quantitatively binds to BCP to form an
albumin-BCP complex that is measured as an endpoint reaction at 596/694 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity studies were performed followed the CLSI EP06-A guidance. For the
three electrolytes, nine equally spaced samples covering the measurement range were
prepared by mixing high and low concentration samples. Three replicates were
measured for each sample. The mean of these replicates was compared to the
expected values and the results of weighted linear regressions are summarized in the
table below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The Trinidad CH Na assay is traceable to a flame emission spectrophotometry
reference method, which uses reference materials from the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST), via patient sample correlation and is verified
using NIST Reference Serum.
The Trinidad CH K assay is traceable to a flame emission spectrophotometry
reference method, which uses reference materials from the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST), via patient sample correlation and is verified
using NIST Reference Serum.
The Trinidad CH Cl assay is traceable to a coulometric reference method, which uses
reference materials from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
via patient sample correlation and is verified using NIST Reference Serum.
The Trinidad CH Albumin BCP assay is traceable to the SI unit through the use of
IRMM ERM® DA470k reference material. Assigned values for calibrators are
traceable to this standardization.
Stability
Shelf life stability studies were performed with assay reagents, standards and
calibrator, and demonstrated that they are stable for a year when stored unopened as
instructed. Once opened, the TD-LYTE Integrated Multisensor (Na, K, Cl) is stable
for 14 days on board. The TD-LYTE IMT Standard A & TD-LYTE IMT Standard B
+ Salt Bridge are stable for 30 days on board. The Trinidad CH System Albumin
BCP Reagents (Alb_P) are stable for 20 days on board. The reconstituted Trinidad

CH System Albumin BCP calibrators are stable for 8 hours on board. The protocols
for stability and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be adequate.
Value assignment
Concentrations of the TD-LYTE IMT Standard A & TD-LYTE IMT Standard B Salt
Bridge are assigned through an internal procedure. Production lots are gravimetrically
prepared and value assigned from master lots. The master lots are traceable to the
reference methods via serum anchor pools (secondary reference materials). The
serum anchor pools were value assigned through the primary reference procedures
and then used to calibrate the instruments used to assign values for the master lots.
The target values for the Standard A and Standard B solutions are stated in the
following table:
Standard A Standard B
Sodium 14.0 mmol/L 7.0 mmol/L
Potassium 0.4 mmol/L 6.0 mmol/L
Chloride 10.4 mmol/L 16.0 mmol/L
Values assigned to the Trinidad CH Albumin BCP Calibrator are traceable to the SI
unit through the use of IRMM ERM® 470 reference material. ERM® 470 is used to
calibrate a nephelometric immunochemical method and assign values to a master
pool. The master pool is then used to calibrate the instruments used to assign values
for the product calibrators using a standard value assignment process. The target
value for Trinidad CH Albumin BCP Calibrator is 4.3 g/dL.
The protocols for value assignment and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found
to be adequate.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification
(LoQ) were evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2 Guideline.
For the three electrolytes, LoB was determined by running 4 blank samples of each
sample matrix type in 5 replicates per day for 3 days using 2 reagent lots. LoD was
determined by running 4 low or diluted patient samples of each sample matrix type in
5 replicates per day for 3 days using 2 reagent lots. LoQ was determined by running 4
low samples of each sample matrix type in 5 replicates per day for 3 days using 2
reagent lots. The results are summarized in the table below:

For albumin, LoB was determined by running 6 blank samples in 5 replicates per day
for 3 days using 3 reagent lots. LoD was determined by running 5 low or diluted
patient samples in 5 replicates per day for 3 days using 3 reagent lots. LoQ was
determined by running 5 low samples type in 5 replicates per day for 3 days using 3
reagent lots. LoQ is defined as the lowest concentration for which the inter-assay
precision is < 10%. The results are summarized in the table below:

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP-7A guidance to determine
the effects from potential interferents on the ISE and albumin assays. Various
concentrations of interferents were spiked into two levels (low and high) of each
analyte in serum or urine. Testing was performed in either three replicates (for the
electrolytes) or five replicates (for albumin) per level using one reagent lot on one

The sponsor added the following limitations to their labeling:
• Avoid Hemolyzed samples for potassium. Hemolyzed samples may give incorrect
elevated potassium. Intracellular potassium concentration is 30-50 fold greater
than that of extracellular serum or plasma.
• Samples exposed to Benzalkonium salts present in certain blood catheter devices
will cause falsely elevated sodium and potassium measurements.*
• Citrate at 1 g/dL decreases the chloride result in serum at 82.4 mmol/L by -11.9%.
• Fluoride at 1 g/dL increases the chloride result in serum at 81.7 mmol/L by 40.0%
and 101 mmol/L by 55.4%.
• Iodine at 50 mg/dL increases the chloride result in serum at 82.2 mmol/L by
15.7%.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed following CLSI EP9-A3. Patient samples
for each sample matrix type were run in singlet on one Trinidad CH System and the
results were compared to those obtained on the predicate device (ADVIA 1800
Chemistry System). Less than 10% of the samples were spiked or diluted to fully
span the claimed measuring range of each analyte. The Passing-Bablok regression

*the sponsor displayed the following statement in labeling:
It is documented in the literature that potassium concentrations in plasma specimens
can be lower than in serum specimens as a consequence of platelet rupture during
coagulation. The extent of the potential difference is dependent on the platelet count
in the specimen. The lower potassium reference intervals for plasma specimens
compared to serum specimens reflect this known occurrence.
The sponsor performed an additional method comparison study with 59 lithium
heparin plasma samples on the potassium assays of the Trinidad CH Analyzer and the
ADVIA Chemistry 1800. The study collected one replicate on each instrument for
each sample. Deming regression was used to analyze the data and the results are

3. Specimen Identification:
Manual entry or barcode identification
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Samples are identified and delivered by the sample handler (Direct Load), which is part
of the Trinidad CH system.
5. Calibration:
The Trinidad CH System IMT system performs a two point automatic calibration in
duplicate every 4 hours. In addition, the system will routinely perform a one point
calibration check with each sample measurement. Auto-calibration occurs after power on,
with the changing of standards A, B, or a sensor and when the system software is reset.
In addition, a new calibration is required under the following conditions:
• After major maintenance or service, if indicated by quality control results
• As indicated in laboratory quality control procedures
• When required by government regulations
The Trinidad CH Albumin BCP assay should be calibrated if one or more of the
following conditions exist:
• At the end of the 8-day (per well) pack calibration interval, for calibrated reagent
packs on the system
• At the end of the 30-day lot calibration interval, for a specified lot of calibrated
reagent on the system
• When replacing system components
• When the reagent lot number changes
• After replacing critical optical or hydraulic components
• When indicated by quality control procedures
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor recommends on their labeling that “Follow government regulations or
accreditation requirements for quality control frequency. At least once each day of use,
analyze 2 levels (low and high) of commercially available quality control (QC) material
with known Na, K, Cl, albumin concentrations.”
