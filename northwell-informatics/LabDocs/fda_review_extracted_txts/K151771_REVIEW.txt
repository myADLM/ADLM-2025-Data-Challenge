Immunalysis Benzodiazepine Urine Enzyme Immunoassay
The Immunalysis Benzodiazepine Urine Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous
enzyme immunoassay with a cutoff of 200ng/mL. The assay is intended for use in
laboratories for the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of Benzodiazepine in
human urine with automated clinical chemistry analyzers. This assay is calibrated against
Oxazepam. This in-vitro device is for prescription use only.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as
Gas Chromatography/ Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or permitting laboratories to
establish quality control procedures.
The Immunalysis Benzodiazepine Urine Enzyme Immunoassay Kit provides only a
preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be
used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC-MS or Liquid Chromatography /
Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration
and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly
when preliminary positive results are used.
Immunalysis Multi-Drug Calibrators
The Immunalysis Multi-Drug Calibrators are intended for in vitro diagnostic use for the
calibration of assays for the analytes currently listed in the package insert:
Benzoylecgonine, Morphine and Oxazepam. The calibrators are designed for prescription
use with immunoassays.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Performance data was obtained using the Beckman AU400e clinical chemistry analyzer.
I. Device Description:
The Immunalysis Benzodiazepine Urine Enzyme Immunoassay Kit contains two reagents,
which are provided as ready-to-use:
• Antibody/Substrate Reagent (RA) – This reagent contains monoclonal antibodies to
Benzodiazepines, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD) in Tris buffer with Sodium Azide as a preservative.
• Enzyme Conjugate Reagent (RE) – This reagent contains benzodiazepines derivative
labeled with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in HEPES buffer with
Sodium Azide as a preservative.
2

The Immunalysis Multi-Drug Calibrators set is liquid and ready-to-use. The negative
calibrator is a processed, drug-free synthetic urine matrix with sodium azide as a
preservative. Each calibrator level contains a known concentration of oxazepam spiked into
the negative calibrator matrix.

L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on the competition of Oxazepam labeled enzyme glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and the free drug in the urine sample for the fixed amount of
antibody binding sites. In the absence of the free drug in the sample, the antibody binds the
drug enzyme conjugate and enzyme activity is inhibited. This creates a dose response
relationship between drug concentration in the urine sample and enzyme activity. The
enzyme G6PDH activity is determined at 340 nm spectrophotometrically by the conversion
of NAD to NADH.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision/cutoff characterization study was performed for 20 days, 2 runs per day
in duplicate (N=80) on drug-free negative urine samples spiked with oxazepam to
concentrations of ±25%, ±50%, ±75%, and ±100% of each cutoff. The spiked
concentrations were confirmed by mass spectrometry (MS). The results of the study

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study in the semi-quantitative mode was conducted by spiking a drug-free
urine pool with a high concentration of oxazepam and generating serial dilutions to

was tested in triplicate and drug recovery calculated using the mean concentration of
the replicates. The results are summarized below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The analyte in the calibrator is traceable to a commercially available oxazepam
solution. This standard is diluted with synthetic negative urine to make the calibrator
s to the desired concentrations. The concentrations are confirmed by Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry Analysis (GC/MS) and/or Liquid
Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS/MS).
Value Assignment/Expected Values
The Negative Calibrator is a processed, drug free urine matrix. The standard is
compared to a reference negative standard to ensure that it is free of analyte. A value
is assigned when the test is within the acceptable range.
The non-zero calibrators are prepared by spiking known concentrations of oxazepam
into the negative calibrator matrix. The concentrations are confirmed by GC/MS or
LC/MS/MS. If any of the analytes are out of the acceptable range, then the calibrator
is adjusted and re-tested. Values are assigned to the calibrator once the GC/MS or
LC/MS/MS results are within the acceptable range.
Calibrator Stability
Closed-vial accelerated stability and open vial stability studies were conducted for the
calibrators. Real-time stability studies are ongoing. All stability protocols were
reviewed and found to be acceptable. These studies support the closed vial stability
claim of 12 months and the opened vial stability claim of 60 days when calibrators
are stored at 2-8°C.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Structurally related compounds

quantitative modes by spiking various benzodiazepines or structurally related

Endogenous compounds
Potential interference from endogenous compounds was evaluated in the qualitative
and semi-quantitative modes by spiking these compounds into drug free urine
containing oxazepam at ± 25% of the 200 ng/mL cutoff (150 ng/mL and 250 ng/mL,
respectively). The results were the same for the qualitative and semi-quantitative
modes and are summarized below:

Acid is not recommended as a preservative for urine”.
pH and Specific Gravity
To evaluate potential interference from the pH of urine, device performance in the
qualitative and semi-quantitative modes was tested using a range of urine pH values
(3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0 and 11.0). All test samples were prepared in drug
free urine containing oxazepam at ± 25% of the 200 ng/mL cutoff (150 ng/mL and
250 ng/mL, respectively). No positive or negative interference was observed at urine
pH values ranging from 3.0 to 11.0 for each test mode.
To evaluate potential interference from the specific gravity of urine, device
performance in the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes was tested using a range
of urine specific gravity values (1.000, 1.002, 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025 and
1.030). All test samples were prepared in drug free urine containing oxazepam at ±
25% of the 200 ng/mL cutoff (150 ng/mL and 250 ng/mL, respectively). No positive
or negative interference was observed at urine specific gravity values ranging from
1.000 to 1.030 for each test mode.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentrations of 200 ng/mL is described in the precision section, M.1.a. above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Eighty-six unaltered urine samples from clinical testing laboratories were analyzed
for Benzodiazepine by the candidate device on the Beckman Coulter AU400e clinical
chemistry analyzer and with LC/MS. The results were identical in both qualitative
and semi-quantitative modes and are summarized below:

*sample contained 187 ng/mL Nordiazepam, which is equivalent to 207.8 ng/mL of
Oxazepam (the calibrator drug).
