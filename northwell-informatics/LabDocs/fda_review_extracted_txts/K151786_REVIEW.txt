L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys Vitamin B12 II assay is an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA)
for the quantitation of Vitamin B12 in serum or plasma. Total duration of assay is 27 minutes
as follow:
1) 15 μL of the sample incubates with the vitamin B12 pretreatment 1 and
pretreatment 2, bound vitamin B12 is released.
2) By incubating the pretreated sample with the ruthenium labeled intrinsic factor, a
vitamin B12‑binding protein complex is formed, the amount of which is
dependent upon the analyte concentration in the sample.
3) Addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles and vitamin B12 labeled with
biotin, the still-vacant sites of the ruthenium labeled intrinsic factor become
occupied, with formation of a ruthenium labeled intrinsic factor vitamin B12
biotin complex. The entire complex becomes bound to the solid phase via
interaction of biotin and streptavidin.
4) The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles
are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances
are then removed with ProCell/ProCell M. Application of a voltage to the
electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a
photomultiplier.
5) Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument specifically
generated by 2‑point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent
barcode.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:

--- Page 7 ---
Precision was evaluated on the cobas e 411 according to CLSI EP5-A2. Five human
serum samples (native and spiked) plus 3 quality control materials (Preci Control
Varia samples) were assayed using 1 lot of reagent in duplicate (2 aliquots), twice per
day for 21 days (n = 84).
Within Run and Total precision results are summarized in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity of Vitamin B12 II assay was evaluated according to CLSI EP6-A. A high
analyte serum sample (spiked) was serial diluted into 10 concentrations (from 2239
pg/ml to110 pg/mL) with a buffered human serum albumin matrix. Samples were
measured 3 times (n=3) within a single run on cobas e 411. The measured values
were plotted against the target values and the regression results support the sponsor
claimed measuring range of 150-2000 pg/mL. The linear regression equation is
summarized in the table below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Elecsys Vitamin B12 II assay is traceable to the Elecsys Vitamin B12 assay
(k060755).
Vitamin B12 II CalSet Value assignment:
A human serum sample panel set (Master Calibrators) is available and traceable to the
Elecsys Vitamin B12 assay (predicate device). The Kit Calibrators (two levels) are
prepared from Vitamin B12 spiked in human serum matrix. Reagent comparison is
performed using at least 3 instruments of each platform with at least 6 runs. The
Master Calibrators and Kit Calibrators are run in duplicate. The values of
PreciControl Varia (level 1&2) are read off from the calibration curve and should be

lowest analyte concentration that can be reproducibly measured with a total %CV of
≤20%. 10 human serum samples were measured in 5 replicates/run, one run/day for 5
days, using 3 reagent lots on one instrument (n=25 per reagent lot).
The results of the detection limits are summarized in the table below:
LoB LoD LoQ
44.3 pg/mL 89.2 pg/mL 129 pg/mL
Based on the detection limits studies, sponsor claimed that the measuring range of the
candidate device is 150 pg/mL to 2000 pg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity:
Cobinamide was tested at 4 levels of 30, 60,120 and 210 ng/mL in serum samples
with low and high levels of vitamin B12 (approximately 129 pg/mL and 550 pg/mL).
No significant cross-reactivity was observed based on the study results. The results
are summarized in the table below:
Max.
Highest cross reactivity observed
Cross reactant concentration
(%)
Tested (ng/mL)
Cobinamide dicyanide 210 0.003
Endogenous Interference:
Interference testing was performed according to CLSI EP7-A2. Three human serum
samples containing low, medium and high concentrations of Vitamin B12 were used
on cobas e 411 Immunoassay analyzer using the Elecsys Vitamin B12 II assay. One
aliquot of each low, medium and high samples were spiked with these interfering
substances: Rheumatoid Factor, Biotin, Lipemia, Hemoglobin (two hemoglobin
levels of 60 mg/dL and 1000 mg/dL were used), Bilirubin, IgG, IgM, and IgA.
Another aliquot was spiked with the same volume of isotonic saline solution. The
spiked sample was then diluted in 10% increments. The recovery was determined by
testing a control sample without the interferent and comparing it to the value obtained
from a test sample in which the potential interferent had been added. The sponsor’s
defined acceptance criteria for non-significant interference are:
Samples <200 pg/mL: Recovery within +20 pg/mL of un-spiked reference value
Samples >200 pg/mL: Recovery within + 10% of un-spiked reference value.
The highest tested concentration of endogenous substance without significant
interference are summarized in the table below and stated in the product insert:

Based on hemoglobin testing, a falsely depressed (-17% bias) result from hemoglobin
of >100 mg/dL was observed; therefore sponsor has the following limitations in the
specimen collection and preparation section of the package insert:
“Do not use any hemolyzed samples because samples showing visible signs of
hemolysis will have falsely depressed results.”
In addition, the sponsor states the following in the limitation section in the package
insert:
“Samples should not be taken from patients receiving therapy with high biotin doses
(i.e. >5 mg/day) until at least 8 hours following the last biotin administration.”
Exogenous Interferences/Drugs:
Sixteen commonly used pharmaceuticals were examined for potential effect on the
Vitamin B12 II assay. Each drug was spiked into 2 serum samples (approximate
concentration of the samples 200 and 1200 pg/mL) and was tested in 8 replicates one
cobas e 411 Immunoassay Analyzer. The drug concentrations tested are according to
the recommendation (if available) given in the CLSI guideline EP7-A2. The sponsor
defined significant interference is +10% bias in the spiked sample as compared to the
control sample.
For common drug interferences, results of the concentration tested that did not show
significant interference are summarized in the table below.

with one reagent lot and on one cobas e 411 analyzer. The reference range was
determined using the median value and the 2.5th -97.5th percentile (pg/mL).
The sponsor states that these values should be used as guidelines; each laboratory should
investigate the transferability of the expected values to its own patient population and
if necessary determine its own reference ranges.
n Median (pg/mL) Range (2.5th -97.5th percentile) (pg/mL)

N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
