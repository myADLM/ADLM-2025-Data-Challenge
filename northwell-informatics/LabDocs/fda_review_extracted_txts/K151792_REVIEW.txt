L. Test Principle:
The Trinidad IM TSH assay employs anti-FITC monoclonal antibody covalently bound to
paramagnetic particles, a FITC-labeled anti-TSH capture monoclonal antibody, and a tracer
consisting of a proprietary acridinum ester and an anti-TSH monoclonal antibody conjugated
to bovine serum albumin (BSA) for chemiluminescents detection.
A direct relationship exists between the amount of TSH present in the patient sample and the
amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the system.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was performed on 20 days on 2 Trinidad IM systems with 2 reagent lots in
accordance with CLSI EP05-A2 as a guideline. Repeatability and within-lab
imprecision was evaluated by testing four serum-based controls, six human serum
pools and six human plasma pools (three EDTA and three lithium heparin). The
samples were run in 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 20 days for a total of 80
replicates. The following precision results were obtained:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The Trinidad IM TSH linearity was evaluated by using a high TSH serum sample
(151.4 µIU/mL) mixed with a low equine serum pool (0.001 µIU/mL) to prepare
intermixed samples ranging in various different TSH levels. All nine samples were
assayed in triplicate using one reagent lot on one Trinidad IM system.
The weighted Deming regression equation is:
y = 0.957x + 0.0000; R = 1.000
The sponsor claimed that the TSH assay has a measuring range of 0.008 to 150
µIU/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Trinidad IM TSH assay is standardized to internal standards, which are traceable
to the World Health Organization (WHO) 3rd International Standard for Human TSH
(IRP 81/565).
The Trinidad IM Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) assay utilizes a factory set
master curve standards (10 levels) that have fixed TSH doses and corresponding
relative light units (RLU) signals that are reagent dependent. The master curve values
are contained on the master curve card provided with each kit. The barcode reader or
keyboard is used to enter the master curve values on the system. The 2 calibrators in
the kit are run when the lot is first used or after expiration of the calibration interval.
If the calibration run is valid as determined by prearranged parameters, the values are
stored and used to “normalize” test values to the master curve.
The sponsor has a statement in the package insert: Do not mix calibrator lots with
different lots of reagent packs.
The Trinidad IM TSH calibrators were previously cleared under k041133.
Trinidad IM Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) Calibrators are stable at 2-8 °C for
12 months unopened. The open vial stability (reconstituted) is stable for 28 days and
the on-system stability is 4 hours. The stability study protocol and acceptance criteria
have been provided and found to be adequated.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) for the Trinidad IM TSH assay was determined as
recommended in CLSI guideline EP17-A2 (Evaluation of Detection Capability for
Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures). Five blank samples with no detectable
7

--- Page 8 ---
levels of TSH were assayed for a minimum of two runs per day, two replicates per
run, using three lots of reagent on two Trinidad IM systems over five days for a total
of 200 replicates. The LoB was established as the TSH value corresponding to the
95th rank position in each dataset. LoB was calculated to be 0.001 µIU/mL.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined as recommended in CLSI guideline
EP17-A2 by using five serum samples with TSH levels ranging from 0 to 0.0073
μIU/mL. All samples were assayed in duplicate in each of a minimum of 20 runs
using three lots of reagents on two Trinidad IM systems over a minimum of 10 days
(n=80). The LoD was calculated to be 0.005 µIU/mL using the following equation
LoD = LoB + c SD
p L.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ), using functional sensitivity, was determined by
using five (5) low-level TSH serum sample. TSH levels ranging from 0.0078 to
0.0208μIU/mL were used. All samples were assayed in duplicate in each of 10 runs,
on two Trinidad IM systems, using three reagent lots, and over a period of at least 10
days (n=80).
The functional sensitivity was based on the within lab precision of 20% CV and was
determined to be 0.008 µIU/mL.
The claimed measuring range of the assay is 0.008 to 150 μIU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was conducted to evaluate the effect of endogenous interfering
substances (hemoglobin, triglycerides, bilirubin, conjugated and unconjugated) using
4 serum samples on the Trinidad IM TSH assay. All samples were tested in triplicate
with one reagent lot on one Trinidad IM system. Based on the sponsors definition of
non-significant interference (≤10 % recovery of the control value), no significant
interference for the substances and concentrations listed below:

observed
substances
Hemoglobin 600 mg/dL
Triglycerides (Intralipid) 2000 mg/dL
Bilirubin, conjugated 60 mg/dL
Bilirubin, unconjugated 60 mg/dL
In addition, to determine the cross reactivity of related proteins in the Trinidad TSH
assay, four human samples with TSH levels of 0.37, 3.74-3.83, 44.1-45.8 and 120-
125 µIU/mL were spiked with the following levels of cross-reactants:

· hCG at 200, 000 µIU/mL
· FSH at 1500µIU/mL
· LH at 600 µIU/mL
The control samples and the spiked samples were assayed in triplicate using one
reagent lot on one Trinidad IM system.
Based on the sponsor’s definition of non-significant interference (≤5% of the control
value), no significant interference for the compounds and concentrations below:
Compound Tested Concentration
hCG 200, 000 µIU/mL
FSH 1500µIU/mL
LH 600 µIU/mL
Hook effect: To evaluate the potential for high dose hook effect in the Trinidad IM
TSH assay a high TSH sample (~9200 µIU/mL) was prepared. The sample was
serially diluted 2-fold. The neat sample and the dilutions were assayed in triplicate
with one lot of reagent on one Trinidad IM system. There was no high dose effect
observed at TSH concentrations up to 3,000 µIU/mL.
The sponsor included the following statement in the Trinidad IM TSH assay package
insert:
“High TSH levels can cause a paradoxical decrease in the RLUs (high-dose hook
effect). In this assay, TSH levels as high as 3000 μIU/mL (mIU/L) will assay greater
than 150 μIU/mL.”
