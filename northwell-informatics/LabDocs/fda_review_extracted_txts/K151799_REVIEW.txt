L. Test Principle:
The EliA™ test wells are coated with a human thyroglobulin protein, or a human
recombinant thyroid peroxidase protein. If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies to
TG or TPO bind to their specific antigen. After washing away unbound antibodies,
enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgG antibodies (EliA IgG Conjugate) are added to
form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed
away and the bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution. After stopping the
reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The higher the value of
fluorescent signal detected by the instrument, the higher the amount of antibody bound and
detected in the sample tested. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is
compared directly to the response for calibrators.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Note: All results below met the manufacturer’s pre-specified acceptance criteria.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision studies were performed using eight patient serum samples selected from
different parts of the claimed measuring range of the assay on both Phadia 250 and
Phadia 2500/5000 instruments to establish intra- and inter-assay precision. A total of 21
runs (three instruments/seven runs each) over seven days were performed on samples
with 252 replicate determinations per sample with a calibration curve in each run.
Two lots of EliATM anti-TG well were included in the study. On each instrument the
same eight samples were tested. All samples were neat specimens from different
patients. The study was performed on three Phadia 250 and three Phadia 2500/5000
instruments.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
For EliATM anti-TG, seven patient serum samples and for EliATM anti-TPO, six patient
samples were serially diluted using EliA Sample Diluent and tested in three replicates
with one batch of EliATM anti-TG immunoassay and EliATM anti-TPO immunoassay and
one set of system reagents on the Phadia® 250 or Phadia® 2500/5000 instruments. The
observed values were graphed against the calculated values and a linear regression was
performed. Results are summarized below:

The technical measuring range (detection limit, upper limit of the calibration curve) for
EliATM anti-TG is from 12 to 4797 IU/mL. The upper limit of the reported results in
EliA IU/ml can vary due to a lot-specific conversion from μg/L to EliA IU/mL. The
transfer of the upper limit of the measuring range to IU/ml is defined by the formula:
600 μg/l x 9.98 (for anti-TG), where 600 μg/L is the highest calibration point. Results
above the upper limit are generally reported as “above”. Linearity was shown for the
range between 10.1 – 4827.9 IU/mL on Phadia 250, and between11.1–5127.8 on Phadia
2500/5000. The claimed linear range of EliATM anti-TG for instruments is 12–4797
IU/mL. The labeling states that due to differing binding characteristics of the antibodies
in patient samples, not all sera can be diluted linearly within the technical measuring
range.

Due to an administrative error, the reference to “anti-TG” in the paragraph below was
erroneously included, and has been replaced with the correct reference to “anti-TPO”.
The technical measuring range (LoD/LoQ, upper limit of the calibration curve) for
EliATM anti-TPO is from 4 to 1542 IU/mL. The upper limit of the reported results in
EliA IU/mL can vary due to a lot-specific conversion from μg/L to EliA IU/mL. The
conversion of the upper limit of the measuring range to IU/mL is calculated by the
formula: 600 μg/L x 3.21 (for anti-TPO anti-TG), where 600 μg/L is the highest
calibration point. Results above the upper limit are generally reported as “above”.
Linearity was shown for the range between 3.2–2201.2 U/mL on Phadia 250, and 3.6–
1955.9 on Phadia 2500/5000. The claimed linear range of EliATM anti-TPO for
instruments is 4–1542 IU/mL. The labeling states that due to differing binding
characteristics of the antibodies in patient samples, not all sera can be diluted linearly
within the technical measuring range.
High dose Hook effect:
Hook effect was investigated by using five serum samples above the upper limit of the
measuring range. Five high positive samples were diluted and the dilutions were
measured in two replicates and compared to the upper limit of the technical measuring
range.
EliATM anti-TG Immunoassay: No hook effect was observed when analyzing a high
positive serum sample up to 135,582 IU/mL.
EliATM anti-TPO Immunoassay: No hook effect was observed when analyzing a high
positive serum sample up to 20,725 IU/mL.
Results above the upper limit of the measuring range are reported as “above”. Package
insert recommends not making dilution of samples outside measuring range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i) Traceability
Calibrators – The IgG calibrators are traceable (via unbroken chain of calibrations) to
the International Reference Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of Human Serum
Immunoglobulins A, G and M from the World Health Organization (WHO). New
batches of IgG calibrators are compared to a secondary standard (standardized with
the IRP) or the IRP directly and adjusted accordingly to meet the correct
concentration.
EliATM anti-TG is calibrated against the 1st International Reference Preparation for
human anti-TG serum code 65/93 and EliATM anti-TPO is calibrated against the
NIBSC research standard for anti-thyroid microsome serum code 66/387. The

			(0.970–1.004)			(-1.46–4.68)		

--- Page 13 ---
instrument measures specific IgG concentrations in μg/L. By using a conversion
factor given by the lot-specific code of the EliA™ test well, the results are
automatically converted to IU/mL for EliA™ anti-TG and EliA™ anti-TPO.
The calibrators are a set of six WHO-standardized IgG calibrators derived from
human serum with assigned values from 0–600 μg/mL. The calibrator curve is
acquired by fitting the values of the six calibrators and can be stored for up to 28
days by the instrument to be used on additional assays. Each additional assay
includes calibrator (curve) controls that have to recover in defined ranges to ensure
that the stored calibration curve is still valid.
Controls – EliA Thyroid Positive Control is prepared from selected pooled human
sera and contains IgG antibodies to TG and TPO. EliA IgG/IgM/IgA Negative
Control is prepared from selected pooled sera from normal, healthy donors. The
controls are pre-diluted and ready for use. Each EliA™ Control package contains a
Control Certificate listing predefined acceptance criteria for the EliA™ products the
Controls can be used with. The target ranges of the EliA™ Controls tested with the
EliA™ TG and TPO on the two Phadia® instruments are summarized below:

ii) Kit Stability:
Data for open and closed real time stability and on-board stability of EliATM IgG
reagents and general EliA reagents on Phadia 250 and Phadia 2500/5000 instrument
were submitted and cleared with several other EliA tests, e.g., K141375 for EliA M2,
for Phadia 250 instrument and with K061165 for EliA CCP for the Phadia
2500/5000.
Shelf-life stability – The real time stability test confirmed the shelf life for EliATM
anti-TG wells and EliATM anti-TPO wells and it was determined to be 18 months.
The shelf life stability of the EliATM Thyroid Positive Control was determined to be
15 months. The shelf life stability of the EliA IgG/IgM/IgA Negative Control was 24
months.
Open Stability – Stability of the foil bag containing the EliA anti-TG and EliA anti-
TPO wells after first opening was tested and determined to be 9 months at 2–8°C.

Controls – EliATM Thyroid Positive Control 250, EliATM Thyroid Positive Control
2500/5000, EliATM IgG/IgM/IgA Negative Control 250, and EliATM IgG/IgM/IgA
Negative Control 2500/5000 are for single use only. Therefore, stability after first
opening study is not required.
On-board stability – The on-board stability EliATM anti-TG and EliATM anti-TPO
carriers (containing the antigen coated wells) were tested over four weeks using three
positive and two negative samples only on the Phadia 250 instrument. As the storage
conditions in the Phadia 2500/5000 instrument are similar, the results can also be
used for stability claims for the Phadia 2500/5000. The on-board stability for the
Phadia 250 instrument was determined to be 28 days at 2–8°C.
iii) Sample Storage
The package insert recommends following the guidelines in CLSI H18-A3:
Procedures for the Handling and Processing of Blood Specimens for Common
Laboratory Tests; Approved Guideline for sample storage. Separated serum/plasma
should remain at room temperature for no longer than 8 hours. If assays will not be
completed within 8 hours, serum/plasma should be refrigerated (2– 8°C). If assays
are not completed within 48 hours, or the separated serum/plasma will be stored
beyond 48 hours, serum/plasma should be frozen at or below -20°C. Freezing and
thawing should be avoided.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined in accordance
with CLSI EP17-A2. On each Phadia instrument (Phadia® 250 and Phadia®
2500/5000), four immunoglobulin depleted serum (for LoB) and four low antibody
samples (for LoD) were assayed in six replicates in each of six runs at six different days
(36 replicates per sample). For both instrument types (Phadia 250 and Phadia
2500/5000), each sample was run in a total of six runs on two instruments (3 runs on
instrument #1 and three runs on instrument #2) with two lots of wells and reagents. The
results are summarized in the tables below:
EliATM anti-TG LoB (IU/mL) LoD (IU/mL)
Phadia 250 5.0 10.1
Phadia 2500/5000 4.9 8.5
A single LoD of 12.0 IU/mL for anti-TG was chosen.

Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
For LoQ determination for both assays, bias was set to 12% which leads to estimated
CV of 30%. The target value for the total error = 12+2*%CV = 72 %. Because
tot
estimated total error for the LoD in all cases was less than the target value, the LoQ
was determined to equal the LoD for both assays.
e. Analytical specificity:
i) Endogenous Interference
Interferences were assessed by testing three samples (one negative, one around the
cut-off, and a high positive sample). Each sample was spiked with the interfering
substances or substance-specific blanks, and analyzed in two runs, each in duplicates
(n=4), on one lot of EliA™ TG or EliA™ TPO Well and one lot of each system
reagents. The data demonstrated that EliA™ TG or EliA™ TPO was not adversely
affected (percent recoveries ranged from 94 to 109% for EliA™ TG and 93 to 105%
for EliA™ TPO) by high levels of the following substances up to the concentrations
listed in the tables below:
EliATM anti-TG and EliATM anti-TPO Immunoassay
Potential Interfering Compound Concentration in undiluted
sample
Bilirubin F 192 mg/dL
Bilirubin C 201 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 4960 mg/dL
Lipemic factor 1%
Rheumatoid factor 500 IU/mL
Thyroxine 2.5 ng/dL
Iodide 3 mM
ii) Carry-over
In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the Phadia 250 system of washing the sample
pipette between samples, carry-over study was previously evaluated in K082759,
EliA Ro assay. The data demonstrate no carryover effect as the results of the Diluent
sample results were not affected by the results of the previous sample.
Phadia 2500/5000 instruments use disposable tips for pipetting samples and a
separate pipette for the conjugate, therefore carry-over from samples to conjugate is
unlikely.

f. Assay cut-off:
The study was done on 604 apparently healthy blood donor samples from Caucasian,
African American, Hispanic and Asian individuals almost equally distributed by sex and
age, the expected values for each of the antigens in the submission in the normal
population and to confirm the defined cut-off. Based on the results of the expected
values/reference range study, the 90th and 95th percentile of the 604 samples were
calculated and the 90th percentile was taken into account for setting the cut-off. The
assay cut-offs were set as follows:
EliATM anti-TG
< 40 IU/mL Negative
40–60 IU/mL Equivocal
> 60 IU/mL Positive
In case of equivocal results, it is recommended to retest the patient after 8-12 weeks.
EliATM anti-TPO
< 25 IU/mL Negative
25–35 IU/mL Equivocal
> 35 IU/mL Positive
In case of equivocal results, it is recommended to retest the patient after 8-12 weeks.

b. Matrix comparison:
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the new device EliATM anti-TG and
EliATM anti-TPO give the same results for serum, Li-heparin plasma and K3-EDTA
plasma collected from the same patient. A total of 57 matrix-matched samples spread
across the assay range were assayed in duplicate on the Phadia 250. Out of 57 samples,
25 samples were spiked with serum samples of high antibody titer to cover the
measuring range as it was not feasible to obtain a relevant number of matched serum-
and plasma-samples from thyroid disease patients. However, the seven samples within
the equivocal range and 25 negative samples were neat samples. Negative samples did
not switch to positive in any serum/plasma combination.
Weighted Deming regression plots were generated and the corresponding slopes of
regression and coefficients were determined. The manufacturer’s acceptance criterion
was that the quotient of plasma to serum concentration should be between 0.80–1.20 for

4. Clinical cut-off:
Same as assay cut-off
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A total of 604 apparently healthy, age- and gender-matched blood donor samples from a
population to better reflect the ethnic composition of the US population (~60.5% White
Americans, ~14% African Americans, ~17% Hispanics, ~6% Asians, ~2.5% others) were
used. Note: The 90th percentile was chosen to determine the cut-off because according to
literature >10% of the healthy subjects are reported to have anti-thyroglobulin / anti-thyroid
peroxidase antibodies. The results are summarized below:
EliATM TG IU/mL
Mean 61.2
Median 12.2
Range 12–5071.7
90th percentile 35.6
95th percentile 97.9
EliATM TPO
Mean IU17/m.3L
Median 4.4
Range 4 – 1004.3
90th percentile 14.2
95th percentile 59.9
EliATM anti-TG Immunoassay:
For EliATM anti-TG, the 90th percentile lies at 35.6 IU/mL. The lower limit of the equivocal
range was chosen to be at least equal to lowest positive calibrator (40 IU/mL). The upper
cut-off value was determined as 56 IU/mL (40 IU/ml x 1.4) which was rounded up to 60
IU/mL.
EliATM anti-TPO Immunoassay:
For EliATM anti-TPO, the 90th percentile lies at 14.2 IU/ml. The lower limit of the equivocal
range was chosen to be at least equal to lowest positive calibrator (25 IU/mL). The upper
cut-off value was calculated as 35 IU/mL (25 IU/ml x 1.4).
For both assays, the cut-off and the equivocal range were supported by the findings of the
clinical study and the correlation to the predicate device assay.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
