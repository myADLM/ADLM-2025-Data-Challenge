--- Page 3 ---
For use with the VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact Systems
The following limitations are included in the device labeling:
“One non-susceptible isolate of C. glabrata gave a susceptible MIC result, a potential very major
error.”
“The ability of VITEK 2 AST-YS to detect resistance to caspofungin is unknown because non-
susceptible strains were not available for comparative testing. Isolates yielding caspofungin MIC
results suggestive of a “non-susceptible” category (>2 µg/mL) should be submitted to a reference
laboratory for further testing.”
I. Device Description:
The VITEK® 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling dilution
technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK® 2 test card
contains 64 microwells. A control well containing only culture medium is included on all cards, with
the remaining wells containing premeasured amounts of a specific antimicrobial agent in a culture
medium base. A suspension of organism from a pure culture is prepared in a tube containing 0.45-
0.5% sterile saline and standardized to a McFarland 0.5 using the DensiCHEK Plus™. The VITEK 2
System automatically fills, seals and places the card into the incubator/reader; manual methods can
also be used for the inoculation of test cards for use in the VITEK 2 System The VITEK 2 Compact has
a manual filling, sealing and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well
in the card over a defined period of time. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is
generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each
antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-YST Caspofungin has the following concentrations in the card: 0.125, 0.5, 2 and 8 μg/mL
(equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL). The MIC result range for the
VITEK 2 AST-YST Caspofungin card is ≤ 0.12 - >8µg/mL.

optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Periodic
light transmittance samplings of the same well measure organism growth by how much light is
prevented from going through the well. Several parameters based on the growth characteristics
observed are used to provide appropriate input for the MIC calculations. Discriminate analysis is
used to develop the algorithm that determines the susceptibility result for all antimicrobials on the
VITEK® 2 System. The MIC result must be linked to organism identification in order to determine a
category interpretation. A category interpretation (SIR) will be reported along with each MIC result.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility studies were performed on the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact using both
automatic dilution and manual dilution for panel inoculation. With each inoculation/reading
methodology, the mode MIC was determined for each isolate and the reproducibility was
calculated based on MIC values falling within ± 1 dilution of the mode MIC.
Testing using VITEK 2 and automatic dilution was performed at a total of four sites using 18
isolates representing species included in the intended use. Best case and worst case
reproducibility for VITEK 2 with automatic dilution demonstrated acceptable performance at
96.7% and 95.3%, respectively.
Testing using VITEK 2 and manual dilution was performed using 10 Candida isolates tested
at three sites. There were no off-scale results; best and worst case reproducibility was
acceptable at 96.3%
Reproducibility studies were also performed using manual dilution and the Compact option
using ten Candida strains tested at three sites. There were no off-scale results; best case
and worst case reproducibility was acceptable at 98.9%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Inoculum density control was monitored using the DensiCHEK Plus™ instrument. The
DensiCHEK Plus™ was standardized weekly with all results recorded and in expected range.
A purity check of all organisms was performed at the time of VITEK 2 card inoculation. Only
results obtained with pure cultures were evaluated.
Quality control testing was conducted throughout comparative testing at each site using
two recommended quality control strains: Candida krusei (ATCC 6258) and Candida
5

parapsilosis (ATCC 22019). In those instances where the test result was out-of-range for all
replicates of the reference method, all data from that day’s testing was considered invalid
and the testing for that day was repeated.
The QC organisms were tested a minimum of 20 times with the reference method and with
VITEK 2 (manual and automatic dilution) and with the Compact option using manual
dilution. QC results were interpreted after 24 hours of incubation. QC results for the VITEK
2 AST-YS Caspofungin were within the expected results range 100% of the time for both
instrument platforms and both dilution methods. A summary of the QC performance is
provided in Table 2 below.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Results obtained with the bioMérieux VITEK2 AST-YS card with caspofungin were compared
to results obtained with the reference frozen broth microdilution panel. The VITEK 2 AST-YS
Caspofungin card contains the following concentrations: 0.125, 0.5, 2, and 8 µg/mL
(Equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL). The MIC result range for
the VITEK 2 card is 0.125 – 8 µg/mL. The frozen reference panel contained two-fold serial
dilutions with a range of 0.0156 – 32 µg/mL.
Test inocula were standardized using the DensiCHEK Plus instrument. VITEK 2 AST-YS cards
were inoculated using automatic dilution (for reading on the VITEK 2 instrument) or using a
manual method (for reading on the VITEK 2 instrument or the VITEK 2 COMPACT
instrument). Reference panels were inoculated as outlined in CLSI M27-A3.
A total of 755 clinical isolates were evaluated at three sites with VITEK 2 cards inoculated by
automatic dilution and interpreted using the VITEK 2 instrument. The majority of isolates
were fresh and recent isolates; 40 clinical isolates (5.3%) were stock isolates.
A total of 111 challenge isolates were tested at one site. The challenge set was tested with
both of the card inoculation options, automatic dilution and manual dilution, on the VITEK 2
System and with the manual dilution on the VITEK 2 Compact System.
For isolates interpreted using the VITEK 2 System and inoculated using the automatic
dilution option, the combined results from clinical and challenge testing demonstrated a
combined EA of 99.7% and CA of 99.8% (Table 3). A total of 145 isolates were determined to
be evaluable; the EA of evaluable isolates was determined to 98.6%. Two isolates of C.
glabrata were determined to be non-susceptible by the reference method but susceptible
by VITEK 2. Because the FDA Reference List Drug Label for caspofungin lists only a
susceptible breakpoint (susceptible ≤ 2 µg/mL and non-susceptible > 2 µg/mL) these two
isolates would be considered potential very major errors. Analysis of results from one of the
two C. glabrata isolates indicated a contaminated culture; the sponsor chose not to remove
results of this isolate from the performance determination; however, according to FDA’s
7

--- Page 8 ---
current policy this isolate was not considered to be a potential very major error due to the
technical error. The sponsor was asked to add the following limitation to the device
labeling:
“One non-susceptible isolate of C. glabrata gave a susceptible MIC result, a potential very
major error.”
For challenge isolates tested with the VITEK 2 System and inoculated using the manual
dilution method, the results from challenge testing demonstrated an EA and CA of 100%
(Table 4).
For challenge isolates tested with the VITEK 2 Compact System and inoculated using the
manual dilution method, the results from challenge testing demonstrated an EA and CA of
100% (Table 5).
Because a limited number of non-susceptible isolates were evaluated, the sponsor was
asked to include the following limitation in their device labeling:
“The ability of VITEK 2 AST-YS to detect resistance to caspofungin is unknown because non-
susceptible strains were not available for comparative testing. Isolates yielding caspofungin
MIC results suggestive of a “non-susceptible” category (>2 µg/mL) should be submitted to a
reference laboratory for further testing.”
