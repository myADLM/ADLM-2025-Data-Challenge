H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
BD BACTEC Peds Plus /F culture vials (enriched Soybean-Casein Digest broth with
CO ) are for aerobic blood cultures. Principal use is with the BD BACTEC fluorescent
2
series instruments for the qualitative culture and recovery of aerobic microorganisms
(mainly bacteria and yeast) from pediatric and non-pediatric blood specimens which are
generally less than 5 mL in volume.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription Use
• Some organisms may be dependent on having a minimum amount of blood in the
medium for optimal growth. Fastidious organisms, such as certain Haemophilus
species, require growth factors from the blood specimen, such as NAD, or factor
V. Optimal growth of these organisms is dependent on having greater than 0.5 mL
blood in the specimen. If the blood specimen volume is very small (0.5mL or less)
an appropriate supplement may be required for recovery of these organisms.
• Studies have demonstrated that the resins present in this medium do not
adequately neutralize meropenem preparations.
Based on the neutralization study with Candida albicans and Fluconazole, the
media showed some degree of neutralization; however the results were
inconclusive. The adequacy of antifungal neutralization by resins in the BD
BACTEC Peds Plus/F vial (plastic) is unknown.
• The default 5-day (120 hours) protocol was utilized for all analytical testing with
the BACTEC Peds Plus/F culture media and protocol lengths of >5 days have not
been evaluated.
4. Special instrument requirements:
BACTEC fluorescent series instruments BACTEC FX, BACTEC FX40, BACTEC 9240
and BACTEC 9050 and were evaluated using software versions listed below:

I. Device Description
The blood sample to be tested is inoculated into one or more vials which are inserted into the
BACTEC fluorescent series instrument for incubation and periodic reading. Each vial
contains a chemical sensor which can detect increases in CO produced by the growth of
2
microorganisms. The sensor is monitored by the instrument every ten minutes for an increase
in its fluorescence, which is proportional to the amount of CO present. A positive reading
2
indicates the presumptive presence of viable microorganisms in the vial. Detection is limited
to microorganisms that will grow in a particular type of culture medium.

L. Test Principle:
The BD BACTEC Peds Plus /F medium is an enriched soybean- casein digest broth, with
each vial containing 40 mL of broth. Sodium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) is added to the
medium as an anticoagulant that inhibits bacteriocidal activities in the blood. The
concentration of SPS has been adjusted to accommodate the low blood volumes of 0.5- 5.0
mL per vial.
Each BD BACTEC Peds Plus/F culture vial contains a chemical sensor in a silicon rubber
base that can detect increases in CO produced by the growth of microorganisms. Low
2
volume (0.5- 5 mL) of blood is inoculated into the BD BACTEC Peds Plus/F blood culture
vial, which is inserted into the BD BACTEC Fluorescent Series instrument for incubation,
agitation and periodic measurement. When microorganisms are present in the blood sample,
they metabolize nutrients in the culture medium, releasing CO into the medium. A dye in the
2
sensor reacts with the CO , modulating the amount of light that is absorbed by the fluorescent
2
material in the sensor. The instrument’s photo detectors monitor the sensor every 10 minutes
and measure the level of fluorescence, which is proportional to the amount of CO present in
2
the vial. Positivity of a vial is determined by algorithms resident in the instrument rack’s
microprocessor. The algorithms use the rate of CO production as well as the absolute
2
increase in CO to interpret the data.

end of protocol (120 hours).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The BACTEC Peds Plus/F (plastic) vial was evaluated across three lots in the Time
To Detection (TTD) and the Percent Recovery studies. Different lots of key raw
materials were used to manufacture each lot of culture media.
The results stratified by lot (combining blood volumes, inoculum levels, organisms,
and instruments) are shown in Table 2.
Table 2: Positive Percent Recovery and Time To Detection by Lots
Plastic lot Total # Positive Percent Recovery Median TTD (hrs)
1 448 89.06% 20.025
2 448 91.74% 20.445
3 448 90.4% 20.325
The analysis was acceptable and there was no statistically significant difference
across the lots in the precision study.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality Control
An internal validation study across three lots with inoculum at 10-100 CFU per vial
was conducted using the organisms listed below. Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria
meningitidis, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus
pneumoniae, and Alcaligenes faecalis were evaluated by testing 18 vials for each;
Streptococcus pyogenes and Escherichia coli were evaluated by testing 21 vials each;
Staphylococcus aureus was evaluated by testing six vials. All organisms were
detected <72 hours, with mean ranges between 7.5 (Streptococcus pyogenes) to 37.7
hours (Neisseria meningitidis).

d. Detection limit:
The microbial detection limit study was conducted to assess the capability of the
culture media to detect low numbers of organisms (expected target level of 0-1 and 1-
10 CFU/vial) when present in blood. The study included 15 organisms (12 bacteria
and 3 yeast strains) tested at two blood volumes, each at challenging target inoculum
levels of 0-1and 1-10 CFU/vial across three lots with BACTEC FX and BACTEC
9240:
15 org x 2 blood vol x 2 inoculum levels x 3 lots x 2 instrument types = 360
For statistical analysis, 95% two-sided bootstrap confidence intervals for differences
were used. The results were stratified by organism and are shown in Table 3.

At the low target inoculum level of 1-10 CFU/vial, there were:
• Three Haemophilus parainfluenzae recovery failures with four CFUs on the
subculture plate in both modified plastic and predicate glass vials
• One Neisseria meningitidis recovery failure with five CFUs on the subculture
plate in the modified plastic vial.
Both organisms are included in the limitation section of the Package Insert.
Recommendation for each is included. For N. meningitidis, there were no recovery
failures with the higher volume of 5 mL of blood. For H. parainfluenzae, see “False
Negatives” section below for details.
Data was also evaluated at target inoculum level of 0-1and 1-10 CFU/vial across two
blood volumes (0.5 and 5.0mL) in the Time to Detection (TTD) study as shown in
Table 4.

2. Comparison studies:
Performance of the BD BACTEC Peds Plus/F (plastic) blood culture vials was evaluated
in seeded internal analytical studies to demonstrate comparable performance to the
predicate device, the BD BACTEC Peds Plus/F (glass) blood culture vials. Comparison
results were acceptable. The comparisons were made using the following parameters:
Time to detection, percent recovery, false negative rate, false positive rate and
antimicrobial neutralization capability. For statistical analysis, 95% two-sided bootstrap
confidence intervals for differences were used.
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Instrument Time to Detection (TTD) study
The TTD analysis was evaluated in the combined Percent recovery and the Microbial
Detection Limit studies using the BD BACTEC FX and 9240 instruments at three
inoculum levels, across two blood volumes (0.5 mL and 5.0 mL) over three media lots.
The Percent Recovery study represented the standard inoculum of 10 to 100 CFU per vial
and the Microbial Detection Limit study represented the challenge inoculum levels of 0
to 1 and 1 to 10 CFU per vial. The performance is demonstrated in Table 5.

favoring the modified plastic vial. The TTD study demonstrated that the modified plastic
device performed equivalently when compared to the predicate glass device.
Recovery (Detection) Study
The percent recovery (detection) was evaluated in a study of 984 paired sets at the
standard inoculum level of 10- 100 CFU/vial on four instruments across three lots using a
diverse set of microorganisms frequently isolated in blood. Of the 984 paired sets, 953
sets recovered organisms in both the plastic vial and the glass vial and 18 were negative
by both vials. Nine paired sets were recovered in the plastic vials but not in the glass vials
and four were recovered in the glass vials but not in the plastic vials. The performance is
demonstrated in Table 6A and 6B.

False Positive Rates (Instrument-positive, subculture-negative)
False positivity was assessed with vials inoculated with fresh human blood of 0.5, 3, and
5 mL, but no organisms were added to the vials. There were a total of 288 pair sets
across three lots using BACTEC FX and BACTEC 9240 to be completed at the protocol
of 120 hours incubation.
48 vials x 3 lots x 2 instruments= 288 vials per device
No instrument false positive signals were detected. The modified device performed
equivalently when compared to the predicate device in the false positive study.

False Negative Rates (Instrument-negative, subculture positive)
All inoculated paired sets (1344; 984+ 360) that were instrument negative at the end of
protocol (120 hours) were subcultured onto appropriate culture media plates. This
combined data set was evaluated for the false negative rates. A false negative is a vial
that was instrument-negative at the end of protocol yet contains viable organisms upon
subculturing onto appropriate culture media. There were a total of 83 paired sets where
both the modified and the predicate devices were negative at 120 hours; there were 46
sets where the predicate device only detected (i.e. 46 plastic vials subcultured) and 66
vials where the new device detected (i.e. 63 glass vials subcultured, 3 vials discarded
inadvertently).
(83x2) + 46 + 63 =275
Of the 275 vials subcultured, 129 were plastic vials and 146 were glass vials. There were
20 false negatives (1.49%, 20/1344) from the plastic vials and 25 false negatives (1.86%,
25/1344) from the glass vials. There was no significant difference in false negative rates
between the predicate and the modified devices. The false negative rates with 95% CI
were demonstrated in Table 7.

(20/1344) (25/1344)
The majority of the false negatives were Haemophilus species with 0.5 mL of bagged
blood added. The Haemophilus species were detected at target inoculum of 1-10, 10-100
CFU with increased volume of 5 mL blood. Further, the original set of Haemophilus
species were re-tested with 0.5mL of fresh blood and all detected in both vials.
The Haemophilus species false negatives are noted in the limitations section of the
Package Insert (PI). The recommended limitation states: “If the blood specimen volume
is very small (0.5 mL or less), an appropriate supplement may be required for recovery of
these organisms.”
BD BACTEC Instrument Compatibility Study
The BACTEC instrument compatibility study was evaluated from the Percent Recovery
study (i.e. 984 paired sets) dataset across four fluorescent- series instruments: BD
BACTEC FX, FX40, 9240, and 9050. The study included 0.5 and 5.0mL of blood at
inoculum level of 10-100CFU per vial. There were 953 sets recovered organisms in both
the plastic vial and the glass vial and the Time To Detection (TTD) comparison between
the modified plastic and the predicate glass vials was evaluated. The performance data is
shown in in Table 8.

The study demonstrated that the four instruments performed equivalently and they are
compatible.
Antimicrobial Neutralization Capability
The study was to demonstrate the nonionic and cationic resins in the culture media to
enhance the recovery of organisms by adsorption of commonly used antibiotics in the
blood samples. The non-resin vials, BACTEC Standard /10 Aerobic/F were inoculated at
the same time to demonstrate the antimicrobial activity (no growth) in the vial. Eleven
antimicrobials representative of their classes were evaluated at the MIC level of selected
organisms. The antimicrobials evaluated were: Meropenem, Gentamicin, Ciprofloxacin,
Clindamycin, Vancomycin, Cefazolin, Cefoxitin, Cefotaxime, Cefepime,
Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Fluconazole. The performance data is shown in Table 9.

The study indicated some degree of neutralization with Candida albicans and
fluconazole. However, the results were inconclusive for the antifungal neutralization in
the BACTEC Peds Plus/F culture media. The statement below is included in the
limitation section of the PI:
“Based on the neutralization study with Candida albicans and Fluconazole, the media
showed some degree of neutralization; however the results were inconclusive. The
adequacy of antifungal neutralization by resins in the BD BACTEC Peds Plus/F vial
(plastic) is unknown.”
E. coli is intrinsically resistant to clindamycin and the result was as expected. The
modified device performed equivalently when compared to the predicate device during
antimicrobial neutralization evaluation.
b. Matrix comparison:
In seeded analytical studies, the performance of BD BACTEC Peds Plus/F culture
medium in plastic vial was compared to that in glass vial, with two human blood
volumes, 15 common blood bloodstream pathogens (bacteria and yeast) across four
fluorescent series instruments: BACTEC FX, FX40, BACTEC 9240, and BACTEC
9050.
3. Clinical studies:
Not applicable; seeded analytical studies to compare the new plastic blood culture vials to
the glass blood culture vials (predicate).
