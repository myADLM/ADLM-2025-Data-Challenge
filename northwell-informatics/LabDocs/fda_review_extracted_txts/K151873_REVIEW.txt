microorganisms as tested on agar media using overnight incubation.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Etest® is a quantitative technique for determining the antimicrobial susceptibility
testing of both non-fastidious Gram-negative and Gram positive aerobic bacteria
such as Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus
species and fastidious bacteria, such as anaerobes, N. gonorrhoeae, S.
pneumoniae, Streptococcus and Haemophilus species. The system comprises a
predefined antibiotic gradient which is used to determine the Minimum Inhibitory
Concentration (MIC), in µg/mL, of different antimicrobial agents against
microorganisms as tested on agar media using overnight incubation.
This submission is for the additional indications for the antimicrobial Etest
Ceftaroline at concentrations of 0.002 – 32 µg/mL. Etest® Ceftaroline has been
shown to be active in vitro against fastidious strains of the microorganisms listed
below, according to the FDA label for this antimicrobial agent:
Streptococcus pneumoniae
Streptococcus agalactiae
Haemophilus influenzae
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use
Isolates yielding MIC results other than “Susceptible” should be submitted to a
reference laboratory for further testing.

--- Page 3 ---
4. Special instrument requirements:
Manual readings only
I. Device Description:
Etest® consists of a thin, inert and non-porous plastic strip, 5mm wide and 60 mm
long. One side of the strip carries a two-letter code designating the identity of the
antibiotic and is calibrated with MIC values in terms of µg/mL. A predefined
exponential gradient of the dried and stabilized antibiotic covers a continuous
concentration range across 15 two-fold dilutions of a conventional MIC method. The
current FDA pharmaceutical drug label includes the following indicated fastidious
organisms:
[S. agalactiae (skin isolates only), S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae (Community
Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia isolates only)] S= < 0.5 µg/mL*
*The current absence of resistant isolates precludes defining any results other than
“Susceptible.” Isolates yielding MIC results other than “Susceptible” should be
submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.

CLSI M100-S24“Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing:
Twentieth Informational Supplement, January 2011”
L. Test Principle:
The Etest® gradient technology is based on a combination of the concepts of dilution
and diffusion test methods for susceptibility testing. Etest® directly quantifies
antimicrobial susceptibility in terms of discrete MIC values. When the Etest® strip is
applied to an inoculated agar plate, the antibiotic is immediately released from the
plastic surface into the agar. A predefined, continuous gradient of antibiotic
concentrations is created and maintained directly underneath the strip. After
incubation whereby bacterial growth becomes visible, a symmetrical inhibition ellipse
centered along the strip will be seen. The MIC value in µg/mL is read where the
ellipse edge intersects the strip. Since Etest® generates MIC values which fall
between two-fold dilutions for interpretation; the MIC value read must be recorded to
the next two-fold dilution.

Twenty-five isolates of each organism (Haemophilus influenzae,
Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were tested at three
external sites to determine site to site reproducibility. Results were within +/-
one doubling dilution agreement as compared to the mode MIC value of
Ceftaroline for all organisms at all sites and there were no off-scale results.
The results were acceptable and demonstrated ≥ 95% reproducibility.

2. Comparison studies:
Clinical testing was performed at three external and one internal sites. There were
694 clinical isolates, of which 225 were stock (31.7%), and a challenge set of 50
isolates of each organism claimed (H. influenzae, S. agalactiae and S.
pneumoniae). A total of 150 challenge isolates was evaluated.
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The CLSI recommended broth dilution reference panel was prepared and
interpreted according to CLSI recommendations with the following
modification: broth microdilution panels were read at 18 hours as indicated in
the FDA approved pharmaceutical drug label for Ceftaroline. The 18 hour
incubation is required due to degradation of Ceftaroline activity when
incubation extends to 24 hours. Panels were re-incubated and read at 23 hours
per the CLSI recommendation of 20-24 hour incubation.
Etest was performed following Table 1 (Recommended Media and Inoculum)
of the Generic Package Insert: Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus
agalactiae were inoculated onto Mueller Hinton agar + 5% blood;
Haemophilus influenzae isolates were inoculated onto HTM agar media.
Isolated colonies from an overnight agar plate were emulsified in Mueller
Hinton or HTM broth to achieve the specified inoculum turbidity compared to
a 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard. In this submission, the suspension
prepared in broth was used within 15 minutes of preparation. Testing
conditions consisted of incubation at 35°C; 5% CO for 20-24 hours. All

isolates grew in the clinical and challenge studies.
The clinical testing included both fresh clinical isolates and stock isolates
along with a challenge set with known results. The following footnote was
added to the package insert:
"Refer to the FDA approved pharmaceutical antimicrobial agent package
insert for interpreting and reporting results of Ceftaroline which has been
shown to be active against the following organisms/corresponding clinical
infections: Streptococcus agalactiae (skin infections isolates only), S.
pneumoniae and H. influenzae (community acquired bacterial pneumonia
isolates only)”.
A comparison was provided to the reference method with the following
agreement (Tables 3 through 6).

Essential agreement (EA) is when the Etest® results agree with the reference
test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference
method. Category agreement (CA) is when the Etest® result interpretation
agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation.
The overall combined %EA and %CA consistently meet the acceptance
criteria of greater than or equal to 90%.
MIC Trends:
Using the data provided by the sponsor in the diagonal table format recommended
in the AST Guidance, an analysis was conducted to check for trending in MIC
values.
A higher reading trend was observed in the overall performance of S. agalactiae, S.
pneumoniae and H. influenzae compared to the CLSI broth micro-dilution method
when read at 18 hours and 23 hours, as summarized in Tables 7 and 8 below
respectively.

The MIC results read at 18 hour were higher by one or more doubling
dilution as follows: 43.4% (120/276) for S. agalactiae, 47.3% (134/283) for S.
pneumoniae, and 42.8% (122/285) for H. influenzae. The MIC results read at
23 hours were higher by one or more doubling dilution as follows: 38.4%
(106/276) for S. agalactiae, 43.8% (124/283) for S. pneumoniae, and 37.5%
(107/285) for H. influenzae”.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not Applicable
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not Applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not Applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not Applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not Applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Organism and Infection Source Interpretive Criteria
Streptococcus agalactiae (skin isolates only)
Streptococcus pneumoniae (CABP* isolates only) S= < 0.5 µg/mL**
Haemophilus influenzae (CABP isolates only)
*Community Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia
**The current absence of resistant isolates precludes defining any results other
than “Susceptible.” Isolates yielding MIC results other than “Susceptible” should
be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.
The Interpretative criteria, QC isolates and the expected ranges are the same as
recommended by the CLSI and the FDA. All values will be included in the
package insert.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
