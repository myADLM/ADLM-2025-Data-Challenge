I. Device Description:
The ARIES® HSV 1 & 2 Assay is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based qualitative in vitro
diagnostic test for the direct detection and differentiation of herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA
from cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesion swab specimens.
The cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesion swab specimens are collected in Copan Universal
Transport Medium and transported to the laboratory. The specimen is pipetted into a cassette
specific to the ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay. In the cassette, the specimen is lysed and nucleic acid
is extracted using the HSV 1&2 Assay Kit and ARIES® System. An extractable sample
processing control (SPC) target is present in the ARIES® HSV 1&2 assay cassette and is
processed with the specimen. The Ct value of the SPC serves to verify proper specimen lysis
and nucleic acid extraction, to identify PCR inhibition, if any, and verify proper function of the
extraction system and real-time instrument. The Tm value of the SPC is used as a reference for
determining the target Tm.
The extracted nucleic acid is transferred via magnetic beads to the ARIES® HSV 1 & 2 Kit
lyophilized PCR reagents in the cassette that contain a primer pair specific to HSV 1 and HSV 2
and a primer pair specific to the SPC sequence. The specific primer pairs are labeled with
distinct fluorophore labels. PCR amplification is performed and assay fluorescence is monitored
on the ARIES® System. Incorporation of the quencher-labeled nucleotide causes a decrease in
assay fluorescence. Following amplification, the reaction is slowly heated and fluorescence is
monitored. The strands of the amplification products will separate at a specific melting
temperature (Tm) that is determined by an increase in fluorescence as the strands are separated.
The sequences between the PCR primer binding sites of the HSV 1 and HSV 2 amplicons have
different base compositions that are distinguished by their different Tm values. The instrument
2

--- Page 3 ---
fluorescence output is analyzed and test results are determined using the ARIES® HSV 1 & 2
Kit assay protocol file. Total assay time, including extraction and PCR cycling, takes
approximately two hours. A printed results report is generated.
The ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay consists of two kits:
· ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay Cassette Kit - contains 24 assay cassettes which contain the
necessary reagents for sample extraction, nucleic acid purification and amplification.
· ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay Protocol File Kit - contains the assay protocol file, package
insert and Quick Guide which ship separately on a USB flash drive as part of the ARIES®
HSV 1&2 Assay Protocol File Kit.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): N/A
L. Test Principle:
The ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay chemistry is based on an expanded genetic alphabet technology,
using the synthetic DNA base pair 2'-deoxy-5-methyl-isocytidine (iC): 2'-deoxyisoguanosine
(iG). The isobases (iC and iG) pair specifically with each other and not with natural nucleotides.
In addition, isobases are efficiently incorporated during PCR. During PCR amplification, a
quencher-modified iGTP is incorporated by the polymerase opposite an iC and a fluorophore
reporter attached to a PCR primer. If the target is present and is amplified, assay fluorescence
decreases with every cycle as amplification product accumulates. The decrease in assay
fluorescence is monitored in real time using the Luminex ARIES® Instrument. Following PCR,
the amplification products are thermally denatured and assay fluorescence is monitored. The
strands of the amplification products are separated and assay fluorescence increases, thus
determining the melting temperature (Tm) profile of the amplicon. The sequences between the PCR
primer binding sites of the HSV-1 and HSV-2 amplicons have different base compositions that are
distinguished by their different melting temperatures using the ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay Analysis
Software.
The specimen is added to the sample chamber of an ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay cassette. The
cassette is then placed into an ARIES® System magazine. A magazine can hold up to six
cassettes. The magazine is inserted into an ARIES® System, which can process two magazines
simultaneously. A barcode on top of the HSV 1&2 Assay cassette is automatically scanned by the
ARIES® System, associating a preloaded ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay protocol file with the
cassette. The HSV 1&2 Assay protocol file contains the necessary parameters to run the cassette,
analyze data, and generate reports.
Once a run is started, the Sample Processing Control (SPC) is automatically added to the sample
chamber of the cassette to control for sample lysis, recovery of extracted nucleic acid, detection
of inhibitory substances, and confirmation of PCR reagent integrity. Sample and SPC lysis, as
well as isolation and purification of nucleic acids, are automated within the ARIES® System and
the ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay cassette. Purified nucleic acids are automatically transferred to the

a. Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay was evaluated by testing one lot of
ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay Cassettes on two ARIES® instruments by two operators at each
of three sites on five non-consecutive days.
The panel members were formulated with a single target present (HSV-1 MacIntyre
strain or HSV-2 MS strain) at three concentrations: moderate positive (4 X LoD for both
HSV 1 and HSV 2), low positive (1 X LoD for both HSV 1 and HSV 2), and high
negative (0.1 X LoD for HSV 1 and 0.4 X LoD for HSV 2). A true negative sample,
where no HSV was added, was also prepared using viral transport medium. Each panel

d. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality Control
Each ARIES® assay cassette contains a Sample Process Control (SPC), which is
processed with the sample and analyzed during the amplification reaction. The SPC
verifies sample lysis, nucleic acid extraction, and proper reagent, cassette, ARIES®
System, and assay protocol performance. The SPC has a known melting temperature
(Tm) range and Ct range. Each time an assay is run, the system measures the
temperature and fluorescence intensity of the SPC control to ensure the thermal and
optical subsystems have remained in calibration.
External Controls
External controls should be tested according to guidelines or requirements of local,
provincial and/or federal regulations or accreditation organizations. A reference
HSV 1 and HSV 2 strain or well characterized HSV 1 and HSV 2 clinical isolates
may be used as positive controls. Universal Viral Transport Medium may be used as
a negative control. The Luminex ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay Cassette Kit does not
include external positive and negative control.
e. Detection limit:
A Limit of Detection (LoD) study was performed to evaluate the analytical
sensitivity of the ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay using two representative strains of HSV 1
(MacIntyre and F) and two representative strains of HSV 2 (MS & G). Preliminary
LoD concentrations were determined by performing a six-point, five-fold dilution
series in Copan Universal Transport Media of each quantified (TCID50/mL) strain.
The observed LoD of a HSV strain was determined as the lowest concentration that
had a positivity rate of ≥ 95%.
The LoD concentrations determined in the preliminary study were confirmed with
the same HSV 1 and HSV 2 reference strains diluted to the preliminary LoD

strains based on the final assay LoD claim.
f. Analytical specificity:
A study was performed to evaluate cross reactivity and interference of the ARIES®
HSV 1&2 Assay with 61 microorganisms that might be found in cutaneous and
mucocutaneous lesion specimens. The effect of potential cross reactivity or
interference was evaluated by testing five replicates of each HSV 1, HSV 2 near the
device’s Limit of Detection (LoD), and negative replicates (Copan UTM) spiked with
6
61 potential cross reacting organisms. Bacteria were tested at 10 cfu/ml or higher for
5
bacteria and 10 pfu/ml or higher for viruses. At the tested concentrations of the
organisms, the organisms do not cross react or interfere with the assay. All HSV
positive results were 100% positive and all HSV negative results were 100% negative.

g. Interfering Studies
This study was performed to evaluate potential interference with the ARIES® HSV
1&2 Assay with a panel of twenty-eight (28) potential interfering substances. All of
the potentially interfering substances were tested at concentrations at or above
physiological levels or typical usage levels with HSV 1 (MacIntyre) and HSV 2 (MS)
strains. The study was carried out in the presence of HSV 1 and HSV 2 near the
device’s limit of detection (LoD) to evaluate potential interference with the detection
of the HSV 1 and HSV 2 targets. Each potentially interfering substance was tested in
5 replicates of each HSV 1, HSV 2, and negative samples (Copan UTM). All HSV
positive results were 100% positive and all negative results were 100% negative. No
interference was observed with any of the substances tested.

h. Specimen Stability in Universal Transport Media
Fresh Specimen Stability:
The performance of the ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay was assessed for fresh specimen
stability when stored at 2 – 8°C. The stability was assessed by testing 6 replicates of
each of 7 HSV target concentrations across 6 different time points. The contrived
specimens were prepared by spiking cultured organism into the negative clinical
matrix (Copan Universal Transport Medium) at different levels. The concentrations
tested were a moderate positive, low positive and high negative for HSV 1 and HSV 2
as well as a negative concentration. Moderate positive specimens gave the expected
result of 100% positivity, low positive specimens gave the expected result of
approximately 95% positivity (HSV 1: 97.2% positive and HSV 2 100% positive) and
high negative specimens gave the expected result of 20 – 80% positivity (HSV 1:
25.0% positive and HSV 2: 63.8% positive). Negative specimens gave the expected
result of 100% negativity. The data from this stability study support the claim in the
package insert that the fresh specimens for the ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay can be held
at 2 - 8°C for up to 15 days.
Frozen Specimen Stability:
The objective of the frozen specimen stability was to evaluate the stability of
specimens when stored at -65°C to -95°C. This was assessed by testing 6 replicates of
each of 7 HSV contrived target concentrations in Copan Universal Transport Medium
across 7 different time points extending out to 12 months. The concentrations used for
testing were a moderate positive, low positive and high negative concentration for
HSV 1 and HSV 2 as well as a negative specimen. The data up to 3 months has been
collected with all targets yielding the expected result. Moderate positive specimens
are 100% positive, low positive specimens are positive approximately 95% of the
time, high negative specimens are positive 20 – 80% of the time and negative
specimens are negative 100% of the time. The specimens are stable for up to 3
months when stored at -65°C to -95°C.
Note: The package insert claims that the specimens can be stored refrigerated at 2°C to
8°C for up to 15 days from the date of collection; if specimens will be used after 15
days from the date of collection, they should be stored frozen at ≤ -70°C.
i. Reagent Stability:
The objective of ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay Cassette real time stability testing was to
evaluate the stability of ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay Cassette in order to establish a
shelf life. This was assessed by testing 4 replicates of HSV 1, 4 replicates of HSV 2
and 4 replicates of negative (Copan UTM) targets on three different lots of ARIES®
HSV 1&2 Assay Cassettes stored at 2 different temperatures (2 – 8°C and 25°C) at 10
different time points extending out to 19 months. Data up to 3 months has been
collected and to date all targets for all lots and all storage temperatures have given the
15

--- Page 16 ---
expected result. HSV 1 replicates are 100% HSV 1 Positive, HSV 2 replicates are
100% HSV 2 Positive and negative replicates are 100% HSV 1&2 Negative.
Therefore, ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay Cassettes are stable for 3 months when stored
at both 4°C and Room Temperature (25°C).
j. Co-infection
A study was designed to evaluate the ability of the ARIES®HSV 1&2 Assay to detect
HSV-1 and HSV-2 analytes when both are present in one specimen. Analytes were
tested at high (200X LoD) and low concentrations (5X LoD) using 12 replicates. The
ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay may not detect a co-infection of HSV 1 and HSV 2 in cases
where the two virus types are not equally represented in clinical specimens. Co-
infections were only detected when both analytes were present at 200X LoD. An
HSV analyte at 5X LoD was not detected in the presence of a different HSV analyte
at 200X LoD.
k. Carry-over/Cross Contamination
Carry-over and cross contamination for the ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay was assessed by
testing fifteen (15) high positive HSV 1 samples, 15 high positive HSV 2 samples and
thirty (30) HSV negative samples (Copan UTM). Samples were tested in an
alternating pattern with high positive samples run adjacent to negative samples across
ten (10) consecutive runs. No carry-over and cross contamination was observed. The
overall percent agreement was 100% for positive and negative samples.
l. Assay cut-off: Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The clinical performance evaluation was performed against a gold standard/reference
method i.e., Cell Culture using an enzyme linked virus inducible system with HSV
typing by fluorescently labeled antibodies.
b. Matrix comparison: N/A
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity: N/A
b. Clinical Specificity: N/A
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The performance of the ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay was compared with the ELVIS®
HSV ID/Typing Test System (Diagnostic Hybrid, Inc.) which is a gold
16

--- Page 17 ---
standard/reference method i.e., Cell Culture using an enzyme linked virus inducible
system with HSV typing by fluorescently labeled antibodies.
Clinical Performance
The clinical performance of the ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay was assessed at three (3)
geographically diverse clinical sites in the United States. A total of 1963 left-over
clinical specimens from symptomatic male and female patients were included in the
clinical study. Of these, 1500 specimens were prospectively collected (all comers).
The remaining 463 were pre-selected for cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesion types
that were under-represented in the initial prospective sample set. Additional oral and
nasal lesions specimen lesion were also tested. All of the pre-selected specimens
were also prospectively collected. Of the 1963 specimens tested, fifty-five (55)
specimens were lesion sources from anatomical sites that could not be determined,
four (4) specimens remained invalid upon re-testing by the ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay
and three were unavailable for re-testing. All of these 62 specimens were excluded
from the clinical performance analysis.
The reference/comparative method used to evaluate the clinical performance of the
ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay was the ELVIS® HSV-ID and D3 Typing Test System.
Because the ELVIS method provides no information on HSV 1 patient infected status
(positive or negative) in specimens that test positive for HSV 2, all specimens that
were positive for HSV 2 by the ELVIS® HSV-ID and D3 Typing System were
excluded from the analysis of HSV 1 clinical performance.
A total of 448 cutaneous lesions specimens were tested. One hundred and one (101)
specimens that were positive for HSV 2 by the ELVIS® HSV-ID and D3 Typing
System were excluded from the analysis of HSV 1 clinical performance.
A total of 1453 mucocutaneous lesions specimens were tested. Two hundred and
sixty three (263) specimens that were positive for HSV 2 by the ELVIS® HSV-ID
and D3 Typing System were excluded from the analysis of HSV 1 clinical
performance.
The performance of ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay when compared to ELVIS® viral
culture is summarized for cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesions in the tables below.
