4. Special instrument requirements:
For use with the VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact Systems
I. Device Description:
The VITEK® 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the
doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).
Each VITEK® 2 test card contains 64 microwells. A control well containing only culture
medium is included on all cards, with the remaining wells containing premeasured amounts
of a specific antimicrobial agent in a culture medium base. A suspension of organism from a
pure culture is prepared in a tube containing 0.45-0.5% sterile saline and standardized to a
McFarland 0.5 using the DensiCHEK Plus™. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals
and places the card into the incubator/reader; manual methods can also be used for the
inoculation of test cards for use in the VITEK 2 System. The VITEK 2 Compact has a
manual filling, sealing and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of
each well in the card over a defined period of time. At the completion of the incubation
cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category
result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
The VITEK® 2 AST-Yeast Micafungin has the following concentrations in the card: 0.06,
0.25, 1 and 4 μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL). The
MIC result range for the VITEK® 2 card is ≤0.06-≥8 µg/ml.

L. Test Principle:
The VITEK® 2 System optics use visible light to directly measure organism growth. The
transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth
has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure organism growth
by how much light is prevented from going through the well. Several parameters based on
the growth characteristics observed are used to provide appropriate input for the MIC
calculations. Discriminate analysis is used to develop the algorithm that determines the
susceptibility result for all antimicrobials on the VITEK® 2 System. The MIC result must be
linked to organism identification in order to determine a category interpretation. A category
interpretation (SIR) will be reported along with each MIC result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility studies included both the auto- and manual dilution methods with the
VITEK 2 instrument system and the manual dilution method with the VITEK 2
Compact instrument system. With each inoculation method, the mode MIC was
determined for each isolate and the reproducibility was calculated based on MIC
values falling within ± 1 dilution of the mode MIC.
Testing using VITEK 2 and automatic dilution was performed using 10 Candida
isolates (four isolates of C. parapsilosis, two C. krusei, two C. norvegensis, and two
C. gulliermondii). Testing was done in triplicates at three clinical sites (two external
sites and one internal site) on three separate days. All MIC values were on-scale and
reproducibility demonstrated acceptable performance at 100%.
Initial studies using both the VITEK 2 and the VITEK 2 Compact and manual
dilution did not meet acceptable reproducibility performance particularly due to C.
guillermondii. Per FDA’s request, an additional study was performed using five
isolates of C. guillermondii with on-scale Micafungin MIC values. These isolates
were tested in triplicate on three separate days at three sites and included a total of 45
data points at each site. The best and worst case reproducibility for VITEK 2 and
VITEK 2 COMPACT using manual dilution were acceptable at 95.56% and 96.54%,
respectively.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

--- Page 6 ---
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Inoculum density control was monitored using the DensiCHEK Plus™ instrument.
The DensiCHEK Plus™ was standardized weekly with all results recorded and in
expected range.
A purity check of all organisms was performed at the time of VITEK 2 card
inoculation. Only results obtained with pure cultures were evaluated.
Quality control testing was conducted throughout comparative testing at each site
using two recommended quality control strains: Candida krusei (ATCC 6258) and
Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 22019). In those instances where the test result was
out-of-range for all replicates of the reference method, all data from that day’s testing
was considered invalid and the testing for that day was repeated.
The QC organisms were tested a minimum of 20 times with the reference method, the
VITEK 2 instrument platform (auto- and manual dilution methods), and with the
VITEK 2 Compact instrument platform using the manual dilution method. QC
results were interpreted after 24 hour of incubation. QC results for the VITEK 2 AST-
Yeast Micafungin were within the expected results range ≥ 99% of the time for both
instrument platforms and both dilution methods. A summary of the QC performance
is provided in Tables 1 below.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Results obtained with the bioMérieux VITEK2 AST-Yeast with Micafungin were
compared to results obtained with the reference frozen broth microdilution panel. The
VITEK2 AST Yeast Micafungin card contains the following concentrations: 0.25, 1,
and 4 µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL). The
MIC results range for the VITEK 2 card is ≤0.06 - ≥8µg/mL (eight dilutions). The
frozen reference panel included a dilution range of 0.0156 - 32µg/mL (12 dilutions).
Test inocula were standardized using the DensiCHEK Plus instrument. VITEK 2 AST
Yeast cards were inoculated using automatic dilution (for reading on the VITEK 2
instrument) or using a manual method (for reading on the VITEK 2 instrument or the
VITEK2 COMPACT instrument. Reference panels were inoculated as outlined in
CLSI M27-A3.
A total of 727 clinical isolates were evaluated at four sites (three external clinical sites
and one internal clinical site) with VITEK 2 cards inoculated by automatic dilution
and interpreted using the VITEK 2 instrument. The majority of the clinical isolates
were fresh. Only 38 clinical isolates (5.2%) were stock isolates.
A total of 97 challenge isolates were tested at one site. The challenge set was tested
with both of the card inoculation options, automatic and manual dilutions, on the
VITEK 2 System and with the manual dilution on the VITEK 2 Compact System.
Results are summarized in Tables 2-3 below.

Essential agreement was calculated for when the VITEK 2 system results were within
+/- two doubling dilutions of the reference method results. Category agreement was
calculated for when the VITEK 2 system result interpretations agreed exactly with the
reference method result interpretations. Evaluable results were defined as when both
the reference method results and the VITEK 2 system results were on-scale.
Evaluable results were also defined as when the reference method results were on-
scale and off-scale VITEK 2 system results clearly did not agree within the accepted
+/- two doubling dilutions

For challenge isolates tested with the VITEK 2 (auto and manual dilution) and the
VITEK 2 Compact Systems inoculated using the manual dilution method (Tables 2-3),
the overall CA is <90%. However, based on the AST Guidance, this was considered
acceptable because all the categorical errors were minor and the data shows good EA
of evaluable.
For clinical and challenge isolates of Candida spp for Micafungin using the VITEK 2
System, and the automatic dilution method (Table 2), the combined EA and CA met
acceptance criteria of greater than or equal to 90%. However, there was one very
major error in the clinical data of C. glabrata. The potential for occurrence of this
error was mitigated by adding the following limitation in the labeling:

“The ability of the AST card to detect resistance with the following combination(s) is
unknown because an insufficient number of resistant strains were available at the time

reference laboratory for further testing”.
Micafungin: Candida glabrata
MIC Trends:
Using the data provided by the sponsor in the diagonal table format recommended in
the AST Guidance, an analysis was conducted to check for trending in MIC values.
A higher reading trend was observed in the overall performance of C. albicans and C.
glabrata compared to the CLSI broth micro-dilution method, which raises concerns
for potential major errors as summarized in Table 6 below.

This trending and the potential for occurrence of major error(s) for Micafungin when
testing C. albicans and C. glabrata with VITEK2 was addressed in the labeling by
adding the following footnote under the interpretation table in labeling:
“VITEK®2 Micafungin MIC values for C. albicans and C. glabrata tended to be one
or more doubling dilution higher compared to reference broth microdilution”.
A lower reading trend was observed in the overall performance of C. krusei and C.
parapsilosis with both manual and automated inoculation methods compared to the
CLSI broth micro-dilution method, which raises concerns for potential very major
errors as summarized in Table 7 below.
