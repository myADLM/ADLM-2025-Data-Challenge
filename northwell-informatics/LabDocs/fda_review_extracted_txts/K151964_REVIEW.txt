Analyzer, used in combination with single-use PT/INR test strips, Xprecia™ System PT/INR
Strips, and Liquid Quality Controls (LQC), Xprecia™ System PT Controls.
The Xprecia™ System PT/INR Strip contains the Dade® Innovin® reagent which is a
preparation of purified recombinant human tissue factor combined with synthetic
phospholipids, calcium chloride, and stabilizers. When a blood sample is applied to the test
strip target area, the blood mixes with reagents and activates the coagulation cascade. The
clot time is determined by an algorithm and the result is displayed as INR.
The Xprecia™ System PT Controls kit contains assayed Liquid Quality Controls for the
assessment of precision and analytical bias in the normal (PT Control 1) and therapeutic (PT
Control 2) ranges for the prothrombin time (PT) to be used with the Xprecia™ System

that uses electrochemical technology to measure the prothrombin time from a fresh capillary
(fingerstick) whole blood sample. The fresh capillary (fingerstick) whole blood sample is
applied to the Xprecia™ System PT/INR test strips for testing. The Xprecia™ System PT/INR
Strip is inserted into the analyzer which applies a small voltage across the electrodes and
measures any resulting electrical current as a function of time. A sample chamber in the test
strip is filled with the blood sample by capillary action. The test strip contains Dade®
Innovin® which is a preparation of purified recombinant human tissue thromboplastin,
combined with synthetic phospholipids, calcium, stabilizers, and an electroactive thrombin
substrate. An electroactive group released from the thrombin substrate is detected
electrochemically at the electrodes in the test strip; the current produced is analyzed by an
algorithm to determine the coagulation time. The analyzer displays the International
Normalized Ratio (INR) on the screen.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Whole blood precision (Repeatability) across the measuring range was determined for
fingerstick (capillary) samples by analyzing them in duplicate. Repeatability was
evaluated across four (4) intended use sites using three (3) lots of Xprecia™ System
PT/INR test strips per site. The study was executed by a total of 14 operators
(minimum of three (3) at each site). The repeatability results passed acceptance
criteria. The table below shows the repeatability test results for combined sites:

Traceability
Each lot of Xprecia™ System PT/INR test strips is factory calibrated to a reference
lot of human recombinant thromboplastin traceable to the World Health Organization
International Reference Preparation.
Xprecia™ System PT/INR Strips Stability
Closed vial stability
The closed vial stability of 24 months shelf life was established at 5–30°C and up to
75% Relative Humidity (RH); by testing three (3) lots of the Xprecia™ System
PT/INR Strips. Testing for closed vial stability was performed at 2, 4, 9, 13, 17, 22,
26, 39, 53, 66, 79, 92, and 105 weeks after time zero (T0). The strips were incubated
at three (3) storage conditions (5, 25, and 30°C). Results are consistent with the
Xprecia™ System PT/INR Strips claim.
Open vial stability
The open vial stability of 2 months when stored between 5–30°C at up to 75 % RH
was substantiated by testing three (3) the Xprecia™ System PT/INR Strip lots over
69 days to verify the effect of the operator opening the strip vial multiple times to
remove and use the test strip under controlled temperature and relative humidity
conditions. Testing for open vial stability was performed at 5°C/ambient RH, 25°C at
60% RH and 30°C at 75% RH and opened 25 times over the duration of the study to
simulate in-use conditions. Results are consistent with the Xprecia™ System PT/INR
Strips claim.
Out of vial stability
The 5 minutes out of vial stability claim was established by using three (3) Xprecia™
System PT/INR Strip lots that were exposed to high temperature and humidity
conditions for various times up to 12.5 minutes. Single measurements of each test
strip were subsequently obtained at 0, 2.5 minutes, 5 minutes, 7.5 minutes, 10
minutes, and 12.5 minutes at a range of conditions 32.7 to 32.9°C and 83 to 89 % RH.
Results are consistent with the Xprecia™ System PT/INR Strips claim.
Transport stability
Transport stability was established by evaluating three (3) Xprecia™ System PT/INR
Strip lots tested under the following sequence of simulated transport conditions at 0,
12, 18 and 24 months after manufacturing:
a. Test strips stored for 12 hours at 25°C
b. Test strips stored for 74 hours at 30°C, for 46 hours at 35°C, and for 22 hours
at 40°C.
c. Test strips stored for 7 hours at 45°C, for 3 hours at 50°C, 3 hours at 55°C. 1
hour at 60°C, and for 1 hour at 65°C.
d. 3 x 1 day Freeze/Thaw (F/T) cycles: Product frozen at -20°C, thawed for 1
day at 2-8°C, and frozen again at -20°C, repeated three times.
All acceptance criteria for the transportation stability were met.

Xprecia™ System PT Controls
Stability
A stability study was conducted for the Xprecia™ System PT Controls using three (3)
lots each of Xprecia™ System PT Control 1, PT Control 2 and the calcium chloride
(CaCl ) reconstitution buffer. The shelf life for PT Control 1, PT Control 2 and the
2
reconstitution buffer was established as 12 months from the date of manufacture. The
stability of the reconstituted control solution was established as 60 minutes when
stored at 2–8°C, and 25 minutes when stored at 15–25°C. Results are consistent with
the Xprecia™ System PT Controls claim.
Value Assignment
Value assignment was performed by using three (3) vials of PT Controls (PT Control
1 and PT Control 2) from the same lot with three (3) Xprecia™ System PT/INR test
strip lots on three (3) Xprecia Stride™ Coagulation Analyzers, in two single
determinations. This resulted in 18 results for each control level (3 vials x 2
determinations x 3 analyzers/ strip lot combinations).
The mean of the 18 determinations are to be considered as the assigned value for the
PT Control.
d. Detection limit:
Factor sensitivity was assessed for coagulation factors II, V, VII, and X. The factor
sensitivity was determined using the nine (9) Xprecia Stride™ Coagulation
Analyzers, three (3) lots of Xprecia™ System PT/INR test strips, and normal human
red blood cells mixed with various concentrations of normal human plasma and the
applicable factor deficient plasma. Each level of factor sensitivity was carried out
twice on each analyzer. The study verifies factor sensitivity for the Xprecia™ System
PT/INR test strips at the following levels (% of normal factor level; in vitro testing):
Factor II <36%; Factor V <58%; Factor VII <52%; and Factor X <68%.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference Limits
Interference studies were performed for the following interferents: ascorbic acid,
acetaminophen, unconjugated bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, hemolysis, heparin, low
molecular weight heparin, triglycerides and uric acid. In addition, an interference
study was conducted to characterize the levels of other pharmaceuticals: oritavancin,
clopidogrel, fondaparinux, and daptomycin. Interference limits were established using
three (3) lots of Xprecia™ System PT/INR Strips tested on eight (8) analyzers each
using fresh citrated venous whole blood from both normal and warfarin blood
samples spiked separately with the interferents. The acceptance criteria for
interference effect of the aforementioned interferents were met. The interference
study results show that the following interferents do not interfere with test results up
to the concentrations shown:

Hematocrit
The hematocrit range was evaluated for the Xprecia Stride™ Coagulation Analyzer
using capillary samples from 282 patients across four intended use sites. Capillary
samples for INR determinations using the Xprecia Stride™ Coagulation System,
citrated plasma samples for the central laboratory INR using the Siemens BCS XP ,
and the measured EDTA venous whole blood hematocrit for each test subject were
used in the analysis. The %bias of the Xprecia Stride™ Coagulation System INR to
the BCS XP INR was calculated for each test subject and plotted against the
hematocrit for that test subject. Data analysis demonstrated that hematocrit range
between 22 – 52% does not significantly affect test results.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Accuracy was evaluated by comparing the Xprecia Stride™ Coagulation System
against the predicate device, Roche CoaguChek® XS System. The method
comparison study was performed on 365 test subjects which included capillary whole
blood samples from subjects not receiving warfarin or any other anticoagulant (INR
<2.0) and from subjects currently on warfarin therapy (INR 2.0 to 4.5). The method
comparison study was conducted across four (4) intended use sites using three (3) lots
of Xprecia™ System PT/INR test strips per site with a minimum of three (3)
operators per site. The following table summarizes the study results by individual
sites and combined sites:

3. Specimen Identification:
A built-in barcode reader scans the barcode label associated with a patient sample.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The Xprecia™ System PT/INR Strips are intended for single-use only. Once the test strip
is inserted into the analyzer, a drop of fresh capillary whole blood sample collected by
fingerstick is manually applied to the test strip target area and analyzed.
5. Calibration:
Xprecia™ System PT/INR strips:
Each lot of Xprecia™ System PT/INR test strips is factory calibrated to a reference lot of
human recombinant thromboplastin traceable to the World Health Organization
International Reference Preparation. An International Sensitivity Index (ISI) and Mean
Normal Prothrombin Time (MNPT) values are assigned by calibration for each lot and
embedded on the barcode label on the test strip vial along with the lot number and
expiration date. Metrological traceability was achieved by following WHO Technical
Report Series 889 Annex 3 - Guidelines for Thromboplastins and Plasmas Used to
Control Oral Anticoagulant Therapy.
Xprecia Stride™ Coagulation Analyzer:
When the analyzer is first turned on, the instrument performs a series of electronics,
signal, software and memory integrity checks, as well as ensuring there is sufficient
battery voltage to operate the Xprecia Stride™ Analyzer. The key tests during this phase
are the Heater/Thermistor check along with the Strip Port Hardware check. These are part
of the overall Electronics Integrity Check. Failure to pass any of these power-on tests will
prevent further operation of the analyzer.
6. Quality Control:
The Xprecia Stride™ Coagulation System consists of two levels of electronic onboard
quality controls. When a test strip is inserted, the Xprecia Stride ™ Coagulation Analyzer
automatically conducts two on-strip quality control checks designed to help ensure test
strip integrity. The first control checks the presence of adequate sample reagent on the
test strip, and the second control detects test strip degradation due to exposure to
environmental conditions.
The Xprecia Stride™ Coagulation Analyzer also uses Liquid Quality Controls (LQCs).
The Xprecia™ System PT Controls kit contains assayed controls for the assessment of
precision and accuracy in the normal (PT Control 1) and therapeutic (PT Control 2) range
for the prothrombin time (PT) to be used with Xprecia™ System PT/INR Strips. The PT
Control 1 and PT Control 2 are run and evaluated the same way as patient samples. The
assigned values and ranges for each lot of PT Control 1 and PT Control 2 appear on each
control vial as a barcode to be read by the Xprecia Stride™ Coagulation Analyzer.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Cleaning Robustness Testing
To perform the Stride ™ Coagulation Analyzer cleaning step, the operator should use a Sani-
Cloth® Plus to wipe all surface areas of the analyzer to remove all blood and other body
fluids. During the Stride ™ Coagulation Analyzer disinfection step, the operator uses a Sani-
Cloth® Plus to thoroughly wet all surface areas of the analyzer. The operator also carefully
disinfects the front and grooved back of the test strip port protective cap with the Sani-
Cloth® Plus. After 2 minutes exposure time (allow the analyzer to remain wet for 2 minutes),
then let air dry. The Stride ™ Coagulation Analyzer lifespan claim is 7,300 cleaning cycles
which is equivalent to 2 years of analyzer life.
One (1) cycle = One (1) wipe for cleaning + One (1) wipe for disinfecting
10 cleaning cycles per day x 365 days x 2 years = 7,300 cleaning cycles.
The lifespan of the analyzer will vary depending on actual usage.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
