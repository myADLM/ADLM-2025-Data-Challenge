I. Device Description:
EDAN i15 Blood Gas and Chemistry Analysis System:
The EDAN i15 Blood Gas and Chemistry Analysis System, (including the Blood Gas and
Chemistry Analyzer, Calibrant Fluid Pack, Test Cartridge, and Quality Controls) is a system
for in-vitro analysis of whole blood, delivering quantitative results for a panel of tests. The
analyzer has a user interface module which contains the CPU and all the required electronic
interfaces for external communication and data storage. The signals generated by the
electrochemical sensors contained in the Test Cartridges are converted into concentration
levels which are displayed on the screen of the analyzer, stored in memory, and can be
transmitted by communication link or Wi-Fi to the Data Management System (DMS) or
HIS/LIS. The analyzer includes a barcode scanner to scan bar codes of test cartridges,
calibrant fluid packs, controls, patient and operator ID. The analyzer aspirates the sample
directly from a syringe, or capillary fitted with an adaptor, and requires a minimum sample
volume of 140 µL for analysis.
EDAN i15 Test Cartridge: single-use disposable cartridge into which the blood sample is
introduced. The cartridge consists of fluid paths and electrochemical sensors for
potentiometric measurement of pH, PCO2, Na+, K+, Cl-, and Ca++; amperometric
measurement for PO2; and conductivity measurement for Hct. The cartridge is packaged into
a sealed foil pouch which includes a bar-code label with calibration, lot identification and
expiration dating information. The test cartridge is available in three versions with different
test menus:

L. Test Principle:
Potentiometry is used to measure pH, PCO2 and electrolytes (Na+, K+, Ca++ and Cl-) in the
EDAN i15 System. Potentiometry is based on the measurement of the difference in electrical
signal resulting from a chemical reaction between the analyte and an electrochemical sensor.
The electrical signal generated by the reaction is proportional to the amount of analyte in the
sample.
Amperometry is used to measure PO2 in the EDAN i15 System. PO2 is measured by
applying a fixed voltage to an electrode and then measuring the current resulting in the
reaction. The current is proportional to the amount of the analyte in the sample.
Conductance is used to measure hematocrit in the EDAN i15 System. Conductance is the
ease with which a conducting substance transmits an electrical current. The conductance is
inversely proportional to the concentration of hematocrit in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i.) A within run and total precision study was conducted in-house by with the 3
levels of EDAN i15 blood gas and chemistry control materials by testing two

ii.) A precision study was performed with the intended POC operators following
CLSI EP5-A3. The precision study took place at four point-of-care (POC) locations
comprised of a respiratory medical unit, two intensive care units, and an anesthesia
unit. Testing was performed by 11 POC operators (2 or 3 operators per site). Within-
run and total precision were performed using 3 levels of blood gas/electrolyte control
material as well as 3 levels of hematocrit control material. Four EDAN i15
analyzers and 4 number of cartridge lots (one analyzer and one lot per site). The
duration of testing varied between 4 and 14 days among the sites. Each of the control
materials were run twice a day at each site. Each site produced similar precision
results. Results of precision studies from a representative site (POC site 1) are shown
below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed based on CLSI EP6 guidance for each analyte using
lithium heparinized venous whole blood with sampling from a syringe and from a
capillary tube. Samples aspirated into the instrument from a syringe or from a
capillary tube require the same volume of blood (140 µL), travel through the same
aspiration port and tubing, and are measured exactly the same by the analyzer. The
only difference is the sample tube type and the manner in which the samples are
collected. For each parameter, 7 levels were prepared by tonometry to achieve

Stability:
The stability studies performed to support the stability claims of the EDAN i15 Blood
Gas and Electrolyte Control and EDAN i15 Hematocrit Control were reviewed and
the study protocol and acceptance criteria were found to be acceptable. Stability
studies support EDAN’s shelf life claim of 36 months when stored at 2-8o C for the
blood gas and electrolyte controls; and for the hematocrit controls, a 24 month shelf
life when stored at 2-25o C.
EDAN i15 Calibrant Fluid Pack: Real time stability studies support the sponsor’s
shelf life claim of 12 months when stored at 2-8o C and in-use life of 30 days after
installation in the analyzer. The stability study protocol and acceptance criteria were
found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
Refer to the linearity study above in M.2.b for the measuring range claim for all
analytes except ionized calcium, for which detection limit studies were performed and
are described below.
Detection limit studies were performed on the ionized calcium analyte to determine
the limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ). The
detection limit studies were performed according to CLSI EP17-A guidelines.
Limit of blank: Five venous whole blood samples depleted of ionized calcium were
tested in replicates of 12 on two i15 systems separately to obtain a total of 60 results.
Each of the two analyzers used a different lot of reagent and calibrant fluid packs.
LoB was calculated using the following equation: LoB=µB +1.645ϬB. Using the
highest LoB value of the two analyzers, the LoB was determined to be 0.09 mmol/L.
Limit of detection: The limit of detection was determined by testing 5 venous whole
blood samples with low level calcium levels (~4 times LoB) using 2 sets of i15
systems with different lots of test cartridges and calibrant fluid over a period of 3
days for a total of 60 results. Using the following equation: LoD= µB +1.645ϬB +
1.645ϬB. The LoD was determined to be 0.11 mmol/L.
Limit of quantitation: The limit of quantitation was determined by analyzing the 60
results from the LoD study using 4 low samples. The sponsor determined that the
LoQ is 0.11 mmol/L.
Ionized Calcium detection limits results:
Limit of Blank Limit of Detection Limit of Quantitation
0.09 mmol/L 0.11 mmol/L 0.11 mmol/L
The measuring range of Ca++ is 0.25-2.50 mmol/L.

e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP7-A2. Heparinized
human venous whole blood samples containing low and high concentrations (see
chart below) of each analyte were spiked with one or two levels of each potential
interfering substance.

Seven replicates of both the spiked sample and the unspiked sample were tested on
two i15 Blood Gas and Chemistry Systems with one lot of test cartridges. The
samples containing interferent were evaluated against the same whole blood sample
without the interferent. Significant interference is presented as absolute bias for pH
and as percent bias for all other analytes and the sponsor’s acceptance criteria for
defining non-significant interference are provided below:
Measurand Evaluation method Definition of non-
significant

The sponsor included the following limitation in the labeling regarding interference
of hemolysis on the potassium results:
“Hemolysis will increase the potassium measurement on i15 system due to release
of potassium from the red blood cells. When the amount of hemoglobin in plasma
in increased by 500 mg/dL, the increase in K+ measurement tested on i15 system is
about 36%; when the amount of hemoglobin in plasma is increased by 100 mg/dL,
the increase in K+ measurement tested on i15 system is about 29%.”
Interference of Elevated WBC count on Hematocrit:
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate the effects of an elevated WBC count on
the devices hematocrit measurement. Whole blood collected from a single healthy
adult volunteer in lithium heparin, was processed to obtain an elevated WBC count
as determined by analysis on Siemens XP-300 by centrifuging to allow collection of
WBC and platelets. This WBC concentrate was added to otherwise untreated,
heparinized whole blood to achieve a bias between the treated and untreated whole
blood of approximately 50,000 WBC cu/mm. The study demonstrated that the

addition of 50,000 WBC cu/mL results in an increase in HCT %PCV measured by
the EDAN i15 relative to spun hematocrit %PCV by 4.43% PCV (absolute) or 11%
(relative).
The sponsor included the following limitation in the labeling:
“NOTE：
The addition of 50,000 WBC cu/mL to a blood sample with 6.1 x 109 WBC cu/mL
causes an increase in Hct %PCV measured by the EDAN i15 relative to
spun hematocrit %PCV by 4.43%PVC (absolute) (4.02 to 4.84%PCV) or
11% (relative) exceeding the Total Allowable Error defined in CLIA’88.”

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison study was performed at 4 point-of-care (POC) sites by 11
POC personnel, and three clinical laboratory sites to compare the results obtained
from the candidate device to those obtained with the predicate device, Siemens
Rapidpoint 400 Systems. At least 50 patient samples were selected from venous
whole blood and arterial whole blood left over from clinical analysis were tested at
each of the 4 POC sites. In order to cover the claimed measuring range, 8% of the
specimens were altered. Calcium balanced heparin was used as the anticoagulant in
the arterial whole blood samples and lithium heparin was used in the whole blood
venous samples. The tables below shows the data from the 4 POC sites, the three
clinical lab sites, and the combined POC and clinical lab data.

this line of product types:
Yes __X______ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Bar code
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Lithium heparinized and calcium balanced heparinized whole blood from syringes and
capillary tubes.
5. Calibration:
Each lot of EDAN i15 Test Cartridge is calibrated during the manufacturing process, and
bar coded with relevant calibration information as well as product identification, lot
number and expiration date. Prior to running a sample, the cartridge’s bar code is read
into the analyzer by scanning the cartridge bar code label. Once inserted into the
analyzer, a calibration of all electrochemical sensors is performed using the precision
buffer solution contained in the EDAN i15 Calibrator Fluid Pack. During the calibration
and measurement processes, diagnostic tests are automatically performed to assure
correct operation of the instrument and measurement of the cartridge. These tests include
automatic checks of the cartridge for packaging integrity, proper cartridge temperature
control, and proper equilibration behavior of the sensors during calibration and
measurement, automatic detection of bubbles and short sample during aspiration.
6. Quality Control:
EDAN i15 Blood Gas and Electrolyte Control: an ampouled, three level aqueous quality
control solutions.
EDAN i15 Hematocrit control: Two, single- level aqueous hematocrit controls in sealed
glass ampoules representing high and low physiological range of hematocrit simulated by
conductivity.
