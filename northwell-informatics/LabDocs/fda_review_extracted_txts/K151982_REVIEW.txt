The Stat Profile Prime ABG Analyzer System is intended for in vitro diagnostic use by health
care professionals in clinical laboratory settings and for point-of-care usage for the
quantitative determination of pH, PCO2, and PO2 in heparinized whole blood.
PCO2, PO2, pH: Whole blood measurement of certain gases in whole blood, or pH of whole
blood, is used in the diagnosis and treatment of life‐threatening acid‐base disturbances.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
For clinical laboratory and point-of-care use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Stat Profile Prime ABG Analyzer System.
I. Device Description:
The Stat Profile Prime ABG Analyzer is a small blood gas analyzer for laboratory and point-
of-care use. The sensors and flow path have been integrated into one replaceable micro-
sensor card, which is replaced periodically according to usage. The product, consumables,
installation instructions and packaging are designed for easy customer installation. Whole
blood specimens are aspirated into the analyzer’s micro-sensor card from syringes, tubes, or
capillary blood collection devices using a peristaltic pump and a sampling probe. The
disposable micro-sensor card contains the analytical flow-path and all of the measurement
sensors (pH, PCO2, PO2). Once the analysis measurement is complete, the whole blood
specimen is automatically flushed out of the micro-sensor card flow-path and into a self-
contained waste collection bag contained within the disposable calibrator cartridge.
The Stat Profile Prime ABG Analyzer has multiple quality control options. Both traditional
internal and external liquid QC will be available, as well as an onboard Quality Management
System (QMS). The Stat Profile Prime ABG Analyzer has two primary sample modes:
syringe and capillary modes. The minimum sample size for both analysis modes is 50 μL.

L. Test Principle:
pH is measured using a hydrogen ion selective membrane. One side of the membrane is in
contact with a solution of constant pH. The other side is in contact with a solution of
unknown pH. A change in potential develops which is proportional to the pH difference of
these solutions. This change in potential is measured against a reference electrode of constant
potential.
PCO2 is measured with a modified pH sensor. Carbon dioxide in the unknown solution
makes contact with a hydrogen ion selective membrane CO2 diffuses across the membrane
into a thin layer of bicarbonate buffer in response to partial pressure difference. This solution
then becomes equilibrated with the external gas pressure of the fluid in contact with the outer
surface of the membrane. CO2 in the solution becomes hydrated producing carbonic acid

which results in a change in hydrogen ion activity. The measured potential is related to the
logarithm of PCO2 content of the sample after compensation of the measured potential of the
pH sensor.
PO2 is measured amperometrically by the generation of a current at the sensor surface. As
oxygen diffuses through a gas permeable membrane, the oxygen molecules are reduced at the
cathode, consuming 4 electrons for every molecule of oxygen reduced. This flow of electrons
is then measured by the sensor and is directly proportional to the partial pressure of oxygen.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The within run precision study was performed at three point-of-care (POC) sites,
including a cardiovascular intensive care unit (CVICU), a medical intensive care unit
(MICU) and a pulmonary care unit (PCU) by a total of 52 POC personnel, comprised
of 35 respiratory therapy and 17 nursing POC personnel. The study was performed by
analyzing 20 replicates of 3 levels of Stat Profile Prime External Quality Control
material (levels 1-3) on a Stat Profile Prime ABG analyzer at each POC site. All three
sites produced similar results. Representative within run precision results are
summarized in tables below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison study for all analytes was previously cleared in k142220 for
clinical laboratory use only. In order to add Point-of-Care claim, sponsor has
conducted POC study using the intended POC operators at the intended use sites to
demonstrate that POC operators could generate equivalent results as the clinical
laboratory professionals. A method comparison study was performed at 3 POC sites
by a total of 52 different POC personnel (35 respiratory therapist and 17 nurses) using
the analyzer’s syringe mode method. Approximately 188 Lithium heparin whole
blood gas specimens from syringes were analyzed to compare the whole blood results
obtained by trained laboratory personnel vs respiratory therapy POC personnel on the
same specimens. No more than 12.7% of samples for each analyte were altered in
order to adequately span the measuring range. Each of the three sites produced
similar method comparison data. Syringe mode method comparison study data is
shown below from one representative POC site and the three combined POC sites:
