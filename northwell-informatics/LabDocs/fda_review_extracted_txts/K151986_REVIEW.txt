L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA Centaur TSTII assay is a competitive immunoassay using direct
chemiluminescent technology. Testosterone in the sample competes with acridinium ester-
labeled hapten in the Lite Reagent for binding with the anti-testosterone sheep monoclonal
antibody. The assay uses ADVIA Centaur Testosterone releasing agent to release bound
testosterone from the endogenous binding proteins in the sample. An inverse relationship
exists between the amount of testosterone present in the sample and the amount of relative
light units (RLUs) detected by the system. Results are calculated from a master curve
adjusted by using high and low calibrators.
The ADVIA Centaur SHBG assay is a sandwich immunoassay that uses three reagent
components: Solid Phase, Ancillary Well Reagent, and Lite Reagent. Solid Phase is
streptavidin-coupled magnetic latex particles, Ancillary Well Reagent contains biotinylated
F(ab)2 monoclonal antibody to SHBG, and Lite Reagent consists of a second F(ab)2
monoclonal antibody to SHBG labeled with acridinium ester (SHBG-AE). The amount of
SHBG present in the patient sample is proportional to the amount of relative light units
(RLUs) detected by the system. Results are calculated from a master curve adjusted by using
high and low calibrators.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
For ADVIA Centaur SHBG assay, sponsor has conducted a precision study and detection
limits study to verify that the traceability change of the new assay do not have any
significant impact on the performance of the precision and detection limits results of the
unmodified assay (originally cleared SHBG assay in k091867).

The ADVIA Centaur TSTII calibrators are lot-locked to reagents (i.e. only one lot of
10

--- Page 11 ---
reagents is used during value assignment of each lot of calibrators). The calibrators
are value assigned during the Master curve runs for a full curve value assignment.
The value assignment consists of samples (Master curve standards, primary controls,
low calibrator, and high calibrator) run in replicates of 6. The value assignment
protocol requires 1 reagent lot (ADVIA Centaur TSTII reagent ReadyPacks with kit
calibrators) using a minimum of 2 runs (1 run performed on 2 instruments), resulting
in a total of 12 replicates per sample.
For each new lot of calibrators, the new calibrator values are calculated as
the overall mean of the value assignment runs read off the standard curve.
The calibrator target values and allowable ranges are presented below:
Calibrator Target value Range
(ng/dL) (ng/dL)
Low 27 17.4-36.6
High 1250 1162.6-1337.4

The ADVIA Centaur SHBG Calibrators used for two-point calibration of the ADVIA
Centaur SHBG assay are value assigned using standards prepared from the WHO 2nd
International Standard for Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (08/226) from NIBSC.
The in-process value assignment consists of samples (Primary standards, primary
controls, low calibrator, and high calibrator) run in replicates of 6. The value
assignment protocol requires 2 reagent lots (ADVIA Centaur SHBG reagent
ReadyPacks) using a minimum of 2 runs (1 run performed with 2 reagent lots),
resulting in a total of 12 replicates per sample. The calibrator target values and
allowable ranges are presented below:

Limit of Blank (LoB)
Limit of Blank was determined for the ADVIA Centaur TSTII assay as described in
CLSI Guideline EP17-A2. Testing was performed using 3 lots of ADVIA Centaur
TSTII reagents and 5 ADVIA Centaur XP analyzers. For each lot/instrument
combination, 80 determinations were obtained by testing 4 negative base-pools in
duplicate (1 test each from two independent aliquots) twice a day for 5 days. The
LoB was calculated non-parametrically following the recommendations in the CLSI
guideline. The sponsor determined that the LoB of the assay is 1.09 ng/dL (the
sponsor claims 2.5 ng/dL).

Limit of Detection (LoD)
Limit of Detection was determined for the ADVIA Centaur TSTII assay as described
in CLSI Guideline EP17-A2. Testing was performed using 3 lots of ADVIA Centaur
TSTII and two ADVIA Centaur XP instruments. For each lot/instrument
combination, 80 determinations were obtained by testing 4 low analyte samples in
duplicate (1 test each from two independent aliquots) twice a day for 5 days. The low
analyte samples were prepared by pooling low level testosterone samples from
different females. The LoD was determined following the parametric model described
in the guideline. The sponsor determined that the LoD of the assay is 3.49 ng/dL (the
sponsor claims 5.0 ng/dL).
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
Four low samples were prepared by pooling different female samples with low
concentrations of testosterone. The 4 serum pools and a blank sample were tested in
duplicate (1 test each from two independent aliquots). Testing was performed using 3
lots of ADVIA Centaur TSTII reagents, over 20 testing days, on five ADVIA Centaur
XP instruments. The Within-lab %CV was plotted vs. the testosterone concentration
to determine the LoQ (concentration at 20% CV). The LoQ was determined to be
7.00 ng/dL.

i.) Potential cross-reactivity of 19 drugs and metabolites on the ADVIA Centaur
TSTII assay were evaluated. Two sample pools of approximately 0 ng/dL and 300
ng/dL (serum patient pool spiked with testosterone to ~300 ng/dL testosterone) were
spiked with each test compound so that the final test sample contained the compound
at the required concentration. A control sample was prepared for each potential cross-
reactant by spiking with the appropriate diluent at the same volume as the potential
cross-reactant. Testing was performed in replicates of three (3) per sample with 2
reagent lots on an ADVIA Centaur XP instrument.

Based on the cross reactivity results, the sponsor included the following limitations in
the labeling:
“A strong interaction with Nandrolone decanoate, 11β-hydroxytestosterone, and 11-
keto-testosterone was found. Do not use samples from patients receiving these
compounds.”
“With the advent of new steroid-based medications (analogues) with similar chemical
structures to testosterone, there is the possibility of cross-reactivity and falsely
elevated results. For diagnostic purposes, the results should always be assessed in
conjunction with the patient's medical history, clinical examination, and other
findings. If the testosterone results are inconsistent with clinical evidence, additional
testing is suggested to confirm the result.”
ii.) Interference Study:
The interference study was designed in accordance with CLSI EP7-A2 to evaluate the
performance of the ADVIA Centaur TSTII assay in the presence of hemoglobin,
intralipid (triglycerides), conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, and biotin. A stock
solution of each interferent was prepared and spiked into two serum patient pools
with concentration approximately 30 ng/dL and 300 ng/dL testosterone. A control
sample was prepared for each interfering substance by spiking with the appropriate
diluent at the same volume as the interfering substance. All samples were run in
triplicate with 2 reagent lots on an ADVIA Centaur XP instrument. The mean of 3
replicates was used to calculate percent interference using the following equation:
% Interference = (spiked sample conc.– unspiked sample conc.) x100
unspiked sample conc.
In addition, a dose response with lower concentrations of endogenous substance was
added to samples that did not meet acceptance criteria of ≤ ±10% bias to determine
the concentration at which interference was not significant. Sponsor defines
significant interference as bias >10% between the tested sample and the control
sample. The non-interference claims are listed in the following table.
Substance Highest Tested Concentration at which no
significant interference (≤±10%) was observed
Hemoglobin 500 mg/dL
Bilirubin (unconjugated) 20 mg/dL
Bilirubin (conjugated) 15 mg/dL
Triglycerides 1000 mg/dL
Cholesterol 500 mg/dL

Based on the interference results, the sponsor included the following limitations in the
labeling.
“Samples with conjugated bilirubin concentrations > 15 mg/dL will cause erroneous
results. Specimens that contain 20 mg/dL of conjugated bilirubin demonstrate a
-14.4% change in results. “
“Samples with unconjugated bilirubin concentrations > 20 mg/dL will cause
erroneous results. Specimens that contain 30 mg/dL of conjugated bilirubin
demonstrate a 20% change in results”
“Specimens that contain 40 ng/mL of biotin demonstrate a 14.6% change in results.”
“In patients receiving therapy with high doses of biotin (> 5 mg/day), no sample
should be taken until at least 8 hours after the last biotin administration.”
iii.) Human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) interference: HAMA interference testing
was performed by spiking 19 HAMA-positive serum samples with USP testosterone
at concentrations of approximately 30 ng/dL and 300 ng/dL. The mean recovery for
all samples spiked with 30 ng/dL testosterone was 98.69%. The mean recovery for all
samples spiked with 300 ng/dL testosterone was 94.55%.
Sponsor has provided the limitations in their package insert:
“Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with reagent immunoglobulins,
interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely exposed to animals or to
animal serum products can be prone to this interference and anomalous values may be
observed. Additional information may be required for diagnosis.”

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Testosterone:
The method comparison study was designed in accordance with CLSI EP9-A3 to
compare the performance of the ADVIA Centaur TSTII assay to that of the
recognized reference method (CDC HoSt Testosterone RMP ID-LC-MS/MS).
The study evaluated a total of 128 individual male and female (adults) serum samples
spanning the range of the assay. Of these, 88 samples were individual (non-pooled)
human sera from single donors obtained by Siemens, with testosterone concentrations
assigned by CDC HoSt Testosterone Reference Measurement Procedure (RMP) ID-
LC-MS/MS. The remaining 40 samples were supplied directly by CDC, and were
individual human serum obtained from individual blood bank donors, with
testosterone concentrations assigned by CDC HoSt Testosterone RMP ID-LC-
MS/MS. None of the samples were altered. All samples were run in singlicate on one
16

--- Page 17 ---
ADVIA Centaur XP system using one reagent TSTII lot over 2 days. The results for
ADVIA Centaur TSTII versus CDC HoSt Testosterone RMP ID-LC-MS/MS were
analyzed using Passing-Bablok regression analysis. The results are summarized
below:
N 128
Slope 0.971
Intercept 1.944
R 0.982
Test range 8.61-1394 ng/dL
An additional method comparison study was performed using 56 adult samples and
61 pediatric samples (with 27 female, age from 7 to 18 and 34 male, age from 9-18)
against a commercially available Testosterone assay to support sponsor’s claim that
pediatric samples could be used with the candidate device. Weighted Deming
regression was used for the data analysis. The combined total samples with range
tested between 8.0 to 825 ng/dL resulted in Y= 1.01X +0.99, r = 0.99, n= 117. The
pediatric samples with range tested between 8.0 to 732 ng/dL resulted in Y= 1.04X +
0.22, r = 0.99, n =61.
SHBG:
A method comparison of the ADVIA Centaur SHBG assay to the Elecsys SHBG
assay on the Roche Cobas e 411 analyzer was performed by testing 174 serum
samples distributed over the assay range. In order cover the entire measuring range,
17 of the 174 (9.77%) samples were diluted. Data were analyzed using Weighted
Deming regression. The results are summarized below:

b. Matrix comparison:
Testosterone:
Fifty matched sample sets spanning the assay range for serum, EDTA plasma, lithium
heparin plasma, and sodium heparin plasma were run in singlicate using 2 lots of
reagent. Five samples were altered in order to span the assay range. Data were
analyzed by linear regression with results from plasma samples, plasma separator
tubes (PSTs) and serum separator tubes (SSTs) were compared to results of serum
samples in glass tubes. The results are summarized in the following table.

Data Analysis: Each category of samples was analyzed separately. Due to the limited
availability of pediatric samples, the sample analysis method varied depending on the
number of samples in each subgroup. Please see the following descriptions of each
subgroup reference intervals determination.
For groups of 120 or more subjects, the lower and upper reference limits were estimated
as the 2.5th and the 97.5th percentiles of the distribution of test results using a non-
parametric approach in accordance with the recommendation in CLSI guideline EP28-
A3.
For groups of 40 to 119 subjects, the lower and upper reference limits were estimated as
the 2.5th and the 97.5th percentiles of the distribution of test results using a robust measure
of location and spread, as developed by Horn and Pesce.
For groups of less than 40 subjects, the lower and upper reference limits were estimated
as the 5th and the 95th percentiles of the distribution of test results.
SHBG
A reference interval study was performed for the ADVIA Centaur SHBG assay. The
sample groups tested consisted of males, > 49 years old (n=137); males between the ages
of 21 to 50 years old (n=122); post-menopausal females, ages 48 to 89 years (n=134);
and pre-menopausal females, ages 21 to 60 years (n=167). The central 95th percentile
range of each sample category was calculated by finding the 2.5th ranked sample on the
low end and the 97.5th ranked sample on the high end. The follow reference intervals
were obtained for each category:
Adult males (21 to 49 yrs): 14.55 to 94.64 nmol/L

Free Androgen Index (FAI)
The free androgen Index reference range for the adult population (≥21 yrs) was
determined using the data collected from the reference interval studies performed from
the ADVIA Centaur TSTII and ADVIA SHBG assays described above. The FAI was
calculated for each data set using the following equation:
FAI (%) = ADVIA Centaur TST II (nmol/L) x 100
ADVIA Centaur SHBG (nmol/L)
The following reference intervals were obtained:
Free Androgen Index
Lower range U p p e r range
Gender Age N
(% ) (%)
Male 21-49 119 11.14 81.01
Male ≥50 137 8.99 46.51
Female 21-60 167 0.27 7.64
(premenopausal)
Female 45-89 127 0.17 4.15
(postmenopausal)
The sponsor states the following in the package insert labeling:
Consider these ranges as guidelines only. Each laboratory should determine its own
reference ranges for the diagnostic evaluation of patient results.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
