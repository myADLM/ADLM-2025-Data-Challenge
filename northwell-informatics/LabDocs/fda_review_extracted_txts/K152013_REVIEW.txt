L. Test Principle:
The QUANTA Flash dsDNA assay is a microparticle chemiluminescent immunoassay
designed for use on the BIO-FLASH instrument. The instrument platform is a fully
automated closed system with continuous load and random access capabilities that
automatically processes the samples, runs the assay and reports the results. It includes liquid

handling hardware, luminometer and computer with software-user interface. The QUANTA
Flash dsDNA assay utilizes a reagent cartridge format, which is compatible with the BIO-
FLASH instrument.
Synthetic dsDNA antigen is coated onto paramagnetic beads, which are stored in the reagent
cartridge in suspension. When the assay cartridge is ready to be used for the first time, the
entire cartridge is inverted several times to thoroughly mix the reagents. The sealed reagent
tubes are then pierced with the reagent cartridge lid. The reagent cartridge is then loaded
onto the BIO-FLASH instrument. Samples are also loaded onto the instrument in sample
racks. A patient serum sample is prediluted by the BIO-FLASH with system rinse in a small
disposable plastic cuvette. Small amounts of the diluted patient serum, the beads, and assay
buffer are all combined into a second cuvette, and mixed. This cuvette is then incubated at
37°C. The beads are magnetized and washed several times. Isoluminol conjugated anti-
human IgG antibodies are then added to the cuvette, and again incubated at 37°C. The beads
are magnetized and washed repeatedly. The isoluminol conjugate is oxidized when Trigger 1
and Trigger 2 are added to the cuvette, and the flash of light produced from this reaction is
measured as Relative Light Units (RLU) by the BIO-FLASH optical system. The RLU are
proportional to the amount of isoluminol conjugate that is bound to the human IgG, which is
in turn proportional to the amount of anti- dsDNA antibodies bound to the corresponding
dsDNA on the beads.
For quantitation, the QUANTA Flash dsDNA assay utilizes a predefined lot specific Master
Curve that is uploaded onto the instrument through the reagent cartridge barcode. Every new
lot number of reagent cartridge must be calibrated before first use, with the QUANTA Flash
dsDNA Calibrators. The Master Curve is created during manufacturing by using in-house
standards that are traceable to the First International Standard Preparation for dsDNA (WHO
code: Wo/80). Based on the results obtained with the two Calibrators included in the
Calibrator Set, an instrument specific Working Curve is created, which is used to calculate
international units (IU)/mL from the instrument signal (RLU) obtained for each sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance: All results presented below were within the sponsor’s pre-
determined acceptance criteria for each study.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision: The precision of the QUANTA Flash dsDNA assay was evaluated on nine
serum samples containing various concentrations of dsDNA antibodies. Each sample
was run in duplicate, twice a day, for 20 or 21 days with one reagent lot (total of 80 or
84 replicates per sample). Data were analyzed for within run, between run, between
day and total precision. The results are summarized in the table below.

Lot-to-lot Reproducibility: To evaluate lot-to-lot reproducibility, five samples with
anti-dsDNA antibody concentrations at various levels across the measuring range
(13.9, 25.7, 33.1, 85.9, and 349.3 IU/mL) were tested. Each sample was tested in
replicates of five, one run per day for five days using three difference reagent lots.
Mean and %CV for each sample were calculated and %CV values were from 0.7% to
7.5% for all samples.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity: The analytical measuring range of the assay is defined by the lowest and
highest points on the master curve (9.8–666.9 IU/mL). The linearity across this range
was evaluated by a study according to CLSI EP6-A. Serially diluted samples with
dsDNA concentrations ranging from 5.6 to 716.1 IU/mL were prepared by diluting
each of five high positive serum samples with analyte free serum. Each dilution was

Auto-rerun: To validate the auto-rerun function at a 1:10 dilution, eight high positive
specimens with anti-dsDNA antibody concentrations above the assay measuring
range (731.8, 737.7, 740.3, 786.1, 946.6, 986.6, 1030.0, and 4353.0 IU/mL) were run
with the auto-rerun function enabled on the BIO-FLASH. The same set of samples
prepared manually with 1:10 fold dilution was used as reference. The % recovery
values for individual results obtained with the auto-rerun results compared to results
obtained with the manual dilution were between 83.5% and 105.9%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The master curve standards are traceable to the First International
Standard Preparation for dsDNA (WHO code: Wo/80). Based upon this
standardization, results are reported in International Units (IU)/mL. Calibrator and
Control values are directly traceable to in-house Standards that are used to create the
Master Curves for the QUANTA Flash dsDNA assay.
Value assignment: The QUANTA Flash dsDNA Calibrators and Controls are
manufactured by diluting human serum that contains a high titer of anti-dsDNA
antibodies. The target IU/mL is achieved through trial dilutions on small scale. Once
a dilution is selected, the Calibrators and Controls are bulked, tested, and adjusted.
Upon completion of the manufacturing process, the Calibrators and Controls are
tested on at least two instruments, on at least two lots of reagent cartridge, in
replicates of 10 to determine final value assignment. The target values and ranges for
the Calibrators and Controls are listed below:

Stability:
Kit stability (unopened): The accelerated stability study was performed using three
lots of kits (with three different lots of dsDNA coupled beads), calibrators, and
controls. Real-time stability is on-going; the results to date support a claim of 12
months stability for unopened kits, calibrators and controls stored at 2–8°C.
On-board (In-use) stability: On-board stability study was performed for calibrators,
controls, and reagent cartridge:
i. Calibrators: Calibrators were placed uncapped, onboard the instrument, and
calibration was performed five times over 8.5 hours. Controls and a panel of
nine characterized patient specimens were run on each calibration curve.
Each calibrator is measured in triplicate during calibration.
ii. Controls: Two vials of each control were assayed twice a day for a total of 20
runs. The first run was used to establish baseline value, and then an additional
19 runs were performed. During runs, the Controls were left uncapped,
onboard the instrument for 15 minutes per run. When not in use, the controls
were capped, and stored at 5ºC ± 3°C.
iii. Reagent Cartridge: Three lots of cartridges were tested with four serum
specimens (with different reactivity levels) along with the Negative and
Positive Controls. The specimens were tested periodically up to 6 days.
Percent recoveries were calculated compared to the day zero average values,
and linear regression analysis was performed by plotting % recovery against
the number of days.
All results met the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria and support the following
stability claim:
Calibrators 8 hours on-board; up to 4 calibrations.
Controls Up to 15 uses with 10 min on-board per use
Reagent Cartridge 60 days on-board
Sample stability: The study was performed with 13 samples, encompassing negative,
equivocal and low to high positive samples, tested at 2–8°C, and room temperature
(RT). In addition, the samples were tested for the stability after repeated freeze/thaw
cycles up to six cycles. The results support sample stability up to 48 hours of storage
at RT, up to 10 days of storage at 2–8°C, and up to three freeze/thaw cycles when
samples are stored at or below -20°C.

d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying four blank samples in three
replicates per sample over six days with two reagent lots. A total of 72 data points
per lot were generated. LoB for each lot was calculated separately at the 95th
percentile. The LoB for two lots was determined to be 519.8 RLU and 432.9 RLU.
The claimed LoB value is 520 RLU.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by assaying five samples with anti-
dsDNA antibody concentration between LoB and approximately four times of LoB.
Each sample was tested in four replicates over three days on two reagent lots. LoD
value was calculated as the LoB + 1.645 x SD of the replicates for the low level
samples. The LoD of the QUANTA Flash dsDNA assay for the two lots were
determined to be 785.8 and 762.6 RLU. The claimed LoD is 785.8 RLU.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined based on the analysis of total
impression of the LoD study with a total error goal of 20%. The LoQ of the
QUANTA Flash dsDNA assay for the two lots were determined to be 1525 RLU and
1805 RLU, which are below the value of the lowest QUANTA Flash dsDNA Master
Curve standard (2952 RLU/9.8 IU/mL), and therefore below the Analytical
Measuring Range of the assay. The claimed LoQ is 1805 RLU.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interference: Six serum samples with antibody concentration at 24.3
IU/mL (negative), 30.9 IU/mL (within the indeterminate range), 37.9 IU/mL
(near/above high limit of the indeterminate range), 41.5 IU/mL (low positive), 132.3
IU/mL (mid high positive), and 375.6 IU/mL (high positive),were spiked with known
quantities of conjugated bilirubin (10, 5.0 or 2.5 mg/dL), hemoglobin (200, 100, or 50
mg/dL), triglycerides/cholesterol (1000/224.3, 500/112.2, or 250/56.1 mg/dL). Each
sample was tested in triplicate and the recovery was calculated by comparing to
control samples spiked with the same volume of diluents. For rheumatoid factor (RF)
interference, six additional samples with concentration at 21.4, 32.0, 40.3, 43.9,
140.3, and 364.0 IU/mL were tested by spiking them with different proportions of a
high positive RF IgM serum sample (1894 IU/mL). Each sample was tested triplicate
and the recovery was calculated by comparing to control samples spiked with the
same proportions of a negative serum. No interference was detected in the samples
up to the concentrations listed in the table below:
Potential Interfering Maximum
Substances Concentration
Bilirubin (conjugated) 10 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 200 mg/dL
Triglycerides 1000 mg/dL
Cholesterol 224.3 mg/dL
RF IgM 947.1 IU/mL

Analytical cross-reactivity: Cross reactivity of the QUANTA Flash dsDNA was
investigated using 12 reference sera from the Center of Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) with one lot of QUANTA Flash dsDNA reagents. The ANA
human reference serum #1 (for human antibodies to dsDNA) tested positive (50.7
IU/mL). The reference serum #5 (for human antibodies to Sm) and #7 (for human
antibodies to SS-A/Ro) tested negative with the value of 22.7 and 14.8 IU/mL,
respectively. The other reference sera in the panel were below 9.8 IU/mL.
f. Assay cut-off:
The QUANTA Flash dsDNA cut-off was determined by testing samples from a
reference population of 170 subjects (121 apparently healthy blood donors and 49
other control disease samples). The cut-off was established as 27 IU/mL based on the
95th percentile of the results obtained. The upper limit of the indeterminate range was
established as 35 IU/mL based on the 99th percentile of the results. These data were
used to set the assay cut-off for QUANTA Flash dsDNA as follows:
Negative Indeterminate Positive
QUANTA Flash dsDNA < 27 IU/mL 27–35 IU/mL > 35 IU/mL
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Samples for method comparison analysis are from the samples used in the clinical
validation studies and tested with QUANTA Flash dsDNA and the predicate
QUANTA Lite dsDNA. A total of 481samples within the assay measuring ranges of
both assays were included in the method comparison analysis. The sample set
includes 369 samples from SLE patients, four samples from drug induced lupus
patients, 100 samples from patients with other autoimmune diseases (primary anti-
phospholipid syndrome, Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic sclerosis, autoimmune
myositis, mixed connective tissue disease, Crohn’s disease, Celiac disease, Graves’
disease, Hashimoto thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis), and eight samples
from patients with infectious diseases. The results are summarized below:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected value in the normal population is “negative”. Anti-dsDNA antibody levels
were analyzed in a cohort of 300 apparently healthy blood donors (131 females and 169
males, ages 19 to 68 years, with an average age and median age of 44 years) using the
QUANTA Flash dsDNA. The results showed a mean concentration of 11.6 IU/mL with
the values ranging from <9.8 to 81.9 IU/mL. Six samples (2.0%) were tested with value
in the indeterminate range (27–35 IU/mL), and four (1.3%) of the samples were positive
(36.8 to 81.9 IU/mL).
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
