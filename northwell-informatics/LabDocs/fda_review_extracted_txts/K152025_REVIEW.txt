H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
AssureTech Buprenorphine Strip:
The AssureTech Buprenorphine Strip test is an immunochromatographic assay for the
qualitative determination of Buprenorphine in human urine at a Cut-Off concentration
of 10ng/mL. This test is calibrated to Buprenorphine (calibrator).
The test may yield preliminary positive results when prescription drug Buprenorphine
is ingested, even at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly recognized
drug levels for Buprenorphine in urine. The test provides only preliminary test results.
A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a
confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result
is positive.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. The test is intended for over-the-counter and for
prescription use.
AssureTech Methadone Strip:
The AssureTech Methadone Strip test is an immunochromatographic assay for the
qualitative determination of Methadone in human urine at a Cut-Off concentration of
300ng/mL. This test is calibrated to Methadone (calibrator).
The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse
test result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. The test is intended for over-the-counter and for
prescription use.

ng/mL, respectively. These tests are calibrated to Buprenorphine and Methadone
(calibrators).
The test may yield preliminary positive results when prescription drug Buprenorphine
is ingested, even at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly recognized
drug levels for Buprenorphine in urine. The test provides only preliminary test results.
A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a

is positive.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. The tests are intended for over-the-counter and for
prescription use.
AssureTech Buprenorphine/Methadone Quick Cup:
The AssureTech Buprenorphine/Methadone Quick Cup test is an
immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative determination of Buprenorphine
and Methadone in human urine at a Cut-Off concentration of 10ng/mL and 300
ng/mL, respectively. These tests are calibrated to Buprenorphine and Methadone
(calibrators).
The test may yield preliminary positive results when prescription drug Buprenorphine
is ingested, even at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly recognized
drug levels for Buprenorphine in urine. The test provides only preliminary test results.

AssureTech Buprenorphine/Methadone Turn Key-Split Cup:
The AssureTech Buprenorphine/Methadone Turn Key-Split Cup test is an
immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative determination of Buprenorphine
and Methadone in human urine at a Cut-Off concentration of 10ng/mL and 300

For Prescription and Over-the-counter Use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable; this is a visually read single use device.
I. Device Description:
The AssureTech Buprenorphine Strip, AssureTech Methadone Strip, AssureTech
Buprenorphine/Methadone Panel Dip, AssureTech Buprenorphine/Methadone Quick Cup
and AssureTech Buprenorphine/Methadone Turn Key-Split Cup are
immunochromatographic assays that use a lateral flow system for the qualitative
detection of Buprenorphine and/or Methadone (target analytes) in human urine. The
Quick Cup format does not contain a turn-key for device activation. The tests are the first
step in a two-step process. The second step is to send the sample for laboratory testing if
preliminary positive results are obtained.

qualitative detection of Buprenorphine and/or Methadone in urine samples. The tests are
lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays. During testing, a urine specimen migrates
upward by capillary action. If target drugs present in the urine specimen are below the
cut-off concentration, it will not saturate the binding sites of its specific monoclonal
mouse antibody coated on the particles. The antibody-coated particles will then be
captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the
test line region. The colored line will not form in the test line region if the target drug
level exceeds its cutoff-concentration because it will saturate all the binding sites of the
antibody coated on the particles. A band should form in the control region of the devices
regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the sample to indicate that the tests
have been performed properly.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of -100%, -
75%, -50%, -25%, cutoff, +25%, +50%, +75% and +100% cut off. These samples
were prepared by spiking drug in negative urine samples. Each drug concentration
was confirmed by GC/MS. These studies were conducted by 3 operators with 3
lots of each device in two runs per day for 25 days (n=50). The results obtained
are summarized in the following tables.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
External control materials are not supplied with the devices; however, the package
inserts list information on how to obtain control materials.
Sample Storage and Stability:
Protocols and acceptance criteria for real time, accelerated and transportation
simulation stability studies were described and found to be acceptable. The real
time stability data supports the sponsor’s claim that the devices are stable at 4-30
°C for 24 months.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
The potential effect of endogenous and exogenous interferents was tested by spiking
the interferents into drug-free urine and target drug(s) urine with concentrations at
25% below and 25% above the cut-off levels. Compounds that showed no positive or
negative interference at a concentration of 100μg/mL are summarized in the
following tables. The substances tested and concentrations are shown below:
Buprenorphine and Methadone:
Acetophenetidin Ethyl-p-aminobenzoate Phencyclidine

* Tested with Buprenorphine assay only
To test specificity, drug metabolites and other compounds structurally similar
to methadone and buprenorphine were tested using three batches of each
device. The lowest concentration that caused a positive result for each compound
is listed below. There were no differences observed between the different formats.

To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine pH, urine samples,
with 1.000 to 1.035 specific gravity or urine samples with pH 4 to 9 were spiked
with target drugs at 25% below and 25% above the cutoff levels. These samples
were tested using three lots of each device. Results were all positive for samples
at and above +25% cutoff and all negative for samples at and below -25% Cut-
Off. There were no differences observed for different formats.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cut-
off concentration appears in the precision/reproducibility section above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies for the AssureTech Buprenorphine Tests and the
AssureTech Methadone Tests were performed in-house with three laboratory
assistants for each device. Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive)

Lay-user study:
A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 273 study subjects for
3 formats and 147 study subjects for 2 formats. The lay users had diverse educational
and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 18 to >50 years. Urine samples
were prepared at the following concentrations; negative, +/-75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of
the cutoff by spiking drug(s) into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The
concentrations of the samples were confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample was
aliquotted into individual containers and blind-labeled. Each participant was provided
with the package insert, 1 blind labeled sample and a device. Each device format was
tested.
