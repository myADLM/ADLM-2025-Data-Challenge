L. Test Principle:
The IMMULITE 2000 TSI assay is an automated, two-cycle, chemiluminescent
immunoassay. It employs two recombinant chimeric human TSH receptors (hTSHR) where
the major epitope for the blocking antibody is replaced. The capture receptor is immobilized
on the solid phase (polystyrene bead) by 3D7, a monoclonal antibody directed against the C-
terminus of hTSHR. In the first 30-minute cycle, thyroid-stimulating antibodies in patient
sample bind through one arm to the capture receptor on the polystyrene bead. Upon
completion of the 1st cycle, the bead is washed four times with water onboard the instrument.
In the second cycle, a liquid reagent containing the signal receptor is added to the reaction
tube and incubated for 30 minutes. The immobilized TSI binds the signal receptor through
the second arm forming a bridge. Unbound signal receptor is then removed by four
centrifugal water washes. Finally, chemiluminescent substrate is added to the reaction tube
and a signal is generated in direct relation to the amount of bound AP enzyme and TSI in the
sample.

A second lot-to-lot precision study was performed by testing 39 samples in a single
replicate using three lots in four different matrix types (serum, SST tubes, K -EDTA
2
plasma, and Li-Heparin plasma). Linear regression was performed to compare the
results from the different lots and the data met the manufacturer’s predetermined
acceptance criteria of slope 1.0 ± 0.1 and correlation coefficient 0.9–1.0. The data are
presented in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity: Six different patient serum samples as well as the calibrators were used to
demonstrate assay linearity according to CLSI document EP6-A. For each sample,
nine equally spaced dilutions were made by mixing a TSI-high patient sample with a
TSI-negative patient sample. One dilution series was also prepared by mixing the
high calibrator and the low calibrator. The patient-sample dilution series covered the
claimed assay range of 0.10–40.0 IU/L. Each sample was tested in triplicate.
Statistical linearity was established when none of the nonlinear terms in second and
third-order polynomial models are statistically significant. For any sample
determined to be statistically nonlinear, with at least 1 non-linear term having a p-
value less than 0.05, the amount of nonlinearity (a percent of the predicted value)
should be less than the acceptance target (15% or 0.5 IU/L whichever is greater) to be
considered nominally linear. All data met the acceptance criteria and are presented in
the table below:

Hook Effect:
A serum sample with high TSI concentration (> 800 IU/L), was tested neat and
diluted using the assay diluent MD2. The sample was diluted serially up to a 1:128
dilution factor. The sample was tested using two reagent lots and no dilutions fell
below the signal of the highest assay calibrator. No hook effect was observed.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and Expected Values:
IMMULITE® 2000 TSI (thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins) Assay
The IMMULITE® 2000 TSI assay is traceable to the WHO 2nd international standard
for Thyroid Stimulating Antibody, NIBSC standard 08/204 and is manufactured using
qualified materials and measurement procedures.
IMMULITE® 2000 TSI master calibrators are value-assigned against a set of
standards prepared by gravimetric reconstitution and dilution of WHO international
standard 08/204. The instrument-stored assay calibration curve is based on a series of
calibrators covering the claimed assay range and is specific for each lot of the assay.
Calibrators are used internally only, to generate a stored standard curve for individual
lots of reagents. Adjustors are supplied in the assay kit and are used to conduct a
two-point adjustment of the assay calibration.
Adjustors and Controls are prepared in-house and value assigned during the
development process. Calibrator and Control values are summarized in the tables
below. The listed values are approximate values, as the values are lot specific.

Reagent Stability:
Real-time stability testing was performed for closed-vial and open-vial/in-use
reagents, adjustors, controls and CVMs. Study design and data analysis were
performed according to CLSI document EP25-A.
Closed-vial stability testing at 2–8°C was conducted in a real-time study at 0, 60, 120,
180, 270, 360, 450, 540, and 570 days. Eight samples were tested that covered the
analytical measuring range of the assay: two pooled patient samples, the low and high
adjustor, the low and high controls, the low CVM, and the high calibrator J. Four
replicates were tested for the low and high adjustors and three replicates for each of
the other samples were tested on each day of the study. Percent recovery was
compared to the day zero mean value. The results are presented in the table below.
Open-vial stability testing at 2–8°C was conducted in a real-time study at 0, 7, 8, 14,
30, 45, 60, 90, and 97 days. Open-vial testing of aliquoted components stored at
−20°C was conducted on Days 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 194 days. Open-vial
testing was performed with the same eight samples and study design as in the closed-
vial stability testing. The results are presented in the table below.

Sample Stability:
Sample stability testing was performed with serum and EDTA and lithium-heparin
plasma. Five patient samples covering the analytical measuring range were tested for
each matrix type at three different temperatures. The sample stability study supports
the claim of stability for 24 hours at 20–25°C, seven days at 2–8°C, and 12 months at
−20°C for all samples types.
Calibration Curve Stability:
Real time testing supported the recommended adjustment interval of four weeks.
d. Detection limit:
Detection limits for the IMMULITE® 2000 TSI Assay was determined as
recommended in CLSI EP17-A2.
Limit of Blank (LoB): LoB was determined by testing five TSI negative serum
samples on three different instruments using three lots of reagent. Each of the five
samples was tested with two replicates per run and two runs per day for three days. A
total of 180 measurements were made per lot. The LoB result was calculated as the
value of the 95th ranked sample. The highest value for LoB was reported among the
three different lots, and LoB was calculated as 0.03 IU/L.
Limit of Detection (LoD): To determine the LoD, five TSI serum sample pools with
mean concentrations from 0.03–0.11 IU/L were tested with three different lots of
reagents. Each sample was tested with four replicates per day over three days on
three different instruments (n = 36 replicates per sample for each lot). The LoD was
calculated for each lot using the methods described in EP17-A2 and the highest value
among the three lots was chosen. LoD was calculated as 0.06 IU/L.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ): To determine the LoQ, six serum samples with mean
concentrations from 0.06–0.16 IU/L were tested using three different lots of reagents.
Samples were tested on one instrument with three replicates per day for three days (n
= 54 replicates per lot).
The LoQ was determined as the highest concentration with a total error of ≤ 45%
according to the Westgard model. The highest LoQ was chosen among the three lots.
LoQ was calculated to be 0.10 IU/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interferents:
Three serum pools with concentrations across the assay range (Sample pool 1: 0.3–
0.5 IU/L, Sample pool 2: 8–12 IU/L, Sample pool 3: 24–40 IU/L) were prepared then
13

--- Page 14 ---
spiked separately with endogenous interferents. A control sample was prepared for
each interfering substance by spiking the appropriate diluent at the same volume as
the interfering substance; each sample was tested in triplicate. The interferents tested
were:
Highest
Substance
Concentration Tested
Intralipid 1000 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 200 mg/dL
Bilirubin, conjugated 40 mg/dL
Bilirubin, unconjugated 40 mg/dL
EDTA 9 mg/mL
HAMA 40 ng/mL
Rheumatoid Factor 200 IU/mL
LH 500 mIU/L
TSH 0.14 mIU/L
FSH 750 mIU/L
hCG 100,000 mIU/L
aTPO 2,000,000 mIU/L
aTG 2,000,000 mIU/L
No interference was found when the means of control samples were compared with
the means of the spiked samples, except in the case of hemoglobin. The sponsor has
included a limitation to this effect in the package insert: "Presence of hemoglobin at a
concentration of 200mg/dL may affect recovery.”
In addition, samples spiked with a five-fold excess of EDTA anticoagulant were
compared with normal serum to investigate the effect of a short blood draw on TSI
assay results. Three samples were tested with three different lots of reagents (n = 9
samples). The percent interference for the nine samples ranged from −3.1%–−12.2%,
with an average of −7.8%. Only one of the nine samples showed interference > 10%.
The sponsor has included limitations to this effect in the package insert: "Short Draw
EDTA Plasma samples may result in under-recovery of IMMULITE 2000 TSI
results."
Cross-reactivity:
Cross reactivity in related diseases was evaluated by testing samples from patients
with similar diseases: Addison's disease, Type 1 Diabetes, Systemic Lupus
Erythematosus, and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Bias was evaluated as percentage of
samples with TSI values above the cut-off of 0.55 IU/L. None of the tested samples
were cross reactive with TSI.

f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off was determined by ROC analysis according to CLSI document
EP24-A2. 434 serum samples were tested, consisting of 133 Graves’ disease patient
samples and 301 samples with other thyroid or autoimmune diseases. The cut-off
was established by testing the 434 serum samples against the clinical diagnosis. A
result ≥ 0.55 IU/L indicates that TSI was detected in the sample (hyperthyroid
Graves’ Disease). A result of < 0.55 IU/L indicates that the test is negative for
Graves’ Disease.

were tested using the IMMULITE 2000 TSI assay at two external sites and one
internal site. Samples were tested using the Elecsys Anti-TSHR Immunoassay
(K080092) device at one of the external sites. All of the samples tested were in the
analytical measuring range of both assays. The concordance of the two devices could
be expected to be low given that the predicate device, Elecsys Anti-TSHR
Immunoassay, measures both thyroid receptor stimulating and inhibitory
autoantibodies and the new device, IMMULITE 2000 TSI Assay, measures only
thyroid receptor stimulating antibodies. The following tables show the results of the

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
A total of 765 patient serum samples were collected for the study. Normal samples
were not included in the sensitivity and specificity data analysis as this population
would not normally be tested for TSI. This population was separate from that used to
establish the clinical cut-off.
The samples were collected from four clinical sites and two vendors (US, Canada,
and Germany) and were tested at four different external test sites and one internal
site. The samples were enrolled on the basis of medical diagnosis or if the patients
were suspected of having the disease; their predicate autoantibody status was not used
for inclusion or exclusion of any specimen. ~80% of the samples were from women,
the median patient age was 44 years old and the age range for all patients was 11–94.

An assessment of thyroid status (Hyperthyroid/Euthyroid/Hypothyroid) was
performed by a board-certified physician at the time of enrollment (for both treated
and untreated Graves' disease patients) based on the clinical signs and symptoms.
Clinical assessments were made based on nationally recognized guidelines (e.g., ATA
and AACE). The clinical assessment was then complemented by laboratory tests
(e.g., TSH, T3, T4, FT3, and FT4), RAID, and/or ultrasound scan. These tests may
have been performed at the time of enrollment or collected from the medical records
after the subjects were enrolled in the study. The combination of clinical assessment
and biochemical status formed the basis of classification of subjects into various
categories for the purpose of establishing Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity.
The data are summarized in the following tables:
