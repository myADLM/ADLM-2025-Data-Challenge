4. Special instrument requirements:
VITEK® 2 and VITEK®2 Compact Systems
I. Device Description:
The VITEK® 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling dilution
technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK® 2 test card
contains 64 microwells. A control well containing only culture medium is included on all cards, with
the remaining wells containing premeasured amounts of a specific antimicrobial agent in a culture
medium base. A suspension of organism from a pure culture is prepared in a tube containing 0.45-
0.5% sterile saline and standardized to a McFarland 0.5 using the DensiCHEK Plus™. The VITEK 2
System automatically fills, seals and places the card into the incubator/reader; manual methods can
also be used for the inoculation of test cards for use in the VITEK 2 System. The VITEK 2 Compact has
a manual filling and sealing operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the
card over a defined period of time (up to 18 hours). At the completion of the incubation cycle, a
report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each
antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-GN Ertapenem has the following concentrations in the card: 0.03, 0.12, 0.5 and 2 µg/mL
(equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL). The MIC result range for the
VITEK 2 card is ≤0.12 - ≥8 µg/mL.

L. Test Principle:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics used in the systems use visible light
to directly measure organism growth. Transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a
well before significant growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well
measure organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through the well. The VITEK 2
System monitors the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time. An interpretive
call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a “rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in some
instances. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three sites using ten isolates of gram negative
bacilli that were consistent with the intended use. Isolates were tested in triplicate over
three days for a total of 270 data points. The isolates tested in the reproducibility study
included Enterobacter cloacae (four isolates), E. coli (one isolate), Klebsiella pneumoniae
(three isolates) and Serratia marcescens (two isolates). Inocula were prepared both
manually and using automatic dilution for testing in the VITEK 2. Inocula were prepared
manually for testing in the VITEK 2 Compact. The mode MIC value was determined and the
reproducibility was calculated based on MIC values falling within ± 1 dilution of the mode
MIC value.
Using VITEK 2 and automatic dilution, all results were on scale and the reproducibility was
100%.
Using VITEK 2 and manual dilution, best case reproducibility was 100%; worst case
reproducibility was 99.3%.
Using VITEK 2 Compact and manual dilution, best case reproducibility was 100%; worst case
reproducibility was 98.9%
The reproducibility results were acceptable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
N/A
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Inoculum Density Check. The inoculum density was monitored using the DensiCHEK Plus™
instrument. The DensiCHEK Plus™ was standardized weekly with all results recorded and in
expected range.
Purity Check: A purity check of all organisms was performed at the time of VITEK2 card
inoculation. Only results obtained with pure cultures were evaluated.
Growth Failure Rate: During the course of the study there were no growth failures in the
VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative cards.
Quality Control Testing. The CLSI-recommended QC organism (E. coli ATCC 25922) was
tested using both the VITEK 2 card and the reference method at each site using both the
automatic dilution and manual dilution methods for the VITEK 2 and using the manual
dilution method for the VITEK 2 Compact.
6

--- Page 7 ---
The expected range for E. coli ATCC 25922 with ertapenem is 0.004 – 0.015 µg/mL. Even
though the ertapenem concentrations included in the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card are
0.03, 0.12, 0.5 and 2 µg/mL, the reporting range is ≤0.12 - ≥8 µg/mL. Therefore, all results
for the QC strain were off scale for the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems and were
reported as ≤0.12 µg/mL (Table 2). In response to an FDA request for additional
information regarding production and process controls to verify the performance of the
device, the sponsor indicated that bioMérieux’s internal QC processes and analysis of
growth patterns assure that the device was manufactured correctly. No other QC strains
suitable for the Enterobacteriaceae claim could be identified that would cover the expected
ertapenem MIC ranges based on CLSI or FDA drug label. Therefore, there was no specific
recommendation for any additional QC strains to be tested. Furthermore, the sponsor
included the following footnote to the QC table in the device labeling:
“The VITEK 2 card does not include the full CLSI/FDA-recommended dilution ranges for QC
testing of ertapenem.”

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Results obtained with the bioMérieux VITEK 2 AST - Gram Negative card with ertapenem
were compared to results obtained with the CLSI frozen broth microdilution reference
panel. The VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card with ertapenem contains the following
concentrations of ertapenem: 0.03, 0.12, 0.5 and 2 µg/mL (equivalent standard method
concentration by efficacy in µg/mL) and the reporting range is ≤0.12 - ≥8 µg/mL. The frozen
reference panel contained two-fold serial dilutions with a range of 0.002 to 32 µg/mL.
Test inocula were standardized using the DensiCHEK Plus instrument. VITEK 2 AST – Gram
Negative cards were inoculated using automatic dilution (for reading on the VITEK 2
instrument) or using a manual dilution method (for reading on the VITEK 2 instrument or on
the VITEK 2 COMPACT instrument). Reference panels were inoculated as outlined in the
CLSI document M07-A9.
A total of 541 Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates were evaluated at four sites with VITEK 2
AST – Gram Negative cards inoculated by automatic dilution and interpreted using the VITEK
2 instrument. The majority of isolates were fresh (408 isolates, 75.4%); 122 isolates (24.6%)
were stock isolates.
A total of 136 challenge isolates were tested at two sites. The challenge set was tested with
both card inoculation options (automatic dilution and manual dilution) on the VITEK 2
System and with the manual dilution on the VITEK 2 COMPACT system.
For MICs interpreted using the VITEK 2 System and inoculated using the automatic dilution
method, the combined results from clinical and challenge testing demonstrated a combined
EA of 97.9% and CA of 97.9% (Table 3). A total of 61 isolates were determined to have
evaluable results; the EA of the evaluable results was 77.0%. One challenge isolate was
determined to be resistant by the reference method, but susceptible by VITEK 2, a very
major error. The Performance based on combined clinical and challenge data was
acceptable.

Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the result of the
reference method and that of VITEK 2 test card within plus or minus one serial two-fold
dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on scale for both the VITEK 2
test card and the reference method. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the
interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation
of the VITEK 2 test card.
Challenge isolates interpreted using the VITEK 2 and inoculated using the manual dilution
method demonstrated an EA of 94.1% and a CA of 97.7% (Table 4). A total of 38 isolates
were determined to have evaluable results; the EA of the evaluable results was 78.9%. Two
challenge isolates were determined to be resistant by the reference method, but susceptible
by VITEK 2, very major errors.

A large percentage of the clinical and challenge isolates tested in the evaluation of
ertapenem were either highly susceptible or highly resistant resulting in acceptable overall
EA. Among the evaluable VITEK 2 MIC results, 9 of 61 results (14.8%) were two or three
dilutions lower than results obtained with the reference method; an insufficient number of
isolates with on-scale results were available for additional testing to further evaluate the EA
of evaluable isolates. In order to address the possibility of obtaining very major errors with
VITEK 2 results that were two to three dilutions lower than what would be obtained with
the reference method, the following limitation was added indicating that isolates with MICs
of 0.25 or 0.5 µg/mL should be tested by an alternative method.
“Due to an insufficient number of on-scale isolates available for comparative testing, the
performance of VITEK 2 Gram Negative Ertapenem is unknown for isolates with MICs in
the range of 0.25 – 0.5 µg/mL. To avoid the occurrence of very major errors, isolates
with MICs of 0.25 and 0.5 µg/mL should be retested using another method.”
