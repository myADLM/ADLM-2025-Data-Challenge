L. Test Principle:
Carbon dioxide (in the form of bicarbonate HCO3-) reacts with phosphoenolpyruvate in the
presence of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and magnesium to yield oxaloacetic
acid (OAA) and phosphate. In the presence of malate dehydrogenase, reduced cofactor is
oxidized by OAA. The reduction in absorbance at 415 nm caused by the oxidation of NADH
analogue is proportional to the bicarbonate concentration in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All performance studies were performed on the Randox RX Daytona Plus analyzer.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the Liquid CO2-2 (LCO2-2) test system was determined in accordance
with the CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. The precision study was performed utilizing 2
reagent lots, 2 RX Daytona Plus analyzers using serum based control material and
unaltered human serum samples that were spiked with carbon dioxide concentrations.
Two replicates of each of the control and serum samples were tested on two separate
runs per day for 20 days, leading to the generation of 80 data points for each sample.
The mean, SD, and %CV calculated for within-run and total imprecision for each lot
yielded similar results. The results from one representative lot are shown below.

SD %CV SD %CV
QC Level 3 17.7 0.41 2.3 0.79 4.5
QC Level 2 11.4 0.32 2.8 0.63 5.5
Serum Level 1 11.1 0.22 2.0 0.75 6.7
Serum Level 2 18.8 0.42 2.2 0.93 5.0
Serum Level 3 35.4 0.59 1.7 1.33 3.8
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity of the Liquid CO2-2 (LCO2-2) test system was determined in accordance
with the CLSI EP6-A guideline. Linearity studies were performed using two lots of
reagent on one RX Daytona Plus analyzer. For both studies, samples were prepared
by mixing a high spiked serum sample (55 mEq/dL) with a low diluted serum sample
(4 mEq/dL) to obtain 11 concentrations with each sample assayed in 5 replicates.
The results of linear regression analyses for one representative lot are summarized
below:
y = 0.99x + 0.47; r=0.999
The reportable range of the CO2 assay is 10-40 mEq/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The Liquid CO2-2 Calibrator is traceable to an internal master reference material that
in turn is traceable to Sodium Carbonate NIST reference material 351.
Calibrator
A two-point calibration is recommended every day or with change of reagent lot or as
indicated by quality control procedures. This assay uses a linear calculation and
reagent blank. The Randox Liquid CO2-2 Calibrator is supplied in liquid ready-to-use
form. Calibrator value is lot specific and is provided in the lot-specific insert. An
example of a specific lot calibrator concentration is listed below.
CO2 concentration is 30 mEq/dL (or mmol/L)

Stability
Open-Vial and Real-Time stability studies for the Liquid CO2-2 calibrator and
reagent were performed. The protocols and acceptance criteria for stability were
reviewed and are found to be acceptable. The studies support a shelf life stability
claim of 24 months from the date of manufacture for calibrator and reagent when
stored at 2 to 8°C, an open vial stability claim for the Liquid CO2-2 calibrator of 28
days when stored at 2 to 8°C, and a reagent on board stability claim for the Liquid
CO2-2 reagent of 14 days when stored at 2 to 8°C on-board the RX Daytona Plus
analyzer.
Value Assignment
Calibrators are value assigned in house by testing the calibrator lot against a master
lot and/or a previously QC released lot using one instrument and multiple replicates.
The mean, standard deviation and %CV are calculated and evaluated against
acceptance criteria. The protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to
be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit studies have been carried out in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2
guideline. Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of
Quantification (LoQ) studies were performed on two lots of reagents tested on one
RX Daytona Plus analyzer. The LoB and LoD studies samples were tested in 20
replicates over 3 days. LoQ study samples were tested in 12 replicates over 5 days.
The LoD & LoQ pools consisted of 8 separate pools (4 for each study, total of 8) near
the current bottom of the LCO2-2 serum assay ranges. The 8 LoD / LoQ serum pools
were prepared by diluting patient serum. The LoB pool consisted of artificial serum
base matrix with no carbon dioxide added. LoQ is the lowest concentration that can
be detected with ≤ 20%CV. LoB, LoD and LoQ results are summarized in the
following table:
Analyte LoB LoD LoQ
CO (mEq/L) 0.97 1.98 4.5

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies have been carried out in accordance with CLSI EP7-A2
guideline. Interference testing was performed at 2 different concentrations of sodium
bicarbonate (20 mEq/L and 35 mEq/L) using one RX Daytona Plus analyzer and two
reagent lots. Pooled human serum samples with added potential interferents were
tested in replicates of 10, and compared to a sample without interferent. The sponsor
defined no significant interference as < 10 % difference from the control sample.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Correlation studies were carried out in accordance with CLSI guideline EP9-A2.
Ninety-seven (97) unaltered patient serum samples spanning the range 12.5 to 39.4
mEq/L were tested in singlicate on two lots of Liquid CO2-2 (LCO2-2) reagent on
one RX Daytona plus analyzer and were also tested in singlicate using the predicate
device on one ADVIA 1650 system across 3 working days. The test method was
compared to the predicate device and both lots performed similarly. The linear
regression analysis of one representative lot yielded the following results:
y = 0.97x – 0.11, r = 0.994
b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison studies for Liquid CO2-2 assay were tested on one RX Daytona
plus system and were assessed for two lots of reagents. Both serum and lithium
heparin plasma were tested in singlicate. Patient samples were drawn in matched
pairs – one sample serum (x) and the second sample lithium heparin plasma (y). A
total of 50 matched patient sample pairs were analyzed spanning the range of 12.43 to
38.67 mEq/L for lot 1 and 13.9 to 38.1 mEq/L for lot 2. The samples were comprised
of 44 unaltered patient serum/plasma samples, 4 spiked patient serum/plasma sample
and 2 diluted patient serum/plasma samples. Both lots performed similarly. The linear
regression analysis of one representative lot yielded the following results:
y = 0.97x + 0.94, r = 0.984
Based on the study the sponsor claimed that lithium heparin plasma is an acceptable
matrix for the candidate assay.
