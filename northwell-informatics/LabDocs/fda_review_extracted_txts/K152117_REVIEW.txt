4. Special instrument requirements:
The controls are value assigned for use on hsCRP test systems (instruments and assays)
listed in the proposed device labeling.
I. Device Description:
The Dropper® hsCRP Control is a ready-to-use liquid control that does not require
reconstitution nor frozen storage. The product is supplied in three clinically significant levels
filled to 1mL in plastic dropper bottles. The controls are formulated in a human serum
derived matrix fortified with preservatives and stabilizers to maintain product integrity and
inhibit microbial growth. Each control level is formulated with human CRP antigen to
clinically significant targets that are ideal to monitor high sensitivity CRP test methods.
The three different levels are differentiated by the label and by a distinct color coded cap.
Level 1 has a white cap, Level 2 has a blue cap and Level 3 has a red cap. The control base
matrix derived from human serum spiked with CRP antigen. A single level kit configuration
will be supplied a three 1mL bottles. A multi-level kit configuration will contain 1mL bottle
of each of the three control levels.
The blood donor units comprising the serum are screened for HBs and HBc antigen, HCV,
HIV1, and HIV2, and found to be nonreactive by US FDA accepted methods.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Standard/Guidance documents were not referenced in the submission.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability - The CRP antigen that was used to formulate the Quantimetrix
Dropper® hsCRP High Sensitivity Control was obtained from commercially
available sources. The CRP was gravimetrically added to the serum based control
matrix to achieve the desired target value for each of three control levels by using the
Siemens Dimension® CardioPhase® High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (an assay
standardized and traceable to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry
(IFCC) Reference for Plasma Proteins (CRM 470)).
Value Assignment - The value assignment testing is performed by submitting samples
of a specific lot to be tested to multiple laboratories and Quantimetrix laboratory.
Expected values are established from inter-laboratory and intra-laboratory data using
instrument manufacturer’s reagents. Data are derived from 10 to 20 replicate
analyses and are specific to each lot of product. The device labeling lists mean and

expected range of the three control levels for several clinical chemistry analyzers and
hsCRP methods. The sponsor suggests that each laboratory should establish its own
ranges and specifications for the methods used to measure hsCRP, and that individual
laboratory means should fall within the ranges listed in the device labeling. The
protocol, data and acceptance criteria were found to be adequate.
Stability - Accelerated stability testing demonstrated that the opened control vials are
stable for 90 days at 2-8°C, and for 30 days at room temperature (18-25°C). Based
on an accelerated stability testing per the Kennon Method, the shelf life is claimed as
36 months when stored refrigerated at 2-8°C. Real time stability studies are ongoing
and performed for every new lot production. The stability study protocol and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be adequate.
