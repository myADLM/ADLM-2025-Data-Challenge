1. Intended use(s):
Refer to Indications for Use
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Instant-View® Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup (Home Use) and Instant-View® Multi-
Drug Urine Test Panel (Home Use) are rapid, qualitative immunoassays for the detection
in human urine of one or more of the drugs at the cutoff concentrations listed below.
These devices will detect up to 13 of the drugs below in any combination. The tests are
not intended to distinguish prescription use or abuse of any drugs.

These devices provide only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate
chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result.
Chromatography/mass spectrometry is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test
result, particularly when preliminary positive results are obtained.
This test is intended for over-the-counter (OTC) consumer use as the first step in a two
step process to provide consumers, including but not limited to concerned parents, with
information concerning the presence or absence of the above stated drugs or their
metabolites in a urine sample. Information regarding confirmatory testing- the second
step in the process, is provided in the package labeling.
Tests for prescription drugs will yield preliminary positive results when these drugs are

I. Device Description:
The Instant View Multi-Drug Urine Test Devices/Cup and the Instant View Multi-Drug
Urine Test Devices/Panel Cassettes are one-step lateral flow chromatographic
immunoassays. Each device consists of any combination of one to thirteen individual test
strips(s) for the analytes(s) being tested. Each test strip in the device consists of 1) a
conjugate pad containing colloidal gold coupled with the anti-drug antibodies and 2)
nitrocellulose membrane containing a test line (T line) coated with the conjugated drug
antigen and a control line (C line). The C line serves as an internal quality control of the
system and appears as a burgundy –colored band during the test regardless of the presence of
the drug.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle:
Each device employs lateral flow immunochromatographic technology and is based on the
principle of competitive binding. Drugs, if present in concentrations below the cutoff level,
will not saturate the binding sites of the antibody coated particles on the drug specific test
strips. The goat-anti-rabbit IgG antibody-coated particles will then be captured by
immobilized drug-specific conjugate. If the level of drug in the urine specimen is below the
cutoff concentration, the T line appears as a visible burgundy line. If the level of drug in the
urine specimen is above the cutoff, no T line develops.
The control line (C line) serves as an internal quality control. The control line should always
appear as a burgundy-colored band regardless of the presence of the drug, if enough sample
volume has been added to the test and if the sample has correctly migrated up the test strip.
Testing is based on the principle of a competitive immunochemical reaction between a
chemically labeled drug (drug-protein conjugate) and the drug or drug metabolites which
may be present in the urine sample competing for the limited antibody binding sites.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
This multi-drug test was cleared for prescription use only in k063545. Twelve analytes of the
candidate devices were previously cleared for OTC use in k131645. The candidate devices
contain test strips identical to k063545 and k131645. Specimen matrix, test formats, and cut-
off concentrations and analytes tested are also identical.
Lay user testing for buprenorphine, the only analyte not previously cleared for OTC use, is
described in section 3.c. below.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 400 lay persons
testing cup and panel devices. A total of 210 females and 190 males tested the
devices. They had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in
age from 18 to >60 years. The participants had no previous experience with an over
the counter (OTC) drug test. Urine samples were prepared at the following
concentrations: negative, ± 50%, ± 25% of the cutoff by spiking drugs into drug free-
pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by
GC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers and blind-labeled.
Each participant was provided with the package inserts for the test cup and the test
panel and performed the test independently without additional help.
The lay user study results are summarized in the tables below:
