L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone immunoassay is based on a competitive test
principle with anti-testosterone (sheep, monoclonal) coated paramagnetic microparticles and
chemiluminescence detection. In the first step, sample, assay specific diluent and anti-
testosterone (sheep, monoclonal) coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined.
Testosterone present in the sample binds to the anti-testosterone coated microparticles. After
incubation, testosterone acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to the reaction mixture. After
further incubation and washing, Pre-Trigger and Trigger solutions are added to the reaction
mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs).
The concentration of testosterone is interpolated from a calibration curve established with
calibrators of known testosterone concentration.
In order to obtain the free testosterone index (FTI) or Free Androgen index (FAI) result, the
ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone assay and the Abbott ARCHITECT SHBG
assays are utilized and are measured at the same time when the sample is tested on the
analyzer. The free testosterone index (%FTI) or free androgen index (%FAI) was obtained
using the following equation:
FTI or FAI (%) = ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone Value (nmol/L) x100
ARCHITECT SHBG (nmol/L)

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Reference ranges are assay dependent for total testosterone, sex hormone-binding
globulin (SHBG) and the free testosterone index (FTI). FTI is calculated from the total
testosterone and SHBG results. Therefore, to determine the reference range for the FTI,
new reference range studies were performed to obtain expected human SHBG and total
testosterone values for apparently healthy males (n = 307) and females (n = 349) using
the ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone assay and the Abbott ARCHITECT
SHBG assays. The free testosterone index (%FTI) or free androgen index (%FAI) was
obtained using the following equation:
FTI or FAI (%) = ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone Value (nmol/L) x100
ARCHITECT SHBG (nmol/L)
The expected values for total testosterone, SHBG, and FTI are presented in the tables

of specimen and demographic variables such as age and sex, as applicable).
