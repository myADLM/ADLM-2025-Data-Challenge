L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT SHBG assay is a two-step immunoassay to determine the presence of
SHBG in human serum and plasma using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay
(CMIA) technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex. In the first step,
sample, assay diluent, and anti-SHBG coated paramagnetic micro-particles are combined.
SHBG present in the sample binds to anti-SHBG coated micro-particles. After washing, the
SHBG binds to the anti-SHBG acridinium-labeled conjugate that is added in the second step.
Following another wash cycle, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction
mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs).
A direct relationship exists between the amount of SHBG in the sample and the RLUs
detected by the ARCHITECT i System optics. The concentration of SHBG in the sample is
determined by comparing the chemiluminescent signal in the reaction to the ARCHITECT
SHBG calibration.
In order to obtain the Free testosterone index (FTI) or Free Androgen index (FAI) result, the
ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone assay and the Abbott ARCHITECT SHBG
assays are utilized and are measured at the same time when the sample is tested on the
analyzer. The free testosterone index (%FTI) or free androgen index (%FAI) was obtained
using the following equation:
FTI or FAI (%) = ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone Value (nmol/L) x100
ARCHITECT SHBG (nmol/L)

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Reference ranges are assay dependent for total testosterone, sex hormone-binding
globulin (SHBG) and the free testosterone index (FTI). FTI is calculated from the total
testosterone and SHBG results. The new FTI/FAI expected values study was performed
on a minimum of 120 samples from individuals in the following categories: normal males
21-49 years of age, normal males ≥ 50 years of age, premenopausal normal females 21-
49 years of age, and postmenopausal normal females ≥ 50 years of age not on hormone
replacement therapy. The following inclusion/exclusion criteria apply to the study:
Samples that were within the expected values of the ARCHITECT 2nd Generation
Testosterone (LN 2P13) reagent insert and the ARCHITECT SHBG (LN 8K26) reagent
insert were included in the study. The free testosterone index (%FTI) or free androgen
index (%FAI) was obtained using the following equation:
FTI or FAI (%) = ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone Value (nmol/L) x100
ARCHITECT SHBG (nmol/L)
