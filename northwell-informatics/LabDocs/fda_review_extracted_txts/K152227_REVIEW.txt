L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys Cortisol II assay is a competition test principle using a monoclonal antibody
which is specifically directed against cortisol. Endogenous cortisol which has been liberated
from binding proteins with danazol competes with exogenous cortisol derivative in the test
which has been labeled with ruthenium complex for the binding sites on the biotinylated
antibody. Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument-specifically
generated by 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
i.) Linearity of serum using the Elecsys Cortisol II assay was evaluated following
CLSI guideline EP6-A on the cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzer. A high serum
pooled cortisol sample was diluted with Diluent Universal (protein matrix). A total of
19 levels of cortisol concentrations were tested. The cortisol concentrations range
from 1.66-1898 nmol/L. Samples were assayed in triplicate within a single run.
Statistical evaluation using linear regression showed that the assay is linear from
2.854 -1898 nmol/L, yielding a linear regression result of y = 1.014x – 1.41 with a
correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.9995

ii.) Linearity of Lithium Heparin plasma using the Elecsys Cortisol II assay was
evaluated following CLSI guidelines EP6-A on the cobas e 411 immunoassay. A
high plasma pooled cortisol sample was diluted with Diluent Universal (protein
matrix). A total of 19 concentrations were tested. The cortisol concentrations range
from 1.71 – 1959 nmol/L. Samples were assayed in triplicate within a single run.
Statistical evaluation using linear regression showed that the assay is linear from
2.94– 1959 nmol/L, yielding a linear regression result of y = 1.004x – 1.75 with a
correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.9982.
The results of the linearity study support the sponsors claim that the assay is linear
throughout the claimed measuring range of 3 to 1750 nmol/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability/Standardization
The Elecsys Cortisol II assay has been standardized against the reference materials
(IRMM/IFCC-451 panel) which were value assigned by the reference measurement
procedure (ID-GC/MS (isotope dilution-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry).
Ghent University’s ID-GC/MS is a recognized reference method procedure used to
assign the reference materials.
Stability
The shelf-life, accelerated, and open-vial stability testing protocols for the Cortisol II
CalSet calibrators and the acceptance criteria were described and found to be
acceptable.
Cortisol II CalSet calibrator are stable until expiration date (3 months) when stored at
-20 ºC. The Cortisol CalSet calibrator open vial on the analyzer at 20 – 25 °C is stable
for 4 hours and should only be used once.
Value Assignment of Calibrators
For each Cortisol II CalSet manufactured, the calibrators are run in duplicate on at
least three (3) cobas e 411 analyzers and at least three (3) Modular Analytics
E170/cobas e 601/cobas e 602 analyzers with all Cortisol II reagent lots available.
The assigned value of each calibrator is defined as the mean value obtained over at
least six (6) runs on at least three (3) analyzers of the respective calibrator. The exact
lot-specific calibrator values are encoded on the calibrator bottle label as well as
printed on the calibrator barcode sheet provided or electronically available.

d. Detection limit:
The limit of Blank (LoB) of the Elecsys Cortisol II assay on the cobas e 411
Immunoassay analyzer was determined according to CLSI EP17-A2. Two reagent
lots, two cobas e 411 instruments, five blank samples, one replicate per sample per
run, two runs per day for three days for a total of 60 determinations were performed.
The zero-level (blank) samples used were prepared by diluting the native human
serum pool with the Universal Diluent. The LoB was defined as the 95th percentile
of measurements of blank samples. The linear interpolation between the 57th and 58th
replicate yields a LoB of the following:
Reagent Lot LoB
(nmol/L)
1 0.5270
2 0.6645
The LoB was determined to be = 1.0 nmol/L
The limit of Detection (LoD) of the Elecsys Cortisol II assay on the cobas e 411
Immunoassay analyzer was determined according to CLSI EP17-A2. LoD was
defined as the lowest amount of cortisol in a sample that can be detected with 95%
probability. Two reagent lots, two cobas e 411 instruments, five low cortisol level
samples, one replicate per sample per run, two runs per day, for 3 days for a total of
60 replicates per sample per reagent lot were performed. A low-level sample set of 5
human serum samples (diluted human serum pools) of known cortisol concentration
was evaluated for each reagent lot, with the results obtained as follows.
LoD = LoB + 1.653 x SD total (of low cortisol samples)
Reagent Lot LoD
1 1.1227
2 1.2846
LoD was determined to be = 1.5 nmol/L
The limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the Elecsys Cortisol II assay on the cobas e 411
Immunoassay analyzer was determined according to CLSI EP17-A2. Three reagent
lots, two cobas e 411 instruments, nine low level serum samples, two replicate per
sample per run, two runs per day for three days were performed. A low-level sample
set of 9 human serum samples (diluted human serum pools) of known cortisol
concentration was evaluated for each reagent lot. For each reagent lot, the sample
with the lowest cortisol concentration that meets the specifications for precision is
taken as the LoQ, with the results obtained as follows. The LoQ is set to 3.0 nmol/L
with a precision of ≤ 20% CV.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference Study Protocol:
An interference study was performed following the CLSI Guideline EP7-A2
guideline using human serum samples with cortisol concentrations 24.2, 476, and
1314 nmol/L. Interference substances were spiked into the serum samples and the
results were measured and compared between the spiked and unspiked samples.
The interference from the following compounds was observed to be ≤ 10% (non-
significant interference) at the levels indicated.

The package insert contains the following limitations:
“Pregnancy, contraceptives and estrogen therapy give rise to elevated cortisol
concentrations.”
“In rare cases, interference due to extremely high titers of antibodies to analyte-
specific antibodies, streptavidin or ruthenium can occur. These effects are minimized
by suitable test design.”
Exogenous Drug Interference:
16 pharmaceutical compounds were spiked into two human serum samples with
cortisol concentrations of approximately 170 and 750 nmol/L. The two sample pools
were divided into aliquots and spiked with the potential interferents. The cortisol

The effects of the presence of human anti-sheep antibodies (HASA) on the Elecsys
Cortisol II assay was conducted using the cobas e 411 analyzer and two serum
samples with cortisol concentrations of 172 and 789 nmol/L. Both samples were
divided into two aliquots each. One aliquot was spiked with 20 µg/mL of donkey
anti-sheep polyclonal antibodies (DASA) and then diluted with the unspiked aliquot
of the serum in 10% increments. The recovery for each sample was calculated by
comparison to the unspiked reference samples.
No effect of DASA up to 20μg/mL on the Cortisol result has been observed.
Cross reactivity Study Protocol:
The specificity of the Elecsys Cortisol assay was determined using two human serum
sample pools (diluted and spiked) with potential cross-reactant compounds. The
analyte concentration of the samples was approximately 60 and 300 µg/L of cortisol.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed to compare the Elecsys Cortisol II assay
(candidate device) to the current Elecsys Cortisol assay (predicate device). A total of
536 human serum samples (all native single donors) with cortisol values ranged
between10.55-1735 nmol/L were assayed in singlcate on the cobas e 411. The
regression analysis results are summarized below:
N 536
Range (nmol/L) 9.21-1680
Passing/Bablok Deming
Slope 0.758 0.806
intercept (nmol/L) 10.2 -10.31
Correlation coefficient (r) 0.9676
The slope showed a significant bias and shift between the candidate device and the
predicate device, however this shift is expected because the purpose of the device
modification was to standardize against the IRMM (Institute for Reference Materials
and Measurements)/IFCC-451 panel to both improve the specificity (cross-reactivity)
and the accuracy of the assay. Therefore, test results from the candidate device do
not, and are not expected to, directly correlate with test results from the predicate
device. Laboratories that use the Roche Elecsys Cortisol assay should be aware of
the significantly different performance of the modified assay.
An additional method comparison study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy
between the candidate device and a recognized reference measurement procedure,
University of Ghent’s ID- GC-MS method (RMP). The method comparison against
the RMP was the basis of the substantial equivalency determination.
A total of 208 human serum samples (all native single donors) were measured in
order to cover the entire measuring range. Cortisol values ranged between 10.9–1599
nmol/L for the LC-MS and between 10.6 – 1711 nmol/L for the Elecsys Cortisol II
assay.

A matrix comparison study using different tube type was performed to demonstrate
equivalency of the specimen types. The effect on quantitation of analyte in the
presence of anticoagulants with the Elecsys Cortisol II Immunoassay was determined
by comparing values obtained from samples drawn into serum, Li-heparin plasma
(with and without gel), K2-and K3-EDTA plasma primary tubes.
Specimen Type n Slope Range Intercept Correlation
(nmol/L) Coefficient ( r )
Serum / Li-Heparin Plasma 48 0.987 5.22 - 1729 -0.418 0.987
Serum / Li-Heparin (Gel) 48 0.991 5.22 - 1729 -1.02 0.973
Plasma
Serum / K2-EDTA Plasma 48 0.985 5.22 - 1729 -0.564 0.980
Serum / K3-EDTA Plasma 58 0.966 4.49 - 1729 -0.882 0.966
Sponsor claimed that Lithium heparin plasma, K2 EDTA plasma, and K3 EDTA
plasma are acceptable sample type for the Cortisol II assay.

Cortisol in serum:
5th‑95th percentile:
Morning hours 6‑10 a.m.: 166‑507 nmol/L (6.02‑18.4 μg/dL), n = 296*
Afternoon hours 4‑8 p.m.: 73.8‑291 nmol/L (2.68‑10.5 μg/dL), n = 300
2.5th‑97.5th percentile:
Morning hours 6‑10 a.m.: 133‑537 nmol/L (4.82‑19.5 μg/dL), n = 296*
Afternoon hours 4‑8 p.m.: 68.2‑327 nmol/L (2.47‑11.9 μg/dL), n = 300
* Four samples were excluded from data analysis because samples were drawn outside
the time of 6-10 am.
The sponsor states in the package insert each laboratory should investigate the
transferability of the expected values to its own patient population and if necessary
determine its own reference ranges.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
