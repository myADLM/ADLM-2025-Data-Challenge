L. Test Principle:
The test consists of two parts; a pre-analytical hair treatment procedure (to extract Cocaine
from the solid hair matrix to a measurable liquid matrix), and the screening assay. The
screening assay is an Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA).
This assay requires a sample of head hair (approximately 120 strands) that is cut as close as
possible to the scalp, preferably from the back of the head at the crown. The hair sample is
treated with a pre-analytical treatment to extract cocaine from the hair into a liquid sample.
The liquid sample is added to a well of the microplate and enzyme conjugate is added,
followed by incubation. During this phase the enzyme-labeled drug conjugate competes with
drug in the liquid sample for a limited number of binding sites on the mouse antibody-coated
micro wells. A wash solution is applied to remove any unbound materials. Enzyme substrate
solution containing a chromogen is added. The reaction is stopped with an acid and the
absorbance is read using a plate reader at 450 nm and a background reading is also taken at
620 nm. Color intensity is inversely proportional to the amount of drug present in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
Calibrator and controls are prepared from Certified Reference Material Cerilliant C-
008 Cocaine 1.0 mg/mL in Acetonitrile.
Stability
Shelf-life: The accelerated and real-time stability support the shelf-life of 6 months
for the reagent kit (including calibrators and controls), stored at 2-8oC.
Open vial stability: The study support an open vial claim of 30 days, stored at 2-8oC
for all kit components, including the cutoff calibrator and controls.
Hair Specimen Stability: Established in k023626.
Shipping study:
In order to demonstrate the stability of cocaine in hair specimens during the shipping
process, 56 hair samples- twenty eight (28) confirmed positive cocaine hair
specimens, of which three specimens (3) have pre-shipping quantitative GC/MS
results in the near cutoff positive concentration range (300 to 449 pg/mg Cocaine)
and twenty eight (28) confirmed negative cocaine hair specimens, of which three (3)
have pre-shipping quantitative GC/MS results in the near cutoff negative
concentration range (150 to 299 pg/mg Cocaine) were shipped to eight different
geographical locations and the temperatures tracked during shipping. By enclosing an
electronic temperature sensor within each shipment of hair samples, we were able to
retrieve a range of temperatures collected every 20 minutes during the shipping
process. In order to mimic potential shipping extreme temperatures, the hair was first

cold shocked at -15°C for 15 hours and then heat shocked at +47°C for 6 hours prior
to shipping.
After the boxes were returned to facility, ELISA screening and GC/MS confirmation
were performed on each sample and compared to the non-shipped results for the same
samples. The cocaine negative samples that were shipped maintained their negative
status both for ELISA screening and GC/MS with respect to cocaine levels. One of
the borderline negative samples originally screened positive prior to shipping and all
three of the borderline negative samples screened positive after shipping due to
variability near the cutoff of the ELISA screening method. The cocaine positive
samples that were shipped maintained their positive status for both the ELISA
screening and the GC/MS confirmation with respect to cocaine levels.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
One hundred and forty three commonly used compounds, many of them prescribed
medicines, and abused drugs, were tested in the study. These compounds are not
pharmacologically or structurally related to Cocaine. Each compound was tested at
10,000 ng/mL (equivalent to 300,000 pg/mg of hair), in hair matrix pools at two
cocaine concentrations, equivalent to 50% below (150 pg/mg) and 50% above (450
pg/mg) the Cocaine cutoff value of 300 pg/mg.
Prepared samples were run in singlet on the Quest Diagnostics Hair Cocaine ELISA.
If the OD of the above cutoff pool samples spiked with compound of interest was
positive (had an OD lower than or equal to the cutoff), then the tested compounded
was considered to not negatively interfere. If either the below cutoff pool spiked
sample or above cutoff pool spiked sample had a response that showed interference,
that sample was diluted 1 :2 in corresponding below cutoff pool or above cutoff pool
until no interference was observed.
The lists of compounds that do not interfere are listed in the table below and are
provided in the product labeling.

Cross-reactivity
Cocaine, structurally-related compounds, pharmacologically-related compounds, and
metabolites were tested for cross-reactivity in the assay. Eleven (11) compounds,
structurally related to cocaine and known cocaine metabolites, were selected for the
study (see table below for the list). The cross-reactant solutions were prepared by
adding the compounds to negative hair matrix. The concentrations listed below
produced a result approximately equal to the cutoff calibrator.
Serial dilutions of each compound were prepared and analyzed. If the OD response of
the spiked sample was positive then the spiked sample was diluted further with finer
dilutions until a positive result was obtained with an OD within 5% of the cutoff
value (sample OD/Cutoff OD). Cross reactivity was calculated as: (Cutoff
Concentration/Lowest Cross Reactant Concentration with a Positive Result) x 100.

Cosmetic treatment
A panel of sixty (60) confirmed positive cocaine hair samples and sixty (60) screened
negative cocaine hair samples were either treated with one of five (5) cosmetic hair
treatments or left untreated. Cocaine positive hair is defined as a hair sample
confirmed by GC/MS as having greater than 300 pg/mg cocaine. Absorbance
readings after treatment were compared to absorbance readings prior to treatment,
with the resulting change and direction of change noted. The resulting changes in
ELISA test results are also noted, and are included in the table(s) below. (Absorbance
values are normalized to the absorbance value of the cutoff calibrator absorbance
value.)

This study agrees with the extensive published literature that use of various cosmetic hair
treatments can potentially reduce the amount of drugs and drug metabolites detected in
hair specimens. It is possible that a cosmetic hair treatment could cause a negative hair
sample to read positive or a positive hair sample to read negative. These effects are
dependent upon the nature of the hair specimen and the treatment used and independent
