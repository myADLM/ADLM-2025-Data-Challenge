L. Test Principle:
This is a two reagent assay for the in vitro quantitative determination of vancomycin in human
serum or plasma on automated clinical chemistry analyzers. One reagent comprises vancomycin
antibody covalently coupled to microparticles. The second reagent comprises a drug
(vancomycin) conjugate linked to a macromolecule. The kinetic interaction (aggregation) of
antibody-coupled microparticles in solution is induced by binding of the drug conjugate to the
antibody and is inhibited by the presence of Vancomycin in the sample. The resulting kinetic
interaction is measured by absorbance and is indirectly proportional to the amount of drug
present in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision (within-run precision) and intermediate precision (between-day precision)
were assessed in accordance with CLSI Guideline EP5-A2 using three levels of
control solutions (TDM Control set, k070200) and human serum spiked to five
different Vancomycin levels. Samples were run in duplicate, twice per day per day,
for 21 days, on a single analyzer using 3 lots of reagent.
The within-run precision data are summarized in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To assess linearity of the assay, the sponsor conducted a linearity study according to
CLSI EP-6A. A sixteen level dilution series was prepared for serum and plasma
samples using spiked human serum and plasma pools. Concentrations of each sample
in the dilution series (serum: 0, 2.97, 3.96, 4.95, 5.94, 6.93, 7.92, 8.91, 9.90, 19.80,
29.70, 39.6, 49.5, 59.4, 69.3, 79.2, 89.1, 99.0 µg/mL; plasma: 0, 3.07, 4.09, 5.11,

µg/mL) were calculated based on measurement of a sample at the mid-point of the
claimed measuring range. Each sample was measured in triplicate, measured results
were compared to calculated sample concentrations, and percent relative recovery
calculated.

Percent recovery for serum samples ranged from 85.6 to 109.2%. Percent recovery
for plasma samples ranged from 80.8 to 105.6%. The results support the claimed
measuring range of 4.0 to 80.0 µg/mL vancomycin in serum and plasma.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls and Calibrators
The Preciset TDM 1 Calibrators contain known quantities of vancomycin in normal
human serum and are traceable to primary master calibrators ; these calibrators were
cleared under k031856. The TDM Control Set contains liquid controls based on
human serum and is traceable to USP reference standards; the controls were cleared
under k070200. Protocols and acceptance criteria for stability and value assignment
of calibrators and controls were previously reviewed in k031856 and k070200 and
found acceptable.
Reagent Stability – closed vial
Protocols and acceptance criteria for ongoing real-time closed-vial (shelf life)
stability studies were reviewed and found acceptable to support storage of reagents
between 2-8°C until the expiration date printed on the bottle. Real time closed-vial
stability studies are ongoing.
Reagent Stability – on board
Protocols and acceptance criteria for on-board reagent stability were reviewed and
found acceptable to support the claim that reagents are stable when refrigerated in use
on board the analyzer for up to 12 weeks.
d. Detection limits:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
studies were performed based on CLSI EP17-A2 and as described below:
Limit of Blank (LoB):
To determine LoB, 5 analyte-free samples was measured in duplicate on two
instruments, with two runs per day, using three lots of reagent, over three days, for a
total of 180 measurements. The sponsor defined LoB as the concentration below
which analyte-free samples could be found with a probability of 95%. Results of the
study support the sponsor’s claimed LoB of 1.0 µg/mL.
Limit of Detection (LOD):
To determine LoD, 5 low-analyte samples were measured in duplicate on two
instruments, using three lots of reagent, over three days, for a total of 180
measurements. The sponsor defined LoD as the lowest analyte concentration which
could be detected, with a value above the LoB, with a probability of 95%. Results of
the study support the sponsor’s claimed LoB of 1.5 µg/mL.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
To determine LoQ, fifteen human serum samples were spiked with vancomycin to
cover the analyte concentration range between LoB and 2x the expected LoQ. These
6

--- Page 7 ---
samples were measured in duplicate in six runs over four days using three lots of
reagent and one analyzer, for a total of 36 measurements per sample. Expected values
for each sample were determined using LCMS/MS. Total Error (TE) was calculated
based on precision and accuracy for each sample using the formula TE = √(s2+Bias2)
where s = standard deviation. LoQ was defined as the lowest vancomycin
concentration with a total error less than 20%, and above which all samples also had a
total error less than 20%. Results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed LoQ of
4.0 µg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous interferents
The sponsor evaluated the effects of known potential endogenous interferents
(hemoglobin, triglycerides, bilirubin, rheumatoid factor, protein, and HAMA) on the
ONLINE TDM Vancomycin Gen.3 assay using human serum pools prepared with
low (≈7.5 µµg/mL) or intermediate (≈30µg/mL) vancomycin levels. The test ranges
were: hemoglobin >1000 mg/dL, triglycerides >1000 mg/dL, conjugated bilirubin
>60 mg/dL, unconjugated bilirubin >60 mg/dL, rheumatoid factor >1200 IU/mL, total
protein 2-12 g/dL.
The sponsor tested potential interference from IgA, IgG, IgM and albumin using
human serum samples spiked with low (≈7.5 µg/mL), intermediate (≈30µg/mL) and
high (≈60 µg/mL) vancomycin levels.
Measurements from samples containing potential endogenous interferent were
compared to measurements from sample containing no potential interferent and the
percent recovery was calculated. The results demonstrated no interference from these
potential endogenous interferents at the concentrations shown below:
Hemoglobin up to 1000 mg/dL
Conjugated bilirubin up to 60 mg/dL
Unconjugated bilirubin up to 60 mg/dL
Triglycerides up to 1000 mg/dL
Total Protein up to 12 g/dL
Rheumatoid Factor up to 1200 IU/mL
IgA up to 16 g/L
IgG up to 70 g/L
IgM up to 10 g/L
Albumin up to 70g/L
The sponsor included the following statements in their labeling regarding human anti-
mouse antibodies (HAMA) and IgM interference:
As with any assay employing mouse antibodies, the possibility exists for interference
by human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) in the sample, which could cause falsely
lowered results.
In very rare cases, gammopathy, in particular type IgM (Waldenström’s
7

--- Page 8 ---
macroglobulinemia), may cause unreliable results.
Interference from common therapeutic substances
The sponsor evaluated interference from therapeutic substances using human serum
pools prepared to low (≈7.5 µg/mL) or intermediate (≈30µg/mL) vancomycin levels
and spiked with concentrations of potential therapeutic interferents at concentrations
identified in CLSI EP7-A2 or higher. Measurements from samples containing
potential interferent were compared to measurements from sample containing no
potential interferent. The sponsor defined significant interference as recovery relative
to the no-interferent sample of within ±1.0µg/mL for the low vancomycin
concentration and within ±10% for the intermediate vancomycin concentration. These
criteria were met for the following substances at the concentrations indicated in the
table below:

Metronidazole 200 µg/mL
Phenylbutazone 400 mg/L
Rifampicin 60 mg/L
Theophylline 100 mg/L
Cross Reactivity
The sponsor tested for cross reactivity using human serum pools prepared to low
(≈7.5 µg/mL) or intermediate (≈30µg/mL) vancomycin levels and spiked with
concentrations of potential cross-reacting substance at typical or higher than expected
therapeutic serum concentrations. Measurements from samples containing potential
cross reactant were compared to measurements from samples containing no potential
cross reactant. Absolute difference in measured vancomycin levels between samples
with and without cross reactant and percent cross reactivity (100x absolute difference
/ concentration of cross reactant) were calculated. The following potential cross-
reacting substances showed no significant cross reaction, defined by the sponsor as a
difference of <1.5µg/mL in the presence and absence of potential cross reactant at the

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor tested 125 native human serum samples from patients taking
Vancomycin, ranging in concentration from 4.8 to 76 µg/mL as measured with the
candidate device. Eight samples were altered at the upper end of the measuring range
(above ≈60µg/mL vancomycin). The samples were tested in singlicate using the
candidate and predicate device and analyzed using Passing Bablok regression which
yielded the following regression equation: y = 0.993x + 0.641, r = 0.994. A mean bias
of 4.4% was observed across all data points.
The sponsor conducted an additional method comparison of 134 native human serum
samples from patients taking Vancomycin, ranging from 4.1 to 76 µg/mL as
measured with the candidate device. Thirty four samples were altered across the
measuring range. The samples were tested in singlicate using the candidate device
and by liquid-chromatography/mass-spectrometry (LC/MS) and analyzed using
weighted Deming regression, with a weighting of 1/concentration2. This analysis
yielded the following regression equation: y = 0.992 x + 0.841, r = 0.991. A mean
bias of 5.7% was observed across all data points.
b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed using 77 or 78 matched samples (serum
and K -EDTA, serum and K -EDTA, serum and Li-Heparin). Each sample set
2 3
comprised 67 full tubes and 9 or 10 half-filled tubes. Only samples within the
measuring range of 4-80 µg/mL were used. In each case, serum was used as the
comparator matrix. Results of linear regression analyses are summarized below:
1. K -EDTA plasma vs. serum: y = 0.998x + 0.00194, r = 0.996
2
2. K -EDTA vs. serum: y = 0.995x - 0.128, r=0.995
3
3. Li-Heparin plasma vs. serum: y = 1.01x – 0.224, r = 0.996

5. Expected values/Reference range:
In the labeling, the sponsor states:
The practice of routine monitoring and adjustment of serum vancomycin concentrations
has been the subject of intense debate for many years.1 Historically trough
concentrations between 5 to 10 μg/mL and peak concentrations between 20 to 40 μg/mL
were generally accepted for therapeutic effectiveness.1-3 The increased prevalence of
resistant organisms, increasing vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations in target
pathogens (particularly MRSA) and vancomycin failures have prompted more aggressive
vancomycin dosing practices and recommendations.1,4 Therefore, current guidelines
recommend higher trough concentrations in the range of 10‑15 μg/mL for uncomplicated
MRSA bacteremia and even 15‑20 μg/mL in cases of sustained MRSA bacteremia or
endocarditis and other severe invasive MRSA infections (i.e. prosthetic joint infections,
hospital‑acquired pneumonia or central nervous system infections).1,5
However, higher doses of vancomycin used have been associated with significantly
higher vancomycin trough levels, resulting in acute renal failure and ototoxicity.4,6-8 The
decision to target increased vancomycin trough concentrations should be based on an
assessment of the severity of the infection and must consider the toxic risk associated
with increased vancomycin levels.
Each laboratory should investigate the transferability of the expected values to its own
patient population and if necessary determine its own reference ranges.
