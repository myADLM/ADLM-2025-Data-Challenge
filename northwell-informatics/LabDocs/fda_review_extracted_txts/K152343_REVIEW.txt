L. Test Principle:
The Randox Direct Bilirubin Assay for RX Daytona Plus system uses a quantitative
colorimetric method for detection of direct bilirubin. Direct bilirubin is oxidized by vanadate
at approximately pH 3.0 to produce biliverdin. There are inhibitors present which prevent the
oxidation of any indirect bilirubin. This oxidation reaction causes a decrease in the optical
density of the yellow color, which is specific to bilirubin. The decrease in optical density at
450/546 nm is proportional to the direct bilirubin concentration in the sample. The
concentration is measured as an endpoint reaction.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All studies were conducted on the RX Daytona Plus system.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated consistent with C.L.S.I standard EP5-A2. Precision studies
were performed by two operators, on two RX Daytona Plus systems using control
material and unaltered human serum samples that were spiked with direct
(conjugated) bilirubin. Testing was conducted using two reagent lots, one lot on each
RX Daytona plus system, twice per day for 20 non-consecutive days. Two replicates
per run were performed for each sample. No assay re-calibrations were required
throughout the duration of the study. Both reagent lots yielded similar results. The
results from one representative lot are summarized below.

Serum Pool 4 8.41 0.13 1.5 0.16 1.9
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor claims a linear range of 0.1 mg/dL to 12.6 mg/dL. Linearity studies were
performed at 11 levels in accordance with CLSI standard EP6-Awith concentrations
ranging from 0.12 to 12.6 mg/dL. Each level was run in replicates of five on two lots
of direct bilirubin reagent on one RX Daytona Plus system. Both reagent lots yielded
similar results. The results from one representative lot are summarized in the table
below.
Linear Regression Equation and Correlation Coefficient
Slope 1.01
Intercept -0.07
r 0.9995
The reportable range of the candidate device is 0.1 mg/dL to 12.6 mg/dL.
Dilution Protocol:
The RX Daytona Plus analyzer has an auto-dilution feature that is automatically
activated when measuring samples >12.6mg/dL. Samples >12.6mg/dL are diluted (x
1.52) with 0.9% saline before testing, and re-measured to obtain values within the
measuring range (0.1-12.6 mg/dL).
A dilution study was performed using the auto-dilution function against manual
dilution, and the results supported the sponsor’s claim that the instrument could
automatically dilute the sample.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Randox Calibration Serum Level 3 is traceable to an internal master calibrator for
direct bilirubin; internal master calibrator is traceable to NIST SRM916 (a). Randox
Calibration Serum Level 3 has been previously cleared in k053153.

Reagent Stability:
Sponsor provided real time stability study protocol and acceptance criteria, and these
were found to be acceptable. The reagent is stable up to the expiry date when stored
at +2°C to +8°C.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limits study was performed in accordance with CLSI guideline EP17-
A2. Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification
(LoQ) determinations were performed using two lots of reagents on one RX Daytona
Plus analyzer. The LoB was based on 60 replicates of blank sample. LoD was based
on 240 determinations, with 4 low levels samples; 60 samples per level. The LoQ
was determined by the lowest detected concentration at which the imprecision was <
20% CV. Both reagent lots yielded similar results. The results from one
representative lot (with the highest value) are summarized below.
LoB 0.006 mg/dL
LoD 0.064 mg/ dL
LoQ 0.133 mg/dL
The direct bilirubin assay has a claimed measuring range of 0.1 to 12.6 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The interference study was performed using two concentrations of interfering
substances according to the CLSI guideline EP7-A2. The effects of potential
interferent were determined by calculating the mean value of the spiked interferent
with the corresponding control solution. The spiked sample results were compared to
control samples prepared without the potential interferent.
Sponsor defined no significant interference as a difference of <10% between the
measured concentration from spiked pool sample to the match sample with no
interferent (control).
The analytes detailed below were tested up to the levels indicated at Bilirubin
concentrations of 0.14 mg/dL and 5.03 mg/dL, and found no significant interference:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Correlation studies were carried out in accordance with CLSI EP9-A2. 103 serum
patient samples spanning the range 0.123-12.46 mg/dL were tested by two operators,
10 of 103 samples were spiked. Two lots of direct bilirubin reagent were used on a
RX Daytona plus analyzer and a Siemens ADVIA 1650 system. The samples were
tested across 3 working days with each sample tested in singlicate. The test method
was compared to the predicate device and the following linear regression equation
was obtained. Both reagent lots yielded similar results. The results from one
representative lot are summarized below.
Linear Regression Equation y = 1.01x + 0.01
Correlation Coefficient r = 0.997
95% Confidence Interval of Slope 0.99 to 1.03
95% Confidence Intervals of Intercept -0.09 to 0.11
b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix method comparisons for the direct bilirubin assay was tested by one operator
on one RX Daytona plus system and was assessed for two lots of direct bilirubin
reagents. Both serum and lithium heparin plasma were tested to determine whether
method accuracy with lithium heparin specimens are equivalent to serum results.
A minimum of 40 matched serum and lithium heparin plasma samples that ranged 0.1
to 12.5 mg/dL was performed. The comparison was performed on the RX Daytona
plus system by one operator across two lots of reagents. Both reagent lots yielded
similar results. The resulting regression analysis of one representative lot is
summarized in the table below
Linear Regression Equation y = 0.99x + 0.01
Correlation Coefficient r = 1.00
