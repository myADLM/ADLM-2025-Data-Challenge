L. Test Principle:
The bilirubin is oxidized by vanadate at about pH 2.9 to produce biliverdin. In the presence
of detergent and vanadate, both conjugate (direct) and unconjugated bilirubin are oxidized.
This oxidation reaction causes a decrease in the optical density at 450/546 nm. The decrease
in optical density is specific to bilirubin and proportional to the total bilirubin concentration.
The biliverdin concentration is measured at endpoint of the oxidation reaction.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision estimates were derived according to CLSI EP05-A2.
Within run and total imprecision for total bilirubin were evaluated on the RX Daytona
Plus by testing pooled serum samples using two reagent lots. Each sample was
assayed two times per run, two runs per day for 20 days. Total number of replicates
for each sample was 80. Both reagent lots yielded similar results. The results from
one representative lot are summarized below.
Precision: Within-run Total
Specimen Concentration, SD CV% SD CV%
Type mg/dL
Serum 0.3 0.02 6.9 .02 7.4
Serum 1.1 0.05 4.0 0.06 5.4
Serum 6.7 0.11 1.6 0.16 2.4
Serum 12.0 0.12 1.0 0.28 2.3
Serum 16.2 0.15 0.9 0.35 2.2
Serum 25.0 0.23 0.9 0.41 2.2
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were carried out in accordance with CLSI EP06-A.
Linearity was evaluated using the RX Daytona Plus and 11 samples with
concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 26.3 mg/dL using two lots of reagents. The
samples were equally spaced in concentration and prepared by combining a pooled
high human serum sample and pooled low human serum sample (diluted to 0.2 mg/dl
with 0.9% saline). Each concentration level was run in replicates of five. Both
reagent lots yielded similar results. The results from one representative lot are
summarized below.
A linear regression fit between the expected concentration by dilution and observed
mean concentration was the same or better than a second or third order polynomial
fit. At each level, the mean observed concentration was within ± 5% of the expected
concentration (based on dilution).
The linear regression equation was: y = 1.02x + 0.01 and r = 0.9999.
The reportable range of the candidate device is 0.2 mg/dl to 26.3 mg/dL.

Automatic Dilution:
The Rx Daytona Plus analyser has an auto-dilution feature. When a total bilirubin
concentration exceeds the upper end of the reportable range of 26.3 mg/dl, the result
is flagged, and the sample is diluted with saline and re-run by the instrument. The
subsequent result is multiplied by the dilution factor.
A dilution study using a 1: 6 dilution ratio was performed against manual dilution,
and the results supported the sponsor’s claim that the instrument could automatically
dilute the sample.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The controls and calibrators to be used with this assay are manufactured by Randox
Laboratories. The Randox Calibration Serum Level 3 has previously been cleared
under k053153.
Randox Calibration Serum Level 3 is traceable to NIST SRM 916(a).
Stability:
Sponsor provided real time stability study protocol and acceptance criteria, and these
were found acceptable. The reagent has been evaluated for shelf-life and open on-
board stability. When stored un-opened at 2-8 ºC the assay reagent is stable until the
expiration date and has a shelf life of 24 months from the date of manufacture. When
stored on the RX Daytona Plus instrument, the open on-board stability is 28 days.
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit studies were carried out in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2.
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification (LoQ)
determinations were performed using two lots of reagents, tested by two operators, on
one RX Daytona Plus system.
The LoB was based on 60 replicates of an artificial serum matrix with no bilirubin
added. LoB was derived using the non-parametric approach, and where the value was
derived from the 95th percentile of all values.
The LoD was determined using four low level diluted serum sample pools in 20
replicates per run for each day across 3 days for a total of 60 measurements at each
level.
The LoQ was measured using four diluted patient serum sample pools in 12 replicates
6

--- Page 7 ---
across five days yielding a total of 60 results. The LoQ was determined by the lowest
total bilirubin concentration at which the imprecision < 20% CV.
Both reagent lots yielded similar results. The results from one representative lot (with
the highest values are summarized below.
LoB 0.06 mg/dL
LoD 0.075 mg/dL
LoQ 0.211 mg/dL
The total bilirubin assay has a claimed measuring range of 0.2 to 26.3 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were carried out in accordance with CLSI guideline EP7-A2.
The interference study was carried out using two concentration levels of 1.0 mg/dL
and 15 mg/dL total bilirubin. These were prepared by spiking unconjugated bilirubin
into pooled, stripped serum. The pooled samples were then aliquoted into 3 separate
samples; one sample with high level of interferent, one sample with normal level of
interferent, and sample was spiked with a diluent without the interferent as control.
All the samples were evaluated on the RX Daytona Plus. The samples were evaluated
in replicates of 10.
Sponsor defined no significant interference as a difference of <10% between the
measured concentration from spiked pool sample to the match sample with no
interferent (control).
The total bilirubin assay showed no significant interference with the following:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were carried out in accordance with CLSI guideline EP9-
A2.
The comparative method was the predicate device – Siemens ADVIA Total Bilirubin
2, tested on the Siemens ADVIA 1650 analyzer. For the candidate device, the testing
was conducted using the RX Daytona Plus analyzer. The method comparison used
106 samples spanning the concentration range from 0.2 to 26.9 mg/dL using 2 lots of
reagent. The samples were taken from banked collections and comprised 96 unaltered
patient serum samples and 10 spiked serum samples. All samples were run in
singlicate. The data was analyzed by linear least square regression. Both reagent lots
yielded similar results. The results from one representative lot are summarized below.
Linear regression equation y = 1.02x - 0.02
Correlation Coefficient 0.9999
95% Confidence Interval of Slope 1.01 to 1.02
95% Confidence Interval of Intercept -0.05 to 0.01
b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison for the Total Bilirubin assay was assessed for two lots of reagents
and using the RX Daytona Plus system.
Serum and lithium heparin plasma patient samples were drawn in matched pairs. 40
patient sample pairs were analyzed spanning the concentration range 0.2 to 23.5
mg/dL. The samples comprised 35 patient serum samples and 5 spiked serum
samples. Each sample was tested in singlicate.
Both lots of reagents yielded similar results. Linear regression analysis, from a
representative lot, yielded the following results:
Regression Equation y = 0.99x + 0.04
Correlation Coefficient 0.999
95% Confidence Interval of Slope 0.98 to 0.99
95% Confidence Interval of Intercept 0.01 to 0.07
Based on the study results, sponsor claimed that lithium heparin plasma sample is an
acceptable sample type for the candidate device.

Tests, 4th edition, Saunders Elsevier, St. Louis, MO: 2006:316.
The reference range for Total Bilirubin was verified using CLSI guideline C28-A3 by
conducting a small study using human serum samples from 30 healthy donors. These
were tested in singlicate on the RX Daytona Plus. Adults ranging in ages from 22 to 53
were tested. Of these, 19 were female and 11 male. The lowest result was 0.2 and
highest result was 1.1 mg/dL. A Dixon test was used to mathematically check for
outliers - none were found.
All results from the 30 healthy donors were found to be within the reported reference
range.
