SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
OIR Decision Summary
To: THE FILE RE: DOCUMENT NUMBER K152346
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own
Class II, Class III or Class I devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable
(delete/add items as necessary):
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device.
Trade Name: K150039 - MicroScan Dried Gram Positive MIC/Combo Panels - Vancomycin
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in
its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for
use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams, engineering
drawings, photographs, user’s and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the
FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.
This change was for a modification to the recommended incubation time for isolates of
Enterococcus species from 24 hours to 16 to 20 hours. The instructions in labeling of the previously
cleared device indicates an incubation time of 24 hours is necessary for detection or resistance in
isolates that have intermediate or susceptible MICs to vancomycin. This labeling change does not
affect the intended use. There were no modifications to the device.
______________________________________________________________.
4. Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to applicant’s legally marketed predicate
device including, labeling, intended use, physical characteristics, and evaluation of results obtained
during the clinical study for incubation times of 16 to 20 hours for Enterococcus species as compared
to results obtained after 24 hours of incubation.
5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the
device and its components, and the results of the analysis
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities
required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use
for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular
modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices
demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the
design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the
device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.

Beckman Coulter
Indication(s) for use:
The MicroScan® Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel is used to determine quantitative
and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid media of rapidly
growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-positive bacteria. After inoculation, panels are
incubated for 16 - 20 hours at 35ºC +/- 1ºC in a non-CO2 incubator, and read either visually or
with MicroScan instrumentation, according to the package insert.
This particular submission is for the addition of the reformulated antimicrobial Vancomycin at
concentration of 0.25 to 64 µg/ml to the test panel. The gram positive organisms which may be
used for Vancomycin susceptibility testing in this panel are:
Enterococcus spp (e.g., Enterococcus faecalis)
Staphylococci, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (including
heterogeneous methicillin-resistant strains)
Device Description:
The MicroScan Dried Gram Positive MIC/Combo Panel with vancomycin is used to determine
the quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid
media of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative gram-positive cocci. After inoculation panels are
incubated for 16-20 hours at 35°C ± 1°C in a non-CO2 incubator and read either visually or with
MicroScan instrumentation, according to the package insert “Accurate detection of resistance
requires an incubation time of 24 hours for Enterococci isolates with vancomycin.
Primary inoculation Method: Turbidity, Alternate Inoculation Method: Prompt™
Primary Read Method: Manual, Alternate Read Methods: MicroScan WalkAway System and
MicroScan autoSCAN-4

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility data for 5 isolates of Enterococcus species including one isolate of E.
casseliflavus, two isolates of E. faecalis and two isolates of E. faecium was provided.
Organism selection was based on the intended use of the antimicrobial agent. Each
isolate was tested at each site in triplicate over three days using 2 inoculation methods
(Turbidity and Prompt) and 3 reading methods (manual, WalkAway Instrument and
autoSCAN-4 Instrument).
The mode of the test panel MIC results was determined for each isolate. MIC results
were compared to the mode value for each isolate. Results were considered in
agreement if the test panel MIC was equal to or within ± 1 dilution of the mode for that
isolate. Agreement was calculated assuming any off-scale results were within one well
from the mode (best case) and by assuming any off-scale results were greater than one
well from the mode (worst case). Data were analyzed for all dilutions of Vancomycin
(0.25-64 µg/mL).
For all sites combined, agreement within 1 ± dilution from the mode for all inoculation
and reading methods was > 95% for best case and > 94.7% for worst case scenarios.
For isolates tested using the Prompt inoculation method and interpreted using the
WalkAway instrument, the mode MIC of one Enterococcus isolate was off scale.

2. Comparison studies:
Method comparison with predicate device:
This Special 510(k) application was submitted to demonstrate that MicroScan Dried Gram-Positive
MIC/Combo panels with reformulated vancomycin (Test panels) are substantially equivalent to
frozen CLSI reference panels (Reference panels) for the detection of resistant Enterococcus
species after 16 – 20 hours of incubation. Device performance was evaluated using 16 – 20 hour
incubation data that was also collected during the conduct of studies submitted to support the
clearance of the original predicate device (K150039) which were based on 24 hour incubation for
Enterococcus species.
Previously collected results from testing of a total of 40 Enterococcus spp. challenge isolates and
166 clinical isolates with the dried MicroScan panels incubated for 16 – 20 hours were evaluated.
The results obtained with the dried panels were compared to the reference method or expected
results.
Table 4 below demonstrates the performance for Enterococcus species based on essential
agreement and category agreement for the overall performance of the clinical and challenge
isolates. Data is shown for each inoculum preparation method (Turbidity and Prompt) and reading
method (Overnight Manual, Walk-Away, and autoScan4). The results were comparable to those
obtained at 24 hours with the reference method.
