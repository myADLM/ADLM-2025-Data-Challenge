510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number: K152353
B. Purpose for Submission: Clearance of New Device
C. Measurand: Herpes Simplex Virus-2 (HSV-2) type specific IgG antibodies to glycoprotein
G (gG) 2 antigen.
D. Type of Test: Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
E. Applicant: Quest International, Inc.
F. Proprietary and Established Names: SeraQuest HSV Type 2 Specific IgG
G. Regulatory Information:
1. Regulation section: 21 CFR§866.3305. Herpes simplex virus serological assays
2. Classification: Class II
3. Product code: MYF (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay, Herpes Simplex Virus,
HSV-2)
4. Panel: Microbiology (83)
H. Intended Use:
The SeraQuest HSV Type 2 Specific IgG assay is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) intended for the qualitative detection of human IgG antibodies to type 2 herpes
simplex virus (HSV) in human serum. The test is indicated for sexually active individuals
and expectant mothers as an aid in the presumptive diagnosis of HSV-2 infection. The
predictive value of a positive or negative result depends on the prevalence of HSV-2
infection in the population and the pre-test likelihood of HSV-2 infection.
The test is not FDA cleared for screening blood or plasma donors. The performance of this
assay has not been established for immunocompromised patients, pediatric patients or
matrices other than human serum.
I. Device Description:
The SeraQuest HSV Type 2 Specific IgG test is a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunoassay
(ELISA), which is performed in microwells, at room temperature, and in three thirty minute
incubations. The test detects IgG antibodies which are directed against HSV-2 antigen,in
human serum. The calibrators in the SeraQuest HSV Type 2 Specific IgG test set have been
assigned index values based on an in-house standard. Test results are reported as index
values. The following table shows the interpretation of results:
1

--- Page 2 ---
Index Result Interpretation
< 0.9 Negative No HSV-2 IgG antibodies detected. Patient is presumed not to
have had a previous HSV-2 infection.
0.9 < X < 1.0 Equivocal Obtain an additional sample for re-testing
> 1.0 Positive IgG antibody to HSV-2 detected.
Notes:
1. A single positive result only indicates previous immunologic exposure; the level of
antibody response may not be used to determine active infection or disease stage.
2. When equivocal results are obtained, another specimen should be obtained ten to fourteen
days later, and tested in parallel with the initial specimen. If the second specimen is also
equivocal, the patient is negative for primary or recent infection, and equivocal for
antibody status. If the second sample is positive, the patient can be considered to have
previous experience with HSV-2 infection.
3. Values obtained with different manufacturer's assay methods may not be used
interchangeably. The magnitude of the reported IgG index value cannot be correlated to
an endpoint titer. The magnitude of results above the cut-off is not an indicator of total
antibody present.

Herpes Simplex Virus Types 1 and 2 Serological Assays (issued August 9, 2011).
L. Test Principle:
Diluted patient serum samples are incubated in antigen-coated wells. HSV IgG Type 2
antibodies, if present in the patient sample, are immobilized in the wells by binding to the
antigen. Residual sample is eliminated by washing and draining, and conjugate is added and
incubated. If IgG antibodies to HSV Type 2 are present in the sample, the conjugate will be
immobilized in the wells. Residual conjugate is eliminated by washing and draining, and the
substrate is added and incubated. In the presence of the conjugate, the substrate is converted
to a yellow product which is read photometrically. Test results are obtained after one and one
half hours incubation time.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Six serum specimens (2 negative, 1 equivocal, and 3 positive) and the SeraQuest

Samples that were negative, weakly positive, and moderately positive for antibodies
to Type 2 HSV IgG were tested with and without the addition of elevated levels of
interfering substances well above physiological concentrations. No interference was
observed.
Cross-reactivity
A cross-reactivity study was performed to determine if samples from various disease
states and other potentially cross-reacting agents interfere with the test results. The
samples were determined to be positive for IgG antibodies directed against
taxonomically related viruses and other related pathogens by other legally marketed
devices. Human Papilloma Virus, Chlamydia trachomitis, and Neisseria gonorrhea
samples were from individual patients with confirmed sexually transmitted infections.
The samples were tested for Type 2 HSV antibody by another legally marketed
device. Only those samples that tested negative for Type 2 HSV antibody by the
legally marketed device were included in the study. The following table summarizes
the results:

f. Assay cut-off:
The SeraQuest HSV Type 2 Specific IgG test cut-off value was initially obtained
when 138 serum specimens shown to be negative by another commercial test were
assayed by the SeraQuest HSV Type 2 Specific IgG test. The cut-off value was
evaluated using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) Curve analysis using four
different hypothetical positive cut-off Index Values (0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2). The results of
the ROC curve are supportive of 1.0 as a cut-off value for separating reactive and
equivocal test results. The cut-off value was subsequently challenged using a panel of
100 masked and coded serum specimens, which had been well characterized by EIA
test and western blot.

Agreement with CDC Panel
The following information was obtained with the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) serum panel for HSV serology assays, which was tested in-house
by the SeraQuest HSV Type 2 Specific IgG test. The results are presented as a means
to convey further information on the performance of this assay with a masked, well
characterized serum panel. This does not imply an endorsement by the CDC.
The panel consists of 30 HSV-2 IgG positive and 70 HSV-2 IgG negative samples.
The SeraQuest HSV Type 2 Specific IgG test demonstrated 100% total agreement
with the CDC consensus results. The results of this study are shown in the following
table:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The performance of the SeraQuest HSV Type 2 Specific IgG test was assessed with
masked, archived, unselected sera from 164 sexually active adults and from 242
expectant mothers. The reference method was a commercial Immunoblot test. The
observed prevalence and the hypothetical predictive values for the two populations are
shown in the tables below. The positive predictive value will decrease proportionally
with the prevalence of HSV infection as shown below. The calculations were based on
the SeraQuest HSV Type 2 Specific IgG test having a sensitivity of 91.8% and a
specificity of 94.2% for the sexually active adults; and a sensitivity of 98.9% and a
specificity of 99.4% for the expectant mothers.
