b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using three test strip lots and twelve prepared venous blood
samples. Glucose concentrations of the samples, as determined by YSI reference
method, were 18, 48, 78, 137, 196, 255, 314, 373, 432, 492, 551 and 610 mg/dL. For
each glucose concentration, twelve replicates were tested for each lot of test strips.
The mean of values from the device were compared with those obtained from the YSI
reference method. The results from regression analysis are summarized below:
Lot 1: y = 1.02x - 0.90, R2 = 1.00
Lot 2: y = 1.00x + 0.94, R2 = 1.00
Lot 3: y = 1.01x - 0.05, R2 = 1.00
The results of the study support the claimed glucose measurement range of 20 mg/dL
to 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

d. Detection limit:
See linearity study in Section M.1.b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was performed using three venous whole blood samples (with
glucose concentrations 75, 120, 300 mg/dL) that were spiked with potentially
interfering endogenous and exogenous substances at high levels. Each sample was
measured on ten meters using three strip lots for a total of 30 replicates per sample.
The effect of the potential interferent was assessed by calculating the bias difference
in glucose readings between the test sample with high interferent concentration and
the control sample with no interferent. The sponsor claims no significant interference
(≤ 10% difference) for the substances and concentrations presented in the table

The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Altitude Study:
The effect of altitude on meter results was evaluated by testing three venous blood
samples with glucose concentrations of 50, 200 and 450 mg/dL at 10,000 feet above sea
level and at sea level. Results obtained on the subject device were compared to those
obtained with the YSI 2300 reference method. The results support the claim in the
labeling that altitude up to 10,000 feet do not significantly affect device performance.
2. Hematocrit Study:
The system was tested with venous whole blood samples at three glucose concentrations
(40, 125, and 350 mg/dL) and nine hematocrit levels (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55,
60%). Each sample was measured with ten meters and three test strip lots for a total of 30
replicates, and with the YSI 2300 reference method. Results from the study support the
claimed hematocrit range of 20 – 60%.
3. Temperature and Humidity Study:
Operating temperature and humidity studies were performed using venous whole blood
samples to evaluate temperatures ranging from 10 ºC to 40 ºC and relative humidity from
10% to 90%. Testing was conducted at target glucose concentrations of 50, 200, and 450
mg/dL. Meter results were compared to YSI reference analyzer. Five temperature and
humidity combinations were tested: low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high
humidity, high temperature/low humidity, high temperature/high humidity and medium
temperature/medium humidity (control condition). Each sample was tested with 30
replicates. Results obtained were compared to those obtained with the YSI 2300
reference method. The results support the claims in the labeling that the device can be
used in conditions of 50°F to 104°F (10°C to 40°C) with relative humidity of 10 to 90%.
4. Infection Control Studies:
The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy testing
was performed on the external Jazz™ Wireless 2 meter materials by an outside
commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus
(HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, PDI Super Sani-Cloth Germicidal Disposable Wipes
(EPA number 9480-4). Robustness testing was also performed by the sponsor
demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of the meter
after 260 cleaning and 260 disinfection cycles, for a total of 520 wipes (260 cleaning
wipes plus 260 disinfecting wipes), designed to simulate 5 years of use. Labeling was
reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
5. Sample Volume Study:
A sample volume study was performed to verify the claimed minimum sample volume
requirement. One lot of test strips was tested at three glucose intervals, using ten blood
12

glucose meters. Blood samples at glucose levels 50-65, 100-120, and 200-250 mg/dL
were tested on the meter and compared to YSI values at five sample volumes of 1.0, 0.6,
0.5, 0.4 and 0.3μL. Protocols and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be
acceptable. The results support the claimed minimal sample volume of 0.5μL.
6. Readability Assessment:
The Flesch-Kincaid Grade level assessment was conducted on the Owner's Guide, Meter
Pairing & Syncing Guide, and Test Strip Insert. No readability assessment was above
grade level 8.
7. EMC Testing:
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing
(EMC) had been performed and that the System was found compliant.
