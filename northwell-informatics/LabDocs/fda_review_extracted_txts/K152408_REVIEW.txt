Direct assay is intended for
use on the 3M Integrated
Cycler instrument for the in
vitro qualitative detection and
differentiation of influenza A
virus, influenza B virus, and
respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV) RNA in
nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS)
from human patients with
signs and symptoms of
respiratory tract infection in
conjunction with clinical and
epidemiological risk factors.
This test is intended for use
as an aid in the differential
diagnosis of influenza A,
influenza B, and RSV viral
infections in humans and is
not intended to detect
influenza C.
Negative results do not
preclude influenza virus or
RSV infection and should not
be used as the sole basis for
treatment or other patient
management decisions.
Performance characteristics
for influenza A were
established with clinical
specimens collected during
the 2010/2011 influenza
season when 2009 H1N1
influenza and H3N2 were the
predominant influenza A
viruses in circulation. When
other influenza A viruses are
emerging, performance
characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel
Influenza A virus is suspected
based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening
criteria recommended by
public health authorities,
specimens should be
collected with appropriate
infection control precautions

not be attempted in these
cases unless a BSL 3+

Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV
Control Pack
Focus Diagnostics’
Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV
Positive Control Pack is
intended to be used as a
control with the Simplexa™
Flu A/B & RSV Direct kit. This
control is not intended for use
with other assays or systems.
Technology The Simplexa™ Flu A/B & Same
RSV Direct assay system is a
real-time RT-PCR system
that enables the direct
amplification, detection and
differentiation of human
influenza A (Flu A) virus
RNA, human influenza B (Flu
B) virus RNA and RSV RNA
from unprocessed
nasopharyngeal swabs that
have not undergone nucleic
acid extraction. The system
consists of the Simplexa™
Flu A/B & RSV Direct assay,
the 3M Integrated Cycler
(with Integrated Cycler Studio
Software), the Direct
Amplification Disc and
associated accessories.
In the Simplexa™ Flu A/B &
RSV Direct assay, bi
functional fluorescent probe-
primers are used together
with corresponding reverse
primers to amplify Flu A, Flu
B, RSV and internal control
RNA. The assay provides
three results; conserved
regions of influenza A viruses

Differences:
1) The package insert for the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct Assay has been updated to include
detection of 37 influenza A strains, 9 influenza B strains, and 7 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
strains to the Analytical Reactivity/Cross-Reactivity Section.
2) The following wording was changed in the Warnings and Precautions Section of the Simplexa™
Flu A/B & RSV Direct Assay package insert:
“Contamination of patient specimens or reagents can produce erroneous results. Use
aseptic techniques.”
The new language is as follows:
“Treat all specimens and discs as capable of transmitting infectious agents. Contamination
of patient specimens or reagents can produce erroneous results. Use good laboratory
practices and control workflow.7,8”
3) The words “Rx Only” were moved from the Limitations Section to the front page of the of the
Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct Assay package insert.
4) The word “reaction mix” was changed to “Reaction Mix” throughout the Simplexa™ Flu A/B &
RSV Direct Assay package insert.
6. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
1) Cross-reactivity testing was conducted as described in Section 3, Device Modifications.
2) Risk Analysis
The method used for the Risk Analysis for the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct Assay was the
Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA). This method is consistent with 21 CFR 820.30. The following
table summarizes the risk analysis:

The risk of a false negative result was identified as a potential hazard that could occur if target viral
sequences contained genetic mismatches with the primers and scorpion probes. This risk was
addressed by conducting cross-reactivity testing on an additional 53 viral strains with the Simplexa™ Flu
A/B & RSV Direct Assay and through updating the package insert (PI).
3) Declaration of Conformity to Design Controls
A “Declaration of Conformity” statement was submitted for the Focus Diagnostics manufacturing
facility. It was signed by the Senior Project Manager, an R&D Scientist, and the R&D Technical
Director. The statements indicate that:
3a) “All development activities for the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV REF MOL2650 expanded
claims for the addition of the following analytical reactivity strains have been completed,
including risk analysis, verification and validation. Activities were performed by designated
individuals and the results demonstrated that the pre-determined acceptance criteria were
met.” Viral strains tested were listed in the Declaration of Conformity (see Section 3 for a
complete list).
3b) “The Focus Diagnostics manufacturing facility is in conformance with the Design Control
Procedure requirement as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are available for
review.”
In conclusion, based on the Risk Analysis and the results of the analytical cross-reactivity testing, the
modified labeling is truthful and accurate. The changes do not affect the performance of the Simplexa™
Flu A/B & RSV Direct Assay and, therefore, it is substantially equivalent to the currently cleared test.
7. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary, and the Indications for
Use Enclosure.
The labeling for the modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended
use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the
particular modification and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified device
demonstrates that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. On this basis, I
recommend that the device is determined to be substantially equivalent to the previously cleared
device.
