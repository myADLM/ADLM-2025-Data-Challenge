CLSI EP28-A3: Defining, Establishing, and Verifying Reference Intervals in the Clinical
Laboratory
L. Test Principle:
The FREND™ Free T4 Test utilizes microfluidic technology and detects immune complexes
bound to FT4. A 70 μl sample is first incubated during Step 1 in the FT4 Gold AB Tube
with monoclonal (mouse) anti-T4 antibody conjugated with gold micro-particles. In Step 2,
35μL of the mixture from Step 1 is manually loaded into the inlet of the cartridge, where it
hydrates a T4-BSA fluorescent bead conjugate and migrates along the test strip. During
migration the bound FT4 in the sample and the fluorescent bead conjugates of T4-BSA
compete to form antigen antibody complex in the test zone. Unbound T4-BSA fluorescent
conjugates flow through and bind to the anti-T4 antibody that is fixed on the surface in the
reference zone.
FT4 quantification is based upon the ratio of the intensity of the test and reference zones.
A lower ratio of fluorescence is indicative of a higher FT4 concentration, in other words,
the magnitude of the fluorescent ratio is inversely proportional to the amount of FT4 in
the sample.
There is no calibration by the user because each cartridge is coded with the calibration
information generated by the manufacturer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed a precision study for the FRENDTM Free T4 Test System
according to the CLSI EP05-A3. Three serum pools with low (0.917ng/dL),
intermediate (1.850 ng/dL), and high (3.979 ng/dL) FT4 levels were assayed in
duplicate twice per day for 20 days (80 total measurements) on a single lot of reagent
cartridge on a single analyzer. The precision data for the FRENDTM Free T4 Test are
summarized below:
Sample Mean Repeatability Between-run Between day Within-Laboratory
Pool ng/dL SD %CV SD %CV SD %CV SD %CV
1 0.917 0.067 7.3 0.000 0.0 0.032 3.5 0.074 8.1
2 1.850 0.103 5.6 0.000 0.0 0.069 3.7 0.124 6.7
3 3.979 0.186 4.7 0.152 3.8 0.093 2.3 0.258 6.5
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To demonstrate the linearity of the assay, a study design was used based on CLSI
4

CLSI-EP6-A. A serum base pool with an elevated FT4 (7.5 ng/dL) was prepared and
diluted to a total of 11 levels. The range of samples tested was 0.11 – 7.50 ng/dL. At
each dilution level, the samples were tested in duplicate to determine the
experimental value of FT4. The data was analyzed using least square linear
regression. The quadratic terms of the second and third order polynomial fit were
statistically insignificant (p value <0.001). Linear regression equation generated was
y = 0.978x – 0.0881; r2 = 0.9938.
Linearity data support the sponsor’s claimed measuring range from 0.4– 6.0 ng/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The standards/calibrators are internally prepared according to the guideline of CLSI
C45-A Measurement of Free Thyroid Hormones; Approved Guideline – first Edition.
This internal standard is manufactured by gravimetric methods based on the L-
Thyroxine (from commercial source). At each concentration level, the Free T4 levels
of calibrators are confirmed by measurement on ARCHITECT i free T4 assay
(K123379).
There is no need for calibration by the operator as the calibration information is coded
in the individual cartridge.
The sponsor recommends a minimum of two (2) levels of commercially available
controls be run at least once per month or once for each new lot, whichever comes
earlier. Each laboratory must follow the standardized procedures acceptable to the
regulatory agencies to whom the laboratory is responsible.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation
(LoQ) for the FREND™ Free T4 assay was determined in accordance with the CLSI
EP17-A2.
LoB Protocol
LoB was determined with five different blank samples (<0.1 ng/dL). Each sample
was assayed 12 times over a period of five days using a single reagent lot (n= 60
measurements). The LOB was calculated from N = 60 (4 measurements X 5 blank
samples X 3 days = 60), using a parametric analysis for a Gaussian distribution of the
blank values, as described in CLSI EP-17A.
LoD Protocol
LoD was determined using five low level samples (0.3 - 0.45). Each sample was
assayed in 4 replicates for three days using a single lot of reagent (n = 120
measurements). LoD was reported the lowest level material where the beta-percentile
was 5%.
5

--- Page 6 ---
LoQ Protocol
The LoQ was determined by performing a functional sensitivity study. Seven levels
of a low sample (0.0 – 0.9 ng/dL) were assayed using three lots of reagent for four
days. The lowest FT4 concentration giving an imprecision within 20%CV was
determined to be the LoQ value.
The detection limits studies results are summarized in the table below:
LoB 0.171 ng/dL
LoD 0.320 ng/dL
LoQ 0.360 ng/dL
The claimed measuring range of the candidate device is 0.4 to 6.0 ng/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed studies to evaluate the effect of potential interferents on the
performance of the FREND™ Free T4 assay, following the CLSI EP07-A2 guideline.
Two levels of serum samples containing approximately 1.0 ng/dL and 2.5 ng/dL of
FT4 were spiked with different concentrations of the potential interferents. Each
level of FT4 was tested with each interferent in 3 replicates. The sponsor defined
non-significant interference as recovery from 90% to 110% of the expected Free T4
concentration. The table below lists the substances tested and the concentration at
which no significant interference was observed:

The sponsor stated the following limitations in the package insert:
• Specimens from patients with heterophilic antibodies, such as anti-mouse (HAMA), anti-
goat (HAGA), or, anti-rabbit (HARA) antibodies, may show falsely elevated or
depressed values or may result in the error message “Incomplete Test.” Patients
routinely exposed to animals or animal serum products can be prone to these types
of heterophilic interferences. If the FT4 level is inconsistent with clinical
evidence, additional FT4 or other thyroid testing using a different method is
suggested to confirm the results. Certain medications may interfere with assay
performance. All results should be interpreted with respect to the clinical picture
of the patient.
• Although hemolysis has an insignificant effect on the assay, hemolyzed samples
may indicate mistreatment of a specimen prior to assay and results should be
interpreted with caution.
• Lipemia has an insignificant effect on the assay except in the case of gross
lipemia where interference with the lateral flow of the sample in the cartridge may
occur.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor performed a method comparison study on the NanoEnTek FRENDTM
FreeT4 assay and the predicate device (Abbott Architect Free T4 assay) using 358
natural serum specimens with the approximate measuring range (0.43 - 5.99 ng/dL).
The testing was performed by three operators at a single hospital clinical laboratory.
The regression results of the Ordinary least square fit method are summarized below:
Analyte n Range (ng/dL) Slope (95% CI) Intercept (95% CI) r
FT4 358 0.43 – 5.99 1.010 0.057 0.986
(0.992-1.028) (0.021-0.094)
b. Matrix comparison:
The matrix comparison study was performed using 48 sample pairs, each with serum
and lithium heparin plasma. All samples were measured using the FREND™ Free T4
assay. Passing-Bablok regression analysis of serum results (x) compared to lithium
heparin plasma results (y) was performed. The results are summarized in the table
below:
Slope: 1.017 (95% Cl: 0.991-1.044) y-Intercept: -0.008 (95% Cl: -0.055-0.0451)
n = 48 Sample range tested: 0.44-5.63 ng/dL
r2 0.9948
The results from the matrix comparison study support the sponsor claim that lithium
heparin samples are acceptable for this assay.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
To determine the reference range for the FRENDTM FreeT4 assay, a total of 196
apparently healthy ambulatory adults aged 21 years and older were utilized. All samples
were assayed on the FREND™ FT4 to establish the reference range interval according to
CLSI EP28-A3. The reference interval for the FRENDTM FreeT4 Test System was found
to be 0.83 – 1.60 ng/dL based on the central 95% of the frequency distribution.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
