L. Test Principle:
Upon contacting saliva cells, the stabilizing liquid lyses cellular and nuclear
membranes to release and stabilize nucleic acids (DNA). Samples can be immediately
processed, transported or stored for future use. Samples can be shipped or transported
at ambient temperature to the laboratory for processing. ORAcollect·Dx samples are
stable at room temperature for up to 60 days. Device and sample integrity are
preserved during typical ambient transport and storage conditions. DNA extraction
from ORAcollect·Dx saliva samples should be performed using the QIAGEN
QIAamp DNA Mini Kit.

M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three reproducibility studies were conducted.
The first reproducibility study was designed to show collection-to-collection,
lot-to-lot and day-to-day reproducibility. Ten donors self-collected nine saliva
samples each over 3 days using 3 reagent lots (OCD-100 format). The 10
donors had never used the product previously. One operator performed the
DNA extraction (from one aliquot of each sample on each of two days)
followed by testing for concentration, yield and A /A ratio. DNA testing
260 280
using the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Test was performed over several days.
A total of 120 aliquots from the 60 self-collected samples from the 10 donors
were tested.
All specimens yielded a DNA concentration of 2 ng/µL or better, DNA purity
(A /A ) between 1.2 and 2.3 and total DNA yield of at least 10 ng (0.010
260 280
µg).
After the first round of testing, total percent agreement between the results of
the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test and genotype (by sequencing)
was 100%.
A second reproducibility study was performed to evaluate operator-to-
operator reproducibility. For this study, 3 of the samples collected by the ten
donors for the first study were pooled and aliquoted into 3 tubes (and one
reserve aliquot was stored). Each of 3 operators performed the DNA
extraction (from one aliquot of each sample that they received on each of two
days) followed by testing for concentration, yield and A /A ratio prior to
260 280
testing each aliquot from each sample received on the eSensor® Warfarin
Sensitivity Test. One lot of the collection device was used for this study. A
total of 60 aliquots from 30 self-collected samples from 10 donors were
tested.
All specimens yielded a DNA concentration of 2 ng/µL or better, DNA purity
(A /A ) between 1.2 and 2.3 and total DNA yield of at least 10 ng (0.010
260 280
µg).
After the first round of testing, total percent agreement between the results of
the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test and genotype (by sequencing)
was 100%.
A third reproducibility study was conducted. Thirty (30) donors collected
multiple saliva samples each from 3 sites; 2 of the 3 sites were in a
professional setting and had supervised collections compared to unsupervised
collections at the third site. The 30 donors were selected to encompass a
diverse genotype distribution for CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype
distribution. After sample collection, one sample from each donor was
transported at ambient temperatures to three independent sites. Each site had
4

--- Page 5 ---
one operator for a study total of 3 operators. Following sample extraction, all
purified genomic DNA samples were tested for DNA concentration and
A260/A280 at the sites where they were extracted. All purified genomic DNA
samples were transported to Site 1 for testing on the eSensor Warfarin
Sensitivity Saliva Test (k152612) where 1 extracted DNA aliquot from each
sample from each site was tested on the Warfarin assay, excluding a single
sample that did not meet assay input criteria. When data from all 3 sites are
combined one sample did not meet the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva
Test DNA quality input requirements. In the first run there were 88/89
(98.9%) correct calls on the 89 testable samples of 90 total collected samples.
In the second run there was 100% agreement (89/89) with bidirectional
sequencing on the 89 testable samples of 90 total collected samples.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Shelf-life stability:
Stability testing protocols and simulated transport shelf-life studies were
reviewed and found to be acceptable.
Current real-time data supports a shelf-life 24 months at ambient temperature.
Stability of samples post-saliva collection: A study was performed to evaluate
the stability of samples after saliva collection. Two samples were collected
from each of 30 donors (using 3 lots of the OCD-100 format). One was
exposed to simulated transport conditions (3 freeze-thaw cycles, where each
cycle was comprised of a minimum of 3 hours at -20°C and a minimum of 3
hours at 50°C). The second was stored at room temperature and processed
after 30 days and 70 days of storage. At each time point, an aliquot of sample
was extracted and the DNA was analyzed for concentration, yield and
A /A ratio and percent bacterial content.
260 280
All specimens from all samples at all conditions (baseline, simulated
transport, 30 days and 70 days) yielded a DNA concentration of 2 ng/µL or
better, DNA purity (A /A ) between 1.2 and 2.3 and total DNA yield of at
260 280
least 10 ng (0.010 µg). There was also no significant difference from baseline
in the bacterial content in the samples.
A subset of 10 donors was selected and all samples (baseline, transport, 30
days and 70 days) from those donors tested for agreement between genotyping
results on the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test and sequencing. There
was 100% agreement (40/40) of the eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Test
results to bidirectional sequencing.

d. Detection limit: ‐
The device is intended for the collection of a saliva sample by using the
double ended tube cap with attached integrated sponge to collect and transfer
saliva samples. The sample is collected using 10 sponge actions per each of
the lower gum one each side of the mouth for a total of 20 sponge actions
total. A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of over or under collecting
a sample using the OCD-100 collection device.
Individuals collected a sample by one of the following methods:
“recommended” (10 sponge actions per each lower gums one each side of the
mouth for a total of 20 sponge actions total); “over-collection” (10 sponge
actions per each upper and lower gums on each side of the mouth for a total of
40 sponge actions total); “Under-collection by 50%” (5 sponge actions per
each lower gums for a total of 10 sponge actions total); “Under-collection by
75%” (5 sponge actions on a single lower gum for a total of 5 sponge actions
total); and “no motion” (sponge placed in lower gutter region for 10 seconds
for each side of the mouth).
A total of 10 donors were asked to collect 5 saliva samples using the different
collection methods. A total of 50 DNA samples were analyzed for DNA
concentration, yield and A /A ratio. In addition, 49 samples were
260 280
processed on the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Test.
All specimens from the “recommended,” “over-collection,” and “under-
collection” methods collected samples with sufficient DNA purity and yield.
For the “no motion” group, only 90% of samples had sufficient DNA purity
and yield. In addition, one sample (10%) from the “no motion” group did not
collect a sufficient concentration of DNA.
DNA testing resulted in 4 no calls (45/49 or 91% agreement between
genotyping results on the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test and
sequencing). Upon retesting there was 100% agreement of the eSensor®
Warfarin Sensitivity Test results to bidirectional sequencing. One sample from
the no motion group did not meet the concentration criteria and was not able

Effect of Incorrect Collection sites: The sample is collected using 10 sponge
actions per each of the lower gum one each side of the mouth for a total of 20
sponge actions total. A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of
collecting from incorrect collection sites using the OCD-100 collection
device.
Individuals collected a sample by one of the following methods:
“recommended” (10 sponge actions per each lower gums one each side of the
mouth for a total of 20 sponge actions total); “cheek” (10 sponge actions per
inside of cheek on each side of the mouth); “teeth” (10 sponge actions per
each lower teeth on each side of the mouth); and “tongue” (10 sponge actions
per each side of the top of the tongue).
A total of 10 donors were asked to collect 4 saliva samples using the different
collection sites. A total of 40 DNA samples were analyzed for DNA
concentration, yield and A /A ratio. In addition, 39 samples were
260 280
processed on the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Test.
All specimens from the “recommended” collection site, collected from the
“teeth” and the “tongue” had adequate DNA purity and yield. For the samples
collected from the “cheek”, 90% of samples had adequate DNA purity and
yield. In addition, one sample (10%) from the “cheek” group did not collect a
sufficient concentration of DNA.
DNA testing resulted in 100% agreement (39/39) between genotyping results
on the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test and sequencing. One sample
collected from the cheek did not meet the concentration criteria was not able
to be tested on the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test.

Dry Mouth Study: 13 donors with dry mouth were recruited to participate in
the study (based on answers to the modified Xerostomia Inventory which is
used to evaluate dry mouth. The sponsor used at least 3 “yes” responses to the
questions to select participants, and recruited participants with the most yes
responses).
11 of 12 specimens had adequate DNA purity and yield.
DNA testing resulted in 2 no-calls (84.6% agreement - 11/13) between
genotyping results on the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test and
sequencing. Upon retesting there was 100% agreement of the eSensor
Warfarin Sensitivity Test results to bidirectional sequencing.
e. Analytical specificity:
Effect of Endogenous Interfering Substances: Interfering substances were
spiked into saliva samples. 10 donors each provided five samples which were
each spiked with one of the four interfering substances. A control sample was
included. All samples were evaluated for effect on DNA concentration,
purity, A /A ratio and testing on a genotyping device.
260 280
Three independent DNA extractions were performed on each spiked sample
while one DNA extraction was performed for the control samples. No
endogenous substances tested exhibited interference with the assay.

Effect of Exogenous Interfering Substances: Potentially interfering exogenous
substances introduced into saliva samples through various activities (eating,
drinking, chewing gum, using mouthwash, smoking and brushing teeth) were
tested. Each activity group was composed of five to nine donors who each
provided samples immediately after activity, 10 minutes and 30 minutes post-
activity. There was 100% agreement between the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity
Saliva Test results and bidirectional DNA sequencing for all activities tested
in one run at the 30 minute time point, demonstrating no effect of any
interfering substances on genotyping.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed in order to determine the accuracy
of the genotype obtained on the eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test
(k110786) using saliva samples collected using the proposed collection device
(3 lots of OCD-100) as compared to bi-directional DNA sequencing. Samples
from 156 subjects were collected. Eighty percent of donors were naïve to the
device. Twenty percent had used the device more than once.
All samples yielded a DNA concentration of 2 ng/µL or better, DNA purity
(A /A ) between 1.2 and 2.3 and total DNA yield of at least 10 ng (0.010
260 280
µg).
Overall, there was 98.1% (153/156) first agreement of the eSensor
Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test to bidirectional sequencing. In the first run
there were 2 incorrect results and one no -rcuanll result. After re testing, there was
99.4% (155/156) agreement between the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva
Test results and DNA sequencing, including one no-call resu‐lt.

No call result: There was one first and final run no call, sample MC002. This
sample was re tested using the same purified DNA (retest 1) and upon a
second no call result, was re extracted and re tested‐ on the eSensor Warfarin
Sensitivity Sal‐iva Test (retest 2). The original test, retest 1 and retest 2 all
gave a no‐call result (all *3 i‐ndeterminant sco‐re). For investigation purposes,
both the original and re extracted DNA was diluted 1:10 and re tested on the
eSensor W‐arfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test. Both the 1:10 diluted samples gave
a correct call of *1/*3, G‐ /G, concordant with sequencing. The s‐ponsor
hypothesizes that there may be an inhibitor present in the sample that was not
removed by the Qiagen QIAmp Mini Kit purification. Users should be aware
of this potential failure mode.
Incorrect results: There were two first incorrect calls (CYP2C9 *2/*2,
VKORC1 G/G and CYP2C9 *1/*2, VKORC1 G/A). An investigation
revealed that a sample mix up had occ urrurend. Both samples were re tested on
the and re test 1 resulted in genotypes concordant with sequencing for both
samples. ‐ ‐

b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor conducted a method comparison study between the two tube
types, OCD-100 and OCD-100A. The collection of samples from 45 different
donors was evaluated for DNA concentration, total DNA yield, A260/A280
and the warfarin sensitivity assay. All 45 samples collected had adequate
DNA concentratoin, total DNA and A260/A280. Samples from the OCD-
100A generated correct results on the warfarin sensitivity genotyping assay
(95.6% in the first pass due to 2 no-call results, and 100% in the final pass).
