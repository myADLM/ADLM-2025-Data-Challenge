H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Great Basin Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel is a qualitative, multiplex, nucleic
acid-based in vitro diagnostic assay intended for the simultaneous identification of
nucleic acid from Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis and various
Staphylococcus species to the genus level and the detection of the mecA gene for
methicillin resistance directly from patient positive blood culture specimens. The
test utilizes automated hot-start enabled polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the
amplification of specific DNA targets detected by hybridization probes
immobilized on a silicon chip surface. The assay is performed directly on positive
blood culture specimens identified as positive by continuous monitoring blood
culture system that demonstrates the presence of organisms as determined by Gram
stain to contain gram-positive cocci in clusters (GPCC) or gram-positive cocci in
singles (GPC). The test may be performed using blood culture bottles. The Staph
ID/R Blood Culture Panel identifies Staphylococcus aureus (SA), and
Staphylococcus lugdunensis, and detects other Staphylococcus species without
identification to species level.
The Portrait Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel is indicated for use in conjunction
with other clinical or laboratory findings to aid in the diagnosis of bacterial
bloodstream infections; however, it is not used to monitor these infections. Sub-
culturing positive blood cultures is necessary to recover viable organisms for
further identification, susceptibility testing, or epidemiological typing to identify
organisms in the blood culture that are not detected by the Great Basin Staph ID/R
Blood Culture Panel. If detected, mecA may or may not be associated with
Staphylococcus spp. detected or the agent responsible for the disease. Negative
results for mecA antimicrobial resistance gene assays do not always indicate
susceptibility, as other mechanisms of resistance to methicillin exist.

I. Device Description:
The Great Basin Staph ID/R Blood Panel on the PA500 Portrait™ Analyzer System
utilizes automated hot-start enabled polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification
technology to amplify specific nucleic acid sequences that are detected using species
specific Staphylococcal DNA hybridization probes immobilized on a modified silicon
chip surface.
Target genomic DNA is extracted from microbial cells and diluted to reduce potential
inhibitors of the PCR reaction. During the PCR process, double-stranded DNA is
separated and target nucleic acid sequences are amplified by thermal cycling. Biotin-
labeled primers direct amplification of specific nucleic acid sequences within a variable
region of the tuf gene for identification of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species,
within a conserved region of the thermonuclease (nuc) gene for specific identification
of Staphylococcus aureus, and the mecA gene for detecting oxacillin/methicillin
resistance. Following the PCR process, biotin-labeled, amplified target DNA sequences
are hybridized to an array of probes immobilized on the silicon chip surface, then
incubated with anti-biotin antibody conjugated to the horseradish peroxidase enzyme
(HRP). The unbound conjugate is removed by washing and tetramethylbenzidine
(TMB) is added to produce a colored precipitate at the location of the probe/target
sequence complex. The resulting signal is detected by the automated Portrait Optical
Reader within the Portrait System.
The single-use test cartridge contains blister packs, fluidic channels, processing
chambers, and the assay chip coated with an array of sequence-specific detection
probes. All reagents are contained within the integrated blister packs with the exception
of the amplification enzymes that are lyophilized and placed into the Amplification
Chamber. A positive blood culture specimen is placed into a sample port of the test
cartridge for processing. Multiple fluidic channels move reagents from integrated
blister packs to chambers where reagent mixing and sample processing occur. A waste
chamber, self-contained and segregated within the test cartridge, collects and stores
reagent waste.
The Great Basin PA500 Portrait Analyzer System is a fully automated system that
3

automated hot-start enabled polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification technology to
amplify specific nucleic acid sequences that are detected using species specific
Staphylococcal DNA hybridization probes immobilized on a modified silicon chip surface.
Target genomic DNA is extracted from microbial cells and diluted to reduce potential

direct amplification of specific nucleic acid sequences within a variable region of the tuf gene

The limit of detection (LoD) of the Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel to Staphylococcus
with or without mecA was assessed and confirmed with 22 different strains. For these
studies, overnight incubations of each bacterial stock in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) were
measured by optical density to estimate the inoculum, serially diluted and spiked into a
BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F blood bottle containing negative blood. Spiked bottles were
incubated until alarm positivity in a BACTEC Blood Culture System. Alarm positive
blood cultures were gram stained, diluted, plated on agar plates and colonies were
counted the following day. The enumerated blood culture bottles were diluted to a
1x105-106 targeted sample input CFU/mL range in BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F media
containing negative blood, tested on device and plated on agar plates to enumerate the
actual sample input CFU/mL. The estimations of the sample input CFU/mL were
revised to reflect the correct CFU/mL by this colony counting method.
The initial serial dilutions and testing for three strains were used to estimate the ideal
range to test for all 22 strains. Correct results were determined by the call reported vs
expected, e.g. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC strain BAA-1682 with mecA present was
correct if detected in a ‘Positive, Staphylococcus aureus, mecA Present” call. The
results for the initial testing are summarized in the table below.

In order to confirm an estimated LoD based on colony counting, an additional
minimum of 20 replicates were tested for S. aureus BAA-1682, S. epidermidis 700562,
and S. lugdunensis 49576 based on the results from on the initial sensitivity study. The
20 replicates initially tested for the three strains resulted in less than 19/20 correct calls,
and were subsequently retested at a half-log increased concentration, and resulted in
100% correct calls. These experiments identified a target sample input range of 1x105-
106 CFU/mL for future LoD studies. A minimum of 19/20 valid runs was required to
identify the LoD for each strain tested.
The LoDs for 6 S. aureus strains ± mecA are reported as 3.5-8.2x105 CFU/mL; the LoD
for each S. aureus strain is listed in below.

were combined with BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F media containing negative blood
previously incubated 24 hours in a BACTEC Blood Culture System without alarm
positivity. The Staphylococcus cultures were diluted to a sample input target range of
approximately 2-3X LoD (1-2.5x106 CFU/mL) determined by the Staphylococcus
strain LoD studies. The CFU concentrations for each strain were estimated by optical
density measurements and then confirmed by colony counting. This method led to some
strains being tested at 4-7X LOD (2.5-7x106 CFU/mL).
The Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel correctly detected all of the additional
Staphylococcus strains, mecA present or absent with a sample input range of 3.2x105 to
6.7x106 CFU/mL listed in the table below.

All strains showed expected oxacillin MIC results, including the BORSA strains, which
showed a range of oxacillin resistance (0.25-2 µg/mL) as expected for strains resistant
by alternative mechanisms other than mecA. In addition, all empty cassette strains,
which lack mecA, were sensitive to oxacillin (0.5-0.25 µg/mL). Samples were correctly
detected as mecA Present or Absent in the Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel. The Staph
ID/R did not detect mecA for mecC strain BAA-2313, empty cassette and BORSA
strains as expected.
c. Analytical Specificity (Exclusivity):
Studies were performed to assess the potential cross-reactivity of the Staph ID/R Blood
Culture Panel with 116 off-panel microflora (bacterial, yeast and mollicute strains).
BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F or Anaerobic/F media (for anaerobic strains) containing
negative blood were inoculated with isolates and incubated in a BACTEC Blood
Culture System until alarm positivity. Alarm positive samples were incubated for
additional time in the Blood Culture System consistent with specimen stability studies
to obtain a target microorganism bottle load ≥108 CFU/mL. The positive alarm bottles
were Gram stained, diluted, plated and counted to confirm all organisms were tested at
1x108 CFU/mL or higher. Alarm positive blood cultures were not obtained for a subset
of organisms. For 2 organisms, alarm positive bottles samples were substituted with
genomic DNA at a final concentration of ≥108 copies/mL. Genomic DNA was spiked
into a matrix of negative blood and BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F media.
A minimum of 2 replicates was tested in the Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel for each
of the bacterial and fungal strains evaluated and these data are summarized in the table
below.

inclusivity studies, the Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel was further evaluated for the
ability to detect low level Staphylococcus species in the presence of 14 “off-panel”
microorganism strains that should not be detected. The “off-panel” strains represent Gram
Positive, Gram Negative, Yeast and likely skin contaminants. BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F or
Anaerobic/F Bottles containing blood were inoculated with competing “off-panel”
microorganisms. The “off-panel” strains were grown to high concentrations by incubating
8 hours past bottle ring ‘On-board’, consistent with incubation time and temperatures
tested in the specimen stability. The bottle contents were confirmed by Gram stain and
serial dilutions plated on agar and counted the following day to confirm a concentration of
>108 CFU/mL. Bottles were stored at 4°C and tested within 72 hours in combination with
Staphylococcus TSB cultures at approximately 1-2.5x106 CFU/mL for each strain. The
concentration of the Staphylococcus strains were verified by plating serial dilutions on
agar and performing colony counts the following day.
For the ‘valid’ runs tested, the potentially interfering ‘off-panel’ microorganisms did not
interfere with the detection of the Staphylococcus strains, resulting in ‘POSITIVE’ calls as
expected. In some cases, a miscall was observed, and the low-target Staphylococcus
strains were re-tested at a higher concentration and resulted in a positive result as
expected. The re-tested concentrations are included in the table and were within the 2-3X
LoD range for each species. Results are shown in the table below:

Staphylococcus Microbial Interference: 12 Staphylococcus species expected to be co-
detected with the low level Staphylococcus species. BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F bottles
containing blood were inoculated with Staphylococcus isolates. The bacteria were grown
to high concentrations by incubating 8 hours past bottle ring ‘On-board’, consistent with
incubation time and temperatures tested in the specimen stability study. The bottle
contents were confirmed by Gram stain and serial dilutions plated on agar and counted the
following day to confirm a concentration of >108 CFU/mL for competing Staphylococcus
strains. Bottles were stored at 4°C and tested within 72 hours in combination with
Staphylococcus TSB cultures at approximately 1-2.5x106 CFU/mL for each strain. The
concentration of the Staphylococcus strains were verified by plating serial dilutions on
agar and performing colony counts the following day.
The studies assessed the detection of 5 ATCC Staphylococcus test strains: S. aureus
(mecA+) BAA-1682 (0.7-1.2x106 CFU/mL) S. aureus (mecA-) 11632 (0.6-1.6x106
CFU/mL), S. epidermidis (mecA+) 700562 (0.2-0.9x106 CFU/mL), S. epidermidis (mecA-)
strain 700583 (0.9-2.2x106 CFU/mL), and S. lugdunensis (mecA-) strain 49576 (1-1.2x106
CFU/mL). A minimum of 2 replicate Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panels were performed
for each combination of competing and test organisms.
Staphylococcus interference was observed for S. aureus with S. epidermidis and S. caprae
at initial concentrations tested (5.9 x105 CFU/mL), but the interference was resolved upon
re-testing at higher concentrations (1.5 x106 CFU/mL, within 2-3X LoD). There were 13
cases of interference with S. epidermidis at initial concentrations (2.2-2.5 x105 CFU/mL)
when tested against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. lugdunensis, S. capitis, S. hominis, S.
haemolyticus, and S. simulans. Higher concentrations of S. epidermidis resolved the
interference (8.5-9.4 x105 CFU/mL, within 2-3X LoD). Two cases of interference were
observed with S. lugdunensis: one case with S. epidermidis, one case with S. hominis.
Both cases resolved at higher concentrations of S. lugdunensis (1.2 x106, within 2-3X
LoD). Results are shown in the table below:

e. Interfering Substances:
The Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel was evaluated for interference by a panel of 16
different substances. Substances were spiked into BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F (with resin) or
Standard Aerobic/F (without resin) media containing negative blood incubated 24 hours in
a BACTEC Blood Culture Device. Target Staphylococcus cells were combined with the
substances at low positive concentrations at approximately 2-3X LoD (1-2.5x106
CFU/mL). The CFU concentrations for each strain were estimated by optical density
measurements and then confirmed by colony counting. The studies assessed the detection
of the same 10 Staphylococcus ATCC strains used for analytical sensitivity and microbial
interference: S. aureus, mecA+ strains BAA-1680 and BAA-1682, S. aureus, mecA+
strains 11632 and 6538, S. epidermidis, mecA+ strains 700562 and 51625, S. epidermidis,
mecA- strains 700583 and 12228, and S. lugdunensis, mecA- strains 49576 and 43809.
ATCC strain, E. faecalis, mecA- 29212, an off-panel “Negative” in the Staph ID/R Blood
Culture Panel, was also included in the study to assess chemical interference with the
sample processing control and all downstream detection steps. A minimum of two
replicate assays were performed for each Staphylococcus strain using each substance in a
background of BACTEC Plus Aerobic bottles (with resin) or Standard Aerobic bottles
(without resin), see tables below.

endogenous or exogenous test substances compete or interfere with obtaining accurate
test results with the Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel.
f. Carry-over/Cross-Contamination Study:
A study was performed to assess the cross-contamination of the Staph ID/R Blood
Culture Panel by alternatively testing high titer S. aureus, mecA+ ATCC strain BAA-
1682 and off-target negative E. faecalis ATCC strain 29212. BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F
blood bottle containing negative blood were inoculated with strain isolates and
incubated until alarm positivity in a BACTEC Blood Culture System. Alarm positive
samples were incubated past positivity consistent with timeframes used during the
specimen stability studies to obtain a high titer. Alarm positive blood cultures were
Gram stained, diluted, plated on agar plates and colonies were counted the following
day to confirm target concentrations >107 for S. aureus (3.0x107 CFU/mL) and >108 E.
faecalis (5.8x109 CFU/mL). Aliquots from the high titer blood culture bottles were
stored at -20°C until testing. Carry-over/cross-contamination was tested by running a
series of alternating runs of high titer positive and negative samples on multiple
Portrait Analyzers.
No false positive results were observed during consecutive testing of high positive
samples alternating with negative samples, demonstrating that recommended sample
handling and testing practices are effective in preventing false positive results due to
carryover or cross-contamination between samples.
g. Reproducibility:
A multicenter, blinded, reproducibility study was performed to determine
reproducibility of the Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel. Testing occurred at three sites
using a panel of seven simulated blood culture specimens, each spiked with a single
organism. Specimens were prepared in a matrix of whole blood and blood culture
media. Half of the replicates for the three Staphylococcus positive samples were
consistent with the level of organism present at the time of positivity (low) and half
were at a concentration similar to that observed after 8 hours of positivity (high). For
the one off-panel organism (E. faecalis; Staph ID/R negative) the concentration was
“high.”
The study incorporated several variables including six different operators at three sites
(two operators/site), five different cartridge lots, and 89 different Portrait Analyzers
(15 at site 1, and 12 at site 3, 62 at site 4). Over the course of 10 weeks, samples were
tested on 12 different days, for a total of 90 replicates per analyte per concentration.
Valid results were attained for 630 of 642 (98.1%) runs. For the detection of
Staphylococcus positivity (Test result “Positive”), expected positive results were
obtained for 540/540 runs (100%), and expected Staphylococcus negative results (Test
result “Negative”) were obtained in 87/90 runs (96.7%). For the detection of specific
Staphylococcus species (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. lugdunensis), expected
22

--- Page 23 ---
positive results were obtained for 534/540 runs (98.8%) and expected negative results
were obtained for 1345/1350 (99.6%) results.
A summary of results (percent agreement with the expected result) for each analyte is
provided in the following tables:

Summary of discrepant results from Reproducibility Studies
h. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
i. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Internal Controls: To ensure that the reported Portrait Analyzer result is correct,
controls have been built into the system to minimize the risk of errors during assay
processing. These controls are designed to monitor reagent performance and to
indicate correct performance of each Test Cartridge. Each Test Cartridge has
integrated control features that are automatically performed with every Staph ID/R
Blood Culture Panel. The following internal controls are included:
• Fiducial Controls: Establish orientation of the silicon chip for image
analysis.
• Amplification Threshold Control (AC): The AC is used to threshold
amplification such that potentially contaminating levels of Staphylococci are
not amplified in the test. Two synthetic double-stranded DNA templates or
plasmids are added to the test. One has homology with the primer regions
specific for the tuf gene used in the Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel, but
with unique intervening sequence so that the amplified product is not
recognized by probes on the chip surface. The shared primer binding site
allows for the tuf gene specific primers to be used for both the amplification
of Staphylococci present in a positive blood culture and the AC. The second
AC has homology with the primer region for the nuc gene used in the Staph
26

--- Page 27 ---
ID/R Blood Culture Panel, but with unique intervening sequence and works
similarly to the AC directed at the tuf gene. The ACs are lyophilized within
a small chamber preceding the Extraction Chamber of the Staph ID/R Blood
Culture Panel Test Cartridge. Upon sample loading the AC is rehydrated
and during the PCR step is amplified. The ACs can compete with
Staphylococcal genomic DNA for binding to the tuf and nuc gene primers,
but has been optimized to do so only at levels below alarm positive blood
cultures. At high Staphylococcal concentrations, the AC may be negative
due to competitive inhibition of the amplification reagents. Note that the AC
control is not detected by any probe(s) on the chip surface.
• Sample Processing Control (SPC): The SPC controls for all analytical steps
in the procedure, including DNA extraction from organisms present in the
specimen, amplification of target DNA sequences, hybridization, and
detection on the chip surface. The SPC is a strain of Bacillus subtilis cells
that has been genetically engineered with an integration vector designed to
contain shared sequence with the tuf gene primers used in the Staph ID/R
Blood Culture Panel, but with unique intervening sequence. The shared
primer binding site allows for the tuf gene specific primers to be used for
both the amplification of Staphylococci present in a positive blood culture
and the SPC. The SPC is lyophilized within a small chamber preceding the
Extraction Chamber of the Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel Test Cartridge.
After sample loading the SPC is extracted, amplified and the unique
intervening sequence is detected by a target-specific capture probe on the
chip surface. At high staphylococcal concentrations, the SPC may be
negative due to competitive inhibition of the amplification reagents.
Recommended External Controls: External controls are not provided with the
Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel, but are recommended in the package insert.
External positive and negative controls are intended to monitor for correct
procedural technique and reagent integrity. The External Positive Control is
intended to monitor for substantial reagent failure. The External Negative Control is
intended to confirm non-reactivity. External controls should be used in accordance
with the appropriate accrediting organization requirements, as applicable.
External Controls used in clinical studies: External positive and negative controls
were incorporated in the clinical trial to monitor for correct procedural technique
and reagent integrity. The external positive controls were intended to monitor for
substantial reagent failure. The external negative control using a non-
Staphylococcus Gram-positive cocci (E. faecalis) was intended to confirm non-
reactivity. Each species in the daily QC blood culture panel were grown to bottle
positivity in 2 separate preparations and aliquoted into single use frozen aliquots for
investigational use during the prospective and analytical studies.
Daily QC testing was performed by dividing the strains into 2 panels and each panel
was tested on alternating days. Daily QC testing was performed every day a
27

--- Page 28 ---
prospective, reproducibility or low prevalence study sample was tested with a Staph
ID/R Blood Culture Panel Test Cartridge. Valid, correct results were required from
the daily QC panel to include the test sample data for that day. In cases with an
invalid or erroneous result, repeat testing with a valid, correct result was required to
include the test sample data for that day. The daily QC panel results from all
prospective sites from prospective, reproducibility and low prevalence studies are
listed in the table below:

(2) This set of test runs also contained 1 "Invalid" run
(3) This set of test runs also contained 3 “invalid” runs
Eight (8) invalid test runs and 3 miscalls for a total of 11 discrepant results, were
obtained in the Daily QC Panel from all clinical sites during prospective,
reproducibility and low prevalence studies.
Specimen Stability:
A specimen stability study was conducted to support the claims of the sample
storage on the bench for alarm positive blood culture bottles. Conditions include
detection immediately after blood culture “bottle ring” and after incubation “On-
board” up to 8 hours post alarm on the BACTEC Blood Culture System (35°-37oC).
Additionally testing included, incubation once the bottle is removed from the blood
culture system, termed “Off-board”, for up to 18 hours at room temperature (15°-
30oC), up to 72 hours at 2°-8oC and the combination of room temperature for up to
12 hours followed by up to 72 hours at 2°-8oC
For sample storage on the bench studies, 4 different Staphylococcus strains were
tested: methicillin resistant S. aureus ATCC BAA-1682, methicillin resistant S.
epidermidis ATCC 700562, methicillin sensitive S. lugdunensis ATCC 49576,
methicillin resistant S. haemolyticus BAA-1693. An off-panel strain (Staph ID/R
Blood Culture Panel “Negative”), E. faecalis ATCC 29212, was also included in the
study. All strains were tested in three bottles in triplicate at each time point for a
total of 9 replicates per condition.
For preparation of these samples, the strain cultures were prepared in TSB broth,
incubated overnight, and the CFU concentrations for each strain were estimated by
optical density measurements. Three BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F blood bottles

containing negative blood were inoculated with each respective strain at
approximately 30-100 CFU/bottle and incubated until alarm positivity in a
BACTEC Blood Culture System. Alarm positive bottles were pulled at bottle ring
or incubated on the Blood Culture System past positivity for 8 hours -/+ 0.5 hour
“On-board”. Samples were removed from each bottle and stored “Off-board” at the
various temperatures for the times indicated in table below. All samples were Gram
stained, serially diluted and plated for colony counts to determine the CFU/mL
concentration at each time point and storage condition. Three tests were performed
for each of 3 bottles, resulting in 9 total test runs for each condition. The data for
each strain and time point are shown in the table below.

**This set of test runs also contained 2 "Invalid" runs
The Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel results for all the conditions and time points are
in 100% concordance with the expected results. The stability studies resulted in 8
‘invalid’ calls out of a total of 458 cards, for a rate of 2%, consistent with the
prospective study invalid rate. At each time point, under the three storage conditions,
S. aureus ATCC BAA-1682, S. epidermidis ATCC 700562, S. lugdunensis ATCC
49576, S. haemolyticus BAA-1693 and E. faecalis ATCC 29212 resulted in the
expected ‘Positive’ or ‘Negative’ call, demonstrating sufficient stability of
Staphylococcus in the BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F bottles in support of the claims of the
sample stability for up to 18 hours at room temperature (15°-30°C), 8 hours at 35°-
37°C and 72 hours at 2°-8°C.
The study was also informative in determining the conditions that result in the highest
and lowest CFU/mL bacterial load in each bottle based on colony counts. As expected,
bottle ring resulted in the lowest bacterial load across all strains tested: 7.2x106 –
7.7x108 CFU/mL. Also as expected, 8 hours incubation past bottle ring on the
BACTEC Blood Culture Device increased bacterial load levels (2.3x107 - 3.4x109
CFU/mL), with Bottle Ring + 8 hours “On-board” + 18 hours (30°C) “Off-board” the
consensus highest bacterial load condition for all strains: 1.1x108 – 3.1x109 CFU/mL.

To determine the effect of blood culture bottle type on Staph ID/R Blood Culture
Panel, 13 unique bottle types were tested in the presence of target and non-target
organisms. Staphylococcus isolates or E. faecalis (negative) at bottle ring load levels
(2x106-1x108 CFU/mL) consistent with the specimen stability studies. All bottles were
tested with the highest volume of negative blood recommended by the manufacturer
(e.g., if the recommended blood volume was 8-10 mL, 10 mL of blood was spiked into
the bottle). Bottles with blood were pre-incubated 18 hours at 35-37oC in a BACTEC
Blood Culture System or in a shaking incubator prior to testing. Bacteria isolates were
incubated >18 hrs in TSB, and the CFU concentrations for each strain were estimated
by optical density measurements, confirmed by serial dilution and colony counting.
The studies assessed the detection of 7 Staphylococcus ATCC strains used for
analytical sensitivity: S. aureus, mecA+ BAA-1680, S. aureus, mecA+ 1682, S.
aureus, mecA- 11632, S. epidermidis, mecA+ 51625, S. epidermidis, mecA- 12228, S.
lugdunensis, mecA- 49576, S. capitis, mecA- 35661. The studies also assessed
performance of the Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel in the presence of E. faecalis
29212 (Negative).
The following bottle types were tested in the study: BACTEC (Standard 10
Aerobic/F, Standard Anaerobic 10/F, Plus Aerobic/F, Plus Anaerobic/F, Lytic 10/F,
and PEDS Plus/F), BacT/Alert (SA Standard Aerobic, SN Standard Anaerobic, FA
FAN Aerobic, FN FAN Anaerobic, and PF Pediatric FAN), and Versa Trek (Redox 1
and Redox 2). Three bottles of each bottle type were used for each strain, and the
samples tested three times in the Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel for a total of 9 runs
for each strain and bottle type combination.
For the ‘valid’ runs tested, all of the potential blood bottle types were compatible with
the
Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel, with no false negative results. The results are shown
in the table below:

"This set of test runs contained 1 false positive Staphylococcus, species undetermined result
A false positive “S. aureus, mecA Present” result was observed in one test run from
one Versa Trek Redox 1 bottle for S. aureus, mecA- 11632. The discrepant result is
thought to be a contamination event, since all other samples (8/9) gave the correct
“S. aureus present, mecA Absent” call, including 2/3 correct results from the same
bottle with the discrepant call. All test results did result in a correct S. aureus result,
suggesting that the bottle type did not interfere with the assay.
A false positive “Staphylococcus Positive, Staphylococcus species OTHER than S.
aureus or S. lugdunensis, mecA absent” result was observed for E. faecalis 29212 in
one test run from one BacT/Alert SN Anaerobic bottle. The discrepant result is also
thought to be a random contamination event, because the 16 other “valid” test runs
returned a correct “Staphylococcus Negative” result, including 2/3 correct initial
results and 3/3 correct re- test results from the same bottle with the discrepant call.
The only other exceptions observed during this study were 9 ‘Invalid’ call runs that
are noted in the table above, all with E. faecalis 29212. When tested with E. faecalis
29212, 1 invalid run was observed for BACTEC PEDS Plus/F, 1 invalid run for
BacT/Alert SA Aerobic, and 1 invalid run for BacT/Alert PF Pediatric FAN bottle
types. In all of these cases, extra test runs were performed to evaluate any possible
interference with the assay in a Negative sample (evaluating SPC only). Re-test with
9 cards resulted in an additional 3 invalid runs for BACTEC PEDS Plus/F, 1 invalid
run for BacT/Alert SA Aerobic, and 1 invalid run for BacT/Alert SN Anaerobic
(retested due to false positive contamination result). Overall, it appears that the
bottle types with invalid results have an elevated invalid rate (5-28%) compared to
the prospective study (2%).
k. Fresh versus Frozen Study:
A study was performed to assess the tolerance of the Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel
to correctly identify cultures stored frozen at -20°C. In this study, 5 different strains
used for the Staph ID/R Blood Culture QC Panel were tested: S. aureus, mecA+
ATCC 33592, S. epidermidis, mecA+ ATCC 700562, S. epidermidis, mecA- ATCC
12228, S. lugdunensis mecA-, ATCC 49576, and E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (Negative).
In addition, 4 strains for fresh vs frozen Reference Site testing were used in the study:
S. aureus, mecA+ ATCC BAA-1682, S. epidermidis, mecA+ ATCC 700562, S.
lugdunensis mecA-, ATCC 49576, and E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (Negative).
For preparation of these samples, isolate cultures were prepared in TSB broth,
incubated overnight and the CFU concentrations for each strain were estimated by
optical density measurements. BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F blood bottles containing

negative blood were inoculated with each culture at approximately 30-100 CFU/bottle
and incubated until alarm positivity in a BACTEC Blood Culture System. Alarm
positive bottles were pulled at bottle ring or incubated past positivity < 8 hours,
consistent with timeframes used during the specimen stability studies. Alarm positive
blood cultures were gram stained, diluted, plated on agar plates and colonies counted
the following day to confirm concentrations of each bottle.
Samples were tested in the Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel after bottle ring, but
before freezing, and aliquots from the bottles were stored frozen at -20°C. The frozen
aliquots were thawed and tested before 1 month and after 5 months storage and tested
in the Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel.
The Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel results for the fresh vs frozen sample stability
study were 100% concordant with expected results for all strains tested. Frozen
storage did not impact performance in the Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel.

A parallel study was performed to assess the tolerance of the Staph ID/R Blood
Culture Panel reference methods to correctly identify cultures stored frozen at -20°C.
Reference site validation samples were shipped at room temperature or frozen and
tested in the same assays used during prospective studies (i.e., BD Phoenix ID for
species identification and cefoxitin disc diffusion for methicillin resistance). The
samples shipped at room temperature were tested within 18 hours of bottle ring,
consistent with the specimen stability study conditions. Frozen aliquots were stored
frozen (-20°C), consistent with conditions used for the prospective study, and thawed
when ready to be tested. Frozen aliquots were thawed and tested at 1, 30, 60, 90 and
120 days.

3. Clinical Studies:
A method comparison study was conducted at three external, geographically-diverse
clinical study sites in the U.S. during an eight month period in 2014–2015 to evaluate the
comparative performance of the Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel assay with the PA500
Portrait™ Analyzer System to applicable conventional biochemical and culture reference
microbiology methods. Eligible study subjects included individuals receiving routine care
requiring blood culture testing. Blood culture specimens were collected from the patients
and incubated on the BACTEC continuous monitoring blood culture system. Bottles that
were flagged positive by the instrument were Gram stained and then bottles confirmed to
contain gram-positive cocci in clusters (GPCC) or gram-positive cocci in singles (GPC)
were then tested with the Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel and compared to traditional
laboratory reference methods (i.e., culture followed by testing blood culture isolates with
conventional biochemical, BD Phoenix, and cefoxitin disc diffusion testing). Cefoxitin
disc diffusion tests were used as the reference method for confirming mecA mediated
resistance. A total of 853 samples were collected for all three sites combined. Twenty-
two (22) specimens were excluded from the Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel clinical
study dataset. The remaining 831 clinical specimens met the inclusion criteria and were
used in the prospective study to evaluate the performance of the Staph ID/R Blood
Culture Panel. A total of 762 prospective samples were tested originally in the clinical
trial, while the remaining 69 archived frozen specimens were tested after the prospective
clinical trial

In addition, 102 Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel assays were performed on a ‘Low
Prevalence’ panel of contrived or ‘simulated’ blood culture specimens, consisting of low
prevalence Staphylococcus species and gram-positive negatives. These specimens were
prepared by spiking blood culture bottles containing whole blood with bacterial
suspensions of bacterial isolates. Prepared blood culture bottles were then grown to
positivity on the BACTEC blood culture system until flagged positive. Gram stain was
performed to verify the presence of gram-positive cocci in clusters (GPCC) or gram-
positive cocci in singles (GPC) and then testing was performed with the Staph ID/R
Blood Culture Panel.
The following tables provide the clinical performance of the Staph ID/R Blood
Culture Panel for organism identification of overall Staphylococcus species, S.
aureus, S. epidermidis, S. lugdunensis, and Staphylococcus species undetermined
(i.e., not S. aureus, or S. lugdunensis) as determined by the reference methods. For
each organism identification, Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) and Negative
Percent Agreement (NPA) of the Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel assay are
calculated based upon the % agreement to the reference methods.
