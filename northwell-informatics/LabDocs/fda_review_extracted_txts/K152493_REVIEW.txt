L. Test Principle:
The POGO Automatic Blood Glucose Monitoring System (POGO BGMS) is a
quantitative assay for the detection of glucose in capillary whole blood sampled from
the fingertip. The system includes glucose-oxidase-based dry-reagent test strips housed in a
cartridge and a photometer to read the glucose-dependent color change from the in-use strip.
The meter uses calibration information from a barcode on the disposable cartridge to convert
the reflectance information into a plasma-equivalent glucose value.
M. Performance Characteristics:
a. Precision/Reproducibility
The sponsor performed repeatability studies using venous whole blood samples spiked
with five different glucose concentrations (30 to 50, 51 to 110, 111 to 150, 151 to 250,
251 to 400 mg/dL). Each glucose level was analyzed in replicates of 10, with 3
cartridge lots, and 10 meters for a total of 300 tests per each glucose level. Results are
summarized below:

Intermediate precision was evaluated using three levels of glucose control solutions
with concentrations of approximately 30, 100 and 300 mg/dL. Each sample was
measured in duplicate with three test strip lots and 10 Rightest GM700 meters.
These tests were performed over 20 days, for a total of 600 tests per glucose level.
Results are summarized below.
Intermediate precision summary:
Glucose

100 600 96.2 3.0 3.1
300 600 288.9 9.3 3.2
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using three test strip lots and 9 mixed pools of venous blood
samples ranging in glucose concentrations of 19.8, 40.5, 79.3, 117, 164, 207, 289.5, 424,
and 528.5 mg/dL as measured by YSI 2300. Each level was measured in replicates of 5
and the values from the POGO Automatic Meter were compared with those obtained
from YSI 2300. Results from regression analysis:
Test strip lot #1: y = 0.9751x + 1.73; R2 = 0.996
Test strip lot #2: y = 1.005x – 1.42; R2 = 0.997
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of 20
500 mg/dL.
The sponsor demonstrated that the meter reads ‘LO’ when glucose test results are <20
mg/dL and ‘HI’ when they are >500 mg/dL, as intended.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The POGO Automatic Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to NIST SRM
917c. The method comparison study was performed using the candidate device and
YSI as the reference method (see Section M.3.c)
Test Strip (Cartridge) Stability:
Test strip cartridge stability was assessed in accelerated and real time studies. Testing
protocols and acceptance criteria for the POGO Automatic Test Cartridges were
reviewed and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims shelf life stability of
12 months and an open-vial stability of 60 days at the recommended storage
temperatures of 40°F-86°F (4°C-30°C) and 10-90% RH.

Open cartridge cell function
The sponsor performed an open test tolerance to evaluate the open cartridge cell
performance. The POGO system was used to test venous blood samples at 80 mg/dL
and 320 mg/dL glucose concentrations after the following sequence: at various time
points (1, 5, 10 and 15 minutes) following the opening of the test cell by the meter,
blood was then applied to the lancet. Acceptable bias was demonstrated between
meter results and the reference method (YSI) to support the 5 minute open cartridge
cell function of the POGO system.
Control Solution Value assignment and Stability:
Value assignment:
Each Control Solution level is tested twenty times on each cartridge lot and the
average of the POGO results from those replicates is used as the “calibration code
control mean” for that cartridge lot. The assigned calibration code control means
(glucose values) are recorded in the barcode that is placed on each cartridge in the lot.
The POGO meter calculates the control range for each level as +15% of its calibration
code control mean, as read from the cartridge barcode.
Control Solution Stability:
Stability was assessed using real-time and accelerated testing for each control
solution level. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable to support the shelf life stability claim of 12 months when stored at the
recommended storage temperatures of 40°F-86°F (4°C-30°C).
The control solution wands are single-use therefore, open-vial stability claims are not
necessary.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20 to 500 mg/dL based on linearity studies above (section
M.1.b.).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by spiking venous blood with two levels of
glucose concentrations (80 and 320 mg/dL). Each of these samples was divided into
a test pool and a control pool and each potential interfering substances was added to
the test pool. Each compound was tested at two concentrations, normal/therapeutic
and high/toxic concentrations and each sample was analyzed in replicates of 10 with
the POGO Automatic meter. The % difference between the test sample and the
control sample was calculated. Results are presented in the table below:

gout or kidney disease (>9 mg/dL uric acid) then your blood glucose results may be
inaccurate. If you are unsure, then ask your doctor.
If you are taking acetaminophen containing drugs (e.g. Tylenol, certain cold and flu
remedies etc.) in excess of the recommended levels (>20 mg/dL) then you may get
inaccurate results with this system. If you are unsure, then ask your doctor.
If you are taking vitamin C (ascorbic acid) in excess of the recommended levels >3
mg/dL, then your glucose results may be inaccurate with this system. If you are unsure,

User performance study:
To assess the performance of the POGO Automatic Blood Glucose Monitoring
System in the hands of the intended users the sponsor performed a study with 233
lay-user participants who performed testing of fingerstick capillary samples using the
POGO system unassisted. Meter results were compared to capillary fingerstick blood
glucose results obtained on a reference analyzer (YSI). Glucose concentrations
ranging from 46.5 mg/dL to 437 mg/dL were tested using three test strip lots. The
results relative to YSI are summarized in the tables below:

Control solution usability study:
To assess the ability of users to understand the labeling and properly use the
control solution wands the sponsor performed a usability study with 29 lay-users.
The participants were provided with an excerpt from the Control Solution section of
the POGO Owner’s Manual and asked to perform a control solution without
assistance to obtain a result, “P” (Pass) or “F” (Fail). The study was followed by
followed by participants followed by a questionnaire an assessment of the subject’s
testing performance by the study staff. The study demonstrates the subjects were able
to use the control solution wands to obtain a ‘result’ using the labeling.
4. Clinical cut-off:

3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test cartridge as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip
only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test pad through the lancet in
the test cartridge by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
The meter does not require calibration or coding by the user.
6. Quality Control:
Two pre-filled, single-use control solution wands are provided with the POGO
System (POGO Control Solutions Level 1 and Level 2). The wands have a foil-
sealed reservoir at the end that is inserted into the meter test port. The meter
automatically detects whether the sample is blood or control solution and
distinguishes from Level 1 and Level 2. The meter uses the cartridge barcode
information to evaluate the calculated control result to display a P (pass) or F (fail).
Different cartridge lots have different levels encoded on the barcode.
Up to 500 user-accessible test results can be stored. Results are stored automatically and
identified by the meter as either a user glucose reading or a control solution result that the
meter determines by detecting the signature of a dye added to the control solution. The
meter also allows previous test results to be recalled and displayed individually or
averaged (for example, 7, 14 or 30 day averages of glucose test results).
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the
POGO Automatic Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using venous
whole blood to seven hematocrit levels (20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 55%, and 60%)
spiked with glucose to achieve 4 concentrations (60, 120, 250 and 400 mg/dL). Each
sample was then tested in replicates of 5 using the POGO Automatic Meters and 3

--- Page 12 ---
cartridge lots and the values were compared with those obtained from YSI 2300
analyzer. The % biases relative to YSI were acceptable within the claimed hematocrit
range and support the claimed hematocrit range of 20 to 60%.
2. Altitude Study:
Venous whole blood samples were adjusted to obtain 3 glucose concentrations (60,
120 and 300 mg/dL) were tested at 36, 5333 and 10,407 feet above sea level. Each
blood sample was tested using the POGO Automatic Blood Glucose Monitoring
System in replicates of five at each elevation and results were compared to YSI
values. The results demonstrate acceptable bias to YSI to support the claims in the
labeling that altitudes up to 10,000 feet above sea level have no significant effect on
blood glucose measurements when using the POGO Automatic Blood Glucose
Monitoring System.
3. Sample volume study:
The sponsor performed a study to verify the test strip sample volume requirement
for the POGO Automatic Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Blood samples (60,
120 and 300 mg/dL glucose) were tested at five sample volumes (150 nL, 200 nL,
250 nL, 300 nL, and 1000 nL) and values obtained were compared to YSI values.
Results support the claimed sample volume of 250 nL and the error code for
insufficient sample volume.
4. Operating conditions study:
The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous blood samples
adjusted to three glucose concentrations (60, 120 and 300 mg/dL) to evaluate
° ° ° °
temperature and humidity conditions ranging from 50 F to 104 F (10 C to 40 C) and
relative humidity from 10% to 90%. Each condition and glucose concentration was
tested in replicates of 10. Meter results were compared to YSI values. Six temperature
and humidity combinations were tested including low temperature/low humidity, low
temperature/high humidity, average temperature/low humidity, average
temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low humidity, and high temperature/high
humidity. No significant effect (relative to YSI) was observed with the temperature
and humidity combinations tested. The results support the claims in the labeling that
the system can be used in conditions of 50°F to 104°F (10°C to 40°C) with relative
humidity of 10 to 90%.
5. Readability Assessment:
The readability of the labeling (user manual, test strip package insert and control
solution package insert) was evaluated using a Flesch-Kincaid analysis and was
found to be at the 8th grade level.
6. EMC Testing:
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic
testing (EMC) had been performed and the System was found compliant.

--- Page 13 ---
7. Software documentation:
The software documentation was reviewed and found to be acceptable. The firm
provided documentation to support the device was designed, developed and is
under good software lifecycle processes
8. Infection Control Studies:
The device system is intended for single-patient use. Cleaning and disinfection
efficacy studies were performed demonstrating that the meter interior and exterior
can be cleaned and disinfected using Clorox Germicidal Wipes (EPA Reg. No.
67619-12). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor using the POGO
Automatic Blood Glucose Monitoring System and demonstrating that there was no
change in performance of the system or internal and external materials of the meter
after 730 cleaning and disinfection cycles, using the chosen disinfectant, to simulate
