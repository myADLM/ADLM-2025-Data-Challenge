H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Wondfo Propoxyphene Urine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the
qualitative determination of d-Propoxyphene in human urine at a cutoff concentration of
300 ng/mL. The test is available in a dip card format and a test cup format. It is intended
for prescription use and over the counter use. The test provides only a preliminary
analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to
obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. The
test will yield preliminary positive results when the prescription drug d-propoxyphene is
ingested, even at or above therapeutic doses. There is no uniformly recognized cutoff
concentration for d-Propoxyphene. It is not intended to distinguish between prescription
use or abuse of this drug. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is
positive.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For over-the-counter and prescription use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable. The device is a visually read single-use device.
I. Device Description:
The Wondfo Propoxyphene Urine Test is a rapid test for the qualitative detection of
Propoxyphene in urine samples.
The device has two formats – test cup and dip card. The test cup comprises two items - a
urine storage/transport vial and an integrated a urine collection cup with a lateral flow device.
The dip card comprises three items – urine collection cup, urine storage/transport vial, and
lateral flow test device.
Both devices are single-use and visually read.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The assay type is a competitive immunoassay constructed on a lateral flow device. Each
assay uses a mouse monoclonal anti-drug antibody-dye conjugate, fixed drug-protein
conjugates, and anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibodies coated on the test membranes. When
the absorbent end of the test is immersed into a urine sample, the urine is absorbed into the

device by capillary action and mixes with the antibody-dye conjugate, flowing across the pre-
coated membrane. At analyte concentrations below the target cut-off, antibody-dye
conjugates bind to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the
device. This produces a colored test line that indicates a negative result. When analyte
concentration is above the cut-off, analyte molecules bind to the antibody-dye conjugate,
preventing the antibody-dye conjugate from binding to the drug-protein conjugate
immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. No colored band shows in the test region,
indicating a potentially positive result. A band should form in the control region (C) of the
device regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Performance characteristics are found in the predicate, k121557.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable, the device is intended for qualitative use.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Control materials:
External control standards are not supplied with this device; however, this device has
internal procedural control. A colored line appearing in the control region confirms
sufficient sample volume and adequate membrane wicking. Users are instructed that
the test is invalid if a line fails to appear in the control region.
d. Detection limit:
See k121557.
e. Analytical specificity:
See k121557.
f. Assay cut-off:

Consumer / lay person study:
The lay user study was comprised of 280 lay users who were divided into two groups
to test the Dipcard format and the Test Cup format (140 each). The testing was
conducted at three intended user sites: one hospital and two drug addiction recovery
centers in P.R. China. All participants came from diverse educational and
occupational backgrounds. Only one of the 280 participants indicated that they had
previous experience in drugs of abuse testing.
In the group testing with the Test Cup, there were 77 male and 63 female participants
with ages ranging from 21 to 62 years of age. In the group testing with the Dipcard,
there were 73 male and 67 female participants with ages ranging from 21 to 64 years
of age.
The samples were urine and prepared at the following concentrations; -100%, +/-
75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of the cut-off by spiking Propoxyphene into drug free, pooled
urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by gas
chromatography/ mass spectrometry. Each urine sample was aliquoted into
individual containers, blind-labeled, and randomized. Each participant was provided
with the package insert, 1 blind labeled sample, and a Wondfo Propoxyphene Urine
Test for a Dip card or Test cup. The test procedure was conducted solely based on the
users reading and understanding of the package insert.
After the test, the consumer was required to fill out questionnaire on the ease of
5

understanding the package insert instructions. A Flesch-Kincaid reading analysis was
performed on the package insert and the score revealed a reading grade level of less
than 7. All lay users indicated that the device instructions can be easily followed. The
results are summarized below:
