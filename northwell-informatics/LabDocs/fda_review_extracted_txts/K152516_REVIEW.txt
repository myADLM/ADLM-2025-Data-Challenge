H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Discs are used for semi-quantitative in vitro susceptibility
testing by standardized agar diffusion test procedures. BD BBL Sensi-Disc Ceftazidime
avibactam (30/20µg) is intended for use in determining the susceptibility to Ceftazidime
avibactam of a wide range of bacteria, as described in the "Indications for Use" section. Zone
sizes used for interpretation of tests, including control organism limits, were determined by
the antimicrobics manufacturer and received FDA approval under NDA Number 206494.
Indication(s) for use:
Use of BD BBL Sensi-Disc Ceftazidime avibactam (30/20µg) for in vitro agar diffusion
susceptibility testing is indicated when there is a need to determine the susceptibility of
bacteria to Ceftazidime avibactam. The concentration of 30/20µg has been shown to be
active in vitro against most strains of microorganisms listed below, as described in the FDA
approved drug insert for this antimicrobics.
Active In Vitro and in Clinical Infections Against:
Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (cIAI)
Gram-negative Microorganisms
Escherichia coli
Enterobacter cloacae
Klebsiella pneumoniae
Klebsiella oxytoca
Proteus mirabilis
Providencia stuartii
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTI), including Pyelonephritis

Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Enterobacter aerogenes
Enterobacter cloacae
Proteus spp.
Klebsiella pneumoniae
Active In Vitro Against:
Gram-negative Microorganisms
Morganella morganii
Providencia rettgeri
Serratia marcescens

I. Device Description:
BD BBL Sensi-Disc Ceftazidime avibactam (30/20µg) is prepared by impregnating high
quality paper with accurately determined amounts of Ceftazidime avibactam(30/20µg)
supplied by the drug manufacturer. Each Ceftazidime avibactam (30/20µg) disc is clearly
marked on both sides with the agent and drug content. Ceftazidime avibactam (30/20µg)
cartridges each contain 50 impregnated discs that are packed as a single cartridge in a
single box. Ceftazidime avibactam (30/20µg) discs are used for in vitro susceptibility
evaluations by the agar diffusion test method.
Agar diffusion susceptibility methods employing dried filter paper disks impregnated
with specific concentrations of antimicrobial agents were developed in the 1940s. In
order to eliminate or minimize variability in the testing, Bauer et al. developed a
standardized procedure in which Mueller Hinton Agar was selected as the test medium.
Standardized procedures were followed for testing Ceftazidime avibactam. Those are
based on standard methods published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute
(CLSI) and are referenced in the FDA pharmaceutical drug package insert.

L. Test Principle:
Discs containing a wide variety of antimicrobial agents are applied to the surface of Mueller
Hinton Agar plates inoculated with pure cultures of clinical isolates. Following incubation, the
plates are examined and the zones of inhibition surrounding the disks are measured and
compared with established zone size ranges for individual antimicrobial agents in order to
determine the agent(s) most suitable for use in antimicrobial therapy. The categorical
