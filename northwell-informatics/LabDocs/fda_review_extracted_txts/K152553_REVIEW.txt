H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use statements below
2. Indication(s) for use:
CueSee Hypoxic is a pre-tonometered bovine hemoglobin (Hb) quality control material
for professional use for monitoring blood gas analyzers’ performance of Oxygen partial
pressure (pO2).
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable
I. Device Description:
CueSee Hypoxic is prepared from a stroma-free bovine hemoglobin solution and provides the
oxygen buffering characteristics of fresh whole blood. The concentrations of total
hemoglobin and acid-base levels are within the normal physiological range. Tonometry with
a predetermined level of oxygen balanced with nitrogen provides a distinct assay value for
partial pressure of oxygen measurements. CueSee Hypoxic contains no preservatives,
viscosity adjusters or other additives that might adversely affect electrode measurements.
CueSee Hypoxic provides one level in the critical low pO2 value range, each ampule holding
2.5 mL of solution. CueSee Hypoxic is packed in a carton box containing 5 ampules.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Analyte Reference Material
pO2 NIST SRM:, 2658a
Stability:
The shelf life testing protocol and acceptance criteria for the CueSee Hypoxic control
was reviewed and found to be adequate. The real time stability study shows results up
to 31 days when stored at 2-8°C supporting the shelf life claim of 31 days from date
of manufacture when stored at 2-8°C prior to opening.
The open vial stability testing protocol and acceptance criteria for the CueSee
Hypoxic control was reviewed and found to be adequate. The open vial stability study
shows results up to 10 minutes after opening supporting the open vial stability claim
of 10 minutes.
Value Assignment:
Value assignment protocols and acceptance criteria for the CueSee Hypoxic were
reviewed and found to be adequate. Values are determined by taking the mean of
multiple determinations performed on randomly selected samples from each lot on
