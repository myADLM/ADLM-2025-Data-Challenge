H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
FilmArray Respiratory Panel EZ (RP EZ) is a multiplexed nucleic acid test intended for
use with the FilmArray 2.0 EZ Configuration instrument for the simultaneous qualitative
detection and identification of multiple respiratory viral and bacterial nucleic acids in
nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) obtained from individuals suspected of respiratory tract
infections. The following organism types and subtypes are identified using the FilmArray
RP EZ: Adenovirus, Coronavirus, Human Metapneumovirus, Influenza A, Influenza A
subtype H1, Influenza A subtype H3, Influenza A subtype H1-2009, Influenza B,
Parainfluenza Virus, Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus,
Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The
detection and identification of specific viral and bacterial nucleic acids from individuals
exhibiting signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection aids in the diagnosis of
respiratory infection if used in conjunction with other clinical and epidemiological
information. The results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis,
treatment, or other management decisions. Negative results in the setting of a respiratory
illness may be due to infection with pathogens that are not detected by this test or, lower
respiratory tract infection that is not detected by a nasopharyngeal swab specimen.
Positive results do not rule out co-infection with other organisms: the agent(s) detected
by the FilmArray RP EZ may not be the definite cause of disease. Additional laboratory
testing (e.g., bacterial and viral culture, immunofluorescence, and radiography) may be
necessary when evaluating a patient with possible respiratory tract infection.
Due to the small number of positive specimens collected for certain organisms
during the prospective clinical study, performance characteristics for Bordetella
pertussis, Coronavirus, Influenza A H1, Influenza A H3, Influenza A H1-2009,
Influenza B, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Parainfluenza Virus were established
primarily with retrospective clinical specimens. Performance characteristics for
Chlamydophila pneumoniae were established primarily using contrived clinical
specimens.
Due to the genetic similarity between Human Rhinovirus and Enterovirus, the FilmArray
RP EZ cannot reliably differentiate them. A positive FilmArray RP EZ
Rhinovirus/Enterovirus result should be followed-up using an alternate method (e.g., cell
culture or sequence analysis) if differentiation is required.

--- Page 3 ---
Performance characteristics for Influenza A were established when Influenza A H1-2009,
A H1, and A H3 were the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation. Performance of
detecting Influenza A may vary if other Influenza A strains are circulating or a novel
Influenza A virus emerges. If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based
on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health
authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions
for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for
testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is
available to receive and culture specimens.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
FilmArray 2.0 EZ Configuration instrument
I. Device Description:
The FilmArray Respiratory Panel EZ (RP EZ) consists of two basic components: the
FilmArray RP EZ pouch and the FilmArray 2.0 EZ Configuration instrument. The
description of this device is essentially the same as that of the FDA-cleared FilmArray
Respiratory Panel (RP), except for the software modifications and the control reagent
modifications described below. Please refer to FDA cleared 510(k) submissions k103175,
k110764, k120267, k123620, and k143080 for detailed device descriptions.
Software Modifications:
1. Implemented a simplified EZ version of the software running on FilmArray 2.0 EZ
Configuration instrument. This version includes updates/changes to the workflow, error
handling, run browsing, instrument control, database management, notes and tags
dialogue, report content, and software architecture. For example, this version removes the
ability to use more than one FilmArray 2.0 instrument from a single connected laptop
computer, the availability of the “FilmArray Dashboard”, and user access to the “PCR
Evaluator”.
2. Introduced a new FilmArray RP EZ pouch module, which modified the test results from
reporting the four Coronavirus types (i.e., Coronavirus 229E, Coronavirus HKU1,
Coronavirus NL63, and Coronavirus OC43) and the four Parainfluenza virus types (i.e.,
Parainfluenza Virus 1, Parainfluenza Virus 2, Parainfluenza Virus 3, and Parainfluenza
Virus 4) separately and independently to reporting a single ‘combined’ Coronavirus result
and a single ‘combined’ Parainfluenza virus.

Control Reagent Modification:
A new external control panel that is available from Maine Molecular Quality Controls, Inc.,
Scarborough, ME (online at www.mmqci.com) was recommended for use with the
FilmArray RP EZ. This external control panel consists of a set of ready-to-use positive and
negative control solutions, along with a package insert explaining the expected results. This
external control panel should be tested when receiving a new shipment of test pouches and
when training a new user.

External Positive and Negative Controls
A new external control panel that is available from Maine Molecular Quality
Controls, Inc., Scarborough, ME (online at www.mmqci.com) is recommended to be
used with the FilmArray RP EZ:
FilmArray RP EZ Control Panel M265, Part number M265
· RP EZ Positive M266, Part number M266
· RP EZ Negative M267, Part number M267
This external control panel is also available as BioFire Diagnostics Part Number
CHEM-CTL-0001.
The external control panel consists of a set of ready-to-use positive and negative
control solutions, along with a package insert explaining the expected results. The
external control panel should be tested when receiving a new shipment of test
pouches and when training a new user. This external control panel is the subject of
separate 510(k) Premarket Notification K161573 from Maine Molecular Quality
Controls, Inc., Scarborough, ME.
A field study was performed to assess the ability of the intended user to perform
external control testing using the recommended control materials and testing
procedure for the FilmArray Respiratory Panel EZ (RP EZ) in a CLIA-waived
setting. The primary metric evaluated by this study was the ability of these users to
acquire and accurately interpret FilmArray RP EZ results when testing the provided
external control materials. The FilmArray RP EZ test was performed according to the
manufacturer's instructions by users with training and educational backgrounds
consistent with those in the CLIA-waived testing environment (i.e., the intended
users). User training on use of the FilmArray RP EZ was limited to the training video
and the quick guide provided with the FilmArray RP EZ system.
The external control panel tested in this study consisted of a positive mix containing
synthetic targets for all FilmArray RP EZ analytes and a negative mix that contains
no analytes. Multiple operators participated in this study at each of the three sites (a
total of 16 different FilmArray RP EZ operators across the three sites). Testing
6

--- Page 7 ---
consisted of three positive and three negative controls run per day, and spanned a
period of 10 days (total of 60 control runs per site). Three lots each of the external
control panel and three lots of FilmArray RP EZ pouches were tested across all sites.
A total of 182 external controls were tested (91 positive and 91 negative) by FilmArray RP EZ
users at two CLIA-waived clinical settings and one simulated testing setting (BioFire
Diagnostics). Two test runs were excluded from final data analysis due to invalid results caused
by internal pouch control failures. Data for the remaining 180 control tests are shown below in
Table 1.
Table 1. Summary of FilmArray RP EZ External Controls
Testing Results
Site Positive Negative Total
#1 30/30 (100%) 28/30 (93.3%) 58/60 (96.7%)
#2 30/30 (100%) 30/30 (100%) 60/60 (100%)
#3 30/30 (100%) 30/30 (100%) 60/60 (100%)
Total 90/90 (100%) 88/90 (97.8%) 178/180 (98.9%)
The control material testing in this study produced an unexpected result in two test
runs. In both cases, expected negative control mixes produced Coronavirus
detections. Retrospective analysis of the two instances did not lead to any correlation
between the two events, other than the fact that both of these tests were performed at
the same site. The day of testing, operator, instrument, pouch lot, control mix lot, and
species of Coronavirus detected (i.e., NL63 vs 229E) were all different.
After examining the workflow, the timeline of events and the details of the runs, the
most likely cause of both instances is determined to be due to carryover from a
positive control that was loaded within close time proximity to the negative control. It
is possible that the users disregarded the instructions to only handle one sample and
pouch at a time.
As a way of introducing further mitigation measures to guard against potential carry-
over contamination from the positive control material, additional warnings and
guidelines (e.g., “the negative control test should be run before the positive control
test” and “change gloves and clean the work area between preparation of each
sample”, etc.) have been added to the product labeling and the training video.
Overall, these data demonstrate that the intended user can accurately perform external
control testing using the FilmArray RP EZ in a CLIA-waived setting.

O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
See Section, I. Device Description
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
a. Level of Concern:
The Level of Concern was established as moderate during the initial clearance for the
FilmArray RP under k103175. The level has not changed.
b. Software Description:
The software description was updated. The changes from the last cleared version of
the software include updates to the workflow, error handling, run browsing,
instrument control, database management, notes and tags dialogue, report content,
software architecture, introduction of the EZ pouch module (along with associated
documentation), the combination of coronavirus assays into a single call and the
combination of parainfluenza virus assays into single call for the CLIA-waived pouch
module. The FilmArray EZ Pouch Module, as defined in the software, contains all the
information that is needed to analyze and interpret the data from a FilmArray 2.0
instrument run. The fundamental elements of the pouch definition are the assays,
array layout, controls, and interpretations.
Of note, the FilmArray RP EZ software removes the ability to use more than one
instrument, removes the availability of the “Dashboard” and removes access to the
“PCR Evaluator”.
The FilmArray RP EZ software is controlled by Windows-based software running on
a laptop that is connected to one FilmArray 2.0 Instrument. The software has been
designed to be simple to ensure that tests are correctly performed and test results are
not misinterpreted. The descriptions provided appear to be acceptable.
c. Device Hazard Analysis (DHA):
The DHA was updated to reflect the risks of both Off-The-Shelf and FilmArray
software in the context of the FilmArray RP EZ system. A tabular list of potential
hazards and an assessment of risk posed by the software and any interactive
components was provided. Risks were calculated and categorized as High, Medium,
Low or Zero. Risks were deemed acceptable after appropriate mitigations were put in
place to address each risk.
11

d. Software Design Specification (SDS):
SDS documentation was referenced and referenced accordingly. During software and
firmware development, detailed development documents were produced under the
Quality System. The design specifications drove the software and firmware
development, dictated the behavior of the modules, and formed the basis of design
verification. The documentation provided appears to be acceptable.
e. Software Requirements Specifications (SRS):
Updates were provided to the SRS documentation, produced under the Quality
System. The SRS includes a summary list of the fundamental hardware and software
components necessary to functionally implement the software changes for the
FilmArray RP EZ. The submitted documentation appears to be acceptable.
f. Traceability:
Updates were provided to the trace matrix from design input to output, providing
information showing traceability for hardware and software requirements, risk
assessment, and validation, as applicable. The submitted traceability appears to be
acceptable.
g. Verification and Validation (V&V):
Updates were provided to the V&V documentation. This information included a
detailed description of validation activities, test protocol, pass/fail criteria and results
of those activities. These V&V activities were tied through a trace matrix to system
requirements and a risk assessment, where appropriate. These activities included
verification that features that were originally available to the end user remained
available and functional after the modifications were made. The submitted
documentation appears to be acceptable.
h. Revision Level History (RLH):
An update was provided to the RLH. The latest version of the FilmArray RP EZ
software is v2.100.16. The latest version removes the ability to use more than one
instrument, and removes availability of the “Dashboard” and access to the “PCR
Evaluator”. The submitted RLH appears to be acceptable.
i. Architecture Design Chart:
An update was provided to the Architecture Design Chart including diagrams and
charts describing workflow, general structure, available utilities and assay and
instrumentation control/management from beginning of an assay run to data analysis
to result output. This appears to be acceptable.
j. Unresolved Anomalies (UA):
An update was provided to the Unresolved Anomalies. One unresolved anomaly was
identified that can have a minimal impact on the pre-production process, but cannot
impact the released version of the software for the FilmArray RP EZ. Therefore, the
statement and documentation appear to be acceptable.

k. Instrument User Manual:
BioFire Diagnostics, LLC provided a copy of the FilmArray 2.0 EZ Configuration
Operators Manual. The submitted instrumentation labeling appears to be acceptable.
3. Specimen Identification:
User enters Patient ID/Sample ID by typing it in.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Not Applicable
5. Calibration:
Not required.
6. Quality Control:
Quality control is addressed for each specific FDA-cleared assay to be run on the
instrument (separately cleared).
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not applicable.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
