H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The ACCU NEWS Drug Screening Test Card and Urine Cup are rapid lateral flow
immunoassays for the qualitative detection of Amphetamine, Cocaine, Marijuana,
Methamphetamine and Morphine in human urine. The test cut-off concentrations and the
compounds the tests are calibrated to are as follows:
Analyte Abbreviation Calibrator Cutoff
Concentration
(ng/mL)
Amphetamine AMP d-Amphetamine 1000
Cocaine COC Benzoylecgnonine 300
Methamphetamine MET d-Methamphetamine 1000
Morphine MOP Morphine 300
Marijuana THC 11-Nor-∆9-THC-9- 50
COOH
The ACCU NEWS Drug Screening Test Card and Urine Cup provide only a preliminary
analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to
obtain a confirmed analytical result. Chromatography/mass spectrometry is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied
to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.
This test is intended for over-the-counter (OTC) consumer use as the first step in a two-
step process to provide consumers, with information concerning the presence or absence
of the above stated drugs or their metabolites in a urine sample. Information regarding
confirmatory testing, the second step in the process, is provided in the package labeling.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable, these are are visually-read single-use devices.
I. Device Description:
These devices are for use with human urine only. The device is available in two different
formats, 1) test card and 2) urine cup. They consist of:

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI EP07-A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline-Second
Edition
L. Test Principle:
The ACCU NEWS Drug Screening Test Card and ACCU NEWS Urine Cup test devices are
rapid lateral flow immunoassays in which drug-protein conjugates in the device compete
with drugs or drug metabolites that may be present in urine. On each test strip, a drug-protein
conjugate is present in the test band of the membrane (known as the test region, T), and the
anti-drug antibody-colloidal gold conjugate pads are at the forward end of the membrane. If
target drugs are present in the urine specimen below its cut-off concentration, the solution of
the colored antibody-gold conjugates then complexes with the drug-protein conjugates to
form visible lines. Therefore, the formation of the visible line in the test band indicates a
negative result. If the target drug level exceeds its cut-off concentration, the drug/metabolite
competes with drug-protein conjugates on the test and region for the limited antibody on the
colored drug antibody-colloidal gold conjugate pad. The drug will saturate the limited
antibody binding sites and the colored drug antibody-colloidal gold conjugate cannot bind to
the drug-protein conjugate at the test region of the test strip. Therefore, absence of the color
band on the test region indicates a preliminary positive result. A band should form in the
control region (C) of the devices regardless of the presence of drug in the sample to indicate
that the test has been performed properly.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision performance of the test strips of the devices was evaluated using 3 lots
of testing devices conducted by 3 operators. Urine samples were spiked with
different drug concentrations: negative, -50%, -25%, cut-off, +25%, and +50% of cut-
off concentrations. The drug concentrations in the urine sample were confirmed by
GC/MS analysis. Samples were blind-labeled and randomly distributed among
operators. The study was conducted over 4 to 10 days. The results are summarized
below:Results for Test Card:

The sponsor tested the effects of varying pH and specific gravity on drug positive and
negative urine. The pH and specific gravity-adjusted urine samples were found not to
interfere with the tests at pH range from 3.0 to 9.0 and specific gravity range from
1.001 to 1.040.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration is described in the precision section, M.1.a., above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor performed the method comparison study by comparing the performance
of the devices to GC/MS results. A total of 340 clinical urine samples were
distributed and tested across three sites with two operators at each site. Urine
samples were blind-labeled for the testing and drug concentrations were determined
by GC/MS. Results are summarized below:

Not applicable. This device is for use with urine samples only.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The sponsor conducted a study with 300 untrained lay users. A total of 175 males
and 125 females from ages of 18 to 47 with a variety of educational background
participated in the study at 3 sites. The blind-labeled urine samples were spiked to the
following concentrations with 2-5 drugs: negative; 50%, 75%, 125%, 150%, and
200%.
Each lay-user received one test card and one urine cup to test. For each device format
(card and cup), a lay-user received a package insert, one blind labeled aliquot, and
one device. Each blind-labeled urine sample was tested only once with each device
