L. Test Principle:
The test is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary
action. A blood sample is drawn into the test strip by capillary action, and reacts with
reagents (glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger) on the test strip. This reaction produces an
electrical current which is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the samples. The
electrical current is measured by the meter and is displayed to the user as a corresponding
blood glucose concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The Prodigy Astro Blood Glucose Monitoring System and the Prodigy Astro PRO Blood
Glucose Monitoring System differ only in name and intended use (single- vs. multiple-
patient use). Therefore, one set of performance data is appropriate to support both the
systems. All performance studies provided here is representative performance from one of
the two candidate devices.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed within-run precision studies using venous whole blood
samples spiked to five different glucose concentration levels (30 to 50, 51 to 110, 111
to 150, 151 to 250, 251 to 400 mg/dL). Each glucose concentration level was
analyzed in replicates of 10, with 3 test strip lots and 10 meters, for a total of 300 tests
per each glucose level for 10 meter. Results are summarized below:

reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer)). Ten strips from each lot were used for
testing at each glucose concentration for a total of n=30 tests per glucose
concentration. The evaluation yielded the following regression equation based on all
samples:
Lot Slope y-intercept R2

2 1.0054 -1.352 0.9996
3 0.9942 0.5085 0.9999
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 20-
600 mg/dL. The meter displays “Lo” with glucose values below 20mg/dL, and “HI”
with glucose values over 600 mg/dL. The “Lo” and “Hi” functions were validated
and demonstrated to function as intended.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected valu es (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The system is traceable to the NIST SRM #917c glucose reference material The
method comparison study was performed using the candidate device and YSI as the
reference method (see Section 2.a. above).
Control Solution Value Assignment and Stability:
Prodigy Control Solutions were previously cleared in k122338.
Stability and value assignment protocols and acceptance criteria for the two levels of
control solutions (level 1 and level 2) were evaluated and found to be acceptable in
k122338 to support the labeled claims: closed-vial stability of 24 months at 39-86°F
and open-vial stability of 90 days when stored at the recommended storage
temperature (39-86°F) or until the expiration date printed on the label, whichever
comes first.
Test Strip Stability:
Stability protocols and acceptance criteria for the Prodigy No/Prodigy PRO No
Coding Test Strips were evaluated in k122338 and found to be acceptable to support
closed-vial stability of 24 months and open-vial stability of 90 days when test strips
are stored at 39.2-104°F and 10-85% relative humidity or until the expiration date
printed on the label, whichever comes first. The labeling instructs the users not to
freeze the test strips.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study in Section M1b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by spiking endogenous and exogenous
substances into venous whole blood. Each potential interferent was tested at three

glucose levels (approximately 81.5, 245, and 445 mg/dL). Fifteen replicates were
measured for each test sample. Results of test samples with the potential interferent
measured on the Prodigy Astro Blood Glucose Meter System were compared to
samples measured on a laboratory-based reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer) and
bias and percent bias were calculated. This procedure was performed for three test
strip lots using five meters. The compounds at the concentrations listed below did not
have significant interference (defined by the sponsor as percent bias ≤ ±10%):

• Do not use the PRODIGY Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose System during or
after a Xylose Absorption Test. This may falsely raise glucose results. Please
check with your Doctor before using the PRODIGY Self-Monitoring Blood
Glucose System.
• The system exhibits interference from Acetaminophen, ascorbic acid and
Ibuprofen. If you are taking acetaminophen containing drugs (Tylenol, etc.,

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To assess system accuracy, results from the Prodigy Astro Blood Glucose Monitoring
System were compared to a reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer). Venous samples
and capillary samples from fingerstick, forearm, palm, upper arm, calf and thigh were
obtained by professional users from 100 participants with glucose concentrations
ranging from 50.9 to 415 mg/dL. To obtain extreme blood glucose concentrations,
six samples were altered. The meter results relative to YSI are summarized below:

User Performance study:
To assess the performance of the Prodigy Astro Blood Glucose Monitoring System in
the hands of the intended users, the sponsor performed a study with 103 lay user
participants who collected and tested samples from their own fingertip, palm,
forearm, upper arm, calf and thigh. Results were analyzed by comparing blood
glucose results obtained by the lay users with the Prodigy Astro Blood Glucose
Monitoring System against results obtained using a laboratory reference method (YSI
2300 analyzer). The glucose concentrations in the samples ranged from
approximately 55.8 to 403 mg/dL as measured by the laboratory reference method.
Results are summarized in the tables below:

Calibration is automatic. There is no user input for coding.
6. Quality Control:
Two levels of aqueous glucose control solutions are available (sold separately) for use
with this system. Instructions on how to order the control solutions are included in the
user manual. The meter has a function for the user to select that they wish to run a
control solution to prevent control results from being stored in the internal memory as
patient results. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in
the labeling. The control solution readings are not included in the average of the patient
results when the measurements are performed in the “control solution mode”. An
acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is
cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study: To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the Prodigy Astro Blood
Glucose Monitoring System, venous blood samples were adjusted to hematocrit levels of
15 %, 20 %, 30 %, 42 %, 60 % and 65 %. Each hematocrit level was tested at five
glucose concentration intervals (30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250, 251-400 mg/dL) for a
total of 30 samples. Results from the meter were compared to results obtained using a
laboratory-based reference measurement (YSI 2300 analyzer). The evaluation of percent
bias relative to values obtained on the YSI 2300 analyzer demonstrated acceptable
performance across the claimed hematocrit range of 20-60%.
2. Altitude study: To evaluate the effect of altitude on the Prodigy Astro Blood Glucose
Monitoring System, meters were tested at six altitudes above sea level (298 ft; 2,920 ft;
4,790 ft; 6,234 ft; 8,563ft and 11,161 ft). Five glucose levels (43.5, 82.0, 130, 198, and
316 mg/dL) were tested at each altitude. The evaluation included testing each sample
with three strip lots and three sets of meters. Each lot included 10 replicates for a total of
30 replicates per glucose level/altitude combination. Results were compared to results
obtained using a laboratory-based reference measurement (YSI 2300 analyzer) and
demonstrated that altitudes up to 11,000 feet above sea level have no significant effect on
blood glucose measurements.
3. Sample Volume: To verify the minimum sample volume requirement, venous whole
blood samples with volumes ranging from 0.5 -1.5 μL were tested. Sample
concentrations included five glucose levels (40.3, 76.6, 111.9, 176.6, and 340.7 mg/dL)
tested at each volume. Testing included ten meters and ten strips from each of three lots
for each glucose concentration/sample volume combination for a total of 30
measurements per volume/glucose level combination. Values obtained were compared to
values obtained using a laboratory-based reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer). Results
support a minimum sample volume of 0.7 μL for the Prodigy Astro/Prodigy Astro PRO
blood glucose monitoring systems.

4. Temperature and humidity studies: To evaluate system performance under the extremes
of the recommended temperature and humidity conditions, sample testing was performed
at temperatures of 50, 77, and 104ºF, and R.H. of 10 and 85 %; each temperature was
tested at both R.H. conditions using venous whole blood at glucose concentrations 49,
149, and 319 mg/dL. The evaluation included ten Prodigy Astro meters, and three strip
lots with a total of 30 replicates per glucose level/environmental condition combination.
The results obtained on the Prodigy Astro blood glucose monitoring system were
compared to those obtained on the YSI 2300, and support the operating conditions of
temperatures of 50 - 104ºF (10-40ºC) and RH of 10-85%.
5. Infection Control and Robustness Studies: The Prodigy Astro Blood Glucose Monitoring
System is intended for single-patient use and the Prodigy Astro Pro Blood Glucose
Monitoring System is intended for multiple-patient use in clinical settings. Disinfection
efficacy testing on the surface materials of the meter demonstrated complete inactivation
of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, PDI SUPER SANI-CLOTH
germicidal disposable wipes (EPA Registration # 9480-4). Robustness studies were also
performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or
external materials of the meter after: 1) 520 cleaning and disinfection cycles (a total of
1040 wipes) designed to simulate 3 years of single-patient use for the Prodigy Astro
Blood Glucose Monitoring System, and 2) 10,950 cleaning and disinfection cycles (a
total of 21,900 wipes) designed to simulate three years of multiple-patient device use for
the Prodigy Astro Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Labeling was reviewed for
adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
6. The sponsor provided appropriate documentation certifying that electromagnetic (EMC)
testing was performed and the Prodigy Astro/Prodigy Astro Pro Blood Glucose
Monitoring Systems were found to be compliant.
7. Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted on all labeling and demonstrated
that the User Manuals for the Prodigy Astro and Prodigy Astro Pro BGMS are written at
an 8th grade level or below.
8. The meter manual states that customer service is available (Mon-Fri, 9AM to 5PM EST)
by calling 1-800-243-2636.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
