--- Page 2 ---
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test is an in vitro diagnostic for the
detection and genotyping of the *2 and *3 alleles of the cytochrome P450
(CYP450) 2C9 gene locus and the Vitamin K epoxide reductase C1 (VKORC1)
gene promoter polymorphism (-1639G>A) from genomic DNA extracted from
human saliva samples collected using the Oragene®•Dx and ORAcollect®·Dx
devices, as an aid in the identification of patients at risk for increased warfarin
sensitivity.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
Samples for this test should only be collected with the Oragene•Dx collection
devices cleared under k110701, k152556, and k152464: models OCD-100, OCD-
100A, OGD-500, OGD-510, OGD-575, OGD-600, OGD-610, OGD-675, OXD-
525, and OYD-500
4. Special instrument requirements:
eSensor® XT-8 Instrument (cleared with the test system under k073720)
I. Device Description:
The kit consists of the eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test cartridge, the eSensor®
Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test amplification reagents (including PCR mix and DNA
polymerase), the eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test detection reagents (including
exonuclease, probes and hybridization buffer ingredients) and the eSensor® XT-8
System. One eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test Kit has sufficient materials for
24 tests.
The eSensor® XT-8 System uses a solid-phase electrochemical method for determining
the genotype of a defined panel of polymorphisms. The genotype of each polymorphism
is determined by voltammetry, which generates specific electrical signals from the allele-
specific signal probes.

method was cleared under k073720 using genomic DNA from blood as the sample
type. In the process, regions of the genome containing the polymorphisms of interest
are amplified by PCR, and the resulting double stranded PCR amplicons are digested
with exonuclease lambda to generate single stranded target DNA which is then mixed
with a hybridization solution containing a pair of allele-specific oligonucleotide
signal probes for each polymorphism. Each signal probe within the pair is labeled
with a genotype-specific ferrocene derivative.
The mixture of amplified target DNA sample and signal buffer is loaded onto a test
cartridge containing single-stranded oligonucleotide capture probes that are
covalently bound to gold-plated electrodes. The cartridge is then inserted into the XT-
8 Instrument. During the hybridization in the XT-8 Instrument, each target DNA
binds to a capture probe. Each pair of working electrodes on the array contains a
different capture probe.
The signal and capture probes are designed with sequences complementary to
immediately adjacent regions on the corresponding target DNA sequence and so both
signal and capture probes bind to complementary sequences on the target DNA. In
this manner, a three-member complex is formed among capture probe, target, and
signal probe based on sequence-specific hybridization. This process brings the end of
the signal probe containing electrochemically active ferrocene labels into close
proximity to the electrode surface.
Hybridization of the three-member complex at the electrode surface and subsequent
application of an excitation voltage causes the ferrous ion in each ferrocene group to
undergo cyclic oxidation and reduction at its characteristic redox potential, leading to
loss or gain of an electron, and the generation of an alternating current at the electrode
surface that is measured using voltammetry. Higher-order harmonic signal analysis
also facilitates discrimination of ferrocene-dependent faradaic current from
background capacitive current. Signals from the ferrocene labels are detected and
measured by instrument software, and the ratio of signals from the different labels
allows identification of genotype. Genotyping boundaries and signal threshold for
each polymorphism are pre-programmed into instrument software, and genotypes are
called by comparison of the signal ratio observed for an unknown sample to the SNP-
specific genotyping boundaries and signal threshold. Sequential analysis of each
electrode allows genotyping of multiple mutations or polymorphisms.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three reproducibility studies were performed as part of the clearance of
k152464 and referenced to support this clearance.
An additional reproducibility study was conducted by Genmark to establish
the DNA collection with the new tube type in k152556. Three samples
(collected using three lots of Oragene•Dx format OGD-500) from each of ten

donors, covering all possible genotypes of CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, and
VKORC1, were tested in triplicate by four different operators at three
different sites. Each operator extracted DNA from each sample using the
QIAamp mini kit alcohol precipitation method, followed by determination of
DNA concentration and A260/A280 ratio for all samples by an independent
operator at one of the sites. Four operators at three sites tested the extracted
DNA samples on the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Test. Genotyping data was
evaluated after one run, and also after re-testing. First run failures were a
result of five no-call results, one incorrect call, and two invalidated runs (46
samples) due to failure of the negative control. There was 100% agreement
between the eSensor results and DNA sequencing in the second run.
