mechanisms. The Xpert Carba-R Assay should be used in conjunction with other
laboratory tests including phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The Xpert
Carba-R Assay is intended as an aid for infection control in detecting and differentiating
genetic markers of resistance to monitor the spread of carbapenem-non-susceptible
organisms in healthcare settings. The Xpert Carba-R Assay is not intended to guide or
monitor treatment for carbapenem-non-susceptible bacterial infections.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as the Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
Organisms should be identified and carbapenem non-susceptibility status should be
determined prior to testing with the Xpert Carba-R Assay.
The Xpert Carba-R Assay detects bla , bla , bla , bla , and bla from pure
KPC NDM VIM OXA-48 IMP
colonies and is not for bacterial identification.
The performance of the Xpert Carba-R Assay with bacteria other than
Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii has not been
evaluated.

4. Special instrument requirements:
The Xpert Carba-R Assay uses PCR technology on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems,
which extract, amplify, and detect the target DNA.
I. Device Description:
The Xpert Carba-R Assay is an automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in
vitro diagnostic test for qualitative detection of the bla , bla , bla , bla , and
KPC NDM VIM OXA-48
bla gene sequences from pure colonies of carbapenem non-susceptible
IMP
Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. The Xpert
Carba-R Assay is intended as an aid for infection control to monitor the spread of
carbapenem-non-susceptible organisms in healthcare settings. The assay is performed on the
Cepheid GeneXpert Instrument Systems (GeneXpert Dx, GeneXpert Infinity-48, GeneXpert
Infinity-48s, and GeneXpert Infinity-80 systems). The GeneXpert Instrument Systems utilize
single-use, disposable cartridges (Xpert Carba-R cartridges) containing PCR reagents and
allows for automated sample preparation, amplification, and real-time detection of gene
targets in approximately 50 minutes. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check
Control (PCC) have been incorporated into the assay design to address key failure modes that
could result in a false negative determination.
The GeneXpert Instrument Systems (GeneXpert Dx Systems and the GeneXpert Infinity
Systems) have 1 to 80 randomly accessible modules, depending upon the instrument, that are
each capable of performing separate sample processing and real-time PCR and RT-PCR
tests. Because the cartridges are self-contained and specimens never come into contact with
working parts of the instrument modules, cross-contamination between samples is
minimized.

L. Test Principle:
The Xpert Carba-R Assay cartridges contain reagents for the detection of bla , bla ,
KPC NDM
bla , bla , and bla gene sequences from isolates of pure cultures of carbapenem-
VIM OXA-48 IMP
non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter
baumannii. The bacterial isolates from culture are tested using a loopful of organism
(equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland suspension) resuspended in 5 ml of Sample Reagent. The
sample is vortexed then transferred (1.7 ml) to the sample chamber of a disposable Xpert
Carba-R Assay cartridge. The user initiates a test from the system-user interface and places
the cartridge into the GeneXpert instrument platform, which performs hands-off real-time,
multiplex PCR for detection of target sequences.
Results of the assay run are interpreted by the GeneXpert Instrument System software from
measured fluorescent signals and embedded calculation algorithms. The results are
automatically generated at the end of the process in a report that can be viewed and printed.
Basic users see test results reported as “red” highlighted for DETECTED results and
“green” highlighted for NOT DETECTED results. Additional results that can be reported
include: INVALID, ERROR, and NO RESULT.
Interpretation of Results
The Xpert Carba-R Assay provides test results for the IMP, VIM, NDM, KPC, and OXA-48
target DNA sequences. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control
(PCC) have been designed for the assay as internal controls to enable the GeneXpert
Instrument System to detect specific failure modes related to assay performance. The PCC is
considered to PASS if the fluorescence generated meets the validated acceptance criteria. If
the PCC fails for any of the IMP, VIM, NDM, KPC, and OXA-48 targets, or SPC target, a
probe check error is reported and the test will not continue. The assay also reports if the test
has an INVALID, ERROR or NO RESULT. Under these conditions, the test will need to be
repeated using a new sample, a new cartridge, and/or new reagents. Retest procedures are
described in the Xpert Carba-R package insert. An interpretation table for test results is
shown in Table 1.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the Xpert Carba-R Assay was established in a multi-center
study. A panel of 13 bacterial samples included the following: 1) two different
organisms for each of the five resistance genes detected by the Xpert Carba-R Assay,
2) two different organisms that harbored two gene targets, and 3) one organism
negative for all five gene targets. A 0.5 McFarland equivalent of bacterial cell
suspension was prepared for each sample. To measure site-to-site reproducibility, the
(13)-member panel was tested in replicates of four each day at three (3) sites over a
six day testing period. Three lots of Xpert Carba-R Assay cartridges were used at
each testing site. A total of 1872 samples consisting of 144 replicates for the 13

different panel members were tested for the study using two operators at each site.
Twenty-five (25) test runs from one instrument module were excluded, resulting in
1847 test runs included in the analyses. For the Xpert Carba-R Assay, 99.4%
(1836/1847) of samples were successful and produced the expected result on the first
attempt. Six (6) ERROR cases, two (2) INVALID results, and three (3) NO RESULT
outcomes were reported. All eleven samples yielded valid results upon repeat testing.

External Negative Control—Inactivated E. coli containing a plasmid with no
resistance gene inserted.
Internal Control (IC) Reaction Analysis
Internal controls enable the system to detect specific failure modes that could
potentially result in an incorrect test result. Each Xpert Carba-R Assay includes a
Sample Processing Control (SPC) and Probe Check Control (PCC) pre-loaded in the
cartridge and provided with the assay.
Sample Processing Control (SPC)
The SPC contains genomic DNA of Bacillus globigii that is included in each
cartridge to verify adequate processing of the sample. The SPC verifies that lysis
of bacteria has occurred if the organisms are present and verifies the effectiveness
of each sample preparation step—reaction tube filling, reaction components are
present and functioning, and monitoring for the presence of potential inhibitor(s)
in the PCR assay. Test results are reported as INVALID if the SPC fails to meet
the valid minimum or maximum Ct specification (range 3.0 to 40.0 Ct).
Probe Check control (PCC)
The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, real-time PCR tube filling in the cartridge,
probe integrity, and dye stability. The PCC is considered to PASS if the
fluorescence generated meets the validated acceptance criteria. If the PCC fails
for any of the IMP, VIM, NDM, KPC, and OXA-48 targets or SPC target, a probe
check error is reported and the test will not continue. If a probe check error is
reported, the test may be repeated using a new sample, new cartridge, and new
reagents.
Stability Studies
The objectives of the Xpert Carba-R Assay Stability and Shipping Study were to: 1)
evaluate the shelf-life of the Xpert Carba-R Assay, 2) determine the open package
stability to support claimed temperature/time limits for the assay, and 3) determine
shipping stability for the assay.
Shelf-life and Expiration Dating Study
Three lots of the Xpert Carba-R Assay are being evaluated for stability at four
temperatures and predefined time point intervals. Each Xpert Carba-R lot has
been tested with samples containing high and low levels of target strains and with
a negative sample type (an organism that is not detectable by the assay). Analysis
of lot performance was based on the studies of the Cts for IMP, VIM, NDM,
KPC, and OXA-48 targets from both low and high positive samples, as well as the
SPC target from negative samples. Currently, six months of real-time data are
available for the three stability lots. Real-time stability studies for determining
shelf-life and expiration dating are ongoing. The storage temperature range for the
Xpert Carba-R Assay is 2°C - 28°C.

Shipping Stability
The purpose of the shipping stability study was to validate the ability of the
packaging systems to protect the Xpert Carba-R Assay test kits during transport.
Kits were subjected to transport simulation conditions under pre-defined
temperatures and humidity conditions. Packages were inspected and functional
testing performed to establish shipped sample performance. The Xpert Carba-R
Assay packaging was determined to be adequate in protecting the product from
damage. Product performance testing was conducted on one assay lot.
Sample Stability
A study was conducted to establish the sample stability of carbapenem-non-
susceptible bacterial isolates seeded into Xpert Carba-R Assay Sample Reagent.
Table 4 shows the one negative and five positive bacterial strains tested. The five
positive organisms comprised of carbapenemase-producing bacteria harboring
each of the gene targets detected by the Xpert Carba-R Assay. The study was
performed first by sub-culturing the bacteria onto blood agar plates and placing a
meropenem disc in the first streak quadrant of each plate as a means to ensure that
the bacterial isolate retained its non-susceptibility to carbapenem. The agar plates
were incubated at 35°C for 18-24 hours. A bacterial suspension equivalent to a
0.5 McFarland suspension was prepared in tryptic soy broth for each plate. An
aliquot of bacterial suspension was mixed with Sample Reagent and tested with
the Xpert Carba-R Assay at t=0 day. One sample test volume in Sample Reagent
was stored at 4°C for up to 8 days and tested on those days with the Xpert Carba-
R Assay. A second test volume was stored at 30°C for up to 8 days and similarly
tested. A negative control consisting of a 0.5 McFarland suspension of a
carbapenem non-susceptible organism (that did not produce carbapenemase) was
also prepared and tested.

All positive and negative samples tested at each storage condition/temperature
were correctly identified using the Xpert Carba-R Assay. The data supports that
carbapenem non-susceptible bacterial isolate cells are stable in Xpert Carba-R
Sample Reagent for up to 8 days when stored at 4°C – 30°C prior to testing with
the Xpert Carba-R Assay. Therefore, the study supports storage claim of 2–28°C
for up to 96 hours in Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent for carbapenem non-
susceptible bacterial isolates.
All external positive and negative controls gave the expected GeneXpert test
result. Data for this study was collected using GeneXpert Dx software version

Cartridge Hold Time Study
Samples prepared for testing with the Xpert Carba-R Assay and the GeneXpert
Infinity System may not be available for testing for up to two hours after the
cartridge is loaded onto the System (in a multiple-module system). In order to
assess the stability of cartridge storage times, one lot of the Xpert Carba-R Assay
was subjected to a sample hold time study where the sample was added to
cartridges, held at three storage conditions (room temperature, 25°C/75% relative
humidity, and 35°C), and processed at scheduled time intervals ranging from 0-5
hours. Positive and negative samples were tested under all storage conditions as a
panel with 4 negative and 14 positive samples. Two types of external positive
controls were employed in the study—multivalent external positive control and
monovalent positive controls. Acceptable performance was observed for up to
five hours of hold time between sample addition and cartridge processing for
positive and negative samples under all conditions tested. The maximum hold
time recommended from sample addition to the Xpert Carba-R Assay cartridges
to processing on the GeneXpert Infinity System is 4.5 hours. All external positive
and negative controls gave the expected GeneXpert test result.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical reactivity:
An inclusivity study was conducted to test reactivity of the Xpert Carba-R Assay with
a 71-member panel (See Table 5) of well-characterized bacterial isolates that included
the following molecular resistance marker groups and representative sub-groups: (11)
bla isolates, (13) bla isolates, (11) bla isolates, (8) bla isolates, (5) bla
KPC NDM VIM OXA-48
isolates, (5) bla , (17) bla isolates, and (1) bla isolate. The
NDM/OXA-181 OXA-181 IMP KPC/VIM
study was also used to demonstrate equivalency in growth on blood agar and
MacConkey agar plates for the detection of target genes by the Xpert Carba-R Assay.
Bacterial isolates were grown on blood agar and MacConkey agar plates and
incubated at 35°C for 18-24 hours. A meropenem disc was placed in the first streak
quadrant of each plate as a means to ensure that the bacterial isolate retained its non-
susceptibility to carbapenem. For each bacterial strain tested, a 0.5 McFarland cell
suspension was prepared in tryptic soy broth for each plate. A 10 μl loop of the
suspension was diluted in 5 ml Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent, vortexed briefly, then
duplicate 1.7 ml aliquots were tested with the Xpert Carba-R Assay. Each organism
was tested in replicates of four (4)—two replicates per agar plate.
For each day of the study, an external negative control and two types of experimental
positive controls were tested. The negative control consisted of Escherichia coli cells
containing a plasmid with no resistance gene sequence. The two types of external
positive controls employed in the study included:
12

--- Page 13 ---
• multivalent external positive control (containing all five gene targets)
• two monovalent positive controls (containing individual carbapenemase-
producing bacteria, each harboring only one of the Xpert Carba-R target
carbapenemase genes on a rotating basis).
On each testing day, one negative control, the five-gene construct positive control,
and two of five individual bacterial controls (single gene target) were tested.

All organisms tested exhibited adequate growth on both blood agar and MacConkey
agar plates. Xpert Carba-R Assay target genes were detected in 68 of the 71 bacterial
strains with the Xpert Carba-R Assay. Target sequences were not detected in three
strains (Table 6). One replicate sample for one of the (12) KPC-containing strains
reported an indeterminate result (INVALID). The sample was successfully repeated
and was correctly reported as “KPC DETECTED.”

aIMP-7 and IMP-14 genes (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were not detected by the assay and were not predicted to be
detected by in silico analysis (Limitation in package insert).
bIMP-13 gene (Klebsiella pneumoniae): although predicted to be detected by in silico analysis, the IMP-13 gene
was not detected by the assay (Limitation in package insert).
f. Analytical specificity:
The Xpert Carba-R Assay was examined for analytical specificity by testing a panel
of 62 well-characterized carbapenem-susceptible bacteria or bacteria with
carbapenem non-susceptibility due to genes or mechanisms other than the Xpert
Carba-R target genes. Twenty-four commensal/enteric microorganisms were also
evaluated in the study. All organisms were grown aerobically on blood agar and
MacConkey agar plates. Bacterial suspensions tested were equivalent to a 0.5
McFarland cell suspension. A 100 μl aliquot of each suspension was diluted into 5 ml
Sample Reagent to a final concentration of >1 x 106 CFU/ml. Each organism was
tested a total of four times (from each type of plate). Table 7 and Table 8 list the
organisms tested during the Analytical Specificity Study.

Of the 86 potentially cross-reactive organisms tested, including organisms exhibiting
antibiotic resistance mechanisms other than production of KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP
and OXA-48, none were detected with the Xpert Carba-R Assay. Four runs were
indeterminate [(1) NO RESULT and (3) INVALID)]. All four indeterminate runs were
successfully repeated and were reported as NOT DETECTED for all five targets. All
data were collected on the GeneXpert Dx (GX-IV) instrument using GeneXpert Dx
software version 4.4a.
For each day of the study, an external negative control and two types of experimental
positive controls were tested as described in the Analytical Reactivity Study above.
g. Interfering substances:
Not Applicable
h. Carry-over:
The purpose of the Carry-over Study was to determine the carry-over rate of
contamination in negative samples due to the nucleic acid extraction and
amplification of high positive samples in the GeneXpert cartridge. In this study, a
negative sample was tested in a GeneXpert module on a GeneXpert Dx GX-IV
instrument immediately following the testing of a high titer positive sample (1 x 106
CFU/ml) in the same GeneXpert module. Negative samples consisted of inactivated
E. coli cells without target sequences diluted in Sample Reagent to 1 x 105 CFU/ml.
The positive sample was composed of inactivated E. coli cells (with plasmid
containing all five Xpert Carba-R target analyte genes—KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP and
OXA-48 targets) diluted in Sample Reagent. After an initial negative sample test,
sample testing proceeded by alternating negative and high positive sample runs a total
of 50 times for two GeneXpert modules. For each day of the study, an external
negative control and two types of experimental positive controls were tested as
described in the Analytical Reactivity Study. There were 102 total runs where all 50
high positive samples were correctly reported as DETECTED for all five Xpert
Carba-R Assay targets. All 52 negative samples reported NOT DETECTED results for
all five Xpert Carba-R Assay targets as expected. There were no errors or invalid
results reported. Study results indicated no evidence of sample or amplicon carry-over
contamination in the GeneXpert Dx GX-IV modules.
i. Assay cut-off:
Optimized lot specific parameters (LSP) and assay settings for the Xpert Carba-R
Assay were determined using pre-clinical data. The pre-clinical study was conducted
using patient rectal swabs to determine the performance of the Xpert Carba-R Assay

relative to reference DNA sequence analysis of organisms growing on agar media that
were non-susceptible to at least one carbapenem. Contrived samples, prepared by
seeding carbapenemase-producing bacteria into stool matrix, were also tested with the
Xpert Carba-R Assay. Pre-clinical study sensitivity and specificity values for
different Ct cut-offs were evaluated for both prospective and contrived samples.
For IMP, VIM, NDM, KPC, and OXA-48 gene targets, the valid cycle threshold (Ct)
range was 3.0 to 38.0. For the SPC, the valid Ct range was set from 3.0 to 40.0. A Ct
value outside the valid range is reported as NOT DETECTED. The Ct cut-offs are
included as automatic calculations in the assay definition file (ADF) provided with
the Xpert Carba-R Assay. The lot specific parameters and assay settings described
were confirmed in the clinical study, and clinical study results indicated that the cut-
off values selected for detection of the five carbapenemase gene targets yielded
acceptable performance.

b. Matrix comparison:

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
In a multi-center study, performance of the Xpert Carba-R Assay was evaluated with
bacterial isolates grown from both blood agar and MacConkey agar relative to
reference DNA amplification of the target DNA followed by bi-directional
sequencing. Testing was performed from growth of the isolate on blood agar. To
include isolates in the study, organism identification must have been determined prior
to testing with the Xpert Carba-R Assay in order to confirm that isolates belonged to
the Enterobacteriaceae family or were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or
Acinetobacter baumannii. Organism susceptibility status (susceptible, intermediate or
resistant) to meropenem, ertapenem and/or imipenem was determined using CLSI
standard test methods (M07-A9) and the interpretive criteria found in the FDA drug
label and CLSI M100-S24.
For reference DNA amplification followed by sequencing, DNA from culture isolates
was purified, quantified, and amplified using primers specific to all 5 target that
amplified larger regions than the assay targets. Amplicons of the appropriate size
were confirmed on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and sent for reference bi-directional
sequencing analysis.

For Xpert Carba-R Assay testing, well-isolated colonies that grew on each of the agar
types were diluted to a 0.5 McFarland standard equivalent suspension using the direct
colony suspension method. If discordant results between the Xpert Carba-R Assay
and reference (DNA amplification and sequencing) were observed, discrepant testing
was performed using bi-directional sequencing on isolates from MacConkey agar
plates. All sites performing Xpert Carba-R Assay testing used GeneXpert Dx
instruments with GeneXpert Dx System software version 4.3.
Calculations of sensitivity and specificity took into account the ability of the Xpert
Carba-R Assay to report the presence or absence of target genes in the pool of test
isolates. Because carbapenem non-susceptibilty can be due to mechanisms other than
the presence of Xpert Carba-R target DNA sequences, results from all non-
susceptible isolates may not coincide with the presence of target genes by the Xpert
Carba-R Assay and may be included in the specificity calculation. In general,
Enterobacteriaceae isolates included in sensitivity calculations were determined to be
either intermediate or resistant to meropenem, ertapenem and/or imipenem per FDA
drug label and CLSI M100-S24. Isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or
Acinetobacter baumannii must have been determined to be intermediate or resistant
to either imipenem or meropenem (these organisms are known to be resistant to
ertapenem). In specificity calculations, Enterobacteriaceae isolates may have been
determined to be susceptible or intermediate/resistant to meropenem, ertapenem, and
imipenem per FDA drug label and CLSI M100-S24. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
Acinetobacter baumannii isolates should have been susceptible to both imipenem and
meropenem.
A total of 489 bacterial isolates (431 clinical stock isolates and 58 fresh isolates) were
enrolled in the clinical study across four clinical sites. Four isolates that had been
previously enrolled were excluded from the study, and two isolates were excluded
because reference method testing was not performed. An additional sixteen samples
were excluded because organisms were not identified as Enterobacteriaceae,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Acinetobacter baumannii. Thus, 467 compliant samples
remained in the final analysis.
Isolates grown on both blood agar and MacConkey agar were evaluated with the
Xpert Carba-R Assay for a total of 934 runs (467 each from blood agar and
McConkey agar). Performance of the Xpert Carba-R Assay was assessed separately
for each type of agar, resistance marker target, and overall (all 5 targets combined)
relative to reference sequencing for each of the two agar types used to grow isolates.
The study showed that 99.9% (933/934) of isolates yielded results on the first run.
One isolate resulted in a NO RESULT outcome upon initial testing, but yielded a
result upon repeat testing. The final invalid rate was reported as 0%.
When tested with isolates from blood agar, the Xpert Carba-R Assay demonstrated an
overall sensitivity and specificity of 100% (95% CI: 99.0-100) and 98.1% (95% CI:
93.2-99.5), respectively, relative to the reference method performed from isolates
grown on blood agar plates. Similar results were reported for isolates grown on
21

MacConkey agar, where the Xpert Carba-R Assay demonstrated an overall sensitivity
and specificity of 100% (95% CI: 99.0-100) and 97.1% (95% CI: 91.8-99.0),
respectively. The combined performance was evaluated based on defining a result as
positive for the Xpert Carba-R Assay if any of the targets were positive and negative
for the assay if all the targets were negative.
Combined performance, performance by target, and performance by organism group
for the Xpert Carba-R Assay with isolates grown on blood agar and MacConkey agar
are shown in Table 9 (Combined Performance), Table 10 (Individual Targets), and
Table 11 (Organism Group) below.

abi-directional DNA sequencing result for this false positive IMP isolate exhibited 92.95% sequence
homology which was slightly below the 95% cut-off criteria. Discrepant testing was not performed.
bDiscrepant testing results: 1 of 1 was VIM positive.
cThis false positive sample was investigated and may be due to KPC cross-contamination at the level of
sample preparation. Discrepant testing did not produce a sequence match with the KPC target. Discrepant
testing produced a sequence match for the VIM target. This isolate was classified as a TP in the overall
assessment presented in Table 9 above.
dThe clinical site reported that in-house characterization of this false positive isolate prior to study testing
resulted in a positive NDM gene target. Discrepant testing did not produce a sequence match for any of the
5 gene targets.

sample positive for all (5) targets of the assay, and five different positive controls
each containing a single target of the assay. The negative control and five-target
positive controls were run on each day that study samples were tested, along with two
of the single-target positive controls (on a rotating basis). Study samples were not run
until correct results were obtained for each of the four controls. External control data

A bacterial suspension equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland suspension is prepared and a 10 μl
loop of suspension is transferred to 5 ml of Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent. An aliquot of
sample (1.7 ml) is then transferred to the sample chamber of the disposable, single-use
fluidic cartridge (Xpert Carba-R cartridge). The user initiates a test from the system user
interface and places the cartridge into the GeneXpert Instrument System. Additional
sample preparation, amplification, and real-time detection are all fully-automated and
completed by the instrument system.
5. Calibration:
No calibration is required by the user.
6. Quality Control:
Quality control is addressed for each separately cleared assay to be run on the instrument.
See section M1(c) for information on internal and external controls.
