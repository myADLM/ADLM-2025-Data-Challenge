L. Test Principle:
The QUANTA Flash Scl-70 assay is a microparticle chemiluminescent immunoassay designed
for use on the BIO-FLASH instrument. The instrument platform is a fully automated closed
system with continuous load and random access capabilities that automatically processes the
samples, runs the assay and reports the results. It includes liquid handling hardware,
luminometer and computer with software-user interface. The QUANTA Flash Scl-70 assay
utilizes a reagent cartridge format, which is compatible with the BIO-FLASH instrument.
Purified recombinant Scl-70 antigen is coated onto paramagnetic beads. The bead suspension is
lyophilized and stored in the bead tube. Prior to use in the BIO-FLASH system, the sealed
reagent tubes are pierced with the reagent cartridge lid and the beads are reconstituted using
resuspension buffer by pipetting up and down with a transfer pipette. The reagent cartridge is
then loaded onto the BIO-FLASH instrument. Samples are also loaded onto the instrument in
sample racks. A patient serum sample is prediluted by the BIO-FLASH with system rinse in a
small disposable plastic cuvette. Small amounts of the diluted patient serum, the beads, and
assay buffer are all combined into a second cuvette, and mixed. This cuvette is then incubated at
37°C. The beads are magnetized and washed several times. Isoluminol conjugated anti-human
IgG antibodies are then added to the cuvette, and again incubated at 37°C. The beads are
magnetized and washed repeatedly. The isoluminol conjugate is oxidized when Trigger 1 and
Trigger 2 are added to the cuvette, and the flash of light produced from this reaction is measured
as Relative Light Units (RLU) by the BIO-FLASH optical system. The RLU are proportional to
the amount of isoluminol conjugate that is bound to the human IgG, which is in turn proportional
to the amount of anti-Scl-70 antibodies bound to the corresponding Scl-70 on the beads.
The QUANTA Flash Scl-70 assay utilizes a predefined lot specific Master Curve that is
uploaded into the instrument through the reagent cartridge barcode. Based on the results obtained
by running two calibrators, an instrument specific Working Curve is created, which is used by
the software to calculate chemiluminescent units (CU) from the RLU value obtained for each
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance: All results presented below were within the sponsor’s pre-
determined acceptance criteria for each study.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the QUANTA Flash Scl-70 assay was evaluated by running 13
patient samples across the assay range. Samples were run in duplicates, twice a day,
for 20 days using one reagent lot (total of 80 replicates per sample). Controls were
run as quality controls during each run. The study results are summarized in the table
below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The analytical measuring range (AMR) of the assay is defined by the LoQ and
highest points on the master curve (1.2–786.3 CU). The linearity across this range
was evaluated by a study designed according to CLSI EP6-A. Five high
concentration serum samples were serially diluted in analyte free serum. Each
dilution was tested in duplicate. The linear regression analysis with only samples
within AMR resulted in the following equation:

Auto-rerun: The auto-rerun function was validated by testing three high positive
samples (all with CU values > 786.3) with the auto-rerun feature enabled. The same
three samples were also run after being manually diluted 20 fold. The results of the
manually diluted samples were multiplied by 20, and compared with the results
obtained by the instrument with the auto-rerun feature. Obtained results were divided
by expected results (those obtained after manual dilution) to calculate percent
recovery. Recovery values were 104%, 101% and 91%, with an average of 102%
recovery.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: There is no recognized standard or reference material for anti-Scl-70
autoantibodies. The calibrator and control values are directly traceable to in-house
standards that are used to create the master curves for the QUANTA Flash Scl-70.
Value assignment: The QUANTA Flash Scl-70 Calibrators and Controls are
manufactured by diluting human serum that contains a high titer of anti-Scl-70
antibodies. The target CU is achieved through trial dilutions on small scale. Once a
dilution is selected, the Calibrators and Controls are bulked, tested, and adjusted.
Upon completion of the manufacturing process, the Calibrators and Controls are
tested on at least two instruments, on at least two lots of reagent cartridge, in
replicates of 10 to determine final value assignment. The target values and ranges for
the Calibrators and Controls are listed below:
Target Value Target Range
(CU) (CU)
QUANTA Flash Scl-70 Calibrators
Calibrator 1 13 11–15
Calibrator 2 290 261–319
QUANTA Flash Scl-70 Controls
Low control 10 8–12
High control 50 40–60
Stability:
Kit stability (unopened): The accelerated stability study was performed using three
lots of kits (with three different lots of Scl-70 coupled beads), calibrators, and
controls. Accelerated stability testing supports a claim of one year at stability for
unopened kits, calibrators and controls stored at 2–8°C. Real-time stability is on-
going; the results to date support a claim of six months stability for unopened kits,
calibrators and controls stored at 2–8°C.
On-board (In-use) stability: On-board stability study was performed for calibrators,
controls, and reagent cartridge:
i. Calibrators: Calibrators were placed uncapped, onboard the instrument, and
calibration was performed five times over 8.5 hours. Controls and a panel of
characterized patient specimens were run on each calibration curve. Each
calibrator is measured in triplicate during calibration. All calibrations were
within the acceptance criteria.
ii. Controls: Two vials of each control were assayed twice a day for a total of 20
runs. The first run was used to establish baseline value, and then an additional
19 runs were performed. During runs, the Controls were left uncapped,

onboard the instrument for 15 minutes per run. When not in use, the controls
were capped, and stored at 5ºC ± 3°C. Low and High Controls ran within their
respective acceptable range for all runs.
iii. Reagent Cartridge: Two lots of cartridges were tested with four to six serum
specimens (with different reactivity levels) along with the Negative and
Positive Controls. The specimens were tested periodically until to 60 days.
Percent recoveries were calculated compared to the day zero average values,
and linear regression analysis was performed by plotting % recovery against
the number of days.
All results met the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria and support the following
stability claim:
Calibrators 8 hours on-board; up to 4 calibrations
Controls Up to 15 uses with 10 min on-board per use
Reagent Cartridge 60 days on-board
Sample stability: The study was performed with six samples, encompassing negative,
equivocal, and low to high positive samples, tested at 2–8°C, and room temperature
(RT). In addition, the samples were tested for the stability after repeated freeze/thaw
cycles up to three cycles. The results support sample stability up to 48 hours of
storage at RT, up to 21 days of storage at 2–8°C, and up to three freeze/thaw cycles
when samples are stored at or below -20°C.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying four blank samples in five
replicates per sample over three days with two reagent lots. A total of 60 data points
per lot were generated. LoB for each lot was calculated separately at the 95th
percentile using the non-parametric method, as the dataset showed non-normal
distribution. The LoB of both two lots was below the measuring range and was
determined to be 0.02 CU and 0.05 CU. The claimed LoB value is 0.1 CU.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by assaying four low-level samples
with anti-Scl-70 antibody concentration tested in five replicates over three days on
two reagent lots (60 replicates per lot). LoD value was calculated as the LoB + 1.645
x SD of the replicates for the low level samples. The LoD of the QUANTA Flash
Scl-70 assay for the two lots were below the measuring range. The claimed LoD is
614 RLU, equivalent to 0.2 CU.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined in a separate study using four low
level samples run in replicates of five for three days on two reagent lots (120 data
points total) was determined with a total error goal of 25%. The claimed LoQ is 1.2
CU.

e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interferents:
The interference study was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2. Three specimens
were tested (negative: 10.7 CU; low: 21.5 CU; positive: 49.4 CU). Interfering
substances were spiked into every specimen at three different concentrations in 10%
of total specimen volume, and the resulting samples were assessed in triplicate with
the Scl-70 assay. Recovery of the unit values was calculated compared to control
samples spiked with the same volume of diluent (10% of total). No interference was
detected with bilirubin up to 10 mg/dL (recovery: 88% to 101%), hemoglobin up to
200 mg/dL (recovery: 93% to 105%), triglycerides up to 1000 mg/dL (recovery: 89%
to 97%), cholesterol up to 224.3 mg/dL (recovery: 93% to 106%), human IgG up to
70 mg/mL (recovery 90% to109%mg/dL or < 4 CU), RF IgM up to 500 IU/mL
(recovery: 97% to 111%), prednisone up to 0.3 mg/mL (recovery: 100.0% to 109.7%)
and naproxen up to 25.6 mg/mL (recovery: 97.7% to 109.7%)
Analytical cross-reactivity:
Cross reactivity of the QUANTA Flash Scl-70 was investigated using 12 reference
sera from the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with one lot of
QUANTA Flash Scl-70 reagents. The ANA human reference serum #9 (for human
antibodies to Scl-70) tested positive (2323 CU). The other reference sera in the panel
were below 6 CU.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off was establish and verified using 254 samples from differentially
diagnoses patients and healthy blood individuals in accordance to CLSI C28-A. The
99th percentile was taken into account for setting the cut-off. The value was set at
7,387 RLU which correspond to 20 CU. In addition, 19 systemic sclerosis samples
that were positive on the predicate device were tested to aid in the determination of
the cut-off. To ensure optimal differentiation between negatives and positives, the
cut-off increased to 15,000 RLU and a 20 CU value was assigned to this RLU value.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Samples from the clinical validation studies (see below) were tested with QUANTA
Flash Scl-70 and the predicate QUANTA Lite Scl-70. Samples within the assays’
measuring ranges were included in the method comparison analysis (n = 152) along
with 41 additional samples contrived by diluting Scl-70 positive samples with
negative serum to cover the reportable range of assay.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Clinical Specificity:
A total of 498 samples were included in the clinical evaluation for the QUANTA
Flash Scl-70. This validation set of samples included 123 samples from SSc patients;
samples from patients with other autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic lupus
erythematous (SLE), Sjögren’s syndrome, mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD),
idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, Crohn’s disease, autoimmune thyroiditis,
rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis); samples from patients with infectious disease; and
samples from patients with other diseases (e.g., osteoarthritis, chronic kidney disease,
and asthma). Clinical sensitivity and specificity for SSc is summarized in the
following table:
