I. Device Description:
The Assure Tech hCG Pregnancy Serum/Urine Combo Test Strip consists of a reagent strip,
which includes an absorbent pad, coated membrane, gold conjugate pad and sample pad. The
Assure Tech hCG Pregnancy Serum/Urine Combo Test cassette contains the same reagent
strip except that the strip is assembled in plastic device housing. The Assure Tech hCG
Pregnancy Serum/Urine Combo Test (Cassette, Strip) is designed to be tested as a single
cassette or dipstick device. The specimen migrates via capillary action along the membrane
to react with the colored conjugate. This test measures the presence of the hCG in human
urine or serum for the early detection of pregnancy. Users are able to read serum test results
in 5 minutes, and read urine test results in 3 minutes.

L. Test Principle:
The Assure Tech hCG Pregnancy Serum/Urine Combo Test (Strip, Cassette) is a qualitative,
lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay for the detection of human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG) in serum and urine. When the absorbent end is immersed into a sample
(strip format) or a sample is applied to the absorbent end (cassette format), the sample will
mix with the antibody-dye conjugate (mouse anti-beta hCG monoclonal antibody), and then
flow across the pre-coated (goat anti hCG polyclonal antibody) membrane. If there is
sufficient hCG in the specimen, a colored band will form at the test region of the membrane.
The presence of this colored band indicates a positive result, while its absence indicates a
negative result. The presence of colored line in the “C” region serves as an internal
procedural control. No line in the “C” region indicates that the test is invalid.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility/cut-off values:
A precision study was performed using negative human urine and serum samples
spiked with hCG traceable to the WHO 4th international standard. Serum samples
were tested with hCG concentrations of 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, and 50 mIU/mL.
Urine samples were tested with hCG concentrations of 0, 5, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 50
and 100 mIU/mL. The samples were measured in 10 replicates per day for 5 days
using 3 different lots for each device format at three testing sites (including 2 POC
sites) by 3 different operators at each site. The results are summarized in the
following tables:

Organization (W.H.O.) 4th International Standard for hCG.
Stability/Shelf life:
The stability testing protocol and acceptance criteria used to support the shelf life
were reviewed and found acceptable. The sponsor claims that devices are stable for 24
months when stored at 39-86°F (4-30°C).
d. Detection limit:

samples). The testing was done with three lots of the cassette format. No interference
was observed from the following substances at the concentrations listed below:

Hook effect:
Negative urine and serum samples were spiked with varying hCG concentrations
from 62.500 IU/mL to 2000 IU/mL. The spiked samples were tested by 3 different
operators using 3 different lots. The results demonstrated no hook effect at hCG
concentrations up to 2000 IU/mL.
Effects of hCG β-core fragment:
Serum samples with 5mIU/mL and 10mIU/mL hCG, and urine samples with 10mIU/mL
and 20mIU/mL hCG were spiked with varying concentrations of hCG β-core fragment up
to 2x106 pmol/L. These samples were tested by 3 different operators using 3 different
lots. The results demonstrated no interference when hCG β-core fragment is ≤200
pmol/L. The sponsor has the following warning in their package insert:

High levels of hCG β-core fragment (>200 pmol /L) can lead to false positive results for
both serum and urine samples.
Cross reactivity:
Serum samples with 5mIU/mL and 10mIU/mL hCG, and urine samples with 10mIU/mL
and 20mIU/mL hCG were spiked with varying concentrations of glycoprotein hormones:
Luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid stimulating
hormone (TSH). These samples were tested by 3 different operators using 3 different
lots. The results demonstrate no cross reactivity from these glycoprotein hormones up to
the following concentrations:
Glycoprotein Hormones Concentrations
LH 300 mIU/mL
FSH 1000 mIU/mL
TSH 1000 µIU/mL
Effects of urine pH:
Negative and positive urine samples containing 10 and 20 mIU/mL hCG were tested at
pH values ranging from 4 to 9 using 3 different lots by 3 different operators. The results
demonstrate no interference effect to the test performance from pH values of 4 to 9.
Effects of urine Specific Gravity:
Negative and positive urine samples containing 10 and 20 mIU/mL hCG were tested with
Specific Gravity values ranging from 1.007 to1.032 using 3 different lots by 3 different
operators. The results demonstrate no interference from urine Specific Gravity ranging
from 1.007 to1.032.
f. Assay cut-off:
See precision section above (M(1)(a)).
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were conducted at three different OB/GYN Physician’s
Offices. A total of 120 urine and 120 serum samples were collected from 120 donors
(ages ranging from 18 to 49 years old and about half of them were pregnant at less
than 5 weeks early stage). Samples were randomly collected at various times
throughout the day, and tested at each site by six different healthcare professionals
(three operators for strip format and three operators for cassette format) using both
the proposed and the predicate devices. All samples were tested using each device
format (strip and cassette). Each operator performed tests using one device format
with three different lots of the candidate device and one predicate device at the same
time, but not sequentially. All 3 lots of candidate devices gave the same result for
each sample and the following tables summarize the representative results from one
