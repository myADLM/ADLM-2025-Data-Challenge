The GloCyte® Automated Cell Counter System is an automated cell counter that concentrates
and enumerates total nucleated cells (TNCs) and red blood cells (RBCs) using fluorescent
microscopy and digital image analysis principles. The test method uses one of two reagents
to stain TNCs (propidium iodide with detergent) or RBCs (fluorochrome labeled anti-human
RBC antibody in buffer with stabilizers), and a digital imaging system to count the cells. The
image is captured by a digital CCD camera, and the fluorescent stained cells are counted via
digital image processing.
The GloCyte® Automated Cell Counter System includes the GloCyte instrument, computer
(hardware and software), Vacuum Station, Sample Preparation Tray, barcode reader, pipettes
(10 and 30 μL), test cartridge, TNC and RBC reagents, Low and High Level Controls.

Repeatability was accessed in-house using two test cartridge lots, two reagent lots
(one TNC and one RBC) and GloCyte® Low and High Level Controls. Fourteen
manipulated human CSF samples (7 TNC samples and 7 RBC samples) with
concentrations evenly distributed throughout the reportable range of the GloCyte®
Automated Cell Counter System were tested. Ten replicates were performed on the
GloCyte System per cell concentration level for a total of 70 tests each for the RBC
counts and TNC counts. The SD and %CV were calculated for each study sample.
The results of the repeatability met the performance specifications (%CV) for the
GloCyte® Automated Cell Counter System.

A reproducibility study was also performed in-house over 25 days using two GloCyte
instruments, 19 test cartridge lots, and 10 reagent lots (5 TNC and 5 RBC), one lot of
GloCyte® Low and High Level Controls as samples as well as a Mid-Level Control
sample that was made from a combination of the Low and High Level Control, and
two operators. Three cell concentration levels were tested in duplicate for both TNCs
and RBCs, twice daily (2 runs) by each operator on each GloCyte instrument. The
Low Level Control targeted (approximately12 cells/μL), the Mid-Level targeted
(approximately 40–50 cells/μL), and the High Level targeted (approximately120
cells/μL) each targeted cell concentration for each control level were for TNCs and
RBCs. The Low Level Control was tested with the 30 μL test volume and the High
Level Control was tested with the 10 μL test volume. The mid-level control was
tested with both the 30 μL and 10 μL test volumes. To further demonstrate precision
performance, SD and %CV of the within-run, between-run, within-day, between-
instruments, between-operator, and between-day precision calculations were
performed. The test results demonstrate that the %CV specifications were met for the
Low, Mid, and High Level cell concentrations for both the TNC and RBC assays on
the GloCyte® Automated Cell Counter System, at test volumes of 10 μL or 30 μL.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity was conducted in-house using manipulated human CSF samples with
concentrations spanning the entire reportable intervals (RI) of both TNC and RBC
cell types on the GloCyte® Automated Cell Counter System. A total of 14
concentration levels ranging from roughly 0–8,000 TNCs/μL were tested for the TNC
and a total of 15 concentration levels ranging from roughly 0–800,000 RBCs/μL for
the RBC were tested on three GloCyte® Automated Cell Counter Systems by three
operators. The RI consists of both the analytical measurement range (sample levels
that do not require a dilution to be measured on the GloCyte® Automated Cell
Counter System) and the extended measuring interval (sample levels that require
dilution to be measured on the GloCyte® Automated Cell Counter System). Dilution
guidelines based on the visual appearance of the samples as well as dilution/test
volume recommendations provided by the GloCyte® Automated Cell Counter System
software were used to run each of the test samples tested in the linearity study. The
results of the GloCyte® Automated Cell Counter System linearity study support the
following linearity claims:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
GloCyte® Low and High Level Controls Value Assignment
Value assignment was conducted by two operators on two GloCyte® Automated Cell
Counter Systems with three vials of each control level. Each vial is tested four times
by each of the two operators. The vials are stored at 2–8ºC and brought to room
temperature for 15 minutes prior to testing. The mean and standard deviation for the
low and high controls are calculated from the total number of tests for each control
level. The final value assignment for each lot of controls is based on the mean count
±3 standard deviations.
Quality Control Stability
To determine closed vial stability, three control lots were analyzed at several time
points (0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13 months). The unopened GloCyte® Low and High
Level Control vials from each lot were removed from 2–8°C storage conditions and
tested with both TNC Reagent (10 replicates) and RBC Reagent (10 replicates) on a
GloCyte® Automated Cell Counter System. GloCyte® Low and High Level Controls
closed vial stability study data support a stability claim of 7 months when stored at
10

2–8°C.
To determine open vial stability two lots of GloCyte® Low and High Level Controls
were tested over a 15 day period, with three replicates tested from each of three vials
for a total of nine replicates for both TNC and RBC assays. The opened vial stability
claim has been established at 8 days after opening when stored at 2–8°C after each
use.
CSF Sample Stability
The sample stability study was conducted at three clinical laboratory sites by testing
nine total nucleated cell (TNC) CSF samples and seven (7) red blood cell (RBC) CSF
samples over the course of 5 hours, with three replicates tested each hour on the
GloCyte® Automated Cell Counter System. The data collected in the CSF stability
study was normalized due to the varying cell concentrations among samples tested by
converting the cell counts into percent recoveries based on the cell count obtained for
each sample at time zero. The result from each individual replicate tested beyond time
zero was divided by the mean cell count produced at time zero and multiplied by
100%. The results of the CSF specimen stability study support a 4-hour timeframe for
testing CSF specimens upon delivery to the clinical laboratory.
GloCyte Reagent Stability
Reagent stability was assessed using simulated spinal fluid (SSF). SSF samples were
created on each day of testing using whole blood diluted into a simulated CSF matrix.
The stability of the GloCyte TNC and RBC Reagents was established using both
closed reagent vials (shelf life stability) and open reagent vials (in-use stability).
i. TNC Reagent Stability
Closed vial stability
Three vials from each of three lots of TNC Reagent that were stored at two
temperatures (4°C and 10°C) and tested at various time intervals (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 9 or 10, 13, 15 and 16 months). TNC Reagent vials were removed from their
respective storage conditions at each time point and brought to room temperature
before testing for a total of five replicates per TNC Reagent vial on the GloCyte®
Automated Cell Counter System. The TNC closed vial study data supports
stability claim of 13 months when stored at 2–8°C.
Open vial stability
Six TNC Reagent vials from two lots of reagent were brought to room
temperature from 4°C storage conditions and tested on the GloCyte® Automated
Cell Counter System at each test point (0, 4, 7, 13, and 15 months). Three
replicates from each vial were tested with the normal saline and simulated spinal
fluid samples. Three of the six TNC Reagent vials were then stored at 4°C and the
other three TNC Reagent vials were stored at 22°C to simulate refrigerated and
room temperature storage conditions, respectively. These opened TNC Reagent
vials from both storage conditions were tested weekly for a total of 5 weeks. The
11

--- Page 12 ---
TNC opened vial stability claim has been established at 5 days after opening
when stored at room temperature. All acceptance criteria for the closed and open
vial stability were met for the TNC Reagent.
ii. RBC Reagent Stability
Closed vial stability
Three vials from each of three lots of RBC Reagent that were stored at two
temperatures (4°C and 10°C) and tested at various time intervals (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 10, 13, 15 and 17 months). The RBC Reagent vials were removed from their
respective storage conditions at each time point and brought to room temperature
before testing on the GloCyte® Automated Cell Counter System. Normal saline
and simulated spinal fluid samples were tested with the RBC Reagents for a total
of five replicates per RBC Reagent vial on the GloCyte System. The RBC closed
vial study data supports a preliminary stability claim of 13 months when stored at
2–8°C.
Open vial stability
Six RBC Reagent vials each from each of two lots of RBC Reagent were brought
to room temperature from 4°C storage conditions and tested on the GloCyte®
Automated Cell Counter System with normal saline and simulated spinal fluid at
each test point (0, 4, 7, 13, and 15 months). Three replicates from each vial were
tested with the normal saline and simulated spinal fluid samples. Three of the six
RBC Reagent vials were then stored at 4°C and the other three RBC Reagent vials
were stored at 22°C to simulate refrigerated and room temperature storage
conditions, respectively. These opened RBC Reagent vials from both storage
conditions were tested weekly for a total of five weeks. The RBC opened vial
stability claim has been established at 5 days after opening when stored at room
temperature. All acceptance criteria for the closed and open vial stability were
met for the RBC Reagent.
GloCyte Test Cartridge Stability
To determine closed vial stability, three lots of GloCyte test cartridges were evaluated
on the GloCyte System for both TNC and RBC assays at three different storage
temperatures (8°C, 22°C, and 42°C). Testing was performed at various time points (0,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 13 months). GloCyte test cartridges were brought to room
temperature from the different storage conditions prior to testing on the GloCyte at
each time point. The GloCyte test cartridges were tested with normal saline and
simulated spinal fluid (both nucleated cells and red blood cells) for a total of 72
cartridges per cell type. The GloCyte test cartridge study data supports a stability
claim of 10 months when stored at 10°C – 40°C.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) testing was performed using five blank human CSF samples
with low concentrations (1‒2 cells/μL) of TNCs and/or RBCs on two GloCyte®
12

--- Page 13 ---
Automated Cell Counter Systems. Samples were tested four times with one reagent
lot and one cartridge lot and four times with a second reagent and cartridge lot for a
total of 40 tests per day. A total of 120 tests were performed on each instrument per
assay (TNC or RBC) over a testing period of 3 days.
LoD testing was performed using CSF specimens with low (RBC or TNC) count
levels (1‒2 cells/μL). Six RBC and six TNC CSF specimens were tested on each of
two GloCyte instruments. The reference cell counts for each low-count CSF specimen
were determined by manual hemocytometer cell counting. Each low-count CSF
specimen was tested 10 times with one reagent lot and one cartridge lot and 10 times
with a second reagent and cartridge lot. A total of 120 tests were performed on each
instrument per assay.
The LoQ was determined by graphically plotting the estimated percent total error
(%TE) of the GloCyte® Automated Cell Counter System along the y-axis and the
“true” manual count for each sample along the x-axis and then performing a linear
regression. The LoQ is the manual count at which the linear regression intersects the
20% maximum allowable %TE acceptance criteria.
LoB LoD LoQ
Analyte
(Cells/µL) (Cells/µL) (Cells/µL)
RBC <1 1 2
TNC <1 1 3
These results indicate that the estimated LoB, LoD and LoQ for the GloCyte®
Automated Cell Counter System TNC and RBC assays meet the expected
performance criteria for background limits and low limits of the measuring ranges.
e. Analytical specificity:
The interference study was conducted to evaluate the potential of various endogenous
substances present in CSF to affect RBC and TNC counts. Human whole blood was
drawn on days of testing and mixed with pooled human CSF to create the
Matrix/Base Pools containing RBCs or TNCs at two different cell concentrations: low
(approximately 10 cells/μL) and high (approximately 120 cells/μL). A total of four
Matrix/Base Pools were created, two per assay cell type (RBC or TNC cells/μL).
Samples for interference testing were created using these Base Pools by spiking in a
fixed volume of either the potential interferent or the solvent used to prepare the
potential interferent stock solution. All the potential interferents, with the exception
of nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs), were tested at high, “worst case”
concentrations that a typical laboratory would observe among patient specimens
submitted for analysis, and lower concentrations that are more prevalent in a normal
population or in patients with only slightly elevated levels of that substance.
Interference from NRBCs were evaluated using six clinical peripheral blood samples
with varying NRBC concentrations used to create manipulated CSF samples to be
tested using the TNC Reagent on the GloCyte® Automated Cell Counter System.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 321 CSF specimens (203 adult specimens and 118 pediatric specimens) for
TNC and a total of 422 CSF specimens (243 adult specimens and 179 pediatric
specimens) for RBC were analyzed at five clinical sites in the U.S. The CSF samples
were tested for TNC and RBC counts using the Neubauer hemocytometer (reference
method). Each sample was analyzed in duplicate on the Neubauer hemocytometer and
on the GloCyte® Automated Cell Counter System. Results were compared by
regressing the first of the duplicate measurements for the GloCyte® Automated Cell
Counter System against the mean of the duplicate counts for the hemocytometer.
An in-house method comparison was also performed by using manipulated CSF
samples (31 samples for TNC and 41 samples for RBC) that were created by diluting
human TNC and RBC into pooled blank human CSF. Pediatric samples (pediatric
venous blood and pediatric CSF) and adult samples (adult venous blood and adult
CSF) were contrived to allow for separate analyses of pediatric and adult data. Test
sample levels were randomly tested. Two manual counts were performed using the
Neubauer hemocytometer and two counts were performed using the GloCyte®
Automated Cell Counter System.
The external and in-house method comparison slope and intercept results of all
regression analyses met the acceptance criteria. The TNC and RBC results
demonstrate that the GloCyte Automated Cell Counter System yields results
equivalent to manual counts using the Neubauer hemocytometer for the intended use,
in both pediatric and adult populations.
