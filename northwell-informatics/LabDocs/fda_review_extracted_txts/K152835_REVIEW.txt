Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer
I. Device Description:
Uritek TC-201 Urine Chemistry Test System consists of Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer and
Urine Microalbumin Creatinine Strips. The Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer (TC-201) is a
portable instrument which reads Teco Diagnostics' Urine Microalbumin Creatinine (UAC)
Strips. The analyzer can determine the intensity of different colors on the reagent strip test
area. It does this by irradiating the test area with light and detecting the reflectance of
different wavelengths using photodiode. Results are calculated by a reflection rate which is a
percentage of the total reflectance of the testing wavelength and are printed automatically.
The Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer reports semi-quantitative assays for microalbumin and
creatinine. Reagent strip results are automatically displayed on the screen in one minute. A
printed hardcopy can also be created either from the results screen or recalled from memory.
The analyzer features a display, internal printer, a serial computer interface and an electrical
outlet. Communication between the operator and the analyzer is made through the display
using the user interface touch screen on the front surface of the instrument.
The Urine Microalbumin Creatinine (UAC) Strips are urine test strips of which
microalbumin and creatinine reagent pad are affixed onto the firm plastic strips. The reagent
pad areas are bibulous material saturated with chemically active substances, then dried and
affixed to the plastic strip with double-sided adhesive. UAC strips provide tests for the semi-
quantitative detection of Microalbumin and Creatinine and determination of the Albumin to
Creatinine ratio (A:C) in urine.

L. Test Principle:
The Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer is a reflectance photometer that analyzes the intensity and
color of light reflected from the reagent areas of a urinalysis reagent strip. Using a light
emitting diode (LED) as the light source and a light sensor, the optical system reads the color
change in the urine test strips after a sample is applied.
Microalbumin : Indicator method based on dye binding using a high affinity
sulfonephthalein dye. At a constant pH, the development of a blue color is due to the
presence of Microalbumin. The resulting color ranges from pale green to aqua blue.
Creatinine : Indicator method based on the peroxidase-like activity of a copper creatinine
complex that catalyze the reaction of diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide and 3’, 3’, 5’, 5’ –
tetramethylbenzidine. The resulting color ranges from orange through green to blue.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To evaluate between-run precision, 3 levels of albumin and creatinine in contrived
urine samples were tested at 3 sites with the Uritek TC-201 Urine Chemistry Test
system using three lots of strips and 3 analyzers. Each sample was assayed by three
POC operators at each site, twice a day for 20 days. To evaluate within run precision,
3 levels of albumin and creatinine in contrived urine samples were tested at 3 sites

d. Detection limit:
The cutoff of the assay at each color block was evaluated by spiking or diluting urine
samples to known concentrations. For each analyte there is a minimum of three levels
across the measuring range of each color block. Each sample was tested by three
operators with 3 lots of strips for 3 days. The cutoff for each block is defined as the
lowest concentration at which >50% of the results are positive for each color block.
The cut-off values for each color block are summarized below:

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed to evaluate the effects of potential interferents
commonly found in urine on the performance of the test system, following CLSI EP7-
A2. Testing was done with contrived urine samples at 3 levels of albumin (10, 30,
150 mg/L) and creatinine (10, 100, 300 mg/dL) and at least two levels of the listed
compounds with 3 lots of the test strips. Interference was defined as a change in
output of ≥±1 color blocks between spiked and unspiked samples.

The sponsor includes the following table to summarize the substance and
concentrations that could interfere with the test of albumin and creatinine on Uritek
TC-201 Urine Analyzer.
Analyte Substances causing decreased Substances causing increased
results results
Albumin Potassium chloride (1500 mg/dL) Hemoglobin (10 mg/dL)
Sodium chloride (5500 mg/dL) Sodium bicarbonate (750 mg/dL)
Blood (0.05%)
Human IgG (50 mg/dL)
Creatinine Glycine (225 mg/dL) Hemoglobin (10 mg/dL)
Sodium bicarbonate (750 mg/dL) Sodium chloride (5500 mg/dL)
Blood (0.05%)
Urine pH Interference Study:
Urine pH was evaluated for potential interference. Negative random urine samples
were collected, pooled and divided into 7 portions. The pH of each portion was
adjusted from 4 to 10, then spiked with albumin or creatinine to 3 concentrations.
Samples were tested using 3 lots of test strips and one analyzer. The evaluation of
urine pH showed no effect on the test results for albumin and creatinine.
Urine SG Interference Study:
Specific gravity of urine samples that were confirmed with refractometer as 1.005,
1.010, 1.020 and 1.030 were tested for potential interference with creatinine test
results. Creatinine readouts from the Uritek TC-201 Urine Chemistry Test System
were 50mg/dL, 100mg/dL, 200mg/dL and 300mg/dL respectively. The results were
consistent with results obtained from a reference method showing no abnormal effect
by SG on the creatinine result.
When urine samples at different specific gravity were spiked with albumin, results
showed no inference in albumin readouts from Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer using
Urine Microalbumin Creatinine (UAC) strips.
The sponsor states the following in the labeling regarding potentially interfering
substances:
1. The presence of hemoglobin (≥10 mg/dL or visibly bloody urine) may cause
falsely elevated results with both albumin and creatinine tests. The presence of
potassium chloride (≥1500mg/dL) could cause decreased results with albumin
test.
The presence of glycine (≥225mg/dL) could cause decreased results with
creatinine test. Sodium biocarbonate above 750mg/dL could affect the results
of both microalbumin and creatinine tests.
2. Substances that cause abnormal urine color, such as drug containing azo dyes
(e.g., Pyridium, AZO Gantrisin, AZO Gantanol), nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin,
Furadantin) and riboflavin may affect the readability of the reagent areas on
urinalysis reagent strips.

3. Urinary albumin excretions can be elevated by exercise, urinary tract
infections, and acute illness with fever. It is recommended that individuals
avoid strenuous exercise prior to testing.
4. As with laboratory tests, definitive diagnostic or therapeutic decisions should
not be based on a single result or method.
Humidity Studies:
The environmental effect on the performance of Uritek TC-201 Urine Chemistry Test
System was evaluated by placing the test strips in relative humidity of <20%, 30%,
50%, 60% and 70% environment at 15oC and 45oC. Strips were removed at 0.5h, 1h,
2h, 4h, 8h, 16h and 24h for testing using contrived urine samples at 3 levels of
microalbumin (10, 30, 150mg/L) and creatinine (10, 50, 300mg/dL). 5 replicates were
tested for each level. The test strips were stable up to 50% humidity for over 24h at
either 15 oC or 45oC. When humidity is above 60%, the test strips were stable for 8h
when stored at 15 oC and for 4hr when stored at 45oC.
Timing Flex Study:
The effect of various dipping time in urine samples was evaluated for the
performance of the Uritek TC-201 Urine Chemistry Test System. The strip was
dipped in the urine samples for 1 second, 5 seconds and 10 seconds before removed
for testing. Contrived urine samples at 3 levels of microalbumin (10, 30, 150mg/L)
and creatinine (10, 50, 300mg/dL) were tested. Each sample was tested in 5
replicates. Study results showed that dipping time had no effect on the test results.
Sample Carryover Studies:
The potential interference of samples running over from one pad to the adjacent pad
on the performance of Uritek TC-201 Urine Chemistry Test System was evaluated.
The strip was dipped into a urine sample and upon removal, was held upward to allow
the sample flow from the microalbumin pad to the creatinine pad or held downward
to allow the sample flow from the microalbumin pad to the creatinine pad before
testing. Contrived urine samples at 3 levels of microalbumin (10, 30, 150mg/L) and
creatinine (10, 50, 300mg/dL) were tested. Each holding method was tested in 5
replicates. Study results showed that sample running over from one test pad had no
interfering effect on the test of the other pad.
f. Assay cut-off:
See detection limits (M. 1. d.) above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Three point-of-care (POC) sites that represented the intended user sites of these
devices were selected to perform the method comparison studies. Each site randomly
selected at least 120, unaltered patient samples to test on both device pairings
12

--- Page 13 ---
(proposed and predicate devices). In addition, 38 contrived samples (9%) were
generated to cover the measuring range of the test. In total, 402 specimens were
tested. Three lots of test strips and 3 analyzers were used in the study.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected values are included in the labeling and are taken from literature references.
Albumin: Normal albumin levels in random urine are under 20 mg/L. Microalbuminuria
is indicated as the result of albumin excretion rate of 30-300 mg/24 hours. Values above
300mg/L indicate clinical albuminuria. The detection of albuminuria at levels at or above
30mg/L will help clinicians to better diagnose diabetes in its early stages1.
Creatinine: Creatinine is normally present in random urine in concentrations of 10 to 300
mg/dL (0.9 to 26.5 mmol/L).
Albumin/Creatinine Ratio: Albumin is normally present in urine at concentrations of less
than 30 mg albumin / g creatinine (<3.4 mg/mmol). Microalbuminuria is indicated at a
ratio result of 30-300 mg/g (3.4-33.9 mg/mmol) (Abnormal) and clinical albuminuria at a
ratio result of >300 mg/g (>33.9 mg/mmol) (High Abnormal)1.

3. Specimen Identification:
A barcode scanner and manual entry of sample numbers are used for sample
identification.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The keypad on the screen or a barcode scanner is used to enter the barcode from the
strip bottle. The Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer can only accept one test strip at a time.
Test strips are dipped in urine, and read on the analyzer. The analyzer also stores up to
2000 patient results which can be recalled by the patients’ ID, date or operators (using
“Advanced” settings by which is possible to add or remove authorized operators, change
operator permissions, and perform quality control testing).
5. Calibration:
The instrument starts a 10 seconds of self-calibration after pressing the START button
when running a Urinalysis Strip Quick Test. The device calibrates by reading a
reference block located at the end of the test strip bed using the appropriate LED light
during each strip test to ensure the accurate test result.
6. Quality Control:
The instrument includes a quality control function (QC). When the QC function is
enabled, the instrument will ask for control testing during the system initialization prior
to the routine testing run.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
