The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu
A+B is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for
the direct and qualitative detection of influenza A
and B viral nucleoprotein antigens from nasal and
nasopharyngeal swabs of symptomatic patients.
The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu
A+B (also referred to as the BD Veritor System
and BD Veritor System Flu A+B) is a
differentiated test, such that influenza A viral
antigens can be distinguished from influenza B
viral antigens from a single processed sample
using a single device. The test is to be used as an
aid in the diagnosis of influenza A and B viral
infections. A negative test is presumptive and it is
recommended that these results be confirmed by
viral culture or an FDA-cleared influenza A and B
molecular assay. Outside the U.S., a negative test
is presumptive and it is recommended that these
results be confirmed by viral culture or a
molecular assay cleared for diagnostic use in the
country of use. FDA has not cleared this device
Intended use for use outside of the U.S. Negative test results unchanged
do not preclude influenza viral infection and
should not be used as the sole basis for treatment
or other patient management decisions. The test
is not intended to detect influenza C antigens.
Performance characteristics for influenza A and B
were established during January through March of
2011 when influenza viruses A/2009 H1N1,
A/H3N2, B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata
lineage were the predominant influenza viruses in
circulation according to the Morbidity and Mortality
Weekly Report from the CDC entitled “Update:
Influenza Activity—United States, 2010-2011
Season, and Composition of the 2011-2012
Influenza Vaccine.” Performance characteristics
may vary against other emerging influenza
viruses.
If infection with a novel influenza virus is suspected
based on current clinical and epidemiological
screening criteria recommended by public health
authorities, specimens should be collected with
appropriate infection control precautions for novel

5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the
device and its components, and the results of the analysis.
The Risk Analysis method used was based on a BD Product Risk Management
procedure which meets the requirement for risk management as set forth in
ISO14971:2007 and EN ISO 14971:2012.

b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities
required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.
The results of the analysis indicated an initial possible combination of severity and
occurrence that fell into S-3/P-3 category. To implement the indicated investigation, a
protocol was developed and approved based on previously accepted FDA submissions
regarding strain reactivity. Acceptability criteria were defined as the ability of the BD
TM
Veritor test to detect the additional Flu strains. The results of the strain testing reduced
the probability of occurrence from P-3 to P-1 and reduced the risk to the “negligible”
category.

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use
for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular
modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices
demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the
design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the
device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
