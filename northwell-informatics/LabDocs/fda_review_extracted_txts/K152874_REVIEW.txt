Similarities:
Intended use The BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Flu unchanged
A+B is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for
the direct and qualitative detection of influenza A
and B viral nucleoprotein antigens from
nasopharyngeal wash, aspirate and swab in
transport media samples from symptomatic patients.
The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu
A+B is a differentiated test, such that influenza A
viral antigens can be distinguished from influenza B
viral antigens from a single processed sample using
a single device. The test is to be used as an aid in
the diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections. A
negative test is presumptive and it is recommended
that these results be confirmed by viral culture or an
FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay.
Outside the U.S. a negative test is presumptive and
it is recommended that these results be confirmed
by viral culture or a molecular assay cleared for
diagnostic use in the country of use. FDA has not
cleared this device outside the U.S. Negative test
results do not preclude influenza viral infection and
should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or
other patient management decisions. The test is not
intended to detect influenza C antigens.
Performance characteristics for influenza A and B
nasopharyngeal (NP) washes/aspirates were
established during January through March of 2011
when influenza viruses A/2009 H1N1, A/H3N2,
B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage were
the predominant influenza viruses in circulation
according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report from the CDC entitled "Update: Influenza
Activity-United States, 2010-2011 Season, and
Composition of the 2011-2012 Influenza Vaccine."
Performance characteristics may vary against other
emerging influenza viruses.

5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a. Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the
device and its components, and the results of the analysis
The Risk Assessment process used was based on a BD Product Risk Management
procedure which, according to the sponsor, meets the requirement for risk management
as set forth in ISO 14971:2007 and EN ISO 14971:2012.
Using this procedure, the following were estimated and the results are in the table below
under 5b:
· The Hazard,
· The Adverse Effect (Harm to Patient),
· The Potential Causes of the Hazard,
· The probability of Hazard Severity and
· The probability of Occurrence
b. Based on the resulting calculated Risk Index, Risk Control Measures were identified,
required verification and validation activities were determined, and effectiveness of risk
control measures were verified.
The risk assessment identified the need to confirm the BD Veritor™ System’s reactivity to
new strains forecast for 2015/2016 Influenza Season.
The results of the analysis indicated an initial possible combination of severity and occurrence
that fell into S-3/P-3 category. To implement the indicated investigation, Protocol SDSP15004
was developed and approved based on previously accepted FDA submissions regarding
strain reactivity. The design of the study is replicated from a previous Special 510(k)
submission. The acceptability criterion was the ability of the BD VeritorTM test to detect the
additional Flu strains. The BD VeritorTM System Flu A+B assay successfully detected all
strains tested. The data to be included in the insert are the actual values obtained during this
testing. The results of the strain testing reduced the probability of occurrence from P-3 to P-1
and reduced the risk to the “negligible” category.

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended
use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the
particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified
devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter
has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this
basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared
device
