QUANTA Flash® β2GP1-Domain1
The QUANTA Flash® β2GP1-Domain1 is an in vitro chemiluminescent immunoassay
(CIA) for the semi-quantitative determination of IgG autoantibodies to β2GP1-Domain1
in human serum or citrated plasma. The presence of anti-β2GP1-Domain1 autoantibodies
is used in conjunction with clinical and other laboratory findings as an aid in the
diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome. The QUANTA Flash® β2GP1-Domain1 is not
intended to replace assays for antibodies against the whole β2GP1 molecule. Testing for
antibodies to the whole β2GP1 molecule is required according to the classification
criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome.

L. Test Principle:
Recombinant β2GP1-Domain1 protein is coated onto paramagnetic beads, which are stored
lyophilized in the reagent cartridge. The reagent pack is prepared for use in the BIO-
FLASH® system by pressing down on the grey lid of the reagent pack to pierce the induction
seals on the reagent tubes. Once the seals are broken, the beads are rehydrated by adding the

entire contents of the vial of resuspension buffer to the bead reagent tube using the transfer
pipette supplied with the kit. Only the hole above the bead reagent tube is accessible at this
point. The beads are then mixed with the resuspension buffer by pipetting up and down 30
times. This amount of mixing ensures complete resuspension of the beads. The label
covering the remaining three reagent holes is now removed, and the reagent cartridge is then
loaded onto the BIO-FLASH instrument. Samples are also loaded onto the instrument in
sample racks. A patient sample is pre-diluted by the BIO-FLASH with system rinse in a
small disposable plastic cuvette. Small amounts of the diluted patient sample, the beads, and
assay buffer are all combined into a second cuvette, and mixed. This cuvette is then
incubated at 37°C. The beads are magnetized and washed several times. Isoluminol
conjugated anti-human IgG antibodies are then added to the cuvette, and again incubated at
37°C. The beads are magnetized and washed repeatedly. The isoluminol conjugate is
oxidized when Trigger 1 and Trigger 2 are added to the cuvette, and the flash of light
produced from this reaction is measured as Relative Light Units (RLU) by the BIO-FLASH
optical system. The RLU are proportional to the amount of isoluminol conjugate that is
bound to the human IgG, which is in turn proportional to the amount of anti- β2GP1-
Domain1 antibodies bound to the corresponding β2GP1-Domain1 on the beads.
The QUANTA Flash® β2GP1-Domain1 assay utilizes a pre-defined lot specific Master
Curve that is uploaded onto the instrument through the reagent cartridge barcode. Every new
lot number of reagent cartridge must be calibrated before first use, with the QUANTA
Flash® β2GP1-Domain1 Calibrators. Based on the results obtained with the two Calibrators
included in the reagent kit, an instrument specific Working Curve is created, which is used to
calculate chemiluminescent units (CU) from the instrument signal (RLU) obtained for each
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Because the QUANTA Flash β2GP1-Domain1 assay and the HemosIL AcuStar β2GP1-
Domain 1 assay are identical, there is only one set of performance data and it is shown
below (labeled QUANTA Flash β2GP1-Domain1 assay).
The analytical performance of the QUANTA Flash β2GP1-Domain1 assay for use with
human serum samples was demonstrated in K141274, as indicated in the sections below.
This submission tested the performance of the QUANTA Flash β2GP1-Domain1 assay in
human citrated plasma, and included a matrix comparison study and testing of precision
and linearity in citrated plasma.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The manufacturer completed precision studies using human serum samples in
submission K141274. These studies measured repeatability, within-laboratory, and
lot-to-lot precision and all data met the manufacturer’s predetermined acceptance
criteria.
7

--- Page 8 ---
Precision of the QUANTA Flash® β2GP1-Domain1 assay in citrated plasma was
assessed in accordance with CLSI EP15-A3, User Verification of Precision and
Estimation of Bias; Approved Guideline—Third Edition. Three plasma samples with
concentrations of measurand near the medical decision point, and at low and high
positive values were tested with five replicates in a single run for five days (n = 25).
Controls were run as quality control during each run. Total %CV values were within
the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria. The acceptance criteria for
the plasma precision studies were the same as for the serum precision studies
performed in K141274.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity: The manufacturer completed linearity studies using human serum samples
in submission K141274. These studies included five serially diluted serum samples
that covered the analytical measuring range and all data met the manufacturer’s
predetermined acceptance criteria.
The linearity of the analytical measuring range (AMR, 3.6–1380.4 CU) in citrated
plasma was evaluated by a study according to CLSI EP6-A, Evaluation of the
Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach;
Approved Guideline. Three citrated plasma samples with various β2GPβ2GP1-
Domain1 antibody concentrations were serially diluted to obtain 10 dilutions of each
sample. Percent recovery was calculated compared to the expected results.
Obtained values were plotted against expected values, and linear regression
analysis was used to analyze the results. The slope and intercept of the
regression line were calculated with the 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) as
well as the correlation coefficient (R2) values. All samples met the
manufacturer’s pre-defined acceptance criteria. The acceptance criteria for the
plasma linearity studies were the same as for the serum precision studies performed in
K141274. Results of the study are summarized below:

f. Assay cut-off:
The manufacturer completed studies to determine the assay cut-off in submission
K141274. 30 serum samples were tested and the cut-off was set to 20 CU. A result
below 20 CU is considered negative and greater than 20 CU is considered positive.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The manufacturer completed a method comparison with the predicate device in
human serum samples in submission K141274. This included a total of 238 serum
samples: 230 native samples and eight contrived samples, with 183 of the samples
from patients with primary or secondary antiphospholipid syndrome, and 47 samples
from patients with other autoimmune diseases. The percent agreement between the
predicate and the QUANTA Flash β2GP1-Domain1 assay are summarized below:
Positive Percent Agreement (101/111): 91.0 % (95% CI: 84.1-95.6%)
Negative Percent Agreement (99/127): 78.0 % (95% CI: 69.7-84.8%)
Overall Percent Agreement (200/238): 84.0% (95%CI: 78.7-88.4%)
b. Matrix comparison:
The manufacturer completed a matrix comparison study using 59 matched serum and
citrated plasma samples. 29 of these matched samples were native, i.e., they were
tested without any modification. 25 matched samples were spiked with anti-Domain1
antibodies. Five matched samples that were originally running above the AMR were
tested after diluting with normal serum and plasma to obtain values within the AMR.
Finally, 10 matched samples that were also tested as neat samples were diluted with
normal serum and plasma to obtain two contrived matched pairs per sample. A total
of 79 native, spiked, and diluted matched samples were tested. Analysis using
weighted (1/x2) linear regression showed that all the data met the manufacturer’s
predetermined acceptance criteria. The data are presented in the table below:

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Clinical specificity:
The manufacturer measured the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the QUANTA
Flash β2GP1-Domain1 assay in submission K141274. A set of 1090 samples, none
of which were used in establishing the reference range, was used to validate the
clinical performance. The validation set consisted of a set of clinically characterized
sera from Primary APS, Secondary APS, and non-APS diseased controls. The data

in submission K141274. The expected value in the normal population is “negative”.
Anti- β2GPβ2GP1-Domain1 antibody levels were analyzed in a cohort of 400 apparently
healthy blood donors. With a cut-off of 20 CU, one sample (0.2%) was positive (34.2
CU) using the QUANTA Flash β2GPβ2GP1-Domain1 assay. The mean concentration
was 3.8 CU, the median concentration 3.6 CU, and the values ranged from < 3.6 to 34.2
CU.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
