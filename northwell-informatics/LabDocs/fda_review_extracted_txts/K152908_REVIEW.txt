Propoxyphene, Tricyclic Antidepressants are ingested, even at or above therapeutic
doses. There are no uniformly recognized drug levels for Barbiturate, Benzodiazepines,
Buprenorphine, Oxycodone, Propoxyphene, Tricyclic Antidepressant in urine. The
multidrug of abuse urine test device shows the drug was or was not present at the cutoff
level. The tests provide only preliminary test results, which must be confirmed by other
methods such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Clinical
considerations and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test
result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated. The tests are not
intended to be used in monitoring the drug levels.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Over-The-Counter (OTC) use.
For In Vitro Diagnostics only.

L. Test Principle:
The UCP Home™ Drug Screening Cups and The UCP Home™ Drug Screening Test Cards
employ lateral flow immunochromatographic technology based on the principle of
competitive binding. Drugs, if present in concentrations below the cutoff level, will not
saturate the binding sites of antibody coated particles in the device. The antibody-coated
particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-specific conjugate and a colored line will
appear in the test line region. The colored line will not form if the sample contains drug in
excess of the cutoff level because the drug will saturate all the binding sites of the drug-
specific antibody. Each strip in the device contains a procedural control that appears in the
control line region indicating that the sample has migrated properly on the test strip.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Methamphetamine, Opiates, Morphine, Phencyclidine, Barbiturates, Buprenorphine,
Benzodiazepines, Methadone, Oxycodone, MDMA, Propoxyphene, Tricyclic
Antidepressants drug tests in UCP Compact Drug Tests was established in the following
510(k) submissions: k061457, k091588, K091612, k110515, k122419, k123863,
k130463, k131811, and k132812.
Precision/Reproducibility studies for the EDDP drug test were conducted by analyzing
five different concentrations of EDDP in urine specimens: negative, 50% below the
cutoff, 25% below the cutoff, cutoff, 25% above the cutoff, 50% above the cutoff, 75%
above the cutoff and 100% above the cutoff. Each urine specimen, with each
concentration of EDDP was prepare by spiking different concentrations of EDDP into
drug-free normal human urine specimens (negative human urine), the final concentration
of EDDP in urine specimens was confirmed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry
(GC/MS). Each sample was tested four times daily for 20 non-consecutive days by one
operator at each concentration. A total of 60 determinations tested by three operators
were made at each concentration. The data are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. These devices are for qualitative use only.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Procedural controls are included in the test strip and device. A red colored line
appearing in the control zone is considered as an internal procedural control. It
confirms sufficient specimen volume, adequate membrane wicking and correct
procedural technique. Control standards are not supplied with these tests; however, it
is recommended that positive and negative controls be tested as a good laboratory
practice to confirm the test procedure and to verify proper test performance. Users
should follow local, state, and federal guidelines to run the external controls.
Stability:
Stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable. The
information supports that UCP Compact Drug Test Cups and Cards unopened
stability is 18 months. Real time stability testing is ongoing. (Instructions note that
opened tests should be used immediately.)

e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity and cross-reactivity for Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamine,
Methamphetamine, Opiates, Morphine, Phencyclidine, Barbiturates, Buprenorphine,
Benzodiazepines, Methadone, Oxycodone, MDMA, Propoxyphene, and Tricyclic
Antidepressants was established in the following 510(k) submissions: k061457,
k091588, K091612, k110515, k122419, k123863, k130463, k131811, k132812.
Analytical specificity and cross-reactivity for the EDDP drug test was established by
spiking various concentrations of similarly structured drug compounds into drug-free
urine (negative control). By analyzing results of various concentration of each
compound with the EDDP test, the concentration of the compound that produced a
response approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay was
determined. Results of those studies appear in the table(s) below:
EDDP
Compound Concentration at which the Cross-Reactivity
response was equivalent to
the cutoff of 300 ng/mL
2-ethylidene-1,5- 300 ng/mL 100%
dimethyl-3,3-
diphenylpyrrolidine
Methadone >100,000 ng/mL <1%
Doxylamine >100,000 ng/mL <1%
Interferences for Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Opiates,
Morphine, Phencyclidine, Barbiturates, Buprenorphine, Benzodiazepines,

k131811, and k132812. The following list of substances showed no interference at a
concentration of 100 μg/mL Acetaminophen, Acetylsalicylic Acid, Amikacin,
Ampicillin, Arterenal, Asprin, Atropine, Benzoic Acid, Oxalic Acid, Caffeine,
Methanol, Ethanol, Lidocaine, Thioridazine, Trifluoperazine, Penicillin-G,
Phenylpropanalamine, Ranitidine, Salicyclic Acid, Albumin, Bilirubin, Creatine,
Hemoglobin, Glucose, L-Ascorbic Acid, and Uric Acid when tested with the EDDP
test.
Samples above and below the analyte cutoff were adjusted to obtain specific gravities
of 1.002, 1.005, 1.01, 1.02, 1.025, 1.03, and 1.035. The cup and card formats with all
drug test strips, and the EDDP single panel cup and card formats were tested at each
specific gravity; the cup and the test card formats were tested separately.

The pH of samples above and below the analyte cutoff were adjusted to pH 4.5, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, and pH 10. The cup and card formats with all drug test strips, and the EDDP
single panel cup and card formats were tested at each pH; the cup and the test card
formats were tested separately.
The results demonstrated that pH and specific gravity do not affect the results from the
device.

A consumer study was conducted of the UCP Compact Drug Test Cards among 115 lay
persons in the three geographic regions. Fifty seven females and fifty eight males from
ages ranged from18 and 77 years participated the studies. Fifty seven participants had
high school education or less, fifty eight participants had finished college courses. None
of the participants had experience using drug testing products before. The urine samples
were prepared at the following concentrations: 0% of cutoff, 50% of cutoff, 75% of
cutoff, 125% of cutoff, 150% of cutoff and 300% of Cutoff. The urine samples with
various drug concentrations were prepared by spiking pure drugs or drug metabolites into
drug free human urine, the final drug concentrations in each urine sample were confirmed
by GC/MS with the exception of TCA which was confirmed by HPLC. Each participant
was asked to read the test instruction before performing the test, and then ran the test
independently without additional help. The test results by the lay users are summarized as

In a different study for the additional format, the sponsor performed a consumer study of
UCP Compact Drug Test Cup with 115 lay persons in the three geographic regions. Fifty
seven females and fifty eight from ages ranged from 18 and 77 years participated the
studies. Fifty seven participants had high school education or less, fifty eight participants
had finished college courses. None of the participants had experiences using drug testing
products before. The urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations: 0% of
cutoff, 50% of cutoff, 75% of cutoff, 125% of cutoff, 150% of cutoff and 300% of Cutoff.
The urine samples with various drug concentrations were prepared by spiking pure drugs or
drug metabolites into drug free human urine, the final drug concentrations in each urine
sample were confirmed by GC/MS with the exception of TCA which was confirmed by
HPLC. Each participant was asked to read the test instruction before performing the test,
and then ran the test independently without additional help. The test results by the lay users
are summarized below:
