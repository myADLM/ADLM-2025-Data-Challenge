H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Great Basin Shiga Toxin Direct Test performed on the Portrait Analyzer is an
automated, in vitro diagnostic assay for the qualitative detection of Shiga Toxin 1 (stx1)/
Shiga Toxin 2 (stx2) genes and specific identification of a conserved genetic region of the
E. coli O157 serogroup. Shiga Toxin genes are found in Shiga Toxin producing strains of
E. coli and Shigella dysenteriae.
The E. coli O157 test result is reported only if a Shiga Toxin gene is also detected. The
test is performed directly from Cary Blair or C&S Medium preserved stool specimens
from symptomatic patients with suspected acute gastroenteritis, enteritis, or colitis in
hospital laboratories. The assay is intended for use in conjunction with clinical
presentation as an aid in the diagnosis of STEC infections. Positive results do not rule out
co-infection with other organisms, and may not be the definitive cause of patient illness.
The results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or
other patient management decisions. Shiga Toxin Direct Test negative results in the
setting of clinical illness compatible with gastroenteritis may be due to infection by
pathogens that are not detected by this test or non-infectious causes such as ulcerative
colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or Crohn’s disease.

L. Test Principle:
The Portrait System utilizes automated hot start PCR amplification technology to amplify
specific nucleic acid sequences that are then detected using hybridization probes immobilized
on a modified silicon chip surface.
Target genomic DNA is extracted from preserved stool specimens alongside sample
processing control cells (SPC) and diluted to reduce potential inhibitors of the PCR reaction.
During the PCR process, double-stranded DNA is separated and target nucleic acid
sequences are amplified by thermal cycling. Biotin-labeled primers direct amplification of
specific nucleic acid sequences within a conserved region of the stx1, stx2, and O157
antigen-specific genes for identification of Shiga toxin producing E. coli.
Following the PCR process, biotin-labeled, amplified target DNA sequences are hybridized
to an array of probes immobilized on the silicon chip surface, then incubated with anti-biotin
antibody conjugated to the horseradish peroxidase enzyme (HRP). These probes are specific
for Shiga toxin 1 (stx1), Shiga toxin 2 (stx2), an O157 antigen marker gene, and the SPC. The
unbound conjugate is removed by washing and tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) is added to
produce a colored precipitate at the location of the probe/target sequence complex.
The resulting signal is detected by the automated Portrait Optical Reader within the Portrait
Analyzer. While the Shiga Toxin Direct Test is designed to detect and distinguish between
stx1 and stx2 toxin types, the assay does not report results to the individual toxin level.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test was conducted using a panel of
four positive samples and one negative sample. The positive panel members consisted
of two Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) strains: ATCC BAA- 2192 (O145:NM)
and ATCC strain 43895 (O157:H7), each at a moderate positive concentration (~3X
LoD) and a low positive concentration (~1.5X LoD). The positive samples were
contrived by spiking enriched broth cultures of known concentration into negative
clinical stool matrix consisting of clinical Shiga toxin negative stool preserved in
ParaPak® C&S media. The negative samples consisted of clinical negative stool
matrix.
The reproducibility studies were performed at three external clinical sites using
6

--- Page 7 ---
randomized, blind-coded panels and two different Shiga Toxin Direct Test cartridge
lots. The studies were performed over the course of five (5), nonconsecutive days. For
each day of testing, two (2) panel runs were performed with three (3) replicates of
each sample per run on each day. A minimum of two (2) operators performed the
testing at each site.
For moderate and low positive ATCC BAA-2192 samples, % agreement = "STEC
Positive; O157 Negative" calls per total sample runs. For moderate and low positive
ATCC 43895 samples, % agreement = "STEC Positive; O157 Positive" calls per total
sample runs. For clinical negative samples, % agreement = "STEC Negative; O157
Not Tested" calls per total samples runs.
The Shiga Toxin Direct Test results agreed with the expected results 100% across all
three sites, with the exception of a single Low Positive replicate for ATCC BAA-
2192 that produced a ‘STEC POSITIVE/Serotype O157 POSITIVE’ test result
instead of the expected result of ‘STEC POSITIVE/Serotype O157 NEGATIVE’.
The invalid and incomplete test rates for the reproducibility study were 1.1% (5
invalid runs/ 458 total runs) and 0.7% (3 test incomplete runs/ 458 total runs),
respectively. In all eight (8) instances, the sample was re-tested on a new cartridge
according to the package insert and each resolved to the expected result. The
reproducibility study results were acceptable. The results of the reproducibility
studies are summarized in Table 1.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
External controls:
External positive and negative controls are intended to monitor for correct procedural
technique and reagent integrity. External controls are not provided by Great Basin
and are not included in the package insert.
1. Commercially available ATCC Shiga toxin producing E. coli strains, for
example ATCC 700376 (E. coli O157:NM, stx1+) and ATCC 51434 (E. coli
O91:H21, stx2+), which have been diluted into Cary Blair or C&S media, are
recommended for use as positive controls.
2. An aliquot of Cary Blair or C&S media may be used as a Negative Control.
Alternatively, a known negative stool sample preserved in Cary Blair or C&S
media may be used.
The external Positive Control is intended to monitor for substantial reagent failure.
The external Negative Control is intended to confirm non-reactivity. An ‘INVALID’
result for any controls invalidates the Test result. Good laboratory practice
recommends the use of control samples. The Shiga Toxin Direct Test should not be
used in patient testing if the appropriate controls do not produce the expected results.
If the external controls do not produce the expected results, the test should be
repeated with a new Test Cartridge.
Daily Quality Control (QC) testing was conducted at each site during prospective and
frozen retrospective clinical testing. The daily QC panel consisted of one negative
and two positive samples to control for all assay outcomes. A total of 164 negative
controls and 328 positive controls were tested across six test sites producing valid
expected initial results for 163 (99.4%) and 317 (96.6%) negative controls and
positive controls, respectively. One negative control and two positive controls
produced initial ‘Test Incomplete’ results (0.6%). Seven positive controls produced
initial ‘Invalid’ results (2.1%), and two positive controls produced valid but incorrect
results (0.6%). All initially invalid and unexpected results (100%) resolved to the
expected result upon re-test.
Specimen Processing Control (SPC):
The SPC controls for all analytical steps in the procedure, including: DNA extraction
from organisms present in the stool specimen, PCR amplification of target DNA
sequences, hybridization, and detection on the chip surface. The SPC contains B.
subtilis cells in the form of a lyophilized cake that is incorporated directly into each
Test Cartridge to verify adequate processing of each clinical stool specimen sample.
If enteric microorganisms (such as bacteria including but not limited to E. coli) are
found in the stool specimen, the SPC verifies that proper cell lysis has occurred and
verifies that specimen processing is adequate. Additionally, SPC detects inhibition of
8

--- Page 9 ---
PCR reactions, ensuring the PCR reaction conditions are appropriate and that the
amplification reagents are functional. The SPC signal should be positive in a sample
that is negative for Shiga Toxin Direct Test analyte(s), and can be either negative or
positive in a sample containing analyte(s).
Specimen stability:
The recommended storage time and temperature conditions for transport media
preserved stool specimens prior to testing via the Shiga Toxin Direct Test include:
• Refrigerated storage (2°- 8° C) for up to 120 hours (5 days).
• Room temperature (25 °C ± 2 °C) storage for up to 4 hours.
• The combination of up to 4 hours storage at room temperature followed by
refrigerated storage for up to 120 hours.
To assess the stability of the Shiga toxin and serotype O157 nucleic acid targets of the
Shiga Toxin Direct Test under the recommended storage conditions, a specimen
stability study was performed to evaluate the recommended time and temperature
storage conditions. The study tested two non-O157 STEC strains (ATCC BAA-2191
and ATCC 51434) and one O157 STEC strain (ATCC 43889). Each sample was
contrived from freshly cultured STEC cells spiked at 2X LoD into negative stool
matrix and stored under the recommended storage conditions. The LoD was
approximated for the O157 STEC strain (ATCC 43889). A second O157 STEC strain
(ATCC 43890) was tested but was not included in the final analysis when baseline
(T ) testing results of 80% positivity indicated that the strain was spiked at
0
concentrations below 2X LoD. At five pre-defined testing time points, an aliquot of
each sample was removed and evaluated on the Shiga Toxin Direct Test. The results
of the specimen stability study support the recommended storage time and
temperature conditions for transport media preserved stool specimens. The results of
Specimen Stability Testing are summarized in Table 2.

Fresh versus Frozen:
A Fresh vs. Frozen Study was performed to support the use of frozen, transport media
preserved stool specimens in the Shiga Toxin Direct Test for the Frozen
Retrospective and Reproducibility Studies, as well as for follow-up testing of
prospective samples.
The Fresh vs. Frozen Study tested the performance of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test on
contrived positive samples that were subjected to two freeze/thaw cycles. The
contrived positive samples were prepared using fresh (i.e. never frozen) enriched
broth cultures. The panel for the Fresh vs. Frozen Study was comprised of six STEC
strains: ATCC BAA-2191 (stx1+/O157-), ATCC 51434 (stx2+/O157-), ATCC BAA-
2192 (stx1+/stx2+/O157-), ATCC 43890 (stx1+/O157+), ATCC 43889
(stx2+/O157+), and ATCC 43895 (stx1+/stx2+/O157+). Each strain was tested in
replicate at four concentrations: ≤ 0.5X LoD, 1X LoD, 3X LoD, and 10X LoD. The
LoD was approximated for strains ATCC 43890 and ATCC 43889
The panel was initially tested on the Shiga Toxin Direct Test within 30 minutes of
construction to establish the ‘fresh’ activity prior to freezing (T ). The entire panel
0
was then placed at ≤-70°C for 1 week at which time it was thawed and re-tested (T ).
1
The entire panel was returned to ≤-70°C for a second freezing cycle for an additional
one week at which time the samples were tested for a second, and final, thaw (T ).

evaluated three (3) of the previously characterized STEC strains at concentrations
near LoD (2X LoD), above LoD (5X LoD) and below LoD (0.5X LoD) in different
media. To generate the unique stool matrices for each media type, raw clinical stool
specimens that previously tested negative for Shiga Toxin were preserved in each
preservation medium per the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting six stool
matrices were evaluated directly as clinical negative samples and as contrived
positives.
For the Thermo Scientific™ Remel™ Cary Blair Transport Medium, Meridian™
Para-Pak® Enteric Plus Transport System, Thermo Scientific™ Protocol™ Cary Blair
Media, and Thermo Scientific™ Protocol™ Culture & Sensitivity (C&S) Medium,
results indicated that the media were equivalent to each other and equivalent to the
reference medium (Meridian™ Para-Pak® C&S) for test performance. At 5X LoD,
for all strains tested, there was 100% agreement with the expected results in all four
(4) media types. Likewise, at 2X LoD there was ≥95% agreement with the expected
results for all strains tested across all four (4) media types. Also as expected, the
percent agreement for strains below LoD (0.5X LoD) varied from 50% to 100%
across these four (4) media types.
The Meridian™ Para-Pak® 10% Formalin Stool Transport Vial media did not produce
the expected results for positive or negative samples. At concentrations of STEC
strains where a positive Shiga Toxin Direct Test result was expected in ≥ 95% of
replicates, all of the testing produced either ‘STEC Negative/Serotype O157 Not
Tested’ (12%) or ‘Invalid’ (88%) results. In negative stool matrix formulated with
this media, only 20% (2/10 replicates) of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test results resolved
as the expected ‘STEC Negative/Serotype O157 Not Tested’ result, and the remaining
80% of negative stool replicates (8/10 replicates) produced ‘Invalid’ results. The
overall invalid rate for initial testing (35 samples in total) was abnormally high at
85.7%, suggesting that 10% Formalin transport media inhibits the Shiga Toxin Direct
Test. Due to the evident inhibition and hindered performance of the Shiga Toxin
Direct Test, no further testing was conducted on this media type.
The Meridian™ Para-Pak® Zn PVA Stool Transport Vial media also produced
aberrant results with the Shiga Toxin Direct Test. At approximately 2X-5X LoD
when ≥95% of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test replicates are expected to be ‘STEC
Positive/Serotype O157 Negative’, 100% of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test replicates
produced ‘Invalid’ test results. Similarly, 100% of the negative stool matrix samples
formulated with this medium produced ‘Invalid’ Shiga Toxin Direct Test results,
indicating that this transport medium completely inhibits the Shiga Toxin Direct Test.
No further testing was conducted on this media type.
A summary of all media types tested and their resultant compatibility with the Shiga
Toxin Direct Test is provided in Table 4.

d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) for four (4) Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) strains
was measured for the Shiga Toxin Direct Test. The LoD for each toxin gene, stx1 and
stx2, was assessed and measured independently by testing a non-O157 stx1+
Escherichia coli strain (ATCC BAA-2191) and a non-O157 stx2+ Escherichia coli
strain (ATCC 51434), respectively. In addition the LoD for a non-O157 Escherichia
coli strain containing both toxin genes (stx1+/stx2+/O157-) was measured (ATCC
BAA-2192). Finally, the LoD for an O157 Serotype Escherichia coli strain
containing both toxin genes (stx1+/stx2+/O157+) was also measured (ATCC 43895).
The LoD for each strain is listed in Table 5.

The inclusivity/reactivity of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test was tested against 30 well-
characterized Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) strains representing the serotypes
of E. coli that are most often associated with disease: serotypes O26, O45, O103,
O111, O121, O145, and O157. The Shiga toxin gene (stx) which is identical in
sequence to the STECstx1 gene is also commonly found in Shigella dysenteriae
serotype 1 strains. Therefore in addition to STEC strains, three (3) serotype 1

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity:
A study was conducted to assess the potential for cross-reactivity of non-target
organisms found in stool specimens, including well-known enteric pathogens that
present clinically with symptoms similar to STEC, such as diarrhea. In total 104
unique bacterial strains, three (3) yeast, three (3) parasites, seven (7) viruses, and
human genomic DNA were evaluated for cross-reactivity. For some organisms that
were classified as Biosafety level III or that could not be cultured via standard clinical
microbiology techniques, genomic DNA was tested in lieu of whole organism. Each

non-target organism or nucleic acid was tested in the background of negative clinical
stool matrix consisting of clinical Shiga toxin negative stool preserved in ParaPak®
C&S media (Table 7).
Due to the design of the Sample Processing Control (SPC) in the Shiga Toxin Direct
Test, very high concentrations of non-STEC O157 E. coli can compete with
amplification of the SPC. An SPC amplification failure in the absence of a Shiga
toxin target signal will produce an invalid test result. Accordingly, two non-STEC
O157:H7 E. coli strains (ATCC 43888 and ATCC 700728) produced invalid test
results when tested at concentrations greater than or equal to 1.0x107 CFU/mL. When
the test concentrations for these strains (ATCC 43888 and ATCC 700728) were
lowered to approximately 1.0x106 CFU/mL prior to re-testing, the correct expected
result of ‘STEC Negative/Serotype O157 Not Tested’ was produced. None of the
other cultured organisms or genomic DNA that were tested interfered with the
internal controls or demonstrated cross reactivity.

the background of a contrived, low positive sample that was generated by spiking a
Shiga toxin-producing E. coli strain (ATCC 43895) containing all three test analytes
(stx1+, stx2+, and serotype O157) into ParaPak® C&S preserved clinical negative
stool matrix at 2X LoD (1x104 CFU/mL). Clinical negative stool matrix was also
tested (i.e. negative stool specimen, non-STEC) to evaluate potential interference
with assay controls in the absence of analyte.
None of the tested substances interfered with detection of either Shiga toxin or the
O157 Serotype gene targets, and each test resulted in ‘STEC POSITIVE/Serotype
O157 POSITIVE’ calls as expected. Additionally, none of the substances interfered
with assays controls when negative stool was tested. During testing, two (2) runs
yielded incomplete testing results, and a single ‘Invalid’ test was observed. In each
instance the specimen was re-retested using a new Shiga Toxin Direct Test cartridge,
and the testing resolved to the correct result.

Microbial Interference:
As a follow up to cross reactivity studies, the Shiga Toxin Direct Test was further
evaluated for interference from mixed microbial populations using a subset of 42
organisms and genomic DNA from the cross reactivity panel with a specific focus on
common gastrointestinal pathogens encountered in stool that cause similar disease
states to Shiga toxins. In total, 30 bacterial strains, two (2) yeast, four (4) parasites,
five (5) viruses, and human genomic DNA were tested (Table 9). Potential
interference from mixed infections was evaluated by testing two (2) STEC strains
(ATCC 43895 and ATCC 43894) that represent all three target analytes
(stx1+/stx2+/O157) at 2X LoD in the background of high concentrations of the non-
Shiga toxin-producing enteric organisms. A minimum of three replicate Shiga Toxin
Direct Tests were performed for each potentially interfering organism or nucleic acid.
All of the valid test runs produced the expected ‘STEC POSITIVE/Serotype O157
POSITIVE’ result, indicating that none of the tested organisms or nucleic acids
interfered with the detection of Shiga Toxin Direct Test gene targets at 2X LoD.

Carryover/Cross-Contamination:
A study was performed to assess the potential of carry-over or cross-contamination of
the Shiga Toxin Direct Test by alternatively testing high positive contrived stool
samples and clinical negative stool samples in direct succession for six (6) rounds on
five (5) Portrait Analyzers. The high positive sample was formulated by spiking
previously frozen and quantified enriched broth culture of STEC strain ATCC 43895
(stx1+/stx2+/O157) into negative clinical stool matrix consisting of clinical Shiga
toxin negative stool preserved in ParaPak® C&S media to obtain a final concentration
of 1x108 CFU/mL. In total, 60 Shiga Toxin Direct Test runs were performed: 30 high
positive runs and 30 negative runs.
All of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test results agreed with the expected test results.
Therefore, there was no evidence of carry-over or cross-contamination in any of the
tests. During carry-over/cross-contamination assessment, two (2) tests gave ‘Test
Incomplete’ results and a single ‘Invalid’ test results was observed. All three samples
were re-tested on new cartridges and all resolved to the expected result.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Performance characteristics of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test were determined in a
multi-site clinical study. Specimens for the clinical study were collected prospectively
(fresh) at five sites during a three-month period from June to September 2015. A
combined total of 1,116 clinical stool samples were enrolled and evaluated. Of these,
1,082 clinical specimens met the inclusion criteria. Of these 1,082 specimens, 1047
used C&S preservation medium, 34 used Cary Blair preservation medium, and the
preservation medium type was not specified for one specimen. Performance was
evaluated by comparing the performance of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test to reference
clinical microbiology protocols for the independent detection of Shiga toxin and the
E. coli O157 serotype. Combined results from the multi-site investigational study are
summarized in Tables 10 for Shiga toxin and the E. coli O157 serotype.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Clinical performance of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test was evaluated in a multi-site
prospective clinical study at five sites during a three-month period from June to
September 2015. A combined total of 1,116 stool samples were enrolled and evaluated.
Of these, 1,082 clinical specimens met the inclusion criteria and were used to evaluate the
performance of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test. The specimens were collected from 471
males and 611 females with ages ranging from less than one month old to greater than 85
years old. A total of 12 Shiga toxin positive samples were observed across all five test
sites (1.1%). Two (2) of the 12 Shiga toxin positive specimens were also positive for
O157 serotype (16.7%).
