L. Test Principle:
The VALIDATE® D-Dimer Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Kit is used to verify the
calibration of the D-dimer measuring range of the HemosIL® D-Dimer HS assay with IL
ACL TOP Family. The kit includes five levels of D-dimer. These five levels of D-Dimer are
provided to establish the relationship between theoretical and actual performance of the D-
Dimer analyte quantitatively. The Level 1 D-Dimer is configured to contain the lowest level
(lower limit) and Level 5 D-Dimer to contain the highest level (upper limit) of concentration
of D-Dimer of the measuring range. The intermediate levels (Level 2, Level 3, and Level 4)
are subsequently prepared from Level 1 and Level 5 by equal part dilutions following the
CLSI EP6-A guideline to measure intermediate levels of the measuring range. The typical
recovery target values for the five levels are:

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility study was conducted following the CLSI EP05-A2 guideline. The
study was performed utilizing three instruments and three operators testing one lot of
VALIDATE D-Dimer across three sites in five replicates per level with one run over 5
days. The study produced a combined total of 75 data points for each level with one lot
of HemosIL D-Dimer HS assay on three IL ACL TOP 500 analyzers. The
reproducibility study met the pre-specified acceptance criteria. Results from the study
are provided in the table below:

b. Precision/Repeatability:
The repeatability study was conducted testing three lots of VALIDATE D-Dimer at one
site on IL ACL TOP 500 with one lot of HemosIL D-Dimer HS assay over 20 days, two
runs per day, two replicates per run for Level 1 through Level 5 with a minimum of two
operators obtaining a total of 240 replicates for each level. The repeatability study met
the pre-determined acceptance criteria. Results from the study are provided in the table

c. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was determined using one lot of the VALIDATE D-Dimer Calibration
Verification/Linearity Test kit on the IL ACL TOP 500. The D-dimer concentrations
of each measured value of the five levels were plotted vs. five assigned levels of
concentration. The results are determined to be linear.
d. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability Study:
Freeze-Thaw Stability Study: The freeze and thaw vial stability study was carried out
by mimicking end user’s usage of the product on three lots of VALIDATE D-Dimer
Calibration Verification/Linearity Test kits. The study demonstrated that each level
of VALIDATE D-Dimer is stable up to four cycles of freeze and thaw when stored at
-10°C to -25°C. The study met the pre-determined acceptance criteria.
Closed Vial Stability Study: The closed vial stability study was conducted on three
lots of VALIDATE D-Dimer Calibration/Verification Linearity Test Kits at the
storage temperature of -10°C to -25°C. The study demonstrated that the VALIDATE

D-Dimer Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Kit is stable up to 9 months when
stored at -10°C to -25°C. The study met the pre-determined acceptance criteria.
Value Assignment/Recovery Data: The value assignment for the VALIDATE D-
Dimer Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Kit is obtained by testing Level 1
(lowest concentration) and Level 5 (highest concentration) of VALIDATE D-Dimer
in six replicates over 5 days to generate 30 replicates on one IL ACL TOP 500. The
value assignments for the intermediate levels (Level 2, Level 3 and Level 4) are
calculated based on an equal distance (delta) between levels. The value assignment
study met the pre-determined acceptance criteria.
