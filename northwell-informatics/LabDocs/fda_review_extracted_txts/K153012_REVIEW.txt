Sofia® Influenza A+B FIA
Influenza A+B immunological test system
G. Regulatory Information:
1. Regulation section:
21 CFR 866.3330, Influenza virus serological reagents
2. Classification:
Class I
3. Product code:

4. Panel:
Microbiology (83)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Sofia Influenza A+B FIA employs immunofluorescence to detect influenza A and
influenza B viral nucleoprotein antigens in nasal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, and
nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash in fresh or transport media specimens from symptomatic
patients. This qualitative test is intended for use as an aid in the rapid differential
diagnosis of acute influenza A and influenza B viral infections. The test is not intended
to detect influenza C antigens. A negative test is presumptive and it is recommended
these results be confirmed by virus culture or an FDA-cleared influenza A and B
molecular assay. Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infections and should
not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other management decisions. The test is
intended for professional and laboratory use.
Performance characteristics for influenza A and B were established during February
through March 2011 when influenza viruses A/California/7/2009 (2009 H1N1),
A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria-Like) were the
predominant influenza viruses in circulation according to the Morbidity and Mortality
Weekly Report from the CDC entitled "Update: Influenza Activity-United States, 2010-
2011 Season, and Composition of the 2011-2012 Influenza Vaccine". Performance
characteristics may vary against other emerging influenza viruses.
If infection with a novel influenza virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel
virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Virus
culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to
receive and culture specimens.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:

To be used only with the Sofia Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The Sofia Influenza A+B FIA employs immunofluorescence technology that is used
with the Sofia Analyzer to detect influenza virus nucleoproteins.
The Sofia Influenza A+B FIA is a lateral-flow immunoassay that uses monoclonal
antibodies that are specific for influenza antigens and have no known cross-reactivity to
normal flora or other known respiratory pathogens.
Nasal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, and nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash specimens are
used for this test. The patient specimen is placed in the Reagent Tube, during which
time the virus particles in the specimen are disrupted, exposing internal viral
nucleoproteins. After disruption, the specimen is dispensed into the cassette sample
well. From the sample well, the specimen migrates through a test strip containing
various unique chemical environments. If influenza viral antigen is present, they will be
trapped in a specific location. The Sofia Analyzer will scan the test strip and measure
the fluorescent signal by processing the results using method-specific algorithms. The
Sofia Analyzer will display the test results (Positive, Negative, or Invalid) on the
screen.

d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection (LoD)
LoD was established using two influenza A strains and two influenza B strains
diluted into a negative pooled clinical matrix. The clinical matrix consisted of
negative nasal swabs placed in M5 or universal transport media (UTM). The LoD
is defined as the lowest concentration (tissue culture infective dose, TCID /mL)
50
per sample that can be reproducibly detected 95% of the times or lowest
concentration at which 19 of 20 replicates were positive. Each strain was initially
tested in a range finding study using serial dilutions of virus concentrations near
the expected LoD in replicates of 10 per concentration of virus. LoD was
determined using a dose response curve and interpolating the C from the
95
plotting software interpolation function. Verification of the estimated LoD was
performed using a minimum of 20 replicates per strain. Strains tested were A/Port
Chalmers/1/73 (H3N2), A/New Jersey/8/76 (H1N1), B/Allen/45, and
B/Florida/07/2004.
Determined LoD concentrations as well as confirmation testing statistical data are
summarized in Table 2.

A prospective clinical study for Sofia Influenza A+B FIA was conducted during
February through March 2011 in the United States. A total of 17 intended use
clinical sites and three (3) reference laboratories participated in the study. Three
(3) different specimen types, nasal swab (NS), nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), and
nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash (NPA/W), were evaluated in this study. All
specimen types were tested fresh and after the sample had been suspended into
viral transport media (VTM) and transported to the corresponding reference

laboratory. Testing was performed at the time of the original clinical study but
data on specimens in VTM was not included in the previous submission
(K112177). The data is being supplied now in order to support the specimens in
VTM claim. All test results were compared to viral culture as the reference
method.
A total of 2152 subject specimens were available for use in the clinical study. Of
the 2152 eligible specimens, 2019 were included in the study (12 specimens had
no culture data available, 55 were excluded due to site protocol deviations, 65
specimens were lost from the device SD cards, and one (1) specimen was
excluded due to the instrument error). There were 28 invalid results as
determined by the subject device leaving 1991 valid specimens for analysis (665
nasal swabs, 688 nasopharyngeal swabs, and 638 NA/W specimens). There were
935 specimens collected from female subjects and 1036 from male subjects.
Collection and testing was performed at 17 geographically diverse locations
representing intended use sites (16 sites after exclusions).
Age distribution of the patients from whom the specimens were obtained was as
follows: 1410 (71%) of the specimens 5 years or younger; 439 (22%) from ages 6 to
21; 122 (6%) from ages 22 to 59; and 20 (1%) from ages 60 or older.
Sofia Influenza A+B FIA detected influenza A with a clinical sensitivity versus
culture of 83%, 91% and 97% when testing nasal swab, nasopharyngeal swabs,
or nasopharyngeal aspirates/washes in VTM, respectively (Table 3). The
specificity ranged from 97% to 98% across all sample types.
