L. Test Principle:
The HemosIL HIT-Ab kit is a latex particle enhanced immuno-turbidimetric assay to
(PF4-H)
detect total Anti PF4/Heparin (PF4/H) antibodies found in HIT patients. A monoclonal
antibody that mimics human HIT antibodies is coated onto latex particles. In the presence of
PF4 from human‐ platelets complexed to polyvinyl sulfonate (PVS), and the patient sample, a
competitive agglutination reaction occurs. The degree of agglutination is inversely
proportional to the concentration of antibodies in the sample and is determined by measuring
the decrease of transmitted light caused by the aggregates.
The Low and High HIT-Ab Controls contain different concentrations of humanized
(PF4-H)
monoclonal anti PF4 Heparin human IgG and are intended for the assessment of precision
and accuracy of the assay at PF4/H antibody levels at or below the cut off (Low control) and
at abnormal PF4‐/H an‐tibody le‐vels (High control).

AMR was established at standard range 0.6‒5.7 U/mL and at auto re-run range up to
16 U/mL. Two lots of the assay reagent were tested on ACL TOP 700, ACL TOP 500
CTS and ACLTOP 300 CTS instruments. Human plasma samples were used to assess
linearity across the claimed range.
Note: The HemosIL HIT-Ab assay is claimed as a qualitative assay with the
(PF4 H)
cut-off value at 1.0 U/mL. However, the assay output is quantitative in terms that the
numeric data is calculated based on the calibration curve. The medical technologist
will determine whether the quantitative data is below or above the cut-off value.
Onlyqualitative results (normal/abnormal) will be reported to physicians.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
Since an HIT International Standard is not currently available, an arbitrary unit
(U/mL) has been established.
HemosIL HIT Ab is standardized to a House Standard Calibrator diluted in Tris
(PF4H)
buffer containing bovine serum albumin (BSA), stabilizers and preservative. The
‐
value of the Ho‐use Standard Calibrator was set after studying a population of HIT
suspected samples. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis vs. Serotonin
Release Assay (SRA) showed a clear separation of negative and positive results with
optimal sensitivity and specificity using a cut off of 1 U/mL. The Primary Standard
was set at 5.7 U/mL (5.7 times the cut off). The Kit Calibrator (component of assay
test kit) is prepared and assigned versus the H‐ouse Standard Calibrator. An assigned
concentration is obtained by analyzing‐ the Kit Calibrator being manufactured
referenced to House Standard Calibrator over multiple runs, days and instruments.
The assigned concentration must fall within an acceptability range (5.7 ± 0.5 U/mL).
Stability
Reagent open vial stability, continuous on board stability and cumulative stability
testing was performed using three lots of HemosIL HIT-Ab kit reagents and
(PF4-H)
analyzed on a representative member of the ACL TOP 700 instrument.
Open-vial stability: 2 months at 2–8°C in the original vial.
Continuous on-board stability: up to 24 hours.
Cumulative on-board stability: 60 days when reagents are used for two 1-hour test
sessions on-board the ACL TOP Family and all vials are returned well-capped to
2–8°C between sessions.
The kit reagents do not survive a freeze/thaw cycle. Therefore the reagents are
shipped refrigerated at 2–8oC with a delta-track temperature monitor in each pack.
Control stability was tested using three lots of the HemosIL HIT-Ab Controls
(PF4-H)
(low and high).

--- Page 10 ---
Unopened controls are stable until the expiration date shown on the vial when
stored at 2–8°C. Do not freeze.
Stability after opening: 2 months at 2–8°C, 24 hours in the original vial when
placed continuously on-board the ACL TOP Family analyzers.
Cumulative on-board stability: When controls are used for 1 hour on-board per
test session and the vials are returned well-capped to 2–8°C between sessions; the
controls are stable for an on-board cumulative time of up to 8 hours. This
cumulative time on-board study was distributed over a period of 12 days.
For optimal stability, controls should be removed from the system and stored at
2–8°C in the original vial.
HemosIL HIT Ab Controls Low and High
(PF4H)
Value assignment: Th‐e values for HemosIL HIT Ab Controls are assigned with
‐ (PF4H)
respect to the House Standard Controls according to the internal protocol. The control
‐
value is lot-specific. ‐
Precision: Precision was assessed using three lots of HemosIL HIT-Ab Controls
(PF4-H)
(low and high) run on ACL TOP 700 analyzer, with a single lot of HemosIL HIT-
Ab reagent. Each level of control material from each lot was tested in duplicate,
(PF4-H)
twice a day for 20 days, for a total of 80 replicates per level per lot as summarized
below.

Heparin Sensitivity: 126 samples from non-HIT suspected, heparin treated patients
(either UFH or LMWH) were tested with the HemosIL HIT-Ab . For LMWH,
(PF4-H)
115 samples with a heparin concentration range between 0‒2.47 IU/mL were tested.
For UFH, 11 samples with a heparin concentration range between 0.04‒1.08 IU/mL
were tested. There was no dose-response correlation between the HIT results and
heparin (UFH and LMWH) concentrations.
Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS): Forty samples from patients diagnosed with APS
were tested with the HemosIL HIT-Ab . All 40 samples reported negative with
(PF4-H)
HemosIL HIT-Ab , demonstrating that the assay is not affected by APS
(PF4-H)
antibodies.
f. Assay cut-off:
Cut-off Determination: A method comparison with the Serotonin Release Assay
(SRA) performed on 63 plasma samples from HIT suspected patients (31 SRA
positive and 32 SRA negative) indicated that the optimal cut-off determined by ROC
analysis was 1.0 U/mL (95.2% Agreement, CI = 86.7%‒99.0%). Based on these
studies it was determined that for heparin treated patient samples, HemosIL HIT-
Ab(PF4-H) results equal to or higher than 1.0 U/mL may indicate the presence of HIT
antibodies.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
An in-house method comparison was performed on 118 frozen samples from HIT
suspected patients using a commercially available ELISA assay. The results
summarized below are based on a cut-off of 1.0 U/mL for the HemosIL HIT-Ab
(PF4-H)
assay.

vs. 3.8%) were conducted according to CLSI EP14-A2 Evaluation of matrix
effect; Approved Guideline, 2nd edition. The study demonstrated matrix
equivalence.
ii. A comparison study between fresh vs. frozen plasma samples demonstrated
matrix equivalence.
3. Clinical studies:
A multi-site clinical study was performed with a total of 639 patients suspected of HIT
and treated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and unfractionated heparin
(UFH), as well as fondaparinux. Studies were performed in three clinical sites located in
the United States. Testing included comparison of HemosIL HIT Ab to the
(PF4H)
Asserachrom HPIA Test Kit (K003767). The study was expanded to also test samples
‐
using Serotonin Release Assay (SRA) as the reference method. ‐
The performance of the HemosIL HIT Ab(PF4 H) assay with regard to the SRA method
was further evaluated in sub groups of HIT suspected patients categorized by pre test
probability (low and intermediate high‐). The pr‐e test probability of HIT was assessed
according to the 4T score cla‐ssification system, including: ‐
‐ ‐
- Thrombocytopenia
- Timing of platelet fall
- Thrombosis (or other sequelae of HIT)
- Absence of other causes of thrombocytopenia
Any patient with recent heparin exposure (within 100 days of antibody testing) from
various units within the hospital was considered eligible for enrollment in the study based
on HIT suspicion.
The results summarized below are based on a cut-off of 1.0 U/mL for the HemosIL HIT-
Ab assay and the manufacturer’s cut-off value for the ELISA.

results may be flagged as below linearity (< 0.6 U/mL). A set of studies was performed to
assess the optimal cut-off of HemosIL HIT-Ab on the ACL TOP Family systems as
(PF4-H)
described below.
Reference Interval – Heparin Exposed, HIT Suspected Patients (HIT Negative): A
population of 122 samples from HIT-suspected, but negative by a commercially available
ELISA was tested. The 95% reference interval was 0 – 0.9 U/mL.
Reference Interval – Healthy Donors: A population of 131 plasma samples from
apparently healthy individuals was tested. The 95% reference interval was 0–0.7 U/mL.
N. Instrument Name: ACL TOP Family
To demonstrate instrument model equivalence, a study was performed using 51 citrated
plasma samples from individual clinical patients suspected of having HIT. Each clinical
sample was analyzed in singlet with a single lot of HemosIL HIT-Ab reagents on
(PF4-H)
representative ACL TOP Family members: ACL TOP 700, ACL TOP 500 CTS and ACL
TOP 300 CTS. Samples were distributed along the measuring range. The results obtained
on the ACL TOP 700, the ACL TOP 500 CTS and the ACL TOP 300 CTS are
summarized below:
