LUMIPULSE G1200 System
I. Device Description:
The Lumipulse G TP-N is an assay system, including a set of immunoassay reagents, for the
qualitative detection of anti-TP antibodies (IgG and IgM) directed against Treponema
pallidum (TP) in human serum and plasma (sodium citrate or dipotassium EDTA) on the
LUMIPULSE G System. The assay is based on a Chemiluminescent Enzyme Immunoassay
(CLEIA) technology utilizing a two-step sandwich immunoassay method.
The LUMIPULSE G1200 is an automated immunoassay analyzer, capable of measuring
chemiluminescence generated by the chemical reaction of antibodies in patient specimens
binding to antigens in the test reagents. The critical reagents consist of ferrite microparticles
coated with recombinant TP antigens (Tp15-17 and TpN47), a conjugate of the antigens
labeled with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and a substrate solution. The anti-TP antibodies in
the specimen bind with the antigens coated on the particles to form immunocomplexes. A
2

--- Page 3 ---
washing step follows which removes any unbound materials. A second reaction is initiated
with the addition of the conjugated (ALP-labeled) antigens to form additional complexes. A
second wash cycle removes any unbound materials and a substrate solution is added
initiating a chemical reaction with emission of a luminescent signal. The luminescence (at
477 nm) is measured by the photometric detector. The amount of antibody in a specimen is
automatically calculated from the cutoff value (C), based on the calibration data. The results
are reported in cutoff index values (C.O.I.) and interpreted as reactive or nonreactive.

Sample Stability Studies
The stability of TP antibodies in serum (no additive), serum collected in serum separator
tubes (SST), dipotassium EDTA (K EDTA) plasma, and sodium citrate (Na citrate)
2
plasma was evaluated using paired samples from 30 blood donors. Each donor sample set
consisted of 4 tubes (serum (no additive), serum (SST), K EDTA plasma, and Na citrate
2
plasma). The samples were spiked with a highly TP-reactive sample to the following
target concentrations:
• 3 matched sample sets spiked targeting C.O.I. of 5.0
• 12 matched sample sets spiked targeting C.O.I. of 0.8
• 12 matched sample sets spiked targeting C.O.I. of 1.3
• 3 matched sample sets were left unspiked
Baseline measurements were established on the day of the draw (Day 0) for use as the
control.
The stability of TP antibodies in serum (no additive), serum (SST), K EDTA plasma and
2
Na citrate plasma samples was evaluated at the following storage conditions for the
indicated time periods:
• Refrigerated stability (at 2-10°C) ≤ 4 days
Time points tested: Day 0, Day 1, Day 3, Day 4 and Day 5

The acceptance criteria were defined as:
• The qualitative status of nonreactive samples should remain unchanged at each
time point and each condition, relative to Day 0.
• The qualitative status of reactive samples should remain unchanged at each time
point and each condition, relative to Day 0.
Additionally, the mean C.O.I. value for each positive sample and the mean percent
difference for the mean C.O.I. value for each sample at each time point relative to Day 0
were calculated and presented in the submission.
The results supported sample stability as shown:
Sample Type 2-10°C 25°C (+/- 2°C) -20°C (+/- 10°C)
Serum (no additive) 4 days 3 days 14 days
Serum (SST) 4 days 3 days 14 days
K EDTA plasma 4 days 3 days 14 days
2
Na citrate plasma 4 days 3 days 14 days
An additional study was conducted to evaluate freeze thaw stability of the TP antibodies
in serum (no additive), serum (SST), K EDTA plasma, and sodium citrate plasma
2
samples. The study utilized matched sample sets from 60 blood donors. Each donor
sample set consisted of 4 tubes (serum (no additive), serum (SST), K EDTA plasma and
2
sodium citrate plasma). The samples were spiked with a highly TP-reactive sample to the
following target concentrations:
• 4 matched sample sets spiked targeting C.O.I. of 5.0
• 21 matched sample sets spiked targeting C.O.I. of 0.8
• 21 matched sample sets spiked targeting C.O.I. of 1.3
• 10 matched sample sets spiked targeting C.O.I. of 2.0
• 4 matched sample sets were left unspiked
The samples were aliquoted and baseline measurements were established on the day of
the draw (Day 0). The samples were placed in the freezer at ≤ -20°C. Each freeze/thaw
cycle consisted of ≥ 30 minutes at ≥ -20°C; each sample was visually inspected to
confirm that the sample was frozen. Samples were tested in triplicate after 1, 5, 7, and 10
freeze/thaw cycles.
The results were evaluated for their qualitative status (negative or positive). In addition,
the mean C.O.I. value for each sample was calculated at freeze/thaw cycles 1, 5, 7, and
10 and the mean percent difference in C.O.I. value was calculated for each sample, at
each cycle, relative to the mean C.O.I. value of the unfrozen sample. The data showed
that all nonreactive samples, for serum (no additive), serum (SST), and Na citrate plasma,
remained nonreactive after all freeze/thaw cycles. Similarly, all samples spiked to a
C.O.I. of ≥ 1.0 were reactive after all freeze/thaw cycles for serum (no additive), serum
(SST), and Na citrate plasma. The results for the K EDTA plasma were not acceptable as
2
a change in reactivity was observed at various freeze/thaw cycles.

The results of the study support a claim of freeze/thaw stability up to 10 times for the
following samples: serum (no additive), serum (SST), and Na citrate plasma. The
Lumipulse G TP-N labeling bears a statement that K EDTA plasma samples should not
2
be frozen and thawed.
On-board Stability
The stability of TP antibodies in serum and sodium citrate plasma samples left on the
instrument before testing was evaluated using a panel of 7 samples (C.O.I. values 0.2,
0.8, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, and 7.7). The samples were pipetted into sample cups and placed on the
sample rack unit. The baseline measurements were established (Time 0) and the samples
were retested after 3 hours and after 5 hours. Each sample was tested in triplicate. The
results were evaluated for the qualitative status of each sample (reactive/nonreactive) and
the mean percent difference of the mean C.O.I. value for each sample at each time point
relative to Time 0 was calculated. The results showed no change in the reactivity status of
any of the samples up to 5 hours and the mean percent difference of reactive specimens,
relative to Time 0, ranged from 0% to 8%. The data support the Lumipulse G TP-N on-
board sample stability of up to 5 hours.
On-clot Stability
An additional study was conducted to establish stability of TP antibodies in on-the-clot
serum samples when held at 40°C prior to testing with the Lumipulse G TP-N assay. The
tested sample sets are described above. The baseline measurements were established on
the day of draw. The sample tubes, on clot, were placed at 40°C for continuous storage.
The samples were evaluated on day 5 and were tested in triplicate with the Lumipulse G
TP-N assay.
The results were analyzed by calculating the percent difference of the mean of the
measurements after the storage, for each sample type (matrix), as compared to the mean
of the measurements on day 0 (baseline). The criteria for acceptable stability were:
• The status of nonreactive (negative) samples should remain unchanged.
• The status of reactive (positive) samples should remain unchanged
The results showed that although the reactive status for all samples remained unchanged
after 5 and 6 days of storage at 40°C, the observed percent difference in the means of the
measurements, for the samples tested, ranged from -14% to 0% on day 5 and from -15%
to -7% on day 6. The following statement and precaution were added to the package
insert:
Serum samples kept on the clot and stored under ambient temperatures (not to exceed
40oC) must be tested within 5 days of collection. However, it is recommended that
separated serum be removed from the clot as soon as possible. In analytical studies, a
loss of reactivity ranging from 7-14% was observed when on-the-clot serum samples
were held at 40°C for 5 days; although no change in positivity was observed for the low
positive samples in the study, a false negative result in clinical samples with low antibody
10

levels is possible.
Hook Effect
The sponsor conducted a study to demonstrate that the assay is not susceptible to the
Hook effect where high levels of antibodies may interfere with the formation of the
immune complexes, giving false nonreactive results. Highly reactive serum sample and
plasma sample (C.O.I. ~ 400) were serially diluted with a nonreactive human serum or
plasma, respectively. All samples (dilutions) were tested in triplicate. The mean signal
values and the mean C.O.I. values were calculated for each dilution. The results showed
that there was no increase in signal at any dilution when comparing to the signal from the
dilution immediately preceding. The study demonstrated that the assay is not subject to
Hook effect in samples with TP antibody levels up to C.O.I. values of 350.
Carryover
The LUMIPULSE G1200 System uses disposable tips for sampling specimens preventing
carryover (analyte contamination) between samples. Additionally, the cartridge design
allows for each sample to be analyzed in its own reaction well further preventing a
possibility of contamination from a previous sample.
Reactivity with IgG and IgM Treponemal Antibodies
The ability of the Lumipulse G TP-N assay to detect both IgG and IgM type treponemal
antibodies was evaluated by testing six syphilis positive human sera known to contain
measurable levels of both types of treponemal antibodies. A sample containing only IgG
type antibodies was included in the study as an IgG control.
All test samples were analyzed with the T. pallidum IgM ELISA kit according to the
package insert and all samples had quantifiable IgM values, while the IgG control sample
did not have quantifiable IgM. The samples were then tested in triplicate on the
LUMIPULSE G1200, using the Lumipulse G TP-N assay to determine the reactivity of
each sample (C.O.I. = total IgG and IgM values). Next, all samples were treated with
BUF059 IgG/RF Stripper solution as directed in the package insert, to remove all IgG.
Following the stripping procedure all samples were tested with the T. pallidum IgG
ELISA kit to determine the sample IgG values and to ensure that samples were stripped
of IgG. The test samples and the IgG control sample were then analyzed in triplicate with
the Lumipulse G TP-N assay to determine the reactivity (C.O.I. = IgM value). The test
samples remained reactive in the Lumipulse G TP-N assay after IgG depletion with
C.O.I. values >1.0, while the IgG control sample became nonreactive after IgG depletion,
demonstrating that the Lumipulse G TP-N assay detects both types of TP antibodies.

Not applicable.

Interference
Lumipulse G TP-N assay was evaluated for potential interference from endogenous
substances and from therapeutic drugs in a study consistent with the guidelines in the
CLSI Protocol EP7-A2.11 Five human serum pools were prepared at the following
targeted TP concentrations:
Panel Sample Information Composition Target C.O.I
1 Negative Serum Native Human Serum 0.1.
2 Low Positive Serum Native Human Serum 1.3-1.6
3 Moderate Positive Serum Native Human Serum 2.0-5.0
4 Moderate Positive Plasma Native Human Sodium Citrate Plasma 2.0-5.0
5 High Positive Serum Native Human Serum 7.0-22.0
Stock solutions of the selected interferents were prepared at high concentrations in
appropriate diluents to minimize the volume used for spiking. Each sample was split into
two equal aliquots for each interferent, where one aliquot was spiked with the interferent
stock solution, while the other aliquot was spiked with an equal volume of the stock
diluent. All samples were tested in triplicate with the Lumipulse G TP-N assay.
The results were evaluated by calculating the percent difference in C.O.I. between the
spiked and unspiked (control) samples. The acceptance criteria were set such that all
positive (reactive) samples must demonstrate ≤10% change in C.O.I. and the reactivity
status of nonreactive (negative) samples should remain negative.
All substances tested demonstrated < 10% change in the mean C.O.I. for positive
(reactive) samples. The reactivity status of negative (nonreactive) samples remained
unchanged. The study showed that the Lumipulse G TP-N assay is not susceptible to
interference from the endogenous substances at the concentrations tested, as shown
below:

f. Assay cut-off:
The luminescence of the primary calibrator for the Lumipulse G TP-N assay was
originally set to obtain concordance with the Serodia TP-PA assay results. The cutoff was
initially determined by ROC analysis of results obtained from testing 417 specimens with
values assigned using Serodia TP-PA assay (312 nonreactive, 99 reactive and 6
intermediate). First, the Index Value was calculated based on the ratio of the
luminescence of the assay sample to the luminescence of the positive calibrator, when run
on the Lumipulse G TP-N assay. The cutoff point was selected as that Index Value that
provided for a 100% sensitivity and specificity among the specimens tested. The
Lumipulse G TP-N results are expressed as a cutoff index (C.O.I.) value. The C.O.I. for a
specimen is calculated using the following formula:
C.O.I. = S / C
S = luminescence of specimen (assay sample)
C = (luminescence of TP-N Positive Calibrator) x 0.12*
*The luminescence at the cut-off point was determined to be 12% of the Lumipulse G
TP-N Positive Calibrator.
The analytically selected cutoff was further validated in a clinical study in the intended
use population.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The results of the Lumipulse G TP-N assay were compared to a composite comparator
based on an algorithm of results obtained from three commercially available syphilis
assays: (a) treponemal chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (EIA), a nontreponemal
Rapid Plasma Reagin assay [RPR], and a second treponemal assay (Treponema pallidum
Particle Agglutination [TP-PA]). Additional details of how the final comparator result
was determined are provided below in the “Clinical Studies” section.

b. Matrix comparison:
The suitability of various blood collection tube types for use with the Lumipulse G TP-N
assay was evaluated in an analytical study. Venous blood samples were obtained from 60
donors in matched sets in the following vacutainer tube types:
• Serum (no additive)-used as the control
• Serum separator
• K EDTA
2
• Lithium heparin
• Sodium heparin
• Sodium citrate
Each matched set of samples (serum and plasma) was tested with the Lumipulse G TP-N
assay within 8 hours of collection. Four sets of 12 samples were spiked with a highly
reactive TP stock solution to the following target C.O.I. values: 0.8, 1.3, 2.0, and 5.0. One
set of 12 samples was left unspiked. Each sample was tested in duplicate. A mean C.O.I
was calculated for each sample. The tube type was acceptable if the slope of the
correlation between the given tube and the control (serum) is within the 0.9 - 1.1 range.
The sponsor performed a weighted Deming regression analysis to evaluate the difference
in results across tube types (SST serum, K EDTA plasma, lithium heparin plasma,
2
sodium heparin plasma, and sodium citrate plasma) versus the results of the control
samples (serum).

Based on the results it was determined that the 95 % CI for the slope for lithium heparin
and sodium heparin plasma exceeds the range between the acceptance range of 0.9 and
1.1. Similarly, the data showed that lithium heparin and sodium heparin plasma tube
types present a significantly higher bias when compared to the serum tube type control
than the SST, K EDTA plasma, and sodium citrate plasma tube types, based on a sample
2
size of 60 individual donors. It was determined that lithium heparin and sodium heparin
plasma are not suitable for analysis with the Lumipulse G TP-N assay.
Based on the data, the following samples may be used for analysis with the Lumipulse G
TP-N assay:
• Serum (no additive)
• SST serum
• K EDTA plasma

3. Clinical Studies:
In a multi-center clinical study, samples from a total of 2791 subjects were submitted for
testing. Among those, there were 1316 specimens prospectively collected from the
intended use population and 1475 specimens that were pre-selected from a retrospective
collection. After exclusion of 26 specimens from the prospective collection (due to
hemolyzed/lipemic samples, lack of test results, protocol exclusions, and exclusions
based on subject data review) and three samples from pre-selected retrospective

collection (due to lack of test results), there were a total of 1290 (46%) evaluable
prospective samples and a total of 1472 (54%) evaluable retrospective samples. The
study samples were tested at four clinical sites.
The prospective collection consisted of specimens collected sequentially from all patients
prescribed a laboratory test for syphilis between defined periods of time. The specimens
were collected from seven sites representing different geographical regions of the US
including both low prevalence sites and high prevalence sites.
The retrospective samples included specimens from 379 pregnant women, 520 HIV
positive subjects (298 remnant samples from reference laboratories and 222 collected at a
research facility), 130 known to be T. pallidum (TP)-reactive by previous laboratory
testing, 68 samples collected at a research facility from patients clinically diagnosed with
syphilis, as well as 375 samples consisting of remnants of specimens sent to a laboratory
for routine syphilis testing.
Additionally, 289 samples from subjects with well-characterized medically diagnosed
syphilis and 474 samples from apparently healthy subjects, including 75 pediatric and
399 adult/not pregnant subjects were tested with the Lumipulse G TP-N assay.
Comparison of Results
The clinical performance of the Lumipulse G TP-N was evaluated by comparing the
assay results with the comparator result based on an algorithm of results from three FDA
cleared tests: a treponemal test (EIA), a nontreponemal Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) test,
and a second treponemal test, Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) assay.
Because the clinical diagnosis of syphilis must be supported by two reactive laboratory
tests, consisting of a treponemal assay and a nontreponemal assay, or at least two
treponemal assays, employing an algorithm of three syphilis tests to determine the
comparator result presents the most comprehensive picture of the syphilis serological
status.
The clinical performance of the Lumipulse G TP-N assay was determined by calculating
percent agreement between the Lumipulse G TP-N result and the Final Comparator
Result. The Final Comparator Result was determined using a two out of three rule (EIA,
RPR, and TP-PA). In cases where the EIA result was “equivocal” (as per the device
labeling), and the TP-PA result was “inconclusive”, the Final Comparator Result could
not be determined; those results would be excluded from the final analysis (there were no
indeterminate final comparator results in this study). The table below shows how the final
comparator result was determined.

Performance of the Lumipulse G TP-N assay with Prospective Samples
The age range for the 1290 evaluable subjects was 18 to 92 with a median age of 42. The
population contained more male subjects compared to female subjects (66% vs. 34%,
respectively). Subjects were from different locations across the US. Each of those
specimens was analyzed with the Lumipulse G TP-N assay and with the three reference
assays.

Performance in Medically Diagnosed Individuals
The performance of the Lumipulse G TP-N assay was evaluated with samples from
subjects who were medically diagnosed with primary, secondary, or latent syphilis. The
diagnosis of syphilis and the stage of the disease were made by a licensed physician
based on the patient’s clinical symptoms, medical history and laboratory test results at the
time of the diagnosis. The 289 subjects evaluated ranged in age from 18 to 78 with a
median age of 44. Subjects were from Argentina (52%) and Florida (48%). The
reactivity of the Lumipulse G TP-N assay with samples from subjects medically
diagnosed with syphilis is presented by the disease stage and the treatment status.

conducting various processes such as sample aspiration and dispensing, agitation, timed
incubation and photometric measurement.
There are two primary software components that make up the Lumipulse G TP-N
Immunoassay:
1. The Lumipulse G TP-N Assay Definition File (ADF), and
2. The LUMIPULSE G System software.
The ADF is a file that contains assay specific-parameters and interpretive criteria including
the sequence of steps by which a given assay is executed.
The LUMIPULSE G System software interprets information from the Lumipulse G TP-N
ADF to direct how the LUMIPULSE G instrument interacts with the assay.
The LUMIPULSE G1200 instrument platform was originally cleared under K142895.
1. Modes of Operation:
This is a fully automated immunoassay analyzer.
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ________ or No ___X_____
2. Software:
The current version of the LUMIPULSE G1200 system software is v3.21.
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
The LUMIPULSE G System software is the computer program that interprets system and
assay information, calculates results, and provides the interface for controlling the system
hardware. The software interface is the portion of the computer program which a user
operates to make selections and enter information. The interface allows users to initiate
commands or make choices by selecting icons, buttons, items from lists, etc. The
LUMIPULSE G System software interface is designed to provide consistent and easy
access to system information, software functions, and troubleshooting.
25

--- Page 26 ---
3. Specimen Identification:
Patient samples are barcoded and barcodes are read by the instrument. The assay to be
performed can be identified by manual entry of the patient ID number and associated
information or information can be imported from a host computer.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimen processing is automated. Sample containers are set in Sample Racks. Barcode
IDs attached to sample container are read, along with the type of Sample rack and Rack
ID. The operator follows the system prompts and inputs the appropriate sample, rack, and
assay information. The LUMIPULSE G System automatically performs various
processes including dispensing, agitation, washing, photometric measurement, and result
calculation.
Two methods of designating the assay to be performed are:
1. Rack ID assay, in which the entire rack of samples is tested by one assay (sample
position in the rack is manually entered), and
2. Patient ID assay, in which each sample is individually designated for its own assay.
The Rack ID assay is conducted according to the Rack ID and rack position where
samples are registered during the sample registration process. Samples are manually set
in the positions in the rack where they are registered.
The Patient ID assay is conducted according to the Patient ID barcode on the sample
containers. Sample containers can be set in any position of any rack.
5. Calibration:
Calibration is required after assay installation and entails generation of an active
calibration curve. Assays do not need to be calibrated every time they are run; however,
certain variables make recalibration necessary. Calibration must be performed when a
new reagent lot is used, when 60 days elapsed since the previous calibration, when the
controls are out of range, and when documentation accompanying a new version of an
existing assay states that calibration is required.
6. Quality Control:
Quality control is addressed by running external controls with at least two levels, e.g.,
negative or nonreactive, and positive or reactive. Quality control material is not provided
with the assay.
