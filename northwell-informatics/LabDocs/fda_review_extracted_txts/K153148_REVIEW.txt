SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
OIR Decision Summary
To: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention RE: K153148
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own Class
II devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device.
CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit
(K141859)
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in
its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for
use, package labeling.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including to demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL
SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.
This device modification involved small changes to the primers and probes of the assay. The gene
target and location of the primers has not changed from the predicated device. The diagnostic panel
includes two assays H5a and H5b. Three primers and 1 probe were added to the H5a assay in
addition to minor nucleotide changes to adapt the assay to the evolution of the highly pathogenic
avian influenza A/H5. One primer was added to the H5b assay and minor nucleotide changes were
made. Additionally the fluorescent probe quencher chemistry was changed to use the ZEN™ and
Iowa Black® FQ quenchers on the probes included in the H5a and H5b assays.
To show that there was no impact on the performance of the assay with the modifications listed above
a limit of detection study, analytical inclusivity study, analytical cross-reactivity study with non H5
influenza A viruses and microorganisms, and a small mock clinical study were conducted.
Limit of Detection Study:
Analytical sensitivity of the Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit was demonstrated by determining the LoD
using Quanta qScriptTM and Invitrogen SuperScriptTM enzyme kits. The LoD for each primer and
probe set was confirmed by testing extraction replicates (n=20) of the highest virus dilution where
≥95% of all replicates tested positive. Virus dilutions were prepared in virus transport medium
containing human A549 cells to emulate clinical specimen matrix. The lowest concentration where
the InfA and both H5a and H5b primer and probe sets demonstrate uniform detection was reported
as the LoD. The results are summarized in the table below.

Analytical Sensitivity-Inclusivity Testing:
Inclusivity testing was conducted to demonstrate the capability of the modified oligonucleotide
primers and probes in the Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit to detect strains of influenza A/H5 viruses
(Asian lineage) representative of different geographic locations and phylogenetic clades at or near
the established LoD. Inclusivity testing was performed with sixteen representative H5 viruses
(Asian lineage). A virus of the phylogenetic clade 2.2.2.1 was unavailable for testing therefore
reactivity of the probes with A/Bangladesh/3222/2011 was performed in silico. The remaining fifteen
viruses were grown to high titer, harvested, and serially diluted to near the LoD of the assays. The
diluted influenza A/H5 viruses were extracted and tested in triplicate with the InfA, H5a, and H5b
assays to demonstrate reactivity. Inclusivity of the Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit was evaluated with
both enzyme systems (i.e. Invitrogen SuperScript™ and Quanta qScript™) and one cleared
extraction method.
The Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit was reactive with all H5 (Asian lineage) isolates that were tested
and predicted to be reactive with the influenza A/Bangladesh/3222/2011 based on the in silico
analyses.
Analytical Specificity – Cross-Reactivity
Cross-reactivity of the Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit was evaluated by testing influenza A viruses of
different types and subtypes that include viruses representing diverse geographic locations and
different sources. Samples were tested in triplicate using RNA extracted from high titer
preparations of viruses (≥ 106 EID50/mL). Cross-reactivity testing of the Influenza A/H5 Subtyping
Kit was evaluated with the Invitrogen SuperscriptTM enzyme system and one cleared extraction
method. The results showed no cross-reactivity with any non-influenza A H5 virus strains.
An exclusivity study was performed to demonstrate the specificity of each primer and probe set of
the Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit when tested with common non-influenza human respiratory
viruses, respiratory bacteria, and commensal organisms of the human respiratory tract. Nucleic
acids were purified from thirty-five (35) non-influenza organisms (16 viruses, 18 bacteria, and 1
yeast) representing common respiratory pathogens or flora commonly present in specimens
collected from the human nasopharynx region. High titer preparations of bacteria and yeast,
generally greater than or equal to106 cfu/mL, and non-influenza respiratory virus preparations at
concentrations greater than 106 TCID50/mL were tested (except in cases where production of high
titer virus stock was not possible). The Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit was evaluated with the
Invitrogen SuperscriptTM enzyme system and one cleared extraction method. No cross-reactivity
was detected with any of the organisms tested.
Mock Clinical Study
The clinical performance of oligonucleotide primer and probe sets of the Influenza A/H5 Subtyping
Kit were evaluated using contrived samples of grown virus added to an A549 cell suspension to
simulate positive clinical samples. A total of fifty positive contrived samples at high, moderate, and
low concentrations were evaluated. In addition, sixty-five specimens that tested negative for
influenza A with the CDC Human Influenza rRT-PCR Diagnostic Panel that were obtained from a
clinical study conducted during the 2011-2012 influenza season were evaluated. Testing was
performed with both enzymes cleared for use with the kit. The results are summarized in the table
below.

Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a
season when seasonal influenza viruses A/H1 and A/H3 were the
predominant influenza A viruses in circulation and during a season when the
A/H1pdm09 influenza virus was the predominant influenza A virus in
circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging
influenza A viruses.
Testing with the influenza H5a and H5b primer and probe sets should not
be performed unless the patient meets the most current U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services (DHHS) clinical and epidemiologic criteria
for testing suspect A/H5 specimens. The definitive identification of
influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) either directly from patient specimens or
from virus cultures requires additional laboratory testing, along with clinical
and epidemiological assessment in consultation with national influenza
surveillance experts.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be
used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
Conversely, positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection
with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of
disease.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current
clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public
health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection
control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or
local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted
unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.
All users, analysts, and any person reporting results from use of this device
should be trained to perform and interpret the results from this procedure by a
competent instructor prior to use. CDC Influenza Division will limit the
distribution of this device to only those users who have successfully completed a

The results of the analysis indicated hazardous situations could arise as a result of the
modifications and risk control measures should be implemented. A protocol was developed
to perform analytical and clinical performance testing (as detailed in section 3) to mitigate the
risk of hazardous situations occurring. The results of the testing reduced the probability of
occurrence and the risk to the negligible.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use
for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular
modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices
demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the
design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the
device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
