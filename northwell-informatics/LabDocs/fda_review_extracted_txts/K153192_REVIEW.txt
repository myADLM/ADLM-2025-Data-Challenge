The multi test panels can consist of up to fourteen (14) of the above listed analytes in any
combination. Only one cutoff concentration will be included per analyte per device. The
tests are intended for prescription and Over-The-Counter (OTC) use.
The tests provide only a preliminary result. A more specific alternative chemical method
must be used in order to obtain a confirmed assay result. Gas Chromatography / Mass
Spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) are the
preferred confirmatory methods. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should

L. Test Principle:
The devices are rapid lateral flow immunoassays in which drug-protein conjugates in the test
device compete with drugs or drug metabolites that may be present in urine. On each test
strip, a drug-protein conjugate is added to the test band of the membrane – known as the test
region (T), and the anti-drug antibody-colloidal gold conjugate pads are placed at the forward
end of the membrane. If target drugs are present in the urine specimen below its cut-off
concentration, the solution of the colored antibody-colloidal gold conjugates moves along
with the sample solution by capillary action across the membrane to the immobilized drug-
protein conjugate zone on the test band region. The colored antibody-gold conjugates then
complexes with the drug-protein conjugates to form visible lines. Therefore, the formation of
the visible precipitant in the test band indicates a negative result. If the target drug level
exceeds its cut-off concentration, the drug/metabolite antigen competes with drug protein
conjugates on the test band region for the limited antibody on the colored drug antibody-
colloidal gold conjugate pad. The drug will saturate the limited antibody binding sites and the
colored antibody-colloidal gold conjugate cannot bind to the drug-protein conjugate at the
test region of the test strip. Therefore, absence of the color band on the test region indicates a
preliminary positive result. A band should form in the control region (C) of the devices
regardless of the presence of drug in the sample to indicate that the test has been performed
properly.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. These devices are intended for qualitative use only.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability: Device stability has been evaluated through accelerated and real-time
studies. The real-time studies are ongoing. Protocols and acceptance criteria were
described and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims that the devices are
stable for two years (24 months) when stored at 2–30º C.
Quality control: Control materials are not supplied with the devices; however the
labeling provides information on how to obtain quality control materials.
d. Detection limit:
See Precision/Reproducibility section in M.1.a above.
e. Analytical specificity:
For each drug and cutoff, specificity was evaluated by spiking various concentrations
of similarly structured drug compounds into drug-free urine. Results are expressed as
a minimum concentration of metabolite or compound required to produce a response
approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay. The percent cross-
reactivity of those compounds is listed below:

The sponsor also evaluated the potential for positive and negative interference from
non-structurally related compounds, endogenous compounds, pH, and specific
gravity. The structurally unrelated compounds and endogenous substances study was
performed by spiking structurally unrelated compounds and endogenous substances at
a concentration of 100 μg/mL into urine samples containing drug at ± 25% of the
respective drug cutoff concentrations.
The following substances showed no positive or negative interference in this study:
Albumin Creatinine Riboflavin
Bilirubin Glucose Sodium Chloride
Cholesterol Hemoglobin Uric Acid
Acetaminophen Diphenylhydantoin Octopamine
Acetone Dopamine Oxalic Acid
Acetylsalicylic Acid Erythromycin Papaverine
Amoxicillin Estradiol Penicillin-G

Apomorphine Ethanol Phenelzine

To evaluate the effect of pH value on the test results, urine controls at ± 25% of the
cutoff value were used. Each control level was adjusted by either 1N NaOH solution
or 1N HCl to pH levels of 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0 and 9.0.
Each test sample was tested in duplicate.
To evaluate the effect of specific gravity, urine controls at ± 25% of the cutoff values
were spiked with deionized water or sugar to obtain specific gravities of 1.001, 1.010,
1.015, 1.020, 1.025, and 1.030. Each test sample was tested in duplicate.
The results demonstrated that pH and specific gravity do not affect the results from
the device.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration appears in the precision section, M.1.a., above.
2. Comparison studies:
The sponsor performed a method comparison study comparing performance of the test
strips of the cup devices to the GC/MS reference method. Results are summarized
below:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:

b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. These devices are for use with urine samples only.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
A consumer study was performed for all analytes to evaluate the ability of untrained
users to interpret the devices properly when given only the labeling (package insert)
provided with the devices. One hundred and thirty (130) lay-users participated in this
study from three (3) intended user sites with GC/MS confirmed urine samples in the
following concentration ranges: negative, 50%, 75%, 125% and 150% of the cutoff.
Samples were created by spiking drugs into drug-free urine pool. Each sample was
aliquoted into an individual blind-labeled container. Each lay-user was provided with
a package insert in English only and up to two (2) random blind labeled samples with
the tests of each device format. The results are summarized below:
