SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
OIR Decision Summary
To: THE FILE RE: K153223
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own
Class II device requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:
1. The names and 510(k) numbers of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device.
K132238 – ProParaFlu®+ Assay, Hologic, Inc.
K091053 – ProParaFlu®+ Assay, Prodesse, Inc.
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in
its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for
use.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION, including a statement that the FUNDAMENTAL
SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.
Changes to the labeling include adding “Rx only” under the IVD symbol on the first page of the
Instructions for Use and updating the Limitations section of the Instructions for Use regarding limited
reactivity with the 2014 CAP sample ID2-08 and the 2015 CAP sample ID2-02. The following
limitation was included: “The ProParaflu+ assay has limited reactivity with the 2014 CAP sample ID2-
08 and the 2015 CAP sample ID2-02. Sequencing analysis of the CAP samples revealed that the
HPIV3 target sequences of the CAP samples match the sequence of HPIV3/Homo
sapiens/PER/FLU8889/2007 strain in GenBank (GenBank Accession # KJ672604), and the limited
reactivity is most likely due to a viral mutation in the probe binding region. Negative results may be
obtained for samples containing this variant especially at low titers. If the ProParaflu+ assay does not
indicate a positive result when an HPIV-3 infection is suspected, the specimen should be retested for
HPIV-3 using an independent method (e.g. cell culture or molecular IVD)”.
The fundamental scientific technology of the modified device has not changed.

5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the
device and its components, and the results of the analysis
The risks of potentially missing the variant strain of the HPIV-3 virus, HPIV3/Homo
sapiens/PER/FLU8889/2007 when testing with the ProParaflu+ Assay were evaluated by
reviewing the Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) that had been performed during product
development to determine whether the Instructions for Use (IFU) update creates new risks or
failure modes or affects the risk priority number (RPN) value.
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities
required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied
No new risks were identified for testing HPIV3/Homo sapiens/PER/FLU8889/2007 with the
ProParaflu+ Assay. All RPNs were in categories “As Low As Reasonably Possible” (ALARP) or
“Low Risk Category” and therefore, no additional risk control activities were necessary. No
additional concerns of safety and efficacy were identified.

No device modifications were made. The Limitations section of the ProParaflu+ Assay IFU was
updated to include a statement of limited reactivity with select HPIV-3 strains as described in
section 3 above. To monitor for additional mutations over time, a monthly query will be performed
against GenBank to retrieve all sequences for HPIV that encompass the target region and
generate alignments against the sequences in production designs.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use
for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular
modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices
demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the
design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the
device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
