iHealth Align Glucose Meter (BG1)
I. Device Description:
The iHealth Align Gluco-Monitoring System (BG1) consists of a blood glucose meter, single
use test strips, sterile lancets, lancing device, and control solutions. The test system is based
on an electrochemical biosensor and the principal of capillary action. Capillary action at the
end of the test strip draws the blood into the test chamber and the blood glucose result is
displayed in 5 seconds. Control solution is available to be used to test the performance of the
device. The iHealth Align blood glucose meter must be used with a compatible mobile
device (either iOS or Android). A mobile app installed on the mobile device serves as the
display for the iHealth Align blood glucose meter. The iHealth Align blood glucose meter
must be plugged into a compatible mobile device via the 3.5mm audio port, and the iHealth
mobile app must be running in order for a blood glucose measurement to be performed; a
measurement cannot be performed if the iHealth Align blood glucose meter is not connected
to the audio port on the mobile device with the mobile app running.

L. Test Principle:
The iHealth Align Gluco-Monitoring System (BG1) measures glucose amperometrically. The
reaction of glucose oxidase and an electron mediator in the test strip with glucose in the sample
produces an electrical current which is proportional to the amount of glucose in the sample. The
meter measures the current and converts it to the corresponding glucose concentration, which is
displayed by the iHealth mobile app.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The device is a modification of a cleared BG1 meter (k133790) to connect and provide the
User Interface with Android mobile devices using the same test strip and control cleared with
the BG1 meter in k133790. The meter, strip and analytical module are unchanged. The
sponsor conducted necessary validation of the device, such as human factors testing and
bench testing (see Section P).

--- Page 11 ---
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm,
forearm, calf, and thigh only. The sample is applied directly to the test strip and testing is
performed immediately. Sample storage is not required.
5. Calibration:
Calibration of the meter occurs by scanning of a 2D barcode (QR Code) located on the
top of the test strip vial by the built in camera of a smartphone that is used in conjunction
with the device. The QR code must be scanned each time a new vial is opened.
6. Quality Control:
Three levels of aqueous glucose control solutions are available with this system (level 1,
level 2, level 3) but must be purchased separately. The meter automatically recognizes
control materials as separate from patient samples and identifies them as control in the
smartphone application where meter values are displayed and recorded. Controls are not
included in patient glucose averaging. Recommendations on when to test the control
materials and troubleshooting steps if the controls are outside of specifications are
provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test
strip vial label.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit study: As established in k110017, the claimed hematocrit range is 20-60%
2. Altitude study: As established in k110017, the claimed altitude is 10,744 ft.
3. Infection Control Study: The iHealth Align Gluco-Monitoring System (BG1) is intended
for single-patient use. The sponsor stated that the disinfection efficacy for the meter was
established in k123935 and that the materials comprising the candidate meter are
identical. CaviWipes Disinfecting Towelettes (EPA registration #46781-8) were
previously validated through disinfection efficacy studies demonstrating complete
inactivation of hepatitis B (HBV) virus using materials comprising the meter.
Robustness testing was previously established in k133790 demonstrating that there was
no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter after 11,000 cleaning
and disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting wipe)
to simulate 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions
11

--- Page 12 ---
for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
The sponsor provides a disposable sleeve for use with the mobile device to be used with
each test strip, not to be reused and to be disposed of as bio-hazard, therefore no
disinfection studies were required of the mobile device. The sleeve is intended to be used
with the iHealth Align Gluco-Monitoring System.
4. Data Transmission Accuracy: Bench testing was performed to verify the transmission
accuracy of electrical signals between the glucose meter and the representative Android
devices. This evaluation consisted of the following: sending of data (output from glucose
meter) and receiving of data (input into Android device). Data from the glucose meter
and the receiving data on the Android device was in 100% agreement.
5. Environmental testing for temperature and relative humidity: As established in k110017.
