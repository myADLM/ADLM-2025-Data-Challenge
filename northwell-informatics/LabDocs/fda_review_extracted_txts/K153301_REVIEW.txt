Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline
L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys Digoxin assay employs a competitive test principle using a monoclonal antibody
specifically directed against digoxin. Digoxin in the sample competes with the added digoxin
derivative labeled with biotin for the binding sites on the ruthenylated antibody-complex.
The total duration of the assay is 18 minutes.
By incubating the sample (10 μL) with a digoxin specific ruthenium-labeled antibody, an
immunocomplex is formed, the amount of which is dependent upon the analyte concentration
in the sample. After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles and a digoxin derivative
labeled with biotin, the still-vacant sites of the ruthenium labeled antibodies become
occupied, with formation of an antibody-hapten complex. The entire complex becomes
bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin. The reaction mixture is
aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the
surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed with ProCell. Application of
a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a
photomultiplier.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
All performance characteristics were established on the cobas e 411analyzer.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision
Repeatability and intermediate precision of the Elecsys Digoxin assay were evaluated
on one cobas e 411 analyzer. One reagent lot was evaluated.
A seven sample panel consisting of five pooled human serum samples (HS) spiked
with digoxin and two controls (PCC II = PreciControl Cardiac II, Level 1 and 2) were
measured. The protocol consisted of testing 2 replicates of each control and human
serum sample per run, divided into 2 runs per day for 21 operating days. The samples
were run in randomized order.

according to CLSI EP6-A.
A high analyte serum sample pool spiked with digoxin was diluted with digoxin free
human serum. Fifteen concentrations throughout the measuring range were prepared.
Samples were measured in triplicate within a single run.
The linearity data were analyzed with regards to linear, quadratic and cubic
polynomials according to CLSI EP6-A. In the first step, a linearity check was
performed with a first order (linear) regression and then with higher order models

(quadratic and cubic). Results of this study support the claimed measuring range of
0.4 to 5.0 ng/mL.
A dilution study was performed to determine the recommended dilution factor for
samples. The dilution study for Elecsys Digoxin assay was performed on two cobas e
411 analyzers using four human serum samples with Digoxin concentrations above
the measuring range. Samples were diluted 1:2 manually and automatically by the
instrument. Results support the recommended dilution factor of 1:2 yielding a diluted
sample concentration of 2.5 ng/mL or lower.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
This method is standardized to United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) digoxin reference
material
Stability
Protocols and acceptance criteria for PreciControl Cardiac II control solution stability
were reviewed and found acceptable to support stability of reconstituted control
serum for up to 3 months at -20⁰C, 3 days at 2-8⁰C , on-board the analyzer at 20-
25⁰C. Controls should not be re-frozen after thawing. Protocols and acceptance
criteria for stability of lyophilized control were reviewed and found acceptable to
support stability of lyophilized control serum stored between 2-8⁰C for up to 18
months; real-time stability stability studies are ongoing.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB):
The Limit of Blank (LoB) was defined as the highest apparent analyte concentration
expected to be found when replicates of a blank sample containing no analyte were
tested. The distribution of values for five analyte-free human serum samples was
determined with three reagent lots on two cobas e 411 analyzers with two runs per
day over a period of three days.
The sample was measured in one-fold determination in each run. In summary, 30
measuring points were collected per instrument for a total of 60 measured values per
reagent lot. Results support the LoB of 0.15 ng/mL.
Limit of Detection (LoD)
The distribution of values for five low level human serum samples was determined
using three reagent lots on two cobas e 411 analyzers with two runs per day over a
period of three days. Each sample was measured once per run. In summary, 30
measuring points were collected per instrument for a total of 60 measured values per
reagent lot. The Limit of Detection (LoD) was defined as LoB + 1.653 x SDtotal
where SDtotal refers to the total standard deviation of low analyte samples. Results
support the LoD of 0.2 ng/mL.
7

--- Page 8 ---
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was defined as the lowest amount of analyte that can
be quantitatively determined with the stated accuracy. The distribution of values for ≥
4 low level samples each diluted to concentrations which covered the range between
LoB to 2x LoQ was determined with three reagent lots on a cobas e 411 analyzer
with six runs distributed over three days. Each sample was measured in two replicates
per run with a total of twelve replicates per sample per reagent lot.
A set of ten human serum samples (sample pools spiked with Digoxin) with known
concentrations in the specified LoQ-area (approx. from LoB to 2x LoQ) was
evaluated for each reagent lot. Target values for the Low Level Sample Set were
determined using mass spectrometry during Reference Standardization. Results
support the LoQ of 0.4 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross Reactivity
A cross reactivity study was performed to determine the specificity of the Elecsys
Digoxin assay with both co-analytes and cross-reactant compounds. A dilution series
was prepared and assayed for each co-analyte and cross reactant with Digoxin
concentration of 0.5 and 2.0 ng/mL.

Human Anti-Mouse Antibodies (HAMA)
The effect of the presence of human anti-mouse antibodies in patient samples on the
Elecsys Digoxin assay was assessed on the cobas e 411 analyzer. A high HAMA and
HAMA-free serum pool were each divided into two aliquots and spiked with analyte
to yield two different digoxin concentrations: 0.843 and 2.37 ng/mL. Each high
HAMA serum pool was diluted in 11 steps with the corresponding HAMA-free serum
pool containing the same digoxin concentration. Each dilution was analyzed in 3-fold
determination. The sponsor defined significant interference as recovery of the HAMA
serum sample beyond ±10% of the corresponding HAMA-free sample. No significant
interference was observed at all tested concentrations.
Endogenous Interference
The potential interfering effect of endogenous substances on the Elecsys Digoxin
assay was determined on the cobas e 411 analyzer using human serum samples spiked
with digoxin. For each interfering substance 3 serum samples containing low, mid
and high concentrations of digoxin were tested.
One aliquot of each serum sample was spiked with the potentially interfering
substance; another aliquot was spiked with the same volume of isotonic NaCl solution

(dilution pool). The interfering pool was then diluted into the dilution pool in 10%
increments. The recovery for each sample was calculated by comparison to the
reference (unspiked) sample.
The sponsor defined significant interference as recovery of the digoxin sample spiked
with potential interferent beyond ±0.08 ng/mL at concentrations less than 0.8 ng/mL,
beyond ±10% at concentrations between 0.8 and 4.0 ng/mL, and beyond ±12% at
concentrations above 4.0ng/mL when compared to the corresponding un-spiked
reference sample. No significant interference was observed for any tested endogenous
substance at the levels indicated in the table below:

Bilirubin 66 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 1000 mg/dL
Rheumatic Factor 1630 IU/mL
human Serumalbumin 11.2 g/dL
human IgG 8.0 g/dL
Exogenous Interference
To test for interference from exogenous substances, seventeen common
pharmaceutical compounds were spiked into two human serum samples and tested
with the Elecsys Digoxin assay. The analyte concentrations of the samples were
approximately 0.6 and 2.4 ng/mL. In addition, 17 cardiac drug compounds were
assessed using the same serum sample pools and tested with the Elecsys Digoxin
assay.
For testing, two serum sample pools were divided into aliquots and spiked with the
potential interferents. The interferent concentrations were determined based on
recommendations in the CLSI guideline EP7-A2. The reference samples without
interferent were spiked with solvent.
The digoxin concentration of the spiked samples was determined in triplicate and
compared to the digoxin concentration determined for the reference samples (also
measured in triplicate). These studies were conducted on a cobas e 411 analyzer.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison was performed using the Elecsys Digoxin assay (K973112) as
the predicate device.
A total of 168 human serum samples (all single donors, native and spiked) were
measured in singlicate. Digoxin values ranged from 0.413 to 4.78 ng/mL.
The study was performed on the cobas e 411 analyzer over 3 runs. Regression
analysis for all samples comparing performance on the predicate device Elecsys
Digoxin assay (X) and the new device Elecsys Digoxin assay (Y) are as follows:

b. Matrix comparison:
Anticoagulants
The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of anticoagulants with the
Elecsys Digoxin assay was determined by comparing values obtained from native
samples spiked with digoxin (single donors) drawn into Serum, Li-Heparin, K2-
EDTA-, and K3-EDTA-plasma primary tubes, and Li-Heparin Plasma Separation
Tubes.
Either 65 or 66 serum/plasma pairs per sample material were tested in duplicate with
one reagent lot on a cobas e 411 analyzer. Potential effects were assessed by
Passing/Bablok regression analysis.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not Applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not Applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor included the following information and references in the labeling:
The recommended therapeutic range for digoxin is 0.6‑1.2 ng/mL (0.77‑1.5 nmol/L)
(ESC Guideline 200810) or even 0.5‑1.0 ng/mL (0.64‑1.3 nmol/L).20 Particularly the
upper end of the therapeutic range is controversial and concentrations up to 2.0 ng/mL
(2.6 nmol/L) may still be applied.6,7 Concentrations above 2.0 ng/mL are generally
considered toxic.21 Some overlap of toxic and non-toxic values has been reported.22
Therefore, clinical diagnosis should be based on clinical and laboratory data.
Each laboratory should establish an acceptable reporting format and identify
procedures for the reporting of abnormal results. Each laboratory should investigate
the transferability of the expected values to its own patient population and if necessary
determine its own reference ranges.
