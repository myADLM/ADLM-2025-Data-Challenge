H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA (IgG) is intended for the qualitative detection
of IgG antibodies to West Nile virus in human serum and plasma (K+-EDTA, Li+-heparin). This
test is intended as an aid in the presumptive laboratory diagnosis of West Nile virus infection in
patients with clinical symptoms consistent with meningitis/encephalitis, in conjunction with other
laboratory and clinical findings. Positive results must be confirmed by the plaque reduction
neutralization test (PRNT) or by using the current CDC guidelines for diagnosis of this disease.
The asssay characteristics have not been established for testing cord blood, neonates, prenatal
screening, and general population screening of patients without symptoms of
meningoencephalitis. This assay is not FDA cleared or approved for testing blood or plasma
donors.
Warning: Cross-reactivity with IgG to Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika and Tick-borne Encephalitis
viruses has been observed with the EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA (IgG). Reactive
results must be reported with a caution statement regarding possible IgG cross-reactivity with
other flaviviruses.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

4. Special instrument requirements:

I. Device Description:
The EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA (IgG) test kit contains 12 microtiter strips
each with 8 break-off reagent wells coated with West Nile virus antigen. Patient samples are
diluted 1:101 in sample buffer, 100 µl of each diluted patient sample and pre-diluted controls
and the calibrator are added to the antigen coated microtiter wells and incubated for 60
minutes at 37°C. After incubation, the microtiter well strips are washed 3 times with wash
buffer to remove unbound antibodies and 100 µl of the anti-human IgG horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) enzyme conjugate reagent is added to each microtiter well. After an
additional 30 minutes incubation at room temperature, the microtiter wells are again washed
3 times with wash buffer to remove any unbound enzyme conjugate and 100 µl of the
chromogen substrate is added. The strips are incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature
and 100 µl stop solution is added. The microtiter plates are placed in an ELISA reader and
read at a wavelength of 450 nm and a reference wavelength of between 620 nm and 650 nm
within 30 minutes.

Diagnosis of West Nile Virus, October 30, 2003.
L. Test Principle:
In the first reaction step, diluted patient samples, calibrators and controls are incubated in the
wells. Anti-West Nile virus antibodies will bind to the antigens coated in the microtiter wells.
The wells are washed to remove any unbound proteins and non-specific antibodies. In a
second reaction step, rabbit anti-human IgG HRP enzyme conjugate is added to each well.
The enzyme conjugate will bind to any wells that have human IgG bound to the West Nile
virus antigen. The wells are washed to remove any unbound HRP enzyme conjugate.
Enzyme substrate (3,3,5,5 tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)) is then added. If the HRP enzyme is
present in the well, the HRP enzyme will react with the TMB substrate and produce a blue
color indicating a positive result. After an additional incubation time to allow the color
development, a stop solution is added which turns the color from blue to yellow and inhibits
further color development to allow for a stable spectrophotometric reading. The test strips are
placed in a microplate reader and the optical density of the color is measured. The amount of
antigen specific bound antibody is proportional to the color intensity.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/ Repeatability:
The repeatability of the EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA (IgG) was
investigated by testing of a panel of 7 members prepared using natural patient
samples seropositive at different levels of antibody. The inter-assay repeatability is
based on 42 determinations per sample performed in 14 different runs on 7 different
days (with 2 runs per day and 3 replicates per run). The data from the repeatability
study is presented in the table below.

g. Interference:
Hemolytic, lipemic and icteric samples showed no influence on the result up to a con-
centration of 1000 mg/dL for hemoglobin, 2000 mg/dL for triglycerides and 40
mg/dL for bilirubin in testing with the EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA
(IgG). Interferences from high protein (albumin), cholesterol, and intralipids were not
investigated.
h. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off and borderline range was established based on a ROC analysis of
18 sera from clinically characterized positive West Nile virus patiens and 150 sera
from normal healthy individuals from a non-endemic region.
The ROC analysis demonstrated optimal sensitivity (100.0%) and specificity
(100.0%) at the OD value of 0.475. The calibrator was established at this cut-off OD.
The borderline range of ratio 0.8 to ratio 1.1 was established to cover at least 98% of
the negative samples (148 of 150 samples) in the negative range.
Using the cut-off ratio 1.0 and borderline range of ratio 0.8 to 1.1 with the positive
and negative groups mentioned above, the EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus
ELISA (IgG) showed a sensitivity of 100.0% (95% C.I.: 81.5 – 100.0%) with a
specificity of 98.7% (95% C.I.: 95.3 – 99.8).
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA (IgG) was compared with two
reference assays: The predicate device Focus Diagnostics West Nile Virus IgG
Capture DxSelect™ (K153303) and the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT).
b. Matrix comparison:
Serum vs plasma comparison: The usability of plasma was investigated using
serum paired with the corresponding plasma (EDTA, Li-heparin). Passing-Bablok
regression was calculated for the comparison of serum to plasma. The regression
equations indicated equivalence of serum and the corresponding plasma matrices.
Coefficients of determination were found to be above 0.975 and % recovery
compared to serum was in the range of 92 to 109% (serum = 100%).

of West Nile Virus infection collected at hospitals and clinics across the US in year
2015. The panel consisted of 81 men and 71 women; the ages ranged from 6 to 85
years with a mean age of 49 years. Each specimen was tested at one internal and two
external sites with the EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA (IgG) in parallel
with the predicate assay. The average of three results for each clinical specimen tested
at three sites was considered to calculate the positive percent agreement and negative
percent agreement between the EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA (IgG) vs
the predicate assay. The following results were obtained.

Clinical Study II:
A study was performed at a clinical laboratory in the midwest, with 401 serum
samples collected prospectively from patients suspected of infection with West Nile
virus. The patients consisted of 195 men and 206 women; the ages ranged from 3 to
102 years with a mean age of 47 years. The samples were tested with the
EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA (IgG) in parallel with the predicate
ELISA.

Clinical Study III:
A retrospective clinical study was performed in cooperation with the Robert Koch
Institute (RKI), Berlin, Germany with 295 serum samples that included 200 samples
from major outbreaks of West Nile fever in South Africa in 1974 and 1984. The
samples were tested by PRNT and the EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA
(IgG). The results are shown below.

5. Expected values:
Euroimmun assessed reactivity with 553 samples prospectively collected from patients in
the US. The samples consisted of 50% females and 50% males The range of positivity of
different populations from the US prospective studies with the EUROIMMUN Anti-West
Nile Virus ELISA (IgG) test kit are presented below.
