H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA (IgM) is intended for the qualitative detection
of IgG antibodies to West Nile virus in human serum and plasma (K+-EDTA, Li+-heparin). This
test is intended as an aid in the presumptive laboratory diagnosis of West Nile virus infection in
patients with clinical symptoms consistent with meningitis/encephalitis, in conjunction with other
laboratory and clinical findings. Positive results must be confirmed by the plaque reduction
neutralization test (PRNT) or by using the current CDC guidelines for diagnosis of this disease.
The asssay characteristics have not been established for testing cord blood, neonates, prenatal
screening, and general population screening of patients without symptoms of
meningoencephalitis. This assay is not FDA cleared or approved for testing blood or plasma
donors.
Warning: Cross-reactivity with IgM to Dengue virus, Malaria/anti-Plasmodium falciparum, and
Parovirus B19 has been observed with the EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA (IgM).
Reactive results must be reported with a caution statement regarding possible IgG cross-reactivity
with other flaviviruses.

I. Device Description:
The EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA (IgM) test kit contains 12 microtiter strips
each with 8 break-off reagent wells coated with West Nile virus antigen. Patient serum or
plasma samples are diluted 1:101 in sample buffer and incubated for 10 minutes at room
temperature to allow IgG/RF separation. 100 µl of each diluted patient sample and pre-
diluted controls and calibrator are added to the antigen coated microtiter wells and incubated
for 60 minutes at +37°C. After incubation the microtiter well strips are washed 3 times with
wash buffer to remove unbound antibodies and 100 µl of the anti-human IgM horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) enzyme conjugate reagent is added to each microtiter well. After an
additional 30 minutes incubation at room temperature, the microtiter wells are again washed
3 times with wash buffer to remove any unbound enzyme conjugate and 100 µl of the
chromogen substrate is added. The strips are incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature
and 100 µl stop solution is added. The microtiter plates are placed in an ELISA reader and
read at a wavelength of 450 nm and a reference wavelength of between 620 nm and 650 nm

Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Serological Reagennts for the Laboratory
Diagnosis of West Nile Virus, October 30, 2003.
L. Test Principle:
In the first reaction step, diluted patient samples, calibrators and controls are incubated in the
wells. Anti-West Nile virus antibodies will bind to the antigens coated in the microtiter wells.
The wells are washed to remove any unbound proteins and non-specific antibodies. In a
second reaction step, rabbit anti-human IgM HRP enzyme conjugate is added to each well.
The enzyme conjugate will bind to any wells that have human IgM bound to the West Nile
virus antigen. The wells are washed to remove any unbound HRP enzyme conjugate.
Enzyme substrate (3,3,5,5 tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)) is then added. If the HRP enzyme is
present in the well, the HRP enzyme will react with the TMB substrate and produce a blue
color indicating a positive result. After an additional incubation time to allow the color
development, a stop solution is added which turns the color from blue to yellow and inhibits
further color development to allow for a stable spectrophotometric reading. The test strips are
placed in a microplate reader and the optical density of the color is measured. The amount of
antigen specific bound antibody is proportional to the color intensity.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Repeatability:
The repeatability of the EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA (IgM) was
investigated by testing of a panel of 8 members prepared using natural patient
samples seropositive at different levels of antibody. The inter-assay repeatability is
based on 42 determinations per sample performed in 14 different runs on 7 different
days (with 2 runs per day and 3 replicates per run). The data from the repeatability
study is presented in the table below.

f. Analytical Specificity/Cross Reactivity:
Cross-reactivity was investigated using 692 serologically characterized seropositive
specimens from patients with diseases other than West Nile virus. Each of the
specimens included in the study was characterized with respect to disease state prior
to analysis of the specimens with the EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA
(IgM). Cross-reactivity across the flavivirus group is common (e.g., St. Louis
encephalitis, Dengue 1, 2, 3 & 4; Murray Valley encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis,
Yellow fever viruses, and Zika virus).

g. Interference:
Hemolytic, lipemic and icteric samples showed no influence on the result up to a con-
centration of 1000 mg/dL for hemoglobin, 2000 mg/dL for triglycerides and 40
mg/dL for bilirubin in testing with the EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA
(IgM). Interferences from high protein (albumin), cholesterol, and intralipids were not
investigated.
h. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off and borderline range was established based on a ROC analysis of
18 sera from clinically characterized positive West Nile virus patiens and 150 sera
from normal healthy individuals from a non-endemic region.
The ROC analysis demonstrated optimal sensitivity (100.0%) and specificity (97.3%)
at the OD value of 0.217. The calibrator was established at this cut-off OD.
The borderline range of ratio 0.8 to ratio 1.1 was established to cover at least 95% of
the negative samples (143 of 150 samples) in the negative range.
Using the cut-off ratio 1.0 and borderline range of ratio 0.8 to 1.1 with the positive
and negative groups mentioned above, the EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus
ELISA (IgM) showed a sensitivity of 100.0% (95% C.I.: 81.5 – 100.0%) with a
specificity of 95.3% (95% C.I.: 90.6 – 98.1%).
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA (IgM) was compared with two
reference assays: The predicate device Focus Diagnostics West Nile Virus IgM
Capture DxSelect™ ELISA (K040854) and the plaque-reduction neutralization test
(PRNT).
b. Matrix comparison:
Serum vs plasma comparison: The usability of plasma was investigated using
sample pairs each of serum paired with the corresponding plasma (EDTA, Li-
heparin). Passing-Bablok regression was calculated for the comparison of serum to
plasma. The regression equations indicated equivalence of serum and the
corresponding plasma matrices. Coefficients of determination were found to be above
0.970 and % recovery compared to serum was in the range of 83 to 123% (serum =
100%).

85 years with a mean age of 49 years. Each specimen was tested at one internal and
two external sites with the EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA (IgM) in
parallel with the predicate assay. The average of three results for each clinical
specimen tested at three sites was considered to calculate the positive percent
agreement and negative percent agreement between the EUROIMMUN Anti-West
Nile Virus ELISA (IgM) vs reference assay. The following results were obtained.

Of the 42 presumptive positives by the predicate device, 25 patients were further
tested by PRNT and the EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA (IgM). The
results are shown below:

Clinical Study II:
A study was performed at a clinical laboratory in the midwest, with 398 serum
samples collected prospectively from patients suspected of infection with West Nile
virus. The patients consisted of 193 men and 205 women; the ages ranged from 3 to
102 years with a mean age of 47 years. The samples were tested with the
EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA (IgM) in parallel with the predicate
ELISA.
