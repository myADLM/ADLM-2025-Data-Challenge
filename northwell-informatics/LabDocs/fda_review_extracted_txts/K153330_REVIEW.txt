b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using venous whole blood samples at 9 different glucose
levels (20-25, 45-55, 75-90, 120-140, 190-210, 260-280, 330-350, 400-420 and 480-
500 mg/dL). Three blood samples were used at each level and the actual
concentrations ranged from 20.0 to 496.2 mg/dL (20.0, 20.2, 22.9, 48.9, 52.5, 54.6,
78.0, 78.5, 83.1, 128.1, 129.8, 130.4, 198.5, 199.7, 260.9, 265.5, 266.7, 329.6, 330.2,
331.9, 406.5, 408.2, 411.1, 495.0, 495.6, 496.2 mg/dL) as measured by the reference
method. Each sample was tested in replicates of 10 on each of 3 strip lots resulting in
a total of 30 replicates for each strip lot and glucose level. The values from the
FreeStyle Precision Neo H Meter were compared with those obtained from the
reference method (YSI). The results from regression analysis are summarized below:
Lot 1: y = 0.97x + 3.428, R2=0.997
Lot 2: y = 0.96x + 2.675, R2=0.995
Lot 3: y = 0.96x + 2.327, R2=0.997
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of
20 to 500 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The FreeStyle Precision Neo H Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to the
NIST SRM 917c reference material.

Test Strip Stability:
FreeStyle Precision Neo H Blood Glucose Test Strip remains unchanged compared to
the test strips of the predicate device cleared under k132511. The test strips are
individually foil wrapped. Storage stability information was presented for the
Freestyle Precision Pro Glucose Test Strip to support an 18 month shelf life when
stored at 39-86 °F (4-30 °C).
Control Solution Stability:
The control solutions compatible for use with the current device (MediSense Glucose
and Ketone Control Solutions) were previously cleared and stability and value
assignment was established in k983504. The shelf life of the control solutions are 18
months at 39-86°F (4-30°C). Once opened, the controls are stable for 90 days at 39-
86°F if tightly closed after use.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range for the FreeStyle Precision Neo H Blood Glucose Monitoring
System is 20 to 500 mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity study (M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
The interference study was designed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. The
sponsor assessed the potential interference from twenty nine common endogenous
and exogenous interfering substances by spiking two venous whole blood glucose
concentration intervals, (50-100 mg/dL and 250-350 mg/dL with interfering
substances). Each sample was tested in replicates of 10 (three lots of strips). Bias
from reference was compared between the samples with and without spiked
substances to determine whether a particular substance significantly interferes with
glucose measurement. The sponsor claims that there is no significant interference
from the potential interfering substances at concentrations tested in the table below:

The sponsor has included the following in the labeling:
• Vitamin C (ascorbic acid >2.5 mg/dL) might affect the reliability of your blood
glucose results. If you are taking vitamin C, your glucose results may not be
accurate:
• Do not use during intravenous infusion of high-dose ascorbic acid.
• Do not use during xylose absorption testing, as xylose may produce falsely elevated
glucose results during a xylose absorption test for diagnostic evaluation of
malabsorption.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.

3. Specimen Identification:
The FreeStyle Precision Neo H Blood Glucose Meter will store 1,000 patient results,
including control solution results.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The FreeStyle Precision Neo H Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used with
capillary whole blood from the finger, venous or arterial whole blood. Since the whole
blood sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are no special handling or storage
issues.
5. Calibration:
The FreeStyle Precision Neo H Meter is manually calibrated. A calibrator strip is
packaged with each carton of test strips. The user inserts the calibrator strip into the
meter. The meter turns on automatically. The lot number appears in the display window.
The user must check that the lot number on the meter display window matches with the
number on the test strip calibrator and the last five digits on both the test strip foil packet
and test strip instructions for use. The calibration procedure programs the meter with the
lot number, expiration date and test strip technology. This procedure requires the
calibrator supplied with this test strip package and a FreeStyle Precision Neo H Meter,
available separately.
6. Quality Control:
Three levels of aqueous glucose control solutions are available for use with this system.
No controls solution is provided with FreeStyle Precision Neo H Blood Glucose
Monitoring System. Instructions on how to order the control solutions are included in the
user manual. The meter has a function for the user to select that they wish to run a
control solution to prevent control results from being stored in the internal memory as
patient results. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in
the labeling. The control solution readings are not included in the average of the patient
results when the measurements are performed in the “control solution mode”. An
acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is
cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.
The FreeStyle Precision Neo H Meter also includes a quality control reminder feature for
glucose control solution tests. The quality control Reminder notifies the user a quality
control test is due. The quality control reminder can be set for hourly (1-23 hours) or
daily (1-30 days) intervals and can be enabled and disabled by the healthcare professional
(HCP).
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:

--- Page 14 ---
1. Sample volume Study:
The FreeStyle Precision Neo H Blood Glucose Monitoring System was tested with
venous blood at three glucose concentration intervals (40-60, 100-120, and 380-420
mg/dL) and three specimen volumes. For each glucose interval, the specimen volumes
were adjusted to 0.4, 0.6, and 1.0 µL. Each sample was measured in three replicates for
each of the three strips and the same sample was also measured by an established
laboratory reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The bias for above replicates in each
test strip lot calculated. Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.6 µL
and the meter error code for insufficient sample volume.
2. Hematocrit Study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the
FreeStyle Precision Neo H Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using
venous whole blood samples with hematocrit levels of 15, 20, 30, 42, 50, 60 and 65% and
spiked with glucose to achieve concentrations between 42 and 448 mg/dL (42, 43, 44, 45,
66, 67, 68, 69, 104, 108, 109, 111, 112, 212, 213, 217, 218, 219, 337, 338, 339, 340, 446,
448, 450, 452 and 453 mg/dL). Each hematocrit/glucose concentration combination was
then tested 10 times and the individual values were compared with those obtained from
YSI reference analyzer. The device demonstrated adequate performance at glucose
concentrations between 42 and 448 mg/dL when the hematocrit concentrations are
between 15% and 65% to support the claimed hematocrit range of 15-65%.
3. Altitude study: Venous whole blood samples were collected from 3 blood donors and
spiked with glucose into 3 concentration levels (45, 113 and 385 mg/dL) at two study
sites (sea level and 10,000 feet). Blood glucose target concentrations were then verified
by the reference YSI glucose analyzer at the same site. The results demonstrate
acceptable bias to YSI to support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 10,000 feet
have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements from the FreeStyle Precision
Neo H Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
4. Temperature and humidity studies: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity
studies using venous blood samples to evaluate temperatures ranging from 59ºF to 104ºF
(15ºC to 40ºC) and relative humidity from 10% to 90%. Meter results were compared to
YSI reference analyzer. Four temperature and humidity combinations were tested
including low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high
temperature/low humidity and high temperature/high humidity. No significant effect
(relative to YSI reference analyzer) was observed with the temperature and humidity
combinations tested. The results support the claims in the labeling that the system can be
used in conditions of 59ºF to 104ºF with relative humidity of 10 to 90%.
5. Infection Control Studies: The FreeStyle Precision Neo H Blood Glucose Monitoring
System is intended for multiple-patient use. Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipe
with EPA registration # 67619-12, was validated demonstrating complete inactivation of
live virus for use with the meter. The sponsor also performed robustness studies
demonstrating that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the
meter after 10,950 cleaning and disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one cleaning wipe
plus one disinfecting wipe) to simulate 3 years of multiple-patient meter use. Labeling
14

was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection
procedures.
6. The sponsor provided appropriate documentation certifying that acceptable
electromagnetic testing (EMC) had been performed and the FreeStyle Precision Neo H
Blood Glucose Monitoring System was found to be compliant.
