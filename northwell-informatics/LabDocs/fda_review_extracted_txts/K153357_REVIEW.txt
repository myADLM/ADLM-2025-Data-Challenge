I. Device Description:
The i-STAT Alinity System is a handheld, in vitro diagnostic analytical device designed to run
i-STAT test cartridges. The system is designed for use at point of care or clinical laboratory
settings and is for prescription use only.
The i-STAT Alinity System is comprised of the instrument, rechargeable battery, base
station, electronic simulator, control material, printer and i-STAT test cartridges.
The i-STAT Alinity Instrument features a barcode scanner, user interface with touch screen
display and wireless capability. The instrument reports quantitative results within
approximately 2 minutes.
The i-STAT Alinity system has the following components and functions:
• i-STAT Alinity Instrument: Used to perform cartridge testing, reviewing test results,
and conducting quality control (QC) testing.
• i-STAT Alinity Base Station: Used to recharge the battery installed in the i-STAT
Alinity.
• i-STAT Cartridge: Contains sensors and reagents for all patient and quality testing.
• i-STAT Alinity Rechargeable battery: Provides main power source to the instrument.
2

--- Page 3 ---
• i-STAT Alinity Electronic Simulator: Provides an independent check on the
instruments thermal controls and success of software updates.
• i-STAT Alinity Portable Printer: Used to print records stored in the instrument.
The i-STAT cartridge contains test reagents which are located on the biosensors chips. The
instrument interacts with the cartridge to move fluid across the biosensors and generate a
quantitative result. The biosensor chips, also known as ion selective electrodes, are a
transducer which is made from thin film technology microfabricated onto silicon chips. The
biosensors are made of chemically sensitive films coated over active regions of the silicon
chips. The sodium test generates a potentiometric signal that is read by the instrument and
converted into results. Cartridges require two to three drops of whole blood which are
typically applied to the cartridge using a syringe. The instrument calibration is a one-point on
board calibration and is performed each time a cartridge requiring calibration is used. This
one-point calibration adjusts the offset of the stored calibration curve. A five-level calibration
verification set is used to verify the calibration of i-STAT cartridges throughout the analyte
reportable range.
The sodium test included in the EC3+ cartridge is identical to the assay cleared in k103195
and is representative for the sodium assay found in all i-STAT cartridges that include the
sodium assay.

Usability Engineering To Medical Devices. (General I (QS/RM))
L. Test Principle:
The i-STAT Alinity Instrument uses internal contact pins to create electrical connections
to the cartridge biosensors (ion selective electrode and reference electrode); the electrical
system of the instrument measures ion-selective electrodes which are located on the
cartridge biosensor chips, the biosensor generate a potentiometric signal that is read by
the electrical system of the instrument and converted by the instrument software into a
clinically meaningful result.
Ion selective methods are based on the measurement of potential difference (voltage)
between the ion selective electrode and the reference electrode (both are found on the
biosensors within the cartridge). The biosensor chips convert the activity of the ion
dissolved in the patient sample into an electrical signal which can be measured. The
concentration of sodium in the patient sample is calculated (derived from the Nernst
equation) from the difference between the patient sample and the calibrant solution electrical
signals.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All performance studies for the i-STAT Sodium test were conducted using the i-STAT
E3+ cartridge representing the i-STAT cartridges that include the sodium assay.

The whole blood precision of the i-STAT Alinity System with i-STAT Sodium test
was evaluated using venous whole blood (native and altered) samples targeted to be
within a low abnormal, normal and high abnormal sodium levels: At all 3 POC sites,
specimens for WB low and WB high were altered; specimens for WB normal were
native sample, not altered.
One cartridge lot of i-STAT Sodium test was used across 3 point of care sites at
hospitals. Each site collected and tested its own samples. At each site, each sample was
tested 3 times on each of 7 i-STAT Alinity Instruments (total of 21 test results per
sample).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study was designed based on CLSI EP06-A: Evaluation of the linearity
of quantitative measurement procedures. The linearity of the i-STAT Sodium test was
evaluated on the i-STAT Alinity Instruments by preparing a series of sodium
concentration levels in venous whole blood that spanned the reportable range of the
test. Linearity testing was performed using seven whole blood test samples. Whole
blood was obtained from a healthy subject; this whole blood was altered to produce a
high sample pool and a low sample pool. Intermediate test samples were created from
the high and low pool. Sample range tested from 87 to 204 mmol/L. Linear regression
analysis was performed. The first order regression analysis generated the following
equation y = 1.00914x - 0.822. The linearity results support the claimed reportable
range of the sodium assay from 100 – 180 mmol/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability; Sodium measurement is traceable to the U.S. National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) standard reference material SRM956.
The stability of the sodium test was previously cleared in k103195.
The i-STAT Controls and i-STAT Calibration Verification Material were previously
cleared in k001387 and stability/value assignment information can be found in
k001387.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limits are supported by the linearity study (see M.1.b. above). In
addition, a LoQ study was performed to verify the low end measuring range claim.
The LoQ study was based on the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. The LoQ of the i-
STAT Sodium test was evaluated on the i-STAT Alinity Instruments using venous

whole blood that was altered to low sodium concentrations (four test samples
ranging in sodium concentration from 80.3 mmol/L to 89.7 mmol/L) and two lots
of i-STAT E3+ cartridges over four days. The total number of replicates is 154 for
the evaluation of the LoQ value. The LOQ of the i-STAT Sodium test on the i-
STAT Alinity instrument was determined to be 80 mmol/L.
The sponsor claimed that the sodium assay has a measuring range of 100 to 180
mmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
The interference performance of the i-STAT Sodium test on the i-STAT Alinity
Instrument was evaluated based on CLSI EP07-A2 guideline. The interference
performance was evaluated using whole blood samples at two sodium concentrations.
The effect of each compound was evaluated by comparing the performance of a test
sample spiked to a high concentration of the compound and a control test sample
spiked with an equal volume of solvent. A compound was identified as an interferent
if the difference between the spiked test sample and the control was >4 mmol/L.

“Note 1: Bromide interference testing included two levels: the CLSI recommended
level of 37.5 mmol/L and a therapeutic plasma concentration level of 2.5 mmol/L. The
latter is the peak plasma concentration associated with halothane anesthesia, in which
bromide is released. APOC has not identified a therapeutic condition that would lead
to levels consistent with the CLSI recommended level. Bromide at a concentration of
37.5 mmol/L decreased i-STAT sodium results, while a therapeutic range of bromide
(2.5 mmol/L) did not significantly interfere with the i-STAT sodium results.”
“Note 2: Nithiodote (sodium thiosulfate) is indicated for the treatment of acute cyanide
poisoning. The journal article titled “Falsely increased chloride and missed anion gap
elevation during treatment with sodium thiosulfate” indicated that sodium thiosulfate
could be used in the treatment of cilciphylaxis indicating that “the highest
concentration likely to be seen in plasma [is] after infusion of a 12.5 g dose of sodium
thiosulfate pentahydrate. Assuming that the 12.5 g dose of sodium thiosulfate
pentahydrate is distributed in a typical blood volume of 5 L with a hematocrit of 40%,

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison study compared the clinical results of the i-STAT Alinity
System with i-STAT Sodium test to the i-STAT Sodium Test performance on the i-
STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer (predicate). This study was conducted across 4 point of
care sites using whole blood venous or arterial samples prospectively collected or
left-over from routine patient care. The study included 174 subjects using lithium
heparin whole blood (venous or arterial) samples. A total of 9 specimens out of the
174 method comparison specimens were altered (5.17%). Each site collected and
tested approximately 40-55 samples until sufficient samples (both venous and
arterial) were collected and tested for study analysis. A total of 91 venous specimens
and 83 arterial specimens were tested in this study ( Site 1 tested 21 venous and 20
arterial samples, (Site 2 tested 29 venous and 14 arterial samples, Site 3 tested 23
venous and 28 arterial samples, and Site 4 tested 18 venous and 21 arterial samples.
One lot of i-STAT E3+ cartridges was used for this testing. Weighted Deming
regression analysis comparing the first replicate of the candidate device results to the
mean of the predicate device results yielded the following results:

(lithium heparin). The comparator condition for this study is the anticoagulated
venous whole blood (Lithium Heparin collection tubes) and the test condition is the
non-anticoagulated venous whole blood sample collected without anticoagulant. The
comparison study was performed using the i-STAT Alinity instrument and 40 venous
blood samples across the sodium concentration range (100 – 180 mmol/L). Deming
regression analysis between first individual non- anticoagulated result and the
heparinized mean result yielded the following regression results.

this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
The applicant has provided documentation that indicates the device was designed and
developed under good software life-cycle processes.
3. Specimen Identification:
The specimen identification may be manually entered or automatically scanned by the
device.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The sodium assay is intended to be used with arterial and venous whole blood. The
sample type must be selected using the device touchscreen. After the sample type is
selected the on-screen help appears and the help graphics on the device screen vary based
on the sample type selected. The reagent cartridge contains a sample chamber that
includes the sample well and the channel leading from the well up to the fill mark. The
cartridge label is intended to help the operator fill the cartridge correctly. When filled, the
sample chamber contains sufficient sample for testing. Sample volume and placement are
monitored by the instrument and an error message will be generated if filled incorrectly.
Either lithium heparin tube or syringe could be used but samples must be analyzed within
30 minutes. Samples should be remixed thoroughly before testing. If plain non-
anticoagulated tube or syringes are used then samples must be analyzed within 3 minutes
after collection.

5. Calibration:
The sodium cartridge includes an on board calibration that is performed with each
cartridge use. The calibrant solution is automatically released from its foil pack and is
positioned over the sensors. The signals produced by the sensors’ responses to the
calibrant solution are measured. This one-point calibration adjusts the offset of the stored
calibration curve.
6. Quality Control:
Controls: i-STAT TriControls, 3 levels, previously cleared in k001387 are recommended
by the sponsor for use with the i-STAT Sodium test on the i-STAT Alinity Instrument
and should be run in accordance with facility protocols and best practices, and according
to regulatory requirements.
Calibration verification materials previously cleared in k001387 are recommended by
the sponsor for use with the i-STAT Sodium test on the i-STAT Alinity Instrument. The
sponsor has provided detailed information regarding when to perform calibration
verification in the device operator’s manual.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Temperature Operating Range:
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the i-STAT Alinity System
with i-STAT Sodium test across the operating temperature range of the i-STAT
cartridge 16°C to 30°C. The cartridge temperature operating range of the i-STAT Sodium
test was evaluated using a minimum of 20 i-STAT Alinity Instruments, using blood samples
at three sodium concentration levels that spanned the range of the test and a temperature
chamber set to the minimum and maximum cartridge operating temperatures. The results of
this study demonstrate that the performance of the i-STAT Sodium test on the i-STAT
Alinity Instrument across the cartridge operating temperature range of 16°C to 30°C is not
affected.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
