L. Test Principle:
Lumipulse G 25-OH Vitamin D is an assay system, including a set of immunoassay reagents,
for the quantitative measurement of 25-OH Vitamin D in specimens based on CLEIA
technology by a two-step sandwich immunoassay method on the LUMIPULSE G System.
25-OH Vitamin D Calibrator or specimen is initially auto-diluted with Specimen Diluent 1
in the system. 25-OH vitamin D in specimens is separated from vitamin D binding protein
by the extraction agent and specifically bound to anti-25-OH vitamin D monoclonal
antibody (sheep) on the particles, and form immunocomplexes. The particles are washed
and rinsed to remove unbound materials. Alkaline phosphatase (calf ALP)-labeled anti-(25-
OH vitamin D/anti- 25-OH vitamin D monoclonal antibody immunocomplexes)
recombinant chicken monoclonal antibody specifically binds to 25-OH vitamin D
immunocomplexes on the particles, and additional immunocomplexes are formed The
particles are washed and rinsed to remove unbound materials. Substrate Solution is added
and mixed with the particles. Chloro-5-substituted adamantly-1,2-dioxetane
phosphate(AMPPD) contained in the Substrate Solution is dephosphorylated by the catalysis
of ALP indirectly conjugated to particles. Luminescence (at a maximum wavelength of 477
nm) is generated by the cleavage reaction of dephosphorylated AMPPD. The luminescent
signal reflects the amount of 25-OH vitamin D.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed internally using one lot of reagents and calibrators
on one LUMIPULSE G1200 instrument. Precision study was performed in
accordance with CLSI EP5 A2 in which five human serum-based samples (all native
except panel 5 was spiked to achieve high concentration), and three controls were
assayed in replicates of two at two separate times of the day for 20 days (n=80 for
each sample). The precision results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated based on CLSI EP6-A. Two human serum specimen pools
and two K2EDTA plasma specimen pools with high 25-Hydroxyvitamin D levels
were diluted with low 25-Hydroxyvitamin D levels throughout the range of the assay.
The linearity was tested in the range of 4.0 to 150.0 ng/mL for serum and in the range
of 6.9 to 150.0 ng/mL for plasma. Lumipulse G 25-OH Vitamin D results observed
were correlated with expected concentrations with the following regression results:
Serum: y= 1.0382 (x) + 1.251; R-squared: 0.9978
K2EDTA Plasma: y= 1.0151 (x) + 6.7669; R-squared: 0.9936
The results of the linearity study support the sponsor’s claim that the assay’s
measuring range is 6.9 - 150 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Standardization and Traceability
The standardization of Lumipulse G 25-OH Vitamin D is traceable to in-house
reference calibrators, whose values have been assigned to correlate to Liquid
Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). To achieve
standardization against the CDC Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP)
recognized Reference Measurement Procedure (RMP), samples value assigned by
RMP were tested against the Lumipulse G 25-OH Vitamin D. The RMP is further
traceable to the NIST SRM 2972 material. Please refer to
https://ods.od.nih.gov/Research/VitaminD.aspx for more information on the VDSP
program. The Lumipulse G 25-OH Vitamin D has passed the certification process for
the CDC VDSP and a certificate has been provided by the CDC. Please see the
certification process at http://www.cdc.gov/labstandards/hs.html.

Value assignment
The Lumipulse G 25-OH Vitamin D Calibrator kit contains six different levels of 25-
OH Vitamin D concentration. Value assignment of the calibrators was based on an
internal procedure and results had been verified by testing calibrators in multiple
replicates. All results must meet the internal acceptance criteria before released.
1) CAL 1 0 ng/mL
2) CAL 2 10 ng/mL
3) CAL 3 20 ng/mL
4) CAL 4 50 ng/mL
5) CAL 5 100 ng/mL
6) CAL 6 150 ng/mL
Shelf life stability
The long term stability data were tested at 2–10°C and the study is still on going. The
real-time stability study protocol and acceptance criteria has been reviewed and
found to be acceptable. The current test results support a shelf life of 12 months at 2–
10°C for Lumipulse G 25-OH Vitamin D Immunoreaction Cartridges and the
Lumipulse G 25-OH Vitamin D Calibrators.
On-board stability
On-board stability study and acceptance criteria has been reviewed and found to
be acceptable. The stability data supports the sponsor’s claim that Lumipulse G
25-OH Vitamin D Immunoreaction Cartridges can be stored on-board the
LUMIPULSE G1200 for a maximum of 30 days.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
studies are performed according to the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. LoB study is
performed using a blank sample with 60 replicates per lot of reagent for a total of 120
replicates, over 3 days using 2 lots of reagents. LoD study is performed using 7 low
serum samples with multiple replicates over 3 days using 2 lots of reagents (N=420,
7x 60 replicates each). The LoQ is defined as the lowest analyte concentration at
which concentration has an inter-assay precision of <10%CV.
The LoB, LoD and LoQ are summarized below:
LoB LoD LoQ
0.0 ng/mL 0.28 ng/mL 3.33 ng/mL
The measuring range for the assay is: 6.9 ng/mL – 150 ng/mL

e. Analytical specificity:
Potential interference from common endogenous substances was evaluated in
accordance with CLSI EP7-A2. Human serum specimens with 25-OH vitamin D
concentrations of approximately 20, 40 and 100 ng/mL were supplemented with
potentially interfering compounds. Spiked samples with different interference
substances were tested in replicate of three and the % difference between the spiked
and unspiked (control) samples were calculated. The following compounds were
tested and found not to interfere significantly with the test, based on the sponsors
predefined acceptance criteria of non-significant interference of <10% bias between
the test and control samples.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Lumipulse G 25-OH Vitamin D method comparison study was performed using
specimens consistent with CLSI guideline EP9-A3. A total of 137 serum samples
were assayed using the candidate device (Lumipulse G assay) and the predicate
device (LIAISON vitamin D). Sample range tested between 4.0 to 107.3 ng/mL.
The weighted Deming regression method was used and results are summarized
below:
Correlation Intercept Slope
n
Coefficient (r) (95% CI) (95% CI)
-3.073 1.09
137 0.9476
-4.357 to -1.79 1.04 to 1.13
The results showed a significant bias between the candidate device and the predicate
device. However, this bias between the candidate device and the predicate device is
expected due to different standardization of the two devices. Therefore, test results
from the candidate device do not, and are not expected to, directly correlate with test
results from the predicate device.
An additional method comparison study was performed to evaluate the accuracy
between the candidate device and the RMP, CDC reference method. The method
comparison against the RMP was the basis of the substantial equivalence
determination.
A total of 119 serum samples were assayed using the candidate device (the
Lumipulse G 25-OH assay) and the RMP. The weighted Deming regression method
was used to compare Lumipulse G 25-OH Vitamin D to the RMP. The results are

c. Matrix comparison:
The Lumipulse G 25-OH Vitamin D matrix comparison study was performed to
evaluate the difference across tube types (SST, K2EDTA, Lithium Heparin, and
Sodium Heparin) versus the means of the control samples (Red top serum) analyzed
per CLSI guideline EP9-A3. Fifty samples were tested with eight samples spiked in
order to cover the measuring range.

deficiency, any disease considered chronic, history of seizures, bariatric surgery,
parathyroid and thyroid disease, were pregnant or lactating, had an active malignancy or
were diagnosed with cancer other than basal/squamous cell skin cancer within 5 years,
were receiving chemotherapy or radiation treatment, had a family history of parathyroid
or calcium regulatory disease, were on medicines known to affect absorption or increase
catabolism, or had abnormal serum levels for calcium PTH or TSH.
The subjects ranged in age from 21to 74 years (median age of 40) and were representative
of the overall US population in terms of sex (48.4% male and 51.6% female) and
ethnicity/race (61.3% White, 8.0% Black, 18.5% Hispanic, 7.7% Asian/Pacific Islander
and 4.5% Other). The majority of the population was < 50 years old (196/287, 68.3%)
with a median age of 31.
To represent a broad spectrum of UV light exposure, the study population included adult
subjects from 2 geographically diverse regions of the US , the Northern states and the
Southern states, that were sampled during spring/summer (April through September) and
fall/winter (October through March) seasons. The observed range of 25(OH) vitamin D
concentrations, established according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
(CLSI) Protocol EP28-A3c is summarized in the tables below.
Median Observed Range
n Mean Concentration
Concentration (2.5th to 97.5th percentile)
287 22.9 ng/mL 22.2 ng/mL 7.6 – 47.6 ng/mL
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
