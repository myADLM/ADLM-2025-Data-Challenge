L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT 25-OH Vitamin D 5P02 assay is a delayed one-step immunoassay including a
sample pre-treatment for the quantitative determination of vitamin D in human serum and plasma
using CMIA technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex. Sample and pre-
treatment reagents are combined. An aliquot of the pre-treated sample is combined with assay
diluent and paramagnetic anti-vitamin D coated microparticles to create a reaction mixture.
Vitamin D present in the sample binds to anti-vitamin D coated microparticles. After incubation a
biotinylated vitamin D anti-Biotin acridinium-labeled conjugate complex is added to the reaction
mixture and binds to unoccupied binding sites of the anti-vitamin D coated microparticles. After
washing, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting
chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). An indirect relationship
exists between the amount of vitamin D in the sample and the RLUs detected by the
ARCHITECT i System optics.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP5-A2 in which seven (7) serum
samples (ranging from 5.0 ng/mL to 152.6 ng/mL) and three control levels (20.0,
40.0, and 75.0 ng/mL) were assayed in duplicate in two runs per day for 20 non-
consecutive days on two i2000SR analyzers using three reagent lots for a total of 360
results per sample (120 results per analyzer per sample). Each analyzer/reagent lot
produced similar precision results. The within-run and total precision results are
summarized in the table below using one representative lot of reagents:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated based on CLSI EP-6A, Evaluation of the Linearity of
Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach. A linearity sample set
was prepared by diluting a serum sample with a high 25-OH vitamin D concentration
with a serum sample with a low 25-OH vitamin D concentration to obtain twelve (12)
concentration levels across the measuring range of the candidate assay. Samples were
run in replicates of 4 on one i2000SR analyzer using one reagent lot. The weighted
Deming linear regression of the observed mean concentrations versus the expected
concentration was calculated and yielded the following linear regression equation:
y = 0.9435x + 0.4 ng/mL, r = 1.00, Test range: 3.4-160.3 ng/mL
The summary of observed concentrations versus the expected concentration is
provided in the table below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Standardization and Traceability
The ARCHITECT 25-OH Vitamin D Assay was originally cleared under 510(k)
k110619. Abbott has modified the assay by standardizing the cleared vitamin D
assay in accordance with the Vitamin D Standardization Certification Program
(VDSCP). The VDSCP is an international collaborative effort to standardize the
laboratory measurement of serum 25-OH vitamin D This collaboration involves the
coordinated efforts of the National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary
Supplements (ODS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the
National Institutes for Standards and Technology (NIST), Ghent University, and other
institutions. Please refer to http://ods.od.nih.gov/Research/VitaminD.aspx for more
information on the VDSCP program.
To achieve standardization against the VDSP recognized Reference Measurement
Procedure (RMP), the ARCHITECT 25-OH Vitamin D 5P02 assay master calibration
parameters were aligned to the CDC VDSP by using 129 human serum samples from
the CDC VSDP program which were value assigned by the RMP and traceable to
NIST SRM2972.

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification (LoQ)
studies were performed according to CLSI EP-17A2.
To establish the Limit of Blank (LoB), four blank samples (human serum based calibrator
1) were assayed 60 times using two reagent lots over multiple days on two analyzers. The
Limit of Blank was the value at the 95th percentile and was determined to be 1.6 ng/mL.
To determine the Limit of Detection (LoD), 14 low level samples, with concentrations in
the range from 0.5 to 3.5 ng/mL, were measured in replicates of 10 over 3 days using 2
lots of reagent for a total of 60 measurements. The LoD was calculated to be 2.2 ng/mL.
Using data from each low-level analyte, the pooled SD and %CV were calculated.
The LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration with an inter-assay precision of
≤20% CV. The LoQ was determined to be 2.4 ng/mL.
Detection limits results:
Limit of Blank Limit of Detection Limit of Quantitation
1.6 ng/mL 2.2 ng/mL 2.4 ng/mL
The reportable range of the assay is 3.4-155.9 ng/mL.

and 40 ng/mL were spiked with potentially interfering endogenous substances listed
below. Each sample was tested in replicates of 12 on one ARCHITECT i2000SR
analyzer using one lot of reagent. The sponsor defines significant interference as a
percent difference of >10% when compared to the unspiked sample. A summary of
the results are provided in the table below:

The sponsor includes the following limitation in the labeling regarding interference
from triglycerides:
“The ARCHITECT 25-OH Vitamin D assay is susceptible to interference effects
from triglycerides at >500 mg/dL. A triglyceride concentration of 800 mg/dL resulted
in a -13.8%, -10.2%, and -17.5% bias in results for 25-OH vitamin D concentration
of approximately 20 ng/mL, 30 ng/mL, and 40 ng/mL 25-OH vitamin D,
respectively.”
Cross reactivity:
The sponsor performed studies to evaluate if compounds similar to 25-
hydroxyvitamin D cross react with the ARCHITECT 25-OH Vitamin D 5P02 assay.
Cross reactivity studies were performed by spiking potential cross-reactants into three
human serum pools with 25-OH vitamin D concentrations of 20 ng/mL, 30 ng/mL,
and 40 ng/mL. Each sample was tested in replicates of 12 using one ARCHITECT
i2000SR analyzer and one lot of reagent. Cross-reactivity was calculated using the
following equation:
% Cross-Reactivity= mean value spiked –mean value unspiked X 100

Cross Reactivity of 25-OH Vitamin D2
The cross-reactivity of the ARCHITECT 25-OH Vitamin D 5P02 assay with 25-OH
vitamin D2 was assessed using endogenous (non-spiked) serum specimens with total
25-OH vitamin D2 concentrations of approximately 26 ng/mL and 68 ng/mL and 25-
OH vitamin D3 concentrations below the detection limit of the LC-MS/MS on which
they concentrations were quantified. Each concentration was tested in a minimum of
2 replicates using 1 lot each of reagent, calibrators, and controls on 1 ARCHITECT
i2000SR instrument. The cross-reactivity was calculated using the following
equation:

serum samples were tested in duplicate using the candidate device and the predicate
device. The sample concentrations ranged from 9.6-96.9 ng/mL. One ARCHITECT
i2000SR analyzer and one reagent lot were used. Passing-Bablok regression analysis was
performed as shown below:

Number 107
Slope 0.99
Intercept -1.05
R 0.98
Test range 9.6-96.9 ng/mL
An additional method comparison study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy
between the candidate device and the RMP, University of Ghent’s ID-LC/MS/MS
method. The method comparison against the RMP was the basis of the substantial
equivalence determination.
A total of 129 unaltered serum samples value assigned by ID-LC-MS/MS RMP
(Ghent University), were tested in singleton on two ARCHITECT i2000SR analyzers
using two lots of reagents. 120 samples were native samples, 7 samples were spiked
and 3 samples were diluted in order to span the measuring range, but one spiked
sample was eliminated from data analysis because the result was greater than 160
ng/mL. The test range as measured by the RMP method was 4.0 to 153.2 ng/mL.
Passing-Bablok analysis was performed and the results for the first replicate of the
ARCHITECT 25-OH Vitamin D assay when compared to the reference method were
shown below:
ARCHITECT 25-OH Vitamin D 5P02 Value ( 95% CI )

Slope 1.02 (0.99, 1.05)
Intercept -0.99 ( -1.92, -0.24)
Correlation Coefficient 0.99 (0.99,0.99)
Candidate Result Ranges 4.9 to 151.3 ng/mL
b. Matrix comparison:
A tube type comparison study was performed based on guidance from CLSI EP7-A2.
Forty donor sample sets in the control tube type (serum, plastic) and in the following
tube types: dipotassium EDTA, lithium heparin, sodium heparin, lithium heparin
plasma separator, serum separator, and tri-potassium EDTA were collected. No more
than 20% of the donor sets were supplemented with 25-OH vitamin D stock solution
to create samples that spanned the measuring range of the assay. The total number of
sample sets tested was 51. The control tube sample (serum) was tested in replicates of
3 for each sample and each of the other sample types were tested in a minimum of 2

replicates with the ARCHITECT 25-OH Vitamin D 5P02 assay using 2 ARCHITECT
i2000SR analyzers and one lot of reagent. For each donor set, the mean concentration
was calculated for the control tube type. The control tube test concentration range was
7.2 – 135.8 ng/dL. The first replicate result of each of the alternate tube types was
used in the Passing-Bablok analysis which yielded the following linear regression
equations:
Dipotassium (K2) EDTA: y= 0.93x + 0.76, r=1.00
Lithium heparin: y= 0.94x -0.90, r=1.00
Sodium heparin: y= 0.94x + 0.84, r=1.00
Lithium heparin plasma separator: y=0.93x – 1.09, r=1.00
Serum separator: y= 0.99x+ 0.4, r=1.00
Tri-potassium (K3) EDTA: y=0.92x + 0.83, r=1.00
Sponsor claimed that all the tube types tested above are acceptable tube type for use
with the ARCHITECT 25-OH vitamin D assay.
