L. Test Principle:
Human Kappa (κ)/Lambda (λ) Free Light Chain Assays are latex enhanced
immunoturbidimetric assays. Kappa FLC and Lambda FLC in the sample bind to specific
anti-Kappa FLC and anti-Lambda antibodies (respectively) that are coated on latex particles
and cause agglutination. The degree of the turbidity caused by agglutination can be measured
optically and is proportional to the amount of Kappa FLC in the sample. The instrument
calculates the Kappa FLC concentration by interpolation of obtained signal of a 6-point
calibration curve prepared from calibrators of known concentrations.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the Diazyme Kappa and Lambda FLC Assays were evaluated
according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute EP5-A2 guideline. Serum
samples were obtained from IRB-approved commercial sources and samples with
values close to normal, abnormal and very abnormal analyte levels were pooled to
achieve target concentrations spanning the linear range of each FLC assay. In the
study, eight levels of serum specimens were tested. These specimens included two
samples within 25% of the cutoff/upper limit of normal and two levels of serum based
controls for Kappa FLC and Lambda FLC. Testing was performed on three Hitachi 917
instruments with two replicates per run, two runs per day and over 20 working days
using one lot of the assay-specific reagents.

created by spiking pooled serum samples with Kappa or Lambda FLC Bence Jones
proteins to a final concentration of ~ 160 mg/L for Kappa FLC and ~ 210 mg/L for
Lambda FLC and creating a series of 10 concentrations down to 15 mg/L Kappa FLC
and 20 mg/L Lambda FLC by diluting with saline. Samples were run in triplicate.
Linearity for Diazyme Human Kappa (κ) FLC Assay

Extended range linearity studies were performed on the Hitachi 917 in extended range
mode with one lot of reagents. Extended range mode on the Hitachi 917 automatically
dilutes the sample on board with a 1:20 sample dilution and calculates the extended
range value. The linearity set was created as follows: a pooled serum sample was
spiked with Kappa or Lambda FLC Bence Jones proteins to a final concentration of
3,000 mg/L for Kappa and 4,000 mg/L for Lambda FLC.
The results of the study on the Hitachi 917 analyzer demonstrated linearity up to
3,000 mg/L for Kappa and 4,000 mg/L for Lambda FLC in extended range mode.

When samples containing analyte concentrations greater than the upper limit of the
measuring range in standard mode are diluted and re-tested in extended mode, a hook
effect was not seen up to concentrations of 105,939 mg/L Kappa FLC or 109,532

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
There is no international reference standard for FLC. The calibrators for the Diazyme
Kappa and Lambda FLC Assay are traceable to an internally assigned master
calibrator.
Kit Stability:
Reagent Real-time stability: The manufacturer has claimed stability up to 12 months
when kept at 2–8oC. Data provided demonstrated that the real time stability at 2–8oC
is for 14 months for three lots of Kappa FLC and 13 months for three lots of Lambda
FLC.
Reagent On-board stability: On board, real-time reagent stability for Kappa and
Lambda FLC on Hitachi 917 is seven weeks.
Control stability: The opened calibrators are stable for four weeks when stored at 2–
8oC and capped tightly to minimize exposure to air and evaporation.
Calibrator Stability: The opened calibrators are stable for at least four weeks when
stored at 2–8oC and capped tightly to minimize exposure to air and evaporation.
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit for Diazyme Human Kappa (κ) and Lambda (λ) FLC Assays
The LoB, LoD, LoQ of the Assays were determined according to CLSI guideline
EP17-A2 and listed in the table below.
Detection Limits (mg/L) LoB LoD LoQ
Kappa FLC 1.2 2.0 4.5
Lambda FLC 1.7 2.9 6.1
e. Analytical specificity:
To determine the level of interference from substances that may be present in serum,
the Diazyme Human Kappa (κ) and Lambda (l) assays were used to test three serum
pools that contained low, medium and high Kappa/Lambda concentrations
(approximately 10, 60 and 120 mg/L) spiked with various amounts of substances
following CLSI guideline EP07-A2.
Each serum sample spiked with interference substances was tested in triplicate on the

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The Diazyme Human Kappa (k) and Lambda (λ) FLC assays were evaluated and
compared to the results obtained with the predicate device following CLSI guideline
EP09-A2. A total of 126 serum samples ranging from 4.63–2975.80 mg/L were tested
in comparison with predicate assay. Among the 126 samples, 39 were Multiple
Myeloma (MM), 12 were Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance
(MGUS), 34 were Abnormal (due to other disease states) and 41 were Normal (no
disease). The results are summarized in the following table:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
To establish the reference interval for the Diazyme Kappa and Lambda FLC assays,
serum samples from 120 apparently healthy individuals (60 females and 60 males) with
age ranges from 18–70 were tested with one replicate per sample on the Hitachi 917 with
the Diazyme Kappa and Lambda FLC assays according to CLSI guideline C28-A3. The
central 95% reference interval was established to be from 2.37 mg/L to 20.73 mg/L for
Kappa FLC and from 4.23 mg/L to 27.69 mg/L for Lambda FLC.
The manufacturer recommends that each user of the kit should establish a range of
normal values for the population in their region.
