1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
AssureTech Amphetamine Tests are immunochromatographic assays for the qualitative
determination of d-Amphetamine in human urine at cut-off concentration of 1000 ng/mL.
The tests are available in a Strip format, a Cup format, a Dip Card format and a Turn Key
Split Cup format. The tests provide only preliminary test results. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result.
Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test
result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive. For in vitro diagnostic use
only. The tests are intended for over-the-counter and for prescription use.
AssureTech Cocaine Tests are immunochromatographic assays for the qualitative
determination of Benzoylecgonine in human urine at cut-off concentration of 300 ng/mL.
The tests are available in a Strip format, a Cup format, a Dip Card format and a Turn Key
Split Cup format. The tests provide only preliminary test results. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result.

AssureTech Morphine Tests are immunochromatographic assays for the qualitative
determination of Morphine in human urine at cut-off concentration of 2000 ng/mL. The
tests are available in a Strip format, a Cup format, a Dip Card format and a Turn Key

L. Test Principle:
The AssureTech Amphetamine Tests, AssureTech Cocaine Tests, and AssureTech Morphine
Tests are rapid tests for the qualitative detection of d-Amphetamine, Benzoylecgonine and
Morphine in urine samples. The tests are lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays. During
testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. If a target drug is present in
the urine specimen is below the cut-off concentration, it will not saturate the binding sites of
its specific monoclonal mouse antibody coated onto particles. The antibody-coated particles
will then be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible colored line will show up
in the test line region. The colored line will not form in the test line region if the target drug
level exceeds its cutoff-concentration because it will saturate all the binding sites of the
antibody coated on the particles and no binding sites will be available to allow the antibody
coated particles to bind to the immobilized drug conjugate. A band should form in the control
region of the devices regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the sample to
indicate that the tests have been performed properly.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of -100%, -75%, -
50%, -25%, cutoff, +25%, +50%, +75% and +100% cut off. These samples were
prepared by spiking drug into negative urine samples. Each drug concentration was
confirmed by GC/MS. These studies were conducted by 3 operators with 3 lots of
each device in two runs per day for 25 days (n=50). The results obtained are
summarized in the following tables.

e. Analytical specificity:
The potential effect of endogenous and exogenous interferents was tested by spiking
the interferents into drug-free urine and target drug(s) urine with concentrations at
25% below and 25% above the cut-off levels by using 3 lots and 3 operators for each
format. Compounds that showed no positive or negative interference at a
concentration of 100 μg/mL are summarized in the following tables. There were no
differences observed for different devices.

To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine pH, urine samples with
1.000 to 1.035 specific gravity or urine samples with pH 4 to 9 were spiked with
target drugs at 25% below and 25% above the cutoff levels. These samples were
tested using three lots of each device. Results were all positive for samples at and
above +25% cut-off and all negative for samples at and below -25% cut-off. There
were no differences observed for different formats.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cut-
off concentration appears in the precision/reproducibility section above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies for the AssureTech Amphetamine Tests, the AssureTech
Cocaine Tests and the AssureTech Morphine Tests were performed in-house with
three laboratory assistants for each device. Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40
positive) unaltered clinical samples. The samples were blind labeled and compared to

Lay-user study:
A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 1638 lay persons. The
lay users had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age
from 18 to > 50 years. Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations;
negative, +/-75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of the cutoff by spiking drug(s) into drug free-
pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by
GC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers and blind-labeled.
