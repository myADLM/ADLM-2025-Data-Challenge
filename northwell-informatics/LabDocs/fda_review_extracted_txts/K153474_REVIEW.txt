Traceability:
The controls are validated by certified independent laboratories by using either
GC/MS, LC/MS, HPLC, or Immunoassay screening. The controls are manufactured
using reference standards purchased from commercial vendors. Accuracy is certified
by purity determination using analytical tools including GC/MS, LC/MS, and NMR.
Gravimetric preparation is accomplished using balances calibrated with weights that
are traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
Value Assignment:
The following procedure was used for value assignment
a. Assay Methodology used to assign values:
Certified Independent laboratories test by GC/MS, LC/MS, or Immunoassay
screening depending on validated test method that is in use at time of testing.
b. Data Collection:
A minimum of 3 data points are collected for each assay. Data collected from
at least two test sites, testing performed within 1 week of receipt of test
samples.
Stability:
The stability protocols for open and closed vial were reviewed and found acceptable.
The testing supports closed vial stability for 36 months when stored at 2-8°C with the
exception of oxazepam (oxazepam is stable for 6 months) and 48 months when stored
at -10 to -20°C. Open vials are stable for 31 days when stored at 2-8°C and 31 days
when stored at room temperature (18-21°C).
