H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
1) The cobas® Influenza A/B & RSV Nucleic Acid Test for Use on the cobas® Liat System (cobas®
Liat Influenza A/B & RSV) is an automated multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay for the rapid in vitro
qualitative detection and discrimination of influenza A virus, influenza B virus and respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV) RNA in nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients with signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. The
test is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis and differentiation of influenza A, influenza B, and
RSV in humans and is not intended to detect influenza C.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus or RSV infection and should not be used as the sole
basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule-
out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite
cause of disease.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2013-2014 and the 2014-
2015 influenza seasons when influenza A/H3 and A/H1N1 pandemic were the predominant
influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance
characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological
screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with
appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to state or
local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL
3+ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.
2) The cobas® Influenza A/B & RSV Quality Control Kit contains External Controls for use with the
cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay. External Controls are run during the Add cobas® Liat
Influenza A/B & RSV Tube Lot procedure. Additional External Controls should be tested in
accordance with local, state, federal and/or accrediting organization requirements as applicable.

I. Device Description:
Overview
The cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV Nucleic Acid Test for Use on the cobas® Liat System (cobas® Liat
Influenza A/B & RSV) is a rapid, automated in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of influenza
A, influenza B, and RSV RNA in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens eluted in viral transport media.
The assay targets a well-conserved region of the matrix gene of influenza A (Inf A target), the non-structural
protein gene of influenza B (Inf B target), and the matrix gene of RSV (RSV target). An Internal Process
Control (IPC) is also included. The IPC is present to control for adequate processing of the target viruses
and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the sample preparation and RT-PCR.
The assay utilizes a single-use disposable cobas® Liat Tube that holds the sample purification and PCR
reagents, and hosts the sample preparation and PCR processes. The cobas® Liat Tube uses a flexible tube as
a sample vessel. It contains all required unit dose reagents pre-packed in tube segments, separated by
peelable seals, in the order of reagent use.
The cobas® Liat System automates and integrates sample purification, nucleic acid amplification, and
detection of the target sequence in biological samples. The cobas® Liat System performs all assay steps
from clinical sample and reports assay result automatically. During the testing process, multiple sample
processing actuators of the cobas® Liat System compress the cobas® Liat Tube to selectively release
reagents from tube segments, move the sample from one segment to another, and control reaction volume,
temperature, and time to conduct sample preparation, nucleic acid extraction, target enrichment, inhibitor
removal, nucleic acid elution, and real-time PCR. An embedded microprocessor controls and coordinates
the actions of these sample processors to perform all required assay steps within the closed cobas® Liat
Tube.

Quality Control
The cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay has three controls: (1) internal process control, (2) positive
control, and (3) negative control.
Internal Process Control
The internal process control (IPC) is comprised of a bacteriophage MS2 that is pre-packed in each cobas®
Liat tube. The IPC is designed to be detected at a cycle threshold (Ct) of ~31 on the cobas® Liat Influenza
A/B & RSV assay, similar to the Ct of approximately 4x Limit of Detection (LOD) concentration of target
viruses. When conducting an assay, IPC is first mixed with a sample and then it goes through all the test
processes to monitor both the sample preparation and RT-PCR performance. The IPC RNA is detected in a
separate channel by MS2 specific primers and probe. If IPC Ct does not meet the acceptance criteria and Inf
A, Inf B, and RSV are not detected, the assay run is called “Invalid” to avoid false negative results due to
excessive sample inhibition or system operation outside the normal range.
Positive Control
Positive control is provided in the cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay Quality Control Kit. The
positive control is comprised of a pooled sample of inactivated Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV. The
individual inactivated viruses are pooled to make the positive control solution, and then dispensed and
“freeze-dried” in unit-dose quantities in individual Positive Control tubes. To use the positive control, an
operator transfers a unit dose of Universal Transport Media (UTM) from the Dilution UTM tube into the
Positive Control tube using an included transfer pipette to dissolve and mix the dried positive control. The
4

--- Page 5 ---
entire mixture is then transfer into the cobas® Liat tube, and the cobas® Liat tube is run on a cobas® Liat
Analyzer according to the Instructions for Use.
The positive control is required to be run during the “Add Liat Tube Lot” process, in which the cobas® Liat
tube lot and end user site procedures are checked. Additional positive control runs may be performed by the
end user to confirm the performance of a cobas® Liat Analyzer and a cobas® Liat tube lot through detection
of Influenza A, Influenza B and RSV targets, or as required by the end user’s quality control standards.
Negative Control
Negative control is provided in the cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay Quality Control Kit. The
negative control is comprised of UTM. The solution is provided in unit dose quantity and labeled as
Dilution UTM. To use the negative control, an operator transfers the entire contents of the Dilution UTM
tube into the cobas® Liat tube using a transfer pipette and runs the assay following the Instructions for Use.
The negative control is required to be run during the “Add Liat Tube Lot” process, in which potential
contamination and end user site procedures are checked. Additional negative control runs may be performed
by the end user to check if there is contamination resulting in a false positive result, or as required by the
end user’s quality control standards.
Workflow
To perform the cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay, an operator first collects a nasopharyngeal swab
and places the swab into UTM. The operator transfers the sample into cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV
assay tube using a transfer pipette, and scans the tube barcode to identify the test and the sample barcode to
code the sample ID with the assay run on the cobas® Liat System. The cobas® Liat Tube is then inserted into
the cobas® Liat System. The system performs all the test steps and outputs interpreted results (e.g., Influenza
A Detected, Influenza B Not Detected, RSV Not Detected) in ~20 minutes. A report of the interpreted
results can be viewed on the cobas® Liat System’s LCD screen, and printed directly through a USB or
network connected printer. No reagent preparation or additional steps are required other than adding the
sample to the cobas® Liat Tube. Because all the reagents are contained within the cobas® Liat Tube and no
sample or reagent needs to be removed from the tube, cross-contamination between samples is minimized.
Results Interpretation
The results are interpreted by the cobas® Liat System software from measured fluorescent signals and real
time curve recognition algorithm. No manual data interpretation or reviewing PCR curves is required. The
cobas® Liat Analyzer automatically interprets the results from measured fluorescent signals. Embedded
algorithms determine the PCR cycle threshold (Ct), and evaluate the Ct against a valid range (i.e., minimum
value to assay cutoff) to generate a positive or negative PCR result. Additionally, pattern recognition
algorithms inspect the baseline, logarithmic, and plateau phases of the PCR curve to determine if the curve
is typical/normal or abnormal. If a PCR curve is determined to be abnormal, the result may be called
“Invalid” or “Indeterminate.” This pattern recognition provides additional error checking capabilities to
ensure the quality of the results. In cases where one of Inf A, Inf B, and RSV is detected, but the PCR curve
pattern is abnormal, the result is reported as “Invalid” to avoid false positive results. When at least two of
Inf A, Inf B and RSV are detected but the PCR curve pattern for one target is abnormal, the target(s) with
the normal curve pattern is called “Detected” while the target with the abnormal curve is called
“Indeterminate”.
All possible final test results and the respective follow-up actions are described in Table 1 below:

L. Test Principle:
The cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay uses well established nucleic acid test chemistry and assay
protocol for viral RNA detection. The sample preparation methodology is based on chaotropic agent-based
lysis and magnetic particle nucleic acid purification. First, the NPS sample is diluted and mixed with an
internal process control (IPC) (encapsulated RNA). Chaotropic and proteolytic reagent then disrupts the
three dimensional structure in macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids in the sample, and
denatures them. Second, nucleic acids are isolated from lysates through binding to the surface of silica
magnetic beads in the presence of a chaotropic salt, which removes water from hydrated molecules in
solution. Third, the beads are separated from the lysates using a magnetic field, and the lysate removed.
Fourth, the beads with captured nucleic acids are washed to remove possible inhibitors in the sample.
Finally, the captured nucleic acids are eluted under low-salt conditions into a small volume of elution buffer.
Eluted viral RNA is first transcribed into cDNA using reverse transcriptase. This cDNA then undergoes a
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) where the reaction mixture is repeatedly heated to denature the nucleic
acid, and cooled to allow annealing of primers and extension of annealed primers by DNA polymerase to
logarithmically amplify the specific region of the cDNA. Dual-labeled fluorogenic hydrolysis (TaqMan)
probes anneal to the specific target sequences located between the binding regions of forward and reverse
primers. During the extension phase of the PCR cycle, the 5′ nuclease activity of the polymerase degrades
the probes, causing the reporter dyes to separate from the quenchers, thus generating fluorescent signals.
Fluorescence intensities are monitored at each PCR cycle. When the fluorescence intensities exceed pre-
determined thresholds, cycle threshold (Ct) values are generated for the specific analyte corresponding to
the fluorescence channel.
All these sample preparation/nucleic acids extractions and real-time PCR amplification processes are
conducted in a closed cobas® Liat Tube in ~20 minutes.

Reproducibility Study
A reproducibility study was conducted assessing the total variability of the cobas® Liat Influenza
A/B & RSV assay across operators, study sites, testing days, cobas® Liat Analyzers, and cobas® Liat
assay tube lots. The cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay was evaluated at three CLIA waived
sites. Two (2) operators at each of the three sites tested a 10-member reproducibility panel in
triplicate on five different days, for a total of ~900 runs (10 panel members × 3 replicates × 2
operators × 5 days × 3 sites). The reproducibility panel contained a true negative; and a high
negative, a low positive and a moderate positive of each of Influenza A, Influenza B and RSV.
The reproducibility panel samples were constructed by spiking viruses of known titer into negative
NPS in UTM sample matrix. A/Brisbane/59/07, B/Malaysia/2506/04, and RSV-A 2006 Isolate with
known TCID /mL titers were obtained from a vendor. The moderate positive, low positive, and
50
high negative concentrations used for each of the strains corresponded to C (4xLOD), C
100 95
(1xLOD), and C (as determined by Probit analysis using LOD data), respectively. The true negative
5
sample comprised negative NPS sample matrix in UTM. For a given virus, the expected result for
the true negative and the high negative panel member is “Not Detected”, while the expected result
for the low positive and moderate positive panel member is “Detected”.
Three (3) CLIA waived sites and six operators (two operators per site) participated in this
reproducibility study. The six operators consisted of two nurses, three medical assistants, and one
administrative assistant with no formal medical laboratory training. All operators had limited or no
training or hands-on experience in conducting laboratory testing.
The six operators at the three sites tested the members of the reproducibility panel in triplicate on
five non-consecutive days. Three (3) cobas® Liat Analyzers were used at each site for a total of nine
cobas® Liat Analyzers. Each site also used a different lot of cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay
tubes for a total of three lots.

Controls
External Positive and Negative Controls
Positive and negative controls are provided in the cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay Quality
Control Kit. Refer to the “Device Description” section of this summary for details regarding these
controls.
External positive and negative controls are required to be run during the Add cobas® Liat Influenza
A/B & RSV Tube Lot procedure. Additional External positive and negative controls may be tested in
accordance with local, state, federal, and/or accrediting organization requirements as applicable.
During the clinical study testing both prospective and retrospective specimens (during the 2014 to
2015 influenza season), quality control testing using the external positive and negative controls was
performed per the product Instructions for Use at all three study sites. A total of 173 external
positive controls and 173 external negative controls were tested during the clinical study. Two (2)
external positive controls (2/173, 1.2%, 95% CI, 0.3% - 4.1%) and three external negative controls
(3/173, 1.7%, 95% CI, 0.6% - 5.0%) failed initially, but succeeded on repeat testing per the product
Instructions for Use.

Package Insert. Influenza A, Influenza B and RSV strains at 3x LOD were spiked into negative
nasopharyngeal swab in UTM matrix, stored at -80°C and 4°C, and tested at different time points.
General recommendations for the storage and transport of nasopharyngeal swab in UTM specimens
with regard to nucleic acid-based influenza and RSV testing are to store specimens refrigerated (2-
8°C) for up to 72 hours prior to testing. For long duration transport or storage, specimens should be
frozen at -70°C or colder and transported on dry ice (i.e. -78.5°C) (CDC Influenza Specimen
Collection, CS246972; Copan Universal Transport Media System Package Insert, 44A-Rev.07061).
The cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay Package Insert specifies the same storage and transport
conditions. This specimen stability study evaluated the effect of these specimen storage temperatures
on influenza and RSV detection by the cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay.
Each temperature condition was tested using a sample panel containing a positive sample (3x LOD)
and a negative sample. The positive sample contained A/Brisbane/59/2007 at 6.0×10-3 TCID /mL),
50
B/Malaysia/2506/04 at 1.2×10-2 TCID /mL, and RSV-A 2006 Isolate at 1.2×100 TCID /mL)
50 50
spiked into negative NPS in UTM sample matrix at 3x LOD concentration. Influenza and RSV
strains used were from the same source as identified in the “Detection Limit” section of this
summary. The negative sample contained negative NPS in UTM sample matrix.
Five (5) positive and five negative samples were tested using the cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV
assay immediately after spiking. Other samples were stored at -80°C for 30 days; and at 4°C for 2, 3,
and 7 days. At each time point, another five positive and five negative samples were tested using the
cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay. Samples stored at -80°C were thawed prior to testing.
A total of 60 runs were performed in this study. Runs were performed on 14 cobas® Liat Analyzers
and used 4 lots of cobas® Liat tubes.
Table 5 below shows the results from this study. The cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay
yielded the expected result for positive (“Influenza A Detected, Influenza B Detected, RSV
Detected”) and negative (“Influenza A Not Detected, Influenza B Not Detected, RSV Not
Detected”) samples in all replicates tested at each time point.

Overall, the study results show that nasopharyngeal swab samples may be stored at -80°C for up to
30 days and at 4°C for up to 7 days prior to testing. The results support the package insert
instructions that specimens may be refrigerated (2-8°C) for up to 72 hours (3 days); and that, for
long duration transport or storage, specimens should be frozen at -70°C or colder and transported on
dry ice.

Performance using Fresh vs. Frozen Specimen
The cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay was tested by comparing its performance using fresh
and frozen specimens. One (1) influenza A (A/Brisbane/59/07), one influenza B
(B/Malaysia/2506/04), and one RSV strain (RSV-A 2006 Isolate) was individually spiked into
nasopharyngeal swab in UTM matrix at different viral loads, including levels near the LOD and
levels reflecting the clinical sample range. Influenza and RSV strains used were from the same
source as identified in the “Detection Limit” section of this summary. For each strain, at least 60
samples were tested immediately while at least another 60 samples were frozen at -80°C for 7 days,
thawed and then tested. Ten (10) negative samples were also tested fresh and after being frozen at -
80°C for 7 days. The negative sample consisted of negative NPS in UTM sample matrix.
A total of 381 runs were performed in this study. Runs were performed on 26 cobas® Liat Analyzers
using one lot of cobas® Liat tubes.

Note: Ct Average (Ave.) and Ct Standard Deviation (SD) for Negative sample is that of the IPC.
Fresh and frozen positive samples demonstrated 100% detection across all levels of viral load,
including those near LOD. Ct values were also very similar between fresh and frozen samples. Fresh
and frozen negative samples all demonstrated 0% detection. The results showed that freezing and
thawing samples had no effect on the detection of Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV by the cobas®
Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay.
d. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Detection (LOD) of the cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay was tested using three
strains of Influenza A (A/Brisbane/10/2007, A/Brisbane/59/2007, and A/NY/01/2009), two strains of
Influenza B (B/Malaysia/2506/04 and B/Florida/04/06), and two strains of RSV (RSV-A 2006
isolate and RSV-B Ch93(18)-18). The LOD was determined by limiting dilution studies using these
titered viruses. The viruses were spiked into nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) in UTM sample matrix,
and then tested using the cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay. The LOD was determined as the
lowest virus concentration that was detected ≥95% of the time (i.e., concentration at which at least
19 out of 20 replicates tested positive).
Virus strains (Table 7 below) were cultured and re-titered using TCID procedure by a third party
50
laboratory before their use in LOD determination. Each characterized strain was first adjusted to the
highest log TCID /mL in UTM as diluent.

To prepare the testing sample, the virus at different concentrations was spiked into a pooled NPS in
UTM sample matrix. NPS samples were collected throughout the study period from healthy donors
that did not show any flu-like symptoms. The swabs were eluted in UTM, pooled, and then tested to
confirm that the matrix pool was negative for Influenza A, Influenza B and RSV. Virus was spiked
into the NPS in UTM sample matrix at no more than 5% the final volume to prepare the test sample.
For each run, the spiked sample was tested using the cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay
following the Instructions for Use. Dilutions of each virus strain were first tested in triplicates. The
lowest concentration at which all three replicates tested positive was treated as the tentative LOD for
each strain. The LOD was then confirmed by testing at least 20 replicates with concentrations at the
tentative LOD. The confirmed LOD of each strain was determined as the lowest concentration
resulting in positive detection of at least 19 out of 20 replicates. If more than one replicate is
detected as negative, a two-fold or higher concentration of virus was tested with 20 additional
replicates. The process was iterated until the concentration at which the virus was detected in at least
19 of 20 replicates.
A total of 263 runs were performed in this study. Runs were performed on 22 cobas® Liat Analyzers
using three lots of cobas® Liat assay tubes.

strains (including 3 H1N1 pdm09 strains), 12 Influenza A/H3 strains (including one H3N2v strain),
one Influenza A/H7N9 strain, and one Influenza A/H5N1 reassortant strain. Influenza B strains
included strains from both the Victoria lineage and Yamagata lineage. RSV strains included both
RSV Type A and Type B strains.
Cultured viral strains were obtained from vendors. All strains were frozen and were accompanied by
Certificate of Analysis including TCID /mL or CEID /mL titer information. Each viral strain under
50 50
test was serially diluted in 10 fold increments in UTM using the same procedure as that for the LOD
study. The virus was then spiked in negative NPS in UTM sample matrix, and the spiked sample was
tested using the cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay following the Instructions for Use. Each
viral strain was tested at the LOD for strains used in LOD studies, and at “near LOD” level for other
strains. To estimate “near LOD” level, each strain was first tested at 1.0×102 TCID /mL or 1.0×102
50
CEID /mL, and then higher or lower concentrations (as appropriate) until all triplicate runs at a
50
concentration were detected, and gave a Ct between 31 and 34. Given that the Ct at LOD was 31-34
based on LOD study data, a Ct value in this range was used to estimate the “near LOD” level.
A total of 243 runs were performed on 20 cobas® Liat Analyzers using three lots of cobas® Liat
tubes.
Table 9 below shows the strains tested for reactivity and the “near LOD” concentration of each strain
that yielded 3 / 3 positive results.

Data demonstrates that the cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay is reactive against all strains at
the specified concentrations tested.
The cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay was shown to be reactive against viral strains with
titers ranging from 10-2 to 103 TCID /mL or CEID /mL. The observed difference in titers is most
50 50
likely due to the fact that TCID /mL or CEID /mL determination and RT-PCR testing measure
50 50
different targets. TCID /mL or CEID /mL is the measure of infectious virus titer, or the virus
50 50
required to produce a cytopathic effect in 50% of inoculated tissue culture cells. This is a measure of
only live, intact virus, and takes into account the infection and cytopathtic efficiency of the virus for
the host cells. On the other hand, PCR-based assay detect nucleic acids, including that from intact
and non-intact virions, and free nucleic acids in solution. Because of this measurement difference,
TCID /mL or CEID /mL can vary widely for a substantially equivalent quantity of RNA, and vice
50 50
versa, resulting in the difference observed. Also, titering methods have been reported to have an
inherent variability of up to one order of magnitude, which also may contribute to the observed
difference (Propagation and purification of influenza virus, GE Healthcare Life Sciences,

In addition, based on in silico analysis, there is no evidence to suggest that the observed difference in
analytical reactivity is principally caused by sequence mismatch between the primer/probes of the
cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay to the strains tested.
f. Analytical Specificity:
A cross reactivity study was carried out to evaluate the cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay’s
potential cross-reactivity with microorganisms that may be present in nasopharyngeal swab samples.
The cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay was evaluated against a panel containing human
genomic DNA and 35 microorganisms. Bacteria and Candida albicans were tested at ≥106 CFU/mL,
and viruses were tested at ≥105 TCID /mL, or the highest available concentration. For
50
Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, testing was performed with genomic
DNA due to difficulties in propagation of these bacteria. Each microorganism was spiked into
negative NPS in UTM matrix at the concentration indicated in Table 10 below. The spiked volume
did not exceed 5% of the sample volume. The spiked samples were tested using the cobas® Liat
Influenza A/B & RSV assay in triplicate. A control of negative NPS in UTM matrix and no
microorganisms was also tested.
A total of 114 runs were performed on 13 cobas® Liat Analyzers using 6 lots of cobas® Liat assay
tubes.

Results show that substances at the concentrations tested did not interfere in the detection of
influenza A, influenza B and RSV strains.
h. Potential Microbial Interference Study:
A potentially interfering microorganism study was conducted to evaluate whether microorganisms
that may be present in nasopharyngeal swab samples can interfere in the detection of Influenza A,
Influenza B or RSV by the cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay. The panel of human genomic
DNA and 35 microorganisms tested in the cross-reactivity study was tested for potential
interference. Bacteria and Candida albicans were tested at ≥106 CFU/mL and viruses were tested at
≥105 TCID /mL or the highest available concentration, in the presence of one Influenza A strain,
50
one Influenza B strain and one RSV strain at 3x LOD concentrations in negative nasopharyngeal
swab in UTM matrix. For Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, testing was
performed with genomic DNA due to difficulties in propagation of these bacteria.
Interfering microorganism testing was performing using a positive sample comprised of
A/Brisbane/59/2007 at 6.0×10-3 TCID /mL, B/Malaysia/2506/04 at 1.2×10-2 TCID /mL), and
50 50
RSV-A 2006 Isolate at 1.2×100 TCID50/mL, spiked into negative NPS in UTM sample matrix (3x
LOD concentration). Each potentially interfering microorganism was spiked into each sample at the
concentration indicated in Table 14. The spiked volume did not exceed 5% of the sample volume.
The spiked samples were tested using the cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay in triplicate. A
control comprised of the positive sample and no interfering microorganism was also tested.
A total of 111 runs were performed on 12 cobas® Liat Analyzers using three lots of cobas® Liat assay
tubes

i. Carry-Over Study:
A study was conducted to demonstrate that the single-use, self-contained cobas® Liat assay tube and
the cobas® Liat System are not susceptible to carry-over contamination when alternating high
positive and negative samples are tested. High positive samples consisted of an influenza A virus
spiked into negative nasopharyngeal swab in UTM matrix at a concentration greater than that
expected in 95% or more of specimens of diseased patients in the intended use population. In clinical
studies, the lowest Ct values of Influenza A detected specimens, which corresponds to the highest
concentration specimens, was approcimately12 to 13. The highest titer available for Influenza
A/Brisbane/59/07 allowed for a test concentration of 7.1×103 TCID50/mL. This test concentration
gave a Ct of appromately12.7. To test the worst case scenario, this highest available concentration of
Influenza A was used as the high positive sample concentration. Negative samples contained
negative nasopharyngeal swab in UTM matrix.
Twenty (20) high positive and 20 negative samples were tested on each of two cobas® Liat Systems
(i.e. 40 high positive and 40 negative samples in total). High positive and negative samples were run
alternating analyzer-to-analyzer and run-to-run. All 40 high positive samples tested were correctly
reported as “Influenza A Detected”. All 40 negative samples tested were correctly reported as
“Influenza A Not Detected”. There was no carry-over or cross contamination observed during this
study.
j. Assay cut-off:
The assay cutoff for each analyte in terms of cycle threshold (Ct) was determined based on two
considerations: (1) the Ct cutoff should be greater than the latest Ct values of positive runs at the
LOD of the virus strains tested to ensure analytical sensitivity; and (2) the Ct cutoff should be early
enough to minimize the risk of false positive detection to ensure the specificity for target detection.
For the Influenza A, A/Brisbane/59/07 had the latest Ct in the LOD studies, generating an average
LOD Ct of 34.1 with a standard deviation of 0.97. As such, the latest expected Ct value of positive
runs at the LOD was calculated to be 36.7. The earliest Ct for negative samples was 37.2. Therefore,
the Ct cutoff for Influenza A was set at 37.0.
Similarly, for Influenza B, B/Florida/04/06 had the latest Ct in LOD studies, generating an average
LOD Ct of 33.7 with a standard deviation of 0.72. As such, the latest expected Ct value of positive
runs at the LOD was calculated to be 35.6. The earliest Ct for negative samples was 42.0. Therefore,
the Ct cutoff for Influenza B was set at 38.5.
For RSV, RSV-B Ch 93(18)-18 had the latest Ct in LOD studies, generating an average LOD Ct of
33.0 with a standard deviation of 0.90. As such, the latest expected Ct value of positive runs at the
LOD was calculated to be 35.4. The earliest Ct for negative samples was 37.7. Therefore, the Ct
cutoff for RSV was set at 37.3.
These Ct cut-offs were further verified in clinical studies.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Prospective Study:
Clinical performance characteristics of the cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay were evaluated
in multi-site prospective studies during the 2013-2014 and the 2014-2015 influenza seasons in the
U.S. A total of 12 investigational sites (CLIA waived sites) throughout the U.S. participated in the
study. To be enrolled in the study, patients had to be presenting at the participating study sites with
flu-like symptoms, and provided informed consents.
Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples were prospectively collected and tested at 6 of the 12 sites in
the 2013-2014 influenza season from January 2014 to May 2014, and at 9 of the 12 sites in the 2014-
2015 influenza season from October 2014 to April 2014. Three (3) of the 12 sites participated in the
study during both time periods.
A FDA-cleared multiplexed nucleic acid amplification test for Influenza A, B, and RSV was
performed by a central reference laboratory as the comparator method for this study.
One NPS sample, placed into UTM after specimen collection, was used for the cobas® Liat Influenza
A/B & RSV assay testing according to the product instructions for use. The remaining sample in
UTM was labeled and stored frozen at -80°C for later shipment to the central reference laboratory
for comparator testing.
PCR and bi-directional sequencing were used to investigate discordant results between the cobas®
Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay and the comparator test. Nested PCR was used to increase the
sensitivity of the PCR/sequencing method which uses primers that are distinguished from those used
in the cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay.
A total of 1421 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens eluted in VTM were enrolled in this study.
Of those, 41 specimens did not meet eligibility criteria. Additionally, 17 and 13 specimens were
excluded due to invalid results from the cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay and the comparator
assay, respectively. A total of 1350 prospective NPS specimens were included in the performance
analysis. Patient age and gender distribution for all the 1421 prospective specimens is presented in
Table 15 below.

Compared to the comparator test, the performance of the cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay
for influenza A, influenza B and RSV in the prospective study was also analyzed by study site and
by patient age group. The cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay demonstrated similar
performance for influenza A, influenza B and RSV across study sites and patient age groups.
The Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay detected six mixed influenza A, B, and
RSV infections in this prospective clinical evaluation. One (1) sample tested positive for influenza
A and influenza B by the Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay, while the comparator assay and/or
PCR-sequencing results were negative for influenza A and influenza B. Four (4) samples tested
positive for influenza A and RSV, while the comparator assay was positive for influenza A and
RSV for two of these samples, positive for influenza A and negative for RSV for one sample, and
negative for influenza A and positive for RSV for one sample; PCR-sequencing of the two
discrepant samples yielded negative results. One (1) sample tested positive for influenza B and
RSV, and the comparator assay result was also positive for influenza B and RSV. No samples
tested positive for influenza A, B, and RSV.

Insert: “Dual infections of Influenza A and Influenza B are rare. If the test result is “Influenza A
Detected” and “Influenza B Detected”, the assay should be repeated with the same patient
specimen, or if possible, with a newly collected specimen. Specimens that have repeat “Influenza
A Detected” and “Influenza B Detected” results should be sent to a laboratory for confirmatory
testing.”
b. Retrospective Study:
In addition to the prospective clinical study, retrospective NPS samples were obtained from two
reference laboratories. Specimens obtained were collected in the 2013 – 2014 influenza season. All
samples were archived at -80ºC upon receipt at IQuum. A total of 300 selected retrospective samples
were distributed to and tested at 3 of the 12 sites. The retrospective samples were worked into the
daily workload of those sites for testing.
The same FDA-cleared multiplexed nucleic acid amplification test for Influenza A, B and RSV that
was used in the prospective study was also the comparator test for this study.
The same PCR and bi-directional sequencing method that was used in the prospective study for
investigating discordances between the cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay and the comparator
method was also utilized in this study.
Of the 300 enrolled NPS specimens, no cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay result was obtained
for five specimens due to invalid results. These specimens were excluded from the data analysis, but
are reported as a part of the invalid rate. Three (3) specimens had an invalid comparator result (i.e.
target and internal control not detected), and were removed from the performance analyses.
As such, 292 retrospective NPS specimens were available for performance analyses.
Compared to the comparator test, the performance of the cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay
for influenza A, influenza B and RSV in this retrospective study are presented in Table 19, Table 20,
and Table 21 below, respectively:

PCR/sequencing.
Compared to the comparator test, the performance of the cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay
for influenza A, influenza B and RSV in the retrospective study was also analyzed by study site.
The cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay demonstrated similar performance for influenza A,
influenza B and RSV across study sites.
The Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay detected two mixed influenza A, B, and
RSV infections in retrospective clinical evaluation. Both samples tested positive for influenza B
and RSV by the Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay, while the comparator assay was positive for
influenza B and RSV for one of these samples, and positive for influenza B and negative for RSV
for one sample; PCR-sequencing of the discrepant sample yielded positive result for RSV.
c. cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV Invalid Rate Analysis:
During the clinical study testing prospective and retrospective clinical NPS in UTM specimens, the
cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay initial invalid rate was 1.8% (29/1,656 specimens, 95% CI:
1.2% - 2.5%). Of these 29 specimens with initial invalid results, 5 specimens had 2 invalid or
aborted runs, 16 specimens had 1 invalid run and were not repeated due to unavailability of residual
samples, and 8 specimens had an initial invalid run and a repeat test per product instructions for use
yielded a valid result.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values:
In the cobas® Liat Influenza A/B & RSV assay prospective clinical study (described in the “Clinical
Studies” section above), a total of 313 NPS specimens were determined to be evaluable during the 2013-
2014 influenza season from January 2014 to May 2014. The number and percentage of influenza A,

N. Instrument Name:
cobas® Liat System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The cobas® Liat System functions as a point-of-care platform with sample-to-answer capabilities in
which all sample processing steps as well as detection are carried out using a single-use, disposable
cobas® Liat Tube.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of
product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
A sample barcode is scanned or a sample ID entered into the cobas® Liat System during the assay run
process. After scanning the sample barcode, the corresponding sample is loaded directly into a cobas®
Liat Tube using a transfer pipette. After the tube is capped, the tube barcodes is scanned by the cobas®
Liat System and the tube is inserted into the system to start the test.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimen sampling and handling during the assay is controlled automatically using multiple sample
processing modules contained within the cobas® Liat System. The sample processing modules are
composed of two assemblies, a moving side assembly comprised of multiple sample processing plungers
and clamps and a fixed side assembly. When performing an assay, a cobas® Liat Tube is inserted into
the tube slot of a cobas® Liat System. The plungers and clamps selectively compress the cobas® Liat
Tube segments against the fixed side assembly to release reagents from the segments, move the sample
from one segment to another, and control reaction conditions.
5. Calibration:
Not required. The cobas® Liat Tube is single use component of a closed system.
6. Quality Control:
Quality control is addressed for each specific FDA-cleared assay to be run on the instrument.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the “Performance
Characteristics” Section above:
Not applicable.
