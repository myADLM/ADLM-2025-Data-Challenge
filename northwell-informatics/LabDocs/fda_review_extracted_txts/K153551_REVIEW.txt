streptavidin-biotinylated CCP complex. Anti-CCP antibodies in the sample binds to the CCP
coated microparticles. After washing, the particles are mixed with the Lite Reagents which
contains acridinium ester labeled anti-human IgG. After incubation, the particles are washed
and then added with Acid Reagent and Base Reagent to initiate the chemiluminescent
reaction. The result is measured as relative light units (RLUs). The amount of anti-CCP IgG
present in the patient sample is calculated for U/mL based on obtained RLU against the lot-
specific master curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance: The results met the sponsor’s pre-determined acceptance
criteria for each study.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision: The precision of the ADVIA Centaur aCCP assay was evaluated by testing
eight serum samples containing various concentrations of anti-CCP antibody. Each
sample was run in duplicate, twice a day, for 20 days with one reagent lot (total of 80
replicates per sample). The results are summarized in the table below.

Reproducibility: To evaluate lot-to-lot reproducibility, six samples with anti-CCP
antibody concentration at various levels across the measuring range (2.12, 3.48, 6.29,
40.73, 54.15, and 111.48 U/mL) were tested. Each sample was tested in replicates of
five per run, two runs on two instruments using three difference reagent lots. Mean
and %CV for each sample were calculated and %CV values for between-lot
reproducibility were from 5.4% to 6.9% for all samples.
Site-to site reproducibility was evaluated by testing a total of five samples at three
sites with one reagent and calibrator lot and one quality control (QC) lot. The
samples were run in replicates of five per day for five days at each site, to generate a
total of 75 data points for each sample. Data were analyzed for within-run, between-
run, between site and total precision. The results are summarized in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity: Linearity was evaluated according to the CLSI protocol EP6-A. Three
serum samples containing high levels of anti-CCP IgG were mixed with a pool of
negative serum. Two sample dilution series were tested in replicates of five using
two lots of reagent. One sample dilution series with concentration ranging from 0.18
to 76.18 U/mL was tested using one lot of reagent. The results are summarized as

The ADVIA Centaur aCCP assay is linear from 0.40–200.00 U/mL.
Hook effect: To evaluate a potential hook effect, three high positive serum samples
with anti-CCP antibody concentrations above the assay measuring range (6,007.38,
4,426.99, and 2,138.78 U/mL) were examined. No hook effect was observed up to
3,170.88 U/mL.
Dilution study: The study was done to evaluate the use of the ADVIA Centaur Multi-
diluent 1 as an appropriate sample diluent for the assay as well as to characterize any
recovery bias due to the matrix used upon dilution. Two anti-CCP serum samples
with anti-CCP concentrations of approximately 140 and 180 U/mL were used. A
manual dilution of 1/10 for each sample was prepared using ADVIA Centaur Multi-
diluent 1. Samples were tested neat and manually diluted in the ADVIA Centaur

aCCP assay in replicates of four. The study supports a 1/10 dilution of sample for use
in the ADVIA Centaur aCCP assay
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: There is no recognized standard or reference material for anti-CCP
antibodies. The ADVIA Centaur aCCP assay is standardized using internal reference
standards.
Value assignment: The ADVIA Centaur in-house aCCP Master Standards and
ADVIA Centaur aCCP Adjusters are expressed in arbitrary Axis-Shield units (U/mL)
and prepared gravimetrically from an in house reference standard. The ADVIA
Centaur aCCP Master Standards are manufactured using a pool of high titer anti-CCP
positive plasmas with a known assigned anti-CCP IgG value in U/mL. The pool is
tittered to fixed target concentrations in order to achieve the ten ADVIA Centaur
aCCP Master Standard levels. The Master standards contain ten levels (0, 0.5. 7.5,
10, 15, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200 U/mL) of anti-CCP IgG target concentrations spanning
the assay range of 0.0 to 200 U/ml. The standards are used to generate a lot-specific
Master Curve by performing the testing on multiple instrument systems over several
days to ensuring standard curve determines the relationship between the defined
analyte levels and the RLUs. These concentrations and RLUs become the lot-specific
Master Curve which is provided as barcodes on the Master Curve Card.
The ADVIA Centaur aCCP calibrators, quality controls, and MCMs are manufactured
to target anti-CCP IgG levels by using a pool of high titer anti-CCP positive plasmas.
The value assignment is performed by testing against the ADVIA Centaur Master
Standards and the target CCP concentration is assigned to each of calibrators, quality
controls and MCMs.
Stability:
The un-opened (shelf life), open-vial, and on-board stability studies were each
performed using multiple lots of regent, calibrators and quality controls. The results
support the following stability claims:
Kit Reagent Pack Un-opened 12 months at 2–8°C
Open-vial 60 days at 2–8°C
On-board 60 days
Calibrators Un-opened 12 months at 2–8°C
Open-vial 90 days at 2–8°C
On-board 8 hours
Calibration interval 35 days
Quality Controls Un-opened 12 months at 2–8°C
Open-vial 90 days at 2–8°C
On-board 8 hours

The stability of MCMs was determined to have the same stability claim as calibrator
materials:
MCMs Un-opened 12 month at 2–8°C
Open-vial 90 days at 2–8°C
On-board 8 hours at 2–8°C
Sample stability: The sample stability was established in K083868. The specimens
are stable up to 22 hours at room temperature, 14 days at 2–8°C and up to two
freeze/thaw cycles.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying four serum samples in five
replicates per sample over three days with two lots of reagents, calibrators and kit
controls. Sixty data points per lot were generated. LoB for each lot was calculated
separately at the 95th percentile using the non-parametric method. The LoB for two
lots was determined to be 0.22 U/mL and 0.24 U/mL. The claimed LoB value is 0.24
U/mL.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by assaying four samples with low
level anti-CCP antibody concentration. Each sample was tested in replicates of five
over three days on two reagent lots. LoD value was calculated as the LoB + 1.645 x
SD of the replicates for the low level samples. The LoD of the aCCP assay for the
two lots were determined to be 0.30 and 0.32 U/mL. The claimed LoD is 0.40 U/mL.
The Limit of Quantification (LoQ) was determined by assaying additional four
samples with low concentration level of anti-CCP antibodies using two lots of
reagent. The determined LoQ were equal to the LoD and not higher than 0.40 U/mL.
The lower limit of measuring range is determined as 0.4 U/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interference: Three serum samples (negative, low positive, and high
positive) were spiked separately with endogenous interferents. The control samples
were prepared for each interfering substance by spiking with the same volume of
diluents. Each sample was tested in five replicates and the percent difference was
calculated by comparing to a corresponding control sample. The interferents tested
were: Bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated; 20 and 40 mg/dL), Hemoglobin (500
and 1000 mg/dL), Triglycerides (2450 mg/dL), Lipemia (500 and 1500 mg/dL),
Rheumatoid Factor (200 IU/mL), IgG (3 and 6 g/dL), Total Protein (12 g/dL), and
Biotin (30 and 500 ng/dL). No interference was detected in the samples up to the
concentrations listed in the table below.

Analytical cross-reactivity: Cross-reactivity with other autoantibodies commonly
found in autoimmune disease was tested in the presence and absence of anti-CCP IgG
using the ADVIA Centaur aCCP assay. Autoantibodies evaluated in the study
included Sm, RNP, SSB, Scl-70, Jo-1, Ribosomal P, M2, TPO, dsDNA, SSA and
Chromatin. Five serum samples with anti-CCP concentration at 3.32, 5.35, 10.33,
39.80 and 103.58 U/mL were tested by spiking the serum samples containing each of
the autoimmune analytes. Each sample was tested in five replicates and the percent
difference was calculated by comparing to corresponding control (unspiked) sample.
No interference was observed for the tested autoimmune analyses.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off was determined as follows:
Positive Negative
ADVIA Centaur aCCP ≥ 5 U/mL < 5 U/mL
2. Comparison studies:

collected in five different types of collection tubes: plastic serum tube, plastic serum
separator tube (SST), plastic K2-EDTA plasma tube, and plastic Lithium Heparin
tube. These matched serum/plasma samples with concentration ranging from 0.41 to
180.82 U/mL were tested using one lot of reagent. The Passing-Bablok regression
analysis was performed by comparing the results of samples with different matrix to
the results of corresponding serum samples. The results were shown as follows.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Clinical Specificity:
The 767 serum samples used in the clinical validation for the ADVIA Centaur aCCP
assay include 307 samples from patients diagnosed with RA and 460 samples from
patients with other potentially cross-reacting diseases. RA subjects were classified
according to the 2010 ACR (American College of Rheumatology) criteria. Clinical
sensitivity and specificity to aid in diagnosis of RA are summarized in the following
table:
Clinical Diagnosis of RA
Positive Negative Total
ADVIA Positive 209 13 222
Centaur aCCP Negative 98 447 545
Total 307 460 767
Clinical Sensitivity: 68.08% (95% CI: 62.54–73.26%)
Clinical Specificity: 97.17% (95% CI: 95.22–98.49%)
The table below shows the results for non-RA samples tested with ADVIA Centaur
aCCP:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected value in the normal population is “negative”. Anti-CCP antibody levels
were analyzed in a cohort of 127 apparently healthy donors (47 females and 80 males,
ages 21 to 77 years, with an average and median age of 41 years) using the ADVIA
Centaur aCCP. The results are shown as follows:
Total Male Female
(n=127) (n=80) (n=47)
Median 0.06 U/mL 0.05 U/mL 0.07 U/mL
95% percentile 0.37 U/mL 0.35 U/mL 0.37 U/mL
99% percentile 1.27 U/mL 1.66 U/mL 0.49 U/mL
