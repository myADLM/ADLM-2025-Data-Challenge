L. Test Principle:
The determination of soluble antigen concentration by turbidimetric methods involves the
reaction with specific antiserum to form insoluble complexes. When light is passed through
the suspension formed a portion of the light is transmitted and focused onto a photodiode by
an optical lens system. The amount of transmitted light is indirectly proportional to the
specific protein concentration in the test sample. At the end of the reaction, the Antigen
Excess Control is added to detect potential antigen excess.Concentrations are automatically
calculated by reference to a calibration curve stored within the instrument.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All manufacturer’s acceptance criteria were met for all studies.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision and reproducibility of the new assay was evaluated by studies based on
CLSI EP05-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement
Methods; Approved Guideline–Second Edition; five sample preparations for each
matrix were tested in duplicate in two runs per day over 21 days using three analyzers
for a total of 84 replicates per sample. A summary of the results for each sample

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study evaluating the analytical measuring range of the standard sample
dilution (1 + 0 for CSF and urine and 1 + 199 for serum) was performed following
CLSI EP6-A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A
Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline. A dilution series composed of
proportional dilutions of a high pool with a low pool for each sample matrix was
tested in three replicates.
The linearity of this assay using the serum matrix has been confirmed using a serially
diluted serum sample over the range of 1,960–74,251 mg/L. The linear regression
analysis was determined as y = 1.00x + 9.17.
The linearity of this assay using the urine matrix has been confirmed using a serially
diluted urine sample over the range of 8.1–398 mg/L. The linear regression analysis
was determined as y = 1.00x + 0.12.
The linearity of this assay using the CSF matrix has been confirmed using a serially
diluted CSF sample over the range of 9.2–373 mg/L. The linear regression analysis
was determined as y = 1.00x + 0.22.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The master calibrator is prepared from pooled human sera and is used to control
calibration between lots. The master calibrator is used to assign albumin values to
assay calibrators and controls during production of each batch of kits; it is traceable to
ERM-DA470k/IFCC.
Kit Stability:

manufacture when stored at recommended temperature 2–8°C) were previously
performed on the 510(k)-cleared kit Human Albumin CSF Kit for use on SPAPLUS
(K121045) demonstrating stability up to at least 18 months. This kit contains
components manufactured using the same raw materials as the test device, with the
exception of the high and low control materials, which are manufactured using a
different buffer. Additional real time stability was therefore assessed using three
manufacturing lots of control materials. Data supports an 18-month stability claim.
Open-vial stability–Testing established that the Optilite Low Level Albumin Kit
Reagent, Calibrator and Controls can be stored, opened at 2–8°C for up to 3 months.
On-board stability–Testing established that the Optilite Low Level Albumin Kit
Reagent can be stored on-board the Optilite Analyzer for 30 days at 8–12o C,
provided that the power is left switched on as stated in the product insert.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limits of the assay were determined for all sample matrices. The
evaluations were based on CLSI EP17-A, Protocols for Determination of Limits of
Detection and Limits of Quantitation. Study results follow the explanation below:
Limit of Blank (LoB): The LoB is defined as the highest result expected in a sample
that contains no analyte based on the 95th percentile distribution of blank results.
The LoB serum sample was sample diluent, the LoB urine sample was normal donor
urine, and the LoB CSF sample was a synthetic CSF fluid that mimics natural CSF
without the presence of albumin. The LoB sample was tested 60 times and the mean
and standard deviation (SD) were calculated.
Limit of Detection (LoD): The LoD is defined as the lowest amount of analyte in a
sample that can be reliably detected. The LoD was calculated from the LoB and the
combined SDs of the five LoQ samples: LoD = LoB + [(1.645 x SDs)].
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ): The LoQ study was performed by analyzing five
different samples with a concentration within ±10% of the lowest calibrator value
used at the standard dilution. These samples were tested over five days with one batch
of reagent to give 60 replicate results. This data demonstrated that the total error (TE)
is < 10% at the bottom of the reference range. Samples were diluted with sample
diluent so that the concentrations were close to the bottom of the measuring range at
the standard sample dilution (2200 mg/L). Urine samples were spiked with purified
human albumin powder so that the concentrations were close to the bottom of the
measuring range at the standard sample dilution (11 mg/L). CSF samples were
diluted with synthetic CSF so that the concentrations were close to the bottom of the
measuring range at the standard sample dilution (11 mg/L).
The claimed analytical sensitivity for each kit is summarized below:

two sample pools. Minimal assay interference effects were observed when tested
with the following substances:

medical decision point (116.5–159.5 mg/L) and one with a concentration within 25%

Metronidazole absorbs light at 340nm, the same wavelength used as the assay, thus
interfering with the assay. The labelling insert includes a caution that this assay is not
suitable for use with patients taking metronidazole.
Antigen Excess: No antigen excess was observed up to a level of 202 times the top of
the calibration curve at the standard 1+0 sample dilution. This is equivalent to
67,384 mg/L.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
For each sample matrix, the results obtained by the Low Level Albumin Kit assay
were compared with the results obtained by the predicate assay. Care was taken to
include samples that had admission diagnoses relevant to the Intended Use of the
assay (e.g., samples from patients with kidney disease were included in the urine
matrix study and samples from patients with central nervous system disorders were
included in the CSF matrix study) although many of the final diagnoses were not
known. Less than 10% of the samples in any of the matrices were contived to cover
the measuring range. Only samples within both assays’ measuring range were
included in the analysis of the results:

a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
Not applicable
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. is not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The predicate reference ranges for albumin in serum and urine were tested and verified in
accordance with CLSI C28-A3, Defining, Establishing and Verifying Reference Intervals
in the Clinical Laboratory using samples from 50 apparently healthy subjects for each
analyte. The reference range for albumin in CSF is taken a published literature reference
range for albumin in CSF1.
Normal adult albumin Range
Serum 35,000–52,000 mg/L
Urine < 30 mg/L
CSF < 350 mg/L
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
