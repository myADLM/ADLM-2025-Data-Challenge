and essential performance, collateral standard: electromagnetic compatibility
L. Test Principle:
The AG-607 Blood Glucose Monitoring System measures glucose amperometrically. The system
is designed as an amperometric measurement device using current generated from the redox
reaction as the measurable response.
The EGS-2003 test strip employs flavin adenine dinucleotide glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-
GDH) enzyme chemistry as the dry reagent assay for glucose in whole blood. This enzyme
assay, with a redox chemical “mediator” reaction, is used to generate an electrical current
proportional to the glucose concentration in the blood sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
These two systems are identical except for the intended use. Therefore there is only one set
of performance data presented here, which is representative of the performance of both
systems.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability studies were performed with venous whole blood samples at five
glucose concentration ranges using three test strip lots and ten AG-607 blood glucose
meters. Ten runs were performed on each sample with four replicates run on strip lots
#1 and #2, and two replicates run on strip lot #3, resulting in a total of 40, 40, and 20
replicates for each test strip lot, respectively, at each glucose level. Results are
summarized below:
Glucose 30-50 50-110 110-150 150-250 250-400
Level (mg/dL) (mg/dL) (mg/dL) (mg/dL) (mg/dL)

(mg/dL)
CV (%) 5.6 4.6 3.5 3.3 3.4
N 100 100 100 100 100
Intermediate precision was evaluated using three glucose control solutions, Level I,
Level II, and Level III using three test strip lots and 10 AG-607 blood glucose meters.
One run was performed on each of ten days with each glucose control solution, with
three replicates for strip lots #1 and #2, and four replicates for strip lot #3. Results are
summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using ten venous blood glucose samples with glucose
concentrations ranging from 19.7 to 600.0 mg/dL (19.7, 32.5, 73.6, 126.5, 194.9,
279.8, 367.0, 457.5, 538.5, 600.0 mg/dL) as assessed by the reference method (YSI
2300). Each sample was measured five times using the AG-607 meter, and then
measured using a laboratory based reference method (YSI 2300). The results from
regression analysis are summarized below:
y = 0.988x + 1.518; R2 = 0.9995
The meter will display “LO” when the result is less than 20 mg/dL and “HI” when
result is greater than 600 mg/dL. The sponsor validated the “LO” and “HI” functions
and demonstrated that they functioned as intended.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The system is traceable to NIST SRM #917c reference material and calibrated to be
plasma-equivalent.
Control Solution Value Assignment and Stability:
The Andon Glucose Control Solutions Level I, Level II, and Level III were
previously cleared (k110017). Control solutions are stable for 24 months when stored
at 39 to 86ºF (4-30ºC) with relative humidity of <80% with a 90 day stability after
opening when stored at 39 to 86ºF.
Test Strip Stability:
Test strip stability was assessed with accelerated studies and on-going real-time
studies. The testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The manufacture
claims shelf life stability of 24 months when stored at 39 to 86 ºF (4-30 ºC) with
relative humidity of 10-85% and a 5 month stability after opening when stored at 39-
86 ºF with relative humidity of 10-85%.

d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the AG-607 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is 20-600
mg/dL supported by the linearity assay study above (M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed with spiked venous blood samples at two glucose
concentrations (80 and 350 mg/dL) that were prepared and divided into a test (spiked)
pool and a control pool. The potential interferants (2 levels) were added to the sample
and each sample was tested 5 times, and the % difference between the individual
measurements on the meter and the reference method (YSI 2300) results calculated.
The table below lists all substances tested at concentrations with insignificant (<10%)
interference.

User Performance Study
To assess the performance of the AG-607 Blood Glucose Monitoring System in the
hands of lay users, the sponsor performed a study with 350 lay user participants who
collected and tested their own samples. Results were analyzed by comparing capillary
whole blood glucose results obtained by the lay users with the AG-607 Blood
Glucose Monitoring System against results obtained with the same fingerstick blood
samples from the same patients analyzed by laboratory reference method (YSI 2300).
The glucose concentrations in the samples ranged from 40-538 mg/dL as measured by
the laboratory reference method. Results are summarized in the tables below:

5. Calibration:
Calibration of the meter occurs by manual entry of a calibration code that is included
with each vial of test strips.
6. Quality Control:
Three levels of aqueous glucose control solutions are available with this system (level I,
level II, level III) but must be purchased separately. The user must manually enter a
Control Solution testing mode when testing control solutions. Controls are not included
in patient glucose averaging when tested using Control Solution testing mode.
Recommendations on when to test the control materials and troubleshooting steps if the
controls are outside of specifications are provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for
each control level is printed on the test strip vial label.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit study:
To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the AG-607 Blood Glucose Monitoring System
using the EGS-2000 test strips, venous blood samples with hematocrit levels of 20, 30,
42, 50, and 60% were tested at 3 glucose concentrations (50, 120, and 350 mg/dL). The
evaluation included 5 meters, each tested with two replicates using 3 lots of test strips.
Results from the meter were compared to results obtained using a laboratory-based
reference method (YSI 2300). The evaluation of percent bias relative to YSI
demonstrated acceptable performance across the claimed hematocrit range of 20-60%.
2. Altitude study:
To evaluate the effect of altitude on the AG-607 Blood Glucose Monitoring System,
meters were tested at two altitudes above sea level (0 ft and 10,744 ft). Venous whole
blood samples were obtained from 20 volunteers (glucose range 64-334 mg/dL). Results
were compared to results obtained using a laboratory-based reference method (YSI 2300)
and demonstrated that altitudes up to 10,744 feet above sea level have no significant
effect on blood glucose measurements from the AG-607 Blood Glucose Monitoring
System.
3. Sample Volume Study:
To demonstrate the minimum sample volume, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 1.0, and 2.0 μL samples of
venous whole blood at glucose concentrations of 47, 65, 109, 156, 231, 371, and 455
mg/dL were tested. Values obtained were compared to values obtained using a
laboratory-based reference method (YSI 2300). Results support minimum sample volume
of 0.7 μL.
4. Infection Control Study:
As established in k110017. The AG-607 Blood Glucose Meter uses the same case
materials as the predicate device. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the
12

--- Page 13 ---
materials comprising the meters and lancing device by outside commercial testing
demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen
disinfectant, CaviWipes (EPA Registration #46781-8). Robustness studies were also
performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or
external materials for each of the meters and lancing device after 11,000 cleanings and
11,000 disinfection steps with the CaviWipes. The robustness studies were designed to
stimulate 3 years of multiple-patient use and 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was
reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
5. Environmental testing for temperature and relative humidity:
Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated for temperatures ranging
from 50°F to 104°F (10°C to 40°C) and relative humidity between 25 and 80% R.H.
using 3 glucose concentration levels of venous whole blood (75, 120, and 290 mg/dL).
Individual glucose measurements were compared to the reference method (YSI) and
percent bias were calculated. Results demonstrated that glucose measurements on the
AG-607 Glucose Monitoring System were not affected at temperatures ranging from
50°F to 104°F (10°C to 40°C) and relative humidity between 25 to 80% R.H. If the
operating temperature is outside of these conditions, the meter displays an error message
instead of a blood glucose value.
6. EMC and electrical safety:
The sponsor provided appropriate documentation certifying that electromagnetic (EMC)
testing was performed and the device systems were found to be compliant.
7. Readability study: A readability evaluation was conducted which determined that the
reading grade level is at the 8th grade level or less.
8. This device was cleared after the FDA issued final guidance documents for prescription
use blood glucose monitoring systems (BGMS) and over-the-counter use blood glucose
monitoring systems (SMBG). However, the recommendations in the guidance
documents were not followed for this device since the submission was received prior to
the finalization of the guidance documents.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
