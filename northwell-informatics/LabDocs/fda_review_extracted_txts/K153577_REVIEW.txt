See indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The FREND™ Testosterone test is a fluorescent nanoparticle immunoassay designed for
in vitro quantitative measurement of total testosterone in human serum and plasma
(K3EDTA and lithium heparin). Measurements of testosterone are used in the diagnosis
and treatment of disorders involving the male sex hormones (androgens), including
primary and secondary hypogonadism, impotence in males and, in females, hirsutisim
(excessive hair) and virilization (masculinization) due to tumors, polycystic ovaries, and
adrenogenital syndromes.
The FREND™ Testosterone microfluidic flow cartridge is designed for use in the
FREND™ System fluorescent immunoassay reader. The FREND™ Testosterone Test
System is intended for use in clinical laboratories. For in vitro diagnostic use only.
The test is not intended for use in point-of-care settings.

labeled with fluorescence nanoparticles and fluorescence detection by FRENDTM System.
The FREND™ Testosterone test utilizes microfluidic technology and detects immune-
complexes bound to testosterone. Firstly, a 70 µL patient sample is incubated in the
Testosterone Gold Antibody pretreatment tube, where the sample interacts with a
proprietary mix of a pretreatment solution. Secondly, the Test Cartridge is placed on the
warming platform of the heating block and 35 µL of the mixture from Step 1 is
manually loaded into the inlet of the cartridge. The cartridge remains on the warming
platform for 30 seconds, while the sample hydrates the testosterone-biotin fluorescent
bead conjugate and migrates along the test strip. During migration the bound testosterone in
the sample and the testosterone-biotin fluorescent bead conjugates compete to form
antigen-antibody complexes in the test zone. Unbound testosterone-biotin fluorescent
conjugates flow through and bind to the anti- testosterone antibody that is immobilized
on the surface in the reference zone. The cartridge is inserted into the FREND instrument
for analysis where fluorescent signals in the test and reference zones are measured.
Testosterone quantification is based upon the ratio of the intensity of the test and reference
zones. The magnitude of the fluorescent ratio is inversely proportional to the amount of
testosterone in the sample.
There is no calibration needed by the user because each cartridge is coded with the
calibration information generated by the manufacturer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A single lot imprecision study was performed internally as described in the CLSI
protocol EP5-A3. Three serum pools with low, intermediate and high testosterone
levels were assayed in duplicate twice per day for 20 days (80 total measurements per
level). The results are summarized below:
Sample Mean Conc. Repeatability Within Laboratory
Pool (ng/dL) SD CV% SD CV%
1 39.723 4.5 11.2 4.7 11.8
2 202.965 16.7 8.2 17.3 8.5
3 1012.208 54.7 5.4% 57.5 5.7
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was established according to CLSI-EP6-A in three reagent lots using seven
levels of serum testosterone tested in quadruplicate. The range for analyte
concentration was tested from 17 ng/dL to 1650 ng/dL using low and high serum
pools. The low and high pools were mixed to make five intermediate levels. A total
of seven concentrations were tested (17.5, 180.8, 527.2, 850.2, 1203.6, 1509.0,
and 1736.6 ng/dL). The following linear regression equation was obtained:

Sample
Pool	Mean Conc.
(ng/dL)	Repeatability		Within Laboratory	
		SD	CV%	SD	CV%
1	39.723	4.5	11.2	4.7	11.8
2	202.965	16.7	8.2	17.3	8.5
3	1012.208	54.7	5.4%	57.5	5.7

--- Page 6 ---
Y=1.038X – 4.818, R2 = 0.994
Linearity data supports the FREND™ Testosterone reportable range of 20 ng/dL to
1500 ng/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The standards/calibrators are prepared gravimetrically and confirmed by
measurement on the ARCHITECT i 2nd Generation Testosterone assay (k120009),
which is traceable to the USP testosterone. The calibrators are factory calibration.
There is no need for calibration by the operator as the calibration information is
coded in the individual cartridge.
Controls: The sponsor recommends the use of commercially available quality control
material that contains Testosterone as the measurand.
d. Detection limit:
LoB, LoD and LoQ studies were performed according to the CLSI EP17-A
guideline using one lot of reagent.
LoB was performed with five different steroid depleted serum samples with 12
replicates each, which generated a total of 60 replicates.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) for the FREND™ Testosterone was established
using five different low level samples. All samples were each assayed 12 times
over a period of five days using a single reagent lot. Each sample has a total of
60 replicates.
LoQ was determined based on five low samples with concentration between 17
to 20 ng/dL. The sponsor obtained a LoQ value based on <20%CV at sample
concentration of 20 ng/dL.
LoB LoD LoQ
9.46 ng/dL 14.33 ng/dL 20.0 ng/dL
The claimed measuring range of this assay is 20 ng/dL to 1500 ng/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference Studies
Potential interference from common endogenous substances was evaluated in
accordance with CLSI EP7-A2. Interferents were added to normal human sera spiked
with two levels of testosterone, and controls with no interferent were included. The
sponsor defines significant interference as > ±10% difference. No significant
interference was found if recoveries were between 90% to 110% of the expected

“Specimens from patients with heterophilic antibodies, such as anti-mouse (HAMA),
anti-goat (HAGA), or anti-rabbit (HARA) antibodies, may show falsely elevated or
depressed values or may result in an incomplete test. Patients routinely exposed to
animals or animal serum products can be prone to these types of heterophilic
interference.”
Cross Reactivity
The following substances were evaluated for potential cross-reactivity with the
FREND™ Testosterone at two concentrations (low and high testosterone levels).
Testing was done according to the CLSI protocol EP07-A2. Results of the
percent cross reactivity are summarized in the table below.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Comparison studies using 155 serum samples were performed externally. The
nd
comparator method was the Abbott ARCHITECT 2 Generation
Testosterone Assay (predicate device) run on the Abbott ARCHITECT i

Testosterone Test System (20.84 to 1420.33 ng/dL). All samples were assayed
using serum samples split between the candidate device and the comparator
method.
Results from the FREND™ Testosterone on the FREND™ System (y) were
compared with the comparator results (x) by Passing-Bablok regression
analysis, giving a slope of 0.983 (95%CI: 0.944 to 1.00), an intercept of -2.353
(95%CI: -12.0 to 14.36) and a correlation coefficient of 0.977.
