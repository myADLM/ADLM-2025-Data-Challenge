L. Test Principle:
The ARK Oxcarbazepine Metabolite Assay is a homogeneous immunoassay based on
competition between drug in the specimen and Oxcarbazepine Metabolite labeled with the
enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for binding to the antibody reagent.
As the latter binds antibody, enzyme activity decreases. In the presence of drug from the
specimen, enzyme activity increases and is directly proportional to the drug concentration.
Active enzyme converts the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH
that is measured spectrophotometrically as a rate of change in absorbance. Endogenous
serum G6PDH does not interfere with the results because the coenyzme NAD functions only
with the bacterial enzyme used in the assay.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Data for the precision evaluation studies (total and within-laboratory precision) were
collected on a single Beckman Coulter AU480 automated clinical chemistry analyzer.
Each level of control and patient sample was assayed in quadruplicate twice a day
over twenty non-consecutive days. A total of 160 determinations were made for each
sample. One calibration was performed during this interval. A total of 6 samples (3
levels of human serum pooled specimens containing Oxcarbazepine Metabolite, and 3
levels of ARK Oxcarbazepine Metabolite controls) were used in the study.
Mean oxcarbazepine metabolite, standard deviation (SD) and coefficients of variation
(%CVs) were calculated for within-run, between-day, and total precision.

HIGH 160 30.4 1.10 3.6 1.11 3.7 1.55 5.1
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated according to the CLSI EP6-A standard. A series of 8
concentrations (1.00, 3.00, 5.00, 10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, and 50.00 g/mL) in
human serum were prepared by proportionally diluting a spiked high Oxcarbazepine
Metabolite concentration serum sample pool with a negative serum pool.
Two analytical runs of three replicates of each sample (6 replicates total) were
measured for each concentration, and the mean of the measured concentration was
compared to the theoretical expected Oxcarbazepine Metabolite concentrations based
on the first order and second order linear regression analysis.
The linear regression results using the sample concentrations listed above are:
Analyzer Slope Intercept R2
AU480 1.0388 -0.0693 0.9994
This evaluation supports linearity within the claimed measuring range of 1.0 to 37.0
g/mL.
Recovery
An analytical recovery study was conducted on the Beckman Coulter AU480 to
determine the effect of differing ratios of Oxcarbazepine Metabolite enantiomers (S-
or R- enantiomer; ratio hereafter S:R) on recovery by spiking Oxcarbazepine
Metabolite into human serum negative for Oxcarbazepine Metabolite. The results are
as follows:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and Value Assignment:
ARK Oxcarbazepine Metabolite Calibrators and ARK Oxcarbazepine Metabolite
Controls are traceable to a commercial product, and are value assigned by gravimetric
dilution.
Stability:
Shelf life: Accelerated and real-time shelf-life stability study protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be adequate. Accelerated stability
studies were performed to support a shelf-life stability claim until the expiration date
for the ARK Oxcarbazepine Metabolite Calibrators and Controls when stored
unopened at 2-8°C. Real time stability studies to support shelf-life stability claims are
ongoing.
Open vial: The Sponsor’s open vial stability study protocols and acceptance criteria
were reviewed and found to be adequate. Real-time testing for opened vial ARK
Oxcarbazepine Metabolite Calibrators and Controls stability was performed and
supports stability claims of up to 12 months when stored opened at 2 - 8°C.
d. Detection limit:
The LoB was determined using pooled human serum negative for oxcarbazepine
metabolite as the blank sample. A single concentration of oxcarbazepine metabolite
(0.3 g/mL) in serum was tested to assess LoD. To determine the LoB and LoD,
twenty (20) replicates of each sample were tested in each of three (3) runs to yield
sixty (60) replicates of each sample tested, in a single day. The grand mean, standard
deviation, and coefficient of variation for each test sample were calculated to
determine inter-assay precision.
The LOQ of the ARK Oxcarbazepine Metabolite Assay was determined as the lowest
concentration for which acceptable inter-assay precision and recovery is observed

(≤20% CV with ±15% recovery). Multiple low concentration Oxcarbazepine
Metabolite serum samples were prepared gravimetrically. Eight (8) replicates of each
sample were tested in each of five (5) runs to give a minimum of 40 replicates of each
LOQ sample tested. The grand mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation
for each test sample were calculated to determine inter-assay precision.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed according to the CLSI EP09-A3. One-
hundred-Ninety (190) individual human serum samples ranging in concentration from
1.7 g/mL to 36.4 g/mL were measured using the ARK Oxcarbazepine Metabolite
Assay and compared to the results obtained using LC-MS/MS. Results of the Passing
Bablock regression analysis are presented below.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The package insert includes the following statement:
“A reference range for TDM of Oxcarbazepine Metabolite (MHD) has not been well
established. A wide range of MHD serum concentrations (3-35 μg/mL) have been
observed (established by reference methods) in most patients treated with therapeutic
doses of oxcarbazepine1,2,3.”
