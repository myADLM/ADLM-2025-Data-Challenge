for serum and plasma (K2-EDTA, K3-EDTA and Li-Heparin) that combines the
results of the Elecsys HE4 assay, Elecsys CA 125 II assay and menopausal status
into a numerical score.
RCTUEA is intended to aid in assessing whether a premenopausal or
postmenopausal woman who presents with an ovarian adnexal mass is at high or
low likelihood of finding malignancy on surgery. RCTUEA is indicated for
women who meet the following criteria: over age 18; ovarian adnexal mass
present for which surgery is planned, and not yet referred to an oncologist.
RCTUEA must be interpreted in conjunction with an independent clinical and
radiological assessment. The test is not intended as a screening or stand-alone
diagnostic assay.
The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on
Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.
PRECAUTION: RCTUEA should not be used without an independent
clinical/radiological evaluation and is not intended to be a screening test or to
determine whether a patient should proceed to surgery. Incorrect use of
RCTUEA carries the risk of unnecessary testing, surgery, and/or delayed
diagnosis.

I. Device Description:
RCTUEA is a qualitative serum and plasma test that combines the results of two
analytes, HE4 (Elecsys HE4) and CA125 (Elecsys CA 125 II) and menopausal status
into a numerical score between 0.00 and 10.00. The premenopausal or
postmenopausal status must be based on ovarian function determined with
information available from clinical evaluation and medical history. The test system
consists of Elecsys HE4, Elecsys CA 125 II, the RCTUEA Calculator Tool, and the
Elecsys or cobas e immunoassay analyzers. The Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay
analyzers are not capable of calculating the ROMA score. The immunoassays are
performed according to the directions detailed in each product insert.
Both Elecsys HE4 and Elecsys CA 125 II are previously 510(k) cleared Class II
devices (K112624 and K143534, respectively). The Elecsys HE4 assay is an
2

--- Page 3 ---
electrochemiluminescent immunoassay for the quantitative determination of HE4
antigen in human serum and plasma (K2-EDTA, K3-EDTA, and Li-Heparin) on the
Elecsys or cobas e immunoassay analyzers. The assay is to be used as an aid in
monitoring recurrence or progressive disease in patients with epithelial ovarian
cancer. Serial testing for patient HE4 assay values should be used in conjunction
with other clinical methods used for monitoring ovarian cancer. Elecsys CA 125 II
assay is an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay for the quantitative determination
of CA125 in human serum and plasma (di- and tri-potassium EDTA and Li-Heparin)
on the Elecsys or cobas e immunoassay analyzers. The assay is to be used as an aid
in monitoring recurrence or progressive disease in patients with ovarian cancer.
Serial testing for patient CA125 assay values should be used in conjunction with
other clinical methods used for monitoring ovarian cancer.
RCTUEA scores (numerical score from 0.00–10.00) for both premenopausal and
postmenopausal women are calculated using the RCTUEA Calculator Tool to
indicate a low likelihood or high likelihood for finding malignancy on surgery using
the value of the two immunoassays (Elecsys HE4 and Elecsys CA125II).

Adnexal Mass Assessment Score Test System”
L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys HE4 assay is a two-step sandwich immunoassay. First, sample is
incubated with a biotinylated monoclonal HE4-specific antibody and a monoclonal
HE4-specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium to form a sandwich complex. After
addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex bounds to the solid phase
via interaction of biotin and streptavidin. The reaction mixture is aspirated into the
measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of
the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed. A voltage is applied to the
electrode to induce chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a
photomultiplier. The results are determined via a calibration curve that is instrument-
specifically generated by two-point calibration and a master curve provided via the
reagent barcode.
The Elecsys CA 125 II assay is a two-step sandwich immunoassay. First, sample is
incubated with a biotinylated monoclonal CA 125-specific antibody and a
monoclonal CA 125-specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium to form a sandwich
complex. After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex bounds to
the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin. The reaction mixture is
aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured
onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed. A voltage
is applied to the electrode to induce chemiluminescent emission which is measured by
a photomultiplier. The results are determined via a calibration curve that is
instrument-specifically generated by two-point calibration and a master curve
provided via the reagent barcode.
The RCTUEA Calculator Tool is used for calculating the ROMA score. Using the
value of the two analytes, RCTUEA scores (numerical score from 0.00–10.00) for
both premenopausal and postmenopausal will be calculated and will indicate whether
a woman is at low likelihood or high likelihood for finding malignancy on surgery.
Both premenopausal and postmenopausal RCTUEA results will be reported to the
ordering physician who will decide which result to use based on patient's menopausal
status.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
Both Elecsys HE4 and Elecsys CA 125 II are previously 510(k)-cleared Class II
devices. Analytical performance for Elecsys HE4 and Elecsys CA 125 II were
validated in K112624 and K143534, respectively. There has been no
modification of assay methods for Elecsys HE4 or Elecsys CA 125 II since the
original clearance for each assay. Thus, a limited study was done to evaluate the
analytical performance of the RCTUEA.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i. Total Imprecision:
A panel of six samples were tested using one lot each of Elecsys HE4 and
Elecsys CA 125 II reagents and calibrator kits according to each assay’s
package insert. The panel consisted of four human serum samples and
two human plasma samples spiked with recombinant HE4 and CA 125.
Total imprecision was calculated at one site by testing each sample in two
runs with two replicates per run for 21 non-consecutive days (n = 84
replicates per sample). The overall study design was based on CLSI
guideline EP05-A3.
The following table displays the results for the repeatability and with-in
laboratory reproducibility. All data met the manufacturer’s predetermined
acceptance criteria.

iv. Simulation precision:
In order to demonstrate precision of all possible combinations of analytes,
a simulation precision study for the RCTUEA score was conducted based
on the precision profiles of HE4 and CA 125 with different combinations
of values of these two analytes. The statistical analysis of simulation of
RCTUEA score precision showed acceptable precision covering the range
of RCTUEA score from 0 to10.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies for HE4 and CA 125 assay kits were presented in K112624
and K143534, respectively. No new linearity data were presented in this
submission.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and stability studies for the HE4 and CA 125 assay kits were

Calibrators:
Each assay uses its own calibrator and controls.
Elecsys CA125 II Calibrators
The Elecsys CA125 II CalCheck calibration verification solutions comprise
three levels: low, mid, and high. The results are reported in U/mL and the
method has been standardized against the Enzymun-Test CA 125 II method.
This in turn has been standardized against the CA 125 II RIA from Fujirebio
Diagnostics.
Elecsys HE4 Calibrators
The Elecsys HE4 CalCheck5 set contains five lyophilized levels of human
HE4 from OvCar-3 culture in equine serum and has been standardized against
the HE4 EIA method from Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc.
Stability:
Sample Stability: RCTUEA is intended for use with serum and plasma (K -
2
EDTA, K -EDTA, and Li-Heparin). The specimen stability and storage
3
claims are limited to the Elecsys HE4 assay. Samples can be stored for five
hours at 15–25°C, two days at 2–8°C, 12 weeks at −20°C with up to two
freeze/thaw cycles.
Reagent Stability: Users are instructed to refer to the individual stability
information in the package insert of each assay.
Elecsys HE4 is stable when stored at 2–8°C until the expiration date stated on
the label outside of the kit box. The current shelf life of Elecsys HE4 is 12
months.
Elecsys CA125II is table when stored at 2–8°C until the expiration date stated
on the label outside of the kit box. The current shelf life of Elecsys CA125II
is 18 months.
d. Detection limit:
The limits of detection and limits of quantitation reported in each assay’s
package insert are incorporated into the algorithm such that results outside of
the measuring interval are not imported and do not yield an RCTUEA score.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference: Studies were conducted to evaluate the interference of
RCTUEA score by endogenous substances.
10

--- Page 11 ---
Four patient serum samples with RCTUEA scores across the measuring range
(0.80–8.82) were tested in this study. These samples were supplemented with
each interfering substance in increasing concentrations. The control samples
were prepared without corresponding interfering substance. The control
samples and test samples were tested in a single replicate and the RCTUEA
score was calculated. The effect of each interfering substance on the
RCTUEA score was assessed by comparing the measurement of each test
sample to the control. All data met the manufacturer’s predetermined
acceptance criteria and no interferences were seen. The results are presented
in the table below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 187 samples were used for the study. The enrolled patients consist
of 137 diseased patients and 50 apparently healthy women. 105 of the
samples were from premenopausal women, and 82 of the samples were from
postmenopausal women. The premenopausal ROMA range for the samples
was 0.16–10.0 and for the postmenopausal samples was 0.5–9.97. No
samples were excluded from the data analyses. Data analysis was performed
using Deming and Passing-Bablok regression analysis and all data met the
manufacturer’s predetermined acceptance criteria. The results are
summarized in the following table:

b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison was performed to compare the performance of
RUCTEA in serum and K -EDTA plasma. 89 samples matched samples were
2
tested that covered the range of the assays (RCTUEA score 0–10). Deming
regression analysis demonstrated that performance in the two matrices was
equivalent. The data met the manufacturer’s predetermined acceptance
criteria and are presented in the tables below.

Simulated Matrix Comparison Study:
A simulation study was performed to evaluate the worst-case conditions
where both the Elecsys HE4 and Elecsys CA 125II results showed the
maximal matrix effects. The maximal matrix effects were calculated using the
data for the K2-EDTA plasma, K3-EDTA plasma, and Li-Heparin plasma
matrix comparisons that were completed for Elecsys HE4 and Elecsys CA 125
II in K112624 and K143534, respectively. The results of the simulation study
were acceptable.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity/Clinical Specificity:
A clinical study was done to validate RCTUEA in pre- and postmenopausal
women presenting to a generalist with an adnexal mass, for whom a decision
to undergo surgery has been made. The study enrolled 512 patients at the 13
study sites. The patients were female patients over 18, presenting to a
generalist at a general or specialty hospital with an ovarian cyst or an adnexal
mass (defined as a simple, complex or a solid ovarian/pelvic mass) who were
scheduled to undergo surgery. Blood samples were collected from all patients
and tested with Elecsys HE4 and Elecsys CA 125 II.

The Initial Cancer Risk Assessment (ICRA) and all clinical information
relating to the surgical procedures, including imaging reports and final
pathology reports, were collected. All patients underwent surgery and tissues
were examined by local pathologists. An independent pathologist reviewed
all imaging reports, case report forms and histopathology reports from each
patient’s institution pathologist, checking for discrepancies in the data. The
performance of standalone use of ICRA, standalone use of RCTUEA and
adjunctive use of ICRA and RCTUEA were evaluated by comparing to
histopathology results for detecting the presence of ovarian malignancy.
Of the 512 patients, 51 patients were excluded from analysis. The most
common reason for exclusion was no surgery was performed to remove an
adnexal mass. Five additional patients were excluded because there was not
enough sample available for testing, and one patient was excluded because the
Elecsys CA 125 II value was outside of the measuring range of the device. In
the final total of 455 evaluable patients, 249 (55%) were premenopausal and
206 (45%) were postmenopausal. All of the major racial groups were
represented with 85% White, 7% of Black, 3% Hispanic, 3% Asian, and 3%
of other ethnicity. The age range of the patients was 18–89 with a median age
of 49.
The statistics for enrolled subjects with pathology classification are
summarized in the following table.

The RCTUEA test used the following cut points to evaluate the performance
of the test in pre- and postmenopausal women presenting to a generalist with
an adnexal mass, for whom a decision to undergo surgery has been made. The
cut-offs are the same for serum, K2-EDTA plasma, K3-EDTA plasma, and Li-
Heparin plasma.
Premenopausal:
RCTUEA score ≥ 1.14: High likelihood of finding malignancy
RCTUEA score < 1.14: Low likelihood of finding malignancy

The information provided by the RCTUEA test should be used by physician
only as an adjunctive test to complement, not replace, other diagnostic and
clinical procedures. The ability of RCTUEA to contribute to the ICRA was
evaluated by comparing the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values
(PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) for standalone use of RCTUEA,
and adjunctive use of ICRA and RCTUEA. The performance of RCTUEA
evaluated for diagnosis of EOC including LMP are presented below.
Performance of RCTUEA for Diagnosis of EOC including LMP (436
patients):
Combined pre- and postmenopausal subjects:
For diagnosis of EOC including LMP, the counts for all pre- and

To examine whether the RCTUEA test provides additional information when
used in combination with ICRA, the ability of RCTUEA to contribute to the
ICRA was analyzed.
The following table presents the observed frequencies of malignancy
tabulated according to ICRA and RCTUEA test results from 436 patients.

The same information about the frequencies of malignancy is presented by the
likelihood ratios: Likelihood ratio (Result) = Pr(Result|Malignancy) /
Pr(Result|No Malignancy). Likelihood ratio is a way of quantifying how
much a given test result changes the pre-test probability of malignancy in a
patient.

(4.92).
The performance of adjunctive use of RCTUEA and ICRA for diagnosis of
EOC including LMP was further evaluated by calculating sensitivity,
specificity, PPV, and NPV and compared to standalone use of ICRA.

With adjunctive use of ICRA and RCTUEA for diagnosis of EOC including
LMP, sensitivity for malignancy increased from 76.9% to 90.8%. Specificity
for malignancy decreased from 84.4% to 70.4%. PPV for the adjunctive use
of ICRA and RCTUEA decreased from 46.3% to 34.9% due to an increase in
the number of false positive tests added by the addition of RCTUEA to ICRA.
However, NPV of the adjunctive use of ICRA and RCTUEA increased from
95.4% to 97.8%. The increase of NPV was 2.3% and was statistically
significant.

To examine whether the RCTUEA test provides additional information when
used in combination with ICRA, the ability of RCTUEA to contribute to the
ICRA was analyzed.
The following table presents the observed frequencies of malignancy
tabulated according to ICRA and RCTUEA test results from 455 patients.

The same information about the frequencies of malignancy is presented by the
likelihood ratios: Likelihood ratio (Result) = Pr(Result|Malignancy) /
Pr(Result|No Malignancy). Likelihood ratio is a way of quantifying how
much a given test result changes the pre-test probability of malignancy in a
patient.

To demonstrate whether a higher RCTUEA score is associated with an
increased likelihood of cancer, additional analysis was conducted by splitting
the patients at the cut-off point and finding the median RCTUEA score within
each split giving two balanced groups below the cutoff and additional groups
above. The results are summarized below.

4. Clinical cut-off:
The following cut-offs are used to interpret the result. The RCTUEA score is
between 0.0 and 10.0.
Premenopausal:
RCTUEA score ≥ 1.14: High likelihood of finding malignancy
RCTUEA score < 1.14: Low likelihood of finding malignancy
Postmenopausal:
RCTUEA score ≥ 2.99: High likelihood of finding malignancy
RCTUEA score < 2.99: Low likelihood of finding malignancy
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Expected values in Healthy Subjects:
In order to determine the normal and reference ranges of RCTUEA score in
healthy women, 120 premenopausal samples and 120 postmenopausal samples
(total = 240 samples) were tested. Samples covered age ranging from 18 to 87
and represented whites (96%), African American (2%), Hispanic (1%) and Asian
(1%) subjects. The results for RCTUEA score obtained from the pre- and post-
menopausal populations are presented below:

Overall, 95% of the premenopausal healthy female subjects had a RCTUEA score
equal to or below 1.70. Ninety-five percent of the postmenopausal healthy female
subjects had a RCTUEA score equal to or below 2.58. These values were chosen

based on the 95th percentile of the population tested. It is recommended that each
laboratory establish its own reference value for the population of interest.
Expected values in Non-Ovarian Malignancy Conditions:
To evaluate the performance of RCTUEA in subjects with other benign and other
malignant conditions, RCTUEA was evaluated in women with benign conditions
(benign gynecological disease, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension,
pregnant, and other benign disease) and in women with other malignant
conditions (bladder cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, gastrointestinal
cancer, and lung cancer). The tables below summarize the results analyzed for
premenopausal and postmenopausal samples.
