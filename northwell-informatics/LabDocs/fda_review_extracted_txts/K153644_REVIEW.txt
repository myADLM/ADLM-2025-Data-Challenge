L. Test Principle:
The reaction of glucose with ATP produces Glucose-6-phosphate which in presence of
NAD+ will produce D-Gluconate-6-phosphate + NADH + H+
The increase of absorbance is directly proportional to the glucose concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
ELITech Clinical Systems Selectra ProM Analyzers were used to conduct the
performance studies below.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the device was determined in accordance to CLSI EP05-A2 protocol.
Within-run and total precision results were obtained by performing two runs per day,
two measurements per run, for 4 levels of serum samples and 3 levels of urine
samples on two Selectra ProM analyzers during twenty operating days. The results
are presented in the table below:
Serum samples precision*:

1 80 45.5 1.1 2.0
2 80 119.5 0.9 1.7
3 80 251.5 0.9 2.0
4 80 522.5 0.4 1.8
*Level 1 is a natural human serum pool, level 2 and 4 are spiked human serum pool
and level 3 is a control sera (ELITROL II).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the assay for serum and urine matrix was evaluated respectively by
mixing a spiked patient serum and urine pool with high glucose and a diluted patient
serum and urine pool with low glucose (diluted with Albumin 6 g/dL / NaCl 0.9%) to
obtain 11 equidistant concentrations (10% increase each level). The glucose
concentration of each level was measured in triplicates using one lot of ELITech
Clinical Systems GLUCOSE HK SL reagent on one Selectra ProM analyzer. The
mean of the triplicates was used in the regression analysis. Results are summarized
below.
Serum:
High sample: 726.6 mg/dL; Low sample: 20.0 mg/dL
y = 1.025x - 1.9618, R2 = 0.9999
Claimed measuring range: 20-720 mg/dL
Urine:
High sample: 726.6 mg/dL; Low sample: 10.1 mg/dL
y=1.0155x - 1.596, R2=0.9998
Claimed measuring range: 10-720 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
ELITech Clinical Systems GLUCOSE HK SL method is traceable to NIST SRM
965b reference material.
Stability:
ELITROL I and II serum control material is purchased from a commercial vendor
(previously cleared under k041227). The following is claimed for stability: Before
reconstitution, the shelf-life of the ELITROL I and ELITROL II is 24 months at 2-
8°C. After reconstitution the stability is 12 hours when stored at 15-25°C, 5 days
when stored at 2-8°C or 4 weeks (when frozen once) at -25° and -15° C.
ELICAL 2 calibrator material is purchased from a commercial vendor (previously
cleared under k033501). The following is claimed for stability: Before reconstitution,
the shelf-life of ELICAL 2 is stable 24 months at 2-8°C. After reconstitution the
stability is 8 hours when stored at 15-25°C, 2 days at 2-8°C or 4 weeks (when frozen
once) at -25°and -15°C. The labeling states that the ELICAL 2 should be stored
tightly capped and protected from light when not in use.

--- Page 8 ---
Value Assignment:
Each lot of ELITROL I and II are value assigned using the median of the observed
values (at least 48 measurements in total: 2 analyzers x 2 reagent lots x 3 vials per test
lot x 4 measurements per vial). The lot release criteria is that the assigned value
should be within ±15% of the supplier’s value, and the CV should be ≤ 2.4% for
ELITROL I, and ≤ 1.8% for ELITROL II. The control ranges are lot specific, an
example of one lot of control ranges is provided below:
ELITROL I: mean = 95.1 mg/dL, control range = 80.8 to 109.4 mg/dL
ELITROL II: mean = 252.8 mg/dL, control range = 214.9 to 290.7 mg/dL
For each lot of ELICAL 2, the calibrator concentration on the supplier’s certificate of
analysis is verified by testing the released lot of ELITRO I, ELITROL II and
ELICAL 2 tested in triplicate on one instrument using two reagent lots. The release
criteria are that the mean analyte values of ELITRO I, ELITROL II and ELICAL 2
are within ±7.5% of the target value. The calibrator value is lot specific, an example
of one lot of calibrator is provided below:
ELICAL 2: Target value =196 mg/dL
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was
determined according to the CLSI EP-17A guideline on Selectra ProM Analyzers.
Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined using 60 measurements of blank sample
(Solution of Albumin 6 g/dL /NaCl 0.9%). Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined
using 15 measurements of 4 samples with a low concentration of glucose
(approximately 4 x LoB ≈ 0.4 mg/dL). For the determination of the Limit of
Quantification (LoQ), four (4) diluted sample pools are prepared from 4 different
patient sample pools of known concentrations (measured by the test method) in order
to obtain a concentration close to the expected LoQ target of 5 mg/dL. The sponsor
validated the LoQ claim of 5 mg/dL; the %CV of serum samples at the target LoQ of
5.0 mg/dL is <3.5%, and the %CV of urine samples at the target LoQ of 5.0 mg/dL is
<3%. Results are summarized in the table below.
Measurand LoB LoD LoQ
Glucose (Serum) 0.1 0.3 5.0
(mg/dL)
Glucose (Urine) 0.1 0.2 5.0
(mg/dL)
The claimed measuring range of the candidate device is 20 to 720 mg/dL for serum
sample, and is 10 to 720 mg/dL for urine sample.

e. Analytical specificity:
Various concentrations of potential interferents were spiked into two sample pools
with low and high glucose levels in serum and urine, respectively, to support the
specificity claim of each matrix. Testing was performed on Selectra ProM
Analyzers and the mean of triplicate measurements of each sample was used to
calculate the difference between the spiked and the control samples. The sponsor
states that interference is considered to be non-significant if the bias between the
tested and control samples are within ±10%. For each interferent, 6-9 levels were
tested and the highest concentration tested that shows non-significant interference
are summarized below:

Sponsor has the following conclusions based on their triglycerides interference and
included this information in the labeling:
“Triglycerides at a concentration of ~1300 mg/dL decreased glucose result in serum
at 50 mg/dL by 32% and at 120 mg/dL by 19%.”
Sponsor also has the following limitations in the labeling:
1. Do not use hemolyzed samples.
2. Do not use lipemic samples.
3. Urine collected over 24 hours in a dark bottle, adding 5mL of glacial acetic acid
before sample collection.
4. In addition, the sponsor also states the following in their labeling:
Other compounds may interfere. Users should refer to the following literature

Clinical Systems GLUCOSE HK SL reagent on a Selectra ProM analyzer. The results
for serum and urines samples are summarized below. A single test result using the
proposed candidate method, and the mean of triplicate measurements using the
comparative method, were used in the regression analysis. The altered samples used
for each matrix are no more than 10%. Results are summarized in the table below.

b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor performed a matrix comparison study by comparing 40 lithium heparin
samples ranging from 25.2 to 704.5 mg/dL and 40 sodium fluoride/ oxalate samples
ranging from 21.0 to 719.7 mg/dL to serum samples on the Selectra ProM analyzer.
Regression analysis of the results yielded the following:
Lithium heparin vs Serum: y=1.001x – 0.7 mg/dL, r= 1.000
Sodium fluoride/ oxalate vs Serum: y= 1.016x- 0.9 mg/dL, r= 0.999
The matrix comparison study results support the use of lithium heparin and sodium
fluoride/ oxalate samples in addition to serum samples for glucose measurement
using the ELITech Clinical Systems GLUCOSE HK SL assay.
