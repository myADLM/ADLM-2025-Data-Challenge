I. Device Description:
These devices are immunochromatographic assays for Amphetamine, Cocaine and Marijuana
Urine Tests use a lateral flow, one step system for the qualitative detection of d-
Amphetamine, Benzoylecgonine and 11-nor-Δ9-THC-9-COOH in human urine. Each assay
uses a monoclonal antibody-dye conjugate against drugs, with gold chloride and fixed drug-
protein conjugates, and anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody in membranes.
The assays in this submission include a cassette, dip card, and cup formats. Each assay and
format is available separately.

L. Test Principle:
SAFECARE Urine Tests are tests for the qualitative detection of Benzoylecgonine, or D-
amphetamine, or 11-nor-Δ9-THC-9 COOH in urine samples. Each assay test is a lateral flow
chromatographic immunoassay. During testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by
capillary action. If target drugs are present in the urine specimen below its cut-off
concentration, it will not saturate the binding sites of its specific antibody (monoclonal
mouse antibody) coated on the particles. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured
by immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the test line region.
The colored line will not form in the test line region if the target drug level exceeds its cutoff-
concentration because it will saturate all the binding sites of the antibody coated on the
particles. A band should form in the control region of the devices regardless of the presence
of drug or metabolite in the sample if sufficient volume of sample was applied.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of -100% cut-off, -
75% cut-off, -50% cut-off, -25% cut-off, at the cut-off, +25% cut-off, +50% cut-off,
+75% cut-off and +100% cut-off. These samples were prepared by spiking drug in
negative urine samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by GC/MS. All
sample aliquots were blinded labeled and randomized. For each concentration, tests
were performed two runs per day for 25 days.

Stability
Real-time and accelerated stability studies were conducted on three lots of each
device. The protocols for the stability studies were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The results of these studies indicated that all devices were found to be
stable at 4-30 (39-86oF) for 24 months based on the accelerated stability study at
50 . Control materials are not provided with the
device. The la℃be ling provides information on how to obtain control materials.

Transportation Study
A Transportation stability study was conducted on three lots of each device. The
protocols for the transportation stability study were reviewed and found to be

acceptable. The results of these studies indicated that all devices were found to be
stable during transport of the device in temperatures between -20 and 50
d. Detection limit: ℃.
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Compounds sharing structural or conformational similarity with the analytes were
tested for cross-reactivity with the candidate device. The structurally related
compounds that exhibited cross-reactivity with the candidate device were titrated to
determine the percent cross-reactivity. The concentration (ng/mL) of cross-reactant
that gives a response equivalent to the cutoff, and the percent cross-reactivity are
presented in the table below.

Effect of Urine Specific Gravity and Urine pH
To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine pH, urine samples with of
1.000 to 1.035 specific gravity or urine samples with pH 4 to 9 were spiked with
target drugs at 25% below and 25% above cut-off levels. These samples were tested
using three batches of each device for all formats. Results were all positive for
samples at and above +25% cut-off and all negative for samples at and below -25%
Cut-Off. There were no differences observed for different formats.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration is described in the precision section, M.1.a. above.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison studies for the SAVECARE Urine Test (Amphetamine, Cocaine
and Marijuana) were performed in-house with three different laboratory assistants for
each format of the device. Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered
clinical samples for each drug. The samples were blind labeled and compared to GC/MS
results.

Lay User Study
A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 420 lay persons
testing the amphetamine devices, 420 lay persons testing the cocaine devices and 420
lay persons testing the marijuana devices. A total of 208 females and 212 males tested
the amphetamine samples, 205 females and 215 males tested cocaine samples, and
212 females and 208 males tested the marijuana samples. They had diverse
educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 21 to > 50 years.
Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations; negative, +/-75%, +/-
50%, +/-25% of the cutoff by spiking drugs into drug free-pooled urine specimens.
The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample was
aliquoted into individual containers and blind-labeled. Each participant was provided
with the package insert, 1 blind labeled sample and a device.
Lay-users were also given surveys on the ease of understanding the package insert
instructions. All lay users indicated that the device instructions can be easily
followed. A Flesch-Kincaid reading analysis was performed on each package insert
and the scores revealed a reading Grade Level of 7.5.
