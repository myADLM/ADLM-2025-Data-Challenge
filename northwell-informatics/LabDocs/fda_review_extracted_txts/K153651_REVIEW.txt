L. Test Principle:
The Access TSH (3rd IS) assay is a two-site immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay. A
sample is added to a reaction vessel with mouse anti-hTSH-alkaline phosphatase conjugate,
buffered protein solution and paramagnetic particles coated with immobilized mouse
monoclonal anti-hTSH antibody. The hTSH binds to the immobilized monoclonal anti-hTSH
antibody on the solid phase while the mouse anti-hTSH-alkaline phosphatase conjugate
reacts with a different antigenic site on the hTSH. After incubation in a reaction vessel,
materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are
washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phos 530 is added to the vessel
and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is
directly proportional to the concentration of TSH in the sample. The amount of analyte in the
sample is determined from a stored, multi-point calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed following CLSI EP5-A3. Four serum samples with
approximate TSH concentrations of 0.02, 0.30, 5.0, and 39.0 μIU/mL were tested.
Each sample was assayed in duplicate, in two runs per day, over twenty days for a
total of 40 runs and 80 replicates. The study was run on one UniCel Dxl 800
Immunoassay System, using three reagent pack lots and one calibrator lot. The
within-run, between-day, between-run, and total imprecision was calculated for each
sample, for each instrument and lot combination. Results from multiple lots were
similar. Results from one representative lot are provided in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed following CLSI EP6-A, one high serum sample
(spiked with human TSH to approximately 50.0 μIU/mL) and one low serum sample
(< 0.01 μIU/mL) were mixed to make nine sample concentrations evenly distributed
across the analytical measuring range. Four replicates of the seven mixed samples,

eight replicates of the low sample, and four replicates of the high sample were tested
on one UniCel Dxl 800 Immunoassay System using three reagent pack lots and one
calibrator lot. Linearity study data were analyzed by weighted linear regression and
the observed values (mean of the replicates) were compared to the best fitted straight
line (predicted values). The linearity regression results are shown below. Results from
other lots were similar.
y = 1.007x – 3.24x10-6
The Access TSH (3rd IS) assay claimed measuring range is from 0.01 to 50.0
µIU/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The measurand (TSH) in the Access TSH (3rd IS) Calibrator is traceable to WHO 3rd
International Reference Preparation, (NIBSC Coded 81/565). The traceability
process is based on EN ISO17511.
Stability:
Stability protocols and acceptance criteria for real-time, opened and closed
calibrators were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
The calibrator shelf life is 180 days when stored unopened at 2-10°C and the
calibrator open vial stability claims is 90 days when stored at 2-10°C.
Value Assignment:
Concentrations of calibrators are assigned through an internal procedure. Primary
working calibrators are prepared from WHO 81/565 and secondary working
calibrators are value assigned using the primary working calibrators and the Access
Immunoassay System. Primary working calibrators and the secondary working
calibrators are run together on the Access Immunoassay System in a matched,
multi-replicate process. Product (commercial) calibrators are value assigned using
the secondary working calibrators on the Access Immunoassay System following a
similar value assignment process. The Access TSH (3rd IS) Calibrators are lot
specific and provided at six levels; zero and approximately 0.05, 0.30, 3.0, 15.0,
and 50.0 μIU/mL (mIU/L).

d. Detection limit:
LoB, LoD, and LoQ below were determined according to CLSI EP17-A2.
i. Limit of Blank (LoB)
The LoB study was run on two UniCel Dxl 800 Immunoassay Systems, using
three reagent pack lots and one calibrator lot. One hundred twenty (120) total
replicates for each reagent pack lot were tested. Of the total replicates, ninety (90)
were comprised of zero level calibrators (30 replicates of each of three lots) and
thirty (30) were comprised of Access Wash Buffer II that were measured for the LoB
determination. The LoB was determined to be 0.0004 μIU/mL using the 95% non-
parametric upper reference limit of the 120 replicates.
ii. Limit of Detection (LoD)
The LoD study was run using five serum samples with low TSH concentrations on
two UniCel Dxl 800 Immunoassay Systems, using three reagent pack lots and one
calibrator lot. In total, forty-five (45) replicates (nine replicates per day over five
days) of each of the five low serum samples (225 replicates per pack lot for a total of
675 replicates) were measured for the LoD determination. The LoD was determined
to be 0.001 μIU/mL based on the precision model, multiplied by the 95th percentile of
the standard normal distribution and added to the LoB to calculate the LoD.
iii. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
The LoQ study was run using eight serum samples with TSH concentrations between
LoB and 0.05 μIU/mL. Seven of these samples were used to determine LoQ as the
results for the sample at LoB were excluded. Samples were tested on one UniCel Dxl
800 Immunoassay System, using three reagent pack lots and one calibrator lot. Each
of the seven samples were run in replicates of nine, in one run per day, for five days
on three reagent pack lots (45 replicates of each sample on each reagent lot). In total,
one hundred thirty-five (135) replicates of each of the seven serum samples (945 total
replicates) were measured for the LoQ determination. The mean concentration and
between-run percent coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated for each sample on
each day. The concentration that demonstrated 10% between-run CV is the LoQ.
Based on this study the LoQ for Access TSH (3rd IS) assay is 0.001μIU/mL.
Analyte LoB LoD LoQ
Access TSH (3rd IS) 0.0004 μIU/mL 0.001 μIU/mL 0.001 μIU/mL

e. Analytical specificity:
i. Interference:
Following CLSI EP7-A2 Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry-Approved
Guideline an interference study was performed assessing common sample
abnormalities (including hemolysis, icterus, and lipemia), common prescription
drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and medications most often prescribed in the
patient population for which the test is ordered. Two serum samples containing
hTSH concentrations of approximately 0.30 μIU/mL and 5.0 μIU/mL were spiked
with multiple concentrations of the substances below and run on one UniCel Dxl
800 Immunoassay System using three reagent pack lots and one calibrator lot.
Five replicates were tested for the control sample and each of the two spiked
sample preparations. Interference was determined by testing controls (no
interfering substance added) and matched test samples (with interfering substance
added). The sponsor defines significant interference as a bias in results of
> 10% as compared to the control sample. Of the compounds tested, none were
found to cause significant interference using the highest test concentrations
indicated in the table below;

ii. Cross-reactivity:
A cross-reactivity study was performed to evaluate the potential cross-reactivity
of the assay with other substances that are similar in structure to hTSH. Serum
samples containing hTSH concentrations of approximately 0.30 μIU/mL and 5.0
μIU/mL were spiked with multiple concentrations of the substances below and
run on one UniCel Dxl 800 Immunoassay System using three reagent pack lots
and one calibrator lot. Five replicates were tested for the control sample and each
of the two spiked sample preparations. Results from these spiked samples were
evaluated against that of a sample that had been spiked with Tris and/or
Phosphate Buffered Saline, defined as the control. The mean dose of the replicates
was calculated for the control samples and the spiked sample preparations. The
difference was calculated as a percent difference in dose from the expected
control dose. The sponsor claims that samples containing substances at the
concentrations listed below do not affect the concentration of hTSH reported:
Highest Concentration Cross-reactivity (%)
Substance Added (mIU/mL)
hCG 1,000,000 < 0.010%
hFSH 1,000 < 0.10%
hLH 3,000 < 0.10%
iii. High Dose Hook Effect:
To determine any hook effect, a known concentration of a WHO reference
standard (WHO 81/565) was spiked into synthetic calibrator matrix, and
dilutions were prepared from the initial spiked sample to determine the
presence of any hook effect. The study was run on one UniCel Dxl 800
Immunoassay System, using three reagent pack lots and one calibrator lot. Five
replicates were tested for each sample preparation. The hook effect is defined as
the concentration above the highest (S5) calibrator at which sample RLUs drop
below the RLUs of the highest (S5) calibrator. No high dose hook effect was
observed at concentrations up to 1000 µIU/mL.

iv. HAMA / Heterophile:
Verification studies were performed on characterized human anti- mouse
antibody (HAMA) / heterophile samples to evaluate blocker effectiveness in
the Access TSH (3rd IS) assay. The Access TSH (3rd IS) reagent pack has been
formulated to minimize the effects of HAMA / heterophile interference. While
the sponsor states that Access TSH (3rd IS) reagent pack has been formulated
to minimize the effects of interference, the study showed interference in some
cases. The following cautionary note has been included in the “Limitations of
the Procedure” section of the product insert:
“For assays employing antibodies, the possibility exists for interference by
heterophile antibodies in the patient sample. Patients who have been regularly
exposed to animals or have received immunotherapy or diagnostic procedures
utilizing immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments may produce
antibodies, e.g., HAMA, that interfere with immunoassays.”
f. Assay cut-off:
See detection limit above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed comparing the Access TSH (3rd IS)
assay to the Access HYPERsensitive hTSH Assay, using a protocol based on CLSI
EP09-A3, Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient
Samples; Approved Guideline – Third Edition. A total of one hundred fifty-five
(155) frozen serum samples were run in singleton. The study was run at two external
sites on UniCel DxI 800 Immunoassay Systems, using three reagent pack lots and one
calibrator lot for the TSH (3rd IS) assay. The Passing-Bablok regression analysis
results between Access TSH (3rd IS) values (dependent variable, y) and Access

b. Matrix comparison:
The sample types for the matrix comparison study were serum (no gel), serum (gel)
and lithium- heparin plasma. 79 matched sets of serum and plasma (lithium-heparin)
samples were used. Nine (9) altered samples were prepared by spiking known
concentrations of human TSH into all three sample types, which had been previously
stripped to remove all TSH. These altered samples were prepared to TSH
concentrations at a range of approximately 0.01 μIU/mL to 0.2 μIU/mL. The sample
concentrations tested were 0.01 to 43.55 mIU/mL for lithium plasma, 0.01 to 39.04
mIU/mL for serum (gel) and 0.01 to 38.85 mIU/mL for serum (no gel). Spiked
samples were prepared using human TSH spiked into all three sample types, which
had been previously stripped to remove all TSH. The study was run on one
instrument using one reagent pack lot and one calibrator lot. One replicate per sample
type was analyzed. Linear regression results are shown below:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The populations used in this study included a general population of approximately equal
numbers of males and non-pregnant females between the ages of 21-88, and pregnant
female populations, with approximately equal distribution across all three trimesters.
Approximately four hundred (367) subjects were enrolled in each population.
After enrollment, the subjects’ serum samples were screened for positive thyroid
peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) using the Beckman
Coulter TPO Antibody and Thyroglobulin Antibody II assays prior to reference interval
analyses. Samples with positive TPOAb or TgAb results (approximately 10%) were
excluded from analysis of the TSH reference intervals. The remaining serum samples
were analyzed according to their population. All samples were run in singleton. The
study was run at two external sites on UniCel Dxl 800 Immunoassay Systems, using one
reagent pack lot and one calibrator lot for the TSH (3rd IS) assay.
The data was analyzed separately for each population using the non-parametric method
and following CLSI C28-A3. Additionally, a two-sided non-parametric 95% confidence
interval (CI) was used for the analysis. The study was run to establish the central 97.5%
reference interval of healthy, normal euthyroid adult and pregnant female populations, as
indicated.
