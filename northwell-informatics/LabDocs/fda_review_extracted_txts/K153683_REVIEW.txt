L. Test Principle:
Trak uses the principle of density gradient separation to isolate sperm cells from human
semen to provide an estimation of sperm concentration. The Trak Engine spins a test Prop to
compact sperm cells within an introduced semen sample into a visible column (or “pellet”).
The Prop gives a defined shape to the column, the height of which corresponds to the
concentration of sperm cells in the sample. Since semen may also contain cell debris,
immature sperm cells, and other contaminant particulates that could contribute to the
apparent size of a pellet, it is necessary to filter out the contaminants. Trak achieves this
filtering by removing contaminants from view based on density across a predefined liquid
density medium.
During operation, approximately 0.17 mL of semen is metered by centrifugal action from the
sample inlet into the metering chamber of the Prop. During rotation, the semen floats on
“top” of the pre-loaded density medium. Sperm cells pass through the medium due to their
high density while contaminants remain floating on the medium. When the spin sequence is
complete, the sperm cells form a visible column that is displayed to the user for
interpretation. Contaminants that are less dense than the liquid density medium are
suspended “above” the medium, substantially separated from the sperm cells and are
generally too diffuse to visualize.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A one day precision study was carried out by three operators using three Engine/Prop
lot combinations, two replicates per run, and two runs at each time point, for a total of
60 replicates per sperm concentration. Measurements were separated into five
separate 4-hour time periods. Seven sperm concentrations were selected that
challenged the 15 M/mL and 55 M/mL cut-offs. Sperm concentrations of
approximately 13 M/mL, 15 M/mL, 17 M/mL, 18 M/mL, 46 M/mL, 57 M/mL, and
62 M/mL as evaluated by a Computer Aided Semen Analysis (CASA) system were
tested by Trak. No significant difference in the performance was found within-run,
between-runs, and between-operators/lots. A decrease in results over time period was
noted for all of the lower level concentrations reflected by an elevated between-period
component of variance. Trak results for a given sample decrease over time due to
degradation of the semen sample, especially for lower concentration samples. The
instructions for use (Owners Guide) indicate that the test is to be run within 2 hours
following sample collection to ensure valid results. The following includes grand
averages for each condition, sum for each category, and percent correct calls:

7 61.9 ± 3.8 0 0 60 100
Quality Control Precision
A precision study was conducted to establish the precision of the Trak QC material.
Two lots each of two formulations of QC material intended to give Trak results of
approximately 17.5 M/mL (Control Solution A) and 7.5 M/mL (Control Solution B)
were each tested in duplicate in two separate runs per day over 20 non-consecutive
days. Both formulations of the Trak QC material meet acceptance criteria, with 100%
of results falling within the expected category.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Track Prop Shelf Life
Real time stability testing was performed on three lots of Trak Props. At each time
point, 20 Props from each lot were tested with concentrations of approximately
10 M/mL and 20 M/mL and visually evaluated against the 15 M/mL threshold. At
each time point, one Prop from each lot was tested on cell-free seminal plasma as a
control. All samples were freshly prepared from pooled and diluted semen samples at
each time point. In order to validate the freshly composed samples, five replicates
from each of the 10 M/mL and 20 M/mL samples were tested on Props assembled
within 30 days of the tested time point. Results from Trak Props meet acceptance
criteria out to a 6 month time point, and a 3 month expiry date is supported by current
stability data. Real time stability testing is ongoing. Stability data is being maintained
to extend the expiry date of the Trak Props.
Quality Control Shelf Life
Real time stability testing was performed on three lots of the “Level A” QC material.
At the end of each predetermined time point, 10 replicates of the control were tested

on Trak Props and visually evaluated against the 15 M/mL threshold. After initial
stability testing at specific time points, previously opened vials of the QC material
will be re-capped and re-tested 3 months later to establish 3 month open vial stability.
Results from the Trak QC material meet acceptance criteria out to a 2 month time
point. Real time stability testing is ongoing. Stability data is being maintained to
extend the expiry date of the QC material and establish stability of opened bottles.
d. Detection limit:
Two lots of Props, each containing a unique lot of the density medium were tested in
three “days”. Because sperm cells are not stable over time, separate time periods
during a 24 hour day were used to represent the three days. Four low level sperm
concentrations were obtained by dilution of pooled semen samples, and were
confirmed by CASA. Each combination of “day” and sperm concentration was tested
in five replicates to obtain 60 total replicates per Prop/reagent lot. The data
demonstrated that low concentration samples were consistently assigned correctly
into the ≤15 M/mL category, thereby meeting the specified acceptance criteria.
e. Analytical specificity:
The potential interference of various substances on Trak results was evaluated by testing
elevated concentrations of saliva, urine, blood, leukocytes, E. coli, C. albicans, C.
trachomatis, N. perflava, testosterone, D-norgestrel, and β-estradiol as interfering
substances in the Trak test. Each concentration of interfering substance was spiked
into semen containing approximately 10 M/mL sperm or 20 M/mL sperm, and tested
alongside control semen where there were no added interfering substances. Each of
these conditions was tested in 20 replicates on the Trak device and evaluated against
the 15 M/mL threshold.
Each interfering substance was also spiked into semen samples of approximately
45 M/mL sperm or 65 M/mL sperm and tested alongside control semen in the absence
of the interfering substances. Each of these conditions was tested in 10 replicates on
the Trak device and evaluated against the 55 M/mL reference feature.
Of the tested interfering substances, only 3 M/mL leukocytes and 1% whole blood
failed acceptance criteria for any tested concentration.
f. Assay cut-off:
Near Cut-off Validation
A study was conducted to demonstrate that Trak generates accurate results when
samples near the cut-off values, 15 M/mL and 55 M/mL, are tested. Fresh semen
samples were pooled and diluted to seven concentrations that challenged the
15 M/mL cut-off. The approximate concentrations formulated were 10 M/mL sperm,
11.5 M/mL sperm, 13 M/mL sperm, 15 M/mL sperm (at or near threshold), 17 M/mL
6

--- Page 7 ---
sperm, 18.5 M/mL sperm, and 20 M/mL sperm. Similarly, semen samples were
pooled and diluted to seven concentrations that challenge the 55 M/mL cut-off. The
approximate concentrations formulated were 45 M/mL sperm, 47 M/mL sperm, 50
M/mL sperm, 55 M/mL sperm (at or near threshold), 60 M/mL sperm, 63 M/mL
sperm, and 65 M/mL sperm. The concentration of each pooled sample was verified to
within 5% of target values by CASA and tested in 20 replicates on the Trak System.
The table below shows a summary of the validation study, including sum for each
category and percent correct calls.
CASA Result # Trak # Trak >15 M/mL

The data support that Trak results are adequately close to reference values in the
vicinity of both cut-offs.
Consumer Interpretation Study
A study was performed to demonstrate that Trak results are interpreted correctly by lay
users. Lay users at two sites were presented with instructions for use, a Trak Male
Fertility System, and a document packet containing an instructional comprehension quiz
and images of Trak results for evaluation. Images of seven Trak Props representing
results at 8 M/mL, 13 M/mL, 20 M/mL, 47 M/mL, 63 M/mL, 70 M/mL, and 85 M/mL
were presented in a different randomized order to each subject. Users categorized each
result according to their interpretation: ≤15 M/mL, 15–55 M/mL, or > 55 M/mL. Sixty-
one subjects (28 male, 33 female) performing a total of 425 Prop interpretations were
included in this study. Two interpretation forms were not correctly filled out and were
excluded from the study. The subjects assigned the correct category in 414 instances.

Consumer Use Study:
A consumer use study was conducted to determine test performance when used by
unassisted lay users following the instructions in the package insert. The study was
conducted at three clinical sites in the United States. The study was conducted in two
ways: 1) Performance of male subjects providing and testing their own semen
specimen; 2) Performance of “tester” lay-persons recruited to test semen specimens
provided by a subset of test subjects. Male subjects (n=239) providing and testing
semen specimens were either presumptively healthy (by self-report), a partner in a
couple having difficulty conceiving, diagnosed with male factor infertility, post-
vasectomy patients, or post-vasectomy reversal patients.

Following collection of the specimen sample by the study subject, either the study
subject or the tester analyzed the sample by Trak. After recording the results, a
health-care professional (HCP) employed at the study site observed the Prop and
recorded his/her own interpretation of the subject/tester results, and then performed
his/her own Trak test using a saved aliquot of the original semen specimen provided
by the subject. The HCP then recorded the result of the test. Trak results generated by
subjects and testers agreed with results from the same specimens tested by HCPs on
the Trak, indicating the quality of the instructions for use.
In parallel to Trak testing, an HCP technician employed at the site analyzed an
additional aliquot of the original semen specimen on a Computer Aided Semen
Analysis (CASA) system (Hamilton-Thorne CEROS™ Computer Aided Semen
Analysis system) and recorded the results in M/mL. Study subjects, testers, and
reference method operators were blinded to the test results from the other testers
during the clinic visit.
Following the clinical study, lay readers were presented with each of the Props run by
lay users at the clinical sites, and asked to interpret each result into one of three
categories: ≤ 15 M/mL, 15–55 M/mL, or > 55 M/mL according to the product
instructions. The lay interpretations were compared to the categorized reference
CASA results from each clinical site. A summary of this analysis is provided below:

--- Page 11 ---
6. Quality Control:
The QC material is based on a suspension of polymer beads with a density range that
overlaps with sperm cells. When tested on Trak, the QC material produces results that
resemble the result produced with a semen sample. There are two control levels. Control
A produces a Trak result in the MODERATE range close to the 15 M/mL cut-off (at
approximately 17.5 M/mL). Control B produces a Trak result in the LOW range (at
approximately 7.5 M/mL). Control A will be provided as part of the Trak system, while
Control B will be available through customer service.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Cleaning Robustness
A study was conducted to assess whether the Trak Engine performs adequately after
repeated cycles of cleaning and disinfection as would occur during end-use. Trak Props
were tested in 10 replicates at each of the four different sperm concentrations intended to
challenge the 15 M/mL threshold and 55 M/mL feature: approximately 10 M/mL, 20
M/mL, 45 M/mL and 65 M/mL. One set of Props was tested before cleaning and
disinfection, and one set of Props was tested after 50 cycles of cleaning with soap and
water and disinfection with Super Sani-Wipes, according to the proposed user instruction.
Engine spin rates were checked against specifications before and after cleaning and
disinfection. The data support the robustness of the Trak Engine to the intended cleaning
and disinfection protocol.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
