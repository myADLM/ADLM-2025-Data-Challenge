The Synermed Glucose Reagent is for the in vitro quantitative measurement of glucose in
serum on the Synermed IR-1200. Glucose measurements are used in the diagnosis and
treatment of carbohydrate metabolism disorders including diabetes mellitus, neonatal
hypoglycemia, and of pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.
The Synermed IR-1200 analyzer is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as a
multiparameter chemistry instrument that quantitates the levels of constituents in serum.
The analyzer is an automated, random access, computer controlled, clinical chemistry
analyzer for clinical chemistry tests. The instrument provides in vitro quantitative
measurements for glucose in serum. The device is intended for use only in clinical
laboratories.
2. Indication(s) for use:
See intended use above.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Synermed IR-1200 Chemistry Analyzer
I. Device Description:
Clinical laboratories can use the Synermed IR-1200 chemistry analyzer for in vitro diagnostic
testing. The analyzer consists of a carousel system for reagents and samples, an internal
cooling unit, a sampling/dispensing arm assembly, an incubation assembly, and a wash
station. The analyzer is controlled by software using a Windows operating system and
dedicated applications software. The Synermed IR-1200 analyzer includes a heater to provide
37 degree reaction temperatures. The IR-1200 also keeps reagents cold during storage using a
semiconductor. The IR-1200 chemistry analyzer measures 51in × 34in × 44 in (L×W×H) and
weighs 750 lbs.
The Infrared Laboratory Systems’ Synermed IR-1200 Chemistry Analyzer uses the
previously-cleared Synermed Glucose Reagent kit for spectrophotometric analysis of glucose
in serum. The analyzer automatically combines the sample with the reagent(s), mixes,
incubates the mixture, measures the absorbance of the chromophore, and calculates the
concentration of the analyte. After analysis, the cuvettes are automatically washed and dried
prior to the next use.
The Synermed Glucose reagent include liquid ready to use reagents, R1 and R2. The reagent
composition consists of the glucose chromogen, 280 umol/L N-sulfopropyl-N-ethyl-3,5-
dimethylaniline, and the glucose reagent, 280 umol/L ampyrose, 1400 U/L peroxidase

L. Test Principle:
The glucose measurement is based on the enzymatic reaction of glucose with glucose
oxidase. Glucose oxidase catalyzes the conversion of glucose to gluconolactone, which then
forms gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide reacts with N-
sulfopropyl-N-ethyl-3, 5-dimethylaniline and ampyrone in the presence of peroxidase to
form a blue azo dye, which is quantitated at 650-660 nm.

A precision study was conducted on the Synermed IR-1200 by measuring five levels
of human serum pools for glucose (45, 120, 180, 375, and 625 mg/dL). Each sample
was run in duplicate twice a day for twenty days for a total of 80 measurements for
each analyte. The mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation were
determined for glucose at all control levels. Precision results are summarized in the
table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies for glucose were performed on the Synermed IR-1200 chemistry
analyzer using eleven different levels of glucose and four replicates at each level. The
measurement for the four replicates were averaged and plotted against the expected
value. The samples were prepared by mixing high and low pools of human serum.
The tested values in the linearity study for glucose were (in mg/dL) 6.5, 24, 33, 45,
120, 180, 275, 375, 476, 576, 672, 780, and 900. Results from the linear regression
are summarized in the table below.

d. Detection limit:
The Synermed Glucose measurement procedure was evaluated for detection limits
according to CLSI document EP17-A2. The Limit of Blank (LoB) study was
performed using blank pools prepared from 5 human serum samples treated with
glucose oxidase. Two different pools were measured 30 times over two days on the
IR-122 Chemistry Analyzer using two lots of reagent, resulting in 120 samples. LoB
was determined to be 2.8 mg/dL.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) study was performed using a pool of serum samples
with an expected concentration of 4.5 mg/dL. The pool of serum samples were
measured 30 times in over two days on the IR-122 Chemistry Analyzer using one two
lots of reagent, resulting in 120 samples in two separate studies (n=60 in each study).
LoD was determined to be 3.65 mg/dL.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) study was performed using a pool of 5 human serum
samples containing a low concentration of glucose greater than the LoD but not
greater than 4x the LoB. The serum pool was measured 30 times in over two days on
the IR-122 Chemistry Analyzer using one two lots of reagent, resulting in 120
samples in two separate studies (n=60 in each study). The LoQ was determined to be
6.5 mg/dL.
The claimed measuring range of the glucose assay is 8 to 885 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The Synermed Glucose measurement procedure was evaluated for interference
according to CLSI document EP07-A2. Effects of common endogenous substances
including conjugated bilirubin (0.76 and 20 mg/dL), unconjugated bilirubin (0.76 and
20mg/dL), hemoglobin (100 and 500 mg/dL), triglycerides (176.99 and
3274.34mg/dL) and uric acid (11.77 and 23.54mg/dL) were evaluated at two different
glucose concentrations (80 mg/dL and 120 mg/dL) for interference. Furthermore, the
following exogenous substances: ascorbic acid (1.22 and 6.02mg/dL), acetaminophen
(20.11 and 200.18μg/mL), genatmicin (7.51 and 10.05μg/mL), ibuprofen (40.08 and
500.21μg/mL), L-dopa (0.41 and 1.24μg/ml/L), methyldopa (4.24 and 14.99μg/mL),
N-acetylcysteine (0.08 and 0.25mg/dL), ofloxacin (8.78 and 17.5mg/L), salicyluric
acid 0.2 and 0.6μg/mL), tetracycline (3.78 and 16.27μg.mL) were evaluated at two
different glucose concentrations (80 mg/dL and 120 mg/dL) for interference. The
sponsor defined non-significant interference when the bias between the tested and
control samples are within ±9.99%.
No interference was seen when testing conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin,
hemoglobin, triglycerides, acetaminophen, gentamicin, ibuprofen, L-dopa, N-
acetylcisteine, and tetracycline at either level of interferent concentration.
