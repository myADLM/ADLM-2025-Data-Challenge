2. Indication(s) for use:
The Immunalysis Methamphetamine Urine Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous
enzyme immunoassay with dual cutoffs of 500ng/mL and 1000ng/mL. The assay is
intended for use in laboratories for the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of
Methamphetamine in human urine with automated clinical chemistry analyzers. This
assay is calibrated against Methamphetamine. This in-vitro diagnostic device is for
prescription use only.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as
Gas Chromatography/ Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or permitting laboratories to
establish quality control procedures.
The Immunalysis Methamphetamine Urine Enzyme Immunoassay Kit provides only a
preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be
used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC-MS or Liquid Chromatography /
Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration
and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly
when preliminary positive results are used.
The Immunalysis Multi-Drug Calibrators are intended for in vitro diagnostic use for the
calibration of assays for the analytes currently listed in the package insert:
Benzoylecgonine, Methamphetamine, Morphine, PCP and Oxazepam. The calibrators are
designed for prescription use with immunoassays.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
For in vitro diagnostic use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The Beckman Coulter AU400e Chemistry Analyzer was used to generate the
performance data in this submission. Instruments must be capable of maintaining a
constant reaction temperature, pipetting samples and reagents, mixing reagents, timing
reactions and measuring enzyme rates precisely.
I. Device Description:
The assay consists of antibody/ substrate reagent and enzyme conjugate reagent.
The antibody/ substrate reagent includes monoclonal antibodies to
Methamphetamine, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD) in Tris buffer with Sodium Azide as a preservative. The
enzyme conjugate reagent includes Methamphetamine derivative labeled with
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in Tris buffer with Sodium Azide
2

as a preservative.
All of the Immunalysis Multi-Drug Calibrators are liquid and ready to use. Each
contains a known concentration of a specific drug analyte as a mixture.
The negative calibrator is a processed, drug-free synthetic urine matrix with
sodium azide as a preservative. The Level 1, 2, 3 and 4 calibrators are prepared by
spiking known concentrations of drug analyte into the negative calibrator matrix.
These five calibrators (negative, Level 1, 2, 3 and 4) are sold as individual bottles.
The concentration of drug analyte in the corresponding calibrators is summarized
as follows:

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI EP07-A2: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry: Approved Guideline - Second
Edition
L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on the competition of Methamphetamine labeled enzyme glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and the free drug in the urine sample for a fixed amount
of antibody binding sites. In the absence of the free drug in the sample, the antibody binds
the drug enzyme conjugate and enzyme activity is inhibited. This creates a dose response
relationship between drug concentration in the urine sample and enzyme activity. The
enzyme G6PDH activity is determined at 340 nm spectrophotometrically by the conversion
of NAD to NADH.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed precision studies in-house following the guidelines provided
in CLSI EP5-A2. The study was performed using drug free urine samples spiked with
methamphetamine and analyzed on a Beckman Coulter / Olympus AU400e
Chemistry Analyzer. Samples were measured in duplicate in two runs per day for 20
days (n = 80). The data are summarized in the following tables:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A drug free urine pool was spiked with a high concentration of Methamphetamine (at
a level above the highest calibrator) and was used as the high value specimen.
Additional pools were made by serially diluting the high value specimen with drug
free urine in increments of about 10%. Aliquots from each pool were analyzed in
triplicate in the semi-quantitative mode.. For each known concentration, drug
recovery was calculated using the mean concentration of the replicates. The results of
the study are summarized below:
Expected Mean
Concentration Concentration Recovery (%)
(ng/mL) (ng/mL)
200 272.7 136.4
400 436.8 109.2
600 674.6 112.4
800 830.0 103.8

1600 1711.5 107.0
1800 1917.4 106.5
2000 2080.7 104.0
2200 2226.4 101.2
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The analytes in the calibrators have been traced to a commercially available standard
solution. The standard is certified material with the concentration verified by GC-MS
or LC/MS-MS. This standard is diluted with calibrator buffer to make the calibrators
in the desired concentrations. The concentrations are confirmed by Gas
Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry Analysis (GC-MS) and/or Liquid
Chromatography/ Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS-MS).
Stability protocols and acceptance criteria for the calibrators were reviewed and
found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims that when stored at 2 – 8o C calibrators
and controls are stable for one year. The sponsor claims that once opened, the
calibrators and controls are stable for 60 days when stored at 2 – 8o C.
The Negative Calibrator is a processed, drug free urine matrix. The standard is
compared to a reference negative standard to ensure that it is free of analyte. Value is
assigned when the test is within the acceptable range.

Values are assigned to the controls and calibrators once the GC/MS or LC/MS/MS
results are within the acceptable ranges. The negative standard is prepared with BSA
Buffer. The standard is compared to a reference negative standard to ensure that it is
free of analyte. The value is assigned when the test is within the acceptable range.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Potential interference from non-structurally related compounds and endogenous
compounds was evaluated in both the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes by
following CLSI EP 7-A2: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry. Potential
interferents were spiked into drug free urine containing Methamphetamine at ± 25%
of the cutoff (375 ng/mL and 625 ng/mL for the 500 ng/mL cutoff or 750 ng/mL and
1,250 ng/mL for the 1,000 ng/mL cutoff). The following compounds at 100,000

Methamphetamine at ± 25% of the cutoff (375 ng/mL and 625 ng/mL for the 500
ng/mL cutoff and 750 ng/mL and 1250 ng/mL for the 1000 ng/mL cutoff) were pH

Effect of specific gravity: The sponsor evaluated the effect of specific gravity on the
test results using both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. Drug free urine
containing Methamphetamine at ± 25% of the cutoff (375 ng/mL and 625 ng/mL for
the 500 ng/mL cutoff and 750 ng/mL and 1250 ng/mL for the 1000 ng/mL cutoff)
were adjusted using salt or albumin. Specific Gravity values of 1.000, 1.002, 1.005,
1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025 and 1.030 did not interfere with the test result at either
cutoff in qualitative or semi-quantitative mode.
Cross reactivity from structurally related compounds was evaluated in the qualitative
and semi-quantitative modes by spiking into drug-free urine. Each potential cross-
reacting compound was spiked and evaluated independently, and each spiked sample

f. Assay cut-off:
Analytical performance of the device around the claimed cutoff is described in the
precision section M.1.a. above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison study was performed in-house using unaltered, clinical urine
samples obtained from clinical testing laboratories. A total of 80 samples were
analyzed using both the 500 ng/mL and 1000 ng/mL cutoffs. Each sample was run in
singlicate on a Beckman Coulter AU400e Chemistry Analyzer and the result was
compared to that obtained by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS).
The results of the assay performance compared to LC/MS are summarized below:
