I. Device Description:
Assay
The ARCHITECT Syphilis TP assay is a two-step immunoassay for the qualitative detection
of antibodies (IgG and IgM) directed against TP in human serum or plasma based on CMIA
technology for use with the ARCHITECT iSystem.
The ARCHITECT iSystem is a fully-automated immunoassay system that allows random
and continuous access as well as priority and automated retest processing. The following
describes the processes that take place during the reaction:
1. Sample, assay diluent, and recombinant TP antigen (TpN15, TpN17 and TpN47) coated
microparticles are combined. Anti-TP antibodies present in the sample bind to the TP
coated microparticles.
2. After washing, anti-human IgG and IgM acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to create
a reaction mixture.
3. Following another wash cycle, Pre-Trigger and Trigger Solutions are added to the
reaction mixture.
4. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs).
There is a direct relationship between the amount of anti-TP antibodies in the sample and
the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT iSystem optics.
The presence or absence of anti-TP antibodies in the specimen is determined by comparing
the chemiluminescent signal in the reaction to the cutoff signal (S/CO) determined from an
active calibration. If the chemiluminescent signal in the reaction is greater than or equal to
the cutoff signal, the specimen is considered reactive for anti-TP antibodies. If the
chemiluminescent signal is below the cutoff signal, the specimen is considered nonreactive
for the anti-TP antibodies.
The results are printed out as follows:
S/CO ≥ 1.00 Reactive
S/CO < 1.00 Nonreactive
3

--- Page 4 ---
Interpretation of results:
Reactive Reactive for treponemal antibodies
Nonreactive Nonreactive for treponemal antibodies
Test results are intended to aid in diagnosis only. As with all serological tests for
syphilis, results should always be interpreted in conjunction with additional
treponemal or nontreponemal serologic test results (as appropriate), the patient’s
clinical symptoms, medical history, and other clinical and/or laboratory findings to
produce a diagnosis of syphilis by disease stage.
The ARCHITECT Syphilis TP Assay Reagents are for use with the ARCHITECT Syphilis
TP Calibrator and Controls.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Internal Precision
The precision of the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP assay was evaluated in an internal study
using three reagent lots and two calibrator lots. The test panel consisted of four samples
contrived in recalcified human plasma matrix at the following target antibody
concentrations:
Sample Target S/CO
High Non-reactive 0.55
Low Reactive 1.25
High Reactive 3.55
Non-reactive 0.08
Positive and negative controls, with target S/CO values of 2.71 and ≤ 0.40, respectively,
were included in each run.
The samples were tested in two replicates, twice a day, over 22 testing days, using two
ARCHITECT i2000 instruments.
SR
The mean S/CO value, within-run Standard Deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of
variation (%CV), between-run SD and %CV, and between-day SD and %CV were
calculated for each sample stratified by instrument and reagent lot. The estimates of total
imprecision were calculated by summation of the variance components.
The results from the precision study across reagent lots, by instrument are shown below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable; this is a qualitative assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrator
The ARCHITECT Syphilis TP Calibrator is sold as an accessory to the test. The
calibrator is referenced to an Abbott internal reference standard. This internal reference
standard is manufactured by dilution of high titer positive plasma with nonreactive
human plasma.
External Controls
The ARCHITECT Syphilis TP Controls are sold as an accessory to the test. The Negative
Control is made from human plasma shown to be non-reactive for antibodies to TP. The
Positive Control is made from TP-non-reactive human plasma spiked with high titer anti-
TP reactive human plasma. During the clinical study, the controls were analyzed 140
times; the mean for the Positive control was 2.67 S/CO with a SD of 0.093 and 3.51%
CV.
Sample Stability Studies
The stability of TP antibodies in whole blood (serum –no additive and EDTA plasma)
was evaluated using paired samples (serum and EDTA plasma) from 18 different donors.
Each donor set was screened for non-reactivity with the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP assay.
Each donor set was divided into two groups followed by spiking with high reactive TP-
Ab plasma to target concentrations:
a) High nonreactive ~0.80 S/CO, and
b) Low reactive ~1.2 S/CO.
Baseline measurements were established by testing from the primary tube (on clot) within
8 hours of collection (time point 1).
The stability of TP antibodies in samples was evaluated:
• Refrigerated stability (at 2-8°C) ≥ 7 days
• Room temperature stability (at 22°C) ≥ 24 hours
• Room temperature stability (at 30°C) ≥ 24 hours
• Frozen stability (at ≤ -10°C) ≥ 7 days.
• Freeze/thaw stability at 3 cycles and 6 cycles (a freeze/thaw cycle was defined as
frozen at ≤ -10°C for > 12 hours)
Each sample was tested in triplicate at each time point. The evaluation of results was
performed separately for each level, storage condition, and time point.
• For each donor, concentration level, and tube type, the baseline mean of S/CO
8

--- Page 9 ---
was calculated.
• For each donor, concentration level, storage condition, and tube type, the mean
S/CO was calculated for each subsequent time point.
• For each donor, concentration level, storage condition, and tube type, the
difference between the mean S/CO at each test time point and the corresponding
baseline mean S/CO was calculated.
The acceptance criteria were defined as:
• For samples within a target S/CO value of ~0.80, the difference in measured
concentration should be ≤ 0.20 S/CO;
• For samples within a target S/CO value of ~1.20, the percent difference in
measured concentration should be ≤ 20%.
The following results were obtained across tube types (serum and EDTA plasma):

no degradation of the analyte observed:
Specimen Type Storage Temperature Maximum Storage Time
Serum/Plasma (EDTA) Room temperature ≤ 72 hours
2-8°C ≤ 7 days
-10°C or colder ≤ 30 days
On-board Stability
The stability of TP antibodies in serum samples left on the instrument for 3 hours was
evaluated with two levels of antibodies:
High non-reactive sample (~ 0.80 S/CO), and
Low reactive sample (~ 1.2 S/CO)
The samples were prepared in anti-TP negative recalcified plasma spiked with syphilis
positive recalcified plasma to the target concentration. Two sample concentrations were
prepared: ~0.80 S/CO and ~1.2 S/CO. The samples were aliquoted into 13 sample cups
and analyzed as a baseline. For the 3 hour time point, the same samples were also
aliquoted into 13 sample cups and left on-board of the instrument; the samples were
measured after 3 hours elapsed. The results were evaluated by calculating the difference
between the mean of the baseline measurements and the mean of the measurements

Hook Effect
Abbott conducted a study to demonstrate that the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP assay is not
sensitive to the “Hook” effect, where high levels of antibodies may interfere with the
formation of the immune complexes, giving false non-reactive results. The study utilized
five unique TP-antibody reactive samples which were serially diluted with negative (TP-
Ab non-reactive) serum. Each of the diluted samples was tested with the ARCHITECT
Syphilis TP assay in duplicate. The mean, SD, and the %CV were calculated for the
S/CO values of each dilution level. The serial dilution levels were plotted (X-axis) versus
the corresponding mean S/CO values of each dilution level (Y-axis). The data were
considered acceptable if there was no increase in S/CO value when comparing the S/CO
value of a dilution level to the S/CO value of the preceding dilution level.
In all cases, the results showed no increase in S/CO values when compared to the results
from the dilution immediately preceding. The data demonstrate that the ARCHITECT
Syphilis TP assay is not susceptible to interference from specimens with high levels of
anti-syphilis TP.
Carryover
Potential sample carryover within the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP assay from a sample
containing high levels of TP- antibodies was evaluated by comparing the results of a
“protected” negative sample to an “unprotected” negative sample. The negative sample
was the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP Negative Control (made of recalcified human plasma)
and the high positive patient sample had an anti-syphilis TP antibody concentration
greater than or equal to 20.0 S/CO, representing the reactivity level of samples from late
acute syphilis infection. The protected negative sample was tested before a high positive
patient sample, and the unprotected negative sample was tested after the high positive
patient sample. Each carryover run consisted of the following:
1) Wash buffer
2) Protected negative sample (not exposed to potential carryover from a high
reactive sample)
3) High reactive sample
4) Unprotected negative sample (exposed to potential carryover from a high reactive
sample)

The above was repeated 15 times across 5 runs. All protected and unprotected non-
reactive sample replicates produced the same S/CO value of 0.03, demonstrating that
there is no observable within assay sample carryover.
Reactivity with IgG and IgM Treponemal Antibodies
The ability of the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP assay to detect both IgG and IgM type
treponemal antibodies was evaluated utilizing three conjugate preparations: (a) anti-
human TP IgG conjugate (experimental EIA), (b) anti-human TP IgM conjugate
concentrate (experimental EIA), and (c) a conjugate preparation containing both anti-
human TP IgM and anti-human TP IgG- final device composition). Specimens from
commercially available syphilis seroconversion panel were tested with these preparations.
Specimens that demonstrated high levels of both anti-syphilis TP IgG and anti-syphilis
TP IgM with a predicate assay were treated with protein G columns (2-3 cycles) to
remove the IgG present in the specimens. The specimens were then assayed using the
three conjugate preparations. The results demonstrated a significant decrease in the IgG-
specific signal when tested using the IgG-specific experimental ARCHITECT assay and
therefore, confirm that IgG is specifically detected by the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP
assay. The results also demonstrate that the IgM-specific signal of the high positive
samples increases by more than 2-fold (S/N = ~70 to 90) when tested using the IgM-
specific experimental ARCHITECT assay and therefore, confirms that IgM is specifically
detected.

Interference by Endogenous Substances
Potential interference with bilirubin, hemoglobin, triglycerides, cholesterol, protein
(albumin), and gamma globulins was evaluated in an analytical study by spiking a low-
reactive syphilis sample (targeted at 1.2 S/CO) and a high negative sample (targeted at
0.8 S/CO), prepared in recalcified plasma, with each of the selected interfering
substances. The samples were tested (in 12 replicates) on the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP
assay before and after the addition of the interferent. The mean (for the normally
distributed results) or median (for the non-normally distributed results) and SD of the
S/CO values of the spiked samples were calculated. The difference between the mean (or
median) S/CO values between the spiked and unspiked samples was calculated for each
interferent. The acceptance criteria for non-interference were set at ≤ 0.20 S/CO for
negative samples and no more than 20% decrease in S/CO values for samples with S/CO
≥ 1.0. In all samples tested, the difference for samples with S/CO values < 1.0 ranged
from -0.06 to 0.02 S/CO and the % difference for samples with S/CO values > 1.0 ranged
from -8.1% to 2.1%.

Cross-reactivity in Specimens with Medical Conditions not Related to Syphilis
Specimens from individuals diagnosed with other diseases were obtained from
commercial vendors. The presence of the given analyte (microorganism or antibody) was
confirmed with an FDA-cleared (when available) assay. The specimens were tested by
the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP assay and also by the DiaSorin LIASON Treponema Assay.
Discordant results were investigated by additional testing with TP-PA and RPR methods at
an external laboratory. If discordance was not resolved, an FTA-ABS assay was employed
for further testing.
Among the samples tested, the following conditions had one sample (each) that was
reactive by the ARCHITECT TP assay and non-reactive with other treponemal or non-
treponemal assays: CMV IgG, HIV, hyper IgG, and E. coli. There were three additional
specimens (one from a patient with gonorrhea and two from patients with HTLV-II) that
were reactive by the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP but could not be tested by the other tests
(DiaSorin LIAISON, RPR, TP-PA, FTA-ABS) because these were plasma specimens and
paired serum samples from these patients were not available.
The results of the specificity study in samples from individuals with other diseases are
shown below.

f. Assay cut-off:
The ARCHITECT Syphylis TP assay was initially developed as a qualitative assay with a
target performance of high agreement with a syphilis Treponema pallidum particle
agglutination assay (TP-PA). The assay cutoff was evaluated by ROC analysis based on
the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP results from a total of 6,845 specimens. Assay sensitivity
was calculated based on the 409 antibody-positive specimens; assay specificity was
evaluated based on the results from the “normal” donor and diagnostic population
consisting of 6,436 specimens. Specimen data were analyzed using fractions/multiples of
the calibrator to determine a cutoff multiplier value (a numeric value with which the

mean Relative Light Unit (RLU) signal of the positive calibrator is multiplied to calculate
the cutoff) that exhibited optimal agreement to TPPA. The multiplier of 0.2 was selected
to minimize the frequency of both false negative and false positive results versus TPPA
while maximizing the differentiation between true negative and true positive patients.
The analytically selected cutoff was further validated in a clinical study in the intended
use population. The results confirmed that the selected cutoff multiplier of 0.2 resulted in
high positive and negative % agreements when comparing to the reference method
algorithm result without the need to assign an equivocal zone to the candidate assay.
The ARCHITECT Syphilis TP assay results are expressed as the ratio of the sample RLU
to the cutoff RLU (S/CO). The S/CO is calculated using the equation:
S/CO = Sample RLU / Cutoff RLU, where
Cutoff RLU = Calibrator Mean RLU x 0.2
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The results of the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP assay were compared to a composite
comparator based on an algorithm of results obtained from three commercially
available syphilis assays: (a) treponemal chemiluminescent immunoassay (TP-CLIA),
a nontreponemal assay (Rapid Plasma Reagin [RPR]), and a second treponemal assay
(Treponema Pallidum Particle Agglutination [TP-PA]). Additional details of how the
final comparator result was determined are provided below in the “Clinical Studies”
section.
b. Matrix comparison:
The suitability of various blood collection tube types for use with the ARCHITECT
Syphilis TP assay was evaluated in an analytical study. Samples were obtained from
multiple donors and venous blood was collected in the following vacutainer tube
types:
• serum (plastic)-Used as the control
• dipotassium EDTA
• lithium heparin
• sodium heparin
• lithium heparin plasma separator
• serum separator (plastic)
• tripotassium EDTA
A total of 28 donor sets, found to be nonreactive using the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP
assay were spiked with a highly reactive syphilis sample to targeted concentrations,
leaving one sample in each set not spiked. A total of four levels of reactivity were
evaluated:
14

--- Page 15 ---
Group 1: Nonreactive Target S/CO: ≤ 0.40
Group 2: High Nonreactive Target S/CO: ~ 0.80
Group 3: Low Reactive Target S/CO: ~ 1.20
Group 4: High Reactive Target S/CO: ~ 6.00
Each sample was tested in triplicate on one ARCHITECT i 2000SR instrument and the
mean of the results for each matrix type was compared to the mean of the respective
serum control tube. The data was tabulated for each matrix type and for each sample.
The matrix types under evaluation were considered acceptable if, when compared to
the control tube type (serum, plastic):
• the difference was less than or equal to 0.20 S/CO for samples with S/CO
values lower than 1.00, and
• the % difference was greater than or equal to -20% for samples with S/CO
values greater than 1.00
The ARCHITECT Syphilis TP assay showed the following mean/median S/CO
difference and distribution of S/CO difference for nonreactive samples when
compared to the control tube type (serum).

3. Clinical Studies:
A multicenter study was conducted on the ARCHITECT iSystem between July and
December 2015 to evaluate the ability of the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP assay to detect
antibodies (IgG and IgM) directed against Treponema pallidum (TP). A total of 2222
specimens were tested in the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP clinical study. Two specimens
were excluded due to insufficient sample volume. The remaining 2220 specimens
included 1145 prospectively collected from the intended use population; 406 pre-selected
samples presumed to be positive for antibodies directed against TP based on previous
laboratory testing (including 20 pregnant women known to be reactive for syphilis
antibodies); 480 from apparently healthy individuals; 179 from medically diagnosed
individuals with primary, secondary, or latent syphilis; and 10 specimens from pregnant
females each spiked with individual high antibody-positive syphilis TP specimens
The 1145 prospective specimens analyzed in the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP clinical study
were collected at clinical sites in the following locations:

The clinical performance of the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP assay was evaluated by
calculating positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement of the assay with
the final comparator result based on an algorithm of results from three commercially
available syphilis assays: a treponemal chemiluminescent immunoassay (TP-CLIA), a
nontreponemal assay (Rapid Plasma Reagin [RPR]), and a second treponemal assay
(Treponema Pallidum Particle Agglutination [TP-PA]. Because the clinical diagnosis of
syphilis must be supported by two reactive laboratory tests, consisting of a treponemal
assay and a nontreponemal assay, or at least two treponemal assays, employing an
algorithm of three syphilis tests to determine the comparator result presents a picture
closest to the serological “truth.”
The final comparator result was determined using a 2 out of 3 rule (TP-CLIA, RPR, and
TP-PA). In cases where the TP-CLIA result was “equivocal” (as per the device labeling),
and the TP-PA result was “inconclusive”, the final comparator result could not be
determined; those results would be excluded from the final analysis (there were no
“indeterminate” comparator results in this study). The table below shows how the final
comparator result was interpreted.

Clinical Performance in Prospectively Collected Specimens in Intended Use Population
The 1145 prospectively collected specimens in the intended use population, analyzed in
the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP clinical study consisted of 442 specimens sent for routine
syphilis testing (325 female and 117 male, 6-91 years old), 304 pregnant females (16–43
years old), and 399 HIV positive (44 female and 355 male, 18–72 years old). Of the 1145
prospectively-collected specimens, 136 were from pediatric subjects (6–21 years old).
Each of those specimens was analyzed with the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP assay and with
the three reference assays.
A summary of the serological test profile for all prospectively-collected specimens in the
intended use population is presented in the following table.

N. Instrument Name:
ARCHITECT i2000SR System
O. System Descriptions:
The ARCHITECT i2000SR System uses a System Control Center (SCC) computer system
which contains software providing interface with the ARCHITECT System and a host
computer. The ARCHITECT System software interprets assay information, calculates results
and provides the interface for controlling the system hardware.
This chemiluminescent immunoassay contains many automated specimen processing steps
prior to the detection of a luminescent signal by the ARCHITECT system optics. The
presence or absence of target antigen in the sample is determined by comparing the
chemiluminescent signal in the reaction to the cutoff signal determined from an active
calibration.
1. Modes of Operation:
This is a fully automated immunoassay analyzer.
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ________ or No ___X_____
2. Software:
The latest version of the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP assay software is v9.10. The clinical
studies were conducted using the ARCHITECT System software v8.10 and v9.00. The
modifications made to the software from v8.10 to v9.10 do not impact the decision
making process.
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
24

--- Page 25 ---
The specimens are identified by an internal barcode reader.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The specimen processing is automated. The operator only needs to place the primary
sample tube in the instrument sample carrier and place the carrier onto the loading tray.
5. Calibration:
Calibration is required after assay installation and requires generation of an active
calibration curve. Assays do not need to be calibrated every time they are run; however,
certain variables make recalibration necessary. Calibration must be performed when a
new reagent lot is used, when documentation accompanying a new version of an existing
assay states that calibration is required, and when the controls are out of range.
6. Quality Control:
Quality control is addressed by running external controls for the ARCHITECT Syphilis
TP assay which include negative and positive controls prepared in recalcified human
plasma. The positive control (inactivated) is reactive for anti-TP.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not applicable.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
