H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Refer to Indications for Use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Clungene Methamphetamine Tests are immunochromatographic assays for the qualitative
determination of d-methamphetamine in human urine at cut-off concentration of 1000
ng/mL. The calibrator is d-methamphetamine. The tests are available in a Cassette
format, an Easy Cup format, a Split Key Cup format and a Dip Card format.
The tests provide only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test
result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.
This test is intended for over-the-counter (OTC) consumer use as the first step in a two-
step process to provide consumers with information concerning the presence or absence
of the above stated drugs or their metabolites in a urine sample. Information regarding
confirmatory testing- the second step in the process, is provided in the package labeling.
For in vitro diagnostic use only.
Clungene Marijuana Tests are immunochromatographic assays for the qualitative
determination of 11-Nor- 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol-9-COOH in human urine at cut-off
concentration of 50 ng/mL. The calibrator is 11-Nor- 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol-9-COOH.
The tests are available in △a Cassette format, an Easy Cup format, a Split Key Cup format
and a Dip Card format. △

For in vitro diagnostic use only.
Clungene Morphine Tests are immunochromatographic assays for the qualitative
determination of Morphine in human urine at cut-off concentration of 300 ng/mL. The
calibrator is Morphine. The tests are available in a Cassette format, an Easy Cup format, a
Split Key Cup format and a Dip Card format.

Publication FDA 97-4224
L. Test Principle:
The CLUNGENE Methamphetamine Tests, CLUNGENE Morphine Tests, and CLUNGENE
Marijuana Tests are rapid tests for the qualitative detection of d-Methamphetamine,
Morphine and 11-Nor-△9-Tetrahydrocannabinol-9-COOH in urine samples. The tests are
lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays. During testing, a urine specimen migrates
upward by capillary action. If target drugs present in the urine specimen are below the cut-off
concentration, it will not saturate the binding sites of its specific monoclonal mouse antibody
coated on the particles. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized
drug-conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the test line region. The colored
line will not form in the test line region if the target drug level exceeds its cutoff-
concentration because it will saturate all the binding sites of the antibody coated on the
particles. A band should form in the control region of the devices regardless of the presence
of drug or metabolite in the sample to indicate that the tests have been performed properly.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of -100% cut
off, -75% cut off, -50% cut off, -25% cut off, +25% cut off, +50% cut off , +75%
cut off and +100% cut off. These samples were prepared by spiking drug in
negative samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by GC/MS. All sample
aliquots were blindly labeled by the person who prepared the samples, and this
person did not take part in the sample testing. For each concentration, tests were
performed by 12 operators in two runs per day for 25 days per device in a
randomized order. The results obtained are summarized in the following tables.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Device stability has been evaluated through accelerated and real-time studies. A
transport simulation study was performed to test extreme shipping temperatures.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The
manufacturer claims that the devices are stable at 4-30 °C for 24 months based
on the accelerated stability study at 45°C, real time stability determination at
both 4°C and 30°C and transport simulation conditions at –20 and 40 .
℃ ℃
This device has internal process controls. A colored line appearing in the
control region confirms that sufficient sample volume and that the correct
technique has been used. Users are informed not to interpret the test if a
colored line failed to appear in the control region. External control materials
are not supplied with these devices; however the labeling provides information
on how to obtain quality control materials.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Potential interfering substances found in human urine of physiological or pathological
conditions were added to drug-free urine and target drugs urine with concentrations at
25% below and 25% above Cut-Off levels. These urine samples were tested using
three lots of each device. Compounds that showed no interference at a concentration
of 100µg/mL are summarized in the following tables. There were no differences
observed for different devices.

Effect of Urine Specific Gravity and Urine pH
To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine pH, urine samples,
with 1.000 to 1.035 specific gravity (1.000, 1.003, 1.008, 1.014, 1.018, 1.020, 1.022,

6.0, 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0) were spiked with target drugs at 25% below and 25% above
Cut-Off levels. These samples were tested using three lots of each device.
Results were all positive for samples at and above +25% Cut-Off and all
negative for samples at and below -25% Cut-Off. There were no differences
observed for different devices and the sponsor claims that pH and specific
gravity do not affect the results of the device.

Method comparison studies for the CLUNGENE Methamphetamine Tests, the
CLUNGENE Morphine Tests and the CLUNGENE Marijuana Tests were
performed in-house with three laboratory assistants for each device. Operators
ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered clinical samples. The samples
were blind labeled and compared to GC/MS results. The results are presented in
the tables below:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 1680 lay persons.
The lay users had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in
age from 20 to > 50 years. Urine samples were prepared at the following
concentrations; negative, +/-75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of the cutoff by spiking drug(s)
into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were
confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers and
blind-labeled. Each participant was provided with the package insert in English only,
1 blind labeled sample and a device. Lay-users were also given surveys on the ease
of understanding the package insert instructions. All lay users indicated that the
device instructions could be easily followed. A Flesch-Kincaid reading analysis was
performed on each package insert and the scores revealed a reading Grade Level of
7.
