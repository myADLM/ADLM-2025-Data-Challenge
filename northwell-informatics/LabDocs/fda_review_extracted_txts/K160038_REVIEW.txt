The Unistrip1 Generic Blood Glucose Test Strips are used with the OneTouch Ultra2,
OneTouch UltraMini and One-Touch UltraSmart meters purchased before April 2016,
and the OneTouch® Ultra®, purchased before October 2012, set at calibration code 49,
for measuring glucose (sugar) in whole capillary blood. The strips are meant for self-
testing of blood glucose as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control.
They are for single patient use only and should not be shared.
They are used to quantitatively measure glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples
taken from the finger, palm, or forearm. Testing is done outside the body (in vitro
diagnostic use).
They are indicated for use by people with diabetes in their home as an aid to monitor the
effectiveness of diabetes control.
Not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus and is not intended
for use on neonates.
UniStrip1 Generic Blood Glucose Test Strips allow alternate site testing (AST) from the
fingertip, palm and/or the forearm. (Use of palm AST is not to be done with OneTouch
Ultra meter). Alternative site testing should only be done during steady-state times (when
glucose is not changing rapidly).
The UniStrip Control Solutions are for use with the UniStrip1 Generic Blood Glucose
Test Strips and One Touch Ultra meters to check that the meters and test strips are
working together properly and that the test is performing correctly.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
1. CLSI EP7-A2. Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline (2007).
2. CLSI EP5-A3. Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement
Methods; Approved Guideline (2015).
3. CLSI EP6-A. Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A
Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline (2014)
L. Test Principle:
Glucose in the blood sample mixes with glucose oxidase on the UniStrip1 Generic Blood
Glucose Test Strip and a small electrical current is generated and measured by the meter(s)
and displayed as a blood glucose results. The strength of the current changes proportionally
with the amounts of glucose in the blood sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The sponsor states that the following performance evaluations provided for the UniStrip1
Generic Blood Glucose Test Strips were obtained using the 3 claimed meters for which the
claim dates are changing (LifeScan OneTouch Ultra 2, One Touch UltraSmart and OneTouch
UltraMini) purchased before April 2016. The compatibility of the test strips with the One
Touch Ultra meter has not been reevaluated since the claimed date period has remained the
same as originally cleared in k113135, i.e. as purchased before October 2012. The sponsor
states that UniStrip1 Generic Blood Glucose Test Strip calibration code 49 was used in each
of the performance evaluations.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision was performed in one day using five blood glucose
concentrations. Each sample was tested using calibration code 49 with the UniStrip 1
Generic Blood Glucose Test Strips and the OneTouch Ultra2, OneTouch UltraMini
and OneTouch UltraSmart glucose meters. Three UniStrip1Generic Blood Glucose
Test Strip lots were used with each blood glucose meter. Five different meters for
each model type above were each used to test each sample in singlicate with all three
test strip lots. This resulted in a total of 25 tests for each glucose meter model and test
strip lot combination for each glucose concentration. The results are summarized
below.

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range
of 20-600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The UniStrip1 Generic Blood Glucose Test Strips are traceable to the NIST SRM
#917c glucose standard. The method comparison study was performed using the
candidate devices and YSI as the reference method (see Section 2.a.)
Test Strip Stability:
Stability of the UniStrip1 Generic Blood Glucose Test Strips was assessed using real
time and accelerated testing. Protocols and acceptance criteria for these studies were
reviewed and found to be acceptable to support the manufacturer claimed shelf life
stability of 24 months and opened vial stability of 3 months when stored at 39°F-
104°F (4-40°C) and relative humidity of 10-90%.
Control Solution Value Assignment and Stability:
The UniStrip Control Solutions Level 1 and Level 2 were previously cleared
(k060467) and are identical except in name. The value assignment protocol and the
stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed under k060467and found to
be acceptable to support the claims that the closed control solution vials are stable for
18 months and the opened control solution vials are stable for 90 days after opening
when stored at the recommended storage conditions of 39°F-86°F (4°C-30°C).
d. Detection limit:
See linearity in section M1b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed to evaluate exogenous and endogenous substances
using three lots of UniStrip1 Generic Blood Glucose Test Strips and the OneTouch
Ultra2, OneTouch UltraMini, and OneTouch UltraSmart meters. Venous blood was
spiked to two glucose levels (50-100 and 250-350 mg/dL) and the potential
interferent concentrations were tested at 4 levels ranging from therapeutic (or
physiological) to toxic (or pathological). Each interferent and glucose concentration
were tested in replicates of five with each test strip lot and compared to the control
sample containing no added interferent. The sponsor defined no significant
interference as ≤10% difference between individual interferent samples and the
control sample. Results are shown below:

N. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Altitude study: The effect of altitude on the performance of the UniStrip1 Generic Blood
Glucose Test Strips with the OneTouchUltra2, OneTouch UltraMini, and OneTouch
UltraSmart meters was evaluated using venous whole blood samples spiked with glucose
to 5 concentrations (43, 82, 131, 199 and 318 mg/dL). Each meter model was used to test
each sample five times on 3 test strip lots at altitudes of 298, 4790, and 11,161 feet above
sea level. The results from each measurement were compared to the YSI values for each
sample. The results demonstrate acceptable bias to YSI and support the labeling claims
that altitudes up to 10,000 feet have no significant effect on performance of the
UniStrip1Generic Blood Glucose Test Strips with the claimed meters.
2. Hematocrit study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the
UniStrip1 Generic Blood Glucose Test Strips with the OneTouch Ultra2, OneTouch
UltraMini, and OneTouch UltraSmart meters was evaluated using venous whole blood
samples with hematocrit levels of 25, 30, 42, 50 and 60% spiked with glucose to 3
concentrations (40, 139, and 315 mg/dL). Each sample was then tested in replicates of 10
using each meter type with three lots of UniStrip1 Generic Blood Glucose Test Strips and
the values were compared with those obtained from YSI analyzer. The % biases relative
to YSI were acceptable within the claimed hematocrit range of 30 to 55%.

3. Sample volume study: A sample volume study was performed using venous whole
blood samples spiked to five glucose concentrations (40, 79, 113, 179, and 220 mg/dL, as
measured by YSI) to evaluate the effect of different sample volumes (0.6, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0,
1.1, 1.3, and 1.5 mL) on the performance of the device. Results at each sample volume
were compared to the corresponding YSI values. Three lots of test strips and 10
measurements per lot were used on the OneTouch Ultra2, OneTouch UltraMini, and
OneTouch UltraSmart meters. Results from these studies support the claimed minimum
sample volume of 1.0 mL.
4. Operating Conditions: The operating temperature range and relative humidity range
(RH) were evaluated by placing OneTouch Ultra2, OneTouch UltraMini, and OneTouch
UltraSmart meters, with the UniStrip1 Generic Blood Glucose Test Strips, in
environmental chambers with the following temperature/relative humidity combinations:
6°C/10% RH, 6°C/90% RH, 25°C/10% RH, 25°C/90% RH, 44°C/10% RH and
44°C/90% RH. Fresh venous blood samples with glucose concentrations of
approximately 48, 154 and 318 mg/dL were tested five times with each glucose meter
model at all of the temperature/RH combinations shown above and the results from each
measurement were compared to the YSI values for each sample. These results support the
sponsor’s claims in the labeling that the UniStrip 1 Generic Blood Glucose test strips
with the claimed meters can be used in the temperature and humidity ranges specified in
the device labeling, that is 42-111°F (6-44°C) and 10-90%RH.
5. Readability Assessment: A Flesch-Kinkaid reading level assessment was conducted
demonstrating that the test strip and control inserts were written at or below an 8th grade
reading level.
6. Customer Support: The user is instructed to call 1.866.889.6229 for additional
assistance, Monday - Friday, 9am - 5pm EST.
7. Software validation: Software validation testing was performed demonstrating that the
error codes displayed by the OneTouch Ultra2, OneTouch UltraMini and OneTouch
UltraSmart meters functioned as intended with the UniStrip1 Generic Blood Glucose Test
Strips when set at calibration code 49.
O. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
P. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
