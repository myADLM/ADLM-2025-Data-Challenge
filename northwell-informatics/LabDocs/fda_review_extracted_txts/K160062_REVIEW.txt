L. Test Principle:
The AUTION ELEVEN AE-4022 Semi-automatic Urine Analyzer device uses combinations
of 4 light emitting diodes to measure the reflectance of the reagent pads of the AUTION
10EA Stick test strips. Two wavelengths are used for the reflectance determination of each
analyte, except blood which uses a single wavelength. The percent reflectance received by
the optical sensor for each analyte on the test strip is then used to calculate a semi-
quantitative value and a qualitative value.
The AUTION ELEVEN AE-4022 Semi-automatic Urine Analyzer also measures urine color
tone. This is done by measuring the reflectance of a blank pad on the AUTION 10EA Stick.
The concentration for each analyte is corrected for urine color tone, so that the urine color
does not interfere with measurement.
Assay Principles of the AUTION 10EA Stick:
Glucose: Based on a double sequential enzyme reaction. Glucose oxidase catalyzes the
formation of gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide from the oxidation of glucose. A second
enzyme, peroxidase, catalyzes the oxidative coupling of 4-amino-antipyrine and 1-Naphthol-
3-6-disulfonic acid by hydrogen peroxide to form a Quinone imine purple color.
5

--- Page 6 ---
Protein: Based on the protein-error-of-indicators reaction. At a constant pH, the presence
of protein causes a change in the color of the indicator to a cyan color.
Bilirubin: The test is based on azo-coupling reaction of bilirubin with diazotized 2-methyl-
5- nitroaniline in acidic medium. Varying bilirubin levels will produce a reddish brown color.
Urobilinogen: The test is based on azo-coupling reaction of Urobilinogen with diazotized
3,3’-dimethyloxy-4,4’-biphenyl bis-diazonium tetrafluoroborate in acidic medium. Varying
Urobilinogen levels will produce a reddish brown color.
pH: Based on a mixed indicator principle that gives a broad range of colors (yellow to
cyan) covering the entire urinary pH range.
Specific Gravity: Cation extraction.
Blood: Based on the peroxidase-like activity of hemoglobin, which catalyzes the reaction
of Cumene hydroperoxide and 3,3,5,5’- tetramethylbenzidine to form a cyan color.
Ketones: Legal reaction. Based on the reaction of sodium nitroprusside with acetoacetic
acid to form a purple complex.
Nitrites: Griess reaction. Nitrite reacts with sulfanilamide, followed by a diazo-coupling
reaction to from a pink colored product.
Leukocytes: Granulocytic leukocytes contain esterases that catalyze the hydrolysis of 3-(N-
Toluenesulfonyl-L-alanyloxy) indole (TAI) to from indoxyl, which further reacts with 2-
Methoxy-4-(N-morpholino) benzenediazonium (MMB) to form a purple product.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted using the Semi-Automated Urinalysis System
consisting of the AUTION ELEVEN AE -4022 Semi-Automatic Urine Analyzer and
the AUTION Sticks 10EA. The studies were performed at three clinical laboratory
sites. At each site, the precision study was conducted by one operator using one
instrument and one lots of test strips. For the precision studies, three samples were
tested in duplicate in each run, two runs per day for 20 days for a total of 80 replicates
for each site.
The samples were three levels of urine-based quality control material: negative, mid-
level positive, and high-positive.
Within run (repeatability) and total imprecision (reproducibility) were calculated.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A study was conducted to evaluate the reportable range for each analyte of the
AUTION ELEVEN Semi-Automated Urinalysis System. The reportable range was
evaluated by measuring samples with known concentrations of each analyte covering
all measurement color block ranks.
Samples were measured using 3 lots of test strips in replicates of 7 for a total of 21
measurements per sample. The results are summarized below:

Shelf life stability of AUTION Sticks 10EA:
Stability studies were performed to assess the shelf life (closed bottle) stability for the
AUTION Stick 10EA urine strips used on the AUTION ELEVEN AE-4022 Semi-
automatic Urine Analyzer. The protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
found sufficient. The stability studies supports the claim that AUTION Sticks 10EA,
unopened, are stable for 2 years from date of manufacture when stored within
temperature range of 34 to 86°F.
Open bottle stability of AUTION Sticks 10EA:
Open bottle stability studies were performed on the AUTION Stick 10EA urine strips
used on the AUTION ELEVEN AE-4022 Semi-automatic Urine Analyzer. The
protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found sufficient. Based on the
studies, once opened, the test strips are stable for 31 days when stored from 34 to 86
°F.
Transport (High Temperature) stability for AUTION Sticks 10EA:
High temperature stability studies were performed on the AUTION Stick 10EA urine
strips to establish stability performance at high temperatures that may be experienced
during product shipment. The protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
found sufficient. Based on the studies, the test sticks may be stored or transported in
closed bottle containers at a temperature up to 50°C for 1 week without deterioration.
d. Detection limit:

Samples were prepared by spiking analyte into negative pooled urine. Each pool was
spiked with the target analyte concentration, plus a concentration on each side of the
target in order to determine the sensitivity concentration. Each samples was analyzed
in replicates of 5 using 3 strip lots, for a total of n=30 results. The analytical
sensitivity for each rank measurement color block is defined as the lowest
concentration at which ≥50% of the test results are positive between the negative
color block, and the first positive (1+) or trace (±) color block. The results are
summarized in the following table:

Study 2: A sensitivity study was conducted to demonstrate the cut-off concentration
between the qualitative measurement blocks for each analyte of the AUTION Stick
10EA. The low cut-off concentration for each measurement block is defined as the
lowest concentration at which ≥ 50% of the test results are positive for the greater
color block. Samples were prepared by spiking analyte into negative pooled urine
pool. Each pool was spiked with the target analyte concentration. Additionally, a
sample was prepared at a slightly lower concentration than the target concentration.
Each sample was created twice, using 2 urine pools, and tested in replicates of 5 on
each pool. Each urine pool was tested with 3 lots of reagent strips for a total of 30
replicates per sample.
The low cut-off concentrations for each qualitative measurement rank of each analyte
are summarized in the table below.

Each sample was measured on the instrument in replicates of 5. The mean
reflectance was calculated for each sample type. To assess whether a substance
caused significant interference, the %reflectance from samples with no interfering
substance was compared against the mean %reflectance of the sample spiked with the
interfering substance. Interference was determined based on the acceptance criteria
stated below:
Negative Samples: If mean values are 1+ (75 for Leukocytes) or greater,
interference is considered positive.
For pH and Specific gravity: If mean value is greater than +/-1 rank, there is
significant interference.
Positive Samples: If sample results differ by greater than +/- 1 color block
between samples containing the interfering substance and samples without it,
interference will be considered positive.

The effect of pH
The following tests were found to be affected by pH of 3 of lower: Glucose, Specific
gravity, and Leukocytes.
The effect of Specific gravity
No interference was found on the analytes due to urine specific gravity using sucrose as
additive to change specific gravity.
Color tone detection and correction
A study was conducted to verify that the system is insensitive to interference from
red, brown, orange and green colored urine samples.
The samples were two levels of commercial control material (negative and high-
positive); ThermoScientific MAS Controls 1 and 2. To the samples were spiked dyes
to create the colors of red, orange, brown, and green. For reference, the control
materials were spiked with water. No significant effect on color on the results was if
the sample with added dye read with +/- 1 rank measurement block.
Based on the results, is no interference on measurement results due to variations in
sample color tone.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of the
AUTION ELEVEN Semi-Automated Urinalysis System for the measurement of urine
chemistry analytes. Results were compared to those from the predicate AUTION
MAX AX-4030 Automated Urine Analyzer for all analytes except Specific Gravity.
The AUTION JET AJ-4270 Urine Analyzer (k030600) was the comparator method
for specific gravity.
Testing was performed at multiple sites by at least4 operators and using at least 4
instruments, and 3 different lots of test sticks. The urine samples for analysis were
provided by either local hospitals or each site’s internal clinical laboratory.
Specimens were single daily urine. These were refrigerated at 2-8°C within 2 hours
of collection, and tested within 24 hours of collection. For testing, the samples were
allowed to warm to room temperature (10 to 30°C) for 30 minutes, and were tested
within 2 hours. In order to obtain the necessary range in concentration for each
analyte, a small number of the samples were prepared by spiking analyte into urine.
These samples constituted no more than 7% of the total.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The AUTION ELEVEN AE-4022 Semi-automatic Urine Analyzer requires the user to
dip an AUTION Stick 10EA test strip into a patient urine specimen of sufficient volume.
The user then removes the strip and excess urine, and places the test trip onto the
instrument. The remaining operations of the test are carried out automatically. The test
strip feeding mechanism transports the test strip to the photometric section of the
instrument. After 60 seconds to allow for the analyte reacting with the reagent
chemistries, the instrument measures each pad’s reflectance, and converts the reflectance
to a qualitative and semi-quantitative result.
5. Calibration:
Calibration of the AUTION Sticks 10EA by the user is not required.
6. Quality Control:
Use of control material is recommended in labeling. Controls should be run: 1) daily, 2)
whenever a new bottle of test sticks is opened, 3) before reporting unusual results, and 4)
when training new operators.
Control material is not provided with the system. Instead, user manual recommends use
of commercially available control material.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Temperature and Humidity Study:
Temperature and humidity operating conditions of the analyzer were evaluated at
temperatures ranging from 8 to 32ºC and relative humidity from 28% to 62%. The
conditions included combinations of the lowest humidity and highest temperature. The
results support the sponsor’s claimed operating temperature for the AUTION ELEVEN
AE-4022 Semi-automatic Urine Analyzer of 10 to 30ºC with relative humidity ranging
from 30% to 60%.
2. EMC:
Sponsor provided test reports from independent testing firm demonstrating compliance
with the following EMC standards:
UL 61010-1: Electrical Equipment For Measurement, Control, and Laboratory Use;
Part 1: General Requirements.
IEC 61010-2-101: Safety requirements for electrical equipment for measurement,
control and laboratory use - Part 2-101: Particular requirements for in vitro diagnostic
27

--- Page 28 ---
(IVD) medical equipment.
CAN/CSA 61010-1-04: Safety Requirements for Electrical Equipment For
Measurement, Control, and Laboratory Use; Part 1: General Requirements.
IEC 61010-2-081: Safety requirements for electrical equipment for measurement,
control, and laboratory use - Part 2-081: Particular requirements for automatic and
semi-automatic laboratory equipment for analysis and other purposes.
FCC Part 15 Radio Frequency Device Subpart B Unintentional Radiators.
Operating mode: During testing, an exercise program was used to run the instrument
(included the barcode reader) in a manner similar to typical use.
3. Software:
The software documentation was reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor
provided documentation to support that the device was designed, developed and is under
good software lifecycle processes.
4. Barcode reader
A hand held barcode reader is optionally available with the AUTION ELEVEN AE-4022
Semi-automatic Urine Analyzer for entering patient IDs. The functional performance of
the barcode reader was verified against the design specifications. The manual input of
patient ID was compared for data integrity to a scanned barcode input across 5 different
test ID’s, and across two different field formats; (1) full 13 numeric characters and (2) 10
numeric characters starting at the second numeric character. The verification test
demonstrated that the bar code reader operates as intended to the design specifications.
5. Color tone measurement
The AUTION ELEVEN AE-4022 Semi-automatic Urine Analyzer measures 23 urine
color tones. This is done by measuring the reflectance of a blank pad on the AUTION
10EA Stick. The concentration for each analyte is corrected for urine color tone.
Studies were conducted to verify that the system is able to detect a broad range in colors.
Because the occurrence of patient samples covering the 23 possible color tones is rare,
the samples used in the testing were urine spiked with dyes. Each of 23 different colored
samples (yellow, red, green, blue, violet, orange, brown with hues of dark, normal, light)
was manually dispensed onto a test strip pad. The reflectance was read and transformed
into a color measurement. These results were compared to a visual read. All colors were
detected.
