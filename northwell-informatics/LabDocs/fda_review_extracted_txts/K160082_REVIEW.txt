Cary-Blair medium is a non-nutritive balanced salt solution containing disodium phosphate
to provide buffering capability, sodium chloride and calcium chloride to provide essential
ions that help maintain osmotic balance. Agar is a solidifying agent and gives a semisolid
texture to the medium. Sodium thioglycollate helps maintained an oxygen-reduced
environment to help maintain the viability of enteric bacteria during the transport to the
laboratory.
The semi-solid Cary Blair medium is composed of the following components:

1. Analytical performance:
Analytical studies were conducted to determine the ability of the Puritan® Opti-Tranz™
Cary-Blair Collection and Transport System to maintain the viability of enteric
microorganisms.
The performance of the Puritan® Opti-Tranz™ Cary-Blair Collection and Transport
System was determined using quantitative colony enumeration techniques outlined in the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M40-A2 document. Bacterial viability
studies were performed. The swabs from each transport system were inoculated with 100
µL of select bacterial concentrations prepared in a fecal matrix and/or 0.85% phosphate
buffered saline (PBS). To facilitate testing, a homogeneous fecal matrix was prepared by
diluting pre-screened negative fresh clinical fecal material in 0.85% PBS to a 30%
concentration by volume.
Once inoculated, the swabs were then placed in their respective transport tubes and held
at various time intervals; at the designated time intervals the swabs were removed and
processed. To test the viability at various time intervals the inoculated swabs were held at
room temperature for 0, 24, and 48 hours and refrigerated for 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours.
The eight ATCC strains listed in Table 1 below were used to evaluate the performance of
the Puritan Opti-Tranz Cary-Blair Collection and Transport System. This device was
tested using the swabs included with the transport kit. Viability studies were conducted in
duplicate at 0, 24, and 48 at room temperature (20-25°C) and at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours at
refrigerated temperatures (2-8°C) using the Roll-Plate and Swab Elution Methods.

Roll-Plate Method:
Bacterial suspensions were prepared from fresh18-24 hour cultures of each
microorganism in a separate vial containing 10 mL of fecal matrix or 0.85% sterile saline
to obtain 1.5 x 108 CFU/mL suspensions. One log serial dilutions were made and 100

µL aliquots of dilutions were absorbed into the swabs and immediately placed into the

Puritan Opti-Tranz Cary-Blair medium. For fecal specimens, the final dilution prior to
swab inoculation was done with fecal matrix to maximize the amount of fecal material on
the swab.
After incubation at each time point, the swabs were removed from the transport tubes and
used to inoculate the entire surface of the appropriate agar plate. The plates were
incubated in appropriate culture conditions for 24-48 hours or until countable colonies
were visible. Manual colony counts were conducted for each time interval for each swab-
organism combination. The dilution yielding colony counts nearest to zero (not to exceed
250 CFU) was reported. Log increases or decreases in survival are based on a
10
comparison between time-zero and the last time point collected for each temperature.
Swab Elution Method:
Bacterial suspensions were prepared from fresh18-24 hour cultures of each
microorganism in a separate vial containing 10 mL of fecal matrix or 0.85% sterile saline
to obtain 1.5 x 108 CFU/mL suspensions. The suspensions were diluted in 0.85% saline
or fecal matrix solution to obtain working suspensions of 1.5 x 107 CFU/ml, and then 100
µL aliquots of dilutions were absorbed into the swabs and immediately placed into the
Puritan Opti-Tranz Cary-Blair medium. After incubation at each time point, the swabs
were removed from the transport tubes and 100 µL of 1-log serial dilutions were made
10
in 0.85% saline. 100 µL of each dilution was plated on the appropriate agar plate for each
temperature and time point. The plates were incubated in appropriate culture conditions
for 24-48 hours or until countable colonies were visible. Manual colony counts were
conducted for each time interval for each swab-organism combination. The dilution
yielding zero-time colony counts between 25 and 250 CFU was reported.
Recovery results from Roll Plate and Swab Elution experiments are shown in Tables 2-9
below for various strains and product lot numbers tested at the storage times, specimen
matrix and temperature ranges indicated.

2-8 oC Swab Elution Table 3 Table 7
20-25 oC Roll Plate Table 4 Table 8

Acceptance criteria for recovery of microorganisms were as recommended in the CLSI
document M40-A2 and defined as being within two log increase or decrease from the
10
starting titer at time zero. Manual colony counts were conducted for each of the time
intervals for each microorganism held at each temperature. The results from these studies
demonstrated that the Puritan Opti-Tranz Cary-Blair Collection and Transport System
can support the viability enteric bacteria for up to 48 hours at 20-25 oC and 72 hours at 2-
8 oC.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Shelf-life Stability: Shelf life stability tests were performed successfully on three lots
of products stored for 20 months at room temperature. Recovery of microorganisms
from fecal matrix was assessed by the Roll Plate method, as described in section M.1
above (see Table 10 below for results).

pH Stability: The pH of the test device was measured at predetermined time intervals
for up to 20 months after manufacturing date. The test was performed using calibrated
pH meter with random samples from three different lots of Puritan Opti-Tranz Cary-
Blair Collection and Transport System. All samples tested were found to maintain pH
within the specified range of pH 6.90 to 7.50.
Cytotoxicity: Cytotoxicity testing was conducted to evaluate the glue, shaft and
rayon tipped swabs for potential cytotoxicity effects following ISO Elution Method-
1X MEM Extract. No evidence of cytotoxicity was detected.
Sterilization: Puritan Opti-Tranz Cary-Blair Collection and Transport System are
sterilized by gamma irradiation and validated following ANSI/ AAMI/ISO
11137:2006, Sterilization of health care products Radiation guidelines.
