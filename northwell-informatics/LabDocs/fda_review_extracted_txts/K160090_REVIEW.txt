H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Lumipulse® G Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA®) is a qualitative
serum and plasma (lithium heparin or dipotassium EDTA) test that combines the
results of Lumipulse G HE4, Lumipulse G CA125II and menopausal status into a
numerical score.
Lumipulse G ROMA is intended to aid in assessing whether a premenopausal or
postmenopausal woman who presents with an ovarian adnexal mass is at high or
low likelihood of finding malignancy on surgery. Lumipulse G ROMA is
indicated for women who meet the following criteria: over age 18; ovarian
adnexal mass present for which surgery is planned, and not yet referred to an
oncologist. Lumipulse G ROMA must be interpreted in conjunction with an
independent clinical and radiological assessment. The test is not intended as a
screening or stand-alone diagnostic assay.
PRECAUTION: Lumipulse G ROMA should not be used without an independent
clinical /radiological evaluation and is not intended to be a screening test or to
determine whether a patient should proceed to surgery. Incorrect use of
Lumipulse G ROMA carries the risk of unnecessary testing, surgery, and/or
delayed diagnosis.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
LUMIPULSE G1200 system
I. Device Description:
Lumipulse G ROMA is a qualitative serum and plasma test that combines the results
of two analytes, HE4 (Lumipulse G HE4) and CA125 (Lumipulse G CA 125 II) and
menopausal status into a numerical score between 0.00 and 10.00. The
premenopausal or postmenopausal status must be based on ovarian function
determined with information available from clinical evaluation and medical history.
The test system consists of Lumipulse G HE4, Lumipulse G CA 125 II, the
Lumipulse G ROMA Calculator Tool and the LUMIPULSE G1200 System. The
LUMIPULSE G1200 System is not capable of calculating the ROMA score. The
immunoassays are performed according to the directions detailed in each product
insert.

Both Lumipulse G HE4 and Lumipulse G CA 125 II are previously 510(k) cleared
Class II devices (K151378 and K142895 respectively). The Lumipulse G HE4 assay
is a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) for the quantitative
determination of HE4 antigen in human serum and plasma (lithium heparin or
dipotassium EDTA) on the LUMIPULSE G System. The assay is to be used as an
aid in monitoring recurrence or progressive disease in patients with epithelial ovarian
cancer. Serial testing for patient HE4 assay values should be used in conjunction
with other clinical methods used for monitoring ovarian cancer. Lumipulse G CA
125 II assay is a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) for the
quantitative determination of CA125 in human serum and plasma (sodium heparin,
lithium heparin, or dipotassium EDTA) on the LUMIPULSE G System. The assay is
to be used as an aid in monitoring recurrence or progressive disease in patients with
ovarian cancer. Serial testing for patient CA125 assay values should be used in
conjunction with other clinical methods used for monitoring ovarian cancer.
Lumipulse G ROMA scores (numerical score from 0.00–10.00) for both
premenopausal and postmenopausal women are calculated using the Lumipulse G
ROMA Calculator Tool to indicate a low likelihood or high likelihood for finding
malignancy on surgery using the value of the two immunoassays (Lumipulse G HE4
and Lumipulse G CA125II).

Adnexal Mass Assessment Score Test System
L. Test Principle:
Lumipulse G HE4 is an assay system, including a set of immunoassay reagents, for
the quantitative measurement of HE4 in specimens based on CLEA technology by a
two-step sandwich immunoassay method on the LUMIPULSE G1200 System. HE4
in specimens specifically binds to anti-HE4 monoclonal antibody (mouse) on the
particles, and antigen-antibody immunocomplexes are formed. The particles are
washed and rinsed to remove unbound materials. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP: calf)-
labeled anti-HE4 monoclonal antibody (mouse) specifically binds to HE4 of the
immunocomplexes on the particles, and additional immunocomplexes are formed.
The particles are washed and rinsed to remove unbound materials. Substrate Solution
is added and mixed with the particles. AMPPD contained in the Substrate Solution is
dephosphorylated by the catalysis of ALP indirectly conjugated to particles.
Luminescence (at a maximum wavelength of 477 nm) is generated by the cleavage
reaction of dephosphorylated AMPPD. The luminescent signal reflects the amount of
HE4.
Lumipulse G CA125II is an assay system, including a set of immunoassay reagents,
for the quantitative measurement of CA125 in specimens based on CLEA technology
by a two-step sandwich immunoassay method on the LUMIPULSE G System.
CA125 in specimens specifically binds to anti-CA125 monoclonal antibody (mouse)
on the particles, and antigen-antibody immunocomplexes are formed. The particles
are washed and rinsed to remove unbound materials. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP:
calf)-labeled anti-CA125 monoclonal antibody (mouse) specifically binds to CA125
of the immunocomplexes on the particles, and additional immunocomplexes are
formed. The particles are washed and rinsed to remove unbound materials. Substrate
Solution is added and mixed with the particles. AMPPD contained in the Substrate
Solution is dephosphorylated by the catalysis of ALP indirectly conjugated to
particles. Luminescence (at a maximum wavelength of 477 nm) is generated by the
cleavage reaction of dephosphorylated AMPPD. The luminescent signal reflects the
amount of CA125.
The Lumipulse G ROMA Calculator Tool will be used for calculating the ROMA
score. Using the value of the two analytes, Lumipulse G ROMA scores (numerical
score from 0.00–10.00) for both premenopausal and postmenopausal will be
calculated and will indicate whether a woman is at low likelihood or high likelihood
for finding malignancy on surgery. Both premenopausal and postmenopausal
Lumipulse G ROMA results will be reported to the ordering physician who will
decide which result to use based on patient's menopausal status.

M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
Both Lumipulse G HE4 and Lumipulse G CA 125 II are previously cleared
devices. Analytical performance for Lumipulse G HE4 and Lumipulse G CA 125
II were validated in K151378 and K142895, respectively. There has been no
modification of assay methods for Lumipulse G HE4 and Lumipulse G CA 125 II
since the original clearance for each assay. Thus, a limited study was done to
evaluate the analytical performance of the Lumipulse G ROMA.
All studies were performed on the Lumipulse G1200 instrument.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Total Imprecision:
A panel of five serum samples were tested using one lot each of Lumipulse G
HE4 and Lumipulse G CA 125 II reagents and calibrator kits according to
each assay’s package insert. The panel consisted of four pooled human serum
samples and one sample that contained 55% native HE4 and 45% spiked HE
antigen (panel 5).
Total imprecision was calculated at one site by testing each sample in two
runs with two replicates per run for 20 non-consecutive days (n = 80 replicates
per sample). The overall study was performed based on CLSI guideline
EP05-A3.
The following table displays the results for the repeatability and with-in
laboratory reproducibility. All data met the manufacturer’s predetermined
acceptance criteria.

Simulation precision:
In order to demonstrate the effect on precision of all possible combinations of
precision of the two analytes, a simulation precision study for Lumipulse G
ROMA score was conducted based on the precision profiles of HE4 and CA
125 with different combinations of values of these two analytes. The
statistical analysis of simulation of Lumipulse G ROMA score precision
showed acceptable precision covering the range of Lumipulse G ROMA score
from 0–10.

Calibrators and Controls:
Each assay uses its own calibrator and controls.
Lumipulse G CA125II Calibrators
The Lumipulse G CA125II Calibrators are for the use in the calibration of the
LUMIPULSE G System for the quantitative measurement of CA125 in serum
or plasma (sodium heparin, lithium heparin, and dipotassium EDTA). The
OC125 defined antigen is used in the LUMIPULSE G CA125II Calibrators.
This material is obtained from Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc. proprietary human
ovarian carcinoma cell line.
Lumipulse G HE4 Calibrators
The Lumipulse G HE4 Calibrators are for the use in the calibration of the
LUMIPULSE G System for the quantitative measurement of HE4 in serum or
plasma (lithium heparin and dipotassium EDTA). The HE4 antigen is used in
the Lumipulse G HE4 Calibrators. This material is provided by Fujirebio
Diagnostics, AB. The Lumipulse G HE4 assay is standardized against the
Fujirebio Diagnostics HE4 EIA.
Stability:
Sample Stability: Lumipulse G ROMA is intended for use with serum and
plasma (lithium heparin and dipotassium EDTA). The specimen stability and
storage claims are limited to the Lumipulse G HE4 assay. Samples can be
stored at 2–8°C for 3 days or at −10°C or colder for up to 1 month before
being tested.
Calibration Curve: For Lumipulse G HE4 and Lumipulse G CA125II, the
calibration curve is stable up to 30 days.
Reagent Stability: Users are instructed to refer to the individual stability
information in the package insert of each assay.
Lumipulse G HE4 is stable when stored at 2–10°C until the expiration date

stated on the label outside of the kit box. The current shelf life of Lumipulse
G HE4 is 8 months.
Lumipulse G CA125II is table when stored at 2–10°C until the expiration date
stated on the label outside of the kit box. The current shelf life of Lumipulse
G CA125II is 10 months.
d. Detection limit:
The limits of detection and limits of quantitation reported in each assay’s
package insert are incorporated into the algorithm such that results outside of
the measuring interval are not imported into the algorithm and do not yield a
Lumipulse G ROMA score.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference: Studies were conducted to evaluate the interference of
Lumipulse G ROMA score by endogenous substances. CLSI guideline,
EP07-A2 “Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry, Approved Guideline –
Second Edition”, was used to design the interference experiments.
Five patient samples with Lumipulse G ROMA scores across the measuring
range (0.55–9.86) were tested in this study. These samples were then
supplemented with each interfering substance. The control samples were
prepared without corresponding interfering substance. The control samples
and test samples were tested in replicates of three using Lumipulse G ROMA.
The Lumipulse G ROMA score was calculated for each sample and its control
sample using a mean of three replicates of Lumipulse G HE4 and the mean of
three replicates of Lumipulse G CA 125II. The effect of each interfering
substance on the Lumipulse G ROMA score was assessed by comparing the
measurement of each test sample to the control. The summary of the results
are shown in the following table, and all data met the manufacturer’s
predetermined acceptance criteria.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 168 samples were used for the method comparison study. The
enrolled patients consist of 150 diseased patients and 38 apparently healthy
women. 53 of the samples were from premenopausal women, and 115 of the
samples were from postmenopausal women. The premenopausal ROMA
range for the samples was 0.3–10.0 and for the postmenopausal samples was
0.5–10.0. No samples were excluded from the data analyses. Data analysis
was performed using Deming and Passing-Bablok regression analysis and all
data met the manufacturer’s predetermined acceptance criteria. The results
are summarized in the following table:

b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix Comparison Study:
A matrix comparison study was performed to compare the results of
Lumipulse G ROMA in serum and K -EDTA plasma. 86 matched serum and
2
K -EDTA plasma samples were spiked with recombinant HE4 and CA 125 to
2
cover the analytical measuring range of the device. The premenopausal
ROMA range for the samples was 0.33–9.93 and for the postmenopausal
samples was 0.37–9.78. Data analysis was performed using Weighted

Simulated Matrix Comparison Study:
A simulation study was performed to evaluate the worst-case conditions
where both the Lumipulse G HE4 and Lumipulse G CA 125II results showed
the maximal matrix effects. The maximal matrix effects were calculated using
the data for the K -EDTA plasma and Li-Heparin plasma matrix comparisons
2
that were completed for Lumipulse G HE4 and Lumipulse G CA 125II in
K151378 and K142895, respectively. The results of the simulation study
were acceptable.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity/Clinical Specificity:
A clinical study was done to validate Lumipulse G ROMA in pre- and
postmenopausal women presenting to a generalist with an adnexal mass, for
whom a decision to undergo surgery has been made. The study enrolled 512
patients at the 13 study sites. The patients were female patients over 18,
presenting to a generalist at a general or specialty hospital with an ovarian
cyst or an adnexal mass (defined as a simple, complex or a solid
ovarian/pelvic mass) who were scheduled to undergo surgery. Blood samples
were collected from all patients and tested with Lumipulse G HE4 and
Lumipulse G CA 125II at Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc.
The Initial Cancer Risk Assessment (ICRA) and all clinical information
relating to the surgical procedures, including imaging reports and final
pathology reports, were collected. All patients underwent surgery and tissues
were examined by local pathologists. An independent pathologist reviewed

all imaging reports, case report forms and histopathology reports from each
patient’s institution pathologist, checking for discrepancies in the data. The
performance of standalone use of ICRA, standalone use of Lumipulse G
ROMA and adjunctive use of ICRA and Lumipulse G ROMA were evaluated
by comparing to histopathology results for detecting the presence of ovarian
malignancy.
Of the 512 patients, 53 patients were excluded from analysis. The most
common reason for exclusion was no surgery was performed to remove an
adnexal mass. 10 additional patients were excluded because there was not
enough sample available for testing, and one patient was excluded because the
Lumipulse G HE4 value was outside of the measuring range of the device. In
the final total of 450 evaluable patients, 244 (54%) were premenopausal and
206 (46%) were postmenopausal. All of the major racial groups were
represented with 84% White, 7% of Black, 3% Hispanic, 3% Asian, and 3%
of other ethnicity. The age range of the patients was 18–89 with a median age
of 49.
The statistics for the 450 enrolled subjects with pathology classification are
summarized in the following table:

The information provided by the Lumipulse G ROMA test should be used
only as an adjunctive test to complement, not replace, other diagnostic and
clinical procedures. The ability of Lumipulse G ROMA to contribute to the
ICRA was evaluated by comparing the sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) for standalone
use of Lumipulse G ROMA, and adjunctive use of ICRA and Lumipulse G
ROMA. The performance of Lumipulse G ROMA evaluated for diagnosis of
EOC including LMP are presented below.

The same information about the frequencies of malignancy is presented by the
likelihood ratios: Likelihood ratio (Result) = Pr(Result|Malignancy) /
Pr(Result|No Malignancy). Likelihood ratio is a way of quantifying how
much a given test result changes the pre-test probability of malignancy in a
patient.

The likelihood ratio for identifying malignancy by adjunctive use of
Lumipulse G ROMA and ICRA is 9.04, 2.0 times higher than the likelihood
ratio by ICRA alone (4.58).
The performance of adjunctive use of Lumipulse G ROMA and ICRA for
diagnosis of EOC including LMP was further evaluated by calculating
sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV compared to standalone use of ICRA.

With adjunctive use of ICRA and Lumipulse G ROMA for diagnosis of EOC
including LMP, sensitivity for malignancy increased from 84.1% to 92.1%.
Specificity for malignancy decreased from 75.5% to 65.7%. PPV for the
adjunctive use of ICRA and Lumipulse G ROMA decreased from 60.2% to
54.2% due to an increase in the number of false positive tests added by the
addition of Lumipulse G ROMA to ICRA. NPV of the adjunctive use of
ICRA and Lumipulse G ROMA increased from 91.5% to 94.9%. The
increase of NPV was 3.4% (95% CI 0.8%–6.8%) and was statistically
significant.

Association between the Lumipulse G ROMA Score and Likelihood of
Malignancy:
Summary statistics for the Lumipulse G ROMA scores, for subjects who had a
primary ovarian malignancy (EOC + LMP) are given by cancer stage in the
table below.

To demonstrate whether higher Lumipulse G ROMA is associated with an
increased likelihood of cancer, additional analysis was conducted by splitting
the patients at the cut-off point and finding the median Lumipulse G ROMA
score within each split giving two balanced groups below the cutoff and
additional groups above. The results are summarized below.

4. Clinical cut-off:
The following cut-offs are used to interpret the result. The Lumipulse G ROMA
score is between 0.0 and 10.0.
Premenopausal:
Lumipulse G ROMA score ≥ 1.31: High likelihood of finding malignancy
Lumipulse G ROMA score < 1.31: Low likelihood of finding malignancy
Postmenopausal:
Lumipulse G ROMA score ≥ 2.77: High likelihood of finding malignancy
Lumipulse G ROMA score < 2.77: Low likelihood of finding malignancy
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Expected values in Healthy Subjects:
In order to determine the normal reference ranges of the Lumipulse G ROMA
score in healthy women, 120 premenopausal samples and 118 postmenopausal
samples (total = 238 samples) were tested. Samples covered age ranging from 18
to 79 and represented whites (74.8%), African American (4.6%), Hispanic
(17.2%) and Asian (3.3%) subjects. The results for Lumipulse G ROMA score
obtained from the pre- and post-menopausal populations are presented below:

Overall, 95% of the premenopausal health female subjects had a Lumipulse G
ROMA score equal to or below 1.73. Ninety five percent of the postmenopausal
healthy female subjects had a Lumipulse G ROMA score equal to or below 2.03.
These values were chosen based on the 95th percentile of the population tested. It
is recommended that each laboratory established its own reference value for the
population of interest.
Expected values in Non-Ovarian Malignancy Conditions:
To evaluate the performance of Lumipulse G ROMA in subjects with other
benign and other malignant conditions, Lumipulse G ROMA was evaluated in
women with benign conditions (benign gynecological disease, congestive heart
failure (CHF), hypertension, pregnant, and other benign disease) and in women
with other malignant conditions (bladder cancer, breast cancer, endometrial
cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, and lung cancer). A total of 880 subjects were
analyzed. The tables below summarize the results analyzed for premenopausal
and postmenopausal samples.
