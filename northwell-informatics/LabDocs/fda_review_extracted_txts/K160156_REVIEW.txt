K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
No applicable standard was cited.
L. Test Principle:
The StatStrip Xpress Blood Glucose Monitoring System measures glucose levels using
disposable test strips and a handheld meter. The test strip contains a flow channel to draw
blood by capillary action into a biosensor measurement zone. The sensor comprises an
enzyme (Glucose oxidase) that oxidizes glucose present in the blood sample. The sensor also
contains an electron shuttle to re-generate, by oxidation, the active form of the enzyme. The
meter applies a low electrical voltage to the sensor electrodes and measures a change in
current caused by the electrochemical oxidation of the electron shuttle.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
This submission seeks an Over-The-Counter clearance and new trade name (StatStrip Xpress
Blood Glucose Monitoring System) for the previously cleared StatStrip Xpress Glucose
Hospital Meter System; k150461. The proposed device uses identical technology,
measurement algorithm, user workflow, test strips as the predicate, the StatStrip Glucose
Hospital Meter System (originally cleared in k060345 and modified in k063821, k070960,
k132121 and k150461). Bench studies to collect performance data relied on these previously
cleared devices, which are cited, as appropriate in each section.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run and intermediate precision were established in k060345.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity and reportable range were established in k060345.
The reportable range for the StatStrip Xpress Blood Glucose Monitoring System is 20
to 600 mg/dL.
Readings outside of reportable range:
Bench studies and software verification studies were provided to demonstrate that if a
glucose measurement is less than 20 mg/dL, the result is flagged and a ‘LO’ indicator
is displayed. If a glucose measurement exceeds 600 mg/dL, the result is flagged and
a ‘HI’ indicator is displayed.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
User performance study:
To assess the performance of the StatStrip Xpress Blood Glucose Monitoring System
in the hands of the intended users, a lay user study was conducted with 360 subjects.
Each participant self-tested their blood glucose level unassisted and was given only
the instructions and training materials routinely provided with the system. The blood
glucose results obtained from the fingerstick were compared to a reference method
(YSI 2300 STAT Plus Glucose & Lactate Analyzer). The range of glucose
concentrations across all subjects was 48 to 434 mg/dL according to the reference
method. The results from this study are summarized below:
Glucose concentrations < 75 mg/dL:
Within ± 5 Within ± 10 Within ± 15
mg/dL mg/dL mg/dL
6/14 (43%) 12/14 (86%) 14/14 (100%)
Glucose concentrations ≥ 75 mg/dL:
Within ± 5% Within ± 10% Within ± 15% Within ± 20%
110/346 (32%) 310/346 (90%) 338/346 (98%) 346/346 (100%)
The method accuracy was further analyzed by linear regression analysis. The results
are given below.

The normal fasting adult blood Glucose range for a person without diabetes is less
than 100 mg/dL. One to two hours after meals, normal blood Glucose levels should
be less than 140 mg/dL.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study: As established in k060345 to support the claimed hematocrit range of
20-65%.
2. Altitude study: As established in k060345. There is no significant affect of altitude up
to 15,000 feet (4500 meters) above sea level.
3. Temperature and Humidity Study: As established in k060345 to support the claimed
operating condition range of 59°F -104°F and 10-90% relative humidity. The meter
displays an error code and no result will be obtained when the meter is outside of this
temperature range.
4. Sample Volume Study: The sponsor performed a study to validate the test strip sample
volume requirement for the StatStrip Xpress Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Blood
glucose samples (71, 122, and 305 mg/dL) were tested at five sample volumes (0.9, 1.0,
1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 µL). The glucose concentrations were compared a reference method
(YSI 2300 STAT Plus Glucose & Lactate Analyzer). The sample volume study results
support the claimed sample volume of 1.2 µL and the error code for insufficient sample
volume.
5. Infection Control Studies: The StatStrip Xpress Blood Glucose Monitoring System is
intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed
(k100602 and k150461) on the external materials of the meter by an outside commercial
testing service and demonstrated complete inactivation of live Hepatitis B virus with
Clorox Germicidal Wipes, EPA registration # 67619-12. Robustness testing was
performed by the sponsor (k150461) demonstrating that there was no change in
performance or in the external materials of the meter after 10,950 cleaning and 10,950
disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting wipe) to
simulate 3 years of device use. The subject device labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

6. Electromagnetic Compatibility: The sponsor provided documentation certifying that
acceptable electromagnetic testing (EMC) had been performed and the StatStrip Xpress
Blood Glucose Monitoring System was found compliant (k070960).
7. Readability Evaluation: The readability of the Owner’s Manual, Test Strip package
insert, Control package insert, and Quick Reference Guide were evaluated using a Flesch-
Kincaid analysis and were found to be at an 8th grade reading level or less.
