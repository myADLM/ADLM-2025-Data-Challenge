BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B
(also referred to as the BD Veritor System and BD
Veritor System Flu A+B) is a differentiated test,
such that influenza A viral antigens can be
distinguished from influenza B viral antigens from a
single processed sample using a single device. The
test is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of
influenza A and B viral infections. A negative test is
presumptive and it is recommended that these
results be confirmed by viral culture or an FDA-
cleared influenza A and B molecular assay. Outside
the U.S., a negative test is presumptive and it is
recommended that these results be confirmed by
viral culture or a molecular assay cleared for
diagnostic use in the country of use. FDA has not
cleared this device for use outside of the U.S.
Negative test results do not preclude influenza
viral infection and should not be used as the sole
basis for treatment or other patient management
decisions. The test is not intended to detect influenza
C antigens.
Performance characteristics for influenza A and B
were established during January through March of
2011 when influenza viruses A/2009 H1N1, A/H3N2,
B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage were
the predominant influenza viruses in circulation
according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report from the CDC entitled "Update: Influenza
Activity-United States, 2010-2011 Season, and
Composition of the 2011-2012 Influenza Vaccine."
Performance characteristics may vary against other
emerging influenza viruses.
If infection with a novel influenza virus is suspected
based on current clinical and epidemiological
screening criteria recommended by public health
authorities, specimens should be collected with
appropriate infection control precautions for novel
virulent influenza viruses and sent to the state or local
health department for testing. Virus culture should not
be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility
is available to receive and culture specimens.

5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the
device and its components, and the results of the analysis.
The Risk Assessment process used was based on a BD Product Risk Management procedure,
which, according to the sponsor, meets the requirement for risk management as set forth in ISO
14971:2007 and EN ISO 14971:2012.
Using this procedure, the following characteristics were assessed and the results are presented
in Table 3 below:
• The Hazard,
• The Adverse Effect (Harm to Patient),
• The Potential Causes of the Hazard,
• The probability of Hazard Severity and
• The probability of Occurrence

b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities
required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.
The risk assessment identified the need to confirm the Veritor System’s reactivity to the
CDC H5Nx Virus Panel provided as part of the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP)
Framework and to add the results to a package insert available to the public.
In order to demonstrate reactivity with the A/H5 viruses and present the data in a revised
Package Insert, a reactivity study was conducted. The study acceptance criterion was a positive
instrument read with samples of the subject influenza viruses when tested by the BD VeritorTM Flu
A+B CLIA Waived kit assay.
The lowest concentrations of influenza A/H5 viruses that were detected by the VeritorTM System
Flu A+B assay are listed in Table 1. The strain reactivity data provided above and proposed for
inclusion into the PI demonstrate that all strains tested met the acceptance criteria.
The studies conducted on the BD Veritor™ System Flu A+B assay support the proposed labeling
changes to reflect the analytical reactivity data generated. This data will be used to update the strain
reactivity section of the product insert.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use
for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular
modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices
demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the
design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the
device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
