L. Test Principle:
The VivaChek Ino Blood Glucose Monitoring System is designed to quantitatively measure
the glucose concentration in fresh capillary whole blood. The glucose measurement is
achieved by using the amperometric detection method. The test is based on measurement of
electrical current caused by the reaction of the glucose with the reagents on the electrode of
the test strip. The blood sample is pulled into the tip of the test strip through capillary action.
Glucose in the sample reacts with glucose enzyme and the mediator. Electrons are
generated, producing a current that is correlated to the glucose concentration in the sample.
After the reaction time, the glucose concentration in the sample is displayed. The meter is
calibrated to display plasma-like concentration results.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed using venous whole blood samples. Samples with the
following glucose concentrations were prepared and confirmed by a laboratory
reference method (YSI): 8, 25, 50, 80, 110, 170, 220, 330, 450, 550, 650 mg/dL. Each
sample was measured in replicates of four using each of three lots of test strips (2
replicates/meter, 2 meters) and the mean was used in the regression analysis. The
regression analysis results are summarized in the below table:
Lot Slope y-intercept R2
1 0.9972 -0.9718 0.9989
2 0.9994 -1.5257 0.9991
3 1.0011 -0.1571 0.9988
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 20
– 600 mg/dL. Data from bench studies and software verification studies were
provided to demonstrate that if a sample is less than 20 mg/dL, the result is flagged
by the meter as LO. If a sample result exceeds 600 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the
meter as HI.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The system is traceable to NIST SRM #917b reference material. A method
comparison was performed using the candidate device and YSI as the reference
method. The meter provides plasma-equivalent results.
Test Strip Stability
Accelerated and Real time stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed
and found acceptable to support the 24 month shelf life and 4 month open vial stability
for test strips (Canister and Pouch) stored at temperatures of 41oF to 86oF (5oC-30oC) and
10-90% RH.

d. Detection limit:
The reportable range for the VivaChek™ Ino Blood Glucose Monitoring System is 20
to 600 mg/dL supported by the linearity assay study above (M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
To assess potential interference the sponsor used venous whole blood samples adjusted to
3 glucose concentrations of 50, 100, and 350 mg/dL. Each of these samples was divided
into a test pool and a control pool, with each of the potential endogenous and exogenous
interfering substances added to the test pool. Each substance was tested at a minimum of
two concentrations, normal/therapeutic and high/toxic concentrations following EP7-A2
recommendations. The % difference between the test sample and the control sample was
calculated using mean of 10 replicates for each of the 3 strip lots tested. The sponsor
defines no significant interference as ≤ ±10 % difference relative to the control sample.
Results are presented in the table below:

displayed is equivalent to the glucose level in a plasma sample. Calibration is automatic.
There is no user input for coding.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at 3 different concentration ranges (Level 1, Level 2, and Level
3) can be used with this device. Recommendations on when to test the control materials
are provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the
test strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter and to contact customer
support if the control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study:
To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the VivaChek Ino Blood Glucose Monitoring
System, venous blood samples with hematocrit levels of 20%, 30%, 42%, 55%, and
70% were tested at 3 glucose concentrations (40, 110, and 350 mg/dL). Each sample
was tested in replicates of 10/strip lot, with a total 3 lots of testes strips tested.
Results from the meter were compared to results obtained using a laboratory-based
reference method (YSI). The evaluation of percent bias relative to YSI demonstrated
acceptable performance across the hematocrit range of 20-70%.
2. Altitude study:
To evaluate the effect of altitude on the VivaChek Ino Blood Glucose Monitoring
System, meters were tested at 2 altitudes locations sea level and 9777 feet. Fingertip

capillary blood samples from 15 subjects were tested at each altitude. The evaluation
included 2 meters and 3 test strip lots. The glucose range tested was 43 to 482 mg/dl
at sea level; 46-470 mg/dl at 9777 feet. Results at each altitude were compared to the
comparator method, YSI. Results demonstrated that altitudes up to 9,777 feet above
sea level have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements from the
candidate device.
3. Sample Volume:
The sponsor performed a study to verify the test strip minimum sample volume
requirement and the test strip fill error requirement established for the VivaChek Ino
Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Blood samples were tested at 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9
and 1.0µL of venous whole blood samples at glucose concentrations of 50, 100, 280,
and 500 mg/dL. Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.8µL.
Adequate validation was provided to support the fill error feature that is displayed
when too little blood is applied to the test strip.
4. Operating Conditions Study:
Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated for temperatures
ranging from 41°F to 113°F (5°C to 45°C) and relative humidity between 10 and 90%
R.H. including extreme combinations of temperature and humidity, including lowest
humidity with lowest and highest temperature and highest humidity with lowest and
highest temperature. Meter results were compared to YSI values. Results support the
claimed operating conditions of 41°F to 113°F (5°C to 45°C) and relative humidity
between 10 and 90% R.H.
5. EMC Testing:
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic
testing (EMC) had been performed.
6. Software documentation:
The software documentation was reviewed and found to be acceptable. The firm
provided documentation to support the device was designed, developed and is under
good software lifecycle processes.
7. Infection Control Studies:
The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy
studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside
commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B
virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Clorox Germicidal Wipes, 0.55% sodium
hypochlorite (EPA Registration # 67619-12). Robustness studies were also
performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or
external materials of the meter after 608 cleanings and disinfection cycles with the
Clorox Germicidal Wipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 5 years
of single-patient use for the meter to be cleaned and disinfected at least once a week.
Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and
disinfection procedures.

prescription use blood glucose monitoring systems (BGMS) and over-the-counter use
blood glucose monitoring systems (SMBG). However, the recommendations in the
guidance documents were not followed for this device since the submission was
received prior to the finalization of the guidance documents.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
