L. Test Principle:
The Trinidad CH Vancomycin (Vanc) assay is based on a homogeneous particle
enhanced turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay (PETINIA) technique which uses a
synthetic particle-vancomycin conjugate (PR) and monoclonal vancomycin specific
antibody (Ab). Vancomycin present in the sample competes with vancomycin on the
particles for available antibody, thereby decreasing the rate of aggregation. Hence, the
rate of aggregation is inversely proportional to the concentration of vancomycin in the
sample. The rate of aggregation is measured using bichromatic turbidimetric readings
at 545 nm and 694 nm.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated with 10 samples which spanned the assay measuring
interval (0.9, 3.0, 7.2, 13.5, 19.7, 26.0, 32.3, 38.6, 44.8, 51.1 μg/mL). Each was
prepared by mixing high and low concentration samples across the
measurement interval as described in CLSI EP06-A. The high sample was
prepared by spiking native serum with purified Vancomycin Hydrochloride.
The low sample was normal human serum with low level of Vancomycin. Six
replicates were measured for each sample. The mean of these replicates was
used for the regression analysis.
The result of the liner regression is:
y=1.009x-0.16545, r=1.02
The results support the claimed measuring range of 3.0-50 μg/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The Trinidad CH Drug 3 Calibrator is traceable to USP Vancomycin.
Calibrator Stability
Protocols and acceptance criteria for the stability studies were reviewed and
found acceptable. The real-time study results support open-vial/on board
stability of 15 days at 2-8°C. Real time closed-vial stability studies are ongoing
to support a shelf-life of 12 months or longer at 2-8°C.
Expected Values
Value assignment for Trinidad CH Drug 3 Calibrators will be conducted as for
the predicate device cleared in K033809.

d. Detection limits:
Analytical sensitivities were determined following EP17-A2 using the
nonparametric approach.
To determine LoB, 4 analyte-free samples (bovine serum base) were
tested in replicate of 5 per run, with one run per day for 3 days, for a total of 60
measurements using each reagent lot (3 reagent lots were tested). The sponsor
defined LoB as the concentration below which analyte-free samples could be
found with a probability of 95%.
To determine LoD, 4 serum samples with low-analyte concentrations (0.1-0.3
μg/mL) were tested in replicate of 5 per run, with one run per day for 3 days,
for a total of 60 measurements using each reagent lot (3 reagent lots were
tested).The sponsor defined LoD as the lowest analyte concentration which
could be detected, with a value above the LoB, with a probability of 95%.
To verify the claimed LoQ of 3.0 μg/mL, 4 serum samples with Vacomycine
concentration of 2.5 μg/mL were tested using three reagent lots for three days,
on one instrument for a total of 180 measurements. The acceptance criteria for
LoQ were that the total error at the tested analyte concentration should be less
than 20%.
The results are summarized in the table below and support the claimed LoB,
LoD and LoQ.
LoB (μg/mL) LoD (μg/mL) LoQ (μg/mL)
Lot 1 0.1 0.16 2.51
Lot 2 -0.1 0.17 2.37
Lot 3 0.1 0.19 2.77
Claimed 0.1 0.2 3.0
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference
The sponsor tested the effects of common endogenous substances and
therapeutic compounds using human serum pools at both low (10μg/mL) and
high (40µg/mL) Vancomycin levels. The % difference between the test sample
and the control sample was calculated. The sponsor defined no significant
interference as within a ±10% difference relative to the control sample.
No interference was detected for hemolysis, icterus and lipemia at the following
concentrations: Hemoglobin 600 mg/dL, Conjugated Bilirubin 20 mg/dL,
Unconjugated Bilirubin 20 mg/dL, Lipemia (Intralipid) 1000 mg/dL.
No interference was detected from the following therapeutic and endogenous
substances at the indicated concentrations:

In the labeling, the sponsor states:
A number of substances cause physiological changes in serum or plasma analyte
concentrations. A comprehensive discussion of possible interfering substances,
their serum or plasma concentrations, and their possible physiological
involvements is beyond the scope of this document. Consult the listed reference
for specific details on known potential interfering substances.6
As with any chemical reaction, you must be alert to the possible effect on results
of unknown interferences from medications or endogenous substances. The
laboratory and physician must evaluate all patient results in light of the total
clinical status of the patient.
Vancomycin crystalline degradation product (CDP-1) at 20 μg/mL CDP-1
demonstrates cross-reactivity at 0 and 10 μg/mL Vanc of 21.0% and 19.1%
respectively.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor tested 100 human serum samples (98 were native, 2 were altered) from
patients taking Vancomycin, ranging in concentration from 4.4 to 48.1 µg/mL. The
samples were tested in singlicate using the candidate and predicate device and
analyzed using Passing Bablok regression which yielded the following regression
equation: y = 1.04x -1.04, r = 0.997.
b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study between serum and Lithium-Heparin plasma was
performed using 60 matched samples with Vancomycin concentrations from 4.0 to
43.3 µg/mL. The equation produced from linear regression analysis was:
y=1.00x+0.49, r=0.990
3. Clinical studies:

b. Clinical specificity:

--- Page 10 ---
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
In the labeling, the sponsor states:
The therapeutic intervals are cited from the literature 1,2:
There is great disparity in vancomycin therapeutic intervals, especially with peak
therapeutic intervals. Factors that might affect peak therapeutic ranges include dosage
regimen and timing of sample collection.
Vancomycin levels in renal dialysis patients, burn patients and intravenous drug
abusers should be closely monitored.
Peak Intervals: Samples from adult volunteers drawn two hours after the completion of
a 60 minute infusion of vancomycin ranged from 18 – 26 μg/mL. Samples drawn one
hour after the completion of a 60 minute vancomycin infusion ranged from 25 – 40 μg
/mL. Samples drawn 30 minutes after the completion of a 60 minute infusion of
vancomycin ranged from 30 – 40 μg/mL.
Trough Intervals: Samples should be drawn just before the next dose. A trough interval of
5–10 μg/mL (3.5–6.9 μmol/L) is generally considered to be effective; however,
therapeutic levels should be established based on individual patient differences, clinical
assessment, and bacterial susceptibility.
As with all in vitro diagnostic assays, each laboratory should determine its own reference
intervals for the diagnostic evaluation of patient results. Consider these values as a
guideline only.
