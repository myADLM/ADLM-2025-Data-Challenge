I. Device Description:
The GEM Premier 5000 system contains two key components: the GEM Premier 5000
analyzer and the GEM Premier 5000 PAK (cartridge). The GEM Premier 5000 PAK
contains reagents, sensors, optical cell for Co-Ox and total bilirubin, sampler and waste bag.
It enables analysis of 75 to 600 samples per cartridge. There are five process control
solutions (A, B, C, D and E), one reference electrode solution and one lysing solution in each
GEM Premier 5000 PAK. The five process control solutions are utilized each day at
different frequencies to confirm sensor, CO‐Ox and PAK performance.
The target values of the Process Control Solutions are stated in the following table:
Analyte Units A B C D E
Na+ mmol/L 105 155 N/A 166 129

L. Test Principle:
The electrolyte sensors (Na+, K+, Cl‐ and Ca++) are polyvinyl chloride (PVC) based ion
selective electrodes consisting of an internal Ag/AgCl reference electrode and an internal
electrolyte layer. Their potentials are measured against the card reference electrode
(Ag/Ag+). The electrolyte sensors are based on the principle of ion selective electrodes; in
which electrical potential can be established across a membrane resulting from chemical
selectivity of the membrane to a specific ion. The electrical potential is proportional to the
logarithm of the analyte activity in the sample, and the concentration of the desired ions is
calculated using Nernst equation.

* The day-to-day contribution was excluded in total precision evaluation for whole
blood samples since different whole blood samples were prepared each day.
** The candidate device is not intended for the measurement of K and Cl in capillary
samples; therefore, only data from syringe samples tested under normal mode for K
and Cl are shown in the table.
External Precision Studies:
3) A reproducibility study was performed at 3 external clinical point-of-care (POC)
sites in hospital settings. The studies were run by a total of 9 different operators
(perfusionists and respiratory therapists) on 3 different GEM Premier 5000
instruments using a single lot of GEM Premier 5000 PAK (cartridge). Each site
used the same lots of GEM System Evaluator (GSE) 1, 2 and 3, running each
control level in triplicate, twice a day for 5 days, for a total of 30 replicates per
level per site. The pooled repeatability and reproducibility results for these 3
POC sites are summarized below:

4) To evaluate whole blood imprecision on the new GEM Premier 5000 system in
the central laboratory and point-of-care (POC) sites in hospital settings, whole
blood patient samples were tested at 2 external central laboratories and 1 internal
Customer Simulation Laboratory, as well as at 3 external POC locations. For the
central laboratory setting, the studies were performed by 3 operators on 3 GEM
Premier 5000 instruments using a single lot of GEM Premier 5000 PAK
(cartridge). For the POC Setting, the studies were performed by 11 operators on 3
GEM Premier 5000 instruments, using a single lot of GEM Premier 5000 PAK
(cartridge). At least two whole blood specimens were analyzed in triplicate daily
for 5 days in both normal mode (150 μL) for all 4 electrolytes, and micro capillary
(65 μL) mode for Na and Ca. Due to the use of unique whole blood samples at
each clinical site, only repeatability can be evaluated. Reproducibility was not
assessed for the whole blood samples. At the internal Customer Simulation
Laboratory (CSL), contrived whole blood specimens were analyzed in addition to
native specimens in order to cover the low and high medical decision levels of
each analyte.

*The candidate device is not intended for the measurement of K and Cl in
capillary samples; therefore, only data from syringe samples tested under normal
mode for K and Cl are shown in the table.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity studies were performed followed the CLSI EP06-A guidance. For the
electrolytes, nine to ten equally spaced samples covering the measurement range were
prepared by diluting high concentration lithium heparin whole blood samples. Three
replicates were measured on three (3) GEM Premier 5000 analyzers for each sample.
The mean of these replicates was compared to those obtained on the reference
analyzers. The linear regression results support the claimed measuring ranges, as
summarized in the table below:
Analyte Claimed Sample Range Slope Intercept γ2
Measuring Tested (mmol/L)
Range (mmol/L)
Na+ 100 to 180 85 to 214 0.972 5.377 0.999
K+ 1.0 to 19.0 0.7 to 21.9 0.993 -0.072 0.999
Cl- 40 to 158 35 to 189 0.964 2.805 1.000
Ca++ 0.11 to 4.25 0.10 to 5.05 0.999 0.011 0.999
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The GEM Premier 5000 Na+ measurement is traceable to a flame emission
spectrophotometry reference method, which uses secondary standards prepared from
NaCl, NIST #919.
The GEM Premier 5000 K+ measurement is traceable to a flame emission
spectrophotometry reference method, which uses secondary standards prepared from
KCl, NIST #918.
The GEM Premier 5000 Cl- measurement is traceable to a coulometric‐amperometric
titration with silver ion using secondary standards prepared from NaCl, NIST #919.
The GEM Premier 5000 Ca++ measurement is traceable to a direct potentiometry
using secondary standards prepared from calcium carbonate, NIST #915.
Stability
Since there is no change in the formulation for CVP 5 tBili, GEM System Evaluator
(1, 2, 3) or GEM Hematocrit Evaluator (1, 2, 3), the shelf‐life and stability data from
their original 510(k) filings (k112995 and k093623) are still valid.
Shelf life stability studies were performed with GEM Premier 5000 PAKs (cartridges)

and demonstrated that they are stable for 180 days when stored in the claimed range
of 15‐25°C. The GEM Premier 5000 PAKs are stable for 31 days or for 600-sample
use on board. The protocols for stability and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
found to be adequate.
Value assignment
The value assignment procedures for GEM System Evaluator, GEM Hematocrit
Evaluator and GEM CVP 5 tBili are the same as those in original 510(k) filings
(k112995 and k093623) except adding in GEM Premier 5000.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification
(LoQ) were evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2 Guideline.
Samples tested were all lithium heparin whole blood samples. LoB was determined
by running three blank samples in 60 replicates per day over 3 days using 3 lots of
GEM Premier 5000 PAKs (cartridges) on 3 different GEM Premier 5000 instruments.
LoD and LoQ were determined by running low level samples in 60 replicates per day
over 3 days using 3 lots of GEM Premier 5000 PAKs (cartridges) on 3 different GEM
Premier 5000 instruments. LoD is calculated based on LoB (mean) + 1.65 SD (low
sample). LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration at which measured total error
is less than the pre-defined total error. The results are summarized in the table below:
Analyte LoB (mmol/L) LoD (mmol/L) LoQ (mmol/L)
Na+ 11 13 97
K+ 0.0 0.1 0.9
Cl- 5 7 38
Ca++ 0.00 0.02 0.08
The claimed measuring range of the assays is summarized in the tables below:
Analyte Claimed Measuring Range (mmol/L)
Na+ 100 to 180
K+ 1.0 to 19.0
Cl- 40 to 158
Ca++ 0.11 to 4.25
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP-7A guidance to determine
the effects from potential interferents on the electrolyte assays. Various
concentrations of interferents were spiked into two levels (low and high) of each
analyte. Testing was performed in singlet per level using 3 GEM Premier 5000
analyzers. The sponsor ‘s definition of a non-significant interference for each analyte

Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Manual entry or barcode identification
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The following types of sampling devices are acceptable to GEM Premier 5000:
• syringe (lithium heparin only) for arterial, venous, and mixed-venous
• capillary tube (lithium heparin only)
• opened ampoules
• uncapped collection tubes using the syringe or ampoule sampling position
5. Calibration:
The iQM2 technology in GEM Premier 5000 provides active process control that
monitors and maintains the stability of calibration during GEM PAK use-life. The iQM2
technology monitors and controls the GEM PAK using 5 PC Solutions analyzed at
different intervals and after every patient sample. Difference between the observed values
for PC Solutions and the target values are compared to control limits (drift limits).
• When the observed PC Solution A, B and C values are within established control
18

--- Page 19 ---
limits, the active process control technology re-establishes the target value for PC
Solutions A, B or C to maintain the stability of the measurement process.
• Any PC Solution A, B and C value that exceeds the established statistical control
limits for an analyte leads to further assessment via PR (Pattern Recognition)
software which may include corrective actions based upon pattern detection
algorithms.
• iQM2 control mechanism is predicated on the stability of the PC Solutions, which are
monitored via the iQM2 PC Stability Check.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor states on their labeling that “Intelligent Quality Management 2 (iQM2) is
used as the quality control and assessment system for the GEM Premier 5000 system.
iQM2 is an active quality process control program designed to provide continuous
monitoring of the analytical process before, during, and after sample measurement with
real-time, automatic error detection, automatic correction of the system and automatic
documentation of all corrective actions, replacing the use of traditional external quality
controls (QC). Facilities should follow local, state and federal regulatory guidelines to
ensure that a total quality management system is followed.”
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not Applicable
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
