L. Test Principle:
The SD LipidoCare System combines enzymatic methodology and solid-phase technology to
measure total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. A capillary whole blood
sample is applied to an SD LipidoCare test strip. The test strip is then placed into the SD
LipidoCare Analyzer, where a unique system on the test strip separates the plasma from the
blood cells. A portion of the sample flows to the bottom layer of the test strip and is
transferred to the total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol reaction pads. The
LipidoCare analyzer measures TC, TG, and HDL by an enzymatic method which causes a
color change in the test area of the strip. The color changes are proportional to the lipid
concentration in the sample. LDL value is calculated from TC, HDL and TG values using
the numerical formula LDL=TC-HDL-(TG/5). Calculated LDL-cholesterol values are
reported only when triglycerides are ≤400 mg/dL; when triglycerides are > 400 mg/dL, the
calculated LDL-cholesterol is not reported.
The SD LipidoCare Blood Glucose Test Systems quantitatively measure glucose in a
capillary whole blood sample by detecting a small electrical current that results from a
chemical reaction of glucose in the blood with glucose oxidase present on the glucose test
strip. The amount of current created depends on how much glucose is in the blood. The
resulting current is converted to a blood glucose value for display to the user.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The four systems are identical except for the device name and Bluetooth technology present
in the two ‘BT’ versions (SD LipidoCare BT Home/BT Professional Systems); therefore only
one set of performance data is presented below, which is representative of the performance of
each of the four systems.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Lipid Profile:
Linearity was evaluated by diluting a venous Na-heparin whole blood sample with
high concentrations of each analyte (Total Cholesterol, Triglycerides, and HDL) with
a venous Na-heparin whole blood sample containing low concentrations of each
analyte to obtain 9 intermediate dilution samples (TC 90-460 mg/dL, TG 35- 720
mg/dL, and HDL 22-100 mg/dL). Each sample was run in replicates of 5 on the
candidate device. Each result obtained by the candidate device was compared to the
expected value for each level. The resulting linear regression equations for each
analyte are presented below:
Total Cholesterol: y = 0.9904 x – 3.8170, R2 = 0.997

Glucose test:
Linearity was evaluated by diluting a venous whole blood sample with a high
concentration of glucose with a venous whole blood sample with a low concentration
of glucose. The resulting glucose concentrations as determined by YSI comparator
method were: 16.1, 23.7, 56.6, 86.5, 156.3, 227.5, 300.3, 363.8, 435.0, 508.8, 572.8,
645.0, and 725.0 mg/dL. Each sample was run in replicates of 5 on the candidate
device and compared to the results from the comparator analyzer. The resulting
linear regression equations for Glucose are presented below:
Lot 1: y = 1.005x - 0.6884, R2 = 0.999
Lot 2: y = 1.000x + 0.014, R2 = 0.999

Triglycerides: 45-650 mg/dL
HDL: 25-95 mg/dL
Glucose: 20-600 mg/dL
The meter will display “LO” when the results are below the measuring range for each
analyte and will display “HI” when the results are above the measuring range for each
analyte. The sponsor validated the “LO” and “HI” functions and demonstrated that
they functioned as intended.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The SD LipidoCare Total Cholesterol is traceable to the primary reference
measurement procedure, Proton NMR spectroscopy using the NIST standardized
reference material, SRM 911c.
The SD LipidoCare Triglyceride and HDL test system is traceable to the glycerol
kinase-pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase UV method using the primary
calibrator, COA of JCCRM 224-6.
The SD LipidoCare Total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol test systems were certified
by the Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network (CRMLN) as meeting the
National Cholesterol Education Program’s (NCEP) performance criteria for accuracy
and precision in capillary whole blood samples.
The SD LipidoCare Glucose test system is traceable to the NIST certified reference
material, SRM 917c. Method comparison performance demonstrated accuracy to YSI
2300 analyzer.

Stability:
The stability study protocols and acceptance criteria for the LipidoCare Test Strips for
all the analytes measured (total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol, and
glucose) were reviewed and found to be acceptable to support the sponsor’s labeled
stability claims:
SD LipidoCare Lipid Profile Test Strips are stable for 18 months unopened when
stored at 36-90oF (2-32oC) and 10-90% relative humidity. Each Lipid Profile Test
Strip is individually wrapped with a desiccant pack and the labeling indicates to
perform the testing immediately after opening.
The SD LipidoCare Glucose test strips are stable for 24 months when stored
unopened at 36-90oF (2-32oC) and 10-90% relative humidity. Each Glucose Test
Strip is individually wrapped with a desiccant pack and the labeling indicates to
perform the testing immediately after opening.
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit studies for the Total Cholesterol, Triglyceride, and HDL analytes
were performed in accordance to CLSI EP17-A2 using two SD LipidoCare Analyzers
and two lots of SD LipidoCare Lipid Profile Test Strips.
The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined for TC, TG, and HDL by testing in vitro
blank serum samples not containing the analyte being measured. Each sample was
assayed in two runs over 15 days using two analyzers with two test strip lots (one lot
per analyzer) for a total of 60 measurements. The following equation was used to
determine the LoB for each analyte: LoB= mean + 1.645 (SD ).
blank blank
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined for TC, TG, and HDL by measuring 4
low levels of venous NaHep whole blood samples for each analyte in two runs over
15 days using two analyzers with two test strip lots (one per analyzer) to give a total
of 60 measurements. The following equation was used to determine the LoD for each
analyte: LoD= LoB + 1.645 (SD ).
low concentration sample
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined for TC, TG, and HDL by measuring
5 low levels of venous NaHep whole blood samples over 15 days using two analyzers
with two test strip lots (one lot per analyzer) to give a total of 60 results
measurements. The sponsor defines LoQ as the lowest concentration at which an
imprecision goal of CV < 10% can be met.
The results of the detection limit studies are summarized below:
Analyte LoB LoD LoQ
Total Cholesterol 47.5 mg/dL 51.7 mg/dL 100 mg/dL
Triglycerides 26.6 mg/dL 29.0 mg/dL 45.0 mg/dL
HDL 18.6 mg/dL 21.2 mg/dL 25.0 mg/dL

The measuring ranges for the SD LipidoCare System lipid panel are as follows:
TC: 100-450 mg/dL
TG: 45-650 mg/dL
HDL: 25-95 mg/dL
The measuring range for the SD LipidoCare System glucose measurement is 20-600
mg/dL and is supported by the linearity assay study above (M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
Glucose interference study:
To assess the effect of potential interfering substances on the performance of the SD
LipidoCare System glucose measurement, venous whole blood samples with low and
high glucose concentrations of approximately 65 mg/dL and 250 mg/dL (as
measured on the YSI 2300 STAT Plus comparator method )were spiked with two to
three levels of each potential interferent. The samples were run in replicates of nine.
The results of the spiked samples were compared to the results of control samples (as
measured on the YSI 2300 STAT Plus comparator method) which did not contain any
interferent substance. The sponsor defined significant interference as ≥ ± 10% bias
between the individual spiked sample concentrations and the mean concentration of
the control sample. The results are summarized below:

The sponsor has included the following language in the labeling:
- If you are taking acetaminophen or acetaminophen containing drugs (for example
Tylenol; at blood concentrations >6.6 mg/dL) you may get inaccurate results with
this system.
- If you have a disease or condition in which uric acid levels in your blood may be
elevated (>5.5 mg/dL), such as gout, you may get inaccurate results with this
system.
- Do not use this device during or shortly after receiving xylose absorption therapy
since xylose in your blood may cause inaccurate results with this system.
Lipids interference study:
To assess the effect of potential interfering substances on the performance of the SD
LipidoCare System lipid panel measurement, sodium heparin venous whole blood
samples with low and high concentrations of total cholesterol (175 and 240 mg/dL),
triglyceride (175 and 325 mg/dL) and HDL (36 and 68 mg/dL) were spiked with two
or three levels of each potential interferent. The samples were run in replicates of
five. The results of the spiked samples were compared to the results of control
samples which did not contain any interferent substance. The sponsor defined
significant interference as ≥ ± 10% bias between the individual spiked sample
concentrations and the mean concentration of the control sample.

LipidoCare Lipid Profile Professional Method Comparison Study:
A method comparison study was performed by healthcare professionals at three
external sites with capillary samples collected from the fingertip and a venous sample
collected in a Na-heparin tube. The capillary and venous whole blood samples were
tested on 3 different SD LipidoCare analyzers at each site for a total of 9 SD
LipidoCare analyzers using 3 lots of SD LipidoCare Lipid Profile test strips (one
lot/site). Samples which exceed the lower and higher end of the candidate device
measuring range were excluded from the analysis. A total of 355 total cholesterol,
356 triglyceride results, and 358 HDL results were obtained from the 3 test sites.
The candidate capillary whole blood test results were compared to test results
obtained from Na-heparin venous plasma tested using Roche Cobas Ready Total
Cholesterol, Roche HDL Cholesterol, and Roche Cobas Ready Triglyceride reagent
by a laboratory professional. All samples were unmodified. The regression analysis
results are summarized below:

Lipid Profile Test:
The accuracy of the SD LipidoCare system when used by the lay-user was evaluated
by 600 lay-user participants at 3 external medical sites (200 users per site). Testing
was performed using a total of 15 analyzers (5 per site) and 3 lots of SD Lipid Profile
test strips (one lot per site). The lay-user participants were provided with the SD
LipidoCare user manual. A healthcare professional then collected a blood sample
from the participant’s fingertip and obtained results using the comparator device
(Roche Cobas Ready Total Cholesterol, Roche HDL Cholesterol, and Roche Cobas
Ready Triglyceride reagent). The participants were given a survey for feedback on
the user manual and the candidate device. The accuracy data from each of the 3 test
sites was similar. A total of 10 HDL results were excluded at the 3 sites from the data
analysis due to being outside the measuring range of the candidate device.

Lay-user results (candidate) vs. comparator method
Glucose Test:
To assess accuracy of the SD LipidoCare system in the hands of the intended users
the sponsor performed a study with 586 lay-user participants at 3 external sites. The
number of lay-user participants at each site were as follows: site 1: n=196, site 2:
n=195, and site 3: n=195. Testing was performed using 3 lots of SD Glucose test
strips (one lot per site). The lay-user participants were provided with the SD
LipidoCare user manual in English. The lay-users collected their own fingertip
capillary blood using the SD LipidoCare Home System first and then from alternative
sites (palm, forearm, and upper arm) and recorded their own results. A healthcare
professional then collected the participant’s capillary blood sample from the fingertip
and tested the blood using the comparator device (YSI 2300). The participants were
given a survey for feedback on the user manual and the candidate device. The
following regression equations were obtained from one representative site for glucose
measurement:

O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.
There are two separate test strip insertion ports. The glucose test strip port is located at
the top of the meter and the lipid profile test strip port is located at the bottom of the
meter.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected. The SD LipidoCare System will store up to 500
patient results including control solution results. The results include the date and time the
sample was run.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The SD LipidoCare System is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the
finger, palm, forearm, and upper arm for glucose measurement; and capillary whole
blood from the fingertip for lipid measurement. The whole blood sample is applied
directly to the test strip and there is no special handling or storage required. The glucose
test strip requires a sample volume is 0.9 µL of whole blood and the lipid profile test strip
requires 35 µL of whole blood.
5. Calibration:
There is no user calibration required to perform the LipidoCare lipid profile and glucose
tests; however, a lot specific code chip is provided with each Lipid Profile test strip
package. Lipid Profile test calibrations were performed in-house and parameters were
coded into the code chip. The user inserts the code chip into the meter’s code chip portal.
The meter turns on automatically. A three-digit code number appears in the display
window. The user must check that the number on the display window matches with the
number on the test strip box. The calibration procedure programs the meter with the lot
number, expiration date and test strip technology. The blood glucose testing requires no
coding.
6. Quality Control:
The SD LipidoCare Professional and Home Systems User Manual states to use only SD
Lipid Control Solution and the SD Glucose Control Solution with this system. The SD
Lipid Control Solution consists of two levels of controls and is used as quality control for
the total cholesterol, triglyceride and HDL cholesterol measurements on the SD
LipidoCare Professional and Home Systems. The SD Glucose Control Solution consists
of two levels of controls for the glucose measurement on the SD LipidoCare Professional
25

--- Page 26 ---
and Home Systems. The SD Lipid Control Solutions and SD Glucose Control Solutions
are sold separately from the SD LipidoCare Professional and Home System. Instructions
on how to order the control solutions are included in the user manual. The meter has a
function for the user to select that they wish to run a control solution to prevent control
results from being stored in the internal memory as patient results. Recommendations on
when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. The control solution
readings are not included in the average of the patient results when the measurements are
performed in the “control solution mode”. An acceptable range for each control level is
printed on the test strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control
result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Sample volume study
Glucose: The SD LipidoCare Test system was tested with venous blood at three glucose
concentrations (approximately 50, 150, and 350 mg/dL) and seven specimen volumes
(0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0 and 1.1 µL). Each sample was measured in five replicates on
the candidate device and the results compared to those obtained with by an established
laboratory comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer)). Results support the claimed
minimum sample volume of 0.5 µL and the meter error code for insufficient sample
volume.
Lipid Profile: The SD LipidoCare Test system was tested with venous blood at three total
cholesterol levels (approximately 150, 194, and 253 mg/dL), three triglyceride levels
(approximately 92, 182, and 266 mg/dL) and three HDL levels (approximately 38, 54,
and 82 mg/dL) and nine specimen volumes (10, 20, 25, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35 µL).
Each sample was measured in triplicate on the candidate device and compared to the
results obtained using the laboratory comparator method (YSI). Results support the
claimed minimum sample volume of 35 µL and the meter error code for insufficient
sample volume.
2. Altitude study:
A study was performed by the sponsor to evaluate the effect of altitude on the
performance of the SD LipidoCare glucose test. Venous whole blood samples with
concentrations of glucose approximately 45, 110 and 350 mg/dL were exposed to
conditions simulating sea level (0ft), 3,280 feet, 6,561 feet, and 13,120 ft. The results
from the candidate device were compared to YSI to support the claims in the labeling that
altitudes from sea level up to 12,388 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose
measurements from the SD LipidoCare system.
3. Hematocrit study:
The sponsor evaluated the effect of hematocrit on three concentrations of total cholesterol
(150, 220, and 260 mg/dL), triglyceride (120, 185, and 520 mg/dL), and HDL (35, 50,
and 75 mg/dL); and five concentrations of Glucose (40, 80, 125, 355, and 520 mg/dL) in
26

--- Page 27 ---
venous whole blood. The blood samples were adjusted to the following hematocrit
levels:
To assess the effects of hematocrit on TC and TG: 25, 30, 50, 52, 55 and 60%
To assess the effects of hematocrit on HDL: 25, 30, 50, 52, and 55%
To assess the effects of hematocrit on Glucose: 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 65%
The samples were run on eight 8 SD LipidoCare analyzers (one test strip per analyzer for
TC, TG, HDL and Glucose) and the results were compared to control sample with a
hematocrit of 40% containing the same concentrations of analyte as the test samples.
The sponsor concluded that a hematocrit range between 30-55% for TC and TG, 30-52%
for HDL, and 20-60% for Glucose did not show any significant hematocrit effects.
4. Test System Operating Conditions Study:
Glucose test: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous
blood samples with five glucose concentrations (60, 108, 205, 300 and 475 mg/dL) to
evaluate the effects of temperatures ranging from 50oF to 113ºF (10-45 ºC) and relative
humidity conditions from 10% to 90%. Five temperature and humidity combinations
were tested: low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, average
temperature/average humidity, high temperature/low humidity and high temperature/high
humidity. Meter results were compared to YSI comparator analyzer. The results support
the claims in the labeling that the system can be used in conditions of 50-113°F (10-45
ºC) with relative humidity of 10 to 90% for glucose testing.
Lipid Profile test: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using two
concentrations of venous blood samples for total cholesterol (approximately 180 and 270
mg/dL), triglycerides (approximately 120 and 180 mg/dL) and HDL cholesterol
(approximately 50 and 80 mg/dL) to evaluate the effects of temperatures ranging from
64oF to 90ºF (18-32 ºC) and relative humidity from 10% to 90%. Meter results were
compared to the comparator method. Five temperature and humidity combinations were
tested: low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, average
temperature/average humidity, high temperature/low humidity and high temperature/high
humidity. No significant effect (relative to the comparator method) was observed with the
temperature and humidity combinations tested. The results support the claims in the
labeling that the system can be used in conditions of 64-90°F (18-32 ºC) with relative
humidity of 10 to 90% for lipid testing.
The final operational temperature range for the test system for measuring glucose and the
lipid profile tests is 64-90°F (18-32 ºC), which is the narrower of the glucose operating
condition ranges. The meters will display an error code (E- 4) and a thermal icon to
prevent a test result from being displayed when the system is outside of 64-90oF.
5. Infection Control Studies:
The four devices in this submission (SD LipidoCare Home, SD LipidoCare Professional,
SD LipidoCare BT Home, and SD LipidoCare BT Professional Systems)are for single
patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials
comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrating
27

complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Discide
Ultra Disinfecting Towelettes (EPA registration #10492-4). Robustness studies were also
performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or
external materials of the meter after 260 cleaning and disinfection cycles simulating
weekly single-patient use cleaning and disinfection over the 5 year use life of the meter.
The subject device labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated
cleaning and disinfection procedures.
6. EMC Testing
The sponsor provided appropriate documentation certifying that electromagnetic testing
(EMC) has been performed on the SD LipidoCare Analyzer (both Bluetooth and non-
Bluetooth models) and was found to be compliant.
7. This device was reviewed after the FDA issued final guidance documents for prescription
use blood glucose monitoring systems (BGMS) and over-the-counter use blood glucose
monitoring systems (SMBG). However, the recommendations in the guidance
documents were not followed for this device since the submission was received prior to
finalization of the guidance documents.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
