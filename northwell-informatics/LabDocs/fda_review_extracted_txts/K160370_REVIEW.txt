H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use
2. Indication(s) for use:
The BS-800M/ABS800/BA-800M Chemistry Analyzer is designed for clinical chemistry
laboratory use, making direct quantitative measurements of Na+ (sodium ), K+
(potassium ), Cl- (chloride ) in serum, plasma and urine samples, and Urea Nitrogen in
serum samples. Additionally, other various chemistry tests may be adaptable to the
analyzer depending on the reagent used to induce a photometric reaction.

Procedures; Approved Guideline-Second edition.
L. Test Principle:
BUN-Urea is hydrolyzed by urease to produce ammonia and carbon dioxide. The liberated
ammonia reacts with α-ketoglutarate in the presence of NADH to yield glutamate. An
equimolar quantity of NADH undergoes oxidation during the reaction resulting in a decrease
in absorbance that is directly proportional to the urea nitrogen concentration in the sample.
ISE- The ion selective electrodes develop a voltage that varies with the concentration of the
ion to which it responds, through the contact with samples. The relationship between the
voltage developed and the concentration of the sensed ion is logarithmic, as expressed by the
Nernst equation. Then the concentration of the ion (sodium, potassium, and chloride
concentration in serum and plasma samples) can be calculated by the Nernst equation and the
parameters obtained from the ISE testing process.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studied were performed according to CLSI document EP5-A3.
Repeatability and total precision of serum BUN, serum Na, K and Cl, and urine Na, K
and Cl were demonstrated by analyzing two levels of serum and urine based controls
on the BS-800M Chemistry Analyzer. The control pools were analyzed in 20
replicates in one run for each analyte to obtain the within run precision (N=20). Two
levels of serum and urine based controls were tested in duplicate twice per day for 20
days to obtain the total precision (N=80). Results are summarized in the tables

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
Each electrolyte’s traceability information is shown below.
Analyte Reference methods/materials
Na Atomic absorption method (NIST standard material SRM919)
K Atomic absorption method (NIST standard material SRM918)
Cl Atomic absorption method (NIST standard material SRM919)
Traceability for BUN reagent is to NIST BUN standard and was established under
k972671.
Stability
MR Serum/Urine Standards are stable for 12 months when stored at 5°C~35°C
and protected from light. Once opened, MR Serum/Urine Standards are stable for
8 weeks when stored tightly capped at 5°C ~35°C and protected from light. The
protocols for stability and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
adequate. BUN reagent stability was evaluated under k972671. Closed vial
stability is at 2-8°Cand open vial stability is 3 days at 18-25°C and 14 days at 2-
8°C.
Value assignment
The MR Serum Standards (High/Low levels) and MR Urine Standards (High/Low
levels) consist of Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Deionized Water, Surfactant
and Preservatives. The calibrator values are assigned internally following a
traceability process based on EN ISO 17511.
The target values are shown in the tables below:
MR Serum Standards Na+ K+ Cl-
High level (mmol/L) 160 6.0 120
Low level (mmol/L) 120 3.5 85
MR Urine Standards Na+ K+ Cl-
High level (mmol/L) 200 100 180
Low level (mmol/L) 50 10 50
The value assignment procedures for calibrators and controls of BUN Test System
have been previously evaluated under k070207 and k042318.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification
(LoQ) were evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2 Guideline using the BS-

800M Chemistry Analyzer.
LoB was determined by testing five blank samples using two reagent lots over three
days. Every sample was assayed in four replicates per reagent lot per day. A total of
60 measurements were obtained per reagent lot.
LoD was determined by testing five low level samples using two reagent lots over
three days. In total 60 measurements were obtained per reagent lot.
In the LoQ studies, five low level samples of known measurand concentration are
prepared. The BUN and serum Na+, K+ and Cl- concentration is obtained from
dilution calculation with SRM 956d and SRM 909c whose measurand concentration
is determined by NIST. And urine Na+, K+ and Cl- concentration is obtained from
dilution calculation with salt solution whose measurand concentration is determined
by theoretical spike. All samples were assayed in four replicates per reagent lot per
day for three days.
Results are summarized in the table below.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies are carried out according to the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline.
Interference studies were performed to determine the effects from potential
interferents such as bilirubin, hemoglobin, lipemia, ascorbic acid, drugs on the BUN
and the ISE assays using the BS-800M Chemistry Analyzer. Multiple levels of
interference were tested for each analyte. The sponsor states that interference is
considered to be non-significant if the bias between the tested and control samples are
within +/-10%. The highest endogenous substance concentration tested that shows
non-significant interference are summarized below:

There was significant interference from Hemoglobin and Potassium thiocynate. The
sponsor added the following limitations to their labeling:
• Avoid Hemolyzed samples for potassium. Hemolyzed samples may give
incorrect elevated potassium. Intracellular potassium concentration is 30-50
fold greater than that of extracellular serum or plasma.
• Potassium thiocynate increases potassium by 0.55 mmol/L at the
concentration of 3.30 mmol/L and by 0.58 mmol/L at the concentration of
5.39 mmol/L.
• Potassium thiocynate increases chloride by12.3 mmol/L at the concentration
of 90.9 mmol/L and by12.6 mmol/L at the concentration of 114.6 mmol/L

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The system supports manual and auto load of samples. The analyzing unit handles all
analyzing operations, which include sample and reagent handling, mixing, reaction,
measurements, cuvette wash station.
5. Calibration:
The sponsor recommends BUN calibration frequency every 14 days or with change in
reagent lot or as indicated by quality control procedures. This product has been
previously cleared in k070207. The sponsor recommends user to perform an ISE Two-
point calibration using fixed concentrations of MR Urine Standard and MR Serum
Standard for the ISE module on BS-800M, ABS800, BA-800M Chemistry Analyzer.
6. Quality Control:
The analyzer has a built in quality control program with two mode to run control samples,
automatic or manual. The labeling recommends running control samples every time after
the user perform a calibration, or change the reagent lot, or maintain and troubleshoot the
instrument.
The sponsor recommends in their labeling that QC materials should be run after each
calibration of the ISE module. Controls should be run once each day of use. It is
recommended that each laboratory establish their own frequency of control
determination.
P. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
Q. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
