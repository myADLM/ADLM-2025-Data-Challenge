by photodiode. Results are calculated by a reflection rate which is a percentage of the total
reflectance of the testing wavelength and are printed automatically.
The Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer reports semi-quantitative results for Glucose, Bilirubin,
Ketone, Specific Gravity, Blood, pH, Protein, Urobilinogen, Nitrite, and Leukocytes in urine.
The analyzer features a display, internal printer, a serial computer interface and an electrical
outlet. Communication between the operator and the analyzer is made through the display
using the user interface touch screen on the front surface of the instrument. Reagent strip
results are automatically displayed on the screen in one minute. A printed hardcopy can also
be created either from the results screen or recalled from memory.
The Teco Diagnostic Urine Reagent Strips (URS-10, previously cleared in k970250) are firm
plastic strips to which ten different reagent pads are affixed. The reagent pad areas are
bibulous material saturated with chemically active substances, then dried and affixed to the
plastic strip with double-sided adhesive. The Urine Reagent (URS-10) Strips provide tests for
the semi-quantitative and qualitative determination of Glucose, Bilirubin, Ketone, Specific
Gravity, Blood, pH, Protein, Urobilinogen, Nitrite, and Leukocytes in urine.

L. Test Principle:
Analyte Test Principle
Based on a double sequential enzyme reaction. One enzyme,
glucose oxidase, catalyzes the reaction in which glucose is
oxidized to produce gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide. A
Glucose second enzyme, peroxidase, catalyzes the reaction of hydrogen
peroxide with potassium iodide chromogen in which the
chromogen is oxidized to different colors ranging from blue-
green to greenish-brown through brown and dark brown.
Based on the coupling of bilirubin with a diazotized
dichioroaniline in a strongly acid medium. Varying bilirubin
Bilirubin
levels will produce light tan to reddish brown color proportional
to its concentration in urine.
Based on the reaction of acetoacetic acid with sodium
nitroprusside in a strongly basic medium. The colors range from
Ketone
beige or buff-pink color for a "Negative" reading to pink and
pink-purple for a "Positive" reading.
Based on the apparent pKa change of certain pretreated
polyelectrolytes in relation to the ionic concentration. In the
Specific
presence of an indicator, the colors range from dark blue or blue-
Gravity
green in urine of low ionic concentration to green and yellow-
green in urine of higher ionic concentration.
Based on the pseudoperoxidase action of hemoglobin and
erythrocytes which catalyzes the reaction of 3,3’,5,5’-
tetramethyl-benzidine and buffered organic peroxide. The
Blood
resulting colors range from orange to yellow-green and dark
green. Very high blood concentration may cause the color
development to continue to dark blue.
Based on the well-known double pH indicator method, where
bromothymol blue and methyl red give distinguishable colors
pH
over the pH range of 5-9. The colors range from red-orange to
yellow and yellow-green to blue-green.
Based on the protein error-of-indicator principle. At a constant
pH, the development of any green color is due to the presence of
Protein
protein. Colors range from yellow for a "Negative" reaction to
yellow-green and green to blue-green for a "Positive" reaction.
Based on a modified Ehrlich reaction in which p-
Urobilinogen diethylaminobenzaldehyde reacts with urobilinogen in a strongly
acid medium. Colors range from light pink to bright magenta.
This test depends on the conversion of nitrate to nitrite by the
Nitrite
action of Gram-negative bacteria in the urine. The nitrite reacts

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The study to evaluate the reportable range (percent recovery) for each semi-
quantitative level of the Uritek TC-201 Urine Chemistry Test System was performed
by measuring a negative urine and a negative urine pool spiked with known
increasing and decreasing concentrations of analytes relative to each semi-
quantitative level. Samples were measured in replicates of eight by three operators on
three reagents strip lots for a total of 24 measurements for every sample. A pH meter
was used to confirm the pH results. The specific gravity was confirmed by a clinical,
handheld refractometer.
The percent recovery for each analyte at each concentration block is shown in the
table below:

A study was performed to validate the cut-off concentration for each semi-
quantitative level measured by the Uritek TC-201 Urine Chemistry Test System.
Samples were prepared by spiking a negative urine pool with a minimum of four
levels across the measuring range for each analyte concentration. The samples were
analyzed in replicates of eight by three operators on three reagent strip lots, for a total
of 24 data points for each level. The low cut-off concentration for each color block
was defined as the lowest concentration at which >55% of the test results are positive.
The cut-off values and percentage sensitivity for each color block for individual
analyte is summarized and demonstrated in the table below:

e. Analytical specificity:
Potential endogenous interferents and drugs commonly found in urine were evaluated
to assess the interfering effect of various substances on the performance of the Uritek
TC-201 Urine Chemistry Test System. Testing was performed using three urine pools
with negative, low positive and positive concentrations for all analytes. At least two
levels of the listed interferents were added. Each urine sample was tested in triplicate.
The individual results of the samples spiked with the interfering substance at the
stated concentration were compared against the control sample with no interfering
substance. Interference was defined as a change in output of ± 1 color blocks between
spiked and unspiked control sample.
The concentrations of the potential interfering substances that did not have any
influence on the test results are listed below:
Highest Concentration at which
Potential Interfering Substance
no interference was observed
Ascorbic Acid 30 mg/dL
Ammonium Chloride 200 mg/dL
Albumin ≤125 mg/dL
Bilirubin 8 mg/dL
Creatine 10 mg/dL
Lithium Acetoacetate ≤60 mg/dL

In addition to the interference described in the table above, the labeling includes
limitations that the following substances may interfere with one or more analytes on
the Uritek TC-201 Urine Chemistry Test System:
Quarternary ammonium complexes
Chlorpromazine
Rafampen
Indican
Lodine metabolites
Drugs containing azo dyes
Microbial peroxidase
Cephalexin

pH Interference Study
An additional study to evaluate the effect of sample pH on the test results for the ten
analytes in human urine was performed. The study result shows that sample pH from
5.0 to 9.0 does not affect the test results for leukocytes, urobilinogen, ketone, pH,
blood, nitrite, bilirubin and glucose. Samples with pH greater than 8.5 affected the
protein test resulting in a false high result.
Specific Gravity Interference Study
An additional study was performed to evaluate the effect of sample specific gravity
on the test results for the ten analytes in human urine. The study result shows that
sample specific gravity from 1.000 to 1.040 does not affect the test results for
15

leukocytes, urobilinogen, ketone, blood, nitrite, bilirubin and glucose. Samples with
specific gravity greater than 1.030 affected the pH and protein tests resulting in a
false low result.
The labeling includes the effects from pH and specific gravity as limitations of the
procedure.
Sample carry-over study
The interference of samples running over from one pad to the adjacent pad on the
performance of the Uritek TC-201 Urine Chemistry Test System was evaluated. Prior
to testing, the strip was dipped into commercially available urine control solutions
(negative, low positive, high positive) and was then held upward to allow the sample
to flow from the leukocyte pad to the next aligned pads or held downward to allow
the sample flow from the glucose pad to the next aligned pads. Each holding method
was tested in 3 replicates. The results support the claims that test results are not
affected by sample carry-over.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed at three point-of-care sites using a single
replicate of 392 clinical urine samples between the Urine Reagent (URS-10) Strips on the
TC-201 Urine Analyzer and the Siemens Multistix 10 SG Reagent Strips on the Siemens
Clinitek Status+ Urine Analyzer. 11% of the total samples were contrived (44 samples).
At each site, six operators performed the testing using one lot of URS-10 test strips and
one analyzer.
Additional method comparison data was obtained from POC Site I and Site II for 117
clinical samples. The total number of patient urine specimens evaluated in the method
comparison study is 509.
Testing results are summarized in the following tables.

b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. Urine is the only sample matrix.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The labeling states the following:
Glucose: Small amounts of glucose are normally excreted by the kidney.5 Concentrations
as little as 0.1 g/dl glucose, read either at 10 or 30 seconds, may be significantly
abnormal if found consistently. At 10 seconds, results should be interpreted qualitatively;
for semi-quantitative results, read at 30 seconds only.
Bilirubin: Normally, no bilirubin is detectable in urine by even the most sensitive
method. Even trace amounts of bilirubin are sufficiently abnormal to require further
investigation. Atypical colors (colors produced which are different than the negative or
positive color blocks shown on the Color Chart) may indicate that bilirubin derived bile
pigments are present in the urine sample and are possibly masking the bilirubin reaction.
Ketone: Normally, no ketones are present in urine. Detectable levels of ketone may
occur in urine during physiological stress conditions such as fasting, pregnancy, and
frequent strenuous exercise.6-8 In starvation diets, or in other abnormal carbohydrate
metabolism situation, ketones appear in the urine in excessively large amounts before
serum ketones are elevated.9
Specific Gravity: Random urine may vary in specific gravity from 1.003-1.040+.
Twenty-four hour urine from normal adults with normal diets and normal fluid intake
will have a specific gravity of 1.016-1.022.10
20

--- Page 21 ---
Blood: Any green spots or green color developing on the reagent area within 40 seconds
is significant and the urine should be examined further. Blood is frequently, but not
invariably found in the urine of menstruating females.
pH: The normal pH of urine can range from 4.5-8.0. The average pH values in healthy
subjects is 6.0.3
Protein: In 24-hour urine, 1-14 mg/dl of protein may be excreted by the normal kidney.4
A color matching any color block greater than trace indicates significant proteinuria. For
urine with high specific gravity, the test area may most closely match the trace color
block even though only normal concentrations of protein are present. Clinical judgment is
needed to evaluate the significance of trace results.
Urobilinogen: In a healthy population, the normal urine urobilinogen range obtained
with this test is 0.2-1.0 Ehrlich Unit/dL. A result of 2.0 EU/dL may be of clinical
significance and the same patient sample should be evaluated further.
Nitrite: Normally no detectable amount of nitrite is present in urine.3 The nitrite area will
be positive in a proportion of cases of significant infection, depending on how long the
urine specimens were retained in the bladder prior to collection. Retrieval of positive
cases with the nitrite test range from as low as 40%, in instances where little bladder
incubation occurred, to as high as 80% in instances where a minimum of 4 hours
incubation occurred.
Leukocytes: Normal urine specimens generally yield negative results with this test. A
trace result may be of questionable clinical significance and it is recommended that the
test be repeated using a fresh sample from the same patient. Repeated trace and positive
results are of clinical significance.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Flex Study – Temperature and Humidity
The environmental effect on the performance of the Uritek TC-201 Urine Chemistry Test
System was evaluated by placing the test strips in relative humidity of <20%, 30%, 50%,
60% and 70% environment at 15°C and 45°C. Strips were removed at 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h,
16h and 24h for testing in triplicate using commercially available urine control solutions at
Level I (High analyte concentration), Level II (Low analyte concentration) and Level III
(Negative). The study results support the claim that the test strips are stable at 15-30°C (59-
86°F) at 20-30% humidity.
Flex Study – Timing of Urine Dip
A study was performed to demonstrate that there is no impact in results for Uritek TC-201
Urine Chemistry Test System when the strips are dipped in urine for 1-10 seconds. The
labeling states that the dipping step should not exceed 10 seconds.
Analyzer Operating Conditions Study
A study was performed to support the claim of acceptable operating conditions at 15-30°C
and 18-80% Relative Humidity for the Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer. The performance of
Uritek TC-201 Urine Chemistry Test System was evaluated by placing the Uritek TC-201
Urine analyzer in relative humidity of 92% at 30°C. These conditions were manufactured
artificially in the Laminar Air Flow Cabinet by placing Hot Water Steam Bath and a
Humidifier. Tests were performed at particular time-points at 0.1h, 8h, 16h and 24h using
commercially available urine control solutions at Level I (High analyte concentration),
Level II (Low analyte concentration) and Level III (Negative).
The Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer device complies with the applicable voluntary standards
which include IEC 61010-1 and IEC 61010-2-101 for Electrical Safety and IEC 61326-1 and
IEC 61326-2 for Electromagnetic Compatibility.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
