2. Indication(s) for use:
The GEM Premier 5000 is a portable critical care system for use by health care
professionals to rapidly analyze whole blood samples at the point of health care delivery
in a clinical setting and in a central laboratory. The instrument provides quantitative
measurements of glucose, lactate and total bilirubin from venous, arterial and capillary
heparinized whole blood. These parameters aid in the diagnosis of a patient’s metabolite
balance.
Glucose (Glu) measurement is used in the diagnosis and treatment of carbohydrate
metabolism disturbances including diabetes mellitus, neonatal hypoglycemia, and
idiopathic hypoglycemia, and of pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.
Lactate (Lac) measurement is used:
• to evaluate the acid‐base status of patients suspected of having lactic acidosis;
• to monitor tissue hypoxia and strenuous physical exertion;
• in the diagnosis of hyperlactatemia
Total bilirubin measurement is used to aid in assessing the risk of kernicterus and
hyperbilirubinemia in neonates.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only at point-of-care and central laboratory settings
4. Special instrument requirements:
GEM Premier 5000 analyzer
I. Device Description:
The GEM Premier 5000 system contains two key components: the GEM Premier 5000
analyzer and the GEM Premier 5000 PAK (cartridge). The GEM Premier 5000 PAK
contains reagents, sensors, optical cell for Co-Ox and total bilirubin, sampler and waste bag.
It enables analysis of 75 to 600 samples per cartridge. Analyzer: Employs a unique color
touch screen and a simple set of menus and buttons for user interaction. The analyzer guides
operators through the sampling process with simple, clear messages and prompts.
GEM Premier 5000 PAK: Houses all required components necessary to operate the
instrument once the cartridge is validated. These components include the sensors,
CO‐Ox/tBili optical cell, Process Control (PC) Solutions, sampler, pump tubing, distribution
valve and waste bag. The GEM PAK has flexible menus and test volume options to assist
facilities in maximizing efficiency.

L. Test Principle:
The glucose and lactate sensors are amperometric biosensors consisting of a platinum
electrode poised at a positive potential with respect to the card reference electrode. Glucose
or lactate determination is accomplished by enzymatic reaction of glucose or lactate with
oxygen in the presence of glucose oxidase or lactate oxidase and the electrochemical
oxidation of the resulting hydrogen peroxide at the platinum electrode. The current flow
between the platinum electrode and the ground electrode is proportional to the rate at which
hydrogen peroxide molecules diffuse to the platinum and are oxidized, which in turn is
directly proportional to the metabolite (glucose or lactate) concentration I = (S x metabolite)
+ IZ, where “I” is the electrode current, “S” is the sensitivity, and IZ is the zero current. The
value of S and IZ can be calculated from the Process Control Solution data for the sensor.
The equation can then be solved for the metabolite concentration, where “I” becomes the
electrode current produced by the blood sample.
Total bilirubin measurement is based on an optical absorbance measurement of the sample.
An in‐line optical assay is integrated in to the GEM PAK flow path where the hemolyzed
whole blood sample provides a measure of total bilirubin and CO‐Oximetry. The optical cell
is a flow through channel with two parallel plate optical windows separated by a well‐defined
path length. The chemical lysing of the sample is implemented to minimize the scattering
effect of the blood and to make the spectral measurement more reliable. The optical
measurement hardware consisting of a white light‐emitting diode (LED) light source, a neon

blood samples were prepared each day. Testing was completed in 8 replicates per
run for each level and 1 run per day for 5 days on 3 GEM Premier 5000
instruments. Results are summarized below:

4) To evaluate whole blood imprecision on the new GEM Premier 5000 system in
the central laboratory and point-of-care (POC) settings, whole blood patient
samples were tested at 2 external central laboratories and 1 internal Customer
Simulation Laboratory, as well as at 3 external POC locations. For the central
laboratory setting, the studies were performed by 3 operators on 3 GEM Premier
5000 instruments using a single lot of GEM Premier 5000 PAK (cartridge). For
the POC Setting, the studies were performed by 11 operators on 3 GEM Premier
5000 instruments, using a single lot of GEM Premier 5000 PAK (cartridge). At
least two whole blood specimens were analyzed in triplicate daily for 5 days
under both normal mode (150 μL) and micro capillary (65 μL) mode. Due to the
use of unique whole blood samples at each clinical site, only repeatability can be
evaluated. Reproducibility was not assessed for the whole blood samples. At the
internal Customer Simulation Laboratory, contrived whole blood specimens were
analyzed in addition to native specimens in order to cover the low and high
medical decision levels of each analyte.

The presented data demonstrates linearity across the claimed measuring range of the
device for the 3 analytes (glucose, lactate, and total bilirubin).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The GEM Premier 5000 Glucose is traceable by automated spectrophotometry using
hexokinase method per CDC no. 77‐8330 using secondary standard prepared from
NIST #917.
No reference method is established for lactate. By automated spectrophotometry
using lactate oxidase with secondary standard prepared from USP #1614308.
The GEM Premier 5000 bilirubin measurement is traceable to modified
Jendrassik‐Grof method using NIST #916a standard reference material.
d. Detection limit:
In accordance with CLSI EP17-A2, LoB, LoD and LoQ were established for glucose,
lactate and total bilirubin, using three (3) lots of GEM Premier 5000 PAKs
(cartridges). Samples tested were all lithium heparin whole blood samples. LoB was
determined by running three blank samples in 60 replicates per day over 3 days using
3 lots of GEM Premier 5000 PAKs (cartridges) on 3 different GEM Premier 5000
instruments.
LoD and LoQ were determined by running low level samples in 60 replicates per day
over 3 days using 3 lots of GEM Premier 5000 PAKs (cartridges) on 3 different GEM
Premier 5000 instruments. LoD is calculated based on LoB (mean) + 1.65 SD (low
sample). LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration at which measured total error
is less than the pre-defined total error. The results are summarized in the table below:

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP-7A guidance to determine
the effects from potential interferents on the electrolyte assays. Various
concentrations of interferents were spiked into two levels (low and high) of each
analyte. Testing was performed in singlet per level using 3 GEM Premier 5000
analyzers. The sponsor’s definition of non-significant interference for each analyte
was as follows: 10% for glucose, ±10% for tBili, and ±0.4 mmol/L for lactate.
The highest concentration tested that shows non-significant interference are
summarized below:

In accordance with EP09-A3, a method comparison study was conducted on the GEM
Premier 5000 in the point-of-care (POC) setting using heparinized whole blood
patient samples from the intended use population.

For glucose and lactate, the pooled results from the POC sites and the IL internal
Customer Simulation Laboratory (CSL) for the Normal Mode (with samples collected
in syringes) are presented below:
Syringe Samples

Glucose (mg/dL) 489 0.973 3.622 0.998 12 to 619
Lactate

(mmol/L)
Another method comparison study for capillary whole blood for glucose and lactate
was performed at an external POC site in a hospital and an internal laboratory.
Capillary whole blood specimens were collected via capillary puncture into 2
capillary tubes containing lithium heparin, and tested immediately on GEM4000
(predicate) and GEM5000 (new device). In addition, <20% of altered capillary
samples were tested internally to cover the claimed measuring ranges. The study
results are summarized below:
