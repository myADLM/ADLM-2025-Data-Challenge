Donor venous blood was collected in balanced lithium heparinized blood collection
tubes. For the pO and pCO , five levels were prepared by tonometrization. For pH,
2 2
whole blood was adjusted to the five levels using carbonate.
For pH and the pO each sample was tested in two sampling modes: normal using 150
2
μL with syringe and micro using 65 μL with capillary tube. For pCO each sample
2
was tested in normal using 150 μL with syringe. The samples were run on three
GEM Premier 5000 analyzers per sample mode for five days, with one run per day
and 8 replicates measured per run per level for a total of 120 replicates per level.
Day-to-day variability was not assessed due to the in vitro instability of whole blood.
Fresh blood samples at each level were prepared daily. The results are given as

A precision study at two central laboratories, one company internal customer
simulation laboratory, and three point of care sites in hospital settings was performed
on the GEM Premier 5000 for pH, pCO , and pO using lithium heparinized whole
2 2
blood patient samples.
All samples were arterial or venous native whole blood patient samples from
individual donors. At least two whole blood specimens were analyzed in triplicate
daily for 5 days in two sampling modes: normal using 150 μL with syringe and micro
using 65 μL with capillary tube. A new specimen was used for each sample mode.
For the central laboratory setting, the studies were performed by 3 operators on 3
GEM Premier 5000 instruments using a single lot of GEM Premier 5000 PAK

To challenge the measuring range, pH was tested for linearity at 8 levels, and pO and
2
pCO were tested at 9 levels. The samples were venous whole blood from healthy
2
volunteers that were adjusted to different levels by addition of carbonate for pH
samples, and tonometrization for pO and pCO samples. The concentrations for pH
2 2
were assigned using the Radiometer ABL 837 as a reference device. For pO and
2
pCO the concentrations were assigned by tonometry using commercially available
2
gases.
The whole blood concentration pools were adjusted so that one pool exceeded the
upper end of the range by 20-30% and one pool exceeded the lower end of the range
by 20-30%, wherever possible. For pH, the upper end of the reference analyzer
measuring range was the same as the anticipated GEM Premier 5000 claimed
measuring range, thus the sample level exceeding the upper limit was omitted. For
pO , test samples could not be adjusted beyond 756 mmHg under ambient
2
atmospheric conditions, thus the upper end of the claimed measuring range was not
exceeded. Each blood sample was analyzed in triplicate on three GEM Premier 5000
analyzers and results compared to the reference measurements.
For pH, regression analysis found a statistically significant coefficient for a second
order polynomial fit which indicated possible non-linearity. Linearity was further
assessed by comparing the deviation of the regression line from linearity. At each
level, the deviation from linearity was less than ±0.04 pH units.
For pCO , regression analysis found a statistically significant coefficient for a third
2
order polynomial fit which indicated possible non-linearity. Linearity was further
assessed by comparing the deviation of the regression line from linearity. At each
level, the deviation from linearity was less than ±5 mmHg.
For pO , regression analysis found that the coefficients for a second or third order
2
polynomial fit were not statistically significant. Therefore, the pO results
2
demonstrate a satisfactory linear response over the measuring range.
The linear regression results are given in the table below:

Based on these results, the sponsor concluded that the linearity data support the

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The GEM Premier 5000 PAK measurement for pCO is traceable to tonometry at
2
37°C using NIST traceable gas mixtures.
The GEM Premier 5000 PAK measurement for pO is traceable to tonometry at 37°C
2
using NIST traceable gas mixtures.
The GEM Premier 5000 PAK measurement for pH is traceable to NIST Standard
Reference Material 186g.
Stability:
Stability studies were performed with GEM Premier 5000 PAK for pH, pCO , and
2
pO . The protocols for stability and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to
2
be adequate.
Shelf life stability studies demonstrated that GEM Premier 5000 PAK is stable for
180 days when stored in the claimed range of 15-25°C. The on-board stability of the
GEM Premier 5000 PAK is 31 days or for 600 sample usage. The cartridges are
stable when exposed to transport conditions for days at 10-38°C and up to 10,000 feet
altitude.
d. Detection limit:
Linearity studies were used to support the lower end of the measuring range for pH,
pCO , and pO .
2 2
e. Analytical specificity:
In accordance with EP07‐A2, an interference study was conducted on the GEM
Premier 5000 for pH, pCO , and pO .
2 2
Heparinized whole blood from healthy volunteers was collected daily for the samples.
With these samples, an interference screening test was conducted at 2 levels of pH,
pCO , and pO . At each level, a potential interfering substance was spiked at a worse
2 2
case high concentration. The substances tested represent anesthetics and medications
often prescribed for critically ill patients and endogenous substances. Interference
was calculated as the bias between the average test result with interfering substance
and average control measurement across the three GEM Premier 5000 analyzers. The
control sample was prepared by spiking diluent only.
The sponsor stated that interference was considered to be non-significant if the bias
between the test and control sample was within the following criteria:

Hematocrit:
The sponsor conducted a screening interference study to demonstrate that changes in
hematocrit do not affect the pH, pCO , and pO measurements. Whole blood samples
2 2
at two levels of hematocrit (25% and 75%) representing the lowest and highest
hematocrit levels were tested at two levels for each of the blood gases and compared
to the same samples with normal hematocrit. The results demonstrated bias less than
the significant interference criteria (see table above). Based on the hematocrit study
results, the sponsor concluded that hematocrit levels between 25% to 75% do not
significantly interfere with the pH, pCO , and pO measurements.
2 2
Altitude study:
A study was conducted to demonstrate that altitudes between sea level and 10,000
feet (3050 meters) have no significant effect on the GEM Premier 5000 for pH, pCO
2
and pO measurements. Two sites were selected with altitudes of 10,152 feet (high
2
altitude site) and 135 feet (low altitude site). At each site, samples were prepared
from heparinized whole blood using gas mixtures to create different pH and blood gas
levels. Since identical analyte levels could not be achieved at each of the two sites,
the altitude study analysis consisted of: (1) fitting a linear regression line to the values
obtain with the six levels for each site, (2) deriving the measurement bias between the
two sites by calculating the difference between the regression lines at target levels for
pH, pO , and pCO , and (3) comparing the measurement bias to the significant
2 2
interference criteria (see table above).

#1. Point-of-Care Method Comparison for pH, pO , and pCO using normal syringe
2 2
mode
A POC method comparison study was performed to establish the accuracy
performance of the GEM Premier 5000 for pH, pO , and pCO at three external point-
2 2
of-care (POC) settings.
A minimum of one operator at each POC site participated in sample analysis. Each
site used one GEM Premier 5000 analyzer and one GEM Premier 4000 analyzer. The
samples were leftover native whole blood samples from the routine hospital
population. These samples comprised both venous and arterial collections.
A subset of about 12% of the total samples was adjusted to cover medical decision
levels that could not be sourced by native specimens. These results were combined
with each POC sites results.
Samples were tested in the normal syringe mode (150 μL). Patient samples were run
in singlicate on one GEM Premier 5000 and the results were compared to those
obtained on the predicate device (GEM Premier 4000) by the same operator.
The linear regression analysis from the combined POC sites is presented below:

#2. Point-of-Care Method Comparison for pH and pO2 using normal capillary mode
with capillary specimens
Note: Capillary not claimed for pCO on the GEM Premier 5000.

A POC method comparison study was performed to establish the accuracy
performance of the GEM Premier 5000 for pH and pO at an external POC site in a
2
hospital and an internal laboratory which simulated a POC site.
The samples were prospectively collected whole blood capillary specimens. On each
patient, two skin puncture specimens were collected consecutively into two capillary
tubes containing lithium heparin. A minimum of 300 µL whole blood per patient was
collected. The internal site tested healthy donors and the external site used samples

from a Cardiac Care Unit and a Progressive Cardiac Care Unit. There were 99 males
and 55 females in the study. The age range was 18 to 84 years.
Each site used one GEM Premier 5000 analyzer and one GEM Premier 4000
analyzer. There were two POC operators at the external site and three POC operators
at the internal site. The operators were hospital staff with no formal laboratory
training.
After collection, the samples were immediately tested in normal capillary mode on
the GEM Premier 5000 and GEM Premier 4000 (predicate) by the same POC
operator. The results based on native capillary samples at Medical Decision Level are
summarized below.
