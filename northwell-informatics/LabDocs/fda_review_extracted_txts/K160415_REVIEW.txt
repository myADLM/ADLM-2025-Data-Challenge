H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The GEM Premier 5000 is a portable critical care system for use by health care
professionals to rapidly analyze heparinized whole blood samples at the point of health
care delivery in a clinical setting and in a central laboratory. The instrument provides
quantitative measurements of Hematocrit and Total Hemoglobin from venous and arterial
heparinized whole blood, as well as quantitative measurements of O2Hb, COHb, MetHb,
HHb, sO2 from venous, arterial and capillary heparinized whole blood. These
parameters, along with derived parameters, aid in the diagnosis of a patient’s oxygen
delivery capacity.
• Hematocrit (Hct) measurements in whole blood of the packed red cell volume of a
blood sample are used to distinguish normal from abnormal states, such as anemia and
erythrocytosis (an increase in the number of red cells).
• Total Hemoglobin (tHb): Total hemoglobin measurements are used to measure the
hemoglobin content of whole blood for the detection of anemia.
• COHb: Carboxyhemoglobin measurements are used to determine the
carboxyhemoglobin content of human blood as an aid in the diagnosis of carbon
monoxide poisoning.
• MetHb: Methemoglobin measurements are used to determine different conditions of
methemoglobinemia.
• HHb: Deoxyhemoglobin, as a fraction of total hemoglobin, is used in combination with
oxyhemoglobin to measure oxygenation status.
• O2Hb: Oxyhemoglobin, as a fraction of total hemoglobin, is used in combination with
deoxyhemoglobin to measure oxygenation status.
• sO : Oxygen saturation, more specifically the ratio between the concentration of
2
oxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin plus deoxyhemoglobin, is used to measure
oxygenation status.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only at point-of-care and central laboratory settings
4. Special instrument requirements:

L. Test Principle:
Hct: Hematocrit is measured by an electrical conductivity technique. The conductivity
technique is based on the principle that because plasma is more conductive than blood cells
due to the high resistance of the cell membranes, the resistivity of blood will increase as the
concentration of cells increases. This relationship is expressed by the Maxwell‐Fricke
equation: r = Rp x (1 + Hct/100)/(1‐Hct/100), where “r” is the blood resistivity, Rp is a
constant based on the plasma resistivity, and Hct is hematocrit. The electrode chamber
contains a miniature conductivity cell. By applying an alternating potential through the cell,
the resistance of the fluid in the cell can be determined by means of Ohm’s Law.
CO-OX: CO-Oximetry (tHb, O2Hb, COHb, MetHb, HHb and sO ) is based on an optical
2
absorbance measurement of the sample. An in‐line optical cell is integrated in the flow path
of the hemolyzed sample to provide a measure of hemoglobin and its derivatives. The optical
cell is a flow through channel with two parallel plate optical windows separated by a
well‐defined path length. The chemical lysing of the sample is implemented to minimize the
scattering effect of the blood and to make the spectral measurement more reliable. The
optical measurement hardware, consisting of a white light‐emitting diode (LED) light source,
a neon reference and a high resolution spectrometer with a holographic diffraction grating
and a charge‐coupled device (CCD) array, are all contained in the analyzer. Only the optical
cell is located in the disposable cartridge (GEM PAK) and is aligned with the analyzer optics
for spectral measurements following installation of the GEM PAK.

Oxygen saturation (sO ) is a calculated value, more specifically, the ratio between the
2
concentration of oxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin plus deoxyhemoglobin.
Lithium heparin whole blood sample drawn from the patient is measured by using one of the
three modes below: Normal mode (150 μL), micro mode (65 μL), or tbili/CO-OX mode (100
μL). Both syringe and capillary samples can be used in normal mode, while only capillary
samples can be used in micro mode. The tbili/CO-OX mode is for measuring bilirubin and
CO‐Oximetry analytes only.

2) In addition, an internal precision study was performed using five levels of lithium
heparin whole blood samples under normal mode (150 μL) for Hematocrit(Hct), Total
Hemoglobin(tHb), Carboxyhemoglobin(COHb), Methemoglobin(MetHb),
Deoxyhemoglobin(HHb), Oxyhemoglobin(O2Hb), Oxygen Saturation(sO2) and
micro capillary (65 μL) mode for Carboxyhemoglobin(COHb),
Methemoglobin(MetHb), Deoxyhemoglobin(HHb), Oxyhemoglobin(O2Hb), Oxygen
Saturation(sO2). Due to the instability of whole blood, fresh whole blood samples
were prepared each day. Testing was completed in 8 replicates per run for each level
and 1 run per day for 5 days on 3 GEM Premier 5000 instruments. Results are

External Precision Studies:
3) A reproducibility study was performed at 3 external clinical point-of-care (POC)
sites. The studies were run by a total of 9 different operators (perfusionists and
respiratory therapists) on 3 different GEM Premier 5000 instruments using a
single lot of GEM Premier 5000 PAK (cartridge). Each site used the same lots of
GEM System Evaluator (GSE) 1, 2 and 3, running each control level in triplicate,
twice a day for 5 days, for a total of 30 replicates per level per site. The pooled
repeatability and reproducibility results for these 3 POC sites are summarized

Customer Simulation Laboratory, as well as at 3 external POC locations. For the
central laboratory setting, the studies were performed by 3 operators on 3 GEM
Premier 5000 instruments using a single lot of GEM Premier 5000 PAK
(cartridge). For the POC Setting, the studies were performed by 11 operators on 3
GEM Premier 5000 instruments, using a single lot of GEM Premier 5000 PAK
(cartridge). At least two whole blood specimens were analyzed in triplicate daily
for 5 days in both normal mode (150 μL) for Hematocrit(Hct), Total
Hemoglobin(tHb), Carboxyhemoglobin(COHb), Methemoglobin(MetHb),
Deoxyhemoglobin(HHb), Oxyhemoglobin(O2Hb), Oxygen Saturation(sO2) and
micro capillary (65 μL) mode for Carboxyhemoglobin(COHb),
Methemoglobin(MetHb), Deoxyhemoglobin(HHb), Oxyhemoglobin(O2Hb),
Oxygen Saturation(sO2). Due to the use of unique whole blood samples at each
clinical site, only repeatability can be evaluated. Reproducibility was not
assessed for the whole blood samples. At the internal Customer Simulation
Laboratory, contrived whole blood specimens were analyzed in addition to native
specimens in order to cover the low and high medical decision levels of each
analyte.

* The candidate device is not intended for the measurement of Hct and tHb in
capillary samples; therefore, only data from syringe samples tested under normal
mode for Hct and tHb are shown in the table.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity studies were performed followed the CLSI EP06-A guidance. For
hematocrit, total hemoglobin, O2Hb, COHb, MetHb, and HHb, eight levels or more per
analyte were prepared by spiking or diluting lithium heparin lithium heparin whole
blood from healthy volunteers to challenge the claimed measuring measurement range
for each parameter. Three replicates were measured on three (3) GEM Premier 5000
analyzers for each sample. The mean of these replicates was compared to those
obtained on the reference analyzers. The linear regression results support the claimed
measuring ranges, as summarized in the table below:
Note: Combined data from limit of quantitation (LOQ) and linearity studies were used
to support lower limit of the claimed reportable range.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The GEM Premier 5000 tHb measurement is traceable to Hemiglobincyanide by
colorimetry using CyanMetHb standards prepared per CLSI H15-A3 specifications.
The GEM Premier 5000 Hct traceability is achieved by centrifugation using whole
blood for establishing true correlation per CLSI H7-A3 guideline. Maintained from
lot to lot by controlling conductivity through controlling sodium levels.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification
(LoQ) were evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2 Guideline.
Samples tested were all lithium heparin whole blood samples. LoB was determined
by running three blank samples in 60 replicates per day over 3 days using 3 lots of
GEM Premier 5000 PAKs (cartridges) on 3 different GEM Premier 5000 instruments.
LoD and LoQ were determined by running low level samples in 60 replicates per day
over 3 days using 3 lots of GEM Premier 5000 PAKs (cartridges) on 3 different GEM
Premier 5000 instruments. LoD is calculated based on LoB (mean) + 1.65 SD (low
sample). LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration at which measured total error
is less than the pre-defined total allowable error. The results are summarized in the
table below:

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP-7A2. Various
concentrations of interferents were spiked into two levels (low and high) of each
analyte. Testing was performed in singlet per level using 3 GEM Premier 5000
analyzers. The sponsor’s definition of non-significant interference for each analyte
was as follows:
