E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The BC-5390 Auto Hematology Analyzer is a quantitative, automated hematology
analyzer and leukocyte differential counter for in vitro diagnostic use in clinical
laboratories. It is only to be used by trained medical professionals to identify the normal
patient, with all normal system-generated parameters, and to flag or identify patient
results that require additional studies. The analyzer provides analysis results for 21
parameters of human blood and three histograms and one scattergram. The BC-5390
Auto Hematology Analyzer system consists of the following components:
- Sample processing unit (SPU) and Data Managing Unit (DMU)
- M-53D DILUENT
- M-5LEO(I) LYSE
- M-5LEO(II) LYSE
- M-53LH LYSE
- Probe Cleanser
- BC-5D Hematology Control (K160606)
- SC-CAL PLUS Hematology Calibrator (K955925)
2. Principles of Operation:
The BC-5390 Auto Hematology Analyzer (hereafter referred to as BC-5390) uses the
electrical impedance method to count and measure the size of WBC, RBC, BAS, and
1

--- Page 2 ---
PLT in human whole blood. The WBC, BAS, RBC and PLT parameters are counted in a
dedicated channel using the measurement of changes in electrical resistance (i.e.,
electrical impedance method). These blood cells are suspended in a conductive diluent as
the cells pass through an aperture of known dimensions. As each cell passes through the
aperture, the change in resistance produces an electrical pulse. The number of generated
electrical pulses signal the number of particles (cells) passing the aperture; whereas the
amplitude of each pulse is proportional to the volume of each particle. HGB is
determined by the colorimetric method, which is measurable at 530-535 nm. The BC-
5390 measures the leukocyte differential (Neu, Lym, Mon, Eos) by flow cytometry. As
the cells pass through the flow cell they are exposed to a laser beam. The intensity of the
light scatter reflects the cell size and intracellular density.
3. Modes of Operation:
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes ___X___ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ________ or No ___X____
4. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification is manual entry by keyboard or barcode reader, or automated
identification by barcode scanner.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The BC-5390 supports three different analysis modes: autoloader whole blood mode,
closed whole blood mode, and predilute mode. To analyze a sample in the closed
predilute mode, the sample is first manually diluted (20µL of venous or capillary whole
blood and 180 µL of diluent) then well-mixed according to the BC-5390 Operator’s
Manual and presented uncapped to the sample compartment for aspiration. To analyze a
sample in the closed whole blood mode, the operator manually presents the sample to the
sample compartment. For the autoloader whole blood mode, the operator loads closed
tubes into a tube rack (with the respective tube adapter); when analysis begins, the BC-
5390 pierces the tube cap and aspirates the sample. All samples processed in each mode
should be well-mixed and processed according to the BC-5390 Operator’s Manual.
6. Calibration:
Calibration and verification of calibration with the use of the SC-CAL PLUS calibrator is
performed by automated or manual method according to the instructions for use, laboratory
procedures, and local or national regulations.

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Method Comparison
Method comparison studies were performed at three clinical sites (one site in U.S.
and two sites in China) to assess the performance of the BC-5390 analyzer compared
to the Sysmex XE-2100 using a total of 1,531 native venous whole blood samples
collected in K EDTA. The study population consisted of 57.1% males and 42.6%
2
females including pediatric (i.e. neonates, infants, children, and adolescents) and
adult subjects up to 100 years of age. The gender for 0.3% of the study population (5
samples) was reported as unknown. In addition to healthy individuals, subjects with
the following clinical conditions were included in the studies: acute
inflammation/bacterial infection, chronic inflammation, parasitic infection/allergic
reaction, viral infections, lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute
myeloblastic leukemia (AML), chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL), chronic
myeloblastic leukemia (CML), plasma cell leukemia, other unidentified leukemias,
severe anemia, myeloproliferative disorders, aplastic anemia, HIV (human
immunodeficiency virus), macrocytic anemia, microcytic/hypochromic anemias, and
normocytic/normochromic anemias. Each whole blood sample was analyzed in
duplicate on the BC-5390 and Sysmex XE-2100 analyzers.
Deming regression and weighted Deming regression were used to estimate the
parameters of the regression model (slope, intercept, 95% confidence intervals and
correlation coefficient) according to CLSI EP09-A3. Weighted Deming regression
was used for the WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT parameters. Deming regression was
used for the following parameters: HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW-CV, RDW-SD,
Neu#, Lym#, Mon#, Eos#, Bas#, Neu%, Lym%, Mon%, Eos%, and Bas%. Bias
between the BC-5390 and Sysmex XE-2100 was calculated from the regression line
at multiple clinical evaluation points for each parameter. Confidence limits of bias
estimates were calculated based on standard errors of bias and 95% confidence. In
addition, the mean difference and percent differences for each parameter at the
defined clinical evaluation points were calculated. The Bland-Altman (difference)
plots and 95% limits of agreement (LOA), and the hypothesis test to the slope and
intercept were analyzed by statistical software. The estimated average bias for each
parameter was provided for each clinical site and for all sites combined.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision performance of the BC-5390 was evaluated by performing a repeatability
study at one clinical laboratory site with three analyzers and three operators and
reproducibility studies across three clinical laboratory sites.
The repeatability study was conducted at one external clinical laboratory site using
multiple operators and three BC-5390 analyzers over multiple operating days.
Residual native whole blood samples collected in K EDTA collection tubes were
2
selected within the defined ranges and around medical decision points per CLSI H26-
A2. Each sample was analyzed 10 consecutive times in the closed whole blood
CBC+DIFF and predilute CBC+DIFF modes.
To obtain measures of reproducibility imprecision (%CV and SD), three levels of
commercial quality control (single lot) were analyzed over 20 operating days, two
runs per day and two replicates per run across three sites (one analyzer per site). To
further demonstrate precision performance %CV and SD of within-run, between-run,
between-day, and within-device were calculated per site and for the combined sites as
shown below.

c. Linearity:
The linear ranges for the WBC and PLT parameters were established by testing two
different sample sets (for each parameter with a wide overlap) prepared by diluting
FDA cleared commercially available linearity materials to span the analytical
measuring range (AMR). For each sample set, seven proportional dilutions were
prepared (0%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%). Three replicates were
performed for each theoretical concentration on three different BC-5390 analyzers in
the closed mode.
The linear ranges for the RBC, HGB, and HCT parameters were established by
testing diluted samples prepared from native whole blood. For each parameter, seven
proportional dilutions were prepared (0%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%).
Three replicates were performed for each dilution on two different BC-5390
analyzers in the closed mode.
Polynomial regression analyses for the first, second and third-order polynomials were
performed for each evaluated parameter.

HGB (g/dL) 0.5–25.0
HCT (%) 2.0–75.0
PLT (x103/µL) 5–2000
d. Carryover:
Carryover studies for the WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, and PLT parameters were
conducted using high target value (HTV) and low target value (LTV) contrived native
whole blood samples. Testing was conducted to evaluate the carryover of whole
blood within-mode, predilute within-mode, and mode-to-mode.
For within-mode carryover, the following combinations were evaluated: whole blood
CBC+DIFF to whole blood CBC+DIFF and predilute CBC+DIFF to predilute
CBC+DIFF. For mode-to-mode carryover, the following combinations were
evaluated: whole blood CBC+DIFF to whole blood CBC mode, whole blood
CBC+DIFF to predilute CBC+DIFF mode, whole blood CBC+DIFF to predilute

CBC mode, predilute CBC+DIFF to predilute CBC mode, predilute CBC+DIFF to
whole blood CBC+DIFF, and predilute CBC+DIFF to whole blood CBC mode.
For each of the mode-to-mode and within-mode combinations the HTV samples (H1,
H2, and H3) were aspirated and analyzed three times consecutively followed by three
aspirations of the LTV samples (L1, L2, and L3). Carryover % was determined using
the following calculation: % Carryover = 10 (LTV1−LTV3) / (HTV3−LTV3) × 100.
The results of the carryover study were within the predefined specifications of ≤ 1.0%
for WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT and PLT.
e. Interfering Substances:
Interfering substance studies were performed for the following: bilirubin,
hemoglobin, triglycerides, high WBC, and high PLT. Whole blood samples
(K EDTA) within the defined reference ranges were spiked with each interferent at
2
different concentrations.
There was no significant bilirubin interference up to a concentration 500 mg/L for the
following parameters: WBC, Neu#, Lym#, Mon#, Eos#, Bas#, Neu%, Lym%, Mon%,
Eos%, Bas%, RBC, HCT, MCV, RDW-CV, RDW-SD, PLT and MPV parameters.

for the following parameters: WBC, Neu#, Lym#, Mon#, Eos#, Bas#, Neu%, Lym%,
Mon%, Eos%, Bas%, RBC, HCT, MCV, RDW-CV, RDW-SD, PLT and MPV
parameters. There was no significant hemoglobin interference up to a concentration
751 mg/dL for the HGB parameter; up to a concentration 693 mg/dL for the MCH
parameter; and up to a concentration of 677 mg/dL for the MCHC parameter.
There was no significant triglyceride interference up to a concentration of 29.4
mmol/L for the HCT and MCV parameters. There was no significant triglyceride
interference up to a concentration of 20 mmol/L for the HGB and MCH parameters
and up to a concentration of 25 mmol/L for the MCHC parameter.
There was no significant interference observed for WBC up to a concentration of
183.72 x 103/µL for the following parameters: HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, and MCHC.
There was no significant interference observed for PLT up to a concentration of 1809
x 103/µL for the following parameters: HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, and MCHC.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Specimen Stability
To evaluate sample stability for the whole blood mode (closed and autoloader) a
combination of freshly collected whole blood samples drawn from patients and
residual whole blood samples from clinical laboratory sites were analyzed. The
11

--- Page 12 ---
sample size totaled 54 specimens spanning the defined analytical measurement range
for the WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT parameters in addition to clinical evaluation
points for other measurands. Aliquots were prepared and stored at the defined
condition for each specimen, then analyzed in duplicate at different time points
according to the study design. The sample stability for all measurands analyzed in
the whole blood mode at room temperature (18–26°C) and refrigerated temperature
(2–8°C) was established at 24 hours and 36 hours from the time of collection
respectively.
Sample stability for the closed predilute mode was evaluated using a total of 35
residual whole blood samples spanning the defined analytical measurement range for
the WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT parameters in addition to clinical evaluation points
for other measurands. Aliquots were prepared and stored at the defined condition for
each specimen, then analyzed in duplicate at different time points according to the
study design. The sample stability at room temperature for all measurands was
established at 25 minutes from the time of sample preparation (dilution).
Acceptance criteria for each parameter was established for defined time intervals at
each storage condition as the difference between the recovery of the measurand at
defined time points and time point zero (T0). The acceptance criteria were met for
each claimed storage condition: 25 minutes for prediluted samples, 24 hours for
whole blood samples stored at room temperature (18–26°C) and 36 hours for whole
blood samples stored at refrigerated temperature (2–8°C).
b. Sample Matrix Comparison
To demonstrate matrix equivalency of capillary whole blood to venous whole blood,
a matrix comparison study was conducted using 57 paired samples collected in
K EDTA. The samples were selected to cover the analytical measurement range of
2
the WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT parameters in addition to the medical decision levels
of other measurands. Deming and weighted Deming approaches were used to
estimate the parameters of the regression model (slope, intercept, 95% confidence
intervals and correlation coefficient) according to CLSI EP09-A3. Confidence limits
of bias estimates were calculated based on standard errors of bias and 95%
confidence intervals. The results of the Deming and weighted Deming regression
analyses and bias between the paired samples on the BC-5390 analyzer met the
defined acceptance criteria for all parameters.
c. Mode Comparison
To demonstrate sample equivalency between the whole blood mode and predilute
mode, a comparison study was conducted using 124 residual samples collected in
K EDTA. The samples were selected to cover the analytical measuring range of the
2
WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT parameters in addition to the medical decision levels of
other measurands.
12

For the comparison of the CBC whole blood mode to the CBC+DIFF whole blood
mode, a total of 103 samples were analyzed in duplicate in each mode. Similarly, for
the comparison between the CBC predilute and the CBC+DIFF predilute modes, a
total of 75 samples were analyzed in duplicate in each mode. The samples were
selected to cover the analytical measurement ranges of the WBC, RBC, HGB, and
PLT parameters in addition to clinical evaluation points of the other parameters.
Deming and weighted Deming approaches were used to estimate the parameters of
the regression model (slope, intercept, 95% confidence intervals and correlation
coefficient) according to CLSI EP09-A3. Results for each comparison and parameter
met the defined acceptance criteria.
d. Anticoagulant Comparison
To demonstrate equivalency between samples collected in K EDTA versus those
3
collected in K EDTA, a comparison study was conducted using 70 paired samples
2
collected in K EDTA and K EDTA. The samples were selected to cover the normal
2 3
range and medical decision levels for all measurands. Deming and weighted Deming
approaches were used to estimate the parameters of the regression model (slope,
intercept, 95% confidence intervals and correlation coefficient) according to CLSI
EP09-A3. Results for each comparison and parameter met the defined acceptance
criteria.
e. Limits of Detection, Blank, and Quantitation (LoD, LoB, and LoQ)
Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined using five blank samples containing the
predilute solution (diluent). Each blank sample was analyzed 12 times in the whole
blood and predilute modes on three BC-5390 analyzers at one clinical laboratory site.
To determine the Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ), five low
level samples were derived from native whole blood. Each low level sample was
analyzed 12 times in the whole blood and predilute modes on three BC-5390
analyzers at one clinical laboratory site.

g. Adult Reference Intervals
The adult reference interval for each BC-5390 parameter was established by
analyzing whole blood samples collected in K EDTA from a total population of 251
2
healthy individuals (N=121 males, and N=130 females) representative of the United
