Fecal Calprotectin Immunological Test Systems
L. Test Principle:
Calprest®NG is a colorimetric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The test is
performed on stool samples collected without preservatives. An extract is prepared by
combining the stool sample with extraction buffer and mixing for 30 minutes followed by
centrifugation. The assay uses a polyclonal rabbit antibody against calprotectin as the
capture antibody. Calprotectin present in the diluted stool extract sample is bound by the
antibody adsorbed onto the surface of the microtiter plate. HRP-conjugated antibodies bind
to the captured calprotectin. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of the substrate (TMB) to
a colored product and the optical density (OD) at 450 nm of the sample is read on an ELISA
plate reader. The intensity of the color is proportional to the amount of conjugate bound, and
thus to the amount of captured calprotectin. The concentration of calprotectin in the
extracted sample is interpreted from a standard curve generated from the six calibrators and
converted to mg of calprotectin per kg of stool using a conversion factor supplied in the
package insert.

1. Analytical performance: All results presented below were within the sponsor’s pre-
determined acceptance criteria for each study.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision: The precision of the Calprest®NG assay was evaluated by extracting seven
stool samples containing various concentration of calprotectin. Each extracted
sample was tested in duplicate, two runs per day for 10 days by three different
operators using one lot of reagent (total of 120 replicates per sample). The results are
summarized in the table below

Reproducibility: The lot-to-lot reproducibility was done by extracting four stool
samples with calprotectin concentrations of 64.7, 259.2, 778.2, and 2005.2 mg/kg.
Each extracted sample was tested in replicates of five using three different lots of the
reagents. Mean and %CV for each sample were calculated and %CV values for
between-lot reproducibility were 3.1%–7.3% for all samples.
The site-to-site reproducibility was evaluated by testing a total of eight stool samples
at three sites. The samples were run in replicates of five per day for five days at each
site, and a total of 75 data points were generated for each sample. Data were
analyzed for within-run, between-run, within-site, between site and total
reproducibility. The results are summarized in the table below:

The extraction reproducibility was evaluated by using four stool samples with
calprotectin concentrations of 29.6, 52.7, 227.0, and 1973.3 mg/kg. Each stool
sample was extracted 10 times and each stool extract was tested in duplicate. The
%CVs for these four stool samples are 14.6%, 11.1%, 6.8%, and 5.9%, respectively.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity: The linearity of Calprest®NG was evaluated according to the CLSI
guideline EP6-A. Four sample dilution series each with nine dilution levels were
prepared by serially diluting the high concentration stool extract sample pools with
the low concentration stool extract sample pools. Each dilution was tested in
triplicate. The results are summarized as follows:
Sample Range Slope Intercept R2 %

(0.99–1.04) (-26.54–45.10)
The Calprest®NG is linear for the claimed measuring range of 27.1–3000 mg/kg.
Accuracy/Recovery study: Extracts from seven stool samples were each spiked with
the calibrator material. For the recovery of spiked samples expected to be lower than
300 mg/kg, Calprest®NG Calibrator S2 (2.5 ng/ml, 50 mg/kg) was used; for the
recovery of spiked samples expected to be higher than 300 mg/kg, sample diluent was
used to compensate for volume adjustments made to the calprotectin-spiked extracts.
Each of the spiked extracts was then assayed in triplicate and results are shown in
table below.

Traceability: There is no international reference material for calprotectin. The
calibrators and controls are manufactured using an approved reference lot which is
traceable to the internal reference material cleared in K130945.
The calibrator S6, prepared from the master stock solution, was used to make the
calibrators and controls. New lots of the calibrator set and controls were value
assigned and validated by a comparison against an approved lot of calibrators and
controls in three different assay runs and further testing with a panel of 12 internal
quality control samples. The target values for calibrators are 0, 2.5, 12.5, 25, 50, and
150 ng/mL. The target values for controls range from 10–20 ng/mL for the Low
Control and from 30–70 ng/mL for the High Control.
Stability:
Kit stability: The real time stability was performed using three lots of kits (including
calibrators and controls) stored at 2–8°C. Data were collected at time points of 0, 1,
6, 12, 15, 18 months. The accelerated stability study was performed by using three
lots of kits stored at 37°C for four weeks. The results support stability of the kits
under the recommended storage of 2–8°C for up to 12 months.
Open vial stability: The study was done to evaluate the reagent stability after
opening. Three kit lots of Calprest®NG were stored at 2–8°C after first opening. The
study results support that the reagents are stable once opened for up to 30 days when
stored at 2–8°C.
Working solutions stability: The study was done to evaluate the stability of working
solutions including dilution buffer, washing buffer and extraction solution. The 1X
working solution for each buffer was prepared and stored at 2–8°C. Data were
collected at different time points. The results support up to 30 days stability for 1X
dilution buffer and extraction buffer and three months stability for 1X washing buffer.
Sample stability: Sample stability was established per K130945. Five stool samples
which cover the measuring range were stored at 2-8°C up to seven days. Data were
collected at time points of 0, 2, 4, 7 days. The results support that stability of stool
sample stored at 2–8°C up to four days.
Analyte (Calprotectin) stability: The study was done to determine the stability of
extracted stool samples when stored -20°C. The study supports that the stool extracts
are stable up to three months when stored at -20°C.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) was determined by assaying five blank samples with 12
replicates per sample to generate 60 total replicates. LoB was calculated as the 95th
percentile using the non-parametric method. The LoB value was determined to be
17.5 mg/kg.
7

--- Page 8 ---
The limit of detection (LoD) was determined by assaying five extracted stool samples
with low calprotectin level with 12 replicates per sample to generate 60 total
replicates. The LoD value was calculated as the LoB + 1.645 x SD of the replicates
for the low level samples and was determined to be 23.4 mg/kg.
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was determined based on the LoD test results. The
low level extracted stool samples were tested on a reference method (Calprest) to
obtain bias and calculate Total Error (TE). The LoQ was determined as 27.1 mg/kg
with the TE of 10.5 mg/kg.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI guideline EP07-A2 using five
pooled stool samples. The pooled samples included two high positives (with
calprotectin concentrations of 2068.6 mg/kg and 674.7 mg/kg), one moderate positive
(256.0 mg/kg), one sample within borderline range (79.3 mg/kg) and one negative
(37.2 mg/kg). For non-interference to be claimed, the % recovery of the spiked
sample should be within 95–105% of the neat sample. Stool samples were tested for
potential interference by:
Microorganisms: The data demonstrated that Calprest® was not affected by
Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and Yersinia
spp. at cell counts of 1.5 x 107 cfu/ml in stool samples.
Drugs and Nutrients: The data demonstrated that Calprest®NG was not affected by
the following oral pharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements: Vancomycin (0.67
mg/50 mg stool); Ciprofloxacin HCL (0.50 mg/50 mg stool); Prevacid (0.02 mg/50
mg stool); Azathioprine (0.07 mg/50 mg stool); Prednisone (0.01 mg/50 mg stool);
Pentasa (1.33 mg/50 mg stool); Asacol (1.33 mg/50 mg stool); multiple vitamin
(Vitamin D: 1.1 U/50 mg stool, Vitamin A: 8.0 U/50 mg stool, Vitamin C: 0.05
mg/50 mg stool), and Vitamin E (0.10 mg/50 mg stool). The concentration level of
tested drugs and nutrients was sufficient to reflect the average concentration to be
expected in a patient’s stool.
Hemoglobin: The results showed that the addition of hemoglobin into the stool
samples at level of 5.83 mg/50 mg stool did not interfere with Calprest®NG.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off for Calprest®NG is as follows:
Calprotectin (mg/kg) Interpretation Suggested follow-up
< 27.1–50 Normal None
50–120 Borderline Re-evaluate at 4–6 weeks
> 120 Abnormal Repeat as clinically indicated.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 182 stool samples including 123 samples from patients diagnosed with IBD
(Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), intermediate colitis (IC), suspected IBD,
and diversion disease) and 59 samples from patients with IBS, chronic diarrhea,
recurrent abdominal pain (RAP), celiac disease, and other conditions were assayed
using Calprest®NG and the predicate device Calprest® in accordance with the
instructions for use in the package inserts. From the total sample size of 182, results
for 157 samples were within the measuring ranges of both assays. The regression
analysis of the results comparing the Calprest®NG and the predicate Calprest® is
shown below:
N Range Slope (95% CI) Intercept (95% CI) Correlation
(mg/kg) Coefficient
157 15.60–494.57 0.92 (0.84–1.01) 0.13 (-4.64–4.90) 0.84
The observed low correlation coefficient of the regression analysis is likely due to the
different detection antibody and detection system used for the Calprest NG and the
predicate.
Additional method comparison analysis was performed using the cut-offs of both
assays. The results are shown below:

a. Clinical Sensitivity and specificity
The 273 stool samples used in the clinical validation for the Calprest®NG assay
include 130 samples from patients diagnosed with IBD and 143 samples from patients
with IBS and other diseases/conditions with gastrointestinal symptoms. Among the
130 IBS samples, 71 were from patients diagnosed with Crohn’s disease including six
samples from patients in remission, 41 were from patients diagnosed with UC
including seven samples from patients in remission, 12 were from patients with IC,
and six were from patients with diversion disease. The patients with IBD were
diagnosed by clinical findings and/or confirmed with colonoscopy. Among 143 non-
IBD samples, 51 samples were from patients diagnosed with IBS and 92 samples
from patients with chronic diarrhea, RAP, celiac disease and other non-IBD
conditions. The patients with IBS were defined based on the Rome III diagnostic
criteria. The clinical performance of Calprest®NG was evaluated for sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). The
results are summarized in the following tables:

Røseth et al. (1992)*.
Ninety-two samples from normal healthy people and 42 samples from patients with CD,
UC, IBS, and IC were tested with Calprest® to validate the reference range value. The
results showed that 89 out of 92 samples (96.7 %) from normal healthy people tested
negative and the remaining three samples fell in the range of 56.3–64.4 mg/kg. Of the 42
samples from patients with CD, UC, IBS and IC, 39 (92.9%) were tested positive by the
assay.
