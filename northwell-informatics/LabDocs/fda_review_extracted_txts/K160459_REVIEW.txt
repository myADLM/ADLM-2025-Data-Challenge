SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
OIR Decision Memorandum
To: BioFire Diagnostics, LLC RE: K160459
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own
Class II device requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device.
Trade Name: FilmArray Gastrointestinal (GI) Panel for use with FilmArray Torch
510(k) Number: K160459
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device, called
“FilmArray® Gastrointestinal (GI) Panel for use with FilmArray Torch”, as described in its
labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for
use, and package labeling.
Submitter states in the labeling, 510(k) Summary, and in the submission that the intended use of
the modified device has not changed from its predicate.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams, engineering
drawings, photographs, assay instruction and instrument operations manuals in sufficient detail
to demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device
has not changed.
The modifications of the FilmArray Torch comprise a reconfigured instrument to increase
throughput and reduce workspace. Changes include:
• a reconfigured base instrument tower with optional, stacked, individual, instrument modules,
• workflow altered for a manual read of the assay pouch bar-code by operator instead of
automatic read within instrument,
• automatic side-loading and ejection of the assay pouch instead of manual top-loading,
• printer optional instead of printer included,
• computer and touch screen integrated into the base tower instead of a separate computer,
• operation with kiosk-style software,
• labeling appended with additional operation procedure and with statements describing the
validation studies; these studies included an intra-laboratory precision study for the modified
device.
4. Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to applicant’s legally marketed predicate
device including, labeling, intended use, physical characteristics, and software is shown in the
table below.

FilmArray 2.0 (K143005) Indications for use (same as K160459):
The FilmArray Gastrointestinal (GI) Panel is a qualitative multiplexed nucleic acid-based in vitro
diagnostic test intended for use with FilmArray systems. The FilmArray GI Panel is capable of the
simultaneous detection and identification of nucleic acids from multiple bacteria, viruses, and
parasites directly from stool samples in Cary Blair transport media obtained from individuals with
signs and/or symptoms of gastrointestinal infection. The following bacteria (including several
diarrheagenic E. coli/Shigella pathotypes), parasites, and viruses are identified using the FilmArray
GI Panel:
• Campylobacter (C. jejuni/C. coli/C. upsaliensis)
• Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxin A/B

The FilmArray GI Panel is indicated as an aid in the diagnosis of specific agents of gastrointestinal
illness and results are meant to be used in conjunction with other clinical, laboratory, and
epidemiological data. Positive results do not rule out co-infection with organisms not included in the
FilmArray GI Panel. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of the disease.
Concomitant culture is necessary for organism recovery and further typing of bacterial agents.
This device is not intended to monitor or guide treatment for C. difficile infection.
Due to the small number of positive specimens collected for certain organisms during the
prospective clinical study, performance characteristics for E. coli O157, Plesiomonas shigelloides,
Yersinia enterocolitica, Astrovirus, and Rotavirus A were established primarily with retrospective
clinical specimens.
Performance characteristics for Entamoeba histolytica, and Vibrio (V. parahaemolyticus, V.
vulnificus, and Vibrio cholerae) were established primarily using contrived clinical specimens.
Negative FilmArray GI Panel results in the setting of clinical illness compatible with gastroenteritis
may be due to infection by pathogens that are not detected by this test or non-infectious causes
such as ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or Crohn’s disease.
A gastrointestinal microorganism multiplex nucleic acid-based assay also aids in the detection and
identification of acute gastroenteritis in the context of outbreaks.
5. A Design Control Activities Summary was present which includes:
4

--- Page 5 ---
Page 5 of 7
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on
the device and its components, and the results of the analysis.
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities
required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.
This submission utilizes on the same Software and Firmware as that reviewed in BioFire Special
510(k) submission (K160068).
To validate the modified device, an intra-laboratory precision study was conducted. Results of
precision testing on the FilmArray Torch systems indicate that all analytes in the device intended
use were detected in at least 95% of the samples tested. Analytes were evaluated at 1x LoD as
established on the FilmArray 2.0.
In addition to analyte detection, the precision of FilmArray GI Tm (melting temperature) results
on FilmArray Torch was evaluated. The standard deviation in Tm for each assay on each of
the three FilmArray Torch systems and overall (all systems/Modules) met the acceptance
criteria of 0.5˚C or less.
Method comparison studies with different types of samples were conducted for the modified
device (FilmArray Torch with GI Panel) and its predicate device (FilmArray 2.0 with GI Panel).
These included a synthetic template method comparison study, a negative sample method
comparison study, and a representative organism method comparison study. For all studies, the
positive agreement was ≥95% and the negative agreement was 100%.
c) Declaration of Conformity to Design Controls
A “Declaration of Conformity” statement was submitted for the BioFire Diagnostics, LLC
manufacturing facility. It was signed by the Vice President, Regulated Products and Clinical
Affairs, and the Director of Quality Assurance. The statements indicate that:
i. “To the best of my knowledge, the verification activities for the modification were
performed by the designated individual(s) and the results demonstrated that the
predetermined acceptance criteria were met.”
ii. “The manufacturing facility, BioFire Diagnostics, LLC, is in conformance with the
design control requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are
available for review.”
6. Conclusion
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended
use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the
particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified
devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter
has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this
basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared
device.
