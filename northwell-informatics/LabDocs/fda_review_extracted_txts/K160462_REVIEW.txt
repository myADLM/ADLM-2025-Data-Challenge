SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
OIR Decision Memorandum
To: BioFire Diagnostics, LLC RE: K160462
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own
Class II device requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:
1. The name and de novo application number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device.
Trade Name: FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) Panel for use with the FilmArray and
FilmArray 2.0 systems
De Novo Application: DEN150013
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device, called
“FilmArray® Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel for use with FilmArray systems,” as described in its
labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for
use, package labeling.
Submitter states in the 510(k) Summary and in the submission that the intended use of the
modified device has not changed from its predicate. The intended use of the modified device
remains the same in the labeling.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams, engineering
drawings, photographs, user’s and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the
FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.
The modifications made to the FilmArray 2.0 system to configure the FilmArray Torch
aimed to increase throughput capacity and benchtop workspace through single tower
housing. Changes include:
• a reconfigured base instrument tower with optional, stacked, individual instrument modules,
• workflow altered for a manual read of the assay pouch’s bar-code by the operator instead of
automatic read within instrument,
• automatic edge-loading mechanism is used to load hydration reagents and clinical samples
instead of a manual top-loading technique,
• automatic partial ejection of the assay pouch following conclusion of a run rather than
manual removal of the pouch,
• printer is optional instead of included with the system,
• computer, barcode scanner, and touch screen interface integrated into the base of the tower
configuration instead of a separate computer set-up,
• operation with kiosk-style (touch-screen) software,
• labeling appended with an additional operational procedure and with statements describing
the validation/verification studies (i.e. LoD and reproducibility); these studies included an
intra-laboratory precision study for the modified device.
4. Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to applicant’s legally marketed predicate
device including, labeling, intended use, physical characteristics, and software is shown in the
table below.

FilmArray 2.0 (K160462) Indications for use (same as DEN150013):
The FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) Panel is a qualitative multiplexed nucleic acid-based
in vitro diagnostic test intended for use with FilmArray systems. The FilmArray ME Panel is
capable of simultaneous detection and identification of multiple bacterial, viral, and yeast nucleic
acids directly from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens obtained via lumbar puncture from
individuals with signs and/or symptoms of meningitis and/or encephalitis. The following
organisms are identified using the FilmArray ME Panel: Escherichia coli K1, Haemophilus
influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Neisseria meningitidis (encapsulated), Streptococcus
agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Cytomegalovirus, Enterovirus, Herpes simplex virus 1,

The FilmArray ME Panel is indicated as an aid in the diagnosis of specific agents of meningitis
and/or encephalitis and results are meant to be used in conjunction with other clinical,
epidemiological, and laboratory data. Results from the FilmArray ME Panel are not intended to
be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions.
Positive results do not rule out co-infection with organisms not included in the FilmArray ME
Panel. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of the disease. Negative results do not
preclude central nervous system (CNS) infection. Not all agents of CNS infection are detected
by this test and sensitivity in clinical use may differ from that described in the package insert.
The FilmArray ME Panel is not intended for testing of specimens collected from indwelling CNS
medical devices.
The FilmArray ME Panel is intended to be used in conjunction with standard of care culture for
organism recovery, serotyping, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on
the device and its components, and the results of the analysis
A risk analysis of the modifications made to reconfigure the FilmArray 2.0 system into the
integrated tower configuration of the FilmArray Torch was successfully completed in the
context of 21 CFR 807.81 and the appropriate guidance. Reconfiguration of the platform did
not alter the performance or capabilities of the device when run with the FilmArray ME Panel.
Risk management of the FilmArray Torch Software and Firmware followed processes that
were compliant with ISO 14971:2012.
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities
required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied
In order to both validate and verify the FilmArray ME Panel for use on the FilmArray Torch,
studies were completed to address risks associated with false negative, false positive, and
delayed or no results. An intra-laboratory precision study was conducted between three
FilmArray Torch systems (containing three Torch modules within each system for a total of 9
FilmArray Torch Modules per sample) and three sets of three FilmArray 2.0 instruments for a
total of 9 FilmArray instruments. Results demonstrated that all analytes in the FilmArray ME
Panel (at 1x LOD) were detected in at least 95% of the samples tested on both platforms.
100% of “Not Detected” results were observed for all analytes in the negative samples tested
with the exception of H. influenzae that demonstrated a 98.3% agreement with the expected
negative result. Additionally, melting temperature values were evaluated among the systems
and results fell within the acceptance criteria of a standard deviation of +0.5°C or less for
each target (known system variation on the FilmArray).
Method comparison studies were conducted for the modified device (FilmArray Torch with
ME Panel) and its predicate device (FilmArray 2.0 with ME Panel). These included a
synthetic template method comparison study, a negative sample method comparison study,
and a representative organism method comparison study. For all studies, the positive
agreement was ≥95% and the negative agreement was 100%.

An additional study was completed using the WHO International Standard for Human
Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) for Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques on the FilmArray and
FilmArray 2.0 systems. The standard was tested at the previously established LoD
concentration. When testing samples containing the WHO CMV standard, CMV was
detected by the FilmArray ME Panel in 100% of the replicates tested at the confirmed LoD
concentration on both FilmArray systems. This information was included in the revised
package insert.
c) Declaration of Conformity with Design Controls
A “Declaration of Conformity” statement was submitted for the BioFire Diagnostics, LLC
manufacturing facility. It was signed by the Vice President, Regulated Products and Clinical
Affairs, and the Director of Quality Assurance. The statements indicate that:
i. “To the best of my knowledge, the verification activities, as required by the risk
analysis, for the modification were performed by the designated individual(s) and the
results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance criteria were met.”
ii. “The manufacturing facility, BioFire Diagnostics, LLC, is in conformance with the
design control requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are
available for review.”
6. Conclusion
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the
indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the
submitter’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between
the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has
not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New
510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially
equivalent to the previously cleared device.
