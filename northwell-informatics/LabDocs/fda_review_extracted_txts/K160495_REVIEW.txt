2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A comparison study was performed to demonstrate equivalence between results for
samples delivered to the VITROS System analyzers via the VITROS Automation
Solutions (on-track) and samples manually placing on the VITROS System analyzers
by the operator (off-tack). A total of 70 samples were tested for carbamazepine, 13
samples were spiked (18%) with a stock solution of carbamazepine using the
VITROS® 5,1 FS Chemistry System. A total of 55 native samples were tested for
gentamicin using the 5600 Integrated System and a total of 51 native samples and an
additional 6 diluted samples (10% spiked) were tested for Total T4 using the 3600
Immunodiagnostic System. The samples were split into pairs: one sample processed
through the VITROS Automation Solutions (on-track) and delivered to the VITROS
chemistry analyzer and the other was processed by manually loading directly to the
VITROS chemistry analyzers systems (off-track). The samples were tested in three
replicates per sample both on and off the track. The first replicate from each sample
was used to generate the regression statistics. The regression analysis for each assay
are summarized in the tables below:
Assay Sample Range N Slope Intercept R2
CRBM (µg/mL)
-0.0905 0.9796
(5,1 FS Chemistry 3.09 – 17.12 70 1.04
System)
GENT (µg/mL) 0.0075 0.0989
0.63 – 9.72 55 1.00

Total T4 (nmol/L) -1.1936 0.9969
12.70 – 288.70 57 1.01
(3600Immunodiagnostic)
b. Software/Hardware Verficaiton and Validation
FDA has reviewed the applicant’s software validation and verification documentation
for this product and found it to be acceptable.
