H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
HardyCHROM ESBL is a selective and differential chromogenic medium which is
intended for the qualitative and presumptive detection from stool specimens of: 1)
Enterobacteriaceae that are potentially non-susceptible to ceftazidime and cefpodoxime;
and 2) Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca.
The test is performed on stool specimens from patients at risk of harboring
Enterobacteriaceae that are non-susceptible to 3rd generation cephalosporins or ESBL-
producing E. coli, K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca, and is intended as an aid in the
detection, identification of colonization and control of these bacteria in a healthcare
setting. HardyCHROM ESBL is not intended to diagnose infection or to guide or monitor
treatment for infections. Results can be interpreted after incubation for 18-24 hours.
Subculture to non-selective medium is required for confirming identification,
antimicrobial susceptibility testing and epidemiological typing.
A lack of growth or the absence of pink, blue or yellow/gold colonies on HardyCHROM
ESBL does not preclude the presence of Enterobacteriaceae that are non-susceptible to
3rd generation cephalosporins or ESBL producing organisms.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
Do not incubate plates in a CO atmosphere.

L. Test Principle:
HardyCHROM ESBL is a selective and differential medium for the detection of bacteria
belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family that are non-susceptible to 3rd generation
cephalosporins, including those that produce Extended Spectrum b-Lactamases.
The selective components in HardyCHROM ESBL culture medium are designed to inhibit
the growth of yeasts and gram-positive bacteria, as well as gram-negative bacteria that are
sensitive to 3rd generation cephalosporins. Organisms that grow on HardyCHROM ESBL are
differentiated based on the metabolism of chromogenic substrates. ESBL-producing strains
of K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca exhibit blue colonies, whereas those of E. coli appear pink.

Colonies of Enterobacteriaceae that are non-susceptible to 3rd generation cephalosporins
may appear pink, blue or yellow/gold.
Testing is performed by direct inoculation of the stool onto the culture medium. Cultures are
read after incubation of the plates for 18-24 hours at 35-37°C in an aerobic atmosphere. All
presumptive cephalosporin non-susceptible and ESBL-producing isolates must be sub-
cultured for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing according to established
methods.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of results obtained with HardyCHROM ESBL was evaluated in a
study conducted at 3 sites using blinded panels comprised of duplicate suspensions of
10 strains of bacteria in transport medium. The panel members included five 3rd
generation cephalosporin non-susceptible strains of Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli (2),
Enterobacter cloacae (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), and Klebsiella oxytoca (1) at
103 CFU/mL) and five susceptible strains of bacteria (1 each of E. coli,
Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Shigella flexneri and Shigella
sonnei at 106 CFU/mL). The bacterial suspensions were prepared and shipped
overnight to the test sites on ice prior to each day of testing. At the test sites, a 10µL
loop of each bacterial suspension was used to inoculate a plate of HardyCHROM
ESBL culture medium, which was then incubated for 24 hours at 35°C prior to being
read by 2 independent operators. Cultures were inoculated on each of 5 days at each
site (2 replicates x 5 days x 2 operators x 3 sites = 60 results per strain). The results of
the study are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 according to the respective criteria for
detection of 3rd generation cephalosporin non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae and
ESBL-producing E. coli, K. pneumoniae/K. oxytoca.

Specimen Stability
A study was conducted to determine the acceptable duration of storage of stool
specimens prior to inoculation on HardyCHROM ESBL. Testing was performed with
“raw”, unpreserved stool and stool in Culture & Sensitivity (C&S) Medium
Transport. One strain each of ESBL-producing and 3rd generation cephalosporin non-
susceptible E. coli, K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca was included in the study. Each
species was used to seed 3 ESBL-negative stool specimens (raw or in transport
medium) which were then then stored at 2-8°C or ambient temperature (23-24°C). At
specified intervals, samples of each stool specimen were inoculated onto
HardyCHROM ESBL. Acceptable results were defined as recovery of the target
organism with <1 log decrease in colony counts compared to baseline. The
10
acceptance criteria were met for all 3 species in raw, unpreserved stool after storage
for up to 4 hours at ambient temperature or up to 168 hours (7 days) at 2-8°C. For
stool specimens diluted in C&S Medium, the acceptance criteria were met after
storage for up to 24 hours at ambient temperature and up to 7 days at 2-8°C.
Appropriate storage conditions for stool specimens prior to plating on HardyCHROM
ESBL are included in the Package Insert.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection
The analytical sensitivity of HardyCHROM ESBL was determined for two strains of
each of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca and E. cloacae (Table 4). Suspensions of
each organism were diluted in stool matrix and plated on HardyCHROM ESBL.
Parallel dilutions were also prepared in Tryptic Soy Broth/saline and plated on blood
agar. All culture plates were incubated aerobically at 35°C and read after 24 hours.
The LOD was estimated based on the highest dilution of the parental bacterial
suspension at which growth was visible on the HardyCHROM medium and assuming
a standard inoculum of 10µL stool per plate. The estimated LOD was verified by
testing 5 additional replicates of each bacterial strain at the LOD target level. For
each strain the LOD was estimated to be 103 CFU/mL stool (10 CFU/plate).

Analytical Reactivity/Inclusivity
The ability of HardyCHROM ESBL to recover potential ESBL-producing and/or 3rd
generation cephalosporin non-susceptible strains of E. coli, K. oxytoca and K.
pneumoniae was determined by testing a representative panel of strains with known
cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefpodoxime MICs, known genotypic resistance markers
and confirmed ESBL phenotypes. The study included a total of 54 ESBL producing
strains as shown in Table 5, all (100%) of which produced the expected colony color
on HardyCHROM ESBL when inoculated at a concentration of 10 CFU/plate. Fifty-
three of 54 strains (98.1%) were also non-susceptible to at least one 3rd generation
cephalosporin and produced colony colors on HardyCHROM ESBL that were
consistent with this phenotype.

these, 15 strains (71.4%) exhibited pink, blue or yellow-gold colonies on
HardyCHROM ESBL after incubation for 24 hours. Colonies of the remaining 6
strains (H. alvei (1), M. morganella (2), P. stuartii (2) and S. sonnei (1)) were
recovered but did not exhibit one of the expected colony colors. The potential to
obtain false negative results with HardyCHROM ESBL due to a lack of growth or
failure to develop the expected colony color is noted in the Intended Use and is
mitigated by including a Limitation in the device labeling (see Section H(3), above).
e. Analytical specificity:
The analytical specificity of HardyCHROM ESBL was evaluated by testing a panel
of organisms that are phylogenetically related to ESBL-producing species or that are
likely to be found in stool specimens. Testing was performed by streaking 10µL of a
108 CFU/mL suspension of each organism on HardyCHROM ESBL and incubating at
35°C for 24 hours. The organisms tested are listed in Tables 6 and 7 for
Enterobacteriaceae (n = 52) and non-Enterobacteriaceae (n = 47), respectively.
The majority of non-Enterobacteriaceae species did not grow on HardyCHROM
ESBL medium and none exhibited pink, blue or yellow/gold colonies. Of the
Enterobacteriaceae, 45/45 (100%) of those that were 3rd generation cephalosporin
non-susceptible either did not grow on HardyCHROM ESBL or produced colonies
that were not pink, blue or yellow/gold. Three carbapenem resistant and 3rd
generation cephalosporin non-susceptible strains (E. coli (1) and K. pneumoniae (2))
produced pink and blue colonies, as expected. Four strains (1 each of C. braakii, C.
freundii, E. cloacae and Y. kristensenii) that were non-susceptible to cefpodoxime
were not recovered on HardyCHROM ESBL. These results are mitigated by
including appropriate Limitations in the device labeling (see Section H(3), above).

Interfering Substances
A study was conducted to determine the ability to recover target organisms in the
presence of potentially interfering substances. In order to represent a “worst case”
scenario, the study was performed with representative strains of ESBL-producing
and/or 3rd generation cephalosporin non-susceptible E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K.
oxytoca, E. cloacae and P. mirabilis seeded into “raw”, unpreserved stool at levels
close to the LOD of HardyCHROM ESBL. The absence of interference was
determined by the recovery of each species with the expected colony color and <1
log reduction in colony count compared with a control condition without the
10
interfering substance. A list of the potentially interfering substances tested and their
concentrations is provided in Table 8. None of the substances was found to interfere

A study was performed to demonstrate the ability to discriminate ESBL-producing
target organisms from non-target species that are capable of growing on
HardyCHROM ESBL. Plates of HardyCHROM ESBL were inoculated with one
strain each of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca (~102 CFU/plate) in the presence
and absence of high concentrations (>106 CFU/plate) of various “co-infecting”
species that grew on HardyCHROM ESBL in the Analytical Specificity Study (Table

Table 9. Species of potentially interfering microorganisms included in the Interference
Study
Species Name
Candida guilliermondii Pediococcus acidilactici
Geotrichum candidum Providencia stuartii
Aspergillus sp. Acinetobacter baumannii
Penicillium rubens Pseudomonas fluorescens
Penicillium chrysogenum Stenotrophomonas maltophilia
All species listed had growth on HardyCHROM ESBL in the Analytical Specificity Study, although none
produced pink, blue or yellow-gold colonies
In the presence of high levels of Acinetobacter baumannii, the number of colonies E.
coli observed was substantially diminished compared to that obtained in the absence
of the interfering species. In addition, in the presence of A. baumannii and
Pseudomonas fluorescens, colonies of K. pneumoniae appeared smaller than those
grown under control conditions. No other anomalies were observed in the presence of
any of the potentially interfering microorganisms. The potential for an adverse effect
on the performance of HardyCHROM from the presence of high concentrations of A.
baumannii and P. fluorescens is mitigated by including a Limitation in the device
labeling.

Not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
Comparison of Fresh vs Frozen Stool
To enable use of frozen stool specimens for analytical testing, a study was performed
to compare the performance of HardyCHROM ESBL with fresh and frozen stool
matrix. Stool samples (raw or diluted 1:5 in Culture & Sensitivity Medium Transport,
Cary Blair Formula) were stored overnight at 2-8°C or frozen at -20°C, equilibrated
to ambient temperature and then inoculated with representative strains of ESBL-
producing and/or 3rd generation cephalosporin non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae. A
list of the organisms tested is provided in Table 10. An aliquot of each sample was
plated on HardyCHROM ESBL culture medium. The number and color of colonies
obtained were recorded after incubation of the culture plates for 18 and 24 hours. All
the organisms tested were successfully recovered with the expected colony color from
≥9/10 fresh or frozen stool samples. No important differences in colony counts
between cultures from fresh and frozen stool samples were observed. These results
support the use of frozen stool samples (raw or diluted in C&S Medium Transport,
Cary Blair Formula) for analytical testing.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The performance of HardyCHROM ESBL was evaluated in a prospective Clinical
Study conducted at three geographically diverse sites in the US. Recovery of ESBL-
producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae/K. oxytoca from stool samples on
HardyCHROM ESBL was compared to the results of a reference method comprised
of enrichment culture of stool in Trypticase Soy Broth containing ceftazidime
(1µg/mL) or cefotaxime (1µg/mL), followed by subculture to MacConkey agar. The
same study was also used to evaluate the performance of HardyCHROM ESBL for
recovery of cephalosporin non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae. Organisms that grew
on either MacConkey agar or HardyCHROM ESBL were identified by standard
methods. Cephalosporin susceptibility and confirmed ESBL phenotype were
determined using an FDA cleared MIC test and/or by disk diffusion according to
CLSI M100.
A total of 1,687 stool samples were enrolled in the study. Of these, 128 were
excluded from the analysis of performance due to protocol deviations. Isolates from a
total of 1,559 samples were included in the analysis of performance.
To supplement testing of prospectively collected clinical specimens, a total of 50
contrived specimens were also evaluated. These were prepared by spiking organisms
of known ESBL and cephalosporin susceptibility phenotype directly into stool matrix
at a concentration of 3 x 103 CFU/mL. The results obtained on HardyCHROM ESBL
were compared to those obtained by the same reference methods used for the
prospective clinical specimens.
Detection of 3rd Generation Cephalosporin Non-Susceptible Enterobacteriaceae
Prospectively Collected Clinical Specimens
The performance of HardyCHROM ESBL for recovery of 3rd generation
cephalosporin non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae from prospectively collected
clinical specimens is shown in Table 11. The same sensitivity and specificity were
observed when plates were read after 18 and 24 hours. Table 12 shows the agreement
