MN%/#, PMN%/#, and TC-BF# parameters in CSF, peritoneal, pleural and synovial fluids.
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Sysmex XN-L analyzer is a quantitative multi-parameter automated hematology
analyzer intended for in vitro diagnostic use in screening patient populations found in
clinical laboratories. The XN-L analyzer classifies and enumerates whole blood and body
fluid parameters by means of electrical impedance, laser light scattering, and fluorescent
labeling. Tests are performed on whole blood samples collected in K2 or K3 EDTA
anticoagulant and body fluids (peritoneal, pleural and synovial) collected in K2EDTA
anticoagulant and cerebrospinal fluid that is not collected in anticoagulant. The
instrument consists of two principal units: (1) Main Unit which will aspirate, dilute, mix,
and analyze whole blood and body fluid samples and (2) Pneumatic Unit which supplies
pressure and vacuum to the analyzer.
The XN-L has an external monitor with touch screen capability that is used to operate the
instrument and process data from the Main Unit. The monitor also allows operator
interfacing with the instrument by use of a panel keyboard
2. Principles of Operation:
The XN-L analyzer performs analysis using the following methods: DC Sheath Flow
1

--- Page 2 ---
Detection method, Flow Cytometry method using a semiconductor laser, and SLS
(cyanide-free sodium lauryl sulfate) hemoglobin method. Particle characterization and
identification is based on detection of forward scatter, fluorescence, and adaptive cluster
analysis. The XN-L analyzer automatically classifies cells from whole blood and body
fluids and carries out all processes automatically from aspiration of the sample to result
output.
3. Modes of Operation:
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes ___X____ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ________ or No ___X____
4. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification input is manual (by operator) or by barcode reader
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
There are two modes of sample introduction: (1) Sampler Mode; (2) Manual Mode. In the
Sampler Mode the operator loads the sample tubes into a rack, which is then
automatically transported and analyzed by the instrument. This mode automatically
mixes, aspirates, and analyzes samples without removing their caps. The Sampler Mode
is used for processing of whole blood samples. In the Manual Mode, there are two sample
tube holders: (1) Normal sample tube holder; (2) Micro collection tube holder. In this
mode the operator loads and mixes the samples tubes individually by hand. The samples
in the Manual Mode can be analyzed with the cap on or off. The Manual Mode is used
for processing whole blood and body fluid samples.
6. Calibration:
The XN CALTM calibrator (K160585) is used for calibration of the instrument for WBC,
RBC, HGB, HCT, PLT and RET. XN CAL is used for the calibration and calibration
verification of Sysmex XN series (XN-10, XN-11, XN-20, XN-21, XN-L) analyzers.
Calibration is performed as needed (e.g., when QC data is fluctuating) to ensure accuracy
of the system.
7. Quality Control:
The XN-L CHECK (K160586) is used as quality control (three levels) for Sysmex XN-L

Body Fluids
The body fluid method comparison study includes a total of 419 residual body fluids
samples (106 CSF, 103 pleural, 115 peritoneal, and 95 synovial) collected across
three U.S. sites. All samples were collected in K2EDTA anticoagulant with the
exception of CSF. All samples were run in the Body Fluid Mode in singlet on the
XN-10 and within 2 hours on the XN-L analyzer. Samples covered clinical medical
decision levels and, to the extent possible, the full reportable measuring ranges of the
XN-L analyzer. The samples are not representative of any specific patient population.
Patient demographics included age ranges from 1 month to 99 years of age comprised
of 213 males and 206 females. Detailed demographics of the data analysis are
provided in Table 20-40. The regression lines were calculated using Deming linear
regression analysis including 95% CI and estimates of the bias/difference for each
parameter was determined in accordance with the CLSI EP09-A3 approved guideline.
The Body Fluid Mode reports WBC-BF, RBC-BF, MN#/%, PMN#/%, and TC-BF#.
The TC-BF represents a total nucleated cell count and includes cells in the WBC-BF
+ HF-BF (high fluorescent) areas. The WBC-BF is a white blood cell count that
includes neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. As per
laboratory practice, manual counts for body fluids include macrophages as part of the
monocyte count. Cells such as mesothelial and lining cells are not included in the
WBC count.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability-Whole Blood
Within-run precision (repeatability) studies were performed in accordance with the
CLSI EP05-A3 approved guideline using residual K2EDTA whole blood samples
around medical decision levels and the upper and lower limit of the analytical
measuring range. Ten replicates of each sample were tested in the Whole Blood
Manual Mode at three clinical sites.
Reproducibility –Whole Blood
Reproducibility studies were performed to evaluate the within-run, between-run,
between-day, between-site, and total precision of the XN-L analyzer. Testing was
performed using 3 levels of each whole blood control material (XN-L CHECK and
XN CHECK). Each level was run in the Whole Blood Automated Sampling Mode in
duplicate twice each day for a minimum of 20 days using a single calibration and
reagent lot at each of the three test sites. The results were analyzed in accordance with
the CLSI EP05-A3 approved guideline and met the acceptance criteria as displayed in
the tables below.

Repeatability-Body Fluids
Within-run precision studies were performed at 3 clinical sites in accordance with the
CLSI EP05-A3 approved guideline using two high- and two low-residual body fluid
samples for CSF, pleural, peritoneal, and synovial fluids around medical decision
levels and the upper and lower limit of the analytical measuring range. Pleural,
peritoneal, and synovial fluids were collected in K2EDTA anticoagulant. Each
sample was run 10 consecutive times in the Body Fluid Mode at three clinical sites.
Reproducibility-Body Fluids
Precision studies were performed on the XN-L analyzer Body Fluid Mode using two
levels of quality control material (Level 1 and Level 2). Each level was run in
duplicate twice each day for a minimum of 20 days at each of the three test sites using
the control material (XN CHECK BF). The results were analyzed in accordance with
the CLSI EP05-A3 approved guideline.

c. Linearity:
Whole Blood
Linearity studies were performed in accordance with the CLSI EP06-A approved
guideline. Serial dilutions of known high concentrations control material which
spanned the full measuring range of all direct measured parameters (WBC, RBC,
HGB, PLT, HCT, RET) and related measurements, were aspirated in the Whole
Blood Automated Sampling Mode at three clinical sites. Each serial dilution was run
in duplicate.
Polynomial regression analyses for the first, second and third-order polynomials were
performed for each evaluated parameter.

d. Carryover:
Whole Blood
Carryover was evaluated by assaying whole blood K2EDTA samples with high
WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, and PLT counts three consecutive times (H1, H2, H3)
followed immediately by testing samples with low target values around medical
decision levels consecutively three times (L1, L2, L3) in accordance with CLSI H26-
A2. Three sets of carryover sequences were run for each measurand in the Whole
Blood Mode at three clinical sites.
Carryover formula:
(L1 –L3)
x100%
(H3 –L3)
Where: L1 is the first low sample analyzed;
L3 is the last low sample analyzed;
H3 is the last high sample analyzed.
The carryover results for the XN-L analyzermet the manufacturer’sspecifications.
Body Fluid
The carryover protocol was run in the Body Fluid Mode by assaying residual body
fluid samples with a high WBC-BF, TC-BF and RBC-BF count threeconsecutive
times (H1, H2, H3) followed immediately by testing samples with low target values
around medical decision levels consecutively threetimes (L1, L2, L3) in accordance
with the CLSI H26-A2 approved guideline. Three sets of carryover sequences were

Expert Panel on Cytometry, “Guidelines for the Evaluation of Blood Cell Analyzers”,
as demonstrated in the table below.
Where: L1 is the first low sample analyzed;
L3 is the last low sample analyzed;
H3 is the last high sample analyzed.
The carryover results for the XN-L analyzer met the manufacturer’s specifications.
e. Interfering Substances:
Interfering substances studies for Bilirubin C, Bilirubin F, Hemolytic Hemoglobin,
Lipemia (intralipid) and Chyle interferents were performed on the XN-L. A total of 6
whole blood K2EDTA samples were collected from three donors each. All tubes were
centrifuged and 150 μL of plasma removed from each. Each interferent was diluted to
(0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%) and then 150 μL of each dilution was added
to the centrifuged tubes (from a single donor). The tubes were mixed and measured
three consecutive times for WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, PLT, RET%/#, IRF, and RET-
He on the XN-L.
There was no significant Bilirubin F interference up to a concentration of 40.0 mg/dL
for WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, RET%/#, and RET-He parameters, up to a concentration
of 8.0 mg/dL for PLT parameter, and up to a concentration of 24.0 mg/dL for IRF
parameter.
There was no significant Bilirubin C interference up to a concentration of 42.2 mg/dL
for WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, PLT, RET%/#, and RET-He parameters. A significant
Bilirubin C interference was observed at a concentration of 8.4 mg/dL for IRF
parameter.
There was no significant hemolysis interference up to a concentration of
1018.0 mg/dL for WBC, RBC, HCT, PLT, RET%/#, and RET-He parameters, up to a
concentration of 203.6 mg/dL for HGB parameter. A significant hemolysis
interference was observed at a concentration of 203.6 mg/dL for IRF parameter.
There was no significant intralipid interference up to a concentration of 2.00 g/dL for
WBC, RBC, HCT, RET%/#, IRF, and RET-He parameters, up to a concentration of
20

1.00 g/dL for PLT and 1.00 g/dL IRF parameters, and up to a concentration of 0.2
g/dL for HGB parameter.
There was no significant chyle interference up to a concentration of 2800 FTU for
WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, RET%/#, IRF, and RET-He parameters and up to a
concentration of 1680 FTU for PLT parameter.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
A. Sample Stability
Whole Blood
The sample stability study for the XN-L analyzer was performed at one site using normal
and abnormal venous whole blood K2EDTA samples obtained within 8 hours of sample
collection. Aliquots were prepared for each specimen and stored at room temperature
(18–26°C) and refrigerated temperature (2–8°C). Refrigerated samples were allowed to
come to room temperature before testing. All samples were hand mixed by gentle
inversion 10 times and analyzed in duplicate at baseline (time zero), 8, 24 and 26 hours at
room temperature and baseline (time zero), 6, 12, 13, 48 and 50 hours at refrigerated
temperature in the Manual Whole Blood Mode.
Acceptance criteria for each parameter was established for defined time intervals at each
storage condition as the difference between the recovery of the measurand at defined time
points and time point zero (T0). The acceptance criteria were met for each claimed
storage condition: 24 hours for whole blood samples stored at room temperature (18–
26°C) and 48 hours for whole blood samples stored at refrigerated temperature (2–8°C).
Body Fluids
Body fluid short term stability was evaluated using a minimum of two different residual
CSF, pleural, peritoneal, and synovial fluids at one site. Pleural, peritoneal, and synovial
fluids were collected in K2EDTA anticoagulant and run in singlet in the Body Fluid
Mode. Each sample was carefully mixed by gentle hand inversion at least 10 times before
analyzing on the XN-L analyzer and tested at baseline (0 time), 1 hour , 2 hour, 4 hours, 6
hours, and 8 hours at room temperature (20–25°C).
Per established literature, body fluid samples should be stored at room temperature and
analyzed within 1 hour of collection.
B. Verification of Reference Intervals
Whole Blood – Adult
Verification of adult reference intervals testing was performed on the XN-L analyzer to
demonstrate comparability of whole blood reference ranges for an adult population (>21
years) to the ranges established for a predicate device. Prospective samples for adults
were collected in K2EDTA anticoagulant from a total of 80 donors (40 males; 40
females) at one site. All specimens were analyzed in singlet in the Automated Whole
Blood Sampling Mode. The upper and lower limits of the established reference ranges
21

--- Page 22 ---
were compared to the study results. References were also provided to substantiate the
reference intervals verified in the study.
Whole Blood – Pediatric
A literature reference interval verification study was performed for the pediatric
population. A total of 136 samples were collected from apparently healthy pediatric
patients in pediatric subcategories (≥ 2 to <12 (49 samples)) and ≥ 12 to <21 (87
samples)) to support the Intended Use. All samples were collected in K2EDTA
anticoagulant and analyzed in singlet in the Automated Whole Blood Sampling Mode.
The upper and lower limits of the published reference ranges were compared to the study
results.
Body Fluids
A verification study was conducted using a minimum of 20 normal CSF and 20 normal
Synovial fluids to verify normal reference ranges cited from published literature
(Kjeldsberg’s Body Fluids, Third Edition (1993)1). Reference intervals for other body
fluid types have not been established. According to Kjeldsberg (1993), reference intervals
for RBC count are not applicable in body fluid, and therefore, no reference interval for
RBC has been established.
C. Matrix Studies
1. Whole Blood Anticoagulant Comparison (K2EDTA vs. K3EDTA)
Anticoagulant comparison studies were performed to evaluate comparability between
K2EDTA and K3EDTA anticoagulated whole blood samples on the XN-L analyzer.
A total of 40 paired (K2 and K3EDTA) whole blood samples were used for this
study. The samples were run in singlet in the Whole Blood Automated Sampling
Mode and the K2EDTA sample results were compared to the corresponding results of
the K3EDTA sample for the same donor.
2. Whole Blood Venous to Capillary Comparison
A comparison study was performed to demonstrate comparability between venous
whole blood samples and capillary whole blood samples on the XN-L analyzer. A
total of 40 paired whole blood venous samples and capillary samples (K2EDTA)
were used for this study. Venous whole blood samples were run in the Whole Blood
Automated Sampling Mode (Normal Tube Position) and capillary whole blood
samples in the Whole Blood Manual Mode (Micro-collection Tube Position) in
singlet on the XN-L analyzer. The venous whole blood sample results were compared
to the corresponding results of the capillary sample for the same donor.

1. Whole Blood K2EDTA Tube to Micro-tube Comparison
A total of 51 residual K2EDTA (4 mL tubes) anticoagulated whole blood samples
with analyte concentrations representative of normal patient samples, patient samples
across medical decision levels, and the analytical measuring range, to the extent
possible, were used to determine the presence or absence of matrix effect between
K2EDTA normal tubes and micro collection tubes on the XN-L analyzer. K2EDTA
normal tubes were run in singlet in the Manual Mode Normal Tube Position and
within 2 hours of analysis, the samples were transferred to micro collection tubes
(without additive) and analyzed in the Manual Mode Micro-collection Tube Position.
2. Whole Blood Pre-dilute Mode Normal Tube to Micro-tube Comparison
A total of 40 residual K2EDTA (4 mL tubes) anticoagulated whole blood samples
were used to determine the equivalency between the Pre-dilute Mode Normal Tube
Position and the Pre-dilute Mode Micro-collection tube position. Pre-diluted samples
(1:7) were prepared for each sample by dispensing 420 μL of the analyzer diluent into
plain top tubes (4 mL tubes) then adding 70 μL of whole blood and mixing 10 times
by gentle inversion. The plain top 4 mL tubes were run in singlet in the Pre-dilute
Mode normal tube position. Immediately following, the samples were mixed 10 times
then transferred to micro-collection tubes (without additive) and analyzed in the Pre-
dilute Mode micro-collection tube position (Cap Off). Results in the mode are
automatically multiplied by 7 before results are displayed, therefore no additional
calculation is required.
3. Low WBC (LWBC) Mode Normal Tube Position to Micro Tube Comparison- Whole
Blood
A total of 40 residual K2EDTA anticoagulated whole blood samples and 20 LWBC
samples were used to determine the equivalency between the LWBC Mode Normal
tube position and the LWBC Mode micro-collection tube position. The original
K2EDTA sample tube was hand mixed by gentle inversion 10 times and run in the
singlet in the LWBC Mode Normal tube position on the XN-L analyzer. Immediately
following, the samples were mixed 10 times then transferred to micro-collection tubes
(without additive) and analyzed in the LWBC Mode micro-collection tube position
(Cap Off).
E. Determination of limit of Blank, lower limits of detection and quantitation:
Whole Blood
Limit of Blank
The Limit of Blank (LoB) for WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT and PLT was determined
using the system diluent as a blank sample. A total of 12 repeated measurements
using one blank sample were tested on four XN-L analyzers over a period of 5 days
for a total of 60 measurements per analyzer (12 reps x 1 sample x 4 analyzers x 5
23

days) for each parameter. Testing was conducted in the Whole Blood Manual Mode
in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2. The results obtained from all four analyzers were
used to calculate the Mean, SD, and LoB for each parameter. The results of the LoB
are included in the table below.
Limit of Detection and Quantitation
The Limit of Detection (LoD) for the WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT and PLT parameters
were determined using venous whole blood K2EDTA anticoagulated samples diluted
with system diluent to create four low concentration samples not exceeding three
times the manufacturer’s claimed limit of blank for WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, PLT,
for a predicate device which is 0.10, 0.02, 0.1, 10, 0.001 and 0.003, respectively.
Samples were tested in replicates of five measurements over three days using two
XN-L analyzers for a total of 60 measurements for each parameter. Samples were
mixed by gentle hand inversion 10 times and analyzed in Whole Blood Mode in
accordance with CLSI EP17-A2. The measurements obtained from all analyzers were
used to calculate the Mean, SD, and LoD for each parameter. The results of the LoD
and LoQ are included in the following table below.
