L. Test Principle:
The HISCL TSH Assay Kit is an in vitro diagnostic device that measures TSH based on the
chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay method with CDP-StarTM chemiluminescent
substrate. The assay utilizes a 1-step sandwich immunoassay, as follows:
1. ALP (alkaline phosphatase)-labeled anti-TSH monoclonal antibodies (mouse) in R1
reagent specifically react with TSH in the sample.
2. Biotinylated anti-TSH monoclonal antibodies (mouse) in R3 reagent specifically bind to
TSH, and bind to streptavidin-coated MP (magnetic particles) in R2 reagent.
3. After bound/free (B/F) separation, ALP on MP decomposes CDP-Star TM substrate in R5
to an excited intermediate, which produces a luminescent signal.
Because the light production increases in proportion to TSH concentration, sample TSH
concentration can be obtained with a calibration curve prepared with calibrators.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The five samples (2 controls and 3 serum samples) were each assayed over 20 days,
in duplicate, two runs per day, for a total of 80 results per sample. Testing was
performed using multiple lots of reagents with multiple instruments. All lots of
reagents yielded similar results and one representative lot of reagent is summarized
below.

b. Linearity:
A contrived high serum sample was mixed with a low contrived sample to create 33
intermediate samples with concentrations that are known relative to one another. The
samples (total of 35) tested in this study ranged from 0.001 to 257.887 μIU/mL. The
percent deviation from the expected results was ≤ 10% for all concentrations tested.
The expected values were plotted against the observed values and the following
regression equation was obtained:
Y = 0.994x + 8.115x10-5 R2 =1.000
,
The sponsor states the data support the claimed measuring range of 0.008-75 µIU/mL
for the TSH assay.
High Dose Hook Effect
Five high concentration TSH samples (approximately 2,000 μIU/mL) were prepared.
From each sample, three 5-fold serial dilutions were created with the HISCL Diluent
to achieve the following TSH levels: 400 μIU/mL, 80 μIU/mL, and 16 μIU/mL. Each
serial dilution, plus the neat, high sample, was assayed in triplicate. No hook effect
was observed at TSH concentrations up to 2,000 μIU/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The HISCL TSH calibrators are traceable to the reference material: WHO Standard
80/558.
Value Assignment:
The HISCL TSH Calibrators contain six different levels of calibrator materials,
supplied in liquid form (1 mL each). Primary standards/calibrators are prepared from
the WHO Standard 80/558 material and used to assign the values of the initial HISCL
TSH standard calibrators which are compared to pre-set specifications for each
calibrator concentration. Product (commercial) calibrators are value assigned using
the secondary standard calibrators using a similar value assignment process based on
an internal procedure. Below are the target values of the calibrators.
HISCL TSH C0 (0 μIU/mL)
HISCL TSH C1 (2 μIU/mL)
HISCL TSH C2 (10 μIU/mL)
HISCL TSH C3 (50 μIU/mL)
9

--- Page 10 ---
HISCL TSH C4 (120 μIU/mL)
HISCL TSH C5 (200 μIU/mL)
The HISCL Immuno Multi controls contain two different levels of control materials,
supplied in lyophilized forms. The HISCL Immuno Multi controls are value assigned
using the HISCL TSH second standard calibrators. The acceptable range included on
the labeling is ± 20% of the targeted value. Below are the target concentrations and
ranges of the controls.
HISCL Immuno Multi Control Level 1 (targeted at 2.006 μIU/mL)
HISCL Immuno Multi Control Level 2 (targeted at 6.340 μIU/mL)
Commercial controls should also be used to supplement quality control testing to
extend the portion of the measuring range monitored.
Stability of Calibrators and Controls:
Real Time shelf life stability testing of the HISCL TSH Calibrators and HISCL
Immuno Multi Controls is on-going. The shelf-life stability studies protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable to support the following
claim of 12 months stability at 2-8°C.
Open Vial Stability Testing:
Real-time stability testing of the HISCL TSH Calibrators and HISCL Immuno Multi
Controls is ongoing. The open-vial stability studies protocols and acceptance criteria
were reviewed and found to be acceptable to support the following claims:
Calibrators: Stable after opening for 60 days at 2-8°C
Controls: Stable after opening for 8 hours at 8-30°C, 7 days at 2-8°C and 60 days at -
20°C.
d. Detection limit:
LoB:
Four zero TSH samples were used from four distinct lots of HISCL Diluent as the
blank samples in this study. The samples were assayed in replicates of five over four
days (n = 80) with each of two lots of test kits on two different instruments (total of
four combinations). LoB (for each lot/instrument combination) were calculated
according to CLSI EP17-A2. The LoB was determined to be 0.0007μIU/mL.
10

--- Page 11 ---
LoD:
Five low samples were prepared by adding varying amounts of TSH to the diluent so
that the values ranged from the LoB (1x), to five-times (5x) the LoB. Each sample
was assayed by each of two reagent lots and one instrument (two combinations)
8x/day for five days (n = 40/sample with each lot/instrument combination). From this
testing, the standard deviations for the low samples were calculated per the CLSI
EP17-A2 formula where: LoD = LoB + 1.645 x standard deviation (SD) of the low
sample. The data set with the highest LoD was used to describe the test system. The
LoD was determined to be 0.001 μIU/mL.
LoQ (Functional Sensitivity):
LoQ was determined by testing 7 low TSH samples. Four of the samples were human
pools where 10 discrete, native serum samples were combined, and TSH was stripped
using anti-TSH antibody coated magnetic particles; the three remaining samples were
serial dilutions of TSH low control material. The samples were tested twice a day for
20 days (n = 40 results per level), and means, standard deviations, and %CVs were
calculated. The TSH concentrations where %CVs did not exceed 20% across the four
combinations of reagents and calibrators were: 0.0010, 0.0013, 0.0014, and 0.0014
μIU/mL, respectively. The LoQ/functional sensitivity was determined to be
0.002μIU/mL, which is the lowest concentration at which the total imprecision for the
assay does not exceed 20%CV.
The sponsor claims that the assay has a measuring range of 0.008μIU/mL to 75
μIU/mL TSH.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference Testing:
Two serum samples with low and high TSH levels targeted at 0.3μIU/mL and
8μIU/mL, respectively, were used in the study. Moderate and high levels of various
biological and pharmaceutical substances as described in the table below were added
to the neat samples, and all samples were tested in triplicate. The testing was done
with two lots of reagents, one instrument, and one operator. The means were
calculated for each sample with and without potential interferents, and the percent
differences were calculated. Significant interference was defined as a difference of
greater than 10%. No samples demonstrated significant interference at the
concentrations noted in the table below.

containing serum samples were added to the neat samples to a final concentration of
up to 138 ng/mL of HAMA and all samples were tested in triplicate. The differences
and percent differences of the means between samples with and without HAMA were
calculated. Interference was defined as a difference of greater than 10% in results
from spiked samples compared to the expected TSH values of those samples. No
significant interference above the pre-defined limit was observed.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
For Reference Range Study:
One hundred forty-nine prospectively collected serum specimens obtained from
presumed apparently healthy individuals (self-reported), between the age of 21 and 70
years, with no personal or family history of thyroid dysfunction, no known thyroid
disease, who were not pregnant, not ill, and not taking thyroid medications, were
collected and tested. Each specimen was tested for normal values of TSH, FT4, TPOAb
and TgAb in order to confirm eligibility. Of the 149 prospectively enrolled subjects, 127
eligible prospectively enrolled subjects, 65 males and 62 females, were included in the
data analysis. The specimens were collected from subjects who lived in different areas of
the U.S. such that they were representative of the diverse U.S. population.
The sponsor established the HISCL TSH adult serum reference range of 0.446 μIU/mL to
4.780 μIU/mL using the central 95% interval of their results from this study (2.5th- 97.5th
percentile results).
