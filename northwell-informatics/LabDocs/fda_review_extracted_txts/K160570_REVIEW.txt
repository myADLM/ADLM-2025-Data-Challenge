L. Test Principle:
The Creatine Kinase assay is a UV test for the quantitative determination of creatine kinase
(CK) in human serum and plasma on Roche/Hitachi cobas c systems. The CK is activated by
N-acetylcysteine (NAC). In a primary reaction, the activated CK catalyzes the
dephosphorylation of creatine phosphate. In a coupled reaction, catalyzed by hexokinase
(HK), glucose is phoshorylated by the ATP formed in the primary reaction to form D-
glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). Finally D-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH)
catalyzes the oxidation of G6P by NADP to form D-6-phosphogluconate and NADPH. The
rate of NADPH formation is directly proportional to catalytic CK activity. It is determined by
measuring the increase in absorbance at 340nm (main) and 546nm (sub).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision experiments were performed in accordance with CLSI Guideline EP5-A2.
Five serum pools and two levels of control were tested using two aliquots per run,
two runs per day for 21 days on the same cobas c 501 analyzer and 3 lots of reagent.
Repeatability (within run precision) and intermediate precision (within lab precision)
were calculated. Precision results are:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was conducted by preparing dilution series using human sample
pools (one serum pool and one plasma pool) with creatine kinase concentrations to
cover the claimed measuring range. The ranges tested were 5.3 to 2099 U/L for serum
and 3.6 to 2181 U/L for plasma. Dilutions were made using 0.9% NaCl. The dilution
series contain 18 concentrations for both serum and plasma. Samples were measured
in triplicate on a cobas c 501 analyzer and data analysis was done separately for each
sample type. Linear regression analysis was done according to EP6-A. The results of
the linearity evaluation are:
Sample Type Linear Regression R²
Serum y=1.00x-1.137 0.9996
Plasma y=1.00x-2.842 0.9997
The claimed measuring range for creatine kinase is 7 – 2000 U/L (0.12-33.4 μkat/L).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: This method has been standardized against the IFCC Method for
Creatine Kinase.
Stability: The reagent shelf life stability claim is 12 months at 2 - 8°C. The reagent
onboard (in use and refrigerated) stability claim is 8 weeks.
Calibrator: The calibrator used with the Creatine Kinase assay is the previously
cleared Roche Diagnostics Calibrator for Automated Systems (k101456).
Controls: The controls used with the Creatine Kinase assay have been previously
cleared:
Precinorm U plus/Precipath U Plus (k042389)
Precinorm CK‑MB/Precipath CK-MB (k062972)
PreciControl ClinChem Multi 1 and 2 (k102016)
Sample stability assessment: A plasma sample stability study was performed using
native plasma samples collected in Li Heparin, K2 EDTA and K3 EDTA and stored
at 15 - 25°C for 2 days, at 2 - 8°C for 7 days and frozen at (-15 to -25)°C for 28 days.
The samples were tested using the CK assay on the cobas c 501 analyzer and ranged
from 82.2 to 139.1 U/L. The % recovery relative to the analyte content of the time
zero samples (reference) was calculated from the median of the threefold
measurement. The study supported the sample stability claim of EDTA/heparin
plasma: 2 days at 15-25 °C, 7 days at 2-8 °C and 4 weeks at (-15 to -25) °C.

d. Detection limit:
The evaluation of the limits of detection followed the recommendations in CLSI
EP17-A, Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of
Quantitation.
The Limit of Blank (LoB) was defined as the concentration at which there is a 95%
probability that a sample is analyte-free. The LoB calculation was performed with
one analyte free sample measured with three reagent lots in 10-fold determination in
6 runs, distributed over 3 days, on one cobas c 501 analyzer. In total, 60
measurements were obtained per lot. Data analysis is based on determination of the
95th percentile of the 60 measured values.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was defined as the concentration at which there is a
95% probability that a sample contains analyte. For determination of LoD five
samples with low-analyte concentration (approximately up to 4 times the LoB) were
measured with three reagent lots in two-fold determination in 6 runs, distributed over
3 days, on one cobas c 501 analyzer. In total 60 measurements were obtained per lot.
LoD = LoB + 1.653 x SDtot.
The limit of Quantitation (LoQ) is defined as the lowest analyte concentration that
can be quantitatively determined with a stated acceptable precision and trueness
under stated experimental conditions. For determination of LoQ a low level sample
set was prepared by diluting 5 human serum samples with an analyte free diluent
(0.9% NaCl). The low level sample set was tested in 5 replicates per sample on 5
days, one run per day on one cobas c 501 analyzer. LoQ is calculated with the
precision at 20% CV results.
The results of the evaluation of the detection limits are in the table below. The label
states that the detection limit of the test system is 7 U/L.
LoB and LoD Results
Result (U/L) Claim (U/L)
Limit of Blank (LoB) 0.3 7
Limit of Detection (LoD) 1.0 7
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) 3.3 7
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interference:
The effects of endogenous interference by hemoglobin, lipemia (Intralipid), and
bilirubin on the Creatine Kinase test system was performed on the cobas c 501
analyzer using 2 CK concentrations (Level 1 approximately 120 U/L and Level 2
approximately 1400 U/L of pooled human serum samples spiked with varying levels
of interferent. The resulting sample series (10 dilution steps per sample) were tested

in triplicate and then the measured concentration was compared to the expected
concentration (which is the CK concentration when no interferent was added). The
results are:
Interferent No interference up to Information in the labeling
No significant interference
Hemolysis Level 1: 103 H Index up to an H index of 100
Level 2: 130 H Index (approximate hemoglobin
concentration: 100 mg/dL)

Level 2: 1143 L Index There is poor correlation
between the L index
(corresponds to turbidity) and
triglycerides concentration.

index > 1000) may cause high
absorbance flagging. Choose
diluted sample treatment for
automatic rerun.
No significant interference

Bilirubin Level 2: 67 I Index (approximate conjugated and
unconjugated bilirubin
Conjugated Level 1: 68 I Index concentration: 60 mg/dL).
Bilirubin Level 2: 76 I Index
Exogenous Interference:
Two sample pools containing a low and high concentration (low is approximately 120
U/L and high is approximately 1400 U/L) of CK were used. These sample pools were
divided into an appropriate number of aliquots. One aliquot was not spiked with the
drugs and it was used as the reference sample for CK concentration. The other sample
aliquots, with either the high or low CK concentrations, were spiked with the
respective amount of drug. The CK concentration of the spiked aliquots were
determined in triplicate on a cobas c 501 analyzer and compared to the CK
concentration determined for the reference aliquot (mean of n=3). The sponsor
defined no significant interference as < 10 % difference from the reference sample.
No interference was found when tested using Acetylcysteine (1660 mg/L),
Ampicillin-Na (1000 mg/L), Ascorbic acid (300 mg/L), Cyclosporine (5 mg/L),
Cefoxitin (250 mg/L), Heparin (5000 U), Intralipid (10,000), Levodopa (4 mg/L),
Methyldopa +1.5 (20 mg/L), Metronidazole (200 mg/L), Phenylbutazone (400 mg/L),

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 132 human serum samples with values ranging from 7.59 to 1946 U/L were
tested in the method comparison study. The samples were tested in singlicate with the
CK assay on the cobas c 501 analyzer and the predicate device. Nine of the 132
samples were spiked with human recombinant CK MB. The data were evaluated
using Passing Bablok regression analysis. The results of the analysis are:

b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed using samples drawn into serum and
different types of plasma collection tubes (K2 EDTA, K3 EDTA, Li Heparin, and Gel
Separation). For each of the four tube types, 36 samples ranging from 8 to 1953 U/L
were tested in singlicate on the cobas c 501 analyzer. Regression analysis was
performed using the serum data as the reference. The results of the studies are:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Reference intervals for CK depend on the patient group and the specific
clinical situation. Each laboratory should investigate the transferability of the expected
values to its own patient population and if necessary, determine its own reference
ranges.
For healthy people, according to Klein et al. 1
CK U/L μkat/L
Men 39‑308 0.65‑5.14
Women 26‑192 0.43‑3.21
The reference values according to Klein et al. are based on the 95th percentile of a group
of healthy persons (202 men and 217 women) not involved in high‑intensity athletic
activities and were established on Roche/Hitachi analyzers using CK reagent.
