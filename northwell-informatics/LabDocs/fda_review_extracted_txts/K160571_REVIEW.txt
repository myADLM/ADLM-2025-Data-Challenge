chemistry analyzer intended for the in-vitro quantitative determination of analytes in
body fluids.
The Tina-quant Hemoglobin A1cDx Gen.3 assay is intended for use as an aid in
diagnosis of diabetes and as an aid in identifying patients who may be at risk for
developing diabetes. It is an in vitro diagnostics reagent system intended for quantitative
determination of mmol/mol hemoglobin A1c (IFCC) and % hemoglobin A1c
(DCCT/NGSP) in hemolysate or whole blood on the Roche/Hitachi cobas c 513 clinical
chemistry analyzer. HbA1c determinations are useful for monitoring of long-term blood
glucose control in individuals with diabetes mellitus.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
• This device has significant negative interference with fetal hemoglobin (HbF).
HbA1c results are invalid for patients with abnormal amounts of HbF including those
with known Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin.
• For diagnostic purposes, mmol/mol HbA1c values (IFCC) and % HbA1c values
(DCCT/NGSP) should be used in conjunction with information from other diagnostic
procedures and clinical evaluations.
• The test is designed only for accurate and precise measurement of mmol/mol HbA1c
(IFCC) and % HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP). The individual results for total Hb and HbA1c
concentration should not be reported.
• Glycated HbF is not detected by the assay as it does not contain the β-chain that
characterizes HbA1c. However, HbF is measured in the total Hb assay and as a
consequence, specimens containing high amounts of HbF (>7%) may result in lower
than expected mmol/mol HbA1c values (IFCC) and % HbA1c values (DCCT/NGSP).
• As a matter of principle, care must be taken when interpreting any HbA1c result from
patients with Hb variants. Abnormal hemoglobins might affect the half life of the red
cells or the in vivo glycation rates. In these cases even analytically correct results do
not reflect the same level of glycemic control that would be expected in patients with
normal hemoglobin.26 Whenever it is suspected that the presence of an Hb variant
(e.g. HbSS, HbCC or HbSC) affects the correlation between the HbA1c value and
glycemic control, HbA1c must not be used for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.
• Hemoglobin A1c should not be used to diagnose diabetes mellitus in patients with a
hemoglobinopathy but normal red cell turnover (e.g. sickle cell trait)
• Any cause of shortened erythrocyte survival or decrease in mean erythrocyte age will
reduce exposure of erythrocytes to glucose with a consequent decrease in mmol/mol
HbA1c values (IFCC) and % HbA1c values (DCCT/NGSP), even though the time-
averaged blood glucose level may be elevated. Causes of shortened erythrocyte
lifetime might be hemolytic anemia or other hemolytic diseases, homozygous sickle
cell trait, pregnancy, recent significant or chronic blood loss, etc. Similarly, recent
blood transfusions can alter the mmol/mol HbA1c values (IFCC) and % HbA1c
values (DCCT/NGSP). Caution should be used when interpreting the HbA1c results
from patients with these conditions. HbA1c must not be used for the diagnosis of
diabetes mellitus in the presence of such conditions.
• Hemoglobin A1c should not be used to diagnose diabetes mellitus in patients with
hereditary spherocytosis, malignancies or severe chronic hepatic and renal disease.
2

--- Page 3 ---
• HbA1c should not be used to diagnose diabetes during pregnancy. It reflects the
average blood glucose levels over the preceding 3 months (the average life of a red
blood cell), and therefore may be falsely low during pregnancy or any other
condition associated with recent onset of hyperglycemia and/or decreased red cell
survival.
• mmol/mol HbA1c values (IFCC) and % HbA1c values (DCCT/NGSP) are not
suitable for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes.
• In cases of rapidly evolving type 1 diabetes the increase of HbA1c values might be
delayed compared to the acute increase in glucose concentrations. In these conditions
diabetes mellitus must be diagnosed based on plasma glucose concentration and/or
the typical clinical symptoms.
• Hemoglobin A1c testing should not replace glucose testing for type 1 diabetes, in
pediatric patients and in pregnant women.
• For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Roche cobas c 513 Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The cobas c 513 Tina-quant HbA1cDx Gen.3 consists of two working reagents (R1 and R2)
and a Hemolyzing reagent. The R1 reagent consists of antibody reagent, MES buffer: 0.025
mol/L; TRIS buffer: 0.015mol/L, pH6.2; HbA1c antibody (bovine serum): ≥0.5 mg/ml;
stabilizers; preservatives (liquid). R2 reagent (Polyhapten reagent) consists of MES buffer:
0.025 mol/L; TRIS buffer: 0.015 mol/L, pH 6.2, HbA1c polyhapten: ≥ 8μg/mL; stabilizers;
detergents and preservatives (liquid). Anticoagulated whole blood is hemolyzed either
manually or automatically prior to determination of HbAlc by a turbidimetric inhibition
immunoassay.
The cobas c 513 Tina-Quant assay consists of two separate applications that are specific to
the sample types, whole blood and hemolysate. The Whole Blood Application differs from
the Hemolysate Application in the hemolyzing step. For the Whole Blood Application, whole
blood samples are placed on the analyzer. Hemolysis occurs onboard the analyzer. For the
Hemolysate Application, hemolyzed samples are placed on the analyzer. Hemolysis occurs
manually before placing the samples onboard the analyzer. The two applications yield the
same results.
Calibrators (Roche C.f.a.s. HbA1c) and controls (Roche PreciControl HbA1c norm and
path) are recommended for use with this device. The calibrators and controls were previously
cleared under 510(k) numbers k052101 and k103099, respectively.

L. Test Principle:
HbA1c determination is based on the turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay (TINIA) for
hemolyzed whole blood. Glycohemoglobin in the sample reacts with anti-HbA1c to form
soluble antigen-antibody complexes. Polyhaptens react with excess anti-HbA1c to form an
insoluble antibody-polyhapten complex which can be measured turbidimetrically. The
instrument calculates the %HbA1c from the HbA1c/Hb ratio according to a user selected
protocol.
This method uses tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB) as the detergent in the
hemolyzing reagent to eliminate interference from leukocytes (TTAB does not lyse
leukocytes). Sample pretreatment to remove labile HbA1c is not necessary.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was performed in Accordance with CLSI Guideline EP5-A2 to evaluate
repeatability (within-run precision) and intermediate precision of within-laboratory
precision (total precision). Two aliquots of each sample were measured once each in
two runs per day for 21 days on three cobas c 513 analyzers using 3 reagent lots per
system. Eight total samples were evaluated in each run: two controls, PreciControl
HbA1c norm and path, and 7 human samples with approximate HbA1c
concentrations of 5%, 6.5%, 7.0%, 8.0%, 10.5%, 12% and 14%. All testing was
completed within one calibration cycle for each analyzer on both anticoagulated (K
2-
EDTA) venous whole blood and hemolysate applications. Samples were randomized
in each run and mean, repeatability and intermediate precision as CV and SD values,
and the upper 95% confidence interval for SD and CV values were calculated. Results
are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was conducted according to CLSI EP06-A using two separate
dilution series consisting of at least 11 levels that were prepared using human
hemolysate sample pools with varying concentrations of either HbA1c or Hb to cover
entire measuring range of the assay. Samples were measured in triplicate and data
analysis as performed separately for each sample. The sponsor performed first order
linear regression.
The linear regression statistics are as follows:
Hb: Intercept= 0.051, slope=0.983, r2=0.9998
HbA1c: Intercept= 0.002, slope=0.972, r2=0.9980
The claimed measuring ranges are:
Hb: 4-40 g/dL (2.48 – 24.8 mmol/L)
HbA1c: 0.3 – 1.96 g/dL (0.186 – 1.20 mmol/L)
The linearity results support the claims that the assay is linear across the reportable
measuring range of 4.2-15.5 % HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP) which corresponds to a
measuring range of 23-146 mmol/mol HbA1c (IFCC) at a typical hemoglobin
concentration of 8.2 mmol/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The assigned HbA1c and total hemoglobin values of the cobas c 513 Tina-quant
Hemoglobin A1c Gen.3 assay is certified with the National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP). See NGSP website for current certification at
http://www.ngsp.org.
The derived result of the ratio (%) from the NGSP correlation is calculated from the
individual quantitative results for total hemoglobin and Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).
The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) units of mmol/mol are
calculated using the Master Equation: IFCC = (NGSP- 2.15) / 0.092. Two different
units are provided to the customers: NGSP equivalent units (%) and IFCC equivalents
units (mmol/mol).
Calibrator and Control materials:
Value assignment for calibrators (Roche C.f.a.s HbA1c) and controls (Roche
PreciControl HbA1c norm and PreciControl HbA1c path) that are recommended for
11

--- Page 12 ---
use with this device were previously reviewed under 510(k) numbers k052101 and
k103099 respectively.
Stability:
Stability data for calibrators (Roche C.f.a.s. HbA1c) and controls (Roche
PreciControl HbA1c norm and PreciControl HbA1c path) were previously reviewed
and found acceptable under 510(k) numbers k052101 and k103099, respectively.
d. Detection limit:
Limits of blank and detection were determined according to EP17-A2. For
determination of Limit of Blank (LoB) one analyte free sample was measured with
three lots in 10-fold determination. Six runs distributed over ≥ 3 days using one cobas
c 513 analyzer were performed. In total, 60 measurements were obtained per lot. LoB
was defined by the sponsor as the 95th percentile of the 60 measured values. In their
design (n=60) the 95th percentile was the average of the 57th and 58th value.
For determination of the Limit of detection (LoD), five unique human samples were
diluted with hemolyzing reagent to achieve low-analyte concentrations. They were
measured with three reagent lots in two-fold determination. Six runs distributed over
≥ three days on one c 513 analyzer were performed. In total, 60 measurements were
obtained per lot. The sponsor defined LoD as the concentration, at which there was
95% probability that a sample contains analyte.
The detection limits are summarized in the table below:
Limit of Blank Limit of Detection
Hb 0.50 g/dL (0.31 mmol/L) 1.00 g/dL (0.62 mmol/L)
HbA1c 0.19 g/dL (0.12 mmol/L) 0.29 g/dL (0.18 mmol/L)
% HbA1c (based on a 2.27 % 2.41%
typical Hb concentration of
13.2 g/dL or 8.2 mmol/L)
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interferences:
Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that may interfere
with the cobas c 513 Tina-quant HbA1cDx Gen.3 Assay. Pooled whole blood
samples with two HbA1c levels (~6.2% and ~10.7% HbA1c, respectively) were
spiked with the maximum level of the six interferents in separate preparations,
resulting in 12 spiked samples. These samples were then hemolyzed with Tinaquant
HbA1c Hemolyzing Reagent. Another pool, without interferent, was equally
hemolyzed. A minimum of a 10-level dilution series was then created for each of the
12 spiked samples by using the interferent free pool as the diluting reagent. The
twelve dilution series was tested in ten replicates for % HbA1c using the Hemolysate
12

Samples were analyzed in replicates of ten on the cobas c 513 Tina-quant HbA1cDx
Gen.3 and the results were compared to the results from the reference sample (aliquot
with no interfering substance). The comparison was evaluated as a percent deviation.
The sponsor defines significant interference as ≥±7% deviation of a measurement
from the reference sample (aliquot with no interfering substance) in terms of %
HbA1c.

Drug interference:
Drug interferences were evaluated by using a panel of commonly used drugs was
added to native patient samples and examined for potential effect on % HbA1c
determination with the Hemolysate Application. Drug interference testing was
performed with hemolysate samples at 2 different HbA1c levels (~6% and 8%
HbA1c). Each drug was added in two defined concentrations with concentration 1
being several times (typically 5 times) the maximum daily dosage and concentration 2
being the maximum daily dosage level. Samples were measured in ten replicates
using the cobas c 513 system. Samples were analyzed on the cobas c 513 Tina-quant
HbA1cDx Gen.3 and the values obtained with the test samples were compared to the
reference value (HbA1c sample with no drug added) and the deviation from the
reference was calculated. .
Significant interference was defined by the sponsor as > ±7% deviation from the
reference sample (aliquot with no interfering substance). Results demonstrated no
significant interference was observed with the following substances up to the stated
concentrations in the following table:

Cross Reactivity with Hemoglobin Derivatives:
Cross reactivity studies were performed to determine if the Tina-quant Hemoglobin
A1cDx Gen.3 assay demonstrates cross-reactivity from HbA0, HbA1a+b, Acetylated
Hb, Carbamylated Hb, glycated albumin and Labile HbA1c using the hemolysate
application. Two HbA1c concentrations of pooled whole blood (~6.5% and ~9%
HbA1c) were spiked with the potential interferent and each sample was analyzed in
replicates of ten. The sponsor defined no significant interference as ≤ ±7% deviation
between the test sample (containing interferent) and the reference sample (aliquot
with no interfering substance) at both % HbA1c levels tested. The highest
concentration at which no significant interference was observed are listed below:

Hemoglobin Variants
Hemoglobin variant testing was conducted to determine if there was any significant
interference with any of the major hemoglobin variants and the Tina-quant
Hemoglobin A1cDx Gen.3 assay. Testing of the samples was performed in singlicate
on the cobas c 513 analyzer using the hemolysate application and compared to results
obtained by a reference method that has been demonstrated to be free from the
hemoglobin interference being tested. The following is a table of samples that were
measured:

Specimens containing high amounts of HbF (> 7 %) may yield
HbF
lower than expected HbA1c values.
The results show there is significant interference due to the presence of HbF in the
sample. The extent of interference is directly proportional to the amount of HbF
contained within the sample. The labeling states that heterozygous presence of the
most common hemoglobin variants (HbAS, HbAC, HbAD, HbAE) does not interfere
with this assay.
Glycated HbF is not detected as it does not contain the glycated β‑chain that
characterizes HbA1c. However, HbF is measured in the Total Hb assay and as a
consequence, specimens containing high amounts of HbF (> 7 %) may result in lower
than expected mmol/mol HbA1c values (IFCC) and % HbA1c values (DCCT/NGSP)
In addition, the device labeling contains the following prominent boxed warning:
This device has significant negative interference with fetal hemoglobin (HbF).
HbA1c results are invalid for patients with abnormal amounts of HbF including those
with known Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin. Refer to the Limitations -
interference section of this method sheet for details.
The device label also contains the following additional warning:
As a matter of principle, care must be taken when interpreting any HbA1c result from
patients with Hb variants. Abnormal hemoglobins might affect the half-life of the red
cells or the in vivo glycation rates. In these cases even analytically correct results do
not reflect the same level of glycemic control that would be expected in patients with
normal hemoglobin. Whenever it is suspected that the presence of an Hb variant (e.g.
HbSS, HbCC or HbSC) affects the correlation between the HbA1c value and
glycemic control, HbA1c must not be used for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.

HbA1c
Protocol 2 (ratio definition for % HbA1c, according to DCCT/NGSP): 4.0‑6.0 % HbA1c
HbA1c levels higher than the upper end of this reference range are an indication of
hyperglycemia during the preceding 2 to 3 months or longer. According to the
recommendations of the American Diabetes Association values above 48 mmol/mol
HbA1c (IFCC) or 6.5 % HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP) are suitable for the diagnosis of diabetes
mellitus.1,2 Patients with HbA1c values in the range of 39‑46 mmol/mol HbA1c (IFCC)
or 5.7‑6.4 % HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP) may be at risk of developing diabetes.1, 2
HbA1c levels may reach 195 mmol/mol (IFCC) or 20 % (DCCT/NGSP) or higher in
poorly controlled diabetes. Therapeutic action is suggested at levels above 64 mmol/mol
HbA1c (IFCC) or 8 % HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP). Diabetes patients with HbA1c levels
below 53 mmol/mol (IFCC) or 7 % (DCCT/NGSP) meet the goal of the American
Diabetes Association3, 4. HbA1c levels below the established reference range may
21

indicate recent episodes of hypoglycemia, the presence of Hb variants, or shortened
lifetime of erythrocytes.
Each laboratory should investigate the transferability of the expected values to its own
patient population and if necessary determine its own reference ranges.
