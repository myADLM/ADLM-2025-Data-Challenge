L. Test Principle:
XN CAL was designed to function as a substitute for fresh whole blood to calibrate the
Sysmex XN10/20, XN 11/21, and XN-L series hematology analyzers. This product is for in-
vitro diagnostic use to calibrate the following parameters: RBC (106/μL), HGB (g/dL), HCT
(%), PLT (103/μL), WBC (103/μL), and RET (%).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i. Multi-site reproducibility study: Data was collected from Sysmex XN-L model
analyzers at three sites – Streck, Sysmex-Buffalo Grove, and Sysmex-Mundelein
with three different operators. Three separately manufactured lots of XN CAL
were tested on each analyzer. The study was conducted over the course of 5 days,
with three runs per day, and two replicates per run (5 days x 3 runs x 2 replicates
x 3 lots x 3 sites). The means for each of the assayed parameters for each lot are
indicated in Table 1, below. The total reproducibility estimates (Table 2, below)
for each parameter for each lot include the repeatability (within-run), between-
run, between-day, and between-site precision estimates. Results across the three
separately manufactured lots of XN CAL demonstrated consistent recovery across
multiple instruments, at multiple sites.

ii. Internal precision study: Performance data provided by the closed-vial stability
study was used to support the internal precision study. In this study, performance
of three (3) lots of XN CAL was evaluated at one site, on one instrument, for 21
non-consecutive days, two vials per day, and two replicates per vial. The internal
precision for each lot of XN CAL was consistent across lots for each assayed
parameter (see Tables 3 and 4, below). Total variability estimates (within-lab
precision) included repeatability (within-run), between-vial, and between-day
(Table 4, below).

Value Assignment:
Value assignment for the three lots of XN CAL evaluated in this submission was
based on data collected across three XN-L instruments at three sites. Data was
collected across three separately manufactured lots over the course of 5 non-
consecutive days, with three (3) runs per day, and two (2) replicates per run. All
assay ranges assigned to each lot for each of the parameters are based on the total
reproducibility estimated from the multi-site reproducibility study. Assay values
were assigned to the following parameters: RBC (106/μL), HGB (g/dL), HCT (%),
PLT (103/μL), WBC (103/μL), and RET (%). Future lots of XN CAL will be value
assigned at one site by a minimum of one operator. Five repeat measurements will
be taken from two separate vials of calibrator and assayed in a single run on each of
the 2 days. The average of the 20 individual measurements will be used for value
assignment. All lot specific assay values will be included on the lot specific assay

Reagent Stability:
i. Open-vial stability: A 4-hour real-time open-vial stability study was conducted
at one site on the XN-L model analyzer. Throughout the collection of the open-
vial stability data, the calibrator was stored as indicated in the instructions for
use. Each vial was stored at 2–8°C and removed for testing. After testing, the
vial was returned to 2–8°C until the next testing event. One vial of calibrator
from each of the three lots was analyzed in four replicates on one day over a
period of 5 hours (times 0, 2, 4, and 5 hours; n=16 measurements), on one
analyzer. Stability performance of each lot of calibrator was assessed in terms of
6

parameter drift over time (for each parameter), as described in CLSI EP25-A –
“Evaluation of Stability of In Vitro Diagnostic Agents; Approved Guideline.”
Values associated with each parameter, for each lot, and at each time point were
within the acceptable value range, supportive of a 4-hour open vial stability
claim.
ii. Closed-vial stability: A real-time, 35-day closed-vial study was conducted
internally on one Sysmex XN-L model analyzer by one operator. Two vials of
calibrators from each of the three lots were analyzed in duplicate over the course
of 38–39 days (with data collected every 4 days), providing measurements for 21
non-consecutive days. Stability performance of each lot of calibrator was
assessed in terms of parameter drift over time (for each parameter), as described
in CLSI EP25-A – “Evaluation of Stability of In Vitro Diagnostic Agents;
Approved Guideline.” Values associated with each parameter, for each lot, and at
each time point were within the acceptable value range, supportive of a 35-day
closed-vial stability claim.
