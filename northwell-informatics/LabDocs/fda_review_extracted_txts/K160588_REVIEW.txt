A single-site precision study was conducted on three lots of XN CHECK BF™, in
which a single instrument was used at Streck with a single operator. Testing was
performed with two runs per day and two replicates per run for 20 days on three lots
of control materials. The single-site precision study was combined with the closed-
vial stability study following the CLSI EP05-A3 guideline for the study and data
analysis. The data of within-run, between-run, between-lot, between-day, and total
precision of each level were calculated for all three lots combined and summarized in
table below.

Value assignment for XN CHECK BF™ was based on data collected across three
XN-L instruments conducted at three separate sites (Streck, Sysmex-Buffalo Grove,
and Sysmex-Mundelein) with three different operators. Three separately
manufactured lots of XN CHECK BF™ were tested on each analyzer. Each site was
instructed to run each lot and level of control for 5 days with 2 runs per day and 3
replicates per run. The final dataset of each lot resulted in a total of 90 measurements
per level (level 1 and level 2). Standard deviation from the multi-site total

reproducibility was used to determine the range of each parameter of XN CHECK
BF™. Future control lots will be value assigned at one site by a minimum of one
operator. Five repeat measurements will be taken from two separate vials of control
material and assayed in a single run on each of 2 days. The average of the 20
individual results will be used for value assignment.
ii. Open-vial stability:
The open-vial stability claim was verified on the XN-L instrument at Streck. Open-
vial stability testing was performed in real-time with three lots of control for the 30-
day open-vial stability claim throughout the stated product life. One vial of control
per level from each lot was analyzed four times at 0, 15, 30 and 31 days. Day 0 is
the baseline value that was observed on the first day of the study. Day 31 was
collected one day after the stated open-vial stability claim to ensure that the open-
vial stability claim was fully encompassed. Throughout the collection of the open-
vial stability data each vial of control was stored between 2° to 8° C and removed
from the refrigerator for testing. After testing, the vial was returned to the
refrigerator until the next testing event.
Stability performance of each control lot was assessed in terms of parameter drift
over time (for each parameter), as described in CLSI EP25-A – “Evaluation of
Stability of In Vitro Diagnostic Agents; Approved Guideline.” Values associated
with each parameter, for each lot/level, at each time point were within the acceptable
value range, supportive of a 30-day open-vial stability claim.
iii. Closed-vial stability:
The 84-day closed-vial stability claim was verified on the XN-L instrument with all
three lots of control. Two vials of control per level from each lot were used at each
testing interval for this study. A minimum of four data points were collected at each
testing event over the 84-day period. Data was collected internally with one operator.
Day 0 is the baseline value that was observed on the first day of the study. One data
point was collected after the stated closed-vial stability claim to ensure that the closed
vial stability claim was fully encompassed.
Results of the closed-vial stability testing were assessed for each lot and level in
terms of measurand drift as described in CLSI EP25-A – “Evaluation of Stability of
In Vitro Diagnostic Agents; Approved Guideline”.
