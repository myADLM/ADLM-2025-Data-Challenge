510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k160613
B. Purpose for Submission:
New device
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Soberlink Healthcare LLC Soberlink Cellular Device
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Quantitative – electrochemical fuel cell sensor
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Soberlink Cellular Device is a hand-held instrument intended to measure ethanol in
breath samples. The front of the device has an LCD screen with two display buttons. The
bottom of the device has a micro USB charging port. The USB port is for charging
purposes only. The side of the device (from top to bottom) has a camera, a blue status
light encased around the mouthpiece port, and a power/select button. A reusable
mouthpiece is inserted into the mouthpiece port, once the test is taken, the results are
displayed on the LCD screen and sent to the central monitoring station. The Soberlink
Cellular Device uses an internal Lithium-ion rechargeable battery
2. Principles of Operation:
The Soberlink Cellular Device is a handheld breath alcohol measurement device with
integrated GPS, digital imager, and cellular modem. It is designed to take a deep lung
sample of the Users breath, calculate their Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC), and send
the BAC reading, physical location, and digital image of the User to the Sober Sky Web
Portal for review.
The Device uses an electrochemical fuel cell that is designed to responds to alcohol.
After the User blows into the Device for 4 seconds, their photo is taken and a sample of
their breath is drawn into the fuel cell by an automatic pump. A chemical reaction
between the alcohol and the fuel cell occurs. This reaction generates an electrical current
that is directly related to the amount of alcohol in the sample. The current is then
1

converted to a Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) level and displayed for the User. The
relationship between alcohol in a person's deep lung breath and in their blood is
previously established using Henry's law, which gives a ratio of 2100:1. After the BAC
has been calculated, the Device obtains the User’s GPS coordinates and constructs a
breath test report that includes the photo, BAC, and location, which may then be
uploaded to the Portal.

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
The sponsor performed a consumer study to determine if the consumers could use and
interpret the device using only the supplied instructions for use. Results were
compared to an evidential breath alcohol tester; BACtrack S80 Pro.
Forty-three (43) participants took their breath alcohol reading with the candidate
device, and the results were recorded. Within 1-5 minutes after using the Soberlink
Cellular Device, the participants were then asked to provide a breath sample using the
evidential device. The breath alcohol concentrations ranged from a BAC of 0.000 to
0.130 by the evidential device. Linear regression analysis of the data showed a slope
of1.049, a y-intercept of -0.001 and a correlation coefficient of 0.974.
After the study, participants were asked to answer questions and the results
demonstrated that the device was adequately easy to use and interpret.
b. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision and accuracy of the Soberlink Cellular Device was evaluated at an
independent testing laboratory, and followed the protocol of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). There were 60 trials performed during this
testing, which were comprised of 20 trials at 0.000 BAC, 20 trials at 0.008 BAC, and
20 trials at 0.032 BAC. Blood Alcohol Concentrations are simulated in breath by a
breath alcohol sample simulator, which provides an alcohol-in-air test sample with
known alcohol concentrations, flow rate, and air composition. The acceptance criteria
for this testing were: not more than one result greater than 0.020 at 0.000 BAC, not
more than one result greater than 0.020 at 0.008 BAC, and not more than one result
less than 0.020 at 0.032 BAC. NOTE: for the purposes of this study, a BAC of 0.020
is used to distinguish a positive from a negative result. The Soberlink Cellular
Device met all of the applicable NHSTA requirements for precision and accuracy.
c. Linearity:
The Soberlink Cellular Device will report concentrations from 0.000 to 0.400% BAC.
However, the DOT Model Specifications require accuracy and precision testing up to
a concentration of 0.032 only; therefore, true linearity over the entire measuring range
of the device was not evaluated (similar to other cleared BAC measurement devices).
Results of linearity assessment were acceptable.
d. Carryover:
Carryover studies are not required by NHTSA and were not performed using these
5

devices.
e. Interfering Substances:
Testing with cigarette smoke was performed to assess any possible interference. Five
trials were performed at 0.000 BAC. An alcohol free individual who smokes
cigarettes was appropriate for this trial. The subject was asked to smoke
approximately one half of a cigarette. Within one minute after smoking, or after a
waiting period specified in the manufacturer’s instructions*, the subject performed
the breath alcohol test according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The subject was
then asked to smoke another inhalation and repeat the test to produce a total of five
trials. For the purposes of this study, a BAC of 0.020 is used to distinguish a positive
from a negative result. The Soberlink Cellular Device had no positive results.
*The sponsor’s labeling recommends the user wait 20 minutes after consuming
alcohol, smoking, or eating to test a breath sample.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Limit of Detection
The device was tested at a BAC of zero (blank reading) to assess the possibility of
false positives. This consisted of 20 trials under normal laboratory conditions at a
BAC of 0.000. Non-alcoholic human breath was used as the sample. The Soberlink
Cellular Device had no false positive results in this trial.
b. High/Low Ambient Temperature
Testing at 10°C and 40°C was performed to assess any possible effects of
temperature. The testing and acceptance criteria for the processes were: 20 trials at
0.008 BAC and 20 trials at 0.032 BAC. The acceptance criteria were: not more than
one result greater than 0.020 using 0.008 BAC, and not more than one result less than
0.020 using 0.032 BAC. NOTE: for the purposes of this study, a BAC of 0.020 is
used to distinguish a positive from a negative result. The Soberlink Cellular Device
had no positive results at 0.008 BAC and no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC.
c. Vibration
Vibration testing was performed to assess any possible vibrational effects. Twenty
trials were performed at 0.008 BAC and 0.032 BAC. The acceptance criteria were:
not more than one result greater than 0.020 using 0.008 BAC, and not more than one
result less than 0.020 using 0.032 BAC. NOTE: for the purposes of this study, a BAC
of 0.020 is used to distinguish a positive from a negative result. The Soberlink
Cellular Device had no positive results at 0.008 BAC and no non-positive results at
0.032 BAC.

d. Cutoff
For the purposes of performance testing, a BAC cutoff of 0.020 was used to
distinguish positive from negative samples.
