L. Test Principle:
IMMULITE 2000 Free T4: IMMULITE 2000 Free T4 is a solid-phase, enzyme-labeled
chemiluminescent competitive immunoassay. The solid phase (bead) is coated with
monoclonal murine anti-T4 antibody. The liquid phase consists of alkaline phosphatase
(bovine calf intestine) conjugated to T4. The patient sample and the reagent are first incubated
together with the coated bead. During this time, free T4 in the sample competes with enzyme
conjugated T4 in the reagent for a limited number of antibody binding sites on the bead.
Unbound patient sample and enzyme conjugate are then removed by centrifugal washes.
Finally, chemiluminescent substrate is added to the reaction tube containing the bead and the

signal is generated in proportion to the bound enzyme.
IMMULITE 2000 Third Generation TSH: IMMULITE 2000 Third Generation TSH is a solid-
phase, two-site chemiluminescent immunometric assay. The solid phase (bead) is coated with
monoclonal murine anti-TSH antibody. The liquid phase consists of alkaline phosphatase
(bovine calf intestine) conjugated to polyclonal goat anti-TSH antibody. The patient sample
and the reagent are incubated together with the coated bead for 60 minutes. During this time,
TSH in the sample binds to enzyme conjugated anti-TSH antibody in the reagent, and then this
complex is captured by the anti-TSH antibody on the bead. Unbound patient sample and
enzyme conjugate are then removed by centrifugal washes. Finally, chemiluminescent
substrate is added to the reaction tube containing the bead and the signal is generated in
proportion to the bound enzyme.

IMMULITE 2000 Free T4: A pediatric reference range study using population age
from 1 month old to 20 years old was conducted. Serum samples were collected at 8
U.S. sites to be representative of the U.S. population diversity. The samples were
obtained from apparently healthy individuals who were not taking prescribed or over-the
counter medications in the 7 days prior to sample collection, or were not taking
contraceptive medication in the 90 days prior to sample collection, or were not pregnant.
Subject who are suspicious of premature/delayed puberty, or are positive for the presence of
autoantibody against Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) and Thyroglobulin (TG) are also excluded
from the study. All samples were shipped and tested at a single laboratory study site. A
total of 426 pediatric patient (81 infants, 197 children, and 148 adolescents) samples were
tested in singleton using four (4) reagent lots to establish the IMMULITE 2000 Free T4
reference ranges for the studied pediatric population. Results from the 2.5th to 97.5th
percentile were used as the pediatric reference ranges. The reference interval for the
infant group was calculated using the robust symmetrical method to accommodate the
smaller sample size of this population. A non- parametric approach was used to
establish the reference intervals for children and adolescents based on the CLSI C28-A3
recommendation because the sample size was greater than 120. Reference ranges are
summarized in the table below.

IMMULITE 2000 Third Generation TSH: A pediatric reference range study using
population age from 1 month old to 20 years old was conducted. Serum samples were
collected at 8 U.S. sites to be representative of the U.S. population diversity. All
samples were shipped and tested at a single laboratory study site. A total of 433 pediatric
patient (90 infants, 195 children, and 148 adolescents) samples were tested in singleton
using three (3) reagent lots to establish the IMMULITE 2000 Third Generation TSH
reference ranges for the studied pediatric population. Results from the 2.5th to 97.5th
percentile were used as the pediatric reference ranges. The reference interval for the
infant group was calculated by performing a log-transformation of the raw data
followed by the application of the robust symmetric method to the transformed data.
This approach was selected to be most appropriate for the smaller sample size as the
data from this population was highly skewed to the right and a transformation was
necessary to obtain a normal distribution. The sponsor has language in their package
insert explaining the uncertainty in the value for the upper limit of the reference range.
A non- parametric approach was used to establish the reference intervals for children
and adolescents based on the CLSI C28-A3 recommendation because the sample size
was greater than 120. Reference ranges are summarized in the table below.
Age Range Reference Ranges
Infants (01 – 23 months) 0.83 - 6.5 µIU/mL
Children (02 – 12 years) 0.58 - 4.1 µIU/mL
