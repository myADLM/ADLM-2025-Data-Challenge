L. Test Principle:
The LIAISON® HAV IgM assay is an antibody capture chemiluminescence immunoassay
(CLIA). The principal components of the test are magnetic particles (solid phase) coated with
IgG to human IgM (mouse monoclonal) and a conjugate of a mouse monoclonal antibody to
HAV linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antibody conjugate). During the first
incubation, IgM antibodies present in calibrators, samples or controls bind to the solid phase.
After a wash step, HAV antigen and conjugate are dispensed into the reaction module and
incubated. During this second incubation, the antibody conjugate reacts with HAV antigen
and the immune complex thus formed reacts with IgM already bound to the solid phase.
Unbound material is then removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently, the starter reagents are
added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is thus induced. The light signal, and hence
the amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate, is measured by a photomultiplier as relative
light units (RLU) and is indicative of anti-HAV IgM present in calibrators, samples or
controls.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
REPRODUCIBILITY STUDY:
A 5 day reproducibility study was conducted at 3 external laboratories. The CLSI document
EP15-A3 was consulted in the preparation of the testing protocol. A coded panel comprised
of 6 frozen serum samples was prepared by DiaSorin. The coded panel was prepared by
either spiking or diluting samples as necessary to contain negative, low positive and mid
positive samples.
The coded panel was tested at all 3 sites, using 3 replicates per run in 2 runs per day for 5
operating days. The mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation (%CV) of the
results were computed for each of the tested specimens for each of the sites and across sites.
The LIAISON® Control HAV IgM (negative and positive) were also included in the 5 day
study. The LIAISON® HAV IgM Negative Control as well as negative panel sample
(HAVM-P00) read below the detectable limit of the curve (0.10); therefore, standard
deviation (SD) and %CV were calculated using the Relative Light Units (RLUs) for these
two samples.

--- Page 6 ---
The results from the reproducibility study are summarized in Table 4 below (combined sites).
The mean Index value, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation (%CV) of the results
were computed for each of the tested specimens for intra- run, run to run, between site, and
total across sites.

PRECISION STUDY:
A 20 day precision study was performed at DiaSorin, Inc. A coded panel comprised of 6
frozen serum samples was prepared by DiaSorin. The coded panel was prepared by either
spiking or diluting samples as necessary to contain negative, low positive and mid positive
samples. The controls of the LIAISON® Control HAV IgM (negative and positive) were also
tested in the 20-day study. The CLSI document EP5-A3 was consulted in the preparation of
the testing protocol.
The panel samples and kit controls were tested on 2 LIAISON® HAV IgM kit lots in 2
replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 20 operating days on one LIAISON® Analyzer. The
mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation (%CV) of the results were computed
for each of the tested specimens.
The 20-day combined 2 lot results are summarized in Table 5 as sample overall mean result,
SD, and %CV computed for Between-Lot/Within-Site and Total (Across Lots Within-Site).

d. Detection limit:
This device is for the qualitative detection of HAV IgM antibody and contains an equivocal
zone. The detection limit is therefore not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross Reactivity:
The cross-reactivity panel was comprised of 251 specimens to evaluate potential interference
from antibodies to other viruses that may cause symptoms similar to HAV infection (i.e., EBV,
CMV, Rubella, HBV, HCV), other organisms that may cause infectious disease (i.e., VZV, HSV,
Measles, Mumps, Toxoplasma gondii) and from other conditions that may result from atypical
immune system activity (i.e., rheumatoid factor (RF), antinuclear autoantibodies (ANA), hyper
γ-globulins). The cross-reactivity experiments were conducted at DiaSorin. The IgM anti-HAV
serological status of the sample panels was determined using the DiaSorin ETI-HAIgMK PLUS
(P890014) FDA approved kit as the reference. The serological reactivity for the potential cross-
reactant was confirmed using various commercially available FDA cleared/approved kits (when
applicable). The results obtained are summarized in Table 7 below. No cross-reactivity was
noted in the specimens tested.

Interference:
The potential interference of each of the following substances at the indicated concentration
(indicated in the table below) was tested on three samples close to the decision point. For each of
the interfering substance, the three samples were divided into equal aliquots, and spiked with the
indicated concentration of the interfering substance. The matched spiked and unspiked samples
were tested in the same run, on one instrument with one LIAISON® HAV IgM kit lot in twenty-
six replicates each, alternating the replicates of the two samples. The results are indicated in
Table 8 below. No interference was observed from the potentially interfering substances at the
tested concentration.

Verification of Cut-off Values:
The cut-off values for the LIAISON® HAV IgM assay (K082050) are set at Index values of 0.9
and 1.1. There is an Equivocal Zone for samples giving Index values ≥ 0.9 and < 1.1. A cut-off
study was carried out to verify that the cut-off values for the K082050 assay apply also to the
modified LIAISON® HAV IgM assay (K160650). A total of 380 serum specimens were tested
with the LIAISON® HAV IgM assay in the cut-off verification study and the results were
compared to those obtained with the DiaSorin ETI-HA-IGMK Plus assay (P890014/S002).
Testing included the following three sets of specimens:
i. 121 adult patient samples sent to the laboratory for HAV testing (prospectively collected
specimens).
ii. 121 samples from a pediatric population (prospectively collected specimens).
iii. 138 samples from patients with an acute HAV infection (retrospective, archived
specimens).
The results for each set of specimens are presented separately below.
i. Adult Prospectively Collected Specimens.
The specimens were prospectively collected from adults in the United Sates. The 121 individuals
from the HAV testing population were 66.1% female (n=80), ranging in age from 21 to 90, and
33.9% male (n=41) ranging in age from 21 to 80. Table 9 shows the comparison of the
LIAISON® HAV IgM to the ETI-HA-IGMK PLUS for these specimens.

121 samples, 43.8% were female subjects (n=53) and 56.2% were male subjects (n=68),
ranging in age from 8 months to 20 years of age. Table 10 shows the comparison of the
LIAISON® HAV IgM to the ETI-HA-IGMK PLUS for the pediatric specimens.

iii. Specimens from Patients with Acute HAV Infection.
This set of archived specimens consisted of 138 serum samples from individuals with acute HAV
infection that had been diagnosed serologically. Table 11 shows the comparison of the LIAISON®
HAV IgM to the ETI-HA-IGMK PLUS for these specimens.
