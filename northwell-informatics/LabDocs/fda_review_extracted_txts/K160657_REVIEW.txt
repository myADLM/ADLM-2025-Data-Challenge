H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indication for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The BD Vacutainer® Barricor™ Lithium HeparinN Plasma Blood Collection Tubes (BD
Barricor™ Tubes) are used to collect, separate, process, transport and store venous blood
samples for use in chemistry determinations, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), and
zinc testing in plasma for in vitro diagnostic use. It is used in settings where a venous
blood sample is collected by a trained healthcare worker.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use only.
The BD Barricor™ Tube is not designed for use with fixed angle centrifuges. If spun in a
fixed angle centrifuge, a barrier between the plasma and the cellular material will not be
formed. The BD Barricor™ Tube is designed for use with swing bucket centrifuges.
These blood collection tubes are not intended to be used to collect blood specimens for
blood banking, immunohematology test, infectious disease, lithium, and Di (2-
ethylhexyl) phthalate determination.
The BD Barricor™ Tube is not designed for use with open blood collection systems
(manual filling of tube with the BD Hemogard™ removed) due to the increased risk of
exposure to blood borne pathogens. Blood should be collected directly into the tube or
transfer devices should be used if blood is collected in a syringe.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Specific analyzers used to evaluate the device are listed in the labeling and below in
section M. 2. a. Method Comparison.
I. Device Description:
The BD Vacutainer® BarricorTM Lithium Heparin Plasma Blood Collection Tubes (BD
Barricor™ Tube) are sterile (interior), single-use, evacuated blood collection tubes. The
tubes are comprised of a plastic tube containing a mechanical separator (in place of gel), a
low-zinc stopper and a plastic BD Hemogard™ color-coded lime green safety-engineered
shield. The interior of the BD Barricor™ Tube is spray coated with lithium heparin
anticoagulant. The tube stopper and mechanical separator are lubricated with silicone based
surfactant. The tubes are available in 13 x 75mm and 13 x 100mm configurations with draw
volumes from 3.0 to 5.5 mL. The BD Barricor™ Tube is designed to be compatible with
current phlebotomy and clinical laboratory practice. It employs a novel separation
technology, a mechanical separator, which remains stable in its initial position, to enable the
2

--- Page 3 ---
blood to be filled via current methods and subsequently creates a stable, robust barrier during
processing. The mechanical separator is comprised of two materials of different densities - an
elastomer and a higher density base material. In its resting position, the diameter of the
mechanical separator is greater than that of the tube. The resulting friction from this interface
allows the separator to maintain its position and orientation prior to blood collection and
permits filling of the tube. Under centrifugation, the force applied on the separator will
correctly orient the separator and allows it to move within the tube. While immersed in the
collected sample, the differential buoyancy of the two materials will stretch the separator
enabling the passage of cellular content and appropriate positioning of the separator between
the cell column and plasma sample. When centrifugation stops, the mechanical separator
returns to its original shape to form a barrier between the plasma sample (at the top), which is
subsequently available for analysis, and the sedimented cells below.

L. Test Principle:
The BD Vacutainer® Barricor™ Lithium Heparin Plasma Blood Collection Tube is intended
to be placed inside any BD Vacutainer® Needle Holders of the standard size or an adapter of
a blood collection system. Once the vein of the patient has been penetrated using a standard
needle, center the collection tube in the holder and push the tube fully onto the needle,
puncturing the stopper of the tube. Hold the tube in place to ensure complete vacuum draw.
The tube uses a controlled vacuum to pull a specific volume of blood into the sterile interior
of the tube. Once the pressure is equalized, the blood flow ceases and the tube is removed
from the needle holder or needle. Immediately after the blood has been drawn, the tube is
gently inverted 8 times to mix the blood with the anticoagulant. The BD Barricor™ Tubes
are centrifuged at 4000 RCF (relative centrifuge force or g’s) for 3 minutes in a swing bucket
centrifuge within 2 hours of collection. Once a complete barrier formed between the plasma
(at the top of the tube) and the cellular components (at the bottom of the tube), the plasma
portion of the sample is removed for various clinical laboratory testing.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Two studies were conducted to assess the repeatability (within tube), lot-to-lot
variation (between lots), and tube-to-tube (between tube) variation in BD Barricor™
Tubes. The study designs included subjects from the clinical settings. Three lots of
each of BD Barricor™ Tubes (candidate device), BD PST™ Plasma Tubes, and BD
Serum Tubes were tested and evaluated.
The first study was performed using samples collected from 35 subjects and evaluated
the BD Barricor™ Tube performance for 15 representative routine and special
chemistry analytes: Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Total Bilirubin (T Bili),
Calcium (Ca), Chloride (Cl), Cortisol, Complement C3 (C3), Glucose, Lactate
Dehydrogenase (LDH), Phosphorus (Phos), Potassium (K), Total Protein, Thyroxine
(T4), Testosterone (Testo), Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Prostate Specific Antigen
(PSA).
The second study assessed performance for 5 representative therapeutic drugs:
Carbamazepine (CBZ), Acetaminophen (ACET), Digoxin (DIG), Phenytoin (PHT),
and Vancomycin (VANCO).
All samples were run in duplicate on the two instrument platforms, Roche cobas®
6000 and the Beckman UniCel DxC 680i. Both instrument platforms yielded similar
results. One representative platform with precision results is summarized in the tables
below (one table with %CV, one table with SD).

For Folate, stability was established for 24 hours, while Glucose and CO
2
demonstrated stability for 18 hrs with room temperature storage. Within tube
analyte stability was demonstrated for CRP for up to 24 hrs with room temperature
storage and up to 7 days of refrigerated storage.
βhCG, PSA, CKMB, TnI, and TnT were only tested for 24 hrs at room temperature
and demonstrated stability at that time point.
Within tube analyte stability was demonstrated for all therapeutic drugs for up to 48
hours of storage at room temperature and up to 7 days of refrigerated storage.
iii. Additional bench testing evaluated on the candidate device:
Clinical and benchtop studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of various
centrifugation conditions on sample quality and analyte stability in the BD
Barricor™ Tubes at multiple time points. The study protocols were reviewed and
performance was considered acceptable at the recommended centrifugation range.
Additional studies were conducted to assess draw volume, Zinc testing, stopper
closure assembly stability, stopper pull out force, and simulated ship testing,
including both pre-use shipping testing and post-centrifugation (after blood
collection and centrifugation) ship testing. Study protocols, acceptance criteria and
results for these studies were provided and found to be acceptable.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To demonstrate comparable performance with the comparator device, apparently
healthy subjects and patients admitted into hospitals with various diseases were used.
Testing was performed at seven different clinical and hospital sites. All subjects in the
comparative studies have blood samples collected into the BD BarricorTM tubes
(candidate device) and the comparator tubes (BD PSTTM (k945952) for chemistry and
BD Serum tube (k960250) for TDM) at the same time. The specimens collected in
10

--- Page 11 ---
BD Serum tube (for TDM) were allowed to clot, and the serum was removed for
testing immediately after centrifugation according to the instructions provided in the
labeling. Evaluations were performed on a selective common general chemistry
analytes, immunology analytes, special chemistry analytes, cardiac markers, and
therapeutic drug monitoring analytes on multiple instrument platforms. A total of 62
analytes (55 chemistry and 7 TDM) were evaluated and demonstrated comparable
results between the candidate tube and the comparator tubes. A small number of
spiked samples were also prepared to obtain abnormal low or high values for selected
analytes. Summary of the results (Deming or Passing-Bablok regressions correlations
with 95% confidence intervals) on one representative platform with the analytes and
instruments evaluated are provided in the tables below:

The sponsor stated the following: “Whenever changing any manufacturer’s blood
collection tube, type, size, handling, processing or storage condition for a particular
laboratory assay, the laboratory personnel should review the storage conditions for a
particular laboratory assay, the laboratory personnel should review the tube
manufacturer’s data and their own data to establish/verify the reference range for
specific instrument/reagent system. Based on such information, the laboratory can
then decide if changes are appropriate.”
Summary of all the studies:
