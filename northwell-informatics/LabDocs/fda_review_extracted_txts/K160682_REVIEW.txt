L. Test Principle:
The active ingredients on the Contour® NEXT Test Strips are the enzyme, FAD dependent
glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH), and an electron mediator. When a blood sample fills
the reaction zone of the test strip, a chemical reaction occurs in which the FAD-GDH enzyme
causes electrons to pass from glucose molecules to co-factor and the mediator in the test
strip. New software in the Contour® NEXT One meter converts the electrical current
measurement into glucose concentration and displays the result on the meter LCD screen.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run precision was performed using five venous whole blood samples spiked
with glucose to five levels. Three test strip lots and ten meters were used for this
study. The samples tested ranged from 40-336mg/dL. Each sample was tested ten
times on each of ten meters. The average, SD and CV was calculated for each
sample. The combined mean, pooled standard deviation and pooled CV for each
glucose concentration were calculated using results from all three reagent lots. The
results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed measuring range for this device is 20-600 mg/dL.
Linearity was evaluated using twenty four Contour NEXT ONE meters, three lots of
test strips and venous whole blood samples adjusted to twelve glucose levels (17, 40,
77, 136, 196, 256, 315, 375, 435, 495, 555 and 615 mg/dL). For each sample, twenty
four replicate Contour NEXT ONE readings were obtained with each of three
Contour Next lots. The values from the Contour NEXT ONE meters were compared
with those obtained from the reference method. The results from regression analysis
are summarized below:
Lot #1: y=0.967x+0.99; R2 = 0.999
Lot #2: y=1.000x+0.57; R2 = 0.999
Lot #3: y=0.988x+1.49; R2 = 0.999
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of
20 to 600 mg/dL. The meter will display “LO” when the result is less than 20 mg/dL
and “HI” when result is greater than 600 mg/dL. Studies were performed by the
sponsor demonstrating that these features function as intended.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Contour Next Test strip stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
for to be acceptable in k111268. The manufacture claims shelf life stability and open
vial stability of 24 months when stored at 41°F- 86°F (5°C-30°C) and 10-80% R.H.
Contour Next Control solution stability protocols and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and for to be acceptable in k151742. The manufacturer claims shelf life
stability for the Contour Next Control Solutions of 18 months and an open vial
stability of 6 months when stored at 48-86°F (9°-30°C).
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study in Section M1b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity was assessed for twenty three endogenous and exogenous
substances with two venous blood samples with two levels of glucose (approximately
80mg/dL and 300mg/dL). Each sample was divided into a test pool containing the
potential interfering substance and a control pool. The absolute and % difference
between the test and control samples measured on the Contour Next One meter were
calculated and the concentration tested at which no significant interference (as
defined by the sponsor as within ±10 mg/dL difference at 80mg/dL level and within
±10% difference at 300mg/dL level relative to the control sample) was observed is
presented in the table below:

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1) Altitude study: To evaluate the effect of altitude on the Contour Next One Blood
Glucose Monitoring System, venous blood samples at approximately 45, 67, 134 and 400
mg/dL levels were tested under simulated altitude conditions. The evaluation included
10 meters and 2 test strip lots. The meter results were compared to those obtained with
the reference method (YSI 2300). The results demonstrate acceptable bias to the
reference to support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 20,674 feet have no
significant effect on blood glucose measurements from the Contour Next One Blood
Glucose Monitoring System.
2) Hematocrit: A study was performed to evaluate the effect of blood hematocrit on the
performance of the Contour NEXT ONE Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Venous
blood samples at 4 glucose levels (40, 120, 350 and 520 mg/dL) were tested using three
Contour Next Test Strip lots and 24 meters. Glucose concentrations at each hematocrit
level (15, 30, 42, 55 and 65%) for were compared with the reference method (YSI 2300).
The resulting % bias relative to YSI demonstrated acceptable performance across the
claimed hematocrit range of 15 – 65%.
3) Operating Temperature and Humidity: Operating temperature and humidity
conditions were evaluated using 15 meters and 2 test strip lots with venous whole blood
samples at four glucose levels (40, 120, 350, and 525 mg/dL). The following temperature
and humidity conditions were tested: 5°C/10% RH, 5°C/93%, 25°C/50%, 45°C/10%,
45°C/93%. The results support the sponsor’s claimed operating temperature from 41°F
to 113°F (5°C to 45°C) and 10% to 93% Relative Humidity.
4) EMC testing and Electrical Safety Studies: The sponsor provided appropriate
documentation certifying that electromagnetic (EMC) and wireless coexistent testing was
performed and the Contour NEXT ONE Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems was found
to be compliant.
5) Readability Assessment: A Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level assessment was conducted on
the CONTOUR Next ONE User Guide and CONTOUR Next One Quick reference guide
and the results demonstrated that the labeling was written at lower than 8th grade level.
6) Infection control studies: The device is intended for single patient use only.
Disinfection efficacy was performed on the materials comprising the meter demonstrating
complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfecting agents,
11

--- Page 12 ---
Clorox® Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes (EPA reg. 67619-12) and Clorox®
Healthcare Hydrogen Peroxide Wipes (EPA reg. 67619-25). Robustness studies were
performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or
external materials of the meter after 260 cleaning and disinfection cycles (representing
weekly disinfection for 5 years, the expected lifetime of the meter) with Clorox
Germicidal Wipes (EPA Registration #67619-12). The subject device labeling was
reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
7) Customer service is available 8:00 am through midnight Eastern Time, 365 days a year.
