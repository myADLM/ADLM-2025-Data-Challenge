to quantitatively measure C-reactive protein (CRP) in human serum and plasma. CRP is
used to evaluate conditions thought to be associated with inflammation in otherwise
healthy individuals.

I. Device Description:
The VITROS Chemistry Products hsCRP Reagent is being modified due to a change in the
traceability of the assay. When initially cleared in k041799, the assay was traceable to ERM-
DA470/IFCC and now the assay is traceable to ERM-DA474/IFCC. The reagent is
otherwise unchanged since it was cleared in k041799.
The VITROS Chemistry Products hsCRP Reagent consists of two liquid reagents. Reagent 1
is a buffering solution that contains bovine serum albumin, a polymer, and a preservative.
Reagent 2 contains latex particles coated with anti-CRP mouse monoclonal antibodies in a
buffered solution and a preservative.

L. Test Principle:
Samples are mixed with a buffering solution (Reagent 1), followed by the addition of anti-
CRP antibodies coupled to latex microparticles (Reagent 2), which produces an
immunochemical reaction yielding CRP antigen/antibody complexes. The turbidity is
measured spectrophotometrically at 660 nm. Once a calibration has been performed for each
reagent lot, the CRP concentration in each unknown sample can be determined using the
stored calibration curve and the measured absorbance obtained in the assay of the sample.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To verify that precision has not changed as a result of the modification, three human
serum sample pools with mean CRP concentrations of approximately 1, 10 and 14
mg/L were tested. Five replicates of three serum sample pools were run once per day
for five days using two hsCRP Reagent lots and two Calibrator Kit 17 lots across
three VITROS Chemistry Systems. The total imprecision estimates include within
run and between run. The sponsor concluded that the precision claims are
unchanged. The results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study followed the recommendations in CLSI EP6-A. A high CRP
concentration serum pool was mixed with different proportions of a low CRP serum
sample to generate 13 concentrations ranging from 0.040 to 17.5 mg/L. Each sample
was tested in triplicate determinations on the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System,
VITROS 4600 Chemistry System and the VITROS 5600 Integrated System. Linear
results were compared to 2nd and 3rd order polynomial fits against a pre-specified
allowable error. The deviation of linearity was found to be no more than 13.7%
within the claimed linear interval.

The sponsor claims a linearity range of 0.34 to 15.0 mg/L.
The following table summarizes the results obtained for the linear regression

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The assay is now traceable to the IRMM (Institute for Reference Materials and
Measurements) ERM-DA474/IFCC Reference Material, which in turn is traceable to
the ERM-DA470 reference material.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ)
were determined according to CLSI EP17-A2. The LoB and LoD estimates were
evaluated separately for each reagent lot on each VITROS Chemistry System and the
reagent lot and analyzer combination yielding the highest value was used for the LoB,
LoD and LoQ claims.
To determine the limit of the blank (LoB), five replicates of three blank samples were
run once per day for three days using two hsCRP Reagent lots and two Calibrator Kit
17 lots on three VITROS Chemistry Systems (i.e., 1 VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry
analyzer, 1 VITROS 4600 Chemistry analyzer and 1 VITROS 5600 Integrated
analyzer) for a total of 90 measurements per reagent lot per system (and 540 total test
results). The LoB data were assessed nonparametrically. The blank sample
measurements were sorted from lowest to highest for each reagent lot and analyzer.
The LoB was determined to be 0.21 mg/L.
To determine the limit of the detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ),
human serum samples with concentrations ranging from approximately 0.2 mg/L to
0.5 mg/L CRP were prepared. Five replicates of four patient samples were run once
per day for five days using two hsCRP Reagent lots and two Calibrator Kit 17 lots
across three VITROS Chemistry Systems totaling 1200 determinations (50
measurements per lot per sample for each system). The Limit of Detection (LoD) was
calculated parametrically following the recommendations in the CLSI guideline. The
LoD was determined to be 0.26 mg/L.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was calculated using the data generated for the LoD
study and was based on an imprecision goal of less than 20% CV. The LoQ was set

to 0.34 mg/L based on the sample/instrument/reagent lot combination with the highest
imprecision observed in the study (<13%CV).
The measuring range is 0.34 mg/L to 15 mg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
The reagent is identical to the reagent cleared in k041799. The analytical specificity
study was conducted in k041799 and the claims are unchanged.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
One hundred and nineteen unmodified serum samples were tested using the candidate
device on the VITROS 5600, 4600, and 5,1 Systems and the predicate method. Of
the 119 samples tested 113 were within the measuring range of both the VITROS
hsCRP assay and the predicate device. The samples had concentrations ranging from
0.37 to 17.97 mg/L.
An ordinary least squares linear regression analysis of the VITROS hsCRP assay on
the VITROS 5600 System versus the predicate device was performed. The results are
summarized below:
Y = 1.02 X + 0.26, correlation coefficient = 0.99
The results from the VITROS Chemistry Products hsCRP Reagent on the VITROS
4600 and VITROS 5,1 Chemistry Systems were also used to compare with the results
using the VITROS 5600 Integrated System using ordinary least squares linear
regression analysis. The samples had concentrations ranging from ≈ 0.4 to ≈15 mg/L.

b. Matrix comparison:
The reagent is identical to the reagent cleared in k041799. Comparison studies
between serum and lithium heparin plasma samples were conducted in k041799 and
the claims are unchanged.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor verified the reference interval established using the predicate device
following the recommendations in the CLSI guideline EP28-A3c “Defining, Establishing,
and Verifying Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory; Approved Guideline—
Third Edition” by using serum samples from 47 apparently healthy subjects. The sponsor
claims a reference interval of <5 mg/L.
The sponsor also provides the following information in the package insert:
Reference intervals may differ for each population studied and therefore each laboratory
should confirm the validity of these intervals for the population it serves. Increases in
CRP values are non-specific and should be interpreted together with a complete clinical
history. Follow-up testing of patients with elevated CRP values should be performed.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
