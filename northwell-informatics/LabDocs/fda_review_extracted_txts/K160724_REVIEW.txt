b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was conducted following the CLSI EP06-A guidelines. A set nine
samples ranging from 1 to 1372 U/L were prepared by serial dilution of a high
concentration sample of creatine kinase using a low concentration sample. Each
dilution was assayed in replicates of three. Data were analyzed using weighted linear
regression analysis and a 2nd and 3rd order polynomial regressions of the mean
observed analyte values vs. expected concentrations were generated. The result of
regression analysis is shown below.
Regression equation, y = 1.00x + 0.5, R = 1.00
The linearity study data supports the claimed measuring range of 15 to 1300U/L.
Dilution Recovery Studies: Studies were performed to analyze the recovery of
samples containing high levels of creatine kinase outside the claimed measuring
range of 15 to 1300U/L by diluting the sample 6-fold and retesting with the candidate
device. The high level sample dilution can be performed either manually or using the
automated dilution feature on the ADVIA Chemistry 1800 system.
Automated Dilution Recovery – Five serum samples with creatine kinase values
greater than the ADVIA Chemistry CK_L assay range of 15 to 1300U/L were
assayed with ADVIA Chemistry CK_L assay on the ADVIA Chemistry 1800 system
using the automated dilution feature. In addition, the same creatine kinase sample
were manually diluted with saline at an equivalent dilution ratio (1:6) as the
automated feature, and assayed on with the ADVIA Chemistry CK_L assay on the
ADVIA Chemistry 1800 system. The values obtained using the ADVIA Chemistry
CK_L automated dilution feature were then compared to the values that were
obtained from the manual dilution. A summary of the automated dilution data is
presented below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Assay Traceability - The ADVIA Chemistry CK_L assay is traceable to the SI units
(mkat/L) through the IFCC Primary Reference Method for CK via patient sample
correlation.
Calibrator Traceability - The assigned values of the ADVIA Chemistry ENZ 3
Calibrator is traceable to the SI units through the IFCC Primary Reference Method
for Creatine Kinase. Traceability chain is established using the primary IFCC
reference procedure and primary reference material of endogenous patient sample
anchor pools.
Calibrator Value Assignment - The ADVIA ENZ 3 calibrator base material is a 5%
human serum albumin (HSA) solution with preservatives. An enzyme stock solution,
used to spike the calibrators, is prepared in HSA matrix. This stock solution is
gravimetrically spiked at a target concentration of creatine kinase MM isoform from
human heart. The stock solution concentration is determined by comparing the
recovery of the stock solution versus the Master Lot assigned bottle values.
Calculated quantities of the stock solution are added to the base to target
concentration to produce the calibrator lot. The concentration of CK is verified to be
within acceptable range by using an instrument calibrated with Master Lot
Calibrators.
Stability of calibrators - The ADVIA ENZ 3 calibrator shelf life and open vial
stability studies are performed following the CLSI EP25-A guidelines. The
predetermined acceptance criteria and protocols were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The ADVIA ENZ 3 calibrator has a target shelf life of 12 months when
stored at -25 to -20ºC. The calibrator must be thawed at room temperature before use.
Once the cap is removed, the assigned values are stable for 30 days when recapped
immediately and stored at 2-8 ºC. The sponsor states that the ongoing stability
monitoring will be performed to assess the stability of the ADVIA ENZ 3 calibrator
using real time data at each time point tested throughout the claimed shelf life of the
product. The acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable..

d. Detection limit:
A limit of blank (LoB) study was conducted using five blank samples according to
CLSI EP17-A2. Deionized water is used as the blank sample. The samples were
tested in replicates of five on the ADVIA Chemistry 1800 system over three days
using three lots (N=75 per lot). LoB was calculated non-parametrically. Based on
the results, the LoB claim was 3 U/L.
A limit of detection study (LoD) was conducted using five low level samples (serum
samples diluted with saline). These samples were prepared by diluting five separate
pools of serum with saline to obtain five samples at 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 U/L of creatine
kinase. These samples were tested in replicates of five on the ADVIA Chemistry
1800 system over three days using three lots (N=75 per lot). LoD was calculated
parametrically following the CLSI guidelines. Based on the results, the LoD claim
was 6 U/L.
A limit of quantitation study (LoQ) was conducted using the ADVIA CK_L assay on
the ADVIA Chemistry 1800 system according to CLSI EP17-A2. Four separate
serum samples were prepared to target the desired LoQ at approximately 15 U/L and
frozen. Each samples was tested once per day in replicates of five using three reagent
lots over three days (N=15 per lot). The mean value, standard deviation (SD), bias
from the assigned value (on the IFCC traceable ADVIA Creatine Kinase assay
CKNAC) and total error (TE) was calculated for each sample across all replicates for
each reagent lot. The TE is calculated using the formula TE = 2SD + Bias. The LoQ
for the method was taken as the concentration value that gave the highest TE obtained
for each reagent lot within a defined total error. The LoQ for the ADVIA Chemistry
CK_L assay is 15 U/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed according to CLSI EP07 to determine the effects
of various endogenous and exogenous substances on the ADVIA Chemistry CK_L
assay using the ADVIA Chemistry 1800 system. For all interferents, the percent bias
was determined by testing a control sample without the interferent and comparing it
to the test sample spiked with the interferent. Each sample was tested in triplicate.
Interferents were tested at two levels of creatine kinase, 95±14 U/L and 265±40 U/L.
For each spiked sample, the percent recovery was determined using the formula,
% Recovery = [(Test result – control result) / control result] X 100
A recovery of ≤10% of control value was defined as non-significant interference. The
results of the highest concentration tested without significant interference are
summarized in the table below.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A split sample method comparison between the ADVIA Chemistry CK_L assay
versus the predicate ADVIA Chemistry CKNAC assay on the ADVIA Chemistry
1800 system was performed following the CLSI EP09-A3 guidelines. A total of 116
native human serum samples were assayed in singlicate across the assay range of 15
to 1300U/L. A total of ten samples were altered of which eight samples were diluted
with saline and two samples were altered by mixing two samples. None of the
samples were spiked samples. Analysis of the results using Deming regression
yielded the following:
Y= 1.01x - 1.8, R = 1.00.
Slope (95% CI) = 1.01 (1.00 to 1.02)

Method Comparison versus IFCC Reference Method – A split sample method
comparison between the ADVIA Chemistry CK_L assay on the ADVIA Chemistry
1800 system versus the IFCC certified creatine kinase reference method on the
Konelab 30i analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was performed following the CLSI
EP09-A3 guidelines. One hundred remnants de-identified human serum samples
were assayed in duplicate across the assay measuring range of 15 to 1300U/L;
however, only the first result was used in each analysis. Ten samples were diluted
with saline and no samples were spiked. The results were analyzed by Deming
(Orthogonal) regression. A summary of the IFCC method comparison data is
presented below.
Y= 1.05x – 6.9, R = 1.00.
Slope (95% CI) = 1.05 (1.03 to 1.07)

Y= ADVIA 1800 – CK_L (candidate device); Sample range, 16.00 to 1245 U/L.
b. Matrix comparison:
To characterize correlation between lithium heparin plasma and serum samples from
the whole blood samples collected in serum separator tubes (SST), a matrix
comparison study was performed using paired samples on the ADVIA Chemistry
System using the ADVIA Chemistry CK_L assay. Fifty sets of native samples with
serum creatine kinase level ranging from 37 to 1282 U/L. Five sets were spiked with
creatine kinase stock solution to cover the measuring range up between 859 U/L to
946 U/L. Two samples were excluded; one for hemolysis and the second was outside
the assay measuring range. Deming regression analysis was used to fit the ADVIA
CK_L results of the Li-heparinized plasma samples versus the SST serum samples. A
summary of the expected values is presented below.
