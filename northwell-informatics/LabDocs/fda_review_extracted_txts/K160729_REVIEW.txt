H. Intended Use/ Indications for Use:
1. Intended Use/ Indications for Use:
Immunoassay for the in vitro quantitative determination of PCT (procalcitonin) in
human serum and plasma (K2 and K3 EDTA, Li-Heparin).
The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay is intended for use to determine the change of
PCT over time as an aid in assessing the cumulative 28-day risk of all-cause
mortality for patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock in the Intensive
Care Unit (ICU) or when obtained in the emergency department or other medical
wards prior to ICU admission.
The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on
Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.
Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker associated with the inflammatory response to
bacterial infection that aids in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their
first day of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission for progression to severe sepsis
and septic shock. The percent change in PCT level over time aids in the prediction
of cumulative 28-day mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.
A PCT level that declines ≤ 80 % from the day that severe sepsis or septic shock
was clinically diagnosed (Day 0) to four days after clinical diagnosis (Day 4) is
associated with higher cumulative 28-day risk of all-cause mortality than a decline
> 80 %.
The combination of the first PCT level (≤ 2.0 ng/mL or > 2.0 ng/mL) at initial
diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock with the patient’s clinical course and the
change in PCT level over time until Day 4 provides important additional
information about the mortality risk.
The PCT level on Day 1 (the day after severe sepsis or septic shock is first
clinically diagnosed) can be used to calculate the percent change in PCT level at
Day 4 if the Day 0 measurement is unavailable.
The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT Calcheck 5 is an assayed control for use in calibration
verification and use in verification of the assay range established for the Elecsys
BRAHMS PCT assay on the Elecsys and cobas e analyzers.
2. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
Warnings and Precautions:
2

--- Page 3 ---
The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay should not be used as a sole basis for diagnosis
for determining the risk of 28 day all-cause mortality. Changes in PCT should
always be interpreted in the context of the clinical status of the patient and other
laboratory results. There is no uniformly recognized interpretation of the change in
PCT levels for the prediction of mortality, and overall mortality is strongly
dependent on many factors, including pre-existing patient risk factors and clinical
course. The need for continued ICU care at Day 4 and other covariates (e.g., age,
sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA score) are also significant predictors
of 28-day cumulative mortality risk. Validation of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT
assay as an aid in predicting mortality was performed in a study population with an
overall 28-day mortality of 22%.

L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay is a two-step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin
microparticles and an electrochemiluminescence detection system. The test system reagents
contain a biotinylated monoclonal PCT-specific antibody and a ruthenium labeled
monoclonal PCT-specific antibody.
Total duration of assay: 18 minutes.
• 1st incubation: Antigen in the sample (30 μL), a biotinylated monoclonal PCT-
specific antibody, and a monoclonal PCT-specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium
complex*) react to form a sandwich complex.
• 2nd incubation: After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex
becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin.
• The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are
magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then
removed with ProCell/ProCell M. Application of a voltage to the electrode then
induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.
• Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument specifically
generated by 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Reproducibility/Precision:
The repeatability and intermediate precision of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was
conducted using the cobas e 411 analyzer. Studies were performed in accordance with
CLSI guideline EP5-A3, “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative
Measurement Methods”. One reagent lot was evaluated.
The precision study was conducted using the study design of 21 days x 2 runs per day
x 2 replicates per sample. One (1) instrument was used for the study and calibration
was performed according to the Instructions for Use. Aliquots of six (6) human serum
samples and two (2) QC samples (PC PCT 1 and PC PCT 2) distributed over the
measuring range were assayed in duplicate and randomized order on the cobas e 411
analyzer using one lot of reagent.

Repeatability and Intermediate precision were calculated according to CLSI EP5-A3.
Analysis of the individual repeatability and within-site reproducibility data
demonstrated that the expected targets for these parameters were met or exceeded in
this evaluation. cobas e 411 analyzer repeatability %CV ranged from 0.0 to 2.8% with
a median value of 1.2%, while the cobas e 601 analyzer results ranged from 0.0 to
7.7% with a median value of 1.7%. cobas e 411 analyzer within-site reproducibility
%CV ranged from 0.0 to 7.7% with a median value of 2.1%, while the cobas e 601
analyzer results ranged from 0.8 to 7.7% with a median value of 2.0%.
Repeatability and within-site reproducibility based on the combined site and lot testing
data also met or exceeded the expected targets. Repeatability %CV for the cobas e
411 analyzer ranged from 1.16 to 2.77% with a median value of 1.59% while on the
cobas e 601 analyzer values ranged from 1.16 to 4.06% with a median value of 2.14%.
cobas e 411 analyzer within-site reproducibility %CV ranged from 0.98 to 4.75% with
a median value of 1.67%, while the cobas e 601 analyzer results ranged from 2.26 to

reagent lot.
The linearity data were analyzed with regards to linear, quadratic, and cubic
polynomials,
according to CLSI EP6-A. In the first step, a linearity check was performed with a first
order
(linear) regression, and then with higher order models (quadratic and cubic).
Linearity was confirmed in the range of 0.02 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL. The measuring-
range claim for the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay is 0.02–100 ng/mL.
Dilution Tests:
To demonstrate the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay dilution study, three (3) different
dilutions with dilution factors between 1:1 and 1:5 were prepared. Three (3) serum
samples and one (1) plasma sample were spiked with PCT to concentrations exceeding
the measuring range. The samples were diluted with serum (low PCT concentrations)
and recovery was investigated on the cobas e 411.
The PCT concentrations of the undiluted samples were calculated by multiplying the
result of the diluted samples using the appropriate dilution factor. The dilution study
results are demonstrated in the table below:

The maximum deviation was within +/- 20%. The mean of the deviation is within +/-
10%, meeting the acceptance criterion. The linearity of diluted samples was found
acceptable with all dilution steps.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Reagent Stability: After-Opening
Reagent on-board stability for the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was tested on one
Elecsys 2010 analyzer. A fresh reagent Rack Pack was placed on the analyzer and
calibrated. Reference values for the samples tested were determined. On day 7 and day
28 the same samples were determined with the same reagent kit (kept on board the
instrument) using the calibration curve of day 0 and day 21 respectively. Samples
tested in duplicate include five (5) human serum samples and two controls

(PreciControl PCT).
Testing demonstrated that the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay reagents are stable after
first opening for up to 12 weeks when stored at 2-8°C.
Reagent Stability: Real-Time Shelf Life
In the real-time, shelf-life stability study, the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT Assay was
stored at 2–8°C. The assay contains the reagents, the calibrators and the controls. The
stored assay was tested at time point 0 (at manufacture), 12, 25 and 31 months (up to
the planned shelf life plus one month) on the Elecsys 2010 using three (3) assay lots.
Two controls were tested in duplicate. The average recovery value was calculated as
percent recovery compared to the assigned value for PC PCT (Level 1 and 2). The
instrument maintains the on-board reagents at a constant temperature of 20 ± 3 C
temperature.
⁰ ⁰
Testing demonstrated that the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay reagents are stable for 24
months at 2–8°C based on real-time stability data.
PreciControl (Post-Reconstitution) Stability Study:
PreciControl stability for the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was evaluated using
reconstituted PreciControl PCT (Levels 1 and 2) that was stored for 3 month at −20°C.
Freshly reconstituted PreciControl PCT, and reconstituted PreciControl stored for 3
months at −20°C were measured in one run on the Elecsys 2010. Recovery of the
stressed PreciControl PCT compared to the freshly reconstituted PreciControl PCT
was calculated.
Testing demonstrated that the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay post-reconstitution
PreciControl PCT is stabile for 3 months at −20°C.
PreciControl (On-Board/Open-Vial) Stability Study:
PreciControl stability for the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was evaluated using
reconstituted PreciControl PCT (Levels 1 and 2) that was stored for 5 hours at 20 -
25°C. Freshly reconstituted PreciControl PCT, and reconstituted PreciControl PCT
stored for 5 hours at 20 - 25°C were measured in one run on the Elecsys 2010.
Recovery of the stressed PreciControl PCT compared to the freshly reconstituted
PreciControl PCT was calculated.
Testing demonstrated that the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay’s single use of
PreciControl PCT when the PreciControl is placed for 2 hours on board the analyzer.
Calibrator (Post Reconstitution) Stability Testing:
12

--- Page 13 ---
Calibrator stability for the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was evaluated using
reference and test material tested in duplicate on the Elecsys 2010. The test material is
reconstituted, stored for 3 month at -20°C. Reference material is a freshly reconstituted
set of calibrators. The test recovery is calculated as a percent of the reference value.
Testing demonstrated that the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay reconstituted PCT
Calibrators are stable at -20°C for 3 months freezing only once and for 4 hours at 20-
25°C.
Calibration (Lot) Stability Study:
The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was calibrated with a fresh reagent kit on Day 0
using one Elecsys 2010 analyzer. After 4, 8, and 12 weeks, a new reagent kit of the
same lot was used, with recovery of samples being determined using the calibration
curve established on Day 0 for that reagent kit lot. Five human serum (HS) samples
and two controls were tested in duplicate. Recovery compared to the reference value
was calculated as either deviation (in ng/mL).
The resulting data support the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay package-insert claim of 8
weeks lot calibration stability when using the same reagent kit lot.
Calibration (On-Board) Stability:
A fresh Elecsys BRAHMS PCT test kit was placed on an Elecsys 2010 analyzer and
calibrated. Five native human serum (HS) sample pools and two control samples were
tested with the fresh reagent kit; each sample was tested with 2-fold determination. On
day 7 and day 28 the same samples were determined with the same reagent kit (kept
on board of the instruments) using the calibration curve of day 0 and day 21
respectively. Each sample was tested with 2-fold determination.
Results demonstrate that Elecsys BRAHMS PCT reagent kits can be kept on board of
the instruments for up to 4 weeks (28 days). A new calibration of the kit kept on board
is recommended every 7 days.
Expected Values:
Controls: The PreciControl PCT assigned values was determined with the Elecsys
BRAHMS PCT assay. A human serum sample panel (Master Calibrators) covering the
entire measuring range is available, which is traceable to the PCT. The assigned values
for PreciControl PCT are read from the master calibration curve. Values are assigned
for each lot of PreciControl PCT in combination with each Elecsys PCT assay reagent
lot available. The controls are run in duplicate on at least six analyzers of the master
analyzer platform. The assigned value of each control level is defined as the median
value obtained over at least six determinations of the respective control level. For
additional analyzer platforms, the same value assignment procedure is performed. The
assigned values obtained on the additional analyzer are compared to those obtained on
13

the master platform.
Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay controls contain 2 levels of antigen concentration. Each
vial contains lyophilized recombinant PCT in serum matrix.
• PreciControl PCT 1: 0.50 ng/mL
• PreciControl PCT 2: 10 ng/mL
Calibrator: Calibrator value assignment tested was conducted and passed pre-defined
acceptance criteria. The target values for the two levels of the PCT Calset were chosen
to obtain the best fit with the Master Calibration Curve, together with the Rodbard
curve parameters encoded in the reagent barcode. For each Elecsys PCT CalSet lot
manufactured, the calibrators are run in duplicate on at least six cobas e 411 analyzers
and least three cobas e 601/cobas e 602/MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 analyzers
with all Elecsys BRAHMS PCT reagent lots available. The assigned value of each
calibrator is defined as the mean value obtained over at least six runs on at least three
analyzers of the respective calibrator.
Measurement values for PreciControl PCT (Levels 1 and 2), a single-analyte control
recommended for use to monitor accuracy and precision of the PCT analyte, are read
from the calibration curves generated. The pre-defined acceptance criteria for
PreciControl PCT have to be met to release the Assigned Values for the PCT CalSet.
The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay PCT Calibrators contains 2 levels of antigen
concentration. Each vial contains lyophilized recombinant PCT in serum matrix.
• PCT Cal1 - PCT Calibrator 1: 0.10 ng/mL
• PCT Cal2 - PCT Calibrator 2: 54 ng/mL
CalCheck 5: Calcheck 5 value assignment testing was conducted and passed pre-
defined acceptance criteria. For each Elecsys BRAHMS PCT CalCheck 5 lot
manufactured, each CalCheck is run in duplicate on at least six analyzers of the master
analyzer platform. The assigned valued of each CalCheck level is defined as the mean
value obtained over at least six determinations (duplicate runs on at least three
analyzers) of the respective CalCheck level.
The CalCheck assigned range is calculated as ±30% of the assigned value for levels
two through five. The label states that each laboratory should establish appropriate
acceptance criteria when using this product for its intended use. The same value
assignment procedure is performed on the cobas e 601 analyzer. The assigned values
obtained are compared to those obtained on the cobas e 411 analyzer. The mean value
obtained on the additional analyzer must be within 10% of the master platform
assigned value. After this acceptance criterion is met, the assigned values from the
master platform are deemed valid for the Elecsys 2010, MODULAR ANALYTICS
E170, cobas e 411, cobas e 601, and cobas e 602 analyzers.

d. Limit of Blank:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was determined
according to
CLSI guideline EP17-A2, “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative
Measurement Methods”. The LoB is the highest observed measurement value for an
analyte-free
sample. The LoB was determined as the 95th percentile of blank-sample
measurements.
The distribution of values for five (5) analyte-free serum samples was determined with
one (1) reagent lot on one (1) cobas e 411 analyzer over three (3) days for six (6) runs
total. The samples were measured in two-fold determination for each run. A total of 60
measuring points were collected. The data was evaluated as the linear interpolation of
the 57th and 58th ranked observation.
The LoB value was determined to be 0.011 ng/mL. The LoB claim for the Elecsys
BRAHMS PCT assay is 0.015 ng/mL.
e. Limit of Detection:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was determined
according to CLSI guideline EP17-A2, “Protocol for Determination of Limits of
Detection and Limits of Quantitation”. The distribution of values for five (5) low-level
human serum samples was determined with one (1) reagent lot on one (1) cobas e 411
analyzer over three (3) days for six (6) runs total. The samples were measured in two-
fold determination for each run. A total of 60 measuring points were collected for each
analyzer.
The LoD value was determined to be 0.0181 ng/mL. The LoD claim for the Elecsys
BRAHMS PCT assay is 0.02 ng/mL.
f. Limit of Quantitation:
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was determined
according to CLSI guideline EP17-A2, “Protocol for Determination of Limits of
15

--- Page 16 ---
Detection and Limits of Quantitation”. The LoQ was calculated based on intermediate
precision according to CLSI EP17-A2. The LoQ was determined as the lowest
concentration of analyte that can be quantified with an intermediate precision of no
more than 20%.
A five-day precision experiment was carried out with one (1) reagent lot on one cobas
e 411
analyzer. Samples tested included five (5) human serum (HS) samples with
concentrations from
LoB to two (2) times the LoQ. Samples were measured in five-fold determination for
each run. A total of 125 measuring points were collected.
The mean values and the intermediate precision (coefficient of variation and standard
deviation) for each LoQ sample were calculated. To determine the LoQ, samples were
sorted according to the concentration of their measured mean value. The LoQ is
defined as the mean value of the sample that is first to fulfill the specification for
intermediate precision, and for which there is no lower-concentration sample that
exceeds the specification. The LoQ data is represented in the table below:

Hama Effect:
The effect of the presence of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) on the Elecsys
BRAHMS PCT assay was assessed on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer. A suitable HAMA
serum sample was spiked with PCT analyte at multiple concentrations covering the
clinically relevant range. In parallel, a control (human serum) sample was spiked with
the same levels of analyte. For each analyte concentration, a series of 11 dilutions of
the HAMA sample and control sample were each prepared and measured in duplicate.
There was no HAMA interference observed for PCT analyte with the Elecsys
BRAHMS PCT assay.
i. High-Dose Hook Effect:
There is no high-dose hook effect at PCT concentrations up to 1,000 ng/mL PCT.
j. Assay Cut-off:
ΔPCT ≤ 80%
A decrease in the PCT levels below or equal to 80% defines a positive ΔPCT test
result representing a higher risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients diagnosed
with severe sepsis or septic shock.
ΔPCT > 80%
A decrease in the PCT levels of more than 80% defines a negative ΔPCT result
representing a lower risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients diagnosed with
severe sepsis or septic shock.

k. Specimen Stability:
Sample Stability at 2-8oC:
A study was performed to evaluate Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay’s ability to generate
analogous results when using fresh and stored samples. Ten spiked samples for each
sample type (Serum Separation Tube, Plasma Separation Tube (LH), Li-Heparin-, K2-
EDTA-, and K3-EDTA Plasma) were aliquoted and measured after storage for 24
hours (1 day), 48 hours (2 days), and 72 hours (3 days) at 2–8°C. The aliquot for the
reference value was a fresh measured sample. Measurements were performed with
three-fold determination on a cobas e 601 analyzer. Recovery compared to the
reference value was calculated as either deviation (in ng/mL) or as percent recovery.
Studies demonstrated that Serum Separation Tube, Plasma Separation Tube (LH), Li-
Heparin-, K2-EDTA-, and K3-EDTA Plasma specimens are stable for 48 hours at 2-
8°C.
Sample Stability at 15-25oC:
A study was performed to evaluate Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay’s ability to generate
analogous results when using fresh and stored samples. Ten spiked samples for each
sample type (Serum Separation Tube, Plasma Separation Tube (LH), Li-Heparin-, K2-
EDTA-, and K3-EDTA Plasma) were aliquoted and measured after storage for 4
hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours at 15–25°C. The aliquot for the reference value was a
fresh measured sample.
Measurements were performed with three-fold determination on a cobas e 601

Heparin-, K2-EDTA-, and K3-EDTA Plasma specimens are stable for 24 hours at 15-
25°C.
Sample Stability at -20oC:
A study was performed to evaluate Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay’s ability to generate
analogous results when using fresh and stored samples. Ten spiked samples for each
sample type (Serum Separation Tube, Plasma Separation Tube (LH), Li-Heparin-, K2-
EDTA-, and K3-EDTA Plasma) were aliquoted and measured after storage for two
months, 4 months and 13 months at −20°C. The aliquot for the reference value was
stored at −80°C and measured at the same time point. The aliquot for the reference
value was a fresh measured sample.
Measurements were performed with three-fold determination on a cobas e 601
analyzer. Recovery compared to the reference value was calculated as either deviation
(in ng/mL) or as percent recovery.

Studies demonstrated that serum Separation Tube, Plasma Separation Tube (LH), Li-
Heparin-, K2-EDTA-, and K3-EDTA Plasma specimens are stable for twelve months
at −20°C.
Additional sample stability studies were performed on the MOSES clinical samples in
MAF2386/DEN150009.
Sample Stability (Freeze/Thaw Cycles) Study:
Sample Stability (Freeze/Thaw Cycles) was assessed by comparing the measurement
of fresh sample (reference) aliquots to their respective stressed sample aliquots for
each sample type (Serum Separation Tube, Plasma Separation Tube (LH), Li-Heparin-
, K2-EDTA-, and K3-EDTA Plasma). Ten spiked samples for each sample type were
aliquoted and measured after one freeze/thaw cycles. The aliquot for the reference
value was a fresh measured sample.

analyzer. Recovery compared to the reference value was calculated as either deviation
(in ng/mL) or as percent recovery
Studies demonstrated that Serum Separation Tube, Plasma Separation Tube (LH), Li-
Heparin-, K2-EDTA-, and K3-EDTA Plasma samples are stable for one freeze/thaw
cycle.
l. Matrix Equivalence Study:
SST-Versus-Serum Comparison:
The effect on quantitation of Procalcitonin in the presence of serum-separator gel was
determined by comparing values obtained from human samples drawn into Serum and
SST (Serum Separator Tube) primary tubes from four different tube manufacturers.
For each tube type, ten (10) human serum samples were tested in duplicate on one (1)
Elecsys 2010
analyzer at the following time intervals:
• T (fresh)
0
• T (4 hours at room temperature)
4
• T (4 hours at room temperature, and then 20 hours at 2–8°C)
24
The results show no statistically significant difference between the baseline and 24
hour testing interval in EDTA-plasma and serum tubes, thus supporting the package-
insert claim that
SST is an acceptable sample type for use with the Elecsys PCT assay.
Lithium-Heparin Plasma-Versus-Serum Comparison:
The effect on quantitation of PCT in the presence of lithium-heparin anticoagulant was
21

--- Page 22 ---
determined by comparing values obtained from human samples drawn into Serum and
Li-
Heparin plasma primary tubes. Fifty-three Serum/Li-Heparin plasma pairs were tested
in singlicate with one reagent lot on one cobas e 411 analyzer. Potential effects were
assessed by Passing/Bablok regression analysis.
The results show no statistically significant difference between the Serum/Li-Heparin
samples, thus supporting the package-insert claim that Li-Heparin plasma is an
acceptable sample type for use with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay.
K -EDTA Plasma-Versus-Serum Comparison:
2
The effect on quantitation of PCT in the presence of K2-EDTA anticoagulant was
determined by comparing values obtained from human samples drawn into Serum and
K2-EDTA plasma
primary tubes. Fifty-five Serum/K2-EDTA plasma pairs were tested in singlicate with
one reagent lot on one cobas e 411 analyzer. Potential effects were assessed by
Passing/Bablok regression analysis.
The results show no statistically significant difference between the Serum/K2-EDTA
plasma samples, thus supporting the package-insert claim that Li-Heparin plasma is an
acceptable sample type for use with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay.
K -EDTA Plasma-Versus-Serum Comparison:
3
The effect on quantitation of PCT in the presence of K3-EDTA anticoagulant was
determined by comparing values obtained from human samples drawn into Serum and
K3-EDTA plasma
primary tubes. Fifty-three Serum/K3-EDTA plasma pairs were tested in singlicate with
one reagent lot on one cobas e 411 analyzer. Potential effects were assessed by
Passing/Bablok regression analysis.
The results show no statistically significant difference between the Serum/K3-EDTA
plasma samples, thus supporting the package-insert claim that Li-Heparin plasma is an
acceptable sample type for use with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay.
Serum/Plasma Comparison-Serum Versus PST:
The effect on quantitation of PCT collected in plasma gel separation was determined
by
comparing values obtained from human samples drawn into serum and PST (Plasma
Separation Tube). Fifty-two Serum/PST plasma pairs were tested in singleton with one
reagent lot on one cobas e 411 analyzer. Potential effects were assessed by
Passing/Bablok regression analysis.
The results show no statistically significant difference between the Serum/PST plasma
22

--- Page 23 ---
samples, thus supporting the package-insert claim that Li-Heparin plasma is an
acceptable sample type for use with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay.
2. Clinical Studies:
The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was evaluated for the prediction of cumulative 28-
day all-cause mortality in a prospective clinical trial (MOSES study - Procalcitonin
Monitoring Sepsis Study; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01523717) of 858 adult
patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock admitted to ICU care in which
PCT levels were measured on Days 0, 1, and 4 across 13 investigational sites in the
US. The per protocol analysis population (598 subjects) comprised 44% female and
56% male patients with a mean age of 64 years. About half of the patients had severe
sepsis (51%) versus septic shock (49%). Infections were mainly community acquired
(91%). The mortality rate in the per protocol population (598 subjects) was 16.8% as
compared to the entire study population (858 subjects) where the mortality rate was
22%.Clinical performance data summarized below was determined based on the per
protocol population.
A two-sided Fisher’s Exact Test analysis was performed, using change in PCT (ΔPCT)
(> 80% or ≤ 80%) versus vital status on Day 28. Change in PCT levels was determined
at time 0 (PCT 4.0) and Day 1 (PCT 4.1) which were then compared to PCT values at
Day 4. Stratified results are shown below:

mortality as the clinical reference.
For both analysis populations Kaplan-Meier survival curves show that patients with a positive ΔPCT result (≤ 80 %) had
a clearly lower survival probability from study Day 4 till the end of follow-up time compared to ΔPCT-negative (> 80
%) patients.
The table below presents the data with additional stratification of patients based on
initial PCT level, above 2.0 µg/L less than or equal to 2.0 µg/L at Day 0 or Day 1.

Additional stratification of patients based on absolute initial PCT levels (> or ≤ 2.0
μg/L) at Day 0 (or Day 1) revealed subgroups with particularly reduced or elevated
mortality risk considering their hospital disposition on Day 4. Differences in results
reflect the impact of available number of samples for testing (e.g., insufficient sample
volume). Mortality rates and prognostic performance are given for the following
subgroups in the tables below:
1. Patients with PCT > 2.0 µg/L at Day 0 (or Day 1) receiving ICU care on Day 4
2. Patients with PCT ≤ 2.0 µg/L at Day 0 (or Day 1) receiving ICU care on Day 4
3. Patients with PCT > 2.0 µg/L at Day 0 (or Day 1) without ICU care on Day 4

* Normality approximation of within-imputation variance not valid, therefore the estimate corresponds to within-
imputation variation based on exact confidence intervals [Clopper & Pearson, 1934]
Time-to-event analysis illustrated by the Kaplan-Meier curves below shows that
patients in who remained in the ICU at day 4 with an initial PCT value > 2.0 µg/L had
a lower survival probability (higher cumulative mortality risk) from study Day 4 until
the end of follow-up time (28 days) when the ΔPCT test result was positive compared

The performance of ∆PCT from Day 0 to Day 4 (≤80% vs. >80%) as prognostic for
28-day cumulative risk of mortality was quantified by Cox proportional hazards
regression analysis with a hazard ratio of 2.02 (95% CI: 1.27-3.23; p-value = 0.0031),
i.e., the relative risk of cumulative 28-day mortality was about 2-fold higher if an
individual tested positive for ΔPCT (≤ 80%) than if an individual tested negative
(>80%).

*"Oth er " describes all patients without an identified gram positive, gram negative or fungal microorganism. The
univariate hazard ratio compares the mortality risk of patients classified with "other" as biological infection type to the
mortality of patients infected with gram negative bacteria.
ΔPCT from Day 0 (or Day 1) to Day 4 remains a prognostic parameter for the risk of
cumulative 28-day mortality in patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock
even when the hazard ratio is adjusted for other mortality predictors in Cox multiple
regression models. The relative mortality risk estimates for ΔPCT and selected
predictors are given below with 95% confidence intervals. For continuous predictors,
the hazard ratio (HR) was calculated for one standard deviation (SD) change in the
predictor. For binary predictors, the risk estimate compares the hazards for the two
binary results as shown in the table below:

* The models also included the following predictors (hazard ratio results not shown): Antibiotic Adequacy, Sepsis Severity,
Biological Infection Type, Clinical Infection Type, Positive Blood Culture, PCT on Day 0, Gender. In the analysis, missing
values for predictors were multiple imputed assuming they were Missing at Random (MAR), with the multiple imputations
combined according to Rubin’s rules (Rubin D.B.,Wiley New York 1987; Multiple Imputation for Nonresponse in
Surveys).
The change of PCT over time can also be described by the ratio of PCT values from
Day 4 and Day 0 (or Day 1):
A decline of ΔPCT = 80% translates into a PCT ratio of 0.2. The PCT ratio has values
larger than 0.2 when the ΔPCT decline is below 80% which is associated with a higher
risk for cumulative 28-day all-cause mortality in patients diagnosed with severe sepsis
or septic shock. Likewise, a PCT ratio below 0.2 indicates a lower risk for mortality
within 28 days. On a continuous scale, the relative mortality risk for patients
diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock is higher the larger the PCT ratio (cf.
6.3). The following Table lists the hazard ratios for an increase by the factor 2 in PCT
ratio, i.e. the relative increase in mortality risk for a patient with any given PCT ratio
compared to a patient with a 2-fold lower PCT ratio. For comparison selected
predictors are indicated with corresponding equivalents in standard deviation. For the
patient location at Day 4, the risk estimate compares the hazards for patients with vs.
without ICU care on Day 4.

# A unit change of ∆PCT on log-2-scale corresponded to 0.52 SD of ∆PCT from Day 0 until Day 4 (0.69 SD for ΔPCT
from Day 1 until Day 4). Accordingly, the reported ∆PCT hazard ratios refer to an increase of ∆PCT by a factor of 2. For
comparability hazard ratios of the other continuous predictors were estimated for the same fractional SDs, i.e. 0.52 or
0.69, respectively

In addition to the device, to minimize manual user calculation errors, an on-line ‘Change
in Procalcitonin Calculator’ was developed (www.BRAHMS-PCT-Calculator.com). The
on-line calculator is a simple web-based software application; the requirement
specifications for the Change in Procalcitonin Calculator focus on functional
specifications of the software. The software handles all data on the client-side only (i.e.,
no transfer of any data from user’s local computer). Browsers evaluated included:
Android Browser (on Android) Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0
Chrome 31.0 Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0
Chrome 36.0 Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0

The user inputs the patient location on day 4 (ICU or not ICU) and the absolute PCT
concentrations of a patient obtained on the day severe sepsis or septic shock was first
diagnosed (or 24 hours later) and four days thereafter to determine ΔPCT results. (See
www.brahms-PCT-Calculator.com). Once data input is completed, the user selects
‘calculate’ and a summary cross tab table displays calculation results and mortality risk

A link to the device package labeling is provided within the on-line calculator page. The
user is only able to Print/Download results without transmission of any data away from
the local computer. Usability testing was conducted.
Absolute PCT values on the laboratory report should be reported with a link to the
Change in Procalcitonin Calculator (www.BRAHMS-PCT-Calculator.com) for a guided
interpretation of the test results. In addition the laboratory report should also include the
‘Change in Procalcitonin Result’ (> 80% or ≤ 80%) if Day 0 (or Day 1) and Day 4 values
are available.
2. Specimen Identification:
A barcode reader reads the barcodes on each tube for positive identification.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
See Sample Stability (M.1.k) above.
5. Calibration:
Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument specifically generated
by 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode.
Calibration must be performed once per reagent lot using fresh reagent (i.e. not more than
24 hours since the reagent kit was registered on the analyzer). Renewed calibration is
recommended as follows:
• after 8 weeks when using the same reagent lot
• after 7 days (when using the same reagent kit on the analyzer)
• as required: e.g. quality control findings outside the defined limits
