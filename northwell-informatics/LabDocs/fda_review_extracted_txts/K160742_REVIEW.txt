L. Test Principle:
The NoCoding1 Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System quantitatively measures blood
glucose levels using an amperometric method. A blood sample is drawn into the test strip by
capillary action, and reacts with reagents (glucose oxidase) on the test strip. This reaction
produces an electrical current which is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the
samples. The electrical current is measured by the meter and is displayed to the user as a
corresponding blood glucose concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed repeatability precision studies (within-run precision) using

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed using venous whole blood spiked with glucose. A
total of 9 concentrations ranging from 13 mg/dL to 614 mg/dL were tested using 3
lots of test strips. Results from the regression analysis are as follows:
Lot Slope y-intercept R2
1 0.9794 -1.3703 0.9996

3 0.9916 -2.2810 0.9994
Combined 0.9814 -1.3847 0.9995
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 20
to 600 mg/dL.
The NoCoding1 Plus Blood Glucose Meter displays results between 20-600 mg/dL.
The message ‘HI’ appears when results are greater than 600 mg/dL and the message
‘Lo’ appears when a test result is less than 20 mg/dL. The ‘HI/Lo’ error message
feature was validated during the software validation of the device to demonstrate that
the feature functions as intended.

reference material (NISTa SRM 917b).
Test Strip Stability:
Test Strip stability has been evaluated through accelerated and real-time open vial and
closed vial studies. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The manufacturer claims shelf life stability and open vial stability of 24
months from manufacture when stored at 34- 86°F (1-30˚C) and 20-80% Relative
Humidity. The labeling states not to freeze test strips.
Control Solution Value Assignment and Stability:
The NoCoding 1 Control Solutions were previously cleared as CareSens Control
Solutions under k080923 where the value assignment protocol, the stability protocols
and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. They have been
repackaged and renamed in this submission. The stability studies support a closed-
vial shelf life of 24 months when stored at 46-86°F (8-30°C) and an open-vial shelf
life of 90 days when stored at 46-86°F (8-30°C).
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20 to 600 mg/dL based on linearity studies (see section
M.1.b above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by spiking endogenous and exogenous
substances into venous whole blood. Each potential interferent was tested at 2
glucose levels (80 and 300 mg/dL) using 3 test strip lots and 10 replicates per
lot per interferent. Results of test samples measured on the NoCoding1 Plus
Blood Glucose Meter System were compared to the mean of the control
sample measured by a laboratory reference method (YSI) and the bias
calculated. Significant interference is defined by the sponsor as a bias within ±
10% compared to a control sample. Results are presented in the table below:

--- Page 11 ---
There is no sample identification function with this device. As the blood sample was
collected from the fingertip, the user directly applies the blood sample to the test strip.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
NoCoding1 Plus Blood Glucose System is used for measuring fresh capillary whole
blood samples from the fingertip. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test
strip by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
There is no calibration required by the user for the NoCoding1 Plus blood glucose
meters. The meters are automatically coded.
6. Quality Control:
Two levels of glucose control solutions are available with this system, but are sold
separately. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the
labeling. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the control solutions
vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter and to contact customer support if
the control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit
The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the NoCoding1 Plus
Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using venous whole blood samples
with seven hematocrit levels of 15, 20, 30, 42, 50, 60 and 65% spiked with glucose to
achieve three (3) concentrations at 30-50, 96-144, and 280-420 mg/dL. Each sample was
then tested using 30 NoCoding1 Plus meters and three (3) lots of test strips. The values
obtained on the meter were compared with those obtained using the YSI 2300 analyzer.
The % biases relative to YSI demonstrated acceptable performance across the claimed
hematocrit range of 15-65%.
2. Altitude Testing
An altitude study was conducted inside an altitude test chamber that has capabilities of
controlling both pressure and oxygen variables. Various altitudes (0 feet, 5,000 feet and
10,000 feet) were simulated for testing. Venous blood samples with three glucose
concentrations intervals (60 to 80, 150 to 250, and 350 to 500 mg/dL) were tested using
three lots of NoCoding 1 Plus blood glucose strips and fifteen NoCoding 1 Plus meters.
The results obtained using the NoCoding1 Plus Blood Glucose monitoring system were
compared to results obtained using the YSI analyzer. The results demonstrate acceptable
bias to YSI to support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 10,000 feet (3048
11

--- Page 12 ---
meters) have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements on the NoCoding1
Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
3. Sample volume study:
The sponsor performed a study to support the claimed minimum sample volume for the
NoCoding1 Plus system. Blood samples with three levels of glucose (<75, 80-120, and
>250 mg/dL) were tested at three sample volumes (0.4, 0.5, and 0.6µL) using 3 test strip
lots and 3 meters. The values obtained using the NoCoding1 Plus system were compared
to values obtained using the YSI analyzer. Results support the claimed minimum sample
volume of 0.5 μL.
4. Temperature and Humidity
The sponsor performed operating conditions studies using venous blood samples at three
glucose concentrations (60 to 80, 96 to 144, and 280 to 420 mg/dL) to evaluate
temperatures from 6°C to 44°C and relative humidity (RH) from 10 % to 90 % RH. Nine
temperature and humidity combinations were tested including low temperature/low
humidity, low temperature/medium humidity, low temperature/high humidity, average
temperature/low humidity, average temperature/medium humidity, average
temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low humidity, high temperature/medium
humidity, and high temperature/high humidity. Individual glucose measurements using
the NoCoding1 Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System were compared to the reference
method (YSI) and percent bias were calculated. Results demonstrated that glucose
measurements on the NoCoding1 Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System were not
significantly affected by the tested conditions. The results support the claims in the
labeling that the system can be used in temperature conditions of 42.8-111.2˚F (6°C to
44°C) and relative humidity between 10 to 90%.
4. Infection control studies:
The NoCoding1 Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for single patient
home use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising
the meter by an outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete
inactivation of viral hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Clorox
Germicidal Wipes (EPA Reg. No: 67619-12). Robustness studies were also performed
by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external
materials of the meter after 10,950 cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate
5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the
validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
5. EMC Testing:
The sponsor provided appropriate documentation certifying that electromagnetic (EMC)
testing was performed and the NoCoding1 Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System were
found to be compliant.
12

--- Page 13 ---
6. Usability Study:
A usability study was performed and a questionnaire designed to evaluate the ease of use
of the device and the clarity of the English language labeling was completed by the
subjects. The test subjects varied in gender, age and highest level of education. The
responses to the Instructions for Use Questionnaire met the acceptance criteria, with lay
users demonstrating acceptable levels of comprehension of the labeling. The readability
assessment using a Flesch-Kincaid analysis for the NoCoding1 Plus User Manual, the
NoCoding1 Test Strip Insert and NoCoding1 Control Solution was found to be 8.0.
7. This device was cleared after the FDA issued final guidance documents for prescription
use blood glucose monitoring systems (BGMS) and over-the-counter use blood glucose
monitoring systems (SMBG). However, the recommendations in the guidance
documents were not followed for this device since the submission was received prior to
the finalization of the guidance documents.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
