L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA Centaur AB12 assay is a fully automated, two-step direct immunoassay using
chemiluminescent technology. The assay utilizes an acridinium ester-labeled anti -
transcobalamin antibody as the Lite Reagent. The Solid Phase consists of biotinylated anti -
holotranscobalamin antibody coupled to streptavidin-coated magnetic latex microparticles.
A direct relationship exists between the amount of Active-B12 present in the sample and the
amount of signals detected by the system.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was determined following guidance from CLSI Document EP5-A2. One
Centaur XP instrument and two lots of ADVIA Centaur® AB12 reagents were
used for the precision study. Pooled serum samples (three levels designated sample 1,
sample 4 and sample 5) and internal serum quality controls (QCs, two levels –
designated sample 2 and sample 3) were used to assess the precision across the
ADVIA Centaur AB12 assay range from approximately 16.82 to 123.10 pmol/L.
The five samples were assayed for imprecision assessments in replicates of two
(each replicate from a different sample cup), twice daily, for 20 non-consecutive
days (n=80* observations for each sample per reagent lot). At least 2 hours were
left between assay runs.
*Note: on the second assay on testing day 20 for sample 5 (Lot 1) one sample

replicate was missed in error therefore this day of testing for sample 5 for Lot 1
was excluded from the final analysis (n=78 observations respectively). Results are
summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor conducted a linearity study according to the CLSI EP6-A guideline.
A serum sample with a high holotranscobalamin concentration (greater than 146.00
pmol/L) was selected as the high sample was diluted with a compatible zero-analyte
serum matrix to eleven different concentrations. A total of 11 concentrations were
tested with samples ranging from 0.09 to 162 pmol/L.
Linear regression of the observed vs. expected values produced the following:
Slope (95% CI) Intercept (95% CI) r2
0.98 (0.93 – 1.02) -1.52 (-5.71 – 2.68) 1.00
Based on the results of the linearity study the sponsor claims that the assay is linear
from 5.00 to 146.00 pmol/L.
An additional dilution study was performed to support the sponsor’s claim that results
>146 pmol/L can be automatically diluted X2 by the analyzer. Ten samples with
holotranscobalamin concentrations ranging from approximately 90 to 190 pmol/L
were tested by diluting X2 manually and by the instrument. Results obtained
manually were compared to the results obtained automatically and % differences

Stability
The protocols and acceptance criteria for the stability studies were reviewed and
found to be acceptable. Real-time stability studies were performed to support the
following storage conditions/claims:
ADVIA Centaur Active-B12 Low and high calibrators, Master Curve Material
(MCM), and Quality Controls:
Shelf life when stored at 2 – 8° C: 52 weeks
Opened vial when stored at 2 – 8° C: 14 days
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
was determined following guidance from CLSI document EP17-A2. The LoB is
defined as the highest measurement result that is likely to be observed for a blank
sample. The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration of Active B12 that can be
detected with 95% probability. The LoQ is defined as the lowest concentration of
Active B12 that can be detected at a total CV of 8%.
In order to determine the LoB, LoD and LoQ serum samples were used and low
concentrations were obtained by diluting with a compatible zero-analyte serum
matrix.
• For LoB determinations, five serum samples were spiked into a zero-analyte
serum matrix to give Holotranscobalamin concentrations of <1.20 pmol/L.
Sixty replicates of each sample were run on each of two reagent lots for a total
of 120 measurements.
.
• For LoD determinations, five serum samples were spiked into a zero-analyte
serum matrix give Holotranscobalamin concentrations of approximately 2.00
pmol/L. Sixty replicates of each sample were run on each of two reagent lots
for a total of 120 measurements.
• For LoQ determinations, five serum samples were diluted with a zero-analyte
serum matrix to give Holotranscobalamin concentrations of <6.00 pmol/L.
Forty replicates of each sample were run on each of two reagent lots for a total
of eighty measurements.
As a result of the studies, the sponsor concluded that the ADVIA Centaur Active-
B12 assay has an LoB of 0.74 pmol/L, and LoD of 1.08 pmol/L and an LoQ of 5.00
pmol/L.
The ADVIA Centaur Active-B12 assay has a measuring range from 5.00 to 146.00
pmol/L.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference
An interference study was performed according to the CLSI guideline EP7-A2.
Serum samples with low and high Holotranscobalamin concentrations (30-40 and 60-
80 pmol/L) were spiked with potentially interfering substances at high concentrations
at or exceeding those recommended by EP7-A2. The sponsor’s definition of non-
significant interference is ≤ 10% difference between the test and control samples.
The sponsor evaluated the potential interferents below and claims that the effect on
assay results is insignificant at the concentrations listed:

Cross-reactivity
Cross-reactivity with other B12 binding proteins, apotranscobalamin and haptocorrin
was tested in the presence and absence of Active-B12 according to CLSI EP7-A2
using the ADVIA Centaur Active-B12 assay.
Percent cross-reactivity is calculated as:
% cross-reactivity = (concentration of spiked sample - concentration of unspiked
sample) x 100 / concentration of cross-reactant
The following results were obtained:
Cross-reactant Concentration (pmol/L) % Cross-reactivity
250 0.2
Apotranscobalamin
500 -0.1
2500 -0.4
Haptocorrin
5000 -0.4
In the package insert the manufacturer has stated the following limitations:
• The ADVIA Centaur Active-B12 assay is limited to the detection of active-B12 in
human serum
• The performance of the ADVIA Centaur Active-B12 assay has not been
established with cord blood, neonatal specimens, cadaver specimens, heat-
inactivated specimens, or body fluids other than serum, such as saliva, urine,
amniotic, or pleural fluids.
• The performance of the assay has not been established for populations of
immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients.
• Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with the immunoglobulins
included in the assay components causing interference with in vitro
immunoassays. Samples from patients routinely exposed to animals or animal
serum products can demonstrate this type of interference, which can potentially
cause an anomalous result. Additional information may be required for diagnosis.
• Potential interferences from monoclonal gammopathies were not investigated.
Hook Effect:
The potential for a high-dose hook effect was evaluated. Patient samples having
concentrations up to 1867.80 pmol/L do not demonstrate a hook effect and will be
reported as >146.00 pmol/L.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
One hundred and four (104) human serum samples were measured in singlicate on the
ARCHITECT analyzer using the predicate device (X) and on the ADVIA Centaur XP
analyzer using the candidate device (Y). Ten of the 104 samples were diluted with a
compatible serum matrix in order to achieve concentrations at the lower end of the
measuring range. No spiked samples were used for this study. Sample
concentrations ranged from 5.56 to 142.58 pmol/L were used for the data analysis.
The following Passing Bablok regression statistics with 95% Confidence Intervals
were calculated as follows
Correlation coefficient
Slope (95% CI) Intercept (95% CI)
Pearson (r)
0.97 (0.92 – 1.04) -0.99 (-3.23 – 0.84) 0.95 (0.93 – 0.97)
NOTE: Holotranscobalamin can be reported in units of pg/mL or pmol/L. In the US,
the pg/mL unit is used. The sponsor has included both units of Holotranscobalamin
concentration in their labeling. The following formula may be used to convert
between the units:
Holotranscobalamin (pmol/L) = Holotranscobalamin (pg/mL) ×43
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. Serum is the only acceptable matrix for the assay, and samples may
be collected into a plain plastic serum tube or serum separator tube.
