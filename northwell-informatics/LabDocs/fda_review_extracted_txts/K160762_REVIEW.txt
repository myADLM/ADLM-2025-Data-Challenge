L. Test Principle:
The Diazyme Direct HbA1c Assay (Enzymatic, On-Board Lysis) is an enzymatic assay in
which lysed whole blood samples are subjected to extensive protease digestion with Bacillus
sp protease. This process releases amino acids including glycated valines from the
hemoglobin beta chains. Glycated valines then serve as substrates for specific recombinant
fructosyl valine oxidase (FVO) enzyme. The recombinant FVO specifically cleaves N-
terminal valines and produces hydrogen peroxide. This, in turn, is measured using a
horseradish peroxidase (POD) catalyzed reaction and a suitable chromogen. No separate

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated according to CLSI-06A. The linearity of the Direct HbA1c
Assay (Enzymatic, On-Board Lysis) was verified using two K2-EDTA whole blood
samples, including a normal sample with HbA1c concentration of 3.8% and an
elevated HbA1c level sample with HbA1c concentration at 12.3%. The normal and
high samples were inter-mixed to make a total of 11 samples with concentrations
covering the assay range (3.8, 4.7, 5.5, 6.4, 7.2, 8.1, 8.9, 9.8, 10.6, 11.5 and 12.3%).
The samples were analyzed in replicates of three on the Roche Modular P analyzer. %
recovery was calculated by comparing the mean observed %HbA1c to the expected %
HbA1c. Recovery for all 11 levels ranged from 97-100%. The linear regression is as
follows:
y = 0.9859x – 0.0588, r2 = 0.999
The study supports the sponsors claimed linearity range of 4.0-12.0% HbA1c.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Direct HbA1c Assay (Enzymatic, On-Board Lysis) is certified with the National
Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). The NGSP certification expires
in one year. See NGSP website for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
Test results are reported in the NGSP format. The relationship between HbA1c results
from the NGSP network (%HbA1c) and the IFCC network (mmol/mol) has been
evaluated and a master equation has been developed: NGSP = [0.09148 × IFCC] +
2.152. The IFCC results (mmol/mol) can be obtained by calculation on-board the
analyzer.

Value Assignment:
Controls:
With a reference lot of Diazyme Direct HbA1c Assay (Enzymatic, On-Board Lysis)
reagents and calibrator set, the bi-level control materials are value assigned by testing the
two levels of control materials in replicates of nine using 3 lot of Diazyme Direct HbA1c
reagent to obtain mean values and a range for each level of control. The mean values are
assigned as the target values of the controls. Values are given in NGSP/DCCT value
system. The control mean and range for each of the two control levels are shown below:
Level 1: Mean 6.2% Range: 5.0 to 7.4%
Level 2: Mean 9.5% Range: 7.6-11.4%
Calibration:
The master calibrators are traceable to an NGSP certified reference method.
Stability:
Real-time stability shelf life studies are ongoing. Accelerated (shelf life) and real-time
(reconstituted, on-board) stability protocols were reviewed and considered acceptable to
support the following claims:
Stability claim Reagent Calibrators Controls
Shelf life 18 months at 2-8°C 18 months at 2-8°C 18 months at 2-8°C
Reconstituted N/A 14 days at 2-8°C 14 days at 2-8°C
On-board 4 weeks N/A N/A
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit studies were performed according to the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
Limit of Blank (LoB)
To determine the LoB, 60 replicates of a true blank solution were tested with the
Direct HbA1c Assay (Enzymatic, On-Board Lysis) reagents on the Roche Modular P
analyzer using three lots of reagents. The LoB was defined as the highest mean of the
57th and 58th replicate values.
Limit of Detection (LoD)
To determine the LoD, five low level whole blood samples were tested with the
Direct HbA1c Assay (Enzymatic, On-Board Lysis) reagents on the Roche Modular P

analyzer. 12 replicates of each sample were tested in three runs, with four replicates
per run, and three lots of reagents. The LoD was calculated as follows:
LoD = LoB + (1.645 * SD ).
LoD samples
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
To determine the LoQ, five whole blood samples from a commercial source were
diluted with true blank solution to a target concentration range of 0.5% to 4.0%. The
diluted whole blood samples were tested with three lots of the Direct HbA1c Assay
(Enzymatic, On-Board Lysis) reagents on the Roche Modular P analyzer (n = 120).
LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration at which %CV ≤ 20%.
Results are as follows:
LoB = 0.2%
LoD = 0.5%
LoQ = 0.8%
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous substances:
To determine the level of interference from substances present in whole blood
samples, the Direct HbA1c Assay (Enzymatic, On-Board Lysis) was used to test three
whole blood samples containing low (5.5%), medium (8%), and high (11%) HbA1c
concentrations according to the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. To evaluate interference,
each whole blood sample was spiked with potential endogenous interference
substances and tested in triplicate on the Roche Modular P analyzer. The sponsor
defined non-significant interference as ≤ ±10% bias in recovery for spiked samples
compared to control samples. Results are shown below:

Hemoglobin interference:
Hemoglobin interference testing was performed by evaluating 102 K2-EDTA whole
blood patient samples in which the % HbA1c value was determined by the Tosoh G8
HPLC method and the hemoglobin value was determined by a legally marketed
device (Roche TinaQuant II Hemoglobin reagent). The HbA1c values ranged from
4.6% to 10% and hemoglobin ranged from 8 g/dL to 21 g/dL. The samples were
tested with the Diazyme Direct HbA1c Assay (Enzymatic, On-Board Lysis) and the
% deviation from the expected HPLC value was calculated. The sponsor defined non-
significant interference as ≤ ± 10% difference from the reference method. The results
support the claimed hematocrit range of 8 – 21 g/dL.
Hemoglobin variant interference:
A hemoglobin variant study was performed using 56 whole blood samples (5.0 – 14.
4% HbA1c) containing known levels of hemoglobin variants C, D, E, F and S. The
samples were tested for % HbA1c in singlicate using the Direct HbA1c Assay
(Enzymatic, On-Board Lysis) and results were reported as % difference compared to
results obtained on the reference method (Primus HPLC method, k891235). Non-
significant interference was defined as ≤ ± 10% difference between the candidate and
reference methods.
The testing results indicate that there is no significant interference for Hemoglobin C
(≤ 38.2%), Hemoglobin D (≤ 43.1%), Hemoglobin E (≤ 21.1%), and Hemoglobin S
(≤ 37.3%).
The labeling contains the following limitation statements:
“Hemoglobinopathies may interfere with glycated hemoglobin analysis. Testing
results indicate that there is no significant interference for Hemoglobin C (≤38.2%),
Hemoglobin D (≤43.1%), Hemoglobin E (≤21.1%), and Hemoglobin S (≤37.3%).
“High HbF (> 10%) may result in inaccurate HbA1c values.”
Labile A1c interference:
Three whole blood samples containing 0, 500, and 1000 mg/dL glucose were
incubated for five hours at 37°C to facilitate the formation of labile A1c. The samples
were tested in triplicate using the Direct HbA1c Assay (Enzymatic, On-Board Lysis).
The sponsor defined non-significant interference as ≤ ± 10% difference between
samples containing glucose and the control sample. The results support the sponsor’s

claim that labile HbA1c does not interfere with the Direct HbA1c Assay (Enzymatic,
On-Board Lysis).
Carbamylated hemoglobin interference:
Three whole blood samples containing 0, 150, and 300 mg/dL urea were incubated
for five hours at 37°C to facilitate the formation of carbamylated hemoglobin. The
samples were tested in triplicate using the Direct HbA1c Assay (Enzymatic, On-
Board Lysis). The sponsor defined non-significant interference as ≤ ± 10% difference
between samples containing urea and the control sample. The results support the
sponsor’s claim that carbamylated hemoglobin does not interfere with the Direct
HbA1c Assay (Enzymatic, On-Board Lysis).
Acetylated hemoglobin interference:
Three whole blood samples containing 0, 400, and 800 mg/dL acetylsalicylic acid
were incubated for five hours at 37°C to facilitate the formation of acetylated
hemoglobin. The samples were tested in triplicate using the Direct HbA1c Assay
(Enzymatic, On-Board Lysis). The sponsor defined non-significant interference as ≤
± 10% difference between samples containing acetylsalicylic acid and the control
sample. The results support the sponsor’s claim that acetylated hemoglobin does not
interfere with the Direct HbA1c Assay (Enzymatic, On-Board Lysis).
