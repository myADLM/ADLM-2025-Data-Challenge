H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for Use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
First Sign Drug of Abuse MDMA Cup Test
First Sign Drug of Abuse MDMA Dip Card Test
First Sign Drug of Abuse MDMA Tests are immunoassay tests. The test can detect
MDMA in human urine. The cut-off value is 500 ng/mL. The tests are available in a Cup
format and a Dip Card format.
The tests provide only preliminary test results. If you want to get a confirmed result, you
must use a more specific chemical method. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry is
the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment
should be used when you get any drug of abuse test result. It should be used particularly
when the preliminary result is positive.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. The tests are intended for over-the-counter and for
prescription use.

prescription use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For over-the-counter and prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable. The devices are visually read and single-use.
I. Device Description:
These devices are immunochromatographic assays for MDMA, EDDP and Nortriptyline
Urine Tests use a lateral flow, one step system for the qualitative detection of MDMA,
EDDP and Nortriptyline in human urine. Each assay uses a monoclonal antibody-dye
conjugate against drugs with gold chloride and fixed drug-protein conjugates and antimouse
IgG polyclonal antibody in membranes.
The assays in this submission include a dip card and cup formats. Each assay and format is
available separately.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle:
First Sign Drug of Abuse MDMA Test, First Sign Drug of Abuse EDDP Test and First Sign
Drug of Abuse Nortriptyline Test are immunochromatographic assays. Each assay test is a
lateral flow system for the qualitative detection of MDMA, or EDDP or Nortriptyline in
human urine. During testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. If target
drugs are present in the urine specimen below its cut-off concentration, it will not saturate the
binding sites of its specific antibody (monoclonal mouse antibody) coated on the particles.
The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a
visible colored line will show up in the test line region. The colored line will not form in the
test line region if the target drug level exceeds its cut-off concentration because it will
saturate all the binding sites of the antibody coated on the particles. A band should form in
the control region of the devices regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of -100% cut-off, -
75% cut-off, -50% cut-off, -25% cut-off, at the cut-off, +25% cut-off, +50% cut-off,
+75% cut-off and +100% cut-off. These samples were prepared by spiking drug in
negative urine samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by GC/MS. All
sample aliquots were blinded labeled and randomized. For each concentration, tests
were performed two runs per day for 25 days.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable, these devices are intended for qualitative use only.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability
Real-time and accelerated stability studies were conducted on three lots of each
device. The protocols for the stability studies were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The results of these studies indicated that all devices were found to be
stable at 4-30℃ (39-86oF) for 24 months based on the accelerated stability study at
50℃ and a shelf life study at 30℃. Control materials are not provided with the device.
The labeling provides information on how to obtain control materials.
Transportation Study
A Transportation stability study was conducted on three lots of each device. The
protocols for the transportation stability study were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The results of these studies indicated that all devices were found to be
stable during transport of the device in temperatures between -20 and 40℃.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Compounds sharing structural or conformational similarity with the analytes were
tested for cross-reactivity with the candidate device. The structurally related
compounds that exhibited cross-reactivity with the candidate device were titrated to
determine the percent cross-reactivity. The concentration (ng/mL) of cross-reactant
that gives a response equivalent to the cutoff, and the percent cross-reactivity are
presented in the table below.

Interference Study
Potential interfering substances found in human urine of physiological or pathological
conditions were added to drug-free urine and target drugs. These urine samples were
tested using three batches of each device for all formats.
Compounds that showed no interference at a concentration of 100μg/mL for different
formats (cup, dipcard) are listed below:

Effect of Urine Specific Gravity and Urine pH
To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine pH, urine samples with
1.000 to 1.035 specific gravity or urine samples with pH 4 to 9 were spiked with
target drugs at 25% below and 25% above cut-off levels. These samples were tested
using three batches of each device for all formats. Results were all positive for
samples at and above +25% cut-off and all negative for samples at and below -25%
Cut-Off. There were no differences observed for different formats.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration is described in the precision section, M.1.a. above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison studies for the First Sign Drug of Abuse tests (MDMA, EDDP
and Nortriptyline) were performed in-house with three different laboratory assistants for
each format of the device. Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered
clinical samples for each drug. The samples were blind labeled and compared to GC/MS
results.

Lay User Study
A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 280 lay persons
testing the MDMA devices, 280 lay persons testing the EDDP devices and 280 lay
persons testing the Nortriptyline devices. A total of 140 females and 140 males tested
the MDMA samples, 141 females and 139 males tested EDDP samples, and 141
females and 139 males tested the Nortriptyline samples. They had diverse educational
and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 21 to > 50 years. Urine samples
were prepared at the following concentrations; negative, +/-75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of
the cutoff by spiking drugs into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations
of the samples were confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual
containers and blind-labeled. Each participant was provided with the package insert, 1
blind labeled sample and a device.
Lay-users were also given surveys on the ease of understanding the package insert
instructions. All lay users indicated that the device instructions can be easily
followed. A Flesch-Kincaid reading analysis was performed on each package insert
and the scores revealed a reading Grade Level of 7.
