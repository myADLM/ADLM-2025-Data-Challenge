H. Intended Use/Indications for Use:
1. Intended Use/Indications for Use:
The illumigene Mycoplasma Direct DNA amplification assay, performed on the
illumipro-10™, is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the direct detection of DNA
from Mycoplasma pneumoniae in human throat swabs obtained from patients suspected
of having Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection.
The illumigene Mycoplasma Direct assay utilizes loop-mediated isothermal DNA
amplification (LAMP) technology to detect Mycoplasma pneumoniae by targeting a
segment of the Mycoplasma pneumoniae genome.
Results from the illumigene Mycoplasma Direct DNA amplification assay should be used
in conjunction with clinical presentation, other laboratory findings, and epidemiological
risk factors as an aid in the diagnosis of Mycoplasma infection and should not be used as
the sole basis for treatment or other patient management. Positive results do not rule out
co-infection with other organisms and negative results in persons with respiratory tract
infections may be due to pathogens not detected by this assay. Lower respiratory tract
infections due to M. pneumoniae may not be detected by this assay. If lower respiratory
tract infection due to M. pneumoniae is suspected, additional laboratory testing using
methods other than the illumigene Mycoplasma Direct DNA Amplification Assay may
be necessary.
2. Special conditions for use statement(s):

3. Special instrument requirements:
illumipro-10TM Automated Isothermal Amplification and Detection System from
Meridian Bioscience, Inc.
I. Device Description:
The illumigene Molecular Diagnostic Test System incorporates the illumigene® Mycoplasma
2

--- Page 3 ---
Direct DNA Amplification Assay Test kit, the illumigene Mycoplasma Direct External
Controls kit, and the illumipro-10TM Automated Isothermal Amplification and Detection
System.
The illumigene Mycoplasma Direct assay utilizes loop-mediated isothermal amplification
(LAMP) technology to detect the presence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in human throat swab
specimens. The illumigene Mycoplasma Direct assay is performed using a negative control
(illumigene Sample Preparation Apparatus II/Negative Control III [SMP PREP II]),
illumigene Heat Treatment Tubes, and an illumigene Mycoplasma Test Device. Collected
throat swabs are placed directly into the SMP PREP II that contains assay control buffer. The
specimen/control samples are processed through SMP PREP II and extracted DNA is heat-
treated. Therefore, heat-treatment produces target and control DNA for isothermal
amplification. The heat-treated specimen/control samples are added to the illumigene
Mycoplasma Test Device where DNA amplification occurs.
The illumipro-10TM (Incubator/Reader) incubates each illumigene Mycoplasma Test Device
containing prepared sample and control material to 63°C that facilitates isothermal
amplification of target DNA. When M. pneumoniae is present in the prepared specimen, a
208 base pair region of the M. pneumoniae genome is amplified and magnesium
pyrophosphate is produced as a by-product of the reaction. Magnesium pyrophosphate forms
a precipitate in the reaction mixture.
The illumipro-10TM monitors the absorbance characteristics (visible light transmission) of
each reaction solution at the assay Run Start (Signal ; S) and at the assay Run End
initial i
(Signal , S). The illumipro-10TM calculates the ratio of the Run End absorbance (Signal
final f final
or S) with the Run Start absorbance (Signal , S) and compares the ratio (S:S) to an
f initial i f i
established cut-off value. These ratios are calculated by the illumipro-10TM for both the
TEST and CONTROL chambers of the device.
The illumigene Mycoplasma External Control Kit contains a Positive control reagent for use
in routine quality control testing and is provided separately from the Mycoplasma Direct Kit.
The Sample Preparation Apparatus II/Negative Control III (SMP PREP) reagent is included
with the Mycoplasma Direct Kit. The Sample Preparation Apparatus II contains a buffered
solution with formalin treated E. coli containing Staphylococcus aureus DNA and is
processed as the assay’s internal control. The internal control monitors amplification
inhibition, assay reagent performance and sample processing effectiveness. The Negative
Control III component of SMP PREP functions as an External Negative Control. The
Negative Control aids the user in detection of reagent deterioration, adverse environmental or
test conditions, or variance in operator performance that may lead to test errors.

None
L. Test Principle:
The illumigene Mycoplasma Direct assay uses loop-mediated amplification (LAMP)
technology that employs specially designed loop primers for specific and continuous
isothermal amplification. When the target DNA is present in the specimen, the sequence is
amplified and magnesium pyrophosphate is produced as a by-product. The magnesium
pyrophosphate forms a white precipitate and causes the reaction solution to appear turbid. If
there is a change in sample absorbance between Run End and Run Start due to magnesium
pyrophosphate precipitation, then the target DNA is detected and the sample is considered
positive. When the target DNA is absent, there is no detectable change in sample absorbance
and the sample is considered negative. Sample readouts are determined by comparing the
initial to final absorbance reading ratios to a fixed cut-off value.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable as the illumigene Mycoplasma DNA amplification assay is a
qualitative assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Specimen Stability:
Specimen storage and hold time parameters were evaluated for the illumigene
Mycoplasma Direct DNA amplification assay. Validation studies performed at
Meridian were completed using rayon, polyester, or flocked nylon swabs with Liquid
Amies without charcoal and Liquid Stuart. Samples were prepared using a simulated
throat swab matrix spiked with M. pneumoniae strain M129 at high negative and low
positive concentrations (200 CFU/mL).
Testing was performed in triplicate for each of the following storage conditions: (1)
upper limit of room temperature (31 ± 2°C), (2) refrigerated (2-8°C), or (3) frozen (-
28 to -16°C). Samples stored at room temperature were tested through 49+ hours and
samples stored refrigerated or frozen were tested through 15 days. Results of the
study supported that throat swabs (rayon, polyester, flocked nylon) in the above
mentioned transport media can be held at the following claimed storage conditions:
room temperature for up to 24 hours and refrigeration for up to 14 hours prior to
sample preparation. Frozen storage is not part of the Mycoplasma Direct Package
Insert and was only evaluated to support this mechanism of storage for analytical and
clinical studies.
Extracted Specimen Stability:
Studies were performed to evaluate storage conditions of processed samples prior to
testing with the illumigene Mycoplasma Direct DNA amplification assay. Samples
consisting of rayon, polyester, or flocked nylon swabs with Liquid Amies (without
charcoal) or Liquid Stuart in a simulated negative matrix were spiked with M.
pneumoniae M129. The prepared samples were held at room temperature (31 ± 2°C)
for up to 3 hours and then heat-treated again for 10 minutes preceding testing on the
illumipro-10TM. Results of the study support the claimed stability of heat-treated
samples for up to 3 hours at room temperature (19-29°C). Heat treatment must be re-
performed (95 ± 5°C for 10 ± 2 minutes) if heat-treated samples are stored prior to
illumipro-10TM testing.
Controls:
External Controls: The illumigene Mycoplasma Direct Positive External Control
Reagent includes an External Positive Control and is sold separately from the
illumigene Mycoplasma Direct DNA amplification assay. The External Positive
Control contains non-infectious plasmid DNA with a M. pneumoniae insert that is
8

--- Page 9 ---
stored in a tris-buffered solution with azide. The Negative Control is a component of
the Sample Preparation Apparatus II/Negative Control III reagent that is included in
the illumigene Mycoplasma Direct kit. The Negative External Control contains
formalin-treated E. coli with S. aureus DNA. External Controls are necessary for
routine Quality Control that help the end-user detect reagent deterioration, adverse
environmental or test conditions, or differences in operator performance that result in
test errors. Testing of external controls was performed for all analytical and clinical
studies with no discordant results. It is recommended that external controls are run
with each new lot and new shipment of illumigene Mycoplasma Direct kits. External
control testing should be performed thereafter in accordance with appropriate federal,
state, and local guidelines. Results from the illumigene Mycoplasma Direct kit should
not be reported if external controls do not produce the expected results.
Internal Control: Each test device contains lyophilized amplification reagents and
primers specific to the Internal Control and is housed in the CONTROL chamber.
Internal Control DNA (tris-buffered solution with formalin-treated E. coli containing
a plasmid with a segment of the S. aureus genome) is in the Sample Preparation
Apparatus II (SMP PREP II) reagent and is processed through all steps of the test
procedure. SMP PREP II is a built-in component of the illumigene Mycoplasma
Direct amplification assay. A functioning Internal Control is demonstrated by a valid
assay result from the TEST chamber.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical sensitivity studies were designed to evaluate the analytical limit of
detection (LoD) of the illumigene Mycoplasma Direct DNA amplification assay. The
LoD is the lowest number of colony forming units (CFUs) per test aliquot that can be
distinguished from negative samples with a high degree of probability (95%). M.
pneumoniae strains M129 and FH were used to establish the LoD. These strains were
diluted in a simulated negative throat swab matrix (Liquid Amies with a rayon swab
inoculated with throat gargle screened negative for M. pneumoniae). A minimum of
three dilutions near the expected LoD in 20 individually prepared replicates were
evaluated for each M. pneumoniae strain. Testing was performed using three lots of
reagents and eight illumipro-10™ instruments over multiple days with two different
technicians. External Positive and Negative Controls were tested each day throughout
the study. These studies confirmed that the LoD for the assay was 2350 CFU/mL for
the FH strain and 200 CFU/mL for the M129 strain.
e. Assay Reactivity/Inclusivity:
As the primer and probe sequences for the illumigene Mycoplasma Direct did not
change from the originally cleared assay, a repeat assay reactivity/inclusivity study
was not required. It is expected that both Type I and Type II strains will be detected
with the Direct assay.
See predicate K123423 for original studies.

--- Page 10 ---
f. Analytical Specificity/Cross Reactivity:
A re-evaluation of cross-reactivity with the illumigene Mycoplasma Direct DNA
amplification assay was not performed. However, an interference study for the Direct
assay was completed and demonstrated that the new extraction and DNA processing
step included in the SMP PREP II was sufficient and did not result in interference
with other substances (both biological and chemical) that could be present in clinical
samples. A cross-reactivity study was previously conducted on the predicate device
(illumigene Mycoplasma DNA amplification assay) in submission K123423 for
which primers and probes are identical to the Mycoplasma Direct assay. Therefore,
because the primer/probe sequences remain unchanged from the predicate and the
modified extraction process was successfully clinically evaluated, a cross-reactivity
study on the Direct assay was not required. No cross-reactivity is expected with the
illumigene Mycoplasma Direct assay.
See predicate K123423 for original studies.
g. Interference:
An interference study using 17 potential interfering chemical and biological non-
microbial substances was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of results generated by
the illumigene Mycoplasma Direct DNA amplification assay. Contrived low positive
samples P1 (M129) and P2 (FH) were spiked into a simulated negative matrix (Liquid
Amies media with screened negative throat gargle and a rayon swab) at 300 CFU/mL
and 1762.5 CFU/mL, respectively. Each potential interferent was diluted to specific
concentrations in sterile saline and added to one simulated negative sample (N1) and
two unique contrived low positive samples (P1, P2). Testing included three replicates
for each interferent alone (negative sample) and three replicates for each interferent
mixed with each of the two M. pneumoniae strains (six positive samples per
interferent).

All potentially interfering substances that were evaluated yielded acceptable results
except whole blood at concentrations > 2% v/v. As with the predicate K123423,
phenylephrine HCl (found in nasal decongestants and flu and cold tablets) at
concentrations > 0.595 mg/ml interfered with the Mycoplasma Direct assay and
caused false negative results with M. pneumoniae strain M129. Therefore, this
information is provided in the Mycoplasma Direct assay package insert as limitations.
During the interference study, Robitussin® Cough+Congestion Cough Syrup initially
produced 1/3 invalid results with Positive Sample P2. Repeat testing produced
acceptable results (1/1 positive) and therefore, Robitussin® Cough+Congestion
Cough Syrup is not considered an interferent. This information is relayed in the
package insert.
Assay cut-off:
See predicate K123432 for original studies. Below is a general summary.
There are fixed cut-off values for the illumigene Mycoplasma Direct assay that
allows sample results to be reported. The pre-selected cut-off values for the TEST and
CONTROL chambers of the Mycoplasma Test Device were previously optimized and
validated for K123423. Fixed cut-off values for the CONTROL chamber assess
validity. CONTROL chamber S:S ratios less than 90% are considered valid and
f i
results from the TEST chamber can be reported (POSITIVE, NEGATIVE,
INVALID). CONTROL chamber S:S ratios greater than or equal to 90% are
f i
considered invalid which prevents TEST chamber results from being reported. More
stringent cut-off criteria are applied to the CONTROL chamber reaction in order to
ensure that amplification is not inhibited, reagents are performing as intended, and
sample processing was performed appropriately.
Fixed cut-off values for the TEST chamber are used to report sample results. TEST
chamber S:S ratios less than 82% are reported as ‘POSITIVE’ and TEST chamber
f i
S:S ratios greater than or equal to 82% are reported as ‘NEGATIVE’. Numerical
f i
values for the CONTROL and the TEST chamber results are not displayed for the
user.

a. Clinical Sensitivity and Clinical Specificity:
The illumigene Mycoplasma Direct DNA amplification assay was evaluated in 2015-
2016 by three independent clinical test sites located in the Midwestern, Southern, and
Central regions of the United States. A total of 458 throat swab samples were
collected from male and female patients suspected of having a Mycoplasma
pneumoniae infection. The study included testing of prospectively collected throat
swabs from pediatric, adult, and geriatric patients that were presumed to be
symptomatic with an upper respiratory tract infection caused by M. pneumoniae.
Double throat swabs were collected per patient; one swab was placed in Liquid
Amies transport media and one swab was placed in M4 viral transport media that was
only used for discrepant analysis. These clinical throat swab specimens were
evaluated with the test device to establish performance characteristics.
The performance of the Mycoplasma Direct assay was compared to a reference
molecular in-vitro diagnostic method, the illumigene Mycoplasma DNA
Amplification Assay that was previously cleared by FDA. illumigene Mycoplasma
predicate device testing and discrepant testing was performed at Meridian Bioscience
and not at the clinical study sites.
Two specimens were excluded from performance analysis due to instrument error and
an unacceptable sample type. A total of 456 prospectively collected throat swabs
were eligible for analysis. From this clinical study, the overall prevalence of M.
pneumoniae in the prospective throat swab specimens was 7.5% (34/456). No invalid
results were produced by the Mycoplasma Direct assay; however, the reference
molecular method yielded 28 invalid results. Repeat predicate testing for these 28
samples yielded results that were identical to the test device and presented in the table
below. During clinical evaluation, 11 discordant results were produced. Repeat
testing was performed according to the Clinical Trial Protocols and Clinical Trial
Discrepant Analysis Plan.
The illumigene Mycoplasma Direct assay performance for prospective throat swab
specimens as compared to the reference method (illumigene Mycoplasma) are shown
in the tables below. There were no restrictions on age, gender, medications, or known
pharmaceutical therapies.

Sample type equivalency studies were performed to determine the suitability of two
non-nutritive transport mediums with three swab types for use with the illumigene
Mycoplasma Direct DNA amplification assay. The following transport mediums were
evaluated: Liquid Amies (without charcoal) and Liquid Stuart. The following swab
types were evaluated: rayon, polyester, and flocked nylon.
Simulated negative matrix was prepared by inoculation of Liquid Amies or Liquid
Stuart with screened negative throat gargle and one of the three abovementioned
swabs. Contrived low positive samples were prepared by inoculating simulated
negative matrix with Mycoplasma pneumoniae strain M129 to approximately 300
CFU/mL. All negative and positive samples were tested in triplicate for all possible
combinations of swab and media type. All negative samples yielded expected results.
One contrived positive sample containing a Liquid Stuart/flocked nylon swab
combination yielded a negative result. Testing 20 additional contrived positive
samples in Liquid Stuart media with flocked nylon swabs yielded no discordant
results further demonstrating that media/swab combination can be used with the
Mycoplasma Direct assay.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The overall incidence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in prospectively collected throat swab
specimens in the 2015-2016 clinical study was 7.5% (34/456).
N. Instrument Name
illumipro 10™ Automated Isothermal Amplification and Detection System
O. System ‐Description
1. Modes of Operation:
The following principles of operation enable the illumigene Mycoplasma Direct assay to
detect the presence of M. pneumoniae in throat swab specimens:
A Mycoplasma pneumoniae throat swab is collected from a patient following appropriate
institutional procedures. The swabs are placed in either non-nutritive Liquid Amies (without
charcoal) transport media or Liquid Stuart and delivered to the clinical laboratory for testing.
The collected throat swab is added directly to the Sample Preparation Apparatus II/Negative
Control III reagent that initiates specimen and internal control processing and DNA
extraction. The sample/control mixture is passed through a filter on the SMP PREP II and
14

--- Page 15 ---
into heat-treatment tubes to prepare the DNA for amplification and detection. The heat-
treated sample/control mixture is added to an illumigene Mycoplasma Test Device that
contains the TEST and CONTROL chambers.
The Mycoplasma Test Device containing prepared samples and control reagent is placed in
the illumipro-10™ instrument (incubator/reader). Each test device is heated, facilitating
amplification of target DNA. When M. pneumoniae is present in a throat swab specimen, a
conserved M. pneumoniae DNA sequence is amplified and magnesium pyrophosphate is
generated as a byproduct of the reaction. Magnesium pyrophosphate forms a precipitate in
the reaction mixture causing the solution to become turbid. The illumipro-10™ instrument
detects the change in light transmission through the reaction mixture created by precipitating
magnesium pyrophosphate. The illumipro-10TM calculates the ratio between the initial and
final absorbance values (S:S) and compares this ratio to an established cut-off value. Sample
i f
results are reported as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or INVALID based on a comparison
between the calculated absorbance ratio and the fixed cut-off.
2. Software:
The illumigene Mycoplasma Direct assay utilizes the same software as the previously cleared
predicate device, the illumigene Mycoplasma Assay. Since there have been no changes to the
internal assay cut-off or other software specifications, the original assay file used in the
cleared device is used in the Direct assay. FDA has previously reviewed the applicant’s
Hazard Analysis and software development processes in K123423.
3. Specimen Identification:
Specimens are identified by position in the heat block wells of the illumipro-10 instrument.
Default Sample Identification is based on Block and Well position (e.g., Block A, Well 1).
The user can provide Sample Identification information using the keypad, illumipro-10
barcode scanner, or the optional external keyboard. Sample information is entered by
following instructions displayed on the illumipro-10 screen.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Clinical specimens are prepared using the Sample Preparation Apparatus II/Negative Control
III reagent included with the illumigene Mycoplasma Direct DNA amplification assay.
Incubation, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, and detection are automated using the
illumipro-10™ instrument.
5. Calibration:
Calibration of the illumipro-10™ is not required. However, verification of a properly
functioning OPTICS SYSTEM must be performed monthly for both Block A and B.
Stepwise instructions for Optics System Verification are provided on the illumipro-10
display, utilizing the SERVICE MODE menu. When the illumipro-10 is powered on, the
instrument automatically conducts an internal Power-On Self Test (POST) to ensure that
15

--- Page 16 ---
software and hardware components are performing as expected. A POST Test failure is
signaled by an Error Code that can be addressed following instructions in the illumipro-10
Operator’s Manual.
6. Quality Control:
The illumigene Mycoplasma Direct External Positive Control Kit contains only a positive
control reagent and is not a component of the Mycoplasma Direct test system. The External
Positive Control is processed using the same DNA extraction methodology as the clinical
patient specimens. The illumigene Sample Preparation Apparatus II/Negative Control III
reagent is built into the illumigene Mycoplasma Direct kit and serves as the External
Negative Control. In general, External Controls are intended to aid the user in detection of
reagent deterioration, adverse environmental or test conditions, or variance in operator
performance that may lead to test errors. Therefore, the illumigene Mycoplasma External
Controls are recommended for routine Quality Control. The performance of External Positive
and Negative Controls were validated as part of the clinical study.
Each test device also includes an internal control chamber that houses S. aureus control
DNA. The internal control monitors amplification inhibition, assay reagent performance, and
sample processing effectiveness. If the internal control fails, an invalid result is generated
and no read-out is given for the TEST chamber of the device.
P. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
Q. Conclusion:
1. The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
