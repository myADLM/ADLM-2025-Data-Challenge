non-susceptibility. The test utilizes automated real-time polymerase chain reaction
(PCR).
The Xpert Carba-R Assay is intended as an aid to infection control in the detection of
carbapenem-non-susceptible bacteria that colonize patients in healthcare settings. The
Xpert Carba-R Assay is not intended to guide or monitor treatment for carbapenem-non-
susceptible bacterial infections. A negative Xpert Carba-R Assay result does not preclude
the presence of other resistance mechanisms.
The Xpert Carba R-Assay is for use with the following sample types:
Rectal Swab Specimens
The assay is performed on rectal swab specimens from patients at risk for intestinal
colonization with carbapenem-non-susceptible bacteria. Concomitant cultures are
necessary to recover organisms for epidemiological typing, antimicrobial susceptibility
testing, and for further confirmatory bacterial identification.
Pure Colonies
The assay is performed on carbapenem non-susceptible pure colonies of
Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, when grown
on blood agar or MacConkey agar. For testing pure colonies, the Xpert Carba-R Assay
should be used in conjunction with other laboratory tests including phenotypic
antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as the Intended Use.

sequences from rectal swab specimens and is not for bacterial identification or to report
susceptibility status.
The detection of assay targets by the Xpert Carba-R Assay does not indicate the presence
of viable organisms containing the resistance marker.
The Xpert Carba-R Assay is not a sub-typing tool and does not report variants of the
bla , bla , bla , bla , and bla genes.
KPC NDM VIM OXA-48 IMP
Detection of bla , bla , bla , bla , and/or bla gene sequences does not

indicate the presence of viable organisms with these markers in the specimen.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The Xpert Carba-R Assay uses PCR technology on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems,
which extract, amplify, and detect the target DNA.
I. Device Description:
The Xpert Carba-R Assay is an automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in
vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of the bla , bla , bla , bla , and
KPC NDM VIM OXA-48
bla gene sequences from rectal swab specimens. The Xpert Carba-R Assay is intended as
IMP
an aid for infection control to monitor the spread of carbapenem-non-susceptible organisms
in healthcare settings. The assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert Instrument Systems
(GeneXpert Dx, GeneXpert Infinity-48, GeneXpert Infinity-48s, and GeneXpert Infinity-80
systems). The GeneXpert Instrument Systems utilize single-use, disposable cartridges (Xpert
Carba-R cartridges) containing PCR reagents that allow for automated sample preparation,
amplification, and real-time detection of gene targets in approximately 50 minutes. A Sample
Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) have been incorporated into the
assay design to address key failure modes that could result in a false negative determination.
The GeneXpert Instrument Systems (GeneXpert Dx Systems and the GeneXpert Infinity
Systems) have 1 to 80 randomly accessible modules, depending upon the instrument, that are
each capable of performing separate sample processing and real-time PCR tests. Because the
cartridges are self-contained and specimens never come into contact with working parts of
the instrument modules, cross-contamination between samples is minimized.

The Xpert Carba-R Assay cartridges contain reagents for the detection of bla , bla ,
KPC NDM
bla , bla , and bla gene sequences from rectal swab specimens. Each swab is
VIM OXA-48 IMP
resuspended in 5 ml of Sample Reagent. The sample is vortexed then transferred (1.7 ml) to
the sample chamber of a disposable Xpert Carba-R Assay cartridge. The user initiates a test
from the system-user interface and places the cartridge into the GeneXpert instrument
platform, which performs hands-off real-time, multiplex PCR for the detection of target
sequences.
Results of the assay run are interpreted by the GeneXpert Instrument System software from
measured fluorescent signals and embedded calculation algorithms. The results are
automatically generated at the end of the process in a report that can be viewed and printed.
Basic users can see test results reported as “red” highlighted for DETECTED results and
“green” highlighted for NOT DETECTED results. Additional results that can be reported
include: INVALID, ERROR, and NO RESULT.

Interpretation of Results
The Xpert Carba-R Assay provides test results for the IMP, VIM, NDM, KPC, and OXA-48
target DNA sequences. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control
(PCC) have been designed for the assay as internal controls to enable the GeneXpert
Instrument System to detect specific failure modes related to assay performance. The PCC is
considered to PASS if the fluorescence generated meets the validated acceptance criteria. If
the PCC fails for any of the IMP, VIM, NDM, KPC, and OXA-48 targets, or SPC target, a
probe check error is reported and the test will not continue. The assay also reports if the test
has an INVALID, ERROR or NO RESULT. Under these conditions, the test will need to be
repeated using a new sample, a new cartridge, and/or new reagents. Retest procedures are
described in the Xpert Carba-R package insert. An interpretation table for test results is
shown in Table 1.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the Xpert Carba-R Assay was established in a multi-center
study. An 11-member panel was tested that included: 1) two different organisms for
each of the five resistance genes detected by the Xpert Carba-R Assay and 2) one
negative sample for all five gene targets. Each organism was spiked into a pooled
negative rectal matrix at low positive (~1x LoD) and moderate positive levels (2-3x
LoD). To measure site-to-site reproducibility, the 11-member panel was tested in
replicates of four each day at three (3) sites over a six day testing period with two
operators per site. Three lots of Xpert Carba-R Assay cartridges were used at each
testing site. A total of 1584 samples suspended in rectal matrix were evaluated, where
144 replicates for each of the 11 different panel members were tested. In rectal
matrix, 99.4% (1574/1584) of samples were successful and produced the expected
result on the first attempt. Seven (7) ERROR cases, one (1) INVALID result, and two
(2) NO RESULT outcomes were reported. All ten samples yielded valid results upon
repeat testing. The results of the reproducibility study are summarized in Table 2
below.

aResults with non-zero Ct values out of 144.
At ~1x LoD, the expected target was not detected in some samples (See Table 2 above). The
lowest % total agreement, 86.1% (124/144), was observed with the low positive IMP sample.
All moderate positive samples (2-3x LoD) gave the expected result in rectal matrix. All
negative samples were correctly identified as negative (144/144). A total of 76 control samples
were run with only 1 INVALID reported; all remaining positive and negative controls gave the
expected results. Agreement between sites, operators, and lots was evaluated using Fisher’s
Exact test. The data presented in Table 2 and Table 3 demonstrated an acceptable
reproducibility for the Xpert Carba-R Assay on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems.

External Controls
Commercially-available external controls can also be run in accordance with local,
state, and federal accrediting organizations, as applicable. For each day of the study,
an external negative control and two types of experimental positive controls were
tested. One external positive control consisted of E. coli cells containing a plasmid
with an insert carrying amplicon sequences from all five Xpert Carba-R target analyte
genes (Multivalent External Positive Control). The second external positive control
consisted of individual carbapenemase-producing bacteria, each harboring only one
of the Xpert Carba-R target carbapenemase genes. On each testing day, one negative
control, the five-gene construct positive control, and two of five individual bacterial
controls were tested. Of the 970 external control samples run, 99.2% (962/970) gave a
valid result on the first attempt. Re-testing of the eight indeterminate controls gave
the expected results.

External controls include the following bacteria harboring target genes:
Multivalent External Positive Control—External positive control (inactivated
Escherichia coli carrying plasmid with KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP, and OXA-48
gene sequences)
Individual Positive Controls
• K. pneumoniae KPC (ATCC BAA-1705)
• K. pneumoniae NDM (ATCC BAA-2146)
• K. pneumoniae VIM (NCTC 13439)
• K. pneumoniae OXA-48 (NCTC 13442)
• Escherichia coli IMP (NCTC 13476)
External Negative Control—Inactivated E. coli containing a plasmid with no
resistance gene inserted.
Internal Control (IC) Reaction Analysis
Internal controls enable the system to detect specific failure modes that could
potentially result in an incorrect test result. Each Xpert Carba-R Assay includes a
Sample Processing Control (SPC) and Probe Check Control (PCC) pre-loaded in the
cartridge and provided with the assay.
Sample Processing Control (SPC)
The SPC contains Bacillus globigii that is included in each cartridge to verify
adequate processing of the sample. The SPC verifies that lysis of bacteria has
occurred if the organisms are present and verifies the effectiveness of each sample
preparation step—reaction tube filling, reaction components are present and
functioning, and monitoring for the presence of potential inhibitor(s) in the PCR
assay. Test results are reported as INVALID if the SPC fails to meet the valid
minimum or maximum Ct specification.
Probe Check control (PCC)
The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, real-time PCR tube filling in the cartridge,
probe integrity, and dye stability. The PCC is considered to PASS if the
fluorescence generated meets the validated acceptance criteria. If the PCC fails
for any of the IMP, VIM, NDM, KPC, and OXA-48 targets or SPC target, a probe
check error is reported and the test will not continue. If a probe check error is
reported, the test may be repeated using a new sample, new cartridge, and new
reagents.
Stability Studies
A number of studies were conducted to establish the specimen stability of rectal
swabs with the Xpert Carba-R Assay. These studies were performed to 1) establish
the specimen stability for rectal swabs after specimen collection but prior to transfer
to the Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent and 2) establish the specimen stability of rectal
swabs eluted into Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent.
10

--- Page 11 ---
Stability of Rectal Swabs
In order to support a claim for the period of time that rectal swabs could be held
before transfer to Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent and further processing, a
mixture of five carbapenemase-producing bacteria (at approximately 3x LoD) was
spiked onto negative matrix swabs to create known positive samples. Both
positive and negative matrix swab samples were tested with the Xpert Carba-R
Assay after being stored for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days at 2°C, 8°C, 15°C and 28°C. Four
(4) replicate negative matrix swab samples and 14 replicate positive matrix swab
samples were tested per time point and temperature condition. At the time of
testing, swabs were then added to Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent. Eight replicate
positive and negative matrix swab samples were tested at time t=0.
Under the conditions of this study, positive and negative specimens at all storage
conditions and temperatures tested were correctly identified using the Xpert
Carba-R Assay. The data supports that rectal swabs are stable from the time of
collection prior to transfer to Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent for up to 7 days
when stored at 2°C –28°C before testing with the Xpert Carba-R Assay.
Stability after Rectal Swabs Resuspended in Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent
To establish a claim for the stability of rectal swabs in the Xpert Carba-R Sample
Reagent, pooled negative rectal swab matrix was spiked at approximately 3x LoD
with a mixture of five carbapenemase-producing bacteria that harbored targets of
the Xpert Carba-R Assay. Aliquots of the positive swab matrix (with bacteria) in
Sample Reagent were prepared to create positive samples. Negative samples in
the study consisted of aliquots of negative pooled swab matrix in Xpert Carba-R
Sample Reagent. Positive and negative matrix samples were tested with the Xpert
Carba-R Assay after being stored for 1, 3, 5 and 7 days at 2°C, 8°C, 15°C, and
28°C. Four (4) replicate negative matrix samples and 14 replicate positive matrix
samples were tested per time point and temperature condition. Positive and
negative matrix swab replicates were also tested at time t=0.
Under the conditions of this study, positive and negative samples at all storage
conditions and temperatures tested were correctly reported using the Xpert Carba-
R Assay. The data supports that sample material collected from rectal swabs are
stable in Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent for up to 7 days when stored at 2°C–
28°C prior to testing with the Xpert Carba-R Assay.
The study supports the following product claim specimen storage conditions prior
to testing with the Xpert Carba-R Assay: 1) up to 5 days at 15°C-28°C for rectal
swab specimens in transport tubes before transfer to Xpert Carba-R Sample
Reagent and 2) up to 5 days at 2°C-28°C for rectal swab specimens suspended in
Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent.
d. Detection limit:
A study was conducted to determine the Limit of Detection (LoD) of the Xpert
Carba-R Assay for carbapenemase-producing organisms harboring the bla ,

background matrix. The LoD was defined as the lowest concentration (reported as
cells/swab and cells/ml in Sample Reagent) of sample that can be reproducibly
distinguished from negative samples with 95% confidence. Pre-screened negative
rectal swab background matrix was used to confirm that the Limit of Blank (LoB)
was zero. Two strains harboring each assay target were tested. Point estimates and
two-sided 95% confidence intervals for the analytical LoD (reported as CFU/swab)
were determined using probit regression analysis. The LoD estimate was verified by
preparing two independent dilutions of each bacterial culture to the point estimate
LoD value. Twenty measurements (10 from each dilution) were tested, and the study
was completed using at least two unique lots of Xpert Carba-R Assay reagents.
Of the 2,774 runs in the LoD study to estimate the LoD of various targets in rectal
matrix (excluding the external controls), 32 runs (1.2%) provided indeterminate
GeneXpert results (2 NO RESULT, 9 ERROR, 21 INVALID). All 32 runs were
repeated yielding valid Carba-R results as expected. A total of 195 of 198 external
control runs provided valid GeneXpert results.
All the data was collected with the GeneXpert Dx software version 4.4a on the
GeneXpert Dx GX-IV and GX-XVI instruments and with the Infinity Xpertise
software version 6.1 on the Infinity-80 instrument. Table 4 shows the estimated LoD
results by probit analysis for the test panel.

Under the conditions of this study, 69 of 72 carbapenemase-producing bacterial strains
were detected with the Xpert Carba-R Assay. Three carbapenemase-producing bacterial
strains (IMP-7, IMP-13, and IMP-14) were not detected with the Xpert Carba-R Assay
even at 106 CFU/ml. For a summary of these results, please refer to Table 6 below.

e. Analytical specificity:
The analytical specificity of the Xpert Carba-R Assay was evaluated with a panel of
62 well-characterized carbapenem-susceptible bacteria or bacteria with carbapenem
non-susceptibility due to genes or mechanisms other than the Xpert Carba-R target
genes. Panel members were re-suspended in negative rectal matrix. A set of 31
commensal/enteric microorganisms was also evaluated in the study, as well as human
cells. Bacteria were seeded into negative matrix at >106 CFU/ml in triplicate and
tested with the Xpert Carba-R Assay. Viruses were tested at > 1x105 TCID50/ml or
greater than 2.5 x 107 RNA copies/ml. Human cells were tested at 1x105 cells/ml. For
Analytical Specificity Study panel, please refer to Table 7 and Table 8 below.

aPeptostreptococcus anaerobius was tested at 5 x 105CFU/ml.
Of the 94 potentially cross-reactive organisms and nucleic acids tested, including
organisms exhibiting antibiotic resistance mechanisms other than production of KPC,
NDM, VIM, IMP and OXA-48, none were detected with the Xpert Carba-R Assay.
Of the 286 tests in rectal matrix, four (1.4%) runs were indeterminate (4 INVALID).
All four indeterminate runs were successfully repeated and were reported as NOT
DETECTED for all five targets (KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP and OXA-48) as expected.
All external positive and negative controls were correctly reported as expected.
All the data were collected on the GeneXpert Dx (GX-IV) instrument using the
GeneXpert Dx software version 4.4a.
f. Assay cut-off:
For IMP, VIM, NDM, KPC, and OXA-48 gene targets, the valid cycle threshold (Ct)
range was 3.0 to 38.0. For the SPC, the valid Ct range was set from 3.0 to 40.0. A Ct

included as automatic calculations in the assay definition file (ADF) provided with
the Xpert Carba-R Assay. Assay cut-off values have not changed from those
described in K152614.
g. Interfering substances:
A study was conducted to assess the inhibitory effects of substances potentially
encountered in rectal swab specimens on the performance of the Xpert Carba-R
Assay. Twenty-four substances were evaluated at “worst case scenario”
concentrations. Eight replicate positive samples were tested per substance. Negative
samples consisted of pooled negative rectal swab matrix with/without the interfering
substance (not seeded with carbapenemase-producing organisms). Controls consisted
of positive and negative samples with no interfering substances added. Positive
samples were prepared from a mix of five carbapenemase-producing organisms
harboring KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP and OXA-48 gene sequences seeded into pooled
negative rectal swab matrix to give concentrations that were 3x analytical LoD (Table
9). The list of potentially interfering substances tested is shown in Table 10.

Results showed that assay targets were detected in the presence of 22 of the 24
potentially interfering substances when tested at 0.25% w/v with the Xpert Carba-R
Assay. It was noted that for fecal fat diluted into positive rectal matrix at 0.25% w/v,
the VIM target showed a 2.475 Ct delay compared to the mean Ct of the control;
however, the VIM target was still detected by the assay. In addition, a change in the
Ct value was observed with the rectal swab matrix sample for the OXA target, which
showed a 1.237 Ct delay compared to the mean Ct of the control in the presence of
barium sulfate at 0.1% w/v. Interference with the Xpert Carba-R Assay may be
observed with barium sulfate at > 0.1% w/v, Pepto-Bismol at > 0.01% w/v, and fecal
fat at 0.25% w/v (for VIM) in tests with rectal swab matrix samples. Of the 404 tests
(not including those test concentrations where barium sulfate and Pepto-Bismol by
themselves showed high invalid rates), 2 tests provided indeterminate GeneXpert
results (2 ERROR). Both indeterminate GeneXpert results were successfully repeated.
External controls gave the expected GeneXpert test result. All the data were collected
using the GeneXpert Dx software version 4.4a on the GeneXpert Dx (GX-IV and
GX-XVI) instruments.
Competitive Interference
To evaluate the potential competitive inhibitory effect of multiple carbapenemase-
producing organisms on the performance of the Xpert Carba-R Assay in rectal swab
specimens, a study was performed by testing various combinations of
carbapenemase-producing organisms seeded at high and low concentrations into
natural matrix. High concentrations of organisms corresponded to ~1x106 CFU/ml,
and low concentrations corresponded to 2x LoD. An inhibitory effect was observed
for three out of five targets (IMP, VIM, and OXA-48) when a low concentration of
each target was present in combination with a high concentration of another assay
target. Table 11 reports the number of target replicates that were detected in the
competitive interference study with rectal swab matrix.

aTarget was considered inhibited if 6 or fewer replicates were detected per sample.
For those targets not detected at 2x LoD in > 7/8 replicates (IMP, VIM, OXA-48), an
additional study was performed where the low target concentration was increased to
4x LoD to evaluate the competitive inhibitory effect. No inhibitory effect was
observed for the three targets (IMP, VIM and OXA-48) at 4x LoD in the presence of
high concentrations of other targets for the Xpert Carba-R Assay (Table 12).

h. Carry-over:
The purpose of the carry-over study was to determine the carry-over rate of
contamination in negative samples due to the nucleic acid extraction and amplification
of high positive samples in the GeneXpert cartridge. In this study, a negative sample
was tested in a GeneXpert module immediately following the testing of a high titer
positive sample in the same GeneXpert module. The high positive sample was
composed of inactivated E. coli cells containing a plasmid with all five Xpert Carba-R
target analyte genes (KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP and OXA-48 gene targets) diluted in
Sample Reagent with rectal swab matrix to a concentration of 1 x 106 CFU/ml. The
testing pattern was repeated 25 times on two GeneXpert modules for a total of 102
tests (25 high positive samples and 26 negative samples per module) for the positive
cells in rectal swab matrix. For each day of the study, an external negative control and
two types of external positive controls were tested as described previously. All 52
negative samples reported NOT DETECTED results for all five Xpert Carba-R Assay
targets as expected. All positive samples correctly reported all Xpert Carba-R targets
as DETECTED. There was one invalid result reported, which gave a valid result upon
re-testing. Study results indicated no evidence of sample or amplicon carry-over
contamination in the GeneXpert modules.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
In a multi-center study, performance characteristics of the Xpert Carba-R Assay were
evaluated with rectal swab specimens. The positive percent agreement (PPA) and
negative percent agreement (NPA) of the Xpert Carba-R Assay were evaluated
relative to a Composite Reference Method (consisting of Reference Culture + PCR
and Sequencing of the amplification product). Five geographically diverse sites were
selected (three across the United States and two in Europe), and prospectively paired
rectal swab specimens were collected from subjects who were hospitalized or in a
long-term care facility. In the study, one swab of a pair was used for Xpert Carba-R
Assay testing. Highly soiled rectal swabs were excluded from the study. Contrived
specimens were included in the study due to the expected low prevalence for some
Xpert Carba-R Assay target genes.
For the Reference Culture, the second swab specimen was inoculated into 11 ml
MacConkey enrichment broth containing a 10 µg meropenem disk and incubated
overnight at 35°C. An aliquot of MacConkey broth culture was spread onto a
MacConkey agar plate, and a 10 µg meropenem disk was placed on the plate. After
an overnight incubation at 35°C, the zone of clearing was measured. If growth was
observed within a 28 mm zone (including the meropenem disk), species identification
of the organisms was performed after subculture of colonies to sheep blood agar.
Organism susceptibility status (susceptible, intermediate or resistant) to meropenem,
ertapenem and imipenem was determined using CLSI standard test methods (M07-
A9) and the interpretive criteria found in the FDA drug label and CLSI M100-S24.
Carbapenem non-susceptible organisms were then subcultured to sheep blood agar
(with a meropenem disk placed between the 1st and 2nd streak) and incubated
overnight at 35°C. Three to five well-isolated colonies of the same morphotype, as
described in CLSI M07-A9, were collected and sent for sequencing.
DNA from the carbapenem non-susceptible isolates was purified, quantified, and
amplified using primers specific to all 5 target genes that were validated and amplify
a larger region than the Xpert Carba-R primers. The production of the appropriate
sized amplification products was confirmed on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. If no bands
were shown on the Bioanalyzer for any of the five target genes, the isolate was not
sent for sequence analysis and the Reference Method result was considered negative
for the five target genes. PCR and sequencing was not performed for specimens
24

--- Page 25 ---
where there was no growth in the 28 mm zone, if the results of antimicrobial
susceptibility testing identified a susceptible isolate, or organisms had intrinsic
resistance to all the carbapenems tested (e.g. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia).
A total of 802 prospective rectal swab specimens were initially enrolled in the clinical
study, of which 785 were eligible for inclusion. The ineligible specimens included:
• (14) specimens from subjects with incomplete specimen information
• (1) specimen was too soiled
• (1) specimen was previously enrolled
• (1) specimen from subject not hospitalized or in long-term care facility
An additional 30 specimens were excluded due to:
• (10) shipping delay/testing delay
• (4) invalid GX control or GX indeterminate/invalid
• (16) organisms where there were no zone interpretations listed corresponding
to intermediate or resistant to determine non-susceptibility
Thus, 755 rectal swab specimens remained compliant and were included in the final
analysis for the prospective study. Performance of the Xpert Carba-R Assay was
assessed separately for each type of resistance marker target and compared to
Reference Culture + Sequencing result. With the rectal swab specimens, the study
showed that 98.9% (747/755) of the specimens produced a valid result on the first
run. Four (4) INVALID and Four (4) ERRORS occurred, which upon re-testing
yielded a valid result.
In addition to the prospective study, well-characterized isolates carrying each assay
target were tested in a contrived study. Strains were re-suspended in rectal matrix
before testing with the Xpert Carba-R Assay at 1x, 3x, and 10x LoD concentrations.
The following numbers of unique isolates were evaluated in the study spanning
multiple gram negative species (Table 13 and Table 14):

aPCR yielded no bands for sequencing.
bAn organism was not isolated from reference culture, therefore reference sequencing was not performed.
External controls for the Xpert Carba-R Assay consisted of one negative sample, one
sample positive for all (5) targets of the assay, and five different positive controls
each containing a single target of the assay. The negative control and five-target
positive controls were run on each day that study samples were tested, along with two
of the single-target positive controls (on a rotating basis). Study samples were not run
until correct results were obtained for each of the four controls. External control data

this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Similar to previously cleared system.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specific instructions should be followed for the collection of rectal swab specimens. The
user refers to a Reference Diagram supplied by Cepheid to determine the acceptability of
swab specimens. Any specimens that are highly soiled per the Reference Diagram must
be excluded from the study. Swabs are then placed in the appropriate collection device.
One swab is added to Sample Reagent for Xpert Carba-R Assay testing. An aliquot of
sample (1.7 ml) is then transferred to the sample chamber of the disposable, single-use
fluidic cartridge (Xpert Carba-R cartridge). The user initiates a test from the system user
interface and places the cartridge into the GeneXpert Instrument System. Additional
sample preparation, amplification, and real-time detection are all fully-automated and
completed by the instrument system.
5. Calibration:
The Xpert Check kit is used by the customer or by Cepheid personnel to perform the
calibration check of the instrument. The Xpert Check is not provided with the instrument
since the instrument is originally calibrated by Cepheid. A calibration check is
recommended on an annual basis. In the GeneXpert Operator’s Manual (Calibration
Section), the user is instructed to contact Cepheid Technical Support for information
about calibration.
6. Quality Control:
Quality control is addressed for each separately cleared assay to be run on the instrument.
