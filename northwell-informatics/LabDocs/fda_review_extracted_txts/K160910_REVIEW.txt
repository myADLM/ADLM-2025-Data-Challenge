I. Device Description:
Assay
The Elecsys Syphilis immunoassay is a fully automated, qualitative assay that uses a double
antigen sandwich format for the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies to T. pallidum.
Recombinant T. pallidum antigens labeled with either biotin or a ruthenium complex bind to
T. pallidum-specific IgG or IgM to form a double antigen sandwich complex. The sandwich
complex binds to streptavidin-coated microparticles which can be immobilized magnetically
to the surface of an electrode. Unbound substances are removed during a wash step using
ProCell. A chemiluminescent substrate is then added to the reaction tube. Application of a
2

--- Page 3 ---
voltage to the electrode induces a chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a
photomultiplier.
The presence or absence of anti-TP antibodies in the specimen is determined by comparing
the chemiluminescent signal in the reaction to the cutoff index (COI) determined from an
active calibration. The strength of the signal generated is proportional to the amount of bound
enzyme and thus the amount of anti-T. pallidum antibodies present in the specimen. If the
chemiluminescent signal in the reaction is greater than or equal to the cutoff signal, the
specimen is considered reactive for anti-TP antibodies. If the chemiluminescent signal is
below the cutoff signal, the specimen is considered nonreactive for the anti-TP antibodies.
The results are printed out as follows:
COI ≥ 1.00 Reactive
COI < 1.00 Nonreactive
Interpretation of results:
Reactive Reactive for treponemal antibodies
Nonreactive Nonreactive for treponemal antibodies
Test results are intended to aid in diagnosis only. As with all serological tests for
syphilis, results should always be interpreted in conjunction with additional
treponemal or non-treponemal serologic test results (as appropriate), the patient’s
clinical symptoms, medical history, and other clinical and/or laboratory findings to
produce a diagnosis of syphilis by disease stage.
All initially reactive samples should be retested in duplicate with the Elecsys
Syphilis assay. If cutoff index values < 1.00 are found in both cases, the samples are
considered negative for anti-Treponema pallidum antibodies.
Initially reactive samples with cutoff index values of ≥ 1.00 in either of the retests are
considered repeatedly reactive. Repeatedly reactive samples must be confirmed
according to recommended confirmatory algorithms.
The PreciControl Syphilis 1 and 2 controls and Syphilis Cal1 and Cal2 calibrators are for use
with the Elecsys Syphilis Assay.
Syphilis Cal1 and Cal2 Calibrators

Internal Precision
The precision of the Elecsys Syphilis assay was evaluated in an internal study using six
human serum samples (spiked), the PreciControl 1 and PreciControl 2 controls, and one
lot of reagents. Two replicates of each serum sample and control were tested two times
per day for 21 days. Samples were run in randomized order on the analyzer. Human
serum samples were prepared to create a panel of two negative samples (COI < 1.0), two
low positive samples (COI approximately = 1.0), and two positive samples (COI > 1.0).
The mean COI value, within-run Standard Deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of
variation (%CV) as well as between-run SD and %CV were calculated for each group of
samples and a summary of the results is shown below.

Multi-site Reproducibility
A reproducibility study was conducted following CLSI EP5-A2 at three sites
incorporating a seven member panel consisting of five serum pools: high negative (COI
<1.0; HSP 08 and HSP09), low positive (COI close to 1.0; HSP 06 and HSP 07) and
moderate positive (COI >1.0; HSP 10). The five serum pools and two controls were
assayed for five days, two runs per day, and three replicates per sample. Data from all
three sites were combined to examine the standard deviation and percent coefficient of
variance for repeatability within-run, between run, between-day, between site, and overall
reproducibility. Data are summarized in the tables below.

comparing the COI of the reference samples to the test samples. Acceptance criteria for
recovery were:
· For reference COI ˂ 1.0 deviation ± 0.2 COI
· For reference COI > 1.0 deviation ± 20% COI
Of the eight samples tested for each condition, three samples were prepared just below
the cutoff for reactivity (COI < 1.0), three samples near the cutoff (COI = 1.0) and two
samples were tested above the cutoff (COI > 1.0). All samples were tested in triplicate for
a total of 24 tests per storage condition.
The stability of TP antibodies in various storage matrices was evaluated for:
· Refrigerated stability (at 2 to 8°C) for 21 days
· Room temperature stability (at 15 to 25°C) for 8 days
· Frozen stability (at -15 to -25°C) for 12 months
· Freeze/thaw stability after 5 cycles (a freeze/thaw cycle was defined as frozen at ≤
-10°C for > 12 hours)
All tests met the acceptance criteria for all the anti-coagulants and storage conditions
tested. Roche is claiming the following storage conditions for specimens:
Serum, K -EDTA, K -EDTA, Li-Heparin, CPDA plasma, Sodium-Citrate plasma at:
2 3
· 2 to 8°C for 14 days
· 15 to 25°C for 5 days
· -15 to -25°C for 12 months
· Samples may be frozen and thawed up to 5 times
Reagent Stability
To test reagent stability, a fresh reagent Rack-Pack was placed on the analyzer and
calibrated. Reference values were determined and the kit was removed from the analyzer
and stored at 2 to 8°C for 56 days. On days 28 and 56 the kit was placed on the analyzer,
calibrated and samples were tested again. Eight spiked samples plus a positive and
negative control were tested in duplicate both for the reference point and days 28 and 56.
Of the eight samples tested, three samples were prepared just below the cutoff for
reactivity (COI < 1.0), three samples near the cutoff (COI = 1.0) and two samples were
tested above the cutoff (COI > 1.0). Acceptance criteria for recovery were:
· For reference COI ˂ 1.0 deviation ± 0.2 COI
· For reference COI > 1.0 deviation ± 20% COI
All samples tested met the acceptance criteria. Roche has claimed reagent stability up to
day 56 after opening a reagent Rack-Pack when the pack is kept at 2 to 8°C.

On-board Reagent Stability
The stability of Elecsys Syphilis reagent Rack-Pack left on the instrument was evaluated
on days 0, 1, 8, 15, 22, and 30. Day 0 was used as the reference point to determine COI
deviation. Eleven human serum samples plus two controls were evaluated on each day
using the same reagents kept at 20 °C on-board the instrument. Calibration curves
established for the previous time-point were used for days 8, 15, 22, and 30.
Acceptance criteria for recovery were:
· For reference COI ˂ 1.0 deviation ± 0.2 COI
· For reference COI > 1.0 deviation ± 20% COI
All samples tested met the acceptance criteria. Roche has claimed 28 days in the package
insert for on-board reagent stability.
Shelf Life
The control reagent was measured after 7, 9, 13, 16, and 19 months storage at 2 to 8°C.
Studies were performed with three lots of stored reagents and tested in duplicate for each
lot. Percent recovery was calculated based on the target value of the Control Reagent.
Acceptance criteria for recovery were:
· For reference COI ˂ 1.0 deviation ± 0.2 COI
· For reference COI > 1.0 deviation ± 20% COI
The data demonstrated reagent stability for at least 18 months when stored at 2 to 8°C.
Roche has indicated a 15 month shelf life for the control reagents.
Calibrator Stability
Roche performed a calibration study using spiked human serum samples and fresh
reagent kits on a single analyzer calibrated with a single lot of reagents. Recovery (%
COI) was determined on days 28 and 56 and compared to the results obtained on day 0.
Eight human serum samples plus controls were tested in duplicate. Acceptance criteria
for recovery were:
· For reference COI ˂ 1.0 deviation ± 0.2 COI
· For reference COI > 1.0 deviation ± 20% COI
All samples met the acceptance criteria on days 28 and 56. Roche is claiming a Calibrator
stability of 28 days in the package insert.
On-Board Calibrator Stability
The stability of Elecsys Syphilis calibrator left on the instrument was evaluated on days 0
and 8. Day 0 was used as the reference point to determine COI deviation. Eleven human
9

--- Page 10 ---
serum samples plus two controls were evaluated in duplicate using the same reagents
kept at 20 °C on-board the instrument. The calibration curve established on day 0 was
used for the day 8 testing.
Acceptance criteria for recovery were:
· For reference COI ˂ 1.0 deviation ± 0.2 COI
· For reference COI > 1.0 deviation ± 20% COI
All samples tested met the acceptance criteria. Roche has claimed seven days in the
package insert for on-board calibrator stability.
Hook Effect
The sponsor conducted a study to demonstrate that the Elecsys Syphilis immunoassay
does not produce false non-reactive results when testing samples with high levels of anti-
TP antibody. The study utilized six samples with medium to high levels of TP-antibody
which were diluted with negative (TP-Ab non-reactive) serum. Each of the diluted
samples was tested with the Elecsys Syphilis assay. Total RFU counts were plotted for
each sample as a function of dilution level. Acceptance criterion set by Roche described
the data as acceptable if there were no samples which resulted in a COI less than 3 due to
high antibody concentration. The COI of undiluted serum samples ranged from 276 to
345.
The acceptance criteria were met in all samples tested. Plots of each sample dilution
series supported the conclusion that there was no high dose hook effect. These data
demonstrate that the Elecsys Syphilis assay is not susceptible to interference from
specimens with high levels of anti-syphilis TP.
Carryover
Previous carryover studies performed on the same instrument demonstrated the absence
of carry-over on the cobas e 411 analyzer for other Elecsys assays. In addition, cobas e
411 analyzer utilizes disposable materials to reduce the probability of contamination due
to carryover.

sample pools were prepared with an expected COI value between 0 and 1. Near cut-
10

--- Page 11 ---
off sample pools were prepared such that the expected COI value was between 1.0
and 2.0. Positive sample pools were prepared with an expected COI of greater than
5.0. Each serum pool was spiked with the interferent at varying concentrations up to
the maximum concentrations indicated in the table below. A total of 10 samples (ten
10-fold dilutions) were tested for each serum pool for each potential interferent.
Recovery was calculated for the COI of each sample as the percent of the expected
result (sample with no interferent present). Acceptance criteria for recovery were:

Drug Interference
Potential interference due to the presence of common pharmaceutical compounds was
tested in a drug interference study. Human serum samples were spiked with anti-TP
antibodies at high negative (COI <1.0) or at low positive levels (COI <2.0). These
serum samples were tested in the presence or absence of sixteen commonly used
pharmaceuticals. Absolute COI (for high negative samples) and % COI (for low
positive samples) were compared to the reference COI to determine whether
interference occurred. A list of the drugs and concentrations tested are shown in the
table below. No interference was observed at the levels tested.

Cross-reactivity in Specimens with Medical Conditions not Related to Syphilis
Specimens from individuals diagnosed with other diseases were obtained from
commercial vendors or were sourced from leftover clinical specimens. The presence
of the given analyte (microorganism or antibody) was confirmed with an FDA-
cleared assay. The specimens were tested by the Elecsys Syphilis assay. Positive
samples were also tested by the BioRad Syphilis EIA II Total Antibody Assay. The
results of the specificity study in samples from individuals with other diseases are
shown below.

The nine samples that were reactive with the Elecsys Syphilis assay were confirmed
positive for anti-treponemal antibodies with the BioRad Syphilis EIA II Total Antibody
Assay. The Elecsys Syphilis assay does not appear to cross-react with any of the
analytes tested above.
f. Assay cut-off:
In order to define the cut-off for the Elecsys Syphilis assay, native human serum samples
were measured with a prototype lot of the Elecsys Syphilis assay and a preliminary cut-
off was set. Next, the Elecsys syphilis results from patient samples were compared to the
results from other commercially available assays. The results of the subsequent multi-
center clinical studies conducted in the EU and the US provided final validation for the
cut-off value.
Result classification:
Sample result < 1.0 COI sample is interpreted as “non-reactive”
Sample result ≥ 1.0 COI sample is interpreted as “reactive”

The results of the Elecsys Syphilis assay were compared to a composite comparator
based on an algorithm of results obtained from three commercially available syphilis
assays: (a) a treponemal chemiluminescent immunoassay (Predicate), a non-
treponemal assay (Rapid Plasma Reagin [RPR]), and a second treponemal assay
(Treponema Pallidum Particle Agglutination [TP-PA]). Additional details of how the
final comparator result was determined are provided below in the “Clinical Studies”
section.
b. Matrix comparison:
The effect of anticoagulants in the samples on the performance of the Elecsys
Syphilis Immunoassay was determined by comparing values obtained from native
samples spiked with anti-T. pallidum antibodies (single donors) drawn into the
following vacutainer tube types:
• Serum (plastic)-Used as the reference
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• CPDA
• Dipotassium-EDTA plasma
• Tripotassium-EDTA plasma
• Lithium-Heparin plasma
• Sodium-Citrate
• Dipotassium-EDTA plasma preparation tube (PPT)
A total of 57 serum/plasma pairs were tested for each anti-coagulant tube. The
matrices were spiked with anti-T. pallidum antibodies to produce samples ranging
from below the COI cutoff (COI < 1.0) to high positive (COI > 10). The panel also
included many samples near the cutoff (COI close to 1.0). Recovery of the analyte as
measured by COI or % COI in the presence of different anticoagulants was
determined. Acceptance criteria for recovery were:
· For reference COI ˂ 1.0 deviation ± 0.2 COI
· For reference COI > 1.0 deviation ± 20% COI

3. Clinical Studies:
A multicenter study was conducted from June 2014 to December 2014 (5 sites) and from
August 2015 to November 2015 (4 sites) to evaluate the ability of the Elecsys Syphilis
assay to detect antibodies (IgG and IgM) directed against Treponema pallidum (TP). A
total of 2697 subjects were involved in the clinical study of which 37 did not meet the
inclusion/exclusion criteria. The remaining 2660 specimens were tested in the Elecsys
Syphilis Immunoassay clinical study. There were no samples excluded from the study
after enrollment. The 2660 specimens consisted of 2282 specimens obtained through
routine syphilis testing, 169 pre-selected samples presumed to be positive for antibodies
directed against TP based on previous laboratory testing (including 15 pregnant women
known to be reactive for syphilis antibodies), and 209 specimens from apparently healthy
individuals. An additional 40 specimens from pregnant females negative for T. pallidum
antibodies and spiked with individual high antibody-positive specimens were also tested
in a separate study.
The 2660 specimens analyzed in the Elecsys Syphilis Immunoassay clinical study were
collected at clinical sites in the following locations:
· Miami, Florida: 6.84%
· Spartanburg, North Carolina: 26.28%
· Baltimore, Maryland: 21.95%
· Minneapolis, Minnesota: 0.98%
· Whittier, California: 29.14%
· Miami Beach, Florida: 0.41%
· Tamarac, Florida: 8.20%
· Buenos Aires, Argentina: 5.64%
· Nanikon, Switzerland: 0.56%
The clinical performance of the Elecsys Syphilis assay was evaluated by calculating
positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement of the assay with the final
comparator result based on an algorithm of results from three commercially available
syphilis assays: an FDA-cleared treponemal chemiluminescent immunoassay

(“Predicate”), a non-treponemal assay (Rapid Plasma Reagin [RPR]), and a second
treponemal assay (Treponema Pallidum Particle Agglutination [TPPA]. Because the
clinical diagnosis of syphilis must be supported by two reactive laboratory tests,
consisting of a treponemal assay and a non-treponemal assay, or at least two treponemal
assays, employing an algorithm of three syphilis tests to determine the comparator result
presents information closest to the serological “truth.”
The final comparator result was determined using a two out of three rule (Predicate, RPR,
and TPPA). The table below shows how the final comparator result was interpreted for
the Elecsys Syphilis assay clinical study.

The 2282 prospectively collected specimens in the intended use population, analyzed in
the Elecsys Syphilis assay clinical study consisted of 1524 specimens sent for routine
syphilis testing (60% female, 40% male, 18-79 years old), 301 pregnant females (18–45
years old), and 457 HIV positive individuals (40% female, 60% male, 18–70 years old).
Each of those specimens was analyzed with the Elecsys Syphilis assay and with the three
reference assays.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The specimen processing is automated. The operator only needs to place the primary
sample tube in the instrument sample carrier (disk or rack systems).
5. Calibration:
Assays do not need to be calibrated every time they are run; however, certain variables
make recalibration necessary. Calibration must be performed when a new reagent lot is
used, when documentation accompanying a new version of an existing assay states that
calibration is required, and when the controls are out of range.
