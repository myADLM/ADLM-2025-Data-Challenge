H. Intended Use/ Indications for Use:
1. Intended Use/Indications for Use:
VIDAS® B·R·A·H·M·S PCT™ (PCT) is an automated test for use on the instruments of the
VIDAS® family for the determination of human procalcitonin in human serum or plasma
(lithium heparinate) using the ELFA (Enzyme-Linked Fluorescent Assay) technique.
VIDAS® B·R·A·H·M·S PCT™ (PCT) is intended for use in conjunction with other
laboratory findings and clinical assessments to aid in the risk assessment of critically ill
patients on their first day of ICU admission for progression to severe sepsis and septic
shock.
VIDAS® B·R·A·H·M·S PCT™ (PCT) is also intended for use to determine the change of
PCT level over time as an aid in assessing the cumulative 28-day risk of all-cause mortality
in conjunction with other laboratory findings and clinical assessments for patients diagnosed
with severe sepsis or septic shock in the ICU or when obtained in the emergency department
or other medical wards prior to ICU admission.
Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker associated with the inflammatory response to bacterial
infection that aids in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of
Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission for progression to severe sepsis and septic shock. The
percent change in PCT level over time also aids in the prediction of cumulative 28-day
mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.
PCT levels on the first day of ICU admission above 2.0 ng/mL are associated with a higher
risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock than PCT levels below 0.5 ng/mL.
A PCT level that declines ≤ 80% from the day that severe sepsis or septic shock was
clinically diagnosed (Day 0) to four days after clinical diagnosis (Day 4) is associated with
higher cumulative 28-day risk of all-cause mortality than a decline > 80%.
The combination of the first PCT level (≤ 2.0 ng/mL or > 2.0 ng/mL) at initial diagnosis of
severe sepsis or septic shock with the patient’s clinical course and the change in PCT level
over time until Day 4 provides important additional information about the mortality risk.
The PCT level on Day 1 (the day after severe sepsis or septic shock is first clinically
diagnosed) can be used to calculate the percent change in PCT level at Day 4 if the Day 0
measurement is unavailable.
2. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
Warnings and Precautions:
The VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT assay should not be used as a sole basis for diagnosis for
determining the risk of 28 day all-cause mortality. Changes in PCT should always be
interpreted in the context of the clinical status of the patient and other laboratory results.

--- Page 3 ---
There is no uniformly recognized interpretation of the change in PCT levels for the
prediction of mortality, and overall mortality is strongly dependent on many factors,
including pre-existing patient risk factors and clinical course. The need for continued ICU
care at Day 4 and other covariates (e.g., age, sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA
score) are also significant predictors of 28-day cumulative mortality risk. Validation of the
VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT assay as an aid in predicting mortality was performed in a study
population with an overall 28-day mortality of 22%.

L. Test Principle:
The assay principle combines a one-step immunoassay sandwich method with a final fluorescent
detection (ELFA).
The Solid Phase Receptacle (SPR®) serves as the solid phase as well as the pipetting device. Reagents
for the assay are ready-to-use and pre-dispensed in the sealed reagent strips. All of the assay steps are
performed automatically by the instrument. The sample is transferred into the wells containing anti-
procalcitonin antibodies labeled with alkaline phosphatase (conjugate). The sample/conjugate mixture
is cycled in and out of the SPR® several times. This operation enables the antigen to bind with the
immunoglobulins fixed to the interior wall of the SPR® and the conjugate to form a sandwich.
Unbound compounds are eliminated during washing steps.
Two detection steps are performed successively. During each step, the substrate (4-Methyl-
umbelliferyl phosphate) is cycled in and out of the SPR®. The conjugate enzyme catalyzes the
hydrolysis of this substrate into a fluorescent product (4-Methyl-umbelliferone) the fluorescence of
which is measured at 450 nm. The intensity of the fluorescence is proportional to the concentration of
antigen present in the sample.
At the end of the assay, results are automatically calculated by the instrument in relation to two
calibration curves corresponding to the two detection steps. A fluorescence threshold value determines
the calibration curve to be used for each sample. The results are then printed out.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Reproducibility/Precision:
The precision study of the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT assay was conducted on the VIDAS and
VIDAS 3 instrument by using 2 assay reagent lots over 20 days of testing at the 3 sites. The
performance was compared to the requirements specified in the Product Requirements
Document (PRD). The protocol was based on the CLSI EP5-A3 guideline, “Evaluation of
Precision of Quantitative Measurement Procedures.”
A panel of 9 human samples covering the measuring range were tested in duplicate in 2 runs per
day, over 20 days using three VIDAS and three VIDAS 3 instruments (N=240 values for each
sample) at 3 sites (one instrument per site). Two reagent lots were used: 10 days of tests and 6
calibrations were performed for each lot. Calibrations (cal) were distributed as follows, cal 1:
days 1-2, cal 2: days 3-4, cal 3: day 5, cal 4: days 6-7, cal 5: days 8-9, cal 6: day 10.
Repeatability, between-day precision, within-laboratory precision and reproducibility/total
precision (between-laboratory precision) were estimated for each sample.
The precision study demonstrated %CV repeatability ranging from 1.3% to 9.0% on the VIDAS
and 2.0% to 8.6% on the VIDAS 3; between-day precision ranging from 2.3% to 10.9% on the
VIDAS and 3.0% to 9.2% on the VIDAS 3; reproducibility ranging from 3.8% to 14.6% on the
VIDAS and 4.4% to 12.6% VIDAS 3.

b. Linearity/Assay Reportable Range:
Linearity:
Linearity of the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT was assessed according to CLSI guideline EP6-A,
“Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures.” The linearity was
determined using one (1) VIDAS 3 instrument. Three high concentration human samples (H1,
H2 and H5) were diluted intone low concentration sample pool to generate eleven (H1 and H2)
and thirteen (H5) levels respectively.

Samples were assayed in triplicate within a single run, using one reagent lot. The linearity data
were analyzed with regards to linear, quadratic, and cubic polynomials, according to CLSI EP6-
A. In the first step, a linearity check was performed with a first order (linear) regression, and
then with higher order models (quadratic and cubic).
Linearity was confirmed in the range of 0.05 ng/mL to 200 ng/mL. The measuring-range claim
for the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT assay is 0.02–100 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Reagent Stability: Real-Time Shelf Life
The VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT kit retain the same expiration dating as currently assigned to
the kit (12 months when stored at 2-8°C).
Real time monitoring is performed per internal procedure ref. 001791 “Stability Testing”,
which follow the requirements from standard ISO EN 23640:2011 “In vitro diagnostic medical
devices – Evaluation of stability of in vitro diagnostic reagents”, and consists in testing one
batch per year stored at recommended storage conditions through expiration.
Control (Post-Reconstitution) Stability:
Controls were shown to be stable after reconstitution for 8 hours at 2-8⁰C, or until expiration
date on the kit at – 25 ± 6⁰C. Five freeze/thaw cycles are possible.
Calibrators (Post-Reconstitution) Stability:
Calibrators are stable after reconstitution for 8 hours at 2-8⁰C, or until expiration date on the kit
at – 25 ± 6⁰C. Five freeze/thaw cycles are possible.
Expected Values:
Controls. VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT assay controls contain 2 levels of antigen concentration.
Each vial contains lyophilized recombinant PCT in TRIS NaCl buffer (pH 7.3) and
preservatives.
Calibrators. VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT assay calibrators contain 2 levels of antigen
concentration. Each vial contains lyophilized recombinant PCT in TRIS NaCl buffer (pH 7.3)
and preservatives.
d. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) for the VIDAS and VIDAS 3 instruments was determined according
to CLSI EP17-A2 guideline “Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory
Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline, Second Edition”.
8

--- Page 9 ---
For LoB determination on 2 assay lots, 6 blank samples were each tested in 4 replicates in a
single run per day for 4 days with each lot on one VIDAS and one VIDAS 3 instrument.
For LoD/LoQ determinations on 2 assay lots, 6 low-level samples were each tested in 6
replicates, 2 runs per day, for 5 days, with each lot on one VIDAS and one VIDAS 3
instrument. The LoB, LoD and LoQ determinations for each instrument were based on 912
results, including 192 results from blank samples and 720 results from low-level samples both
assay lots combined. The accuracy goal associated to LoQ was defined as a 20%CV within-
laboratory precision, based upon the precision profile established on low-level samples. The
LoB, LoD, LoQ of the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT assay when tested with the VIDAS
instrument are 0.01 ng/mL, 0.03 ng/mL and 0.05 ng/mL respectively.
The LoB, LoD, LoQ of the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT assay when tested with the VIDAS 3
instrument are 0.007 ng/mL, 0.022 ng/mL and 0.043 ng/mL respectively.
The claimed LoD of the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT assay for all VIDAS family instruments
is as follows:
- LoB = 0.01 ng/mL
- LoD = 0.03 ng/mL
- LoQ = 0.05 ng/mL

i. Diluent Study:
The objective of this study was to recommend a dilution ratio with serum free diluent allowing
the testing with VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT assay of patient samples with volume less than
200µL and unknown PCT concentration. The study was performed according to the CLSI
EP6-A guideline “Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A
Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline”
9

--- Page 10 ---
Six (6) dilutions series composed of nine (9) samples each (the initial undiluted sample + 8
dilutions with the diluent) were tested with each diluent lot. Each dilution series was tested in
triplicate in a random order in the same single run and the results were analyzed using the
polynomial analysis method. Statistically nonlinear series was further evaluated by comparing
deviation from linearity to predefined acceptance criteria. The acceptance criteria are that the
assay is statistically linear (alpha = 0.05) or, if the assay is statistically nonlinear, deviation
from linearity is within ± 12% for sample with PCT concentration from 2 ng/mL to 200
ng/mL, ± 20% for sample with PCT concentration from 0.05 ng/mL to 2 ng/mL and ± 100%
for sample with PCT concentration lower than 0.05 ng/mL.
For the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT assay, the recommended diluent serum free with a dilution
ratio 1:10 has been demonstrated to be appropriate for samples with PCT concentrations inside
the measuring range (0.05 - 200 ng/mL) or above the assay upper limit of quantitation (200
ng/mL), with acceptable deviation from linearity. To support the testing samples with
insufficient volume (i.e., <200 uL) the recommended dilution ratio is 1:4.
j. Method Comparison:
Using human based materials, the objective of this study was to demonstrate equivalency of
the VIDAS 3 to the current VIDAS instrument in terms of Accuracy (method comparison) on
the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT assay. The protocol was based upon the CLSI EP09 guideline
“Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples.”
A total of 69 natural human samples appropriately distributed over the entire measurement
range of the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT assay were tested once with both systems.
The predetermined acceptance criteria was, the estimated difference observed between the
VIDAS and the VIDAS 3 should be +/- 10% at the medical decision level of the assay (0.5
ng/mL & 2 ng/mL) and should have no clinical impact at additional level(s).
The VIDAS testing was conducted as described in the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT product
Instructions For Use (IFU) between the December 15, 2014 and the April 29, 2015.A single
replicate of each sample was randomly tested with one VIDAS 3 (test method) and with one
VIDAS (comparative method) on the same assay batch. Three (3) calibrations were performed
for the VIDAS and VIDAS 3 during the study. Kit control materials were run with each run on
both systems.
Repeat testing was performed for the following situations:
• In the event of invalid control(s): the entire run was repeated according to the same
Methodology.
• In the event of established human error, or if the system does not give any results,
repeat testing was performed.
In both cases, only the valid repeat result was taken into account for the statistical analysis.
The analysis estimate difference at levels of interest, a Weighted Deming regression was
performed between the concentration result observed on VIDAS system and the concentration
10

--- Page 11 ---
result observed on VIDAS 3 system. The 95% CI of the estimated differences was also
calculated. Data analysis were performed on all samples; there were no statistical outliers.
Results were as follows:
The 69 samples covered the range of 0.07 to 175.47 ng/mL and 0.08 to 196.61 ng/mL for the
VIDAS 3 and VIDAS respectively.
A weighted Deming line equation was fit to the data along and presented along with the
observed difference at levels of interest with associated 95% Confidence Interval (CI); study
requirements and result disposition are summarized below:
VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT
Weighted Deming line equation is : VIDAS 3 = 1.0089 VIDAS-0.0130
Correlation coefficient is equal to : r = 0.9946
Sample Level Clinical
Difference 95% CI Disposition
(ng/mL) Requirement
0.5 -1.7% [-6.3% ;2.8% ] 10 % Passed
2 0.2% [ -2.1% ; 2.6% ] 10 % Passed
180* 0.9% [-1.9% ; 3.7% ] No clinical impact Passed
*A result at 181.62 (180 + 0.9%) has no impact on the patient management and on clinical
interpretation based on expected range values for patients admitted to intensive care units.
Moreover, the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT assay should be interpreted as part of a complete
clinical profile and taking into account the patient’s history.
2. Clinical Studies:
The VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT assay performed on VIDAS 3 and VIDAS was evaluated for
the prediction of cumulative 28-day all-cause mortality in a prospective clinical trial (MOSES
study - Procalcitonin Monitoring Sepsis Study; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01523717) of
858 adult patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock admitted to ICU care in which
PCT levels were measured on Days 0, 1, and 4 across 13 investigational sites in the US. The per
protocol analysis population (598 subjects) comprised 44% female and 56% male patients with
a mean age of 64 years. About half of the patients had severe sepsis (51%) versus septic shock
(49%). Infections were mainly community acquired (91%). All patients were admitted into ICU
at some point during their hospital stay, 44% were still located in ICU at Day 4 of the study
(“ICU” group), whereas 56% were at Day 4 already transferred to a location outside of the ICU
(“non-ICU” group). The mortality rate in the per protocol population (598 subjects) was 16.8%
as compared to the entire study population (858 subjects) where the mortality rate was 22%.
Clinical performance data summarized below was determined based on the per protocol
population.
A two-sided Fisher’s Exact Test analysis was performed, using change in PCT (ΔPCT) (> 80%
or ≤ 80%) versus vital status on Day 28. Change in PCT levels was determined at time 0 and
Day 1 which were then compared to PCT values at Day 4.

The table below presents the data with additional stratification of patients based on initial PCT
level, above 2.0 µg/L less than or equal to 2.0 µg/L at Day 0 or Day 1.
Additional stratification of patients based on absolute initial PCT levels (> or ≤ 2.0 μg/L) at
Day 0 (or Day 1) revealed subgroups with particularly reduced or elevated mortality risk
considering their hospital disposition on Day 4. Mortality rates and prognostic performance are
given for the following subgroups in the tables below:
1. Patients with PCT > 2.0 µg/L at Day 0 (or Day 1) receiving ICU care on Day 4
2. Patients with PCT ≤ 2.0 µg/L at Day 0 (or Day 1) receiving ICU care on Day 4
3. Patients with PCT > 2.0 µg/L at Day 0 (or Day 1) without ICU care on Day 4
4. Patients with PCT ≤ 2.0 µg/L at Day 0 (or Day 1) without ICU care on Day 4
Please note, differences in results, relative to the predicate device, reflect the impact of the
number of samples available for testing (e.g., insufficient sample volume).

Time-to-event analysis illustrated by the Kaplan-Meier curves below shows that patients who
remained in the ICU at day 4 with an initial PCT value > 2.0 µg/L had a lower survival
probability (higher cumulative mortality risk) from study Day 4 until the end of follow-up time
(28 days) when the ΔPCT test result was positive compared to when the ΔPCT result was
negative (patient subgroups according to hospital location on Day 4 and initial PCT level).

The performance of ∆PCT from Day 0 to Day 4 (≤80% vs. >80%) as prognostic for 28-day
cumulative risk of mortality was quantified by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.
Hazard ratios of 2.27 and 2.05 were observed for VIDAS 3 and VIDAS respectively: patients
with ΔPCT ≤ 80% have about a 2-fold higher 28-day mortality risk than patients with ΔPCT >
80%.
In the table below, the relative mortality risk (univariate hazard ratios) are shown for binary
ΔPCT, and for other clinical factors evaluated as separate predictors of mortality, for indication.

The binary ΔPCT was shown to have an added-value related to other mortality predictors in the
prognosis of the risk of 28-day mortality in patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic
shock. The relative mortality risk (Hazard ratio) for binary ΔPCT and selected predictors
(Patient location at Day 4, APACHE, max SOFA, Age) reported below were estimated with
95% confidence intervals using Cox multiple regression models adjusted for scores and other
mortality predictors. For continuous predictors, the hazard ratio (HR) was calculated for one
standard deviation (SD) change in the predictor. For binary predictors, the risk estimate
compares the hazards for the two binary results as shown in the table below:

The change of PCT over time can also be described by the ratio of PCT values from Day 4 and
Day 0 (or Day 1):
A decline of ΔPCT = 80% translates into a PCT ratio of 0.2. The PCT ratio has values larger
than 0.2 when the ΔPCT decline is below 80% which is associated with a higher risk for
cumulative 28-day all-cause mortality in patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock.
Likewise, a PCT ratio below 0.2 indicates a lower risk for mortality within 28 days. On a
continuous scale, the relative mortality risk for patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic
shock is higher the larger the PCT ratio (cf. 6.3). The following Table lists the hazard ratios for
an increase by the factor 2 in PCT ratio, i.e. the relative increase in mortality risk for a patient
with any given PCT ratio compared to a patient with a 2-fold lower PCT ratio. For comparison
selected predictors are indicated with corresponding equivalents in standard deviation. For the
patient location at Day 4, the risk estimate compares the hazards for patients with vs. without
ICU care on Day 4.

ΔPCT > 80%
A decrease in the PCT levels of more than 80% defines a negative ΔPCT result
representing a lower risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients diagnosed with severe
sepsis or septic shock.
PCT > 2 μg/L
A PCT level above 2.0 μg/L on the first day of ICU admission is associated with a high risk
for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.
PCT < 0.5 μg/L
A PCT level below 0.5 μg/L on the first day of ICU admission is associated with a low risk for
progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.
Note: A PCT level below 0.5 μg/L does not exclude infection. If the PCT measurement is done
very early after the systemic infection process has started (usually < 6 hours), these values may
still be low.
Various non-infectious conditions are known to induce changes in PCT level. PCT levels
between 0.5 μg/L and 2.0 μg/L should be interpreted in the context of the specific clinical
background and condition(s) of the individual patient. It is recommended to retest PCT as
clinically indicated within 6-24 hours if any concentrations <2 μg/L are obtained.
4. Expected Values/Reference Range:
A study was performed using the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT test on serum samples from
apparently healthy male (N=98) and female (N=102) subjects. The normal values corresponding to
the 95th and 99th percentiles were respectively found at < 0.05 ng/mL and 0.09 ng/mL.

2. Software
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line
of product types:
Yes ____X ___ or No ________
In addition to the device, to minimize manual user calculation errors, an on-line ‘Change in
Procalcitonin Calculator’ was developed (www.BRAHMS-PCT-Calculator.com). The on-line
calculator is a simple web-based software application; the requirement specifications for the
Change in Procalcitonin Calculator focus on functional specifications of the software. The
software handles all data on the client-side only (i.e., no transfer of any data from user’s local
computer). Browsers evaluated included:
Android Browser (on Android) Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0
Chrome 31.0 Microsoft Internet Explorer 8.0
Chrome 36.0 Microsoft Internet Explorer 9.0
Chrome 44.0 Microsoft Internet Explorer 11.0
Chrome 45.0 Safari 8.0
Firefox 40 Safari (on iOS)

The user inputs the patient location on day 4 (ICU or not ICU) and the absolute PCT
concentrations of a patient obtained on the day severe sepsis or septic shock was first
diagnosed (or 24 hours later) and four days thereafter to determine ΔPCT results. (See
www.BRAHMS-PCT-Calculator.com). Once data input is completed, the user selects
‘calculate’ and a summary cross tab table displays calculation results and mortality risk
prognosis classification as determined by the clinical trial. If incorrect information is
entered, corresponding error messages are displayed. These include:
• If no value is entered, ‘Required field.’ will appear.
• If no numeric value is entered, ‘Values must be between 0.02 and 5000.’ will
appear
• If date of collection is incorrect, ‘Range between Day 0 and Day 4 is too long.’
will appear
A link to the device package labeling is provided within the on-line calculator page. The
user is only able to Print/Download results without transmission of any data away from
the local computer. Usability testing was conducted.
Absolute PCT values on the laboratory report should be reported with a link to the
Change in Procalcitonin Calculator (www.BRAHMS-PCT-Calculator.com) for a guided
interpretation of the test results. In addition the laboratory report should also include the
‘Change in Procalcitonin Result’ (> 80% or ≤ 80%) if Day 0 (or Day 1) and Day 4 values
are available.
3. Specimen Identification:
Specimens are identified by unique bar codes.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimen type and collection
Human serum or plasma (lithium heparinate).
Since EDTA causes a decrease in the values measured, plasma collected in EDTA tube
should not be used. For a given patient, the PCT assays must be performed on the same
type of sample tube.
Sample preparation
Dry tubes: wait for samples to coagulate and centrifuge according to the tube
21

--- Page 22 ---
manufacturer’s recommendations to eliminate fibrin.
Other tubes: follow the tube manufacturer’s recommendations for use.
Frozen-stored samples: after thawing, all these samples must be clarified by centrifuging.
Note: Blood sampling tube results may vary from one manufacturer to another depending
on the materials and additives use.
It is the responsibility of each laboratory to validate the type of sample tube used and to
follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for use.
Sample preparation
Follow the tube manufacturer’s recommendations for use.
The pre-analytical step, including the preparation of blood samples, is an essential first
step when performing laboratory testing and should be in accordance with Good
Laboratory Practice.
For serum specimens, ensure that complete clot formation has taken place prior to
centrifugation. Some specimens, especially those from patients receiving anticoagulant or
thrombolytic therapy, may exhibit increased clotting times.
Samples containing suspended fibrin particles or erythrocyte stroma should be
centrifuged before testing. The presence of fibrin, red blood cells, or suspended particles
can lead to erroneous results.
Sample stability
The sera or plasma separated from the clot can be stored at 2-8°C in stoppered tubes for
up to 48 hours; if longer storage is required, freeze at -25 ± 6°C. Six-month storage of
frozen samples does not affect the quality of results. Three freeze/thaw cycles were
validated.
Special case for sample volumes between 50 µL and 200 µL
Sample volumes between 50 µL and 200 µL can be tested after performing a manual
dilution up to 1/4 (1 volume of test sample + 3 volumes of PCT negative sample or
Serum Free reagent no more than two hours after dilution. Dilution of sample would be
required if the sample volume is less than 200 µL or if the PCT concentration of the
sample is above 200 ng/mL.
Sample-related interferences
It is recommended not to use samples that are hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric and, if
possible, to collect a new sample when these conditions are known to be present.

5. Calibration:
Calibration, using the two calibrators provided in the kit, must be performed each time a
new lot of reagents is opened, after the master lot data (MLE) has been entered, and then
every 28 days. This operation provides instrument-specific calibration curves and
compensates for possible minor variations in assay signal throughout the shelf-life of the
kit.
The calibrators, identified by S1 and S2, must be tested in duplicate (see VIDAS
Operator’s Manual) in the same run. The calibration values must be within the set RFV
("Relative Fluorescence Value"). If this is not the case, recalibrate using S1 and S2.
6. Quality Control:
See “Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (controls, calibrators, or methods)” Section
(M.1.c) above.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
See K071146
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809 and
the specials controls for this device type.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
