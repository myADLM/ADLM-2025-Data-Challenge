L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 assay is a two-step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin
microparticles and an electrochemiluminescence detection system. Cytokeratin 19
fragments in the sample react with labeled antibodies to form a sandwich complex. This
complex binds to streptavidin coated magnetic microparticles, which are magnetically
captured onto an electrode. Application of voltage to the electrode induces
chemiluminescence which is measured by a photomultiplier tube. Results are
determined via a calibration curve which is instrument-specific, generated by 2-point
calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance: All results presented below were within the Manufacturer’s
pre-determined acceptance criteria for each study.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision: Precision of the Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 assay was evaluated according
to CLSI guideline EP05-A3. A seven-member panel consisting of five pooled
serum samples and two controls (PreciControl TM Level 1 and 2) were
measured. Each sample was tested in single determinations in four separate

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity: Linearity was evaluated according to CLSI guideline EP6-A on the
cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzer. Three serum samples containing high levels
of CYFRA 21-1 were mixed with analyte striped serum to make three dilution
series to cover the measuring range of the assay. Each dilution series contained
at least 11 dilution samples and each sample was tested with one reagent lot.
The results are summarized as follows:
Test Range Slope Intercept R2
(ng/mL) (95% CI) (95% CI)
1 0.27–133.00 1.00 (0.99–1.02) -0.13 (-0.31–0.05) 1.00
2 0.45–116.00 1.00 (0.99–1.02) -0.11 (-0.27–0.05) 1.00
3 0.65–127.00 1.00 (0.99–1.02) -0.11 (-0.29–0.08) 1.00
The results support the linearity of the claimed measuring range (0.5–100
ng/mL) for Elecsys CYFRA 21-1
Dilution: A dilution study for the CYFRA 21-1 assay was performed on the
cobas e 411 using five human samples spiked to analyte concentrations above
the measuring range and diluted automatically on the instrument with the Elecsys
Diluent Universal at a 1:5 dilution. The same set of samples prepared manually
was used as reference. The % recovery values from individual results obtained
with the instrument dilution compared to results obtained with the manual
dilution were between 93.3% and 101.9%.
High dose hook effect: The high dose hook effect of the CYFRA 21-1 assay was
assessed on the cobas e 411 analyzer. Two high positive samples were spiked to
analyte concentration to 2470 ng/mL. Each sample was diluted to make five
dilutions samples which had analyte concentrations above the upper limit of the
measuring range. Each dilution sample was tested by single determination. The
results showed no hook effect up to 2470 ng/mL.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: There is no recognized reference standard for CYFRA 21-1. The
Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 has been standardized against the Enzymun test CYFRA
21-1 method.
Value assignment:
For each lot of Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 CalSet manufactured, the value assignment
was performed by testing each calibrator in duplicate on at least three cobas e
411 analyzers and at least three Modular Analytics E170 analyzers/cobas e
601/cobas e 601 analyzers using three CYFRA 21-1 reagent lots. The test value
was determined based on the master calibrator curve generated from five master
calibrators (0.1, 2.08, 4.27, 8.93, 41.78 and 205 ng/mL). The assigned value of
each calibrator is the median value obtained over at least six determinations on at
least three analyzers.
For each lot of PreciControl Tumor Marker manufactured, the values are
assigned using the cobas e 411 Immunoassay Analyzer. The value assigned was
performed by testing each PreciControl in duplicate on six to eight analyzers.
The concentration of each control is determined using the corresponding
calibration curve. The assigned value of each PreciControl is the median value
obtained.
Stability:
Sample stability: Sample stability was evaluated for the following storage
conditions: 15–25°C for five days, 2–8°C for 14 days, −20°C for 12 weeks,
stored at −80°C with freeze/thaw cycles. Four samples from each sample type
(Serum, K -EDTA plasma, K -EDTA plasma, Li-heparin plasma) were aliquoted
2 3
and tested directly after collection (as reference value) and after each tested
storage condition. The recovery was calculated as percent of the reference value.
In addition, the sample stability was evaluated at −80°C by testing ten samples
from each sample type. The resulting data support the claim that serum, Li-
heparin, K -EDTA and K -EDTA plasma specimens are stable at the following
2 3
conditions: five days at 15–25°C, 14 days at 2–8°C, 12 weeks at −20°C, and
three years at −80°C with one freeze/thaw cycle.
Elecsys CYFRA 21-2 assay kit stability:
Closed-vial stability: The real-time stability was performed on the cobas e 411
analyzer. Three reagent kits were stored at 2–8°C. The stored assay reagents
were tested using two PreciControls (Level 1 and Level 2) at Day 0 and at
specified intervals over the shelf-life of the device up to the planned shelf-life
plus one month. The real-time stability study data support that the Elecsys
CYFRA 21-1 reagent kits have a shelf-life up to 21 months when stored at 2–
9

--- Page 10 ---
8°C.
Open-vial stability: The reagent stability after first opening was determined on
one cobas e 411 analyzer by testing five serum samples. Three reagent kits
were opened on Day 0, one kit was placed on the analyzer, calibrated and
reference values for the testing samples were determined. The other two kits
were stored at 2–8°C. At Day 50 and Day 92, one of the stored kits was placed
on the analyzer, calibrated, and the test samples were measured. The results
were compared to the reference values at Day 0. The results support that the
Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 reagent kits are stable for up to 12 weeks when stored at
2–8°C after first opening.
Open-vial/On-board stability: Reagent on-board stability and calibration
stability were evaluated on one cobas e 411 analyzers by testing four serum
samples. A fresh kit was placed on the analyzer, calibrated and reference values
for the samples were determined. After measurement, the kit was closed and
kept at 20°C ± 3°C for 64 days to simulate on-board conditions. Measurements
were repeated at Day 36, Day 50, and Day 64. The recovery was compared to
the reference values from Day 0. The results support that Elecsys CYFRA 21-1
kit can be stored on-board on the analyzer for up to eight weeks.
Calibration stability:
Lot calibration stability: The study was performed to determine the stability of
the calibration curve made with the same lot. In this study, three kits from the
same lot were used. On Day 0, the first reagent kit was opened and used to
generate the calibration curve on one cobas e 411. Five serum samples were
tested. On Day 36 and Day 64, the same samples were measured with a newly-
opened kit using the calibration generated by the first kit on Day 0. The %
recovery was calculated and the results support that the lot calibration stability is
up to 8 weeks.
On-board calibration stability: To determine on-board calibration stability, one
reagent kit was opened and calibration was generated on Day 0. Four serum
samples were measured on Day 0. On Day 8, the same samples were retested
using the calibration from Day 0 and a new opened reagent kept at on-board
condition. Recovery was calculated and the data support the on-board
calibration stability up to seven days on cobas e 411.
Elecys CYFRA 21-1 CalSet Stability:
Stability after reconstitution: The test material was reconstituted and stored in
the closed vials at 2–8°C or −15 to −25°C. The reference material was a freshly
reconstituted CalSet. The recovery of test material was calculated as percentage
of the reference value. The data support the following stability claim for the
reconstituted Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 CalSet: seven days at 2–8°C, eight weeks at
10

--- Page 11 ---
−15 to −25°C.
Open vial/On-board stability: The test material was reconstituted and stored in
the closed vials at 20–25°C (on-board conditions). The reference material was a
freshly reconstituted CalSet. The recovery of test material was calculated as
percentage of the reference value. The data support that the Elecsys CYFRA 21-
1 CalSet is stable up to five hours at 20–25°C.
Closed vial stability: Real-time stability was tested using three production lots
of the Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 CalSet. The test materials were stored at 2–8°C and
tested at Day 0 and at specified intervals over the shelf-life of the device up to
the planned shelf life plus one month. The recovery was calculated compared to
the reference value at Day 0. The data support that the Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 is
stable up to 29 months stored at 2–8°C.
Transportation (stress) stability: The test material was reconstituted and stored
in closed vials at 35°C. The reference material was a freshly reconstituted
CalSet. The recovery of test material was calculated as percentage of the
reference value. The data support that the Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 CalSet is stable
up to one week when kept at 35°C.
Elecsys PreciControl Tumor Marker Stability
Stability after reconstitution: The test material was reconstituted and stored in
closed vials at 2–8°C or −15 to −25°C. The recovery of test material was
calculated as the percentage of the assigned value. The data support the
following stability claim for the reconstituted Elecsys PreciControl Tumer
Markers: 14 days at 2–8°C, four weeks at −15 to −25°C.
Open vial/On-board stability: The test material was reconstituted and stored in
the closed vials under 20–25°C (on-board conditions). The recovery of test
material was calculated as percentage of the assigned value. The data support
that the PreciControl Tumor Marker is stable up to five hours at 20–25°C.
Closed vial stability: Real-time stability was tested using three lots of the
PreciControl Tumor Marker. The test materials were stored at 2–8°C and tested
at Day 0 and at specified intervals over the shelf-life of the device up to the
planned shelf life plus one month. The recovery was calculated as percent
recovery compared to the reference value. The data support that the PreciControl
Tumor Marker is stable up to 24 months stored at 2–8°C.
d. Detection limit: The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of
Quantitation (LoQ) was determined according to CLSI EP17-A2.
LoB: One analyte-free serum sample was tested in 10 replicates per run, two
runs per day for three days with three reagent lots on one cobas e 411 analyzer.
11

--- Page 12 ---
For each lot, the LoB was determined as the 95th percentile of the measurement
of blank samples based on a total of 60 measurements and found to be 0.09, 0.07
and 0.09 ng/mL for three lots. The claimed LoB is 0.15 ng/mL.
LoD: Five serum samples with low analyte concentration were tested. Each
sample was run in two replicates per run, two runs per day for three days with
three reagent lots on one cobas e 411 analyzer. For each lot, the LoD value was
calculated based on the LoB + 1.645 x SD of the replicates for the samples and
found to be 0.18, 0.13 and 0.15 ng/mL for three lots. The claimed LoD is 0.3
ng/mL.
LoQ: Eight serum samples with low analyte concentration were tested in five
replicates per run, one run per day for five days with three reagent lots on one
cobas e 411 analyzer. For each lot, the LoQ is defined as the mean value of the
sample which fulfills the specification for the intermediate precision (<16.6%
CV) and was determined to be 0.29, 0.21 and 0.21 ng/mL for three lots. The
results support the specification of LoQ: ≤ 20% CV at 0.5 ng/mL. The claimed
LoQ is 0.5 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
i) Endogenous Substance Interference:
The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of endogenous
interfering substances using the Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 assay was evaluated
on the cobas e 411 analyzer using three serum samples with concentrations at
3 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL, and 91 ng/mL spiked with varying levels of interferent.
The % recovery for each sample was calculated by comparing to the
reference sample (without spiking the interference substance). No
interference was noted for samples containing hemoglobin up to 1,500
mg/dL, biotin up to 50 ng/mL, lipemia up to 1,500 mg/dL, bilirubin (a
mixture of 10% conjugated and 90% unconjugated) up to 66 mg/dL,
rheumatoid factors up to 1,500 IU/mL, and human serum albumin up to 7
g/dL.
ii) Human Anti-Mouse Antibody (HAMA) Interference:
The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of human anti-mouse
antibodies (HAMA) using the Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 assay was assessed on
the cobas e 411 analyzer. Two serum samples with analyte concentrations of
3.2 ng/mL and 96.3 ng/mL were tested by spiking with HAMA serum and
preparing a dilution series each containing 11 different levels of HAMA
interferent. The control samples were spiked analogously with a serum
without interferent. The data support that no significant effect on the
performance of the Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 assay with HAMA up to 805 µg/L.
12

iii) Exogenous Substance Interference:
The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of drugs using the
Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 assay was evaluated on the cobas e 411 analyzer using
two serum samples with concentration at 3.0 ng/mL and 95.0 ng/mL spiked
with interferent. A total of 31pharmaceutical compounds including 16
common drugs and 15 additional cancer drugs were tested for the potential
interference of the assay. No significant interference was found for each
compound and drug at the concentration listed below.

from three commercial vendors. A total of 121 out of 153 tested samples had the
results within the range of 0.5–100 ng/mL and were used for the analysis.
Because the measuring range for the predicate CYFRA 21-1 EIA is 0.5–50
ng/mL, the samples above 50 ng/mL were diluted according to the instruction for
use, and the value of the samples were calculated by actual reading x Dilution
Factor. Deming regression analysis was performed to evaluate the analytical
equivalence of the Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 to the predicate. The results are
summarized as follows:
N Range Slope (95% CI) Intercept (95% CI) R2

121 0.56–96.39 0.91 (0.86–0.96) -1.40 (-2.86–0.06) 0.96
b. Matrix comparison:
The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of anticoagulants with the
Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 assay was determined by comparing values obtained from
samples drawn into serum, Li-heparin Plasma, K2- and K3-EDTA plasma
primary tubes. At least 44 serum/plasma pairs per sample type were tested on
one cobas e 411 analyzer. Passing/Bablok regression analyses of the plasma

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and specificity
The effectiveness of the CYFRA 21-1 assay as an aid in monitoring of disease
status in lung cancer subjects was determined from a retrospective clinical study
by assessing the changes of CYFRA 21-1 levels in serial serum samples from
subjects diagnosed with lung cancer compared to the changes in their disease
status.
In this study, subject draws were performed at various stages of disease,
including pre-treatment, during treatment, or standard of care follow-up.
Subjects that had samples drawn at any of these time points with corresponding
clinical data were included. The sample inclusion and exclusion criteria are as

follows:
Inclusion criteria:
· Eighteen years of age or older
· Diagnosed with lung cancer;
· Minimum of 3 serial draws available
· Appropriate clinical data
· Minimum 0.4 mL volume of serum available
· Normal appearance of sample
Exclusion criteria:
· No diagnosis of lung cancer
· Less than 3 serial draws available
· Insufficient sample volume
· Multiple freeze-thaw cycles
· Icteric lipemic, hemolytic substantial particulates
The clinical data collected for each subject included the following: subject ID,
date of birth, the date of blood draw, gender, race/ethnicity, smoking status,
including smoking history and date of smoking cessation, date of lung cancer
diagnosis, histology, grade, and stage. For each subject sample draw, the
following information was collected: chemotherapeutic treatment information
(onset date, end date, regimen), imaging information (date, type, findings,
disease status), physical exam date and findings, sample draw date, procedure
information (type, date and findings), clinical disease status, date of recurrence,
and date of death (if subject expired).
A total of 421 samples from 86 subjects were obtained and tested for CYFRA
21-1 levels. For data analysis, three subjects (with nine samples) and additional
14 samples from seven subjects were excluded for reasons including: (i) the
subject had undergone monitoring for only two weeks, (ii) samples which were
serially collected less than 7 days apart from the same subject, (iii) duplicate
samples, or (iv) results outside the measuring range. Therefore, a total of 398
samples from 83 subjects were used in the study analysis.
Of the 83 subjects, 58% were male. The mean age was 65 years ranging from 34
to 88 years. The majority of subjects (n=72, 87%) were Caucasian, the
remaining subjects included five (6%) African American, four (5%) Asian, and
two (2%) Hispanic.
A total of 398 draws were obtained from 83 subjects. The mean number of
draws per subject was 4.8 ranging from three to 17 draws. The length of time
over which the subjects were monitored ranged from 41 days to 2174 days with a
median of 175. The median interval between successive visits was 35 days
ranging from seven days to 1878 days.
15

--- Page 16 ---
For the 83 lung cancer cases, 80 were classified as non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) and three were classified as small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The
histopathology distribution of the subjects is summarized below:
Histologic Subtype N
Non-Small Cell
Adenocarcinoma 54
Squamous Cell 13
Large Cell 2
Mixed: Adnocarcinoma and Mucinous 1
Mixed: Adenosquamous Carcinoma 1
Mixed: Squamous Cell and Adenocarcinoma 1
Bronchoalveolar Carcinoma 4
No Further Histology 4
Small Cell 3
Total 83
Of 83 subjects, 69 subjects had staging information: nine (13%) were stage I or
II, while 60 (87%) were stage III or IV. As a consequence, the performance of
the Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 has not been adequately assessed in the patients with
Stage I or II diseases.
In addition, of 83 subjects, only three patients were diagnosed with small-cell
lung cancer; therefore, the performance of the Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 has not been
adequately assessed in the patients with small cell lung cancer.
Results:
A total of 398 samples from 83 subjects consisting of 83 baseline values and 315
monitoring observations were measured for the CYFRA 21-1 values using the
Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 assay on cobas e 411. At each follow-up visit, the
percentage change of the CYFRA 21-1 was calculated by comparing the test
result to the result obtained from the previous visit. The performance of the
Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 assay as an aid in monitoring disease progression during
the course of disease and treatment in lung cancer patients was determined by
assessing percentage changes of CYFRA 21-1 levels correlated to the clinical
assessment at the time of each follow-up visit. The changes in clinical status
were determined by the physicians based on the clinical information (medical
imaging, physical examination, physician transcription notes, and/or other
laboratory data). The following definitions were used to categorize the patient’s
disease status:
· No Evidence of Disease (NED): A complete lack of clinical evidence of
disease as determined by the treating physician.
· Stable Disease: Clinical evidence that the disease has not changed since
last assessment as determined by the treating physician.

· Responding Disease: Clinical evidence that there is a shrinking of the
primary tumor and no evidence of new tumors as determined by the
treating physician.
· Progressive Disease: Clinical evidence of growth in the primary tumor or
the appearance of new tumors since the last assessment as determined by
the treating physician.
The summary statistics of the ratio of the Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 results and
clinical disease status from the preceding draw for all follow-up draws is shown
in the following table:
Clinical Ratio of the Elecsys CYFRA 21-1

Responding 44 0.07 0.64 0.97 1.33 3.26
Progressive 59 0.04 0.94 1.38 2.31 22.26
Summary statistics showed the following:
· The NED, stable, and responding subjects have quite similar summary
statistics
· Nearly three quarters of the subject visits showing disease progression
had an increase in the Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 values
· A total of 26 out of 59 subject visits showing disease progression had an
increase of the Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 values greater than 50%
For evaluation of clinical sensitivity and specificity of the Elecsys CYFRA 21-1
assay, the clinical disease status was condensed into two categories: progression
and no-progression. Subjects with progression contained those monitoring
events defined as progressive disease. Subjects with no-progression contained
those monitoring events defined as NED, stable disease and responding disease.
The threshold for a statistically significant increase in CYFRA 21-1 values
incorporated both assay and biological variability and was based on the
published report of Trapé et al (Clinical Chemistry 51, pgs. 219-222, 2005). A
positive change in CYFRA 21-1 was defined as measurable increase in the value
that was at least 50% greater than the previous value of the test when the
CYFRA 21-1 result was outside the normal range.
The following table represents the number of all clinical visits (n=315) for 83
subjects at which a clinical evaluation of progression/no-progression occurred
and the percentage change of the subjects at these clinical evaluations using the
cut-off value of 50% increase:

b. Other clinical supportive data:
The clinical performance of the Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 assay at different %
change in CYFRA 21-1 was evaluated against that of the predicate CYFRA 21-1
EIA (K100831). The table below compared the clinical sensitivity and
specificities between the Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 assay and the predicate using a
series of % change in CYFRA 21-1 values as determined in two separate clinical
studies.

4. Clinical cut-off:
An absolute cutoff is not applicable for monitoring. CYFRA 21-1 value increases at
least 50% higher than immediate previous sample are considered a significant
change when the Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 result was outside the normal range.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected value/reference range of CYFRA 21-1 was determined in samples
from 240 healthy individuals and from 635 patients with nonmalignant or malignant

i. The upper limit of normal (ULN) for the Elecsys CYFRA assay:
The Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 values were analyzed in a cohort of 240 apparently
healthy individuals (125 females and 115 males, ages 25 to 87 years, with an
average age of 60 years and median age of 61 years) including 120 smokers and
120 nonsmokers. The sample cohort included 127 Caucasian, 52 African
American, 45 Hispanic, 13 Asian and three American Indian or Alaskan Native.
The results are shown as follows:
All Nonsmoker Smoker Female Male
N 240 120 120 125 115
Mean (ng/mL) 1.19 1.19 1.19 1.23 1.14
Median (ng/mL) 1.05 1.03 1.07 1.07 1.01
Min (ng/mL) 0.32 0.32 0.49 0.32 0.35
Max (ng/mL) 4.81 4.66 4.81 4.81 3.01
95th percentile (ng/mL) 2.38 2.59 2.00 2.32 2.43
97.5th percentile (ng/mL) 2.86 2.90 2.58 2.86 2.85
The results above were transformed using the Box-Cox transformation, the ULN
for the Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 assay was calculated based on the 95th percentile
using the transformed data and determined as 2.37 ng/mL (95% CI: 2.21 ng/mL–
2.90 ng/mL). It is recommended that each laboratory should investigate the
transferability of the expected values to its own patient population and if
necessary determine its own reference ranges.

The distribution of the Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 values in 875 of healthy subjects
and patients with various benign and malignant conditions is summarized as
