L. Test Principle:
The enzyme on the test strip, an FAD-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) expressed in
Aspergillus Oryzae, converts the glucose in the blood to gluconolactone. This reaction
creates a DC electrical current that the meter interprets for the blood glucose result. The
sample and the environmental conditions are evaluated using AC and DC signals.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using 3 test strip lots and 36 ACCU-CHEK Guide meters by
testing 10 venous blood samples with glucose concentrations ranging from 14 to
603.2 (14, 38.8, 60.8, 89.7, 123.4, 155.7, 198.8, 289, 449.4, 603.2) mg/dL. One run
(across all 36 meters) was performed with each sample using each of the strip lots.
The values from the ACCU-CHEK Guide meter were compared with those obtained
from the reference method. The results from regression analysis are summarized
below:
Lot #1: y=0.974x+0.097; R2 = 0.998
Lot #2: y=0.955 x+0.51; R2 = 0.998
Lot #3: y=0.957 x+1.55; R2 = 0.998
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of
20 to 600 mg/dL. The meter will display “LO” when the result is less than 20 mg/dL
and “HI” when result is greater than 600 mg/dL. The sponsor validated the “LO” and
“HI” functions and demonstrated that they functioned as intended.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: According to the sponsor, the ACCU-CHEK Guide system is traceable
to the NIST SRM 917 glucose reference material. A method comparison was
performed using the candidate device and a perchloric acid hexokinase method (PCA-
HK, Roche Cobas c 501) as the reference method (see Section 2.a.)
Value Assignment for Control Solutions: The previously cleared (k043474) ACCU-
CHEK Aviva control solutions (Levels 1 and 2) are available for use with the ACCU-
CHEK Guide test system as ACCU-CHEK Guide Control Solutions. Value
assignment for the control solutions is established for the ACCU-CHEK Guide test
system and is based on the mean of repeated measurements compared to the
established target values for each level. The control solution ranges are printed on the
test strip vial label.
Control Solution Stability: Protocols and acceptance criteria for open vial and closed
vial (shelf-life) stability for the control solutions were previously reviewed and found
to be acceptable under k043474. The labeling claims are 24 month shelf life stability
and 3 month open-vial stability when stored at the recommended storage
temperatures of 36°F to 90°F (2°C to 32°C). Labeling instructs the user not to freeze
the solutions.
Test Strip Stability: The protocols and acceptance criteria for the ACCU-CHEK
Guide test strips were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims that
both closed-vial (shelf life) and open-vial stability are up to 18 months when stored at
the recommended storage temperatures of 39-86°F (4-30°C) and 10-90% RH. The
labeling instructs the users not to freeze the test strips.

d. Detection limit:
The reportable range for the ACCU-CHEK Guide Blood Glucose Monitoring System
is 20 to 600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity study (M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
To assess potential interference the sponsor used venous whole blood samples
adjusted to 3 different glucose levels of 70, 120 and 250 mg/dL, split into a control
sample and a test sample. Various endogenous and exogenous substances were then
added to the test sample only. The % difference between the test and control sample
was calculated and the concentration tested at which no significant interference was
observed is presented in the table below:

The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling:
– Abnormally high concentrations of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) resulting in
blood concentration in excess of 5 mg/dL may cause inaccurate results. If you
are not sure please check with your doctor.
– Do not use this system during xylose absorption test.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To assess system accuracy, results from the ACCU-CHEK Guide Blood Glucose
Monitoring System were compared to a reference method, PCA-HK (Roche Cobas c
501). Capillary samples from 361 participants with glucose concentrations ranging
from 47.3-410.1 mg/dL glucose obtained on the reference were measured using one
of three test strip lots by a technician. The natural sample results relative to reference
are summarized in the tables below:

All 120 lay users were provided with labeling for the ACCU-CHEK Guide blood
glucose monitoring system. No other training or prompting was provided to the
subjects. The subjects then performed their own capillary finger stick and dosed one
ACCU -CHEK Guide test strip without any assistance from the technician. After
testing was completed, the subjects then filled out a questionnaire regarding their
experience with the testing and product labeling. The study demonstrated success in
the operation of the ACCU -CHEK Guide glucose system in the hands of lay users.
Alternative Site Test (Palm Site) by Lay Users:
Alternate Site study at palm site was performed by a total of 372 volunteers. Each lay
user measured his/her own samples, while another blood sample from each lay user
was also collected by a technician and measured by the reference method (PCA-HK).
The samples ranged from 48.6 to 457.7 mg/dL as measured by the reference method.

Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?:
Yes X or No .
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?:
Yes X or No .
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes X or No .
The applicant has provided documentation that indicates the device was designed and
developed under good software life-cycle processes.
3. Specimen Identification:
Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected. The ACCU-CHEK
Guide meter memory stores up to 720 glucose test results with the time and date of the
test and up to 32 control solutions results.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to quantitatively measure glucose in fresh capillary whole blood
from the finger, psalm and upper arm. There is not patient identification with this
system.
5. Calibration:
The meter does not require calibration or coding by the user.
6. Quality Control:
The ACCU-CHEK Guide Control Solutions are used as quality control checks to make
sure that the ACCU-CHEK Guide system and ACCU-CHEK Guide test strips are
working correctly. The labeling provides instructions on when quality control testing
should be performed. Once the control solution result is displayed on the meter a control
bottle symbol and a flashing L are displayed prompting the user to select the control
solution level that was used.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1) Hematocrit study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using venous whole blood
samples with hematocrit levels of 10 – 65% (10,15, 20, 25, 30, 45, 50, 55, 60, and 65%)
spiked with glucose to achieve target concentrations of 40, 80, 127, 200, and 360 mg/dL.
A total of 30 replicates were performed on 30 ACCU-CHEK Guide meters for each
combination of strip lot, glucose concentration, and hematocrit level. The results
demonstrated that the ACCU CHEK Guide Blood Glucose Monitoring System produces
accurate results over the claimed hematocrit range of 10 – 65%.
2) Altitude study:
To evaluate the effects of altitude on the Guide system results, venous blood samples
from three donors were altered to 5 glucose concentrations (60, 110, 160, 350 and 500
mg/dL) and tested at 10,150 feet above sea level. The meter results were compared to
those obtained with the reference method (PCA-HK). The results demonstrate acceptable
bias to the reference to support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 10,150 feet
have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements from the ACCU-CHEK Guide
Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
3) Temperature and humidity studies:
The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous blood samples at
target glucose concentrations of 70, 120, and 250 mg/dL to evaluate temperatures ranging
from 39-113°F (4-45°C) and relative humidity from 10-90%. Six combinations of the
claimed temperature and humidity operating conditions, including low temperature/low
humidity, high temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, and high
temperature/high humidity conditions, were evaluated and meter results compared to a
reference method. The results support the claimed range of operating conditions: 43-
113°F (6-45°C) and 10-90% relative humidity.
4) Sample volume study:
The sponsor performed a sample volume study with 24 ACCU-CHEK Guide meters to
support the claimed minimum sample volume requirement of 0.6 mL using blood samples
at three glucose concentrations (45, 120, 450 mg/dL). The system displays an error code
when insufficient sample is detected. Results support the claimed sample volume of 0.6
mL and demonstrate that insufficient sample volume error function is effective.
5) Infection Control Studies:
The device is intended for single-patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing
laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the
chosen disinfectant, Super Sani-Cloth (EPA registration #9480-4). Robustness studies
were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in
performance or external materials of the meter after 260 cleaning and disinfection cycles
12

(representing weekly disinfection for 5 years, the expected lifetime of the meter). The
subject device labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning
and disinfection procedures.
6) The sponsor provided appropriate documentation certifying that electromagnetic (EMC)
testing was performed and the ACCU-CHEK Guide Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems
was found to be compliant.
7) ACCU-CHEK Customer Care Service Center is available 24 hours a day, 365 day a year
by calling 1-800-858-8072.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
