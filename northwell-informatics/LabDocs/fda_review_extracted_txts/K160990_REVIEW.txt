H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Nova Max Uric Acid Monitoring System consists of the Nova Max Uric Acid
Monitor, Nova Max Uric Acid Test Strips and Nova Max Uric Acid Control Solutions.
The Nova Max Uric Acid Monitoring System is intended to be used for the quantitative
measurement of uric acid in fresh capillary whole blood obtained from the fingertip of
gout patients. It is intended for single-patient home use by prescription and should not be
shared. It is intended for self-testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people
with gout as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of uric acid control. It is intended for use
by patients undergoing treatment for gout or their caregivers on the order of a treating
healthcare professional. This system should not be used to alter gout treatment by
changing any medication schedule or dosage unless specifically instructed by a
healthcare professional. This system should only be used with single-use, auto-disabling
lancing devices. It should only be used with Nova Max Uric Acid Test Strips and Nova
Max Uric Acid Control Solutions.
2. Indication(s) for use:
See Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
The Nova Max Uric Acid Test Strips give correct results when the following limitations
are observed:
• Elevated levels of tolazamide, L-dopa, and methyl-dopa may falsely decrease
measured whole blood uric acid.
• Do not share monitor.
• Do not reuse! Each Uric Acid Test Strip is for single use only. Use a new Nova Max
Uric Acid Test Strip each time you test.
• Do not test samples other than fresh capillary whole blood collected from the
fingertip. Do not use serum or plasma.
• Do not use at altitudes above 15,000 feet (4572 meters) above sea level.
• Do not use at temperatures outside 59°F to 104°F (15°C to 40°C).
• Do not use when humidity is higher than 90% or lower than 10% as extremes in
humidity may cause incorrect results.
• Do not use when hematocrit (% of red blood cells) range is outside the acceptable
hematocrit range of 20% to 65%.

• Dopamine or ascorbic acid (vitamin C) may cause test results to be incorrect (falsely
low).
• Ibuprofen, for example Motrin, or drugs that contain ibuprofen, may cause test results
to be falsely high (up to 13% higher).
4. Special instrument requirements:
Nova Max Uric Acid Monitor
I. Device Description:
The Nova Max Uric Acid Monitoring System uses selective mediated enzymatic action
(uricase biosensor) to generate current across the electrodes. The current generated is
proportional to the concentration of uric acid in the capillary whole blood sample. The
device, which is amperometric, measures the uric acid concentration in the whole blood
sample by measuring the amount of current that was generated and flows through the
electrodes on the test strips.
The Nova Max Uric Acid Monitoring System is comprised of Nova Max Uric Acid Test
Strips, a portable handheld Nova Max Uric Acid Monitor, and Nova Max Uric Acid Control
Solutions.
Monitor Power Supply: The monitor uses a single volt (3V) lithium, non-rechargeable
battery. The battery life is approximately 1000 tests.
No-Coding System: The user is not required to enter a test strip lot-specific calibration code.
Uric Acid Control Solutions are aqueous assayed solutions, containing buffered uric acid,
preservatives, FD & C dye, and a viscosity additive. They contain no products of human
origin. There are three levels of controls (level 1, 2, and 3).
When a control solution sample is applied to the Nova Max Uric Acid Test Strip, the monitor
performs a uric acid measurement; the monitor marks the results. The processes of the
monitor operation between measuring the control solution sample and measuring a normal
patient sample are the same.
Safety lancets are provided as an accessory to the Nova Max Uric Acid Monitoring System.
They are commercially available single-use, auto disabling sterilized lancing devices.

L. Test Principle:
The Nova Max Uric Acid Monitoring System uses the enzymatic conversion of uric acid by
uricase to allantoin. This reaction quantitatively produces hydrogen peroxide (equation 1).
The hydrogen peroxide then reacts quantitatively with ferrocyanide in the presence of
peroxidase forming ferricyanide (equation 2). The current generated at the electrode by the
conversion of ferricyanide to ferrocyanide is proportional to the uric acid of the sample
(equation 3).

Uric acid measurement is based on the following equations:
The current generated at the electrode is proportional to the uric acid concentration of the
sample. By measuring the generated current, the concentration of the uric acid in the sample
is determined.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A day-to-day precision study was performed by measuring three test strip lots on two
meters, twice a day for twenty days using control solutions. The levels of uric acid
tested were 5, 10.5, and 16 mg/dL. The total imprecision was calculated (which
included test strip lot, meter and day as components of variability):

A second precision study was conducted to evaluate within-run precision. Four
different whole blood specimens were prepared with levels of uric acid (4.4, 8.8, 11.8
and 17.1 mg/dL). The specimens were tested 10 times on 5 separate meters (n=50).
The testing was conducted three times using three separate test strip lots. Each test
strip lot was also tested using three different levels of uric acid control solutions (5,
10.5 and 16 mg/dL). Standard deviation was reported for the lowest concentration of
uric acid in the control solution and whole blood samples; % CV for all others.

Stability:
Control solution: The shelf life stability for the Nova Max Uric Acid Control Solution
has been validated for up to 18 months at room temperature, 15 – 30 °C (60 – 85 °F)
on three lots of control solution. The protocols and acceptance criteria were found to
be acceptable.
Test Strip: The shelf life stability for the Nova Max Uric Acid Test Strips has been
validated for up to 18 months at room temperature, 15 – 30 °C (60 – 85 °F) on three
lots of test strips. The protocols and acceptance criteria were found to be acceptable.
Test Strip Open Vial Stability: The open vial stability for the Nova Max Uric Acid
Test Strips has been validated for up to 90 days at room temperature, 15 – 30 °C (60 –
85 °F). The protocols and acceptance criteria were found to be acceptable.
Control solution open vial stability: The open vial stability for the three levels of
Nova Max Uric Acid Control Solution has been validated for up to 90 days at room
temperature, 15 – 30 °C (60 – 85 °F). The protocols and acceptance criteria were
found to be acceptable.
Value Assignment:
The value assignment protocol for the quality control solutions was reviewed and
found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) was established by taking 100 measurements of a blank
solution and estimating the LoB non-parametrically as the 95th percentile of the
measurement. This yielded a LoB of 0.26 mg/dL.
Four samples with low concentrations of uric acid (4x LoB or 1.04 mg/dL) were used
to estimate the limit of detection (LoD) and the limit of quantitation (LoQ) of the
device. The LoD was calculated using the following equation: LoB + 1.6494*SD.
The LoQ was the lowest concentration with a CV less than 20%. The results of the
detection limits studies are summarized below:

e. Analytical specificity:
To assess potential interference, venous whole blood samples spiked to three uric acid
concentration ranges (3-9 mg/dL, 9-15 mg/dL and 15-19 mg/dL) were used. Each of
these samples was divided into three pools: control, test pool 1 and test pool 2. The
exogenous and endogenous interfering substances were added to the test pools at
different concentrations. The percent difference between the test samples and the
control sample was calculated. The sponsor defined no significant interference as ≤
10% difference between the test samples and the control samples. No interference
was observed with the following compounds at the concentrations listed:
Substance Concentrations Tested
Acetaminophen 5 and 20 mg/dL
Ascorbic acid 0.6 and 3 mg/dL

conducted in the U.S. to evaluate the Nova Max Uric Acid Monitoring System. The
goal of the study was to determine the subjects’ ability to use the device. The lay-
users were provided the labeling; they used the device and filled out a questionnaire.
From the data recorded, 99.2% (119/120) of the subjects were able to successfully
perform a capillary fingerstick whole blood measurement and 97.5% (117/120) of the
subjects were able to successfully perform a control solution test. The response to the
questionnaire indicated that the participants were able to understand the labeling,
understand the test result and operate the Nova Max Uric Acid Monitoring System.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Nova performed a reference range study to determine reference uric acid levels in
capillary whole blood obtained from the fingertip of adult subjects (139 males and 150
females) who were not taking any medications known to affect uric acid levels in the
blood, and who did not present with any conditions known to elevate or reduce levels of
uric acid in the blood.
The central 95% reference interval for uric acid in capillary whole blood obtained from a
fingerstick was 3.6 – 7.7 mg/dL in healthy males and 2.6 – 6.2 mg/dL for healthy
females. These upper and lower reference limits show agreement with published ranges
of serum uric acid levels in adult populations.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Sample Volume Study
The nominal fill indicated by the labeling of the device is 1.2 μl of capillary whole blood.
A study was performed to determine the minimum fill volume of the test strip. Five
different meters were tested with three whole blood samples spiked to different uric acid
concentrations (5.1, 10.2, and 16.8 mg/dL). Different volumes of whole blood were
added to the test strips to determine the minimum volume to trigger the device to take a
reading. 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 μl were tested with three different lots of test strips.
100% (90/90) of the test strips triggered a reading at sample volumes ≥ 1.2 μl. 89/90 of
the samples triggered readings at 1.1 μl. No test result was released for the remaining
1/90 or for the other volumes tested less than 1.1 μl. These results support the claimed
sample volume of 1.2 μl.
2. Altitude Study
The effect of altitude was simulated by changing the amount of dissolved oxygen in
whole blood with a tonometer to simulate the oxygen concentration in blood at three
different altitudes. Two different meters with three venous whole blood samples spiked
with uric acid (5.1, 10.2, and 16.8 mg/dL) were used in the study. The result were
compared to results obtained using the predicate device. The study demonstrated that the
reported uric acid results in whole blood are constant across different pO2 levels and that
altitude up 15,000 feet (4572 meters) above sea level did not impact the reported uric acid
results.
3. Hematocrit Study:
Three different test strip lots were analyzed at five different hematocrit levels (20, 35, 45,
55, and 65%) using five venous whole blood samples spiked with uric acid (3.4, 7.3,
10.8, 14.3, and 18.1 mg/dL) on five different meters. The result were compared to results
obtained using the predicate device. The performance of the three lots of test strips
demonstrates that the hematocrit levels tested did not affect the performance of the uric
acid system.
4. Test System Operating Conditions – humidity and temperature:
Three different test strip lots were analyzed at five different temperature and humidity
combinations (5 C/10% humidity, 5C/90%, 25 C/50%, 40 C/10% and 40 C/90%
humidity) on five different meters using three whole blood samples spiked with uric acid
(6.3, 9.9, and 16.8 mg/dL). The result were compared to results obtained using the
predicate device. The uric acid control solutions were also evaluated at the five different
12

--- Page 13 ---
temperature and humidity concentrations on five different meters. The performance of the
device was not significantly affected by the variation in temperature or humidity for
either the whole blood samples or the control solutions.
5. Accelerated Bench Testing Using Clorox Germicidal Disposable Wipes:
Accelerated cleaning protocols of the monitors were done on four separate devices to
evaluate the deterioration of the device due to regular cleaning as indicated in the product
labeling. Each monitor was cleaned and disinfected 10,950 times to simulate 10 cycles
per day on each monitor for a period of 3 years. None of the four monitors tested showed
any deterioration of the housing material, the display screen, the power button and all
four devices passed the internal test procedures for functionality of all monitor
components including the electronics, display, beeper, test strip port reader and buttons.
6. Disinfection Efficacy/Infection Control Study:
The device is intended for single-patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing
laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the
Clorox Healthcare Germicidal Wipes, EPA# 67619-12. The meter passed the evaluation
of virus elimination protocol acceptance criteria with the Clorox Healthcare Bleach
Germicidal Wipes.
7. Pre and Post Cleaning and Disinfection Precision and Accuracy Study:
To evaluate the precision of the four monitors used in the accelerated cleaning protocol
above, each monitor took 25 measurements of 5 blood specimens with different uric acid
concentrations before and after the cleaning/disinfection cycles. Accuracy was evaluated
by measuring five whole blood samples with each of the four meters for five different
uric acid concentrations before and after the 10,950 cleaning cycles and comparing the
results to the predicate as well as the meters before the cleaning. The 10,950 cleaning and
disinfection cycles on the Nova Max did not impact the analytical performance of the
monitors.
