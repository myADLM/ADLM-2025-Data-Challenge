H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
AssureTech Methamphetamine Tests are immunochromatographic assays for the
qualitative determination of d-Methamphetamine in human urine at cut-off concentration
of 1000 ng/mL. The tests are available in a Strip format, a Cup format, a Dip Card format
and a Turn Key Split Cup format.
The tests provide only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test
result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. The tests are intended for over-the-counter and for
prescription use.
AssureTech Phencyclidine Tests are immunochromatographic assays for the qualitative
determination of Phencyclidine in human urine at cut-off concentration of 25 ng/mL. The
tests are available in a Strip format, a Cup format, a Dip Card format and a Turn Key
Split Cup format.
The tests provide only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test
result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. The tests are intended for over-the-counter and for
prescription use.
AssureTech Marijuana Tests are immunochromatographic assays for the qualitative
determination of 11-Nor- 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol-9-COOH in human urine at cut-off
concentration of 50 ng/mL. The tests are available in a Strip format, a Cup format, a Dip
Card format and a Turn K△ey Split Cup format.
The tests provide only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical

result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. The tests are intended for over-the-counter and for
prescription use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For over-the-counter use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable; this is a visually read single use device.
I. Device Description:
The AssureTech Methamphetamine Test is for the qualitative determination of d-
Methamphetamine in human urine. The AssureTech Phencyclidine Test is for the qualitative
determination of Phencyclidine in human urine. The AssureTech Marijuana Test is for the
qualitative determination of 11-Nor- 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol-9-COOH in human urine.
Each test device has four formats: Strip, Dip Card, Quick Cup, Turn-Key Split Cup. The
Strip format is comprised of a urine c△ollection cup and a test strip with sample pad with a
lateral flow. The Dip Card format is comprised of a urine collection cup and the dip card
with a plastic casing as the lateral flow device. The Quick Cup format is comprised of a
urine collection cup and a quick cup test with a lateral flow device that will start when the
cap is screwed onto cup. The Turn-Key Split Cup is comprised of a urine collection cup and
a turn-key Split Cup test with a lateral flow device that will start the test when the cap is
screwed onto cup and key is turned 180 degrees.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The tests are lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays. During testing, a urine specimen
migrates upward by capillary action. If target drug present in the urine specimen is below the
cut-off concentration, it will not saturate the binding sites of its specific monoclonal mouse
antibody coated on the particles. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by
immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the test line region.
The colored line will not form in the test line region if the target drug level exceeds its cutoff-
concentration because it will saturate all the binding sites of the antibody coated on the
particles. A band should form in the control region of the devices regardless of the presence
of drug or metabolite in the sample to indicate that sufficient volume of sample has been
applied.

+75% cut off and +100% cut off. These samples were prepared by spiking drug in
negative urine samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by GC/MS. The
concentration levels used in the study are: 0, 255, 509, 747, 1011, 1265, 1518, 1760
and 2015 ng/mL for Methamphetamine tests; 0, 7, 13, 20, 27, 33, 39, 45 and 53
ng/mL for Phencyclidine tests; and 0, 14, 28, 39, 53, 61, 73, 90 and 103 ng/mL for
Marijuana tests. All sample aliquots were blindly labeled by the person who prepared
the samples and didn’t take part in the sample testing. For each concentration, tests
were performed two runs per day for 25 days per device in a randomized order.
Three lots of each format for each analytes test were used in the study. The results
obtained are summarized in the following tables.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable, these devices are intended for qualitative use only.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
External control materials are not supplied with the devices; however, the package
inserts list information on how to obtain control materials.
Sample Storage and Stability - Protocols and acceptance criteria for real time,
accelerated and transportation simulation stability studies were described and found
to be acceptable. The real time stability data supports the sponsor’s claim that the
devices are stable at 39.2oF to 86oF (4°C to 30°C) for 24 months.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
The potential effect of endogenous and exogenous interferents was tested by spiking
the interferents into drug-free urine, and target drug urine with concentrations at 25%
below and 25% above the cut-off levels by using three lots and three operators for
each format. Compounds that showed no interference at a concentration of
100µg/mL are summarized in the following tables. There were no differences

To test cross-reactivity, drug metabolites and other components in urine samples that
are likely to interfere were tested using three batches of each device format. The
lowest concentration that caused a positive result for each compound is listed below.
There were no differences observed for different device formats for each analyte test.

To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine pH, urine samples with
1.009 to 1.030 specific gravity or urine samples with pH 4 to 9 were spiked with
target drugs at 25% below and 25% above the cutoff levels. These samples were
tested using three lots of each device. Results were all positive for samples at and
above +25% cut-off and all negative for samples at and below -25% cut-off. There
were no differences observed for different format of each analyte test.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cut-off
concentration appears in the precision/reproducibility section above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies for the AssureTech Methamphetamine Tests, the
AssureTech Phencyclidine Tests and the AssureTech Marijuana Tests were
performed in-house by three laboratory assistants for each device. Operators ran 80
(40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered clinical samples. The samples were blind
labeled and compared to GC/MS results. The results are presented in the tables
below:

Lay-user study:
A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 1638 lay persons.
The lay users had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in
age from 18 to > 50 years. Urine samples were prepared at the following
concentrations; negative, +/-75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of the cutoff by spiking drug(s)
into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were
confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers and
