I. Device Description:
The LIAISON H. pylori lgG assay is a two-step, indirect assay for the determination of IgG
antibodies to Helicobacter pylori by chemiluminescence immunoassay. The principle
components of the test are magnetic particles (solid phase) coated with H. pylori antigen and
anti-human IgG monoclonal antibodies labelled with an isoluminol derivative.
During the first incubation, H. pylori antibodies present in calibrators, samples or controls
(sold separately) bind to the solid phase functionalized with H. pylori antigen. During the
second incubation, the antibody conjugate reacts with H. pylori IgG already bound to the
solid phase. After each incubation, the unbound material is removed with a wash cycle (wash
buffer sold separately). Subsequently, the starter reagents (sold separately) are added and a
flash chemiluminescence reaction is thus induced. The light signal, and hence the amount of
isoluminol-antibody conjugate, is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU)
and is indicative of H. pylori IgG concentration present in calibrators, samples or controls.

--- Page 3 ---
The calibrator concentrations (Index Values) are referenced to an in-house standard
preparation. The light signal is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU)
and is proportional to the concentration of antibodies to H. pylori present in the calibrator,
controls or sample. Table 1 summarizes the interpretation of results.
Table 1. Interpretation of results:
Index Results Interpretation
<0.80 Negative A negative result generally indicates that the patient has not been infected,
(No further testing) but does not always rule out acute H. pylori infection.
≥0.80 Equivocal Equivocal samples must be retested by the LIAISON® H. pylori IgG assay
and (Retest) in order to confirm the initial result.
<0.90 Samples which are positive (≥0.90) at the second test should be considered
positive. Samples which are negative (<0.80) at the second test should be
considered negative.
For samples that are equivocal on retesting; a new specimen should be collected
and tested.
≥ 0.90 Positive
Indicates the presence of detectable IgG antibody to H. pylori.
(No further testing)
The results are only intended to be read on the LIASON® XL Analyzer (sold separately). The
LIAISON XL Analyzer was FDA cleared (K103529). The LIAISON® XL Analyzer with
software version 4.0.0.4 was FDA cleared in April 2013 with the DiaSorin LIAISON® TSH
assay K130469. There have been changes to the LIAISON® XL Analyzer software since it
was cleared under K130469, and the subject iteration of the software is 4.1.0.3 SP1 dated
10/2015.
The LIAISON® H. pylori IgG assay is an in vitro diagnostic device consisting of reagents
provided in individual compartments within a plastic container called the Reagent Integral.
The assay configuration for the LIAISON® H. pylori IgG assay allows for the performance of
100 tests. A list of the components that make up the Reagent Integrals is listed below in

L. Test Principle:
This test is a Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (CLIA) – Immunoassay technology based on
the emission of light as a result of a chemical reaction. During the first incubation,
Helicobacter pylori antibodies present in diluted calibrators, samples or controls bind to the
solid phase. During the second incubation, the monoclonal antibody conjugate reacts with
anti-H. pylori IgG that is already bound to the solid phase. After each of the incubations,
unbound material is removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently, the starter reagents are added
and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is thus induced. The light signal, and therefore, the
amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate, are measured by a photomultiplier as RLUs and
are indicative of the presence of anti-H. pylori IgG in calibrators, samples or controls.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was assessed by measuring repeatability at one site using two kit controls and
six serum samples containing high negative (samples #1 and #2), low positive (samples
#3 and #4) and moderate positive (samples #5 and #6) concentrations of H. pylori IgG.
Samples and kit controls (negative and positive) were assayed in duplicate in two runs
per day over 12 operating days with multiple technicians. Mean, standard deviation, and
coefficient of variation (%CV) were calculated using multiple sources of variability that
included within-run, within-day, between-day, and total variability. The results are
summarized in Table 3

High Dose Hook Effect (false negative):
Analysis of high-dose hook effect was evaluated by testing three samples with H.
pylori IgG levels out-of-range > 9.4 index values. The testing produced index values
that were above the measuring range with no sample misclassification, indicating that
no hook effect was observed.
Interference:
Testing was performed to determine interference in the presence of exogenous
substances from commonly used medications (Table 7a) relevant to gastrointestinal
tract complications or endogenous substances that may be found in serum (Table 7b).
Two matched sample pools containing antibodies to H. pylori IgG near the clinical
decision point (low positive and high negative) were tested neat and spiked with the
respective interferent.
Acceptance criteria required that the percent change in signal not be more than +/-
10% and that the qualitative result must not change. No interference was observed in
the LIAISON® H. pylori IgG at the highest concentration for each substance listed
below.

f. Assay cut-off:
The LIAISON® H. pylori IgG assay defines a sample as positive if the Index value is
greater than or equal to 0.90 Index, and defined as negative if the Index value is less
than 0.80 Index. Samples with results greater than or equal to 0.80 Index and less than
0.90 Index are classified as equivocal.
The preliminary cutoff was determined by testing 417 selected H. pylori positive and
negative serum samples in parallel with the LIAISON® H. pylori IgG assay and a
comparison method. This cut-off was validated during clinical studies by testing a
prospective population of 504 specimens; that were 110 positive for IgG antibodies to
Helicobacter pylori, 381 negative for IgG antibodies to Helicobacter pylori, and 13
equivocal results as determined by the IMMULITE® 2000 H. pylori IgG assay. The
13 equivocal results by the comparison method were not included in the cutoff
validation data analysis. The results of the cutoff assay were determined to be
appropriate for the LIAISON® H. pylori IgG assay.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The observed seroprevalence from the LIAISON® H. pylori IgG assay was calculated
from the 504 samples sent to the lab for H. pylori IgG testing. The samples were
collected from multiple U.S. geographical locations from 151 male (30%) and 353 female
(70%) adult subjects. Known ages ranged from 18 to 91 years.

The H. pylori seroprevalence may vary depending upon geographical location, age,
gender, type of test employed, specimen collection and handling procedures as well as
clinical history of the patient.
The H. pylori IgG seropervelence as observed with the LIAISON® H. pylori IgG assay is
22.4% (113/504) for the current submission. Equivocal results from the LIAISON® H.
pylori IgG assay are considered negative for the seroprevalence calculations.

XL Analyzer
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The LIAISON® H. pylori IgG assay is a two-step, indirect chemiluminescence
immunoassay (CLIA) for qualitative determination of IgG antibodies to H. pylori. The
principal components of the test are magnetic particles (solid phase) coated with H. pylori
antigen and a conjugate of anti-human IgG monoclonal antibodies labelled with an
isoluminol derivative. During the first incubation, H. pylori antibodies present in
calibrators, samples or controls bind to the solid phase. During the second incubation, the
monoclonal antibody conjugate reacts with H. pylori IgG that is already bound to the
solid phase. After each incubation, unbound material is removed with a wash cycle.
Subsequently, the starter reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is
thus induced. The light signal, and therefore, the amount of isoluminol-antibody
conjugate, are measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and are
indicative of the presence of H. pylori IgG in calibrators, samples or controls.

3. Specimen Identification:
Specimens are identified by unique barcodes
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimens can be processed directly from primary collection vials or as aliquots of the
specimen in secondary vials.
5. Calibration:
DiaSorin's LIAISON® H. pylori IgG assay generates a continuous response (relative light
units, RLU) which is used in sample grading to provide a qualitative (positive, negative,
or equivocal) reportable result. The sample grading is based on the use of a calibration
curve referenced to an ‘In-house’ anti-H. pylori IgG reference standard curve (Master
Curve) and is controlled by the use of two calibrators (Calibrator 1 and Calibrator 2)
provided in the Reagent Integral.
The Master Curve is stored on the LIAISON® XL Analyzer and specifically matched to
the kit in use via the instructions encoded in the RFID tag attached to the Reagent
Integral. Each 10 point Master Curve has been generated by a mathematical elaboration
of the data resulting from multiple testing (a minimum of 10 runs) of Master Standards.
The Master Standards are prepared from pooled human serum positive for anti-H. pylori
IgG also referred to as the ‘in house’ Primary Standard Reference Preparation.
The kit calibrators are manufactured by diluting stock solutions consisting of individual
or pooled human serum positive for anti-H. pylori IgG at an established Index value with
Universal Negative Serum according to MP25832 and MP25833. The kit calibrators are
tested with a specific Integral lot against the Master Calibrators to assess the
concentration. They are subsequently corrected by dilution or concentration if the result
(Index value) is out of the target range.
Calibrator 1 is manufactured to have a target anti-H. pylori IgG of 1.2 Index value.
Calibrator 2 is manufactured to have a target anti-H. pylori IgG of 6.0 Index value.
The Calibrators are assayed by the user with a specific Reagent Integral lot to transform
the Master Curve into a Working Curve and further used to calculate sample results. The
LIAISON® XL Analyzer Working Curve is obtained by the user during assay calibration
by assigning a curve to the two point kit calibrators based upon the Master Curve. This
Working Curve is used to calculate the patient sample results. The Analyzer is calibrated
in triplicate whenever one of the following conditions occurs:
• Quality Control results are out of the acceptable range.
• With each new lot of reagents (Reagent Integral or Starter Reagents)
• After each servicing of the LIAISON® XL Analyzer
• The previous calibration was performed more than four weeks before

6. Quality Control:
LIAISON® H. pylori IgG Control Set ([REF] 318981) is intended to monitor for
substantial reagent failure. LIAISON® controls should be run in singlicate to monitor the
assay performance. Quality control is required to be performed once per day of use, or
according to the guidelines or requirements of local regulations or accredited
organizations. It is recommended that the user refer to CLSI C24-A35 and 42 CFR
493.1256(c) for guidance on appropriate quality control practices.
The expected range of control concentrations is provided on the certificate of analysis,
the test is valid. If control values lie outside the expected ranges, the test is invalid and
patient results cannot be reported. Assay calibration should be performed if a control
failure is observed and controls and patient specimens must be repeated.
