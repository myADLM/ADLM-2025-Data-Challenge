L. Test Principle:
A chemiluminescent immunoassay technique is used, in which a polyclonal goat anti-human
antibody recognizing the C-terminal region (amino acids 39-84) of human PTH is used as the
capture antibody. A polyclonal goat anti-human PTH antibody which recognizes the N-
terminal region (amino acids1-84) of PTH, is conjugated with acridinium for detection. This
system also detects the large PTH fragment of amino acid 7-84. Patient samples are
incubated with both antibodies followed by the addition of streptavidin coated magnetic
particles with further incubation. A magnet is then used to capture the labeled antibody-
antigen complexes, and following a wash and the addition of reagent, the concentration of
PTH is determined. Concentration of PTH is directly proportional the amount of emitted light
from the acridinium labels.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated by testing 1 human serum sample and 6 human K2-EDTA
plasma samples using two lots of IDS-iSYS Intact PTHN reagent cartridges on two
analyzers (one lot per analyzer). Each sample was tested in duplicate, 2 runs per day,
for 20 days for a total of 80 results per reagent lot/analyzer. Similar precision results
were obtained from both lots. Precision results from one lot are provided below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were performed using serum and K2-EDTA plasma samples in
accordance with CLSI EP-6A.
The serum samples were prepared by diluting a high serum sample with a low serum
sample to obtain 15 evenly spaced intermediate PTH sample concentrations. The
expected PTH concentrations were as follows: 3.54, 7.28, 11.02, 22.24, 78.35,
115.75, 227.96, 377.58, 751.62, 1125.67, 1499.71, 1873.76, 2247.80, 2621.84,
2743.98, 2995.89, and 3369.93 pg/mL. Each sample was assayed in replicates of
four. The following linear regression analysis for serum was obtained:
y= 1.02 x – 0.2 pg/mL , R2= 1.00
The K2-EDTA plasma samples were prepared by diluting a high K2-EDTA sample
with a low K2-EDTA sample to obtain 15 evenly spaced intermediate PTH sample
concentrations. The expected concentrations were as follows: 2.91, 6.31, 9.72, 19.92,
70.96, 104.99, 207.07, 343.18, 683.45, 1023.73, 1364.00, 1704.27, 2044.54, 2384.81,
2725.08, 3065.36, and 3405.63 pg/mL. Each sample was assayed in replicates of
four. The following linear regression analysis for K2-EDTA was obtained:
y= 0.96 x – 0.1 pg/mL, R2= 1.00
The results from the linearity study support the sponsor’s claimed measuring range
for the IDS iSYS Intact PTHN assay of 5.0 to 3500 pg/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Cleared in k103325.
Stability:
Cleared in k103325. The calibrators are stable for 6 months unopened when stored at
2-8o C; for 14 days when open and reconstituted and stored at 2-8o C; and for 2 hours
on board the analyzer.
Calibrator Value Assignment:
Cleared in k103325.

d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ)
were determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A.
The LoB was determined for three lots of reagent cartridges by testing a zero serum
based calibrator in replicates of 10 over 6 assays for a total of 60 measurements per
lot. LoB was determined by the parametric method of calculating the concentration
corresponding to the 95% probability of detecting a blank sample using the equation
LoB= mean + 1.65 x SD ( ).
(blank) blank
The LoD was determined for three cartridge reagent lots by assaying 10 serum
samples with very low PTH concentrations in duplicate over 6 assays spanning
multiple days for a total of 120 measurements per lot. LoD was calculated using a
parametric method to determine the lowest concentration that can be detected 95% of
the time.
The LoQ was determined for three reagent cartridge lots by testing 10 low PTH level
serum samples in duplicate over 6 assays spanning multiple days for a total of 120
measurements per lot. LoQ was determined as the lowest PTH concentration from
the regression curve for which %CV is less than 20%.
The results of detection limit studies are summarized in the table below:
Limit of Blank Limit of Detection Limit of Quantitation
0.9 pg/mL 2.3 pg/mL 4.5 pg/mL
The claimed measuring range of the assay is 5.0 to 3500 pg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP7-A2. Samples
with low and high PTH concentrations were spiked with potential interfering
substances. Percent interference was calculated using the following formula:
mean conc. of spiked sample – mean conc. of un-spiked sample x100
mean concentration of un-spiked sample
For total cholesterol and Rheumatoid factor (Rf) the interference was evaluated by
recovery of Intact PTH from a high pool was spiked into a sample with known
interferent substance levels. Percent recovery was calculated using the formula
below:
% Recovery = (Recovery value / Expected recovery value) x 100

[Table 1 on page 6]
Limit of Blank	Limit of Detection	Limit of Quantitation

The interference study results are summarized in the table below:

The labeling includes the following limitations:
“Total cholesterol at concentrations greater than 395 mg/dL have been shown to
cause falsely elevated Intact PTH results when measured by this assy. Samples that
contain high levels of total cholesterol should not be measured using this Intact PTH
assay.”
“HAMA at concentrations of 1000 ng/mL have been shown to interfere with Intact
PTH results when measured by this assay of up to 14.4% bias.”
Cross Reactivity:
Cross-reactivity studies were performed according to CLSI EP-7A2. A serum sample
and a zero calibrator matrix was spiked with human PTH fragments and structurally
similar proteins at the concentrations listed below. The cross reactivity was
determined by the following formula:
% cross reactivity =
Mean conc. of spiked sample – mean conc. of un-spiked sample x100%
Spike concentration

High Dose Hook Effect:
A hook effect study was performed to determine if the IDS-iSYS Intact PTHN assay
is susceptible to produce falsely low results in the presence of very high levels of
PTH. One K2-EDTA sample and two serum samples were spiked with the following
concentrations of 1-84 PTH: 5,000, 25,000, 50,000, 75,000, and 100,000 pg/mL.
Each specimen was measured in replicates of 4 using 3 reagent lots. The study
demonstrated that no high dose hook effect was observed for intact PTH
concentrations up to 100,000 pg/mL.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The IDS iSYS Intact PTHN assay was compared against the previously cleared IDS
iSYS Intact PTH (k103325) assay in accordance with CLSI EP-9A2.

and predicate devices at two external sites. The PTH concentrations as measured by
the candidate device ranged from 6.3 to 3378 pg/mL. Three reagent cartridge lots of
the candidate device were used in the study. Deming regression analysis of the
results yielded the following regression equation:
y=1.02x – 0.7, r=1.00 (n=312)
