I. Device Description:
The Solana® Trichomonas Assay amplifies and detects Trichomonas vaginalis nucleic acids
present in clinician-collected vaginal swab and urine specimens from symptomatic and
asymptomatic women. The assay targets a conserved multi-copy sequence in the T. vaginalis
genome.
The vaginal swab is eluted in a swab lysis tube or a urine specimen is added to a urine lysis tube,
and the cells are lysed by heat treatment. After heat treatment, an aliquot of the lysed specimen is
transferred into a dilution tube. An aliquot of the diluted sample is added to a reaction tube. The
reaction tube contains lyophilized HDA reagents, dNTPs, primers, and probes, which are
rehydrated upon addition of the diluted sample. The reaction tube is placed in the Solana
instrument for amplification and detection of the T. vaginalis-specific target sequence. In the
Solana instrument, the target sequence is amplified by T. vaginalis specific primers and detected
by a T. vaginalis specific fluorescent probe. A competitive process control (PRC) is included in
the lysis tube to monitor sample processing, inhibitory substances in clinical samples, reagent
failure, or device failure. The PRC target is amplified by T. vaginalis specific primers and
detected by a PRC specific fluorescent probe.
The target and PRC probes are dual-labeled with a quencher and fluorophore on either end. Upon
annealing to T. vaginalis or PRC amplicons, the fluorescent probes are cleaved and the
fluorescent signal increases due to physical separation of the fluorophore from the quencher. The
2

Solana instrument measures and interprets the fluorescent signal using on-board method-specific
algorithms. Solana instrument then reports the test results to the user on its display screen and
can print the results via a printer.

L. Test Principle:
The Solana® Trichomonas assay on the Solana® instrument uses helicase-dependent
amplification (HDA) to detect a conserved repeated fragment in the T. vaginalis genome. For
vaginal swab specimens, the swab is eluted in the lysis buffer tube. For urine specimens, an 800
µl aliquot of urine is added to the lysis buffer tube. In addition to containing the reagents needed
for lysis, the lysis buffer tube also contains an internal process control. The samples in the lysis
buffer are then heated to lyse the cells, and an aliquot of the lysed sample is added to the dilution
buffer tube. The diluted sample is then added to the reaction tube, which contains the lyophilized
reagents necessary for the HDA reaction, including the primers, fluorescently labeled probe,
dNTPs and PCR reagents. The reaction tube is placed in the Solana® instrument, where
amplification of the targeted sequence occurs and is detected via fluorescence intensity. The
fluorescent signal is then converted to a qualitative result, which is displayed for the end user.

LoD), low positive (1X LoD) and a high negative (1/54X LoD for samples in vaginal swab
matrix and 1/27X LoD for samples in urine matrix). Each panel member, along with positive and
negative controls, was tested in triplicate by two operators per day over twelve non-consecutive
days. For each sample type, a total of 72 replicates per each panel member were tested. The
overall percent agreement between all 72 replicates for the high negative samples in the vaginal
swab and urine matrices was 72% and 67%, respectively. All other panel members in both
clinical matrices had an overall agreement of 100%. Tables 1 and 2 list the precision study data

Reproducibility
The reproducibility of the Solana® Trichomonas assay was assessed using a panel consisting of
three concentrations of Trichomonas vaginalis diluted in negative clinical matrix as well as a
negative sample for both the vaginal swab and urine specimen types. The concentrations of the
panel members consisted of a moderate positive (3X LoD), low positive (1X LoD) and a high
negative (1/54 LoD for vaginal swab studies and 1/27 LoD for urine studies). Each panel
member, along with positive and negative controls, was tested in triplicate by two operators per
day for five non-consecutive days at three testing sites. A total of 90 replicates per panel member
were tested. In both, the urine and vaginal swab low positive, moderate positive, and negative
panel members, 100% agreement was found between all 90 replicates for each respective panel
member. The negative and positive controls that were run with each panel also exhibited a 100%
overall agreement between all replicates. An overall agreement of 69% and 68% was found for
the vaginal swab and urine high negative panel members, respectively. These percent agreements
for the high negative samples fall within the recommended 20-80% range. Results are presented
in Table 3 and Table 4 for the vaginal swab and urine samples, respectively.

Specimen Stability
Vaginal Swabs: The stability of TV in two types of vaginal swab transport media, Liquid Amies
and Liquid Stuart, was tested. A 2X LoD concentration of TV organisms was inoculated into the
transport media with negative vaginal matrix. The samples were stored at either 2-8°C for 0, 1, 2,
3, 5, 7 and 8 days, or room temperature (30°C) for 0, 2.5, 6.5, 24, 25, 27, 48 and 49 hours. The
samples were tested in triplicate per time point along with positive and negative controls. The
data indicated that specimens may be stored in both transport media between 2 and 8°C for up to
7 days, and at 30°C for up to 48 hours prior to testing.
Urine: Negative urine matrix was spiked with a 2X LoD concentration of TV and stored
according to the same protocol as the vaginal swab samples. The data indicated that urine
specimens can be stored between 2 and 8°C for up to 7 days, and at 30°C for up to 24 hours prior
to testing.
Sample Stability in Lysis Buffer:
The sample stability after the addition of lysis buffer was assessed before and after the sample
was heated as per instructions in the package insert. For the samples stored before the heat step,
TV was inoculated at the 2X LoD concentration into negative clinical matrix (either vaginal
swab or urine), mixed with the lysis buffer and then stored at 2-8°C for 0, 24, 48, 72 and 73
hours. For the samples stored after the heat step, the inoculated negative matrix was mixed with
lysis buffer, heated at 95°C for 5 minutes, and then stored at 2-8°C for 0, 24, 48, 72 and 73
hours. The samples were tested in triplicate per time point along with positive and negative
controls. The data indicate that urine and vaginal swab samples that are mixed with lysis buffer
are stable for up to 72 hours at 2-8°C both before and after heat treatment.
Specimen Stability in Dilution Buffer
The stability of the lysed TV sample mixed with dilution buffer was assessed in triplicate in both
urine and vaginal swab samples at 2-8°C and 25°C for 0, 6.5, 24 and 25 hours. Negative clinical
matrix for each specimen type was inoculated with TV at a concentration of 2X LoD. The data
indicate that lysed samples diluted in dilution buffer are stable for up to 24 hours at 2-8°C and
25°C.
Controls:
The Solana® Trichomonas Assay contains an internal processing control that is included in the
lysis buffer tube. Quidel Molecular Trichomonas Control Set #M119 contains external positive
and negative controls. These controls are described as follows:
1. The internal control is used to detect HDA inhibitory specimens and to confirm the
integrity of assay reagents and the operation of the Solana instrument. The internal
control is included in the lysis tube and monitors the entire extraction, amplification and
detection process.
8

--- Page 9 ---
2. An external assay positive control is included in the Quidel Molecular Trichomonas
Control Set (M119). The external assay positive control contains intact, non-viable
trophozoites and is intended to monitor substantial reagent and instrument failure.
3. An external assay negative control is included in the Quidel Molecular Trichomonas
Control Set (M119). The external assay negative control is the same matrix as the
positive control but is trophozoite-free. This control is intended to detect reagent or
environment contamination or carry-over by either T. vaginalis DNA or amplicons.
d. Detection limit:
Two T. vaginalis strains, G3, which is metronidazole susceptible, and CDC888, which is
metronidazole resistant, were used to determine the analytical sensitivity of the Solana®
Trichomonas Assay. The strains were freshly grown and quantified using a hemocytomoter.
Serial dilutions of these two strains were made in negative clinical matrix for both the urine and
vaginal swab specimen types. Each dilution was tested in 20 replicates along with positive and
negative controls using 1 reagent lot. The LoD was determined to be the dilution at which greater
than 95% of the replicates tested positive. The LoD was then confirmed by testing 20 additional
replicates at the determined LoD dilution using 2 additional reagent lots.
In the vaginal swab matrix, the LoDs for the G3 and CDC888 strains were 102 trophozoite/mL
and 306 trophozoite/mL, respectively. In the urine matrix, the LoD for the G3 and CDC888
strains were 4 trophozoite/mL and 108 trophozoite/mL, respectively. This 27-fold difference in
LoD between the two strains in the urine matrix may be due to differences in the number of
repeated fragments that the assay targets in the genomes of these two strains.
e. Analytical specificity:
Inclusivity:
An inclusivity study was performed to test reactivity of the Solana® Trichomonas Assay with 20
TV reference strains and clinical isolates at a starting concentration of 2-3X LoD in each
negative clinical matrix (8 TV/mL for urine matrix, 306 TV/mL for vaginal swab matrix). Each
strain was tested in triplicate. Table 5 lists the TV strains and clinical isolates tested.

Cross Reactivity
A cross reactivity study was performed to determine the potential reactivity of the Solana®
Trichomonas Assay with a panel of 47 microorganisms (37 bacteria, 4 yeast, 4 viruses, 2
parasites) that included common flora of the female genitourinary tract, opportunistic organisms
and closely related organisms. Each microorganism was diluted in either vaginal swab or urine
negative clinical matrix to the desired concentration (106 or higher CFU/mL for bacteria and
yeast, 106 or higher copies/mL for DNA/RNA and 105 or higher TCID /mL for viruses) and
50
tested in triplicate. Table 6 lists the microorganisms tested in the cross reactivity panel.

Microbial Interference
The T. vaginalis strains G3 and CDC888 were inoculated in both vaginal swab and urine
negative clinical matrix at their respective 2X LoD concentrations in the presence of the 47
microorganisms tested in the cross reactivity study to determine if the presence of the
microorganisms interfered with the ability of the Solana® Trichomonas Assay to detect T.
vaginalis. Each microorganism was diluted in negative clinical matrix at a concentration of 106
or higher CFU/mL for bacteria and yeast, 106 or higher copies/mL for DNA/RNA and 105 or
higher TCID /mL for viruses and tested in triplicate in the presence of the two T. vaginalis
50
strains. No microbial interference was observed with the detection of each of the two T. vaginalis
strains in either the vaginal or urine matrices.
Interfering substances
Vaginal swab matrix: A study was conducted to determine whether a panel of 14 substances
potentially present in vaginal swab specimens would inhibit the detection of T. vaginalis. Each of
the potentially interfering substances was tested in triplicate in the presence or absence of two T.
vaginalis strains, G3 and CDC888, at their respective 2X LoD concentrations in negative vaginal
matrix. The potentially interfering substances and the concentrations that were tested are listed in
Table 7.

Carry-over/Cross Contamination
A carry-over/cross contamination study was performed to determine if the testing of high
positive samples had the potential to cross-contaminate negative samples being processed at the
same time during the Solana® Trichomonas Assay reaction. High positive samples containing
approximately 106 trophozoites/mL in negative clinical matrix were alternated with negative
samples (clinical matrix alone) and tested using the Solana® Trichomonas Assay. Two operators
tested a total of 50 positive and 50 negative samples in multiple runs. Each run tested 5 positive
and 5 negative samples in alternating order and included positive and negative controls. Upon
testing, 100% of the negative samples yielded negative results, indicating that no carry-over or
cross contamination occurred.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cutoff value for the Solana® Trichomonas Assay was determined based on specific
parameters of the amplification curve calculated from negative samples and contrived samples at
concentrations near the LoD. These parameters included the slope of the amplification curve for
samples near the LoD (“slope threshold”) and the time required to reach the slope threshold. The
cutoff was set based on the longest amount of time to obtain a positive amplification result.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
A multi-center clinical study was performed to evaluate the Solana® Trichomonas Assay using
1044 clinician-collected vaginal swab and urine specimens obtained from 501 asymptomatic and
543 symptomatic patients. The study was performed November 2015 through March 2016 at 4
locations in the United States.
Vaginal Swab Specimens:
For each subject, three vaginal swab specimens were collected using the BD BBL™
CultureSwab collection kit with liquid Stuart’s transport media, and one vaginal swab specimen
was collected using a collection kit from an FDA-cleared molecular device. The four clinician
collected vaginal swabs were used for reference and Solana testing. The first two swabs were
randomized and used for the reference method testing, which consisted of wet mount and
InPouch TV Culture. The third swab was used for testing the Solana® Trichomonas Assay. The
FDA-cleared molecular device collection swab was used for discordant testing. The specimen
was considered positive if either of the two reference methods returned a positive result.
Ten vaginal swab specimens generated invalid results upon initial testing with the Solana®
Trichomonas Assay (0.96%). Nine of these specimens generated valid results upon re-testing (6
negative and 3 positive), and one specimen generated a second invalid result (0.1%). Table 9
below shows the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive
value (NPV) of the Solana® Trichomonas Assay and the prevalence of T. vaginalis (by
asymptomatic, symptomatic clinician designations and combined) for the remaining 1043
subjects.

Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Specimens are identified by scanning a barcode or by manual entry.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
A vaginal swab is expressed into a swab lysis tube or a urine specimen is added to a urine
lysis tube. After heat lysis, 50 μl of lysed specimen is transferred to dilution tube, 50 μl of
which is then transferred to a reaction tube for automated amplification and detection.
See section I above for more information.
5. Calibration:
The end user is not required to calibrate the instrument. Automated calibration happens
by comparing between the measured magnitude of the optical signal of and an integrated
calibration standard and the expected magnitude of the optical signal.
