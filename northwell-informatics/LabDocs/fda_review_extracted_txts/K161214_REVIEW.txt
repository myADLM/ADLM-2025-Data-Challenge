K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
In Vitro Diagnostic Devices; Guidance for the Preparation of 510(k) Submission, HHS
Publication FDA 97-4224.
Premarket Submission and labeling Recommendations for Drugs of Abuse Screening Tests,
Draft Guidance, December 2, 2003.
L. Test Principle:
Wondfo Amphetamine Urine Tests, Wondfo Cocaine Urine Tests and Wondfo
Methamphetamine Urine Tests use a lateral flow, one step system for the qualitative
detection of d-Amphetamine, Benzoylecgonine or d-Methamphetamine in human urine. Each
assay uses a monoclonal antibody-dye conjugate against drugs with gold chloride and fixed
drug-protein conjugates and anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody in membranes.
When the absorb end is immersed into the urine specimen, the urine is absorbed into the
device by capillary action, mixes with the antibody-dye conjugate, and flows across the pre-
coated membrane. When sample drug levels are zero or below the target Cut-Off (the
detection sensitivity of the test), antibody-dye conjugate binds to the drug-protein conjugate
immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. This produces a colored Test line that,
regardless of its intensity, indicates a negative result.
When sample drug levels are at or above the target Cut-Off, the free drug in the sample binds
to the antibody-dye conjugate preventing the antibody-dye conjugate from binding to the
drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. This prevents the
development of a distinct colored band in the test region, indicating a potentially positive
result.
To serve as a procedure control, a colored line will appear at the Control Region (C), if the
test has been performed properly because of the antibody-dye conjugate binding to anti-
mouse IgG immobilized in the Control Region(C) of the device.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were carried out for Wondfo Amphetamine Urine Tests and
Wondfo Cocaine Urine Tests using samples with concentrations of -100% cut
off, -75% cut off, -50% cut off, -25% cut off, +25% cut off, +50% cut off , +75%
cut off and +100% cut off. These samples were prepared by spiking drug in
negative samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by GC/MS. All sample
aliquots were blindly labeled and randomized. For each concentration, tests were
performed by six operators in two runs per day for 25 days per device. The
results obtained are summarized in the following tables:

The Wondfo Methamphetamine Urine Test MET 500 (Cup, DipCard)
stability performance data are found in k122961. The manufacturer claims
that the devices are stable at 4-30 °C (39-86°F) for 18 months.
This device has internal process controls. A colored line appearing in the control
region confirms that sufficient sample volume and that the correct technique has been
used. Users are instructed that the test is invalid if a colored line failed to appear in
the control region. External control materials are not supplied with these devices;
however the labeling provides information on how to obtain quality control materials.

The Wondfo Methamphetamine Urine Test MET 500 (Cup, DipCard) interference
performance data are found in k122961.
Effect of Urine Specific Gravity and Urine pH:
To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine pH, urine samples for
Wondfo Amphetamine Urine Tests and Wondfo Cocaine Urine Tests, with 1.000 to
1.035 specific gravity (1.000, 1.003, 1.008, 1.014, 1.018, 1.020, 1.022, 1.025, 1.028,
1.030, 1.032, and 1.035) and urine samples with pH 4 to 9 (4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, and
9.0) were spiked with target drugs at 25% below and 25% above Cut-Off levels.
These samples were tested using three lots of each device. Results were all positive
for samples at and above +25% Cut-Off and all negative for samples at and below -
25% Cut-Off. There were no differences observed for the cup and dipcard test
formats and the sponsor claims that pH and specific gravity do not affect urine testing
results around each analyte cut-off.
The Wondfo Methamphetamine Urine Test MET 500 (Cup, DipCard) Urine Specific
Gravity and Urine pH performance data are found in k122961.
f. Assay cut-off:
Cutoff studies were performed for Wondfo Amphetamine Urine Tests and Wondfo
Cocaine Urine Tests using a combination of clinical and spiked samples for each
drug (n=150 per drug). The testing protocol was identical for each drug. 25 clinical
samples were collected for each drug. Concentrations of amphetamine and cocaine
in the samples were determined by GC/MS. An additional 125 drug free negative
samples were obtained for each drug and spiked with either amphetamine or
cocaine at -50% cutoff, -25% cutoff, cutoff, +25% cutoff, and +50 % cutoff. 30
samples were tested at each concentration for each drug in replicates of 30 using
three lots and 3 operators (n=270).

Consumer / lay person study:
A lay user study was performed by a total of 840 lay users at three intended user sites:
two hospitals and one drug addiction recovery center in P.R. China. The Wondfo
Amphetamine Urine Test devices were tested by 280 lay persons, the Wondfo
Cocaine Urine Test devices were tested by 280 lay persons and the Wondfo
Methamphetamine Urine Test devices were tested by 280 lay persons. The
participants had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age
from 21 to 63 years.
Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations; negative, +/-75%, +/-
50%, +/-25% of the cutoff by spiking drugs into drug free-pooled urine specimens.
The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample was
aliquoted into individual containers and blind-labeled. Each participant was provided
with the package insert, 1 blind labeled sample and a device (cup or dipcard). Lay-
users were also given surveys on the ease of understanding the package insert
instructions. All lay users indicated that the device instructions could be easily
followed. The lay user study was performed using English only labeling. A Flesch-
Kincaid reading analysis was performed on each package insert and the scores
revealed a reading Grade Level of 7. The results are summarized below:
