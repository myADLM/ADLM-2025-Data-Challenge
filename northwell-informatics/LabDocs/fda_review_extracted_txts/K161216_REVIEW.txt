2. Indication(s) for use:
The Immunalysis SEFRIA Fentanyl Urine Enzyme Immunoassay is an enzyme
immunoassay with a cutoff of 1.0 ng/mL. The assay is intended for use in laboratories for
the qualitative analysis of Fentanyl in human urine with automated clinical chemistry
analyzers. This assay is calibrated against Fentanyl. This in-vitro diagnostic device is for
prescription use only.
The Immunalysis SEFRIA Fentanyl Urine Enzyme Immunoassay provides only a
preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be
used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/ Mass
Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should
be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results
are used.
The Immunalysis Fentanyl Urine Calibrators are used as calibrators in the Immunalysis
SEFRIA Fentanyl Urine Enzyme Immunoassay for the qualitative determination of
Fentanyl in urine on automated clinical chemistry analyzers.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
For in vitro diagnostic use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The Beckman Coulter AU400e Chemistry Analyzer was used to generate the
performance data in this submission. Instruments must be capable of maintaining a
constant reaction temperature, pipetting samples and reagents, mixing reagents, timing
reactions accurately, and measuring enzyme rates precisely at 570nm.
I. Device Description:
The Immunalysis SEFRIA Fentanyl Urine Enzyme Immunoassay contains two reagents,
which are provided as ready-to-use:
· Antibody/Enzyme Donor (EA) – This reagent contains rabbit antibodies to fentanyl,
and a partial sequence to galactosidase in PIPES buffer with Sodium Azide as a
preservative.
· Substrate/Enzyme Acceptor (ED) – This reagent contains contain the complementary
sequence of β-galactosidase labeled with fentanyl in malic acid buffer with Sodium
Azide as a preservative.
All of the Immunalysis Fentanyl Urine Calibrators are sold as individual bottles and are
liquid and ready to use. The negative calibrator is a processed, drug-free synthetic urine
matrix with sodium azide as a preservative. Each calibrator (1, 2, and 4 ng/mL) contains a
2

L. Test Principle:
The SEFRIA technology is based on artificial fragments of the E. coli enzyme β-galactosidase. A
mutant enzyme, termed Enzyme Acceptor (EA), is created by deletion of 28 amino acids in the
amino-terminal region of the sequence for β-galactosidase. EA is inactive, but can combine
Enzyme Donors (ED’s), containing the deleted sequence, to form active β-galactosidase. This
process is termed complementation, and the active enzyme formed as a result can be measured
by hydrolysis of a chromogenic substrate such as chlorophenolred β-D-galactopyranoside
(CPRG). The ED peptides are attached to a derivative of fentanyl that does not interfere with the

formation of active β-galactosidase. However, when fentanyl antibodies bind to the ED-fentanyl
conjugate complementation is blocked, thus preventing the formation of active β-galactosidase.
The assay is based on the competition of fentanyl in a urine sample with the ED-fentanyl
conjugate for the fixed amount of antibody binding sites. In the absence of the free drug in the
sample, the antibody binds the ED-fentanyl conjugate, resulting in inhibition of enzyme
formation. As the fentanyl concentration in the sample increases, ED-fentanyl becomes available
for complementation, creating a dose response relationship between fentanyl concentration in the
urine and enzyme formation. The β- galactosidase activity is determined spectrophotometrically
at 570 nm by the conversion of CPRG (orange) to chlorophenol red (red) and galactose.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed precision studies for 20 days, 2 runs per day in duplicate
(N=80) on drug-free negative urine samples spiked with Fentanyl to concentrations of
±25%, ±50%, ±75%, and ±100% of the cutoff. Fentanyl concentrations in spiked
samples were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Results were analyzed on a Beckman
Coulter / Olympus AU400e Chemistry Analyzer. The data are summarized in the
following tables:

Value Assignment/Expected Values
The calibrators are prepared by spiking known concentrations of Fentanyl into a
negative calibrator matrix. Concentrations are confirmed by GC/MS or LC/MS/MS.
Stability
Real time, closed vial and on-board stability studies for calibrators were conducted.
Stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable,
and support that, when stored at 2 – 8 °C, calibrators are stable for one year. The
results support that, once opened, calibrators are stable for 60 days when stored at 2 –
8 °C.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity from structurally related compounds was evaluated by testing drug-
free urine samples spiked with these compounds. Each potential cross-reacting
compound was spiked and evaluated independently, and each spiked sample was
tested in singlicate. Compounds were tested at a high concentration, and if cross-
reactivity was observed, were diluted to identify the lowest concentration that
produced a positive result. These concentrations were used to determine the percent
cross-reactivity. The compounds and concentrations tested, and the approximate
cross-reactivity are provided in the table below.

f. Assay cut-off:
Analytical performance of the device around the claimed cutoff is described in the
precision section M.1.a. above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed using unaltered, clinical urine samples
obtained from clinical testing laboratories. A total of 80 samples were analyzed in
singlicate on a Beckman Coulter AU400e Chemistry Analyzer and the result was
compared to that obtained by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS).
The results of the assay performance compared to LC/MS are summarized below:
Fentanyl Concentration

Candidate Device 0.5-0.9 1.0-1.5
< 0.5 > 1.5
Result
≥50% ≥100%
<50% >150%
<100% ≤150%
POS 0 1* 9 31
NEG 30 9 0 0
*Discordant sample: One sample was determined as positive by the candidate device,
whereas this sample was determined to be negative by the confirmatory LC/MS
method (0.9 ng/mL).
The sponsor conducted a supplemental method comparison study, which included
twenty (20) subjects who were prescribed fentanyl and twenty (20) subjects who were
suspected fentanyl abuse users. The urine samples from all study subjects were
determined to be positive for fentanyl using the candidate device. Subject urine
concentrations, as determined by LC/MS, ranged from 1.0 to 367 ng/mL for the

prescription fentanyl users and from 0.12 to 385 ng/mL for the suspected fentanyl
abuse users. Two (2) of the twenty (20) subjects in the suspected fentanyl abuser sub-
population were determined as false positive*.
*Discordant samples:
The first sample was confirmed negative for fentanyl by LC/MS (fentanyl
concentration: 0.12 ng/mL). Further analysis identified despropionyl fentanyl at a
concentration consistent with a positive result for the candidate device, as
determined by their cross-reactivity study (despropionyl fentanyl concentration:
46.6 ng/mL)
The second sample was confirmed negative for fentanyl by LC/MS (fentanyl
concentration: 0.17 ng/mL). Further analysis identified acetyl fentanyl at a
concentration consistent with a positive result for the candidate device, as
determined by their cross-reactivity study (acetyl fentanyl concentration: 1.03
ng/mL)
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. This device is intended to be used with urine samples only.
