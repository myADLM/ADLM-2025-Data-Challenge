4. Special instrument requirements:
VITEK® 2 and VITEK®2 Compact Systems
I. Device Description:
The VITEK® 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the
doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).
Each VITEK® 2 test card contains 64 microwells. A control well containing only culture
medium is included on all cards, with the remaining wells containing premeasured amounts
of a specific antimicrobial agent in a culture medium base. A suspension of organisms from a
pure culture is prepared in a tube containing 0.45-0.5% sterile saline and standardized to a
McFarland 0.5 using the DensiCHEK Plus™. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills seals
and places the card into the incubator/reader; manual methods can also be used for the
inoculation of test cards for use in the VITEK 2 System. The VITEK 2 Compact has a
manual filling and sealing operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well
in the card over a defined period of time (up to 18 hours). At the completion of the
incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive
category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK®2 AST-Gram Negative Ceftriaxone has the following concentrations in the card:
0.12, 0.25, 1, 4 and 16µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in
µg/mL). The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 card is ≤ 0.25 - ≥64 µg/mL.

Systems
L. Test Principle:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection
using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics used in the systems use
visible light to directly measure organism growth. Transmittance optics are based on an
initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Periodic light
transmittance samplings of the same well measure organism growth by how much light is
prevented from going through the well. The VITEK 2 System monitors the growth of each
well in the card over a defined period of time. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16
hours for a “rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in some instances. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along
with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic on the card.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three sites using ten isolates of gram
negative bacilli that were consistent with the intended use. Isolates were tested in
triplicate over three days for a total of 270 data points. The isolates tested in the
reproducibility study included Enterobacter aerogenes (one isolate), E. coli (two
isolates), Klebsiella pneumoniae (four isolates), Serratia marcescens (two isolates)
and Citrobacter freundii (one isolate). Inocula were prepared both manually and
using automatic dilution for testing in the VITEK 2. Inocula were prepared manually
for testing in the VITEK 2 Compact. The modal MIC value was determined and the
reproducibility was calculated based on MIC values falling within ± 1 dilution of the
mode MIC value.
Using VITEK 2 automatic and manual dilution options, the best and worst case
results were 100%. All results were on scale.
Using VITEK 2 Compact and manual dilution, best and worst case reproducibility
was 98.15%. All results were on scale.
The reproducibility results were acceptable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Inoculum Density Check. The inoculum density was monitored using the
DensiCHEK Plus™ instrument. The DensiCHEK Plus™ was standardized weekly
with all results recorded and in expected range.
Purity Check: A purity check of all organisms was performed at the time of
VITEK2 card inoculation. Only results obtained with pure cultures were evaluated.
Growth Failure Rate: During the course of the study there were no growth failures
in the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative cards.
Quality Control Testing: The FDA recommended QC organisms (E. coli ATCC
25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) were tested using both the
VITEK 2 card and the reference method at each site. Both the automatic dilution and
manual dilution methods were used for the VITEK 2 and the manual dilution method
was used for the VITEK 2 Compact.
The expected range for E. coli ATCC 25922 with Ceftriaxone is 0.03 – 0.12 µg/mL.
Even though the Ceftriaxone concentrations included in the VITEK 2 AST-Gram
Negative card are 0.12, 0.5, 1, 4 and 16µg/mL, the reporting range is ≤0.25 - ≥64
µg/mL. Therefore, all results for the QC strain were off-scale for the VITEK 2 and
VITEK 2 Compact Systems as both VITEK systems report the lowest end of the scale
as ≤0.25 µg/mL (Table 2). However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 was
also tested to verify the performance of the device (Table 2) and all results were on-
scale. All VITEK results with this organism were acceptable as they were within the
expected range of 8-64 µg/mL.

Test inocula were standardized using the DensiCHEK Plus instrument. VITEK 2 AST
– Gram Negative cards were inoculated using automatic dilution (for reading on the
VITEK 2 instrument) or using a manual dilution method (for reading on the VITEK 2
instrument or on the VITEK 2 COMPACT instrument). Reference panels were
inoculated as outlined in the CLSI document M07-A10.
A total of 410 clinical isolates were evaluated at four sites with VITEK 2 AST –
Gram Negative cards inoculated by automatic dilution and interpreted using the
VITEK 2 instrument. The majority of isolates were fresh (343isolates, 83.6%); 67
isolates (16.3%) were stock isolates.
A total of 71challenge isolates were tested at two sites (one internal and one external
site). In response to a request from FDA, 31 additional challenge isolates were
evaluated internally for a total of 102 challenge isolates. Results from these additional
isolates are included in the challenge isolate results provided in Table 3. The
challenge set was tested with both card inoculation options (automatic and manual
dilution methods) on the VITEK 2 System and with the manual dilution on the
VITEK 2 COMPACT system. The performance is shown in Table 3.

Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the result of the
reference method and that of VITEK 2 test card within plus or minus one serial two-
fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on scale for both the
VITEK 2 test card and the reference method. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when
the interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the
interpretation of the VITEK 2 test card.
The overall performance using the VITEK 2 System and inoculated using the
automatic dilution method was acceptable, with an EA of 97.5% and CA of 99.0%,
and a minor discrepancy rate of 0.8% (4/512) and a major error discrepancy rate of
0.2% (1/458). There were no very major errors (Table 3).
Performance of Proteus vulgaris:
The performance of Proteus vulgaris did not meet the performance criteria for
Essential Agreement according to the AST Class II Special Controls Guidance

Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems. The AST results for
Ceftriaxone with Proteus vulgaris will be suppressed from reporting in the VITEK 2
system. This was addressed in the labeling by adding the following limitation in the
labeling:
“Perform an alternate method of testing prior to reporting results for the
following antibiotic/organism combination: Ceftriaxone/Proteus vulgaris”.
Evaluable Isolates:
A large percentage of the clinical and challenge isolates tested in the evaluation of
Ceftriaxone were either highly susceptible or highly resistant resulting in acceptable
overall EA. A total of 45 isolates were determined to have evaluable results. Of these
isolates, 35 were within essential agreement (EA) for a percent EA of evaluable
isolates of 77.8%. Based on the limited data with evaluable isolates, the following
footnote pertinent to Ceftriaxone is added in the labeling (Product Information
Manual):
“Due to an insufficient number of on-scale isolates available for comparative
testing, the performance of VITEK 2 Gram Negative Ceftriaxone is unknown for
isolates with MICs in the range of 1 to 4 μg/mL. If critical to patient care, isolates
with MICs of 1 to 4 μg/mL should be retested using another method”.
Resistant Organisms:
A total of 51 resistant organisms were identified out of 512 organisms tested (9.9%)
in the combined challenge and clinical study of Ceftriaxone for the VITEK 2 with
automatic dilution. However, the following organisms had no resistant isolates
available during the comparative study: Shigella species, Providencia rettgeri,
Salmonella species, and Shigella species. This was addressed by adding the following
limitation in the package insert:
“The ability of the AST card to detect resistance with the following
combination(s) is unknown because resistant strains were not available at the
time of comparative testing. Ceftriaxone: Shigella species, Providencia rettgeri,
Salmonella species, and Shigella species.”
Challenge Data-Manual Dilution:
The challenge set of 102 isolates evaluated using the VITEK 2 and inoculated using
the manual dilution method demonstrated an EA and CA of 96.1 % (Table 4). A total
of 24 isolates were determined to have evaluable results. Of these isolates, 20 were
within essential agreement (EA) for a percent EA of evaluable isolates of 83.3%.The
results were acceptable.
