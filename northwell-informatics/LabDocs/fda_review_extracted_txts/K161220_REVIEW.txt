H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The ARIES® Flu A/B & RSV Assay is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based qualitative
in vitro diagnostic test for the direct detection and differentiation of influenza A virus,
influenza B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal
swab (NPS) specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection
in conjunction with clinical and laboratory findings. The test is intended for use as an aid in
the differential diagnosis of Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV in humans and is not
intended to detect Influenza C.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus or RSV infection and should not be used as
the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions. Conversely, positive
results do not rule-out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent
detected may not be the definite cause of disease. The use of additional laboratory testing
(e.g. bacterial culture, immunofluorescence, X-ray findings) and clinical presentation must
be taken into consideration in order to obtain the final diagnosis of respiratory viral
infection.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2014-2015 and the
2015-2016 influenza seasons when influenza A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 pandemic were the
predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other Influenza A viruses are
emerging, performance characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture
should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and
culture specimens.
The ARIES® Flu A/B & RSV Assay is indicated for use with the ARIES® Systems.

Note: The ARIES System and ARIES M1 System are collectively referred to as the
ARIES Systems throughout this memo.
I. Device Description:
The ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based qualitative in
vitro diagnostic test system that consists of the ARIES Systems with its included software, an
assay-specific cassette, and an assay-specific protocol file. The ARIES Flu A/B & RSV
Assay cassette is a disposable, single-use cassette containing nucleic acid purification
reagents, internal sample process control, and an assay-specific master mix designed to
perform the designated assay on one sample. The ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay cassette is
used to directly detect and differentiate influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV) nucleic acid in NPS specimens from patients with signs and symptoms
of respiratory tract infection. The assay detects the matrix protein genes of influenza A and
influenza B viruses, the fusion gene of RSV, and a RNA Sample Processing Control.
The specimen is lysed and nucleic acid is extracted using the ARIES Systems. An extractable
sample processing control (SPC) target is present in the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV assay
cassette and is processed with the specimen. The Ct (threshold cycle) value of the SPC is
designed to verify proper specimen lysis and nucleic acid extraction, to identify PCR
inhibition if any, and verify proper function of the extraction system and the real-time PCR
instrument. The Tm (melting temperature) value of the SPC is used as a reference for
determining the target Tm.
The extracted nucleic acid and SPC are transferred via magnetic beads through the cassette to
the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay lyophilized PCR reagents in the PCR tube that contains
target-specific primer pairs labeled with distinct fluorophore labels. PCR amplification is
performed and assay fluorescence is monitored on the ARIES Systems. Incorporation of the
quencher-labeled nucleotide causes a decrease in assay fluorescence. Following
amplification, the reaction is slowly heated and fluorescence is monitored. The strands of the
amplification products will separate at a specific Tm that is indicated by an increase in
fluorescence. The instrument fluorescence output is analyzed and test results are determined
using the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay Protocol File. A printed results report is generated.

L. Test Principle:
Primary sample (NPS specimen in universal transport medium) is added directly to the
ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay cassette sample chamber. The cassette is then placed into an
ARIES magazine which can hold up to six cassettes. The magazine is inserted into an ARIES
instrument. A barcode on top of the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay cassette is automatically
scanned by the ARIES instrument, associating a preloaded ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay
Protocol File with the cassette. The ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay Protocol File contains the
necessary parameters to run the cassette, analyze data, and generate reports.
Once a run is started, the sample processing control (SPC) is automatically added to the
sample chamber of the cassette to control for sample lysis, recovery of extracted nucleic acid,

detection of inhibitory substances, and confirmation of PCR reagent integrity. Sample and
SPC lysis, as well as isolation and purification of nucleic acids, are automated within the
ARIES Systems and the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay cassette. Purified nucleic acids are
automatically transferred to the cassette’s PCR tube that contains the lyophilized Influenza
A/B & RSV Master Mix for the PCR amplification step. The lyophilized Influenza A/B &
RSV Master Mix contains four sets of primers: one primer set for the SPC target, and an
independent primer set for each pathogen.
The ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay chemistry is based on an expanded genetic alphabet
technology, consisting of synthetic DNA base pair 2'-deoxy-5-methyl-isocytidine (iC): 2'-
deoxyisoguanosine (iG). The isobases (iC and iG) pair specifically with each other and not
with natural nucleotides. In addition, isobases are efficiently incorporated during PCR.
During PCR amplification, a quencher-modified iGTP is incorporated by the polymerase
opposite an iC and a fluorophore reporter attached to a PCR primer. If the target is present
and is amplified, assay fluorescence decreases with every cycle as amplification product
accumulates. The decrease in assay fluorescence is monitored in real time using the ARIES
Systems. Following PCR, the amplification products are thermally denatured and assay
fluorescence is monitored. The strands of the amplification products are separated and assay
fluorescence increases, thus enabling determination of the Tm of the amplicon.
Quality Control
ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay Cassette contains a sample processing control, which is
processed with the sample and analyzed during the amplification reaction.
External controls should be used in accordance with local, state, federal accrediting
organizations, as applicable. For example, reference influenza A, influenza B and RSV
strains or well characterized influenza A, influenza B and RSV clinical isolates may be
used as positive controls; universal transport medium may be used as a negative control.
Interpretation of Results
The ARIES analysis software determines results for the sample and the SPC based on the
amplification cycle (Ct) value and the melting temperature (Tm) value provided in the Assay
Protocol File. All assay outcomes are described below.

Reproducibility
Reproducibility of the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay was evaluated by testing one lot
of ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay Cassettes on two ARIES Systems by two operators
at each of three clinical sites on five non-consecutive days.
The reproducibility panel was prepared containing a moderate positive (10x LoD),
low positive (3x LoD), and high negative (0.2x LoD) independently for one influenza
A (Influenza A/Hong Kong/8/68), one influenza B (Influenza B/Florida/04/06), one
RSV-A (RSV A2), and one RSV-B (RSV B WV/14617/85) virus. Virus strains were
formulated in a simulated nasal matrix (SNM) consisting of 50:50 dilution of pooled
negative clinical specimens in universal transport media. A true negative sample
consisted of only SNM. The reproducibility panel was prepared, blinded,
randomized, and shipped frozen to each of the testing sites. Each panel member was
tested in triplicate by each operator on each day of testing. The results of the
reproducibility study are shown in the following two tables.

cassettes. The test sample panel is the same as one described in the site-to-site
reproducibility study above. A minimum of nine replicates of each target
concentration were run three times for each cassette lot. The test results showed that
the reproducibility across three cassette lots met the acceptance criteria of ≥ 95% for
Moderate Positive, Low Positive and Negative Influenza A, Influenza B, RSV A, and
RSV B samples.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable; qualitative assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability:
Specimen Stability (Fresh vs. Frozen)
The specimen stability was determined with contrived fresh and frozen specimens
stored at either 2-8°C (fresh) or -65°C to -95°C (frozen) and tested with the ARIES
Flu A/B & RSV Assay. This was assessed by testing 60 replicates per single pathogen
target (influenza A/Hong Kong/8/68, influenza B/Florida/04/06, or RSV A2)
prepared at three test concentrations (30 low positive (2-3xLoD), 15 moderate
positive (10xLoD), and 15 high positive (100xLoD)) across different time points
extending up to 12 months. In addition to the 60 replicates for each target organism, 6
replicates of simulated nasal matrix were tested at each time point. Also, to address
the effect of repeated freeze/thaw cycles on the assay performance, all five time point
sample sets were initially frozen for one hour, thawed, and re-frozen prior to testing
frozen samples at each time point. Results to date show that specimens for the ARIES
Flu A/B & RSV Assay are stable for up to 7 days when stored at 2-8°C and up to 3
months when stored at -65° to -95°C.
Kit Stability
The real-time stability study was performed to evaluate the shelf life of ARIES Flu
A/B & RSV Assay cassettes. Stability was established by testing six replicates of
positive specimens and six replicates of negative specimens on three different lots of
ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay cassettes stored at two different temperatures: 4°C (2–
8°C) and room temperature (15–30°C) at 10 different time points extending up to 19
months. Results to date show that ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay cassettes can be
stable for up to 5 months when stored at either 4°C (2–8°C) or room temperature (15–
30°C).
Open Box Stability
An open box stability study was performed in order to evaluate performance of
ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay Cassettes after they were removed from their
13

--- Page 14 ---
individual pouches. Cassettes were removed from their pouches and placed on a
laboratory bench where they were exposed to ambient temperatures, humidity, and
light for up to ten hours. Testing was performed by one operator across three lots of
cassettes on four ARIES Systems. Results show that ARIES Flu A/B and RSV Assay
Cassettes are stable for up to 10 hours at room temperature after removal from the
cassette pouch.
Controls:
Process Control
The sample processing control is present inside each test cassette to control sample
lysis, nucleic acid extraction, and proper reagent, cassette, ARIES System, and assay
protocol performance. The SPC has a known Tm range and Ct range. Each time an
assay is run, the system measures the temperature and fluorescence intensity of the
SPC control to ensure the thermal and optical subsystems have remained in
calibration.
External Controls
External controls should be used in accordance with local, state, federal accrediting
organizations, as applicable. For example, reference influenza A, influenza B, and
RSV strains or well characterized influenza A, influenza B, and RSV clinical isolates
may be used as positive controls; universal transport medium may be used as a
negative control.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was established for the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay
using three influenza A, two influenza B, and two respiratory syncytial virus strains
diluted in a simulated nasal matrix. Preliminary LoD concentrations were determined
by performing a six-point, five-fold dilution series of each virus strain tested. At least
six replicates of each of the dilutions were tested to determine a preliminary LoD
using one lot of ARIES Flu A/B & RSV cassettes. The LoD was defined as the lowest
concentration that had a positivity rate of ≥ 95%.
The LoD concentrations determined in the preliminary study were confirmed by
testing 20 replicates of the same virus strain diluted to the preliminary LoD
concentrations. The final confirmed LoDs for each of the seven virus strains are
presented in the table below.

e. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity):
The analytical reactivity/inclusivity of the ARIES Flu A/B and RSV Assay was
evaluated against twenty-four influenza A strains, seven influenza B strains, and three
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) strains, which differ from those strains included in
the LoD study. Each strain was diluted in the simulated nasal matrix to a
concentration near the LoD (1x101 TCID /ml or CEID /ml) and tested in triplicate.
50 50
For five strains, additional testing at 1x102 TCID /ml or CEID /ml was required to
50 50
achieve 100% positivity. For two strains, additional testing at 1x103 TCID /ml or
50
CEID /ml was required to achieve 100% positivity. The study results are shown in

replicates of the same Parainfluenza type 1 strain were tested with all five replicates
yielding negative target results.
Microbial Interference
Microbial interference for the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay was assessed with the
32 potential cross reactive microorganisms. These bacterial and viral strains were
tested at the same concentrations as described in the cross-reactivity study above. The
potential interfering organisms were spiked into simulated nasal matrix containing
either one strain of influenza A/Hong Kong/8/68, influenza B/Florida/04/06, RSV
A2, or RSV B WV/14617/85 at a concentration of 3X LoD. All target strains added to
cross reacting organism samples were tested in triplicate on the ARIES System. The
results are summarized below.

a Measles + RSV A was tested with eight replicates total due to operator errors.
b Enterovirus 71 + RSV B positivity (3/3) represents the re-testing of freshly prepared target material.
c Initial testing of three replicates resulted in two out of three positive results; subsequent testing with
five replicates resulted in five out of five, or a total of seven out of eight positive results.
Under the conditions of this study, the results demonstrate that the ARIES Flu A/B
and RSV assay does not cross-react with any of the 32 common respiratory
microorganisms tested.
Competitive Interference/Co-infection
The study was designed to evaluate the ability of the ARIES Flu A/B and RSV assay
to detect influenza A, influenza B, RSV A, and RSV B in the presence of a co-
infection. Competitive interference can occur when one analyte is near the LoD and
an additional analyte is present at high concentration. Analytes were tested at high (>
1x105 TCID /ml) and low concentrations (1.5X LoD) using three replicates in
50
various combinations, excluding RSV A + RSV B due to the assay’s inability to
distinguish between RSV subtypes. The results for each analyte in combination with
another competitive analyte are shown in the table below.

a High concentration of influenza A had inhibitory effect on RSV A2 at a concentration lower than 3x LoD.
g. Interfering substances:
The potential inhibitory effect of non-microbial substances expected to be found in
nasopharyngeal swab specimens was evaluated. Three replicates of each of influenza
A/Hong Kong/8/68, influenza B/Florida/04/06, RSV A2, and RSV B WV/14617/85
strains were tested with the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay at concentrations of 3X
LoD with a clinically relevant concentration of each potentially interfering substance
spiked into the contrived sample; additionally, universal transport medium was spiked
with the same concentration of each substance and tested for assay interference. The
evaluated substances are listed in the table below with tested concentrations shown.

The results of the study demonstrate that all influenza A, influenza B, and RSV
samples were 100% positive in the presence of a non-microbial substance; all
negative sample results containing only the non-microbial substance were 100%
negative, with the exception of FluMist.
Positive influenza results obtained in a patient who received FluMist prior to sample
collection may be due to detection of the live attenuated influenza vaccine virus and
may mask a true positive result caused by an influenza infection. Additionally,

FluMist may interfere with RSV detection due to high concentration of vaccine virus
nucleic acid, causing a possible RSV false negative result. This is addressed in the
Analytical Performance section of the ARIES FLU A/B & RSV Product Insert and an
appropriate limitation is included in the labeling.
h. Carry-Over/Cross-Contamination:
Carry-over and Cross-Contamination for the ARIES Flu A/B and RSV Assay were
evaluated by testing 30 high concentration influenza A positive samples
(A/Victoria/361/2011, 1x 105.02 TCID /ml) in series alternating with 30 influenza A
50
negative samples (i.e., universal transport medium). The high positive samples were
run adjacent to negative samples across 10 consecutive runs on one ARIES System.
Under the conditions of this study, no evidence of carry-over or cross contamination
was observed in the ARIES System.
i. Assay cut-off:
For the ARIES Flu A/B and RSV Assay, each target (influenza A, Influenza B, RSV
and sample processing control) has its own Ct cut-off value, Tm window, and Tm
Peak Threshold, all of which are used to determine the assay result for the detection
target as positive or negative. These assay parameters were determined by analysis of
pre-clinical data derived from internal verification studies using the comparator assay
(an FDA-cleared multiplex molecular test for respiratory pathogens). The parameter
values are outlined below, and are hard-coded into the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay
Protocol File.
Assay Protocol File Parameters
Target Tm(°C) Ct (cycles)
Influenza A 81.4 - 85.6 ≤ 40.0
Influenza B 77.6 - 82.2 ≤ 40.5
RSV 74.4 -77.2 ≤ 41.0
SPC 75.8 - 81.4 ≤ 37.0
These assay protocol file parameter values were utilized in the determination of assay
performance in the multi-site clinical trial conducted for the ARIES Flu A/B and RSV
Assay.

A matrix equivalency study was performed to establish equivalency of a simulated
nasal matrix consisting of 50:50 dilution of pooled negative clinical specimens in
Copan universal transport medium versus a natural matrix (pooled negative clinical
specimens) when used in the ARIES Flu A/B and RSV Assay. Study samples were
prepared as a four-point, five-fold dilution series of representative Influenza A,
Influenza B, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus strains in both the simulated nasal
matrix and the pooled negative clinical matrix with the lowest dilution point targeting
3-5x LoD. Each concentration level for each viral target strain was tested in six
replicates for each matrix type for a total of 48 tests per virus strain. Additionally, six
replicates of the simulated nasal matrix and six replicates of the pooled negative
clinical matrix were tested without the introduction of virus strain materials. The
results of the study are shown in the tables below.

c. Fresh versus frozen equivalency:
Please refer to the “Specimen Stability (Fresh vs. Frozen)” of this document.
d. Swab comparison:
The nasopharyngeal swab equivalency study was performed to evaluate the
reproducibility of the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay using three representative
nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) types (flocked, rayon, and polyester) and two different
swab sizes (mini-tip and regular). All swab types and swab sizes were evaluated with
influenza A (A/Hong Kong/8/68), influenza B (B/Florida/04/06), and RSV (RSV A2)
viral cultures prepared as a three point, five-fold dilution series, transferred via select
swab type and size to Copan universal transport medium, and tested with the ARIES
Flu A/B & RSV assay. In addition to the viral cultures, a negative sample consisting
of UTM was also evaluated. Overall, all swab types and sizes performed as expected
generating 100% positivity for all evaluated target concentrations and 100%
negativity for negative replicates.

3. Clinical studies:
The clinical performance of the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay was evaluated using
nasopharyngeal swab specimens prospectively collected at four geographically diverse
locations representing intended use sites during the course of two influenza seasons
(2014-2015 and 2015-2016). For the 2014-2015 season, two U.S. sites and one Canadian
site participated in this study. For the 2015-2016 season, clinical specimens were
collected and tested at a total of four sites including one additional U.S. site.
A total of 2,504 subject specimens were collected in the prospective study. Of these,
twenty-five specimens were excluded in the study (12 specimens were not
nasopharyngeal swabs (e.g. BALs, nasal aspirates, throat swabs), seven specimens
generated No Call results using the reference method upon re-test and six specimens were
excluded based on the violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria or protocol deviation). The
demographic information of the study participants who provided the 2,479 eligible
specimens is presented below.

Of these 2,479 eligible specimens, 1,017 were collected during the 2014-2015 Flu season
while the remaining 1,462 specimens were collected during the 2015-2016 Flu season.
Out of the 2,479 clinical specimens, 2,458 (2458/2479; 99.2%) generated valid results
with ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay during initial testing. The overall invalid rate for the
first-attempt testing was 0.8% (21/2479).
The performance of the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay was compared to an FDA-cleared
multiplex molecular test for respiratory pathogens. Results are shown in three tables
below. Discordant samples were further analyzed by bi-directional sequencing using
analytically validated primers that targeted genomic regions distinct from the ARIES Flu
A/B & RSV Assay and subsequent results are documented in the footnotes.

Due to the low prevalence of influenza B observed during the study season, the sample
set was further supplemented with 40 banked (pre-selected) influenza B positive
specimens. The 40 influenza B positive specimens were tested with the ARIES Flu A/B
& RSV Assay along with 40 negative clinical specimens in a randomized, blinded
fashion. The results from the supplement specimens were analyzed separately from those
of the prospective data set. In this retrospective study, seventy-eight (78/80; 97.5%)
generated valid influenza B results on the first attempt. Upon repeat testing of two invalid
specimens, they yielded valid results. The clinical performance for detection of influenza
B in the retrospective study is summarized below.
