• Cefepime: Bordetella bronchiseptica
4. Special instrument requirements:
VITEK 2 Systems 7.01 (PC version) software for VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact
Systems
I. Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the
doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).
Each VITEK 2 test card contains 64 microwells. A control well containing only culture
medium is included on all cards, with the remaining wells containing premeasured amounts
of a specific antimicrobial agent in a culture medium base. A suspension of organism from a
pure culture is prepared in a tube containing 0.45-0.5% sterile saline and standardized to a
McFarland 0.5 using the DensiCHEK Plus. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals
and places the card into the incubator/reader; manual methods can also be used for the
inoculation of test cards for use in the VITEK 2 System. The VITEK 2 Compact has a
manual filling and sealing operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well
in the card over a defined period of time (up to 18 hours). At the completion of the
incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive
category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-GN Cefepime has the following concentrations in the card: 0.25, 1, 4, 16 and
32 µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL). The MIC result
reporting range for the card is ≤0.12 - ≥32 µg/mL.

That Grow Aerobically
• Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems
L. Test Principle:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection
using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics used in the systems use
visible light to directly measure organism growth. Transmittance optics are based on an
initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Periodic light
transmittance samplings of the same well measure organism growth by how much light is
prevented from going through the well. The VITEK 2 System monitors the growth of each
well in the card over a defined period of time. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16
hours for a “rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in some instances. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along
with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic on the card.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three sites using ten isolates of gram
negative bacilli that were consistent with the intended use. Isolates were tested in
triplicate over three days for a total of 270 data points. The isolates tested in the
reproducibility study included Klebsilla pneumoniae (three isolates), Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (two isolates), Enterobacter cloacae (two isolates), Serratia marcescens
(two isolates), and E. coli (one isolate). Inocula were prepared using both manual and
automatic dilution methods for testing in the VITEK 2. Inocula were prepared by the
manual testing method only in the VITEK 2 Compact. The mode MIC value was
determined and the reproducibility was calculated based on MIC values falling within
± 1 dilution of the mode MIC value.
Using VITEK 2 and automatic dilution, all results were on scale and the
reproducibility was 100%.
Using VITEK 2 and manual dilution, there was one off-scale result. Reproducibility
was at 99.6% for best an worst case scenarios.
Using VITEK 2 Compact and manual dilution, all results were on-scale and the
reproducibility was 100%
The reproducibility results were acceptable.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Inoculum Density Check: The inoculum density was monitored using the
DensiCHEK Plus™ instrument. The DensiCHEK Plus™ was standardized daily with
all results recorded and within expected range.
Purity Check: A purity check of all organisms was performed at the time of
VITEK2 card inoculation. Only results obtained with pure cultures were evaluated.
Growth Failure Rate: There were two isolates that failed to grow in the clinical
study. Complete test results were available for 822 isolates in a total of 824 clinical
isolates. The growth failure rate was 0.2% and was acceptable.
Quality Control Testing: The FDA recommended QC organisms (E. coli ATCC
25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) were tested using both the
VITEK 2 card and the reference method at each site. Both the automatic dilution and
manual dilution methods were used for the VITEK 2 and the manual dilution method
was used for the VITEK 2 Compact.
The expected range for E. coli ATCC 25922 with cefepime is 0.015 – 0.12 µg/mL.
Even though the cefepime concentrations included in the VITEK 2 AST-Gram
Negative card are 0.25, 1, 4, 16 and 32 µg/mL, the reporting range is ≤0.12 - ≥32
µg/mL. Therefore, all results for the QC strain E. coli ATCC 25922 were off scale for
the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems as both VITEK systems report the
lowest end of the scale as ≤0.12 µg/mL (Table 2). However, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa ATCC 27853 was tested where the expected range is 0.5- 4 µg/mL and all
results were on-scale. All results were within the expected range.

following concentrations of cefepime: 0.25, 1, 4, 16, and 32 µg/mL (equivalent
standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL) and the reporting range is
≤0.12 - ≥32 µg/mL (i.e. ≤0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and ≥32). The reference
panel contained two-fold serial dilutions with a range of 0.008 to 128 µg/mL. The
testing conditions for the reference method were:
• Medium: Mueller Hinton broth (Cation-Adjusted) with the
appropriate dilutions of antimicrobial solution added
• Inoculum: Direct colony suspension
• Incubation: 35 C; 16- 20 hours
Test inocula were standardize⁰d using the DensiCHEK Plus instrument. VITEK 2
AST – Gram Negative cards were inoculated using automatic dilution (for reading on
the VITEK 2 instrument) or using a manual dilution method (for reading on the
VITEK 2 instrument or on the VITEK 2 COMPACT instrument). Reference panels
were inoculated as outlined in the CLSI document M07-A10.
A total of 824 clinical isolates were evaluated at three external sites with VITEK 2
AST – Gram Negative cards inoculated by automatic dilution and interpreted using
the VITEK 2 instrument. There were two isolates that failed to grow (99.8% growth
rate). The majority of isolates were fresh (641 isolates, 78.0%); 181 isolates (22.0%)
were stock isolates. There were 531 Enterobacteriaceae and 291 Pseudomonas
aeruginosa isolates tested in the clinical studies.
A total of 100 challenge isolates (80 Enterobacteriaceae and 20 Pseudomonas
aeruginosa) were evaluated at one external site. The challenge set was tested with
both automatic dilution and manual dilution methods on the VITEK 2 System and
with the manual dilution method on the VITEK2 Compact System. The performance

that of VITEK 2 test card within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable
results are those that are on scale for both the VITEK 2 test card and the reference method. Category
Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the
interpretation of the VITEK 2 test card.
Enterobacteriaceae, ≤2 (S), 4-8 (I), ≥16 (R)
The performance of Enterobacteriaceae was acceptable at 96.6% EA, 98.0% CA,
major discrepancy rate of 0.2% (1/523), and very major discrepancy rate of 1.2%
(1/81).
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ≤8 (S), --, ≥16 (R)
i. Category Agreement
Major and very major discrepancies were observed when P. aeruginosa results
were analyzed separately. Of the 20 major discrepancies, 17 were within essential
agreement [i.e. VITEK 2: 16 (R), Reference: 8 (S)]. Of the four very major
discrepancies, three were within essential agreement [i.e. VITEK 2: 8 (S),
Reference: 16 (R)]. These 17 major and 3 very major discrepancies would have
been considered minor discrepancies if there was an “intermediate” interpretation
category for cefepime/P. aeruginosa.
Because of the lack of “intermediate” interpretation category, an adjustment was
made in the overall performance evaluation of the discrepancy (error) rates by
conducting an analysis to determine whether the MIC values for these isolates
were within essential agreement or not.
As a result of this analysis, the adjusted major discrepancy rate for P. aeruginosa
became 1.1% (3/268). The combined major discrepancy rate for
Enterobacteriacea and P. aeruginosa became 0.5% (4/791). Similarly, the
adjusted very major discrepancy rate for P. aeruginosa became 2.3% (1/43). The
combined very major discrepancy rate for Enterobacteriacea and P. aeruginosa
became 1.6% (2/124). These performance data are acceptable based on the criteria
outlined in the AST Special Controls guidance document.

† The acceptable number of discrepancies is 3 when 124 of resistant organisms are tested (Table 8, AST Special Controls
Guidance)
The original P. aeruginosa performance with 20 major and 4 very discrepancies
was mitigated by adding a limitation to address the need for repeat testing P.
aeruginosa by alternative methods when the VITEK 2 Systems MIC is 8μg/mL or
16μg/mL. The limitation is noted below:
Although within Essential Agreement, the lack of an intermediate category has
shown major and very major discrepancies when compared to the reference
method. Testing should be repeated using an alternative testing/reference method
prior to reporting results for the following antibiotic/organism:
• Cefepime: Pseudomonas aeruginosa when the VITEK 2 MIC is 8μg/mL or
16μg/mL
For implementation of the repeat testing limitation, bioMerieux indicated that
they will issue a customer communication requesting VITEK 2 uers to create a
BioART rule stating the limitation in the VITEK 2 System for Pseudomonas
aeruginosa when testing cefepime. Implementation of this BioART rule will
assure that alternative testing is performed in accordance with the above
limitation. The limitation will be included in the next software update release.
ii. Essential Agreement
The essential agreement for P. aeruginosa in the comparative studies was lower
than the acceptance criterion of 90% when analyzed separately. It was further
evaluated by trending as demonstrated in Table 4 below:

The EA for VITEK2 Cefepime with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 88.4%. The
trending of on-scale results demonstrated: 41.3% equivalent, 40.6% one doubling
dilution higher, and 6.9% one doubling dilution lower when compared to the
CLSI reference broth microdilution.
Challenge
The challenge set of 80 Enterobacteriaceae and 20 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates
were evaluated with both automatic dilution and manual dilution methods on the
VITEK 2 System and with the manual dilution method on the VITEK2 Compact
System. The performance is shown in Table 5.
