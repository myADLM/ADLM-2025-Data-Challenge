H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
CLUNGENE Amphetamine Tests are immunochromatographic assays for the qualitative
determination of d-Amphetamine in human urine at cut-off concentration of 1000 ng/mL.
The tests are available in a Cassette format, a Cup format, a Dip Card format, and a Split
Key Cup format.
The tests provide only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test
result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. The tests are intended for over-the-counter and for
prescription use.
CLUNGENE Cocaine Tests are immunochromatographic assays for the qualitative
determination of Cocaine in human urine at cut-off concentration of 300 ng/mL. The tests
are available in a Cassette format, a Cup format, a Dip Card format, and a Split Key Cup
format.
The tests provide only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test
result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. The tests are intended for over-the-counter and for
2

prescription use.
CLUNGENE Oxazepam Tests are immunochromatographic assays for the qualitative
determination of Oxazepam in human urine at cut-off concentration of 300 ng/mL. The
tests are available in a Cassette format, a Cup format, a Dip Card format, and a Split Key
Cup format.
The test may yield preliminary positive results even when prescription drug Oxazepam is
ingested, at prescribed doses; it is not intended to distinguish between prescription use or
abuse of this drug. There is no uniformly recognized cutoff concentration level for
Oxazepam in urine. The tests provide only preliminary test results. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result.
Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test
result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. The tests are intended for over-the-counter and for
prescription use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Over-The-Counter (OTC) use.
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable, as the device is a visually-read single use device
I. Device Description:
The CLUNGENE Amphetamine Tests, CLUNGENE Cocaine Tests, and CLUNGENE
Oxazepam Tests are immunochromatographic assays that use a lateral flow system for the
qualitative detection of d-Amphetamine, Cocaine and Oxazepam (target analytes) in human
urine. The tests are available in Cassette, Dip Card, Cup, and Split Key Cup formats. The
tests are the first step in a two-step process. The second step is to send the sample for
laboratory testing if preliminary positive results are obtained.

will not saturate the binding sites of antibody coated particles in the device. The antibody-
coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-specific conjugate and a colored
line will appear in the test line region. The colored line will not form if the sample contains
drug in excess of the cutoff level because the drug will saturate all the binding sites of the
drug-specific antibody. Each strip in the device contains a procedural control that appears in
the control line region indicating that the sample has migrated properly on the test strip.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision study samples were prepared from negative urine samples spiked to nine
different concentrations: +100%, +75% +50%, +25%, cut off, -25%, -50%, -75% and
-100% of the drug cutoff concentration for each drug. All sample concentrations
were confirmed by GC/MS. All aliquots for testing were blind labeled by the same
person who prepared the samples but who did not take part in sample testing. For
each combination of analyte and format, three operators read 50 results at each of the
nine concentrations, for a total of 1350 results per analyte per format. Results are
summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. These devices are for qualitative use only.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Procedural controls are included in the test strip and device. A colored line appearing
in the control zone is considered as an internal procedural control. It confirms
sufficient specimen volume, adequate membrane wicking and correct procedural
technique. Control standards are not supplied with these tests; however, it is
recommended that positive and negative controls be tested as a good laboratory
practice to confirm the test procedure and to verify proper test performance. Users
should follow local, state, and federal guidelines to run the external controls.
Device stability has been evaluated through accelerated and real-time studies. A
transport simulation study was performed to test extreme shipping temperatures.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The
manufacturer claims that the devices are stable at 4-30 °C for 24 months based on the
accelerated stability study at 45°C, real time stability determination at both 4°C and
30°C and transport simulation conditions at –20℃ and 40℃.
d. Detection limit:
See Precision/Reproducibility section in M.1.a above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity was evaluated by spiking the structurally similar compounds shown

To evaluate the effect of specific gravity, twelve drug free urine samples with specific
gravities ranging from 1.000-1.035 were spiked with each drug to ± 25% of the cutoff
values. Three lots of each device were used to test all samples.
To evaluate the effects of pH, a negative urine pool was aliquoted and the pH of each
aliquot was adjusted to 4.00 to 9.00, in increments of 1 pH unit. Three lots of each
device were used to test all samples. The aliquots were then spiked with
amphetamine, cocaine, or Oxazepam to concentrations 25% below and 25% above
the cutoff concentrations.
The pH and specific gravity ranges tested did not affect the results from the device.

f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration appears in the precision section, M.1.a., above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison samples consisted of 80 clinical samples (40 negative and 40
positive) for each drug. The samples were masked and randomized by a person who
prepared the samples and who didn’t take part in the sample testing. Operators were
blinded to the sample identity. Each sample concentration of the drug was confirmed
by GC-MS. The drug concentration ranges tested were as follows: drug-free, ≤ 50%
cut-off, -50% cut-off to cut-off, Cut-off to +50% cut-off, and ≥ 50% cut-off, for each
drug.
The above samples were tested using one lot of each format of the devices. Twelve
(three for each format) laboratory assistants performed the test following the
instructions for use. The obtained results were compared to the GC/MS results. The
results are summarized below:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
A consumer study was performed at three testing sites with a total of 1680 test
subjects, with diverse educational backgrounds representative of U.S. demographics.
A total of 140 users tested each format of each analyte. The study was performed by
spiking drug free urine sample pools with drug at concentrations of 0%, 25%, 50%,
75%, 125%, 150%, and 175% of each drug cutoff. Each participant received one
blinded sample, one test device format, and one English language package insert for
the device they were to test. The only instructions provided to users were the package
inserts for the device being tested. Participants ranged in age from 21 to greater than
50 years of age. None of the participants had experience using drug testing products
before.
Each person performed the test and filled out a questionnaire to evaluate the ease of
use of the device. All of the users correctly answered the questions on the
questionnaire and rated the clarity of the package insert as either “very clear” or
“clear”. The participant test results were compared to GC/MS results and are
summarized below.
