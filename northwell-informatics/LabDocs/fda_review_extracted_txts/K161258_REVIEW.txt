3. Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples (CLSI EP09-A3)
L. Test Principle:
Samples are diluted 1:20 in PBS and incubated with the antigen substrate (human neutrophil
granulocytes fixed on glass microscope slides). After incubation, unbound antibodies are
washed off. The substrate is then incubated with anti-human IgG-FITC conjugate. The
conjugate contains the DNA-binding blue fluorescent dye, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) that is required for NOVA View® Automated Fluorescence Microscope use. The
blue dye is not visible by traditional fluorescence microscope at the wavelength where FITC
fluorescence is viewed. Unbound reagent is washed off, and the slides are coverslipped.
Stained slides are read by manual fluorescence microscopy, or scanned with the NOVA View
Automated Fluorescence Microscope. The resulting digital images are reviewed and
interpreted from the computer monitor. ANCA positive samples exhibit an apple green
fluorescence corresponding to areas of the cell where autoantibody has bound.
Manual interpretation of NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Ethanol) Kit:
The two major patterns on ethanol-fixed substrate are cytoplasmic or C-ANCA, and
perinuclear or P-ANCA.
C-ANCA: C-ANCA samples present as coarse speckled cytoplasmic fluorescence, often with
accentuated staining between the nuclear lobes. This pattern is characteristic for antibodies
reacting with PR3.
P-ANCA: P-ANCA samples present as perinuclear staining with or without nuclear
extension. This pattern is usually characteristic for antibodies reacting with MPO.

Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) positive samples, primarily those containing anti-
DNA/histones, usually react with the nuclei of ethanol-fixed neutrophils, causing nuclear
staining, and may mask or mimic the P-ANCA pattern(s). Moreover, antibodies to other
granule antigens, such as elastase, BPI, cathepsin G, lactoferrin and others may also produce
a perinuclear staining on ethanol-fixed neutrophil substrate (sometimes referred to as
Atypical ANCA). Atypical ANCA and ANA usually become negative on formalin fixed
substrate.
Manual interpretation of NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Formalin) Kit:
On formalin fixed substrate, both MPO and PR3 antibodies appear as coarse cytoplasmic
granular staining with interlobular accentuation. Formalin fixation also destroys/modifies
most of the nuclear antigens, and as a result, ANA positive samples usually become negative,
or show greatly reduced fluorescence.
NOVA View® Automated Fluorescence Microscope interpretation of NOVA Lite DAPI
ANCA (Ethanol) Kit and NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Formalin) Kit:
When slides are analyzed by NOVA View® Automated Fluorescence Microscope, digital
images of representative fields of view of the well are captured. These digital images must be
reviewed and interpreted from the computer monitor by a trained operator. At the same time
when digital images are taken, NOVA View® Automated Fluorescence Microscope
measures the FITC light intensity of the cells that are included in the region. NOVA View®
Automated Fluorescence Microscope reports the measured fluorescence intensity in units of
Light Intensity Units (LIU). NOVA View® Automated Fluorescence Microscope provides
the trained operator with the acquired digital images and the following supportive
information:
• LIU value
• Suggested negative/positive classification
• Suggested pattern for NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Ethanol) Kit pattern nomenclature:
P P-ANCA
C C-ANCA
U Unrecognized
• Suggested pattern NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Formalin) Kit pattern nomenclature:

C Cytoplasmic
U Unrecognized
Software principle:
IFA fluorescence microscopy digital images are taken by a camera and stored on the
computer system. All images are taken through a DAPI and a FITC filter. FITC (fluorescein
isothiocyanate) is a green fluorescent dye that is chemically bound to the anti-human IgG
conjugate. DAPI (4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) is a blue fluorescent dye added to the

assay conjugate. DAPI strongly binds to DNA; therefore, it stains cell nuclei, regardless of
antibody and conjugate binding. The NOVA View® Automated Fluorescence Microscope
software is capable of storing and managing the digital images, including retrieving,
displaying on computer monitor, enlarging, and overlaying DAPI and FITC images. At the
same time when digital images are taken, the software measures FITC light intensity of the
cells that are included in the region, and reports the measured fluorescence intensity. An
assay specific software algorithm provides pattern recognition. The software includes a
Single Well Titer (SWT) application that estimates the endpoint titer (e.g., the highest
dilution that gives positive result) for wells with a positive reaction with Ethanol ANCA,
based on the obtained fluorescence intensity and pattern.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
Nomenclature used in the studies:
· All studies have been performed by interpreting the results with both manual
microscopy and with the NOVA View® Automated Fluorescence Microscope
system.
· “Manual” and “Manual reading” refers to results obtained by reading the slides with a
traditional fluorescence microscope.
· “NOVA View” refers to software reported results obtained with the NOVA View
Automated Fluorescence Microscope, such as LIU, positive/negative classification
and pattern information.
· “Digital”, “Digital reading” and “Digital image” refers to results obtained by reading
NOVA View® Automated Fluorescence Microscope generated images on the
computer monitor.
· Intensity of the staining is expressed in reactivity grades. Grade 0 is negative; grades
1–4 are weak to strong positive:
o 1+ Lowest specific fluorescence that enables the nuclear and/or cytoplasmic
staining to be clearly differentiated from the background fluorescence
o 2+ Clearly distinguishable positive fluorescence
o 3+ Bright apple green fluorescence
o 4+ Brilliant apple green fluorescence
For all studies presented here, all results met the sponsor’s pre-determined acceptance
criteria.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-Lab Precision:
To assess the precision performance of the NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Ethanol) and
ANCA (Formalin) Kit results, a study was performed by processing three negative
and 13 positive samples: seven anti-MPO and six anti-PR3 positive samples with
various ANCA intensities, in three replicates, in ten runs, two runs per day, resulting
7

in 30 data points for each sample. The slides were read with NOVA View®
Automated Fluorescence Microscope, and digital images were interpreted by one
operator. Additionally, slides were read with a manual microscope. Three set of
results were generated: NOVA View® Automated Fluorescence Microscope software
interpretation, digital image reading results and manual reading results.
Results: For both digital image reading and manual reading, grades were within ± one
reactivity grade within one run (within triplicates), and the average grade was no
more than one reactivity grade different between runs. Results are presented in the

Between-Operator Agreement:
Ten native clinical samples from patients with AAV and controls were selected to
include two negative, four P-ANCA positive, and four C-ANCA positive samples.
These samples were tested at each site for five days in five replicates (25 data points
per sample). Manual and digital reading was performed by two operators at each site.
Operator-to-operator reproducibility was assessed within each site and is presented
below as overall agreement.

It is known that ANA and other anti-cell antibodies may interfere with ANCA
detection by causing nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining. It is assumed that the main
cause of interference shown in the population above is the result of ANA in the
samples.

NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Ethanol) Kit:
Positive IIF results should be confirmed by antigen (MPO and PR3)-specific
solid phase assays.
ANA positive samples may react with the nuclei of ethanol-fixed neutrophils,
masking or mimicking ANCA.
Any report of positive neutrophil fluorescence issued before the ELISA results are
available should indicate that positive fluorescence alone is not specific for the
diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis
(MPA).
Decision about treatment should not be based solely on the ANCA results
NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Formalin) Kit:
Positive IIF results should be confirmed by antigen (MPO and PR3)-specific solid
phase assays5.
High-titer ANCA is suggestive of ANCA-associated vasculitis, but should not be
considered diagnostic by itself. The ANCA result should be considered in
combination with other serological results as well as the overall clinical history
including signs and symptoms of the patient.
ANCA Formalin is not intended to be used by itself, but together with ANCA Ethanol
test.
ANA positive samples may show weak nuclear fluorescence on formalin-fixed
neutrophil granulocytes.
ANA positive samples may show weak nuclear fluorescence on formalin fixed
neutrophil granulocytes.
Any report of positive neutrophil fluorescence issued before the ELISA results are
available should indicate that positive fluorescence alone is not specific for the
diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis
(MPA).
Decisions about treatment should not be based solely on the ANCA results.
f. Assay cut-off:

--- Page 21 ---
The assay cutoffs were established by testing 110 reference samples (n=90 healthy
subjects and n=20 samples from patients with infections) at a 1:20 dilution. These
were read by NOVA View® Automated Fluorescence Microscope and manually.
Manual results were used as the reference. Based on this study the established cutoffs
are 20 LIU for NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Ethanol) Kit and 30 LIU for NOVA Lite
DAPI ANCA (Formalin) Kit. The above cut-off values were verified on an
independent cohort, consisting of 89 samples from apparently healthy individuals. On
this cohort, there were 4 positive results with NOVA View® Automated
Fluorescence Microscopesoftware interpretation, eight with manual interpretation,
and four with digital interpretation with NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Ethanol) Kit, and
no positive results with any interpretation method with NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA
(Formalin) Kit.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison study included 267 samples comprised of MPO/PR3 positive
specimens and disease control groups. Qualitative agreement, pattern agreement and
grade agreement were calculated between NOVA View® Automated Fluorescence
Microscope software interpretation, manual reading and digital image reading, each
comparing the candidate device to the predicate device, at one internal site.

Automated Fluorescence Microscopemanual reading and digital interpretation was
established for each diagnostic group tested. The ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV)
classification group typically includes granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (formerly
Wegener’s granulomatosis), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (eGPA) (formerly Churg-Strauss syndrome). Where the
specific diagnosis was identified, results were presented for each condition as well as for

Conjugate comparison:
The NOVA Lite® DAPI ANCA Ethanol and Formalin Kits contain the same
conjugate as that of the predicate device, but with blue fluorescent dye DAPI (4',6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole) added. To adapt the assay for use on NOVA View®
Automated Fluorescence Microscope, the blue fluorescent dye DAPI (4',6-diamidino-
2-phenylindole) that binds strongly to A-T rich regions in DNA, was added to the
conjugate.
To demonstrate the equivalent performance of the conjugate with and without DAPI,
a comparison study has been performed on clinical samples.
Thirty-six individual serum samples have been tested (analytically characterized
serum samples and controls), in addition to a diluent blank, with FITC IgG Conjugate
(508113) and FITC IgG Conjugate with DAPI (508102), using NOVA Lite DAPI
ANCA (Ethanol) Kit and NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Formalin) Kit reagents. Two
sets of slides were stained: one with the conjugate without DAPI (the predicate

a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
To assess clinical performance, a clinical study was performed on 653 clinically or
analytically characterized serum samples. Fifty nine samples were analytically
characterized (anti-MPO/PR3 positive), and 89 were healthy controls (these samples
were excluded from the sensitivity and specificity calculations).
Additionally, 287 clinically or analytically characterized serum samples were tested
at a sponsor lab (Site#1) and at two external clinical sites (Site#2 and Site #3) with
both Ethanol and Formalin ANCA. The cohort contained 49 analytically
characterized samples that were excluded from the sensitivity and specificity
