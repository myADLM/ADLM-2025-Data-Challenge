L. Test Principle:
The BGM014/Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are electrochemical biosensors using a
glucose-dehydrogenase, (Aspergillus sp.), along with a redox mediator on a disposable test
strip (the electrochemical embedded sensor), and a handheld device to measure current
generated by test strip. The software in the hand held device converts the measured current
into glucose concentration, where generated current is directly proportional to glucose
concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
BGM014 and BGM014 Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems only differ in name and
intended use (single-patient use vs. multiple-patient use); therefore, performance data
provided in this section is applicable for both systems.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed within-run precision studies using venous blood from one
donor adjusted to 5 glucose levels (30-50 mg/dL, 51-110 mg/dL, 111-150 mg/dL,
151- 250 mg/dL and 251-400 mg/dL) tested on ten BSM014 meters with three lots of
strips. Within-run test was performed every day for 20 days. Each sample was tested
in 10 replicates per meter and per strip lot, giving a total of 200 measurements per lot
for a total of 600 measurements for each glucose level. Results are summarized
below:
Within-run precision:
Glucose Level Number of Mean SD CV
( mg/dL) readings (mg/dL) (mg/dL) (%)
30-50 600 40 3.0 7.5
51-110 600 70 3.0 4.3
111-150 600 122 3.8 3.1
151-250 600 221 6.6 3.0
251-400 600 331 6.7 2.0

51-110			600			70			3.0			4.3		
111-150			600			122			3.8			3.1

251-400			600			331			6.7			2.0		

--- Page 7 ---
Intermediate precision was evaluated using three levels of glucose control solutions,
Level 1, 2 and 3. Each glucose level was analyzed once per day on 10 meters using 3
lots of test strips over 20 days. Results for intermediate, between-day precision are
summarized below.
Intermediate precision- Between Run:
Glucose Level Mean SD CV
(mg/dL) (mg/dL) (mg/dL) (%)
Level 1 40 1.3 3.1
Level 2 121 1.6 1.3
Level 3 331 2.3 0.7
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed using venous whole blood samples. The evaluation
was conducted using eight different glucose concentrations according to the reference
(19.8 mg/dL, 50 mg/dL, 80 mg/dL, 110 mg/dL, 201 mg/dL, 306 mg/dL, 527 mg/dL,
613 mg/dL), YSI. Each sample was measured in replicates of 40 with 3 test strip lots
and ten BGM014 meters and the values compared to a laboratory reference method
(YSI 2300 analyzer). Results from the regression analysis:
Strip Lot Slope Y-Intercept 2
R
1 0.9927 0.0132 0.9993
2 1.0062 -1.2672 0.9996
3 1.0051 -1.8185 0.9996
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of
20 to 600 mg/dL. If a sample is less than 10 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter
as LO. If a sample result exceeds 600 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter as HI.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The BGM014/Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are traceable to NIST SRM
917c glucose.
Test strips stability:
Test strip stability was assessed for test strip vials and individually wrapped test strips
in real-time studies. Testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
found to be acceptable. The manufacture claims a shelf life stability of 24 months and
open vial stability (for the vials of test strips) of 6 months at the recommended
storage conditions of 4℃-30℃ (39.2°F -86°F) and 10-85% relative humidity.

Control Solution Stability and Value Assignment:
The stability and value assignment of the Contrex Plus 5 Control solutions were
assess in real-time studies. Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for the
glucose control solutions were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The
manufacturer claims a shelf life stability of 24 months and an open-vial stability of 3
months at the recommended storage temperatures of 39.2°F - 86°F (4°C to 30°C).
Value Assignment:
Value assignment on glucose control solutions is performed using 3 lots of Contrex
Plus 5 control solutions (for all 3 levels) using two BGM014 Blood Glucose
Monitoring systems daily for 10 days, with two tests/meter for each control solution,
for a total of 360 test results. Results were verified against values from the YSI-2300
reference method and using pre-determined acceptance criteria for glucose recovery
within a specified range for each control lot/level. The acceptable control range is
established using the mean value of each control solution level. Glucose control
ranges are lot dependent and are listed on the test strip vial label for each lot and
level.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range for the BGM014/Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems is 20-
600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity study (M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by adding endogenous and exogenous
substances, each at two or more levels (normal/therapeutic and high) to venous whole
blood samples containing two different glucose levels (70-90 and 300-330 mg/dL).
Each sample was measured in replicates of ten on the BGM014 glucose meter and the
% difference between the results obtained with the test samples was compared to
those obtained using the corresponding control sample (containing no added
interferent). The table below shows the highest levels tested at which no significant
interference compared to YSI 2300 analyzer (defined by the sponsor as ≤ +/- 10%)
was observed:

this line of product types:
Yes ____x____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip, palm
and forearm which can be applied directly to the test strip.
5. Calibration:
This system has an auto-coding feature; coding of the meter by the user is not necessary.
6. Quality Control:
Three levels of controls are available for use with this meter. The control solutions must
be purchased separately using the contact information provided in the user guide.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Sample volume study:
The sponsor performed a study to verify the test strip minimum sample volume
requirement (0.8 µL) and the test strip fill error (“Er” 3) function established for the
BGM014 Blood Glucose Meter. Blood samples were tested at 6 sample volumes: 0.6,
0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1µl and values obtained were compared to the reference, YSI values.
Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.8 µL and the error code for
insufficient sample volume.
2. Altitude Study:
To assess the effect of altitude, venous whole blood samples were adjusted to 5 glucose
concentrations: 50, 120, 220, 330 and 450 mg/dL and tested at sea level and 10,335 feet
above sea level using 10 meters and 3 test strip lots. Results were compared to YSI
reference values. The results demonstrate acceptable bias to YSI to support the claims in
the labeling that altitudes up to 10,335 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose
measurements from the BGM014 system.
3. Hematocrit Study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the BGM014 glucose
meter was evaluated using venous whole blood samples with hematocrit levels of 10, 20,
30, 35, 43, 50, 55, 60 and 70%, at glucose concentrations of 40, 60, 130, 300 and 500
mg/dL using 10 meters and 3 test strip lots. For each blood sample, individual glucose
readings taken on the BGM014 glucose meter were compared to YSI reference values to
calculate the bias. The results demonstrate acceptable bias for hematocrit levels between
14

10-70%.
4. Readability Assessment
The readability of the labeling (user manual, quick reference guide and test strip insert)
using Flesch-Kincaid’s analysis were found to be written not higher than 8th grade level.
5. Test System Operating Conditions:
The effect of temperature (41 - 113°F (5 - 45°C) and relative humidity (RH) (20– 90%)
on the BGM014 glucose meter was evaluated using venous blood samples at 60, 120, 200
and 400 mg/dL glucose. Twenty replicates were tested at each of the multiple
temperature and humidity combinations that included the extreme combinations (low
temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low
humidity, and high temperature/high humidity). Meter results were compared to YSI
values. The study results support the operating conditions claims in the labeling that the
system can be used in conditions of 41 - 113°F (5 - 45°C) with relative humidity of 20–
90% RH.
6. EMC Testing:
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing
(EMC) had been performed and the System was found to be compliant.
7. Infection Control Studies:
The device systems BGM014 and BGM014 Pro are intended for single-patient use only
and multi-patient use, respectively. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed by the
sponsor using each of the following disinfectants: Clorox Healthcare® Bleach
Germicidal and Disinfectant Wipes (EPA Registration Number: 67619-12), Dispatch
Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towel with Bleach (EPA Reg# 56392-8), Medline Micro-
Kill™ Bleach Germicidal Bleach Wipes (EPA Registration Number: 69687-1-37549),
Medline Micro-Kill+™ Disinfecting, Deodorizing, Cleaning Wipes with Alcohol (EPA
Registration Number: 59894-10). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor
demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of the meter
after 730 and 10,950 cleaning and disinfection cycles for single and multi-patient use,
respectively. The robustness studies support 3 years of single and multi-patient use.
The sponsor has included a warning in the label “These disinfectants were validated
separately. Only one disinfectant should be used on the device for the life of the device,
as the effect of using more than one disinfectant interchangeably has not been evaluated.”
Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and
disinfection procedures.
8. This device was cleared after the FDA issued final guidance documents for prescription
use blood glucose monitoring systems (BGMS) and over-the-counter use blood glucose
monitoring systems (SMBG). However, the recommendations in the guidance
documents were not followed for this device since the submission was received prior to
the finalization of the guidance documents.
