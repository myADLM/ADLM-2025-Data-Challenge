BACTEC fluorescent series instrument for incubation and periodic reading. Each vial
contains a chemical sensor which can detect increases in CO produced by the growth of
2
microorganisms. The sensor is monitored by the instrument every ten minutes for an
increase in its fluorescence, which is proportional to the amount of CO present. A positive
2
reading indicates the presumptive presence of viable microorganisms in the vial. Detection is
limited to microorganisms that will grow in a particular type of medium.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle:
The BD BACTEC Standard Anaerobic/F medium is an enriched soybean- casein digest
broth, with each vial containing 40 mL of broth. The formulation is specifically designed to
enhance the recovery of facultative and anaerobic microorganisms from blood. Sodium
polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) is added to the medium as an anticoagulant and compliment
fixation inhibitor.
Each BD BACTEC Standard Anaerobic/F blood culture medium vial contains a chemical
sensor in a silicon rubber base that can detect increases in CO produced by the growth of
2
microorganisms. Three to seven mL of blood is inoculated into the BD BACTEC Standard
Anaerobic/F blood culture medium vial, which is inserted into the BD BACTEC Fluorescent
Series instrument for incubation, agitation and periodic measurement. When microorganisms
are present in the blood sample, they metabolize nutrients in the culture medium, releasing
CO into the medium. A dye in the sensor reacts with the CO , modulating the amount of
2 2
light that is absorbed by the fluorescent material in the sensor. The instrument’s photo
detectors monitor the sensor every 10 minutes and measure the level of fluorescence, which
is proportional to the amount of CO present in the vial. Positivity of a vial is determined by
2
algorithms resident in the instrument rack’s microprocessor. The algorithms use the rate of
CO production as well as the absolute increase in CO to interpret the data.
2 2
Culture vials flagged as presumptively positive are removed from the instrument for
subculture and Gram stain in order to identify the microorganisms for further evaluation and
proposed patient treatment. Culture vials that are not flagged as positive remain in the
instrument until the test protocol has been completed and negative bottles are discarded at the
end of protocol (120 hours).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The BACTEC Standard Anaerobic/F (plastic) vial was evaluated across three lots in
the Time To Detection (TTD) and the Percent Recovery (Detection) studies.

Different lots of key raw materials were used to manufacture each lot of culture
media. The actual inoculum level of 0, 1, 2-10, and >10 CFU were used in the
analysis. The actual inoculum level was determined on the basis of growth observed
on non-selective agar plate. The inoculum of 0 CFU indicates that no growth was
observed on non-selective agar. However, growth can be observed in the vials due to
difference in inoculum volume required between agar and BACTEC vial and
sampling imprecision at this low inoculum level.The time to detection results are
presented in Table 2.

*CLSI recommended strain
B. fragilis was evaluated by testing eight replicates for each lot while the rest of the
QC isolates were evaluated by testing seven replicates each. All organisms were
detected <72 hours, with mean ranges from 7.6 hours (Clostridium histolyticum) to
24.8 hours (Staphylococcus aureus).
d. Detection limit:
Microbial Detection Limit (MDL, target inoculum level 0- 1, 1- 10 CFU/vial)
The microbial detection limit study was conducted to assess the capability of the
culture media to detect low numbers of organisms (expected target level of 0-1 and 1-
10 CFU/vial) when present in blood. The study included 13 organisms (six anaerobes
and seven facultative anaerobes) tested at two blood volumes (3 and 7 mL), each at
challenging target inoculum levels of 0-1and 1-10 CFU/vial across three lots with
BACTEC FX and BACTEC 9240:
13 org x 2 blood vol. x 2 inoculum vol. x 3 lots x 2 instrument types = 312
Resutls are provided in Table 4. The percent recovery, difference between predicate
and modified bottles with 95% two-sided bootstrap confidence intervals stratified by
organism are presented for all inoculum levels combined (Target 0-1, and 1-10 CFU
per vial).

The study showed the percent recovery for all organisms combined was 73.72% for
the plastic vial and 72.73% for the predicate glass vial. However, a statistically
significant difference of -29.17% was observed with Bacteroides vulgatus. This
difference can be explained by the finding that the actual inoculum for the target 0-1
CFU per vial was determined to be “zero” for nine of the twelve plastic vials. The
percent recovery was 100% for both the glass and plastic vials at actual inoculum of
2-10 CFU for Bacteroides vulgatus. The MDL study demonstrated that the modified
plastic device performed equivalently when compared to the predicate glass device at
low target inoculum levels.

Comparison results were acceptable. The comparisons were made using the following
parameters: time to detection, percent recovery, false negative rate, and false positive. For
statistical analysis, 95% two-sided bootstrap confidence intervals for differences were
used.
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Instrument Time to Detection (TTD) study
The TTD (in hours) was recorded as part of the combined Percent recovery and the
Microbial Detection Limit studies using the BD BACTEC FX and 9240 instruments at
three inoculum levels, across two blood volumes (3 mL and 7 mL) over three media lots.
The Percent Recovery study represented the standard inoculum of 10 to 100 CFU per vial
and the Microbial Detection Limit study represented the challenge inoculum levels of 0
to 1 and 1 to 10 CFU per vial.
The TTD data was also analyzed by target inoculum level, blood volume or lot numbers.
The results are shown in Tables 5-7.

*For all blood volumes and target inoculum levels combined
In addition, for all inoculum levels data combined, it was observed that the estimated
median for the modified plastic vial and the predicate glass vial was 17.91 hours and
19.30 hours respectively; the median TTD difference was -0.5 hours (95% CI, -0.584, -
0.417), favoring the modified plastic vial.
The TTD study demonstrated that the modified plastic device performed equivalently
when compared to the predicate glass device when stratified by target inoculum level,
blood volume or lot numbers.
Percent Recovery (Detection) Study
The percent recovery (detection) was evaluated in a study of 528 paired sets at the
standard inoculum level of 10 to 100 CFU/vial on four instruments across three lots using
a diverse set of microorganisms frequently isolated in blood.
22 org x 3 lots x 2 blood vol x 4 instruments= 528 paired sets
Of the 528 paired sets, 504 sets recovered 21 organisms in both the plastic vial and the
glass vial and 24 sets were negative by both vials. The study showed that the sodium
polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) sensitive Peptostreptococcus anaerobius at actual inoculum
level of 37 CFU/vial across blood volumes of 3 and 7 mL was not detected in either vials.
Percent recovery was 95.5%.
The performance of each organism at inculum of 10 to 100 CFU per vial is shown in
Table 8.

The percent recovery study demonstrated that the modified plastic vial performed
equivalently when compared to the predicate glass vial.
False Positive Rates (Instrument-positive, subculture-negative)
False positivity was assessed with vials inoculated with fresh human blood of 2, 4, 6, 8,
and 10 mL, but no organisms were added to the vials. There were a total of 240 pair sets
across three lots using BACTEC FX and BACTEC 9240 to be completed at the protocol
of 120 hours incubation.
40 vials x 3 lots x 2 instruments= 240 vials per device

No instrument false positive signals were detected. The modified device performed
equivalently when compared to the predicate device in the false positive study.
False Negative Rates (Instrument-negative, subculture-positive)
All inoculated paired sets (528 from the Recovery study + 312 from the Microbial
Detection Limit study =840) that were instrument negative at the end of protocol (120
hours) were subcultured onto appropriate culture media plates. This combined data set
was evaluated for the false negative rates. A false negative is a vial that was instrument-
negative at the end of protocol (120 hours) yet contains viable organisms upon
subculturing onto appropriate culture media. There were a total of 70 paired sets where
both the modified and the predicate devices were negative at 120 hours; there were 36
sets where the predicate device only detected (i.e., 36 plastic vials subcultured) and 39
vials where the new device detected (i.e., 39 glass vials subcultured).

blood was instrument negative subculture positive in the predicate glass vial. There were
no false negatives in the plastic vials. The study results demonstrated no significant
difference between the plastic vials and the glass vials.
Note that the SPS sensitive Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was both instrument and
subculture negative; therefore, it was not included in the false negative rates. However,
this information is noted in the limitation and performance characteristic sections of the
package insert:
Limitations:
Recovery of SPS Sensitive Organisms from Blood Samples
Peptostreptococcus anaerobius is SPS sensitive which may affect detection if an
insufficient amount of sample is inoculated into the vial.
Performance
Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (24 sets) was not detected in either BD BACTEC
Standard Anaerobic/F medium contained in a plastic vial or the BD BACTEC Standard
Anaerobic/F medium contained in a glass vial at actual inoculum level of 37 CFU/vial
with blood volumes of 3 and 7 mL. All paired replicates demonstrated no growth upon
terminal subculture.
BD BACTEC Instrument Compatibility Study
The BACTEC instrument compatibility study was evaluated from the Percent Recovery
study (i.e., 528 paired sets) dataset across four fluorescent- series instruments: BD
BACTEC FX, FX40, 9240, and 9050. The study included 3 and 7 mL of blood at
inoculum level of 10-100 CFU per vial. The BACTEC instrument compatibility study is
demonstrated in Table 11:
