B. Purpose for Submission:
The purpose of this submission is to extend the use of the previously cleared
INNOVANCE® D-dimer assay (K093626) for the exclusion of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
to the Sysmex CS-2100i.
In addition to the INNOVANCE® D-dimer assay for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism
(PE), the Sysmex CS-2100i was also cleared for the following assays: Prothrombin Time
(PT) seconds and PT INR with Dade® Innovin®, Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time
(APTT) with Dade® Actin® FSL, Fibrinogen (Fbg) with Dade® Thrombin Reagent, and
Antithrombin (AT) with INNOVANCE® Antithrombin in the premarket notification
K151259.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:

Quantitative coagulation test: INNOVANCE® D-Dimer with the following intended use:
For the quantitative determination of cross-linked fibrin degradation products (D-dimers) in
human plasma on Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics and Sysmex® Coagulation Systems. The
INNOVANCE® D-Dimer assay is intended for use in conjunction with a non-high clinical
pre-test probability (PTP) assessment model to exclude deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and
pulmonary embolism (PE).
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device (Instrument) Description:
The Sysmex CS-2100i is an automated blood coagulation instrument for in vitro

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
Applicable analytical performance studies using the INNOVANCE® D-Dimer assay on
the Sysmex CS-2100i are documented in K151259. The following studies were
performed and were not necessary to reproduce for this submission because the
performance remains unchanged: method comparison with predicate device, clinical cut-
off validation for pulmonary embolism (PE), precision/reproducibility, linearity,
detection limit, carryover, interfering substances, on-board stability for reagent and
control material, ambient temperature tolerance testing, expected values/reference range,
dilution options comparison, and normal mode vs. micro mode comparison.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
Clinical cut-off: Validation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
The INNOVANCE® D-Dimer assay was evaluated on the Sysmex CS-2100i
analyzer in a multi-center study at U.S. and foreign (European) sites to validate the
exclusion of a first event of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). These sites were
emergency or ambulatory departments.
All potentially eligible patients who were suspected of having a first event DVT were
evaluated using the Wells’ rules to estimate their pre-test probability (PTP), and then
categorized into likely or unlikely, or alternatively as high, intermediate or low PTP.
Patients with a high PTP score were excluded from enrollment. Patients with no or a
positive D-dimer result with the D-dimer assay used at each study center were

evaluated by imaging methods . Patients with a negative D-dimer result with the D-
dimer assay used at each study center underwent imaging at the physician’s
discretion.
All patients with a negative clinical diagnosis of DVT at presentation were followed
up after three months to evaluate potential development of DVT.
Specimens were collected prospectively from 1907 consecutive outpatients and stored
frozen. Of these 1907 patients, 368 were excluded from analysis based on the pre-
analytical and post-analytical exclusion criteria (including 213 patients reported to
have a previously documented or chronic DVT), resulting in a total of 1539 patients.
In addition, patients with unobtainable follow-up data were excluded from analysis
resulting in 1317 patients available for final analysis. The overall prevalence of DVT
in the 1317 patients was 6.1 % (80 of 1317) with 7.0 % in the U.S. patients and 4.7 %
in the European patients.
The specimens collected in clinical sites were tested with the INNOVANCE® D-
Dimer assay on the Sysmex CS-2100i analyzer and results were compared to a cut-off
value of 0.50 mg/L FEU. A D-dimer result <0.50 mg/L FEU was considered negative
and a D-dimer result ≥0.50 mg/L FEU was considered positive. Instrument-specific
sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value
(PPV) with lower bound (LCL) of a two-sided 95 % confidence interval were
calculated. Results obtained for each study population are detailed below:
