I. Device Description:
Each lot of George King Coumadin® Plasma is from a single human donor stabilized on
Coumadin® therapy for at least 6 weeks. The donor plasma is obtained via plasmapheresis
using 4.0% sodium citrate and frozen immediately after plasma collection at -70°C.
The INR value of the donor plasma is determined using the ACL TOP 500 with
RecombiPlastin 2G reagent and each plasma is then categorized into one of the three INR
levels of control material based on the testing results obtained using the following INR
calculation:
INR= [PT/MNPT]ISI
Level I: INR Control: 1.5 – 2.8
Level II: INR Control: 2.9 – 4.0
Level III: INR Control: > 4.0

a. Precision/Repeatability
A precision (repeatability) study was assessed in-house on three lots of George King
Coumadin® Plasma on the ACL TOP 500 and the test was performed with two runs
per day and two replicates per run for 20 days using a specific lot of RecombiPlasTin
2G according to the CLSI EP05-A3 guideline. Plasma was first thawed in a water
bath at 37ºC for 2–5 minutes prior to the test. The data for within-run, between-run,
between-day, and total precision of the International Normalized Ratio (INR) and
Prothrombin time (PT) were calculated for each lot and summarized in the table

on ACL TOP 500 coagulation analyzer using RecombinplasTin 2 G with five vials
per day over 4 days. The final dataset of each lot resulted in a total of 20
measurements per INR level. Standard deviation was used to determine the range of
INR values for each George King Coumadin® Plasma lot and the mean INR values
were assigned to each lot.

On Board stability:
For each INR level, three George King Coumadin® Plasma lots were tested to
determine on-board stability. The plasma was thawed in a water bath at 37ºC for 2–5
minutes. The thawed plasma was poured into labeled vials and kept on-board the
ACL TOP 500 analyzer for testing. The samples were tested in duplicate at time 0
(baseline) and 2, 4, 6 and 7 hour increments using a quantitative clottable
prothrombin time assay with RecombiPlastin 2G. INR values were calculated from
the PT values. The initial baseline (0 hour) INR was used as the comparison value
for acceptability.
Stability performance of each George King Coumadin® Plasma lot was assessed in
terms of percentage change over time and INR values for each level of George King
Coumadin® Plasma at each time point were within the acceptable range, supportive
of a 6-hour on-board stability claim.
Shelf-life stability
A 6-month real-time stability test was performed on the ACL TOP 500 coagulation
analyzer using one lot of George King Coumadin® Plasma per INR level were tested
at each testing interval (~30 days) for this study (using one vial of plasma from each
lot). The real-time stability study is ongoing with a 3-year study plan. Data was
collected at 0, 32, 62, 94, 121, 154, 188 days and day 0 data is used as the baseline
value for stability comparison.
Stability performance of each George King Coumadin® Plasma lot was assessed in
terms of percentage change over time and INR values for each level of George King
Coumadin® Plasma at each time point were within the acceptable range, supportive of
a 6-month real-time stability claim.
