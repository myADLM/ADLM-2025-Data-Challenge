510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
K161317
B. Purpose for Submission:
The purpose of this premarket notification is to extend the deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
exclusion claim with the cleared INNOVANCE® D-dimer (K093626) to the Sysmex® CS-
5100.
In addition to D-dimer, the Sysmex® CS-5100 also performs the following assays:
prothrombin time and internationalized ratio (PT/INR), activated partial thromboplastin time
(APTT), fibrinogen, and antithrombin. The performance for the abovementioned assays in
combination with the Sysmex® CS-5100 was evaluated in premarket notification K150678.
In the same premarket notification K150678, the use of INNOVANCE® D-dimer (K093626)
for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism (PE) was extended to the Sysmex® CS-5100.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Sysmex Corporation, Sysmex® CS-5100
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Quantitative D-dimer assay
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device (Instrument) Description:
The Sysmex® CS-5100 is a standalone automated blood coagulation analyzer which
analyzes citrated venous plasma collected in 3.2% sodium citrate anticoagulant. Results
are displayed on the Information Processing Unit (IPU) screen and can be printed on
external printers or transmitted to a host computer.
2. Principles of Operation:
The Sysmex® CS-5100 uses mechanical, hydraulic, and electrical systems to perform
analysis. The basic flow of analysis begins with sample presentation in the normal mode
or micro-sample mode. The instrument warms a specified quantity of sample for a
defined time period prior to the addition of reagents. The instrument utilizes the clotting,
chromogenic, and immunoassay methods of analysis. The clotting method determines
1

--- Page 2 ---
the clotting time using the percentage detection method for determination of prothrombin
time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and fibrinogen. The
chromogenic and immunoassay methods determine the change in light absorbance per
minute (doD/min). The instrument determines antithrombin using the chromogenic
method whereas D-dimer is quantitated using the immunoassay method.
3. Modes of Operation:
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes ____X____ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ________ or No ____X____
4. Specimen Identification:
Manual entry and barcode reader
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The CS-5100 supports two different analysis modes; normal mode for capped (closed)
and uncapped (open) sampling from collection tubes, and the micro-sample mode for
open (uncapped) sampling. In the normal mode, capped and uncapped samples may be
loaded into the same sample rack for analysis. Automatic reanalysis is also an exclusive
function of the normal mode. In the micro-sample mode, uncapped samples may be
loaded in the sampler or STAT holder.
6. Calibration:
Calibration is an automated function of the Sysmex® CS-5100 coagulation analyzer and was
performed for the D-dimer assay using the INNOVANCE® D-dimer calibrator, a
component of the INNOVANCE® D-dimer kit.
7. Quality Control:
Quality control was performed using INNOVANCE® D-dimer CONTROL 1 and
CONTROL 2 (K081732). The analyzer has two types of control assessment methods: X-
Bar and Levy-Jennings.
8. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and Software Development processes for
2

The Hazard Analysis and Software Development processes were reviewed in premarket
notification K150678. The technological characteristics cleared in K150678 remain
unchanged; therefore, additional software analysis was not required to support substantial
equivalence in this premarket notification.

1. Analytical Performance:
In premarket notification K150678 the following studies were performed with the
INNOVANCE® D-Dimer assay in combination with the Sysmex® CS-5100: method
comparison to the Sysmex® CA-1500, precision/reproducibility, linearity, carryover, and
interference studies. The established performance and technological characteristics
cleared in K150678 remain unchanged; therefore, additional performance studies were
not required to support substantial equivalence in this premarket notification.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Clinical Studies:
The objective of this premarket notification is to extend the DVT exclusion claim for
the cleared INNOVANCE® D-Dimer assay (K093626) to the Sysmex® CS-5100. In
K093626, the clinical cut-off for DVT was established using INNOVANCE® D-
Dimer in combination with the BCS® and BCS® XP Systems. Therefore, a clinical
cut-off study was performed to validate the clinical cut-off for the exclusion of DVT
using the INNOVANCE® D-Dimer assay in combination with the Sysmex® CS-5100.
The INNOVANCE® D-Dimer assay was evaluated on the Sysmex® CS-5100 System
in a multi-center study to validate exclusion of a first deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
event. The specimens were prospectively collected from 1,907 consecutive
outpatients presenting to the emergency or ambulatory department with suspected
DVT. Overall, samples were collected from a total of 23 sites; 17 in the United States
and 6 in Germany. The Wells’ score clinical pre-test probability (PTP) assessment
model was used to categorize patients as likely or unlikely for suspicion of DVT; or
alternatively as high, intermediate or at low PTP for suspected DVT. Patients with a
high or likely PTP score were excluded from the study.
Samples collected from patients with a low, intermediate or unlikely score were
tested with the INNOVANCE® D-Dimer assay and the results were compared to an
established cutoff value of 0.50 mg/L FEU. A D-dimer result ≥ 0.50 mg/L FEU was
considered positive; whereas a < 0.50 mg/L FEU D-dimer result was considered
negative. Patients with a positive D-dimer result were evaluated by imaging methods,
e.g. ultrasound.
Of the 1,907 patients, 368 were excluded from analysis; of which 213 had a reported
history of chronic DVT, and 155 were excluded on the basis of the defined exclusion
criteria (e.g. oral anticoagulation therapy, inpatient status, and pre- or post-analytical
variables). 222 patients with unobtainable follow-up data were excluded from the
study, for a total of 1,317 patients included in the data analysis.
The instrument-specific sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and
positive predictive value (PPV) with the lower bound of two-sided 95% confidence
intervals (LCL) were obtained with the INNOVANCE® D-Dimer clinical cut-off of
6

--- Page 7 ---
0.50 mg/L FEU. The overall prevalence of DVT in the 1,317 patients was 6.1 % (80
of 1,317) with 7.0 % (56 of 803) in the US population and 4.7 % (24 of 514) in the
European population.
