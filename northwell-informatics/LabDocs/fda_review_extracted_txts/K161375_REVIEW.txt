The Alere i RSV assay performed on the Alere i Instrument is a rapid, molecular, in vitro
diagnostic test utilizing an isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology for the
qualitative detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) viral RNA in direct
nasopharyngeal swabs and nasopharyngeal swabs eluted in viral transport media from
patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. It is intended for use as an aid
in the diagnosis of RSV in children <18 years and adults ˃60 years in conjunction with
clinical and epidemiological risk factors.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Prescription Use
4. Special instrument requirements:
To be used only with the Alere i Instrument
I. Device Description:
The Alere i RSV assay consists of a single-use Sample Receiver containing the elution
buffer, a single-use Test Base comprising two sealed reaction tubes, each containing a
lyophilized pellet, disposable Transfer Cartridge for transfer of the eluted sample to the Test
Base, the Alere i Instrument to process the sample and to record raw data, and embedded
software to analyze and interpret the data. The test also includes Alere i RSV positive and
negative external control swabs for quality control purposes. The controls are also available
separately as an accessory item. The Alere Universal Printer and Barcode Scanner are also
available as accessories.
To perform the assay, the Sample Receiver and the Test Base are inserted into the Alere i
Instrument and the elution buffer is automatically heated by the instrument. The sample is
added to the Sample Receiver and transferred via the Transfer Cartridge to the Test Base.
Resuspending the lyophilized pellet contained within the Test Base initiates the target
amplification. Heating, mixing, and detection by fluorescence are provided by the
2

--- Page 3 ---
instrument, with results automatically reported.
The test performs individual amplification reactions for RSV A and B within the Test Base
by targeting regions within the RNA genomes of the two viruses. The amplification target for
RSV A is the nonstructural protein gene 2 (NS2); the amplification target for RSV B is the
nucleocapsid gene (N). However, separate results for RSV A and RSB are not reported.
Alere i RSV technology is isothermal and does not require a heat denaturation step to
generate a single strand target for amplification. Instead a thermostable, strand-displacing
DNA polymerase, a thermostable nicking endonuclease, and two oligonucleotide templates
(primers) are utilized. Reverse transcriptase is also performed in the reaction. The products of
Alere i RSV amplification are two complementary oligonucleotides 30-40 nucleotides in
length. A product of this size is of sufficient length to be highly unique amongst genomes.
The exact length of the products depends on the specific placement of the templates relative
to one another and relative to their complementary sequences within the target genome.
The Alere i RSV test uses fluorescently-labeled molecular beacon probes for sensitive and
specific real-time detection. Results (positive, negative, or invalid) are displayed by the
Alere i Instrument. Results are also stored in an on-board archive and are assigned to a
sample ID that has been entered into the Alere i Instrument by the operator, and the date/time
the test was performed. Data can be retrieved and downloaded by the operator at any time
after testing. An external Alere Universal Printer can be attached via USB to the Alere i
Instrument to print test results.
Interpretation of results:
Alere i RSV consists of three fluorescence channels, ROX for the RSV A and RSV B
channels and FAM for the Internal Control (IC) channel. Their fluorescent processes
physically occur in two separate tubes: ROX for RSV A in Tube 1 while ROX for RSV B
and FAM for the Internal Control in Tube 2. The response curves are analyzed within a
decision algorithm to form an assay result. Results are reported to the end user as RSV
positive, negative or invalid.
Quality Control
Alere i RSV contains an internal control in the tube with the RSV B reagents. The control has
been designed to monitor functionality of the amplification/detection process and reagents.
This RNA oligonucleotide contains 5’ and 3’ ends that are complementary to the target
template set’s recognition regions but with a spacer region that differs from the target’s
spacer region. Detection of the IC occurs via a molecular beacon that specifically detects the
amplified product generated from the IC RNA oligonucleotide. In positive samples where
target amplification is strong, the internal control is ignored and the target amplification
serves as the ‘control’ to confirm that the clinical sample was not inhibitory and that assay
reagent performance was robust. At a low frequency, clinical samples can contain inhibitors
that may generate invalid results.
Procedural Control Valid displayed on the instrument screen indicates that the assay reagents
3

--- Page 4 ---
maintained their functional integrity and the sample did not significantly inhibit assay
performance.
Alere i RSV External Controls are designed for use with Alere i RSV. The Positive Control
swab is coated with inactivated RSV A and inactivated RSV B virus dried onto a swab. The
Negative Control swab is coated with inactivated Streptococcus Group C dried onto a swab.
External control swabs are provided with the Alere i RSV kit and are also available
separately.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility Study
A reproducibility study of Alere i RSV was conducted by operators from three sites using
panels of blind coded specimens containing negative, low positive (at the limit of
detection), and moderate positive (above the limit of detection) RSV A and RSV B
samples.
Participants tested multiple samples of each panel member on five different days. The
percent agreement with expected results for the RSV A moderate positive and low
positive samples were 100% (89/89) and 98.9% (89/90), respectfully. The percent
agreement with expected result for the RSV B moderate positive and low positive
samples were 98.9% (89/90) and 100% (90/90), respectfully. All of the true negative
samples (90) generated negative test results. There were no significant differences
observed within run (replicates tested by one operator), between run (five different days),
between sites (three sites), or between operators (nine operators).
The Reproducibility Study site-to-site qualitative results (agreements with expected
results) are presented in the table below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Specimen Stability
To provide data supporting the specimen storage recommendations stated in the product
package insert, an analytical study was carried out to evaluate specimen stability.
Contrived positive nasal swab samples were prepared using the RSV A (Strain A2) and
RSV B (Strain 9320) dilutions in pooled negative clinical matrix with targeted
concentrations near the respective limit of detection (LOD) levels. Mock negative nasal
swab samples were prepared using pooled clinical matrix. Swabs were prepared by
coating 10 μL of the virus dilution or clinical matrix onto the swab. Swab coating was
done by lightly scratching the swab surface with the pipette tip as the dilution was
pipetted to ensure liquid was absorbed into the swab tip. All prepared swabs were tested
at N=10 at each of the following three time points/conditions: For Direct Swabs, Time 0,
3 hours at 30 °C, 22 hours at 2-8 °C. Swabs tested after 22 hours at 2-8 °C were obtained
from the group of swabs stored for 3 hours at 30 °C for a total of 25 hours elapsed before
testing. For swabs eluted in VTM, 200 µL was tested according to the VTM assay
procedure at the following time points: 0, 9 hours at 30 °C, 16 hours at 2-8 °C, 48 hours
at 2-8 °C. Positive samples were considered stable as long as they tested positive in Alere
i RSV. Negative samples were considered stable as long as they generated negative
results in the test. Results of the Direct Swab and VTM stability studies are shown in the
tables below.

Swab direct method samples generated expected results for each sample type at each
storage time point.
VTM method samples generated expected results for each sample type at each storage
time point except at Time 0 for the clinical matrix diluent which generated one RSV false
positive result. This sample was not retested and all later testing generated expected
results. One RSV A VTM sample at Time 0 generated a positive signal in the RSV B
channel but does not affect the final answer provided by the Alere i RSV test.
The Product Insert states that NPS samples can be stored at room temperature for up to 2
hours. If the swab will be held longer than two hours, it must be refrigerated at 2-8°C and
tested within 24 hours from the time of sample collection. The Product Insert also states
that eluted swab samples (VTM) can be held at 15-30°C for up to 8 hours or at 2-8°C for
24 hours prior to testing with Alere i RSV.
Shelf Life
Alere performed a product stability study to generate stability data to support the expiry
assigned to Alere i RSV test kits and control swabs. The test components were tested at
specified time points using the RSV A & B Positive QC LOD Controls, and RSV
Positive Control Swabs as the positive samples. The QC LOD Controls are
approximately 3X the LOD when 50μl of a control is added to the sample receiver.
Elution Buffer, UTM, Negative Controls Swabs, and presumed negative nasal swabs
were tested as negative samples. The table below details the sample type and number of
replicates tested at each time point for each condition.

RSV B, or clinical matrix). Swab coating was done by lightly scratching the swab surface
with the pipette tip as the solution was pipetted to ensure liquid was absorbed into the
swab tip. All swabs were tested within 10 minutes of coating.
Swabs tested in this study include: Puritan Small Tapered Foam Tipped Swab; Puritan
PurFlock Ultra Flocked Swab – Mini-tip; Puritan HydraFlock Flocked Swab – Mini-tip;
Puritan HydraFlock Micro Ultra Fine Tip Flocked Swab; Copan Mini-tip Nylon Flocked
Swab; Copan Ultra Mini-tip (Pediatric) Nylon Flocked Swab; Copan Ultra-Thin Mini-tip
Nylon Flocked Swab; and BD CultureSwab Liquid Stuart with Foam Reservoir.
The BD CultureSwab Liquid Stuart Collection and Transport System includes a foam
media reservoir soaked with Liquid Stuart’s transport media. The inoculated swab was
inserted into the tube containing the Liquid Stuart’s Media soaked foam reservoir so that
the swab head made contact with the sponge. Swabs were tested immediately after
contacting the media soaked reservoir.
All of the swabs, except the Puritan PurFlock Ultra Flocked Swab – Mini-tip generated
the expected results for all ten replicates for each sample type. A precaution has been
added to the package insert warning the Puritan PurFlock Ultra Flocked Swab – Mini-tip
is not cleared for use with this assay. All other commonly used flocked swabs appear to
be acceptable.
Viral Transport Media Validation Study
Thirteen common transport media were tested in a VTM validation study to determine if
the particular media type is acceptable for use with VTM specimens in the Alere i RSV
assay. Presumed negative nasal swabs were eluted in 3 mL of each VTM type. Swabs
were eluted by swirling and mixing the swab for 10 seconds. For each VTM type, n=10
clinical matrix diluent (negative sample), RSV A and RSV B samples were tested at a
volume of 200 μL on the Alere i RSV test according to the VTM assay procedure.
Dilutions of RSV A and RSV B were prepared at a concentration approximately 3 times
the VTM limit of detection level in each VTM type clinical matrix diluent. A VTM was
considered acceptable if positive RSV samples generated positive RSV results on the
Alere i RSV assay and negative samples generated negative results. A summary of the
testing is shown in the table below.

Four RSV B samples generated positive results in the RSV A channel in the M4 media.
The positive signal in the RSV A channel does not change the outcome of the Alere i
RSV assay result and all ten replicates for the RSV B eluted in M4 media generated
positive signals in the RSV B channel.
d. Detection limit:
The objective of the Analytical Sensitivity Study was to identify the limit of detection
(LOD) of the Alere i RSV using characterized strains of RSV A and RSV B. For the
purposes of the study, the LOD level was defined as those concentration of RSV A
and RSV B that produced positive Alere i RSV test results approximately 95% of the
time when tested in multiple replicates.
The Swab Direct Method samples were tested on the Alere i RSV test according to
the swab direct assay procedure. VTM samples were each eluted into a separate vial
containing 3 mL of UTM. The two swab eluates were combined and mixed
thoroughly by gentle vortex. Each swab eluate was tested on the Alere i RSV test
according to the VTM assay procedure.
For both methods, if 100% positive results were obtained with the starting dilution, a
series of 2-fold dilutions beginning with the dilution that produced a positive result
was prepared. Two-fold dilutions were tested in triplicate until a negative result was
obtained. Then 20 replicates of the lowest 2-fold dilution that produced a positive
result were tested. If 95% positive results were obtained (19/20 positive) that dilution
level was reported as the LOD level.
If testing of 2-fold dilutions did not generate a 95% positive results, dilutions that
were half-way between the lowest 100% positive 2-fold dilution and the 2-fold
dilution below it were tested until a dilution testing 95% positive was determined.
LOD dilutions were stored at 2-8°C until conclusion of testing each day. These
dilutions were used to determine concentration in targets/mL via qPCR. The
empirically determined LOD for each specimen type and each RSV strain is shown in
the table below along with the corresponding genome equivalents/mL.

e. Analytical reactivity:
Various RSV A and RSV B strains were obtained from their respective vendors and
provided with a vendor designated titer in PFU/mL (RSV B1 did not have a titer and
is presented as dilution factors). Samples were prepared using several concentrations
of each of the quantified viable RSV A and B strains diluted in clinical matrix diluent.
A 1:100 dilution of each stock of virus was prepared for the starting concentration.
All strains were diluted per the dilution scheme described below until the lowest
dilution at which 3/3 replicates were positive was identified.
Dilutions of each virus were prepared in clinical matrix diluent and 10μL of each
dilution was dispensed on to sterile foam swabs. All viral dilutions were run in
triplicate on the Alere i RSV according to the swab direct assay procedure. The
lowest level of each strain that generated positive results on all replicates was
identified as the lowest level detected by Alere i RSV. If the initial testing
concentration was positive, the strain was diluted 10-fold and tested (n=3) until a
negative result was obtained.
When a negative result was obtained, two-fold dilutions were tested, starting at the
lowest positive dilution and tested in triplicate. A dilution level was considered
positive if all three replicates generated a positive result. At least one out of three
negative results was considered a negative result in the study.
The lowest detectable dilutions were stored frozen at -80 °C until conclusion of
testing each day. This dilution was used to determine concentration in targets/mL via
validated qPCR. A summary of the results of the reactivity testing is presented in the
table below.

microorganisms (21 bacteria, 18 viruses, and 1 yeast) that may be present in the nasal
cavity or nasopharynx were tested. All of the following microorganisms were

Swabs were prepared by coating 10μL of the virus dilution onto the swab. Swab
coating was done by lightly scratching the swab surface with the pipette tip as the
solution was pipetted to ensure liquid was absorbed into the swab tip.
A volume of 50μL of each interfering substance was dispensed into sterile tubes.
Blank swabs or RSV A or RSV B inoculated swabs were placed into each tube in
triplicate. Swabs were stirred to absorb all of the liquid into the swab head. Blank
swabs containing only the potentially interfering substance were tested to determine if

the substance causes false positive or invalid results in the assay. None of the
substances were found to affect test performance at the concentrations tested. False
negative results were observed when mucin was present at a concentration of 0.125%
w/v or greater and has been noted in the package insert Limitations section.
h. Microbial Interference:
Alere i RSV testing was performed in the presence of non-RSV respiratory
pathogens. Vendor provided stocks of RSV A and B strains were diluted in UTM to
approximately three times the limit of detection. Contrived RSV A and B positive
swab specimens were prepared by coating 10 microliters of virus dilution onto each
swab. Fifty microliters of each of the four potentially interfering viruses were
dispensed into sterile tubes.
One of the RSV A or RSV B inoculated swabs was placed into each tube (n=3 RSV
A and n=3 RSV B swabs total for each non-RSV virus). Swabs were stirred to absorb
all of the liquid into the swab head. Swabs were tested immediately as a swab direct
sample according to the Alere i RSV test procedure. A table of the potentially
interfering viruses and the concentrations tested is shown in the table below.

Adenovirus Type 1 1.58 x 107
Rhinovirus Type 1A 1.58 x 107
Influenza A 5.00 x 107
Influenza B 1.00 x 108
All co-infection swabs produced the expected outcome (RSV A or RSV B signal
detected) for all three replicates tested.
i. Carry-over:
To test for the possibility of cross-contamination between runs, a single dilution
containing both RSV A and RSV B was prepared in clinical matrix diluent using RSV
A and RSV B diluted to approximately 30 times each strain’s limit of detection level.
Swab direct samples were prepared by coating 10μL of the virus dilution onto the
swab. Swab coating was done by lightly scratching the swab surface with the pipette
tip as the solution was pipetted to ensure liquid was absorbed into the swab tip. VTM
method samples were tested on the Alere i RSV test according to the VTM assay
procedure.
Positive and negative swab samples were tested per the product instructions. Testing
between positive and negative samples alternated for a total of 15 rounds (15
positives and 15 negatives) on one Alere i instrument. All positive and negative daily
controls generated the expected results on each day of testing. A summary of the
results of the Direct Swab and VTM testing is shown in the table below.

All positive samples generated RSV A positive and RSV B positive signals. All
negative samples generated RSV A negative and RSV B negative signals.
j. Assay cut-off:
Alere i RSV consists of three fluorescence channels, ROX for the RSV A and RSV B
channels and FAM for the Internal Control (IC) channel. Their fluorescent processes
physically occur in two separate tubes: ROX for RSV A in Tube 1 while ROX for
RSV B and FAM for the Internal Control in Tube 2. The response curves are
analyzed within a decision algorithm to form an assay result. For each response
curve, the gradient values within the threshold window are compared to the gradient
threshold and the results of this comparison ultimately determine the channel result,
“Asserted”, “Not Asserted”, or “Indeterminate”. The gradient threshold (cut-off) in
the algorithm was derived through the RSV rehydration study and analysis of
retrospective culture of unknown clinical samples. The gradients of positive and
negative samples were analyzed. These thresholds were subsequently verified during
the clinical study performed during the 2015-2016 respiratory season.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable. Performance of Alere i RSV was evaluated against the reference method
in a prospective clinical study.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable.
3. Clinical Studies:
A multi-center study was conducted at nine study sites located throughout the U.S. during
the 2015-2016 respiratory season. Alere i RSV was used to evaluate fresh, prospectively
collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens from children <18 years and adults ≥60 years
with suspected respiratory infection and meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Samples
were tested with Alere i RSV within two hours of sample collection. At all sites, one
swab specimen was tested directly on Alere i RSV, according to product instructions for
testing swabs. The other swab was swirled in VTM for 10-20 seconds, the shaft cut-off,

and a sample of the VTM eluate tested with Alere i RSV. The remaining VTM containing
the residual swab was stored refrigerated and shipped to the central or local laboratory for
reference testing.
A total of 531 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were enrolled in the study. Of those, 25
specimens did not meet eligibility criteria. A total of 506 nasopharyngeal swab specimens
were considered evaluable. Of the 506 Subjects that met inclusion/exclusion criteria, five
samples returned invalid results after repeat testing via the reference method.
Additionally, four direct swab specimens returned invalid results on the Alere i RSV after
repeat testing leaving 497 Direct Swab and 501 VTM specimens evaluable for the
purpose of data analysis. Patient age and gender distribution for the evaluable specimens
is presented in the table below.

During the prospective clinical study, the initial invalid rate for direct nasopharyngeal
swab samples (before repeat testing per the product instructions) was 4.1% (21/506)
(95% CI: 2.7% to 6.3%). After repeat testing per the product instructions, the invalid rate
was 0.8% (4/506) (95% CI: 0.3% to 2.0%).
The initial invalid rate for nasopharyngeal swabs eluted in viral transport media was 2.2%
(11/506) (95% CI: 1.2% to 3.9%). After repeat testing per the product instructions, the
invalid rate was 0% (0/506) (95% CI: 0.0% to 0.8%).
Compared to an FDA-cleared molecular assay, the performance of the Alere i RSV for
direct NPS and NPS swabs eluted in VTM is presented below, respectively.

N. Instrument Name:
Alere i Instrument
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Alere i Instrument is a portable bench-top unit designed to perform in laboratory and
point-of care environments. Alere i RSV components are color-coded to match the
corresponding holder on the instrument and designed to only fit in the corresponding
holder in one direction. Once properly placed into the instrument, the Alere i Instrument
uses image analysis to automatically detect the presence of the Test Base and to check the
test type and expiry date on the barcode present on the Test Base. This triggers the test
sequence. Heating, mixing, and detection by fluorescence are provided by the instrument.
The Alere i Instrument is equipped with two optical fluorescence modules, FAM and
ROX. Each optical module consists of a LED excitation source and photodiode receiver
configured to the fluorescent channel. Fluorescence signals are optically filtered by a
confocal lens and mirror arrangement and processed by software running on an on-board
computer. The results are calculated automatically and presented on the instrument
graphical user interface and available for export in JSON format or printing.
