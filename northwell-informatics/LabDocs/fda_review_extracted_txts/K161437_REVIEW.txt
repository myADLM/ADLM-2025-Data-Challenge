The following limitations are included in the device labeling:
Due to an insufficient number of P. vulgaris on-scale isolates available for
comparative testing, the performance of VITEK2 Gram Negative Cefotaxime is
unknown for this species with MICs of 1 to 4 µg/mL. Isolates with MICs of 1 to
4 µg/mL should be tested with an alternate method.
Perform an alternate method of testing for the following antibiotic/organism
combination(s): Cefotaxime: Shigella sp.
4. Special instrument requirements:
VITEK® 2 and VITEK®2 Compact Systems
I. Device Description:
The VITEK® 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the
doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).
Each VITEK® 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient
medium is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of
antimicrobials combined with the nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a
standardized concentration with 0.45% to 0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the
antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK® 2 System will automatically dilute the
bacterial suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then the VITEK® 2
will fill, seal and place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK® 2 Compact has a
manual filling, sealing and loading operation. The VITEK® 2 Systems monitor the growth
of each well in the card over a defined period of time (up to 24 hours for Streptococcus
Species). The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based on
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the
minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the anti-microbial agent. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along
with the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 Gram Negative Cefotaxime has the following concentrations in the card: 0.5, 2, 4,
8 and 32 µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL). The
MIC result range for the VITEK 2 Cefotaxime is ≤ 0.25 - ≥ 64 µg/mL.

L. Test Principle:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection
using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics used in the systems
use visible light to directly measure organism growth. Transmittance optics are based on an
initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Periodic light
transmittance samplings of the same well measure organism growth by how much light is
prevented from going through the well. The VITEK 2 System monitors the growth of each
well in the card over a defined period of time. An interpretive call is made between 4 and
16 hours for a “rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in some instances. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along
with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic on the card.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three sites using ten isolates of gram-
negative bacilli that were consistent with the intended use. Isolates were tested in
triplicate over three days for a total of 270 data points. The isolates tested in the
reproducibility study included Enterobacter cloacae cloacae (one isolate), Serratia
marcescens (three isolates), Enterobacter aerogenes (one isolate), Citrobacter
freundii (one isolate), E. coli (two isolates) and Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumoniae
(two isolates). Inocula were prepared manually and using automatic dilution for

testing in the VITEK 2. Inocula were prepared manually for testing in the VITEK 2
Compact. The mode MIC value was determined and the reproducibility was
calculated based on MIC values falling within ± 1 dilution of the mode MIC value.
Using VITEK 2 and automatic dilution, 269 of 270 results were on scale. Best case
and worst case reproducibility was 99.63%.
Using VITEK 2 and manual dilution, all results were on scale and the
reproducibility was 100%.
Using VITEK 2 Compact and manual dilution, all results were on scale and the
reproducibility was 98.15%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
N/A
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Inoculum Density Check. The inoculum density was monitored using the
DensiCHEK Plus™ instrument. The DensiCHEK Plus™ was standardized weekly
with all results recorded and within the expected range.
Purity Check. A purity check of all organisms was performed at the time of
VITEK2 card inoculation. Only results obtained with pure cultures were evaluated.
Growth Failure. During the course of the study only one clinical isolate failed to
grow in the VITEK 2 Gram Negative Cefotaxime card. There were no growth
failures with the challenge isolates.
Quality Control Testing. The CLSI-recommended QC organisms E. coli ATCC
25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were evaluated using both the
VITEK 2 Cefotaxime card and the reference method at each site using both the
automatic dilution and the manual dilution for the VITEK 2 and using the manual
dilution method for the VITEK 2 Compact.
The expected range for E. coli ATCC 25922 with cefotaxime is 0.03 – 0.12 µg/mL.
The cefotaxime concentrations included in the VITEK 2 Cefotaxime card are 0.5, 2,
4, 8 and 32 µg/mL and the reporting range is ≤0.25 - ≥ 64 µg/mL. Therefore all
results with this QC strain were off scale for the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact
Systems and were reported as ≤ 0.25 µg/mL (Table 2). Even though P. aeruginosa
is not a claimed organism for the VITEK 2 Cefotaxime, the P. aeruginosa ATCC
27853 strain was also tested and provided on-scale MIC values and 100% of the
results were within the expected range (Table 2).

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Results obtained with the bioMérieux VITEK 2 AST - Gram Negative card with
cefotaxime were compared to results obtained with the CLSI frozen broth
microdilution reference panel. The VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card with
cefotaxime contains the following concentrations of cefotaxime: 0.5, 2, 4, 8 and 32
µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL) and the
reporting range is ≤0.25 - ≥ 64 µg/mL. The frozen reference panel contained two-
fold serial dilutions with a range of 0.015 to 256 µg/mL.
Test inocula were standardized using the DensiCHEK Plus instrument. VITEK 2
AST – Gram Negative cards were inoculated using automatic dilution (for reading
on the VITEK 2 instrument) or using a manual dilution method (for reading on the
VITEK 2 instrument or on the VITEK 2 COMPACT instrument). Reference panels
were inoculated as outlined in the CLSI document M07-A9.
A total of 521 Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates were evaluated at four sites with
VITEK 2 AST – Gram Negative cards inoculated by automatic dilution and
interpreted using the VITEK 2 instrument. The majority of isolates were fresh (430
isolates, 82.5%); 91 isolates (17.5%) were stock isolates.
A total of 110 challenge isolates were tested at two sites. The challenge set was
tested with both card inoculation options (automatic dilution and manual dilution)
on the VITEK 2 System and with the manual dilution on the VITEK 2 COMPACT
system.
For MICs interpreted using the VITEK 2 System and inoculated using the automatic
dilution method, the combined results from clinical and challenge testing
demonstrated a combined EA of 97.5% and CA of 97.8% (Table 3). A total of 83
isolates were determined to have evaluable results; the EA of the evaluable results
was 86.7%. One clinical and one challenge isolate of S. marcescens were
determined to be resistant by the reference method, but susceptible by VITEK 2,
major errors; the sponsor included the following footnote to the performance table
9

--- Page 10 ---
in the device labeling:
“Overall error rates were acceptable; however two susceptible isolates of
Serratia marcescens gave resistant results with VITEK 2 Cefotaxime, resulting
in major errors.”
Two clinical isolates (one E. cloacae isolate and one P. mirabilis) were determined
to be resistant by the reference method but susceptible by VITEK2, very major
errors; analysis of trending showed that compared to the broth microdilution
reference method, MICs for VITEK2 Cefotaxime tended to be at least one doubling
dilution lower and may be responsible for the occurrence of the very major errors.
A footnote to the performance table states:
Compared to the reference broth microdilution, results for Enterobacteriaceae
and tended to be one dilution lower and may be responsible for very major
errors with Proteus sp. and Enterobacter sp.
For Proteus vulgaris, there wer no resistant isolates and no isolates with on-scale
MIC values evaluated. The sponsor included the following limitation in the device
labeling:
Due to an insufficient number of P. vulgaris on-scale isolates available for
comparative testing, the performance of VITEK2 Gram Negative Cefotaxime is
unknown for this species with MICs of 1 to 4 µg/mL. Isolates with MICs of 1 to
4 µg/mL should be tested with an alternate method.
In addition, an insufficient number of Shigella species were evaluated; all Shigella
isolates had MICs ≤ 0.12 µg/mL. The sponsor removed the claim for Shigella sp.
and included the following limitation in the device labeling:
Limitation:
Perform an alternate method of testing for the following antibiotic/organism
combination(s): Cefotaxime: Shigella spp.”
The performance based on clinical and challenge isolates was acceptable.

Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the result of the reference
method and that of VITEK 2 test card within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the
antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on scale for both the VITEK 2 test card and the
reference method. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the
reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the VITEK 2 test card.
Challenge isolates interpreted using the VITEK 2 and inoculated using the manual
dilution method demonstrated an EA of 99.1% and a CA of 96.4% (Table 4). A
total of 19 isolates were determined to have evaluable results; the EA of the
evaluable results was 100.0%. There were no major or very major errors.

Trending. An analysis of trending of MIC values for all Enterobacteriaceae and
Acinetobacter sp. indicated that compared to the broth microdilution reference
method, MICs for VITEK2 Cefotaxime tended to be at least one doubling dilution
lower. This trending calculation takes into account MIC values that are determined to be ≤
1 or ≥ 1 doubling dilution compared to the reference method irrespective whether the
device MIC values are on-scale or not. The sponsor added the following footnote to the
performance table in the device labeling:
Compared to the reference broth microdilution, results for Enterobacteriaceae
tended to be one dilution lower and may be responsible for very major errors
with Proteus sp. and Enterobacter sp.
