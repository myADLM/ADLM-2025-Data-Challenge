L. Test Principle:
The YO™ Home Sperm Test utilizes Smartphone Apps developed for the iPhone 5 and
Galaxy 3 for the qualitative measure of motile sperm concentration (MSC) in human semen
samples. The test measures MSC to be in the LOW MSC RANGE or
MODERATE/NORMAL MSC range based on the cut-off of 6 million per milliliter (6M/mL)
motile sperm. If the MSC is < 6M/mL the result is considered to be in the LOW MSC
RANGE and if the MSC is ≥ 6 M/mL the result is considered as MODERATE/NORMAL
MSC RANGE. The YO test system software recommends seeking follow-up with medical
professional when the YO Home Sperm Test reports results in the LOW MSC RANGE.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was conducted at two testing sites. Testing was performed using 67
fresh semen samples collected in-house at MES site and testing 76 fresh semen samples
collected at a second site (Ruppin College). The collected semen samples were divided
into three groups: positive (MSC < 4 M/mL); close to cut-off (borderline, MSC 4 M/mL
to 8 M/mL), and negative (MSC > 8 M/mL). The three groupings were based on MSC
values strictly from the YO Home Sperm Test system. The samples were tested in
duplicate by four operators using two phones of each type (iPhone 5 and Galaxy 3), four
lots of Clips and four lots of slides with total of 480 measurements per site. The study is
presented in the table below:

The data demonstrated 3 M/mL MSC as the limit of detection (2 times lower than 6
M/mL cut-off) and 0 for the limit of blank. The results for the sample with the MSC
level close to the cut-off (5.6 MSC M/mL) were reported to be 62.5% for results in
the LOW MSC RANGE and 37.5% for results at the NORMAL/MODERATE MSC
RANGE.
e. Analytical specificity:
Intereference testing was conducted with the potential contaminants listed in the
below table. Each of the interfering substances were tested with three semen samples
in the LOW MSC RANGE and three semen samples in the MODERATE/NORMAL
MSC RANGE that were compared against neat semen samples at the LOW and
MODERATE/NORMAL MSC RANGE. Results from the study show there was no
interference from the listed interferents in table below except the hormone, D-
norgestrel. Study results showed that D-norgestrel lowered the motile sperm
concentration (MSC) and is indicated as an interefering hormone in the device
labeling.

f. Assay cut-off:
The MSC assay cut-off was assessed using 100 fresh clinical semen samples
consisting of MSC values approximately 50/50 above and below the 6M/mL MSC
cut-off. These samples included 10% of contrived samples to supplement samples
close to the cut-off. The study was conducted with two smartphone types (one
iPhone 5 and one Galaxy 3) compared to the predicate device, SQA-V using four Clip
lots and four slide lots of YO Home Sperm Test kit. The testing was completed in
parallel within two minutes of each other on the SQA-V and YO™ to reduce the
impact on the sampling time. A summary of the MSC cut-off study results are

7

--- Page 8 ---
was performed at three clinical sites, one in Israel and two in the U.S. The study
enrolled and tested a total of 316 semen samples collected from: male subjects with
no known fertility issues, a partner in a couple having difficulity conceiving,
diagnosed with male factor infertility, and post-vasectomy patients or post-vasectomy
reversal patients. After the test subject collected the semen samples, either the
subject and/or the tester analyzed the collected sample with the YO™ Home Sperm
Test kit using only the instructions provided in the kit. A separate study of YO™
Home tests using the same ejaculate, phone type and lot of YO™ test materials were
tested by a trained health care professional (HCP) and by two SQA-V systems. This
study design was utilized to compare YO™ results obtained by:
• Home users versus a trained healthcare professional
• Home users versus a predicate/reference method, SQA-V
• Trained healthcare professional versus a predicate/reference method, SQA-V
The results from the study are presented in percent positive agreement (PPA) and
negative percent agreement (NPA) for LOW MSC RANGE (MSC < 6M/mL) and
MODERATE/NORMAL MSC RANGE (MSC ≥ 6M/mL). The overall results from
all three sites combined are shown in the tables below:
The table below is provided to show the PPA and NPA by phone type between

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The home users are to collect their semen samples in the collection cup provided in the
YO™ Home Sperm Test kit. After collecting the sample, the liquefying powder that
contains chymotrypsin with eosin is added into the cup. Then the sample containing the
liquefying reagent is mixed with using gentle circular rotation for 10–15 seconds. After
mixing, the sample is to rest for 12 minutes before running the test. It is recommended
that users allow 2 to 7 days without ejaculating before collecting their semen sample.
The sample can sit for up to one hour. Condoms and lubricants should not be used when
collecting a semen sample. Proctective power free non-latex gloves are recommended
for anyone other then the subject testing his own specimen. Hands should be washed
with soap and water before and after handling the semen sample or any component of the
test kit.
5. Calibration:
The calibration curve was established by assaying 152 semen samples using four
smartphones (two of each type, iPhone 5 and Galaxy 3) and two SQA-V reference
systems.
6. Quality Control:
The YO system is equipped with a built-in software electronic check to detect
misalignment of the clip and slide. The built-in electronic check is also able to detect that
an empty slide not filled with liquefied seminal fluid.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Disinfection study: MES Ltd., selected the EPA registered (Registration # 70627-60)
Oxivir TB wipes with 0.5% hydrogen peroxide manufactured by Diversey, Inc as the
disinfectant of choice for the YO Home Sperm Test system. The disinfection study was
conducted at the Accuratus Lab Services in Eagan, MN. The reports from this
disinfection study utilizing Duck Hepatitis B Virus as a Surrogate Virus for Human
Hepatitis B Virus were provided in this 510(k) submission.
The study concluded Oxivir TB wipes (Lot 15107VX01), a ready to use pre-saturated
towelette demonstrated complete inactivation of duck Hepatitis B virus following a one
minute exposure time at room temperature (21.0°C) under the conditions of the
investigation and in presence of a 5% fetal bovine serum organic soil for all replicates
(three lots) of the coupon material surfaces of: iPhone 5 (front, back and button), Galaxy
3 (front, back, and button) and YO™ Clip.

Disinfection Robustness Study: To assess robustness from cleaning and disinfection
with Oxivir TB wipes, a simulated a cleaning and disinfecting protocol as would be
utilized by home users was conducted to observe signs of thin silver streaks, cracking,
swelling, dissolving, softening or brittleness of the phone case, display and buttons on the
smartphone and YO™ Clip. The study was conducted on each of the smartphone types
(iPhone 5 and Galaxy 3) and YO Clip by disinfecting 20 times using the recommended
disinfecting towelettes (Oxivir Wipes) during the process of testing 20 semen samples.
The study tested 10 “LOW” and 10 “Moderate/Normal” MSC samples compared to the
reference method, SQA-V. The study produced ≥ 90% PPA and ≥ 90% NPA between
YO™ Home Test kit and SQA-V for the disinfection and cleaning protocol and 100%
material compatibility for the robustness study with the Oxivir TB wipes.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
