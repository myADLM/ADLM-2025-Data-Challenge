L. Test Principle:
The Atellica™ CH Creatinine_2 (Crea_2) assay is used to measure the creatinine
concentration in human serum, plasma (lithium heparin), and urine using the Atellica™ CH
Analyzer. The technique used is based on modified kinetic Jaffe technique with rate blanking
and intercept correction. In the presence of a strong base such as sodium hydroxide, picrate
reacts with creatinine to form a red chromophore. The rate of complex formation is
measured at 505/571 nm and is proportional to the creatinine concentration in the sample.
Rate blanking is used to reduce interference.

A linearity study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP06-A. Samples were
prepared by mixing high and low concentration samples to span the measurement
interval; 12 samples were used to evaluate the entire measuring interval for serum and
10 samples were used to evaluate the entire measuring interval for urine. Five
replicates were tested for each sample and the mean of these replicates was used for
the calculation. The concentrations for serum samples ranged from 0.09 - 32.58 ng/dL
and the concentrations for urine samples ranged from 0.20 - 278.43 mg/dL.

The regression statistics of the serum linearity study:
Y = 1.004x + 0.085, r = 1.000
The regression statistics of the urine linearity study:
Y = 0.986x + 0.049, r = 0.999
The results of the linearity studies support the claimed measuring intervals for 0.15-
30.00 mg/dL for serum and plasma specimens and 3.00-245.00 mg/dL for urine
samples for the Atellica CH Creatinine_2 (Crea_2) assay on the Atellica™ CH
Analyzer.
Validation of the automatic dilution function has been performed and the extended
reportable range for serum is determined to be 60 mg/dl for serum and 735 mg/dL in
urine. Both sample types have been shown to be accurately diluted (manually or by
auto-dilution) in this range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Atellica CH Chemistry Calibrator (CHEM CAL) is traceable to NIST SRM 914
via value assignment (see below).
Additionally 49 serum samples were tested across the assay range were tested on
Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry (IDMS) to demonstrate standardization of the
assay.
Specimen Comparison N R Regression Sample Range
type Assay (x) Equation
Serum IDMS 49 0.999 y=0.96x + 0.05 0.41 – 32.09 mg/dL
Manufacturing and value assignment for the calibrator:
The calibrator is manufactured with a bovine serum albumin base. Assigned lot-
specific calibrator values used for the ADVIA Chemistry Calibrator will be utilized
for the calibration of Atellica CH Creatinine_2 assay on the Atellica CH Analyzer.
The target assigned value range is 7.6 to 9.6 mg/dL. A master lot is created and
values are assigned on an ADVIA Chemistry system calibrated with NIST SRM 914;
the master lot is used to assign the values of the commercial lots. The % recovery of
the commercial lot is compared to the % recovery of the Master Lot and the
previously released lot. The % recovery error limit is ±5%. The imprecision limit is
2.0% CV.
Stability: All studies were completed in accordance with CLSI EP25-A, Evaluation
of Stability of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents.

Reagent Stability:
The 12 month shelf claim was established by an accelerated stability study. A real
time stability study to support a claim of 12 months shelf life is ongoing. Unopened
product is stable until the expiration date on the product stored at 15-250C. All
protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable.
An open bottle stability study was conducted to ensure the reagent performed
consistently throughout the claimed in use/onboard stability. The study results
support the claim of on-board stability of 17 days at 15-250C. All protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
Calibrator Stability:
The shelf life of the unopened vial of calibrator is 24 months when stored at 2-80C.
Open vial/onboard calibrator is stable for 48 hours at 2-80C. All protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable.
Calibration Interval:
The calibration interval was evaluated in studies completed in accordance with CLSI
EP25-A. The study completed confirmed the calibration interval of 60 days. The
protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) and the Limit of
Quantitation(LoQ) of the Atellica CH Creatinine_2 (Crea_2) on the Atellica CH
Analyzer were evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2. A brief protocol

LoD is 0.51 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The evaluation of potential interferents followed the recommendations in CLSI EP7-A2.
Interference studies were performed for the creatinine measurement function by evaluating
potential interfering substances using a “paired difference worst case scenario” approach,
where interfering compounds were spiked at low or high levels into fresh serum or urine
sample pools. Bias was defined as the difference in results between the control samples
(without the interferent) and the test sample (containing the interferent) expressed in
percent; results with a bias exceeding 10% was considered interference. Dilution studies
were conducted to determine the level at which the spiked substance no longer displayed
significant interference.
No significant interference was detected for these endogenous substances at the following

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed following the recommendations in CLSI
EP09-A3. A total of 143 serum samples and 109 urine samples were tested on the
predicate device and on the candidate device, Atellica CH Creatinine_2 (Crea_2)
assay on the Atellica CH Analyzer. Samples tested in the study included 10 spiked
serum samples and 10 diluted urine samples to cover the lower end of the claimed
assay ranges of 0.15-30 mg/dL (serum) and 3.00-245.00 mg/dL (urine). One replicate
of each sample was tested on both test systems, and used in the analysis. Three of the
serum samples were excluded from the analysis because they were below the
predicate’s measuring interval. Weighted Deming statistics were used to calculate the
regression equation below:
Serum: y = 0.98x + 0.0 r = 0.999
Urine: y = 0.95x + 0.07 r = 0.999
b. Matrix comparison:
A total of fifty eight serum and lithium heparin plasma samples were tested on the
Atellica CH Creatinine_2 (Crea_2) assay on the Atellica CH Analyzer. Seven
samples were spiked with creatinine to cover the upper end of the claimed measuring
range. One replicate of each sample was tested and used in the analysis.
The table below summarizes the weighted Deming linear regression statistics of the
matrix comparison study

a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Transference as defined in CLSI EP28-A3c was used to validate established reference
ranges for serum and plasma creatinine. The sponsor performed a study to verify that
the reference ranges, provided in literature and cited in the labeling, could be
transferred to the candidate device. The study demonstrated that the published
reference ranges could be transferred.

Published 24 hour urine reference intervals are recommended because of difficulty in
obtaining 24 hr. urine samples. Siemens recommends that each laboratory should
come up with their own reference intervals for the diagnostic evaluation of the
patients results.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
