L. Test Principle:
Ceruloplasmin in the specimen reacts with rabbit anti-human ceruloplasmin antibody to form
immune complexes in solution. The formed insoluble complexes scatter light in proportion
to their size, shape and concentration. The amount of transmitted light is indirectly
proportional to the concentration of ceruloplasmin in the specimen. Ceruloplasmin
concentrations are automatically calculated by reference to a calibration curve stored within
the instrument.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance: The results presented below were within the sponsor’s pre-
determined acceptance criteria for each study.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision: The precision of the ceruloplasmin assay was evaluated on six pooled
human serum samples containing various concentrations of ceruloplasmin. Each
sample was run in duplicate, two runs per day, for 20 days (n = 80) by multiple
operators using one lot of reagent on one AU5800 analyzer. Data were analyzed for
within run, between run, between day and total precision. The results are summarized
in the table below.

Lot-to-lot Reproducibility: To evaluate lot-to-lot reproducibility, three samples with
ceruloplasmin concentration at low, medium and high levels were tested. Each
sample was tested in replicates of five per run, one run a day for five days on one
AU5800 analyzer with three difference lots of reagent (N = 75 per sample). Mean
and %CV for each sample were calculated. The results are summarized in the table
below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity: The linearity across the assay’s analytical measuring grange was evaluated
by a study according to CLSI EP6-A. Eleven serially diluted samples with
ceruloplasmin concentrations ranging from 17.37 to 2197.33 mg/L were prepared by
mixing high positive serum samples with analyte depleted serum. Each dilution was
tested in quadruplicate on the AU5800 analyzer using one lot of reagent. The
weighted linear regression analysis resulted in the following equation:
Slope Intercept Correlation
Range (mg/L) % Bias
(95% CI) (95% CI) Coefficient
17.37–2039.70 1.03 (1.02–1.04) 5.49 (1.02–9.96) 1.00 −1.82–6.36
The data support the linearity of the claimed measuring range of the Ceruloplasmin:
60–2000 mg/L.
Auto-Dilution: A study was performed to evaluate whether the analyzer dilutes the
sample correctly using pre-dilution settings when a sample has a concentration above
the assay range. Deionized water or saline were tested as diluents. A sample with a
concentration within the range of 2000–3000 mg/L was prepared by spiking with
Level 5 of Serum Protein multi-calibrator (ODR3023) or an in-house serum pool.
The sample was tested using the 1:5 automatic dilution setting on one AU5800
analyzer and the diluted sample was run in replicates of 20 using one lot of reagent.
The same sample prepared manually with a 1:5 fold dilution was used as the
reference. The % bias for the results obtained with the auto-dilution compared to the
results obtained with the manual dilution was 2.3% when deionized water was used as
a diluent, and 5.8% when saline was used as a diluent.
Hook Effect: Hook effect was evaluated by using a spiked human serum sample with
ceruloplasmin concentration of 3470 mg/L. The sample was diluted to multiple
levels and the diluted samples were measured in triplicate using one lot of reagent on
one AU5800 analyzer. No hook effect was observed for the sample with
concentration up to 3470 mg/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The calibration material is traceable to IFCC International Reference
Preparation CRM470 (RPPHS).

Value assignment: The calibrator used for the Ceruloplasmin is Serum Protein Multi-
calibrator 2 which was cleared under K992086.
Stability:
Kit stability (unopened): A real-time stability study was performed using three lots of
reagents stored under the recommended temperature at 2–8°C. The data were
collected at different time points up to 19 months. The results support stability of the
kits under the recommended storage of 2–8°C for 18 months.
On-board (In-use) stability: On-board stability was tested using one lot of reagent
and one lot of calibrator. The reagent was calibrated and placed in the refrigerated
compartment (2-8°C) of the analyzer. The data were collected at different time points
up to 90 days. The results support that the on-board reagent stability is up to 90 days
and the calibration stability is up to 14 days.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying four blank samples (5% BSA in
0.9% saline) with three replicates per sample over five days with three different
reagent lots . A total of 60 data points per lot were generated. LoB for each lot was
calculated separately as the 95th percentile value. The LoB for three lots was
determined to be 5.56 mg/L, 5.72 mg/L and 6.29 mg/L. The claimed LoB value is
6.29 mg/L.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by assaying four human serum pools
that were diluted with 0.9% Saline/BSA to achieve low analyte values. Each sample
was tested in triplicate across five days with three different reagent lots. The LoD
value was calculated as the LoB + 1.645 x SD of the replicates for the low level
samples. The LoD for three lots was determined to be 12.15 mg/L, 11.56 mg/L and
11.84 mg/L. The claimed LoD is 12.15 mg/L.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined based on the analysis of total
imprecision of the LoD study with a total error goal of 20%. The LoQ was
determined using seven pooled human serum samples that were diluted to have
analyte concentrations between 2.00 to 40.00 mg/L. Each sample was measured in
triplicate over the course of five days with three different reagent lots. The LoQ for
three lots was determined to be 22.55 mg/L, 22.09 mg/L and 20.83 mg/L. The
claimed LoQ is 22.55 mg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interference: Interferences were assessed following CLSI EP7-A2 by
testing two human serum pools with low concentration (150–200 mg/L) and
intermediate concentration (500–600 mg/L) of ceruloplasmin. Each sample was
spiked with the interfering substances and tested in replicates of four on one AU5800
analyzerusing one lot of reagent. The sample without spiking the interfering

substances was used as reference. The % recovery of the results from the sample
with the interference substance compared to the reference was calculated and no
interference was detected in the samples up to the concentrations listed in the table
below:

Bilirubin (unconjugated) 40 mg/dL 97.78–100.27 %

f. Assay cut-off:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 120 serum samples including 103 samples from individual donors and 17
contrived samples were tested with the Ceruloplasmin and the predicate. The
contrived samples were used to cover the analytical measuring range of both devices
and were prepared by spiking purified human ceruloplasmin into normal human
serum samples. The results are summarized in the table below:

120 9.0–1880.0 0.99
(1.04–1.08) (−31.95– −20.36)
b. Matrix comparison:
A study was performed to demonstrate that heparinized plasma (drawn in lithium-
heparin and sodium-heparin plasma separation tubes) yields values comparable to
serum when tested with the device. A total of 110 or 111 samples with
concentrations spanning the assay range were assayed on one AU5800 analyzer using
one lot of reagent. Deming regression analysis was performed using the data from
different plasma preparations compared to the data from serum samples. The results
are summarized in the tables below:

and the rest of samples with a ceruloplamin level within the reference range of the assay.
The sponsor provided the following statement in the package insert: “Expected values
