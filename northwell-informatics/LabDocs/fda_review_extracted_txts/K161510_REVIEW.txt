4. Special instrument requirements:
VITEK® 2 and VITEK®2 Compact Systems
I. Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each
VITEK 2 test card contains 64 microwells. A control well containing only culture medium is
included on all cards, with the remaining wells containing premeasured amounts of a specific
antimicrobial agent in a culture medium base. A suspension of organism from a pure culture
is prepared in a tube containing 0.45-0.5% sterile saline and standardized to a McFarland 0.5
using the DensiCHEK Plus™. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills seals and places the
card into the incubator/reader; manual methods can also be used for the inoculation of test
cards for use in the VITEK 2 System. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling and
sealing operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time (up to 18 hours). At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is
generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each
antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-GN Ceftolozane/Tazobactam has the following concentrations in the card:
0.5/4, 1/4, 4/4, 8/4, and 32/4µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in
µg/mL). The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 card is ≤0.25 - ≥32 µg/mL.

L. Test Principle:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection
using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics used in the systems use
visible light to directly measure organism growth. Transmittance optics is based on an initial
light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance
samplings of the same well measure organism growth by how much light is prevented from
going through the well. The VITEK 2 System monitors the growth of each well in the card
over a defined period of time. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a
“rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in some instances. At the completion of the
incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive
category result for each antibiotic on the card.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three sites using ten isolates of gram
negative bacilli that were consistent with the intended use. Isolates were tested in
triplicate over three days for a total of 270 data points. The isolates tested in the
reproducibility study included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (three isolates), E.coli (one
isolate), Enterobacter aerogenes (two isolates), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (three
isolates). Inocula were prepared both manually and using automatic dilution for
5

testing in the VITEK 2. Inocula were prepared manually for testing in the VITEK 2
Compact. The mode MIC value was determined and the reproducibility was
calculated based on MIC values falling within ± 1 dilution of the mode MIC value.
Using VITEK 2 (automatic and manual dilution), and the VITEK 2 Compact (manual
dilution), best case and worst case reproducibility was 100%.
The reproducibility results were acceptable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Inoculum Density Check:
The inoculum density was monitored using the DensiCHEK Plus™ instrument during
the trial. The DensiCHEK Plus™ was standardized daily with all results recorded at
each site. Calibration values were within the expected range
Purity Check:
A purity check of all organisms was performed at the time of VITEK2 card
inoculation. Only results obtained with pure cultures were evaluated.
Growth Failure Rate:
Out of 859 clinical isolates, 840 (97.78%) isolates grew in the VITEK 2
Ceftolozane/Tazobactam test.
All 224 challenge organisms grew in the VITEK 2 automatic dilution method and in
the VITEK 2 Compact manual dilution method (100%). In the VITEK 2 manual
dilution method, 223 of 224 (99.5%) of the challenge organisms grew.
Quality Control (QC) Testing:
Organisms recommended by both the FDA and the CLSI, namely Escherichia coli
ATCC 25922, Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603,
and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were tested against
Ceftolozane/Tazobactam. These recommended QC organisms were tested a minimum
of 20 times/site by both the VITEK 2 AST-GN card and with the with CLSI broth
microdilution reference method. Both the automatic dilution and the manual dilution
methods were used for the VITEK 2 and the manual dilution method was used for the
VITEK 2 Compact. The following table (Table 2) provides a summary of the QC
results.

aMIC for Ceftolozane in the presence of a fixed concentration of 4 mg/L of Tazobactam.
*The lowest dilution of the VITEK 2 Ceftolozane/Tazobactam MIC range is 0.25 µg/mL.
Obtaining ≤0.25 µg/mL was considered as an indicator that the quality control results were
acceptable.
The expected range for E. coli ATCC 25922 with Ceftolozane/Tazobactam is 0.12 –
0.5 µg/mL. Even though the Ceftolozane/Tazobactam concentrations included in the
VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card are 0.5/4, 1/4, 4/4, 8/4, and 32/4 µg/mL, the
reporting range is ≤0.25 - ≥32 µg/mL. Therefore, all results for the QC strain were
off-scale for the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems as both VITEK systems
report the lowest end of the scale as ≤0.25 µg/mL (See Table 2 above). E. coli ATCC
35218 was also tested to verify the performance of the device. Many results of this
QC strain were also off scale (≤0.25 µg/mL). However, Klebsiella pneumoniae
ATCC 700603 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were also tested to verify
the performance of the device and all results were on-scale (See Table 2 above).
The quality control results were acceptable.

method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL) and the reporting range is ≤0.25 - ≥32
µg/mL. The reference panel contained two-fold serial dilutions with a range of 0.0313
to 128 µg/mL.
Test inocula were standardized using the DensiCHEK Plus instrument. VITEK 2 AST
– Gram Negative cards were inoculated using automatic dilution (for reading on the
VITEK 2 instrument) or using a manual dilution method (for reading on the VITEK 2
instrument or on the VITEK 2 COMPACT instrument). Reference panels were
inoculated as outlined in the CLSI document M07-A9.
A total of 859 (Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) clinical isolates
were evaluated at three sites with VITEK 2 AST – Gram Negative cards inoculated
by automatic dilution and interpreted using the VITEK 2 instrument. 840 isolates
grew in the VITEK 2 Ceftolozane/Tazobactam test. Complete test results are
available for 840 in Table 3. The majority of isolates were fresh specimens (779/859
isolates, 90.68%); 80 of the clinical isolates tested (80/859 9.3%) were stock isolates.
A total of 76 challenge isolates were tested at one external site. In response to a
request from FDA, 148 additional challenge isolates were evaluated internally at
bioMérieux as well as at an external site which resulted in a total of 224 challenge
isolates. The challenge set was tested with both card inoculation options (automatic
dilution and manual dilution) on the VITEK 2 System and with the manual dilution
on the VITEK 2 COMPACT system.
Results from the 1064 clinical and challenge isolates are summarized in Table 3.
The overall performance using the VITEK 2 System and inoculated using the
automatic dilution method was acceptable, with an EA of 94.8% and CA of 98.4%,
and a minor discrepancy rate of 1 % (11/1064), a major error discrepancy rate of
0.4% (4/907) and a very major error discrepancy rate of 1.4% (2/141).

Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the result of the reference method
and that of VITEK 2 test card within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic.
Evaluable results are those that are on scale for both the VITEK 2 test card and the reference method.
Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees
exactly with the interpretation of the VITEK 2 test card.
Enzyme Groups Characterization:
Enzyme characterization was conducted for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and for
Enterobacteriaceae to cover the majority of beta lactamase enzyme groups and other
resistance markers noted in the FDA drug label. The performance of the VITEK 2
and the VITEK 2 Compact (automatic and manual dilution) with
Ceftolozane/Tazobactam was evaluated using the characterized Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae isolates.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa:
Enzyme characterization was conducted for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates for the
following ESBLs: chromosomal AmpC, and loss of OprD. Enzyme characterization
was also performed for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates that produce serine
carbapenemases [K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)] and metallo-beta lactamases.
During the additional testing, one Very Major Error was observed for Pseudomonas
aeruginosa with a VMJ rate of 3.7% (1/27). This P. aeruginosa isolate lacked the
OprD porin and contained OXA-101 enzyme which has been shown to confer

resistance to Ceftolozane/Tazobactam for P. aeruginosa. This VMJ was addressed by
adding the following footnote in the labeling (Product Information Manual):
“One Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate tested during the clinical evaluation
lacked the OprD porin and contained the OXA-101 enzyme which has been
reported as being resistant to Ceftolozane/Tazobactam and resulted in a Very
Major Error for the VITEK® 2 AST-GN Ceftolozane/Tazobactam test”
Pseudomonas isolates with MexXY and MexAB up-regulation enzymes were not
evaluated as this information was not available at the time of testing. This was
addressed by adding the following footnote in the labeling (Product Information
Manual):
“Enzyme group characterization was not available for the following organisms at
the time of comparative testing, and therefore the performance of the AST card
with Ceftolozane/Tazobactam is unknown: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (up-
regulation of MexXY and MexAB)”.
Enterobacteriaceae (ESBLs):
Enzyme characterization was conducted for claimed Enterobacteriaceae isolates for
the following ESBLs: TEM, SHV and CTX-M. However, information on
Enterobacteriaceae isolates with OXA enzymes was not available at the time of
testing and was not provided. This was addressed by adding the following footnote in
the labeling (Product Information Manual):
“Enzyme group characterization was not available for the following organisms at
the time of comparative testing, and therefore the performance of the AST card
with Ceftolozane/Tazobactam is unknown: Enterobacteriaceae (OXA)
Enterobacteriaceae (KPC and β-lactamases):
Enzyme characterization was also conducted for claimed Enterobacteriaceae isolates
that produce serine carbapenemases [K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)].
However, testing was not conducted against Enterobacteriaceae isolates that are
known to produce serine metallo-beta lactamases. Therefore, the following footnote
was added in the labeling (Product Information Manual):
“Ceftolozane/Tazobactam is not active against Enterobacteriaceae bacteria that
produce metallo-beta lactamases”.
Resistant Organisms:
A total of 141 resistant organisms were identified out of 1064 organisms tested
(13.2%) in the combined challenge and clinical study for Ceftolozane/Tazobactam for
the VITEK 2 with the automatic dilution. However, the following organisms had an
insufficient number of resistant strains available during the comparative study:
Citrobacter koseri, Proteus vulgaris and Serratia liquefacians. This was addressed by
adding the following limitation in the package insert:

--- Page 12 ---
“The ability of the AST card to detect resistance with the following
combination(s) is unknown because an insufficient number of resistant strains
were available at the time of comparative testing. If such a strain is observed, it
should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.

vulgaris, and Serratia Liquefacians
Challenge Data
VITEK 2 Manual Dilution:
The challenge set of 223 isolates evaluated using the VITEK 2 and inoculated using
the manual dilution method demonstrated an EA of 90.1%, a CA of 96.0 % and a
minor discrepancy rate of 2.7 % (6/223), a major error discrepancy rate of 1.8%
(2/109) and a very major error discrepancy rate of 0.9% (1/107). A total of 81 isolates
were determined to have evaluable results. Of these isolates, 71 were within essential
agreement (EA) for a percent EA of evaluable isolates of 87.7%.
The results are summarized in Table 4. The results were acceptable.

VITEK 2 COMPACT Manual Dilution:
The challenge set of 224 isolates was also evaluated using the VITEK 2 Compact and
inoculated using the manual dilution method demonstrated an EA of 92.9%, a CA of
96.4% and a minor discrepancy rate of 2.7 % (6/224), a major error discrepancy rate
of 1.8% (2/109). There were no very major errors. A total of 83 isolates were
determined to have evaluable results. Of these isolates, 73 were within essential
agreement (EA) for a percent EA of evaluable isolates of 88.0%. The results are
summarized in Table 5. The results were acceptable.

Even though the EA of evaluable was low, the overall performance of the VITEK 2
(manual dilution) and the VITEK 2Compact (manual dilution) were considered
acceptable based on the acceptable performance in overall EA, the reproducibility
study, and QC (Table 2).

MIC Trends:
Using the combined clinical and challenge data for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an
analysis of trending was conducted. This trending calculation takes into account MIC
values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilution lower or higher
compared to the reference method irrespective whether the device MIC values are on-
scale or not. The combined data for 189 results constitute the evaluable data for trend
analysis which is presented in Table 6.
Table 6: Trending of Clinical and Challenge Isolate Results for the VITEK 2, Automatic Dilution
P. aeruginosa # isolates ≤1 dilution lower Exact ≥1 dilution higher
Clinical 141 8 75 58
Challenge 48 9 28 11
Combined Clinical 189 17 103 69
and Challenge *8.99% *36.51%
95% CI: (5.69% to 95% CI: (29.98%
13.93) to 43.58%)
*Difference: 27.51 95% CI: (19.33 to 35.32)
A higher MIC reading trend was observed in the overall performance of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa compared to the CLSI broth microdilution reference method, which raises concerns
for potential major errors. This trending and the potential for occurrence of major error(s) for
Ceftolozane/Tazobactam when testing clinical and challenge isolate results with the VITEK 2
System, was addressed by adding the following footnote in the labeling (Product Information
Manual):
“VITEK 2 Ceftolozane/Tazobactam MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or at least
one doubling dilution higher when testing P. aeruginosa compared to the reference broth
micro-dilution”.
