I. Device Description:
The TAP Blood Collection Device is a single-use, sterilized blood collection and
transportation device that uses a combination of two mechanisms, capillary action and
vacuum extraction. The device consists of an integrated reservoir with a visual fill indicator
window. The device is designed to collect and contain approximately 100 µL of capillary
whole blood. The internal fluid path is coated with 100 units of dry lithium heparin. The top
of the device includes a green button and a fill indicator window. The base of the device
includes a release liner that covers a layer of hydrogel adhesive. The hydrogel adhesive seals
to the skin and holds the device in place during use. The TAP device contains an array of
microneedles in order to puncture through the skin. The microneedles are activated by a
spring, released by pushing the green button. The device is provided sterile in a tray and foil
pouch. Instructions on how to collect the capillary sample are provided in the package insert.
After blood collection (must be done within 7 minutes), the TAP device is intended to be
placed inside the tray that it comes with, properly sealed and labelled, and transport to a
clinical laboratory for HbA1c analysis within 6 hours of post-collection, or tested in the time
indicated by the A1c test system package insert. The TAP sample extraction instructions are
also provided in the package insert.

L. Test Principle:
The TAP Device is intended to collect capillary blood from the upper arm of adults (21 years
of age and older) by a healthcare worker for HbA1c testing on compatible test systems. The
TAP Blood Collection Device has a mechanism for skin puncture, a mechanism for drawing
blood, an anticoagulant, and can be used for temporary storage of blood (up to six hours).
The device uses microneedles to create skin punctures for the collection of capillary blood.
When actuated, the device collects the sample in an integrated reservoir, and provides an
indicator to confirm that collection is complete. The device contains lithium heparin as a
blood anticoagulant. The TAP Device is designed for one-time sample extraction and sample
can be removed from the TAP sample access port using a pipette.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Lot-to-lot repeatability and inter-operator variability studies were conducted at three
hospital sites. To evaluate lot-to-lot repeatability, one phlebotomist at each site
collected three TAP Device samples from a minimum of 20 participants. Each of the
three samples was collected using a separate TAP Device lot, for a total of three
device lots used at each site. The collected samples were transferred to the laboratory
at room temperature (15-30oC) and tested for HbA1c using a FDA cleared HbA1c test
system within 6 hours of the blood collection. The blood extraction from the TAP
Device and the HbA1c testing was performed by laboratory technologists. The lot-to-
lot imprecision results were similar for each of the three test sites. The within lot
imprecision for the three sites ranged from 0.87% to 2.09 % CV, the between lot
imprecision ranged from 0.0% to 0.89 % CV, and the total imprecision ranged from
1.20% to 2.09% CV. The combined site lot-to-lot imprecision results are summarized
in the following table:

To evaluate inter-operator precision, three phlebotomists at each site collected a TAP
Device sample from a minimum of 20 participants using one TAP Device lot. The
collected samples were transferred to the laboratory at room temperature (15-30oC).
The blood extraction from the TAP Device and the HbA1c testing was performed by
laboratory technologists. HbA1c was measured using a FDA cleared HbA1c test
system within 6 hours of the blood collection. The inter-operator imprecision results
were similar for each of the three test sites. The within operator imprecision for the
three sites ranged from 1.22% to 1.73% CV, the between operator imprecision ranged
from 0.0% to 0.94% CV, and the total imprecision ranged from 1.44% to 1.73% CV.
The combined site inter-operator imprecision results are summarized in the following

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Shelf-life Stability Study:
The shelf-life stability study protocols and acceptance criteria of the TAP Device
were reviewed and found to be acceptable. Currently, the real-time stability
testing supports a 6 month shelf life when stored at 18-28oC with on-going
studies to support up to 12 month expiration dating.
Shipping Stability Study:
A stability study was conducted to assess the performance of the TAP Device to
collect quality samples after undergoing simulated extreme shipping conditions
(extreme cold, extreme heat, extreme humidity). The shipping stability study
protocols and acceptance criteria of the TAP Blood Collection Device were reviewed
and found to be acceptable. The study results support the manufacturer’s claim the
TAP Device can perform as indicated following shipping of the packaged devices.
Analyte Stability Study:
A stability study was performed to assess the stability of blood collected by the TAP
Device for the measurement of HbA1c. The analyte stability study protocols and
acceptance criteria of the TAP blood collection device were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The analyte stability study results support the sponsor’s claim that blood
may be stored within the TAP device prior to HbA1c testing for up to 6 hours, or for
as long as recommended by the HbA1c test system manufacturer, whichever is less.
Additional bench testing evaluated on the candidate device:
Additional studies were conducted to assess draw volume, sample collection time,
sample quality (hemolysis and blood clot formation) and device malfunction rate.
Study protocols, acceptance criteria and results for these studies were provided and
found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Not applicable.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed at three hospital clinic sites to compare
%HbA1c results from blood collected using the TAP device with the HbA1c results
from blood collected by venipuncture with BD Vacutainer Plus PST II Tubes with
lithium heparin. A total of 243 blood sample pairs were collected by phlebotomists.
The blood was extracted from the device and tested for %HbA1c by laboratory
technologists at each clinic site. The measurement of %HbA1c was performed using
two FDA cleared HbA1c test systems at each of the three sites. The method
comparison results for each test system are summarized below:

The collection site on each of the subjects’ upper arm area was assessed to determine
if the TAP Device caused any adverse dermal responses immediately following
collection, twenty minutes after collection, and seven days after collection. The
assessment showed that no severe adverse effects were observed.
