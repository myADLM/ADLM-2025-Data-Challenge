L. Test Principle:
Teco Diagnostic’s creatinine enzymatic method employs a two reagent system which
eliminates interferences by endogenous creatine and ascorbic acid. Step wise enzymatic
reactions are shown below:
· Creatinine + H O, in the presence of Creatinine amidohydrolase, produce Creatine
2
· Creatine + H O, in the presence of Creatine amidinohydrolase, produce Sarcosine +
2
Urea
· Sarcosine + H O +O , in the presence of Sarcosine oxidase, produce Glycine +
2 2
HCHO +H O
2 2
· 2H O + 4-aminoantipyrine + ESPMT*, in the presence of Peroxidase, produce
2 2
Quinoneimine Dye + 4H O
2
*ESPMT: 3-(N-Ethyl-3-methylanilino) propanesulfonic acid sodium salt
Hydrogen peroxide generated from creatinine reacts with 4- aminoantipyrine and ESPMT in
the presence of peroxidase to yield a quinoneimine dye. The change in absorbance at 546 nm
is proportional to the creatinine concentration in sample. The rate of formation of color is
proportional to the creatinine concentration in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The following data were collected on the TC-MATRIX instrument.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed following a modification to the recommendations in
the CLSI EP5-A3 guideline. The precision study was conducted over 20 non-
consecutive days with two reagent lots using three serum samples at approximately
0.9 mg/dL, 1.5 mg/dL and 3.0 mg/dL creatinine. The serum samples were prepared
by mixing natural patients’ serum sample pools. The testing included two runs per
testing day, with at least two hours separation between runs, three replicates per
sample per run using one instrument. A total of 240 replicates per sample were
generated. The calibrator used was the Teco Chemistry Calibrator. The
representative results from one lot are shown below. The within-laboratory
imprecision estimate includes imprecision from within-run, between run and between
reagent lots.

Sample Mean Repeatability Within – Laboratory
(mg/dL) SD %CV SD %CV
Patient pool 1 0.89 0.008353 0.93 0.01761 1.98
Patient pool 2 1.52 0.01323 0.87 0.03316 2.18
Patient pool 3 3.09 0.02800 0.90 0.03361 1.08
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed following the recommendations in the CLSI EP6-A
guideline. A set of eleven equally spaced creatinine level samples were prepared by
mixing a low serum sample with a high serum sample. The expected creatinine
concentration levels used in the study are 0.37, 0.94, 1.50, 2.06, 2.71, 3.31, 3.83, 4.38,
4.90, 5.49, and 6.12 mg/dL. Each sample was tested in duplicate. The results showed
that the deviation from linearity did not exceed 5%. The results of the regression
analysis are summarized below:
Y = 0.9992x + 0.0007, r2= 0.9983
The study result supports the linearity of the Teco Creatinine Enzymatic Reagent Kit
assay from 0.37mg/dL to 5.06 mg/dL of creatinine.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Reagent stability – Both reagents are stable until expiration dates found on their
labels when stored at 2-8 C. Once opened the creatinine reagents are stable for
°
60 days when stored at 2-8 °C.
Traceability and stability of control and calibration materials:
Calibration Material – The sponsor recommends in the labeling using the Teco
Chemistry Calibrator. This calibrator is traceable to NIST reference material
SRM 967.
Quality Control Materials – The sponsor recommends in the labeling using
quality control samples (two levels – low and high) at least once a day and after
each calibration and every time a new bottle of reagent is used. The values on
control materials are traceable to the reference material, NIST SRM 967.
d. Detection limit:
A limit of blank study was performed following the recommendations in the CLSI
Guideline EP17-A2. The study was conducted using four blank samples and two lots
of reagents. These samples were measured in replicates of five over three days (15
replicates per sample) with a total of 60 measurements per reagent lot. The data were
assessed using the nonparametric analysis option described in the guideline. The
claim was based on the lot with the higher estimate.
A limit of detection study was performed using four diluted serum samples prepared
by diluting serum pool 100x, 50x, 33x and 25x with saline. The samples were tested

using two reagent lots. Each sample was tested 15 times over three days for a total of
60 measurements per reagent lot. The data were assessed using the parametric
analysis option described in the guideline. The claim was based on the lot with the
higher estimate.
A limit of quantitation study was performed using four low concentration serum
samples prepared using serum pools and two reagent lots. Each sample was assayed
15 times over three days per reagent lot. The %CV and SD were calculated, and LoQ
was defined as the concentration with a %CV of less than 20%. The claim was based
on the lot with the higher estimate.
The LoB, LoD and LoQ are claimed as 0.00 mg/dL, 0.01 mg/dL and 0.10 mg/dL,
respectively.
The claimed measuring range is 0.37 - 5.06 mg/dL for serum creatinine with the
candidate device.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was performed by evaluating potential interfering substances
spiked into serum containing creatinine at either 1.5 mg/dL or 5.0 mg/dL. The
recommendations in the CLSI EP7A2 guideline were followed for the interference
testing. Each interferent was tested at two levels except for acetaminophen which
was tested at only one concentration of 1.963 mg/dL. Each test and control sample
was tested in triplicate. The sponsor defines interference as bias exceeding 10%.
The following substances had no significant interference (less than 10% interference)
when tested on the Teco Creatinine Enzymatic Reagent Kit at the concentrations
listed below.
