L. Test Principle:
The A1C EZ Glycohemoglobin Analysis System utilizes the boronate affinity lateral
chromatography method to quantitatively measure the percentage of glycohemoglobinA1c
(HbA1c) in total hemoglobin. A solid phase separation matrix in the membrane contains both
negatively charged groups and boronate groups. When the acidic buffer A flows through the
matrix membrane, positively charged hemoglobin (including glycohemoglobin and non-
glycohemoglobin) binds to the negatively charged groups. At this time, the device measures
the amount of total hemoglobin. When buffer B is added, the pH turns basic and the
hemoglobin loses its positive charge. Hemoglobin is released from the matrix, but cis-diols
of glycohemoglobin can bind to the boronate groups and stay in the matrix. At this time, the
device measures the amount of glycated hemoglobin. The device uses a photometer to
measure the reflectance and calculate the ratio of the glycohemoglobin to the total
hemoglobin.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated according to CLSI EP06-A. The linearity of the A1C EZ
Glycohemoglobin Analysis System was verified by mixing a high K2-EDTA venous
whole blood sample (14.5%) with a low sample (3.6%) to create 11 sample levels
covering the assay range (3.6, 4.7, 5.8, 6.9, 8.0, 9.1, 10.1, 11.2, 12.3, 13.4, and
14.5%). All levels were analyzed in singlicate on five instruments with one reagent
lot. The mean observed %HbA1c value was determined for each level and plotted
versus the % HbA1c value determined by a reference method (Tosoh G8 analyzer).
The linear regression results are as follows:
NGSP units (% HbA1c):
y = 1.0334x – 0.1628, r² = 0.9989
IFCC units (mmol/mol HbA1c):
y = 1.0377x – 1.4795, r2 = 0.9990
The study supports the sponsor’s claimed measuring range of 4.0-14% HbA1c.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The A1C EZ Glycohemoglobin Analysis System is certified with the National
Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). The NGSP certification expires
in one year. See NGSP website for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
Stability:
Real time stability studies are ongoing. Accelerated and real time stability protocols
and acceptance criteria for the A1C EZ Glycohemoglobin Analysis System were
reviewed and considered acceptable to support the sponsor’s shelf life claims:
Test kit: 18 months at room temperature
Test strips: 1 month after opening vial (vial is closed after every test) at 39-75°F (4-
24°C)
d. Detection limit:
Please see linearity study above in M1b.

e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was performed to assess common or known endogenous and
exogenous substances that could interfere with the A1C EZ Glycohemoglobin
Analysis System. The potential interferents listed below were spiked into two K2-
EDTA venous whole blood samples with two different levels of % HbA1c (5.2 and
9.2%). The % HbA1c values of the spiked samples were compared to reference
samples (samples containing no interferent). Samples were tested with 10 replicates
and non-significant interference was defined as ≤ ± 6% difference relative to the
reference sample.

as ≤ ± 7% difference between samples containing glucose and the control samples.
The results support the sponsor’s claim that > 5% labile HbA1c does not interfere
with the A1C EZ Glycohemoglobin Analysis System.
Carbamylated hemoglobin interference:
Two K2-EDTA venous whole blood samples (5.2% and 7.4% HbA1c) were treated
with 4mM potassium cyanate and incubated for two hours at 37°C to facilitate the
formation of carbamylated hemoglobin. The samples were tested in replicates of 10
using the A1C EZ Glycohemoglobin Analysis System. The sponsor defined non-
significant interference as ≤ ± 7% difference between samples containing potassium
cyanate and the control samples. The results support the sponsor’s claim that > 5%
carbamylated hemoglobin does not interfere with the A1C EZ Glycohemoglobin
Analysis System.
Acetylated hemoglobin interference:
Two K2-EDTA venous whole blood samples (5.4% and 9.8% HbA1c) were treated
with 20 mM acetylsalicylate and incubated for 16 hours at 37°C to facilitate the
formation of acetylated hemoglobin. The samples were tested in replicates of 10
using the A1C EZ Glycohemoglobin Analysis System. The sponsor defined non-
significant interference as ≤ ± 7% difference between samples containing
acetylsalicylate and the control samples. The results support the sponsor’s claim that
acetylated hemoglobin does not interfere with the A1C EZ Glycohemoglobin
Analysis System.
Total hemoglobin:
The effect of different levels of total hemoglobin was evaluated using K2-EDTA
venous whole blood samples (5.7% and 8.7% HbA1c). Erythrocytes and plasma of
the same sample were mixed to obtain 10 levels containing total hemoglobin
concentrations of 69 – 226 g/L (21.2% - 66.4% hematocrit). The samples were tested
in replicates of 10 using the A1C EZ Glycohemoglobin Analysis System. The
sponsor defined non-significant interference as < ± 7% difference between samples
containing hemoglobin and the known HbA1c concentration. The data supports the
claimed total hematocrit range of 30 – 55% g/L.
Hemoglobin variants:
A hemoglobin variant study was performed using 117 K2-EDTA venous whole blood
samples (ranging from 3.9 to 10.6% HbA1c) containing known levels of hemoglobin
variants C, D, E, S, and F. The samples were tested for % HbA1c in replicates of 10
using the A1C EZ Glycohemoglobin Analysis System and results were compared to
results obtained with a reference method (Sebia Capillarys 2 Flex Piercing, k122101).
Non-significant interference was defined as ≤ ± 8% difference between the candidate
and reference method.

The testing results indicate that there is no significant interference for Hemoglobin C
(≤ 44.7%), Hemoglobin D (≤ 41.7%), Hemoglobin E (≤ X32.6%), Hemoglobin S (≤
37.8%), and Hemoglobin F (≤ 14.7%).
The labeling contains the following statement: “The results from the A1C EZ 2.0
Glycohemoglobin Analysis System show that there is no significant interference for
Hemoglobin C (≤ 44.7%), Hemoglobin D (≤ 41.7%), Hemoglobin E (≤ X32.6%),
Hemoglobin S (≤ 37.8%) and Hemoglobin F (≤ 14.7%).”
Hemolysis
The effect of hemolysis was evaluated using three K2-EDTA venous whole blood
samples (5.7%, 7.9% and 9.9% HbA1c) containing up to 7700 mg/dL hemolysate
generated from the same samples. Samples were each tested with 10 A1C EZ 2.0
Glycohemoglobin Analysis instruments and one test strip lot, and results were
compared to results from control samples without added hemolysate. The sponsor
defined non-significant interference as ≤ ± 6% difference between hemolyzed
samples and control samples. The results support the sponsor’s claim that hemolysis
of up to 5000 mg/dL has no significant effect on HbA1c measurements obtained with
the A1C EZ Glycohemoglobin Analysis System.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Vibration Study
In order to validate the effect of vibration of device during the test, the devices were put on
the surface of a shaker during testing. The shaker rotated in a manner where the buffer used
in the test would not be shaken out of the device (~15rpm). Three K2-EDTA venous whole
blood samples (5.0%, 6.4% and 10.3% HbA1c) were tested with ten devices in replicates of
20 for each sample (two measurements for each sample per device). The average value,
14

--- Page 15 ---
coefficient of variation, and % bias were calculated and compared with the results obtained
from tests under normal conditions. The results support the sponsor’s claim that vibration
during testing does not affect test results.
Sample Volume Study
The blood sampling device is designed to absorb 2.5-4.5 µL of capillary fingerstick or
venous whole blood. The sponsor provided a study to show that the total volume of blood
absorbed by the blood sampling device ranges from 2.9 to 4.0µL with a mean volume of
3.5µL. The sponsor then investigated the effect of low or high sample volume on the test.
0.5µL, 1.5 µL, 3µL, 4µL, or 5.5 µL of K2-EDTA venous whole blood (5.9%, 8.4% and
10.4% HbA1c) was pipetted onto the coiled polyester of the blood sampler. Each sample was
tested once on a total of ten devices. The bias and % bias compared to the known HbA1c
concentration in the samples were calculated. For 0.5µL, the device reported error code E7
for all data points. The results support the sponsor’s claim that low or high blood volume
does not affect the test results.
Operating Conditions Study
In order to verify the effectiveness of the A1C EZ Glycohemoglobin Analysis System at
extreme operating conditions, the sponsor tested three K2-EDTA venous whole blood
samples (5.2%, 7.4%, and 10.2% HbA1c) on 10 EZ 2.0 instruments at the following
operating condition combinations: 11℃/11% RH, 10℃/90%RH, 38℃/10%RH, and
40℃/90%RH. Results were compared to %HbA1c observed for the same samples at
22℃/40%RH and %bias was calculated. The results support the sponsor’s claim for
operation of the device at temperatures of 50 to 104°F (10 to 40°C) and 30 to 75% relative
humidity.
Infection Control Studies
Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter to
demonstrate complete inactivation of Hepatitis B virus with Clorox Healthcare Bleach
Germicidal Wipes (EPA #67619-12). Robustness studies were performed to demonstrate that
there was no change in performance or in external materials of the meter after 18250
disinfection cycles with Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes. The robustness studies
were designed to simulate 5 years of multiple-patient use with 10 disinfections per day.
Readability assessment
A Flesch-Kinkaid reading level assessment was conducted demonstrating that the user
manuals and test strip package inserts were written at an 7th grade reading level.
