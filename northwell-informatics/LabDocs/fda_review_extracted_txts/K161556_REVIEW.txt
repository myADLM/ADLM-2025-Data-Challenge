SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
OIR Decision Summary
To: THE FILE RE: K161556
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own
Class II device requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device.
Trade Name: CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, Influenza
A Subtyping Kit
510(k) Number: k140851
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device, called
“CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, Influenza A Subtyping Kit
VER2”, as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which
includes instructions for use, and package labeling.
Submitter states in the labeling, 510(k) Summary, and in the submission that the intended use of
the modified device has not changed from its predicate.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATIONS, including clearly labeled diagrams and assay
instructions in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC
TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.
The modifications presented in this special 510k include:
a) Redesign of the reverse primer and probe sequences for A/pdmH1N1 assay to better detect
currently circulating influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses belonging to the 6B.1 genetic
clade;
b) Evaluation of ZENTM Double-Quenched probes (InfA-P, H3-P, pdmInfA-P, pdmH1-P, and
RP-P) as an alternate option to the currently cleared BHQ probes;
c) Elimination of the influenza A/H1 primers/probe (H1-F, H1-R, H1-P) set of reagents because
this influenza virus is no longer circulating and the assay for its detection is unnecessary;
d) Elimination of references and instructions for A/H1 from the IFU statement, package labels,
software, and labeling;
e) Replace positive control PIPC (inactive A/H1, A/H3, A/H1pdm09, B) with SPIC (inactive
A/H3, A/H1pdm09, B);
f) Updating nomenclature of influenza A virus subtypes to align with WHO nomenclature.
Designations A/H1, A/H3 and A/H1pdm updated to A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09;
g) Updates to the device labeling:
• Addition of study results demonstrating the performace of modified assays (modified
primers and probes);
• Replacing LoD data for influenza A/(H3/N2) strains A/New York/55/2004 and
A/Wisconsin/67/2005 with data for A/Perth/16/2009 and A/Victoria/361/2011 strains;

• Addition of reactivity data with potential pandemic influenza A swine H1N1v viruses
A/Texas/14/2008, A/Ohio/09/2015, and A/Minnesota/19/2011;
• Strains A/Maryland/12/1991 and A/Swine/Wisconsin/125/1997 were removed from the
reactivity table as per sponsor indication that they no longer circulate;
4. Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to applicant’s legally marketed predicate
device including, labeling, intended use, physical characteristics, and software is shown in the
table below.

5. A Design Control Activities Summary was present which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method used to assess the impact of the modification on the
device and its components, and the results of the analysis
The risk analysis for the CDC Influenza A Subtyping Kit was conducted to verify that the
device modifications do not present increased or new risks to the user. The following
potential risk factors were identified: 1) the modified oligonucleotides may demonstrate variable
reactivity among virus strains, and 2) that labeling changes may result in testing errors leading to
inaccurate or delayed assay results. Mitigations for risk #1 included analytical reactivity
verification testing. For risk #2, the proposed mitigations are to distribute to the end users an
updated labeling (package insert) for the Influenza A Subtyping Kit and a Product Update
Communication explaining the modifications and communicating the availability of the updated
Influenza A Subtyping Kit. Proposed mitigations should bring the identified hazards to an
acceptable level.
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification activities required, including
tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.
Verification of Performance
The following studies were conducted to mitigate the risk of variable reactivity of the modified
primers and probes:
Analytical sensitivity
A study was conducted to compare the approximate Limit of Detection (LoD; range finding study,
n=3 per each analyte concentration) between cleared and modified RT-PCR reaction mixtures.
The viruses tested were the historic virus A/California/07/2009 and the recent virus A/West
Virginia/01/2016. The latter strain includes the point mutations that cause aberrant results with
the current cleared A(H1)pdm09 assay. Characterized viruses of a known 50% infectious dose
titer (EID50/mL or TCID50/mL) were extracted, and the RNA was serially diluted and tested in
order to determine an estimated LoD (the lowest concentration where 3 of 3 replicates are
detected). These studies were conducted with two RT-PCR enzyme systems cleared for use
with the CDC Influenza A Sybtyping Kit (Invitrogen Superscript and Quanta qscript).
The results of the range-finding LoD study indicate equivalent reactivity between the cleared and
modified reaction mixtures for the historic virus A/California/07/2009. The results for A/West

Virginia/01/2016 confirm that the modifed A(H1)pdm09 assay detects the virus bearing the point
mutation that was not detected by the current A(H1)pdm09 assay.
The estimated LoD was confirmed by testing extraction replicates (n=20) of the highest virus
dilution (of the range-finding study) where greater than or equal to 95% of replicates tested
positive. These studies were conducted with two RT-PCR enzyme systems cleared for use with
the CDC Influenza A Sybtyping Kit (Invitrogen Superscript and Quanta qscript). The following

A comparison study was conducted to demonstrate LOD equivalency for the A/H3 assays
between the currently cleared BHQ probe and the ZEN probe. The RNA was extracted from
A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 virus, was serially deluted, and three replicates per dilution were tested.
The results indicate similar analytical sensitivity between the assays with ZEN and BHQ-1
probes.
Inclusivity
An inclusivity study was conducted to demonstrate the capability of the modified primer/probe
RT-PCR mixtures (InfA, pdmInfA and pdmH1 with ZEN probes) to detect influenza A(H1)pdm09
viruses representative of different geographic locations and phylogenetic clades. Inclusivity
testing was performed with ten representative H1pdm09 viruses at or near the established LoD.
The viruses were grown to high titer, harvested, and serially diluted to near the LoD of the
assays. The diluted viruses were extracted and tested (n=3 replicates) to demonstrate reactivity.
The Influenza A Subtyping Kit was reactive with all H1pdm09 isolates tested. The inclusivity

Performance testing with archived clinical specimens
The performance when testing clinical specimens was evaluated for the modified Influenza A
Subtyping Kit (VER2) including all ZEN quencher probes and the pdmH1 reagents with modified
reverse primer and probe sequences. A clinical specimen set was pre-selected from archives of
past influenza seasons 2011-2012, 2013-2014 and 2015-2016. The specimens were
characterized as positive or negative for influenza using the cleared predicate device or genetic
sequence analysis. One group of specimens included forty-two specimens from the 2015-2016
influenza season that produced aberrant results with the current, cleared pdmH1 assay, but
were confirmed to be positive with A(H1)pdm09 influenza virus by genetic sequence analysis.
These specimens were tested to validate reactivity with the modified InfA, pdmInfA, and pdmH1
assays. A second group of thirty-two specimens, previously confirmed to be positive for A(H3)
influenza virus, was tested to validate reactivity with the InfA, and H3 assays containing the
ZENTM double-quenched probe. A final group included specimens that were previously
confirmed to be negative for influenza A by the cleared InfA assay. This testing was conducted
with two enzyme systems (Invitrogen Superscript and Quanta qscript) and one extraction
method cleared for use with the Influenza A Subtyping Kit.
The results are summarized in the four tables below.

6. Conclusion
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the
indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the
submitter’s description of the particular modifications and the comparative information between
the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has
not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New
510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially
equivalent to the previously cleared device.
