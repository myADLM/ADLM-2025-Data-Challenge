DECISION MEMORANDUM
A. 510(k) Number:
K161619
B. Purpose for Submission:
The purpose of this submission is to add male urine specimens for use with the Xpert®
Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) assay, which has already been cleared for female urine,
endocervical swabs, and patient collected vaginal swabs under K151565. The original clinical
study in K151565 included both male and female clinical specimens, but the male and female
claims are addressed in two separate submissions. The male urine clinical data is submitted in the
present file (K161619). All analytical studies on the urine specimen type were submitted and
reviewed under K151565 unless otherwise specified.

I. Device Description:
The Xpert TV Assay is an automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in vitro
diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of genomic DNA from Trichomonas vaginalis.
The Xpert TV Assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of trichomoniasis.
The Xpert TV Assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert® Instrument Systems
(GeneXpert Dx, GeneXpert Infinity-48, GeneXpert Infinity-48s, and GeneXpert Infinity-80
systems). The GeneXpert Instrument System consists of an instrument, personal computer,
and preloaded software for running tests and viewing the results. The GeneXpert Instrument
System requires single-use, disposable cartridges (the Xpert TV cartridges) that hold the PCR
reagents and host the PCR process. The cartridges are self-contained, so specimens never
come into contact with the working parts of the instrument.
A Sample Processing Control (SPC), Sample Adequacy Control (SAC), and a Probe Check
Control (PCC) are controls utilized by the GeneXpert Instrument System. The SPC is present
to control for adequate processing of the target trichomonads and to monitor the presence of
inhibitors in the real-time PCR reaction to reduce the possibility of false negative results. The
SAC reagents detect the presence of a single copy human gene and monitor whether the
specimen contains human cells. The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, real-time PCR tube
filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability.
The ancillary specimen collection kits for use with the Xpert TV Assay are the Cepheid
Xpert Vaginal/Endocervical Specimen Collection Kit and the Cepheid Xpert Urine Specimen
Collection Kit. The swab and/or urine specimens are collected from asymptomatic or
symptomatic patients and placed into a specimen transport tube containing preservative.
After transferring the specimen to the sample chamber of the Xpert TV cartridge, the user
initiates a test, and places the cartridge into the GeneXpert Instrument System. Results are
automatically generated by the instrument at the end of the process in a report that can be
viewed and printed.

L. Test Principle:
This assay detects and amplifies Trichomonas vaginalis genomic DNA using real time
polymerase chain reaction technology. The probe used in the assay is conjugated to a fluorescent
reporter dye and quencher. Upon amplification, the reporter dye is released from the quencher,
resulting in a fluorescent signal that is quantified using the GeneXpert instrument system.

Potentially Interfering Substances
Studies analyzing potentially interfering substances were previously reviewed and described in
K15165. Due to the addition of the male urine specimen type in this submission, an additional
interfering substance, seminal fluid, was also tested using the same protocol as in K151565. The
presence of seminal fluid did not interfere with detection of Trichomonas vaginalis in the Xpert
Trichomonas Assay. Table 1 lists the potentially interfering substances tested in urine specimen
matrix from K151565 with the addition of seminal fluid.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
The clinical performance of the Xpert TV assay on female urine, endocervical swabs, and patient
collected vaginal swabs has been previously reviewed under K151565.
To assess the clinical performance characteristics of the Xpert TV assay on male urine, a multi-
center prospective study was performed to collect urine specimens from asymptomatic males and
males presenting with symptoms potentially associated with TV infection. The performance of
the Xpert TV Assay was evaluated relative to a Patient Infected Status (PIS) algorithm. The
designation of a subject as being infected was based on the results of the reference tests, which
consisted of InPouch TV culture and validated bi-directional sequencing. A positive result from
either of these two reference tests signified a TV positive subject. The subject was considered to
be not infected when both reference test results were negative.
The clinical study was performed between August 2014 and January 2015 and enrolled both
male and female subjects. The clinical performance of the Xpert TV assay on the female
specimen types (urine, endocervical swabs and patient-collected vaginal swabs) was previously
reviewed and cleared in K151565. For the collection of male urine specimens, a total of 4465
male subjects were enrolled, of which 4458 were eligible for inclusion. The seven ineligible
subjects included one subject with improper or incomplete informed consent, two subjects
previously enrolled in the study, two subjects who had been treated with antibiotics within 21
days prior to study enrollment, one subject who was not sexually active, and one subject who
was <14 years of age.
The clinical study was extended for male subjects only between October 2015 and March 2016
at three of the original study sites. The inclusion/exclusion criteria, study procedures, enrollment,
assay procedures, quality control, bias elimination, data collection and sample size calculations
were the same as described in K151565. A total of 333 additional male subjects were enrolled
and eligible for inclusion.
A total of 4791 eligible male subjects (4458 from the original study and 333 subjects from the
extended study) were enrolled. Of these, 165 were excluded due to 96 sample shipping delays,
36 samples tested more than 72 hours after collection, 21 Xpert modules out of calibration, and
12 samples not tested. This resulted in a total of 4626 specimens from eligible male subjects that
were tested with the Xpert TV assay. Xpert TV results for 97.7% (4521/4626) of samples were
successful on the first attempt; 105 results were indeterminate. One hundred of the 105
indeterminate samples were retested, and 90 of those cases yielded valid results. The overall rate
of assay success was 99.7% (4611/4626).
10

--- Page 11 ---
In total, 4611 specimens from male subjects were included in the clinical performance analysis
(4626 eligible specimens tested minus 15 indeterminate results). Of these, 1088 were
symptomatic and 3523 were asymptomatic. The average age of the male subjects was 36.2 years
old, and the average age among symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects was 32.6 years and 37.4
years, respectively.
The clinical performance of the Xpert TV assay was assessed for the original and supplemental
studies both separately and combined. Analysis was performed using Fisher’s Exact p-value to
ensure that no statistical difference was found between the results generated in the original and
supplemental studies. The combined sensitivity for the urine specimen type was 87.5% and
90.3% for symptomatic and asymptomatic males, respectively. The overall sensitivity (including
both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects) was 89.6%. The combined specificity was 99.8%
and 99.2% for symptomatic and asymptomatic males, respectively. The overall specificity
(including both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects) was 99.3%. The clinical performance
data is reported in Table 2.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The estimated positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the Xpert
TV Assay across different hypothetical prevalence rates are shown for the male urine specimen
type in Table 3. (The expected values for female urine, endocervical swabs, and vaginal swabs
are reported in K151565). These calculations are based on the overall estimated sensitivity and
specificity observed for male urine specimens during the Xpert TV multi-center clinical study.
The overall sensitivity and specificity for male urine (UR) was 89.6% and 99.3%, respectively.

is capped and inverted 3-4 times to ensure mixing.
5. Calibration:
The user is instructed to contact Cepheid regarding instrument calibration in each
operator manual.
6. Quality Control:
The Xpert TV assay includes a sample adequacy control to verify that human DNA is
present in the sample, a sample processing control to verify adequate processing of
sample, and a probe check control to ensure adequate reagent rehydration.
