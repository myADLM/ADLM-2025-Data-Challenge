L. Test Principle:
The test consists of two steps and is based on the technique to use well-characterized
surfactants and enzymes that selectively react with certain groups of lipoproteins.
In the first step, non-sd LDL lipoproteins, that is, chylomicrons, VLDL, IDL, L-LDL and
HDL are decomposed by a surfactant and sphingomyelinase in Reagent-1 that is reactive to
those non-sd LDL lipoproteins. The cholesterol released from such non-sd LDL lipoproteins
is then degraded to water and oxygen by the action of enzymes. Cholesterol ester is
hydrolyzed by the cholesterol esterase and then oxidized by the cholesterol oxidase.
Produced hydrogen peroxides are finally decomposed to water and oxygen by the catalase.
In the second step, another surfactant in Reagent-2 releases cholesterol only from sd LDL
particles and cholesterol released from sd LDL is then subject to the enzymatic reactions. As
catalase in the reaction mixture is inhibited by sodium azide in Reagent-2, hydrogen
peroxides, produced from the reaction with the cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidase,
develop a purple-red color with the coupler in the presence of peroxidase.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was performed at a total of three sites (one internal and two external
sites) according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP05-A3
guideline. Samples were assayed twice a day, two replicates per run, for 20 days, for
a total of 80 results per sample. Total precision (N=80) was calculated and presented
in the tables below.
The study included five samples, 2-level control set, and three serum-based pools.
The three serum based pools used in the sites where different, but were representative
of low, intermediate, and high sd LDL-C concentrations. Each site employed one lot
of assay reagents, and one instrument.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study was performed according to the CLSI guideline EP6-A. The study
included 13 evenly distributed concentrations from 0 to 127 mg/dL prepared from a
high and low serum pool. Regression analyses were used, as described in the
guideline, to check for nonlinearity. The third-order model fit the data better than the
linear model. However, the test results within the claimed measuring range did not
deviate from linearity by more than 11%. The linear regression analysis is
summarized below:
y = 1.0099x +1.0039.
The sponsor claims that that the measuring range of the candidate device is 4.0 - 100
mg/dL. Test results below 4.0 mg/dL are reported as <4 mg/dL and test results above
100 mg/dL are reported as >100 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The method is traceable to an internal standard prepared from pooled human serum
and value assigned using an internal standard measurement method.
d. Detection limit:
For the limit of blank (LoB), saline samples were assayed in replicates of 15 over 5
days (5 runs) using 3 lots of reagents on one analyzer for a total of 75 replicates per
reagent lot. The classical approach (nonparametric option) described in the CLSI
EP17-A2 guideline was followed. The claim was based on the reagent lot with the
highest estimated LoB.
For the limit of detection (LoD) and the limit of quantitation (LoQ) the sponsor

assayed multiple low level serum samples (6 for the LoD study and 10 for the LoQ
study) in duplicate over 5 days using 3 lots of reagents and one analyzer for a total n
of 60 per lot for the LoD studies and a total n of 10 per sample per reagent lot for the
LoQ study. The LoD was estimated following the classical approach (parametric
option) described in EP17-A2. The LoQ was estimated using the precision profile
approach described in the guideline and was defined as the concentration point where
the imprecision is no greater than 10 %CV. The LoD and LoQ claims are based on
the reagent lot with the highest estimate. The LoB was 0.20 mg/dL, the LoD was
0.38 mg/dL, and the LoQ was 1.14 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The studies were designed following the recommendations in the CLSI guideline
EP7-A2. Three human serum samples that spanned the dynamic range were used for
each compound. The samples were divided into two series of aliquots: one aliquot
was spiked to represent the interfering sample, and another aliquot remained neat to
represent the control sample. All samples were assayed in triplicate and results were
averaged. The results between the neat and spiked samples were all within ± 10%.
The sponsor claims that the following compounds at the concentrations listed did not
interfere with the performance of the test.
The test results are summarized below:
Hemoglobin: No significant interference up to 1,000 mg/dL
Bilirubin: No significant interference up to 60 mg/dL for both conjugated and
unconjugated bilirubin
Chyle: No significant interference up to 1420 FTU
Sodium L-ascorbate: No significant interference up to 100 mg/dL
Intralipid to assess turbidity: No significant interference up to 10% Intralipid
(approximately 2,200 mg/dL triglycerides)
Uric acid: No significant interference up to 15 mg/dL
Triglyceride: No significant interference up to 1,500 mg/dL
Drugs: No interference was found at 3 fold higher than therapeutic levels using
Pravastatin, Pitavastatin, Atorvastatin, Rosuvastatin, Simvastatin, Fluvastatin,
Ezetimibe, Fenofibrate, Gamma-Oryzanol, Bezafibrate, Probucol, Tocophenol
Nicotinate, and Riboflavin Tetrabutyrate.

b. Matrix comparison:
Multiple matched serum and plasma samples were drawn from 48 subjects. The tube
types were: serum (reference, “plain”), serum separator tubes (SST), K2 EDTA
plasma tubes, and lithium heparin plasma tubes. Samples from each tube type were
assayed in duplicate, but for the analyses (least squares linear regression statistics),
the x-axis was the mean of the duplicate testing of the plain tube, and the y-axis was
the first result from the other four (4) tubes. The plain tube was considered the
reference condition. The concentration of the samples ranged from 10 to 90 mg/dL

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The sd LDL-C cutoff value of 50.0 mg/dL was validated using subjects without
prevalent CHD (defined as self-reported myocardial infarction, silent MI (diagnosed
by electrocardiographic changes), validated MI or revascularization procedure) from
the ARIC study Visit 4 participants.
For the clinical validation, a total of 10,290 subjects were tested. The subjects ranged
from 52 to 75 years of age at the time of ARIC study Visit 4 (1996-1998), 56%
females and 44 % males and were recruited from four U.S. communities (Washington
County MD; Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; and Minneapolis, MN) and were
followed for a maximum of 16 years. The primary endpoint used in the clinical
validation study was a composite of total CHD events, comprising of 1) hospitalized
MI, 2) fatal CHD or 3) cardiac procedure.

Associations between sd LDL-C and incident CHD was determined using Cox
proportional hazards modeling, in both minimally adjusted and fully adjusted models.
The basic model (Model 1) was adjusted for age, sex, and race as potential
confounders. Model 2: was adjusted for the Model 1 variables + ever smoker, BMI,
hypertension (systolic blood pressure and/or hypertension medications), HDL,
log(triglycerides), lipid-lowering medication, diabetes, and log(high sensitivity C-
reactive protein). Triglycerides and high sensitivity C-reactive protein were log-
transformed to account for their non-Gaussian distributions.

Additional studies:
· The sponsor provided a sensitivity analysis to estimate the impact on the
interpretation of the test result because of the change in the universal definition of
myocardial infarction (which is a component of the composite endpoint used) that
occurred during the study period. The sponsor estimated potentially missed
myocardial infarctions by reevaluating the data on symptoms, cardiac biomarkers
levels and electrocardiographic evidence used to determine MIs in all ARIC study
participants for the entire period where the new definition of MI was not utilized.
The results of the sensitivity analysis showed that there was no significant impact
on the association of sd LDL-C with risk of incident CHD since there was no
change in estimated hazard ratios for incident CHD in the 50 mg/dL cut point
analysis. The sponsor also showed that the hazard ratios for incident CHD were
similar to the hazard ratios of revascularization procedures and CHD-related death
(and these endpoints are included in the incident CHD endpoint).
· Data was provided supporting the stability of the frozen specimen used in the
clinical validation study.
The labeling includes the following information as “Limitations”:
· The assessment of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk should include the patient’s
history, clinical information, and other clinical laboratory test results in addition
the results from this assay.
· The s LDL-EX”SEIKEN” test is not a replacement for LDL-C measurement. It
should not be used in risk assessment calculators.
The labeling also includes the following information as “Limitations of the Clinical
Study”:
· During the clinical study, the universal definition of myocardial infarction was
updated. This change impacted the number of myocardial events routinely
identified. As a result, the clinical information provided in support of this device
may not reflect the total number of myocardial infarctions that the study
participants experienced.
4. Clinical cut-off:
The sd LDL-C cutoff value of 50.0 mg/dL was established using samples from the Multi-
Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and was based on the 75th percentile value of sd
LDL-C for normolipidemic and dislipidemic subjects who showed no sign of coronary
heart disease or diabetes mellitus at baseline (n=3,938).
10

5. Expected values/Reference range:
A reference interval study was performed in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP28-
A3c. Eligible subjects were enrolled at two US regions and consented to a single blood
draw after an overnight fast. Subjects were partitioned by age and sex, according to the
following four parameters: (1) males 21 – 44 years of age and (2) males 45 – 75 years,
and (3) females 21 – 54 years of age (presumed pre-menopausal/peri-menopausal) and
(4) females 55 – 75 years (presumed post-menopausal). The inclusion criteria for the
reference populations described as ambulatory status and presumptively healthy, HDL-C
≥ 40 mg/dL, LDL-C < 160 mg/dL, TG < 200 mg/dL, fasting glucose < 126 mg/dL.
Age differences associated with the sd LDL-C level were significant in both sexes
(p=0.0030 in males and p<0.0001in females). No significant difference was observed in
the sd LDL-C level between males and females (p=0.7564).
According to the CLSI guideline, the normal range was defined as the 2.5th percentile
value to the 97.5th percentile value, as described below.
