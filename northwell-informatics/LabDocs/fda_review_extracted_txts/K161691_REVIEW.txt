L. Test Principle:
The assay consists of 2 distinct reaction steps:
1. Elimination of chylomicron, VLDL-cholesterol and HDL
cholesterol by Cholesterol Esterase, Cholesterol Oxidase and
subsequently Catalase.
2. Specific measurement of LDL-cholesterol after release of LDL-cholesterol
by detergents in Reagent 2. The intensity of the quinoneimine dye
produced is directly proportional to the LDL-cholesterol concentration
when measured at 600 nm. In the second reaction catalase is inhibited by
sodium azide in Enzyme Reagent 2.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All performance studies were performed on the Randox RX Daytona Plus analyzer.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the Direct LDL Cholesterol (LDL) test system was determined in
accordance with the CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. The precision study was performed
utilizing 2 reagent lots, 2 RX Daytona Plus analyzers using serum based control
material, one unaltered human serum sample in the normal range and three human
serum samples that were spiked with LDL cholesterol concentrations or diluted to
achieve concentrations spanning medically relevant concentrations. Two replicates of
each of the control and serum samples were tested on two separate runs per day for 20
days, leading to the generation of 80 data points for each sample. The mean, standard
deviation (SD), and % coefficient of variation (CV) calculated for within-run and
total imprecision for each lot yielded similar results. The results from one
representative lot are shown below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity of the Direct LDL Cholesterol (LDL) test system was determined in
accordance with the CLSI EP6-A guideline. Linearity studies were performed using
two lots of reagent on one RX Daytona Plus analyzer. For both studies, samples
spanning the linear range of the assay were prepared by inter-mixing a high serum
sample spiked with LDL Cholesterol (850 mg/dl) with a low concentration serum
sample diluted with 0.9% saline (21 mg/dl) to generate a total of 11 samples. Each
sample was assayed in 5 replicates. The results of the analysis showed that within the
measured range, the results did not deviate by more than 10% from linearity. The
linear regression analyses for one representative lot are summarized below:
y = 0.99x + 6.34; r = 0.997
The reportable range of the LDL assay is 21-740 mg/dL.
Samples with concentrations greater than 740 mg/dL are re-run automatically by the
RX Daytona Plus using the established high re-run condition.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Refer to the previously cleared Randox Direct HDL-C/LDL-C Calibrator (K122126).
The reagent system has not been tested or certified by the Cholesterol Reference
Method Laboratory Network (CRMLN) and this information is included in the
package insert.
Calibrator:
The calibrator recommended for use with the Direct LDL Cholesterol (LDL) reagent
is the previously cleared Randox Direct HDL-C/LDL-C Calibrator (K122126).
Controls:
The controls recommend for use with the Direct LDL Cholesterol (LDL) reagent are
the previously cleared Randox Lipid Control Sera; Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3
(K022591).
Stability:
The reagent shelf life stability claim is 18 months at 2 - 8°C. The reagent onboard (in
use and refrigerated) stability claim is 28 days.
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit studies have been carried out in accordance with the CLSI EP17-A2
guideline. Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of
Quantification (LoQ) studies were performed on two lots of reagents tested on one
5

--- Page 6 ---
RX Daytona Plus analyzer. Each lot was analyzed separately.
The LoB pool consisted of artificial serum base matrix with no LDL added. The LoB
study samples were tested in 20 replicates over 3 days for a total of 60 replicate
results. Nonparametric analysis was used for the LoB determination. The LoB was
determined as the 95th percentile of all values. The claim is based on the lot with the
highest determined LoB.
The LoD pool consisted of 4 low level sample pools prepared by diluting patient sera.
The LoD study samples were tested in 20 replicates over 3 days for a total of 60
replicate results per pool. The LoD was determined using the following equation:
LoD = LoB + c SD where SD is the estimated standard deviation of the sample
β s s
distribution at a low level and c is derived from the 95th percentile of the standard
β
Gaussian distribution. The claim is based on the lot with the highest determined LoD.
The LoQ pools consisted of 4 separate pools prepared by diluting patient sera. The
LoQ is the lowest concentration that can be detected with ≤ 20%CV. The claim is
based on the lot with the highest determined LoQ.
Results for one representative lot are summarized in the following table:
Analyte LoB LoD LoQ
LDL (mg/dL) 1.94 3.19 16.1
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies have been carried out in accordance with the CLSI EP7-A2
guideline. Interference testing was performed at 2 different concentrations of LDL
(96.75 mg/dL and 193.5 mg/dL) using one RX Daytona Plus analyzer and two
reagent lots. Pooled human serum samples with added potential interferents were
tested in replicates of 10, and compared to a sample without interferent. The sponsor
defined no significant interference as < 10 % difference from the control sample.
Results are summarized in the table below:
Concentration at which no significant
Interferent
interference was observed
Hemoglobin 1000 mg/dL
Total Bilirubin 60mg/dL
Conjugate Bilirubin 60 mg/dL
Triglycerides 500 mg/dL

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was carried out in accordance with the CLSI guideline
EP9-A2. 139 patient serum samples, comprised of 127 unaltered patient serum
samples and 12 spiked patient serum samples spanning the measuring range 22.45 to
735.68 mg/dL, were tested in singlicate on two lots of the Direct LDL Cholesterol
(LDL) reagent on one RX Daytona plus analyzer and using the predicate device on
one RX Imola system across 3 working days. The results from the proposed test
system were compared to the results from the predicate device. Both lots had similar
results. The linear regression analysis of one representative lot yielded the following
results:
y = 1.01x – 1.45, r = 0.998
b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison studies for the Direct LDL Cholesterol (LDL) reagent were
performed on one RX Daytona plus system and two lots of reagents. Both serum and
lithium heparin plasma samples were tested in singlicate. Patient samples were drawn
in matched pairs–the first sample was a serum sample (x) and the second sample was
a lithium heparin plasma sample (y). A total of 70 matched patient sample pairs were
analyzed spanning the range of 25.45 – 665.64 mg/dL. The samples were comprised
of 63 unaltered patient serum/plasma samples, 6 spiked patient serum/plasma sample
and 1 diluted patient serum/plasma samples. Both lots had similar results. The linear
regression analysis of one representative lot yielded the following results:
y = 1.01x – 2.81, r = 0.998
Based on the study, lithium heparin plasma is an acceptable matrix for the candidate
assay.
