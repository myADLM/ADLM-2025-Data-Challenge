Immunalysis Barbiturates Urine Enzyme Immunoassay
The Immunalysis Barbiturates Urine Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous enzyme
immunoassay with a cutoff of 200 ng/mL. The assay is intended for use in laboratories
for the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of Barbiturates in human urine with
automated clinical chemistry analyzers. This assay is calibrated against Secobarbital. This
in vitro diagnostic device is for prescription use only.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as
Gas Chromatography/ Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid Chromatography/ Tandem
Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or permitting laboratories to establish quality control
procedures.
The Immunalysis Barbiturates Urine Enzyme Immunoassay provides only a preliminary
analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to
obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC-MS or LC-MS/MS is the preferred confirmatory
method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug
of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.
lmmunalysis Multi-Drug Calibrators:
The lmmunalysis Multi-Drug Calibrators are intended for in vitro diagnostic use for the
calibration of assays for the following analytes: Benzoylecgonine, Methamphetamine,
Morphine, PCP, Secobarbital and Oxazepam. The calibrators are designed for
prescription use with immunoassays.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Performance data was obtained using the Beckman AU400e clinical chemistry analyzer.

L. Test Principle:
This assay uses a recombinant and a mouse monoclonal antibody, both directed against
Secobarbital. The assay is based on the competition of Barbiturates labeled enzyme glucose-
6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and the free drug in the urine sample for the fixed
amount of antibody binding sites. In the absence of the free drug in the sample, the antibody
binds the drug enzyme conjugate and enzyme activity is inhibited. This creates a dose
response relationship between drug concentration in the urine and enzyme activity. The
enzyme G6PDH activity is determined at 340 nm spectrophotometrically by the conversion
of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision/cutoff characterization study was performed over 20 days, with two runs
per day in duplicate (n=80) on calibrators (100 and 200 ng/mL), controls (150 and
250 ng/mL) and drug-free negative urine samples spiked with secobarbital to

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The secobarbital in the calibrator is traceable to a commercially available
secobarbital solution. This standard is diluted with synthetic negative urine to make
the calibrators at the desired concentrations. The concentrations are confirmed by Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry Analysis (GC/MS) and/or Liquid
Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS/MS).
Value Assignment/Expected Values
Calibrators are manufactured and tested by mass spectrometry. The negative
calibrator is a processed, drug free urine matrix. The negative calibrator is compared
to a reference negative standard to ensure that it is free of analyte. The non-zero
calibrators are prepared by spiking a known concentration of secobarbital into a
negative calibrator matrix. If any of the analytes are not within the acceptable range,
as measured by mass spectrometry,then the calibrator is adjusted and re-tested.
Values are assigned to the calibrators once the mass spectrometry results are within
the acceptable ranges.
Calibrator Stability
Stability protocols and acceptance criteria for the calibrators were reviewed and
found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims that when stored at 2 – 8o C calibrators

and controls are stable for one year. The sponsor claims that once opened, the
calibrators and controls are stable for 60 days when stored at 2 – 8o C.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Structurally related compounds
The sponsor performed cross-reactivity studies in both qualitative and semi-
quantitative modes by spiking various barbiturates or structurally related compounds
into drug free urine at levels that will yield a result that is equivalent to the assay
cutoff (200 ng/mL). The results were the same for the qualitative and semi-
quantitative modes and are summarized below:
Concentration
Compound Cross-Reactivity (%)
Tested (ng/mL)
Secobarbital 200 100
Allobarbital 690 29.0
Alphenal 190 105.3
Amobarbital 200 100.0
Aprobarbital 700 28.6
Barbital 9,000 2.2
Butabarbital 510 39.2

Phenobarbital 460 43.5
Phenytoin 100,000 <0.2
Talbutal 220 90.9
Thiopental 3,700 5.4
Non-structurally related compounds
Potential interference from non-structurally related drugs and metabolites was
evaluated in the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes by spiking these compounds
into drug free urine containing secobarbital at ± 25% of the 200 ng/mL cutoff (150
ng/mL and 250 ng/mL respectively). The results were the same for the qualitative and
semi-quantitative modes and are summarized below:

evaluated in the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes by spiking these compounds

ng/mL, respectively) at the 200 ng/mL cutoff in both the qualitative and
semiquantitative modes. The following statement is provided in the limitations
section of the labeling: “Boric Acid at 1% w/v may cause false negative results. Boric
Acid is not recommended as a preservative for urine”.
pH and Specific Gravity. To evaluate potential interference from the pH of urine,
device performance in the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes was tested using a
range of urine pH values (3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0 and 11.0). All test
samples were prepared in drug free urine containing secobarbital at ± 25% of the 200
ng/mL cutoff (150 ng/mL and 250 ng/mL, respectively). No positive or negative
interference was observed at urine pH values ranging from 3.0 to 11.0 for the
qualitative and semi-quantitative modes.
To evaluate potential interference from the specific gravity of urine, device
performance in the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes was tested using a range
of urine specific gravity values (1.000, 1.002, 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025 and
1.030). All test samples were prepared in drug free urine containing secobarbital at ±
25% of the 200 ng/mL cutoff (150 ng/mL and 250 ng/mL, respectively). No positive
or negative interference was observed at urine specific gravity values ranging from
1.000 to 1.030 for the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration of 200 ng/mL is described in the precision section, M.1.a. above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison study was performed in-house using unaltered, clinical urine
samples obtained from clinical testing laboratories. A total of 96 samples were
analyzed. Each sample was run in singlicate on a Beckman Coulter AU400e
Chemistry Analyzer and the result was compared to that obtained by liquid
chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS-MS). The results were the same for the
qualitative and semi-quantitative modes and are summarized below.
