L. Test Principle:
Glucose measurement is based on electrochemical biosensor technology using the enzyme
glucose dehydrogenase to catalyze the formation of gluconolactone from the oxidation of
glucose whereby two electrons are produced. The electrical current resulting from this
enzymatic reaction is measured and correlated to glucose concentration by the meter. The
magnitude of the current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample. The
test strip is calibrated to display the equivalent of plasma glucose values to allow
comparison of results with laboratory methods. Using the same technology, β-
hydroxybutyrate (β-ketone) is converted by β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and the
magnitude of electrical current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is proportional to
the amount of β-hydroxybutyrate present in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Performance testing was conducted on the FORA ADVANCED GD-40 Blood Glucose
and β-Ketone Monitoring System only. This is acceptable because the only differences
between the FORA ADVANCED GD-40 and FORA ADVANCED GD-40 pro systems
are the name and intended use (single-patient vs. multiple-patient use).

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of
20-600 mg/dL for the GD40 system and 10-600 mg/dL for the GD40 pro system, and
claimed ketone measurement range of 0.1- 8.0 mmol/L for both systems. The meters
display ‘Lo’ when samples are below the measuring range and ‘Hi’ when samples are
above the measuring range for both glucose and ketones. Validation testing was
performed demonstrating that these feature function as intended.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The FORA ADVANCED GD-40 and FORA ADVANCED GD-40 pro systems are
traceable to the NIST SRM 917c glucose reference material and to an in-house
standard prepared gravimetrically from commercially available materials for the b-
ketone. The method comparison study was performed using the YSI 2300 Glucose
analyzer and the b-Hydroxybutyrate LiquiColor analyzer as the reference methods
(see Section M.2.a.)
Test strip stability:
Glucose
Open and closed vial stability for the FORA ADVANCED GD-40 and FORA
ADVANCED GD-40 pro Blood Glucose Test Strips were assessed in real-time
studies. Study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable
to support the sponsor’s claimed closed vial (shelf life) stability of 21 months, and
open vial stability of 6 months when stored under the recommended storage
conditions of 36°F to 90°F (2-32°C) and relative humidity of 10-85%.
Ketone
Open and closed vial stability for the FORA ADVANCED GD-40 and FORA
ADVANCED GD-40 pro Blood β-Ketone Test Strips were assessed in real-time
studies. Study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable
to support the sponsor’s claimed closed vial (shelf life) stability of 18 months, and
open vial stability of 6 months when stored under the recommended storage
conditions of 36°F to 90°F (2-32°C) and relative humidity of 10-85%.

--- Page 10 ---
The FORA ADVANCED GD-40 and FORA ADVANCED GD-40 pro Blood β-
Ketone Test Strips are also provided in individual foil packages. The shelf life
stability of the foil packaged test strips was assessed in a real-time study. The study
protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable to support the
sponsor’s claimed stability of 18 months when stored under the recommended storage
conditions of 36°F to 90°F (2-32°C) and relative humidity of 10-85%.
Control solution stability:
Glucose
The FORA Glucose Control Solutions were previously cleared (k093724). The
stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed under k093724 and found to
be acceptable to support the claims that the closed control solution vials are stable for
24 months and the open control solution vials are stable for 90 days after opening
when stored at the recommended storage conditions of 36°F-86°F (2°C-30°C).
Ketone
Open and closed vial stability protocols and acceptance criteria for the β-Ketone
Control Solutions were reviewed and found to be acceptable to support closed vial
stability of 24 months and open vial stability of 3 months when stored at the
recommended storage conditions of 2-80C.
Value assignment of controls:
Glucose
The FORA Glucose Control Solutions were previously cleared (k093724) and are
identical except in name. The value assignment protocol were reviewed under
k093724 and found to be acceptable.
Ketone
Three targeted concentrations of the β-Ketone Control Solutions are prepared
gravimetrically and analyzed using the YSI 2300 STAT Plus. Each level of the
control solution is tested 25 times. The mean along with SD and CV are used to
establish the ranges for each level which are then provided on the test strip vial label.
d. Detection limit:
The glucose measuring range is 20-600 mg/dL for the GD40 device and 10-600
mg/dL for the GD40 pro device, and the ketone measuring range is 0.1-8.0 mmol/L
for both. These ranges are validated via the linearity study. See section M.1.b.

e. Analytical specificity:
Glucose
Interference testing was performed to evaluate exogenous and endogenous substances
using venous blood spiked to two glucose levels of 75 and 170 mg/dL. The samples
were divided into 2 aliquots: control (with no added interferent) and test (with added
interferent at a toxic level or 10 times the known therapeutic level). Each sample was
measured by the reference method (YSI) and four FORA ADVANCED GD-40
meters. The sponsor defines no significant interference as bias < ± 10% for the test
compared to control samples. The following table lists the concentrations of each
substance at which no significant interference was detected.

To address potential interference from acetaminophen ≥ 6 mg/dL and uric acid
≥ 10 mg/dL, the labeling contains the following statements:
Acetaminophen in your blood > 6.25 mg/dL might affect the reliability of your
blood glucose results. If you are taking Tylenol your glucose results may not be
reliable. If you are unsure, then ask your doctor.
If you have a disease or condition that elevates your blood uric acid level
(>10mg/dL), such as gout, your blood glucose results may not be reliable. If
you are unsure, then ask your doctor
Ketone
Interference testing was performed to evaluate exogenous and endogenous substances
using venous blood spiked to two β-Ketone levels of 1.0 and 3.0 mmol/L. The
samples were divided into 2 aliquots: control (with no added interferent) and test
(with added interferent at a toxic level or 10 times the known therapeutic level). Each
sample was measured by the β-Hydroxybuturate LiquiColor analyzer and four FORA
ADVANCED GD-40 meters. The sponsor defines no significant interference as bias
< ± 10% for the test compared to control samples. The following table lists the

Glucose
System accuracy for glucose was assessed in a study using six FORA ADVANCED
GD-40 meters and three lots of FORA ADVANCED GD-40 Blood Glucose test
strips. Results from the meter were compared to results from the YSI analyzer.
Capillary samples from the finger and sodium heparinized venous samples from 172
participants were collected. The total glucose concentration range of capillary
samples tested was 43 - 512 mg/dL and total glucose concentration range of venous
samples was 44-514 mg/dL. To achieve glucose concentrations less than 50 mg/dL, 6
finger and venous samples were allowed to glycolyze. To achieve glucose
concentrations greater than 400 mg/dL, 4 finger and venous samples were spiked.
Results of the meter measurements relative to YSI are summarized below:

user is instructed to calibrate every time a new vial of ketone test strips is begun.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor provides 3 levels of FORA Glucose Control Solutions and 2 levels of b-
20

--- Page 21 ---
Ketone Control Solutions, all sold separately. The outer kit box labels state that controls
are necessary but not included and must be purchased separately.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Altitude study: An altitude study was performed in a glove box to simulate 3
different altitudes (0, 5000 and 15000 feet). Venous whole blood was spiked to
achieve seven glucose concentrations (65, 110, 185, 275, 380, 465, and 580 mg/dL)
and five ketone levels (0.2, 1.0, 3.0, 6.0, and 8.0 mmol/L). Each sample was tested
with 4 meters and the glucose results were compared to YSI and the ketone results to
b-Hydroxybutyrate LiquiColor. The results demonstrate acceptable bias to support
the claims that altitudes up to 10,742 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose
or ketone measurements with these systems.
2. Hematocrit study: The effect of different hematocrit levels were evaluated using
venous whole blood samples with hematocrit levels of 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%,
and 75%. Five samples were spiked to glucose concentrations of 57, 125, 236, 389,
and 565 mg/dL, as measured by YSI, and four samples were spiked to b-ketone levels
of 1.0, 2.8, 4.7 and 7.0 mmol/L, as measured by the b-Hydroxybutyrate LiquiColor
method. The samples were tested with 6 meters and the results were compared to YSI
and the normal 40% hematocrit. The % biases relative to YSI were acceptable within
the claimed hematocrit range and support the claimed hematocrit range of 20 to 60%.
The sponsor conducted an additional hematocrit evaluation with 22 neonate capillary
blood samples with glucose concentrations ranging from 10-50 mg/dL and hematocrit
levels from 50 – 65%. The data demonstrates no affect from high hematocrit levels at
low glucose concentrations, as is expected to occur in the neonatal population. The
data supports the claimed hematocrit range from 20-60%.
3. Infection control studies: The FORA ADVANCED GD-40 meter is intended for
single-patient use, and the FORA ADVANCED GD-40 pro meter is intended for
multiple-patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials
comprising the meters by an outside commercial laboratory service to demonstrate
complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with Micro-Kill Wipes (EPA Reg.
No. 59894-10-37549). Robustness studies were performed by the sponsor
demonstrating that there was no change in performance or in external materials of the
meters after 10,950 cleaning and disinfection cycles with Micro-Kill Wipes. The
robustness studies were designed to simulate 3 years of multiple-patient use and 5
years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the
validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
4. Sample volume study: A sample volume study was performed using venous whole
blood samples. Three samples were spiked to glucose concentrations of 39 mg/dL,
133 mg/dL and 325 mg/dL, as measured by YSI, to evaluate the effect of different
sample volumes (0.7 mL, 0.8 mL, 0.9 mL, 1.0 mL, 1.1 mL, and 1.2 mL) on the glucose
21

--- Page 22 ---
performance of the device. Three samples were spiked to b-Ketone levels of 0.5, 2.0,
and 4.0 mmol/L, as measured by the b-Hydroxybutyrate LiquiColor method, to
evaluate the effect of different sample volumes (0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3
mmol/L on the b-Ketone performance of the device. Three lots of test strips and 5
meters were used. Results from these studies support the claimed minimum sample
volume of 0.9 mL for glucose and 1.0mL for b-Ketone. The meter displays an error
message (E-F) for both analytes when an insufficient amount of blood sample is
applied. The sponsor provided adequate validation for this error message.
5. Operating Temperature and Humidity: Operating temperature and humidity
conditions were evaluated using four meters and three lots of glucose and ketone test
strips with venous whole blood samples at three glucose concentrations (70 mg/dL,
125 mg/dL, and 320 mg/dL by YSI) and three b-Ketone levels (0.5, 2.0, and 4.0
mmol/L) The following temperature and humidity conditions were tested: 50°F
(10°C)/10% RH, 50°F (10°C)/85% RH, 104°F (40°C)/10%RH, and 104°F
(40°C)/85% RH. The results support the sponsor’s claimed operating temperature
from 50°F to 104°F (10°C - 40°C) and relative humidity range from 10-85%.
6. EMC testing and Electrical Safety Studies: The sponsor provided documentation
certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing (EMC) had been performed and the
System was found compliant.
7. Software documentation: The software documentation was reviewed and found
to be acceptable. The firm provided documentation to support the device was
designed, developed and is under good software lifecycle processes .
8. Readability Assessment: A Flesch-Kinkaid reading level assessment was
conducted demonstrating that the user manual, test strip inserts, and control
inserts were written at or below an 8th grade reading level.
This device was cleared after the FDA issued final guidance documents for prescription
use blood glucose monitoring systems (BGMS) and over-the-counter use blood glucose
monitoring systems (SMBG). However, the recommendations in the guidance
documents were not followed for this device since the submission was received prior to
the finalization of the guidance documents.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
