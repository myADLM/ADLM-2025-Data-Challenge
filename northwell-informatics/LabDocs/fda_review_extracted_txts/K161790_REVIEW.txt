L. Test Principle:
The iGlucose Blood Glucose Monitoring System measures glucose amperometrically. The
reaction of glucose oxidase and potassium ferricyanide in the test strip with glucose in the
sample produces an electrical current which is proportional to the amount of glucose in the
sample. The meter measures the current and converts it to the corresponding glucose
concentration, which is displayed on the meter.

Within-run precision studies were performed using venous whole blood samples of 5
glucose levels (30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250, 251-400 mg/dL). Samples were
tested ten times with each of three lots of single test strips with 10 meters for a total
of 300 tests per glucose concentration and a grand total of 1500 tests.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was assessed with three lots of iGlucose Blood Glucose Test Strips. Each
test strip lot was tested with three iGlucose Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems using
blood samples spiked to 14 target analyte levels (19.7, 24.2, 43.4, 87.8, 144.0, 204,
256, 313, 358.5, 439, 486, 536, 561, 623.5 mg/dL). Each sample was measured in
triplicate with each iGlucose Blood Glucose Monitoring System and measured in
duplicate with a laboratory-based comparator method (YSI 2300 glucose analyzer).
The evaluation yielded the following regression equations for the three lots based on
all samples:
Y = 0.9952x – 0.4743, R2= 0.9996
Y = 0.9808x – 2.2286, R2= 0.9996
Y = 0.9889x – 3.0475, R2= 0.9997
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 20-
600 mg/dL. The meter displays “Lo” with glucose values below 20mg/dL, and “HI”
with glucose values over 600 mg/dL. The “Lo” and “Hi” functions were validated and
demonstrated to function as intended.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The iGlucose Blood Glucose Monitoring System is s traceable to the NIST SRM 917c
glucose reference material.
Test Strip Stability
Test Strip stability has been evaluated through accelerated and real-time open vial and
closed vial studies. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The manufacturer claims shelf life stability and open vial stability of 24
months from manufacture when stored at 40- 86°F (4-30˚C) and 10-90% relative
humidity.
d. Detection limit:
See the linearity studies (section M.1.b.) above.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference was evaluated at two glucose concentration intervals (60-100 and 150-300
mg/dL) by analyzing 19 potentially interfering exogenous and endogenous. Glucose
values measured with the iGlucose Blood Glucose Monitoring System in samples spiked
with a potentially interfering substance were compared with values measured in control
samples (without potentially interfering substance) on the iGlucose Blood Glucose
Monitoring System. The sponsor defined significant interference as of bias greater than
±10% (vs control condition). The compounds at the concentrations listed below did not
demonstrate significant interference:
Based on these results, the sponsor includes the following in their test strip labeling:

Methyldopa 1.6
Salicylate 20
Tetracycline 1.5
Tolbutamide 100
Triglyceride 1500
Uric acid 9
Xylose 100
High concentrations of Uric acid >9 mg/dL, Cholesterol >600 mg/dL, and Ascorbic acid
(Vitamin C) >5 mg/dL may interfere with the glucose test causing inaccurate test results.
Certain conditions may cause your blood level of uric acid to rise. These conditions
include gout or kidney disease. This means that when the uric acid concentration in your
blood is greater than 9 mg/dL you may get inaccurate and unreliable glucose results.
Please check with your doctor before using the iGlucose Blood Glucose Monitoring
System.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip,
palm or forearm. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary
action.
5. Calibration:
There is no calibration required by the user for the iGlucose Blood Glucose Monitoring
System. The meter is automatically coded when the test strip is inserted into the meter.
6. Quality Control:
Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. An
acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial labels. The user is
cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges. Control
results are stored along with the blood results. The control solution tests are
differentiated by a control solution symbol.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Sample Volume Study
To evaluate the minimal sample volume of the blood glucose test strips accuracy of the
system with blood volumes of 0.60 µL, 0.65 µL, 0.70 µL, 0.75 µL, 0.80 µL, 1.00 µL, 1.25
µL, 2.00 µL, and 3.00 µL was assessed. Three blood glucose meters were used in this
assessment and three lots of test strips to evaluate three blood glucose concentrations (50-75,
80 – 120 mg/dL, and 270 – 330 mg/dL). This testing supported the claimed sample volume
of 0.75 for this device and that the sample detection feature functioned appropriately when
the sample volume was <0.75uL.
2. Altitude Study
To evaluate the effects of altitude, three test strip lots were tested with 3 meters using three whole
blood samples with glucose concentrations of 47.5-52.5, 92-100, and 283-307 mg/dL. The
samples were tested at 0, 1000, 2000, and 3275 meters above sea level. Results obtained were
compared with those obtained with a laboratory-based comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer).
The results demonstrate acceptable bias relative to the comparator method to support the claim in
the labeling that altitudes up to 10,745 ft. (3275 meters) do not affect device performance..
3. Hematocrit Study
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using whole blood. iGlucose Blood
Glucose Monitoring System was tested with venous blood at six glucose concentration
intervals (20-50, 60-80, 135-165, 180-220, 270-330 and 360-440 mg/dL) and nine hematocrit
levels (10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 55, 60, 65 and 70%). Each sample was measured in five replicates
for each of three test strip lots also with an established a laboratory-based comparator method
(YSI 2300). The average, standard deviation and coefficient of variance for above replicates
in each test strip lot were calculated. Results of samples at each hematocrit level were
11

--- Page 12 ---
compared to samples measured with an established a laboratory-based comparator method
(YSI 2300) and support the claimed hematocrit range of 20-60%.
4. Test System Operating Conditions
Three iGlucose Blood Glucose Monitoring System Meters were used to test venous blood
sample with three lots of blood glucose test strips. Six test conditions were used in this study:
50 °C/ 10% RH, 50 °C/ 90% RH, 77 °C/ 10% RH, 77 °C/ 90% RH, 104 °C/ 10% RH, 104
°C/ 90% RH. The protocol and acceptance criteria for this test were found to be acceptable.
The results supported the sponsor’s claimed operating conditions of 50 °F-104 °F and a
relative humidity range of 10% to 90%.
5. Readability Assessment
A readability assessment indicated a Flesch-Kincaid Score of 8 and lower for all instructional
materials included with this device.
6. EMC Testing
The sponsor provided appropriate documentation certifying that electromagnetic (EMC)
testing was performed and the device systems were found to be compliant.
7. Infection Control Studies
The device is intended for a single-patient use only. The disinfection efficacy was performed
on the materials comprising the meter demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B
virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfecting agent, Cavi Wipes disinfecting towelettes (EPA
Number 46781-8). Robustness studies were performed by the sponsor demonstrating that
there was no change in performance or external materials of the meter after 550 cleaning and
disinfection cycles (representing disinfection of the meter 8 times a month for 5 years, the
expected lifetime of the meter) with Cavi Wipes disinfecting towelettes (EPA Number
46781-8). The subject device abeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the
l
validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
8. This device was cleared after the FDA issued final guidance documents for prescription
use blood glucose monitoring systems (BGMS) and over-the-counter use blood glucose
monitoring systems (SMBG). However, the recommendations in the guidance documents
were not followed for this device since the submission was received prior to the finalization
of the guidance documents.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The proposed labeling for this device is sufficient and satisfies the requirements for 21 CFR
Part 809.10.
