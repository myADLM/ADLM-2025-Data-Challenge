4. Panel:
83 Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
BD BACTEC Standard/10 Aerobic/F culture vials (enriched Soybean-Casein Digest
broth with CO ) are for aerobic blood cultures. Principal use is with the BD BACTEC
2
fluorescent series instruments for the qualitative culture and recovery of aerobic
microorganisms (bacteria and yeast) from blood.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use
Limitations:
Recovery of SPS Sensitive Organisms from Blood Samples
Because blood can neutralize the toxicity of SPS toward organisms sensitive to SPS, the
recommendation of maximum volumes of blood (8–10 mL) can help to optimize recovery
of these organisms.
Some fastidious organisms, such as certain Haemophilus species, require growth factors,
such as NAD, or factor V, which are provided by the blood specimen. If the blood
specimen volume is 3.0 mL or less, an appropriate supplement may be required for
recovery of these organisms. BD BACTEC FOS™, Fastidious Organism Supplement,
may be used as a nutritional supplement. Recovery of Haemophilus parainfluenzae is
strain dependent.
General Considerations
The default 5-day (120 hours) protocol was utilized for all analytical testing with the BD
BACTEC Standard/10 Aerobic/F culture media and protocol lengths of >5 days have not
been evaluated.
4. Special instrument requirements:
BACTEC fluorescent series instruments BACTEC 9050, BACTEC 9240, BACTEC FX,
and BACTEC FX40 using software versions listed below:

BACTEC FX 40 V2.51B
I. Device Description:
The blood sample to be tested is inoculated into one or more vials which are inserted into the
BACTEC fluorescent series instrument for incubation and periodic reading. Each vial
contains a chemical sensor which can detect increases in CO produced by the growth of
2
microorganisms. The sensor is monitored by the instrument every ten minutes for an increase
in its fluorescence, which is proportional to the amount of CO present. A positive reading
2
indicates the presumptive presence of viable microorganisms in the vial. Detection is limited
to microorganisms that will grow in a particular type of medium.

L. Test Principle:
The BD BACTEC Standard/10 Aerobic/F medium is an enriched soybean- casein digest
broth, with each vial containing 40 mL of broth. The formulation is specifically designed to
enhance the recovery of aerobic microorganisms from blood. Yeast extract is added to the
soy casein digest base to supplement the B-vitamin concentrations. Menadione and hemin are
added to fortify the medium; sucrose is added to the broth to enhance recovery of fastidious
fermentative bacteria (Streptococci), Staphylocci and yeast. Sodium polyanetholesulfonate
(SPS) is added to the medium as an anticoagulant and compliment fixation inhibitor.
Each BD BACTEC Standard/10 Aerobic/F blood culture medium vial contains a chemical
sensor in a silicon rubber base that can detect increases in CO produced by the growth of
2
microorganisms. Three to seven mL of blood is inoculated into the BD BACTEC
Standard/10 Aerobic/F blood culture medium vial, which is inserted into the BD BACTEC
Fluorescent Series instrument for incubation, agitation and periodic measurement. When
microorganisms are present in the blood sample, they metabolize nutrients in the culture
medium, releasing CO into the medium. A dye in the sensor reacts with the CO , modulating
2 2
the amount of light that is absorbed by the fluorescent material in the sensor. The
instrument’s photo detectors monitor the sensor every 10 minutes and measure the level of
fluorescence, which is proportional to the amount of CO present in the vial. Positivity of a
2
vial is determined by algorithms resident in the instrument rack’s microprocessor. The
algorithms use the rate of CO production as well as the absolute increase in CO to interpret
2 2
the data.
Culture vials flagged as presumptively positive are removed from the instrument for
subculture and Gram stain in order to identify the microorganisms for further evaluation and
proposed patient treatment. Culture vials that are not flagged as positive remain in the

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The BACTEC Standard/10 Aerobic/F (plastic) vial was evaluated across three lots in
the Time To Detection (TTD) and the Percent Recovery (Detection) studies. Different
lots of key raw materials were used to manufacture each lot of culture media. The
actual inoculum level of 0-1, 2-10, and >10 CFU were used in the analysis. The actual
inoculum level was determined on the basis of growth observed on non-selective agar
plate. The time to detection results are presented in Table 2.

* No growth observed on non-selective media for inoculum verification due to sampling imprecision at low target
inoculum level of 1 CFU/vial.
The percent recovery results stratified by lot (combining blood volumes, inoculum
levels, organisms, and instruments) are shown in Table 3.

Streptococcus pneumoniae* ATCC 6305
Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615
*Specified in CLSI Standard, Quality Control for Commercially Prepared
Microbiological Culture Media
There were a total of 150 replicates of these nine QC organisms for the study. Each
organism was tested for either 15 (5 replicates x 3 lots) or 18 (6 replicates x 3 lots)
replicates. All organisms were detected <72 hours, with mean ranges from 9.7 hours
(E. coli) to 26.1 hours (Neisseria meningitidis).
d. Detection limit:
Microbial Detection Limit (MDL, target inoculum level 0- 1, 1- 10 CFU/vial)
The microbial detection limit study was conducted to assess the capability of the
culture media to detect low numbers of organisms (expected target level of 0-1 and 1-
10 CFU/vial) when present in blood. The study included 15 organisms tested at two
blood volumes (3 and 10 mL), each with two inoculum levels of 0-1 and 1-10
CFU/vial and across three lots by two instruments (BACTEC FX and BACTEC
9240):
15 org x 3 lots x 2 blood vol x 2 inoculum levels x 2 instruments= 360
Results for target inoculum levels of 0-1 and 1-10 CFU/vial are provided in Tables
4.1 and 4.2 respectively. The percent recovery, difference between predicate and the
new plastic bottles (henceforth referred to as Modified) was calculated with 95% two-
sided bootstrap confidence intervals and stratified by organism for each target
inoculum level. The combined performance of 0-1 and 1-10 is provided in Table 4.3.

The MDL study demonstrated that the modified plastic device performed equivalently
when compared to the predicate glass device at low target inoculum levels. However,
none of the 24 paired sets of Haemophilus parainfluenzae ATCC 33392 were
detected in the modified plastic or the predicate glass vials. The culture medium of
BD BACTEC Standard/10 Aerobic/F does not support the growth of H.
parainfluenzae at low target inoculum of 0-1 or 1-10 CFU/vial. Information about
this organism was noted as a limiatation in labeling.

e. Analytical specificity:
Not applicable
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
Performance of the BD BACTEC Standard/10 Aerobic/F (plastic) blood culture vials was
evaluated in seeded internal analytical studies to demonstrate comparable performance to
the predicate device, the BD BACTEC Standard/10 Aerobic/F (glass) blood culture vials.
Comparison results were acceptable. The comparisons were made using the following
parameters: time to detection, percent recovery, false negative rate, and false positive. For
statistical analysis, 95% two-sided bootstrap confidence intervals for differences between
the modified and the predicate devices were used.
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Instrument Time to Detection (TTD) study
The TTD (in hours) was recorded as part of the combined Percent recovery and the
Microbial Detection Limit studies using the BD BACTEC FX and 9240 instruments at
three inoculum levels, across two blood volumes (3 mL and 10 mL) over three media
lots. The Percent Recovery study represented by the standard inoculum of 10 to 100 CFU
per vial and the Microbial Detection Limit study represented by the challenge inoculum
levels of 0 to 1 and 1 to 10 CFU per vial.
The TTD data was also analyzed by target inoculum level, blood volume or lot numbers.
The results are shown in Tables 5.1- 5.4. The results for all data combined are shown in
Table 5.5

Percent Recovery (Detection) Study
The percent recovery (detection) was evaluated in a study of 984 paired sets at the
standard inoculum level of 10 to 100 CFU/vial on four instruments across three lots using
a diverse set of microorganisms frequently isolated in blood.
41 org x 3 lots x 2 blood vol x 4 instruments= 984 paired sets

Additional Testing
a) Candida spp.
A study was conducted to evaluate TTD of Candida species other than C. albicans.
The study included two strains each for Candida tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and one
strain each for C. glabrata, Cryptococcus neoformans at target inoculum level of 10-
100 CFU with two blood volumes (3 and 10 mL) tested on four instruments (9050,
9240, FX, and FX40). The TTD results for all data combined are shown in Table 6.3.

The study demonstrated that the modified plastic device performed equivalently when
compared to the predicate glass device.
b) Haemophilus parainfluenzae
Five well-characterized H. parainfluenzae strains were tested to evaluate recovery in
both the predicate glass and the modified plastic device. The isolates were tested in
triplicates with three blood volumes (3, 5, and 10 mL), two instruments (9240, FX) at
10-100 CFU/vial, resulting in 90 paired sets. The result is provided in Table 6.4.

The recovery of H. parainfluenzae varied from 0% to 94% and 6% to 100% for
modified plastic and predicate glass respectively. The modified plastic device
performed equivalently when compared to the predicate glass device.
The text below was added to the existing limitation for Haemophilus species in the
Recovery of SPS Sensitive Organisms from Blood Samples section of the package
insert:
“Recovery of Haemophilus parainfluenzae is strain dependent.”
Further, the study result was also described in the Performance Characteristics section
of the package insert:

“In an additional seeded study with five Haemophilus parainfluenzae strains
tested with blood volumes 3, 5, and 10 mL at target inoculum 10–100 CFU,
recovery rate was strain dependent and varies from 0% to 94% for plastic vial and
from 6% to 100% for glass vial.”
False Positive Rates (Instrument-positive, subculture-negative)
False positive was defined as instrument positive but subculture negative in the
evaluation. False positivity was assessed with vials inoculated with fresh human blood of
2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mL, but no organisms were added to the vials. There were a total of 240
pair sets across three lots using BACTEC FX and BACTEC 9240 and completed at the
default 5-day protocol.
40 vials x 3 lots x 2 instruments= 240 paired sets
There was no positive observed in the predicate glass vial; one positive (instrument
positive and subculture positive) was observed in the modified plastic vial on BACTEC
FX at 16.98 hours. The organism was viridans group streptococcus (Streptococcus
salivarius) which likely was a contaminant introduced during the inoculation process.
The performance is shown in Table 7.

The modified device performed equivalently when compared to the predicate device in
the false positive study.
False Negative Rates (Instrument-negative, subculture-positive)
All inoculated paired sets (984 from the Recovery study + 360 from the Microbial
Detection Limit study =1344) that were instrument negative at the end of default protocol
(120 hours) were subcultured onto appropriate culture media plates. This combined data
set was evaluated for the false negative rates. A false negative is a vial that was
instrument-negative at the end of protocol yet contains viable organisms upon
subculturing onto appropriate culture media. There were a total of 91 paired sets where
both the modified and the predicate devices were negative at 120 hours; there were 41
sets where the predicate device only detected (i.e., 41 modified plastic vials subcultured)
and 57 vials where the new device detected (i.e., 57 predicate glass vials subcultured).
There were 34 false negatives; 18 (12 at 10 to 100 CFU) that were observed in the
predicate glass vials and 16 (9 at 10-100 CFU) in the modified plastic vial. The 16 false
negatives included one each for Candida glabrata, Haemophilus influenzae, and
Pediococcus acidilactici, two Cryptococcus neoformans and 11 Haemophilus
parainfluenzae. The modified device performed equivalently when compared to the
predicate device in the false negative study.

The false negatives of the modified plastic vial is noted in the Performance
Characteristics section of the package insert:
“Sixteen false negatives across all inoculum levels were identified within the BD
BACTEC Standard/10 Aerobic/F medium contained in a plastic vial: Candida
glabrata (1) Cryptococcus neoformans (2), Haemophilus influenzae (1),
Haemophilus parainfluenzae biotype I (11), and Pediococcus acidilactici (1). Of
the eleven Haemophilus parainfluezae biotype I, six inoculated at 82 CFU and
five inoculated at 2 CFU.”
BD BACTEC Instrument Compatibility Study
The BACTEC instrument compatibility study was evaluated from the Percent Recovery
study (i.e., 984 paired sets) dataset across four fluorescent- series instruments: BD
BACTEC FX, FX40, 9240, and 9050. The study included 3 and 10 mL of blood at
inoculum level of 10-100 CFU per vial. The BACTEC instrument compatibility study is
shown in Table 8.

The study demonstrated that the four instruments performed equivalently and they are
compatible with BD BACTEC Standard/10 Aerobic/F culture medium in plastic vials.
b. Matrix comparison:
In seeded analytical studies, the performance of BD BACTEC Standard/10 Aerobic/F
culture medium in plastic vial was compared to that in glass vial, with two human
blood volumes, 38 common blood bloodstream bacteria and five yeasts across four
fluorescent series instruments: BACTEC FX, FX40, BACTEC 9240, and BACTEC
9050.
3. Clinical studies:
Not applicable; seeded analytical studies to compare the new plastic blood culture vials to
the glass blood culture vials (predicate).
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
