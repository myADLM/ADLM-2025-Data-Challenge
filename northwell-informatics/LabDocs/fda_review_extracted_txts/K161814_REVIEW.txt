H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Solana® Influenza A+B Assay is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the
detection and differentiation of influenza A and influenza B viral RNA in nasal and
nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection.
This test is intended for use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of influenza A and
influenza B viral infections in humans in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological
risk factors. The assay does not detect the presence of influenza C virus.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the
sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the spring of 2016
when influenza A/H3 and 2009 H1N1 influenza were the predominant influenza A
viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance
characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture
should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and
culture specimens.

I. Device Description:
The Solana Influenza A+B Assay amplifies and detects viral RNA present in viral transport
media containing nasopharyngeal or nasal swab specimens obtained from symptomatic
patients.
The assay consists of two major steps: 1) specimen preparation, and 2) amplification and
detection of target sequences specific to influenza A and/or influenza B using isothermal
Reverse Transcriptase - Helicase-Dependent Amplification (RT-HDA) in the presence of
target-specific fluorescence probes.
A patient nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimen in viral transport media is transferred to a
Process Buffer Tube subjected to heat treatment at 95°C for 5 minutes and mixed. The
processed sample is transferred to a Reaction Tube. The Reaction Tube contains lyophilized
RT-HDA reagents, dNTPs, primers and probes. Once rehydrated with the processed sample,
the Reaction Tube is placed in the Solana instrument for amplification and detection of
influenza A and influenza B-specific target sequences. In the Solana instrument, the target
sequences are amplified by influenza A and influenza B specific primers and detected by
influenza A and influenza B specific fluorescence probes, respectively. A competitive
process control (PRC) is included in the Process Buffer Tube to monitor sample processing,
inhibitory substances in clinical samples, reagent failure, or device failure. The PRC target is
amplified by influenza B specific primers and detected by a PRC specific fluorescence probe.
The two target probes and PRC probe are labeled with a quencher on one end and a
fluorophore on the other end. In addition, the two target probes and PRC probe have one or
more bases that are comprised of ribonucleic acid. Upon annealing to influenza A, influenza
B or PRC amplicons, the fluorescence probes are cleaved by RNaseH2 and the fluorescence
signal increases due to physical separation of fluorophore from quencher. Solana measures
and interprets the fluorescent signal, using on-board method-specific algorithms. Solana then
reports the test results to the user on its display screen, and it can print out the results via an
integrated printer.
The assay kit consists of 48 Process Buffer tubes and 48 Reaction Tubes.

L. Test Principle:
The Solana® Influenza A+B assay detects viral RNA in nasal and nasopharyngeal specimens.
A specimen is collected by a healthcare provider and is placed in viral transport medium to
be transported to a clinical laboratory. Once received in the laboratory, the sample is
vortexed and 50-µL of the specimen is transferred to a Process Buffer Tube containing lysis
buffer. The sample is heated to lyse the cells and expose the RNA. An aliquot of the diluted
sample is transferred to the Solana Reaction Tube containing lyophilized HDA reagents,
dNTPs, primers, and probes, which are rehydrated upon addition of the diluted sample. The
Reaction Tube is placed in the Solana instrument for amplification of the influenza A and
influenza B-specific target sequences. The detection is achieved through fluorescence from
specific fluorophore labeled probes. The entire reaction takes place at 65°C. A competitive
process control (PRC) is included in the lysis tube to monitor sample processing, inhibitory
substances, reagent failure, or device failure. The PRC target is amplified by influenza B
specific primers and detected by a PRC specific fluorescent probe.

a. Analytical Sensitivity (Limit of Detection)
An approximate limit of detection (LoD) concentration for the Solana® Influenza A+B
assay was established during earlier range finding studies. The final LoD was evaluated
in a study using three influenza A and two influenza B strains that were cultured and
titered prior to the study. The viruses were serially diluted in negative nasal matrix to
concentrations ranging from below to above the predicted LoD levels. The dilutions were
tested in 20 replicates with the Solana Influenza A+B assay according to the instructions
for use. The study was performed using multiple Solana instruments. The experiments
included a positive and a negative control for each setup. The LoD was defined as
concentration where at least 19 of the 20 replicates were positive for the given virus. The
summary of results is shown below.

b. Precision (Repeatability)
The repeatability of the Solana Influenza A+B assay was evaluated by testing a four
sample panel in triplicate twice daily for twelve non-consecutive days by two operators.
Each of the spiked panel members contained Influenza A (A/California/07/2009) and
influenza B (B/Brisbane/60/08). A negative sample consisting of unspiked clinical matrix
was included in the panel. The samples were prepared at the following targeted
concentration:
1. Low positive (1x LoD)
2. Moderate Positive (2x LoD)
3. High Negative (below LoD, expected positivity 20-80% of the time)
4. Negative (matrix, no virus spiked)
The summary of the results is shown below.

c. Reproducibility
The reproducibility of the Solana Influenza A+B assay was evaluated by testing the four-
sample panel (as described above) in triplicate twice daily for five non-consecutive days
by two operators at three testing locations.
A four sample panel consisting of three levels of a combined influenza A and influenza B
contrived samples and a negative contrived sample were tested in this study. Influenza A
and influenza B viruses (Influenza A/California/07/2009 and Influenza B/Brisbane/60/08,
respectively) were diluted in negative nasal matrix to 2 x LOD for moderate positive, 1 x
LOD for low positive and to C20 to C80 for high negative / low positive (as described
above). Negative nasal matrix without spiked virus was used for the negative sample. The
Solana Influenza A+B assay was used according to the instructions for use.
Panels and controls were tested at each site by two operators per instrument for five days,
with each sample tested in three replicates, for a total of 90 results per concentration level
for each virus for each instrument (2 operators x 5 days x 3 sites x 3 replicates).

that influenza A and influenza B are stable in transport media BD UTM, Remel M4,
Remel M4RT, Remel M5, and Remel M6 at 2° to 8°C for up to 9 days.
Influenza A and influenza B are stable in Copan eSwab transport medium at 2 to 8°C for
up to 48 hours; this was added to the warnings section in the package insert.
f. Fresh vs. Frozen Stability
The stability of frozen viral RNA stored at -70°C was evaluated by testing a four sample
panel consisting of three levels of a combined influenza A and influenza B contrived
samples in clinical matrix; a negative sample consisted of nasal matrix without spiked
virus. Influenza A and Influenza B (Influenza A/California/07/2009 and Influenza
B/Brisbane/60/08, respectively) were diluted to 2x LOD for moderate positive, 1x LOD
for low positive, and to C20 to C80 concentration for a high negative.
Eight replicates of each panel member were tested at the time of preparation. The
qualitative result was recorded for each replicate. After storage at -70°C for 78 days,
eight replicates of each panel member were tested with the Solana Influenza A+B assay
according to the instructions for use and the qualitative result was recorded for each
replicate. Using the Qiagen Studio Software, Detection times (Dt) were established for
each positive replicate (this information is not available to the user).

room temperature, and -20°C) prior the heat step and analysis with the Solana instrument.
Test samples consisted of pooled negative matrix spiked with Influenza A and B strains
(Influenza A/California/07/2009 and Influenza B/Brisbane/60/08, respectively) at 2x
LOD concentrations. The samples (50 μL) were added to the Process Buffer and vortexed
for 5 seconds, according to the Solana Influenza A+B assay procedure. The tubes were
then placed at each of the designated temperatures for a defined time. All samples were
tested in three replicates at each time point: 0 (analyzed without delay), 3 minutes, 10
minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours at each of the storage temperature
conditions. The Solana® Influenza A+B assay results were positive for all samples tested
at each time point after storage at the three evaluated temperatures. The results showed
that samples remain reactive after the buffer processing when stored for further analysis
for up to 48 hours at 2 to 8°C, 25°C and -20°C.
h. Processed Sample Stability - Post heating
Sample stability was evaluated for specimens that were added to the Solana® Influenza
A+B Process Buffer, and heated, following by storage at three temperatures (2 to 8°C,
room temperature, and -20°C) before the analysis step with the Solana instrument.
Test samples consisted of pooled negative matrix spiked with Influenza A and B strains
(Influenza A/California/07/2009 and Influenza B/Brisbane/60/08, respectively) at 2x
LOD concentrations. The samples were added to the Process Buffer followed by heating
according to the Solana Influenza A+B assay procedure, and then placed at each of the
designated temperatures for a defined time. All samples were tested in three replicates at
each time point: 0 (analyzed without delay), 3 minutes, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, 24
hours, and 48 hours at each of the storage temperature conditions. The Solana® Influenza
A+B assay results were positive for all samples tested at each time point after storage at
the three evaluated temperatures. The results showed that samples remain reactive after
the buffer processing and heating steps when stored for further analysis for up to 48 hours
at 2 to 8°C, 25°C and -20°C.
i. Assay Cutoff
The cutoff value for the Solana® Influenza A+B assay was determined based on specific
parameters of the amplification curve calculated from negative samples and contrived
positive samples at concentrations near the LoD. These parameters included the slope of
the amplification curve for samples near the LoD (“slope threshold”) and the time
required to reach the slope threshold. The cutoff was set based on the longest amount of
time to obtain a positive amplification result.
j. Analytical Reactivity (inclusivity)
The reactivity of the Solana Influenza A+B Assay was evaluated against multiple strains
of influenza A and influenza B viruses. The influenza panel consisted of 14 influenza A
strains, and 8 Influenza B strains diluted in clinical matrix to concentrations near the level
of detection (LoD) of the assay. The samples were tested in triplicate with the Solana
Influenza A+B assay. The study utilized multiple Solana instruments and each run
included a positive and a negative control.

*A review of the Port Chalmers sequence with the Solana primers/probes does not indicate any potential issues. The
apparent increased concentration may be due to the starting concentration of the virus that was slightly lower than
published.
Due to restrictions and availability of a number of influenza A strains, in silico analysis
was performed for three additional strain designations:
• A total of four H3N2v (1 human strain and 3 swine) sequences were analyzed in
silico. All four sequences demonstrated 100% homology.
• A total of 340 H5N1 strains were analyzed in silico. Three hundred thirty-nine
(339) strains in the database demonstrated ≥95% overall homology and ≥88%

• A total of 164 H7N9 sequences were analyzed in silico. All 164 sequences
demonstrated 100% homology.
The sponsor conducted an in silico inclusivity analysis for 14 influenza A viruses found
in birds (avian viruses). The primers and probe were aligned to the 27 sequences yielded
by the search and the homology percentages were calculated. The Solana Flu A primers
and probe are 90-100% homologous to the genomes of the tested avian strains shown in
the table below.

k. Analytical Specificity
Cross-Reactivity
A study was conducted to demonstrate that the Solana® Influenza A+B Assay does not
produce false positive results in the presence of microorganisms that may be present in
specimens collected from nasal passages of patients symptomatic for influenza. A panel
of 44 microorganisms (24 bacteria, 1 yeast, 19 viruses) was tested in the Solana Influenza
A+B Assay (in the absence of influenza A or influenza B). All microorganisms tested
were pre-titered. Each organism was spiked into pooled negative nasal matrix such that
the concentration was ≥1x105 TCID /mL for viruses or ≥1x106 CFU/mL for bacteria,
50
except for Chlamydophila pneumoniae (5x104 CFU/mL), Streptococcus pneumoniae
(1x105 CFU/mL), and Enterovirus 71 (2x104 TCID /mL) because of lower stock titers.
50
The samples were tested in 3 replicates with the Solana Influenza A+B assay according to
the instructions for use. The study was performed using multiple Solana instruments. The
experiments included a positive and a negative control for each setup.
All 44 microorganisms tested negative for influenza A and influenza B using the Solana
Influenza A+B assay. The organisms tested and their concentrations are listed in the table below.

It was also shown that high concentrations of influenza A did not cross-react with
influenza B and high concentrations of influenza B did not cross-react with influenza A
in the Solana Influenza A+B assay. Each virus evaluated for cross-reactivity was spiked
into pooled negative nasal matrix at 1x105 TCID /mL and the samples were tested with
50
the Solana Influenza A+B assay in 3 replicates according to the instructions for use. No
cross-reactivity was observed. The results are summarized below.

Microbial Interference
A study was conducted to demonstrate that organisms that may be present in specimens
collected from nasal passages of patients symptomatic for influenza do not interfere with
the detection of influenza A or influenza B in the Solana® Influenza A+B Assay.
A panel of 44 potentially interfering microorganisms (24 bacteria, 1 yeast and 19 viruses)
was tested with the Solana Influenza A+B assay in triplicate in the presence of influenza
A and influenza B viruses. Each microorganism was diluted in negative nasal matrix to
the desired concentration (106 or higher CFU/mL for bacteria and yeast, and 105 or higher
pfu/mL or TCID /mL for viruses). Each sample was spiked with influenza A and
50
influenza B viruses (Influenza A/California/07/2009 and Influenza B/Brisbane/60/08,
respectively) for a final concentration equal to 2x LOD. Each sample was tested in 3
replicates with the Solana Influenza A+B assay according to the instructions for use.
The study also included samples designed to test whether the detection of influenza A is
affected in the presence of Influenza B, and vice versa. One sample was spiked with
influenza A at 1.0x105 TCID /mL concentration in the presence of influenza B at a low
50
concentration (2x LoD) and another sample was spiked with influenza B at 1.0x105
TCID /mL concentration in the presence of influenza A at a low concentration (2x LoD).

No microbial interference was observed. The organisms included in the interference
study are shown in the table below.

l. Carryover
A study was conducted to verify that the Solana® Influenza A+B assay is not prone to
sample cross-contamination and amplicon carryover. Six highly concentrated samples
were run in alternating sequence with 6 negative samples in 5 separate runs on the Solana
instrument. Positive samples were contrived in nasal clinical matrix at concentrations
greater or equal to 1x105 TCID /mL for influenza A (A/Taiwan/42/06) and for influenza
50
B (B/Panama/45/90). Negative samples consisted of pooled negative nasal matrix. All
positive influenza A and influenza B samples tested positive and all negative samples
tested negative in all runs. No carryover was observed. The results are summarized
below.
Carryover Study
Input # Run # Positive % Positive
Influenza A 30 30 100%
Influenza B 30 30 100%
Negative Matrix 30 0 0%
m. Controls
The Solana Influenza A+B Assay contains an internal process control that is included in
the lysis buffer tube and is used to detect HDA inhibitory substances in clinical samples
and to confirm the integrity of assay reagents and the operation of the Solana instrument.
The internal control monitors the entire extraction, amplification and detection process.
The Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B Control Set is available as an accessory to the
assay and consists of a mixture of highly purified, inactivated strains of Influenza A/New
Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1), Influenza B/Florida/04/06 and an influenza RNA‐free matrix.
The controls are intended to be used in the same manner as patient samples and monitor
for substantial reagent and instrument failure. The Positive control is manufactured at
concentrations near the LoD of the assay. The Negative control serves to detect reagent
or environment contamination by influenza A or B RNA or amplicons.
2. Clinical study:
A multi-center field clinical study was conducted between February and April 2016 to
evaluate the performance characteristics of the Solana® Influenza A+B Assay with nasal
and nasopharyngeal swabs from 1473 patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory
infection. A single nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimen (302 and 1171, respectively)
was collected from each patient and placed in viral transport media (BD/Copan UTM,
Remel M5, or Remel M6). All specimens were processed and tested with the Solana
Influenza A+B assay on the Solana instrument at the clinical sites. Of the 1473 collected

specimens, 742 specimens were tested fresh, while 731were frozen and stored at -70°C
prior to testing with the Solana Influenza A+B Assay.
An aliquot of each fresh specimen was transported at 2°C to 8°C to a central location for
testing by the comparator methods. Sensitivity and specificity estimates were calculated
using a Composite Reference Method that consisted of direct specimen fluorescent
antibody (DSFA) test and culture with DFA (using R-Mix Too mixed cells and the D3
Duet™ DFA Influenza A / Respiratory Virus Screening Kit from Diagnostic Hybrids). A
specimen was considered positive if either test was positive.
Each sample was also tested with a FDA cleared molecular influenza A/B assay for
calculations of percent agreement between the two devices. The testing with the
molecular comparator involved extraction with the NucliSENS® easyMAG® followed by
testing with a FDA-cleared Influenza A+B molecular assay.

a. Clinical Performance of the Solana Influenza A+B Assay against Culture with DFA and
DSFA
There were 1473 specimens tested with the Solana Influenza A+B assay and with the
comparator, viral culture with DFA and also with DSFA. A specimen was recorded as
positive for influenza A or B if either comparator test was positive. All comparator
testing was performed on fresh specimens within 72-hours of their collection. Of the
1473 specimens collected at the clinical sites, 742 were tested fresh with the Solana assay
while 731 were frozen and stored at -70°C prior to testing with the Solana Influenza A+B
assay. Of the specimens tested, 65 specimens were excluded from data analysis (15
specimens were contaminated or toxic in the cell culture and 50 specimens were invalid
in the Solana Assay) leaving 1408 evaluable specimens for calculations of sensitivity and
specificity, as shown below.

b. Clinical Performance of the Solana Influenza A+B Assay Compared with FDA Cleared
Molecular Influenza A+B Assay
There were 1473 specimens tested with the Solana Influenza A+B assay and with a FDA-
cleared influenza A+B molecular comparator assay. All comparator testing was
performed on fresh specimens within 72-hours of their collection and utilized extraction
of nucleic acids with the NucliSENS® easyMAG®. Of the 1473 specimens collected at
the clinical sites, 742 were tested fresh with the Solana assay while 731 were frozen and
stored at -70°C prior to testing with the Solana Influenza A+B assay. Eighty specimens
were excluded from data analysis due to invalid results (31 specimens were invalid in the
comparator assay (2.1%) and 50 specimens were invalid in the Solana® Assay (3.4%);
one specimen was invalid in both assays). The positive percent agreement (PPA) and the
negative percent agreement (NPA) of the Solana Influenza A+B Assay results for
influenza A and influenza B, as compared with an FDA cleared molecular comparator for

Specimens are identified by scanning a barcode or by manual entry.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Swab specimens are collected in transport medium. After vortexing, 50μl of the
expressed specimen is transferred to a lysis tube. After heat lysis, 50μl of lysed specimen
is transferred to a reaction tube for automated amplification and detection.
5. Calibration:
The end user is not required to calibrate the instrument.
6. Quality Control:
Process Control:
The process control is used to monitor sample processing, to detect HDA inhibitory
substances, to confirm the integrity of assay reagents and the operation of the Solana
instrument. The process control is included in the Reaction Mix tube and is run with each
sample.
External Controls:
The external controls are available from Quidel as an accessory to the assay. The controls
consist of one vial containing Positive Control and one vial containing Negative Control.
These controls are intended to monitor pre-analytical and environmental factors that
could substantially affect reagent integrity or the instrument function. The negative
control is used to detect reagent or environmental contamination of the system by
influenza A or B RNA or amplicons.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not applicable.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
