The VIRTUO system is the next generation of the bioMérieux BacT/ALERT Microbial
Detection System. This blood culture instrument consists of an incubator, agitation
2

--- Page 3 ---
mechanism, robotic apparatus for automated loading and unloading of bottles and a tactile
graphical interface. VIRTUO is used in conjunction with existing, commercialized
BacT/ALERT reagent bottles for clinical use (BacT/ALERT SA, SN, FA Plus, FN Plus and
PF Plus culture bottles). The VIRTUO system utilizes a colorimetric sensor and reflected light
to monitor the presence and production of carbon dioxide (CO ) dissolved in the culture
2
medium. If microorganisms are present in the inoculated sample, carbon dioxide is produced as
the organisms metabolize the substrates in the culture medium. When growth of the
microorganisms produces CO , the color of the gas-permeable sensor installed in the bottom of
2
each culture bottle changes from blue-green to yellow. The color change results in an increase
of reflectance units monitored by the system. The VIRTUO optically monitors the reflectance
of each bottle over time and will store and interpret readings against algorithms, which are
embedded in the firmware and/or software.
The VIRTUO system is modular with an A Unit, which is the main unit of the instrument and
B Units, which are adjacent to the A Unit and are identical except for the following features:
· A Units can be used alone and have large and small LCD/Touchscreens mounted on
the front chassis. A Units can also support an external PC.
· B Units can only be used in conjunction with an A unit and have only a small
touchscreen display. The bottle loading area of the B Unit includes a removable
plastic housing.
In the Standalone Configuration a customer can have a single (A Unit) instrument or can
have a bank of instruments (A Unit + up to three B Units) that can stand alone or be
connected to a customer network. Each instrument cabinet contains 16 racks with space for
27 bottles per rack for bottle monitoring. Four cells are dedicated for calibration standards.
An instrument (either an A Unit or B Unit) has a total capacity of 432 cells.

M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
Note: FA Plus and PF Plus culture bottles are identical except for bottle labeling and
recommended specimen volume. In addition, the detection algorithms for VIRTUO
and BTA 3D are the same for both bottle types. Therefore PF Plus bottles were not
evaluated in analytical studies and results from FA Plus bottles were used to support
analytical performance of PF plus bottles on VIRTUO.
a. Precision/Reproducibility
Reproducibility Study
The reproducibility of the VIRTUO System was evaluated using six representative
organisms of the most common pathogens associated with blood stream infections.
The study was performed at three sites (1 internal and 2 external). One or more
operators at each site performed two runs per day with two lots of FA Plus culture
bottles over five days of testing for a total of 90 culture bottles tested at each clinical
site for a total of 270 seeded bottles. Additionally, 48 negative control bottles
containing only blood were evaluated. For calculation of percent recovery, positive
results reflect a positive flag by the instrument and Gram stain/subculture consistent
with the seeded organism.
The organisms evaluated and concentrations used for bottle inoculation are shown in
Table 1.

aureus aeruginosa
Candida albicans ~100 CFU/bottle Haemophilus ~100 CFU/bottle

The reproducibility study demonstrated that the VIRTUO instrument generated 100%
positive results for all FA Plus bottles evaluated. In addition, 100% of negative control
bottles were reported as negative by the instrument. Study results are shown in Table

Within-Laboratory Precision Study
Testing was conducted with FA Plus, FN Plus, SA and SN culture bottles in an in-
house precision study for 20 days using multiple VIRTUO instruments and multiple
operators. Three bottle replicates per organism, instrument, bottle type and bottle lot
were tested for a minimum of 60 bottles tested for each organism and bottle lot. The
target organism inoculum was less than 30 CFU/bottle. Bottles were tested without
blood except for 1 mL of added blood for bottles spiked with B. fragilis and S.
pneumoniae and 4 mL of added blood for bottles spiked with H. influenzae. The rate
of detection and recovery as well as the mean time to detection was calculated for each
organism and bottle type evaluated. For calculation of percent recovery, positive
results reflect a positive flag by the instrument and Gram stain/subculture consistent
with the seeded organism.

External Quality Control:
During the clinical study, daily external quality control was conducted on the
VIRTUO system and included one positive and one negative control bottle for each
bottle type tested. Control organisms were seeded into bottles at target inoculum
levels of approximately 30 CFU/bottle. Organism concentrations for bottle seeding
were confirmed by plate counting procedures. For aerobic bottles, organisms
evaluated included one obligate aerobe (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and one
facultative organism (Escherichia coli). For anaerobic bottles, organisms evaluated
included one obligate anaerobe (Clostridium perfringens) and one facultative
organism (Escherichia coli). For each bottle type, one organism was evaluated daily,
alternating between the quality control two organisms. In addition, an uninoculated
negative control bottle was tested daily for each bottle type. There were 1490 positive
controls tested on VIRTUO for all clinical sites combined. Of those, 1487 (99.8%)
generated the expected positive signal by VIRTUO. There were 1486 negative
controls tested on VIRTUO for all sites combined and 100% were reported as
negative.
c. Limit of Detection
The Limit of Detection (LoD) for FA Plus, FN Plus, SA and SN bottles was
evaluated for bottles incubated on VIRTUO. The LoD for FA Plus and FN Plus was
evaluated only on VIRTUO and compared to the LoD established previously on
BTA 3D during studies performed for bottle clearance (i.e., K121461, K121455,
K121446). The LoDs for SA and SN bottles had not been established on the BTA
3D; therefore LoD testing for SA and SN bottles was performed on both instrument
systems. Because the media formulations are the same for FA Plus and PF Plus bottles,
the LoD for FA Plus bottles is also claimed for PF Plus bottles.
Concentrations of organism suspensions used for bottle inoculation were determined
by plating and colony counts. Each bottle was inoculated with organism suspensions
prepare to yield 5 CFU/bottle. To support growth, human blood was added to bottles
inoculated with B. fragilis, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. Bottles were incubated
on VIRTUO and BTA 3D instruments until flagged as positive. All bottles were
subcultured and evaluated for growth, purity and presence of the appropriate test
organism.
A total of 60 replicates were tested for each bottle type/microorganism combination
(ten replicates for each of three bottle lots, tested on two VIRTUO instruments).
Additionally, a total of 30 replicates were tested on one BTA 3D instrument for each
SA and SN bottle type/microorganism combination.
The LoD for each organism/bottle type/instrument was determined to be the organism
concentration (CFU/bottle) for which 95% of bottles were flagged positive by the
instrument and were also positive by subculture. The LoDs for the organisms
10

evaluated in each bottle type are shown in Tables 7 for testing on VIRTUO
and Table 8 for testing on BTA 3D.

d. Comparison Panel Growth Performance Study
The performance of the VIRTUO and BTA 3D systems were compared in an
analytical study using a panel of microorganisms seeded into FA Plus, FN Plus,
SA, and SN bottles. The growth performance study was conducted internally with
seeded bottles containing two different blood volumes (4 and 10 mL). Seeded
bottles without blood were also evaluated. A single strain was tested for each
species evaluated at target inoculum levels of ≤30 CFU/bottle. Each
microorganism was tested in triplicate for each bottle type and blood level on
three VIRTUO systems for a total of 27 bottles per organism/bottle type. For BTA
3D, 9 bottles per blood level were tested on one system for a total of 27 bottles per
organism and bottle type. Two positive bottles were subcultured per organism and

**C. hominis was not detected in the absence of blood on the BacT/ALERT 3D (0/9). However, upon
subculture of the negative C. hominis bottles to solid medium, pure growth was observed; therefore
these bottles were considered false negative.
NOTE: Recovery of E. corrodens, H. influenzae, C. jeikeium, and N. meningitidis in FA Plus bottles,
tested on either instrument, necessitate blood; therefore, FA Plus bottles not containing blood were
excluded from analysis for these organisms. For these organisms, refer to Table 11 above for FA Plus
Bottles containing blood.

**Two FN Plus bottles spiked with Eggerthella lenta were called negative by BTA 3D. Growth was
observed upon subculture; therefore these two bottles were considered false negative.
***Seven FN Plus bottles spiked with Fusobacterium nucleatum were called negative by BTA 3D.
Five of these bottles were subcultured and no growth was observed.

NOTE: Recovery of B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, and P. micra in FN Plus bottles, tested on
either instrument without blood, did not yield sets of paired data. Therefore, FN Plus bottles not
containing blood were excluded from this comparison analysis for these organisms.

In summary, results of the Growth Performance study demonstrated equivalent
performance for VIRTUO and BTA 3D systems for detection and recovery of
representative organisms in FA Plus, FN Plus, SA and SN bottles. The study
demonstrated 100% detection for the majority of organisms evaluated in each bottle
type. The following differences in detection were observed between instruments:
· FA Plus bottles, Cardiobacterium hominis (without blood): 0/9 detected on
BTA 3D, 9/9 detected on VIRTUO
· FN Plus bottles, Eggerthella lenta (with blood): 16/18 bottles detected on
BTA 3D, 18/18 detected on VIRTUO
· FN Plus bottles, Fusobacterium nucleatum (with blood): 6/13 bottles detected
on BTA 3D, 18/18 detected on VIRTUO.
· SA bottles, Fusarium solani complex (with blood): 17/18 bottles detected on
BTA 3D, 18/18 detected on VIRTUO.

e. Evaluation of Delay in Bottle Entry
As stated in the labeling for FA Plus, FN Plus, PF Plus, SA and SN bottles, it is
recommended that bottles are loaded onto the instrument as soon as possible. If a
delay is inevitable, it is recommend that bottles should be held at room temperature
for no longer than 24 hours. The following statement is also included in each bottle
package insert:
* CAUTION: Culture bottles held at room temperature for longer than 24 hours
before loading may not detect microorganisms and should be subcultured.
An analytical study was performed to evaluate potential effects on bottle/instrument
performance for bottles that are delayed between specimen collection and loading
onto the VIRTUO system. The following delay conditions were evaluated:
· 2-8°C for 48 hours
· 20-25°C for 24 hours
· 20-25°C for 36 hours
· 35- 37°C for 8 hours
Testing was conducted using bottles containing 0, 4 and/or 10 mL pooled fresh
human blood at target organism concentrations of ≤100 CFU/bottle. The study
included three lots for each bottle type and a minimum of nine bottles for each
combination of bottle type, organism, hold time, temperature condition and blood
volume. Percent recovery reflects bottles flagged positive by the instrument and
subculture with colony morphology consistent with the seeded organism.
FA Plus Bottles/Delayed Entry (VIRTUO):
For FA Plus bottles tested on VIRTUO, 9 species were evaluated (Staphylococcus
aureus, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus
pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecium) at target concentrations of ≤100 CFU/bottle.
Actual inoculum levels ranged from 5-84 CFU/bottle. The study demonstrated >99%
recovery with the exception of culture bottles held at 2-8°C for 48 hours for which 12
of 13 bottles spiked with N. meningitidis were negative. The study results are shown
in Table 19 below.

SA Bottles/Delayed Entry (VIRTUO)
For SA bottles tested on VIRTUO, 11 species (Staphylococcus aureus, Candida

baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria
meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecium) were evaluated
at target concentrations of ≤100 CFU/bottle. Actual inoculum levels ranged from 4-51
CFU/bottle. The study results support the bottle performance for the recommended
delay conditions of 24 hours at room temperature with the exception of bottles seeded
with N. meningitidis. For this condition, 17/18 bottles spiked with N. meningitidis
were unexpectedly negative. It was noted however that 18/18 SA bottles with N.
meningitidis were positive when tested after a 36 hour delay at room temperature. It
was thought that the unexpected negative results for the 24 hour/room temperature
condition were due to inoculation errors and it was determined that repeat testing
would not be necessary. The study results are shown in Table 21 below.

f. Interfering Substances
An in-house study was conducted to evaluate FA Plus and FN Plus bottles on
VIRTUO for the effect of potentially interfering substance. Seeded studies were
conducted with CSF, pleural fluid, synovial fluid, plasma, and blood. Potential
interferents included WBC at ~1 x 107/mL as well as blood clots. Testing included
bottles without organism as well as bottles seeded with organism concentrations
between 65 and 120 CFU/bottle. A total of five bottles were evaluated for each bottle
type, microorganism, specimen type, and interfering substance combination shown in
Table 23 below.

Section M.2.I: Clinical Study to Evaluate Blood Cultures on VIRTUO and BTA 3D
A multi-center clinical study was conducted to compare the performance of the VIRTUO
and BTA 3D Systems with blood cultures collected in FA Plus, FN Plus, PF Plus, SA, and
SN culture bottles. The study included evaluation of matched pairs of the same bottle
type with one bottle incubated on BTA 3D and the other incubated on VIRTUO. For
each bottle type, the performance of VIRTUO was considered substantially equivalent to
the BTA 3D if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the ratio of system
agreement with positive clinical determination (true positive rate) for the total compliant
samples/isolates (significant, contaminated and unknown) contained a value of 1.
The target quantity for adult bottles (FA Plus, FN Plus, SA and SN) was 8-10 mL per
bottle and overfilled bottle test pairs (either bottle) of an adult pair with a volume greater
than the maximum 10ml blood fill were excluded from the analysis. For purposes of data
analysis, the paired bottles for adult blood culture bottles were considered compliant if
the blood volume of the bottle with the smallest volume was within 30% of the blood
volume of the bottle with the largest volume.
The target quantity for pediatric bottles (PF Plus) was 4 mL per bottle. PF Plus blood
culture bottle pairs were considered compliant if the following criteria were met:
(a) if the total volume of blood collected from a pediatric patient was greater than 5
mL, the blood volume of the bottle with the smallest volume is within 20% of the
blood volume of the bottle with the larger volume or

(b) if the total volume of blood collected from a pediatric patient was equal to or less
than 5 mL, the blood volume of the bottle with the smallest volume is within 50% of
the blood volume of the bottle with the largest volume.
Overfilled bottle test pairs (either bottle) of a PF Plus bottle pair with a volume greater
than the maximum 4ml blood fill were excluded from the analysis. All bottles that were
flagged as positive by the instrument were subcultured and a minimum of 30% of all
negative blood cultures were subcultured. A culture bottle was determined to be a “True
Positive” if flagged positive by the instrument and if an isolate or isolates were recovered
by subculture. True positive rates were calculated for each bottle and specimen type on
BTA 3D and on VIRTUO, and the ratio of VIRTUO true positives to BTA 3D true
positives was calculated to compare performance between instruments. Clinical isolates
recovered from each subcultured bottle were classified as significant, contaminant, or
unknown. Classification was performed by clinicians at each clinical site and was based
on patient chart review in conjunction with predetermined criteria.
A culture bottle was determined to be false negative if the bottle result was negative by
the instrument and resulted in growth upon subculture of the bottle.
A culture bottle was determined to be false positive if the instrument signaled the bottle
as positive but no viable organisms were present in the bottle as confirmed by Gram stain
and subculture.
Results are shown below for blood culture specimens collected in FA Plus, FN Plus, PF
Plus, SA and SN bottle pairs of which one bottle was tested on VIRTUO and the other
bottle was tested on BTA 3D.
Section M.2.I.a- FA Plus Bottles (Blood Cultures) Clinical Performance:
A total of 1441 FA Plus bottle pairs obtained from 750 adult patients suspected of blood
stream bacterial/yeast infections were tested on both VIRTUO and BTA 3D. Of these,
1053 bottle pairs from 637 patients were determined as compliant.
A total of 98 isolates were recovered from all compliant FA Plus bottle pairs with a
positive status. At least one isolate was recovered by subculture from 94 FA Plus bottle
pairs incubated on VIRTUO and/or BTA 3D. Two isolates were recovered from two
bottle pairs and three isolates were recovered from one bottle pair. A total of 73 isolates
were recovered from FA Plus bottles on VIRTUO and a total of 79 isolates were
recovered from FA Plus bottles on BTA 3D. Of the significant isolates, a total of 64
isolates were recovered from FA Plus bottles on VIRTUO compared to a total of 66
isolates recovered from FA Plus bottles on BTA 3D.
No false positives FA Plus bottles were observed on VIRTUO (0/1057) or BTA 3D
(0/1057).
Terminal subcultures were performed for 624 FA Plus bottle pairs that were negative on
28

--- Page 29 ---
both VIRTUO and BTA 3D. False negative results were observed for both bottles of one
bottle pair. For negative bottle pairs for which both bottles were subcultured, the final
false negative rate was 0.16% for both instruments.
The following tables compare results of true positive blood cultures incubated on
VIRTUO and BTA 3D for all compliant FA Plus culture bottles yielding any number of
isolates on subculture (Table 24), a single isolate on subculture (Table 25), and multiple
isolates on subculture (Table 26).

Section M.2.I.d- Low-Fill FA Plus Bottles (Surrogate for PF Plus bottles) Clinical
Performance:
PF Plus bottles contain the same media composition as FA Plus bottles with the only
difference being the required blood volume described in labeling and use in the clinical
setting. Due to the low numbers of positive PF Plus bottles observed in the clinical study
and in order to further compare the performance of VIRTUO and BTA 3D instruments
for low volumes that would typically be collected from pediatric patients using PF Plus
Culture Bottles, an evaluation was performed with low-fill FA Plus Culture Bottles (from
adult patients) inoculated with blood volumes of ≤4 mL.
A total of 550 FA Plus bottle pairs with <4 mL blood fill volumes were tested on
VIRTUO and BTA 3D. Of these, 379 bottle pairs from 292 adult patients had compliant
fill volumes. A total of 40 isolates were recovered from all compliant low-fill FA Plus
blood culture pairs with a positive status. A total of 33 isolates were recovered from low-
fill FA Plus Culture Bottles on VIRTUO and 32 isolates were recovered from low-fill FA
Plus Culture Bottles on BTA 3D. Of the significant isolates, the VIRTUO FA Plus
Culture Bottle detected a total of 28 isolates compared to the BTA 3D Culture Bottle
which detected 29 isolates.
No false positive low-fill FA Plus bottles were observed for VIRTUO or BTA 3D.
Terminal subcultures were performed for 246 low-fill FA Plus bottle pairs that were
negative on both VIRTUO and BTA 3D. No false negative results were observed for
bottles incubated on either instrument.

--- Page 47 ---
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ________
Level of Concern: Moderate
Software Description:
A detailed description of the VIRTUO software was provided describing the differences
between the BTA 3D and the VIRTUO systems. The VIRTUO features a new database
management system (MYLA). The MYLA controls the host and LIS interface, workflow
management, result validation, data consolidation for archives, system and configuration data
and remote notifications for alarms, configuration modifications and more.
Device Hazard Analysis:
An updated risk assessment was provided including a VIRTUO instrumentation and software
component risk analysis, a VIRTUO risk management summary, assessing product safety,
VIRTUO System use and VIRTUO networking/connectivity. Risks of potential failures were
assessed in terms of potential to harm the patient due to an incorrect result and the end user.
Each potential failure and potential cause was assessed for severity, probability (as
appropriate) and detectability before and after mitigation. After mitigation and assessment
through validation studies (as appropriate), each risk was determined to be either minor or
moderate (i.e., as low as reasonably possible).
Software Requirement Specifications (SRS):
Functional requirements for VIRTUO system configuration, alarm configuration/information
signals, growth detection, information management, remote notification, customer remote
access and manufacturer technical support were provided. Also provided were requirements
for performance, operational, dependability, human factors, maintenance, transportation and
storage, documentation, graphical user interface localization, physical characteristics, design
and manufacturing, safety, and installation.
Architecture Design Chart:
Detailed information was provided regarding the system architecture including flow charts
for each of the system components. linking VIRTUO and MYLA system design
specifications, (including detailed internal system designs and general component interfaces).
Charts were provided for MYLA/VIRTUO interfaces detailing how connections are
established, maintained and backed up. Charts for linked, networked and standalone
configurations were provided.
47

--- Page 48 ---
Traceability Analysis:
A traceability matrix was provided that tracks activities from system requirements to
instrument and software design input to verification and validation of outputs for the
VIRTUO, including usability and labeling. Details are referenced through a series of trace
matrix documents for each component of the system.
Software Development Environment Description:
The software development life cycle plan provided describes the processes for input data,
deliverables, controls and verifications for all elements of software development from design
input to output validation. The documentation for the VIRTUO system was acceptable.
Verification and Validation (V&V):
Validation testing was provided for each specification for the VIRTUO instrument and
software, including validation of hardware, installation, configuration, workflow,
MYLA-LIS communication, data records, alarms/alerts, data storage, functionality at
maximum capacity, remote testing, bottle authentication, temperature control, and
priority processing.
Revision Level History:
The software revision history record for the VIRTUO system software was acceptable.
Unresolved Anomalies:
An update was provided to the unresolved (‘open’) anomalies for the VIRTUO system
intended for release. No unresolved anomalies remain that compromise product safety
and efficacy or prevent operation of a function critical to the intended use of the system
where alternative work-arounds are not available. The majority of the unresolved
anomalies can result (at worst) in a minor inconvenience to the end user or are
transparent and can have no effect on performance. Of the 17 unresolved anomalies
remaining that may require a work-around to ensure functional operation of the system,
mitigations (e.g., additional instructions in the labeling; disabling of interfering non-
critical functionalities; etc.) and workarounds were put into place to help ensure that these
anomalies do not impair the end user’s ability to use the device.
3. Specimen Identification:
Specimen Identification is performed using barcode labels (both testing site as well as
bottle-specific barcodes) or bottle and patient identification information can be entered
manually.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The VIRTUO instrument provides automated loading and unloading of culture bottles.
48

--- Page 49 ---
Once a sample bottle is loaded on the conveyor, handling of the sample bottle is generally
not required until a result is obtained and the bottle automatically unloads. Automatic
bottle scans determine the bottle ID and bottle type from the bioMérieux bottle ID. The
system also reads and assigns user applied barcodes, such as the accession ID, patient ID,
or alternate bottle ID. For bottles with a bioMérieux 2D barcode, the system
automatically determines the expiration date, the lot number, and information about the
authenticity of the bottle. For bottles with a fill-to line etched onto the label, the system
determines the sample volume within the bottle and alerts if the bottle is underfilled or
overfilled.
Positive bottle results are audible by a user-configured sound as well. The system
supervises the reading of the culture bottles and contains decision-making algorithms to
determine which samples are positive or negative. The instrument automatically unloads
all identified positive and negative bottles from any instrument in a bank when the
instrument is configured to automatically unload bottles after testing and a final test result
is available. The instrument also has an option for manual bottle loading and unloading.
