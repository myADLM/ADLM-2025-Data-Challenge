L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on chemiluminescence technology. 10 μL of patient sample is subjected to
a pre-treatment step to denature the vitamin D binding protein (VDBP). The treated samples
are then neutralised in assay buffer and a specific anti-25(OH)D antibody labelled with biotin
is added. Following an incubation step, acridinium labelled 25(OH)D is added. Following a
further incubation step, the magnetic particles linked to streptavidin are added. After the final
incubation step the complex is captured using a magnet and a wash step performed to remove
any unbound analyte. Trigger reagents are added and the resulting light emitted by the
acridinium label is inversely proportional to the concentration of 25(OH)D in the original
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP5-A2. Nine serum
samples (all native except Serum 9 that was spiked to achieve a high concentration)
and two controls were assayed using three lots of reagents in duplicate, twice per day
for 20 days on three to four analyzers. All three lots generated similar precision
results. The within-run and total precision results are summarized in the table below
using one representative lot of reagents:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated based on CLSI EP6-A. A high human serum sample (pool of
two endogenous spiked serum samples), a low human serum sample (low serum
sample diluted in zero matrix), and nine evenly spaced dilutions (created by mixing
the high and low sample) were analyzed in replicates of four with sample range tested
between 3.6 to 135.9 ng/mL. The concentrations tested were as follows: 3.6, 16.8,
30.0, 43.3, 56.5, 69.8, 83.0, 96.2, 109.5, 122.7, and 135.9 ng/mL. Linearity curves of
the observed concentration versus the expected concentration were plotted using
unweighted linear regression.
The resulting linear regression equation was y = 1.00x + 3.75 ng/mL, R2 = 1.00
The results of the linearity study support the sponsors claim that the assay is linear in
the assay’s reportable range of 4 to 110 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Standardization and Traceability
The IDS-iSYS 25 VitDSassay is traceable to the Ghent University isotope dilution-
liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (ID-LCMS/MS) 25(OH)D
Reference Method Procedure (RMP). The ID-LCMS/MS RMP is further traceable to
the National Institute of Standards and Technology Standard Reference Material
(NIST SRM) 2972.
This assay has been standardized in accordance with the Vitamin D Standarization
Program (VDSP). Please refer to https://ods.od.nih.gov/Research/vdsp.aspx for more
information on the VDSP program. To achieve standardization, the IDS-iSYS 25
VitDSassay master calibration parameters were aligned to the VDSP by using 136
single-donor human serum samples from the VSDP program, which were value
assigned using the ID-LCMS/MS RMP.

Calibrator and control value assignment
The IDS-iSYS 25VitDSkit calibrators are value assigned using the internal reference
calibrators through an internal procedure. The IDS-iSYS 25VitDSinternal reference
calibrators are value assigned by assignment to samples with known levels of
25(OH)D as determined by the ID-LC-MS/MS reference method procedure. The kit
calibrators are tested as unknowns in a minimum of 20 assay runs on one iSYS
instrument. Each run uses secondary standards (IRs), and the concentrations of the
Kit Calibrators are calculated from these secondary standards (IRs). Following
assignment, the kit calibrator values are then verified over 3 assays using the full
curve parameters in addition to the established calibrator values. The values must fall
within specified acceptable ranges. The kit calibrator concentrations are reagent batch
specific and linked together. The calibrator nominal ranges are listed below:
Calibrator A Nominal Range: 8.0 – 12.0 ng/mL
Calibrator B Nominal Range: 80.0 – 90.0 ng/mL
For kit control value assignment, the kit controls are tested as unknowns in a
minimum of 21 assay runs using multiple systems. The established values are then
verified in a single assay in an approved kit combination. The values must fall within
specified acceptable ranges. The control nominal ranges are listed below:
Kit Control 1 Nominal Range: 12.0 – 18.0 ng/mL
Kit Control 2 Nominal Range: 65.0 – 85.0 ng/mL
Stability
The calibrator and control shelf-life and open-vial stability testing protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be adequate. The open-kit stability
study demonstrates that the calibrators and controls are stable for 42 days once
opened and stored at 2 – 8°C in an upright position in the dark. Calibrators and
controls are stable for up to 4 hours on board the analyzer. Real-time stability studies
are on-going to support a kit calibrator and control minimum shelf life of 12 months.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ)
were determined with guidance from CLSI EP17-A.
To establish the Limit of Blank (LoB), the zero calibrator was assayed in duplicate on
three analyzers, with three reagent lots over multiple days for a total of 6 assays and
60 replicates per reagent lot. LoB was determined by the following equation:
LoB = mean(blank) + [1.645 x SD(blank)]
The LoB claim is 1.31 ng/mL.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) study was performed by assaying six serum samples
with very low vitamin D concentrations in duplicate on three analyzers with three
9

--- Page 10 ---
reagent lots over multiple days for a total of 6 assays and 72 replicates per reagent lot.
LoD was calculated using the following equation:
LoD = LoB + 1.645 x pooled SD
The LoD claim is 1.98 ng/mL.
The Limit of Quantification (LoQ) was determined by measuring ten serum samples with
low vitamin D concentrations (ranging from 0.994 to 9.32 ng/mL) in duplicate on three
analyzers with three reagent lots over multiple days for a total 120 replicates per reagent
lot. The LoQ claim is 3.53 ng/mL and is defined as concentration interpolated from the
regression curve where the upper 95% confidence interval for the curve has a 20% CV.
The LoB, LoD and LoQ are summarized below:
LoB LoD LoQ
1.31 ng/mL 1.98 ng/mL 3.53 ng/mL
The reportable range of the assay is 4 to 110 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference
Interference testing was performed based on CLSI EP7-A2 to assess common or
known substances that could interfere with the IDS-iSYS 25VitDS assay. The
potential endogenous interferents listed below were spiked into two human serum
samples that contained two different concentrations of 25(OH)D. Each sample was
tested in replicates of 26. The 25(OH)D values of the spiked samples were compared
to the control samples containing no interferent. Significant interference was defined
as greater than 10% difference from the expected concentration. The interference
study results are summarized in the following table:

Rheumatoid Factor (Rf): Interference from Rf was assessed by spiking different
amounts of a high Rf sample into two serum base samples containing two different
concentrations of 25(OH)D. Each sample was tested in replicates of 4. The
concentration of 25(OH)D in the Rf spike was determined in the high Rf sample
(diluted to a level where Rf interference would not be expected to occur prior to
25(OH)D determination). The observed 25(OH)D values of the spiked samples were
compared to the expected 25(OH)D values contributed by the base samples and high
Rf sample. Significant interference was defined as greater than 10% difference from
the expected concentration. The results are summarized in the following table:
Potential 25(OH)D concentration of Highest Test Concentration that
endogenous non-spiked sample (ng/mL) demonstrated no significant
interferent interference
Rheumatoid Factor 32.6 and 54.9 600 IU/mL
Cholesterol, Total: Interference from total cholesterol was assessed using a recovery
study. A serum sample containing 343.4 mg/dL cholesterol was spiked with 10% or
20% of a high serum pool containing 168.0 ng/mL 25(OH)D. Serum samples
containing 392.6 mg/dL or 309.1 mg/dL cholesterol were spiked with 10% or 20% of
a high serum pool containing 392.6 mng/mL 25(OH)D. Each sample was tested in
replicates of 4. Recovery of 25(OH)D was assessed by comparing observed versus
expected 25(OH)D values contributed by the 25(OH)D spike. Non-significant
interference is defined as % recovery between 90-110%. The results are summarized
in the following table:

The Sponsor has the following limitations in the labeling based on the interference
studies:
- The lowest Bilirubin level that does not significant interfere (<10% bias) with the
assay is 20 mg/dL; greater than +10% bias was first observed when bilirubin is
above 22 mg/dL.
- Rheumatoid factor at 800 IU/mL will cause a bias in 25(OH)D results up to -11%.
- Cholesterol at 343mg/dL will cause a bias in 25(OH)D results up to -19%.
Cross-reactivity
Two studies were conducted according to CLSI EP7-A2 to evaluate the potential
cross-reactivity of the assay with endogenous cross-reactants (25(OH)D and
2
25(OH)D ) and exogenous substances similar in chemical structure to 25(OH)D.

samples, with intial concentrations of endogenous 25(OH)D , 25(OH)D , and 24,

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed to compare the candidate device to the
predicate device in accordance with CLSI EP9-A2. A total of 120 serum samples
with a sample range of 7.3 to 112 ng/mL were tested in singlicate on the candidate
and predicate devices. Of the 120 samples tested, 2 samples were altered (one sample
was diluted and one sample was spiked) in order to cover the claimed measuring
range. Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed on the comparative data:
n Slope (ng/mL) Intercept (ng/mL) Correlation Sample range
[95% CI] [95% CI] Coefficient (r) tested (ng/mL)
120 0.93 1.09 0.95 7.3 to 112
[0.86 to 1.01] [-0.90 to 3.01]
The candidate device (IDS-iSYS 25 VitDSassay) is a modification of the predicate
device (IDS-iSYS 25-Hydroxy Vitamin DS assay (k140554)) and the main
differences are the source of antibody pools and the calibrator matrix used. It is
expected that the candidate device has a slightly different performance at the low end
of the measuring range when compared against the predicate device because of the
overall assay optimization. The slope showed an overall negative bias when
compared against the predicate device. In addition, scattering above 60 ng/mL was
also observed for this comparison study, but falls within the clinically insignificant
range. The accuracy of the candidate device has been established through a method
comparison study against the ID-LC-MS/MS 25(OH)D RMP and was the basis of the
substantial equivalence determination.
An additional method comparison study was performed to compare the candidate
device IDS-iSYS 25 VitDSassay to the ID-LC-MS/MS 25(OH)D RMP. A total of
136 independent serum samples value assigned by ID-LC-MS/MS RMP (NIST/Ghent
University) were tested. Of these 136 samples, 7 samples with a high 25(OH)D

within the high end of the measuring range. The remaining 129 samples were
unaltered. Passing Bablok regression analysis was performed on the comparative
data:

b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study using the IDS-iSYS 25 VitDS assay was performed
according to CLSI EP09-A3 to evaluate the difference between serum (serum without
additives, SST) and plasma (lithium heparin, sodium heparin, K EDTA). Sixty-seven
2
(67) samples, ranging from 4.8 to 108 ng/mL, were tested with ten of these samples
spiked in order to cover the measuring range. Passing-Bablok regression analysis
was performed on the comparative data relative to serum with no additives:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
An expected value study was performed according to the non-parametric method in CLSI
C28-A3c. Samples were collected from 392 apparently healthy male (51%) and female
(49%) adults, aged 21-89 years, during winter and summer seasons and from
geographically diverse regions of the United States. This overall diversity in, geographic
location, race, and ethnicity represents a broad spectrum of UV light exposure in the
intended use population. The samples were tested for 25(OH)D concentrations using the
IDS-iSYS 25 VitDSassay. The 2.5th to 97.5th reference interval is shown below:
