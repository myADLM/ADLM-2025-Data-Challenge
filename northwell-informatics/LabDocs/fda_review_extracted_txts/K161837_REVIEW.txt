Glucose Reagent:
The glucose test system is for the quantitative measurement of glucose in human serum,
plasma, urine and cerebrospinal fluid on Beckman Coulter AU analyzers. Glucose
measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of carbohydrate metabolism
disorders including diabetes mellitus, neonatal hypoglycemia, and idiopathic
hypoglycemia, and of pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.
CRP Latex Reagent:
System reagent for the quantitative determination of C-Reactive Protein in human serum
and plasma on Beckman Coulter AU Analyzers. Measurement of CRP is useful for the

L. Test Principle:
The Ion Selective Electrode (ISE) module for sodium, potassium, and chloride measurement
employs crown ether membrane electrodes for sodium and potassium and a molecular
oriented PVC membrane for chloride that is specific for each ion of interest in the sample.
An electrical potential is developed according to the Nernst Equation for a specific ion.
When compared to the Internal Reference Solution, this electrical potential is translated into
voltage and then into the ion concentration of the sample.
Glucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
and magnesium ions to produce glucose-6-phospage (G-6-P) and adenosine diphosphate
(ADP). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase specifically oxidizes G-6-P to 6-
phosphogluconate with the concurrent reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD+) to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced (NADH). For the DxC 700 AU the
change in absorbance at 340/600 nm is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the
sample.
The C-Reactive Protein assay high sensitive application uses the latex agglutination test
principle. Immune complexes formed in solution scatter light in proportion to their size,
shape, and concentration. Turbidimeters measure the reduction of incidence light due to
reflection, absorption, or scatter. The measurement of the rate of decrease in light intensity
transmitted (increase in absorbance) through particles suspended in solution is the result of
complexes formed during the immunological reaction between the CRP of the patient serum
and rabbit anti-CRP antibodies coated on latex particles.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Note: The normal and high sensitivity CRP applications use the same CRP Latex
reagent, but require separate calibrators and instrument settings, and have separate
measuring ranges (normal, 1.0-480 mg/L and high sensitivity, 0.2-80 mg/L). Only the
high sensitivity application (hs-CRP) was used for the CRP performance studies.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability (within-run) and total precision studies were performed in accordance
with CLSI EP05-A3. The precision was evaluated using 1 lot of reagent and 1 lot of
calibrator for each analyte tested. The samples for the ISE precision studies consisted
of 3 to 4 levels of pooled human serum and pooled human urine. The glucose
precision samples consisted of 5 concentrations of human serum samples and the
CRP precision samples consisted of 4 concentrations of human serum samples. Some
of the sample pools were spiked or diluted to achieve concentrations throughout the
claimed measuring ranges of each analyte. The samples were run in duplicate, twice
daily, over the course of 20 days for a total of 80 results per analyte on the DxC 700
AU analyzer. The results are summarized in the tables below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ISE calibrator material for sodium, potassium and chloride was previously
cleared under k921718. The Glucose calibrator material was previously cleared under
k043460.The CRP calibrator material, high sensitivity application, was previously
cleared under k051564.
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit studies were performed according to CLSI EP17-A2. The limit of
blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) for high
sensitivity CRP and Glucose were determined by running replicate measurements on
blank and low level serum samples using 2 lots of reagent across multiple days. A
total of 60 blank replicates per reagent lot and 280 low level sample replicates per
reagent lot were obtained. This was comprised of 4 blank samples run in replicates of
5 for 3 days, and 7 low level serum samples run in replicates of 5 for 8 days. The
sponsor defines the LoQ for CRP and Glucose as the lowest concentration with an
inter-assay precision of ≤ 20% CV. The detection limits for Glucose and hs-CRP are
summarized below:

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed in accordance to CLSI EP07-A2. Different levels
of intralipid, bilirubin and hemoglobin were spiked into human serum sample pools
and tested on the DxC 700 AU. Samples were tested in replicates of four at one or
two analyte concentrations using a single lot of reagent and calibrator. The results of
the spiked samples were compared to the results of the non-spiked samples. The
sponsor defines significant interference for each of the analytes as follows: Glucose,
± ≥10% bias; Chloride, ±2.5% bias; Potassium, ±0.25 mEq/L; and Sodium, ±2
mEq/L; hs-CRP ± ≥10% bias for intralipid and ± ≥5% bias for hemolysis and
bilirubin. The results are summarized in the table below:

CRP (high sensitivity (cardiac) application) prozone study:
A study was performed to verify the CRP prozone performance on the DxC 700 AU.
Human serum was spiked with human CRP to create a prozone high pool of >750
mg/L. The high pool was diluted with 5% BSA in 0.9% saline to obtain equally
spaced concentrations of CRP as follows: approximately 0.0, 4.0, 8.2, 16.3, 40.7,
81.5, 163.0, 244.5, 326.0, 407.5, 488.9, 570.4, 651.9, 733.4, and 815.0 mg/L CRP.
Each sample was run in triplicate to confirm prozone performance. The study
demonstrated that no value within the measuring range (0.2-80 mg/L) is
generated with CRP concentrations up to 815 mg/L and that all data flagged
appropriately as being out of the measuring range (>80 mg/L).
The sponsor includes the following limitations in the labeling:
ISE Reagent:
“Separate serum from blood cells as soon as possible. Avoid hemolysis since it can
lead to falsely elevated K+ values.”
“Serum, free from hemolysis, is the recommended specimen.”
“Certain anticoagulants, preservatives, drugs, and organophilic compounds may
affect electrolyte determinations. For further information on interfering substances,
refer to Young1 for a compilation of reported interferences with this test. Visually
turbid urine specimens should be centrifuged prior to analysis. Grossly lipemic
samples may show an inappropriate decrease in sodium, potassium, and chloride
results due to volume displacement. Such samples should be ultracentrifuged and the

analysis performed on the infranatant (middle clear layer).”
“Care should be taken when interpreting results from patients with hyperproteinemia
and hyperlipidemia due to the electrolyte exclusion effect.”
Glucose Reagent:
“Fasting serum or plasma (EDTA, heparin or sodium fluoride) samples free from
hemolysis, are the recommended specimens. Separate from red cells rapidly to
minimize loss of glucose through glycolysis. Fresh random collections are
recommended for urine specimens.”
“In rare cases gammopathy, especially monoclonal IgM (Waldenstrom’s
macroglobulinemia), may cause unreliable results.”
CRP Latex (high sensitivity (cardiac) application):
“Centrifuge samples containing precipitates before performing the assay.”
“In very rare cases gammopathy, especially monoclonal IgM (Waldenstrom’s
macroglobulinemia), may cause unreliable results.”
“Samples containing heterophilic antibodies can cause falsely elevated results. Please
note that oral contraceptives have been reported to affect results.”
“Sample carryover may occur when a high CRP sample >160 mg/L is run directly
before a sample with low CRP. Sample contamination avoidance parameters should
be programmed on the AU2700/5400/5800/480/680 and DxC 700 AU instruments
and are available on the Beckman Coulter website.”
“When using the High Sensitive Application on the Beckman Coulter
AU2700/5400/5800/DxC 700 AU systems, patients with CRP concentrations up to
750 mg/L will not generate false low results within the analytical range.”
“Patients with inflammatory and/or infectious conditions should have their CRP
measured using the Normal Application, particularly when used for patient
monitoring. When using the Normal Application on all Beckman Coulter AU
systems, patients with CRP concentrations up to 750 mg/L will not generate false low
results within the analytical range.”

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP09-A3. A
minimum of 100 human serum samples with analyte concentration within the
analytical ranges of sodium, potassium, chloride, glucose, and CRP (high sensitivity
(cardiac) application) and a minimum of 100 urine samples for sodium, potassium,
and chloride were tested on the DxC 700 AU and the AU5800. Less than 15% of the
samples were altered by spiking and diluting human serum samples and urine. The
regression analysis is summarized in the tables below:

Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor performed studies in accordance to CLSI EP28-A3c to verify the reference
ranges of the analytes. A minimum of 20 serum samples from healthy volunteers were
used to verify the CRP high sensitivity (cardiac) application and Glucose reference
ranges. The sodium, potassium and chloride reference range was verified using 20 serum,
ammonium heparin, and lithium heparin samples from healthy volunteers. The samples
were tested in duplicate on two DxC 700 AU analyzers, each using a different reagent
lot. The mean of the duplicate results for each subject was compared against reference
ranges cited in literature. The verification studies support the following reference ranges
which were established through literature.
CRP high sensitivity (cardiac) application
The expected values of CRP concentrations, <1 mg/L were established though
literature and the cardiac risk assessment categories are recommended by the
American Heart Association (AHA) are as follows:
Low: <1 mg/L, Average 1.0 to 3.0 mg/L, and High: >3.0 mg/L1
CRP expected values <10 mg/dL (established through literature)5
Newborns with no evidence of infection have CRP concentrations of <10 mg/L
(established through literature).2
