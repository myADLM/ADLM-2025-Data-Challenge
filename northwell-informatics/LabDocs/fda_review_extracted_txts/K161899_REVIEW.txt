SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
OIR Decision Memorandum
To: THE FILE RE: K161899
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own
Class II devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device. The
ImmunoCAP Specific IgE and Total IgE assays were previously cleared under K051218 (for
Specific IgE) and K133404 (for Total IgE).
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as
described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes
directions for use for the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE and ImmunoCAP Total IgE assays on the
cleared instruments.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S) in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the
FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.
This change was for the introduction of a new Reference Material (International Reference
Preparation, IRP) for standardization of ImmunoCAP Specific and Total IgE assays, incorporating
the 3rd WHO International Standard (3rd WHO IRP) for serum IgE (11/234).
No change of Intended Use/Indications for Use or fundamental scientific technology of the assay
system has been made. No change of specifications or manufacturing methods for any assay
reagents has been made.
Directions for Use for ImmunoCAP Specific and ImmunoCAP Total IgE will be updated to reflect
the change. The update will be phased in over time. During a transition period Phadia intends to
supply an intermediate version of labelling containing traceability information to either the old and
new reference material..
4. Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to applicant’s legally marketed predicate
device including, labeling, Intended Use, physical characteristics, and traceability
The similarities and differences between the Predicate Device, ImmunoCAP Specific IgE as
cleared under k051218, and the New Device, ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, are listed below.

b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities
required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended
use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the
particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified
devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has
provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I
recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
