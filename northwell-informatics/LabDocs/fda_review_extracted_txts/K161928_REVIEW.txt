CAPI 3 Immunotyping using CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument:
The CAPI 3 IMMUNOTYPING kit is designed for the qualitative detection and
characterization of monoclonal proteins (immunotyping) in human serum with the
CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument, SEBIA, for capillary electrophoresis. It is
used in conjunction with CAPI 3 PROTEIN(E) 6 kit, SEBIA, designed for protein
separation into 6 major fractions in alkaline buffer (pH 9.9).
The CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument performs all procedural sequences
automatically to obtain a protein profile for qualitative analysis. Each serum sample
is mixed with individual antisera that are specific against gamma (Ig G), alpha (Ig
A) and mu (Ig M) heavy chains, and kappa (free and bound) light chains and
lambda (free and bound) light chains, respectively.
The proteins, separated in silica capillaries, are directly detected by their
absorbance at 200 nm. The electrophoregrams are evaluated visually to detect the
presence of specific reactions with the suspect monoclonal proteins.
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use.
IT/IF Control:
The IT/IF Control is designed to quality control the qualitative detection and
characterization of human monoclonal immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, Kappa and
Lambda) with the electrophoresis methods:
- Immunotyping performed using capillary electrophoresis on SEBIA
CAPILLARYS 2, CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING and CAPILLARYS 3
TERA instruments and on SEBIA MINICAP instrument,
- Immunofixation methods: SEBIA HYDRAGEL IF, HYDRAGEL IF Penta,
HYDRAGEL BENCE JONES (Standard mask and Dynamic mask)
performed using the HYDRASYS and HYDRASYS 2 instruments and the K20
electrophoresis chamber.
The IT/IF Control is designed for laboratory use. It should be used (with its barcode
label for CAPILLARYS and MINICAP procedure) like a human serum sample. The
electrophoretic pattern obtained is specific for each batch of IT/IF control.

CAPI 3 IMMUNOTYPING kit (PN 2600) contains the sample diluent, ELP solution and
specific antisera against gamma (IgG), alpha (IgA), mu (IgM) heavy chains, and free
and bound Kappa and Lambda light chains.
A sample dilution is prepared and injected at the anodic end of six capillaries. The
reference pattern (ELP pattern), which is a complete electrophoretic pattern of the sample’s
proteins, is obtained by mixing the sample with the ELP solution and injecting it into
the first capillary. The antisera patterns are obtained by sample aspiration into the five
subsequent capillaries. Separation is performed in a high-voltage electrical field and
proteins are detected using absorbance at 200 nm.
The CAPI 3 IMMUNOTYPING kit is designed for the SEBIA CAPILLARYS 3 TERA
intrument (PN 1246), a complete automated capillary electrophoresis system.
IT/IF Control:
The IT/IF Control is obtained from a pool of human sera complemented with monoclonal
immunoglobulins displaying the five specificities IgG, IgA, IgM, and Kappa and Lambda light
chains.
The IT/IF Control is supplied in a stabilized lyophilized form.

L. Test Principle:
The CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument electrophoresis system uses the principle of capillary
electrophoresis in liquid medium. With this technique, charged molecules are separated by their
electrophoretic mobility in an alkaline buffer with a specific pH. Separation also occurs according
to the electrolyte pH and electroosmotic flow. The CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument has silica
capillaries functioning in parallel allowing 12 simultaneous analyses.
In immunotyping, a sample dilution is prepared and injected at the anodic end of six
capillaries. The reference pattern (ELP pattern), which is a complete electrophoretic pattern
of the sample’s proteins, is obtained by mixing the sample with the ELP solution and
injecting it into the first capillary. The antisera patterns are obtained by sample aspiration
into the five subsequent capillaries. Previously diluted samples are mixed with specific
antisera against gamma (IgG), alpha (IgA), mu (IgM) heavy chains, and free and bound
Kappa and Lambda light chains. Protein separation is performed in a high voltage electrical
field. The separated proteins are detected using absorbance at 200 nm at the cathodic end
of the capillary. After the analysis, the capillaries are immediately washed with a wash
solution and filled with buffer which prepares the capillaries for the next analysis.
The immunotyping is performed in four automated steps:
1. Dilution of serum samples with a specific diluent in the pre-dilution well of the
reagent cup. This dilution is made according to the sample's immunoglobulin
concentration.
2. Mixing diluted serum sample with specific antisera. The antigen-antibody complex is
formed rapidly in liquid medium.
3. Injection of the prepared samples with simultaneous aspiration into six capillaries at
the anodic end. Protein separation occurs when a high-voltage field is applied to the
alkaline buffer. The separated proteins are detected using absorbance at 200 nm at the
cathodic end of the capillary
4. Overlay of the ELP pattern on the antisera patterns (IgG, IgA, IgM, Kappa and
Lambda light chains) allows the qualitative characterization and result interpretation of
suspected monoclonal component.

M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
All results met the manufacturer’s pre-specified acceptance criteria.
Within-run and between-capillary precision:
Six different serum samples (five pathological samples with monoclonal proteins and
one normal sample) were qualitatively tested 12 times in two runs using the CAPI 3
IMMUNOTYPING on 12 capillaries on the CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument. One
lot of the CAPI 3 IMMUNOTYPING was used. Each sample was anaylzed with
each reagent: ELP solution, anti-IgG, anti-IgA, anti-IgM, anti-kappa and anti-lambda
antisera. For each tested reagent, all samples gave concordant results within-run and
between-capillaries.
Within-run reproducibility of IT/IF Control:
Three IT/IF control lots were run six times within a run and the run was repeated with
three different immunotyping antisera lot numbers on the CAPILLARYS 3 TERA
instrument. The IT/IF controls were comprised of one monoclonal IgGL, one IgAL,
and one IgMK. According to the identified monoclonal protein, concordant and
reproducible within-run results were obtained.
Between-run and between-lot reproducibility of CAPILLARYS 3 IMMUNOTYPING
and IT/IF Control on three CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument:
Five pathological and one normal serum sample were analyzed three times and
repeated in three different runs (with a total of 18 runs) over five working days. The
tests were performed with three different CAPILLARYS 3 IMMUNOTYPING kit lot
numbers, three different IT/IF Control lots, and three different CAPILLARYS 3
TERA instruments. According to the identified monoclonal protein characterization,
concordant and reproducible results were obtained for both pathological and normal
serum samples on all lots and instruments.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
No reference standards and methods available. Controls are internally manufactured
by the manufacturer from myeloma serum samples with representative IgGK, IgAK,
and IgML monoclonal proteins, and are validated by both Immunofixation Gel
Electrophoresis and Capillary Electrophoresis methods.
9

--- Page 10 ---
Stability: The manufacturer provided data to support real-time stability of 18 months
and on-board stability of two months for the CAPI 3 IT Kit.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of detection was performed on three pathological samples: IgA Kappa, IgG
Lambda and IgM Kappa with concentration levels of 3.40 g/L, 3.96 g/L and 1.60 g/L,
respectively. These three samples were serially diluted at 1:2 down to 1:512 dilution
for IgG Lambda and IgM Kappa and down to 1:1024 dilution for IgA Kappa to obtain
the variable monoclonal component concentration. The testing was performed on
both the Capillarys on Capillarys 2 Flex-Piercing predicate device and CAPI 3 IT on
CAP 3 TERA new device. The new device met the acceptance criteria and the Limit
of detection results using CAPI 3 IT on CAPILLARY 3 TERA are listed below:
Dection Limit
Sample Type

1 IgA, Kappa 13.3
2 IgG, Lambda 30.9
3 IgM, Kappa 25.0
e. Analytical specificity:
The Immunotyping interference study was perfomed by testing two samples (normal
and pathological) with the interferents. These were tested using the CAPI 3 IT on
CAPILLARY 3 TERA instrument. The interferents tested were: hemoglobin, lipids
(cholesterol and triglycerides), bilirubin, and rheumatoid factor . No interference was
observed in anysample. The results of testing pathological serum samples
representing IgGK, IgGL, IgAK, IgAL, IgMK and one normal serum sample are
shown in the table below:
