H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Siemens Atellica™ Solution is a multi-component system for in vitro diagnostic
testing of clinical specimens. The system is intended for the qualitative and quantitative
analysis of various body fluids, using photometric, turbidimetric, chemiluminescent, and
integrated ion selective electrode technology for clinical use.
The Atellica™ A-LYTE Integrated Multisensor (Na, K, Cl) is intended for in vitro
diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of sodium, potassium, and chloride (Na,
K, Cl) in human serum, plasma, and urine using the Atellica™ CH system.
Measurements of sodium obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment
of aldosteronism (excessive secretion of the hormone aldosterone), diabetes insipidus
(chronic excretion of large amounts of dilute urine, accompanied by extreme thirst),
adrenal hypertension, Addison’s disease (caused by destruction of the adrenal glands),
dehydration, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, or other diseases involving
electrolyte imbalance. Measurements of potassium obtained by this device are used to
monitor electrolyte balance in the diagnosis and treatment of disease conditions
characterized by low or high blood potassium levels. Chloride measurements are used in
the diagnosis and treatment of electrolyte and metabolic disorders such as cystic fibrosis
and diabetic acidosis.
The Atellica™ CH Albumin BCP Reagent (Alb_P) is intended for in vitro diagnostic use
in the quantitative measurement of albumin in human serum or plasma on Atellica™ CH
system. Albumin measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of numerous
diseases primarily involving the liver or kidneys.

The Atellica™ IM Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) assay is for in vitro diagnostic
use in the quantitative determination of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin)
in human serum, and plasma (EDTA and lithium heparin) using the Atellica™ IM
system. Measurements of the thyroid stimulating hormone produced by the anterior
pituitary are used in the diagnosis of thyroid or pituitary disorders.

I. Device Description:
The AtellicaTM Solution is a configurable test system comprising combinations of the
following modules: AtellicaTM Sample Handler, AtellicaTM Magline Transport system,
AtellicaTM IM system, and AtellicaTM CH system. The basic system comprises one each of
these modules. The Atellica™ Solution is customizable, based on the needs of the clinical

and/or analyzers modules.
The Atellica™ Sample Handler is the main operator interface with the system. Patient
samples, STAT samples, Calibrators, and QC materials are loaded, stored, and unloaded.
The Atellica™ Magline transports samples, controls, and calibrators between the sample
handler and the analyzer modules using carriers.

L. Test Principle:
The AtellicaTM A-LYTE Integrated Multisensor (Na, K, Cl) uses indirect Integrated
Multisensor Technology (IMT). There are four electrodes used to measure electrolytes. Three
of these electrodes are ion selective for sodium, potassium and chloride. A reference
electrode is also incorporated in the multisensor. A diluted sample (1:10 with IMT Diluent)
is positioned in the sensor and Na+, K+ or Cl- ions establish equilibrium with the electrode
surface. A potential is generated proportional to the logarithm of the analyte activity in the
sample. The electrical potential generated on a sample is compared to the electrical potential
generated on a standard solution, and the concentration of the desired ions is calculated by
use of the Nernst equation.

The AtellicaTM CH Albumin BCP Reagent (Alb_P) is an adaptation of the bromocresol
purple (BCP) dye-binding method. In the AtellicaTM CH Albumin BCP Reagent (Alb_P)
assay, serum or plasma albumin quantitatively binds to BCP to form an albumin-BCP
complex that is measured as an endpoint reaction at 596/694 nm.
The AtellicaTM CH Vancomycin (Vanc) assay is based on a homogeneous particle enhanced
turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay (PETINIA) technique which uses a synthetic particle-
Vancomycin conjugate (PR) and monoclonal Vancomycin specific antibody. Vancomycin
present in the sample competes with Vancomycin on the particles for available antibody,
thereby decreasing the rate of aggregation. Hence, the rate of aggregation is inversely
proportional to the concentration of Vancomycin in the sample. The rate of aggregation is
measured using bichromatic turbidimetric readings at 545 nm and 694 nm.
The AtellicaTM IM Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) assay employs anti-FITC
monoclonal antibody covalently bound to paramagnetic particles, a FITC-labeled anti-TSH
capture monoclonal antibody, and a tracer consisting of a proprietary acridinum ester and an
anti-TSH monoclonal antibody conjugated to bovine serum albumin for chemiluminescent
detection. A direct relationship exists between the amount of TSH present in the patient
sample and the amount of relative light units detected by the system.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were conducted with reference to CLSI EP09-A3.
The accuracy performance of the AtellicaTM Solution for sodium, potassium, chloride,
albumin, vancomycin, and TSH was established by conducting a method comparison
study. The AtellicaTM Solution was configured with one Atellica™ Sample Handler,
one Atellica™ Magline sample transport system, one Atellica™ CH system, and one
Atellica™ IM system. The comparators were an Atellica IM system with direct
sample loading for TSH and Atellica CH system with direct sample loading for
sodium, potassium, chloride, albumin, and vancomycin.
The study tested native serum samples and a small number of contrived samples to
cover the analytical range of the assays.
Using one reagent lot for each assay, two replicates were run for each sample on both
the AtellicaTM Solution and comparators; the first replicate of each sample was used
in the data analysis. The study was conducted internally. The personnel conducting
the study were laboratory technicians with training similar to personnel who would
conduct the tests in a hospital laboratory setting.
The Passing-Bablok regression analysis for sodium, potassium, chloride, the Ordinary
Least Square regression analysis for albumin, the Deming regression analysis for
vancomycin, and the Weighted Deming regression analysis for the TSH results are
summarized below:

was conducted in k151792 per CLSI EP28-A3c: Defining, Establishing, and Verifying
Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory. The study results support the original
reference range.
