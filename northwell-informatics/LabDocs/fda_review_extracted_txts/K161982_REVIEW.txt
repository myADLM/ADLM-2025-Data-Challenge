L. Test Principle:
The determination of soluble antigen (CRP) concentration by turbidimetric methods involves
the reaction with specific antiserum (anti-CRP) to form insoluble complexes. When light is
passed through the suspension formed, a portion of the light is transmitted and focused onto a
photodiode by an optical lens system. The amount of transmitted light is indirectly
proportional to the specific protein concentration in the test sample. Concentrations are
automatically calculated by reference to a calibration curve stored within the instrument.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance: All results for analytical performance met the sponsor’s pre-
determined acceptance criteria for each study.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision and reproducibility of the assay was evaluated by testing four serum
samples containing various concentrations of CRP. Each sample was run in
duplicate, two runs per day, for 21 days with one lot of reagents on three SPAPLUS
analyzers (n = 84 replicates per sample). The results are summarized in the table
below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity: Linearity was evaluated according to the CLSI guideline EP6-A. A
pooled serum sample containing a high concentration of CRP was mixed with normal
serum to generate a series of 13 dilution samples. Each sample was tested in
triplicate using one lot of reagent. The results of weighted regression analysis are
summarized as follows:
Dilution Range Slope Y-intercept R2 % Recovery
(mg/L) (95% CI) (95% CI)
1.00 −0.02
2.80–315.33 1.00 −5.7%–7.4%
(0.96–1.04) (−0.32–0.27)
The manufacturer is reporting that the assay is linear from 5–250 mg/L.
Hook effect (antigen excess):
To evaluate the effect of antigen excess, a study was performed by testing a sample
containing CRP concentration above the upper limit of the reportable range of the
device. The obtained antigen excess capacity of the CRP kit for use on SPAPLUS is
up to 3433 mg/L at the 1/10 dilution. The samples with analyte levels more than 10%
above the upper limit of measuring range were flagged as antigen excess samples by
the SPA analyzer.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The calibrators used to calibrate the assay are traceable to the ERM-DA474 reference
material.
Value assignment: The antiserum, calibrators and controls used in the CRP kit for
use on SPAPLUS are purchased from DiaSys Diagnostic Systems GmbH. The
antiserum is supplied in bulk form. The calibrators and controls are supplied in
dispensed unlabeled vials. The Certificate of Analysis (COA) contains the assigned
value for the controls and calibrators. Using the calibrator and control assigned

values from the COA, three curves are calibrated on the SPAPLUS analyzer and
validated by comparing against the specification of tested kit. The controls are also
run against each of the three calibration curves. The tested values must be within
±8.5% of the assigned value.
Stability:
The real-time stability for un-opened (shelf life), open-vial, and on-board stability
studies were each performed using multiple lots of kit reagent pack, calibrators and
controls. The results support the following stability claims:
Kit Reagent Pack Un-opened 5 months at 2–8°C
Open-vial 3 months at 2–8°C
On-board 30 days at 8–12°C
Calibrators/Controls Un-opened 5 months at 2–8°C
Open-vial 3 months at 2–8°C
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying one analyte-depleted serum sample
with one lot of reagent to generate sixty data points. LoB was calculated as the 95th
percentile using the non-parametric method. The claimed LoB is 0.5 mg/L.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by assaying five samples with CRP
concentration close to the lower limit of reportable range. Each sample was tested in
replicates of 12 over five days with two reagent lots. The LoD was calculated as the
LoB + 1.645 x SD of the replicates for the low level samples. The LoD was
determined as 0.75 mg/L and 0.72 mg/L for each lot. The claimed LoD is 0.75 mg/L.
The Limit of Quantification (LoQ) was validated by testing four samples with CRP
concentration close to the lower limit of reportable range. Each sample was tested in
replicates of five over three days with two reagent lots. The LoQ was verified to be
the value that meets the accuracy goal of 20% CV of within-lab precision. The result
supports that the claimed LoQ is 5 mg/L which is the lower limit of the measuring
range claimed for the assay.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interference: Three serum samples (7.74, 61.42, and 144.67 mg/L) were
spiked with endogenous interferents respectively. The control samples were prepared
for each interfering substance by spiking with the same volume of diluents. Each
sample was tested in triplicates and the percent difference was calculated by
comparing to a corresponding control sample. No interference was detected in the
samples up to the concentrations listed in the table below.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The reference range is < 5 mg/L in apparently healthy individuals (Dati F, et al. 1996,
Consensus of a group of professional societies and diagnostic companies on guidelines
for interim reference ranges for 14 proteins in serum based on the standardization
against the IFCC/BCR/CAP reference material (CRM 470). Eur J. Clin Chem Clin
Biochem.34:517-520).
The reference range in the normal population was verified per CLSI c28-A3c by testing
22 apparently healthy individuals using the CRP Kit for use on SPAPLUS. The results
showed that one sample had a CRP concentration at 5.2 mg/L and the remaining samples
(95.5%) had a CRP concentration < 5mg/L using the CRP Kit for use on SPAPLUS. It is
recommended that each laboratory should establish its own reference range for the
population in its region.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
