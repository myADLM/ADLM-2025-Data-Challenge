L. Test Principle:
The VITROS Cl- Slide assay is performed using the VITROS Cl- Slides and the VITROS
Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 2 on VITROS Chemistry Systems. The VITROS Cl- Slide
is a multilayered, analytical element coated on a polyester support that uses direct
potentiometry for measurement of chloride ions.
The slide consists of two ion-selective electrodes, each containing a protective layer, a silver
layer and a silver chloride layer coated on a polyester support. The protective layer inhibits
interference from normal levels of bromide and uric acid. A drop of patient sample and a
drop of VITROS Electrode Reference Fluid on separate halves of the slide results in
migration of both fluids toward the center of the paper bridge. A stable liquid junction is
formed connecting the reference electrode to the sample indicator electrode. Each electrode

produces an electrical potential in response to the activity of chloride ions applied to it. The
potential difference poised between the two electrodes is proportional to the chloride
concentration in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed in accordance with CLSI document EP05-A3. The
precision study was performed with two VITROS Cl- Slide lots on the VITROS 5,1
FS Chemistry System. Two runs were performed on each of 20 non-consecutive days.
Each run consisted of four samples run in duplicate (N=80). Runs within day were
separated by at least two hours. A fresh sample aliquot was used for each run.
The summary of the precision study results are presented below:
Mean Repeatability Within Day Within Lab
(mmol/L) SD CV (%) SD CV (%) SD CV (%)
(mmol/L) (mmol/L) (mmol/L)
18 0.2 1.2 0.6 3.3 0.8 4.2
105 0.5 0.4 0.5 0.5 0.7 0.6
191 0.6 0.3 0.7 0.4 1.2 0.6
282 0.9 0.3 1.1 0.4 2.6 0.9
*Within Day precision was determined using two runs per day with two replicates
**Within Lab precision was determined using a single lot of slides and calibrating
weekly
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed following the CLSI EP06-A guideline. Eleven
equally spaced samples (12-320 mmol/L) covering the measuring range were prepared
by mixing high and low concentration patient samples. Six replicates were measured
for each sample and the mean of these replicates was compared to the expected values.
Linear regression summary results are presented below and support the claimed
measuring range of the device (15-300 mmol/L):

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The VITROS chloride slides are traceable to the NIST Reference Material, SRM 919.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification
(LoQ) were evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2 Guideline using the
VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System.
LoB was determined by testing four chloride-depleted formulations of surrogate urine
samples designed for use in electrolyte calibrator materials using three VITROS Cl-
Slide lots. Six replicates were run once per day for three days. A total of 72
measurements were obtained per Cl- Slide lot. LoB was determined non-
parametrically using the worst case from the three slide lots.
LoD was determined by testing six low level human urine pools using three Cl- Slide
lots. Six replicates were run once per day for three days. A total of 108 measurements
were obtained per Cl- Slide lot. The LoD was calculated parametrically using the
worst case from three slide lots.
Results from the LoD test samples were used to estimate imprecision at the low
analyte level according to the protocol in CLSI EP17-A2. The LoQ is determined as
the lowest concentration at which the assay demonstrates an imprecision of ≤5% for
each slide lot. The claimed LoQ is representative of the worst case from three slide
lots.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline to
determine the effects of exogenous and endogenous substances on the performance of
the VITROS Chemistry Products Cl- Slides assay for urine.
Two human urine pools containing approximately 20 and 180 mmol/L of chloride
were used as the base pools for all evaluations via paired difference testing.
Test pools were spiked with test substances at the target test levels and the VITROS
Cl- Slides results were compared to matched control pools prepared with no test
substance added. Six replicates of each test substance were tested on three Cl- Slide
lots.

Effect of pH: The sponsor evaluated the effect of pH on the test results using two
human urine pools with chloride concentrations of 20 and 180 mmol/L, and
demonstrated that pH values of 4.0 and 9.0 did not interfere with test results.
Effect of specific gravity: The sponsor evaluated the effect of specific gravity on the
test results using three human urine pools with chloride concentrations of 50, 67, and
50 mmol/L. The specific gravity of these pools was adjusted using sucrose and
demonstrated that Specific Gravity values of 1.00-1.04 did not interfere with test
results.
The sponsor added the following limitations to their labeling:
o Specimens Not Recommended: Urine with the following preservatives:
· Hydrochloric acid (12N HCl)
· 10% Thymol in isopropanol
o Bromide and iodide from therapeutic drugs and ointments may cause a positive bias
of approximately 5 mmol/L and 6 mmol/L, respectively, for each mmol/L of halide.
Normal physiological levels of bromide and iodide do not interfere.
f. Assay cut-off:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed according to CLSI document EP9-A3.
A total of 125 random catch human urine samples covering the claimed measuring
range were assayed in triplicate on the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System and in
singleton using the Siemens Chloride (CL) method for ADVIA Chemistry Systems
(predicate device; k990346) over four test days. Only the first replicate from each
sample tested on the VITROS system and Siemens ADVIA was used in the analysis.
Ten of the 125 samples tested were spiked with sodium chloride to cover the upper
end of the measuring range. Samples were assayed with the VITROS Cl- Slides and
comparative method within 8 hours of each other.
The linear regression analysis results are shown in the table below.
