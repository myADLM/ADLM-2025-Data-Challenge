I. Device Description:
chromID MRSA is a selective medium for the detection of methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The selectivity of this medium is based on the presence of
antibiotics that inhibit most bacteria not belonging to the genus Staphylococcus and yeasts.
The medium favors the growth of MRSA including hetero-resistant strains, which will
appear as green colonies on the agar medium. Colorless colonies growing on the agar are
considered negative for MRSA.

Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M100-S23. Performance Standards for
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing; Twenty-third Informational Supplement, Vol. 33 No. 1,
January 2013.
L. Test Principle:
chromID MRSA is a selective medium for the detection and direct identification of MRSA.
The selectivity of this medium is based on the presence of an antibiotic mixture that inhibits
most bacteria not belonging to the genus Staphylococcus, as well as yeasts. Identification is
based on the cleavage of a chromogenic substrate in the medium by the Staphylococcus
aureus present, leading to a green coloration of the growing Staphylococcus aureus colonies.
An aliquot from a positive blood culture bottle (exhibiting Gram-positive cocci) is inoculated
directly onto the chromID MRSA agar plates and incubated aerobically at 35°-37°C for 24
hours. The cultures are examined after 24 hours incubation for the presence of green
colonies, in which the presence of at least one green colony gives the sample a positive
MRSA status. Any color of green should be interpreted as a positive result. No growth or
colonies presenting as other than green in appearance is interpreted as a negative result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To support the addition of a new specimen type (positive blood culture), a
Reproducibility Study was conducted at three sites using a blinded panel of ten well-
characterized Staphylococcus aureus strains, including both mecA positive and mecA
negative isolates. At each site, panel members were tested in triplicate at 1x103
CFU/ml each day for five days with multiple operators. To simulate positive blood
cultures, all ten strains were tested using broth from blood culture bottles as the
diluent. chromID MRSA plates were observed for the growth of green colonies at 24
hours. All strains produced the expected results with chromID MRSA (450/450).
Isolates were also plated on BAP to ensure viability and purity of cultures. Broths
from the following blood culture bottles were used during testing: BacT/Alert FA
Plus (Aerobic) and BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F Medium.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality control (QC) testing was performed at each testing site for growth/color
development on chromID MRSA. Two quality control organisms (Staphylococcus
5

--- Page 6 ---
aureus ATCC 29213 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300) were tested at each
study site on chromID MRSA for each day of testing. The strains were also
subcultured to ensure viability of the organism. QC testing results provided expected
reactions at the four testing sites on each day tested (Table 1). The submitted QC data
are acceptable.

Recovery Study
Since the current submission was for the addition of a new specimen type to the
intended use of chromID MRSA agar, a repeat of the Recovery Study was not needed
to support device performance. A short description of results from the Recovery
Study in K151688 is provided below.
According to K151688, the lowest concentration of MRSA organisms demonstrating
growth with a positive result was 103 CFU/ml for one MRSA strain (ATCC 43300)
and 105 CFU/ml for the second MRSA strain (CDC Mu3-8R) at 24 hours.
Analytical Reactivity and Expression of Resistance
Both Analytical Reactivity and Expression of Resistance Studies were conducted as
part of K151688; therefore, a repeat of these studies was not needed to support device
performance. A short summary of the results for these studies is provided below.
In K151688, a challenge set composed of 80 mecA MRSA strains and 5 mecC MRSA
strains was inoculated onto chromID MRSA agar plates at 103 CFU/ml. After 24
hours of incubation, 58/80 mecA MRSA strains and 4/5 mecC MRSA strains were
detected on the chromID MRSA agar. In addition, 28 well-characterized
Staphylococcus aureus strains (10 low level methicillin-resistant, 10 high level
methicillin-resistant, 5 borderline oxacillin-resistant, and 3 methicillin-susceptible)
were evaluated with chromID MRSA. All low level and high level methicillin-
resistant strains were detected at >105 CFU/ml.

Reactivity Study was not needed to support device performance. A short summary of
the results of the Cross-Reactivity Study is provided below.
In K091024, 110 isolates were evaluated. Certain ESBL producers with heavy
inoculum gave characteristic green color at the point of inoculation after 24 hours of
incubation. For K151688, 71 non-MRSA strains representing various bacterial and
fungal species were evaluated at 106 CFU/ml. After 24 hours of incubation, green
colonies (cross-reactivity) was observed for three Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC)
strains, two Staphylococcus sciuri (oxacillin resistant) strains, one Enterobacter
cloacae (KPC) strain, and one Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (oxacillin resistant)
strain. The Cross-Reactivity Studies were acceptable. A limitation is included in the
labeling regarding false positive results with non-MRSA strains.
Interfering Substances
Although Interference Studies were conducted as part of the anterior nares swab
specimen (K091024) and SSSI (K151688) submissions, additional studies were
performed to evaluate potential interference from 6 common medical substances in
the detection of MRSA with chromID MRSA. Results demonstrated that MRSA
strains were recovered in the presence of hemoglobin, triglyceride sera, conjugated
and unconjugated bilirubin, g globulin, and sodium polyanetholsulfonate. A separate
blood culture bottle study indicated that MRSA could be recovered from the
following blood culture bottles:
· BacT/ALERT—FA (Aerobic), FA Plus (Aerobic), FN (Anaerobic), FN Plus
(Anaerobic), SA (Standard Aerobic), SN (Standard Anaerobic)
· BacTEC—Standard Aerobic, Standard Anaerobic, PLUS Aerobic, PLUS
Anaerobic, Lytic Anaerobic, Peds PLUS Aerobic
· VersaTREK—REDOX1 (Aerobic) and REDOX2 (Anaerobic)
These study results are acceptable. Substances interfering with MRSA detection on
chromID MRSA (from K091024 and K151688) are listed as limitations in the
labeling.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
A clinical study was conducted with positive blood culture specimens (demonstrating
Gram-positive cocci) to establish performance of chromID MRSA with the new
specimen type. The performance of chromID MRSA agar was evaluated at four
clinical sites, and data was collected from 1050 positive blood culture specimens
(exhibiting Gram-positive cocci on Gram stain). Of these, 863 samples were included
in the final performance calculations for chromID MRSA after the exclusion of 187
samples. Samples were excluded for the following reasons:
· 26 samples due to the limited number of positive pediatric blood culture
bottles collected (for MRSA); all pediatric blood culture bottles were
excluded from the study
· 139 samples from blood culture bottles not indicated for the BacT/ALERT or
BACTEC systems were excluded according to the clinical protocol
· 22 samples due to additional protocol deviations—enrollment errors,
duplicate samples, no quality control performed, cultures not saved for
confirmation, no biochemical testing performed, and isolates aged greater
than 5 days
Results from chromID MRSA at 24 hours incubation were compared to results
obtained from traditional subculture on Tryptic Soy Agar with 5% sheep blood (BAP)
at 48 hours. Suspected Staphylococcus aureus isolates were identified by gram stain,
catalase, and latex agglutination. Susceptibility testing was performed using the
cefoxitin screen test (30 µg disk).
chromID MRSA plates were incubated at 35°C for 24 hours in ambient air. Green
colonies detected on chromID MRSA plates after 24 hours of incubation indicated the
presence of MRSA. Performance (sensitivity and specificity) of chromID MRSA
compared to the reference method is presented in Table 2 below. Blood culture
bottles from each automated blood culture system were stratified and analyzed
separately to determine the performance of chromID MRSA with each bottle type
(Table 3).
