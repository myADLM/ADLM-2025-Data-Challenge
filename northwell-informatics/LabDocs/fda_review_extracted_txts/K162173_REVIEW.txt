b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: There is no recognized reference standard for CYFRA 21-1. The
Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 has been standardized against the Enzymun test CYFRA 21-1
method.
Stability:
Open-vial/On-board stability: One CYFRA 21-1 CalCheck 5 lot was evaluated on
one cobas e 411 analyzer. The test and reference materials were tested in duplicate.
The test material was reconstituted and stored on-board for six hours at 20–25°C.
The reference material was a freshly reconstituted CalCheck 5. The recovery of test
material was calculated as percentage of the reference value. The data support that
the Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 CalCheck 5 is stable up to five hours on board (at 20–
25°C).
Accelerated vial stability: The studies were performed using one lot of CYFRA 21-1
CalCheck 5. One kit of CYFRA 21-1 CalCheck 5 calibrators was stored lyophilized
at 35°C (test material) for three weeks and then tested in duplicate along with a
freshly reconstituted kit of CYFRA 21-1 CalCheck 5 calibrators stored at 2–8°C
(reference material) on the cobas e 411 analyzer. Recovery of the stressed CYFRA
21-1 CalCheck 5 compared to the freshly reconstituted CYFRA 21-1 CalCheck 5 was
calculated. The stress stability model employed supports an initial shelf-life claim of
12 months when the CYFRA 21-1 CalCheck 5 is stored under normal storage
conditions of 2–8°C.

--- Page 5 ---
Accelerated Stability testing was done to support the current shelf life claim of 12
months. Additional testing was done to support the shelf-life of the CalCheck
material. CalChecks and CalSets contain the same analyte, are identical in
composition and are handled the same for testing. Real time stability was done on the
CYFRA 21-1 CalSet material and is transferable to the CalCheck material. In the
real-time stability study, the CYFRA 21-1 CalSet material was stored at 2–8°C. The
stored CalSet reagents were tested at time point T=0 and at specified intervals over
the shelf life of the device up to the planned shelf life plus one month. The recovery
was calculated compared to the reference value at Day 0. The data support that the
Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 is stable up to 29 months stored at 2–8°C.Testing was
performed using PreciControl Tumor Marker 1 and 2 (stored at -20°C) to test the
recovery of the controls after the calibration with CalSet. The Elecsys CYFRA 21-1
CalSet and Elecsys PreciControl Tumor Marker are cleared under K160915.
Value Assignment:
Value assignment testing was conducted and passed pre-defined acceptance criteria.
For each Elecsys CYFRA 21-1 CalCheck 5 lot manufactured, the CalChecks are run
in duplicate on at least three cobas e 601/MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 analyzers.
The assigned value of each CalCheck is defined as the mean value obtained over at
least six determinations (duplicate runs on at least three analyzers) of the respective
CalCheck. The assigned range is calculated as ±21% of assigned value for level 2
through 5.
