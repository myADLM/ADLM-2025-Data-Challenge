a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated according to the CLSI EP05-A3 guideline. For serum
precision, three serum based control materials and five human serum sample pools
were tested on two RX Daytona plus systems by two operators. For urine precision,
two urine based control materials, three human urine sample pools and one linearity
sample were tested on two RX Daytona Plus systems by two operators.
Testing was conducted with two lots of Randox RX Daytona Plus Magnesium (MG), one
lot on each RX Daytona Plus system, twice per day for 20 non-consecutive days. Two
replicates per run were performed for each sample for a total of 80 data points per lot.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated according to the CLSI EP06 guideline. The linearity of the
Randox RX Daytona Plus Magnesium (MG) was evaluated by preparing a series of
11 serum samples with analyte concentrations of 0.7, 1.13, 1.56, 1.99, 2.40, 2.85,
3.28, 3.71, 4.14, 4.57 and 5.00 mg/dL, and with 11 urine samples with magnesium
concentrations of 0.95, 3.36, 5.76, 8.17, 10.57, 12.98, 15.38, 17.79, 20.19, 20.60 and
25.00 mg/dL. Samples were tested in five replicates with two reagent lots on one RX
Daytona Plus system. The linear regression results between the expected values and
the observed values are summarized in the following table:
Sample Type Linear regression R2 Concentration range tested
Serum y = 0.96x + 0.08 0.999 0.70 - 5.0 mg/dL
Urine y = 0.97x + 0.32 0.998 0.95 - 25.0 mg/dL
The linearity study results support the claimed measuring ranges of 0.74 - 4.95 mg/dL
for serum and 1.01 - 23.82 mg/dL for urine.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Randox RX Daytona Plus Magnesium (MG) assay is traceable to the Magnesium
reference material NIST 909b.
Stability:
Shelf life stability protocol and acceptance criteria for Randox RX Daytona Plus
Magnesium (MG) assay were reviewed and determined to be adequate to support a
shelf life claim of 24 months at 2-8ºC and an onboard stability claim of 5 days.
The Randox Calibration Serum Level 3 Calibrator was previously cleared in k053153
and the Randox Assayed Multi-sera Level 2 and Level 3 Controls were previously
cleared in k942458.
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit studies were carried out in accordance with the CLSI EP17-A2
guideline.
The limit of blank (LoB) was determined by running a blank sample in 20 replicates
per day over 3 days using two reagent lots on one RX Daytona Plus system. The 95
percentile rank order was assigned as the LOB.
The limit of detection (LoD) was determined by running four low level samples in 20
replicates per day over 3 days using two reagent lots one RX Daytona Plus system.
LoD was calculated based on LoB (mean) + 1.65 SD (low sample).

Sample Type	Linear regression	R2	Concentration range tested
Serum	y = 0.96x + 0.08	0.999	0.70 - 5.0 mg/dL
Urine	y = 0.97x + 0.32	0.998	0.95 - 25.0 mg/dL

--- Page 6 ---
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was determined by running four low level samples
tested in 12 replicates per day over 5 days using two lots of reagents tested on one RX
Daytona Plus system. LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration that can be
detected with ≤ 20% imprecision and ≤ 20% bias.
The results are summarized in the table below:
Sample Type Serum, mg/dL Urine, mg/dL
LoB 0.28 0.44
LoD 0.39 0.68
LoQ 0.55 0.95
The detection limit studies support the claimed measuring range of 0.74 - 4.95 mg/dL
for serum and 1.01 - 23.82 mg/dl for urine samples.
e. Analytical specificity:
The Randox RX Daytona Plus Magnesium (MG) was evaluated for interference
according to the CLSI EP07-A2 guideline. Potential interfering compounds were
spiked into serum or urine samples at magnesium levels of 3.89 mg/dL and 6.32
mg/dL for serum, and 4.87mg/dL and 24.33 mg/dL for urine, respectively. Bias was
defined as the difference in results between the control sample (without the
interferent) and the mean value of test sample (containing the interferent) expressed
in percent. The sponsor considered interference significant when bias exceeded 10%.
The highest concentration of substances tested that did not cause significant
interference is summarized in the tables below.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison testing was conducted in accordance with the CLSI EP09-A3
guideline. A total of 108 serum samples (100 native samples and 8 spiked samples)
with concentration ranges of 0.85 to 4.54 mg/dL were evaluated using the Randox
RX Daytona Plus Magnesium on RX Daytona Plus system (candidate) versus the
Siemens Magnesium assay on the ADVIA 1800 system (predicate). In addition, 108
urine samples (100 native samples and 8 altered samples) with concentration ranges
of 1.15 to 23.12 mg/dL were tested by two operators using two lots of Randox RX
Daytona Plus Magnesium reagent on one RX Daytona Plus system (candidate) versus
the Siemens Magnesium assay on the ADVIA 1800 system (predicate). Testing was
performed for 3 working days and each sample was tested in singlicate.
The test method was compared to the predicate device and the following linear
regression equations were obtained:
Sample type N Sample range (mg/dL) Slope Intercept R
Serum 108 0.80 - 4.54 0.994 0.050 0.992
Urine 108 1.15 - 23.12 0.990 0.067 0.999
b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison between serum and lithium heparin plasma samples were tested
by one operator on one RX Daytona plus analyzer using two lots of Randox RX
Daytona Plus Magnesium reagents. A total of 42 matched patient sample pairs were
analyzed spanning the concentration ranges of 0.75 to 4.13 mg/dL.
