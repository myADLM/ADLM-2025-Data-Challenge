For in vitro diagnostic use
·
The POGO Automatic System is not intended for multi-patient use. Do not use
·
on more than one patient in a clinical setting such as hospitals, long-term care,
assisted living facilities, clinics or health fairs as this might pass infection from
one patient to another.
The POGO Automatic System is not intended for the quantitative measurement of
·
venous or arterial blood.
The POGO Automatic System is not intended for use on neonates.
·
The POGO Automatic System should not be used for the diagnosis of or
·
screening of diabetes.
The POGO Automatic Meter should only be used with POGO Automatic Test
·
Cartridges and POGO Control Solutions.
Individual test cells and cartridges are single use only. Do not attempt to reuse.
·
Use only fresh whole capillary blood. Do not attempt to use plasma or serum to
·
obtain an accurate blood glucose test result.
Not to be used for patients who are dehydrated, hypotensive, in shock, critically
·
ill or in a hyperosmolar state.
The hematocrit range for the POGO Automatic System is 20% – 60%. Extremely
·
high hematocrit levels above 60% may cause falsely low results and very low
hematocrit levels below 20% may cause falsely high results.
The POGO Automatic System has not been evaluated at altitudes above 10,000 feet.
·
WARNING: Each lancet is coated with a tiny amount of heparin (<0.24 IU)
·
which keeps the collected blood from clotting inside the test cell until your results
appear. Before using this device, let your doctor know if you are allergic to
heparin or have ever been diagnosed with Heparin- Induced Thrombocytopenia,
also known as HIT. HIT is a very rare condition which causes blood clots. Stop
using the device and contact your doctor if you notice unexplained swelling in
one arm or leg, sudden severe chest pain or shortness of breath, or stroke
symptoms.
4. Special instrument requirements:
POGO Automatic Meter

--- Page 3 ---
I. Device Description:
The POGO Automatic Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the POGO Automatic
Meter, disposable POGO Automatic Test Cartridges (10 tests per cartridge; glucose oxidase
from Aspergillus), and 2 levels of ready-to-use control solution wands (POGO Control
Solution, Level 1 and Level 2, previously cleared in k152493).
The POGO BGMS automatically lances, collects the blood sample and transports the sample
via capillary action to an internal test strip inside the disposable cartridge to measure blood
glucose. The meter also includes a vacuum pump to assist in sample collection.
The device has been modified by adding a reapplication feature, the ‘add more blood’ feature
to the previously cleared device (k152493). This reapplication feature detects when the
sample volume is underfilled and when no blood reaches the test pad, and allows the user 15
or 90 seconds (respectively) to add blood to the test strip.
The 10-test Test Cartridge includes 10 individually foil-sealed hollow lancets, springs, and
test strips. The lancing mechanism is built into individual test cells of the cartridge. The used
tests (test strips and lancets) are retained within the cartridge.

Yes __ X___ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test cartridge as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip
only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test pad through the lancet in
the test cartridge by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
The meter does not require calibration or coding by the user.
6. Quality Control:
Two pre-filled, single-use control solution wands are provided with the POGO
System (POGO Control Solutions Level 1 and Level 2, previously cleared in
k152493). The wands have a foil-sealed reservoir at the end that is inserted into the
meter test port. The meter automatically detects whether the sample is blood or
control solution and distinguishes from Level 1 and Level 2. The meter uses the
cartridge barcode information to evaluate the calculated control result to display a P
(pass) or F (fail). Different cartridge lots have different levels encoded on the
barcode.
Up to 500 user-accessible test results can be stored. Results are stored automatically and
identified by the meter as either a user glucose reading or a control solution result that the
meter determines by detecting the signature of a dye added to the control solution. The
meter also allows previous test results to be recalled and displayed individually or
averaged (for example, 7, 14 or 30 day averages of glucose test results).

7. Software documentation:
The software documentation was reviewed and found to be acceptable. The firm
provided documentation to support the device modification did not affect the
performance of the device. There are two error messages associated with the
reapplication feature of the device: “E-4” and “NO”, with a blood droplet icon.
“E-4” indicates that blood is detected on the test pad, but not enough blood has
been applied. “NO”, with a blood droplet icon, indicates that no blood is detected
on the test pad. The sponsor provided adequate verification and validation that the
re-app mode and associated error messages functioned as intended.
8. Infection Control Studies:
Established in k152493. No physical modifications are being made to the device,
therefore no cleaning, disinfection or robustness need to be redone.
The device system is intended for single-patient use. Cleaning and disinfection
efficacy studies were performed in k152493 demonstrating that the meter interior
and exterior can be cleaned and disinfected using Clorox Germicidal Wipes (EPA
Reg. No. 67619-12). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor using
the POGO Automatic Blood Glucose Monitoring System and demonstrating that
there was no change in performance of the system or internal and external materials
of the meter after 730 cleaning and disinfection cycles, using the chosen
disinfectant, to simulate cleaning and disinfecting the meter (exterior and interior)
every 1.5 day over the 3 years use life to support cleaning and disinfection after

--- Page 10 ---
each test cartridge use (10 tests per cartridge). Robustness testing was also
performed to support 1100 cleaning and disinfection cycles for the removable test
platform to support cleaning and disinfecting every day. Labeling was reviewed for
adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
9. This device was cleared after the FDA issued final guidance documents for
prescription use blood glucose monitoring systems (BGMS) and over-the-counter
use blood glucose monitoring systems (SMBG). However, the recommendations in
the guidance documents were not followed for this device since the submission was
received prior to the finalization of the guidance documents.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
