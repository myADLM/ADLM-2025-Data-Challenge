The AU IgG assay is a reagent for the quantitative determination of IgG immunoglobulins in
human serum, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid on Beckman Coulter AU analyzers.
When a sample is mixed with R1 buffer and R2 antiserum solution, human IgG reacts
specifically with anti-human IgG antibodies to yield insoluble aggregates. Immune
complexes formed in solution scatter light in proportion to their size, shape and
concentration. Turbidimeters measure the reduction of incident light due to reflection,
absorption or scatter. The decrease in intensity of light transmitted (increase in absorbance)
through particles suspended in solution is as a result of complexes formed during the antigen-
antibody reaction.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
IgG assay was selected to provide a representative immunoturbidimetry assay on the DxC
700 AU Clinical Chemistry Analyzer. In order to demonstrate the comparability between
the predicate device, the IgG assay used on the AU5800 instrument, and the candidate
device, the IgG assay used on the DxC 700 AU instrument, the following performance
testing was conducted:
· Precision
· Auto-dilution
· Linearity
· Prozone (hook effect)
· In use (On board) Stability and Calibrator Stability
· Sensitivity
· Reference Interval
· Interference
· Method Comparison
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability:
Repeatability (within-run) and within-laboratory (total) precision studies were
performed using pooled samples and passed the companies pre-defined acceptance
criteria.
Serum precision was performed by testing six serum and three CSF samples across
the assay range, two runs per day in duplicate for 20 days (n=80). The results are
summarized in the tables below:

Automatic Dilution:
A study was performed to verify the automatic dilution settings on the DxC 700 AU
Clinical Chemistry Analyzer. The accuracy of automatic sample pre-dilution was
tested by comparing manual dilution with the instrument’s 1:10 auto dilution
function. Samples were tested using one lot of serum IgG reagent and one lot of
calibrators. Serum pools with concentration of approximately 4000mg/dL,
5000mg/dL and 6000 mg/dL pools were diluted 1:10 with 0.9% saline manually or by
the instrument, and the diluted pools were run in 20 replicates (n=20). The results
passed the companies pre-defined acceptance criteria. The results are summarized
below:
Manual Dilution Auto-Dilution Bias

5000 mg/dL 2.9 0.6 3.4 0.7 -5%
6000 mg/dL 3.2 0.6 4.9 0.9 -8%
Autodilution is not recommended for CSF samples.
Instrument precision:
Precision studies were carried out on three DxC 700 AU analyzers
using one lot of reagent and one lot of calibrator for IgG with six pooled serum and
three pooled CSF samples. The experimental design utilized 5 replicates, once a day,

Prozone/Hook Effect:
A study was done to verify the prozone performance on the DxC 700 AU and to
confirm that the data applicable to the predicate device (AU5800) also applies to the
DxC 700 AU. Three samples with a high concentration of analyte were diluted to get
concentrations from the claimed prozone to within the measuring range. No hook
effect was seen at the following concentrations:
Matrix Prozone
Serum >30,000 mg/dL
CSF >6000 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Traceability was not provided. The calibrator is the same as in the predicate and is
traceable to the International Reference Preparation CRM470 (US designation
RPPHS lot 91/0619).
Stability:
In-Use Reagent and Calibration Stability Verification study was performed. The
objective of the study was to verify the on-board claim for the IgG reagents on the
DxC 700 AU analyzer. The stability of the reagents is the same as in the predicate
device (K073490). The results of the Reagent In-Use and Calibration Stability studies
are presented in the table below:

d. Detection limit:
LoB, LoD and LoQ studies were carried out on the DxC 700 AU using two lots of
reagent and one lot of calibrator across multiple days. Four blank samples run in five
replicates for three days and seven low level samples run in five replicates for eight
days were tested for a total of 60 blank replicates and 280 low-level sample replicates
per reagent lot. This was done for the both serum and CSF samples. The results are
summarized below:

e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity was tested by adding potential interfering substances to patient
samples or pools to determine the magnitude of the effect. Different concentrations of
interferents were tested in quadruplicate at two concentrations of the analyte on the
Beckman Coulter DxC700 AU Clinical Chemistry Analyser using one lot of reagent
and one lot of calibrator. The difference in recovery of the samples with and without
the potential interfering substances was calculated. Similar to the predicate device,
there is no interference up to the concentration levels indicated in the table below:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The study included 128 serum and 108 CSF samples that were within the assay’s
measuring range. Samples were tested on on a DxC 700 AU instrument and compared
to the predicate instrument, AU5800. The study was done in duplicates and regression

b. Matrix comparison:
A study was done to demonstrate comparable performance between serum and
plasma samples (EDTA and Lithium-Heparin). 55 sets of matched samples were
included in the analysis, using one lot of IgG reagent and one lot of calibrator. The
serum results from the IgG test was compared to the corresponding EDTA and
Lithium-Heparin plasma results from the same donor. Samples were run in duplicates
and analyzed using only the first replicate result. Data was analysed using Weighted
