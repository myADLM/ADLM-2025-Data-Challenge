assayed. An antigen-antibody reaction takes place, leading to agglutination of the latex
microparticles which causes an increase in turbidity of the reaction medium. This increase in
turbidity is reflected by an increase in absorbance, the latter being measured photometrically.
The increase in absorbance is a function of the D-dimer level present in the test sample
expressed in fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
In premarket notification K964728 the following studies were performed with STA -
Liatest® D-Di: precision/reproducibility, limit of detection, linearity, interference, and
stability studies. Additionally, instrument-specific analytical performance of STA -
Liatest® D-Di in combination with the STA-R® and STA Satellite was evaluated in
premarket notifications K983460 and K082248, respectively. The established analytical
performance characteristics cleared in K964728, K983460 and K082248 remain unchanged;
therefore, additional performance studies were not required to support substantial
equivalence in this premarket notification.
2. Comparison studies:
In premarket notification K964728, the performance of STA - Liatest® D-Di compared to
Asserachrom D-Di Kit (K862156) was evaluated. The established performance
characteristics cleared in K964728 remain unchanged; therefore, additional comparison
studies were not required to support substantial equivalence in this premarket notification.
3. Clinical studies:
The STA® - Liatest® D-Di assay was evaluated on the STA-R® (K983460), STA-R®
Evolution (K093001), STA Compact® (K093167), and STA Compact Max® (K130090)
analyzers in a multi-center study to validate exclusion of DVT in outpatients with a low
or moderate pre-test probability (PTP) score. In total, 1,219 consented patients
presenting to the emergency department or outpatient clinic with suspected venous
thromboembolism (VTE) were prospectively recruited. Overall, samples were collected
from a total of 16 sites; 9 in the United States and 7 in France, Italy, Spain and Canada.
The Wells’ score clinical PTP assessment model was used to categorize patients as low,
moderate, or high probability for suspected DVT. Patients with a high PTP score were
excluded from the study.
Of the 1,219 patients, 254 were excluded from analysis; of which 158 had a high PTP
score and 96 were excluded on the basis of the defined exclusion criteria, for a total of
980 patients included in the data analysis. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive
value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) with the lower bound of two-sided 95%
confidence intervals (LCL) were obtained with the STA - Liatest ® D-Di clinical cut-off
of 0.50 µg/mL (FEU). The overall prevalence of DVT in the 980 patients was 8.4% (85
of 980) with 6.0% (22 of 369) in the U.S. population and 10.3% (63 of 611) in the
Canadian and European populations.

Liatest ® D-Di was established as < 0.50 µg/mL (FEU).
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
