L. Test Principle:
The determination of soluble antigen concentration by turbidimetric methods involves the
reaction with specific antiserum to form insoluble complexes. When light is passed through
the suspension formed, a portion of the light is transmitted and focused onto a photodiode by
an optical lens system. The amount of transmitted light is indirectly proportional to the
specific protein concentration in the test sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
All results from all studies met the manufacturer’s pre-specified acceptance criteria.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The studies were based on CLSI EP05-A2; five sample preparations were tested in
two runs per day (each of the two runs in duplicate) over 21 days using three
analysers and three lots for a total of 84 replicates. A summary of the results is
shown below. All results are in IU/mL.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed following CLSI guideline EP6-A. The linearity of
this assay has been confirmed by dilution of serum samples with analyte-depleted
serum to cover the range 7–100 IU/mL (total of 9 dilutions). Deviation from
linearity calculated according to CLSI guideline EP6-A was ≤ ±5%. The regression
equation for the linear range (7–100 IU/mL) was y = 0.999x + 0.04 IU/mL–.
Antigen Excess: No antigen excess was observed up to a level of 59 times the top of
the calibration curve at the standard 1+0 sample dilution. This is equivalent to 5900
IU/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
(i) Traceability: The calibration of the assay is traceable to the International
Reference Preparation of Rheumatoid Arthritis Serum WHO 64/2.
(ii) Kit Stability:
Unopened kit stability- The manufacturer provided data that supports a real-
time stability claim of 12 months.
Open-vial stability- The manufacturer provided data that the RF Reagent,
Calibrator and Controls can be stored opened at 2–8°C for up to 3 months.
On-board stability- The manufacturer provided data that the RF Reagent can
be stored on-board the Optilite Analyzer for at least 30 days.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limits of the assay were evaluated based on CLSI EP17-A. Study
results follow the explanation below:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) was based on 60 determinations of a blank sample

(consisting of a pool of analyte-depleted samples) and was estimated as the 95%
percentile of the distribution.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was calculated according to the equation LoB +
1.645 x SDs where SDs, the standard deviation, was based on six determinations
of four samples with analyte levels near the lower limit of the reportable range.
The Limits of Quantitation (LoQ) were calculated from the total error of the LoD
study; four separate dilutions of the International Reference Preparation were
prepared, and tested three times each on two lots using the test assay on the Optilite
analyser over four days. The total error at LoQ was within the maximum allowable
total error for each sample matrix. The bottom of the measuring range, 7 IU/mL is set
at the limit of quantitation (LoQ) for this assay.
Summary:
LoB = 0.000 IU/mL
LoD = 0.142 IU/mL
LoQ = 7 IU/mL
e. Analytical specificity:
Interferences were assessed according to CLSI EP7-A2 by testing samples at different
RF concentrations (8.3, 12.2, 80). Each sample was spiked with interfering substances
and tested and compared with results from non-spiked samples. The data
demonstrated that the assay was not affected by the following substances at the
concentrations given below.

Ascorbic Acid 342 µmol/L Acetylsalicylic 1.815 mmol/L

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A comparison study was performed by testing the predicate and the Optilite RF Kit
with 103 samples (including 19 Rheumatoid Arthritis, 1 Osteoarthritis, 1 Psoriatic
arthritis, 1 SLE, 3 Sjögrens Syndrome, 3 HCV, 1 Ulcerative Colitis, , 2 Syphylis, 2
Systemic Sclerosis, 1 Vasculitis, and 69 other clinical conditons) all within the
assays’ measuring ranges; the samples covered the range 8.1–589 IU/mL. The
Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r value) was 0.984 and the Passing Bablok
regression analysis generated the following results:
y = 0.90x + 2.51 IU/mL (y = Optilite; x = predicate)
(95% CI: Intercept = 0.76–3.88; Slope = 0.87–0.97)
The same comparison study was also analyzed by calculating the % Positive
Agreement, % Negative Agreement and % Overall Agreement calculations with the
following results:
Predicate Assay

Optilite Positive 92 2* 94
RF Kit Negative 4** 5 9
Total 96 7 103
Positive Percent Agreement: 95.8% (92/96) (95% CI: 95.8% – 98.4%)
Negative Percent Agreement: 71.4% (5/7) (95% CI: 35.9% – 91.8%)
Overall Percent Agreement: 94.2 % (97/103) (95% CI: 87.8% – 97.3%)

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected value of rheumatoid factor in normal serum in the predicate assay is < 12.5
IU/mL. To verify that the predicate’s reference range can be used in the Optilite assay,
50 apparently normal U.S. serum samples were tested with a protocol based on CLSI
C28-A3. Only one of the 50 samples exceeded 12.5 IU/mL, thus verifying the predicate
device’s reference interval. The manufacturer encourages users to develop their own
laboratory’s reference range.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
