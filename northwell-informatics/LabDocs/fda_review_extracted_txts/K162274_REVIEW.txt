I. Device Description:
The Solana Strep Complete assay detects Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS; β-hemolytic Group
A Streptococci) and Streptococus dysgalactiae DNA isolated from throat swab specimens
obtained from patients with the signs and symptoms of pharyngitis. The assay consists of
three major steps: 1) sample processing 2) specimen preparation, and 3) amplification and
detection of target sequences specific to GAS and Streptococus dysgalactiae, respectively,
using isothermal Helicase-Dependent Amplification (HDA) in the presence of target-specific
fluorescence probe.
Patient specimen on a throat swab is transferred to a Lysis Tube and subjected to heat
treatment at 95°C for 5 minutes. The heat-treated sample is added to a Dilution Tube, and
2

--- Page 3 ---
then transferred to a Reaction Tube. The Reaction Tube contains lyophilized HDA reagents,
dNTPs, primers and probes. Once rehydrated with the diluted sample, the Reaction Tube is
placed in the Solana for amplification and detection of GAS- and Streptococus dysgalactiae -
specific target sequences. Target sequences are amplified by analyte-specific primers and
detected using fluorescence probes included in each Reaction Tube. Two competitive process
controls (PRC) are included in the Lysis Tube to monitor sample processing, inhibitory
substances in clinical samples, reagent failure or device failure. The PRC target is amplified
by target-specific primers and detected by a PRC specific fluorescence probe.
Solana instrument platform measures and interprets the fluorescent signal, using on-board
method-specific algorithms. Solana instrument will then report the test results to the user on
the display screen. Results can also be printed out. The total time for assay completion from
specimen processing to result is ≤ 25 minutes.

L. Test Principle:
Patient specimen on a throat swab is transferred to a Lysis Tube and subjected to heat
treatment at 95°C for 5 minutes. The heat-treated sample is added to a Dilution Tube, and
then transferred to two Reaction Tubes; one for GAS and one for S. dysgalactiae. Each
Reaction Tube contains lyophilized helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) reagents,
dNTPs, primers and probes for GAS or S. dysgalactiae. Once rehydrated with the diluted
sample, the Reaction Tube is placed in Solana for amplification and detection of GAS- and S.
dysgalactiae-specific target sequences. Target sequences are amplified by analyte-specific
primers and detected using fluorescence probes included in each Reaction Tube. Two
competitive process controls (PRC) are included in the Lysis Tube to monitor sample
processing, inhibitory substances in clinical samples, reagent failure or device failure. The
PRC target is amplified by target-specific primers and detected by a PRC specific
fluorescence probe.
The target and PRC probes are labeled with a quencher on one end and a fluorophore on the
other end (see Table 1 for associated fluorophores).
Table 1: Solana Strep Complete Probe Labels
Detectant Fluorescence Dye/Channel
GAS or S. dysgalactiae Probe FAM
Process Controls (PRC) CY5
Reference (differentiates GAS from S. ROX
dysgalactiae reaction mix)
The target and PRC fluorescent probes have a RNA linker that is cleaved by RNaseH2 upon
annealing to GAS, S. dysgalactiae or PRC amplicons, and the fluorescence signal increases
due to separation of fluorophore from quencher. The Solana Instrument measures and
interprets the fluorescent signal, using on-board method-specific algorithms. Solana
instrument will then report the test results to the user on its display screen, and it can print
out the results via a printer.

4) Moderate Positive (MP), 3.0 x LoD
Contrived specimens were made by diluting frozen bacterial stocks of GAS and S.
dysgalactiae to the concentration noted above. The LoD values were based on the
values obtained in the LoD study described in section M.1.d below. See section M.2.b
below for details on the matrix equivalency and freeze-thaw study.
Three replicates of each panel member for each analte and the controls were
processed and tested on the Solana Strep Complete assay at each site by two operators
for five non-consecutive days using three instruments (2 operators x 3 replicates x 5
days x 3 sites = 90 results per concentration for each analyte). The LoD values were
based on the values obtained in the LoD study. The reproducibility study results are
acceptable. The results are shown in the Table 2

Precision Study
Within-laboratory, inter-instrument precision was evaluated for the Solana Strep
Complete Assay using the same panel of contrived specimens as in the reproducibility
study above.
The study was conducted over 12 days at one site (in-house) with two operators (2
operators x 12 days x 3 replicates = 72 results per panel member). One operator used
one instrument and the other used two instruments. The results are shown in Table 3.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Solana Strep Complete assay incorporates process controls (PRC) in the lysis buffer
tube that is used to monitor sample processing and evaluate the presence of
substances inhibitory to helicase dependent amplification (HDA) and to confirm the
integrity of assay reagents. The Quidel Molecular A + G Streptococci Control Set
#M111, which contains positive and negative controls, serves as an external
processing and extraction controls for the Solana Strep Complete assay and were run
each day of testing.
Studies were performed to determine the stability of specimens collected using the
following routinely used swab systems: nylon, rayon and polyester swabs in Amies
media, and rayon and polyester swabs in Stuart media, and rayon swabs in Amies gel.
Freshly grown stocks of GAS or S. dysgalactiae of known titer were used to spike the
swabs listed above. Triplicate testing for each analyte with each condition with each
collection/transport system listed above demonstrated that specimens can be stored at
25°C ± 2°C for 2 days and then at 2 to 8 oC for up to 6 more days prior to being tested
in the Solana Strep Complete assay. A separate study was performed where the
spiked samples were stored at £-15oC or £-70oC for a minimum of 32 days before
testing.

d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) of the Solana Strep Complete assay was determined
using contrived stocks of two GAS strains, one strain of Group C S. dysgalactiae
subsp. equisimilis and one strain of Group G S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. For
each strain, stocks were prepared by suspending and diluting freshly grown colonies
on to 5% sheep blood tryptic soy agar. Colony counts from preliminary serial
dilutions were associated with optical density to determine the LoD. The LoD was
defined as the point at which at least 95% of all replicates tested positive (C ). The
95
GAS strains were serially diluted then spiked onto swabs. For each strain, the LoD
was confirmed by testing 20 replicates for each of three dilutions at 0.3 x LoD, 1 x
LoD and 3 x LoD. Each dilution for each strain was confirmed by plating on 5%
sheep blood tryptic soy agar, incubating and counting colonies. The LoD study results
are shown in Table 4.

Based these studies, the highest observed LoD for Streptococcus pyogenes and
Streptococcus dysgalactiae using the Solana Strep Complete Assay is 8.5 x 104
CFU/mL and 7.1 x 105 CFU/mL, respectively. These LoD values are described in the
labeling and they were used in determining the spiking levels for all subsequent
analytical studies.
e. Analytical reactivity:
Inclusivity studies were conducted with seven GAS strains, 14 Group C S.
dysgalactiae strains and 11 Group G S. dysgalactiae strains (in addition to the four
strains from the LoD studies above) against three different reagent lots with three
instruments. Swabs were prepared as described in M.1.d above and run with the
Solana Strep Complete assay at the concentrations described in Table 5. The
inclusivity study results and the final organism concentrations tested are shown in
Table 5.

f. Analytical specificity:
i. Microbial cross-reactivity
An in silico BLAST analysis of primers used in the Solana Complete Strep assay
against the NCBI database against 60 potential interfering virus/organisms did not
show evidence of cross-reactivity.
The Solana Complete Strep assay was tested in the presence of 45 other
microorganisms commonly found in throat specimens. Each potentially
interfering microorganism was tested in the presence of 2 x LoD of each of the
GAS and S. dysgalactiae organisms used in the LoD studies in M.1.d above, in
the presence of clinically relevant levels of viruses (e.g., 105pfu/ml) and
bacteria/yeast (e.g., 106cfu/mL). All strain combinations were spiked into
contrived negative matrix. The strains included in the cross-reactivity study are
shown in Table 6.

ii. Microbial interference
Microbial interference studies were conducted in triplicate with each of the 45
bacteria, yeast and viruses listed above in Table 6 in triplicate in the presence of
clinically relevant levels of viruses (e.g., 105 PFU/ml) and bacteria/yeast (e.g., 106
CFU/ml) or higher. All of the strains used in the LoD studies in M.1.d above
strains were prepared as described in the cross-reactivity studies in M.1.f.i above
along with the spiked onto the swab at a 2 x LoD concentration. These studies
were conducted using three instruments. None of the bacteria, yeast or viruses
demonstrated interference with the detection of the Group A Streptococcal strains
in any of the replicates tested.
These study results are acceptable and they are described in the labeling.
iii. Interfering substances
28 chemical and biological substances were evaluated for potential to interfere
with the Solana Strep Complete assay, including blood (5% v/v) and human saliva
(10% v/v). Each substance was tested in triplicate using the strains used in the
LoD studies in M.1.d above at 2 x LoD at medically relevant concentrations.
None of the substances tested were found to interfere with the Solana Strep
Complete assay in any of the replicates tested.
These study results are acceptable and they are described in the labeling.
iv. Carryover/Cross-contamination
A study to assess carryover contamination was conducted by three operators using
three different Solana Instruments with one GAS strain (ATCC 19615) and one S.
dysgalactiae subsp equisimilis strain (ATCC 10009). Fifty high positive contrived
specimens for each analyte (at ~2000 x LoD) and 50 negative contrived
specimens were spiked onto swabs and tested with the Solana Strep Complete
assay. Five positive and five negative swabs were tested in an alternating order.
No carryover/cross contamination was observed in the course of this study.
These study results are acceptable and they are described in the labeling.
g. Assay cut-off:
Cut-off values are based on set time thresholds for amplification and were determined
based on results from preliminary LoD studies and initial clinical specimen testing.
The cut-offs were set based on the longest time observed to achieve a valid GAS and
S. dysgalactiae results from these studies.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
A comparison study was conducted between negative clinical matrix and a contrived
negative matrix in order to validate the use of the contrived negative matrix in place
of a clinical negative matrix for use in the analytical studies (described in section M1
above).
Contrived negative matrix consisted of liquid Amies transport medium, Porcine
Gastric Mucin (PGM), Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), Bovine Serum Albumin and
sodium azide. The matrix comparison study results are shown in Table 7.

These studies demonstrate that freezing does not appear to impact results for the
Solana Strep Complete assay, in the context of the contrived analytical studies
submitted in this submission. These study results are acceptable and support the use
of frozen specimens in contrived matrix to facilitate the conduct of analytical studies.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The clinical performance of the Solana Strep Complete assay was demonstrated with
2688 prospectively collected fresh throat specimens at three sites across the United
States. The assay was evaluated for the qualitative detection and differentiation of
GAS and S. dysgalactiae using nucleic acids isolated from the patients’ throat swabs.
A single specimen was collected per patient. Samples were collected using Polyester
or Rayon Swab and transported in liquid Amies or liquid Stuart non-nutritive
medium.
All 2688 fresh throat swab specimens were processed for culture and identification of
GAS, GCS and GGS at the testing sites using well-accepted microbiological methods.
Cultured isolates were typed by latex agglutination. β-hemolytic isolates that were
typed as Group C or G were subcultured and the species were determined using an
FDA-cleared MALDI-TOF assay. Swab transport fluid was also tested using another
FDA-cleared nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) and cultured at a central
reference laboratory.
A specimen was considered positive if culture from the swab, swab transport fluid or
the results from another FDA cleared assay were positive for GAS and/or GCS/GGS.
Two results were determined to be invalid in these studies. The invalid rate observed
during the clinical prospective study for this device was 0.07% (2/2688). The
breakdown of performance by analyte based on the 2686 valid swab specimens is
summarized in Tables 9 and 10.
