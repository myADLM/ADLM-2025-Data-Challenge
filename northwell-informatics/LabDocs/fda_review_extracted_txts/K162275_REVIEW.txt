L. Test Principle:
The substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate is hydrolyzed by alkaline phosphatase from the
sample, in the presence of magnesium ions, to form p-nitrophenol which is yellow in color
and can be read at 405 nm. The intensity of color produced is proportional to the alkaline
phosphatase activity in the sample.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted in accordance with CLSI EP05-A2. Precision
studies were performed by two operators on two RX Daytona Plus systems using
serum-based control material, altered human serum samples, and unaltered human
serum samples. Testing was performed using two reagent lots of Randox RX
Daytona Plus Alkaline Phosphatase (one on each analyzer), in two runs per day for 20
non-consecutive days. Two replicates per run were performed for each sample. Both
lots yielded similar results. The results of one representative lot are summarized in the
following table:
Within-Run Total
ALP Mean
Sample N SD %CV SD %CV

QC1 80 127.83 0.5 0.4 2.87 2.2
QC2 80 328.94 1.19 0.4 6.53 2.0

Serum 3 80 244.36 3.63 1.5 3.77 1.5
Serum 4 80 349.39 4.41 1.3 5.31 1.5
Serum 5 80 24.86 0.80 3.2 1.31 5.3

Serum 8 80 895.00 4.49 0.5 30.79 3.4
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP06-A. Low and high
concentrated alkaline phosphatase pools were mixed to create 11 intermediate levels:
7.94, 99.93, 192.35, 293.09, 389.59, 481.23, 568.36, 658.86, 748.97, 839.03, and
918.42 U/L. Each level was run in replicates of five on two lots of Randox RX Plus
Alkaline Phosphatase reagent on one RX Daytona Plus system. The following linear
regression equation was obtained:
y=1.00 x + 6.49, R= 1.00
The results of the linearity study support the sponsor’s claimed measuring range of 8
to 918 U/L.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: Refer to k053153 Randox Calibration Serum Level 3 Randox Assayed
Multi-sera Level 2 and Level 3. Randox Calibration Serum Level 3 is traceable to
ALP internal master reference calibrator.
Stability: Refer to k053153 Randox Calibration Serum Level 3 Randox Assayed
Multi-sera Level 2 and Level 3.
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2. The limit
of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantification (LoQ) were
determined using two lots of reagents on one RX Daytona Plus system. The LoB was
determined by testing 60 samples of artificial serum diluent and was determined to be
0.14 U/L. The LoD for ALP is 1.0 U/L based on 240 determinations with 4 low level
serum samples (60 runs per level). The LoQ was determined by running 4 low level
serum samples. The sponsor defines LoQ as the lowest concentration which meets an
imprecision of <10% bias. The LoQ was determined to be 7.5 U/L
LoB LoD LoQ
0.14 U/L 1.0 U/L 7.5 U/L
The claimed measuring range of the assay is 8 to 918 U/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
The effects of potential interferents were determined by calculating the mean value
of the spiked interferent with the corresponding control sample. The spiked sample
results were compared to control samples prepared without the potential
interferents. The sponsor defines significant interference as ± ≤ 10% bias from the
control result. The following substances were tested up to the levels indicated at
alkaline phosphatase concentrations of 80 and 240 U/L:
Highest level tested that demonstrated no
Interferents
significant interference (≤ 10% bias)
Hemoglobin 375 mg/dL
Total bilirubin 60 mg/dL
Conjugated bilirubin 60 mg/dL
Ascorbic acid 6 mg/dL
Intralipid 750 mg/dL
Triglycerides 2000 mg/dL

The sponsor includes the following limitations in the labeling:
“Use only non-hemolyzed serum”
“Use only heparinized plasma that is free from hemolysis.”
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP9-A2 to
compare the candidate device to the predicate device, the Siemens Alkaline
Phosphatase assay. A total of 106 serum patient samples spanning the range of 8 to
894 U/L were tested by one operator using one lot of reagent on one RX Daytona
Plus analyzer. Less than 10% of the samples were altered by dilution or spiking in
order to cover the claimed measuring range. The test method was compared to the
predicate device and the following linear regression equation was obtained:
y = 1.005 x - 3.95, r = 0.999
b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed on one RX Daytona plus system using two
lots of Randox RX Daytona Plus Alkaline Phosphatase reagent. A total of 46
matched serum and lithium heparin plasma samples were analyzed spanning the
result range of 15.3 to 773.1 U/L. The alkaline phosphatase results from the serum
samples were compared to the results of the lithium heparin plasma samples and the
following linear regression equation was obtained:
y = 1.00 x - 0.13, r = 1.000
The results of the matrix comparison study support the sponsor claim that serum and
lithium heparin plasma samples can be tested with this assay.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.

b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Reference intervals cited from literature were verified using the CLSI C28-A3 guideline.
Human serum from 30 normal donors were tested in singlicate on the RX Daytona Plus.
The sponsor claims that there were no outliers and that the values were compared to the
cited ranges for alkaline phosphatase. Results of the study indicate that all values
reported in range for healthy individuals. The sponsor states in the labeling that “Each
laboratory should establish its own normal range based upon specific population
encountered in daily laboratory operation. This is recommended because normal ranges
are affected by age, sex, diet, geographical location and other factors.”
Alkaline phosphatase reference ranges:
Adults: 30-120 U/L

Pagana, 2006, page 49.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and
supports a substantial equivalence decision.
