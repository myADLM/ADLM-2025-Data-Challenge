electrolyte pH and electroosmotic flow.
The CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument has silica capillaries functioning in parallel allowing
12 simultaneous analyses of HbA1c quantification in a whole blood sample. A sample
dilution with hemolysing solution is prepared and injected by aspiration at the anodic end of
the capillary. A high voltage protein separation is then performed and direct detection of the
hemoglobins is made at the cathodic end of the capillary at 415 nm, which is the absorbance
wavelength specific to hemoglobins. Before each run, the capillaries are washed with a wash
solution and prepared for the next analysis with buffer.
Direct detection provides accurate relative quantification of individual hemoglobin A1c
fraction. In addition, the high resolution of CAPI 3 HbA1c procedure allows the
quantification of HbA1c even in the presence of labile HbA1c, carbamylated and acetylated
hemoglobins, and major hemoglobin variants.
By using an alkaline pH buffer, normal and abnormal (or variant) hemoglobins are detected
in the following order, from cathode to anode: A2/C, E, S/D, F, A0, other Hb (including
minor HbA1) and then HbA1c.
At the end of analysis, relative quantification of individual HbA1c fraction is performed
automatically. The HbA1c concentrations are standardized and indicated in %HbA1c
(DCCT/NGSP) and in mmol/mol (IFCC) units.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Four different EDTA whole blood samples and four whole blood quality control

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the CAPI 3 HbA1c procedure was evaluated based on CLSI EP06-A
guideline Evaluation of the Linearity Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A
Statistical Approach. Two blood samples, including a normal sample with HbA1c
concentration at 3.8 % HbA1c (18 mmol/mol) and an elevated HbA1c level sample
with HbA1c concentration at 17.3 % HbA1c (166 mmol/mol) were mixed within
different proportions and the mixtures were electrophoresed with the CAPI 3 Hb A1c
procedure. For each mixture, samples were analyzed in triplicate.
The following table summarizes the results obtained for the 1st order linear regression
generated using both NGSP (%HbA1c) and IFCC units (mmol/mol).

The study supports the sponsors claimed linearity range of 3.8 - 17.3 % HbA1c (18 -
166 mmol/mol). The reportable range of the device is from 4.0% to 14.7% HbA1c
(20 - 138 mmol/mol).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The CAPI 3 HbA1c assay is certified with the National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP). The NGSP certification expires in one year. See
NGSP website for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
Value assignment:
The HbA1c CAPILLARY Calibrators were previously cleared and reviewed in
k122101 and k133344. The MULTI-SYSTEM HbA1c CAPILLARY Control (2)
values are assigned by multiple measurements using multiple CAPILLARYS 2
FLEX-PIERCING instruments and IFCC traceable calibrators.
Stability:
The stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and determined to be
adequate. The expiration dates of the different components of the CAPI 3 HbA1c kit
are indicated as follows:
Kit Component Shelf-Life On Board Stability
CAPI 3 HbA1c
3 years at 2-8°C and 15-30°C 2 months
hemolysing solution
CAPI 3 HbA1c buffer 3 years at 2-8°C 1 month
CAPI 3 HbA1c wash
3 years at 2-8°C and 15-30°C 121 days
solution
The MULTI-SYSTEM HbA1c CAPILLARY Control (2) is demonstrated to be stable
for 1 day at 2-8°C, up to 6 months at -22°C/-18°C. The labeling states that the
MULTI-SYSTEM HbA1c CAPILLARY Control (2) should not be frozen and thawed
more than 30 times.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined by assaying
five samples without HbAc1 and five low HbA1c samples, respectively. Both LoB
and LoD were tested according to CLSI guideline EP17-A2. The results are as
follows:
LoB = 0.1%, LoD = 1.2%

e. Analytical specificity:
i. Endogenous Interference
Studies were performed to assess endogenous substances that could interfere with
the CAPI 3 HbA1c assay. The interfering substances were evaluated in venous
whole blood EDTA samples that contained two to four different concentrations of
HbA1c (including normal, around cut-off and high levels of HbA1c). Samples
containing potential interferents were tested and the results compared to those
obtained from control samples containing no potential interfering substances.
Samples were analyzed in triplicates. The sponsor’s definition of non-significant
interference is ≤0.3% HbA1c (or ≤ 9.9 mmol/mol) between the tested and the
control samples. The results are summarized in the following table:
Concentration at which no significant interference (≤0.3%) was observed
Potential interfering substance Concentration
Ascorbic Acid 60 mg/dL (3.41 mM)
Bilirubin 35.9 mg/dL (614 mM)

ii. Exogenous Interference
Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could interfere
with the CAPI 3 HbA1c assay. The interfering substances were evaluated in venous
whole blood EDTA samples that contained two to four different concentrations of
HbA1c (including around cut-off and high levels of HbA1c). Samples containing
potential interferents were tested and the results compared to those obtained from
control samples containing no potential interfering substances. Samples were
analyzed in triplicates. The sponsor’s definition of non-significant interference is
≤0.3% HbA1c (or ≤ 9.9 mmol/mol) between the tested and the control samples. The
results are summarized in the following table:

iii. Cross Reactivity with Hemoglobin Derivatives
To study interference from carbamylated hemoglobin, four EDTA whole blood
patient samples with HbA1c concentrations at ~5.2%, ~6.9%, ~8.8% and ~11.9%
were split into two aliquots. One aliquot, at each HbA1c level, was spiked with 1
mmol/L of potassium cyanate and incubated for 3 hours at 37˚C. Another aliquot, at
each HbA1c level, was incubated for 3 hours at 37˚C. Samples were then analyzed
on the CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument using the CAPI 3 HbA1c assay kit.
Samples were analyzed in triplicate. The sponsor’s definition of non-significant
interference is ≤ 0.3 HbA1c% between the tested and the control samples.
The sponsor concluded that presence of up to 5.6% carbamylated hemoglobin does
not interfere with this assay.
To study interference from labile hemoglobin, four EDTA whole blood patient
samples with HbA1c concentrations at ~5.1%, ~6.7%, 8.4% and ~12.3% were split
into two aliquots. One aliquot, at each HbA1c level, was spiked with glucose (50
g/L) and incubated for 3 hours at 37˚C. Another aliquot, at each HbA1c level, was
incubated for 3 hours at 37˚C. Samples were then analyzed on the CAPILLARYS 3
TERA instrument using the CAPI 3 HbA1c assay kit. Samples were tested in
triplicate. The sponsor’s definition of non-significant interference is ≤ 0.3 HbA1c%
between the tested and the control samples.
The sponsor concluded that labile HbA1c up to 1257 mg/dL (12.7%) does not
interfere with this assay.
To study interference from acetylated hemoglobin, four EDTA whole blood
samples with HbA1c concentrations at ~5.7%, 6.3%, 8.1% and ~ 12.1% were split
into two aliquots. One aliquot, at each HbA1c level, was used as the control sample
and the other aliquot was spiked with acetylsalicylic acid (10 mmol/L) and
incubated for 4 hours at 37˚C. All aliquots were tested on the CAPILLARYS 3
TERA instrument using the CAPI 3 HbA1c assay kit. Samples were tested in
triplicate. The sponsor’s definition of non-significant interference is ≤ 0.3 HbA1c%.
The sponsor concluded that acetylated hemoglobin up to 2.1% does not interfere
with this assay.
iv. Hemoglobin Variant Interference
A hemoglobin variant interference study was carried out using samples known to
contain Hemoglobin variants S, E, D and C. These variant samples were tested on
the CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument using the CAPI 3 HbA1c assay kit. The
sponsor’s definition of non-significant interference is ±10% difference between the
candidate method and the comparative method. The testing results show there is no
significant interference for Hb S (≤ 40.4%), Hb E (≤ 26.6%), Hb D (≤ 44.2%) and
Hb C (≤ 36.9%).

--- Page 12 ---
The sponsor includes the following limitation in their labeling: “due to the number
of variants, the presence of another hemoglobin variant may be observed in the
HbA1c migration zone; in the case of a shoulder on HbA1c, no result will be
reported by the software.”
A variant interference study was carried out to study the variant interference from
Hemoglobin F. Twenty-two different EDTA whole blood samples with HbA1c
concentrations between 5.1 and 15.1% and varying concentrations of HbF (from 1.5
to 23.7%) were tested on the CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument using the CAPI 3
HbA1c assay kit. The sponsor’s definition of non-significant interference is ±10%
difference between the candidate method and the comparative method.
The testing results show there is no significant interference for Hb F ≤ 23%
therefore the sponsor has included the following limitation in their labeling: Levels
of Hb F up to 23 % in the blood sample do not interfere with HbA1c fraction
quantification, a result is reported by the software when the Hb F level is higher
than 23 % along with a warning message “Atypical profile - Possible quantitative
interference if Hb F or variant > 23 %”.
An additional variant interference study was carried out to study the variant
interference from Hemoglobin A2 (HbA2). Four EDTA whole blood samples with
HbA1c concentrations at ~5.0%, 6.7%, 9.0%, and 11.8% were split into two
aliquots. One aliquot, at each HbA1c level, was used as the control sample and the
other aliquot was spiked with varying concentrations of purified HbA2 (from 9.3 to
11.3%). Samples were analyzed in triplicates on the CAPILLARYS 3 TERA
instrument using the CAPI 3 HbA1c assay kit. The sponsor’s definition of non-
significant interference is ≤0.3% difference between the tested and the control
samples.
The sponsor concluded that Hb A2 up to 11.3% does not interfere with this assay.

or mobile device?
Yes X or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ________ or No X

3. Specimen Identification:
Barcode reader
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Use K2 EDTA or K3 EDTA whole blood samples. Capped primary sample tubes
(containing over 800 µL) are placed on sample racks, which are loaded on the
CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument. The mixing system with rack inversion allows
homogenization before sample collection by the sample probe directly on capped tubes
for the HbA1c analysis.
5. Calibration:
Calibration must be performed for the first use of the HbA1c analysis program with the
CAPILLARYS 3 instrument and after having changed the lot number of calibrators.
Additional calibration should be performed after having changed the lot number of
analysis buffer, after technical operation, in case of analyses of controls giving HbA1c
values outside the expected values (and after having confirmed this deviation by a second
analysis of blood controls), after having changed capillaries (whatever the number of

--- Page 16 ---
replaced capillaries), and at least every 2 months. Calibration is performed using the
HbA1c CAPILLARY Calibrators.
6. Quality Control:
Labeling for the device states that it is recommended to analyze one of the two HbA1c
CAPILLARY Controls on whole capillaries after capillaries activation, after each
calibration of the instrument performed with the HbA1c CAPILLARY Calibrators, and
after a capillary cleaning sequence with CAPICLEAN. In routine, it is recommended to
analyze the HbA1c control at the beginning and at the end of the analysis series,
alternating the Control 1 and the Control 2. In the case of a migration shift leading to a
non-recognition of fractions, it is recommended to analyze immediately one of the two
HbA1c controls.
