I. Device Description:
Puritan Fecal Opti-Swab Collection and Transport System is comprised of a peel pouch
containing a rayon tipped swab applicator for collecting specimens and a polypropylene,
round-bottomed, capped tube containing 2 ml of a modified s Cary-Blair medium.
Cary-Blair medium is a non-nutritive balanced salt solution containing disodium phosphate
to provide buffering capability, sodium chloride and calcium chloride to provide essential
ions that help maintain osmotic balance. Agar is used to increase the viscosity of the
medium. Sodium thioglycollate and L-cysteine helps maintain an oxygen-reduced
environment to help maintain the viability of enteric bacteria during the transport to the
laboratory.
The liquid modified Cary Blair medium is composed of the following components:
· Sodium chloride
· Disodium Phosphate
· Sodium thioglycollate
· Calcium chloride

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
The performance of the Puritan Fecal Opti-Swab Collection and Transport System was
determined using roll plate and swab elution techniques outlined in the Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M40-A2 document. Bacterial viability studies
were performed. The swabs from each transport system were inoculated with a specified
volume of bacterial concentrations prepared in a fecal matrix and/or 0.85% phosphate
buffered saline (PBS). A select group of organisms were also tested in a fecal matrix (See
Table 1). Fecal matrix was made by diluting pre-screened negative fresh clinical fecal
material in 0.85% PBS to a 30% concentration by volume.
These swabs were then placed in their respective transport tubes and held at various time
intervals; at the designated time intervals the swabs were removed and processed. To test
the viability at various time intervals the inoculated swabs were held at room temperature
for 0, 24, and 48 hours and refrigerated for 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours.
The nine ATCC strains listed in Table 1 below were used in this study to evaluate the
performance of the Puritan Fecal Opti-Swab Collection and Transport System. This
device was tested using the swabs included with the transport kit. Viability studies were
conducted in duplicate at 0, 24, and 48 at room temperature (20-25°C) and at 0, 24, 48,
and 72 hours at refrigerated temperatures (2-8°C) using the Roll-Plate and Swab Elution
Methods for all strains except C. difficile. For C. difficile, viability studies were
conducted in duplicate at 0 and 48 at room temperature (20-25°C) and at 0, 24 and 48
hours at refrigerated temperatures (2-8°C) using the Roll-Plate and Swab Elution
Methods.

Roll-Plate Method:
Bacterial suspensions were prepared from fresh18-24 hour cultures of each
microorganism in a separate vial containing 10 mL of 0.85% sterile saline to obtain 1.5 x
108 CFU/mL suspensions. A select group of organisms were also tested in a separate vial

containing 10 mL fecal matrix. One log serial dilutions were made and 100 µL aliquots
10
of dilutions were absorbed into the swabs and immediately placed into the Puritan Fecal
Opti-Swab Collection and Transport System. For fecal specimens, the final dilution prior
to swab inoculation was done with fecal matrix to maximize the amount of fecal material
on the swab.
After incubation at each time point, the swabs were removed from the transport tubes and
used to inoculate the entire surface of the appropriate agar plate. The plates were
incubated in appropriate culture conditions for 24-48 hours or until countable colonies
were visible. Manual colony counts were conducted for each time interval for each swab-
organism combination. The dilution yielding colony counts within the countable
tolerance zone (approximately between 25 and 250 colonies) was reported. Log
10
increases or decreases in survival are based on a comparison between time-zero and the
last time point collected for each temperature.
Swab Elution Method:
Bacterial suspensions were prepared from fresh18-24 hour cultures of each
microorganism in a separate vial containing 10 mL of fecal matrix or 0.85% sterile saline
to obtain 1.5 x 108 CFU/mL suspensions. The suspensions were diluted in 0.85% saline
or fecal matrix solution to obtain working suspensions of 1.5 x 107 CFU/ml, and then 100
µL aliquots of dilutions were absorbed into the swabs and immediately placed into the
Puritan Fecal Opti-Swab Collection and Transport System medium. After incubation at
each time point, the swabs were removed from the transport tubes and 100 µL of 1-log
10
serial dilutions were made in 0.85% saline. 100 µL of each dilution was plated on the
appropriate agar plate for each temperature and time point. The plates were incubated in
appropriate culture conditions for 24-48 hours or until countable colonies were visible.
Manual colony counts were conducted for each time interval for each swab-organism
combination. The dilution yielding zero-time colony counts approximately between 25
and 250 CFU was reported.
Results from the Roll Plate and Swab Elution experiments as determined at various
storage times and temperature ranges are shown in Tables 2-9 below.
Acceptance criteria for recovery of microorganisms is defined as being within one log
10
increase or decrease from the starting titer at time zero. Manual colony counts were
conducted for each of the time intervals for each microorganism held at each temperature.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Shelf-life Stability: Shelf life stability test were performed successfully on three lots
of product demonstrating stability for up to 15 months at room temperature. Recovery
of microorganisms from fecal matrix was assessed by the Roll Plate method, as
described in M.1 above.
pH Stability: The pH of the test device was measured at predetermined time intervals
up to 20 months after manufacturing date. The test was performed using calibrated
pH meter with random samples from three different lots of Puritan Fecal Opti-Swab
Collection and Transport System. All samples tested were found to maintain pH
within the specified range of pH 6.90 to 7.50.
Cytotoxicity: Cytotoxicity test was conducted to evaluate glue, shaft and the rayon
tipped swabs for potential cytotoxicity effect following ISO Elution Method-1X
MEM Extract. No evidence of cytotoxicity was detected.
Sterilization: Puritan Fecal Opti-Swab Collection and Transport System are
sterilized by gamma irradiation and validated following ANSI/AAMI/ISO
11137:2006, Sterilization of health care products Radiation guidelines.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Not applicable.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:

N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
