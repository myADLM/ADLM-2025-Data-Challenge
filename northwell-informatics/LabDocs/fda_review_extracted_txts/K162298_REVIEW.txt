L. Test Principle:
The LOCI Vitamin D Total assay is a homogeneous competitive chemiluminescent
immunoassay based on LOCI technology. The assay measures total 25 (OH) vitamin D
concentration comprising of both 25(OH) vitamin D2 and 25(OH) vitamin D3 in both serum
and plasma. LOCI Vitamin D Total Assay reagents include the releasing reagent, biotinylated
monoclonal antibody, and two synthetic bead reagents. The patient sample is incubated with
the releasing reagent to release 25(OH) vitamin D molecules from vitamin D-binding proteins.
The reaction mixture is then incubated with biotinylated antibody to form a 25(OH) vitamin

D/biotinylated antibody complex. Chemibeads coated with a 25(OH) vitamin D3 analog and
chemiluminescent dye are added to remove the excess free biotinylated antibody. Streptavidin-
coated sensibeads containing a photosensitive dye are added to bind the biotinylated antibody.
Aggregates of the Chemibead analog/biotinylated antibody/streptavidin sensibeads are formed
as a result. Illumination of the reaction mixture by light at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen
from the sensibeads, which diffuses into the chemibeads and triggers a chemiluminescent
reaction. The resulting chemiluminescent signal is measured at 612 nm and is inversely
proportional to the concentration of total 25(OH) vitamin D in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A2. The samples
used consisted of three serum based commercial quality controls with mean vitamin
D concentration values of 18.9, 38.7, 89.6 ng/mL, respectively. A total of four patient
samples were used, including three serum samples with mean concentration values of
8.2, 29.4 ng/mL, and 76.54 and one K2 EDTA plasma sample with a mean
concentration value of 25.2 ng/mL. Testing was performed over twenty days, for two
runs per day for a total of 80 replicates for each sample. Single tests from two
independent cups were analyzed for each test material using one lot of the reagent.

analysis of the data was performed. The results of the linear regression analyses are
summarized below:
y = 1.0222x + 1.3862, r2 = 0.998
The linearity study data support the claimed measuring range of 5.0 to 150 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
LOCI VITD CAL Calibrator Traceability:
The assay is standardized through the Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP).
The VDSP is an international collaborative effort to standardize the laboratory
measurement of serum 25-OH vitamin D. This collaboration involves the coordinated
efforts of the National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes for
Standards and Technology (NIST), Ghent University, and other institutions. Please
refer to http://ods.od.nih.gov/Research/VitaminD.aspx for more information on the
VDSP program.
To achieve standardization against the VDSP recognized Reference Measurement
Procedure (RMP), the LOCI VITD CAL master calibration parameters were aligned
to the CDC VDSP by using 163 human serum samples from the CDC VSDP program
which were value assigned by the RMP, Ghent University ID-LC-MS/MS and
traceable to NIST SRM2972.
Value Assignment for calibrator:
Target values are assigned to each lot of calibrator from the master pool using the
Dimension EXL with Loci ®Module system. Subsequent LOCI VITD CAL
calibrators will be generated based on previous master pool values obtained by ID-
LC-MS/MS and adjusted if the mean recovery percent bias exceeds the
manufacturer’s acceptance criteria. The commercial lot of LOCI VITD CAL are
made from the master pool to have the following target values.
Level 1 = 0 ng/mL
Level 2 = 12 mg/mL
Level 3 = 30 ng/mL
Level 4 = 75 ng/mL
Level 5 = 165 ng/mL

--- Page 7 ---
Stability of Calibrator:
Protocols and acceptance criteria for the calibrator stability study were reviewed and
found to be acceptable to support the manufacturer’s following stability claims for the
LOCI VITD CAL.
Shelf life stability: 12 months stored at -150C to 250C.
Opened bottle stability: 30 days at 2-80C.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
studies were performed according to the CLSI EP-17-A2 guideline. LoB study was
performed with five blank samples composed of serum-based calibrator 1 at 0 ng/mL
and tested over three days using three reagent lots on one instrument for a total of 60
measurements per lot. The LoB was determined to be 0.8 ng/mL.
The LoD study was performed with five low samples prepared using 3 native serum
samples diluted with different lots of calibrator Level 1 and tested over three days
using 3 reagent lots on one instrument for a total of 60 measurements per lot. The
LoD was determined to be 1.3 ng/mL.
The LoQ study was performed with five low serum samples between 4-5 ng/mL of
vitamin D concentrations. The samples were tested for 3 days, one run per day, in 3
replicates per run, with three reagent flex lots on one instrument. These generated 27
data points.
LoQ was determined to be 5.0 ng/mL based on total precision (≤20%) using all
measurements observed on the low serum samples.
The LoB, LoD and LoQ are summarized below:
LoB LoD LoQ
0.8 ng/mL 1.3 ng/mL 5.0 ng/mL
The measuring range for the assay is 5.0-150 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2 to determine the
effect of various endogenous and exogenous substances on the LOCI Vitamin D Total
assay. For all interferents, the percent bias was determined by testing a control sample
without the interferent and comparing it to the value obtained from a test sample to
which the potential interferent had been added. Interferents were tested at three levels
of vitamin D concentrations: 13.9-16.9 ng/mL, 28.4-32.0 ng/mL, and 70.2-77.3
ng/mL. The spiked and control samples were assayed with 5 replicates each.

concentrations of HAMA (ranging from 8 ng/mL to 161,000 ng/mL), were spiked at a
1:10 ratio with control or neutralizing test solution made of several non-specific
binding (NSB) inhibitory agents. Samples were tested in 5 replicates, and the average
vitamin D values were obtained. The bias and % bias of each sample were calculated
using the equations:
Bias = Test – control
%Bias = 100 x (Test – control)/control
The study results support the claim that HAMA up to 106 ng/mL does not interfere
with LOCI Vitamin D Total Assay.
Cross Reactivity:
A cross reactivity study was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2 to determine the
effect of various cross reactive substances on the LOCI Vitamin D Total assay. Cross
reactivity was examined as a percentage ratio of observed analyte concentration
versus a cross-reactant concentration. Testing was performed using two serum
samples containing Vitamin D at medical decision levels of 25-30 ng/mL and 50-60
ng/mL respectively. Cross-reactant compounds were spiked into separate serum
samples at a defined test concentration. Control samples were prepared by adding the
same fixed volume of diluent to the base samples. Samples were processed and %
Cross-reactivity was determined as:
% Cross Reactivity = [(mean test result – mean control result)/concentration of cross-
reactant compound] x100.
The results of the study are summarized in table below:
