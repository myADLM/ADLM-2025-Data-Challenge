H. Intended Use:
1. Intended Use(s):
The Cepheid Xpert® Xpress Flu/RSV Assay, performed on the GeneXpert® Instrument
Systems, is an automated, multiplex real-time, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) assay intended for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation
of influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) viral RNA. The Xpert
Xpress Flu/RSV Assay uses nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens collected from
patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV
Assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus
infections in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus or RSV infection and should not be
used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2015-
2016 influenza season. When other novel influenza A viruses are emerging,
performance characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture
should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive
and culture specimens.
Ancillary Collection Kit Indications for Use:
The Xpert® Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve, and

I. Device Description:
1. Overview
The Xpert® Xpress Flu/RSV Assay, performed on the GeneXpert® Instrument (Dx and
Infinity) Systems, is a rapid, multiplex nucleic acid amplification test for the qualitative
detection and differentiation of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV viral RNA from NP
swab specimens.
To perform the Xpert® Xpress Flu/RSV Assay, NP swab specimens are collected from
patients and placed into viral transport medium using the Xpert® Xpress Nasopharyngeal
Sample Collection Kit for Viruses. With a transfer pipette, eluted NP swab specimens are
loaded into the sample chamber of a single-use, self-contained Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV
Assay cartridge. Each assay cartridge contains separate chambers for sample loading,
sample processing and target amplification by real-time RT-PCR, and contains all the
reagents necessary to carry out these processes. Because the cartridges are self-contained,
and specimens never contact working parts of the instrument modules, cross-
contamination between samples is minimized.
The assay cartridge containing the patient sample is inserted into the GeneXpert
Instrument System, which performs fully automated and integrated sample preparation
and real-time RT-PCR for the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay in approximately 30 minutes
or less. The GeneXpert Instrument Systems, comprised of the GeneXpert Dx and
GeneXpert Infinity Systems, have one to 80 randomly accessible modules that are each
capable of performing separate sample preparation and real-time PCR and RT-PCR tests.
Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids (i.e., the syringe drive
activates the plunger that works in concert with the rotary valve in the cartridge to move
3

--- Page 4 ---
fluids between chambers), an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, and a proprietary
I-CORE® thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and RT-PCR detection.
After completion of the test, the assay results are interpreted by the GeneXpert software
from measured fluorescent signals and embedded calculation algorithms, and are shown
in the “View Results” window in tabular and graphic formats.
2. Materials Provided
The Xpert® Xpress Flu/RSV Assay (Cat # XPRSFLU/RSV-10) contains sufficient
reagents to process 10 NP swab specimens or quality control samples. The assay kit
includes 10 individual cartridges with integrated reaction tubes that hold all of the
reagents necessary for sample lysis, RNA extraction, and nucleic acid amplification.
Additionally, each kit includes a set of 12 transfer pipettes for loading samples into the
assay cartridge and a CD containing the Assay Definition Files (ADFs) with instructions
for importing ADFs into the GeneXpert software.
3. Materials Required but Not Provided
Validated Specimen Collection and Transport Kit
· Cepheid Xpert® Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit for Viruses (Cat # SWAB/B-
100) containing one individually wrapped, sterile nasopharyngeal flocked nylon swab
and one Xpert Viral Transport Medium tube with three mL of Xpert Viral Transport
Medium.
GeneXpert® Instrument System
· GeneXpert Dx System (GX-I, GX-II, GX-IV, GX-XVI)
· Gene Xpert Infinity System (Infinity-48, Infinity-48s, Infinity-80)
External Controls
· Positive inactivated influenza A and B virus control from ZeptoMetrix
(Cat # NATFLUA/B-6C)
· Positive inactivated respiratory syncytial virus control from ZeptoMetrix
(Cat # NATRSV-6C)
· Negative inactivated coxsackievirus control from ZeptoMetrix
(Cat # NATCXVA9-6C)
4. Quality Control
The Xpert® Xpress Flu/RSV Assay includes two internal controls: a sample processing
control, and a probe check control.
4

--- Page 5 ---
Sample Processing Control
The sample processing control (SPC) is a non-infectious armored RNA pseudovirus that
ensures adequate processing of target viruses, monitors the presence of PCR inhibitors,
and verifies the use of proper PCR conditions. The SPC should be POSITIVE in a sample
that is negative for all three influenza A, influenza B and RSV target analytes, and can be
NEGATIVE or POSITIVE in a sample containing detectable levels of one or more of the
target analytes.
Probe Check Control
The probe check control (PCC) is present to control for sufficient reagent rehydration,
PCR tube filling, probe integrity and dye stability. All assay reagents must be present and
intact for the PCC to pass the validated acceptance criteria. If any of the PCC conditions
fail, the result is reported as an ERROR and the test must be repeated using a new assay
cartridge.
5. Results Interpretation
POSITIVE or NEGATIVE test results for influenza A (Flu A), influenza B (Flu B), and
RSV viral RNA are automatically generated by the GeneXpert software and presented as
text in the “View Results” window of the GeneXpert Instrument Systems following
completion of the test. The GeneXpert software is equipped with embedded algorithms to
determine the result of the test based on the calculated cycle threshold (Ct) values
obtained for each of the RNA target-specific optical curves generated by fluorescent
probes during the real-time PCR cycling process. Optical curves for each of the RNA
targets are also displayed in the “View Results” window but do not require manual data
interpretation or reviewing.
The Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay uses two separate channels for the detection of
influenza A viral RNA (Flu A 1 and Flu A 2). The primers and probes in the Flu A 1
channel have 100% homology to human influenza A strains. The primers and probes in
the Flu A 2 channel have > 95% homology to avian influenza A strains and
approximately 80% homology to human influenza A strains. Detection of influenza A
strains in either the Flu A 1 or Flu A 2 channel is reported as Flu A POSITIVE.
The GeneXpert Instrument Systems software also reports if the test is INVALID,
encounters an ERROR, or produces NO RESULT.
All possible test results for the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV assay are shown in Table 1.

If any of the test results mentioned below occur, the test should be repeated using leftover
specimen from the original transport medium tube and a new assay cartridge.
· INVALID: indicates that the control SPC failed. The sample was not properly
processed, PCR was inhibited, or the sample was not properly collected.
· ERROR: could be a result of PCC failure or that the maximum pressure limits were
exceeded. PCR does not initiate when there is a PCC failure.
· NO RESULT: indicates that insufficient data were collected. For example, the
operator stopped a test that was in progress or a power failure occurred.
· Co-infection with two or more viruses: the incidence of co-infection with influenza
A, influenza B and RSV is low. Specimens should undergo repeat testing if nucleic
acids from two or more analytes are detected in a single specimen.

The GeneXpert Instrument Systems automates sample preparation, amplification and real-
time detection of target-specific cDNA from clinical specimens. Each system utilizes a
syringe pump drive to dispense fluids to and from the different cartridge chambers and
ultrasonic lysis to release nucleic acids from both the target organisms and integrated SPC.
During the amplification process, the I-CORE® module contained within the GeneXpert
Instrument systems heats and cools the reaction tube contents, and detects emitted
fluorescence generated in the presence of target sequences. Embedded data analysis
algorithms within the GeneXpert Instrument software generate test results based on the
calculated cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained for each of the RNA target-specific optical
curves generated by fluorescent probes during the real-time PCR cycling process. The time to
results is 30 minutes or less.
M. Performance Characteristics
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility
A blinded, multi-center reproducibility study was conducted to assess the total variability
of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay across operators, study sites, testing days, GeneXpert
Instrument systems, runs, and reagent lots.
Two operators at three study sites tested a seven-member reproducibility panel in
duplicate twice per day on six different days (2 operators x 3 sites x 7 panel members x 2
replicates x 2 runs x 6 days) for a total of 1008 runs. Each site used a different GeneXpert
Instrument (Infinity-80, GeneXpert Dx, or Infinity-48) and three Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV
reagent lots for the analysis. The reproducibility specimen panel consisted of one
seasonal influenza A strain (Flu A/Victoria/361/2011), one influenza B strain (Flu
B/Massachusetts/2/2012), and one RSV (A/Long/MD/56) strain. Each virus strain was
prepared at two concentration levels: a “low positive” sample with an analyte
concentration approximately 1X the limit of detection (LoD) and a “moderate positive”
sample with an analyte concentration approximately 2X the LoD.
The reproducibility panel specimens were prepared using cultured influenza and RSV
viruses spiked into negative simulated nasal matrix. The simulated matrix consisted of
2.5% (w/v) porcine mucin, 1% (v/v) human whole blood in 0.85% sodium chloride
(NaCl) formulated in a 1X PBS solution with 15% glycerol, which was then diluted in
UTM to a final concentration of 16.7%. A negative sample containing simulated matrix
only was also included in the panel.
The expected results for each of the panel members are shown in Table 4 below. Overall
percent agreement between the expected results and the reproducibility study results is
presented in Table 5. Analysis of variance (CV) between sites, days, lots and operators
for each reproducibility panel member is presented in Table 6.

b. Assay Cut-Off
The Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay detects influenza A (Flu A), influenza B (Flu B) and
RSV analytes. For each analyte, a manual threshold and a valid minimum and maximum
cycle threshold (Ct) setting are defined. The manual threshold setting is the relative
fluorescence value that, when exceeded, results in a reported Ct value. The manual
threshold is chosen as low as possible to preserve assay sensitivity, but high enough to
insure that noise values in the baseline do not trigger a threshold crossing erroneously.
The manual threshold setting for the Flu A 1 target was set at 40 based on a mean
fluorescent background level of 232.4 in pre-clinical and analytical studies. The manual
threshold settings for the Flu A 2, Flu B, and RSV targets were 50 (mean = 140.7), 40
(mean = 256.9) and 45 (mean =288.0), respectively.
The valid Ct range for Flu A1, Flu A2, Flu B, and RSV targets is 10 to 40. These values
were determined using pre-clinical and analytical data and were subsequently validated in
the clinical study. The Ct cutoffs are included as automatic calculations in the assay
definition file (ADF) provided with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay.
c. External Controls
Three Zeptrometrix NATtrol Molecular Controls, comprised of inactivated viruses in a
purified protein matrix, were evaluated as external controls with the Xpert Xpress
Flu/RSV Assay.

Testing was performed with 20 replicates of three separate lots of the NATtrol Influenza
A/B Positive Control (cat # NATFLUA/B-6C), NatTrol RSV Positive Control (Cat #
NATRSV-6C), and NATtrol Influenza/RSV Negative Control (cat# NATCXVA9-C6C),
totaling 180 runs. All 180 runs provided valid and accurate test results.
For all analytical studies reported in this submission, one replicate of the three external
controls was run with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay on each day of testing.
d. Stability
Kit Stability
Real-time kit stability data for the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay is currently available for
six months at the extremes of the recommended storage temperature range of 2°C to
28°C. Results to date show that average Ct values from the stability testing meet the pre-
defined performance criteria. Testing is ongoing for up to 37 months on three reagent
lots.
Specimen Stability
A stability study was conducted to establish transport and storage claims for eluted NP
swab specimens to be analyzed with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay. Specimens
included one seasonal influenza A strain (A/Victoria/361/2011), one influenza B strain
(B/Massachusetts/2/2012), and one RSV strain (A/Long/MD/56) prepared in simulated
matrix to an analyte concentration of approximately 2X LoD.
Eight replicates of each of the positive specimens and a negative control (simulated
matrix only) were stored at 2°C, 8°C, 15°C, and 30°C, and tested at multiple time points.
Under the conditions of the study, all positive and negative specimens at all storage
conditions and temperatures tested were correctly identified using the Xpert Xpress
Flu/RSV Assay. The study data supports specimen stability claims under the
recommended specimen storage conditions (15-30°C for up to 24 hours and 2-8°C for up
to seven days).
Cartridge Hold Time
Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV samples that are prepared for testing may wait up to four and a
half hours on the GeneXpert Infinity Instruments before a module becomes available.
During this wait time, targeted viral RNA may degrade or become unstable such that an
originally low positive sample is rendered “NEGATIVE.” Assay performance out to five
and a half hours was evaluated under three storage conditions (ambient, 25°C/75%
relative humidity (RH), and 35°C) with a single lot of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay.
Testing was performed on eight replicates each of one influenza A
(A/Victoria/361/2011), one influenza B (B/Massachusetts/2/2012), and one RSV
(A/Long/MD/56) strain spiked into negative simulated matrix at an analyte concentration
between 1X and 3X the LoD, and negative specimens consisting of simulated matrix
15

only. All positive and negative replicates were correctly reported using the Xpert Xpress
Flu/RSV Assay, demonstrating acceptable performance following incubation for periods
exceeding the maximum cartridge hold time of four and half hours.
e. Limit of Detection
The LoD of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay was established using two influenza A
2009 H1N1-like strains, two influenza A H3N2 strains, two influenza B strains, two RSV
A strains, and two RSV B strains diluted into negative pooled NP clinical matrix. The
LoD is defined as the lowest concentration (tissue culture infectious does, TCID /mL)
50
per sample that can be reproducibly distinguished from negative samples with 95%
confidence or the lowest concentration at which 19 of 20 replicates were positive.
Each virus strain was initially tested in a range finding study at five different
concentrations in replicates of 20 per concentration of virus. Testing was performed with
two lots of reagents across three testing days. The higher LoD estimate observed per
strain and per lot as determined by probit regression analysis was selected for
verification. Verification of the estimated LoD claim was performed on one reagent lot
across a minimum of three testing days using 20 replicates per strain.
The LoD study results are presented in Tables 7 to 11.

f. Analytical Reactivity
An analytical reactivity study was conducted to evaluate the ability of the Xpert Xpress
Flu/RSV Assay to detect multiple influenza and RSV strains that are temporally and
geographically diverse. Testing was performed on 53 different strains (48 influenza and
5 RSV) in triplicate using cultured virus spiked into negative simulated matrix at
analyte concentrations approximately 3X the LoD. Influenza A strains included 14
A/H1N1 (pre-2009 seasonal and 2009 pandemic), 9 A/H3N2, and 12 avian strains
(H5N1, H5N2, H6N2, H7N2, H2N2, H7N9, and H9N2 subtypes). The 13 Influenza B
strains included both the Victoria and Yamagata lineage. RSV strains included RSV
types A and B.
The Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay exhibited a broad range of reactivity, as all influenza
A, influenza B and RSV strains tested positive in all three replicates, except for one
influenza A H1N1 strain (A/New Jersey/8/76) which tested positive in 2 of 3 replicates at
0.1 TCID50/mL. Results from the study are shown in Table 12.

Further in silico analysis was conducted to determine the predicted cross reactivity of
additional influenza A 2009 H1N1-like strains (n= 4 strains/target). The results showed
100% sequence homology for all primer target nucleotide sequences analyzed.
g. Analytical Specificity
An analytical specificity study was carried out to determine the potential for cross-
reactivity of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay with common respiratory pathogens or
those potentially encountered in the nasopharynx. The panel of microorganisms included
16 viral, 26 bacterial and 2 yeast strains. Three replicates of each viral strain were tested
at concentrations of ≥ 1x105 TCID /mL. Bacterial and yeast strains were also tested in
50
triplicate at concentrations of ≥ 1x106 CFU/mL with the exception of Chlamydia
pneumoniae, which was tested at 1x105 CFU/mL. Each microorganism was prepared in
negative simulated matrix to the concentrations indicated in Table 13 below.
Based on the results of this study, as summarized in Table 13, the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV
Assay showed no cross-reactivity with any of the 44 common respiratory microorganisms
tested.

* FluMist vaccine samples were unavailable for testing at the time this study was conducted. Samples containing
FluMist may cause false positive results.
Eight negative replicates were tested per potentially interfering substance to determine
the effects on the performance of the SPC. In addition, eight positive replicates were
tested per substance for each of six influenza and four RSV strains included in this study.
The panel of positive samples included two 2009 H1N1-like strains (A/California/7/2009
and A/Florida/27/2011), two influenza A H3N2 strains (A/Perth/16/2009 and
A/Victoria/361/2011), two influenza B strains (B/Wisconsin/01/2011 and
B/Massachusetts/02/2012), and four RSV strains (A/Long/MD/56, A/2/Australia/61,
B/Wash/18537/62, and B/9320/MA/77) spiked into negative simulated matrix to an
analyte concentration 3X the LoD.
No assay interference was observed in the presence of the substances at the
concentrations tested in this study. All positive and negative replicates tested with the
Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay were correctly identified as summarized in Table 15 below.

An analytical interference study was conducted to assess the inhibitory effects of a select
panel of commensal microorganisms common to the nasopharynx, on the performance of
the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay. Seven viral strains (listed in Table 16) at ≥ 1x105
TCID /mL were tested in the presence of one strain each of influenza A
50
(A/Perth/16/2009), influenza B (B/Massachusetts/2/2012), RSV A (A/Long/MD/56) and
RSV B (B/9320/MA/77) viruses spiked individually at 3X the LoD into negative
simulated matrix. Competitive interference of three commensal bacterial strains at ≥
1x106 CFU/mL was also evaluated with each of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay
analytes. Testing was performed with replicates of eight for each of the target strain and
each potentially interfering strain combination, and a negative simulated matrix control.
Under the conditions of the study, no inhibitory effects were observed for each of the
strains tested in the presence of another analyte.

Potential Competitive Analyte Interference
Internal competitive interference caused by co-infections of the targets in the Xpert
Xpress Flu/RSV Assay was evaluated by testing individual influenza and RSV strains
near the LoD in the presence of different influenza or RSV strains at higher
concentration. Analytical competitive interference was assessed using one seasonal
influenza A H3N2 strain (A/Victoria/361/2011), one influenza B strain
(B/Massachusetts/2/2012), one RSV A strain (A/2/Australia) and one RSV B strain
(B/Wash/18537/62).
Replicates of 20 were tested for each target strain and each competitive strain
combination. The normal binomial distribution with 20 replicate samples at the limit of
detection is between 17 and 20 positive results based on the binomial distribution with
N= 20, p= 0.95 (X~Bin(20, 0.95). Therefore sets of 20 with 16 or less positives would be
rare and an indication of a competitive inhibitory effect due to high levels of a competing
analyte.
The results for each analyte at the LoD in combination with another competitive anlayte
are shown in Tables 17 to 20. The average Ct values for each strain tested at the LoD
without a competitive analyte were taken directly from the Limit of Detection study.

Single-use, self-contained Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay cartridges were tested for their
susceptibility to carry-over contamination when alternating high positive and negative
samples are tested in the same GeneXpert module. In this study, negative simulated
matrix samples were processed in the same module of a GeneXpert Dx System
immediately following a high positive sample comprised of either an influenza A strain
(A/Victoria/361/2011) at 2x107 TCID /mL or an RSV A strain (A/Long/MD/26) at
50
1x104 TCID /mL spiked into negative simulated matrix. This process was repeated 20
50
times for a total of 41 runs resulting in 20 positive and 21 negatives for each virus type. A
different GeneXpert module was used for each virus type.
All of the 42 negative replicates were correctly reported as “Flu A NEGATIVE; Flu B
NEGATIVE; RSV NEGATIVE,” with Ct values of zero.
The 20 high influenza A positive replicates were correctly reported as “Flu A POSITIVE;
Flu B NEGATIVE; RSV NEGATIVE,” and the 20 high RSV positive replicates were
correctly reported as “Flu A NEGATIVE; Flu B NEGATIVE; RSV POSITIVE.” No
evidence of specimen or amplicon carry-over contamination was observed.
2. Comparison Studies
a. Method Comparison with Predicate Device
Performance of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay was evaluated against an FDA-cleared
nucleic acid comparator method in a prospective clinical study (see below).
b. Matrix Comparison
A matrix comparison study was conducted to determine whether the Xpert Xpress
Flu/RSV Assay performs equivalently with NP swab clinical matrix and simulated nasal
matrix. Leftover NP swab clinical matrix samples were supplied from commercial
sources and pooled to create an NP swab clinical background matrix. The simulated nasal
matrix was formulated with 2.5% (w/v) porcine mucin, 1% (v/v) human whole blood in
0.85% sodium chloride (NaCl) in 1X PBS solution with 15% glycerol, which was then
diluted in Copan UTM to a final concentration of 16.7%. Both matrices were confirmed
to be negative with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay before being used to prepare
positive samples. Positive samples included two influenza A strains, one influenza B
strain, and two RSV strains prepared in both NP clinical swab matrix and simulated
matrix at the four anlayte concentrations listed in Table 21.
The percent agreement between samples prepared in NP clinical matrix and simulated
matrix was 100% (Lower 95% CI = 94.42) using the Wilson-Score method. All 65
samples per strain and per matrix were correctly reported as positive.

c. Fresh versus Frozen Sample Comparison
The performance of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV assay with fresh and frozen specimens
was evaluated for equivalency by testing individual influenza and RSV strains at three
different concentrations representing low positives (2X LoD), moderate positives (5X
LoD), and high positives (10X LoD) in pooled negative NP clinical swab matrix. The NP
swab samples used in this study were prescreened with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay.
All the samples that resulted in a negative result (“Flu A NEGATIVE; Flu B
NEGATIVE; and RSV NEGATIVE”) were pooled for this study. Negative samples
consisted of NP swab matrix only.
The influenza and RSV viruses selected for this study were one seasonal influenza A
H3N2 strain (A/Victoria/361/2011), one influenza B strain (B/Massachusetts/2/2012),
one RSV A strain (RSVA/2/Australia/61), and one RSV B strain (RSV
B/Wash/18537/62). Replicates of at least 20 were tested for each specimen condition and
virus concentration. All positive and negative samples were tested under three conditions:
fresh, after one freeze-thaw cycle, and after two freeze-thaw cycles. For each freeze-thaw
cycle, the samples were placed at -80°C for 24 hours after which they were thawed on ice
for one hour prior to analysis with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay. There was no
statistically significant effect in the performance of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay
between fresh virus dilution and two sequential freeze thaw cycles for positive and
negative samples. All positive and negative replicates were correctly identified using the
Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay with the exception of one of 20 influenza A replicate tests
at 2X the LoD which was reported as “Flu A POSITIVE; Flu B NEGATIVE; RSV
POSITIVE” after two freeze thaw cycles by the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay.
3. Clinical studies
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity
Clinical performance characteristics of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay were evaluated
at 11 investigational sites in the U.S. during the 2015-2016 influenza season. To be
enrolled in the prospective study, patients had to be exhibiting signs and symptoms of
respiratory infection at the participating sites, and had to provide informed consent for the
collection of an NP swab specimen.
Site personnel collected one NP swab from each patient with the Cepheid Xpert
26

Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit. Prospectively collected NP swab specimens were
tested with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay according to the product insert instructions.
Remaining sample specimen was stored at 2-8°C for no more than 24 hours and shipped
to the reference laboratory for comparator testing with an FDA-cleared molecular assay.
Due to a low prevalence of influenza viruses and the difficulty in obtaining fresh
influenza and RSV-positive specimens, the specimen population for this study was
supplemented with consecutively collected, frozen specimens. To be eligible for the
clinical study, specimens had to be collected from individuals with signs and symptoms
of respiratory infection whose routine care called for collection of NP swab specimens
for influenza and/or RSV testing. Additionally, the leftover frozen sample volume had to
have a minimum volume of 1.4mL Copan UTM.
A total of 2580 NP swab specimens were enrolled in the clinical study, of which 2503
were eligible for inclusion. From the 2503 eligible specimens, 2065 (1142 prospective
fresh and 923 consecutive frozen specimens) swabs were tested by both the Xpert Xpress
Flu/RSV Assay and comparator assay and were included in the final dataset used for the
performance analysis. Patient age and gender distribution for each of the 2065 specimens
are presented in Tables 23 and 24, respectively.

Of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay runs performed with eligible specimens, 98.4%
(2038/2071) of these specimens were successful on the first attempt. The remaining 33
gave indeterminate results on the first attempt (20 ERROR, 10 INVALID, and 3 NO
RESULT). The initial indeterminate rate was 1.59% (33/2071) with the 95% CI 1.14-
2.23%. Thirty of the 33 indeterminate cases were retested, of which 27 yielded valid
results upon repeat testing; three specimens were not retested. The overall rate of
assay success was 99.7% (2065/2071). The overall indeterminate rate after retesting
was 0.3% (6/2071) with 95% CI 0.13- 0.63%.
For the fresh, prospectively collected NP swab specimens, the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV
Assay demonstrated a PPA and NPA of 94.6% and 99.3% for influenza A; 100% and

For the consecutively collected, frozen NP swab specimens, the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV
Assay demonstrated a PPA and NPA of 100% and 97.2% for influenza A; 100% and
98.2% for influenza B; and 97.9% and 97.7% for RSV, respectively.
For the combined dataset, the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay demonstrated a PPA and
NPA of 98.1% and 98.4% for influenza A; 100% and 98.7% for influenza B; and
98.5% and 98.8% for RSV, respectively.
The performance results of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay relative to the
comparative assay are summarized in Table 25. Data are stratified by analyte
(influenza A, influenza B and RSV) and by sample type (prospective, fresh and
consecutive, frozen). Data were shown to be poolable across specimen types, assay
lots, study sites, gender, and patient age group.

2. System Description:
The GeneXpert Instrument System family (GeneXpert Dx and Infinity Systems)
automates and integrates sample purification, nucleic acid amplification and detection of
target sequences within compatible, assay-specific, single-use cartridges. The instrument
systems each contain a computer and preloaded software for running tests and viewing
the results.
3. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types.
Yes ____X_____ or No __________
4. Level of Concern
Moderate
5. Software Description
The GeneXpert Instrument Systems are provided with a computer, preloaded with
software for running tests and viewing results. Each instrument (Dx and Infinity) contains
random access, closed-system, computer-based software and embedded firmware which
run dedicated microprocessor-controlled modules to integrate sample preparation,
amplification and real-time detection in a single system.
The GeneXpert Infinity modules contain extra robotic features for cartridge handling.
The Xpertise software utilized by the Infinity Systems is the user interface and provides
the ordering of tests as well as automates loading and unloading of cartridges into
GeneXpert modules within the system. The Xpertise user interface builds upon the
existing core software functionality for handling GeneXpert modules for cartridge
fluidics control, temperature control, optics control, and data analysis by the addition of
automation handling for the robotic arm.
6. Specimen Identification
Specimens are manually loaded into the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay cartridge by the
user. The user can then either scan or type the sample and patient ID into the system.
Prior to placing the cartridge into the GeneXpert Instrument System, the barcode on the
Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay cartridge is scanned. The information contained in the
assay barcode is utilized by the software to run the appropriate assay definition file
(ADF). If an assay is being run that does not already exist in the GeneXpert database, the
user must import the ADF before starting the test.

7. Calibration
Not required.
8. Quality Control
Sample Processing Control
The sample processing control (SPC) is a non-infectious armored RNA pseudovirus that
is included in each cartridge to verify that adequate processing of the sample has
occurred. The SPC verifies that nucleic acids have been released from the target viruses if
the organism is present and detects specimen-associated PCR and RT-PCR inhibitors.
The SPC should be POSITIVE in a sample that is negative for all three influenza A,
influenza B and RSV target analytes, and can be NEGATIVE or POSITIVE in a sample
containing detectable levels of one or more of the target analytes.
Probe Check Control
Before the start of the amplification process, the GeneXpert Instrument Systems
measures the fluorescence signal from the probes to monitor bead rehydration, reaction
tube filling, probe integrity, and dye stability. All assay reagents must be present and
intact for the PCC to pass the validated acceptance criteria. If any of the PCC conditions
fail, the result is reported as an ERROR and the test must be repeated using a new assay
cartridge.
