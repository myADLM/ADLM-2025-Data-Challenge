L. Test Principle:
Wondfo One Step Fecal Occult Blood Test is a qualitative test designed for the
immunochemical detection of human hemoglobin (hHb) in stool specimens. When the
extracted specimen (~33mg/mL) is introduced to the sample well of the testing cassette, the
specimen is absorbed into the device by capillary action, mixes with the hemoglobin specific
mouse monoclonal antibody-dye conjugate, and flows across the pre-coated membrane. The
bound complexes (antibody-dye conjugates/hHb) are then captured by antibodies immobilized

in the test region (T) of the device. When the hemoglobin antigen levels in specimens are at or
above the target cut-off, the immobilized antibody-dye conjugate/antigen complex produces a
colored test band and indicates a positive result. When the hemoglobin antigen levels in
specimens are below the target cut-off, there is no visible colored band in the test region (T) of
the device, indicating a negative result. To serve as a procedural control, a colored line will
appear at the control region (C), if the test has been performed properly.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability was evaluated using a single test kit lot and one operator; whereas
reproducibility was conducted across three point-of-care (POC) sites in the U.S. using
three test kit lots (one lot per site), three operators per site, performing one run per day
for five non-consecutive days.
For repeatability and reproducibility, Hb-free fecal samples were collected and spiked
with hemoglobin to achieve the following seven fecal hemoglobin concentrations: 0 μg
Hb/g stool, 1.2 μg Hb/g stool, 1.35 μg Hb/g stool, 1.5 μg Hb/g stool, 1.8 μg Hb/g stool,
2.25 μg Hb/g stool, and 60 μg Hb/g stool, that are equivalent to 0 ng/mL, 40 ng/mL, 45
ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 60 ng/mL, 75 ng/mL and 2000 ng/mL, respectively. Twenty-one
replicates were performed for each sample and concentration level. Repeatability and
reproducibility results at all test sites passed acceptance criteria.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Prozone (Hook Effect)
Susceptibility of the Wondfo One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Test to prozone
effects was evaluated using three test kit lots and three operators. Hemoglobin-free stool
specimens were collected and spiked with human blood of known hemoglobin
concentrations to obtain the following concentrations: 60000 μg Hb/g stool, 6000 μg
Hb/g stool, 600 μg Hb/g stool, 60 μg Hb/g stool, 30 μg Hb/g stool, 15 μg Hb/g stool and
7.5 μg Hb/g stool. These concentrations are equivalent to the following hemoglobin
concentrations when diluted with extraction buffer: 2 mg/mL, 200 μg/mL, 20 μg/mL, 2
μg/mL, 1 μg /mL, 500 ng/mL and 250 ng/mL respectively. Five aliquots of each sample
mixed with extraction buffer in the specimen collection tubes were prepared and tested
in a randomized order.
It was determined that the Wondfo One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Test is not
susceptible to prozone/hook effect up to a hemoglobin concentration of 200 μg/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Internal Control
Procedural controls are included in the test device. A rose/pink line in the control region
is the internal procedural control. It confirms sufficient specimen volume and correct
procedural technique.
External Controls
It is recommended that positive and negative controls be performed to verify proper test
performance. External controls are not provided with the test kit; however, the FOBT-
CHEK Control Kit (K041297) is recommended for use as the positive and negative
external controls.
Stability Studies
FOBT-CHECK Negative and Positive Controls were also tested daily to ensure and
confirm the validity of the test results of the stability studies.
1. Sample Stability
Samples for stability testing were prepared by spiking stool samples with human
blood (of known hemoglobin concentration) to obtain the following seven different
fecal hemoglobin concentrations: 0 μg Hb/g stool, 1.2 μg Hb/g stool, 1.35 μg Hb/g
stool, 1.5 μg Hb/g stool, 1.8 μg Hb/g stool, 2.25μg Hb/g stool, and 60 μg Hb/g stool.
These are equivalent to the following hemoglobin concentrations when the sample is
diluted with extraction buffer: 0 ng/mL, 40 ng/mL, 45 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 60 ng/mL,
75 ng/mL and 2000 ng/mL, respectively. Wondfo One Step Fecal Occult Blood
(FOB) Test sampling tubes must be brought back to room temperature before testing.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Statistical analysis of site-wise test results as well as combined results showed that
Wondfo One Step FOB Test results have acceptable overall percent agreement as well as
positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement with Orient Gene Biotech
One Step Rapid FOB test results.
A method comparison of Wondfo One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Test with the
predicate test, Orient Gene Biotech FOB One Step Rapid Test, was conducted by
assessing 407 patient samples, 18 of which were around the cut-off, and 100 spiked
samples using three different lots of the proposed device and one lot of the predicate
device. The method comparison study was performed at three POC testing sites by three
different operators at each site. The FOBT-CHEK external controls (positive and
negative) were run prior to testing. Statistical analysis of site-wide test results as well as
combined results showed that Wondfo One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) test results
have acceptable overall percent agreement as well as positive percent agreement and
negative percent agreement with Orient Gene Biotech One Step Rapid FOB Test. The
method comparison study (Table 3) demonstrated that the analytical performance of the
Wondfo One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Test is substantially equivalent to the
predicate device.

Lay User Study
To support over the counter use, a lay user study (Tables 4, 5) was performed at three
intended user sites with 100 lay users testing his/her own stool sample using the device
according to the package insert. The lay users also provided a sample for professional
testing. The overall agreement between the results obtained by lay-users and
professional users was 100%. The lay users also tested spiked samples. Human
Negative stool samples in collection buffer tubes (50mg feces in 1.5mL FOB buffer
solution) were spiked with hemoglobin at concentrations of 0, 37.5, 50, 62.5, and 2000
ng/ml. A total of twenty spiked samples were made at each concentration. Each lay
user tested only one spiked sample. All results are compared with that obtained by
professionals. Two discrepant results were found for two samples near the cutoff at
37.5ng/mL concentration. The overall agreement between the results obtained by lay-
users and professional users was 98%.

3. Specimen Identification:
Enter patient identification information manually on the label of the Sampling Collection
Tube.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
If testing is performed by a laboratory, it is recommended that the laboratory should give the
Wondfo One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Test sample collection tube to the patient for
fecal sample collection. The patient should submit the sample to the laboratory for testing as
per the appropriate instructions received from the laboratory. The sample must be returned
or mailed to the doctor/laboratory within 48 hours of sampling. Testing may also be
performed by the consumer if purchased over-the-counter. The sample can be stored at
room temperature for up to 15 days or can be refrigerated at 2–8°C (36–46°F) for up to 30
days. For long term storage, specimens should be kept at -20°C (-4°F).
5. Calibration:
Not applicable
6. Quality Control:
Internal Control: The Procedural Control is found in the procedural control region of the test
cassette to assure the operator that the test has been properly performed. This control does
not ensure that the capture antibody is accurately detecting the presence or absence of Hb in
the sample.
External control: External controls are used to assure the operator that the capture and
conjugated antibodies are present and reactive. Controls should be assayed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions once per kit lot, following the local and state guidelines. If
controls do not perform as expected, the test results should not be used.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Test Kit Reaction Time:
13

--- Page 14 ---
The Wondfo One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Test reaction time was demonstrated by
using seven stool concentrations at eight different time points. Reaction time test samples
were prepared by spiking Hb-free stool specimen with known levels of human Hb solution
to obtain fecal samples with seven different Hb concentrations: 0 μg Hb/g stool, 1.2 μg
Hb/g stool, 1.35 μg Hb/g stool, 1.5 μg Hb/g stool, 1.8 μg Hb/g stool, 2.25 μg Hb/g stool,
and 60 μg Hb/g stool, that are equivalent to 0, 40, 45, 50, 60, 75 and 2000 ng/mL,
respectively. Twenty one replicates of each sample were collected with Wondfo One Step
Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Test sample collection tubes. All specimens were tested with one
test kit lot in a randomized and blinded manner by one operator. The test results were read
and recorded at 3, 5, 8, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 60 minutes. Positivity rate of 0 ng/mL was 0%,
positivity rate of 40 ng/mL was 4.8%, positivity rate of 45 ng/mL was 47.6%, and the
positivity rate of 50 ng/mL was 100% at 10 minutes of reaction. The appropriate reaction
time of Wondfo One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Test was demonstrated as 10 minutes.
2. Operator Intensity Reading:
The operator intensity reading test was performed by utilizing test samples prepared by
spiking Hb-free stool specimen with known levels of human Hb solution to obtain fecal
samples with seven different Hb concentrations: 0 μg Hb/g stool, 1.2 μg Hb/g stool, 1.35 μg
Hb/g stool, 1.5 μg Hb/g stool, 1.8 μg Hb/g stool, 2.25 μg Hb/g stool, and 60 μg Hb/g stool,
that are equivalent to 0, 40 , 45, 50, 60, 75 and 2000 ng/mL, respectively. Twenty-five
replicates were prepared for each concentration. All specimens were tested with one test kit
lot in a randomized and blinded manner by five different readers at one intended use site.
The study participants recorded the results and graded the intensity of the test line from 10
levels: (B (no test line), C9 (faint test line), C8, C7, C6, C5, C4, C3, C2 and C1 (deepest test
line). The intensity of the test line increased in correlation with the Hb concentration of
stool test samples. There was no statistical significance in the analyses of the test samples
performed by the operators for the intensity reading test study.
3. Specimen Collection Verification:
Verification that the applicator device for the Wondfo One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB)
Test consistently delivers the specified amount of stool required for optimal test
performance was performed by five lay users using five positive and five negative clinical
samples per lay user. The study was performed at one intended use site. Five positive and 5
negative clinical samples results were confirmed using the predicate device and the
proposed device. A professional operator used an electronic balance and weighed the
sampling stick first so that this weight could be offset. The lay users then inserted the
sampling stick into test stool sample at six different sites to collect samples and placed the
sampling stick back in to the sample collection tube (without buffer). After, the professional
operator used the electronic balance to weigh the sample stick with stool sample.
The lay users next used three sample collection tubes (with buffer) to collect the sample
again and used three test cassettes of Wondfo One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Test to
test the result according to the test procedure directions of the package insert. The average
value for sample volume collected was 0.0517g and the standard deviation was 0.0027,
14

--- Page 15 ---
which demonstrated the consistency of the sampling. The total positive and negative results
obtained by the lay users are consistent with the expected results for the test samples. The
lay users collected adequate consistent amounts of stool samples when following the
package insert directions to perform the Wondfo One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Test.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
