L. Test Principle:
The FREND™ PSA Plus is a fluorescence immunoassay. The FREND™ Test Cartridge
utilizes microfluidic technology and detects sandwich immune-complexes bound to PSA.
Each FREND™ PSA Plus Test Cartridge contains a test zone and as well as a reference zone.
The specimen is added by the operator to the sample inlet with a transfer pipet, allowing the
appropriate volume of sample to be delivered into the FREND™ PSA Plus Test Cartridge.
The Cartridge containing the sample is placed into the FREND™ System, which is
programmed to begin analysis once the sample has reacted with the reagents. The PSA
quantification is based on the amount of fluorescence detected by the FREND™ System at
the FREND™ PSA Plus Test Cartridge window. The magnitude of the fluorescent signal is
directly proportional to the amount of total PSA in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance: The test results met the sponsor’s pre-determined acceptance
criteria for all analytical performance studies.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision and lot-to-lot reproducibility of the assay was evaluated per CLSI
EP05-A3 by testing four serum sample pools containing various concentrations of
PSA. Each sample was run in duplicate, in two runs per day, for 20 days with three
lots of cartridge on one FREND Plus system by one operator (n=240 per sample).
The results are summarized in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity:
Linearity was evaluated according to the CLSI guideline EP6-A by preparing two
dilution series. The first dilution series was made by diluting a serum sample
containing a PSA concentration above the upper limit of measuring range with a
serum sample containing a low concentration of PSA. Each dilution was tested in
replicates of five using three lots of cartridges. The second dilution series was made
by diluting a serum sample with a PSA concentration at 1.0 ng/mL with a serum
sample with a PSA concentration below the lower limit of measuring range. Each
dilution was tested in replicates of four using three lots of cartridge to determine the
observed value of PSA. Percent recovery and linear regression analysis was
determined by comparing the observed PSA result with the expected value. The
results are summarized as follows:
Dilution Range Slope Y-intercept R2 %
(ng/mL) (95% CI) (95% CI) Recovery
1.00 0.04
0.10–25.53 0.99 96.0–102.0
(0.98–1.02) (−0.26–0.35)
0.99 -0.00
0.05–1.00 0.98 97.2–100.0
(0.96–1.03) (−0.02–0.02)
The results support that the assay is linear for the claimed measuring range, 0.08–25
ng/mL.
Hook effect:
The presence of high dose hook effect was tested using a sample with PSA
concentration of 1200 ng/mL. No high dose hook effect was observed in the sample
with a PSA concentration as high as 1200 ng/mL.

The FREND™ PSA Plus assay is traceable to the WHO International Standard
Prostate Specific Antigen (90:10) NIBSC code: 96/670.
Value assignment: The internal standard is manufactured by gravimetric methods
based on the PSA Ag ACT complex (Scripps P0624-90010) or WHO standard
material (NIBSC 96/670). The concentrations of calibrators are confirmed based on
the measurement on ARCHITECT i total PSA assay (P910007) or TOSOH AIA ST
PA Test (P910065). The calibration information is then coded in the individual
cartridge.
Stability:
The stability of the cartridges for FRENDTM PSA Plus was established previously per
K124056. The cartridges are stable for one year from the date of manufacture if
stored refrigerated as directed.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying five PSA free serum samples.
Each sample was tested in replicates of two per day for six days with three lots of
cartridges to generate 60 data points. The LoB was calculated based on the 95th
percentile of 60 measurements and determined to be 0.02 ng/mL.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by assaying five samples with PSA
concentrations close to the lower limit of measuring range. Each sample was tested
in replicates of two per day for six days with three lots of cartridges to generate 60
data points. The LoD value was calculated as the LoB + 1.645 x SD of the replicates
for the low level samples and was determined to be 0.03 ng/mL.
The Limit of Quantification (LoQ) was evaluated using the precision profile approach
and the data from the precision study following CLSI EP05-A3. Within-laboratory
precision was determined using four samples with PSA concentration at 0.025, 0.05,
0.075 and 0.1 ng/mL. The LoQ was calculated as the sample concentration at which
the pre-determined goal of within-lab imprecision was met. The LoQ was determined
to be 0.08 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interference: Two serum base samples (1 ng/mL and 4 ng/mL) were
spiked separately with endogenous interferents. The control samples were prepared
for each interfering substance by spiking with the same volume of diluents. Each
sample was tested in three replicates and the percent recovery was calculated by
comparing to a corresponding control sample. No interference was detected in the
samples using interferents up to the concentrations listed in the table below.

Among 63 subjects, the majority of subjects (n = 49) were Caucasian, the remaining
subjects included nine African American, one Asian, and four Hispanics. 62 out of
63 subjects had staging information of initial diagnosis based on the
recommendations by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system:
three were stage I; 25 were stage II; 22 were stage III; and 12 were stage IV. Of 63
subjects, 40 subjects were treated,including prostatectomy, radical perirectal
prostatectomy, bilateral scrotal orchiectomy, lymphadenectomy, bilateral pelvic
lymphadenectomy, prostate curettage, crainal resection mets, cryoblation, seminal
vesiculectomy, and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). A total of 257
values consisting of 63 baseline values and 194 monitoring observations were
obtained with the mean number of sample draws of 4.08 per subject.
Results:
In this study, all 257 serum samples (including 63 baseline and 194 follow-up
measurements) from 63 subjects were measured using both the modified FREND
PSA Plus on the FREND system and the predicate FREND PSA Plus which was
previously cleared under K124056. At each follow-up visit, the percentage change of
the PSA was calculated by comparing the test result to the results obtained from the
previous visit. The performance of the FREND PSA Plus as an aid in the
management of patients with prostate cancersubjects was evaluated by assessing the
changes in PSA levels correlated to the clinical assessment at the time of assay.
For both modified and predicate FREND™ PSA Plus assays, a positive change in the
PSA concentration was defined as measurable increase in the value that is 20%
greater than the previous value of the test for samples with the PSA concentration > 1
ng/mL, and increase >0.2 ng/mL for sample with the PSA concentration ≤ 1 ng/mL.
For each pair ofsamples in a serial set, the change in the PSA concentration was
compared to the change in the clinical status of the patients as determined by the
physician based on other laboratory tests, patient interviews, physical examinations,
and medical imaging. The following definition was used to categorize the patient’s
9

--- Page 10 ---
disease status:
1. No Evidence of Disease (NED) – All detectable tumors had disappeared.
2. Stable – The tumors stayed the same size. To account for measurement errors
on scans and to discount “insignificant" changes, stable disease includes either
a small amount of growth (typically less than 20%–25%) or a small amount of
shrinkage (typically less than 25%).
3. Responding – Significant (≥50%) amount of decrease in the total tumor
volume responding to the treatment, with evidence of some residual disease
still remaining.
4. Progression – Clinical evidence of growth in the primary tumor or new tumors
have appeared (*see reference below).

b. Other clinical supportive data:
The clinical performance of the modified FREND PSA Plus was evaluated against
that of the predicate, FREND PSA Plus (K124056). The table below compared the
clinical sensitivity and specificities between these two assays using the same sample
cohort in the clinical study described above.

Negative Likelihood Ratio 0.46 (0.33–0.61) 0.42 (0.30–0.57)
4. Clinical cut-off:
An absolute cutoff is not applicable for monitoring. The significance of PSA increase
was defined as a change greater than 0.2 ng/mL for samples with PSA concentration ≤ 1
ng/mL and the percentage increase >20% for samples with PSA concentration >1 ng/mL.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The reference range for the modified FRENDTM PSA Plus was determined by testing
serum samples from a total of 121 apparently healthy males aged 50 to 88 years (average
age of 63, median age of 63). The results are summarized in the table below:
N 121
Mean 1.27 ng/mL
Median 1.01 ng/mL
95th percentile 2.92 ng/mL
97th percentile 3.19 ng/mL
99th percentile 4.59 ng/mL
