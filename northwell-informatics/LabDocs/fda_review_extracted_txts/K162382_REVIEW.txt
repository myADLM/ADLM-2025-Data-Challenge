b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using venous blood drawn from healthy donors. The blood
was allowed to stand at room temperature to glycolyze. The venous blood was spiked
with concentrated D-Dextrose solution (~20,000 mg/dL) to achieve ten
concentrations covering the range of glucose concentrations below and above 20-600
mg/dL (8, 43, 75, 116, 183, 291, 383, 469, 599, 758 mg/dL). Three lots of test strips
and five blood glucose meters were used. Each level was tested in replicates of five
with each of three test strip lots, resulting in a total of 15 replicates for each glucose
level. The values from the Smart Dong bnmnnnle were compared to a laboratory-
based comparator method (YSI 2300). The results from regression analysis are
summarized below:
Lot 1: y = 1.0008x+1.3651, R2 = 0.9981
Lot 1: y = 1.0018x+0.7997, R2 = 0.998
Lot 1: y = 1.0037x+1.2707, R2 = 0.9978
The sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range is 20 to 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Test strip closed vial stability:
Stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable
to support a shelf life of 25 months when stored at a temperature ranging from 36°F-
86°F (2°C to 30°C) and between 10%-85% relative humidity.
Test strip open vial stability:
Stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable
to support an open-vial use life of three months at a temperature ranging from 36°F-
86°F (2°C to 30°C) and between 10%-85% relative humidity.
Control Solution Stability:
Protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed in k093724. The sponsor claims that
the control solution is stable when unopened for two years (24 months) at the
recommended storage temperature (36-86°F). The control solution is stable when
opened for three months (90 days) at the recommended storage temperature (36-
86°F).
Traceability:
The Smart Dongle Blood Glucose Monitoring System is compared to the YSI 2300
Glucose Analyzer in the clinical and non-clinical studies. The YSI is calibrated with
NIST (SRM) 917A reference material.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range for the Taidoc Smart Dongle is 20-600 mg/dL. This range was
verified by the linearity study (M.1.b). The meter displays “LO” with glucose values
6

--- Page 7 ---
below 20mg/dL, and “HI” with glucose values over 600 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Eighty-eight potential interfering substances consisting of exogenous substances
(substances originating from outside the body such as therapeutic agents or vitamins)
of the most commonly used critical care drugs endogenous substances (substances
produced or originating from within the body), and common anticoagulants including
heparin and Fluoride/Oxalate were screened for interference. Four Smart Dongle
meters and four test strip lots were tested. Interference was screened by spiking each
substance into a venous whole blood sample using highly concentrated dextrose
(~20,000 mg/dL) to a concentration of either approximately 75 mg/dL or170 mg/dL.
The sponsor defined no significant interference as bias within ±10%.

Based on the results of their testing the sponsor listed the following limitations in the
Owner’s Manual and the Test Strip Insert:
· If you are taking acetaminophen containing drugs (Tylenol and other
medicines containing acetaminophen, blood concentrations >6.25 mg/dL) at
doses higher than recommended, these may interfere with your glucose meter
and cause you to get inaccurate results with this system.
· You should know that your blood glucose results may not be reliable after a
Xylose absorption test. If you have had a Xylose absorption test, or if you are
unsure, ask your doctor how long you should wait until using your blood
glucose meter
· If you are undergoing treatment with PAM (pralidoxime iodide, blood
concentration >5 mg/dL, used in the treatment of some types of poisoning),
this may cause you to get inaccurate results with this system. If you are
unsure, then ask your doctor.
· If you have certain conditions that may cause your blood level of uric acid to
rise (>10 mg/dL in your blood), such as gout or kidney disease, then your
blood glucose results may be inaccurate with this meter.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A system accuracy study was carried out with 160 subjects at three sites to evaluate
system accuracy devices in clinical and laboratory settings. Health care professionals
tested subject's blood specimens via a fingertip stick using the blood glucose monitoring
devices and the laboratory-based comparator method. Each blood specimen was tested
with three different lots of test strips for a total of three readings per sample and tested on
the analyzer. The health care professional obtained a capillary blood sample that was
tested immediately using six different devices, and approximately 200μl of additional
capillary blood was tested in duplicate using the laboratory analyzer at each trial site. The
samples ranged in glucose concentration from 40.0 to 546 mg/dL (as measured with the
laboratory-based comparator method, the YSI 2300 analyzer) for the capillary. Five
samples were allowed to glycolyze in order to reach low concentrations. One sample was
spiked in order to reach high concentration. Results are summarized below:
Fingertip capillary blood:

Lay User Study
A lay user evaluation study was performed with 160 lay-users to determine whether
glucose readings from the fingertip obtained by a lay-user provided with only the device
labeling as testing instructions were comparable to results from venous whole blood
measured using a laboratory-based comparator method. The labeling provided to the
users was in English only. Each participant performed their own fingerstick testing using
the device after reading the instructions in the proposed labeling, including the user
manual and test strip manual. The samples ranged in glucose concentration from 55.9 to
449 mg/dL (as measured with the laboratory-based comparator method, the YSI 2300
analyzer). Results are summarized below:
Fingertip capillary blood:

acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is
cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the
Taidoc Smart Dongle Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using whole
blood samples manipulated to contain hematocrit levels of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%,
60%, and 70% and spiked with glucose (as concentrated dextrose solution; 20,000
mg/dL) to achieve concentrations that covered the claimed measurement range of 20-600
mg/dL. Each sample was then tested 6 times and the individual values were compared
with those obtained from a laboratory-based comparator method, YSI 2300 analyzer.
The device demonstrated adequate performance across the claimed measurement range
when the hematocrit concentrations are 10% and 70%.
2. Altitude study: Claim: Altitude to 10,742 feet (3,275m) does not affect test results.
Patient samples at 7 different glucose concentrations spanning the claimed measurement
range were tested at simulated altitudes of 0, 5000, 11500, and 15000 feet elevation.
Results were compared to results obtained using a laboratory-based comparator method,
YSI 2300 analyzer and demonstrated that altitudes up to15,000 feet above sea level have
no significant effect on blood glucose measurements from the Smart Dongle Blood
Glucose Monitoring System.
3. Temperature and humidity studies: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity
studies using blood samples with three target concentrations of glucose (~65 mg/dL,
~125 mg/dL and ~320 mg/dL) to evaluate temperatures ranging from 50ºF to 104ºF
(10°C to 40°C) and relative humidity from 10% to 85%. Four meters and three lots of
blood glucose test strips were evaluated and compared to results using the laboratory-
based comparator method, YSI 2300 analyzer. Four temperature and humidity
combinations, including low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity,
high temperature/low humidity and high temperature/high humidity were tested using
three lots of test strips. No significant effect (relative to the reference method) was
observed with any of the temperature and humidity combinations tested. The results
support the claims in the labeling that the system can be used in temperatures of 50ºF to
104ºF with relative humidity of 10 to 85% (10°C to 40°C).
4. Sample Volume Studies: The sponsor performed sample volume studies using venous
blood altered to three target glucose concentrations (30-50, 96-144, and 280-420 mg/dL).
At each target concentration, samples of different volumes (0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3
µl) were measured with the device and compared to results from a laboratory-based
comparator method, YSI 2300 analyzer. Three lots of test strips and 5 meters were
evaluated. The results support the claimed minimal sample volume of 1.0 µl.
5. Infection Control Studies: The Smart Dongle Glucose Monitoring System is intended
for single-patient use. Microkill Plus (EPA Reg.No.59894-10-37549) were validated by
an outside testing laboratory to demonstrate complete inactivation of live virus. The
13

--- Page 14 ---
sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in performance of the Smart Dongle
glucose meter after 10950 cleaning and disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one
cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting wipe) to simulate ten cycles of cleaning and
disinfection per day over three years. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for
the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
6. Software: Software documentation was reviewed and demonstrated that the device was
developed under appropriate software lifecycle processes.
7. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing: The sponsor provided appropriate
documentation certifying that electromagnetic (EMC) testing was performed and the
device systems were found to be compliant.
8. Customer service is available at 1-888-307-8188 (7:00 am - 6:00 pm PST, Mon. - Fri.).
The sponsor indicates that users who need assistance outside of these hours should
contact their healthcare professional.
9. Readability: The readability of the Smart Dongle BGMS, and Smart Dongle Blood
Glucose Test Strip user manuals were evaluated. The Smart Dongle BGMS user manual
and Smart Dongle Test strip manual scored 8.0 and 7.9 respectively on the Flesch-
Kincaid scale.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
