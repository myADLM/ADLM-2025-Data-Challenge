H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
RAPIDEC CARBA NP is a phenotypic (colorimetric) in vitro diagnostic test for the
qualitative detection of carbapenemase enzymes in Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa colonies that have elevated MIC values to any carbapenem. RAPIDEC
CARBA NP is performed on pure colonies grown on non-selective sheep blood agar
culture media.
RAPIDEC CARBA NP is intended as an aid in the prevention and control of infection
caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
RAPIDEC CARBA NP is not intended to guide or monitor the treatment for these
bacterial infections. A negative result does not preclude the presence of carbapenemase
enzymes. The ability of RAPIDEC CARBA NP to detect carbapenemase enzymes
encoded by genetic markers other than KPC, NDM, OXA-48, VIM and IMP has not been
established. RAPIDEC CARBA NP testing should be used in conjunction with other
laboratory tests including antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as the Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
Limitations of the RAPIDEC CARBA NP assay:
1) The performance of the RAPIDEC CARBA NP assay for detection of
carbapenemase enzymes encoded by genetic markers other than KPC, NDM,
OXA-48, VIM and/or IMP has not been established. In addition, RAPIDEC
CARBA NP results may be influenced by the local epidemiology regarding
genetic markers of resistance, i.e., depending on the local distribution/prevalence
of different carbapenemase genetic markers, and more false negative results may
occur. Conduct alternative testing if negative results are obtained and
carbapenemase enzyme production is suspected based on local epidemiology.
2) RAPIDEC CARBA NP testing should be used as an adjunct to other laboratory
test(s) such as antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
3) The performance of the RAPIDEC CARBA NP test with bacteria other than
Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa has not been evaluated.
Organism identification and elevated carbapenem MICs should be determined
prior to testing on the RAPIDEC CARBA NP.
4) Proteus species, Providencia species, Morganella species may have elevated
2

--- Page 3 ---
imipenem MICs due to intrinsic resistance mechanisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa
has been shown to exhibit resistance to ertapenem due to intrinsic resistance
mechanisms.
5) The detection of OXA variants other than OXA-48 has not been evaluated
sufficiently in the study.
6) Hyper-mucoid colonies may lead to false positive or false negative results and
should not be tested by the RAPIDEC CARBA NP test. A hyper-mucoid colony
tends to stretch itself to form a continuous viscous filament > 5 mm in length
when picked up from an agar plate using a bacteriology loop/needle.1
7) Agar media containing pH indicator for colony color differentiation (e.g.,
Bromocresol Purple, MacConkey, Cysteine Lactose Electrolyte-Deficient, etc.)
are not compatible with the RAPIDEC CARBA NP and require subculturing
growth/biomass on a sheep blood agar for testing.
8) The performance of RAPIDEC CARBA NP has been evaluated for subculturing
growth on 5% sheep blood agar incubated for 18- 24 hours (Routine procedure)
and 4-5 hours (Short Incubation procedure) only. The performance with other
culture media has not been evaluated and is therefore unknown.
9) The performance of the RAPIDEC CARBA NP test when testing
Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa containing OXA-181, OXA-
232, SME, GIM, SPM, and IMI carbapenemase enzymes has not been established
due to the low number of positive isolates available using the Composite
Reference Method.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable; results are read manually
I. Device Description:
The RAPIDEC CARBA NP strip (Figure 1) is composed of 5 wells prepared with
premeasured portions of the necessary substrates for the reactions. In addition, the RAPIDEC
CARBA NP kit contains the necessary accessories for performing the test.

In order to rehydrate the dry reagents and initiate the reactions, wells (a), (b) and (c) are
filled with 100 µL of API Suspension Medium (purified water). The strip is left at room
temperature for 4-10 minutes to allow the dry reagents to reconstitute in the wells. The
bacterial inoculum suspension is prepared in well (c) until the turbidity equals well (b). Well
(c) contains the lysis buffer. The lysis of the inoculum suspension enables the extraction of
the enzyme; the strip is left at room temperature for additionally 30 minutes.
Transfer 25 µL of the lysed inoculum suspension is to wells (d) and (e) and 25 µL from well
(a) [phenol red solution] is also transferred to wells (d) and (e). The strip is incubated for 30-
40 minutes at 33-38°C to allow the hydrolysis to occur and change in color of the phenol red
solution in the presence of a carbapenemase enzyme. The hydrolysis acidifies the medium
which results in the change in color of the pH indicator. The function of each well of the
RAPIDEC CARBA NP strip is shown in Table 1:

Well Reagent
(a) Phenol red solution
(b) Turbidity Control
(c) Lysis buffer
(d) Control well without imipenem
(e) Reaction well containing imipenem
Place the strip on the two-colored (black and white) support. Position wells (d) and (e) on the
white background to facilitate reading. Reading is performed by comparing the colors in
wells (d) and (e), ensuring that the strip is firmly pressed against the support. A test is
positive when a significant variation in color is observed between the two wells. For
example, the control well is red and the test well has changed to yellow/orange. Result
interpretation is shown in Table 2.

L. Test Principle:
The RAPIDEC CARBA NP test is based on the detection of carbapenem hydrolysis by
carbapenemase-producing bacteria. Hydrolysis acidifies the medium which results in the
change in color of the pH indicator. The bacteria are first lysed to release the carbapenemase
enzyme. The lysate is added to a detection solution containing:
• A carbapenem- imipenem (carbapenemase substrate)
• Phenol red (pH indicator)
• Zinc- required for the detection of metallo-dependent carbapenemase-producing
strains.
After incubating for a maximum of 2 hours, reading is performed visually by comparing the

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility panel of 10 strains (six carbapenemase producers and four non-
carbapenemase producers) was tested in triplicates for five days at three sites interpreted
by two operators with results blinded to each other. The carbapenemase producers
included VIM producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), NDM (1), IMP (1), OXA-48 (1),
and KPC (2) producing Enterobacteriaceae. Reproducibility isolates information is
shown in Table 4.

Two separate lots of RAPIDEC CARBA NP were used in the study to include 327 and
573 results from Lot #1 and Lot #2 respectively:
10 strains x triplicates x 5 days x 3 sites x 2 operators = 900
Two subculture/incubation procedures were assessed in the reproducibility studies:
• In the Routine Subculture/Incubation procedure, the RAPIDEC CARBA NP test
was performed on colonial growth on sheep blood agar medium that has been
incubated for 18-24 hours.
• In the Short Subculture/Incubation procedure, organisms were sub-cultured onto
MacConkey agar and incubated for 18- 24 hours. The organisms from the
MacConkey then were subcultured again onto blood agar and incubated for 4-5
hours to obtain sufficient growth/biomass to perform the RAPIDEC CARBA NP.
Reproducibility for Routine and Short Subculture/Incubation is shown in Tables 5 and 6
respectively with acceptable results >95%.

Analytical Reactivity
A total of 43 carbapenemase producers as determined by the reference composite method
were tested by the RAPIDEC CARBA NP. There were two VIM producing
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 41 carbapenemase producing Enterobactericeae consisting
of those encoded by genetic markers as follows: KPC (16), NDM (10), OXA-48 (7), VIM
(5) and IMP (3).
The analytical sensitivity is based on an initial reading performed at 30 minutes. If
negative, a final reading was performed at a total of 2 hours of 33-38°C incubation.
Considering any positive result, the analytical sensitivity was 100%; however, four
negative results at the initial 30-minute read became positive at the final 2–hour read
while eight initial positive results at 30 minutes read became negatives when read again
at 2 hours incubation. This information is provided as a footnote in the labeling:
“There were four negative results at the initial 30-minute read but became
positive at the final 2–hour read; there were eight initial positive results that
changed back to negatives when read again at 2 hours incubation.”
In addition, a Caution statement is included in the Reading and Interpretation section of
the labeling:
“Positive tests results are frequently obtained at 30 minutes of incubation. Re-
incubate if negative or doubtful. After 30 minutes, there is a risk that a positive
result may change back to a negative. Therefore, it is imperative to perform the
initial reading at 30 minutes of incubation.”
Analytical Agar Culture Media Compatibility Studies
The RAPIDEC CARBA NP result tested with strains on Columbia agar + 5% sheep
blood (COS) were compared with strains on Trypticase Soy agar + 5% sheep blood
(TSS). A total of 106 strains (92 carbapenemase enzyme producers and 14 non-
carbapenemase enzyme producers) were tested in the compatibility study. The
carbapenemase producers included those encoded by genetic markers as follows: IMP

(19), KPC (20), VIM (20), NDM (17), and OXA-48 (16).
The positive rate for the carbapenemase producers was 94.6% (87/92) and 92.4% (85/92)
for TSS and COS respectively at the initial 30-minute read. There were five (i.e., four
OXA-48 producing K. pneumoniae and one KPC producing K. pneumoniae) that were
negative for both media and two NDM producing Providencia spp. (i.e., P. rettgeri and
P. stuartii) for COS at the 30-minute read. At the final 2-hour read, the positive rate was
the same for both COS and TSS at 98.9% (91/92) due to one negative (i.e., KPC
producing K. pneumoniae) result.
The negative rate for non-carbapenemase producers was 100% for both media at the 30-
minute and 2-hour reads.
The results indicate no significant differences between TSS and COS at 30-minute and 2-
hour reads.
A limitation is included in the limitation section of the labeling:
“The performance of RAPIDEC CARBA NP has been evaluated for subculturing
growth on 5% sheep blood agar incubated for 18- 24 hours (Routine procedure)
and 4-5 hours (Short Incubation procedure) only. The performance with other
culture media has not been evaluated and is therefore unknown.”
e. Analytical specificity:
A total of 93 non-carbapenemase producing strains with elevated carbapenem MICs were
tested by RAPIDEC CARBA NP. The resistance mechanisms included Gram negative
organisms harboring AmpC, high level AmpC, porin loss, ESBL, porin loss/ESBL, porin
loss/AmpC, in addition to resistant Gram positive organisms (MRSA, and VRE)
The set included 67 strains related to the intended use: Enterobacteriaceae (59), P.
aeruginosa (8), and 26 other organisms comprised of non-fermenting gram negative rods,
gram positive organisms and yeast. All strains were well-characterized. An initial reading
was performed at 30 minutes and if the result was negative a final reading was performed
at a total of 2 hours of 33-38°C incubation.
The analytical specificity was 97.9% (91/93) at 30 minutes of incubation due to two
intrinsically carbapenem-resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The analytical
specificity was 93.6% (87/93) at 2 hours incubation caused by six positive at 2 hours
incubation. The false positive results were caused by five non-fermenting gram negative
rods (three intrinsic resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, one each for Burkholderia
cepaciae and Sphingomonas paucimobilis) and one Morganella morganii with an AmpC
resistance.
For evaluation of intended Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, the analytical
specificity is 100% (67/67) at 30 minutes and 98.5% (66/67) at 2 hours of incubation.
11

--- Page 12 ---
The false positive was caused by one AmpC producing Morganella morganii.
Two limitations are included in the limitation section of the labeling:
• The performance of the RAPIDEC CARBA NP test with bacteria other than
Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa has not been evaluated.
Organism identification and elevated carbapenem MICs should be determined
prior to testing on the RAPIDEC CARBA NP.
• Proteus species, Providencia species, Morganella species may have elevated
imipenem MICs due to intrinsic resistance mechanisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa
has been shown to exhibit resistance to ertapenem due to intrinsic resistance
mechanisms.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
In the multi-center study, each isolate was tested by the RAPIDEC CARBA NP and the
composite reference method which includes carbapenem (Imipenem, Meropenem,
Ertapenem, and/or Doripenem) MIC, CLSI Carba NP, and carbapenemases by validated
PCR. Results from those three different tests were used to determine the carbapenemase
positive/negative status of an isolate, with the final composite reference result based on
agreement of at least two of the three tests.
Agreement between RAPIDEC CARBA NP and composite reference method was
assessed. When a RAPIDEC CARBA NP result was not in agreement with the composite
reference result, it was evaluated for false negative and false positive. A negative
RAPIDEC CARBA NP result was considered as a false negative when the composite
reference result was determined to be positive. A positive RAPIDEC CARBA NP result
was considered as a false positive when the composite reference result was determined to
be negative, indicating a false carbapenemase producer. The comparative performance is

Routine Subculture/Incubation
The RAPIDEC CARBA NP test was evaluated with Enterobacteriaceae and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonial growth on sheep blood agar medium incubated for 18-
24 hours (routine subculture/incubation). An initial RAPIDEC CARBA NP reading was
performed at 30 minutes and if negative a final reading was performed at a total of
2 hours of 33-38°C incubation.
The routine subculture/incubation procedure included 457 samples in which 306 were
clinical samples provided by the investigational sites and 151 were well-characterized
challenge samples. It included 394 Enterobacteriaceae and 63 Pseudomonas aeruginosa
with carbapenemases described below:
• 265 isolates were positive for carbapenemase enzyme encoded by genetic markers
as follows: KPC (147), NDM (52), VIM (26), IMP (17), and OXA-48 (23).
• 192 isolates were carbapenemase enzymes negative.
The Routine Subculture/Incubation performance in 2x2 tabular format is presented in
Table 9.2.

Short Subculture/Incubation
In the Short Subculture/Incubation procedure, organisms were sub-cultured onto
MacConkey agar and incubated for 18- 24 hours. The organisms from the MacConkey
then were subcultured again onto blood agar and incubated for 4-5 hours to obtain
sufficient growth/biomass to perform the RAPIDEC CARBA NP. An initial RAPIDEC
CARBA NP reading was performed at 30 minutes and if negative a final reading was
performed at a total of 2 hours of 33-38°C incubation.
The short subculture/incubation procedure included 449 samples in which 300 were
clinical samples provided by the investigational sites and 149 were well-characterized
challenge samples. It included 392 Enterobacteriaceae and 57 Pseudomonas aeruginosa
with carbapenemase enzymes described below:
• 261 isolates were positive for carbapenemase enzymes: KPC (146), NDM (52),
VIM (23), IMP (17), and OXA-48 (23).
• 188 isolates were carbapenemase enzyme negative.
