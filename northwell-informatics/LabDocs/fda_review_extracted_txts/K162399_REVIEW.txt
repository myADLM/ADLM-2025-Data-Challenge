L. Test Principle:
The Atellica CH Mg assay is based on the modified xylidyl blue reaction. The reagent
was modified to eliminate the use of organic solvents. Magnesium ions react with xylidyl
blue in an alkaline medium to form a water-soluble purple-red complex. The increase in
absorbance of xylidyl blue at 505/694 nm is proportional to the concentration of
magnesium in the sample. Calcium is excluded from the reaction by complexing with
EGTA.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3. Precision
was tested in 2 replicates per run, two runs per day for 20 days for a total of 80
results with controls, serum and lithium-heparin plasma pools on one instrument.
The data are summarized in the following table.
Sample N Mean Within Run Within-Lab Precision
Type mg/dL SD, mg/dL %CV SD, mg/dL %CV
Serum 80 0.78 0.23 3.0 0.31 3.9
Plasma 80 1.51 0.034 2.3 0.051 3.4
Serum QC 80 2.53 0.044 1.7 0.050 2.0
Serum 80 4.22 0.024 0.6 0.0477 1.1

Urine QC2 80 11.19 0.108 1.0 0.141 1.3
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated with 10 samples which spanned the assay measuring
interval for serum specimens (0.42-5.61 mg/dL) and 10 samples which spanned
the assay measuring interval for urine specimens (0.65-16.08 mg/dL). Each was
prepared by mixing high and low concentration samples across the measurement
interval as described in CLSI EP06-A. The high sample was prepared by spiking
native serum or urine pools with magnesium acetate. Low pools were created by
diluting serum and urine samples with saline solution. Four replicates were
measured for each sample. The mean of these replicates was used for the
regression analysis, as summarized below.

This study demonstrated linearity across the claimed measuring ranges: 0.50 to
5.00 mg/dL for serum and plasma specimens and 1.00 to 14.00 mg/dL for urine
specimens.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Atellica CH Magnesium calibrators were previously cleared in k050374 and
are traceable to the Atomic Absorption reference method, which is calibrated with
NIST SRM 929 reference material.
Stability:
Real time stability protocols and acceptance criteria for the Atellica CH
Magnesium reagents were reviewed and appear to support a closed vial storage
claim of 12 months at 2-8 Co and an onboard shelf life claim of 14 days at 2-8 Co.
Stability studies are ongoing.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation
(LoQ) were evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2. Studies were
performed in the following manner.
To calculate the Limit of Blank (LoB), four samples with no analyte were
measured in replicates of five for three days using three reagent lots. To estimate
the Limit of Detection (LoD), four samples containing low levels of magnesium
were measured in replicates of five for three days using three reagent lots. To
estimate the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ), four samples containing low levels of
magnesium were measured in replicates of five for three days using three reagent
lots on one instrument.
The detection limit study results are summarized below:
Sample Type Serum, mg/dL Urine, mg/dL
LoB 0.00 0.00
LoD 0.02 0.04
LoQ 0.46 0.57

The detection limit studies support the claimed measuring range of 0.50 – 5.0
mg/dL for serum and plasma samples, and 1.00 – 14.0 mg/dL for urine samples.
e. Analytical specificity:
The Atellica CH Magnesium (Mg) reagent cartridge was evaluated for
interferences according to CLSI EP7-A2. Potential interfering compounds were
spiked into fresh serum or urine sample pools containing either low or high levels
of magnesium. Bias was defined as the difference in the results between the
control sample (without the interferent) and the test sample (contains the
interferent) expressed in percent. The sponsor considered interference as bias
exceeding 10%.
The highest concentration of substances tested that did not cause significant
interference is summarized in the tables below:

o Do not use hemolyzed samples. Because Mg concentrations are 3 times
higher in red blood cells than in serum, hemolyzed samples may give
spuriously elevated magnesium results. Bias from hemolysis may vary due to
individual sample variations in intracellular magnesium.
o Hemoglobin concentrations above 500 mg/dL may result in a positive bias in
serum/plasma specimens. Hemoglobin at 750 mg/dL increases the
magnesium result in serum/plasma at 1.60 mg/dL by 13%.
o Unconjugated bilirubin concentrations above 15 mg/dL may result in a
positive bias in urine specimens. Unconjugated bilirubin at 30 mg/dL
increases the magnesium result in urine at 2.00 mg/dL by 11%.
o EDTA concentrations above 12.5 mg/dL may result in a negative bias in
serum/plasma specimens. EDTA at 25 mg/dL decreases the magnesium result
in serum/plasma at 1.60 mg/dL and 2.60 mg/dL by -15%.
o Zinc concentrations above 0.25 mg/dL may result in a positive bias in
serum/plasma specimens. Zinc at 0.5 mg/dL increases the magnesium result in
serum/plasma at 1.60 mg/dL by 19%. Zinc at 0.5 mg/dL increases the
magnesium result in serum/plasma at 2.60 mg/dL by 14%.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The comparator device selected for the method comparison study was the
Dimension Magnesium Flex Reagent Cartridge. Serum, lithium heparin plasma,
and urine samples were tested. The study included native and diluted samples
spanning the claimed assay intervals. For serum, 8 samples were diluted and the
remainder were native. For lithium heparin plasma, 8 samples were diluted and
the remainder were native. For urine, no samples were diluted; all were native.
For all tests, native samples made up more than 90% of the sample pool.
The results across the full assay intervals were analyzed using Deming regression.
One replicate of each sample was tested and used in the analysis.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Reference intervals are based on literature (see table below). In addition, the
reference intervals were verified using 20 healthy adults on the Atellica CH
Analyzer in accordance with CLSI Document EP28-A3c. As with all in vitro
diagnostic assays, each laboratory should determine its own reference interval for
the diagnostic evaluation of patient results. Consider these values as guidance
only.
