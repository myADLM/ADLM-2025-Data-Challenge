L. Test Principle:
Coagulation Factor V and Coagulation Factor VII with Dade® Innovin®
Factor activity is determined by mixing and incubating diluted patient plasma with deficient
plasma and Dade® Innovin® (thromboplastin), leading to the activation of the extrinsic
coagulation pathway. A prothrombin time (PT) assay is performed using the patient plasma
and deficient plasma mixture. Clotting time is measured from the addition of thromboplastin
to the formation of a fibrin clot. Results are reported as percent of norm based on the PT
result compared to a standard curve obtained with dilutions of Standard Human Plasma.
Protein C with Berichrom® Protein C
Protein C in the patient sample is activated by snake venom extract contained in the Protein
C Activator, followed by addition of a chromogenic substrate (Substrate Reagent). The
activated protein C is assayed in a kinetic test by measuring the increase in absorbance at 405
nm. Results are reported as percent of norm based on the measured change in absorbance
compared to a standard curve obtained with dilutions of Standard Human Plasma.
Protein C with Protein C Reagent
Protein C in the patient sample is activated by addition of a specific snake venom contained
in the Protein C Activator Reagent. Activated protein C inhibits Factor V and Factor VIII
contained in the added Protein C Deficient Plasma, which prolongs the subsequent APTT
test. The prolongation of APTT is a measure of the protein C content of the patient sample.
Graduated dilutions of a standard plasma permit a standard curve to be established from
which the protein C content of patient samples can be read in percent of norm.

b. Linearity/clinically reportable range:
Linear ranges were established for the following applications: protein C activity using
Berichrom® Protein C and Protein C Reagent, factor V using Coagulation Factor V
with Dade® Innovin®, and factor VII using Coagulation Factor VII with Dade®
Innovin®. The linearity studies were performed in one testing day using a single
Sysmex CS-5100 and single lot of reagents. A high concentration sample pool was
serially diluted to various concentrations using a diluent pool. A minimum of 10
different dilutions were prepared and analyte concentrations were measured in
replicates of four. The arithmetic mean, standard deviation and coefficient of
variation were calculated for each sample concentration. Deviation between the linear
regression model (predicted value from 1st order regression) and the best fitting
polynomial regression model was calculated for each sample concentration.

Traceability
Standard Human Plasma (SHP) is used for the calibration of the following
applications: Coagulation Factor V with Dade® Innovin®, Coagulation Factor VII
with Dade® Innovin®, protein C with Protein C Reagent, and protein C with
Berichrom® Protein C.
Control Plasma N (CPN) and Control Plasma P (CPP) are assayed controls used to
monitor the performance of the above assays on the Sysmex® CS-5100. SHP, CPN,
and CPP are traceable to the following WHO Standard reference materials: 02/342,
09/172, and 03/116.
Value Assignment
Primary standards/calibrators for factor V, factor VII and protein C are prepared from
the respective WHO Standards and used to assign the values of the secondary
standard, the SHP masterlot. Product (commercial) lots of SHP, Control N and

Control P are value assigned with the secondary standard using a similar value
assignment process.
On-Board Stability Testing for Calibrator and Controls
Standard Human Plasma is intended to be used immediately following reconstitution;
therefore, an on-board stability study was not required. Real-time on-board stability
testing for Control Plasma N and Control Plasma P was conducted internally. Three
lots of Control Plasma N and P were tested over several time points distributed over
the expected stability claim. Stability was assessed in terms of measurand drift for
each control level and lot and found to be acceptable to support the 17-hour and 14-
hour on-board stability claims for Control Plasma N and Control Plasma P,
respectively.
On-Board Stability Testing for Reagents
Real-time on-board stability testing for Coagulation Factor V Deficient Plasma,
Coagulation Factor VII Deficient Plasma, Protein C Reagent, and Berichrom Protein
C was conducted internally using pooled plasma and control materials as test
samples. The test samples were selected to cover the clinically reportable range for
each assay. For each reagent, several testing time points were pre-defined and
distributed over the expected on-board stability claims. Stability was assessed in
terms of measurand drift for each test sample and found to be acceptable to support
the following claims.
Reagent On-Board Stability Claim
Reagent APTT (APTT reagent for
protein C): 66 hours with reagent cap
Activator (Protein C activator): 66 hours

Shelf-life and Open-Vial Stability Testing
Shelf-life and open-vial stability were reviewed in premarket notifications: K924405
(CPP), K924403 (CPN), K890634 (Berichrom® Protein C), K924425 and K002541
(Protein C Reagent), K924400 (Coagulation Factor VII Deficient Plasma), and
K924394 (Coagulation Factor V Deficient Plasma). Therefore, additional stability
studies were not required to support substantial equivalence in this premarket
notification.

d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD)
Coagulation Factor V with Dade® Innovin®, Coagulation Factor VII Deficient Plasma
with Dade® Innovin®, and protein C with Protein C Reagent are prothrombin time
(PT) clot-based applications, for which LoB and LoD are not applicable.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
LoQ was verified by testing five low-analyte plasma pools. The plasma pools were
prepared by dilution of normal plasma with the respective application-specific
deficient plasma. The study was conducted over three testing days, one run per day
and four replicates per run. Each application met the pre-defined acceptance criteria
to support the lower limit of the clinically reportable range (CRR).

Interference Testing
A dose-response experiment was carried out to determine the degree of hemoglobin
and bilirubin interference as a function of the interferent concentration. A five-level
dose-response series of interferent concentrations was prepared by mixing a low and a
high plasma pool. For the Coagulation Factor V and VII with Dade® Innovin®
applications, three plasma pools were prepared representing low, pathological, and
normal factor activity levels. For protein C with Protein C Reagent and Berichrom®
Protein C, two plasma pools were prepared representing normal and pathological
protein C activity levels.
To investigate the interference of triglycerides, native lipemic plasma samples
covering the low and high factor activity and protein C activity levels were used. A
control pool was prepared from the native samples according to internal procedure.
Control and test (lipemic) samples were tested for each application.
Interferenc testing was performed with one reagent lot, one instrument, and one
calibrator lot. The relative mean difference to the control sample was calculated for

b. Matrix comparison:
To demonstrate matrix equivalency of fresh and frozen citrated plasma, a matrix
comparison study was conducted at a single site using paired samples collected in
3.2% sodium citrate anticoagulant. The samples were selected to cover the clinical
reportable range and defined medical decision point for each application. The
Passing-Bablok approach was used to estimate the parameters of the regression model
(slope, intercept, 95% confidence intervals and correlation coefficient) for each
application. The results of the Passing-Bablok regression analysis and bias between
the paired samples on the Sysmex® CS-5100 met the defined acceptance criteria for
all applications.

(closed) and uncapped (open) sampling from collection tubes, and the micro-sample
mode for open (uncapped) sampling. In the normal mode, capped and uncapped samples
may be loaded into the same sample rack for analysis. Automatic reanalysis is also an
exclusive function of the normal mode. In the micro-sample mode, uncapped samples
may be loaded in the sampler or STAT holder.
5. Calibration:
Calibration is performed using Standard Human Plasma (SHP) as an automated function
of the Sysmex® CS-5100. A new standard curve must be established when changing a
reagent lot, post-major maintenance or service, if indicated by quality control results, and
when required according to laboratory control procedures and government regulations.
6. Quality Control:
Quality control testing using Control Plasma N and Control Plasma P should be
performed at least every 8 hours during intervals of patient testing. Controls should be
run after a new standard curve is established and after each change of reagent. Patient test
results should not be reported if controls are out of range.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Carryover:
Reagent carryover studies were conducted for each testing application using normal and
pathological pooled plasmas. Several carryover events were analyzed for the following
reagent components of the associated applications: Dade® Innovin® for Coagulation
Factor V and Coagulation Factor VII, Reagent APTT and Activator for Protein C
Reagent, in addition to Activator and Substrate for Berichrom® Protein C. Results were
within the pre-defined acceptance criteria for relative bias.
Sample carryover studies were conducted internally for each application using high-
concentration samples with potential to cause interference with the subsequent low-
concentration test samples. The difference between concentrations was reported as
absolute mean deviation for each application. The results were within the pre-defined
acceptance criteria.
2. Mode-to-Mode Comparison:
To demonstrate equivalency between results generated in the micro and normal modes,
plasma samples were tested in each mode in singlicate. In addition to the determination
of Pearson correlation coefficient and predicted bias at medical decision points, Passing-
Bablok regression analysis was performed and found to be within the pre-defined
acceptance criteria for each application.

3. Ambient Temperature Testing:
Each study was carried out with one Sysmex® CS-5100 analyzer, one reagent lot, and one
calibrator lot. In addition to pooled plasma, Control Plasma N and P were tested in a
minimum of five replicates on three different days, each day representing a different
ambient temperature (15°C, 22°C, and 30°C). The mean values were calculated for each
sample and the relative (percent) or absolute differences were calculated for each
application and found to be within the pre-defined acceptance criteria.
4. Dilution Analysis Comparison
The auto-dilution and 2:1 processing modes are analysis features performed
automatically by the Sysmex® CS-5100. Automatic dilutions are performed when the
observed measurement result is outside the reportable range. The auto-dilution mode
performs dilutions for measurement results above the reportable range and the 2:1
processing mode performs dilutions for measurement results below the reportable range.
In addition to the automated dilution modes, the operator can optionally perform a
dilution analysis on demand. Samples were selected for each dilution and testing was
performed by the automated dilution modes (auto-dilution or 2:1 processing) and
compared against results of manually diluted samples analyzed by the Sysmex® CS-5100.
Relative (%) deviation was calculated for each sample and found to be within the pre-
defined acceptance criteria for each application.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
