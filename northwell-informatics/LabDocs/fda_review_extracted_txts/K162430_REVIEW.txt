c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The UniStrip1 Generic Blood Glucose Test Strips are traceable to the NIST SRM
#917c glucose standard. The method comparison study was performed using the
candidate devices and YSI as the reference method (see Section 2.a.)
Test Strip Stability:
Stability of the UniStrip1 Generic Blood Glucose Test Strips was assessed using real
time and accelerated testing. Protocols and acceptance criteria for these studies were
reviewed and found to be acceptable to support the manufacturer claimed shelf life
stability of 24 months and opened vial stability of 3 months when stored at 39°F-
104°F (4-40°C) and relative humidity of 10-90%.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity in section M1b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed to evaluate exogenous and endogenous substances
using three lots of UniStrip1 Generic Blood Glucose Test Strips and the OneTouch
Ultra meter. Venous blood was spiked to two glucose levels (50-100 and 250-350
mg/dL) and the potential interferent concentrations were tested at 4 levels ranging
from therapeutic (or physiological) to toxic (or pathological). Each interferent and
glucose concentration were tested in replicates of five with each test strip lot and
compared to the control sample containing no added interferent. Results are shown

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To assess the performance of the UniStrip1 Generic Blood Glucose Test Strips and
the OneTouch Ultra meter in the hands of the intended users the sponsor performed a
study with 100 English speaking lay user participants. Using only the written labeling
materials, the users performed fingerstick, palm and forearm testing, after which a
technician obtained venous blood to measure glucose using the YSI-2300. Results
were analyzed by comparing the results from the UniStrip1 Generic Blood Glucose
Test Strips and the OneTouch meters obtained by the lay users against the YSI 2300
reference value. The range of samples tested was 45-544 mg/dL as measured by the
YSI. Results are summarized below:

N. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Altitude study: The effect of altitude on the performance of the UniStrip1 Generic Blood
Glucose Test Strips with the OneTouch Ultra meter was evaluated using venous whole
blood samples spiked with glucose to 5 concentrations (43, 82, 131, 199 and 318 mg/dL).
Each meter model was used to test each sample five times on 3 test strip lots at altitudes
of 298, 4790, and 11,161 feet above sea level. The results from each measurement were
compared to the YSI values for each sample. The results demonstrate acceptable bias to
YSI and support the labeling claims that altitudes up to 10,000 feet have no significant
effect on performance of the UniStrip1Generic Blood Glucose Test Strips with the
claimed meters.
2. Hematocrit study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the
UniStrip1 Generic Blood Glucose Test Strips with the OneTouch Ultra meter was
evaluated using venous whole blood samples with hematocrit levels of 25, 30, 42, 50 and
9

--- Page 10 ---
60% spiked with glucose to 3 concentrations (40, 139, and 315 mg/dL). Each sample
was then tested in replicates of 10 using each meter type with three lots of UniStrip1
Generic Blood Glucose Test Strips and the values were compared with those obtained
from YSI analyzer. The % biases relative to YSI were acceptable within the claimed
hematocrit range of 30 to 55%.
3. Sample volume study: A sample volume study was performed using venous whole
blood samples spiked to five glucose concentrations (41.2, 76.8, 113, 176, and 337
mg/dL, as measured by YSI) to evaluate the effect of different sample volumes (0.6, 0.8,
0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.3, and 1.5 mL) on the performance of the device. Results at each sample
volume were compared to the corresponding YSI values. Three lots of test strips and 10
measurements per lot were used on the OneTouch Ultra meter. Results from these studies
support the claimed minimum sample volume of 1.0 mL.
4. Operating Conditions: The operating temperature range and relative humidity range
(RH) were evaluated by placing OneTouch meters, with the UniStrip1 Generic Blood
Glucose Test Strips, in environmental chambers with the following temperature/relative
humidity combinations: 6°C/10% RH, 6°C/90% RH, 25°C/10% RH, 25°C/90% RH,
44°C/10% RH and 44°C/90% RH. Fresh venous blood samples with glucose
concentrations of approximately 49, 152 and 317 mg/dL were tested five times with each
glucose meter model at all of the temperature/RH combinations shown above and the
results from each measurement were compared to the YSI values for each sample. These
results support the sponsor’s claims in the labeling that the UniStrip 1 Generic Blood
Glucose test strips with the claimed meters can be used in the temperature and humidity
ranges specified in the device labeling, that is 42-111°F (6-44°C) and 10-90%RH.
5. Readability Assessment: A Flesch-Kinkaid reading level assessment was conducted
demonstrating that the test strip and control inserts were written at or below an 8th grade
reading level.
6. Customer Support: The user is instructed to call 1.866.889.6229 for additional
assistance, Monday - Friday, 9am - 5pm EST.
7. Software validation: Software validation testing was performed demonstrating that the
error codes displayed by the OneTouch Ultra meter functioned as intended with the
UniStrip1 Generic Blood Glucose Test Strips when set at calibration code 49.
O. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
P. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
