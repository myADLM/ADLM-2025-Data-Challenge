H. Intended Use:
1. Intended Use(s):
The Sofia Influenza A+B FIA employs immunofluorescence to detect influenza A and
influenza B viral nucleoprotein antigens in direct nasal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, and
nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash specimens and nasopharyngeal swab and nasopharyngeal
aspirate/wash specimens in transport media from symptomatic patients. This qualitative
test is intended for use as an aid in the rapid differential diagnosis of acute influenza A
and influenza B viral infections. The test is not intended to detect influenza C antigens. A
negative test is presumptive and it is recommended these results be confirmed by viral
culture or an FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay. Negative results do not
preclude influenza virus infections and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment
or other patient management decisions. This test is intended for professional and
laboratory use.
The Sofia Influenza A+B FIA may be used with Sofia or Sofia 2.
Performance characteristics for influenza A and B were established during February
through March 2011 when influenza viruses A/California/7/2009 (2009 H1N1),
A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria-Like) were the predominant
influenza viruses in circulation according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report
from the CDC entitled “Update: Influenza Activity--United States, 2010-2011 Season,
and Composition of the 2011-2012 Influenza Vaccine.” Performance characteristics may
vary against other emerging influenza viruses.
If infection with a novel influenza virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, samples
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture
should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and
culture samples.
2. Indication(s) for Use:
Same as intended use
3. Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special Instrument Requirements:
To be used only with Sofia or Sofia 2 analyzers
I. Device Description:

1. Overview
The Sofia Influenza A+B FIA is a rapid lateral flow immunoassay for the qualitative
detection of influenza A and influenza B nucleoprotein in direct nasal swab (NS),
nasopharyngeal swab (NP), and nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash (NA/W) specimens and
NP and NA/W specimens in transport media collected from patients with signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection. The Sofia Influenza A+B FIA components have not
been modified; detailed description of the lateral flow device is available in submissions
K153012 and K112177, describing the Sofia Influenza A+B FIA use with the original
Sofia analyzer.
The purpose of this submission is to obtain 510(k) clearance for the Sofia Influenza A+B
FIA for use with the newly developed Sofia 2 analyzer. The Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers
are similar in function and design. Both systems utilize the same fail-safes and failure
alert mechanisms, the same calibration and assay-specific cartridges, and the same
ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV LEDs) to excite the fluorophore. The primary
difference between the original Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzer is the design of the optical
detection system. Sofia uses a motorized optics unit to collect fluorescent signal data as it
performs a series of scans across the longitudinal axis of the Sofia Influenza A+B FIA
test strip, whereas Sofia 2 captures a still image of the entire test strip window using a
complimentary color-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera. To emulate Sofia, the Sofia
2 analyzer converts pixels captured by the CMOS camera to fluorescent signal data,
which is analyzed in an equivalent manner to Sofia to yield qualitative test results.
2. Quality Control
See decision summary for K112177.
3. Results Interpretation
There are five possible test results for the Sofia Influenza A+B FIA: influenza A and/or
influenza B positive, influenza A and influenza B negative, or invalid. Influenza A and B
dual positive result should be re-tested and repeated; dual positive result should be
confirmed by virus culture or an FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay. If an
invalid test result is reported, the Sofia Influenza FIA should be repeated with a new
patient sample and a new test cassette.
Note: The Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers may be set to one of two operating modes: Walk
Away or Read Now. Time to results for the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzer are described
below.
· In Walk Away Mode, the user inserts the test cassette into the analyzer immediately
following addition of the specimen to the Sofia Influenza A+B FIA sample port. The
Sofia analyzer automatically times the test development and provides positive or
negative test results after 15 minutes. The Sofia 2 analyzer scans the test cassette
periodically during the test development time and displays a positive test result
3

--- Page 4 ---
between 3 and 15 minutes. If the test is negative, the result will be displayed after 15
minutes.
· In the Read Now Mode, the user incubates the test cassette on the benchtop for 15
minutes before inserting the cassette into the Sofia or Sofia 2 analyzer. Positive and
negative test results are displayed within 1 minute.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
1. Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures.
EP17-A2: Approved Guideline-Second Edition 2012.
L. Test Principle:
See decision summary for K153012; the FDA-cleared Sofia Influenza A+B FIA has not been
modified and it is compatible with the newly developed Sofia 2 analyzer.
M. Performance Characteristics
Limit of detection, reproducibility, assay precision, early read, and method comparison
studies were conducted to demonstrate equivalent performance of the Sofia Influenza A+B
FIA on the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers. Results from each of these studies are described
below. Additional analytical and clinical performance data for the Sofia Influenza A+B FIA
is available under K153012.
1. Analytical Performance
a. Limit of Detection
The limit of detection (LoD) of the Sofia Influenza A+B FIA was established on both the
Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers. The study included two influenza A and two influenza B
virus strains spiked into negative clinical nasal swab matrix, and was designed to follow
the approach outlined in CLSI document EP17-A2, entitled “Evaluation of Detection
Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures.”
Briefly, an initial range finding study was conducted in which each of the four influenza
virus strains was prepared at two different concentrations using the negative clinical
matrix pool and tested in replicates of five with two lots of devices on each of the two
instrument platforms (Sofia and Sofia 2). For each strain, the lowest dilution yielding all
five positive results was then used as the starting concentration for two-fold serial
dilutions. The lowest dilution yielding all 10 positive results was defined as the
preliminary LoD.
Additional 60 replicates of each virus strain at the preliminary LoD were tested on each
of the two lots on each instrument platform. Testing spanned three days with at least 20
replicates run per day for each strain, lot and instrument combination.
The results of the LoD study are shown in Table 1 below.

The newly established LoDs (using a new preparation of the viral strains) for the Sofia
Influenza A+B FIA on the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers differ by less than two-fold,
indicating that the LoD generated on each of the two instruments is similar.
b. Reproducibility
The reproducibility of the Sofia Influenza A+B FIA on Sofia 2 analyzer was evaluated at
three different laboratories. Two to three different operators at each site blindly tested a
series of coded, contrived samples, prepared in negative nasal swab matrix, ranging from
negative to moderate positive influenza A and influenza B. The influenza strains used
were inactivated Influenza A/Hong Kong/8/68 and Influenza B/Allen/45. Testing of the
same panel was also performed in parallel with Sofia in order to collect comparison data.
Each operator at three study sites tested a 15-member reproducibility panel on both the
Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers once per day on 5 different days totaling 150 tests per each of
the three testing sites for a total of 450 samples. The study was conducted in the Read
Now mode.
The percent agreement between the expected results and the reproducibility study results
for the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers for each analyte concentration tested is shown in
Tables 2 and 3, respectively.

Although minor differences in the measured fluorescence were observed between the
Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers, no clinically significant difference was observed in the
qualitative results; all clinical samples produced equivalent qualitative results. The inter-
laboratory qualitative agreement for Sofia Influenza A+B FIA with Sofia and Sofia 2
analyzers was equivalent and ranged from 98.9% to 100%. Similarly, the intra-laboratory
qualitative agreement for Sofia Influenza A+B FIA with Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers was
found comparable and ranged from 98.7% to 100%.
c. Assay Precision
To supplement the reproducibility study, within-laboratory precision of the Sofia and
Sofia 2 analyzers was evaluated. Influenza A/California/07/09 and influenza
B/Malaysian/2506/04 strains were tested at two different analyte concentrations: a “low
positive” sample with an analyte concentration approximately 1X LoD and a “moderate
positive” sample with an analyte concentration 2- 3X LoD. One negative matrix sample
was also included in the testing.
Five samples (negative, low positive (influenza A and B) and moderate positive
(influenza A and B)) were tested on three lots of Sofia influenza A+B FIA cassettes, by
two operators on 12 different days (1 sample x 3 reagent lots x 2 operators x 12 days)
totaling 72 replicates per sample per instrument. The assay was run in Read Now mode
on one Sofia analyzer and one Sofia 2 analyzer.
Overall percent agreement between the expected results and the precision study results
for the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzer is shown in Table 6 below.

Though a difference was observed between Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers for negative
influenza B samples, the qualitative result of the analyzers did not change and all
negative samples were 100% negative by both Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers. Overall, the
study results showed that Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers generated clinically equivalent
qualitative results when used by multiple operators, on multiple device lots, and operated
over multiple days.
d. Early Read
Additional study was performed to support the multi-read feature of the Sofia 2 analyzer
in Walk Away mode i.e., the test cassettes were scanned and interpreted by the Sofia 2
analyzer at 3, 5, 8, 10, and 15 minutes. Positive samples were prepared using one strain
each of influenza A (A/California/07/09) and influenza B (B/Malaysian/2506/04) spiked
in M4-RT transport media. Negative samples were contrived with extraction reagent
reconstituted with solutions of 0.2% to 0.8% mucin in 50% M4-RT and M6 viral
transport media in saline. The study results demonstrated that positive samples
(depending on the viral load) can be interpreted as positive as early as 3 minutes with
Sofia 2 in Walk Away mode.
2. Comparison Studies
a. Method Comparison
A method comparison study using clinical samples was conducted to demonstrate
comparable performance of the Sofia Influenza A+B FIA using the Sofia and Sofia 2
analyzers. The study was conducted at three sites testing identical specimen panels that
consisted of 100 influenza A positive, 50 influenza B positive, and 100 influenza
negative clinical samples. Each panel member was assigned to one of the analyte
concentration levels based on the signal-to-cutoff ratio (S/CO) that was obtained from a
single replicate on the Sofia analyzer. The Table 8 below shows the S/CO for each level.

The method comparison study results demonstrate that the performance of the Sofia
Influenza A+B FIA on the Sofia 2 is comparable to the predicate device. There were 22
discordant results for influenza A and 8 discordant results for influenza B across all the
three sites. Eighteen samples of the 22 discordant influenza A results were categorized as
“high negative” and four samples were characterized as “Low positive (1X LoD)”. All
eight influenza B discordant results were characterized as “high negative”. These
discordant results were observed across all three sites and were generated by multiple
operators, no trend indicating any instrument bias was observed.
For influenza A specimens, 100% of the specimens yielded positive results by 8 minutes
and at least 91% by 5 minutes at ≥2-3X LoD; more than 80% were positive by 8 minutes
at 1X LoD. For influenza B specimens, 100% of the specimens yielded positive results by
5 minutes at ≥2-3X LoD; 89% were positive by 5 minutes and 100% were positives by 8
minutes at 1X LoD.

this line of product types.
Yes X or No
4. Level of Concern
Moderate
5. Software Description
The Sofia 2 Analyzer images the test strip and utilizes an embedded software algorithm
to process the resulting data set into a qualitative test result. A positive test result for the
analyte is determined by detection and analysis of the fluorescent signal at the test and
reference lines, which are processed by the assay-specific algorithm. The algorithm
employs a smoothing filter to the data and, identifies a peak maxima, minima and width,
then calculates the RFU value based on peak height for the analyte test line. Results are
presented on a screen and can be printed on an integrated printer.
6. Specimen Identification
Each cassette is labeled with a barcode that is detected by the Sofia 2 internal barcode
reader. The 2-dimensinal barcode contains lot, expiration, and test method information. If
the cassette is not in the correct orientation, the barcode cannot be read and the analyzer
will display an error.
7. Calibration
To ensure that signal drift is controlled, the Sofia 2 analyzer has a calibration algorithm
that reminds the operator to check the calibration status of the instrument every 30 days.
The calibration cassette uses a highly stable fluorescent reagent along with a unique
barcode. The insertion of this cassette triggers the Sofia 2 analyzer to self-check its
calibration.
