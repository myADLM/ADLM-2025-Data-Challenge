H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Xpert® MRSA NxG Assay, performed on the GeneXpert® Instrument Systems, is a
qualitative in vitro diagnostic test intended for the detection of methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) DNA directly from nasal swabs in patients at risk for
nasal colonization. The test utilizes automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
for the amplification of MRSA-specific DNA targets and fluorogenic target-specific
hybridization probes for the real-time detection of the amplified DNA. The Xpert MRSA
NxG Assay is intended to aid in the prevention and control of MRSA infections in
healthcare settings. The Xpert MRSA NxG Assay is not intended to diagnose, guide, or
monitor treatment for MRSA infections, or provide results of susceptibility to methicillin.
A negative result does not preclude MRSA nasal colonization. Concomitant cultures are
necessary to recover organisms for epidemiological typing or for further susceptibility
testing.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use only.
The Xpert MRSA NxG Assay may generate a false positive MRSA (MRSA DETECTED)
result when testing a nasal specimen with a mixture of organisms containing both
methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and an empty cassette SA.
The Xpert MRSA NxG Assay may generate a false negative result (MRSA NOT
DETECTED) in the event of a co-colonization that contains both methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and an empty cassette Staphylococcus aureus (SA). This
may occur in rare cases when the titer of an empty cassette SA organism is substantially
higher than that of the MRSA organism.

Assay interference may be observed in the presence of Nasonex (≥50% v/v), Flonase
(≥50% v/v), and Beconase (≥40% v/v).
4. Special instrument requirements:
The Xpert MRSA NxG assay is for use on the GeneXpert Dx, GeneXpert Infinity-48,
GeneXpert Infinity-48s and GeneXpert Infinity-80 instrument systems.
I. Device Description:
The Xpert MRSA NxG Assay is an automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in
vitro diagnostic test for qualitative detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) directly from nasal swab specimens of patients at risk for colonization with MRSA
in a healthcare setting.
The Xpert MRSA NxG Assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpertInstrument Systems
(GeneXpert Dx, GeneXpert Infinity-48, GeneXpert Infinity-48s, and GeneXpert Infinity-80
systems), which automate sample preparation, amplification and real-time detection in
single-use, disposable cartridges.
Each Xpert MRSA NxG cartridge contains primers and probes to detect sequences within the
mecA and mecC genes, as well as insertion of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec
(SCCmec) at the S. aureus chromosome attB site. The assay incorporates a Sample
Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) to monitor the integrity of the
reagents and process workflow.
The GeneXpert Instrument Systems have between 1 and 80 randomly accessible modules,
depending upon the instrument, that are each capable of performing separate sample
preparation and real-time PCR assays. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing
fluids, an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells, and a thermocycler unit for real-time PCR
amplification and detection.
Once the instrument is loaded and the test initiated, all the steps associated with sample
processing, PCR amplification/detection and result interpretation occur automatically. The
final result report can be viewed and/or printed.

L. Test Principle:
The Xpert MRSA NxG Assay is performed on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems
(GeneXpert Dx, GeneXpert Infinity-48, GeneXpert Infinity-48s, and GeneXpert Infinity-80
systems) which automate nucleic acid extraction, amplification and detection in single-use,
disposable cartridges. Each cartridge contains primers and probes for detection of the mecA
and mecC genes that encode methicillin resistance, as well as the junction of the SCCmec
cassette and the S. aureus orfX open reading frame that is formed by insertion of the cassette
into the bacterial chromosome at the attB integration site.
Each cartridge also includes a Sample Processing Control and Probe Check Control that are
designed to monitor reagent and process integrity.
Nasal swab specimens for testing in the Xpert MRSA NxG Assay are collected using either
the Cepheid Sample Collection Device (dual rayon swab) or the Copan Liquid Amies Elution
Swab (ESwab™), or equivalent, and are transported to the laboratory or designated
GeneXpert testing area. For the Cepheid Sample Collection Device, one swab is placed
directly into a tube containing 2mL of Elution Reagent and, after a brief vortex, the entire
volume is transferred to the Xpert MRSA NxG cartridge. For samples collected using the
ESwab, 300µL of the Amies transport medium is mixed with 2mL of Elution Reagent, after
which all 2.3mL of liquid are transferred to the test cartridge.
The operator initiates a test from the user interface and loads the cartridge into the GeneXpert
instrument, after which all process steps are performed automatically. Once complete, the
final result report can be viewed and printed. Results are reported as MRSA DETECTED,
MRSA NOT DETECTED, ERROR, INVALID or NO RESULT (Table 1). Instructions for
retesting are provided for samples with indeterminate results. For a report of MRSA
DETECTED, detection of both the mecA/mecC and SCCmec targets is required.
7

--- Page 8 ---
The Xpert MRSA NxG Assay has an Early Termination Feature whereby results for samples
that are strongly positive for MRSA are reported prior to completion of the full number of
PCR cycles designated in the assay definition file.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To estimate the components of variance associated with the Xpert MRSA NxG Assay
a Reproducibility Study was conducted at 3 sites, with 2 operators per site. Each
operator tested a 5 member panel of samples twice per day over 6 days using 3 lots of
reagents (3 sites x 2 operators/site x 2 panels/day x 2 replicates/panel member x 6
days = 144 results/panel member). Each site conducted testing on a different
GeneXpert System; Site 1: Infinity-80, Site 2: GeneXpert Dx; Site 3: Infinity-48.
Samples were prepared in simulated nasal matrix and frozen until testing. Separate
studies were conducted to demonstrate equivalent assay performance with simulated
and natural nasal matrix as well as with fresh and frozen samples (Section M(2)(b)).
The panel members for the Reproducibility Study are summarized in Table 2.

Percent agreement for strain LGA251 was 100% (144/144) at both target levels. For
strain N315, agreement was 100% (144/144) for the Moderate Positive samples and
98.6% (142/144) for the Low Positive samples. For negative samples, agreement was
100% (144/144). ANOVA (Analysis Of Variance) was performed to assess the
variance components of the Ct values for the mecA/mecC, SCCmec and SPC targets
(Table 3). The total variation for all targets was between 0.8 and 1.1 Ct (2.6-3.8%).
The Xpert MRSA NxG Assay demonstrated acceptable reproducibility across sites,
GeneXpert systems, operators, panel members and reagent lots.

External Controls
Commercially available External Positive and Negative Controls were run each day
that specimens were tested during the two prospective Clinical Studies to evaluate the
performance of the Xpert MRSA NxG Assay (Section M(3)). Before testing of any
clinical specimens, the expected results had to be obtained with both External
Controls. The workflow for testing of the External Controls was the same in both
studies and is described in the Xpert MRSA NxG Assay Package Insert. A summary
of the External Control results from both studies, as well as the two studies combined,
is provided in Table 4.

An additional evaluation of the recommended External Controls was conducted by
testing 3 lots of each control material with 3 lots of Xpert MRSA NxG Assay
reagents. Of 180 External Negative Controls tested, 174 (96.7%) produced the
expected result on initial testing, as did 177/180 (98.3%) External Positive Controls.
Internal Controls
Each Xpert MRSA NxG Assay includes two types of Internal Control to monitor the
performance of the system
Sample Processing Control (SPC): Designed to monitor bacterial lysis and sample
inhibition. Test results are reported as INVALID if the SPC fails.
Probe Check Control (PCC): Fluorescence measurement to monitor probe
rehydration and integrity, as well as filling of the reaction tube. Test results are
reported as ERROR if the PCC fails.
The performance of the Internal Controls was verified by testing various potential
failure modes due to errors in the manufacture of the Xpert MRSA NxG Assay

reagents or the assay procedure. Under the conditions tested, the Internal Controls
failed appropriately and no false positive or false negative results for the detection of
MRSA were reported.
Sample Stability
The stability of nasal swab specimens for use with the Xpert MRSA NxG Assay was
determined analytically by testing two strains of MRSA that were seeded onto swabs
at target levels close to the LOD of the assay. MRSA negative samples were also
included in order to assess the effect of sample storage on the performance of the
SPC. The study was performed with both the Cepheid Sample Collection Device
(rayon swab) and ESwab using simulated nasal matrix (Section M(2)(b)). Samples
were placed at different temperatures and tested at specified intervals. Results were
analyzed qualitatively and by ANOVA to assess differences in Ct values for the
mecA/mecC, SCCmec and SPC targets over time. No MRSA false negative or false
positive results were observed during the course of the study and there were no
important differences in Ct values between samples tested at baseline (Day 0) and
those tested at any time point in the study. This study indicates that samples collected
with both swab types are stable for up to 24 hours at 15-30°C and up to 7 days at 2-
8°C.
Cartridge Hold Time
After loading onto the GeneXpert Infinity System, assay cartridges may have to wait
for a GeneXpert module to become available before being processed. A study was
therefore conducted to determine the maximum permissible interval between addition
of a sample to an Xpert MRSA NxG Assay cartridge and testing on the GeneXpert
Infinity System. The study was performed with MRSA positive (3X LOD) and
negative samples prepared with simulated nasal matrix. The samples were added to
Xpert MRSA NxG Assay cartridges that were held for up to 5 hours under different
environmental conditions prior to testing (i.e., ambient temperature/ humidity,
25°C/75% relative humidity or 35°C). The expected results were obtained at each
time point and there were no important differences in Ct values under any of the
conditions tested. The results of the study support the recommended maximum
interval of 4.5 hours from sample addition to the Xpert MRSA NxG Assay cartridges
to processing on the GeneXpert Infinity System.
d. Detection limit:
Determination of the Limit of Detection
The analytical sensitivity of the Xpert MRSA NxG Assay was determined by testing
dilutions of organisms representing 13 different MRSA genotypes in simulated nasal
matrix (Section M(2)(b)). The Limit of Detection (LOD) was determined for each
strain using logistic regression according to the guidance in CLSI Document EP17-
A2. Testing was performed with both specimen collection and transport devices at
five different concentrations of each strain. The LOD point estimates were confirmed
by testing an additional 20 replicates of each strain at the claimed LOD target level.
At least 19/20 replicates had to produce positive results in order for the LOD to be
12

considered confirmed. A summary of the results of the study is presented in Table 5.
This study demonstrated that, with the Cepheid Sample Collection Device (rayon
swab), the Xpert MRSA NxG Assay will produce a positive result ≥95% of the time
with nasal swabs containing 302 CFU/swab. With the Eswab specimen collection and
transport device, the Xpert MRSA NxG Assay will produce a positive result ≥95% of
the time with nasal swabs containing 812 CFU/swab.

Analytical Reactivity/Inclusivity
A study was conducted to demonstrate the ability of the Xpert MRSA NxG Assay to
detect strains of MRSA isolated from different geographical regions and with
different genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. A total of 196 strains were tested
including representatives of Cooper & Feil Groups 1A, 1B and 2, SCCmec types I,
IA, II, III, IIIA, III-Hg, IV, IVa, IVb, IVc, IVd, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X and XI, 48
different spa-types, 12 different Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) types and
16 clonal complexes. Heteroresistant strains and the mecC variant strain LGA251
were also tested, as was a “Challenge Panel” of 59 strains with known oxacillin MIC
values ranging from 0.5 to >32µg/mL. All 196 strains were successfully detected in
simulated nasal matrix at a concentration of 906 CFU/swab (3X the highest LOD
shown in Table 5 for the Cepheid Sample Collection Device (rayon swab)). These
results are acceptable.

panel of 152 potentially cross-reactive microorganisms, including 40 strains of
methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), 7 strains of Borderline Oxacillin Resistant
S. aureus (BORSA) and 57 Gram positive bacteria, of which 34 were other
Staphylococcus spp. Also included in the study were 25 strains of Gram negative
bacteria, 3 yeast species, 17 viruses and human cells.
Note: Included in the panel of microorganisms were two SCCmec “empty cassette”
variants of S. aureus (1 MSSA and 1 BORSA).
Each strain was tested in triplicate in the presence of simulated nasal matrix using the
workflow for the Cepheid Sample Collection Device (rayon swab) as representative
of the “worst case” scenario (i.e., potential for the highest concentration of cross-
reactive organisms in the amplification reaction). Bacteria and yeast were tested at a
concentration of ≥7.5 x 106 CFU/swab. Viruses and human DNA were tested at the
equivalent of ≥2 x 105 TCID /swab and 2 x 105 cells/swab, respectively.
50
The expected results were obtained from all the microorganisms tested, as well as the
human cells, and there was no evidence of the potential for false-positive results due
to cross-reaction with non-target organisms.
Bioinformatic Analysis
The specificity of the Xpert MRSA NxG Assay primers and probes for the targeted
sequences was also evaluated through extensive in silico analysis which showed that
positive results with species other than S. aureus is unlikely to occur, although the
potential for detection with methicillin resistant strains of S. argenteus, a recently
described species of Staphylococcus that is closely related to S. aureus, is noted in the
Package Insert.
Carry-over Contamination Study
To determine the potential for sample-to-sample contamination using the Xpert
MRSA NxG Assay, testing was performed with alternating “high positive” (≥1 x 107
CFU/mL of Elution Reagent) and negative samples. The study was conducted on two
GeneXpert Systems with 20 high positive and 21 negative samples per instrument.
No false-positive results were obtained and the results were therefore determined to
be acceptable.
f. Assay cut-off:
Thresholds and cut-offs for the Xpert MRSA NxG Assay were initially established
through pre-clinical testing using nasal samples collected with the Cepheid Sample
Collection Device (rayon swab). These settings were validated in two prospective
Clinical Studies performed at US and ex-US sites (Section M(3)). The valid Ct
ranges for the mecA/mecC, SCCmec and SPC targets are shown in Table 6.

Valid Ct Range
Target Sequence
Minimum Maximum
mecA/mecC 10 36
SCCmec 10 38
SPC 25 36
SPC: Sample Processing Control
Note: Both the mecA/mecC and SCCmec targets are required to have a
valid Ct in order for a sample to be reported as MRSA DETECTED.
In addition to fixed algorithm parameters within the software Assay Definition File
for the Xpert MRSA NxG Assay, Lot Specific Parameters (LSP) are also generated
for every lot of assay reagents to account for potential variations in production. The
LSP are embedded within the barcode of each assay cartridge and are transferred to
the GeneXpert instrument system when the barcode is scanned.
g. Assay Interference:
The potential for interference with the Xpert MRSA NxG Assay was evaluated with
endogenous and exogenous substances that may be present in nasal swab samples, as
well as a representative panel of commensal bacterial species. Testing was performed
using simulated nasal matrix (Section M(2)(b)) in the presence of two strains of
MRSA (N315: SCCmec Type II; mecA positive and LGA251: SCCmec Type XI;
mecC positive) at approximately 3X LOD using the workflow for the Cepheid
Sample Collection Device (rayon swab) as representative of the “worst case” scenario
(i.e., the highest potential concentration of the interfering substance/organism).
MRSA negative samples were also included to assess the potential for interference
with the SPC. In addition to analysis of qualitative test results, ANOVA was used to
assess differences in Ct values for the mecA/mecC, SCCmec and SPC targets in
relation to appropriate control conditions without any interfering substance or
organisms present.
Potentially Interfering Substances
All MRSA positive and negative samples (n = 8 per condition) were correctly
identified in the presence of each of the potentially inhibitory substances shown in
Table 7. However, notable differences in Ct values relative to the control were
observed with three substances (Beconase, Flonase and Nasonex), all of which were
retested and at lower concentration at which there was no evidence of assay
interference. The potential for assay interference with Flonase, Beconase and
Nasonex is included as a Limitation in the Package Insert. The results of this study
are acceptable,

Comparison of Fresh and Frozen Cell Stocks
Samples for analytical evaluation of assay performance were prepared using MRSA
cell stocks that were grown on Tryptic Soy Agar plates, suspended in phosphate
buffered saline containing 15% (v/v) glycerol and frozen at -80°C. The concentration
of the stocks was determined by performing viable counts. Plate counts performed
before and after freezing at -80°C demonstrated negligible difference indicating that
the integrity of the MRSA cells was maintained during the freeze-thaw process.
Comparison of Performance with Natural and Simulated Matrices
In order to provide a sufficient quantity of specimen matrix for testing, a simulated
nasal matrix was used for the majority of Analytical Studies. The formulation of the
simulated matrix is shown in Table 9. To represent a worst case scenario, each
sample collection swab was seeded with 75µL of simulated matrix (equal to the
absorptive capacity of the swab head).

To assess the suitability of the simulated matrix for use in analytical testing, a
comparison study was conducted to confirm that the Xpert MRSA NxG Assay
performed similarly in the presence of natural and simulated nasal matrix. Testing
was performed with two MRSA strains at different levels, close to the LOD of the
assay and with both types of specimen collection device (rayon swab and ESwab).
The results summarized in Tables 10 (Cepheid Sample Collection Device (rayon
swab)) and 11 (Eswab) show that the percentage of positive results at each target
level met the pre-defined acceptance criteria and therefore that the assay exhibited
similar analytical sensitivity for the detection of MRSA with both natural and
simulated matrix. Ct values for the mecA/mecC, SCCmec and SPC targets were also
similar in both matrices. These results support the use of simulated matrix in the
Analytical Studies to characterize the performance of the Xpert MRSA NxG Assay.

Comparison of Performance with Fresh and Frozen Samples
To support use of frozen samples to characterize the analytical performance of the
Xpert MRSA NxG Assay, a study was conducted to compare fresh matrix and matrix
that was subjected to up to two freeze-thaw cycles. Samples were prepared by
diluting MRSA cell stocks to the appropriate concentration in simulated matrix
(Table 9). The samples were either tested immediately or after freezing at -80°C and
thawing. To challenge the assay, the study was performed by adding 75µL of the
simulated sample matrix to 2mL of Elution Buffer and by transferring the entire

presented in Tables 12 and 13 show that the expected proportion of positive results
was obtained at each target level and that there were negligible differences Ct values
between fresh samples and those that were frozen and thawed up to two times. The
data therefore support use of frozen samples in the Analytical Studies.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The performance of the Xpert MRSA NxG Assay was evaluated in two separate
prospective, multi-center Clinical Studies using nasal swab specimens collected from
subjects at risk for nasal colonization with MRSA. In the first study, testing was
performed with samples collected using the Cepheid Sample Collection Device
(rayon swab). In the second study, testing was performed with samples collected
using the Copan Liquid Amies Elution Swab Collection and Transport System
(ESwab).
The reference method for both studies comprised a combination of direct culture on
MRSA selective chromogenic medium and enriched culture in Trypticase Soy Broth
(TSB) containing 6.5% NaCl, followed by subculture onto blood agar and MRSA
selective chromogenic medium. Identification of presumptive MRSA colonies was
confirmed by Gram stain, catalase and coagulase testing. Susceptibility to cefoxitin
was determined by disk diffusion using a 30µg disk according to the criteria
described in CLSI Document M100-S24.1
Performance with Cepheid Sample Collection Device (rayon swab)
The evaluation of performance with the Cepheid Sample Collection Device (rayon
swab) was performed with specimens collected at 8 geographically diverse sites (6
US and 2 ex-US). A total of 1183 specimens were initially enrolled in the study, of
which 77 were excluded due to protocol deviations (74), site policy (1) or change of
mind by the donor (2). Of the remaining 1106 samples, 31 (2.8%) produced an
indeterminate result on initial testing (ERROR: 15; INVALID: 9; NO RESULT: 7).
Three (3) samples also produced indeterminate results on repeat testing for a final
indeterminate rate of 0.3% (3/1106). The performance of the Xpert MRSA NxG
Assay with the Cepheid Sample Collection Device (rayon swab) in comparison to the
reference method is summarized in Tables 14 and 15.

(1.9%) produced an indeterminate result on initial testing (ERROR: 8; INVALID: 8).
Due to insufficient sample volume, retesting was not performed in this study. The
final indeterminate rate was therefore 1.9% (16/862). The performance of the Xpert

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Nasal swab samples may be collected using either the Cepheid Sample Collection Device
(rayon swab) or the Copan Liquid Amies Elution Swab (ESwab™).
Cepheid Sample Collection Device (rayon swab)
One swab is used for the Xpert MRSA NxG Assay and the second swab is retained for
repeat testing. The swab shaft is broken off into a vial of Xpert MRSA NxG Elution
Reagent and vortexed to elute the target organisms (if present). Using a transfer pipette,
the entire volume of Elution Reagent is then added to the Sample Chamber of the Xpert
MRSA NxG Assay cartridge and the test initiated.
ESwab
The Eswab tube containing the swab is vortexed to elute the sample and 300µL of the
ESwab medium is added to a vial of Xpert MRSA NxG Elution Reagent using a transfer
pipette. The entire volume of liquid from the Elution Reagent vial is then transferred into
the Sample Chamber of the Xpert MRSA NxG Assay cartridge and the test is initiated.
5. Calibration:
No calibration by the user is required.
