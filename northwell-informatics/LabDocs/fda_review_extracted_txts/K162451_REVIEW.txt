L. Test Principle:
The Solana® HSV 1+2/VZV Assay amplifies and detects viral DNA isolated from cutaneous
or mucocutaneous lesion samples obtained from symptomatic patients suspected of active
herpes simplex virus 1, herpes simplex virus 2 and/or varicella-zoster infection.
The Solana® instrument heats each reaction tube to 64°C. If present, the target sequence is
amplified by HSV-1, HSV-2 and/or VZV specific primers and detected by HSV-1, HSV-2
and/or VZV specific fluorescence probes included in the Reaction Tube. Each probe has a
fluorescent dye of specific wavelength. The target probes are labeled with a quencher on one
end and a fluorophore on the other end. In addition, the target probes carry a ribonucleic acid.
Upon annealing to the respective amplicons, the fluorescence probes are cleaved by RNaseH2
and the fluorescence signal increases due to physical separation of fluorophore from quencher.
The Solana® instrument measures and interprets the fluorescent signal, using on-board
method-specific algorithms. The Solana® instrument will then report the test results to the user
on its display screen, and it can print out the results via a printer.
The following is a summary of the procedure:

The patient specimen is transferred to a Process Tube, subjected to heat treatment at 95°C for
5 minutes and mixed and vortexed. The processed sample is transferred to a Reaction Tube
and mixed. The Reaction Tube contains lyophilized HDA reagents, dNTPs, primers and
probes. Once the Reaction Tube contents are rehydrated with the diluted sample, the Reaction
Tube is placed in the Solana® instrument for amplification and detection of specific target
sequences. In the Solana® instrument, the target sequences are amplified by HSV-1, HSV-2
and/or VZV specific primers and detected by HSV-1, HSV-2 and/or VZV specific
fluorescence probes included in the Reaction Tube. A competitive process control (PRC) is
included in the Process Tube to monitor sample processing,inhibitory substances in clinical
samples, reagent failure or device failure. The PRC target is amplified by specific primers
and detected by a PRC specific fluorescence probe.The target and PRC probes are labeled
with a quencher on one end and a fluorophore on the other end. In addition, the target and
PRC probes carry ribonucleic acid. Upon annealing to HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV or PRC
amplicons, the fluorescence probes are cleaved by RNaseH2 and the fluorescence signal
increases due to physical separation of fluorophore from quencher. The Solana® instrument
measures and interprets the fluorescent signal, using on-board method-specific algorithms.
The Solana® instrument will then report the test results to the user on its display screen, and
the results can be printed via an attached printer.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the Solana® HSV 1+2/VZV Assay was evaluated at three
laboratory sites. A reproducibility panel containing 30 contrived samples,
manufactured as high negative samples (n=3; 1/18x or 1/27x LOD (C – C
20 80
concentration)) for HSV-1 MacIntyre, HSV-2 G, and VZV Ellen, low positive
samples (n=3; near the assay limit of detection) for HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV,
moderate positive samples (n=3; 3x LOD) for HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV and negative
samples (n=3) was used for the study. The samples were randomized and blind-coded
within each panel, and the operator tested one (1) panel, together with three (3)
positive and three (3) negative external controls, in three runs. The panels were run by
two operators at each testing site for five (5) non-consecutive days.
Results of the Reproducibility study for the Solana® HSV 1+2/VZV Assay performed
at three sites are presented in the tables below.

The Solana® HSV 1+2/VZV Control Set is available for use with the kit. These
controls are manufactured by ZeptoMetrix according to Quidel Corporation
specifications. The positive control uses a mixture of highly purified, inactivated
strains of HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV in a HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV DNA‐free matrix.
The negative control is the same HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV DNA-free matrix. The
final concentration of HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV is based on the assay’s LOD for the
viral strains, and is intended to be near LOD. The controls are used to monitor the
assay performance as follows:
i. The process control is used to monitor sample processing, to detect HDA
inhibitory specimens and to confirm the integrity of assay reagents and
Solana® instrument functionality. The process control is included in the
Process Buffer tube.
ii. The external positive control is treated as a patient specimen. The control
should be sampled and tested as if it were a specimen and processed as described
in the Assay Procedure. The external positive control is intended to monitor
substantial reagent and instrument failure.
iv. The external negative control is treated as a patient specimen. The control
should be sampled and tested as if it were a specimen and processed as described
in the Assay Procedure. The external negative control is used to detect reagent
or environmental contamination (or carry-over) by HSV 1+2/VZV DNA or
amplicons.

A study was performed to evaluate the performance of the Solana® HSV 1+2/VZV
Assay in the presence of sixty-four (64) microorganisms that could be found in lesion
specimens. Each potentially interfering microorganism was tested in the presence of at
2x LOD HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV viruses, or negative matrix at clinically relevant
levels of the microorganisms. The same microorganisms as listed above in the table
for the Cross Reactivity Study were evaluated in the Microbial Interference Study and
at the same levels listed in the table for Cross Reactivity. There was no interference
observed with the sixty-four (64) organisms tested with the Solana® HSV 1+2/VZV
Assay.
g. Analytical Secificity/Interfering Substances:
The performance of Solana® HSV 1+2/VZV Assay was evaluated with potentially
interfering substances that may be present in lesion specimens. A panel composed of
twenty-six (26) substances was tested in the absence or presence of HSV-1, HSV-2, or
VZV (MacIntyre, G, Ellen strains, respectively) at 2X LOD in the Solana® HSV
1+2/VZV Assay. There was no evidence of interference (false positive or false
negative results) caused by the substances tested at the concentrations shown below.

j. Sample Stability Studies:
Transport Media (Swab) Compatibility and Stability:
HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV virus stocks (HSV-1 MacIntyre, HSV-2 G, and VZV Ellen)
were diluted to their respective 2x LOD concentrations in each in of five (5) transport
medium pooled negative matrix (Remel M4, Remel M4-RT, Remel M5, Remel M6,
or UTM transport medium).
The transport media systems containing the contrived samples were stored at three
different conditions: Condition 1) = room temperature (30 ± 2°C) for 50 hours,
Condition 2) = 2° to 8°C for 8 days, and Condition 3) = -20°C for 8 days.
HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV samples at 2x LOD were stable when stored in M4, M4-
RT, M5, M6, and UTM negative matrix for up to 50 hours at 30°C ± 2°C. HSV-1,
HSV-2, and VZV samples were stable when stored in M4, M4-RT, M5, M6, and
UTM negative matrix for up to 8 days at 2° to 8°C. HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV
samples were stable when stored in M4, M4-RT, M5, M6, and UTM negative matrix
for up to 8 days at -20°C.
These stability data support the claim in the Package Insert that specimens can be
stored at room temperature (up to 30 °C) for up to 48 hours, 2° to 8°C or –20°C for
up to 7 days prior to processing.
Processed Specimen Stability:
HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV virus stocks (HSV-1 MacIntyre, HSV-2 G, and VZV

Ellen) were diluted to their respective 2x LOD concentrations in negative matrix.
Each sample was added to Process Buffer tubes, which were stored at 2° to 8°C
either before or after heat lysis and tested at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 73 hours post-
storage.
Samples are stable in process buffer up to 73 hours at 2° to 8°C before and after the
heat step.
These data support the claim in the Package Insert that specimens in Process Buffer
Tubes may be stored at 2°C to 8°C for up to 72 hours before and after the heat step.
Processed Specimen Stability - 95°C Lysis Time Flex Study:
HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV virus stocks (HSV-1 MacIntyre, HSV-2 G, and VZV
Ellen) were diluted to their respective 2x LOD concentrations in pooled negative
matrix and tested in 3 replicates for each condition. The heat time conditions were 2
minutes, 3 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes and 11 minutes.
HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV and the process control were detected for 3 of 3 replicates
with all tested heat lysis times, indicating that the Solana® HSV 1+2/VZV Assay
tolerates heat lysis times between 2 to 11 minutes at 95°C.
Processed Specimen Stability - 95°C Lysis Temperature Flex Study:
HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV virus stocks (HSV-1 MacIntyre, HSV-2 G, and VZV
Ellen) were diluted to their respective 2x LOD concentrations in pooled negative
matrix and tested in 3 replicates for each condition. The heat lysis temperature
conditions were 92°C, 93°C, 95°C, 97°C and 98°C.
HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV and the process control were detected for 3 of 3 replicates
with all tested heat lysis temperatures, indicating that the Solana® HSV 1+2/VZV
tolerates heat lysis temperatures between 92° to 98°C for 5 minutes.

Clinical Performance:
Performance characteristics of the Solana® HSV 1+2/VZV Assay were established
during a prospective study. One thousand and sixty-two (1062) fresh lesion
specimens, collected for herpes simplex/varicella-zoster detection and
identification, were tested at three (3) sites across the United States. A single
specimen was collected per patient. The specimens were processed and tested with
the Solana® HSV 1+2/VZV Assay on the Solana® instrument at the sites. Each
specimen was also processed and inoculated into two (2) different cell culture
systems within 72 hours of collection. The isolation and identification of HSV-1
and HSV-2 was performed using the FDA-cleared ELVIS HSV ID and D³ Typing
Test. This testing was performed according to the manufacturer’s product insert.
The detection and isolation of VZV was performed by staining cells present in the
specimen with an FDA-cleared VZV detection reagent (DSFA) and by culturing
the specimen for 96-hours using commercially available mixed cell culture (H&V
mixed cells from Diagnostic Hybrids, a Quidel Company) consisting of MRC-5
cells (human diploid fibroblast) and CV-1 cells (african green monkey kidney), and
staining the cultures with the same FDA-cleared reagent used for DSFA. A
specimen was considered positive for VZV if either the DSFA or the culture with
DFA was positive. Testing of the comparator methods (culture with DFA) were
performed at one central location.
The gender and age demographics of the patients enrolled in the study are shown

Cutaneous Lesions
HSV-1: Two-hundred and seventy-five (275) active cutaneous lesion specimens were
cultured for HSV-1, using the FDA-cleared ELVIS cell culture system and were also
tested with the subject device for HSV-1 viral DNA. Samples which gave HSV-2
positive results from the ELVIS method were excluded from the HSV-1 performance
calculation because of the inability of the ELVIS method to distinguish an HSV-1
positive sample when HSV-2 was detected first (n=26). The table below details the
HSV-1 results for the remaining two-hundred and forty-nine (249) specimens.

Solana® HSV 1 + 2/VZV Assay. Two (2) specimens were contaminated and invalid.
Samples which gave HSV-2 positive results from the ELVIS method were excluded
from the HSV-1 performance calculation because of the inability of the ELVIS
method to distinguish an HSV-1 positive sample when HSV-2 was detected first
(n=109). Thus, one hundred and twenty (120) specimens were excluded from further
analysis. The table below details the HSV-1 results for the remaining five hundred

Uncategorized Lesions
HSV-1: One hundred and sixty-six (166) active lesion specimens (not categorized as
cutaneous or mucocutaneous) were cultured for HSV-1, using the FDA-cleared
ELVIS cell culture system and were also tested with the subject device for HSV-1
viral DNA. Samples which gave HSV-2 positive results from the ELVIS method
were excluded from the HSV-1 performance calculation because of the inability of
the ELVIS method to distinguish an HSV-1 positive sample when HSV-2 was

5. Expected Values:
The expected values of the Solana® HSV 1+2/VZV Assay were established during a
prospective study conducted between February and May 2016. One thousand and sixty-
two (1062) specimens were included in this study at three (3) sites across the United
States. A single specimen was collected per patient. The specimens were processed
and tested with the Solana® HSV 1+2/VZV Assay on the Solana® instrument at the sites.
The expected values for HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV with the Solana® HSV 1+2/VZV
Assay were calculated for the combined sites based on the category of specimen
(cutaneous, mucocutaneous, or unknown lesion source) and the age of the patient.
