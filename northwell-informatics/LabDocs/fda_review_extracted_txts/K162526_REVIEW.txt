L. Test Principle:
Creatine kinase (CK) catalyzes the dephosphorylation of creatine phosphate, generating ATP
from ADP. Glucose is then phosphorylated by the ATP formed in the previous reaction to
form D-glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), a process catalyzed by hexokinase (HK). Finally, D-
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) catalyzes the oxidation of G6P by NADP to
form D-6-phosphogluconate and NADPH. The rate of NADPH formation, determined by
measuring the increase in absorbance photometrically, is directly proportional to catalytic CK
activity.
Human CK-MB is composed of two subunits, CK-M and CK-B which both have an active
site. With the aid of specific antibodies to CK-M, the catalytic activity of CK-M subunits in
the sample is inhibited to 99.6 % without affecting the CK-B subunits. The remaining CK-B
activity, corresponding to half the CK-MB activity, is determined by the total CK method. As
the CK-BB isoenzyme only rarely appears in serum and the catalytic activity of the CK-M
and CK-B subunits hardly differ, the catalytic activity of the CK-MB isoenzyme can be
calculated from the measured CK-B activity by multiplying the result by 2.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision experiments were performed in accordance with the CLSI Guideline EP5-
A3. Five serum samples and 2 control levels were tested using 2 aliquots per run and
2 runs per day for > 21 days on the same cobas c 501 analyzer using 3 reagent lots.
Repeatability (within run precision) and intermediate precision (within lab/within
device precision incorporating run-to-run and day-to-day precision) were calculated.
Precision results for the combined lots are shown below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was conducted according to CLSI guideline EP6-A. A dilution
series was prepared using human sample pools (one serum pool and one plasma pool)
with CK-MB concentrations to cover the claimed measuring range. The ranges tested
were 0.4 to 2203.6 U/L for serum and 0.7 to 2709.3 U/L for plasma. Dilutions were
made using 0.9% NaCl. The dilution series contains 16 concentrations for serum and
18 concentrations for plasma. Samples were measured in triplicate on a cobas c 501
analyzer and data analysis was done separately for each sample. An assessment of
linearity was performed using polynomial regression analysis for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd
order polynomials. The Creatine Kinase-MB test results were plotted against the
expected concentrations. Analysis of the regression coefficients (using a significance
level of 5%) showed that the nonlinear coefficients in both the second and third order
were significant. The 3rd order was determined to have the best fit (smaller RootMSE)
and was used for the calculation of deviation from linearity. The deviation from
linearity met the pre-defined acceptance criterion and was within 7%.
The claimed measuring range for CK-MB is 10 to 2000 U/L for serum and plasma.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: This method has been standardized against the IFCC Method for
Creatine Kinase with addition of antibodies.
Stability: The reagent shelf life stability claim is 12 months at 2-8°C. The reagent
onboard (in use and refrigerated) stability claim is 8 weeks. The protocols were
reviewed and found acceptable.
Calibrator: The calibrator used with the CK-MB assay is the previously cleared
Roche Diagnostics Calibrator for Automated Systems (k101456).

d. Detection limit:
Limits of detection studies followed the guidelines in CLSI EP17-A2.
The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined as the 95th percentile of measurements of
blank samples. The LoB calculation was performed with one analyte-free sample
measured in 10 replicates with 3 reagent lots over 6 runs, 3 days, and on one cobas c
501 analyzer. In total, 60 measurements were obtained per lot. Data analysis is based
on determination of the 95th percentile of the 60 measured values.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was defined as the lowest amount of analyte in a
sample detected with a 95% probability. For determination of LoD, five human
serum samples with low analyte concentrations (approximately up to 4 times the LoB)
were run in duplicate with 3 reagent lots over 6 runs, 3 days, and on one cobas c 501
analyzer. In total, 60 measurements were obtained per lot. LoD was determined
using the following equation: LoD = LoB + 1.653 × SD
tot.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) is defined as the lowest analyte concentration that
can be quantified with a %CV of no more than 20%. For determination of LoQ, a
low level sample set was prepared by diluting 5 human serum samples with an
analyte free diluent (0.9% NaCl). The low level sample set was tested in 5
replicates per sample on 5 days, one run per day on one cobas c 501 analyzer.
The results of the evaluation of the detection limits for one representative reagent lot
and the final claim are in the table below.
Reagent Lot 2 (U/L) Claim (U/L)
Limit of Blank 0.3 3
Limit of Detection 1.0 3
Limit of Quantitation 1.9 10
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous interference:
The effects of interference by hemoglobin, lipemia (Intralipid), and bilirubin on the
CK-MB test system was determined on the cobas c 501 analyzer using pooled human
serum samples with 2 CK-MB levels (Level 1: ~18 U/L, Level 2: ~1180 U/L) and
spiked with varying levels of interferent. The resulting sample series (10 interferent
levels per sample) were tested in triplicate and the mean values were used to calculate
% recovery, by comparing the measured concentration to the expected concentration
(i.e. CK-MB concentration when no interferent is added). A compound was
identified as an interferent if the difference between the spiked test sample and the
reference sample was >10%. The results are shown in the table below.

Hemolysis interferes with the assay. The labeling states; Do not use hemolyzed
samples.
Exogenous Interference:
Two serum sample pools containing 2 levels of CK-MB (Level 1: ~22 U/L, Level 2:
~1065 U/L) were divided into aliquots. The concentration of an unspiked aliquot,
used as a reference sample, was determined in triplicate on a cobas c501 analyzer.
The other sample aliquots were spiked with the respective amount of drug and their
CK-MB concentrations determined in triplicate. The means of the triplicate
determinations for spiked samples and the reference were compared. A drug was
identified as an interferent if the difference between the spiked test sample and the
reference sample was >10%.
No interference was observed in the presence of Acetylcysteine (1660 mg/L),
Ampicillin-Na (1000 mg/L), Ascorbic acid (300 mg/L), Cyclosporine (5 mg/L),
Heparin (5000 U), Levodopa (20 mg/L), Methyldopa +1.5 (20 mg/L), Metronidazole
(200 mg/L), Phenylbutazone (400 mg/L), Doxycycline (50 mg/L), Acetylsalicylic
Acid (1000 mg/L), Rifampicin (60 mg/L), Acetaminophen (200 mg/L), Ibuprofen (500
mg/L), and Theophyllin (100 mg/L).
The labeling states that no interference was found at therapeutic concentrations using
common drug panels.
Interference was observed with Cefoxitin and Cyanokit. The labeling states that Cyanokit
(Hydroxocobalamin) and Cefoxitin at therapeutic concentrations interfere with the test.

A total of 105 human serum samples with values ranging from 10.1 to 1939 U/L were
tested in singlicate with the CK-MB assay on a Roche cobas c 501 analyzer and the
predicate device. Four of the 105 samples were spiked with recombinant human CK-

A matrix comparison study was performed by comparing reference serum samples (in
serum tubes) with 31 serum samples (in gel separation tubes) or plasma samples (in
30 K2 EDTA tubes, 31 K3 EDTA tubes, or 31 Li Heparin tubes). Samples ranging
from 10.1 to 1956 U/L were tested in singlicate on the cobas c 501 analyzer.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
For healthy people, according to Klein et al.1 and consensus values2: CK-MB < 25 U/L.
The reagents used in the reference interval studies in Klein, et al., are identical to the
proposed device. Reference intervals for CK-MB were performed at 6 sites with healthy
individuals (202 males and 217 females ranging in age from 20-60 years). Reference
intervals were reported as follows: CK-MB (2.5-97.5%) of 8-24 U/L for males and CK-
MB (2.5-97.5%) of 6-25 U/L for females.
The labeling states:
Reference intervals strongly depend on the patient group regarded and the specific
clinical situation. Each laboratory should investigate the transferability of the expected
values to its own patient population and if necessary, determine its own reference ranges.
