L. Test Principle:
1. INNOVANCE® Heparin Assay
Upon mixing of INNOVANCE Heparin Reagent and INNOVANCE Heparin Substrate,
FXa converts the chromogenic substrate into two products, one of them is
paranitroaniline. The formation of paranitroaniline can be quantified by the coagulation
analyzer employing light absorption at a specific wavelength (405 nm). In the presence of
a heparin containing sample the formation of paranitroaniline will be reduced in a time
dependent manner. This is due to inhibition of FXa by the heparin/antithrombin (AT)
complex. This complex is formed in the patient’s plasma and competes with the substrate
conversion by FXa. The concentration of the complex is not only dependent on the
concentration of heparin but also on the availability of the patient’s endogenous
antithrombin. By comparison to a reference curve the heparin activity of the sample can be
quantified. To reduce the influence from heparin antagonists, such as platelet factor 4
(PF4), dextran sulfate is included in the reaction mixture.
2. INNOVANCE® Heparin Calibrator
The calibrator levels are used to establish a reference curve (calibration curve) which then
can be employed to quantify the heparin activity of UFH and LMWH containing plasmas.
3. INNOVANCE® Heparin UF and LMW Controls
Recovery of these controls within their assigned ranges indicates proper functionality of
the assay system.

ii. INNOVANCE Heparin Calibrator
Repeatability
An internal single-site precision study was conducted on three INNOVANCE Heparin
Calibrator levels (Calibrators 2, 3 and 4) using a single instrument (BCS XP) with
three operators. Testing was performed with two runs per day and two replicates per
run for 20 days following the CLSI EP05-A2 guideline for the study and data analysis.
The data for within-run, between-run, between-lot, between-day, and total precision of
each level of calibrator were calculated for all three operators combined and the results
met the pre-defined acceptance criteria. The repeatability of Calibrator 1 and 5 were
not performed as their values are outside of the assay measuring range (0.10 – 1.50
IU/mL).
Reproducibility
The reproducibility study was conducted at three separate internal sites on the BCS XP
analyzers with three INNOVANCE Heparin Calibrator levels (Calibrators 2, 3 and 4)
for five days with two runs per day and four replicates per run. The data for within-
run, between-run, between-lot, between-day, and total precision of each calibrator
level were calculated following the CLSI EP05-A2 guideline for all three sites
combined and the results met the pre-defined acceptance criteria. The reproducibility
of Calibrator 1 and 5 were not performed as their values are outside of the assay
measuring range (0.10 – 1.50 IU/mL).
iii. INNOVANCE Heparin UF and LMW Controls
Repeatability
A single-site precision study was conducted with three lots of INNOVANCE Heparin
Control (LMWH and UFH) on a single BCS XP analyzer at Siemens with three
operators. Testing was performed with two runs per day and two replicates per run for
20 days for each level of each control (LMWH level 1 and 2; UFH level 1 and 2)
following the CLSI EP05-A2 guideline for the study and data analysis. The data of
within-run, between-run, between-lot, between-day, and total precision of each level
of calibrator were calculated for all three operators combined and and the results met
the pre-defined acceptance criteria.
Reproducibility
The reproducibility study was conducted at three internal sites on the BCS XP
analyzer with four INNOVANCE Heparin Control (LMWH level 1 and 2; UFH level
1 and 2) for 20 days with two runs per day and two replicates per run. The data of
within-run, between-run, between-lot, between-day, and total precision of each
calibrator were calculated following the CLSI EP05-A2 guideline for all three sites

combined and the results met the pre-defined acceptance criteria.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was conducted as described in CLSI EP06-A “Evaluation of the
Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach.” Three
lots of the assay reagent were tested on BCS XP analyzers. Human plasma samples
spiked with an increased concentration (0.00–1.90 IU/mL) of the international UFH
and LMWH standard were used to assess linearity of the assay. The tests were
performed in four replicates at each dilution level of both UFH and LMWH using the
INNOVANCE Heparin assay on two BCS XP coagulation analyzers. The measuring
range was established as 0.10‒1.5 IU/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i. INNOVANCE Heparin Calibrator
Traceability:
The INNOVANCE Heparin Calibrator consists of five calibrator levels and the
heparin activity was defined with LMWH, which was calibrated against the WHO
International Standard for UFH (NIBSC code 07/328)and LMWH (NIBSC code
05/112). INNOVANCE Heparin Calibrator 1 is plasma without heparin.
INNOVANCE Heparin Calibrators 2–5 are plasmas with a heparin concentration
of 0.3–1.8 IU/mL.
Value Assignment:
Heparin activities of the calibration plasmas spiked with the International Standard
for UFH and the International Standard for LMWH were determined using the
INNOVANCE Heparin Assay on the BCS XP instrument and the reference

Assay were determined using one BCS XP analyzer with two lots of reagents and
substrates according to CLSI EP17-A2. Two lots of INNOVANCE Heparin Calibrator
were used for assay calibration. Five independent blank samples (normal donor
plasmas containing no heparin) were used as true blank and tested for 3 days with four
replicates per day for LoB determination. To determine LoD, five independent low
level samples for each heparin type (normal donor plasmas spiked with 0.05 IU/mL of
the International Standards for UFH and LMWH) were used and tested with two lots
of reagents for three days with four replicates per day for LoD determination.

by following CLSI EP17-A2. Five independent low level samples for each heparin
type (normal donor plasmas spiked with 0.10 IU/mL of the International Standards for
UFH and LMWH) were tested with three lots of the INNOVANCE Heparin Assay
(containing INNOVANCE Heparin reagent and INNOVANCE Heparin substrate) on
two BCS XP analyzers and the samples were tested over 3 days with two replicates per
BCS XP analyzer, per day and per lot of the INNOVANCE Heparin Assay. The final
results of LoB, LoD and LoQ are summarized below.

LoB LoD LoQ
< 0.10 IU/mL ≤ 0.10 IU/mL ≤ 0.10 IU/mL
e. Analytical specificity:
The study was conducted internally according to CLSI EP07-A2. A total of 12 plasma
samples spiked with various levels of UFH and LMWH to cover the AMR (0.10–1.50
IU/mL) and MDPs for UFH (0.30 IU/mL and 0.70 IU/mL for UFH) and LMWH (0.40
IU/mL, 0.60 IU/mL and 1.00 IU/mL). Five test samples with increased interference
substance concentration were prepared for each heparin concentration level. Each
sample was tested in four replicates on the BCS XP analyzer using one lot of
INNOVANCE Heparin reagents and one lot of INNOVANCE Heparin Calibrator. A
total of 240 measurements (12 samples x 5 interference substances x 4 replicates) were
performed for each interferent. The analytical specificity for each interferent was
determined to be the highest concentration of interferent in which the UFH and
LMWH results were not affected.
The common endogenous and exogenous interfering substances and their interference
results are listed below and showed no significant interference up to the indicated
concentration for all samples tested. Additional interference studies for anticoagulation
medications were also performed.
