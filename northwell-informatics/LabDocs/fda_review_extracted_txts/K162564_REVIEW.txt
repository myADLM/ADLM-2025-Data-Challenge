L. Test Principle:
The Medisign GH81, GH82, GH83, GH81 BT, GH82 BT and GH83 BT Blood Glucose
Monitoring Systems quantitatively measure the glucose in a whole blood sample by detecting
electrical current that results from a chemical reaction of glucose in the blood with the Flavin
adenine dinucleotide-Glucose dehydrogenase enzyme (FAD-GDH) on the test strip. The
electrical current is proportionally to the amount of glucose in the blood sample; it is
measured by the meter and is converted to a blood glucose value for display to the user.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The six systems in this submission are identical except for the presence or absence of blue
tooth functionality, case color and name; therefore, performance data provided in this section
is applicable to all six systems.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision (repeatability) was assessed using venous blood from one donor
adjusted with glucose to 5 glucose levels: 30-50 mg/dL, 51-110 mg/dL, 111-150
mg/dL, 151-250 mg/dL, and 251-400 mg/dL. These samples were tested using three
lots of test strips and 10 meters. Each sample was tested in 10 replicates per meter
and per strip lot, giving a total of 100 measurements/lot (n=100) and 300
measurements per glucose level. Results are summarized below:

3 100 332 7.2 2.2
Intermediate precision:
Intermediate (between day) precision was evaluated using 3 lots of test strips and 10
meters. Glucose control solutions in three concentration ranges were used (60-80
mg/dL, 96-114 mg/dL and 280-420 mg/dL). Each sample was tested over 10 days
with each meter, for each test strip lot, resulting in a total of 100 measurements per lot
and 300 measurements per glucose level. Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed using venous whole blood adjusted to 9 different
glucose concentrations ranging from 18-610 mg/dL (18, 42, 65, 103, 147, 205, 359,
512, and 603 mg/dL). Each concentration was tested in 20 replicates using the
candidate meter and the values compared to measurements made with a laboratory
method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The evaluation yielded the following regression
equation:
y = 1.0079x + 4.3865, R2 = 0.9979
The results of the study support the claimed glucose measurement range of 20 to 600
mg/dL. If a sample result is less than 20 mg/dL the result is flagged by the meter as
“LO” and if a sample result exceeds 600 mg/dL the result is flagged by the meter as
“HI”. The LO and HI features were tested and were demonstrated to function as
intended.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The systems are traceable to NIST standard reference material 917c, dry D-Glucose
(Dextrose).
Test strips stability:
The test strips are available in vials and individually wrapped in foil.
Test strip vial stability was assessed in accelerated and real-time studies. The testing
protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The
manufacturer claims vial shelf life stability of 26 months and open-vial stability of 3
months when stored at 39.2 to 86°F (4-30°C) and relative humidity (RH) of 10-90%.

Closed vial stability and aluminum foil pack:
Test strip shelf-life stability for the individually wrapped test strips was assessed in
accelerated and real-time studies. The testing protocols and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims shelf life stability of
26 months for the individually wrapped strips when stored at 39.2 to 86°F (4-30°C)
and 10-90% RH.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20-600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity study
(M.1.b above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed to assess 26 endogenous and exogenous
substances. Blood samples were spiked to obtain two levels of glucose
concentrations: level 1 (50-100 mg/dL) and level 2 (250-350 mg/dL). Samples were
tested in 10 replicates on each of 3 strip lots and compared to an established
laboratory method (YSI 2300 glucose analyzer).
The substances tested and the highest concentration tested with no significant
interference are summarized in the below table:

gout or kidney disease (>10 mg/dL uric acid) then your blood glucose results may be
inaccurate. If you are unsure, then ask your doctor.
If you are taking acetaminophen containing drugs (e.g. Tylenol, certain cold and flu
remedies etc.) in excess of the recommended levels (>20 mg/dL) then you may get
inaccurate results with this system. If you are unsure, then ask your doctor.
If you are taking vitamin C (ascorbic acid) in excess of the recommended levels >3
mg/dL, then your glucose results may be inaccurate with this system. If you are unsure,
then ask your doctor.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To assess the performance of the Medisign GH81 BT Blood Glucose Monitoring
System (representative of all six candidate test systems) in the hands of the intended
users, a study was performed at one clinical site using three test strip lots with 159
untrained lay user participants that obtained their own fingerstick sample and 102
participants that obtained their own palm and forearm samples. Each subject
performed testing on their own sample and results were compared to those obtained
by a health care professional on the YSI 2300. The range of glucose values for the
samples as measured by YSI was 38 to 357 mg/dL. The results relative to the YSI are
summarized below:

O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes _____ X ___ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes __ X_____ or No ________
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____ X ____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip,
palm, and forearm which are applied directly to the test strip by capillary action as they
are collected.
5. Calibration:
The meter does not require calibration or coding by the user. The labeling includes
instructions for the user to verify that the code number on the test strip vial matches the code
number displayed on the meter once the test strip is inserted.
6. Quality Control:
Two levels of controls are available for use with this meter. The control solutions are
purchased separately using the contact information provided in the labeling. The labeling
includes instructions for the user to ‘press the ‘<’ or ‘>’ button on the meter to mark the
result as a control solution result to distinguish them from blood glucose results in the
14

--- Page 15 ---
meter memory. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial
label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these
ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Sample volume study:
The sponsor performed a study to verify the test strip sample volume requirement for the
Medisign GH81 BT Blood Glucose Monitoring System (representative of the six
candidate test systems). Blood samples were testes at 5 sample volumes: 0.3, 0.4, 0.5,
0.6, and 0.7 µl. and values obtained were compared to YSI values. Results support the
claimed sample volume of 0.5 µL. Er4 was validated for “not enough blood sample” and
was demonstrated to function as intended.
2. Altitude Study:
To evaluate the effects of altitude on the Medisign GH81 BT Blood Glucose Monitoring
System (representative of the six candidate test systems), venous blood samples were
altered to 5 glucose concentrations intervals (81-83, 121-124, 245-251, 376-380, and
488-493 mg/dL) and tested at conditions to simulate 11,480 feet above sea level. Results
obtained were compared with those obtained with the comparator method (YSI). The
results demonstrate acceptable bias to the reference to support the claims in the labeling
at altitudes up to 11,480 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements
3. Hematocrit Study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels on the Medisign GH81 BT Blood Glucose
Monitoring System (representative of the six candidate test systems) was evaluated using
venous whole blood samples with hematocrit levels of 19-61% (19, 30, 42, 50, 61%) at 3
concentrations of glucose (40 mg/dL, 120 mg/dL, and 350 mg/dL). Three test strips lots
were evaluated with 10 meters. Each sample was tested in 10 replicates for each
hematocrit level and glucose levels. Results of samples at each hematocrit level were
compared to samples with the same concentration at 42% hematocrit as well as to the
corresponding YSI value. The % bias of the Medisign GH81 BT Blood Glucose meter
results relative to YSI demonstrated adequate performance to support the claimed
hematocrit range of 20-60%.
4. Test System Operating Conditions:
Operating conditions studies were performed using a single test strip lot and three meters,
with venous blood altered to glucose concentrations of 41 mg/dL, 123 mg/dL and 345
mg/dL. Testing with the Medisign GH81 BT Blood Glucose Monitoring System
(representative of the six candidate test systems) was performed at the combination of
extremes of claimed temperature and humidity operating conditions and results compared
15

--- Page 16 ---
to an established laboratory method (YSI). Results support the claims in the labeling that
the test system can be used at temperatures from 50° to 104°F (10-40°C) and relative
humidities of 10-90%.
5. EMC Testing:
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing
(EMC) had been performed and the device system was found compliant.
6. Infection Control Studies:
The six systems in this submission are identical except for the presence or absence of
blue tooth functionality, case color and name; therefore, infection control studies is
applicable to non-BT meters Medisign GH81, Medisign GH82 and Medisign GH83
glucose meters.
The device system is intended for single-patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed on the materials comprising the Medisign GH81 BT, Medisign GH82 BT and
Medisign GH83 BT glucose meters by an outside commercial testing laboratory
demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen
disinfectant, CaviWipes® disinfecting towelettes (EPA registration #46781-8).
Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no
change in performance or external materials of the meters after 11,000 cleaning and
11,000 disinfection cycles. The robustness studies support 3 years of single-patient use
and multi-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated
cleaning and disinfection procedures.
7. This device was cleared after the FDA issued final guidance documents for prescription
use blood glucose monitoring systems (BGMS) and over-the-counter use blood glucose
monitoring systems (SMBG). However, the recommendations in the guidance documents
were not followed for this device since the submission was received prior to the
finalization of the guidance documents.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
