L. Test Principle:
Incubation of sample, a biotinylated monoclonal TSH-specific antibody and a monoclonal
TSH-specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium complex react to form a sandwich complex
(first incubation). After streptavidin-coated magnetic microparticles are added to the incubate
the sandwich complexes are bound in the second incubation step to the solid phase via
interaction of biotin and streptavidin.
The reaction mixture is then aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are
magnetically captured on the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are removed by
washing with ProCell II M. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces
chemiluminescent emission which is measured and amplified by a photomultiplier .
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the Elecsys TSH assay was evaluated on cobas e801 immunoassay
analyzer according to CLSI document EP5-A3. Three serum based controls and 11
levels of serum samples (Serum 1 to 5 and 11 were pooled samples, serum 6-10 were
spiked pooled samples). The samples were tested in duplicate, twice per day for 21
days (N=84). Results are summarized in the tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity of the Elecsys TSH assay was assessed on the cobas e 801 Immunoassay
Analyzer using 3 different lot reagents according to CLSI EP6-A. A high serum
sample was serially diluted into 10 concentrations with the TSH specimen diluent
(Diluent MultiAssay) to obtain a total of 12 TSH samples (0.00, 0.004, 0.203, 0.678,
2.03, 5.09, 10.2, 25.4, 33.9 50.9, 72.7, 102 μIU/mL) ranging from 0-102 μIU/mL
throughout the measuring range. All 12 samples were assayed in triplicate. The
results from 3 lots of reagent yielded similar results. One representative lot is
summarized in the table below.
The measured values were plotted against the target values and the regression results
support the sponsor’s claim.

The Roche Elecsys TSH CalSet (cleared under k060754) is the recommended
calibrator to be used with the Elecsys TSH assay.
Reagent Stability:
The sponsor provided new real time stability study protocol and acceptance criteria,
and these were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The reagent is stable when
stored unopened at +2°C to +8°C or onboard (5-10°C) for 16 weeks.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) of the Elecsys TSH assay on the cobas e 801 Immunoassay
Analyzer was determined according to CLSI EP17-A2 as the 95th percentile of
measurements of blank samples on the cobas e 801 analyzer. One blank serum sample
with no detectable levels of TSH were assayed per day, 10 replicates per run, using
three lots of reagent over six days for a total of 60 replicates. The LoB was calculated
to be 0.0025 μIU/mL.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the Elecsys TSH assay was determined as
recommended in CLSI EP17-A2 by using five low-level TSH native serum samples
(0.000967- 0.00112 μIU/mL). All samples were assayed in duplicate, one run per day
over six days, for a total of 20 runs using three lots of reagents (n=60) on the cobas e
801 instrument. The LoD was calculated to be 0.005 μIU/mL using the following
equation: LoD = LoB + 1.653 SD.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined using functional sensitivity for five
low-level native TSH serum samples (0.0078 to 0.064μIU/mL). All samples were
assayed in five replicates , one run per day, for over five days, on the cobas e 801
instrument, using three reagent lots (n=75). Functional sensitivity was based on the
within lab precision of 20% CV and was determined to be 0.005 μIU/mL.
The results of the detection limits are summarized in the table below:
LoB LoD LoQ
0.0025 μIU/mL 0.005 μIU/mL 0.005 μIU/mL
This study supports the claimed assay measuring range of 0.005 to 100 μIU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was conducted to evaluate the effect of endogenous interfering
substances using the Elecsys TSH on the cobas e 801 Immunoassay analyzer. Three
serum samples containing low (pooled sera), medium (pooled spiked sera), and high
(pooled spiked sera) concentrations of TSH were tested.

The spiked sample (interference pool) was then diluted in 10% increments. The recovery
was determined by testing a control sample without the interferent and comparing it to
the value obtained from a test sample in which the potential interferent had been added.
The sponsor defined significant interference as follows:
Sample with concentration of 0.005 to 0.2 μIU/mL: > ± 0.02 μIU/mL
Sample with concentration of > 0.2 to 100 μIU/mL: > ± 10%
No significant interference was observed for the substances and concentrations listed

In addition, the sponsor states the following in the limitation section in the package
insert:
“Samples should not be taken from patients receiving therapy with high biotin doses
(i.e. >5 mg/day) until at least 8 hours following the last biotin administration.”
Drug interference:
The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of drugs was determined by
comparing values obtained from samples spiked with 29 pharmaceutical compounds
spiked into two human serum samples (pooled serum samples, native) and tested on
the Elecsys TSH assay on the cobas e 801 Immunoassay Analyzer. The analyte
concentrations of the samples were approximately 0.3 and 8 μIU/mL. The sponsor
defined non-significant interference as recovery within ±10%.

A cross-reactivity study was conducted according to CLSI-EP7-A2 to evaluate the
potential cross-reactivity of the assay. The potential cross-reactants were added at
defined concentrations to native human sera with approximate concentrations of 0,
12.5, 25, 50 and 100 μIU/mL and analyzed with Elecsys TSH on the cobas e 801
analyzer. Results from these spiked serum samples were matched against the
unspiked references and the % cross-reactivity was calculated as follows:
% cross-reactivity = (mean concentration of spiked sample – mean concentration of
unspiked sample/spiked concentration) x 100
The following cross-reactivities were found, tested with TSH concentrations of 0.3
μIU/mL and 8 μIU/mL.

the measuring range. There was no high dose effect observed at TSH concentrations
equal or higher than (>) 1,000 μIU/mL.

analyzer (predicate) and the cobas e 801 analyzer. A total of 130 samples were
measures with the Elecsys TSH immunoassay on the analyzer in singlicate covering
the mearing range; mean values ranged from 0.009-92.6 μIU/mL. Two out of 130

These values correspond to the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of results obtained from a total
of 516 healthy test subjects examined. Each laboratory should investigate the
transferability of the expected values to its own patient population and if necessary
determine its own reference ranges.

N. Instrument Name:
Cobas e801 Chemistry Analyzer
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes ___x_____ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ________ or No ___x_____
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___x_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Barcode
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Input and transport of samples using universal sample racks, modular sample buffer
input, core/transportation unit and STAT port.
5. Calibration:
It is recommended to perform calibration once per reagent lot using fresh reagent (i.e.
not more than 24 hours since the cobas e pack was registered on the analyzer). Renewed
calibration is recommended after 12 weeks when using the same reagent lot, after 28 days
when using the same cobas e pack on the analyzer and as required: e.g. quality control
findings outside the defined limits.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor recommends running various concentrations of controls at least once every
24 hours when the test is in use, once per cobas e pack. Values obtained should fall

within the defined limits. Each laboratory should establish corrective measures to be
taken if values fall outside the defined limits.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
The software documentations were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The firm provided
documentation to support the devices was designed, developed and is under good software
lifecycle processes.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
