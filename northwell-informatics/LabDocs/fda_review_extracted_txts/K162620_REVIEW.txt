H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Remel Spectra ESBL is a selective and differential growth medium for use in primary
isolation and presumptive identification of Extended Spectrum b Lactamase (ESBL)-
producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca and Proteus
mirabilis to aid in prevention and control of these bacteria in a healthcare setting. Testing
may be performed from either perirectal swabs or fresh stool specimens. Remel Spectra
ESBL is not intended to diagnose ESBL infection, or to guide or monitor treatment.
Do not report Spectra ESBL positive screening results. Subculture of presumptive
positive colonies to non-selective medium (e.g., Tryptic Soy Agar with 5% sheep blood)
is required for organism identification, confirmatory testing for ESBL, susceptibility
testing and epidemiological typing.
A lack of growth or the absence of pink, blue-turquoise-green or tan colonies on Spectra
ESBL does not preclude the presence of ESBL producing organisms.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
Do not report positive screening results obtained on Spectra ESBL.Subculture is required
for organism identification and ESBL confirmatory testing.
Colony color on Remel Spectra ESBL should not be used as a basis for organism
identification. Colony color may vary based on the species, strain of organism, specimen,
matrix and density of inoculum. While Spectra ESBL is a screening medium for ESBL-
producing E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca and P. mirabilis, other Enterobacteriaceae
that do not have CLSI interpretive screening guidelines for ESBL production may also
grow on Spectra ESBL. It is important to subculture isolated pink, blue-turquoise-green
or tan colonies from Spectra ESBL to non-selective medium to confirm identity,
susceptibility and ESBL phenotype when screening for ESBL-producing
microorganisms.
Areas of heavy stool inoculum in the 1st or 2nd quadrants may cause ESBL producing
strains of the targeted species to produce colony colors other than those expected. Only
sample well isolated pink, blue-turquoise-green or tan colonies from the 3rd or 4th
quadrants.
A lack of growth or the absence of pink, blue-turquoise-green or tan colonies on Spectra

--- Page 3 ---
ESBL does not preclude the presence of ESBL-producing organisms. False negative
results may occur due to variations in sampling, slow development or failure to develop
the expected colony color, or the presence of organisms that are susceptible to the
antimicrobial agents included in the Spectra ESBL medium.
When present at high concentration, some non-ESBL producing species may produce
colonies that are consistent in appearance with those of ESBL-producing strains and
suppress growth of target organisms.
The performance of Spectra ESBL has been established with fresh stool specimens and
perirectal swabs only. Performance characteristics with rectal swabs or other specimens
have not been established.
4. Special instrument requirements:
None
I. Device Description:
Remel Spectra ESBL is a selective and differential culture medium that contains a
combination of antibacterial agents that suppress the growth of non-Extended Spectrum b-
Lactamase (non-ESBL) producing organisms and enable recovery of ESBL-producing strains
of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca and Proteus mirabilis from
stool and perirectal swab specimens. The medium contains peptones that supply amino acids
and essential nutrients to promote the growth of enteric Gram-negative organisms. Sodium
chloride is present as a source of electrolytes and to maintain osmotic equilibrium.
Metabolism of chromogenic substrates and other components of the medium enable visual
differentiation of colonies of target and non-target organisms.

L. Test Principle:
Remel Spectra ESBL contains a combination of antibacterial agents that inhibit non-ESBL
producing Enterbacteriaceae and suppress the growth of most organisms that carry AmpC b-
lactamases, as well as other non-ESBL producing flora. Peptones supply amino acids and
essential nutrients which promote the growth of enteric gram-negative bacteria. Sodium
chloride is a source of essential electrolytes and maintains osmotic equilibrium. A
chromogenic mixture enables differentiation of isolates that express galactosidase (turquoise-
green colonies) and/or glucuronidase (blue or pink colonies). Hydrolysis of tryptophan also
produces tan colonies with a brown halo.
Pink, blue-turquoise-green or tan colonies are presumptively positive for ESBL-producing E.
coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, or P. mirabilis. Subculture is required for organism
identification and ESBL confirmatory testing.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of Spectra ESBL was evaluated using a blinded nine member
panel of isolates comprised of seven ESBL producing strains of E. coli (3), Klebsiella
pneumoniae (3), and K. oxytoca (1) and one strain each of non-ESBL producing E.
coli and K. pneumoniae. Testing was performed by 2 operators at 3 sites on each of 5
days using two levels of each panel member (approximately 104 and 106 CFU/mL) (2
operators x 5 days x 3 sites x 9 panel members = 270 results per organism level). At
both target levels, there was 100% agreement with expected colony color for all the
ESBL-producing organisms (210/210) and there were no false positive results with
either of the non-ESBL-producing strains (0/60). The results of the study were
acceptable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Weekly Quality Control testing was performed at each of the sites that participated in
the Clinical Study described in Section M(3). The Quality Control strains used in the
study are shown in Table 1. During the course of the Clinical Study, each control
strain was tested a total of 50 times and there were no unexpected results (100%
agreement). These results are acceptable.

d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection
The Limit of Detection (LOD) of Spectra ESBL was determined by plating serial
dilutions of 11 confirmed ESBL-producing strains of bacteria that were prepared in
saline (100µL per plate). The LOD was also determined for a subset of strains
suspended in a liquefied stool matrix using an inoculum volume of 1mL per plate.
The results of both these studies are summarized in Table 2. The LOD in saline

2 Lowest concentration at which all 5 replicates yielded colonies of the expected color
Inclusivity
The ability of Spectra ESBL to support growth of ESBL producing organisms was
evaluated by testing a total of 48 confirmed ESBL-producing strains: E. coli (27), K.
pneumoniae (8), K. oxytoca (7) and P. mirabilis (6). All of the strains grew with the
expected colony color when diluted in saline and inoculated at a concentration of 103
CFU/plate.
e. Analytical specificity:
The analytical specificity of Spectra ESBL was evaluated by testing a panel of 61
confirmed non-ESBL producing strains of Enterobacteriaceae as well as 49 strains of
non-Enterobacteriaceae species at an inoculum concentration of 104CFU/plate. The
organisms tested are summarized in Tables 3 and 4.

Number of
Strains Tested

--- Page 10 ---
Seventeen of the 18 non-ESBL producing strains of Enterobacteriaceae that
produced pink/blue-turquoise-green/tan colonies on Spectra ESBL were non-
susceptible to ceftazidime and cefotaxime (1 strain of K. pneumoniae was susceptible
to both these antimicrobial agents). None of the non-Enterobacteriaceae tested
produced colonies that could be mistaken for potentially ESBL producing species.
The potential for non-ESBL producing strains of Enterobacteriaceae that are non-
susceptible to cephalosporins to be recovered on Spectra ESBL is noted as a
Limitation in the Package Insert. The device labeling also stipulates that positive
results on Spectra ESBL should not be reported and that subculture of presumptively
positive colonies is required for organism identification, confirmatory testing for
ESBL, susceptibility testing and epidemiological typing. The risks to patients from
false positive results with Spectra ESBL are therefore mitigated and the results of the
Analytical Specificity Study are acceptable.
e. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
g. Assay Interference
Interfering Microorganisms
A study was conducted to evaluate the ability of Spectra ESBL to recover target
organisms from mixtures of ESBL-producing and non-ESBL producing species.
Testing was performed by mixing target organisms at levels close the LOD of Spectra
ESBL with non-target organisms at 106 to 109 CFU/mL in saline. The results of the
Mixed Infection Study are summarized in Table 5.

The potential for high concentrations of non-ESBL producing organisms to produce
colonies that are consistent in appearance with those of ESBL-producing strains and
suppress growth of target organisms is noted as a Limitation in the device labeling.
The Spectra ESBL Intended Use and result interpretation chart also stipulate that
positive results should not be reported and that subculture of colonies is required for

Interfering Substances
A study was conducted to evaluate the performance of Spectra ESBL in the presence
of endogenous and exogenous substances that may be present in stool and/or
perirectal swab specimens. Twenty-one substances were tested in liquefied stool
matrix in the presence of 5 representative ESBL-producing organisms (E. coli (2), K.
pneumoniae (2) and P. mirabilis (1)). Semi-quantitative colony counts on Spectra
ESBL were compared in the presence and absence of each potential interfering
substance. The results are summarized in Table 6 and are acceptable.

Charcoal Containing Transport Media
A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of charcoal-containing transport
medium for perirectal swabs on the growth and colony color obtained on Spectra
ESBL. Isolated colonies of 6 ESBL producing strains (E. coli (3), K. pneumoniae (2)
and P. mirabilis (1)) were sampled using collection swabs that were then immersed in
charcoal-containing transport medium prior to inoculating Spectra ESBL. The
expected colony color was obtained with each ESBL-producing strain demonstrating

Not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
Refer to Section M(2)(g), above.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The performance of Spectra ESBL was evaluated in a prospective Clinical Study that
was conducted at 3 sites using either fresh (unpreserved) stool or perirectal swab
specimens that were collected from subjects at risk of colonization with ESBL-
producing organisms. Two of the clinical sites tested stool specimens and a third site
tested only perirectal swabs. To establish the presence or absence of ESBL positive
organisms of the targeted species, reference culture was performed at each of the sites
through inoculation of MacConkey agar plates with a 10µg cefpodoxime disk
between the 1st and 2nd quadrants, followed by identification by standard methods and
(as appropriate) ESBL confirmatory testing of colonies that grew in the zone of
inhibition according to the procedure described in CLSI M100.1 All specimens were
cultured within 24 hours of collection.
Spectra ESBL plates were read after 18 and 24 hours at 35±2°C and all colony types
recovered were identified and, as appropriate, underwent confirmatory testing of the
ESBL phenotype.
Specimens from a total of 1194 subjects were enrolled in the study (748 fresh stool
specimens and 446 perirectal swabs). Eighteen specimens were excluded from
analysis due to protocol deviations: 15 (8 stool and 7 perirectal swab) because they
were not plated within 24 hours of collection and 3 (all stool) because the isolates
recovered were not available for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility
testing. Isolates from a total 737 stool specimens and 439 perirectal swabs were
therefore included in the analysis of performance.
The results of the study are summarized in Tables 7 to 11. With perirectal swabs, the
performance of Spectra ESBL was the same when plates were read after 18 and 24
hours, with sensitivity and specificity values of 99.1% (95% confidence interval:

94.2-99.8%) and 89.7% (95% CI: 86.1-92.5%), respectively. For fresh stool
specimens, the sensitivity and specificity values after 18 hours of incubation were
97.8% (95% CI: 92.5-99.4%) and 89.6% (95% CI: 87.1-91.7%), respectively, while
after 24 hours the sensitivity was 98.9% (95% CI: 94.2-99.8%) and the specificity
was 88.1% (95% CI: 85.5-90.3%). For both specimen types combined, the sensitivity
and specificity were 98.5% (95% CI: 95.8-99.5%) and 89.6% (95% CI: 87.6-91.3%),
respectively, after 18 hours and 99.0% (95% CI: 96.5-99.7%) and 88.7% (95% CI:
86.6-90.4%), respectively, after 24 hours.

In addition to comparing the results obtained with Spectra ESBL to those of the
reference culture method, an additional analysis was performed to compare the
colony colors obtained on Spectra ESBL with the organism identity and confirmed
ESBL phenotype of the individual isolates recovered (Table 11). Colonies on Spectra
ESBL were subcultured to sheep blood agar, identified biochemically and, as

appropriate, underwent confirmatory ESBL testing according to CLSI M100. Of 308
isolates on Spectra ESBL that exhibited pink/blue-turquoise-green/tan colonies after
18 hours, 203 were confirmed as ESBL producing strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae,
K. oxytoca or P. mirabilis (Positive Predictive Value [PPV] = 65.9%). After 24 hours,
the PPV was 64.4% (206/320).
Because of the potential for false positive results with Spectra ESBL, the Intended
Use and result interpretation table in the device labeling indicate that positive results
should not be reported and that subculture is required for organism identification and
ESBL confirmatory testing.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
In the prospective Clinical Study described in Section M(3), above, the prevalence of
ESBL-producing E.coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca or P. mirabilis that was observed on
Spectra ESBL after 18h incubation was 23.0% (270/1176) compared with 23.9%
(281/1176) after incubation for 24h. As determined by the Reference Method after 18 and
24h incubation of the MacConkey plates, the prevalence was 15.0% (176/1176) and
15.3% (178/1176), respectively.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence determination.
