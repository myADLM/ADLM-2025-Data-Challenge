H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 is an in vitro immunochromatographic
assay for the qualitative detection of influenza A and B nucleoprotein antigens in
nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and nasal swab specimens. It is intended to aid in the rapid
differential diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections. Negative test results are
presumptive and should be confirmed by cell culture or an FDA-cleared influenza A and
B molecular assay. Negative test results do not preclude influenza viral infection and
should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 must be read by the Alere™ Reader.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2015-2016
influenza season when influenza A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 pandemic were the predominant
influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging,
performance characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture
should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and
culture specimens.
2. Indication(s) for use:
To aid in the differential diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections in patients with
signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:

I. Device Description:
The Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 is an immunochromatographic membrane
assay that detects influenza type A and B nucleoprotein antigens in respiratory specimens.
Influenza specific antibodies and a control antibody are immobilized onto a membrane
support as three distinct lines on the test strip. The test strip is mounted inside a cardboard,
book-shaped hinged test card. Swab specimens require a sample preparation step, in which
the sample is eluted off the swab into Elution Solution supplied with the kit in 0.5mL vials
(350 μl per vial). The sample is then added to the top of the test strip with a fixed volume
transfer pipette (100 μL) and the test card is closed. After 15 minutes, the card assay is
inserted into the AlereTM Reader for the interpretation of results.
The AlereTM Reader is a small bench top camera-based instrument to be used in conjunction
with the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 assay. The Reader analyzes the
intensity of the test and control lines and displays the results (positive, negative or invalid) on
a display screen. The screen is intended as a means of user interface informing the user how
to operate the Reader and to display test results. The Reader is supplied with a Calibration
Check Card. To ensure proper function, a calibration check is required to be performed at
least every 30 days. The calibration check verifies that the Reader’s internal camera is
functioning correctly and that the Reader is working to specification. Operator ID and subject
ID can be entered manually, through the touchscreen or via the provided barcode scanner.
Results are stored in memory, and can be printed, if desired, on an optional printer connected
via USB. In addition, patient test results can be uploaded to a compatible data management
system via Ethernet. If connected to a data management system, results are uploaded
automatically and are no longer available in memory.
The assay kit consists of 22 Test Cards (a cardboard, book-shaped hinged test card
containing the test strip), 25 fixed volume (100 μl) transfer pipettes, 22 Elution Solution
Vials, 22 nasal swabs, 1 Positive Control swab (inactivated influenza A and B viruses dried
onto the swab), and 1 Negative Control swab (inactivated Streptococcus Group A dried onto
the swab).
The kit may be stored at 2-30°C.

(issued on: July 15, 2011).
L. Test Principle:
The test is based on the antigen-antibody binding properties characteristic of immunoassays.
The Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 uses highly sensitive recombinant
antibodies (rFabs) that specifically recognize influenza A and influenza B nucleoprotein
antigens in respiratory specimens. A patient line (one for influenza A and one for influenza
B) is formed by adsorbing purified viral antigen specific BSA-fab conjugate proteins on the
test strip membrane. A control line is formed by adsorbing purified rabbit anti-mouse
antibodies onto the test strip membrane. As the patient sample travels across the test strip,
viral antigens, if present in the sample, react with the reagents on the membrane and are
detected by the AlereTM Reader.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
Analytical studies were conducted using pooled pre-screened negative nasal swab matrix
(unless stated otherwise). The sample diluent was tested in triplicate with the Alere
BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 assay prior to use in preparing dilutions. The
matrix was stored at 2-8°C for no more than 5 days.
The influenza virus strains used in the studies were purchased, then re-grown and re-
titered to concentrations expressed in TCID /mL. Each influenza virus strain was serially
50
diluted in the nasal swab matrix pool to generate the desired virus concentrations for
testing.

a. Analytical Sensitivity (Limit of Detection)
The limit of detection (LoD) of the assay was determined by evaluating different
concentrations of five (5) strains of influenza A and three (3) strains of influenza B virus
for swabs eluted in Elution Solution. The study was conducted using pooled, pre-
screened negative nasal swab matrix. Contrived nasal swab samples were prepared by
coating 10 μL of each virus dilution onto the swab. The contrived swab samples were
tested by elution in the elution solution according to the test procedure. The LoD for each
influenza strain tested was determined by testing 20 replicates of each dilution. The LoD
was defined as the concentration where at least 19 of the 20 replicates were positive for
the given virus. The confirmed LoDs in natural nasal swab matrix for swabs eluted in
Elution Solution for each influenza strain tested are presented in the table below:

b. Reproducibility
The reproducibility of the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 assay was
evaluated at three testing sites, with 6 operators (2 at each site), over five testing days,
using two lots of reagents and five Readers. One strain of influenza A (Influenza
A/California/7/2009) and one strain of influenza B (Influenza B/Nevada/03/2011), were
diluted in Viral Transport Media (VTM) to targeted concentrations: high negative (just
below the LoD), low positive (at the limit of detection), and moderate positive (3x LoD),
for a total of 7 test samples. Contrived nasal swab samples were prepared by coating
10 μL of each virus dilution onto the swab. Dried swabs were packaged and assembled
into blinded panels of 21 swabs. Each panel consisted of three swabs (individual
replicates) for each of the test samples. Each test operator was provided with a panel of
samples to be tested on each of the 5 days of testing. The swab samples were tested
according to the product instructions with results read by the Alere™ Reader. There were
six instances of invalid results, of which 5 were repeated and generated valid results.
There was one sample that generated Flu A and B positive results, which was considered
invalid and was not repeated.

Swab samples were prepared by inoculating the swab head with 10μl of Flu A, Flu B or
clinical matrix diluent sample (for negative samples).
The stability of the samples was evaluated both prior to and after processing with the
Elution Solution.
Dry Swab Stability
Flu A and Flu B positive and negative swab samples, not eluted before storage, were
tested at time=0 (soon after swab preparation) and at the following time points and
temperatures of storage prior to testing:
Room Temperature (15-30°C): 1 hr, 2 hrs, 5 hrs, 9 hrs
Refrigerator (2-8°C): 1 hr, 9 hrs, 17 hrs, 25 hrs, 37 hrs
Samples were tested with the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 in triplicate
according to the product instructions.
All swabs generated expected results (i.e., influenza A swabs tested positive for Flu A,
influenza B swabs tested positive for Flu B, and the negative swabs tested negative for
Flu A and Flu B). The results support the sample stability of up to 4 hours after collection
when stored at room temperature and up to 24 hours when stored in a refrigerator.
Swab Stability after Elution with the Elution Solution
Eluted samples were prepared by eluting swabs, prepared as above, in 350 μL of Elution
Solution. Flu A and Flu B positive and negative swab samples eluted in the Elution
Solution before storage were tested at time=0 and at the following time points when
stored in a refrigerator prior to testing:
Refrigerator (2-8°C) 1 hr, 17 hrs, 25 hrs, 37 hrs
Samples were tested with the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 in triplicate
according to the product instructions.
All swabs generated expected results (i.e., influenza A swabs tested positive for Flu A,
influenza B swabs tested positive for Flu B, and the negative swabs tested negative for

Flu A and Flu B). The results support the claim of stability up to 36 hours when samples
eluted in the Elution Solution are stored in a refrigerator at 2-8°C before testing.
e. Swab Type Validation
The sponsor evaluated the performance of the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card
2 test when using various swab types for collection of nasal specimens. The study was
conducted with swabs spiked with influenza A and influenza B viruses to approximately
2 times the established LoD. Clinical nasal matrix pool was used as a diluent. The
following influenza strains and concentrations were used in this study.

For this study, 10 μL of the prepared virus dilution was spiked into 100 μL of the clinical
matrix diluent. Positive swabs were prepared by dipping the swab into either the Flu A or
Flu B spiked solution and twirling the swab three times to coat it. Negative swabs were
prepared by dipping the swab into 110 μL of clinical matrix diluent and twirling the swab
three times to coat it. Samples were tested with the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B
Card 2 in 10 replicates according to the product instructions. The following swabs were
evaluated:
• Puritan PurFlock® Ultra flocked swab – standard tip
• Puritan PurFlock® Ultra flocked swab – mini tip
• Puritan PurFlock® Ultra flocked swab - large tip
• Puritan HydraFlock® flocked swab – standard tip
• Puritan Nasopharyngeal foam tipped swab
• Puritan Foam tipped swab, polystyrene handle
• Puritan Polyester tipped applicator, plastic handle
• Puritan Rayon tipped applicator, plastic handle
• Puritan Calcium Alginate tipped applicator
• Copan Regular flocked swab, plastic applicator, sterile, individually wrapped
100 mm
• Copan Polyester, regular tip, plastic handle
• Copan, Rayon, regular tip, plastic handle
The data showed that of the swabs tested, Puritan Calcium Alginate and PurFlock Ultra
Flocked Swab - large tip swabs are not appropriate for use with the Alere BinaxNOW®
Influenza A & B Card 2 test. The following statement is included in the Sample
Collection and Handling Section of the Product Insert: “Puritan PurFlock Ultra® Flocked

swabs – large tip and Puritan Calcium Alginate swabs are not suitable for use in this
assay.”
f. Assay Cutoff
The assay cutoff (threshold of detection) was determined based on testing of positive and
negative samples of varying concentrations using 858 test devices, for a total 1716 test
results [638 negative results (319 for Flu A and 319 for Flu B) and 1078 positive results
(598 positive for Flu A and 480 positive for Flu B)]. The Reader analyzes the pixel
intensity, and compares the pixel intensity of a “band” (i.e. Target Line), to its
surrounding areas. The optical reading is calculated as follows:
Optical Reading = [(Background Intensity – Band Intensity)] / Background Intensity
The Optical Readings were analyzed to determine, statistically, what threshold represents
a positive versus a negative result. The Mixed Effects Analysis of Variance method was
employed to estimate and test for differences between diluents and lines (on the device)
and also to estimate the standard deviation of the reading taking into account all known
sources of variation. The statistical analysis was applied to all the negative results (lines
with 0 signal) from:
a. 319 negative samples (2 lines with 0 signal per device, for a total of 638 results),
and
b. 539 positive samples (1 line with 0 signal per device, (240 negative results for Flu
A and 299 negative results for Flu B), for a total of 539 results).
The different sources of random variation considered included:
• Lot to lot differences
• Interaction between the Reader and diluent lots
• Differences between devices
• Differences with the devices (two lines on each device)
The cutoff was established based on the intensity of fluorescence of positive and negative
results using the full set of data (1716 results).
g. Analytical Reactivity (inclusivity)
An analytical reactivity (inclusivity) study was performed to determine whether the Alere
BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 is able to detect a variety of influenza A and B
strains that represent temporal and geographic diversity. Pre-screened negative natural
nasal swab specimens were eluted in 1 X PBS. Swab elutes were combined and mixed
thoroughly to create a clinical matrix pool to be used as the diluent. Each influenza virus
strain was diluted in this natural nasal swab matrix pool to generate virus dilutions for
testing. The vendor provided virus strains were re-titered and the concentrations (in
12

--- Page 13 ---
TCID /mL) were determined by standard virology methods.
50
Contrived swab samples were prepared by coating 10 μL of virus dilution onto each
swab. The contrived swab samples were tested in triplicate in serial dilution series until
the lowest concentration of each strain generated positive results in all three replicates.
The Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 assay detected all strains tested (3/3) at
the concentrations indicated in the table below.

Cross-Reactivity
To determine the analytical specificity of the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B
Card 2, 58 commensal and pathogenic microorganisms (41 bacteria, 16 viruses and one
yeast) that may be present in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx were tested. The bacteria
and yeast were re-grown and re-titered by the sponsor; the commercially obtained viruses
were tested based on the vendor reported concentrations. For each organism, 10 μL of the
stock was added to a vial containing 350 μL of Elution Solution and tested with the Alere
BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 assay in three replicates according to the test
procedure. For each organism, the highest concentration that yielded negative results in
all three replicates when tested with the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2, is

volumes using the original stock concentrations obtained from a commercial vendor. The
co-infection viruses were also applied onto clean (not coated with influenza viruses)
swabs as controls. Each swab was tested in triplicate according to the Alere BinaxNOW®
Influenza A & B Card 2 test procedure.
The following panel of non-influenza viruses was tested at the concentrations provided in
the table below.
Virus Panel Concentration (TCID /ml)
50
Adenovirus Type 1 1.58 x 107
Rhinovirus Type 1A 1.58 x 108
Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Type B, Strain 18537 8.89 x 105
All tests gave expected results, i.e., all swabs coated with influenza A virus tested
positive for Flu A, all swabs coated with influenza B tested positive for Flu B, and all
swabs coated only with the co-infection pathogens tested negative for Flu A and for
Flu B.
j. Co-infection with Influenza Viruses
A study was conducted to determine if the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2
test can detect weakly positive influenza A samples in the presence of concentrated
influenza B virus and weakly positive influenza B samples in the presence of
concentrated influenza A virus.
The weakly reactive (reference) swab samples were prepared using the influenza A and
influenza B strains diluted to approximately 2 times the pre-determined LoD with pooled
pre-screened clinical nasal matrix diluent. Swabs were prepared by coating 10 μL of the
virus dilution onto the swab.
The same influenza A and influenza B strains were also diluted in clinical matrix diluent
to 20 times (20X) the pre-determined LoD with pooled pre-screened clinical nasal matrix
diluent. To prepare the co-infection swabs, 10 μL of the 20X diluted influenza A strain
was added to the reference influenza B swabs prepared above. Similarly, 10 μL of the
20X diluted influenza B strain was added to the reference influenza A swabs prepared
above using the same method. The concentration of each influenza strain tested is
presented below.

The results of this study showed that the ability of the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A&B
Card 2 test to detect influenza A in weakly positive samples in the presence of high titers
of influenza B virus is not affected. Similarly, the ability of the device to detect influenza
B in weakly positive samples in the presence of high titers of influenza A virus is not
affected.
k. Controls
External Controls
One swab each, a low positive control for influenza A/B and a negative control, are
provided with each kit. The Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B External Controls are
designed for use with Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2. The Positive Control
swab is coated with inactivated Influenza A and B viruses dried onto a swab. The
Negative Control swab is coated with inactivated Streptococcus Group A dried onto a
swab. Additional controls (10 Positive and 10 Negative Control Swabs) are available as
an accessory to the kit.
Process Control (internal, on every test strip)
A built in assay control is present on every test strip (visible as a blue line on each unused
cartridge) and consists of purified rabbit anti-mouse antibodies. It serves to control for the
proper flow of reagents across the test strip.
2. Clinical study:
Clinical performance characteristics of the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2
were evaluated in a multi-site prospective study during the 2015-2016 flu season
(December 2015 to April 2016) in the U.S. A total of 12 investigational sites throughout
the U.S. participated in the study. To be enrolled in the study, patients had to be
presenting at the participating study centers with flu-like symptoms. Either two
nasopharyngeal swabs or two nasal swabs were collected from one nostril from each
patient with flu-like symptoms using standard collection methods. In each case, one of
the collected swabs was eluted in the Elution Solution and tested using the Alere
BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 at the study sites according to product instructions.

The other swab was eluted in 1 mL of Viral Transport Media (VTM) and shipped to a
central laboratory for testing with a FDA cleared influenza real-time Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-PCR) assay used as the comparator for this study.
A total of 645 Subjects were enrolled in the study. Of those, 60 swab samples did not
meet eligibility criteria due to protocol deviations (sample handling or storage errors or
subject withdrawal). A total of 585 nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens were
considered evaluable. Patient age and gender distribution for all the evaluable specimens
are shown below.

>60 years 25 12
Total 327 258
Among the 585 samples tested, 20 samples gave invalid results (these samples were not
re-tested), leaving 565 samples to be included in the calculations of assay performance.
The invalid rate observed was 3.4% (20/585) with the 95% confidence interval 2.2% -
5.2% (the invalid rate includes 19 results that were positive for both influenza A and B).
The clinical performance of the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 assay, as
compared to an FDA cleared molecular method for detection of influenza A and B, is
