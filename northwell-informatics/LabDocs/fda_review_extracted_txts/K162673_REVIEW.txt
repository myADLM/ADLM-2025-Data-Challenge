K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): Not Applicable
L. Test Principle:
The Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay involves three main steps, which all take place in a single tube
on the Panther system: target capture, target amplification by real time transcription-mediated
amplification (TMA), and detection of the amplification products (amplicons) by the
fluorescent labeled probes (torches). The assay incorporates an Internal Control (IC) in every
test to monitor targeted nucleic acid capture, amplification and detection.
Target capture:
When the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay is performed, the targeted viral mRNA and IC are
isolated using magnetic microparticles and target-specific capture oligomers, in a process
called target capture. The capture oligomers contain sequences complementary to specific
regions of the targeted RNA (HSV mRNA or IC) as well as a string of deoxyadenosine
residues. During the hybridization step, the sequence-specific regions of the capture
oligomers bind to specific regions of the RNA target molecules. The microparticles,
including the captured RNA target molecules bound to them, are pulled to the side of the
reaction tube using magnets and the supernatant is aspirated. The particles are washed to
remove residual specimen matrix that may contain amplification inhibitors. After target
capture steps are completed, the specimens are ready for amplification.
Target Amplification by TMA:
Target amplification occurs via TMA, which is a transcription-based nucleic acid
amplification method that utilizes two enzymes, MMLV (Moloney murine leukemia virus)
reverse transcriptase and T7 RNA polymerase. The reverse transcriptase is used to generate a
DNA copy (containing a promoter sequence for T7 RNA polymerase) of the target sequence.
T7 RNA polymerase produces multiple copies of RNA amplicon from the DNA copy
template.
Detection:
Detection is achieved using single-stranded nucleic acid torches that are present during the
amplification of the target and hybridize specifically to the amplicon in real time. Each torch
has a fluorophore and a quencher. The quencher suppresses the fluorescence of the
fluorophore as it is designed to be in close proximity when not hybridized to the amplicon.
When the torch binds to the amplicon, the quencher is moved farther away from the
fluorophore and it will emit a signal at a specific wavelength when excited by a light source.
More of the torches hybridize when more amplicon is present. The increase in fluorescent
signal from progressive amplification is detected by fluorometers within the Panther system.
The Panther system can detect and discriminate between the three fluorescent signals
corresponding to HSV-1, HSV-2 and IC amplification products. The fluorescence (measured
in relative fluorescence units [RFU]) is monitored over time to produce a real-time
fluorescence emergence curve for each reporter dye. The Panther system software compares
the fluorescence emergence curves to fixed cut off times to report results (TTime) for
HSV-1, HSV-2 and IC.

Test Interpretation:
Test results are automatically determined by the assay software. Results for HSV-1 and
HSV-2 detection are reported separately. Table 1 shows the possible results reported in a
valid run and result interpretations. Samples with invalid test results should be retested. The
first valid result should be reported.
Table 1: Test Results and Interpretation:
HSV-1 Result HSV-2 Result Interpretation
HSV1 neg HSV2 neg Negative: No HSV-1 or HSV-2 mRNA detected
HSV1 neg HSV2 POS HSV-2 positive: HSV-2 mRNA detected
HSV1 POS HSV2 neg HSV-1 positive: HSV-1 mRNA detected
HSV1 POS HSV2 POS HSV-1 and HSV-2 positive: HSV-1 and HSV-2 mRNA detected
Invalid Invalid Invalid: There was an error in the generation of the result. Specimen
should be retested.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Reproducibility:
Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay reproducibility was evaluated at three external US sites.
Testing was performed using three lots of assay reagents and six operators (two at
each site). At each site, testing was performed for at least six days where two
operators each performed two runs per day over at least three days with one operator
performing testing each day. Panel members were created by spiking HSV-1 and/or
HSV-2 viral particles into neat STM and three replicates of each panel member were
tested in each run. Final HSV-1 concentrations ranged from 0 TCID50/mL to 86.96
TCID50/mL and final HSV-2 concentrations ranged from 0 TCID50/mL to 1.63
TCID50/mL; agreement with expected results is presented in Table 2. Table 3
summarizes the TTime results for panel members containing low and moderate levels
of HSV-1 and HSV-2 and Table 4 summarizes the TTime results for the Positive
Control.

CV = coefficient of variation, SD = standard deviation
Note: Variability from some factors may be numerically negative. This can occur if the variability due to
those factors is very small. In these cases, SD and CV are shown as 0.
1Between Operators may be confounded with Between Days; therefore, Between Operators and Between
Days estimates are combined in Between Operators/Days.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Internal Control
The IC consists of a random sequence of RNA unrelated to HSV 1 or HSV 2 . The IC
is added to each specimen aliquot during sample preparation and is amplified in the
same reaction as the HSV-1 and HSV-2 mRNA targets. It is used to determine the
validity of each individual reaction and as an indicator of analyte capture,
amplification and/or detection errors, as well as to control for operator and instrument
errors.
External Assay Controls
Two controls are provided separately by Hologic to the user in the Aptima HSV
Controls Kit: one HSV1/HSV2 dual positive control and one negative control. The
positive control is composed of known concentrations of in vitro transcripts (IVT)
corresponding to HSV-1 and HSV-2 UL42 mRNAs. These controls must generate
results within predefined specifications to be valid. The negative control must also
provide a valid negative result for the run to be valid. Additionally, both controls
must generate IC results within predefined specifications.

The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay was determined by
testing a series of panels consisting of HSV-1 or HSV-2 diluted in pooled negative
clinical specimens collected in one of two transport media: 1) STM and 2) VTM. For
HSV-1, MacIntyre and HF viral strains were tested. For HSV-2, MS and G strains
were tested. At least 60 replicates were tested at each concentration for each panel
member for each matrix and virus strain across 3 reagents lots. The LoD for each
strain and specimen type was calculated using Probit analysis and summarized in
Table 5.

(ii) LoD Verification:
The LoD was verified using two clinical isolates of HSV-1 and two clinical isolates
of HSV-2 in both VTM and STM. Each HSV clinical isolate was tested with the
Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay using 60 replicates each at 3 concentrations (1X LoD, 3X
LoD, and 10X LoD, see Table 6 for LoD values). Testing was completed in both
STM and VTM matrix for all four clinical isolates and was conducted using 3 lots of
reagents. All replicates for all clinical isolates at all three concentrations tested were
detected by the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay, demonstrating that the assay can detect a
range of both HSV-1 and HSV-2 clinical isolates at the determined LoD.

evaluated in the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assays. Panel members were prepared by spiking
the potentially cross-reacting microorganisms into STM and then these panels were
divided into 3 groups: 1) unspiked, 2) HSV-1 spiked to a concentration of 3X LoD,
and 3) HSV-2 spiked to a concentration of 3X LoD. Group 1 was used to test for
cross-reactivity while Groups 2 and 3 were used to test for microbial interference. No
cross-reactivity or interference in the performance of the assay was observed in the
presence of the microorganisms tested.

f. Interfering Studies
The susceptibility of the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay to interference by elevated levels
of potentially interfering substances that may be present in clinical specimens was
evaluated. HSV negative samples and samples spiked to a test concentration of ~3X
LoD of HSV-1 Macintyre virus or HSV-2 MS virus were tested. No interference in
performance of the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay was observed in the presence of a
representative brand of the following exogenous and endogenous substances at the

g. Specimen Stability in Viral Transport Medium (VTM) and Aptima Specimen
Transport Medium (STM)
The specimen stability was assessed with naturally occurring positive clinical
specimens in both VTM (diluted in STM ) and neat STM that were placed at various
temperatures over a period of time (30°C for 30 days, 2-8°C for 30 days, -20°C for 60
days, and -70°C for 60 days) and subsequently tested with the Aptima HSV 1 & 2
assay.
In addition, each transport medium was spiked with HSV-1 MacIntyre strain and
HSV-2 MS strain at 3X and 10X LoD and tested, in duplicate, at the following
temperatures and intervals: 30°C for ≥ 30 days, 2-8°C for ≥ 30 days, -20°C for ≥ 30
days and -70°C for ≥ 30 days.
For the specimen freeze and thaw study, stability was assessed by alternately freezing
specimens at -20°C or -70°C and then thawing at room temperature for a total of 3
additional freeze-thaw cycles before being tested again in the Aptima HSV 1 & 2
assay in duplicate.
The study data support the stability claims for HSV-1 and HSV-2 specimens collected
in STM and stored at 2°C to 30°C for up to 36 days and at -20°C to -70°C for up to
36 days. The study data also support the stability claims for HSV-1 and HSV-2
13

specimens collected in VTM, immediately transferred to STM, and then stored at 2°C
to 30°C for up to 30 days and at -20°C to -70°C for up to 36 days. Specimens
collected directly in STM or collected in VTM and then immediately transferred to
STM may be frozen and thawed up to 3 times prior to testing.
h. Competitive Inhibition
Competitive inhibition was evaluated to assess the ability of the Aptima HSV 1 & 2
assay to detect HSV 1 and HSV 2 analytes when both are present in the same
specimen. Low and high titer concentrations of HSV-1 viral particles were tested in
combination with low, moderate, and high concentrations of HSV-2 virus. Panel
composition and concentrations are listed in Table 9. All testing resulted in 100%
detection for both HSV-1 and HSV-2.

The performance of the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay was compared with a composite
reference method: the ELVIS HSV ID and D3 Typing Test System (Diagnostic
Hybrids, Inc.; K091753), and a validated PCR/ bidirectional sequencing procedure. A
third FDA cleared assay was used when the ELVIS D3 culture and PCR/sequencing
results did not agree on the type of HSV detected or when PCR/sequencing detected
both HSV-1 and HSV-2.
Note: The ELVIS D3 culture method cannot detect type HSV-1 if the sample is
positive for HSV-2, thus, the method cannot detect HSV-1 and HSV-2 co-infected
samples.
Clinical Performance:
A prospective, multicenter clinical study was conducted to establish the performance
characteristics of the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay. A total of 544 evaluable subjects (195
males and 349 females) with active anogenital lesions were enrolled from 17 US
clinical sites, including family planning, dermatology, pediatrics/adolescent, sexually
transmitted infection, private practice, public health clinics, hospitals, universities,
and clinical research sites.
Two (2) swab specimens were collected from a single lesion from each subject: one
was collected with a swab from a commercially available VTM collection kit and one
was collected with a swab from the Aptima Multitest Swab Specimen Collection Kit
(STM). Specimens were processed in accordance with the appropriate package insert
instructions. Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay testing was performed at 3 external sites. The
performance of the Aptima HSV-1 & 2 assay was evaluated relative to the composite
reference method specified above. The performance of the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay
was estimated for detection of HSV-1 and HSV-2 separately using each specimen
type.
For HSV-1, of the 544 evaluable subjects, 528 VTM and 531 STM specimen types
resulted in evaluable results for HSV-1 analysis (16 VTM and 13 STM were reported
as unknown composite reference interpretation).For HSV-2, of the 544 evaluable
subjects, 533 VTM and 535 STM specimen types produced evaluable results for
HSV-2 analysis (11 VTM and 9 STM were reported as unknown composite reference
interpretation).
The performance of the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay compared to the composite
reference method for anogenital skin lesion specimens collected in STM and VTM is
summarized in Tables 10 and 11. The overall sensitivity for HSV-1 was 93.4% for
VTM and 94.7% for STM specimen types and the specificity was 99.8% for VTM
and 99.6% for STM specimen types (Table 10). For HSV-2, the sensitivity was
96.9% for VTM and 98.4% for STM specimen types and the specificity was 97.5%
for VTM and 92.8% for STM specimen types (Table 11).

The sponsor states there have been no changes to the Panther system software since 2014
(version 5.2.0).
The assay software, version 2.25, originally used for the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay
clinical studies was modified to a newer version (2.29) after the clinical reproducibility
testing was completed. The modified assay software version 2.29 uses the same
parameters as are planned to be used in the version for commercial use. Data generated

from the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay clinical testing sites were reprocessed using the new
assay software version 2.29. Hologic reprocessed the data using a validated tool, which
processes results in the same manner as the Panther system to demonstrate comparability
between software versions.
3. Specimen Identification:
Patient ID/Sample ID is is labeled with a unique barcode, which is tracked by the
software to prevent re-use and track positive sample identification.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Not Applicable
5. Calibration:
Real Time Fluorometers (RTF) undergo a single calibration during manufacturing. No
additional calibration is performed by the end user.
6. Quality Control:
The internal control IC) consists of a random sequence of RNA unrelated to HSV and is
introduced to each reaction during sample preparation. The IC is amplified in the same
reaction as the HSV-1 and HSV-2 mRNA targets. It is used to determine the validity of
each individual reaction and as an indicator of capture, amplification and/or detection
inhibition, and detection step errors, as well as to control for operator and instrument
errors.
Two controls are provided by Hologic to the user in the Aptima HSV Controls Kit: one
HSV dual positive control and one negative control. The positive control is composed of
HSV-1 and HSV-2 in-vitro transcript (IVT) at known concentrations. These controls
must generate results within predefined specifications to be valid. The negative control is
composed of a buffered solution and must also provide a valid negative result for the run
to be valid. Additionally, both controls must generate IC results within a predefined
specification.
A. Run Validity Criteria
The software automatically determines run validity. The software will invalidate a run if
either or both controls (negative and positive) have invalid results.
A run may be invalidated by an operator if technical, operator, or instrument difficulties
are observed and documented while performing the assay.
An invalid run must be repeated.

B. Control Validity
Table 15 defines the TTime validity criteria for the Negative and Positive Controls.
Table 15. TTime Validity Criteria
IC TTime HSV-1 TTime HSV-2 TTime
Negative Control ≥ 7.0 and ≤ 40.0 - -
Positive Control ≥ 7.0 and ≤ 53.0 ≥ 3.0 and ≤ 35.0 ≥ 3.0 and ≤ 35.0
Note: External quality control samples (not provided) should be tested in conformance with local, state,
and/or federal regulation or accreditation requirements and each laboratory’s standard Quality Control
procedures.
Note: For assistance with out-of-range controls, Hologic Technical Support should be contacted.
Note: When TTime cannot be calculated, a dash (-) will be displayed.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
The Panther system has been reviewed previously in K111409, K122062, P100042/S0001,
P100042/S002, P120007/S0001and P120007/S002
The software documentation was reviewed and found to be acceptable. The firm provided
documentation to support that the device was designed, developed, and maintained under
appropriate software lifecycle processes.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
