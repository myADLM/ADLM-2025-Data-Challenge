H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Elecsys Toxo IgM Immunoassay
The Elecsys Toxo IgM immunoassay is for the in vitro qualitative detection of IgM
antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii in human serum and plasma. This assay may be used as
an aid in the diagnosis of an acute or recent Toxoplasmosis infection in suspected patients
and pregnant women. Patient testing must be performed in conjunction with an anti-
Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibody assay.
The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on Elecsys
and cobas e immuno-assay analyzers. This assay has not been cleared by the FDA for
blood/plasma donor screening.
PreciControl Toxo IgM
PreciControl Toxo IgM is used for quality control of the Elecsys Toxo IgM immunoassay
on the Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Elecsys 2010 and cobas e 411 analyzers
I. Device Description:
The Elecsys Toxo IgM is a two-step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin microparticles
and electrochemiluminescence detection. In the first incubation, 10 μL of sample is
automatically prediluted 1:20 with Elecsys Diluent Universal, with T. gondii-specific
recombinant antigen labeled complex then added. Anti-Toxo IgM antibodies present in the
sample react with the labeled T. gondii-specific recombinant antigen. Biotinylated
monoclonal IgM specific antibodies and streptavidin-coated microparticles are subsequently
added. The complex becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and
streptavidin. The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the
microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound
substances are then removed with ProCell. Application of a voltage to the electrode then
2

induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier. Results are
determined automatically by the Elecsys software by comparing the
electrochemiluminescence signal obtained from the reaction. The assay can be run on either
the Elecsys 2010 of the cobas e 411 analyzers platforms.

There is no international standard available for measuring anti-Toxoplasma IgM in
serum; therefore, calibrators are traceable to an in-house reference preparation.
Calibrators
Calibration of an Elecsys Toxo IgM reagent lot is recommended every 28 days (1
month). Elecsys Toxo IgM reagent kits can be stored on-board the analyzers for up to
2 weeks. A new calibration of a kit kept on-board is recommended every 7 days
Stability:
Reagents
Reagent stability was determined by testing five human samples and two control
samples. The results support the claim of reagent stability for 12 weeks of storage
after first opening at 2-8°C (not on board). Reagents are only stable on-board the
analyzer up to 84 hours total time. The real-time data currently available supports a
shelf-life claim of 14 months at 2-8°C for unopened reagents.
Calibrators
Calibrator stability was determined by testing the calibrators in duplicate once after
first opening and once again after 8 weeks without loss of signal. The results support
the claim of calibrator stability for 8 weeks of storage after first opening at 2-8°C (not
on board). Calibrators are also stable beyond 5 hrs. when tested every hour on board
the analyzer at 20-25°C. The data provided supports a 5 hr. on-board stability claim.
The real-time data currently available supports a shelf-life claim of 14 months at 2-
8°C without opening.
Controls
The PreciControl Toxo IgM is stable at 2-8°C after first opening for up to 8 weeks.
The PreciControl Toxo IgM is stable for 5 h under on-board conditions. The real-time
data currently available supports a shelf-life claim of 14 months.
Samples
Samples are stable are for 3 days at 15-25°C, 3 weeks at 2-8°C and 3 months
at -20°C.
Expected values:
· Calibrator 1 is manufactured to have a target Index value range of 400 - 2500.
· Calibrator 2 is manufactured to have a target Index value range of 4500 - 35000.
· The negative control is manufactured to have a target Index value of 0.18 COI*
· The positive control is manufactured to have a target Index value of 2.0 COI*.
*cutoff index (COI) is calculated as a ratio of sample signal over cutoff. The target
Index value range for each control is reported in the rackpack or PerciControl kit to
make sure that the correct target values are used.

Cross reactivity:
The cross-reactivity study for the Elecsys Toxo IgM assay was designed to evaluate
potential interference from the presence of potentially cross-reactive antibodies or
substances that may cause symptoms similar to or that may mimic Toxoplasmosis
infection. Only samples that were sero-positive for the cross reactant and sero-
negative for Toxoplasma gondii IgM by a commercially available Toxoplasma lgM
assay were used to test for potentially cross-reactive organisms. The results are
summarized in table 3. below.

High Dose Hook Effect (false negative):
High-dose hook effect was evaluated by testing three samples with Toxoplasma
gondii lgM levels out-of-range > 64 COI (i.e., 64 x minimum positive value). In this
study, three samples with very high Toxo IgM levels were serially diluted with
negative sample to cover the entire assay range. The neat sample and dilutions were
tested using one lot on one instrument. The signal obtained was plotted versus the
dilution. The samples resulted in calculated concentration values above the measuring
range with no sample misclassification, indicating no hook effect was observed.
Interference
Testing was performed to determine whether the presence of endogenous or
exogenous substances (compounds) may interfere with assay results. Matched sample
pools (3 negative and 3 positive) were tested neat and spiked with the respective
interferent. Acceptance criteria were defined as the % change in signal must not be
more than + 20% and no change the qualitative result. The assay is unaffected at the
concentration for each substance listed in Table 4 below on the Elecsys Toxo IgM
assay.

f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off for the Elecsys Toxo IgM assay was established by the use of 900 clinical
samples from which a preliminary cutoff was set by ROC analysis. The results of the
internal and external testing to evaluate the performance of the Elecsys Toxo IgM
assay demonstrate that the cutoff of 1.0 COI is appropriate to obtain good sensitivity
and specificity.

Comparative testing:
Clinical performance of the Elecsys Toxo IgM assay was evaluated in three studies
(two prospective and one retrospective) and with a CDC panel. These studies were
conducted to compare the performance of the subject assay to an FDA-cleared
predicate device. Overall, there were 601 samples and 97 panel members tested in
these studies which comprised of samples from individuals who were sent to the
laboratory for T gondii IgM testing, or were from a retrospective collection. The
demographics of the patients vary widely and will be described with each pooled data
set.
Study 1

All specimens represented samples for whom anti-Toxo testing had been ordered for
clinical routine testing. The patient population consisted of 162 males and 278
females (158 were from pregnant women). The patient's age ranged from 2 to 86
years. The performance of the Elecsys Toxo IgM immunoassay, relative to an FDA

Samples with a cutoff index < 0.8 are non-reactive in the Elecsys Toxo IgM assay.
Samples with a cutoff index between ≥ 0.8 and < 1.0 are considered equivocal. The
sample should be retested. In case the result is still equivocal, a second sample should be
tested e.g. within 2-3 weeks. Samples with a cutoff index ≥ 1.0 are reactive in the Elecsys
