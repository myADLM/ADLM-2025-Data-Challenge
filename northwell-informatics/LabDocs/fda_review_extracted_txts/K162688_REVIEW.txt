L. Test Principle:
Coagulation Factor V and Coagulation Factor VII with Dade® Innovin®:
Factor activity is determined by mixing and incubation of diluted patient plasma with factor
V or VII deficient plasma and Dade® Innovin® Reagent prepared from purified recombinant
human tissue factor, combined with synthetic phospholipids (thromboplastin), calcium,
buffers and stabilizers. Clotting time is measured from the addition of the thromboplastin to
the formation of a fibrin clot. Results are reported as percent of norm based on the
prothrombin time (PT) result compared to a standard curve obtained with dilutions of
Standard Human Plasma.

Protein C with Protein C Reagent:
Protein C in the patient sample is activated by addition of a specific snake venom contained
in the Protein C Activator Reagent. Activated protein C inhibits Factor Va and Factor VIIIa
contained in the added Protein C Deficient Plasma which prolongs the subsequent APTT test.
Prolongation of the APTT is a measure of the protein C content of the patient sample.
Graduated dilutions of a standard plasma permit a standard curve to be established from
which the protein C content of patient samples can be read in percent of norm.
Protein C with Berichrom® Protien C:
Berichrom® Protein C detects the amidolytically active portion of the activated protein C.
Protein C in the patient sample is activated by a specific snake venom activator and the
resulting protein C is assayed in a kinetic test by measuring the increase in absorbance at 405
nm. Results are reported as percent of norm based on the measured change in absorbance
compared to a standard curve obtained with dilutions of Standard Human Plasma.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using three calibrated coagulation assay applications:
Coagulation Factor V with Dade Innovin®, Coagulation Factor VII with Dade
Innovin®, Protein C with Protein C Reagent and calibrated chromogenic assay
Protein C with Berichrom® Protein C. Testing was performed with a high
concentration sample pool (high pool) serially diluted to various concentrations using
a diluent pool (low pool). A minimum of 10 different dilutions were prepared and
analyte concentrations measured in replicates of four. Low pools were prepared by
dilution with respective factor deficient plasma; high pools were prepared by adding
respective factor concentrate. The study was performed on one Sysmex CS-2100i
analyzer with one lot of reagent on 1 day, with one run and four replicates of each
sample. For each sample, deviation between the linear regression model (predicted
value from 1st order regression) and the best fitting polynomial regression model was
calculated.

Traceability:
Standard Human Plasma (SHP) is used for the calibration of the following
applications: Coagulation Factor V with Dade® Innovin®, Coagulation Factor VII
with Dade® Innovin®, protein C with Protein C Reagent, and protein C with
Berichrom® Protein C.
Control Plasma N (CPN), and Control Plasma P (CPP) are assayed controls used to
monitor assay performance on the Sysmex 2100i. SHP, CPN, and CPP are traceable
to the following WHO Standard reference materials: 02/342, 09/172, and 03/116.
Stability:
On-Board Stability Testing for Calibrator and Controls
Standard Human Plasma is intended to be used immediately following reconstitution;
therefore, an on-board stability study was not required. Real-time on-board stability
testing for Control Plasma N and Control Plasma P was conducted internally. Three
lots of Control Plasma N and P were tested over multiple time points distributed over
the expected stability claim. Stability was assessed in terms of measurand drift for
each control level and lot and found to be acceptable to support the 17-hour and 14-
hour on-board stability claims for Control Plasma N and Control Plasma P,
respectively.
On-Board Stability Testing for Reagents
Real-time on-board stability testing for Coagulation Factor V Deficient Plasma,
Coagulation Factor VII Deficient Plasma, Protein C Reagent, and Berichrom Protein
C was conducted internally using pooled plasma and control materials as test
samples. The test samples were selected to cover the clinically reportable range for
each assay. For each reagent, multiple testing time points were pre-defined and
distributed over the expected on-board stability claims. Stability was assessed in
terms of measurand drift for each test sample and found to be acceptable to support
the following claims.
Reagent On-Board Stability Claim

protein C): 66 hours with reagent cap

Shelf-life and Open-Vial Stability Testing
Shelf-life and open-vial stability were reviewed in premarket notifications: K924405
(CPP), K924403 (CPN), K890634 (Berichrom® Protein C), K924425 and K002541
(Protein C Reagent), K924400 (Coagulation Factor VII Deficient Plasma), and
K924394 (Coagulation Factor V Deficient Plasma). Therefore, additional stability
studies were not required to support substantial equivalence in this premarket
notification.
Expected values / Value assignment
Primary standards/calibrators for factor V, factor VII and protein C are prepared from
the respective WHO Standards and used to assign the values of the secondary
standard, the Standard Human Plasma (SHP) masterlot. Product (commercial) lots of
SHP, Control N and Control P are value assigned with the secondary standard using a
similar value assignment process. The assigned values of SHP and control materials
remains as previously cleared (K924403 and K924404).
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD)
Coagulation Factor V Deficient Plasma and Coagulation Factor VII Deficient Plasma
with Dade® Innovin® and protein C with Protein C Reagent are prothrombin time
(PT) clot-based assays for which there is no detection limit. Therefore, LoB and LoD
were not applicable.
Limit of Quantitation
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was established for each assay. Plasma pools were
prepared by dilution of normal plasma with the respective application-specific
deficient plasma. The study was conducted over three testing days, one run per day
and four replicates per run. Each application met the pre-defined acceptance criteria
to support the lower limit of the clinically reportable range (CRR).

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference study
Interference with hemoglobin, conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin and
triglycerides was tested for each assay. The study was performed with one reagent lot,
one calibrator lot, one device and one trained operator. For each of the applications at
least two plasma pools (normal and pathological analyte concentration) were prepared
to test hemoglobin and icterus interference. Native samples were used for the
investigation of the triglyceride interference and Standard Human Plasma calibrator
was used for calibrated assays. Dose-response testing was carried out to determine the
degree of interference as a function of the interferent concentration. No significant
interference was observed up to the following interferent concentrations.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed at four clinical sites. Remnant citrated
plasma samples from routine laboratory testing were selected according to inclusion
and exclusion criteria. The percentage of frozen and contrived samples was limited to
approximately 10% of the number of total samples. Passing-Bablok regression
analysis was performed for each application by site and all sites combined
(summarized below). The observed predicted bias at the medical decision points for
combined sites met the pre-defined acceptance criteria for each application.

b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was conducted to demonstrate equivalence between fresh
and frozen citrated plasma samples. The study was conducted in one clinical site,
using one Sysmex CS-2100i analyzer, one reagent lot and one calibrator lot. Fresh
samples covering the clinical reportable range were measured on the Sysmex CS-
2100i analyzer within 4 hours after blood collection and after at least one week
(minimum 7 days) of storage time at -70 °C. Results were analyzed using Passing-
Bablok regression, Pearson correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman plots. The study
results demonstrated comparability between fresh and frozen samples and met the
defined acceptance criteria for all applicatons.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The reference interval studies were conducted at three clinical sites in the U.S. at
different geographic locations to reflect the U.S. population. Citrated plasma samples
obtained from 193 apparently healthy individuals between the age of 18 and 80 years
with no current or recent history of coagulation disease (e.g. thrombosis or bleeding), use
of anticoagulation medication, apparent infection or acute phase reaction, known
pregnancy, hospitalization within four weeks, or use of oral contraceptives or hormone
replacement therapy (exclusive to protein C testing). Results from all sites were pooled
and all reference intervals were established with samples from apparently healthy
individuals. The central 90% interval (5th to 95th percentile results) was calculated for
each application.

The Hazard Analysis and Software Development processes were reviewed in premarket
notification K150678. The technological characteristics cleared in K150678 remain
unchanged; therefore, additional software analysis was not required to support substantial
equivalence in this premarket notification.
3. Specimen Identification:
Manual entry and barcode reader
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Cap piercer for the normal mode. Cap piercing not allowed for a micro-mode.
5. Calibration:
Calibration is performed using Standard Human Plasma (SHP) as an automated function
of the Sysmex® CS-2100i. A new standard curve must be established when changing
reagent lot, post-major maintenance or service, if indicated by quality control results, and
when required according to laboratory control procedures and government regulations.
6. Quality Control:
Quality control testing using Control Plasma N and Control Plasma P should be
performed at least every 8 hours during intervals of patient testing. Controls should be
run after a new standard curve is established and after each change of reagent. Patient test
results should not be reported if controls are out of range.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Dilution Study
The Sysmex CS-2100i analyzer offers additional dilution options for each application
carried out by an auto-dilution mode:
- Auto-dilution mode 1:2 or 2:1 processing mode for Factor V and Factor VII
- Auto-dilution mode 1:2 for Protein C applications.
These automatic dilution options are carried out when measurement results are observed
outside the analytical measuring range (AMR) —auto-dilution mode (1:2) for results
above the AMR and the 2:1 processing mode for results below the AMR. In addition to
automatic dilution settings, the Sysmex CS-2100i analyzer also provides a "dilution
analysis" on demand to the user, as listed in the application sheets. The auto-dilution
study was carried out with one analyzer and one reagent lot with three different plasma
pools between assay measuring range (AMR) and clinical reportable range (CRR). At
least five manual dilutions with the same dilution factor and the method specific dilution
17

--- Page 18 ---
medium were prepared and measured on the analyzer in five replicates. The same
samples, but undiluted, were measured upon auto-dilution by the instrument. All
observed maximum deviations in the dilution analysis study were below the pre-defined
acceptance criteria.
2. Normal Mode versus Micro Mode
The Sysmex 2100i has two analysis modes: normal and micro. In the normal-sample
mode, samples for all the analyses including re-analyses are taken into the instrument at
the same time and analyzed using capped sample tube analysis. Automatic re-analysis
can also be performed. In the micro-sample mode, the sample volume from samples set in
the sampler or STAT holder is taken into the instrument through a secondary dispensing
sample probe and analyzed. The micro-sample mode cannot be used with capped sample
tubes. This analysis mode can also be performed with less sample volume than normal
mode. However, automatic re-analysis cannot be performed.
The comparison study between micro versus normal mode was conducted for each
application using 60 samples covering clinical reportable ranges, measured with one
reagent lot on one Sysmex CS-2100i analyzer and the predicate instrument. The study
results met pre-defined acceptance criteria and demonstrated acceptable comparability
between micro versus normal mode.
3. Carryover studies
Reagent carryover
The Sysmex CS-2100i analyzer has one reagent pipettor. The reagent carryover study
investigated whether a reagent or a test component of a donor application may affect an
acceptor application. A combination of donor and acceptor applications was tested in a
defined sequence. One normal plasma pool and one pathological plasma pool were used
as test samples. The reagent carryover studies data showed no cross-contamination
caused between one application into another.
Sample carryover
The sample volume transferred is critical for potential carryover effects. A donor was a
test sample with the highest possible analyte concentration that might interfere in the
subsequent assay. An acceptor was a low analyte concentration test sample measured
after the measurements of the donor assay. If sample carryover occurs the results of the
acceptor assay show interference. The donor and acceptor assay measurements were
performed in a defined sequence. The data supported lack of sample cross-contamination.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
