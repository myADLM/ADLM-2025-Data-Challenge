L. Test Principle:
The MAGLUMI 2000 TSH assay is a sandwich chemiluminescence immunoassay. Testing is
performed by combining the sample with magnetic particles coated with anti-TSH
monoclonal antibody, buffer and N-(4-Amino-Butyl)-N-Ethyl-Isoluminol (ABEI) labeled
with another monoclonal antibody to TSH, mixing thoroughly, and incubating at 37°C, to
form a sandwich of immuno-complexes. After precipitation in a magnetic field, the
supernatant is decanted and then a wash cycle is performed. Subsequently, the starters are
added to the precipitate to initiate a chemiluminescent reaction. The light signal is measured
by a photomultiplier within 3 seconds as relative light units (RLUs), which is indicative of
TSH concentration present in samples, calibrators or controls.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity for MAGLUMI 20000 TSH was evaluated in a study that followed the
CLSI EP6-A guideline. Eleven equally distributed levels samples were prepared by
mixing a low TSH serum sample (concentration 0 μIU/mL) and a high TSH serum
sample (concentration 105 μIU/mL). All samples were run in quadruplicate on 3
MAGLUMI 2000 Immunoassay Analyzers, with 3 reagent lots. The mean observed
value was compared to the expected values, the results obtained are shown in the
following table:
Observed Expected
Sample % Recovery
(μIU/mL) (μIU/mL)
0 0.0 0.0 0.0
1 0.4896 0.5 97.8
2 4.983 5.0 99.6

10 83.218 84.0 99.1
11 94.807 94.5 100.3
The expected values were plotted against the observed values and the following
regression equation was obtained:
y= 1.0001x + 0.0474, R2 = 0.9990
The results of the linearity study support the claimed measuring range of
0.02 μIU/mL to 91.78 μIU/mL .
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
MAGLUMI TSH calibrators are traceable to the TSH WHO 3rd International
Standard 81/565.
Stability:
Real-time shelf-life stability testing of the TSH reagent kit (which includes controls
and calibrators) is ongoing. The accelerated studies protocols and acceptances criteria
were reviewed and found to be acceptable to support a shelf-life of 12 months at 2-
8ºC.

Protocols and acceptance criteria for on-board/open vial stability studies for the kit,
which includes controls and calibrators, were reviewed and found to be acceptable to
support an on-board stability of 28 days at 10ºC ± 3ºC.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and the limit of quantitation (LoQ)
of the MAGLUMI 2000 TSH kit were evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2
guideline.
Limit of Blank (LoB)
To calculate the LoB for the MAGLUMI TSH, 5% BSA diluent was tested in
triplicates for 10 consecutive days, 2 runs per day on three different lot reagents to
yield 60 data points on the MAGLUMI 2000 Instrument assay. LoB was calculated
using the mean of the 57th and 58th highest obtained values and was determined to be
0.001 μIU/mL.
Limit of Detection (LoD)
Four low human serum samples pools with TSH concentrations of 0.005, 0.01, 0.02
and 0. 03 μIU/mL were tested on the MAGLUMI 2000 Immunoassay Analyzer, in
duplicates for 10 consecutive days, 2 runs per day on 3 different reagent lots for a
total of 60 data sets. LoD was calculated according to the EP17-A2 guideline and
determined to be 0.006 μIU/mL .
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
Six serum sample pools with TSH concentrations of 0.16, 0.07, 0.03, 0.0017, 0.009
and 0.005 μIU/mL, were used to determine the LoQ. Each level was tested in
duplicates for 20 days 2 runs per day using 3 different reagent lots for a total of 60
data points. The sponsor defined LoQ as the lowest concentration that demonstrated
an imprecision of 20%, which was determined to be 0.01 μIU/mL.
LoB LoD LoQ
0.001 μIU/mL 0.006 μIU/mL 0.01 μIU/mL
The LoB, LoD and LoQ studies support the MAGLUMI TSH assay claimed
measuring range of 0.02 to 91.78 μIU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference by endogenous and exogenous substances was evaluated in serum
samples according to the CLSI EP07-A2 guideline. Two serum samples with TSH
concentration of approximately 0.7 μIU/mL and 6.1 μIU/mL were spiked with
interfering substances and tested in triplicate with 3 reagent lots on one MAGLUMI
2000 Immunoassay Analyzer. Interference was determined by testing controls (no
interfering substance added) and matched test sample (with interfering substance
added).

The sponsor defines significant interference as ±10% bias as compared to the control
results. The results of the interference study are summarized in the table below:
Maximum concentration tested that
Substances
demonstrated no significant interference
Hemoglobin 2000 mg/dL
Conjugated bilirubin 60 mg/dL
Unconjugated bilirubin 40 mg/dL
Rheumatic factor 124 IU/mL
Acetaminophen 20 mg/dL
Ibuprofen 50 mg/dL
Aspirin 50 mg/dL
Biotin 10 ng/mL
Total protein 12.5 mg/mL
Triglycerides 1000mg/dL
Cross-Reactivity Testing:
A cross-reactivity study was performed to evaluate the potential cross-reactivity of
the TSH assay. The potential cross-reactants were added at defined concentrations
to human serum samples with TSH concentrations of 1.09, 2.1, 5.0 µIU/mL. The
control and spiked samples were assayed in triplicates using 3 reagent lots on the
MAGLUMI 2000 System. The sponsor defines non-significant interference as ≤5%
difference from the of the expected value. The following potentially cross-reacting
compounds, at the following concentrations, did not interfere with the performance
of the device:
Compound Tested Highest Concentration Cross-reactivity (%)
FSH 1,500 mIU/mL ≤ 0.53
LH 600 mIU/mL ≤ 1.39
hCG 200 IU/mL ≤ 1.59
Human Anti-Mouse Antibodies (HAMA):
The effects of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) on the MAGLUMI TSH assay
were evaluated. Individual patient serum samples with TSH concentrations of 0.133,
2.56, and 4.71 μIU/mL were mixed with equal volume of HAMA positive samples.
The final concentration of HAMA in these samples was 300 ng/mL. The mixed
samples were analyzed using the MAGLUMI 2000 Immunoassay Analyzer in
triplicate. The results indicate no interference from HAMA up to 300 ng/mL. The
following cautionary note has been included in the Limitations of the Procedure
section of the product insert: “Patient sample containing human anti-mouse
antibodies (HAMA) may give falsely elevated or decreased values. Although
HAMA neutralizing agents are added, extremely high HAMA serum concentrations
may occasionally influence results”.

High Dose Hook Effect:
To evaluate the potential for high dose hook effect on the MAGLUMI TSH assay,
six serum samples were spiked with TSH WHO standard to generate concentrations
values of 100, 300, 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 µIU/mL. For each of the six samples,
four serial dilutions were created with TSH WHO standard in ratios of 1:10, 1:32,
1:64, and 1:128. Testing was performed for each stock solution and each diluted
solution in duplicate using three different reagent lots. The results demonstrate that
no hook effect was observed at TSH concentration ≤ 3000 μIU/ml.

· Every week and/or each time a new reagent is used.
· After any major service is performed.
· If the controls are out of the expected range.
· When the room temperature changes exceeds 5ºC.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor recommends the user should follow government regulations or accreditation
for quality control frequency. (Three levels of quality control are provided in the kit.)
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
A carryover study was performed using a free TSH serum sample (blank), a mid-level pool
and a serum pool with a TSH concentration of 90 μIU/mL (high). Testing was performed for
five days, according to the following order: Mid, High, Low, Mid, Mid, Low, Low, High,
High, Mid. Each sample was analyzed using three instruments and three lots of reagent.
Percent carryover was calculated each day and compared to zero. The data obtained in all 5
days showed that the percent carryover is less than 0.01%. The sponsor concluded that the
percent carryover is not detectably different from zero.
