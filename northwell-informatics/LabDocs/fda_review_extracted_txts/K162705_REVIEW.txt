1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To obtain measures of repeatability and within-laboratory precision, three
VALIDATE® D-Dimer Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Kit lots (levels 1–5)
were analyzed in a single-site study performed over 20 operating days, two runs per
day and two replicates per run for each level. Testing was performed on one STA-R®
Evolution analyzer using a single lot of STA® - Liatest® D-Di. To demonstrate
precision performance, %CV and SD of within-run, between-run, between-day, and
within-laboratory (total) were calculated. The repeatability study met the pre-
determined acceptance criteria. Results from the study are provided in the table
below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity for the VALIDATE® D-Dimer Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Kit
was completed on the Stago STA-R® Evolution instrument. Linearity performance
was confirmed for the D-Dimer analyte by manual method and a software derived
method using Analyze-IT® linearity software. The D-dimer concentrations of each
measured value of the five levels plotted vs. five assigned levels of concentration.
The results provided appeared to be linear.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Not applicable. An international reference preparation (IRP) is not available for D-
dimer assays.
Value Assignment
A linear relationship exists between levels 1 through 5 of each VALIDATE® D-
Dimer Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Kit; level 1 being the lowest
concentration and level 5 being the highest concentration. Levels 1 and 5 are
prepared independently by the addition of D-dimer to a human plasma base. The D-
dimer is prepared by Maine Standards from fresh frozen human plasma. Intermediate
levels 2, 3, and 4 are subsequently prepared from levels 1 and 5 by equal part
dilutions. Testing was performed for each level on five separate days, six replicates
per day for a total of 30 replicates per level. Total percent coefficient of variation
(%CV) was calculated for levels 1 and 5, and found to be within the predefined
acceptance criteria. Typical mean recovery values for all levels for one representative
lot tested using the STA® - Liatest D-Di reagent kit in combination with the STA-R®
Evolution are presented in the table below.

Shelf-life and Open-Vial Stability Testing
A real-time stability study was performed to support the shelf-life claim for the
VALIDATE® D-Dimer Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Kit. Stability was
evaluated on the STA-R® Evolution using three lots of VALIDATE® D-Dimer
Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Kit. Acceptance criteria were found to be
acceptable and support the shelf-life stability claim of 4 months from the date of
manufacturing (DOM) when stored at -10 to -25°C.
A freeze/thaw stability assessment was also conducted to support the open-vial
stability claim. Acceptance criteria were found to be acceptable to support four
freeze/thaw events.
