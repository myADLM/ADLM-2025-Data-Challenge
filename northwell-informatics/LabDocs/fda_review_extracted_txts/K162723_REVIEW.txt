I. Device Description:
TransFix/EDTA Vacuum Blood Collection Tubes (TVTs) are intended for collection and
storage of human whole blood specimens for immunophenotyping of white blood cells
(WBC, leukocytes) by flow cytometry up to 14-days following collection; the TVTs
preserve the qualitative and quantitative leukocyte subset characteristics. Flow cytometry
is used to identify subsets of leukocytes that can be distinguished on the basis of cell
surface antigens using fluorescent antibodies.
The TransFix®/EDTA Vacuum Blood Collection Tubes (TVTs) consist of purple-capped
polyethylene terephthalate blood collection tubes containing the paraformaldehyde based
preservative, TransFix, and K3EDTA at the correct volume to simultaneously stabilize
and anti-coagulate human whole blood at the time of collection. TVTs hold three mLs
(final draw volume) with a tube dimension of 13 x 75mm. TVTs are sterilized by gamma
radiation. Further, the vacuum contained within the TVT ensures that the
TransFix/EDTA reagent is administered at the correct ratio of one part TransFix/EDTA
to five parts whole blood.

L. Test Principle:
Lymphocyte subsets are distinguished by the cell surface antigens that are detected through the
use of fluorochrome-labeled antibodies and flow cytometry instruments. Qualitative and
quantitative changes in lymphocyte subsets are used to identify and monitor immunodeficiency
and hematological diseases. TransFix®/EDTA Vacuum Blood Collection Tubes are designed to
preserve peripheral blood sample qualitative and quantitative lymphocyte subset characteristics.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance using the Multitest™ IMK kits (K974360 and K980858):
All studies met the manufacturers predetermined acceptance criteria.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Lot to Lot Reproducibility
Peripheral whole blood was collected from five healthy subjects in two TVTs from three
lots at one site. The peripheral whole blood was tested at the same site on Days 0 (<6
hours from venipuncture), 12, and 15. Blood samples were stored at 2–8°C immediately
after testing on Day 0 and in between test Days 12 and 15. At each time point, testing was
performed with triplicate determinations on each of the duplicate TVTs from each of the
three lots of investigational product. For each sample, all six CD markers were tested
(CD3, CD8, CD4, CD45, CD16/CD56, CD19) using a BD FACs Calibur (K973483).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Reagent stability
To evaluate the stability of unopened and opened pouches of TVTs, four peripheral
whole blood samples were collected from a total of five healthy individuals. Of the
four peripheral whole blood samples collected, one sample was collected into a 4 mL
BD K3EDTA Vacutainer (K971449) and three samples were collected into three
different lots of 3 mL TVTs, opened and unopened. The sample collected in the 4 mL
BD K3EDTA Vacutainer was analyzed immediately (defined as within 6 hours of
collection) for a full lymphocyte count (i.e., CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD16/56 and
CD45 panel) in triplicate and results were averaged. Samples taken into the TVT
tubes were similarly analyzed for a full lymphocyte count in triplicate on Day 0 (<6
hours post venipuncture), and also on Days 12 and 15. The averaged absolute cell
counts obtained from the 4 mL BD K3EDTA Vacutainer were considered as the
control “baseline” data. Blood samples collected in TVTs were stored at 2–8°C
immediately after testing on Day 0 and in between test Days 12 and 15. The results
support stability of one month for both unopened and opend tube pouches.
Additional testing is ongoing to support longer-term reagent stability
Stability-Vacum Stability
Stability of the TVT vacuum with regard to drawing the correct volume of blood after
tubes were stored for different time periods prior to use was assessed. Three lots were
tested. The volume of blood in the filled TVT tubes was measured with a 5mL
serological pipette with a tolerance of +/- 0.1mL. The tube’s vacuum was stable for
one month. Additional testing is ongoing to support longer-term vacuum stability.
Shipping Stability
The stability of TVTs was evaluated following the transport of tubes under shipping
conditions. Three unopened pouches of 3 mL TVTs, from three different lots were
tested for TVT functionality, vacuum performance and qualitative stability metrics,
i.e., appearance. This constituted the pre-shipping test. Following the pre-shipping
test, three additional unopened pouches of 3 mL TVTs, from the same three lots used
in the pre-shipping test, were packed into a cardboard box along with an electronic
device for monitoring the temperature during transit. The TVTs were received two
days later and shipped back to Caltag Medsystems using the same courier and
method. Identical tests were conducted for TVT functionality, vacuum performance
and qualitative stability metrics on these returned tubes on. This constituted the post-
shipping test. The post-shipment tubes met acceptance criteria for vacuum stability
and accurate measurement of absolute cells counts.

d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Peripheral blood samples were collected from healthy (n=5) and HIV positive (n=5)
subjects in 4 ml K3 EDTA tubes. Following the collection the two 4 ml blood
samples were split into seven 1 ml aliquots. The aliquots were spiked with various
interferents listed in the table below.
Aliquot # Interferent Concentration
1 Control (No Interferent) n/a
2 bilirubin 2 µg/ml (0.2 mg/dL)
3 bilirubin 200 µg/ml (20 mg/dL)
4 hemoglobin 0.025 g/ml (2.5 g/dL)
5 hemoglobin 0.035 g/ml (3.5 g/dL)
6 triglycerides 1.5 mg/ml (150 mg/dL)
7 triglycerides 5 mg/ml (500 mg/dL)
Following the addition of the interferents, each aliquot was stabilized using the
appropriate amount of TransFix reagent following the manufactures instructions, i.e.,
0.2 mL TransFix administered to the 1mL aliquot, and were stored at 2–8°C between
test days. Aliquots were for a full lymphocyte count (i.e. CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19,
CD16/56 and CD45 panel) on a BD FACS Canto II flow cytometer. Duplicate test
results at each time point were used for the analysis. No interference was seen at the
interferent concentration tested.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Peripheral blood samples were taken from 12 healthy subjects and 30 HIV positive
subjects across three sites. At each site, whole blood samples were collected in a BD
4 mL K3 EDTA Vacutainer, a Strek Cyto Chex BCT (BCT), and a 3 ml
TransFix/EDTA Vacuum Blood Collection Tubes (TVT). Samples from each tube
were used to perform immunophenotyping of lymphocyte subsets using the BD
Multitest kits CD3/CD16CD56/CD45/CD19 (K980858) and CD3/CD4/CD8/CD45
(K974360). The absolute counts obtained from the 4 ml K3 EDTA Vacutainter at
baseline (Day 0) were used as the control. Samples from the subject and the predicate
devices were tested in duplicate at at days 0, 11, and 15. Passing-Bablok regression
analysis was used to anayze data.
