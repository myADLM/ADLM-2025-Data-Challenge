4. Special instrument requirements:
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems
I. Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each
VITEK 2 test card contains 64 microwells. A control well containing only culture medium is
included on all cards, with the remaining wells containing premeasured amounts of a specific
antimicrobial agent in a culture medium base. A suspension of organism from a pure culture
is prepared in a tube containing 0.45-0.5% sterile saline and standardized to a McFarland 0.5
using the DensiCHEK Plus. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals and places the
card into the incubator/reader; manual methods can also be used for the inoculation of test
cards for use in the VITEK 2 System. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling and
sealing operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time (up to 18 hours). At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is
generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each
antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-GN Ciprofloxacin has the following concentrations in the card: 0.06, 0.12,
0.5, and 1µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL). The MIC
result reporting range for the card is ≤0.06-≥4 µg/mL.

L. Test Principle:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection
using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics used in the systems use
visible light to directly measure organism growth. Transmittance optics are based on an
initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Periodic light
transmittance samplings of the same well measure organism growth by how much light is
prevented from going through the well. The VITEK 2 System monitors the growth of each
well in the card over a defined period of time. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16
hours for a “rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in some instances. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along
with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic on the card.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three sites using ten isolates of gram
negative bacilli that were consistent with the intended use. Isolates were tested in
triplicates over three days for a total of 270 data points. The isolates tested in the
reproducibility study included Klebsiella pneumoniae (one isolate), Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (three isolates), Citrobacter freundii (one isolate), Enterobacter
aerogenes (one isolate), Providencia rettgeri (one isolate), Serratia marcescens (two
isolates), and E. coli (one isolate). Inocula were prepared using both manual and
automatic dilution methods for testing in the VITEK 2. Inocula were prepared
manually for testing in the VITEK 2 Compact. The mode MIC value was determined
and the reproducibility was calculated based on MIC values falling within ± 1
dilution of the mode MIC value.
Using VITEK 2 and automatic dilution, all results were on scale.The reproducibility
was 100%.
Using VITEK 2 and manual dilution, there was one off-scale result. The best case
reproducibility was 98.88% and the worst case reproducibilily was 98.52%.
Using VITEK 2 Compact and manual dilution, there was one off-scale result. The
best case reproducibility was 99.62% and the worst case reproducibility was 99.26%
5

--- Page 6 ---
The reproducibility results were acceptable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Inoculum Density Check:
The inoculum density was monitored using the DensiCHEK Plus™ instrument. The
DensiCHEK Plus™ was standardized daily with all results recorded and within
expected range.
Purity Check:
A purity check of all organisms was performed at the time of VITEK2 card
inoculation. Only results obtained with pure cultures were evaluated.
Quality Control Testing:
QC organisms recommended by both FDA and CLSI, namely E. coli ATCC 25922
and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were tested using both the VITEK 2
AST-GN Ciprofloxacin and the reference method at each site. Both the automatic
dilution and manual dilution methods were used for the VITEK 2 and the manual
dilution method was used for the VITEK 2 Compact. A summary of QC results is
presented in Table 2.
A second set of 20 quality control results was obtained during the additional testing
required by the FDA. Testing was conducted at one internal site. Results are
presented in Table 2a.
The expected range for E. coli ATCC 25922 with Ciprofloxacin is 0.004 – 0.015
µg/mL. Even though the Ciprofloxacin concentrations included in the VITEK 2 AST-
Gram Negative card are 0.06, 0.12, 0.5, and 1 µg/mL, the reporting range is ≤0.06 -
≥4 µg/mL. Therefore, all results for the QC strain E. coli ATCC 25922 were off scale
for the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems as both VITEK systems report the
lowest end of the scale as ≤0.06 µg/mL. The MIC range of the reference test panel
was 0.008 to 8 µg/mL and also did not include the low end of the concentration range
for this strain (0.004 µg/mL). However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 was
also tested to verify the performance of the device and all results were on-scale since
the reporting range on the card and on the concenrations on the reference panel cover
the expected range for this organism.
The quality control results are acceptable.

Clinical
A total of 982 clinical isolates were evaluated at three external sites with VITEK 2
AST – Gram Negative cards inoculated by automatic dilution and interpreted using
the VITEK 2 instrument. There were four isolates that failed to grow (99.6% growth
rate). The results for 978 clinical isolates are provided in Tables 3-5.
The majority of isolates were fresh (808 isolates, 82.3%); 174 isolates (17.7%) were
stock isolates. There were 832 Enterobacteriaceae including 11 Salmonella spp, and
146 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested in the clinical studies.
Challenge
A total of 82 challenge isolates were evaluated at one external site. Per FDA’s request
an additional set of 88 challenge isolates was tested at an internal site.The challenge
sets were tested with both automatic and manual dilution methods on the VITEK 2
System and with the manual dilution method on the VITEK2 Compact System. One
isolate failed to grow (99.4% growth rate) during the additional testing. The results of

Challenge-VITEK 2 Compact
The overall performance of the VITEK 2 Compact (manual dilution) was considered
acceptable based on the reproducibility (99.26%), QC (Table 2), and challenge (Table
5) studies.
Resistant Organisms:
A total of 222 resistant isolates were identified out of 1147 organisms tested (19.3%)
were found to be resitant to Ciprofloxacin by the reference method. However, the
following indicated organisms had no resistant isolates and/or had an insufficient
number of isolates around the breakpoint available during comparative testing :
Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia rettgeri, Salmonella enteridis,Salmonella typhi
and Shigella sonnei. This was addressed by adding the following limitation in the
labeling:
“The ability of the AST card to detect resistance with the following combination (s) is
unknown because resitant strains were not available at the time of comparative
testing:
· Ciprofloxacin: Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia rettgeri, Salmonella
enteridis,Salmonella typhi and Shigella sonnei”.
MIC Trends:
Using the combined clinical and challenge data for Enterobacteriaceae and P.
aeruginosa an analysis of trending was conducted. This trending calculation takes
into account MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilution
lower or higher compared to the reference method irrespective whether the device
MIC values are on-scale or not. The combined data of149 for P. aeruginosa and 178
for the Enterobacteriaceae group constitute the evaluable data for trend analysis
which is presented in Table 6.

(8.09% 27. 38%)
Note: A positive percent difference value indicates higher MIC when compared to the reference method; A
negative percent difference value indicates lower MIC when compared to the reference method.

A higher reading trend was observed for both Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa compared to the CLSI broth microdilution method, and was found to be
significant which raises concerns for potential major errors as summarized in Table 6.
The high trending and the potential for occurrence of major error(s) for Ciprofloxacin
when testing clinical and challenge isolate results with VITEK 2 system, was
addressed in the labeling by adding the following footnote:
“VITEK 2 system Ciprofloxacin MIC values for all organisms tended to be one or
more doubling dilution higher compared to reference broth microdilution”.
