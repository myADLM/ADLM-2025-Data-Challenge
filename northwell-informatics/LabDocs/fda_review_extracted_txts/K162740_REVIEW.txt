Limitations:
Imipenem results obtained with P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter sp. using the
Prompt Inoculation system have shown potential major errors. If critical to
2

--- Page 3 ---
patient care, isolates of those species that provide a resistant interpretation
should be retested using the turbidity inoculation method.
Results obtained with Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Serratia species
and imipenem have shown discrepant MICs when compared with the reference
method. If the antimicrobial agent is critical to patient care, an alternative
procedure should be used.
4. Special instrument requirements:
MicroScan panels can be read either manually or automatically on the WalkAway or
autoScan-4 instrument systems.

inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test organism is determined by observing the lowest
antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three sites using ten isolates of gram
negative bacilli that were consistent with the intended use. Isolates were tested in
triplicate over three days for a total of 270 data points. The isolates tested in the
reproducibility study included Acinetobacter baumannii/haemolyticus (two isolates),
Citrobacter freundii complex (one isolate), Enterobacter aerogenes (two isolates),
Escherichia coli (two isolates) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (three isolates). Inocula
were prepared using both the turbidity and Prompt™ method and results were read
manually and with the WalkAway and autoSCAN-4 instrument systems. The vast
majority of data points were on-scale and only two to four data points were off-scale
by the different read methods. The reproducibility is therefore calculated for “best
case” and “worst case” as defined in the AST Special Controls Guidance taking into
consideration the on-scale and off-scale data points.

turbidity inocula were prepared using the MicroScan Turbidity Meter with a reading
of 0.08 ± 0.02 (equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland barium sulfate turbidity standard). The
digital reading was recorded each day of use.
Data was also collected during the Reproducibility phase using the Prompt inoculum
preparation method. Colony counts were performed weekly on the quality control
strain E. coli ATCC 25922. Colony counts were also done once at each site for each
reproducibility isolate.
Purity Check. Purity check plates were performed on all isolates from each
inoculum preparation.
Growth Failure Rate. During the course of the study there were no growth failures
with the MicroScan panel with imipenem.
Quality Control Testing. The CLSI and FDA recommended QC organisms (E. coli
ATCC 25922 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853) were tested using all inoculation and
read methods. The results are shown in Tables 3 and 4.

The expected range for E. coli ATCC 25922 with imipenem is 0.06 – 0.25 µg/mL and
the whole range is below the dilutions included in the MicroScan panel with
imipenem (0.25 – 8 µg/mL). Greater than 95% of the results obtained with the
MicroScan panel were ≤0.25 µg/mL. Since the expected range is off-scale for the
dilutions present on the MicroScan panel, the sponsor included the following footnote
to the QC table in labeling:
“Panels do not include the full CLSI/FDA recommended dilution range for QC
testing with this organism.”
Because the expected range for E. coli ATCC 25922 with imipenem falls below the
lowest concentration on the MicroScan panel, the sponsor conducted additional QC
with P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853.

Results obtained with the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel with
reformulated imipenem were compared to results obtained with the CLSI frozen broth
microdilution reference panel. The range of dilutions evaluated with the MicroScan
panels was 0.25 – 8 µg/mL.
Two inoculation methods were used: the Prompt Inoculation System and the turbidity
method. For the Prompt Inoculation System, inocula were prepared using the
instructions of the manufacturer. For the turbidity method, inocula were standardized
using the MicroScan Turbidity Meter to approximate a 0.5 McFarland turbidity
standard. Reference panels were inoculated using the turbidity method.

Three read methods were evaluated: manual read, automated read using the
WalkAway and automated read using the autoScan-4. Reference panels were
manually read.
A total of 419 clinical isolates were evaluated including Acinetobacter spp. (39
isolates), Citrobacter spp. (21 isolates), Enterobacter spp. (60 isolates), E. coli (87
isolates), Klebsiella spp. (86 isolates), M. morganii (16 isolates), P. aeruginosa (85
isolates), P. rettgeri (11 isolates), and Proteus spp. (14 isolates including one isolate
of P. penneri and 13 isolates of P. vulgaris). Of the 419 isolates 325 were fresh
isolates and 94 were stock isolates; 59 isolates were resistant to imipenem by the
reference method.
A total of 179 challenge isolates were evaluated including Acinetobacter spp. (42
isolates), Citrobacter spp. (6 isolates), Enterobacter spp. (18 isolates), E. coli (17
isolates), Klebsiella spp. (35 isolates), M. morganii (4 isolates), P. aeruginosa (43
isolates), P. rettgeri (8 isolates), and Proteus spp. (6 isolates of P. vulgaris). Isolates
obtained from the FDA-CDC AR Isolate Bank were included as challenge strains. Of
the 180 challenge isolates, 112 were resistant to imipenem by the reference method.
For Enterobacteriaceae overall essential and category agreement was acceptable at
>89.9%. There was an increased occurrence of minor errors for P. rettgeri and
Proteus spp. with all read and inoculation methods and with M. morganii for all read
methods with turbidity inoculation. However, because the EA of evaluable MIC
results was acceptable for all inoculation and read methods (≥97.3%), the
performance was considered to be acceptable.
For Acinetobacter species essential agreement for both inoculation methods and all
read methods was acceptable at >89.9%. For Acinetobacter isolates inoculated using
the Prompt system, category agreement was 88.9%, 87.7% and 88.9% for the
WalkAway, autoSCAN-4 and manual read methods, respectively. This low category
agreement is attributed to the occurrence of minor errors and a single major error.
Category agreement for Acinetobacter species inoculated using the turbidity method
is acceptable at >89.9% for MICs read using the WalkAway and autoSCAN-4.
Category agreement for the turbidity inoculation method with the manual read was
low at 88.9% due to a minor errors; however the essential agreement of evaluable
results was 100%. The category agreement obtained with the turbidity inoculation
method was determined to be acceptable.
For P. aeruginosa, essential and categorical agreement for all inoculation and read
methods was acceptable at >89.9%. However, for P. aeruginosa inoculated with
using the Prompt system, there was an increased occurrence of major errors with all
read methods.
For isolates inoculated using the Prompt Inoculation system and read using the
WalkAway instrument, overall EA and CA were acceptable at 95.5% and 90.6%,
respectively.

To address major errors with the Prompt Inocuation system with isolates of
Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa the sponsor included the following limitation in
the device labeling:
Imipenem results obtained with P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter sp. using the
Prompt Inoculation system have shown potential major errors. If critical to
patient care, isolates of those species that provide a resistant interpretation
should be retested using the turbidity inoculation method.
Tables 5-10 below summarize the performance with imipenem for clinical and
challenge isolates of each organism group: Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter species
and P. aeruginosa. Data is shown for each inoculum preparation method (Prompt
and turbidity) and for each read method (WalkAway, autoSCAN-4 and manual read).

EA – Essential Agreement (+/- 2 dilutions) min – minor discrepancies
CA – Category Agreement maj – major discrepancies
EVAL – Evaluable isolates vmj – very major discrepancies
R or NS – Resistant or non-susceptible isolates
Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the result of the reference
method and that of the MicroScan panel within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of
the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on scale for both the MicroScan panel and
the reference method. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result
of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the MicroScan panel.

MIC Trend Analysis
Using the data provided by the sponsor in the diagonal table format recommended in
the AST Special Controls guidance document, an analysis was conducted for trending
in MIC values.
As summarized in Table 11 below, a higher trending was observed for members of
the Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. There was no trending observed for
Acinetobacter species.

Read Method with Clinical and Challenge isolates.

Trending analysis indicated that MICs for Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa
trended at least one dilution higher than the MICs obtained with the reference
method. MIC results with Acinetobacter showed no trending. The trending
calculation takes into account MIC values that are determined to be ≤ 1 doubling
dilution or ≥ 1 doubling dilution compared to the reference method irrespective
whether the device MIC values are on-scale or not. The sponsor added the following
footnote to the performance table in the device labeling:
Imipenem MIC values tended to be one doubling dilution higher compared to the
reference broth microdilution method for Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa.
Prompt Hold Study
An additional study was performed to determine the agreement of results obtained
with the Prompt inoculation method using hold times of 0 hours and 4 hours prior to
inoculation of the panels. The following times and comparisons were made with each
of the read methods (WalkAway, autoSCAN-4 and manual).
Results of 4-hour hold vs. results of 0-hour hold
Results of 4-hour hold vs. results obtained with the frozen reference method

Results of 0-hour hold vs. results obtained with the frozen reference method
All tests showed overall acceptable essential agreement; category agreement was
<90.0% for some organism groups due to the presence of minor errors. One major
error was obtained with one Acinetobacter isolate with the 0-hour vs. frozen reference
with all read methods (2.0% major error rate).
Results were determined to be acceptable.
