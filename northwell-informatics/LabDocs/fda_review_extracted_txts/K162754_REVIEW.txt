Each cartridge contains:
· Monoclonal mouse anti- Vitamin D 1.6 ± 0.16 ng
· 25-hydroxyvitamin D 136 ± 13.6 ng
· Fluorescence particles 2.4 ± 0.24 mg
Each sample dilution tube contains:
· Perfluorohexanoic acid 9.5 ± 0.95 mg
Each Gold antibody pretreatment tube contains:
· Gold nano-particle conjugation antibody 7.0 ± 0.7 mg
The FREND System (previously cleared in k124056), which is a bench top fluorescence
reader containing a touch-screen user interface, is not provided with the kit but is required for
the FREND Vitamin D test. The FREND AP System is an “Advanced Preparing” device that
performs automated pre-analytical steps of mixing, timed heating, and pipetting of the
sample from the Gold Antibody Pretreatment tube into the FREND Vitamin D test cartridge.
A sample is diluted in the sample dilution tube first and then transferred to the pretreatment
tube prior to being inserted into the FREND AP System for sample mixing, incubation and
pipetting into the test cartridge. The test cartridge is then inserted into the FREND System to
be analyzed.

L. Test Principle:
The FREND Vitamin D Test System is a competitive immunoassay with gold microparticles
labeled with Vitamin D-specific monoclonal anti-Vitamin D-antibody (mouse), Vitamin D-
biotin labeled with fluorescence nanoparticles and fluorescence detection by the FREND
System. The concentration of the analyte of interest in an unknown sample is calculated
using the ratio of the fluorescent intensity of the test zone and the reference zone. The
magnitude of the fluorescent ratio is inversely proportional to the amount of 25-OH Vitamin
D in the sample. There is no calibration needed by the user because each cartridge is coded
with the calibration information generated by the manufacturer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
An internal precision study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP5-A3 in which
three serum samples with low, intermediate and high 25-OH Vitamin D levels were
assayed in duplicate in two runs per day for 20 days using one reagent lot for a total
of 80 results per sample. The precision results are summarized in the table below:

3 80.5 4.53 5.6% 1.13 1.4% 0.74 0.9% 4.72 5.9%
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated based on CLSI EP-6A. A linearity sample set was prepared
by diluting a serum sample with high 25-OH vitamin D concentration with a serum
sample with low 25-OH vitamin D concentration to obtain nine (9) concentration
levels (8.0, 20.2, 32.4, 44.6, 56.8, 69.0, 81.2, 93.4, 105.6ng/mL) across the measuring
range of the candidate assay. Samples were run in replicates of 4 on one FREND
system using one reagent lot. The ordinary least squares linear regression of the
observed mean concentrations versus the expected concentration was calculated and
yielded the following linear regression equation:
y = 0.9567x + 1.9626, r 2= 0.9894
The results of the linearity study support the sponsor’s claim that the assay is linear
from 13 – 96 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The FREND Vitamin D Code chip calibration information is traceable to the
manufacturer’s primary calibrators. The primary calibrators are prepared
gravimetrically from a certified standard material and confirmed by measurement on
the ARCHITECT i 25-OH Vitamin D assay (k110619). All calibration statistics and
information have been electronically stored on the FREND Vitamin D Code chip
included in each box of FREND Vitamin D cartridges. There is no need for
calibration by the operator as the calibration information is coded in each code chip,
which is lot-specific.
Quality Control:
The sponsor recommends the use of at least two levels of commercially available
quality control material that contains 25-OH Vitamin D as the measurand. The
sponsor used Bio-Rad Lyphocheck Immunoassay Controls (cleared under k133960)
during performance characteristic studies.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification
(LoQ) studies were performed according to CLSI EP-17A2.

--- Page 6 ---
To establish LoB, six blank serum samples were assayed 10 times per day per sample
over 6 days using 3 reagent lots on one FREND system. The Limit of Blank was
calculated from N = 60 results using a non-parametric analysis and was determined to
be 3.3 ng/mL.
To determine LoD, five low level serum samples were assayed 2 times per day over 6
days using 3 reagent lots on one FREND system. The LoD was calculated from LoB
using the following formula LoD = LoB+ C x SD and was determined to be 6.3
β
ng/mL.
The LoQ was determined by performing a functional sensitivity study. Six levels of
25-OH vitamin D serum samples (2.5– 40.0 ng/dL) were assayed using 3 lots of
reagent for 4 days on one FREND system. The 25-OH vitamin D concentration
giving an imprecision of 20%CV was determined to be the LoQ value.
Detection limits results:
Limit of Blank Limit of Detection Limit of Quantitation
3.3 ng/mL 6.3 ng/mL 9.9 ng/mL
The reportable range of the assay is 13-96 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
The sponsor performed studies to evaluate the effect of potential interferents on the
performance of the FREND Vitamin D Test, following the CLSI EP07-A2 guideline.
Two levels of serum sample pools containing approximately 20 ng/mL and 40-50
ng/mL of Vitamin D were spiked with different concentrations of the potential
interferents. Each level of Vitamin D sample was tested with each interferent in 3
replicates. The sponsor defined non-significant interference as recovery from 90% to
110% of the expected Vitamin D concentration. The table below lists the substances
tested and the concentration at which no significant interference was observed:

Cross reactivity:
Cross-reactivity with the FREND Vitamin D was evaluated by spiking potential cross
reactants to two levels of (low and high) 25-OH Vitamin D serum pools. The cross-
reactivity was calculated using the following equation:
% cross reactivity = 100 x [(Measured value – true value) / concentration of
interferent)]
Results from this study are summarized in the tables below:

The sponsor includes the following limitations in the labeling:
· Patients taking the drugs containing Paricalcitol (e.g., Zemplar) should not be
tested by this assay.
· Certain medications may interfere with assay performance. All results should
be interpreted with respect to the clinical picture of the patient.
· Although hemolysis has an insignificant effect on the assay, hemolyzed
samples may indicate mistreatment of a specimen prior to assay and results
should be interpreted with caution.
· Lipemia has an insignificant effect on the assay except in the case of gross
lipemia where interference with the lateral flow of the sample in the cartridge
may occur.

Hook effect study:
The sponsor performed a hook effect study by testing Vitamin D-depleted serum
spiked with 25-OH Vitamin D3 using a single lot of reagents on one FREND system.
The Vitamin D concentrations ranged from 20 to 1600 ng/mL. The results supported
the following statement in the labeling:
The FREND Vitamin D assay has been evaluated and no high dose hook effect was observed
for Vitamin D concentrations up to 1600 ng/mL.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed to compare the candidate device
(FREND Vitamin D Test System) to the predicate device (ARCHITECT Vitamin D
assay, k110619). A total of 133 native serum samples were tested by two operators in
singlicate at one clinical laboratory. Passing-Bablok regression analysis was
performed, as summarized below:
N Range (ng/mL) Slope (95% CI) Intercept (95% CI) r
133 13.3-91.3 1.069 -0.182 0.971
(1.001-1.117) (-1.561 – 1.106)
b. Matrix comparison:
The matrix comparison study was performed using 36 paired samples in the control
tube type (serum separator tube) and in the following tube types: lithium heparin
plasma, K EDTA plasma and citrate plasma tubes. The Passing-Bablok analysis for
3
results from each plasma tube type in comparison to serum separator tube results are
summarized below:
Lithium heparin plasma: y= 0.958x +0.067, r=0.995
K EDTA plasma: y= 0.991x -0.062, r=0.993
3
Citrate plasma: y=0.937x + 0.700, r=0.995
The results of the matrix comparison study support the sponsor claims that all the
tube types tested above are acceptable for use with the FREND Vitamin D assay.
