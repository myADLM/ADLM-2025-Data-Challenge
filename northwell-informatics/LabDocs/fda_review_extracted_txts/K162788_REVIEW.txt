L. Test Principle:
The test is performed as a solid phase immunoassay. Controls, calibrators and patient sera are incubated
in the β2-GPI antigen coated wells to allow specific antibodies present in the serum to bind to the
antigen. Unbound antibodies and other serum proteins are removed by washing the microplate wells.
Bound antibodies are detected by adding an enzyme-labeled anti-human IgA, IgG or IgM conjugate or
combined anti-human IgA/IgG/IgM conjugate to the microplate wells. Unbound conjugate is removed
by washing. Enzyme substrate (TMB) is then added to the wells and the presence of antibodies is

detected by a color change produced by the conversion of TMB substrate to a colored reaction product.
The reaction is stopped and the intensity of the color change, which is proportional to the concentration
of antibody, is read by a spectrophotometer at 450 nm. Results are expressed in ELISA units per
milliliter (EU/mL) and reported as positive or negative.
Semi-quantitative results are determined from a series of five calibrators (160 EU/mL, 80 EU/mL, 40
EU/mL, 20 EU/mL, and 1 EU/mL). Values less than 20 EU/mL are considered negative results while
values greater than 25 EU/mL are considered positive; results between 20 EU/mL and 25 EU/mL are
considered ‘indeterminate’. The sponsor states the following recommendations in the Package Insert:
“Indeterminate results should be retested and evaluated along with other laboratory methods; and when a
negative result occurs in the presence of clinical indications or when indeterminate results are obtained,
lupus anti-coagulant and anti-cardiolipin antibody testing is recommended as additional testing.”
Qualitative results are determined using a ratio of the absorbance of the sample to the absorbance of the
cut-off calibrator (20 EU/mL). The ratio is multiplied by the concentration of the cut-off calibrator to
give a numerical value. Values greater than or equal to 20 EU/mL are considered positive and <20
EU/mL values are considered negative.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
The results of all studies met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Semi-Quantitative Precision:
Precision performance was evaluated in accordance with CLSI guideline EP05-A2. Native sera from
the Intended Use population that cover the analytical measuring range were tested and included
samples in the negative range, ~20% below cut-off, around the cut-off, ~20% above cut-off and
in the moderate positive range of the assays. All specimens were assayed 12 times on one day to
determine intra-assay repeatability. The same five specimens were also assayed across 13 runs
with six repetitions in each over a period of four weeks to assess reproducibility at three sites
using two sets of equipment. An additional 12 replicates were run on the first set of equipment
(total replicates = 90). Assays were performed by two operators using one reagent lot and
different equipment sets. The first operator performed the assay manually with a multi-channel
pipettor, microplate washer and microplate reader. The second operator used an automatic
system with a liquid handling system including a microplate reader. One assay lot was used for
the study. Tabulated below are the precision and reproducibility results:

b.Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity and recovery were tested by diluting positive specimens with equidistant dilutions
across the measuring range and comparing actual vs. expected results. The linear range of the
IgA assay was determined to be 3.6–160 EU/ml. The linear range of the IgG assay was
determined to be 3.1–160 EU/ml. The linear range of the IgM assay was determined to be 2.3–
160 EU/ml. Results of the linear regression analysis are summarized below:

High dose hook effect: High antibody concentrations specimens above 160 EU/mL were tested.
No hook effect was demonstrated in dilution sample levels up to 228.6 EU/mL for IgA; 597.6
EU/mL for IgG; and 605.5 EU/mL for IgM.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i. Traceability:
There are currently no recognized international standards for the measurement of β2-GP1
IgA, β2-GP1 IgG and β2-GP1 IgM antibodies. Calibrator and Control values are directly
traceable to in-house standards.
ii. Value Assignment:
Calibrators and Positive Controls are dilutions of pooled β2-GP1 IgA, β2-GP1 IgG or β2-
GP1 IgM antibody positive sera. IMMCO formulates new calibrator and control lots from an
array of antibody positive sera obtained from various commercial plasma centers. The
calibrators and controls are taken from different pooled sera. All source sera have been tested
and found negative for infectious disease as stated in the product insert. Manufactured
calibrator sets are stored in aliquots frozen at -70°C. As new lots of calibrators are developed,
comparison studies are performed to calibrate values against original calibrators.
iii. Stability:
Shelf life stability:
Accelerated and open kit stability studies for each device were performed on three lots of
components/reagents. Accelerated studies were conducted with materials incubated at 37°C.
In these conditions, one day is considered equivalent to one month stored at 2°–8°C.
Materials are removed from the incubator for testing at three-day intervals for a minimum of
21 days.
Data from accelerated stability study support an18-month shelf life stability claim. Real-time
stability testing is on-going.

Open Kit Stability:
For open kit stability studies, materials are opened and stored in a dark environment as required
for bench-top usage, then assayed at 15, 45 and 90 day intervals. Open vial stability studies
demonstrate opened reagents are stable at 45 days, but the sponsor chose a more restrictive one
month open kit stability claim.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and the Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined by following CLSI
EP17-A. Sixty samples of diluent were run as blank samples for LoB and six different normal
human sera for LoD were each assayed 10 times. The LoB was determined to be 2.6 EU/ml for
β2-GP1 IgA, 2.3 EU/mL for β2-GP1 IgG, 1.4 EU/mL for β2-GP1 IgM and 1.9 EU/mL β2-GP1
IgA/IgG/IgM. The LoD was determined to be 3.6 EU/mL for β2-GP1 IgA, 3.1 EU/mL for β2-
GP1 IgG, 2.3 EU/mL for β2-GP1 IgM and 2.7 for β2-GP1 IgA/IgG/IgM.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interference:
The studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A2. Interference was studied by mixing
sera with known β2-GP1 antibody levels with potentially interfering serum samples and
studying deviation from expected results. Known levels of antibodies included negative,
around the cut-off and low positive (i.e. 2–5 times the cut-off). No significant interference
was demonstrated in for β2-GP1 IgA, β2-GP1 IgG, β2-GP1 IgM or β2-GP1 IgA/IgG/IgM
with the following substances at the levels indicated: Hemoglobin (2 g/L), Bilirubin (342
µmol/L), Rheumatoid Factor (100 IU/mL), Triglycerides (37 mmol/L), Cholesterol (13
mmol/L), Heparin (3000 U/L), Acetylsalicylic Acid (3.62 mmol/L), Prednisone (0.84
µmol/L), Warfarin (32.5 µmol/L), Hydroxychloroquine (148 µmol/L), Rituximab (75
µg/mL) and Atorvastatin (600 µg EQ/L).
Cross-reactivity:
Numerous potentially cross-reactive autoimmune and infectious disease sera were
tested for B2GP1 antibodies for β2-GP1 IgA, β2-GP1 IgG, β2-GP1 IgM or β2-GP1
IgA/IgG/IgM. Results for each assay are provided in the following table:

The ‘Limitations of Procedure’ section of the Package Insert states: “A diagnosis cannot be made
on the basis of anti-B2GP1 results alone. The results of other laboratory tests supporting
diagnosis of APS, SLE and associated thrombotic conditions in at-risk patients, particularly
anticardiolipin antibody and lupus anticoagulant tests, must be considered along with clinical
findings.”
f. Assay cut-off:
The cutoff was established by testing a population of 62 normal healthy subjects (NHS) for β2-
GP1IgA, β2-GP1IgG, β2-GP1IgM and 60 NHS for β2-GP1IgA/IgG/IgM) and calculating the
mean of the normal subjects plus 2.5 SD for IgA, mean plus 3 SD for IgG, mean plus 2.5 for IgM
and mean plus 2 for IgA/IgG/IgM as supported by receiver operatory curve (ROC) analysis. The
cutoff was assigned an arbitrary value of 20 EU/mL.
β2-GP1 Interpretation
<20 EU/mL Negative
20 – 25 EU/mL Indeterminate (Borderline)*
>25 EU/mL Positive
*The B2GP1 IgA/IgG/IgM ELISA is qualitative and values greater than or equal to 20 EU/mL
are reported as positive.

a. Method comparison with predicate devices: ImmuLisa™ B2GP1 Antibody ELISAs were tested
in comparison with analogous Quanta Lite kits using sera from patients with autoimmune
diseases associated with β2-GP1 antibodies (disease-associated population: APS, SLE, APS with
SLE), patients with a suspected diagnosis of APS and SLE submitted for reference laboratory
testing and patients with infectious diseases and other autoimmune conditions (disease control
population). The number of specimens tested for each ImmuLisa™ B2GP1 Antibody ELISA
varies and is indicated in the respective tables.
Only specimens in the linear range of the assays were included in the method comparison.
Greater than 15% of the test cases were the cutoff of the assay. Normal human sera were
excluded from the method comparison.
The samples used in the method comparison study for the β2-GP1 IgA, β2-GP1 IgG, β2-GP1
IgM and β2-GP1 IgA/IgG/IgM are shown in the table below:

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Test results in a normal population are expected to be negative. A study of 174 normal, apparently
disease-free samples tested with the B2GP1 IgA assay yielded seven positive results (4.0%). A study
of 151 normal, apparently disease-free samples tested with the B2GP1 IgG yielded five positive
results (3.3%). A study of 151 normal, apparently disease-free samples tested with the B2GP1 IgM
assay yielded three positive results (2.0%). A study of 206 normal, apparently disease-free samples
tested with the B2GP1 IgA/IgG/IgM assay yielded seven positive results (3.4%).
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
