H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The ADAMS A1c HA-8180V system is intended for the quantitative determination of
hemoglobin A1c (IFCC mmol/mol and NGSP %) in human whole blood and hemolysate
samples using Ion-Exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
Hemoglobin A1c measurements obtained from the ADAMS A1c HA-8180V are used as
an aid in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, an aid in the identification of individuals
who may be at risk of developing diabetes mellitus, and for the monitoring of long-term
blood glucose control in individuals with diabetes mellitus. The ADAMS H1c HA-8180V
is intended for professional use only.
The CALIBRATOR 80 is for the calibration of the ADAMS A1c HA-8180V system used
for the quantitative determination of hemoglobin A1c in human whole blood and
hemolysate samples.
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only.
Special conditions for use statement(s):
Hemoglobin A1c tests should not be used as a diagnostic aid for diabetes in patients with
a hemoglobinopathy but normal red cell turnover (e.g. sickle cell trait).
Hemoglobin A1c tests should not be used as a diagnostic aid in patients with abnormal
red cell turnover (e.g. anemias from hemolysis and iron deficiency), or patients with iron
deficiency and hemolytic anemia, various hemoglobinopathies, thalassemias, hereditary
spherocytosis, malignancies, and severe chronic hepatic and renal disease.
Hemoglobin A1c tests should not be used as a diagnostic aid in pregnant women as it
reflects the average blood glucose level over the preceding 3 months (average life of a
red blood cell), and therefore may be falsely low during pregnancy or any other condition
associated with recent onset of hyperglycemia and/or decreased red cell survival.
Hemoglobin A1c testing should not be used to replace glucose testing for type 1 diabetes
in pediatric patients and in pregnant women.
Hemoglobin A1c testing should not be used in the diagnosis of gestational diabetes.
Hemoglobin A1c testing should not be used in patients with homozygous sickle cell trait,
hemolytic anemia or other hemolytic diseases, or in patients with a recent significant

blood loss.
In cases of rapidly evolving type 1 diabetes the increase of HbA1c values might be
delayed compared to the acute increase in glucose concentrations. In these conditions
diabetes mellitus must be diagnosed based on plasma glucose concentration and/or the
typical clinical symptoms.
The results of interference studies performed to evaluate the effect of hemoglobin
variants on the HbA1c measurement show there is no significant interference for HbA2
concentrations of less than or equal to 16%, HbC concentrations of less than or equal to
39%, HbD concentrations of less than or equal to 36%, HbE concentrations of less than
or equal to 30%, HbF concentrations of less than or equal to 30%, and HbS
concentrations of less than or equal to 40%.
For prescription use only.

I. Device Description:
The ADAMS HA-8180V HbA1c system includes two levels of calibrators, diluents used
to reconstitute the calibrators, three eluent solutions, a washing solution, and a control
dilution set (used for sample dilutions and control material preparation). The components
are described below:
CALIBRATOR 80: A boxed set of two levels of calibrator material, CALBRATOR 80
Low and CALIBRATOR 80 High, which are single use, lyophilized calibrators from
human-sourced hemoglobin used to calibrate the HA-8180V analyzer. CALIBRATOR
80 Low has a concentration of approximately 5.5% HbA1c (NGSP) and CALIBRATOR
80 High has a concentration of approximately 11.5% HbA1c (NGSP).
CALIBRATOR 80 Diluent: Phosphate- buffered containing surfactant used to
reconstitute CALIBRATOR 80 Low and High.
Eluent 80A, Eluent 80B, and Eluent 80CV: Phosphate-buffered solution containing
<0.06% sodium azide as preservative used in the chromatographic separation of
hemoglobin fractions by elution through column.
Hemolysis Washing Solution 80H: Phosphate-buffered solution containing a surfactant
and <0.02% sodium azide as a preservative, used for on-board hemolysis of whole
blood samples.
Diluent 80: Phosphate-buffered solution containing a surfactant used for the dilution of
liquid controls and whole blood samples.

L. Test Principle:
Hemoglobin test specimens are prepared by automated dilution (1:101) of anticoagulated
whole blood in hemolysis washing solution 80H. Alternatively, hemolysates may be
prepared “off-line” by manual dilution of anticoagulated whole blood with the diluent 80
provided in control dilution set 80. The sample is then injected into the column, which
contains a filter to remove sample impurities. The differing polarity and ionic charges of the
released hemoglobin fractions bind with variable strength to the negatively charged
stationary phase of the column. The mobile phase, consisting of three eluents of increasing
ionic strength, is injected into the column. Hemoglobin fractions eluted from the column are
identified and quantified using light absorption, and are measured at 420 nm and 500 nm.
The dual wavelength colorimetric analysis of the separated peaks is processed by a
microcomputer to obtain peak identification and hemoglobin fraction quantitation.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed in accordance to CLSI EP05 by testing 4
concentrations of unaltered K2-EDTA whole blood samples at the following targeted
HbA1c values: ~5%, ~6.5%, ~8% and ~12%. Three levels of controls were also
tested. Each sample was tested as whole blood and as hemolysates. All samples
were run on three HA-8180V analyzers, each with three lots of each reagent. The
aliquots of each sample type were tested in duplicate in two runs on each analyzer per
day over a course of 20 days for a total of 720 results per sample. The results are
summarized in the tables below for both whole blood and hemolysate applications in
NGSP units (%HbA1c) and IFCC units (mmol/mol).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the HA-8180V system was evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP6-
A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical
Approach; Approved Guideline. Linearity across the reportable range was performed
using K2-EDTA whole blood patient samples ranging from 3% to 19% (9.3-184.2
mmol/mol) HbA1c. Intermediate HbA1c concentration samples were prepared by
performing equal distance dilutions of the high HbA1c sample with the low HbA1c
sample. The sample concentrations tested were as follows: 3.0, 4.6, 6.2, 7.8, 9.4, 10.9,
12.5, 14.1, 15.7, 17.37, and 19.0 % HbA1c (9.3, 26.8, 44.3, 61.8, 79.2, 96.7, 114.2,
131.7, 149.2, 166.7, and 184.2 mmol/mol). The samples were tested in replicates of
three.
The following linear regression equations were obtained:
NGSP: y= 0.9958x + 0.0064, R2=0.999
IFCC: y= 0.9958x – 0.0275, R2=0.999
The linearity study supports the measuring range for this device of 4.0-15.0% HbA1c
(20-140 mmol/mol HbA1c)

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The ADAMS HbA1c test method is traceable to the Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial Reference Method through The National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP) and has received NGSP certification. See the NGSP
website for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) units of mmol/mol are
calculated using the Master Equation NGSP (%) =0.09148 x IFCC (mmol/mol) +
2.52. HbA1c results are provided to the customers using two different units: NGSP
equivalent units (%) and IFCC equivalent units (mmol/mol).
CALIBRATOR 80 Value Assignment:
The value assignment for the ADAMS H1c HA-8180V Calibrators is traceable to the
IFCC reference method. Using an ADAMS A1c HA-8180V instrument calibrated
with standard material JCCRM-411 (provided by ReCCS), CALIBRATOR 80 Low
and High are value assigned by measuring each calibrator 9 times per day over 3 days
for a total of 27 values. The mean generated over the 3 days is used as the reference
value for each calibrator.
The HbA1c values for the CALIBRATOR 80 are lot specific and target the following
% HbA1c concentrations:
CALIBRATOR 80 Low: 5.0-6.0% HbA1c
CALIBRATOR 80 High: 10.0-11.0% HbA1c
CALIBRATOR 80 Stability:
Shelf life: The shelf-life stability study protocol and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found to be acceptable to support the sponsor’s shelf-life stability claim
that un-opened CALIBRATOR 80 is stable for 18 months when stored at 2-8oC.
Open vial: The open-vial stability study protocol and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found to be acceptable to support the sponsor’s open-vial stability claim
that upon reconstitution, CALIBRATOR 80 may be stored at 2-8oC for 8 hours. The
calibrators are intended for single use only.
d. Detection limit:
The claimed measuring range, 4.0% to 15.0% HbA1c (20 to 140 mmol/mol), was
validated by the linearity study.

i.) Interference
The effect of various potential interfering substances on the HA-8180V HbA1c
results was evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP7-A2, Interference Testing in
Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline-Second Edition.
with HbA1c values of 6.5% Human whole blood K2-EDTA samples HbA1c and ~8%
HbA1c were analyzed by spiking the interfering substance into each of the two whole
blood samples. Samples were analyzed in replicates of ten on the HA-8180V test
system and the results were compared to the reference sample (sample containing no
interferent). The sponsor defines significant interference as ≥ +/-7% change in
%HbA1c value from the control value. The following substances showed no
significant interference at the concentrations described below:

ii.) Cross Reactivity:
Potential interferences from acetylated hemoglobin (Hb), carbamylated Hb, and labile
HbA1c were evaluated using Human whole blood K2- EDTA samples with HbA1c
values of 6.5%, and 8.0 %. Aliquots of the 6.5% and 8.0% HbA1c samples were
spiked with 12.5, 25, 37.5, and 50 mg/dL acetaldehyde solution evaluate the effects of

acetylated hemoglobin; 6.25, 12.5, 18.75, and 25 mg/dL of sodium cyanate solution
was added to the A1c samples to evaluate the effects of carbamylated hemoglobin;
and 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mg/dL glucose solution were added to the A1c
samples to evaluate the effects of Labile A1c. The samples were allowed to incubate
for two hours at 37o C prior to testing. The samples were run in replicates of ten on
one HA-8180V analyzer and the results were compared to the reference sample
(sample containing no added solutions). Significant interference was defined as %
recovery ≥ +/-7% of the expected 100% recovery.
The results were concluded as follows:
· Acetylated Hb (up to 50 mg/dL) does not interfere with this assay.
· Carbamylated Hb (up to 25 mg/dL) does not interfere with this assay.
· Labile HbA1c (up to 2000 mg/dL) does not interfere with this assay.
iii.) Hemoglobin Variant Interference:
The effect of various hemoglobin variants on the HA-8180V results was evaluated to
determine if the variants interfere with HbA1c results. To assess the effects of
hemoglobin variant interference, a total of 165 K2-EDTA whole blood samples
known to contain Hemoglobin variants A , C, D, E, F and S were tested on the HA-
2
8180V and results compared to a NGSP boronate affinity HPLC reference method
that has been demonstrated to be free from interference by the hemoglobin variants
(Trinity Biotech Ultra2 A1c for HbC, HbD, HbE, and Tosoh G8 HPLC for HbF and
HbA2). A minimum of 10 samples were tested in duplicate at each of the two HbA1c
concentrations of ~6.5% and ~8.0% containing the Hemoglobin variants A2, C, D, E,
F, and S. The table below shows the number and concentrations of the variants and
HbA1c concentrations that were tested.

Total Error Near Cutoff
Using the results of bias estimation (%Bias) in the method comparison study and
precision estimated in the reproducibility study, Total Error (TE) at four
concentrations: (5.0%,6.5%, 8.0% and 12%) was calculated as follows:
%TE =|%Bias| + 1.96 x %CV x (1+ (%Bias/100). The results are presented in the
tables below:

b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed to evaluate the effects of the different
anticoagulants, K2-EDTA and K3-EDTA, on %HbA1c measurement by the
ADAMS A1c HA-8180V system. Venous whole blood specimens with
concentrations spanning 4.7 to15.7% HbA1c were collected in K2-EDTA (reference
anticoagulant) and K3-EDTA blood tubes from a total of 40 donors. The samples
were measured on the candidate device and the results were compared. The
following regression equation was obtained :
y=1.005x-0.047, R2=1.000
The results of the study support the sponsor ’s claim that blood samples collected in
blood collection tubes containing K2-EDTA and K3-EDTA anti-coagulants are

3. Specimen Identification:
Manual sample identification or internal barcode reader
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Hemoglobin test specimens are prepared by automated dilution (1:101) of anticoagulated
venous whole blood in hemolysis washing solution 80H. Alternately, hemolysates may
be prepared “off-line” by manual dilution of anticoagulated venous whole blood with the
diluent 80 provided in control dilution set 80. The samples are placed in plastic racks and
placed on the analyzer.
5. Calibration:
Automatic calibration: The analyzer measures two HbA1c standard solutions
(CALIBRATOR 80 Low and High solutions), and uses the results to automatically
determine the calibration coefficients. Standard values of the standard solutions can be
set by entering the numbers using numeric buttons, or reading the calibration information
barcodes during measurement when using the internal barcode reader.
6. Quality Control:
Recommendations for quality control are described in the labeling. Additionally, users should
follow local, state and federal regulations.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not applicable.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
