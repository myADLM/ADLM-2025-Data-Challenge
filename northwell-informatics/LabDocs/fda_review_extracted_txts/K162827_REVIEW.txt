H. Intended Use:
1. Intended Use:
VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT (PCT) is an automated test for use on the instruments
of the VIDAS family for the determination of human procalcitonin in human
serum or plasma (lithium heparinate) using the ELFA (Enzyme-Linked
Fluorescent Assay) technique.
Used in conjunction with other laboratory findings and clinical assessments,
VIDAS B•R•A•H•M•S PCT is intended for use as follows:
· to aid in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of
ICU admission for progression to severe sepsis and septic shock,
· to aid in assessing the cumulative 28-day risk of all-cause mortality for
patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock in the ICU or when
obtained in the emergency department or other medical wards prior to ICU
admission, using a change in PCT level over time,
· to aid in decision making on antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected
or confirmed lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) defined as
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute bronchitis, and acute
exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) – in an
inpatient setting or an emergency department,
· to aid in decision making on antibiotic discontinuation for patients with
suspected or confirmed sepsis.
2. Indications for use:
Same as Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
Warnings and Precautions:
· VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT (PCT) is not indicated to be used as a stand-
alone diagnostic assay and should be used in conjunction with clinical signs
and symptoms of infection and other diagnostic evidence.
· Decisions regarding antibiotic therapy should NOT be based solely on
procalcitonin concentrations.
· PCT results should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical
status of the patient and other laboratory results. Changes in PCT levels for
the prediction of mortality, and overall mortality, are strongly dependent on
2

--- Page 3 ---
many factors, including pre-existing patient risk factors and clinical course.
· The need to continue ICU care at Day 4 and other covariates (e.g., age and
SOFA score) are also significant predictors of 28-day cumulative mortality
risk.
· Certain patient characteristics, such as severity of renal failure or
insufficiency, may influence procalcitonin values and should be considered
as potentially confounding clinical factors when interpreting PCT values.
· Increased PCT levels may be observed in severe illness such as
polytrauma, burns, major surgery, prolonged or cardiogenic shock.
· PCT levels may not be elevated in patients infected by certain atypical
pathogens, such as Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma
pneumoniae.
· The safety and performance of PCT-guided therapy for individuals younger
than age 17 years, pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals or
those on immunomodulatory agents, was not formally analyzed in the
supportive clinical trials.

L. Test Principle:
The assay principle combines a one-step immunoassay sandwich method with a final
fluorescent detection (ELFA). The Solid Phase Receptacle (SPR) serves as the solid
phase as well as the pipetting device. Reagents for the assay are ready-to-use and pre-
dispensed in the sealed reagent strips. All of the assay steps are performed
automatically by the instrument. The sample is transferred into the wells containing
anti-procalcitonin antibodies labeled with alkaline phosphatase (conjugate). The
sample/conjugate mixture is cycled in and out of the SPR several times. This operation
enables the antigen to bind with the immunoglobulins fixed to the interior wall of the
SPR and the conjugate to form a sandwich. Unbound compounds are eliminated
during washing steps.
Two detection steps are performed successively. During each step, the substrate (4-
Methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate) is cycled in and out of the SPR. The conjugate
enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of this substrate into a fluorescent product (4-Methyl-
umbelliferone) the fluorescence of which is measured at 450 nm. The intensity of the
fluorescence is proportional to the concentration of antigen present in the sample. At
the end of the assay, results are automatically calculated by the instrument in relation
to two calibration curves corresponding to the two detection steps. A fluorescence
threshold value determines the calibration curve to be used for each sample. The
results are then printed out.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance
Most analytical performance metrics of the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT (PCT) assay
were previously established in K071146 and K160911, and are not affected by the
additional claims. (K071146 was one of two predicates for K160911.) Supplementary
analytical studies were performed to support the new claims. These include:
· Precision –VIDAS instrument
· Precision – VIDAS 3 instrument
· Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
· Interference Testing

--- Page 8 ---
· Reproducibility/Precision:
The purpose of this study was to supplement previous precision studies
(submitted in K071146 and K160911) to more fully establish performance at
the low end of the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT (PCT) assay measuring range.
For both the VIDAS and VIDAS 3, the precision panel consisted of five frozen
human serum samples to provide additional coverage between 0.05 – 0.25
ng/mL for the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT (PCT) assay. The precision was
evaluated on VIDAS and VIDAS 3 instruments over 20 days at three internal
labs acting as three testing sites (2 R&D labs and 1 Clinical Affairs lab). The
study was designed based on CLSI EP5-A3 "Evaluation of Precision of
Quantitative Measurement Procedures; Approved guideline – Third Edition.”
The following variation sources were taken into account in the evaluation:
replicate, run, day, calibration, reagent lot, instrument and site. Each precision
sample was tested in 2 replicates, in 2 runs per day by trained operators for 20
days on the VIDAS (and VIDAS 3) instruments installed at the three testing
sites. Two reagent lots were used (10 testing days per reagent lot). For each lot,
two separate calibration events were performed (5 testing days per calibration
event and per lot) with total of 6 calibrations per lot (3 consecutive calibrations
per calibration event). Data analyses were performed for each sample
separately, by site and for all sites combined, as follows:
· Variance components (SD and %CV) were estimated using the REML
method,
· Variance components were combined to yield estimates of the precision
characteristics,
· 95% CI for overall precision estimates were computed according to
Chi-square method and Satterthwaite degrees of freedom.
Precision-VIDAS instrument: For the VIDAS instrument, one highly discordant
value on sample PP13 was observed during the study. The highly discordant
result was treated as a statistical outlier and analyses both with and without the
highly discordant values was performed. The outlier largely affected the
repeatability estimates for sample PP13; the outlier increased the %CV +18.4%
(8.5% to 26.9%) locally at site 1 and +8.8% (9.8% to 18.6%) globally. A
precision profile analysis demonstrated the outlier introduced bias into the
precision estimates of sample PP13. The precision results without the outlier
were considered as the unbiased estimates of precision and as the definitive
estimates. Precision estimates were uniform across the 3 sites for all samples, so
the 3 sites were combined to produce more robust precision estimates. The
precision performance characteristics of the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT (PCT)
assay for the five samples tested are indicated in the following table.

Precision VIDAS 3 instrument: For the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT (PCT)
assay on the VIDAS 3 instrument, one highly discordant value on PP12 was
observed during the study. The highly discordant result was treated as a
statistical outlier and analyses both with and without the highly discordant value
were performed. The outlier affected the repeatability estimates for sample
PP12 by increasing %CV to +79.5% (13.1% to 92.6%) locally at site 3 and
+44.9% (12.7% to 57.6%) globally. The precision results without the outlier
were considered as the unbiased estimates of precision and as the definitive

See K160911: Linearity was confirmed in the range of 0.05 ng/mL to 200
ng/mL. The measuring range claim for the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT (PCT)
assay is 0.05 – 100 ng/mL. For PCT concentrations greater than 200 ng/mL, the
measurement range can be extended up to 2000 ng/mL by one 1:10 dilution of
the sample.
Due to an administrative error, the measuring range was previously stated as 0.02 –
100 ng/mL.

The Total Error (TE), bias and precision CV was evaluated for PCT
concentrations at the lower end of the assay measuring range (0.03 - 0.30
ng/mL) including the 2 proposed clinical decision cut-offs for the LRTI claim
(0.10 and 0.25 ng/mL).The study was based upon CLSI EP17-A2 guideline
“Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement
Procedures; Approved Guideline, Second Edition”. Seven low-level samples
covering the lower end of the measuring range (0.03 to 0.30 ng/mL) were
prepared by dilution of PCT Standards used for Master Calibration in human
serum. The samples were tested in 32 replicates (8 replicates per day for 4
days) on one VIDAS and one VIDAS 3 instruments using one VIDAS
B·R·A·H·M·S PCT (PCT) reagent lot. Two calibrations were performed on
each instrument, with 2 days of test per calibration. The data analysis process
included, for each low level sample, the detection/treatment of outlier and the
evaluation of the % bias, % CV and % TE (Westgard model). These results
were interpreted with respect to the two medical cut-offs values and the current
LoQ at 0.05 ng/mL.

· Interfering Substances:
Interfering substances were evaluated using the VIDAS B.R.A.H.M.S PCT
(PCT) assay with four serum substances (bilirubin, hemoglobin, lipids and
human albumin) and 36 exogenous substances (drugs). The Interference
studies followed the principles of CLSI EP7-A2 guideline, “Interference
Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline - Second edition”. The
study was carried out on one VIDAS instrument with one VIDAS
B.R.A.H.M.S PCT (PCT) lot at four different concentrations of procalcitonin:
• ~0.10 ng/mL corresponding to a clinical decision value for Low
Respiratory Tract Infection
• ~0.20 ng/mL close to the clinical decision value for Low Respiratory
Tract Infection
• ~2.0 ng/mL corresponding to a clinical decision value for sepsis
• ~150 ng/mL close to the high level of the measuring range
Table 6: Acceptance criteria for Interference Effects
Procalcitonin level Acceptance criteria
A (~ 0.10 ng/mL) ≤ 0.02 ng/mL
B (~0.20 ng/mL) ≤ 10%
C (~2.0 ng/mL) ≤ 10%
D (~150 ng/mL) ≤ 10%
The effect of interfering substances on assay performance was established for
all combinations of serum substances, potential interferents and PCT
concentrations.
Serum substances: When tested at procalcitonin levels A, B, C and D,
bilirubin, hemoglobin and triglycerides demonstrated no significant
interference at the tested concentrations, which were 33 mg/dL (574 μmol/L),
600 mg/dL (347 μmol/L), and 3000 mg/dL respectively. When tested at a
concentration of 9000 mg/dL, human albumin demonstrated:
· At procalcitonin level A: acceptance criteria not met, interference
resulted in decreased procalcitonin values.
· At procalcitonin level B, C and D: acceptance criteria met; no
significant interference observed.
Further evaluation of human albumin was conducted. No significant
interference was observed up to the human albumin concentration of 6500
mg/dL, including intrinsic human albumin of the sample. Above this
concentration, the interference decreases the measured procalcitonin
concentration.

For the cut-offs 0.25, 0.50, and 2.00 ng/mL, the percent agreements
between KRYPTOR and VIDAS were acceptable. The kappa coefficients
were >0.87 demonstrating agreement between both assays at these cut-offs.
For the 0.10 ng/mL cut-off, the overall percent agreement between
KRYPTOR and VIDAS was 86.7% which was considered acceptable, with
the understanding that discordant results did not differ by more than one
level (for example, a sample inferior to 0.1 ng/mL with VIDAS was not
higher than 0.25 ng/mL with KRYPTOR). The kappa coefficient was
0.7309, and did not conform to the acceptance criteria. However, this result
was considered acceptable as a kappa coefficient above 0.61 represents
acceptable agreement. These study results showed some amount of
disagreement between two assays around cutoff 0.1 and 0.25.
2. Clinical Studies
To establish performance of the device for use as an aid in decision making on
antibiotic therapy for LRTI and sepsis, systematic literature reviews were
performed with both study and patient-level data. The meta-analyses were
conducted after comprehensive publication searches of the PubMed and Cochrane
Database of Systematic Reviews with the selection of articles defined by a
standardized set of inclusion and exclusion criteria, established prior to the
literature search. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment tool was used to assess
the quality of the publications included in the final meta-analyses. To assess for the
presence of bias, funnel plots were constructed and did not identify visual evidence
of publication bias. The study data were analyzed according to a pre-specified
statistical analysis plan, using both fixed and random effects models.
In lieu of diagnostic accuracy, the primary endpoints of the meta-analysis included
antibiotic exposure, initiation and duration. Safety endpoints were evaluated
including mortality, complications and hospital length of stay. For LRTI, eleven
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 4,090 subjects were included in the study-
level analysis, and thirteen RCTs with 3,142 subjects were included in the patient-
level analysis. Overall, PCT-guided therapy resulted in a 19.2% reduction in
relative antibiotic initiation, a 1.25 – 2.9 day reduction in antibiotic duration, 2.79
– 3.6 day reduction in antibiotic exposure, without a significant increases in
mortality, complications or hospital length of stay.

*The # of patients evaluated indicates the total number of patients included in the evaluation.
**Antibiotic use is defined as the combination of the data from: antibiotic exposure (5 RCTs), antibiotic duration
(3 RCTs) and 1 RCT whose definition (exposure or duration) was unclear.
***Mortality was defined per the individual RCT from which the data was extracted.
PCT-guided therapy resulted in decreased antibiotic use in patients with CAP,
acute bronchitis and AECOPD. For inpatients, there was a 38% decrease in
antibiotic exposure and 51% reduction in antibiotic exposure in patients from the
Emergency Department (Figure 1). All studies allowed clinicians to override the
PCT algorithm if they felt a patient needed antibiotics. Among the subset of
studies that reported adherence to the PCT algorithm, adherence ranged from 59 –
91%. Adherence-adjusted outcomes were examined as part of the statistical
analysis plan, and did not identify significant differences between studies. During
the patient-level data analysis, subjects who did not have LRTI were excluded (e.g.
URI, sepsis, etc.). Additional analyses of outpatient subpopulations were
conducted, but it was concluded that the studies were not generalizable and
therefore could not validate the proposed intended use claims. Outpatient data,
with the exception of that which was acquired from patents in the emergency
department, was subsequently excluded from further analysis.

Taken from slide CO-61 from BMx Presentation during November 10, 2016 Microbiology Devices
Panel Meeting.
A modified Desirability of Outcome Ranking/Response Adjusted for Days of
Antibiotic Risk (DOOR/RADAR) analysis was conducted on the LRTI data.
Patient outcomes were ranked as follows: 7 - death; 6 - ICU admission within 30
days; 5 - Disease-specific complications within 30 days; 4 - Rehospitalization
within 30 days of entry into the study; 3 - Recurrent or worsening of infection
within 30 days; 2 - Symptoms of ongoing infection within 30 days; 1 - No
symptoms of ongoing infection within 30 days. Patients with a similar RADAR
rank were considered to have a better outcome if they had a shorter duration of
antibiotic therapy. The DOOR/RADAR analysis demonstrated a statistically
significant improvement in outcomes for PCT-guided therapy for all patients and
patient subpopulations.

The safety analysis of PCT-guided therapy did not identify increases in mortality,
complications or hospital length of stay. Complications were defined as ICU
admissions, hospitalization or re-hospitalization, recurrent or worsening infection,
acute respiratory infection-specific complications and death. No clinical
subpopulations demonstrated a difference in the safety of PCT-guided therapy for
inpatients or patients managed in the Emergency Room. The data were insufficient
to draw conclusions for the proposed use in outpatients.

*The # of patients evaluated indicates the total number of patients included in the evaluation.
**Mortality was defined per the individual RCT from which the data was extracted.
***Four patients evaluated for mortality were not evaluated for ICU length of stay.
PCT-guided therapy resulted in decreased antibiotic duration and exposure. There
was a 23% reduction in antibiotic exposure in septic patients managed with PCT
(Figure 2). All studies allowed clinicians to override the PCT algorithm, if they felt
a patient needed antibiotics. Among the subset of studies that reported adherence,
the adherence ranged from 47 – 91%. Adherence-adjusted outcomes were
examined as part of the statistical analysis plan, and did not identify significant
differences between studies. For the patient-level data, subjects who did not meet
inclusion criteria were excluded.
Due to an administrative error, the adherence rate was previously stated as 47-81%
instead of 47-91%.

**Effect could not be estimated due to missing outcomes.
An additional analysis was conducted comparing published literature using the
VIDAS to other PCT assays where no significant difference was observed. Other
analyses included stratification by risk of bias (random effects vs. fixed effects
model), year of publication, PCT algorithm adherence, primary diagnosis and
definition of antibiotic exposure. Meta-regressions were performed to determine if
individual studies or study characteristics had a significant effect were conducted,
as well as sensitivity analyses for the effect of individual studies. No trends were
observed in the meta-regressions and stratifications, although the small number of
studies limited the conclusions that could be drawn.
3. Warnings and Precautions:
The following warnings and precautions were included within the package insert.
References to the published literature are provided for each.
· Some patient characteristics, such as severity of renal failure or
insufficiency, may influence procalcitonin values and should be considered
as potentially confounding clinical factors when interpreting PCT values.
The effects of renal failure on procalcitonin values are unclear from a
review of the literature. Some literature suggests that severe renal failure

may significantly increase procalcitonin values, however, this remains an
area for further investigation.
· PCT levels may not be elevated in patients infected by certain atypical
pathogens, such as Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma
pneumoniae.
A previous study of 106 patients with viral and atypical bacterial infections
found the median PCT value to be 0.09 ng/mL (IQR 0.06 – 0.17). Other
studies of atypical organisms have suggested also that PCT values can be
low or only mildly elevated compared to typical bacterial infections. The
lack of specificity for viral and atypical pathogens may represent a further
confounding factor for the clinical interpretation of PCT values.
4. Clinical Cut-offs:
The following cut-offs are unchanged from prior 510(k) submissions.
a. 28-day mortality:
· ΔPCT ≤ 80%
A decrease in the PCT levels below or equal to 80% defines a positive
ΔPCT test result representing a higher risk for 28-day all-cause
mortality of patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock.
· ΔPCT > 80%
A decrease in the PCT levels of more than 80% defines a negative
ΔPCT test result representing a lower risk for 28-day all-cause
mortality of patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock.
b. Progression Risk:
· PCT > 2 ng/mL
A PCT level above 2.0 ng/mL on the first day of ICU admission is
associated with a high risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic
shock.
· PCT < 0.5 ng/mL
A PCT level below 0.5 ng/mL on the first day of ICU admission is
associated with a low risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic
shock.

c. LRTI Antibiotic Decision Making:
· PCT < 0.10 ng/mL
Antibiotic therapy strongly discouraged.
· PCT 0.10-0.25 ng/mL
Antibiotic therapy discouraged.
· PCT 0.26-0.50 ng/mL
Antibiotic therapy encouraged.
· PCT >0.50 ng/mL
Antibiotic therapy strongly encouraged.
· PCT ≤ 0.25 ng/mL
Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued
· ΔPCT > 80%
Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued
d. Sepsis Antibiotic Discontinuation:
· ΔPCT > 80%
Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued
· PCT ≤ 0.50 ng/mL
Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued
Due to an administrative error, the cut-off for LRTI antibiotic discontinuation (PCT ≤
0.25 ng/mL or ∆PCT > 80%) were originally omitted.
5. Expected Values/Reference Range:
See K160911. A study was performed using the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT
(PCT) test on serum samples from apparently healthy male (N=98) and female
(N=102) subjects. The normal values corresponding to the 95th and 99th percentiles
were < 0.05 ng/mL and 0.09 ng/mL respectively.
