L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys Vitamin D total II assay employs a competitive protein binding assay which uses
Vitamin D Binding Protein for detection of 25-OH Vitamin D. The sample is treated with
pretreatment reagent in the first incubation period. This releases vitamin D from the
endogenous vitamin D binding protein present in the patient’s sample. In the next incubation,
vitamin D binding protein labeled with ruthenium is added and a complex is formed between

the 25-OH Vitamin D and the ruthenylated vitamin D binding protein. In the 3rd and final
incubation, streptavidin-coated microparticles are added along with 25-OH Vitamin D
labeled with biotin. Any unbound ruthenium labeled vitamin D binding proteins become
occupied with biotin-labeled vitamin D (25-OH). The complex consisting of the ruthenylated
vitamin D binding protein and the biotinylated vitamin D (25-OH) becomes bound to the
solid phase via interaction of the biotin and streptavidin. The reaction mixture is aspirated
into the measuring cell where the electrochemiluminescence emission is detected. Results are
determined using a calibration curve that is generated on each instrument by a 2 point
calibration provided with the reagent bar code.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated on a single cobas e411 analyzer according to CLSI guideline
EP5-A3 using one reagent lot for evaluation. The protocol consisted of testing 2
replicates of two levels of control, PreciControl Vitamin D total II, and five human
serum samples per run, 2 runs per day for 21 days (n=84). The samples were run in
randomized order on the cobas e 411 analyzer. Serum samples used were all single
donors (native as well as spiked).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study on the Elecsys Vitamin D total II was performed according to
CLSI guideline EP06-A. A linearity sample set was prepared by diluting a high 25-
OH vitamin D concentration serum and K3-EDTA plasma sample (single donors,
spiked) with a depleted serum/plasma sample with a low 25-OH vitamin D
concentration to obtain 11 concentrations throughout the measuring range. Samples
were assayed in triplicate within a single run and analyzed by linear regression.

Standardization and Traceability
This method is in the process of being standardized in accordance with the Vitamin D
Standardization Program (VDSP). The VDSP is an international collaborative effort
to standardize the laboratory measurement of serum 25-OH vitamin D. This
collaboration involves the coordinated efforts of the National Institutes of Health,
Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes for Standards and Technology (NIST),
Ghent University, and other institutions. Please refer to
http://ods.od.nih.gov/Research/VitaminD.aspx for more information on the VDSP
program.
CalSet value assignment:
The CalSet Vitamin D total II assigned values are determined with the Elecsys
Vitamin D total II assay. The CalSet Vitamin D total II is traceable to the ID-LC-
MS/MS 25- hydroxyvitamin D Reference Measurement Procedure. The ID-LC-
MS/MS is traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Standard
Reference Material 2972. A native human serum sample panel (single donors) with
RMP-assigned target values (RMP = Reference Measurement Procedure: ID-LC-
MS/MS of the University of Ghent) is used for Reference Standardization to assign
values to the Master Calibrators (sample curve consisting of human serum samples
from single donors covering the entire measuring range).
For each CalSet Vitamin D total II manufactured, the calibrators are run in duplicate
on at least three (3) cobas e 411 analyzers and at least two (2) MODULAR
ANALYTICS E170/cobas e 601/cobas e 602 analyzers with all Vitamin D total II
reagent lots available. The assigned value of each calibrator is defined as the median
value obtained over at least six (6) runs on at least three (3) analyzers of the
respective calibrator.The assigned values for CalSet Vitamin D total II are read from
the master calibration curve. The values must fall within specified acceptable ranges
for each lot.
Control value assignment:
The PreciControl Vitamin D total II assigned values are determined with the Elecsys
Vitamin D total II assay. The assigned values for PreciControl Vitamin D total II are
read from the master calibration curve. Values are assigned for each lot of
PreciControl Vitamin D total II in combination with each assay reagent lot available.
The controls are run in duplicate on the MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 /cobas e
601/cobas e602 Analyzers. The assigned values obtained on the additional analyzer
(cobas e 411) are compared to those obtained on the master analyzer platform (cobas
e 601). The assigned value of each control level is defined as the median value
obtained over at least six (6) determinations of the respective control level.

--- Page 11 ---
CalCheck value assignment:
For each CalCheck Vitamin D total II lot manufactured, the CalChecks are run in
duplicate on at least two cobas analyzers with at least two runs. The assigned value

Based on this study, the sponsor defined the Limit of Blank as 2 ng/mL.
Limit of Detection
To determine the Limit of Detection (LoD), 5 low level diluted serum pools were
measured using 3 reagents lots over 3 days, 2 runs per day, on one cobas e 411
analyzer with two replicates per sample per run for total measurements of 36. LoD
was calculated according to as the following equation: LoD = LoB + 1.653 x SD total
(of low analyte samples).
Based on this study, the sponsor defined the Limit of Detection as 3 ng/mL.
Limit of Quantitation
To determine the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ), intermediate precision was used to
calculate the LoQ for serum as well as Li-Heparin, K2-EDTA, K3-EDTA plasma
samples. Below are the studies for Serum and Plasma samples:
Serum: A minimum of 6 low level samples were prepared (native human serum
samples as well as diluted) with concentrations around the expected LoQ. Each
sample was evaluated in five replicates per run, three reagent lots, one run per day
over five days (n=25 per sample).
Li-Heparin: 5 samples were evaluated in five replicates per run, one lot, one run per
day over five days (n=25 per sample).
K2 and K3-EDTA: 7 samples were evaluated in five replicates per run, one lot, one
run per day over five days (n=35 per sample).
The LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration with an inter-assay precision of
≤ 20% CV. Based on this study, the sponsor defined the Limit of Quantitation as
5 ng/mL.
Detection limits results:
Limit of Blank Limit of Detection Limit of Quantitation
2 ng/mL 3 ng/mL 5 ng/mL
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interferences:
Potential interference from endogenous substances was evaluated. For each
interfering substance, 3 serum samples containing low (10 ng/mL), mid (30 ng/mL),
and high (70 ng/mL) concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were tested. An aliquot
of each serum sample was spiked with the interfering substances. Another aliquot
without any additives was used as the dilution pool. The interfering pool was diluted
12

into the dilution pool in 10% increments. For bilirubin, 90% bilirubin and 10%
ditaurobilirubin was used to mimic the natural ratio of both forms in human blood.
The recovery for each sample was calculated by comparison to the reference sample.
The sponsor considered significant interference as:
≤ 20 ng/mL 25-hydroxyvitamin D: > 2.0 ng/mL deviation from the unspiked
reference value
> 20 ng/mL 25-hydroxyvitamin D: > 10% deviation from the unspiked reference
value
The highest concentrations at which no significant interference was observed are
shown below:

Biotin 30 ng/mL
Total Protein 9 g/dL
Rheumatoid facror(RF) 1200 IU/mL

The labeling contains the following limitation:
Samples should not be taken from patients receiving therapy with high biotin doses
(i.e. > 5 mg/day) until at least 8 hours following the last biotin administration.
Patients taking > 20 mg biotin per day may need to discontinue biotin intake for
longer than 8 hours prior to testing with this assay.
Human Anti-Mouse Antibodies (HAMA):
The effect of the presence of human anti-mouse antibodies on the Elecsys Vitamin D
total II assay was assessed on the cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzer. Serum
containing 805 ng/mL human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) and control serum
without interferent were measured in duplicate. The sponsor considered recovery of
the HAMA-containing serum compared to the control serum of 100 ± 10% to be
significant interference.
The study results support the sponsor’s claim that HAMA up to 805 ng/mL does not
significantly interfere with the Elecsys Vitamin D total II assay.

Exogenous Interferences – Drugs
The effect on quantitation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D using the Elecsys Vitamin D total
II assay in the presence of drugs was determined by comparing values obtained from
samples spiked with 19 pharmaceutical compounds with the reference sample
(unspiked). Two human serum samples (single donors, native as well as spiked) with
25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of approximately 30 and 70 ng/mL were used in
the study. The two serum samples were divided into aliquots and spiked with the
potential interferents. The reference sample without interferent was spiked with the
respective amount of solvent only. The samples were measured on the cobas e 411
immunoassay analyzer. The sponsor defined significant interference as greater or
equal to ± 10% of the reference value (unspiked sample).

Cross reactivity:
A cross-reactivity study was conducted according to CLSI-EP7-A2 to evaluate the
potential cross-reactivity of the assay with other vitamin D metabolites. The potential
cross-reactants were added at defined concentrations to native human sera with
approximate 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of 25, 40, and 60 ng/mL, and
analyzed with the Elecsys Vitamin D total II assay on the cobas e 411analyzer.
Results from the spiked serum samples were matched against the unspiked references
and the % cross-reactivity was calculated using the equation below.

To reflect the endogenous situation and binding behavior of the metabolite without
spiking effect and to avoid potentially underreporting the cross-reactivity to 25-
hydroxy Vitamin D2, the observed % cross-reactivities shown above were
normalized to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 by dividing the respective observed % cross-
reactivity by the % cross-reactivity of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. The table above shows
the mean % cross-reactivity for both normalized and non-normalized samples.
High Dose Hook Effect:
The high-dose hook effect of the Elecsys Vitamin D total II assay was assessed on the
cobas e 411 analyzer. One human serum sample was spiked with analyte to achieve a
high 25-OH Vitamin D concentration of approximatly10,000 ng/mL. A dilution series
was performed using a low level analyte (Vitamin D depleted) serum. The study
results show that no hook effect was observed up to 10,000 ng/mL for Elecsys
Vitamin D total II.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method Comparison to Reference Method:
A method comparison study against the ID-LC-MS/MS 25(OH)D Reference
Measurement Procedure (RMP) was the basis of the substantial equivalence
determination for this submission. A method comparison study to compare the
candidate device Elcsys Vitamin D total II with Reference method ID-LC-MS/MS
method using a total of 111 native single donor patient serum samples (provided by
the Vitamin D Standardization and Certification Program with assigned values by the
RMP at CDC, independent from the samples used for standardization) were measured
in singleton on the cobas e 411 analyzer. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D values ranged
between 5.64 and 92.8 ng/mL as measured by the Reference Method, LC-MS/MS.
The results are summarized in the table below:

Range(ng/mL) 6.1-56
c. Matrix comparison:
The effect on quantitation of 25-OH Vitamin D with the Elecsys Vitamin D total II
assay in the presence of different anticoagulants was determined by comparing values
obtained from samples (single donors - native, diluted as well as spiked) drawn into
serum, Li-Heparin, K2-EDTA, K3-EDTA plasma primary tubes, and Plasma Gel
Separation Tubes (Li-Heparin). A minimum of 45 serum/plasma pairs per sample
material were tested in singleton with one reagent lot on one cobas e 411
immunoassay analyzer. The linear regression equations from the comparisons are
