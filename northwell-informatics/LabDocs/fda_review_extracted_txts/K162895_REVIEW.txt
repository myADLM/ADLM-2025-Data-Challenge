L. Test Principle:
The test uses both ruthenium-labeled and biotin-labeled antibodies to form a sandwich
complex with cardiac troponin T (cTnT). The formed immune complexes are
immobilized onto the surface of magnetic microparticles via biotin-streptavidin binding.
cobas e 411: The sample is mixed with biotinylated monoclonal cTnT-specific antibody
and a ruthenium labeled-monoclonal cTnT antibody that react with TnT in the sample to
form a sandwich complex. Capture of the sandwich complex occurs during a second
incubation.
cobas e 601: The sample is mixed with biotinylated monoclonal cTnT-specific antibody
and a ruthenium labeled-monoclonal cTnT antibody that react with TnT in the sample to
form a sandwich complex. During this incubation to form the sandwich complex, the
complex is also captured to the solid phase.
All analyzers: Microparticles are magnetically captured onto the measurement electrode.
Current is applied to the electrode to stimulate chemiluminescent emission that is
measured by a photomultiplier. Test results are determined via a calibration curve. The
measured electrochemiluminescence signal is proportional to the amount of troponin T in
the sample. The STAT assay has a turnaround time of 9 minutes.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the Elecsys Troponin T STAT Gen 5 was evaluated in a 21 day precision
study performed in-house according to CLSI EP5-A2. The study used a panel of
pooled lithium heparin plasma samples: 1 low native sample (close to the Limit of
Quantitation), 1 native sample close to the cut-offs, 1 sample at 4000-6000 ng/L
spiked with recombinant TnT, and 1 sample at 8000-9000 ng/L spiked with
recombinant TnT. The Elecsys PreciControl Troponin controls were also included in
this study. Samples were split into aliquots of 4 then 2 aliquots were tested in
singlicate for each of 2 runs per day for a total of 4 runs per day. Samples were tested
using 3 reagent lots on each a cobas e 411 and cobas e 601, each sample tested 4
times per day for 21 days for a total of 84 measurements per lot. The study results
from a representative lot are presented in the following tables for the cobas e 411 and
cobas e 601 analyzers.

Data was also provided using lithium heparin samples to demonstrate that the %CV
of the assay at 11 ng/L is 10%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity of the Troponin T Gen 5 STAT assay for lithium heparin plasma samples
was evaluated in accordance with the CLSI EP-6A guideline using 1 reagent lot for
both the cobas e 411 and the cobas e 601. One lithium heparin plasma sample with a
high concentration of TnT was prepared by spiking a plasma sample with
recombinant TnT. Samples spanning the linear range of the assay were prepared by
intermixing with a native lithium heparin plasma sample with low concentration of
cTnT to generate a total of 21 samples. The samples were measured in triplicate in a
single run using a single lot on each the cobas e 411 and cobas e 601.
The quadratic model was significant for the cobas e 411 and the cubic model was

significant for the cobas e 601 based on unweighted regression models. For cobas e
411, the test results did not deviate from linearity by more than 6.3%. For cobas e
601, the test results did not deviate from linearity by more than 12.4%.
The measuring range of the assay is 6 – 10000 ng/L with the upper end of the
measuring range being defined by the linear range of the assay. (See detection limits
in M. item d. below for more information.)
Hook Effect: A study was performed to support the claim that there was no hook
effect up to 100,000 ng/L cTnT on both the cobas e 411 and cobas e 601.
Dilution: A dilution study was performed to support the statement that the cobas e
411 and cobas e 601 can perform a dilution of 1:10 for samples that are out of range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Elecsys Troponin T STAT Gen 5 Immunoassay is traceable to the Elecsys
Troponin T STAT assay.
The master calibrators (6 master calibrators) are value assigned using multiple
instruments (including multiple instrument platforms) and multiple runs. The results
from the testing are evaluated and specifications must be met. The protocols were
reviewed and found acceptable.
The CalSets are value assigned using multiple instruments (including multiple
instrument platforms) and multiple runs. The results are evaluated and specifications
must be met. The protocols were reviewed and found acceptable.
The PreciControls are value assigned using multiple instruments (including multiple
instrument platforms) and multiple runs. The results are evaluated and specifications
must be met. The protocols for value assignment and stability for troponin T were
reviewed and found acceptable. These controls were cleared in k082699 but troponin
T was not included in the list of assayed analytes. In addition, the target value for the
low troponin I control has changed from 0.4 ng/mL to 0.75 ng/mL. The value
assignment procedure and stability protocols are unchanged since the clearance of
k082699.
The CalCheck 5 are value assigned using multiple instruments (including multiple
instrument platforms) and multiple runs. The results are evaluated and specifications
must be met. The protocols were reviewed and found acceptable.
Calibration stability: The sponsor provided data to support the claim that the
calibration is stable for 7 days when using the same reagent kit onboard the analyzer
or for 12 weeks when using the same reagent lot.
Calset stability: Real time stability studies were performed and support the following
claims:
8

--- Page 9 ---
• The lyophilized calibrators are stable for 18 months when stored at 2-8°C.
• Once reconstituted the calibrators are stable for 3 months when stored at -
20°C but should only be frozen once.
• Once reconstituted the calibrators are stable for 2 weeks when stored at 2-8°C.
• Once reconstituted the calibrators are stable for 5 hours onboard the
instruments at 20-25°C.
PreciControl stability: Real time stability studies were performed and support the
following claims:
• The lyophilized controls are stable for 18 months when stored at 2-8°C.
• Once reconstituted the calibrators are stable for 3 months when stored at -
20°C but should only be frozen once.
• Once reconstituted the controls are stable for 4 days when stored at 2-8°C.
• Once reconstituted the calibrators are stable for 5 hours when stored onboard
the instrument at 20-25°C.
CalCheck 5 stability: Real time stability studies were performed and support the
following claims:
• The lyophilized CalCheck 5 are stable for 18 months when stored at 2-8°C.
• Once reconstituted the CalCheck 5 are stable for 4 hours when stored at 20-
25°C.
Lithium heparin sample stability: Sample stability studies were provided for stability
at 2-8°C, -20°C, and Freeze-Thaw.
2-8°C Stability: Studies were performed and support the following lithium heparin
plasma sample stability claims:
For 24 hours when stored at 2-8°C.
For 12 months when stored at -20°C.
Samples can only be frozen once.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) studies
were performed based on CLSI EP-17A and analyzed as described below.
LoB Test Protocol
To estimate LoB, a blank sample was measured in replicates of 5 for 6 runs over ≥3
days on 2 cobas e 411 and 2 cobas e 601 analyzers for each of 2 lots yielding 60
measurements for each reagent lot on both the cobas e 411 and the cobas e 601.
LoB was defined as the highest observed measured concentration for samples free of
cTnT and was determined as the 95th percentile of test results for the blank samples
for each lot. The claim is based on the lot with the highest determined LoB for each
instrument.
9

--- Page 10 ---
LoD Test Protocol
To estimate LoD, 5 low level lithium heparin plasma samples were measured in
singlicate on 6 runs over multiple days using 2 cobas e 411 and 2 cobas e 601
analyzers for each of 2 lots for a total of 60 measurements per lot.
LoD was established using a parametric analysis for each lot. The claim is based on
the lot with the highest determined LoD for each instrument.
LoQ Test Protocol
To estimate LoQ, 10 pooled lithium heparin plasma samples targeting the low end of
the measuring range were used. The samples were measured 2 times per run for 2
runs per day for 21 days using 2 cobas e 411 and 2 cobas e 601 analyzers for each of
2 lots of reagents for a total of 84 measurements per sample for each lot. The LoQ
was defined as the lowest concentration of cTnt with a %CV of ≤20%. The data were
evaluated using the precision profile approach described in EP17-A2. The claim is
based on the lot with the highest determined LoQ for each instrument.
The above studies support the following detection limits for each instrument:
Instrument LoB LoD LoQ
cobas e 411 3 ng/L 5 ng/L 6.0 ng/L
cobas e 601 2.5 ng/L 3 ng/L 6.0 ng/L
The measuring range of the assay is 6 – 10000 ng/L and is defined by the LoQ at the
low end and the linearity at the high end.
e. Analytical specificity:
To evaluate potential interference due to endogenous substances (listed in the
following table), the interferents were added to pooled lithium heparin plasma
samples targeting cTnT at low, medium and high concentrations of cTnT (13-18
ng/L, 93 - 4500 ng/L, and 1100 - 8500 ng/L). The low samples were native samples,
the medium range and high range samples were either native samples or samples
spiked with recombinant troponin. The samples were tested either in singlicate or in
triplicate on each a cobas e 411 and a cobas e 601. When tested in triplicate, the
means were calculated and evaluated. For each substance tested, interference was
analyzed by comparing the true value sample (no interferent added) to the test sample
(interferent added) and calculated according to the following formula: % recovery =
test sample/true sample X 100. The potentially interfering compounds, at the
following concentrations, did not interfere with the performance of the device (i.e.,
did not result in bias >10%).

depressed results are obtained when using samples with hemoglobin concentrations
> 0.1 g/dL.
Samples should not be taken from patients receiving therapy with high biotin doses
(i.e. > 5 mg/day) until at least 8 hours following the last biotin administration.
For assays using antibodies, the possibility exists for interference by heterophile
antibodies in the patient’s sample. Patients who have been regularly exposed to
animals or have received immunotherapy or diagnostic procedures using
immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin fragments may produce antibodies, e.g. HAMA,
that interfere with immunoassays. Carefully evaluate the results of patients suspected
of having these antibodies.
In rare cases, interference due to extremely high titers of antibodies to
analyte‑specific antibodies, streptavidin or ruthenium can occur. The reagent has
been formulated to minimize these effects.
Cross-reactivity: To evaluate potential interference due to potentially cross reacting
substances (listed in the following table), the interferents were added to pooled
lithium heparin plasma samples targeting cTnT at low, medium and high
concentrations of cTnT (13-22 ng/L, 93 - 4500 ng/L, and 1100 - 8500 ng/L). The low
samples were native samples, the medium range and high range samples were
samples spiked with recombinant troponin. The samples were tested in singlicate on
each a cobas e 411 and a cobas e 601. For each substance tested, interference was
analyzed by comparing the true value sample (no interferent added) to the test sample
(interferent added) and calculated according to the following formula: % recovery =
test sample/true sample X 100. The potentially cross-reacting compounds, at the
following concentrations, did not interfere with the performance of the device (i.e.,
did not result in bias >10%).

Exogenous interference: To evaluate potential interference due to exogenous
substances including common drugs and cardiac-specific drugs (listed in the
following table), the interferents were added to 2 pooled lithium heparin plasma
samples targeting cTnT at concentrations near the cut-off and well above the cut-off.
The low samples were native samples, the high range samples were samples spiked
with recombinant troponin. For common drugs, pooled samples with TnT
concentrations of 15 and 9800 ng/L were used. For cardiac specific drugs, pooled
samples with TnT concentrations of 15 and 1900 ng/L were used. Control and test
samples were tested in triplicate on each a cobas e 411 and a cobas e 601 and the
means were calculated and evaluated. For each substance tested, interference was
analyzed by comparing the true value sample (no interferent added) to the test sample
(interferent added) and calculated according to the following formula: % recovery =
test sample/true sample X 100. The highest concentrations of interferents used in
testing are included below. At the testing concentrations, test results exhibited a bias
of <±10% on each the cobas e 411 and the cobas e 601.

Data from the “The Advantageous Predictors of Acute Coronary Syndromes
Evaluation” (APACE) study, an international, multi-center prospective trial of acute
chest pain patients that is currently continuing enrollment, was provided in support of
this device. In this study, the sites enrolled all patients who presented to the
emergency department with symptoms of chest pain and angina pectoris. Peak
symptoms had to have occurred within the last 12 hours (onset of symptoms reported
ranged from 0 to 72 hours). The only exclusion criterion was kidney failure that
required dialysis. Diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) was done through an
independent adjudication committee which included cardiologists. This included 60
day follow-up information on each subject. The subjects were diagnosed with acute
MI by using the diagnostic criteria described in the ACC/ESC/AHA guidelines1

In addition, clinical performance estimates were provided from a second multicenter
study performed in the United States were a total of 1679 subjects presenting emergently
with chest pain were enrolled. The trial excluded chest pain subjects with an MI within
the last 3 months, subjects with surgery or hospitalization within the last 3 months,
subjects with revascularization or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within the
last 3 months, subjects with an established acute non-cardiac primary illness and subjects
transferred from another hospital or facility. These excluded subjects could be expected
to have elevated troponin concentrations that would likely reflect cardiac comorbidities
besides MI, and yield positive results; therefore, the estimate of specificity and the
positive predictive values of this trial may be overestimated.
Within this population, there were 173 adjudicated MIs. 1679 of these subjects were
evaluated on the cobas e 411 analyzer and 1675 subjects were evaluated on the cobas e
601 analyzer. Final diagnoses were determined by an independent adjudication
committee which included cardiologists and emergency medicine physicians using the
universal guidelines.

Troponins are released during the process of myocyte necrosis. While they are cardiac
specific, they are not specific for MI and detectable levels may be seen in other disease
states that involve the heart muscle (e.g. arrhythmia, acute aortic syndrome, acute heart
failure, hypertensive crisis, myocarditis, pericarditis, pulmonary embolism and
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy), so that ACC/ESC/AHA guidelines and the Universal
Definition of MI recommend serial sampling with a rise or fall in troponin to distinguish
between acute and chronic cTn elevations. Results should be interpreted in conjunction
with clinical presentation including medical history, signs and symptoms, ECG data and
biomarker concentrations.
b. Clinical specificity:
See section M.3.a. Clinical sensitivity above.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
This assay has 3 claimed cut-offs. These are overall (19 ng/L), a cut-off for females
(14 ng/L), and a cut-off for males (22 ng/L) all of which were determined using the 99th
percentile upper reference limit.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
To establish the 99th percentile upper reference limit in lithium heparin plasma samples, a
reference range study was conducted at 4 external collection sites in a population of
apparently healthy adults. In order to capture an apparently healthy population, subjects
were excluded if they had a diagnosis of cancer, or any chronic disease, were taking
prescriptions for a chronic diseases, had high blood pressure, had a history of acute
coronary syndrome, had been hospitalized within the last 3 months, and was pregnant or
had delivered a baby within the last 6 weeks. The study population of 1301 included 645
males and 656 females.
The 99th percentile upper reference limit was demonstrated to be 19 ng/L overall, 14 ng/L
for females, and 22 ng/L for males.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
