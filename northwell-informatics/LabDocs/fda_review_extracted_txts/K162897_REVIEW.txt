1. Device Description:
The Navios EX uses flow cytometric principles to determine qualitative and quantitative
measurements of biological and physical properties of cells and other particles when the cells
pass through the laser beam(s) in single file.
The Navios EX Flow Cytometer includes the 488nm laser as part of three available
manufactured instrument configurations (same as the predicate, K130373).
Navios EX Flow Cytometer, 6 Color/2 Laser
Navios EX Flow Cytometer, 8 Color/2 Laser
Navios EX Flow Cytometer, 10 Color/3 Laser
The lower level configurations are upgradeable to higher level configurations by adding
filters, photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and activating a laser, if required. Only the 488nm laser
is utilized for cleared IVD applications (tetraCHROME cleared in K130373) and for the
488nm laser, only fluorescence channel 1 (FL1) through FL4 are the subject of this 510(k)
submission.

An update to the cytometer’s indications for use, providing additional detail on the
configuration of the device
Navios EX System Software (on‐board): The Navios EX Flow Cytometer contains on‐board
software which enables the user to acquire data from the Navios EX Flow Cytometer and to
analyze, display, print and export acquired listmode data. The software has the following
functions:
· Daily Routine (Startup/Shutdown)
· Setup Mode & AutoSetup
· Quality Assurance (Controls/Calibration)
· Sample Analysis
· Data Review
· Listmode Replay
· Report Generation
Navios EX Software is also offered as an optional software package for use on an
independent computer workstation for off‐line analysis of listmode files generated by the
Navios EX Flow Cytometer with the monoclonal antibody reagents. The off‐line version
utilizes the same executable software as the on-board software with the instrument control
portion/features disabled. Analysis must be performed in accordance with the product
labeling.
The Navios EX tetra Software is an optional software package that is separate from the
2

--- Page 3 ---
Navios EX System software. It is used for immunophenotyping with CYTO‐STAT
tetraCHROME CD45‐FITC/CD4‐RD1/ CD8‐ECD/CD3‐PC5 and CYTO‐STAT
tetraCHROME CD45‐FITC/CD56‐RD1/CD19‐ECD/CD3‐PC5 monoclonal antibody
reagents on the Navios EX Flow Cytometer. It provides automated analysis and results for
the identification and enumeration of CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, CD3+, CD19+ and
CD3‐CD56+ lymphocyte percentages and absolute counts in peripheral whole blood.
Absolute counts may be determined by the Navios EX Flow Cytometers using Flow‐Count
Fluorospheres (Single Platform Technology (SPT) Method) or separate hematology results
(Dual Platform Method).
2. Principles of Operation:
The Navios EX flow cytometer aligns cells in suspension by hydrodynamic focusing and
passes them through a laser beam one cell at a time. The scattered and fluoresced light
that emanates from these cells as they intersect the laser beam is collected by
photomultipler tubes and transduced to an electronic pulse and counted by the
instrument’s computer. The utility of this device depends on the ability of a monoclonal
antibody to bind to the surface of cells expressing discrete antigenic determinants.
Specific cell staining is accomplished by incubating whole blood with the monoclonal
antibody reagent, the CYTO-STAT tetraCHROME CD45-FITC/CD4-RD1/CD8-
ECD/CD3-PC5 and CYTO-STAT tetraCHROME CD45-FITC/CD56-RD1/CD19-
ECD/CD3-PC5. Monoclonal antibody reagents are each a combination of four murine
monoclonal antibodies, each conjugated to a specific fluorochrome and specific for a
different cell surface antigen.
Red blood cells are lysed with the COULTER ImmunoPrep Reagent System. The
remaining white blood cells are analyzed on a Navios EX flow cytometer with the
CYTO-STAT tetraCHROME reagents and the Navios EX tetra Software package.
Navios EX System Software and Navios EX tetra Software, in conjunction with quality
control reagents, provide automated standardization of light scatter and fluorescence
intensities and automated adjustment of color compensation settings. The Navios EX
tetra Software, in conjunction with the Navios EX Software, and CYTO-STAT
tetraCHROME CD45-FITC/CD4-RD1/CD8-ECD/CD3-PC5 and CYTO-STAT
tetraCHROME CD45-FITC/CD56-RD1/CD19-ECD/CD3-PC5 reagents, provides
automated analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations.
3. Modes of Operation:
Batch or single tube
4. Specimen Identification:
Barcode reader or manual entry
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The automated sample loader for the instrument uses a carousel that holds thirty-two 12 x
3

--- Page 4 ---
75-mm test tubes and includes a barcode reader.
6. Calibration:
Fluorescence intensity is calibrated by adjusting photomultiplier voltage using Flow-Set
Pro Fluorospheres (K130373). The absolute count of a population is based on the
calibration factor (CAL Factor) and the number of Flow-Count fluorospheres particles
within a user defined CAL region.
7. Quality Control:
IMMUNO-TROL Cells and IMMUNO-TROL Low Cells (K030828) are assayed,
lysable, whole-blood quality control products used to verify the activity of the CYTO-
STAT tetraCHROME reagents and to verify the methods used for staining targeted cells,
lysing erythrocytes, and analyzing samples with flow cytometry.

1. Method Comparisons:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was conducted in accordance with CLSI EP09‐A3,
Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples;
Approved Guideline – Third Edition. This prospective study was conducted with
specimens collected and tested at four sites. Subjects included the population of
patients presenting for diagnosis and/or prognosis of HIV or being evaluated for
immune competency, patients monitored following transplantation and
immunosuppression, and apparently healthy, hematologically normal individuals
between 18–85 years old. A total of 424 whole blood specimens combined from all
clinical sites with emphasis on the medical decision ranges for CD3+CD4+ (50, 100,
200, 350 and 500 cells/μL) were tested on the instrument (Navios EX) and the
predicate (Navios).
The test system consisted of the Navios EX Flow Cytometer with Navios EX tetra
Software and tetraCHROME reagents for CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+,
CD3‐CD56+, CD19+ percent and absolute count with a single platform approach for
absolute count using Flow‐Count Fluorospheres. The Predicate system consisted of
the Navios Flow Cytometer with Navios tetra software and tetraCHROME reagents
for CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, CD3‐CD56+, CD19+ percent and absolute
count with a single platform approach for absolute count using Flow‐Count
Fluorospheres.
Whole blood specimens were held at room temperature and tested at one site within
24 hours from venipuncture. Specimens were prepared in duplicate with
tetraCHROME reagents (CD45‐FITC/CD4‐RD1/CD8‐ECD/CD3‐PC5 [Tetra 1] and
CD45‐FTC/CD56‐RD1/CD19‐ECD/CD3‐PC5 [Tetra 2]) using the TQPrep
Workstation and PrepPlus 2 Workstation analyzed once on both the Navios
(predicate) and Navios EX (test) flow cytometers. The same preparation was analyzed
11

--- Page 12 ---
on each cytometer. Testing between test and predicate systems was randomized daily
to minimize system bias and was within 2.5 hours of each other. Three lots of reagent
were used across the sites.
The data met the acceptance criteria for all parameters including CD3+CD4+ at
medical decision levels when analyzed for each site individually as well as when all
sites were combined (shown in table below).

Bias between methods was calculated from the regression line at the 25‐th, 50‐th and
75‐th percentile of the range of the comparator for all analytes and for different
medical decision points of CD3+CD4+ counts. Confidence limits of bias estimates
were calculated based of standard errors of bias and 95% confidence. The
upper/lower confidence limits were compared to the acceptance criteria.

Navios EX flow cytometry system demonstrated acceptable accuracy compared to the
predicate, Navios flow cytometer and demonstrated performance across the analytical
measuring interval (AMI).
b. Instrument Configuration Comparisons
Comparability of the performance of the Navios EX flow cytometer with Navios EX
tetra Software was verified for all three configurations (6 color/2 laser, 8 color/2
laser, and 10 color/3 laser) and relative to the predicate Navios flow cytometer with
Navios tetra Software for absolute counts and percent positive recovery of
tetraCHROME target populations. Forty-one specimens (targeting approximately
15% normal and 85% clinical) targeting medical decision points for CD3+CD4+ at

2. Precision and Reproducibilty
a. Precision–Long Term Imprecision
Precision Study 1: Precision study with control material using Navios EX tetra
software.
Precision studies with control materials were conducted in accordance with CLSI
EP05-A3, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement
Methods; Approved Guideline. Two levels of control material (IMMUNO-TROL
Cells and IMMUNO-TROL Low Cells) were evaluated in the study. The controls
were prepared with tetraCHROME reagents (CD45-FITC/CD4-RD1/CD8-ECD/CD3-
PC5 and CD45-FITC/CD56-RD1/CD19-ECD/CD3-PC5) and Flow-Count
Fluorospheres. At one external site, controls were run in duplicate twice each day
(morning and afternoon) for 20 days. At two additional external sites, controls were
run in triplicate twice each day (morning and afternoon) for five days. Percent
positive and absolute counts were measured for CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+,
CD3‐ CD56+, and CD19+ populations for each level of control product. Absolute
counts were determined using Flow‐Count Fluorospheres. A new vial of control
material was opened each day of testing. The lot of control material for this testing
was the same at each site so that data could be pooled during analysis. Three lots of
tetraCHROME reagents, Flow‐Count Fluorospheres, and ImmunoPrep reagents were
tested across the external sites. All parameters met the precision and reproducibility
criteria for each site when analyzed separately and with all sites combined.

b. Precision – Whole Blood Repeatability
The precision study was conducted with whole blood samples in accordance with
CLSI guideline H26‐A2, Validation, Verification, and Quality Assurance of
Automated Hematology Analyzers; Approved Standard ‐ Second Edition guideline,
and CLSI guideline EP05‐A3, Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative Measurement
Procedures; Approved Guideline – Third Edition guideline. Whole blood specimens
(n=141) were selected to cover the CD3+CD4+ analytical measuring interval with
emphasis on the medical decision levels (50, 100, 200, 350, and 500 cells/ μL). Four
CD3+CD4+ ranges were targeted: 20–100, 101–350, 351–500, and >500. A
minimum of ten clinical or hematologically normal specimens range were collected
for each range across all sites. All other markers were assessed at the levels found in
the clinical conditions representing the CD3+CD4+ levels. Two preparations were
made for each tetraCHROME reagent and then each preparation was analyzed three
times on the Navios EX flow cytometer using Navios EX tetra Software and
Flow‐Count Fluorospheres. The study was conducted at four sites. A minimum of
three lots of tetraCHROME reagents, Flow Count Fluorospheres, and ImmunoPrep
reagents were tested across the clinical sites.

For all CD markers at all percentiles as well as for the CD4 marker at the medical
decision points, the %CV estimated from the precision profile model met the
acceptance criteria.
c. Precision – Whole Blood Site-to-Site Variability
The site‐to‐site variability study was conducted using the CD3+CD4+ absolute count
and percentage from a subset of the specimens collected for the whole blood
repeatability study. Four different levels within the four CD3+CD4+ ranges were
targeted across three sites. Forty-three specimens were selected based on the recovery
of the predicate Navios system. Specimens at each level were chosen so that similar
measurand recoveries were achieved across the sites to ensure poolability of the data
and to minimize the effect of biological variability on the variability measurement. A
minimum of three specimens per CD3+CD4+ level per site were targeted for a
minimum of twelve specimens per site. Different specimens were used in the
CD3+CD4+ percentage and CD3+CD4+ absolute count analyses. The study was
conducted at three sites. Three lots of tetraCHROME reagents (Tetra 1), Flow Count
Fluorospheres, and ImmunoPrep reagents were tested across the clinical sites.

Instrument linearity was assessed with two beads of different fluorescent intensities
(SpheroTechTM Rainbow particles level 4 and 5) analyzed at five different voltages
covering the dynamic range of each PMT from the first decade (values of 0.1 to 1) to
the fourth decade (values of 100 to 1000). The study was conducted on four Navios
EX flow cytometers. The beads were run and the voltage of each PMT was adjusted
so that the lower of the two peaks falls in the first decade (mean channel < 1.0) of the
histogram. The beads were then “marched” across the dynamic range of the
instrument by increasing the voltage until the brightest bead was positioned in the
upper half of the top decade. The mean channel fluorescent intensity ratios of pairs
were calculated for each PMT and these met the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria
demonstrating that the intensity differences between the beads were constant across
the range of voltages assessed. Linearity of the Navios flow cytometer, from the
photomultiplier tubes (PMT) to the electronics, independent of the application and
gating methodology was demonstrated.
2. Assay Linearity
Linearity of the tetraCHROME reagents on the Navios EX Flow Cytometer with
Navios EX tetra software and the manual gating method was established in
accordance with CLSI EP06-A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative
Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach. Linearity samples were prepared
using White Cell Pool (WCP) that is used to manufacture IMMUNOTROL and
mixed with a diluent prepared using Red Blood Cell pool (RBC pool). This study
established that the Navios EX instrument was linear for the tested phenotypes over
the following ranges:
tetraCHROME Reagent Marker Linear Range Cells/μL
tetraCHROME Total CD3+ 61–5050
CD45‐FITC/CD4‐RD1/ CD3+CD4+ 32–3012
CD8‐ECD/CD3‐PC5 CD3+CD8+ 8–2040

CD45‐FITC/CD56‐RD1/ CD19+ 23–1082
CD19‐ECD/CD3‐PC5 CD3‐CD56+ 23–949
3. Analytical Measuring Interval
The AMI of the Navios EX flow cytometer was established and verified to meet
all criteria including values within the established Linearity range; AMI lower
limits above the LOQ values; AMI lower limits no less than the Navios
(predicate) lower limit for each interval; AMI representative of the intended use
population. Based on these criteria, the following are reported as the analytical
measuring range for this device.

4. Carryover:
a. Carryover Using Beads
A carryover study was performed using Flow Check Pro fluorospheres on each of
four Navios EX flow cytometers according to the methodology presented in CLSI
Document: H26-A2, Validation, Verification, and Quality Assurance of Automated
Hematology Analyzers; Approved Standard – Second Edition, Section 5.7. Testing
consisted of a high concentration sample (Flow‐ Check Pro Fluorospheres) analyzed
consecutively three times (HTV1, HTV2, HTV3) followed immediately by testing a
low concentration sample (IsoFlow Sheath Fluid) three times (LTV1, LTV2, LTV3).
Acceptable carryover was demonstrated.
b. Carryover Using Reagent
Carryover studies were conducted on three Navios EX instruments according to the
methodology presented in CLSI H26‐A2: Validation, Verification, and Quality
Assurance of Automated Hematology analyzers; Approved Standard‐Second Edition,
Section 5.7 with regard to high or low value sample order. Two studies were
conducted to evaluate specimen and reagent carryover. Scatter and fluorescence
carryover was demonstrated to be less than 1% from one specimen to another when
the numbers of gated events was 10,000 or greater. Acceptable carryoverwas
demonstrated.

a. Detection limit:
The LOB, LOD, and LOQ studies were conducted in accordance with CLSI
EP17‐A2: Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement
Procedures; Approved Guideline‐2nd Edition.
i. Limit of Blank (LoB): The study design incorporated five repetitions of each of
the three prepared blank samples which were collected each day over four days,
yielding a total of 60 data collection points per measuring system for each
tetraCHROME reagent. Samples were prepared using the PrepPlus 2 sample

preparation method (PrepPlus 2 with TQ‐Prep). A total of 360 data points were
collected for the study using three blank sample preparations, one lot of each
reagent and three Navios EX flow cytometers. LOB was calculated for each
marker as the upper 95% confidence level of the data as recommended in the
CLSI EP17‐A2 Guideline. LoB was calculated separately for each of the three
instruments. A nonparametric approach based on the ranks of observations was
used in the study to calculate LoB for each tetraCHROME marker.
ii. Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ): LoD and LoQ
experiments were designed and analyzed according to the variant (precision
profile) approach of CLSI EP17‐A2. Eight dilutions of ImmunoTrol cells were
prepared in ImmunoTrol erythrocytes and were treated with each of the two
tetraCHROME reagents, Immunoprep reagents and Flow-Count to measure the
LoD and LoQ. Testing was conducted over five days on three Navios EX Flow
Cytometers. Each day, one lot of cells was prepared for each cytometer and five
replicates of each dilution were tested on each flow cytometer. This resulted in a
total of 1200 data points. The results from these studies are presented in the table
below:
Navios EX tetra CD3+ CD3+/CD4+ CD3+/CD8+ CD3/CD56+ CD19+ CD3+

LoD (cells/uL) 8 6 4 1 1 8
LoQ (cells/uL) 8 6 4 4 4 8
c. Specimen and Prepared Sample Stability
Forty specimens having CD4 counts across the AMI were prepared using
CYTO‐STAT tetraCHROME reagents in duplicate within eight hours and held at
room temperature for 24 and 48 hours and prepared again in order to verify the
expected stability as reported in the literature. Specimens held 24 and 48 hours were
refrigerated and tested again after an additional 24 and 48 hours. Samples were
prepared by a TQ‐Prep and PrepPlus 2 in duplicate for each specimen for each time
point tested and analyzed singly. Flow‐Count Fluorospheres were used to determine
absolute counts for all samples analyzed. Analysis was performed using two Navios
EX flow cytometers running Navios EX tetra Software. All parameters were verified
to demonstrate the claimed stability of 24 hours for whole blood stored at room
temperature and 24 hours for prepared specimens stored at refrigerated temperature.
d. Laser Performance:
Laser performance was assessed on two Navios EX Flow Cytometers using Flow-
Check Pro Fluorospheres at one site and it was demonstrated that neither integral
signal intensity nor half peak coefficient of variation (HPCV) for forward light scatter
(FS) and each of the linear fluorescence parameters vary more than acceptable levels
over a period of 24 hours for Short-term Laser Performance and 8 days for Long-term
Laser Performance. Stability of the laser performance of the Navios EX flow
cytometer over time was demonstrated.
