I. Device Description:
1. Overview
The Sofia RSV FIA is a rapid lateral flow immunoassay for the qualitative detection of
RSV A and RSV B nucleoprotein from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and nasopharyngeal
aspirate/wash (NA/W) specimens collected from pediatric patients with signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection. The Sofia RSV FIA has four main components: (1) a
sample pad for receiving the specimen; (2) a label pad containing dried, fluorescently
dyed microparticles coated with RSV-specific monoclonal antibodies; (3) a nitrocellulose
test strip for the capture of RSV analyte; and (4) an absorbent pad to drive capillary flow.
A more detailed description of the lateral flow device is available in submission
K130398, under which the Sofia RSV FIA was cleared for use with the original Sofia
analyzer.
The purpose of this submission is to obtain 510(k) clearance for the Sofia RSV FIA for
use with the newly developed Sofia 2 analyzer. The Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzer are similar
in function and design. Both systems utilize the same fail-safes and failure alert
mechanisms, the same calibration and assay-specific cartridges, and the same ultraviolet
2

--- Page 3 ---
light-emitting diodes (UV LEDs) to excite the fluorophore. The primary difference
between the original Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzer is the design of the optical detection
system. Sofia uses a motorized optics unit to collect fluorescent signal data as it performs
a series of scans across the longitudinal axis of the Sofia RSV FIA test strip, whereas
Sofia 2 captures a still image of the entire test strip window using a complimentary color-
oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera. To emulate Sofia, the Sofia 2 analyzer converts
pixels captured by the CMOS camera to fluorescent signal data, after which the resulting
data is analyzed in an equivalent manner to Sofia to yield qualitative test results. Other
minor adjustments to the Sofia 2 analyzer affect mainly the user interface and include the
addition of a touchscreen display and an integrated barcode scanner for sample
identification.

4. Quality Control
The Sofia RSV FIA test strip has several chemically built-in controls to ensure that each
test is performed properly. These include the negative control line, reference line, and the
procedural control zone.
Negative Control Line
The negative control line is the first line that the extracted specimen encounters as it
migrates across the length of the nitrocellulose test strip. The purpose of the negative
control line is to enable the measurement of non-specific binding of the microparticle
conjugates to the patient specimen. The fluorescent signal generated at this line is used to
calculate background signal and to help ensure that high non-specific binding at the
analyte-specific test line does not lead to false positive results. If the reference fluorescent
3

--- Page 4 ---
units (RFUs) for the negative control line exceed the maximum specifications, the
analyzer will report that the result is “invalid.”
Reference Line
The reference line is the last line on the test strip that the extracted specimen encounters
before it enters the absorbent pad. The reference line is used to verify adequate sample
flow through the nitrocellulose test strip and also serves as a marker to direct the Sofia
analyzer to the location of each of the other test lines. If the RFUs for the reference line
fall below the minimum specifications, the analyzer will report that the result is “invalid.”
Procedural Control Zone
The procedural control zone is the area of the nitrocellulose test strip that is located
between the negative control line and the analyte-specific test line. The RFU signal that is
emitted from the procedural control zone provides additional confirmation that adequate
flow of the sample has occurred. If the RFU signal falls outside of the minimum and
maximum specifications allotted for this zone, the analyzer will report the result as
“invalid.”
5. Results Interpretation
Upon completion of the test, the results are reported as text on the display screen of the
Sofia or Sofia 2 analyzer. There are three possible test results for the Sofia RSV FIA:
RSV positive, RSV negative, or invalid. If an invalid test result is reported, the Sofia
RSV FIA should be repeated with a new patient sample and a new test cassette.
Note: The Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers may be set to one of two operating modes: Walk
Away or Read Now. Time to results for the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzer are described
below.
· In Walk Away Mode, the user inserts the test cassette into the analyzer
immediately following addition of the specimen to the Sofia RSV FIA sample
port. The Sofia analyzer automatically times the test development and provides
positive or negative test results after 15 minutes. The Sofia 2 analyzer images the
test cassette at 3, 5, 8, 10, and 15 minutes and reports a positive test result at the
time RSV is detected. If the test is negative, the result will be displayed after 15
minutes.
· In the Read Now Mode, the user incubates the test cassette on the benchtop for 15
minutes before inserting the cassette into the Sofia or Sofia 2 analyzer. Positive
and negative test results are displayed within 1 minute.

L. Test Principle:
The Sofia RSV FIA is an immunofluorescence-based lateral flow assay that uses a sandwich
design for the detection of RSV A and B nucleoprotein antigen. The FDA-cleared Sofia RSV
FIA (K130398) has not been modified; it is compatible with the newly developed Sofia 2
analyzer. The Sofia 2 analyzer is a microprocessor-controlled device equipped with UV
LEDs for excitation of the fluorophore, a complimentary color-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)
camera for image capture, and a multicolor display screen for reporting results. Following
illumination of the Sofia RSV FIA cassette by the UV LEDs, the CMOS camera images the
entire length of the nitrocellulose test strip window, which includes a negative control line,
RSV test line, procedural control zone and reference line. To process the data, Sofia 2 utilizes
an analog-to-digital converter to convert the pixels at the test line, negative control line and
reference line into a digital value which is in turn converted to an RFU value. The resulting
data is analyzed in a similar manner as Sofia to yield a qualitative result.
M. Performance Characteristics
Limited studies were conducted to demonstrate equivalent performance of the Sofia RSV
FIA on the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzer. These studies included limit of detection,
reproducibility, assay precision, and method comparison. Results from each of these studies
are described below. Additional analytical and clinical performance data for the Sofia RSV
FIA is available under K130398.
1. Analytical Performance
a. Limit of Detection
The limit of detection (LoD) of the Sofia RSV FIA was established on both the Sofia and
Sofia 2 analyzers. The study included two RSV A and two RSV B strains spiked into
negative clinical nasal swab matrix, and was designed to follow the classical approach
outlined in CLSI document EP17-A, entitled “Evaluation of Detection Capability for
Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures.”
Briefly, an initial range finding study was conducted in which each of the four RSV
strains were prepared at three different concentrations and tested in replicates of five with
two reagent lots on both the Sofia and Sofia 2 instrument platforms. For each strain, the
lowest dilution yielding all five positive results was then used to prepare 10 replicates of
7

--- Page 8 ---
four additional two-fold virus dilutions that were similarly tested with both of the reagent
lots and instrument platforms. From this study, the lowest dilution yielding all 10 positive
results was defined as the preliminary LoD.
Additional low level testing was performed with a minimum of 60 replicates of each
virus strain at the preliminary LoD using a single Sofia RSV FIA reagent lot. Testing
spanned three days with at least 20 replicates run per day for each strain, lot and
instrument combination. Using these data, the mean signal-to-cutoff ratios (S/CO) and
standard deviations were calculated, and the LoD was determined using the parametric
analysis equation, with the limit of blank set to n = 1.
The results of the LoD study are shown in the Table 1 below. The LoD values that were
initially established for the Sofia RSV FIA on the Sofia analyzer (Sofia*) at the time of
product release (K130398) are included in Table 1. The slight variation in LoD values for
the Sofia analyzer between studies suggests minimal drift has occurred.

Sofia* 1.19 32.3
RSV B Washington/18537/62 Sofia 1.45 78.6
Sofia 2 1.47 91.1
The newly established LoDs for the Sofia RSV FIA on the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzer
differ by less than two-fold, indicating that the instrument platforms are performing
equivalently.
b. Reproducibility
A blinded, multi-center study was conducted to demonstrate that the performance of the
Sofia RSV FIA is highly reproducible when tested on the Sofia 2 analyzer. For
comparison, testing was also performed on the original Sofia analyzer.
Two operators at three study sites tested a nine-member reproducibility panel on both the
Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers once per day on five different days (2 operators x 3 sites x 9
panel members x 1 run x 5 days) for a total of 270 runs per instrument platform. The
study was conducted in the Read Now mode with a single Sofia RSV FIA reagent lot.

The reproducibility specimen panel consisted of one RSV A (Long) strain prepared in
triplicate at two concentration levels: a “low positive” sample with an analyte
concentration approximately 1X the LoD and a “moderate positive” sample with an
analyte concentration 2- 3X the LoD. The reproducibility panel was prepared in pooled
negative clinical nasal swab matrix and included three additional samples consisting of
clinical nasal swab matrix only.
The percent agreement between the expected results and the reproducibility study results
for the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzer for each analyte concentration tested is shown in
Tables 2 and 3, respectively.

Based on this analysis, the numerical output (RFU) and the level of variance that is
observed for the Sofia 2 analyzer are comparable to the original Sofia analyzer for each
of the RSV analyte concentrations tested.
c. Assay Precision
To supplement the reproducibility study, within-laboratory precision of the Sofia and
Sofia 2 analyzers was evaluated. One strain of RSV A (Long) spiked into negative
clinical nasal swab matrix was tested at two different analyte concentrations: a “low
positive” sample with an analyte concentration approximately 1X the LoD and a
“moderate positive” sample with an analyte concentration 2- 3X the LoD. Negative
samples consisting of clinical nasal swab matrix only were also included in the testing.
One aliquot of each sample type (negative, low positive and moderate positive) was
tested on three Sofia RSV FIA reagent lots, by two operators on 12 different days (1
aliquots x 3 reagent lots x 2 operators x 12 days) totaling 72 replicates per sample per
instrument. One Sofia analyzer and one Sofia 2 analyzer were used in this study, both of
which were calibrated prior to use on the first day of testing and again after
approximately 30 days to ensure that testing was performed over multiple calibration
cycles.
Overall percent agreement between the expected results and the precision study results
for the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzer is shown in Table 7 below.

2. Comparison Studies
a. Method Comparison
Performance of the Sofia RSV FIA on the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers was evaluated for
equivalency in a method comparison study using clinical sample panels. The study was
conducted at three study sites using identical specimen panels that consisted of 100 RSV
positive and 100 RSV negative clinical samples. The RSV positive panel members were
prepared by diluting RSV positive clinical samples into negative clinical matrix. Each
preparation was subsequently assigned to one of four analyte concentration levels (Table
10) based on the signal-to-cutoff ratio (S/CO) that was obtained from a single replicate on
the Sofia analyzer. For the RSV negative panel members, clinical samples were
designated as either negative or high negative if the S/CO values during the initial
screening process were <0.5 or 0.5-0.9, respectively.

Panel Member Target S/CO Quantity per panel
Negative <0.5 67
High Negative 0.5-0.9 33
Low Positive (1X LoD) 1.2-2.0 30
Moderate Positive(2-3X LoD) 2.1-4.8 30
High Positive (4-5X LoD) 5.6-7.5 20
Very High Positive (>5X LoD) 7.5+ 20
A total of 200 tests were performed at each of the three study sites by two operators on
four different Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers. To assess the potential for early read with
Sofia 2, data was collected in Walk Away Mode. In this mode, Sofia 2 captures images of

*Specimens were clearly positive on both the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers, and were likely contaminated,
misclassified or mixed at the site.
The positive and negative percent agreement between the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers was
97.2% (314/323; 95% CI: 94.7-98.6) and 96.4% (267/277; 95% CI: 93.4-98.1),
respectively. These study results demonstrate that the performance of the Sofia RSV FIA
on the Sofia 2 is similar to the predicate device. Furthermore, the number of discordant
samples that tested positive on Sofia and negative on Sofia 2 (n =9) was approximately
equivalent to the number of discordant samples that tested positive on Sofia 2 and
negative on Sofia (n = 10). Thus, no evidence of significant instrument bias was
observed.
A summary of the results that were obtained at the earlier read times on the Sofia 2
analyzers is shown in Table 14 below. For RSV specimens at ≥4X LoD, at least 70% of
the specimens yielded positive results by 8 minutes, and at least 25% by 5 minutes. For
levels of RSV that were not highly positive, early read times generally did not give
positive results.

Moderate
5. Software Description
The Sofia 2 Analyzer images the test strip and utilizes an embedded software algorithm
to process the resulting data set into a qualitative test result. A positive test result for the
analyte is determined by detection and analysis of the fluorescent signal at the test and
reference lines, which are processed by the assay-specific algorithm. The algorithm
employs a smoothing filter to the data and, identifies a peak maxima, minima and width,
then calculates the RFU value based on peak height for the RSV test line. Results are
presented on a screen and can be printed on an integrated printer.
6. Specimen Identification
Specimens are manually loaded onto the Sofia RSV FIA test cassette by the user. Each
cassette is labeled with a barcode that is detected by the Sofia 2 internal barcode reader.
The 2-dimensinal barcode contains lot, expiration, and test method information. If the
cassette is not in the correct orientation, the barcode cannot be read and the analyzer will
display an error.
7. Calibration
To ensure that signal drift is controlled, the Sofia 2 analyzer has a calibration algorithm
that enables the operator to insert a calibration cassette specifically prepared and labeled
as a Calibration Cassette at least once every 30 days. The Calibration Cassette contains a
barcode with specific test information and four fluorescent simulated test lines at
predefined locations on the test strip.
