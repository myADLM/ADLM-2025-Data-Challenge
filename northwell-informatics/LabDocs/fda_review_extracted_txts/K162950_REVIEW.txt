Reagent Description:
· VITEK MS-CHCA (Alpha-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid) is the solution that serves as
a matrix which will crystalize with the microbial sample on the target slide spot. 1.0 μl of
the matrix is added to the spot with the sample and allowed to dry forming crystals.
· The VITEK MS-FA (Formic acid) reagent is used to pre-treat yeast in order to extract
protein before the VITEK MS-CHCA matrix is added to the spot containing the sample.
· VITEK MS-DS target slides are single-use disposables which contain 3 acquisition
groups of 16 sample spots. Each group includes 1 calibration spot. Target slides are for
single use only.
· VITEK MS MYCOBACTERIUM/NOCARDIA KIT includes ethanol and vials with
glass beads to inactivate mycobacteria and nocardia by disrupting the cells. The kit also
includes formic acid and acetonitrile to complete the extraction of proteins.
· VITEK MS LIQUID MYCO SUPPLEMENTAL KIT includes the additional
consumables (i.e., 5 mL conical bottom tubes and safety backed absorbent pads) needed

Knowledge Base:
The reference database for the VITEK MS system includes data representing 1046 taxa,
including 882 bacteria and 164 fungi. Each species or species group is represented by an
average of 17 isolates (range 2* - 712). In order to capture the degree of acceptable variation
within spectra from the same species, each reference isolate was grown on multiple media
types under several growth conditions. The raw spectra were then acquired by more than one
technician using multiple instruments. This process resulted in an average of 36 reference
spectra per species (or 53 spectra by species or group of species).
* NOTE: For two very rare species (Prevotella baroniae and Prevotella ruminicola), it was
only possible to test a single strain for these organisms in the reference database build.
Additional laboratory tests as determined by Microbiology laboratory protocols for low
discrimination results or non-clinically validated organisms are necessary for the completion
of the organism identification. Non-clinically validated organisms are displayed as in
the report.
Testing of non-clinically validated species or species not found in the database may result in
an unidentified result or a misidentification.
Note: Interpretation of results and use of the VITEK MS system require a competent
laboratorian who should judiciously make use of experience, specimen information, and
other pertinent procedures before reporting the identification of test organisms. Additional
information known to the user, such as Gram stain reaction, colonial and cellular
morphology, and growth aerobically or in CO2 should be considered when accepting VITEK
MS results.
NOTE: Candida auris is not currently in the knowledge base; testing of this species
will usually give no identification but may also result in a misidentification as either
Candida haemulonii or Candida lusitaniae.
Software:
The VITEK MS system consists of a suite of applications that perform the overall system
function. The system functions as a kiosk, not allowing the end-user to access any operating
system functions. The end-user cannot access the native operating system or any system
configuration panels. The software application contains several processes that include
handling all user interactions, all network activity, communication, and synchronization with
the all the components. The VITEK MS system software is comprised of four software
components and MYLA middleware.
1. VITEK MS Sample Prep Station software: The VITEK MS Prep Station is used to
prepare VITEK MS-DS target slides. It consists of a computer workstation equipped with
a barcode reader, Touch Screen and Virtual Keyboard.
8

--- Page 9 ---
2. VITEK MS acquisition station: The Acquisition Station Software controls the VITEK
MS to acquire spectral data from each sample in turn and displays the spectra for the
operator to review. The Acquisition Station displays the spectra and peak lists and
transfers the peak lists to the VITEK MS Analysis Server.
3. VITEK MS Analysis Server / Software: The VITEK MS Analysis Server is the software
that manages the VITEK MS workflow and computes VITEK MS identification results.
It is a software component that resides on the Myla Server (PC).
4. VITEK MS Computation Engine: The VITEK MS analysis server sendsthe acquired data
to the computation engine that calculates the identification results. The algorithms and
mapping files required for identification are contained within the computation engine.
5. Myla Middeware: MylaTM is a computer application ("Middleware"), based on Web
technology, which allows data related to the laboratory workflow, laboratory instruments,
Laboratory Information System (LIS), analysis results, etc. to be grouped together.
MylaTM interfaces between the bioMérieux instruments connected to the application (e.g.,
VITEK MS) and the Laboratory Information System (LIS). MylaTM manages the VITEK
MS workflow and computes the identification results with the use of a computation
engine and organism knowledge bases.
VITEK MS
bioMérieux’s VITEK MS, is the same instrument as the Shimadzu Axima Assurance
MALDI-TOF spectrometer. The VITEK MS is manufactured for bioMérieux by Kratos
Analytical (a Shimadzu subsidiary) in Manchester, UK. The VITEK MS contains a Class 1
laser product containing a Class 3b invisible-light laser. The laser is a 337 nm nitrogen laser,
fixed focus. This speed depends on the mass of the ions with heavier molecules having a
higher moment of inertia resulting in a lower velocity. The time of transit is measured
precisely by the ions’ arrival at a particle detector. Based on the time of flight, the m/z ratio
of each particle can be determined, and a mass spectrum of the sample mixture is generated.
The recorded signal is processed by the Acquisition Station software and presented asa
spectrum of intensity versus mass in Daltons (Da).

L. Test Principle:
The VITEK MS system is based on a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of
flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS). The colony is mixed with a saturated matrix
solution and forms crystals. The ionization of this mixture by the laser induces the desorption
and transfer of protons from photo-excited matrix to analyte to form a protonated molecule.
During the analysis process, proteins are ionized without fragmentation by the coordinated

profiles using a particular algorithm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A panel of 10 reproducibility strains consisting of five moulds, three mycobacteria
and two Nocardia organisms were tested at each of three trial sites by two
technologists in duplicate on each of five days with two runs per day for a total of 60
replicates per organisms. The reproducibility study was conducted at five external
sites; three sites tested the mould reproducibility strains and three sites tested the
mycobacteria and Nocardia reproducibility strains. Three different lots of the VITEK
MS Mycobacterium/Nocardia kit and the VITEK MS Mould kit were used during
reproducibility testing. On each day of testing, sequential positions on the target slide
were assigned to the first run of the selected reproducibility samples, and randomized
for the second run. Spot positions were alternated each day between the technologist
on each day of testing. Three organisms were used for positive quality control, and
reagents alone were used for the negative control. The quality control strains were
Aspergillus brasiliensis, ATCC 16404, Mycobacterium smegmatis, ATCC 19420 and
Nocardia farcinica, ATCC 3308. Results are shown in Table 2 below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Calibrator: E. coli ATCC 8739 is used to as a calibrator. This organism is deposited
with VITEK MS-CHCA matrix on positions: xA1, xB1, xC1, of the VITEK MS-DS
target slides depending on the number of samples tested (one calibrator per
acquisition group of 16 spots). The VITEK MS goes to the calibration spot in an
acquisition group and performs a calibration. If the calibration passes, the instrument
goes to the first spot in the acquisition group. If the calibration fails, an error is
reported and VITEK MS proceeds to the next acquisition group without collecting
sample spectra. After spectra have been acquired from each sample spot in an
acquisition group, the calibration spot is checked again. The calibration sample
should provide E. coli identification at 99.9% in Myla TM software.

e. Biological Performance Equivalency Study Summary Report VITEK MS v2.2 vs
VITEK MS v3
Biological performance equivalency was demonstrated for the 193 FDA originally
claimed species using one well characterized strain per species, i.e. type or sequenced
was sub-cultured on solid media and tested triplicate (from three separate subcultures)
on the same slide after 18h to 24h of growth. In total, 627 distinct samples
representing the 193 FDA claimed species were tested with both VITEK MS systems
(V2.2 and V3.0) during the equivalency testing included:
· Gram negative Bacteria: 333 samples (111 strains x 3 replicates)
· Gram positive bacteria: 204 samples (68 strains x 3 replicates)
· Yeasts: 90 samples (30 strains x 3 replicates)
The global biological performance calculated from 627 samples (209 strains x 3
replicate) tested during this study (for each VITEK MS systems) is presented in Table
4 below. No calibration spot failures were observed with either VITEK MS system.
The rate of overall correct identification rate is 94.3% (591/627) from VITEK MS
V2.2 and 97.3% (610/627) from VITEK MS V3.0.

*Abbreviations: Low discrimination (LD); Single choice (SC)
The McNemar’s test, applied on a 2x2 contingency table (Failure vs. Success) was
used to attest the equivalency of both systems. In this test, the null hypothesis (H ) is
0
that the two proportions of success (PV3.0 and PV2.2) are at the same rate (PV3.0 =
PV2.2) or that the contingency 2x2 table is symmetric.
The McNemar test resulted in the rejection the hypothesis of equivalency between
both systems (p-value < 5%). VITEK MS V3.0 (97.3% of success) produces better
global performance than VITEK MS V2.2 (93.8% of success). The McNemar’s test
was also applied to Gram Negative, Gram Positive and Yeast groups. It was
concluded that for gram negative organisms and yeast, VITEK MS V3.0 performed as
good as VITEK MS V2.2 on this set of data. For Gram positive organisms, the
VITEK MS V3.0 system gave higher performance than VITEK MS V.2.2 on this set
of data.
With the new acquisition station (new system), the instrument was fine-tuned in order
to produce 20 more peaks (in average). A Bland-Altman scatter-plot was built for all
the samples for which provided a correct identification from both VITEK MS
systems, in order to measure the average bias observed between both systems during
this study. For each couple of values (number of peaks V3.0, number of peaks V2.2),
the average was calculated and reported on the X-axis, and then the difference
between the number of peaks from V3.0 and the number of peaks from V.2.2 was
calculated and reported on the Y-axis. (Plot not shown.) The average was 19.76
peaks, which is very close to the expected value (20 peaks). All the individual
observations were well distributed over and under the mean.

Due to update in the database (KB V3.0 0), the following bacterial identification
notes have been placed:
· In KB V3.0.0, Aeromonas sobria is displayed as a low discrimination result with
Aeromonas veronii but onlyAeromonas sobria has been clinically validated.
Aeromonas sobria, has a high level of unidentified results
· In KB V3.0.0, Bacteroides ovatus is grouped in a slashline with Bacteroides
xylanisolvens. It is not possible to distinguish between the two species. B. ovatus
is more commonly associated with human infection.
· In KB V3.0.0, Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis is integrated in a new group
Lactococcus lactis (with two other subspecies Lactococcus lactis ssp cremoris
and Lactococcus lactis ssp hordniae). In the Lactococcus lactis group, only
subspecies Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis has been clinically validated.
· In KB V3.0.0, Neisseria mucosa is grouped in a slashline with Neisseria sicca. It
is not possible to distinguish between the two species. Both species have been
associated with human infection.
· In KB V3.0.0, Staphylococcus hominis ssp hominis is integrated in a new group
Staphylococcus hominis (with another subspecies S. hominis ssp novobiosepticus).
In the Staphylococcus hominis group, only subspecies Staphylococcus hominis ssp
hominis has been clinically validated.
· In KB V3.0.0, Streptococcus salivarius ssp salivarius is displayed as a low
discrimination result with Streptococcus salivarius ssp thermophilus and
Streptococcus vestibularis but only Streptococcus salivarius ssp salivarius has
been clinically validated.
f. Age of Culture for Mycobacteria grown on Solid Media for VITEK MS Testing
A total of 734 spectra were generated through 12 testing time points from the original
test panel (M. abscessus, M. avium, M. chelonae, M. fortuitum, M. kansasii, M.
intracellulare, M. scrofulaceum and M. tuberculosis) and 80 additional spectra
generated through 10 testing time points (Day 0 to 42 days, with Day 0 being the time
sufficient growth of the culture was observed) with the additional testing of M.
smegmatis, for a total of 814 spectra. Of those 814 spectra 42 did not pass quality
control checks (number of peaks and amount of noise). Results demonstrated that the
increasing age of cultures for mycobacteria species had an impact on the quality of
spectra, number of peaks and correct identification results. Recommended testing for
correct identification for testing mycobacteria was between 0-14 days of culture
growth; with 0 days being the time sufficient growth of the culture was observed.

The results of prolonged incubation (age of culture) on a positive liquid mycobacteria
culture used for protein extraction and identification on the VITEK MS were
evaluated. Positive liquid media mycobacteria cultures were held at 35-37oC for 0, 1,
2 and 3 days (0-24, 24-48, 48-72 and 72-96 hours) post positivity by the liquid media
detection instrument. A total of 8 species (30 strains) were tested in each of the three
18

--- Page 19 ---
automated liquid media systems (MGIT, VersaTREK, and MP). VITEK MS
identification results were compared to the expected reference identification and
percent identification was calculated per testing time point. Additionally, protein
extracts prepared for age of culture testing were used to evaluate if the age of culture
from liquid media has an impact on Time To result (TTR) for total acquisition time
on the VITEK MS. A total of 358 samples were tested generating 716 spectra on the
VITEK MS (119 MGIT, 119 VersaTREK and 120 MP samples).
Overall, 90% correct identification was achieved through three days of testing when
compared to the expected reference result. Day 0 testing in the MGIT system resulted
in a high number of failed acquisition spots due to low biomass at time of positivity
by the detection system. To mitigate the risk of low biomass at time of positivity
especially in the MGIT system, it is recommended to incubate a positive sample for a
minimum of 24 hours after positivity for all liquid media types. Although all
mycobacteria species tested in this report had good performance through 96 hours of
testing; to mitigate the risk of mycobacteria transitioning to a stationary growth phase
and altering protein profiles, the maximum recommended incubation time post
positivity is 72 hours. Assessment of spot to spot variation showed no improvement
as biomass increased indicating this issue is independent of biomass. No correlation
was observed between age of culture and TTR. Therefore, an increase in biomass will
not improve TTR.
h. Nocardia Age of Culture Study for VITEK MS Testing
A set of 10 nocardia isolates were tested in duplicate at 3 time points (in hours):
T24h, T48h, T72h on three different media (Columbia Blood Agar, Chocolate Agar
with Polyvitex and Buffered Charcoal Yeast Agar). Results demonstrated the age of
culture recommended for nocardia isolates for VITEK MS acquisition is from 24 to
72 hours.
i. Mould Age of Culture Study for VITEK MS Testing
Two hundred and sixty-seven organisms were inoculated onto different media
according to their growth requirements and incubated in appropriate conditions. Two
growth times were tested per mould isolate according to their speed of growth (i.e., 2
and 8 days for rapid-growing, 5 and 10 days for medium growers and 10 and >=15
days for slow-growing organisms). 2040 spectra from 267 distinct strains,
representative of 53 moulds species from 14 genera using a variety of media were
included in the study. Based on these results, the age of culture recommended for
mould isolates for VITEK MS acquisition is from sufficient growth until ~5 days
after sufficient growth.
j. Impact of Mixed Cultures on VITEK MS ID of Mycobacteria and Nocardia From
Solid Media
To evaluate the impact of mixed cultures on the identification of mycobacteria and
19

--- Page 20 ---
nocardia using VITEK MS, Four mycobacteria and two nocardia were grown on solid
media and protein extracts were prepared following the instructions for VITEK MS
MYCOBACTERIUM/ NOCARDIA KIT. Non diluted protein extracts (High Positive
Sample and Moderate Positive Sample) were tested from each organism as well as in
mixed combinations. While the spectra profiles generated from mixed protein extracts
did not produce incorrect identifications, the algorithm could not consistently
distinguish when two organisms were present in the sample with low discrimination.
In over half of the combinations tested the High Positive Sample type outcompeted
the Moderate Positive Sample type resulting in a single choice identification of the
High Positive Sample. As a result pure cultures should always be used for protein
extraction to obtain a sample identification on the VITEK MS.
k. Impact of Mixed cultures on ID of Mycobacteria From Liquid Media
For each organism combination tested (see Table 4 below), BacT/ALERT MP culture
bottles were inoculated with the mixed culture and tested.
Table 4: Test Organism Combinations
Combination Organism 1 Organism 2
1 M.fortuitum M. smegmatis
2 M.tuberculosis M. lentiflavum
3 Nocardia asteroids M. fortuitum
4 Staphylococcus aureus M. smegmatis
5 C.albicans M. intracelluare
6 P.aeruginosa N. asteroides
Out of the 24 spectra generated for mixed cultures, 22 resulted in single choice
identification of one of the two species present. The other two spectra generated ‘Not
Enough Peaks’ and ‘Low Discrimination’ calls. Testing of pure cultures is
recommended.
l. Impact of Mixed Cultures on Mould ID
Five molds, representative of clinically prevalent classes, were grown at 30oC on
Sabouraud Dextrose Agar, extracted and tested in combinations of high and moderate
concentrations. Each combination was tested in quadruplicate. The eight mixes were
always identified to at least one of the two species or both species present in the mix.
Testing of pure cultures is recommended.
m. Mycobacteria Carry Over and Cross Contamination Study
The potential for carry over and cross contamination of protein extracts when testing
mycobacteria on the VITEK MS was evaluated. Five mycobacteria species were
grown on solid medium and protein extracts were prepared following manufactures
instructions for VITEK MS MYCOBACTERIUM/NOCARDIA KIT. High Positive,
Moderate Positive, and Negative samples were spotted in an alternating fashion in
order to assess the carry over and cross contamination. All negative samples tested
resulted in ‘No Identification’ on the VITEK MS. indicating no carry over or cross
20

--- Page 21 ---
contamination was observed during this study. All High and Moderate Positive
samples provided the expected results.
n. Mould and Nocardia Carry Over and Cross Contamination Study
Six moulds and six nocardia were grown on solid medium and protein extracts were
prepared following manufactures instructions. High Positive, Moderate Positive, and
Negative samples were spotted in an alternating fashion in order to assess the carry
over and cross contamination. All negative samples tested resulted in No
Identification on the VITEK MS. indicating no carry over or cross contamination was
observed during this study. All High and Moderate Positive samples provided the
expected results.
o. Protein Stability for Mycobacteria and Nocardia Solid Media Extractions
The stability of protein extracts of mycobacteria and nocardia prior to spotting on
VITEK MS DS target slides was evaluated. The stability of a protein extract was
defined as acceptable storage temperature and time after the extraction from the
respective culture. Two solid media types were used for mycobacteria and one solid
medium type for Nocardia species. Three extracts per organism and per media type
were prepared. Protein extracts were held at refrigerated (2 - 8°C), frozen (-19 to -
31°C), and room temperatures (15 - 25°C). Protein extracts were tested at different
time points ranging from 0 to 21 days post extraction. Additionally, freeze-thaw
cycles were also tested to determine if freezing and thawing the extracts would
degrade protein extracts. Based on the data generated from this study, the preferred
holding temperature and time is frozen (-19 to -31°C} up to 14 days for both
mycobacteria and Nocardia species. At other temperatures, the protein extracts tend
to evaporate and become difficult to obtain the sufficient volume required for spotting
on VITEK MS DS target slides leading to inconsistent identification. Freeze-thaw
cycle results indicate that mycobacteria and nocardia samples are stable for up to two
freeze-thaw cycles.
p. Protein Stability for Mycobacteria from Liquid Media Extractions
The stability of protein extracts of mycobacteria from liquid medium prior to spotting
on VITEK MS DS target slides was evaluated. The stability of a protein extract was
defined as acceptable storage temperature and time after the extraction from the
respective culture.
BacT/ALERT® MP bottles (MP) and BACTEC MGITTM 960 tubes (MGIT) were
evaluated in the study. Four extracts per organism and per media type were prepared.
Protein extracts were held at room temperature (15°C to 25°C), refrigerated (2°C to
8°C), and frozen (-19°C to -31°). Protein extracts were tested at different time points
ranging from 0 to 21 days post extraction. Additionally, freeze-thaw cycles were also
tested to determine if freezing and thawing the extracts would degrade protein
extracts.
21

--- Page 22 ---
Based on the data generated from this study, the extract was determined to be stable
when frozen (-19 to - 31°C) for up to 21 days. At refrigerated and room temperature,
samples remained stable for at least 36 hours but sample degradation caused a
reduced rate of correct identifications by day 3.
Based on the results of this study, it was recommended to test protein extracts on the
same day of the extraction; however if this is not possible, it is recommended to stay
consistent with extract stability recommendation for solid media mycobacterium and
solid media nocardia. As such, mycobacterium protein extracts from liquid medium
can be stored at frozen temperatures (-19 to -31°C) up to 14 days. Frozen extracts can
be used up to two freeze thaw cycles for consistent identification results.
q. Stability of Moulds Extracts
Initially, a set of 10 molds were tested at 0,1,3,7,14, and 21 days post extraction using
3 storage temperatures : Room Temperature (RT): 15 - 25°C ; refrigerated: 2 - 8°C ;
frozen: -19 to -31°C. Four freeze-thaw cycles were also performed for each mould
extract. An additional set of eight molds was tested at the frozen storage temperature
after obtaining inconsistent results on the first set of 10 strains. The freeze-thaw
cycles experiment was performed on 18 strains that were kept in the freezer.
It was determined that the extracts were not stable after one day at RT or refrigerated.
Higher mould identification rates were obtained when the extracts are frozen, but the
results were inconsistent and varied depending on the species and strains tested even
after multiple testing on an extensive dataset. The extracts were also not stable after
one freeze-thaw cycle. Therefore, it was concluded that the extracts of molds are not
stable regardless of the storage conditions and must be spotted within 8 hours on the
day of extraction. The package insert indicates to spot 1 μL of the supernatant
immediately on a target slide.
r. Stability of Extract Deposits of Moulds, Nocardia, and Mycobacteria
A study was performed to determine the stability of the mycobacteria, nocardia and
mould deposits on the target slide after matrix addition and before spectra acquisition.
It is recommended that data acquisition be performed at a maximum of 3 days after
matrix addition.
s. Stability of Extract Deposits of Mycobacterium from Liquid Media
The stability of mycobacteria protein extracts from liquid media deposited on a target
slide with the addition of CHCA matrix was determined. Mycobacteria species were
grown in different automated liquid media systems and protein extracts were prepared
manufacturer’s instructions. Target slides were left at room temperature in original
packaging and sample acquisition of protein extracts occurred initially and every day
for up to four days. Identification results of protein deposit s were compared to initial
22

--- Page 23 ---
results to assess the effects of prolonged acquisition.
Overall, 90% correct identification when compared to the expected reference results
was achieved through four days of testing. An increase in failed acquisition spots was
observed at T4 and average peaks counts decreased from T0 - T4. Therefore,
recommended storage for prepared target slides will be up to 3 days at room
temperature in the original packaging.
t. VITEK MS Liquid Media Interfering Substances
The potential for sputum digestion/decontamination reagents and/or liquid media
components to cause an interference on the VITEK MS and/or impact identification
of mycobacteria protein extracts on the VITEK MS was evaluated. Mycobacteria
species were grown in automated liquid media detection systems and protein extracts
were prepared per manufacturer’s instructions. Interference was tested using negative
and positive samples with and without growth (GS) and antimicrobial (AS)
supplements testeq in combination with sputum processing reagents N-acetyl-L-
cysteine (NALC)- sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (NALC-NaOH). Impact on
identification was tested using VersaTRE K® Myco bottles and BBLTM MGITTM 960
tubes inoculated with patient samples processed with NALC-NaOH sputum
digestion/decontamination method. Samples inoculated into VersaTREK bottles were
freshly processed (never frozen). For MGIT tubes frozen processed sputum samples
exposed to one or more freeze thaw cycles were used.
All positive samples tested resulted in correct species level identification and all
negative samples resulted in ‘No Identification’ due to ‘Not Enough Peaks’. Results
indicate that if the protocol is followed as designed, neither sputum
digestion/decontamination nor liquid media components cause an interference on the
VITEK MS.
Identification results for samples tested in VersaTREK bottles met acceptance criteria
of 90% correct identification indicating no impact on identification when using fresh
(never frozen) sputum samples. Samples tested from MGIT tubes resulted in a high
number of ‘No Identification’ results and did not meet the acceptance criteria. Upon
further investigation, results indicated using frozen processed sputum samples
inoculated in liquid media and then used for identification impacts identification. It is
recommended to use the fresh processed sputum sample and not to use a frozen
processed sputum sample as an inoculation source for liquid media to minimize the
risk of ‘No identification’ on the VITEK MS.
u. Verification of Inactivation and Extraction of Mycobacteria from Liquid Media
This study was performed to verify the modifications selected for improving the
robustness of mycobacteria liquid media extraction workflow. The combination of
sample processing between 24-72 hour post positivity, 3 ml sample volume, and use
of the 5 ml tube improved the identification success for all liquid media types.
23

--- Page 24 ---
This study included eight (8) clinically prevalent Mycobacterium species from
different automated liquid media systems including BacT/ALERT® MP bottles (MP),
BACTEC™ MGIT™ 960 tubes (MGIT), and VersaTREK® Myco bottles
(VersaTREK) on the VITEK MS.
Testing 24-48 hours post positivity performed above 90% correct species level
identification and met the acceptance criterion; however some spectra failed original
quality checks (Not Enough Peaks, Too Many Peaks) and either had to be re-spotted
(same extract) or re-extracted from a new culture. Testing at 48-72 hours post
positivity improved identification success resulting in no final results of No ID or
sample re extractions. None of the spectra failed initial quality checks.
The recommended window for testing mycobacterium from liquid medium is 24-72
hours post instrument declaring bottle/tube positive. If spectral quality checks do not
pass (Not Enough Peaks, Too Many Peaks) or No Identification is resulted on the
original deposit, it is recommended to re-spot from the same extract. If spectral
checks still do not pass, it is recommended that the sample be re-extracted if the
bottle/tube is still within 24-72 hour window.
v. Validation of Inactivation of Mycobacterium and Nocardia from solid media
The sample preparation of mycobacteria and nocardia requires additional steps as
compared to the standard procedure due to their infectious nature. It is important to
inactivate the cultures to make the samples safe for handling outside of a Biosafety
Level-3 (BSL-3/P3) environment. Several studies were conducted for establishing a
protocol for inactivation of mycobacteria and nocardia for VITEK MS. Inactivation
studies were performed on solid media (LJ, 7H11 and TSB agar plates) with various
species of mycobacteria and nocardia including drug sensitive and resistant strains of
M. tuberculosis.
The optimal inactivation was obtained by five minutes mechanical disruption with
bead beating in ethanol using glass beads in a pre-sterile tube. This step breaks up
clumps of cells allowing the ethanol to come in contact with all cells, as well as
disrupting the thick waxy mycobacterial cell walls. The sample tube is then incubated
at room temperature for 10 minutes in order to allow the ethanol to inactivate all cells.
After inactivation, the suspension is transferred into another tube and centrifuged to
create a pellet of the cell matter and the ethanol supernatant is discarded.
w. Validation of Inactivation of Moulds
The inactivation step was verified with 16 mould species among 12 different genera.
Following manufacturer extraction instructions, it was found that the inactivation is
effective after the second centrifugation step using 70% formic acid and 100%
acetonitrile addition. The first step using 70% ethanol is not sufficient to allow a
complete inactivation of the sample.
24

--- Page 25 ---
The inactivation was verified after the second step of centrifugation by mixing the
supernatant and the pellet. A 10 ul sample of this suspension was subcultured on
Sabouraud Dextrose Agar plate and incubated from 8 days to 8 weeks depending on
the tested strains. Tests were performed at two different colony ages or at least using
the older culture in order to work on conidia/spores representing the more resistant
stage. No growth was demonstrated after the incubation period.
x. Identification of Mycobacterium spp. from BacT ALERT MP Using Simulated Sputum
Processing
This study was designed to demonstrate the ability of the VITEK MS to generate
spectra from simulated clinical samples inoculated into liquid media and identify
mycobacteria at the species level. Simulated sputum was spiked with mycobacteria
and contaminating respiratory flora organisms and underwent sputum processing
prior to inoculation into BacT/ALERT® MP bottles.
Out of a test panel including 20 species and 77 strains, at total of 385 spectra were
collected. Overall results were 99.7% correct identification (excluding no
identification results) and 1.0% no identification.
Based on the results of this study, the VITEK MS system performs acceptably when
analyzing simulated clinical samples from BacT/ALERT® MP bottles.
y. Reproducibility for Mycobacteria from Liquid Media Summary Report
This study examined the reproducibility of mycobacterium identifications on the
VITEK MS system from liquid media. A panel of representative mycobacteria
species were grown in three different liquid media detection systems over five days
on VITEK MS instruments at two different sites with multiple operators.
Mycobacteria species were grown in BacT/ALERT® MP (MP) bottles at Site 1 and
both BBL MGIT™ 960 tubes (MGIT) and VersaTREK™ Myco bottles(Versa
Trek) at Site 2. On each day of testing, two extracts from positive liquid samples
were performed for each species tested. Each technologist prepared two (2) slides
per day of testing, one from each extract. Extracts were deposited in sequential
order on one slide and in randomized order on the second slide for each day of
testing. Extracts were prepared following manufacturer’s instructions for VITEK
MS MYCOBACTERIUM/NOCARDIA KIT.
The organism-specific and overall rates of correct identification results for both
sites combined are ≥95%. The confidence intervals for the organism specific and
overall rates of correct identification contain 95%.
z. Analytical specificity:
25

Rhodococcus, Tsukamurella, Streptomyces, Segniliparus, Williamsia Study: In this
study, a panel of 14 strains (including two to three representative strains of each
genus) were tested with VITEK MS V3.
These strains were tested in parallel using the extraction protocol and direct deposit.
When tested with the extraction protocol, none of the 14 strains were identified as a
mycobacteria or nocardia, which was in agreement with the acceptance criterion.
When tested by direct deposit, only one strain (Segniliparus rugosus) of the 14 strains
was identified as Mycobacterium szulgai. The remaining 13 strains were not
identified as a mycobacterium or nocardia. A note was added to the user manual
indicated that a result of mycobacteria obtained by direct deposit should be confirmed
by retesting the strain using the extraction kit. When considering both approaches
together(direct deposit and extraction), the panel of 14 strains representing
Rhodococcus, Tsukamurella, Streptomyces, Segniliparus and Williamsia genus were
not identified as a mycobacteria or nocardia.
Additional exclusivity testing was performed for Actinomadura, Amycolatopsis and
Nocardia species extracts (one per strain). All were prepared following manufacturer
instructions for nocardia colonies. Each extract is spotted in triplicate on the VITEK
MS slide. Results are found in Tables 5 and 6 below.

aa.Assay cut-off:
After the calibration is accepted for an acquisition group, the VITEK MS acquires the
spectra for the samples in that group. A perfect match between the spectrum and the
unique spectrum of a single organism or organism group would provide a percent
probability of 99.9. Results are displayed as follows:
• A single identification is displayed with confidence value of 60 to 99.9 when one
significant organism or organism group is retained.
• Low Discrimination identifications are displayed when more than one significant
organism or organism group are retained, but not for more than 4 organisms. In
this case, the sum of confidence values is equal to 100.
• When more than 4 organisms or organism groups are found, the organism is
considered as non-identified. In this case, a list of possible organisms is displayed
and the sum of confidence values is less than 100.
• When no match is found, the organism is considered as non-identified.

Challenge Study: One hundred well-characterized challenge strains including 50
moulds, 35 mycobacteria and 15 nocardia strains were evaluated. Three trial sites
tested the mould challenge strains and three different trial sites tested the
mycobacteria and nocardia challenge strains. Organism identifications were masked
to the technologist performing the testing. Results from this study are summarized in
Table 11 below.

The following performance characteristics were obtained by testing routine fresh strains from
patient cultures, including moulds, mycobacteria and nocardia, in five clinical microbiology
laboratories in the United States. Each VITEK MS identification was compared to a reference
identification determined by molecular sequencing supplemented as needed by additional pre-
defined testing.

VITEK MS acquisition station:
For VITEK MS v3 / KB v3.0.0, the Acquisition Station Software was optimized to
account for the detection of higher mass peaks, relevant for some moulds and
Mycobacterium. The Acquisition Station Software was updated from v1.4.2 to v1.5.0.
The most significant change to the Acquisition Station algorithms in v1.5.0 is the
rastering strategy. As the spectrum is acquired for each target spot, it is visible in the
Spectrum Display on the Acquisition Screen with the number of profiles incrementing as
they are collected.
In the Acquisition Station v1.5.0, the acquisition process stops when the target of 100
good profiles is achieved, or when all raster points have been visited. As with v1.4.2, if
the final total of good profiles is less than 30 then the acquisition has failed, and if more
than 30 good profiles are obtained then the spectrum is acceptable.
The following software has remained unchanged from VITEK MS v2; see DEN130013
(K124067).
· VITEK MS Sample Prep Station software
· VITEKS Analysis Server / Software and
· VITEK MS Computation Engine
· Myla Middleware
3. Specimen Identification:
Same as DEN130013 (K124067).
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Cultures of mould must be processed and inactivated before spotting to the target slide.
Cultures of Mycobacterium (liquid and solid) and Nocardia must be processed and
inactivated before spotting to the target slide.
