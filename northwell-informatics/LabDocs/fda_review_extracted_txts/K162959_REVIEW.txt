SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
OIR Decision Summary
To: THE FILE RE: DOCUMENT NUMBER K162959
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own
Class II, Class III or Class I device requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device:
DiaSorin LIAISON® EA IgG
510(k) number: K060204
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as
described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes
instructions for use, and package labeling.
The intended use of the DiaSorin LIAISON® EA IgG assay did not change. The intended use of
the Controls (required for the assay and sold separately) was updated to reflect the change in
the Control matrix.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATIONS in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the
FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.
A. Changes to the LIAISON® EA IgG assay
1. The Quality Control section of the package insert is updated to reflect the change in
the Control matrix.
B. Changes to the LIAISON® Control EA IgG:
1. The name is changed to LIAISON® EA IgG Serum Control Set.
2. The Positive and Negative Controls included in the LIAISON® EA IgG Serum
Control Set (Controls) are provided in a matrix of 100% human serum/defibrinated
plasma instead of in a matrix comprised of buffer and 5% human
serum/defibrinated plasma.
3. The Open Use stability claim of the LIAISON® EA IgG Serum Control Set is
extended from 4 weeks to 8 weeks when stored at 2 – 8oC. The storage conditions
of the Controls did not change.

b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities
required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.
Stability studies on the modified Controls were performed. Precision and matrix effect studies
were also performed.
c) A “Declaration of Conformity” statement was also submitted for the manufacturing facility and
validation activities and signed by the Senior Director Regulatory Affairs and Quality
Assurance. The statements indicate that:
I. The manufacturing facility is in conformance with design control procedure
requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are available for
review.
II. The validation activities, as required by the risk analysis, for the modification
were performed by the designated individuals and the results demonstrated that
the predetermined acceptance criteria were met.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended
use for the device, the LIAISON® EA IgG assay, is unaffected by the modification. The intended use
of the component LIAISON® EA IgG Serum Control Set was updated to reflect the change in
composition of the Control matrix. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular
modifications and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices
demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has
provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I
recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
