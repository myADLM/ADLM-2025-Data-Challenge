SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
OIR Decision Summary
To: THE FILE RE: DOCUMENT NUMBER K162961
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own
Class II, Class III or Class I device requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device:
DiaSorin LIAISON® VCA IgG
DiaSorin LIAISON® EBNA IgG
510(k) number: K040120
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as
described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes
instructions for use, and package labeling.
The intended uses of the DiaSorin LIAISON® VCA IgG assay and the DiaSorin LIAISON®EBNA
IgG assay did not change. The intended uses of the Controls (required for the assays and sold
separately) were updated to reflect the change in the Control matrix.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATIONS in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the
FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.
A. Changes to the DiaSorin LIAISON® VCA IgG assay and the DiaSorin LIAISON®EBNA
IgG assay:
1. The Quality Control section of the package inserts was updated to reflect the
change in the Control matrix.
B. Changes to the LIAISON® Control VCA IgG and the LIAISON® Control EBNA IgG:
1. The names are changed to LIAISON® VCA IgG Serum Control Set and LIAISON®
EBNA IgG Serum Control Set.
2. The Positive and Negative Controls included in the LIAISON® VCA IgG Serum
Control Set and the LIAISON® EBNA IgG Serum Control Set are provided in a
matrix of 100% human serum/defibrinated plasma instead of in a matrix comprised
of buffer and 5% human serum/defibrinated plasma.
3. The Open Use stability claim of the LIAISON® VCA IgG Serum Control Set and the
LIAISON® EBNA IgG Serum Control Set is extended from 4 weeks to 8 weeks
when stored at 2 – 8oC. The storage conditions of the Controls did not change.

b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities
required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.
Stability studies on the modified Controls were performed. Precision and matrix effect studies
were also performed.
c) A “Declaration of Conformity” statement was also submitted for the manufacturing facility and
validation activities and signed by the Senior Director Regulatory Affairs and Quality
Assurance. The statements indicate that:
I. The manufacturing facility is in conformance with design control procedure
requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are available for
review.
II. The validation activities, as required by the risk analysis, for the modification
were performed by the designated individuals and the results demonstrated that
the predetermined acceptance criteria were met.
The labeling for these modified subject devices has been reviewed to verify that the
indications/intended uses for the devices, the LIAISON® VCA IgG assay and the LIAISON® EBNA
IgG assay, are unaffected by the modification. The intended uses of the components, the LIAISON®
VCA IgG Serum Control Set and the LIAISON® EBNA IgG Serum Control Set, were updated to
reflect the change in composition of the Control matrix. In addition, the submitter’s description of the
particular modifications and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified
devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has
provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I
recommend the devices be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared devices.
