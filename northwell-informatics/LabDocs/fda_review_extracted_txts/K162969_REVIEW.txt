SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
OIR Decision Summary
To: THE FILE RE: DOCUMENT NUMBER K162969
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own
Class II, Class III or Class I device requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device:
DiaSorin LIAISON® CMV IgG
510(k) number: K040290
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as
described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes
instructions for use, and package labeling.
The intended use of the DiaSorin LIAISON® CMV IgG assay did not change. The intended use of
the Controls (required for the assay and sold separately) was updated to reflect the change in the
Control matrix.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATIONS in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the
FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.
A. Changes to the DiaSorin LIAISON® CMV IgG assay:
1. The Quality Control section of the package insert was updated to reflect the change
in the Control matrix.
B. Changes to the LIAISON® Control CMV IgG:
1. The name is changed to LIAISON® CMV IgG Serum Control Set.
2. The Positive and Negative Controls included in the LIAISON® CMV IgG Serum
Control Set are provided in a matrix of 100% human serum/defibrinated plasma
instead of in a matrix comprised of buffer and 5% human serum/defibrinated
plasma.
3. The Open Use stability claim of the LIAISON® CMV IgG Serum Control Set is
extended from 4 weeks to 8 weeks when stored at 2 – 8oC. The storage condition
of the Controls did not change.

5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method used to assess the impact of the modification on the
device and its components, and the results of the analysis.
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities
required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.
Stability studies on the modified Controls were performed. Precision and matrix effect studies
were also performed.
c) A “Declaration of Conformity” statement was also submitted for the manufacturing facility and
validation activities and signed by the Senior Director Regulatory Affairs and Quality
Assurance. The statements indicate that:
I. The manufacturing facility is in conformance with design control procedure
requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are available for
review.
II. The validation activities, as required by the risk analysis, for the modification
were performed by the designated individuals and the results demonstrated that
the predetermined acceptance criteria were met.
The labeling for these modified subject devices has been reviewed to verify that the
indication/intended use for the device, the LIAISON® CMV IgG assay, is unaffected by the
modification. The intended use of the component, the LIAISON® CMV IgG Serum Control Set, was
updated to reflect the change in composition of the Control matrix. In addition, the submitter’s
description of the particular modifications and the comparative information between the modified and
unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The
submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and
on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously
cleared device.
