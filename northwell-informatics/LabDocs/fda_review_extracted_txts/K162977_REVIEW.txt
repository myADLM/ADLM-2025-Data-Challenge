E. System Descriptions:
1. DeviceDescription:
The ADVIA 2120/2120i is a fully automated differential cell counter and consists of an
analytical module that aspirates, dilutes, and analyzes whole blood samples; an
autosampler that automatically mixes, identifies, and presents samples for processing; a
computer workstation that controls the instrument, provides primary user interface with
the instrument and manages the data produced by the instrument; and a printer that
optionally generates reports based on the instrument results.
2. Principles of Operation:
1

--- Page 2 ---
WBC Count
The whole blood sample is mixed with ADVIA 120/2120/2120i BASO reagent that
contains acid and surfactant. The red blood cells are hemolyzed, and the white blood cells
are then analyzed using two-angle laser light scatter signals.
Red Blood Cell and Platelet Counts
Red blood cells and platelets are analyzed by a single optical cytometer after appropriate
dilution of the blood sample with ADVIA 120/2120/2120i RBC/PLT reagent (CBC
TIMEPAC). The red blood cells are isovolumetrically sphered and lightly fixed to
preserve the spherical shape. Red cells and platelets are counted from the signals from a
common detector with two different gain settings.
Red Blood Cell and Platelet Size
Simultaneous measurement of laser light scattered at two different angular intervals is
used to determine the size of red blood cells and platelets.
Hemoglobin
The hemoglobin method employs a modification of the manual cyanmethemoglobin
method.
WBC Differential (DIFF) Method
The ADVIA 2120/2120i utilizes the Peroxidase and Basophil/Lobularity methods to
quantitatively measure the following hematological parameters: neutrophils,
lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, large unstained cells, and basophils. With the
Peroxidase method, leukocytes are classified by the characteristic properties exhibited by
cell-specific constituents when the cells are treated with cytochemical stains. With the
Basophil/Lobularity method, red blood cells are hemolyzed and the cytoplasm is stripped
from all white blood cells except basophils. The sample is then analyzed by two-angle
laser light scattering detection using a laser diode. The white cells are classified into three
categories: basophils, mononuclear (MN) cells, and polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells.
Reticulocyte Count and Size
To determine the reticulocyte count, the ADVIA120/2120/2120i autoRETIC reagent
isovolumetrically spheres the erythroid cells and stains cellular RNA. Low-angle laser
light scatter, high-angle laser light scatter, and absorption characteristics of all cells are
counted and measured. The absorption data are used to classify each cell as a reticulocyte
or mature red blood cell based on its RNA content. The method of sizing reticulocytes
uses the simultaneous measurement of laser light scattered at two different angular
intervals.
2

--- Page 3 ---
Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Method
The CSF sample is mixed with ADVIA 120/2120/2120i CSF reagent, which spheres and
fixes the cells. After a minimum 4-minute to 4-hour incubation period, the prepared
sample is then aspirated directly into the ADVIA 120/2120/2120i system. The cells are
then detected and enumerated based on light scatter and absorbance measurements using
the ADVIA 120/2120/2120i laser optics. A scatter versus scatter and scatter versus
absorbance cytogram is displayed with the thresholds and results automatically calculated
for each sample. Reportable parameters are WBC and RBC counts along with absolute
and percentage counts for neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, polymorphonuclear
(PMN), and mononuclear (MN) cells.
Body Fluid Method
The ADVIA 2120/2120i Body Fluid Application uses the Basophil/Lobularity and
RBC/Plt channels to enumerate the total nucleated (TNC) and RBC counts. The TNC
count is derived from the Basophil/Lobularity channel. The ADVIA120/2120/2120i
BASO reagent contains surfactant and phthalic acid which, in the presence of low heat in
the Baso channel reaction chamber, lyses RBCs and strips the cytoplasmic membrane
from all leukocytes except basophils. This cell suspension is subsequently passed through
the flowcell. The cell suspension is intercepted by light from the laser diode where the
low-angle light scatter (2° to 3°) and high-angle light scatter (5° to 15°) signals of each
cell are counted.
The RBC count is derived from the RBC/Plt channel. The ADVIA120/2120/2120i
RBC/Plt reagent spheres and fixes the RBCs. The same flowcell, low-angle and high-
angle light scatter signals as the Basophil/Lobularity channel are used to count the RBCs.
3. Modes of Operation:
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes ___X____ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ________ or No ____X_____
4. Specimen Identification:
Sample identification is performed by the following methods: manual entry, scanning
with a barcode reader, automatic incremental numbering, and rack/position numbering in
the autosampler mode.
3

--- Page 4 ---
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Body fluid and whole blood samples must be manually mixed by gentle inversion when
analyzed in the manual open tube and manual closed tube modes.
Whole blood samples aspirated in the automated closed tube mode are automatically
mixed. The automated closed tube sampler rotates first to 45° then to 135°, staying at
each orientation for a minimum of 0.6 seconds and a maximum of 15 seconds. A total of
25 mixer-cycles are required before aspiration. Fully mixed samples which have a dwell
of over 15 seconds require an additional 20 mixer cycles before aspiration. If a dwell
exceeds 5 minutes, the samples must be mixed again for 45 cycles before aspiration.
6. Calibration:
The system must be calibrated for all parameters except %Retic. The ADVIA SETpoint
Calibrator is recommended.
7. Quality Control:
ADVIA TESTpoint Hematology Controls are the recommended assayed quality controls.
Quality controls should be assayed at an interval selected by the laboratory, after a
change in reagent lot number, and after the replacement of any part or component of the
analytical module that may affect the analytical performance.

To obtain measures of within-device imprecision (%CV and SD), three levels of
ADVIA TESTpoint 3in1 Controls (Abnormal 1, Abnormal 2, and Normal) and two
levels of CSF Controls (Level 1 and Level 2) were analyzed over 28 days, two runs
per day and two replicates per run. The results of each study were within the
predefined acceptance criteria for SD or %CV.
c. Linearity:
The linear ranges for the WBC, RBC, Hgb, PLT and %Retic parameters were
established by testing two different sample sets (for each parameter with a wide
overlap) prepared by diluting FDA cleared commercially available linearity materials
to span the analytical measuring range (AMR). The linear ranges for the CSF RBC
and body fluid (BF) RBC parameters were established by testing diluted samples
prepared from anticoagulated whole blood. Results for each parameter were within
the predefined acceptance criteria.

BF TNC (x103/µL) 0.02–400
BF RBC (x106/µL) 0.01–6.76
d. Carryover:
Carryover studies for the WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT parameters were conducted
using pooled whole blood as high target value (HTV) samples and plasma as low
target value (LTV) samples. Testing was conducted by aspirating a HTV whole blood

sample in triplicate followed by triplicate analysis of plasma-based LTV samples.
Carryover was calculated according to the following calculation.
% Carryover = (LTV1 – LTV3)/(HTV3 – LTV3) x 100
The results of the carryover study were within the predefined specifications of ≤ 1.0%
for WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT in the autosampler, manual-open and manual-closed
tube modes.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
L. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
