4. Special instrument requirements:
VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact Systems
I. Device Description:
The VITEK® 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the
doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).
Each VITEK® 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient
medium is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of
antimicrobials combined with the nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a
standardized concentration with 0.45% to 0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the
antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK® 2 System will automatically dilute the
bacterial suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then the VITEK® 2 will
fill, seal and place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK® 2 Compact has a manual
filling, sealing and loading operation. The VITEK® 2 Systems monitor the growth of each
well in the card over a defined period of time (up to 24 hours for Streptococcus Species). The
analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based on attenuation of light
measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the minimum inhibitory
concentration or “MIC” values for the anti-microbial agent. At the completion of the
incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive
category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK® 2 AST-GN Tigecycline has the following concentrations in the card: 1.5, 4 and 8
µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL). The MIC result
range for the VITEK® 2 is ≤ 0.5 - ≥ 8 µg/mL.

L. Test Principle:
The VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection
using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics used in the systems use
visible light to directly measure organism growth. Transmittance optics are based on an
initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Periodic light
transmittance samplings of the same well measure organism growth by how much light is
prevented from going through the well. The VITEK® 2 System monitors the growth of each
well in the card over a defined period of time. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16
hours for a “rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in some instances. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along
with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic on the card.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three sites using ten isolates of gram-
negative bacilli that were consistent with the intended use. Isolates were tested in
triplicate over three days for a total of 270 data points. The isolates tested in the
reproducibility study included Enterobacter cloacae (two isolates), Enterobacter
aerogenes (two isolates), Serratia marcescens (three isolates), and Klebsiella
pneumoniae (three isolates). Inocula were prepared both manually and using
automatic dilution for testing in the VITEK2. Inocula were prepared manually for
testing in the VITEK2 Compact. The mode MIC value was determined and the
reproducibility was calculated based on MIC values falling within +/- 1 dilution of
the mode MIC value.
Using VITEK2 and automatic dilution, best case reproducibility was 99.6%; worst
case reproducibility was 99.3%.
Using VITEK2 and manual dilution, all results were on scale and the reproducibility
was 100%.
Using VITEK® 2 Compact and manual dilution, best case reproducibility was 99.6%;
worst case reproducibility was 97.8%.

--- Page 7 ---
The reproducibility results were acceptable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
N/A
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Inoculum Density Check. The inoculum density was monitored using the
DensiCHEK Plus™ instrument. The DensiCHEK Plus™ was standardized weekly
with all results recorded and in expected range.
Purity Check: A purity check of all organisms was performed at the time of VITEK2
card inoculation. Only results obtained with pure cultures were evaluated.
Growth Failure Rate: During the course of the study there were no growth failures
in the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative cards.
Quality Control Testing. The CLSI-recommended QC organism (E. coli ATCC
25922) was tested using both the VITEK 2 card and the reference method at each site
using both the automatic dilution and manual dilution methods for the VITEK 2 and
using the manual dilution method for the VITEK 2 Compact.
The expected range for E. coli ATCC 25922 with tigecycline is 0.03 – 0.25 µg/mL.
The tigecycline concentrations included in the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card
are 1.5, 4, and 8 µg/mL and the reporting range is ≤0.5 - ≥8 µg/mL. Therefore, all
results for the QC strain were off-scale for the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact
Systems and were reported as ≤0.5 µg/mL (Table 2). In response to an FDA request
for additional information regarding production and process controls to verify the
performance of the device, the sponsor indicated that no other QC strains suitable for
the Enterobacteriaceae claim could be identified that would cover the expected
tigecycline MIC ranges based on CLSI or FDA drug label. Therefore, there was no
specific recommendation for any additional QC strains to be tested, but the sponsor’s
internal QC process assures that the devices are produced and manufactured
appropriateley. Furthermore, and to inform the end-user of this point, the sponsor
included the following footnote to the QC table in the device labeling:
“The VITEK 2 Gram Negative tigecycline does not include the full CLSI/FDA-
recommended dilution ranges for QC testing with this organism.”

µg/mL. The reference panel contained two-fold serial dilutions with a range of 0.0156
to 32 µg/mL.
Test inocula were standardized using the DensiCHEK Plus instrument. VITEK 2 AST
– Gram Negative cards were inoculated using automatic dilution (for reading on the
VITEK 2 instrument) or using a manual dilution method (for reading on the VITEK 2
instrument or on the VITEK 2 COMPACT instrument). Reference panels were
inoculated as outlined in the CLSI document M07-A9.
A total of 637 Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates were evaluated at three sites with
VITEK 2 AST – Gram Negative cards inoculated by automatic dilution and
interpreted using the VITEK 2 instrument. The majority of isolates were fresh (569
isolates, 89%); 68 isolates (11%) were stock isolates.
A total of 75 challenge isolates were tested at one site. The challenge set was tested
with both card inoculation options (automatic dilution and manual dilution) on the
VITEK 2 system and with the manual dilution on the VITEK 2 Compact system.
For MICs interpreted using the VITEK 2 system an inoculated using the automatic
dilution method, the combined results from the clinical and challenge testing
demonstrated a combined EA of 98.9% and CA of 98.6% (Table 3). A total of 96
isolates were determined to have evaluable results; the EA of the evaluable results
was 91.7%. There were 2 major errors (0.3%) and no very major errors identified.
The performance based on combined clinical and challenge data was acceptable.

Essential agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the results of the reference method and that of
VITEK2 test card within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that
are on scale for both the VITEK2 test card and the reference method. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the
interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the VITEK2 test card.
Challenge isolates interpreted using the VITEK2 and inoculated using the manual
dilution method demonstrated an EA of 98.7% and a CA of 94.7% (Table 4). A total
of 17 isolates were determined to have evaluable results; the EA of the evaluable
results was 94.1%. There were no major or very major errors identified.

Only two resistant isolates were tested with this device, one clinical isolate and one
challenge isolate. Due to the lack of available resistant isolates at the time of
comparative testing the sponsor was asked to include the following limitation in their
device labeling:
The ability of the AST card to detect resistance with the following combination(s)
is unknown because resistant strains were not available at the time of
comparative testing:
Tigecycline: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli,
Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumonia, Citrobacter koseri, Enterobacter
aerogenes, Serratia marcescens
Trending. Analysis of trending of MIC values indicated that overall for all
Enterobacteriaceae no trending was observed. However, when evaluated by species
MICs for K. pneumoniae tended to be one dilution higher than the reference method
and MICs for S. marcescens tended to be one dilution lower than the reference
method. The following footnote to the performance table was added to the device
labeling.
Overall VITEK 2 Tigecycline MICs showed no trending. However, compared to
reference broth microdilution, K. pneumoniae results tended to be one dilution
higher; results for S. marcescens tended to be one dilution lower.
