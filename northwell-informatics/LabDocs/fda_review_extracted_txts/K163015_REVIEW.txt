K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced:
Not applicable
L. Test Principle:
Not applicable
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The mean values and corresponding ± 3 standard deviation ranges in the Assignment
of Values Data Charts were derived from replicate analyses by different clinical
laboratories using Bio-Rad’s protocol or by manufacturers’ using their own value
assignment protocols; each value is specific for this lot of product and clinical
analyzer. The tests listed were performed by the manufacturer and/or independent
laboratories using manufacturer supported reagents and a representative sampling of
this lot of product. It is recommended that each laboratory establish its own
acceptable ranges and use those provided only as guides.
Stability Studies:
Real-time stability studies were performed to establish thawed stability claims.
Thawed and open-vial stability when stored at 2ºC–8ºC is as follows: IGF-1 is 15
days, CA 125 is 10 days, and all other analytes are 30 days.
Thawed and unopened-vial stability when stored at 2ºC–8ºC is as follows: IGF-1 is
35 days, free PSA is 30 days, CA 125 is 14 days, and all other analytes are 60 days.
Frozen aliquot stability is 30 days when stored at −20ºC–−70ºC for all analytes.
Accelerated stability studies were performed for establishing the shelf life claim of 28
months from the date of manufacture when stored at −20ºC–−70ºC. Real time studies
are ongoing, and support 10 months stability at this writing.
