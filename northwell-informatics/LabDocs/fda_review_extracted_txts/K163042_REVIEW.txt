H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
chromID® Strepto B agar is a selective chromogenic medium that is intended to aid in the
qualitative determination of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonization in pregnant
women. This medium supports the growth of, but does not differentiate between,
hemolytic and non-hemolytic GBS strains. The test is performed on 18-24 hour LIM
broth enrichments of vaginal/rectal swabs obtained from pregnant women. chromID®
Strepto B agar results can be interpreted after 24 hours incubation with confirmation of
characteristic GBS colonies from the media.
chromID® Strepto B agar is not intended to diagnose infection nor to guide or monitor
treatment for infections. chromID® Strepto B agar does not provide susceptibility results.
Subculture to non-selective media should be performed as needed for susceptibility
testing. chromID® Strepto B agar is intended for use by laboratory health practitioners in
a clinical laboratory.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as the Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Presumptive GBS colonies (pale pink to red colonies) should be confirmed by a
biochemical or laboratory test.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
chromID Strepto B agar is a selective chromogenic medium used for the screening of
Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae) carriage in pregnant women from LIM broth
enrichments of vaginal/rectal swabs. The medium contains antibiotics and synthetic
substrates that enable the screening of S. agalactiae by the appearance of pale pink to red
colonies. Growth of microorganisms belonging to other species is either inhibited, or if there
is growth, the colonies appear as different colored colonies.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
L. Test Principle:
chromID Strepto B agar is a selective, differential medium for the detection of GBS. The
ability to detect GBS is based on the presence of an antibiotic mixture that selectively
suppresses growth of organisms other than GBS, and the presence of chromogenic substrates
that allow the identification of presumptive GBS colonies. Vaginal/rectal swabs from
antepartum women are enriched in LIM broth and inoculated directly onto chromID Strepto
B agar plates and incubated aerobically at 35°-37°C for 24 hrs. The cultures are examined
after 24 hrs incubation for the presence of light pink to red colonies, which are then
confirmed by biochemical methods. No growth or colonies presenting as other than pale pink
to red in appearance should be interpreted as a negative result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated at three sites using a blinded panel of eleven well-
characterized strains, which included 10 S. agalactiae strains and one Staphylococcus
aureus strain. Both hemolytic and non-hemolytic strains of GBS were tested. At each
site, panel members were tested in triplicate at 1.5 x103 CFU/ml with three different
lots of chromID Strepto B agar each day for five days. chromID Strepto B agar plates
were observed for the growth of pale pink to red colonies at 24 hrs. All strains
produced the expected results with the chromID Strepto B agar at 24 hrs (990/990).
Isolates were also plated onto Tryptic Soy Agar with 5% sheep blood to ensure
viability and purity of cultures.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality control (QC) testing was performed at each testing site for growth/color
development on chromID Strepto B agar. Two quality control organisms
(Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 12386 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538)
were tested at each study site on chromID Strepto B agar for each day of testing. The
strains were also subcultured to Trypticase Soy Agar with 5% sheep blood to ensure
viability of the organisms. The positive control was tested at a level of 1.5 x 103
CFU/ml, while the negative control was tested at a concentration of 1.5 x 106
CFU/ml. QC testing results provided expected reactions across each testing site
(Table 1). The submitted QC data are acceptable.

Recovery Study
A Recovery Study was performed with two GBS strains (ATCC 12386 and ATCC
13813). After preparing six serial dilutions per strain in saline and plating on
chromID Strepto B agar, growth and colony color were evaluated after 18 hrs, 24 hrs,
and 48 hrs of incubation at 35°C-37°C. The minimum concentration of GBS reliably
detected by chromID Strepto B agar at 24 hrs was 103 CFU/ml. At 102 CFU/ml,
growth of non-characteristic colonies (grey) was observed at 18 hrs incubation for
one GBS Strain (ATCC 13813). The use of LIM broth in place of saline did not have
an impact on the LoD.
Analytical Reactivity
A study was conducted to demonstrate the sensitivity of chromID Strepto B agar to
detect various GBS strains at a concentration of 103 CFU/ml. The study included 20
GBS strains (15 hemolytic, 5 non-hemolytic) from bioMérieux stock and other
commercial collection sites as shown in Table 2 below.

An Incubation Study was performed to determine the effect of various incubation
times on the performance of chromID Strepto B agar when tested with ten GBS
strains (hemolytic and non-hemolytic) at 103 CFU/ml concentration. The growth of
characteristic colonies was evaluated every hour from 18-28 hrs and every hour from
44-52 hrs. At the earliest time point (16 hrs), 5 of 10 GBS strains grew as
characteristic colonies. By 24 hrs, 8 of 10 GBS strains were detected. All GBS strains
were detected after 44 hrs.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-Reactivity Study
In order to evaluate the performance of chromID Strepto B agar with microorganisms
potentially encountered in vaginal/rectal swabs, a Cross-Reactivity Study was
completed with 88 strains (gram negative bacteria, gram positive bacteria, and yeast)
at approximately106 CFU/ml. Results showed that 68 organisms from the cross-
reactivity panel did not grow on chromID Strepto B agar at 24 hrs.

Interference Study
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of potentially interfering
substances commonly found in vaginal/rectal swab specimens on the detection of two
GBS strains (hemolytic and non-hemolytic) at approximately 103 CFU/ml. Growth of
GBS with characteristic colors (pale pink to red) was evaluated in the presence of 15
interfering substances and 6 human samples.
Interfering substances were tested at physiologically or biologically relevant
concentrations and mixed with bacterial suspensions. Naproxen sodium (27.5 mg/ml)
or topical product (body powder at 0.125 g/ml) may demonstrate partial inhibition of
growth on GBS with chromID Strepto B agar. Use of compounds containing the
active ingredients below had an inhibitory effect on GBS growth that was unrelated to
chromID Strepto B medium performance: nystatin (104 UI/ml), hydrocortisone (0.625
mg/ml), aluminum hydroxide (2.125 mg/ml)/magnesium hydroxide (2.250 mg/ml),
mesalazine (5 mg/ml), barium sulfate (5 mg/ml), esomeprazole (1 mg/ml),
loperamide (1 mg/ml), sennosides (40 mg/ml), metronidazole (25 mg/ml), lidocaine
(2.5 mg/ml), econazole (7.2 mg/ml), naproxen sodium (27.5 mg/ml), nonoxynol-9
(one condom/50 ml sterile water; used at 1:1 dilution), benzalkonium chloride (1
wipe/100 ml sterile water; used at 1:1 dilution). Benzalkonium chloride had to be
diluted (1/10, 1/100, and 1/1000) before growth was observed on both the control
plates (Tryptic Soy Agar with 5% sheep blood) and chromID Strepto B agar plates.
Despite the reduction in growth, characteristic GBS colonies were recovered on
chromID Strepto B agar plates in the presence all interfering substance panel
members. GBS detection was not significantly affected by vaginal fluid, amniotic
fluid, sperm, whole blood, concentrated buffy coat, or stool.
Mixed Infection Study
A Mixed Infection Study was conducted to demonstrate that high levels of non-target
organism will not suppress growth of GBS. Table 5 below shows a list of non-target
organisms included in the study.

· Streptococcus mitis (ATCC 6249)
· Lactobacillus sakei (0706001)
· Streptococcus anginosus (9501029)
The panel of seven non-target organisms included strains capable of producing
characteristic or non-characteristic colonies after 24 hrs growth on chromID Strepto B
medium. Two GBS strains (one hemolytic and one non-hemolytic) were incubated at
approximately 103 CFU/ml with each non-target organism. At 24 hrs, both GBS
strains were detected in the presence of 108 CFU/ml of non-target strains in the Mixed
Infection Study, except in the presence of Streptococcus Group C (NCTC 8546).
Growth of the two GBS strains in the presence of the Streptococcus Group C strain
(108 CFU/ml) produced purple colonies instead of the expected pale pink to red
colonies. Upon decreasing the concentrations of non-target organisms (103-107
CFU/ml), both GBS strains grew as the characteristic colony color. At 108 CFU/ml,
5/7 non-target organisms gave characteristic colonies when grown on chromID
Strepto B medium; however, at 105 CFU/ml, it was observed that non-target
organisms either did not grow or grew as non-characteristic colonies on chromID
Strepto B agar in the presence of both GBS strains at 24 hrs. For those non-target
strains yielding pink to red colonies on chromID Strepto B agar, colony features were
used to distinguish GBS from the non-target organisms. Results of the study revealed
GBS was still detected on chromID Strepto B agar in the presence of high levels of
non-target organisms.

chromID Strepto B culture medium was evaluated at three clinical sites. A total of
681 enriched LIM broth cultures (18-24 hrs) of vaginal/rectal swab specimens from
pregnant women were included in the performance calculations for chromID Strepto
B agar. Five cultures and 60 isolates were excluded because sample acceptance
criteria were not met or there were protocol deviations. One culture was excluded
because S. agalactiae was not confirmed for one of two characteristic colonies
recovered on chromID Strepto B medium from the same culture sample.
All enriched LIM broth cultures were inoculated onto the following media:
· chromID Strepto B agar
· Columbia blood agar with Colistin and Nalidixic Acid (CNA)
For the Reference Culture Method, turbid LIM broth cultures were subcultured to
CNA plates, and all suspicious colonies were screened to confirm or rule-out the
presence of GBS using established laboratory methods: gram stain, catalase, PYR
testing, and latex agglutination. If LIM broth or CNA plates were negative after 24
hrs incubation, cultures were re-incubated an additional 24 hrs before calling samples
negative by the Reference Culture Method.
After enrichment, an aliquot of culture was taken for inoculation onto chromID
Strepto B agar. Plates were incubated at 35°C-37°C for 24 hrs under aerobic
conditions with minimal light exposure. Pale pink to red colonies detected on
chromID Strepto B agar plates after 24 hrs of incubation were suggestive of GBS. All
colonies growing on chromID Strepto B medium were evaluated for the study and
characterized using one or more of the following laboratory tests: gram stain,
catalase, PYR testing, and latex agglutination. VITEK MS was used to identify all
organisms growing on chromID Strepto B agar plates and GBS colonies by the
Reference Method. Performance (sensitivity and specificity) of chromID Strepto B
medium compared to the Reference Culture Method is presented in Table 6 below.
