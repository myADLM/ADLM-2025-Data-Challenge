4. Special instrument requirements:
VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact Systems using VITEK® 2 Systems 8.01 software
I. Device Description:
The VITEK® 2 AST card utilizes a miniaturized, abbreviated, and automated version of the
doubling dilution technique for determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) on
the VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact Systems.
Each VITEK® 2 AST card has 64 microwells containing dehydrated media with or without
an antimicrobial. A control well that contains only dehydrated culture medium is resident on
all cards, with the remaining wells containing premeasured dried amounts of a specific
antibiotic combined with culture medium. VITEK® 2 AST-GN Tobramycin has 8, 16, and 64
µg/mL concentrations included in the test. The dried media in the card is rehydrated with the
organism suspension during the vacuum filling process and is then sealed. The VITEK® 2
System has two options for preparing the AST card inoculum including an auto-dilution or
manual dilution method. The inoculated, sealed card is automatically loaded into the carousel
of the instrument and incubated (35.5°C) for the duration of the test. In contrast, the VITEK®
2 Compact instrument has a manual inoculation and sealing operation.
Growth of the test organism is optically monitored and measured four times per hour
Page 3 of 13

--- Page 4 ---
throughout the incubation cycle (up to 18 hours for GN cards). Interpretive calls are
calculated by the instrument once a predefined growth threshold is obtained. When the test is
complete, the VITEK® 2 card is automatically ejected from the carousel into a waste
container. A report is generated that contains the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)
value with an interpretation category of susceptible, intermediate, or resistant for each
antimicrobial on the card. The MIC result reporting range for Tobramycin on the VITEK® 2
AST-GN card is ≤ 1 – ≥ 16 µg/mL.

L. Test Principle:
The VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection
using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics within the systems use
visible light to directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 microwells.
Transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth
has begun. Every 15 minutes throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based
on the VITEK® 2 card), light transmittance readings of each well measures organism growth
by the amount of light that is prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of
the incubation period, the MIC values and their associated interpretive category results for
each antimicrobial on the test card are displayed in an automatically generated report.

A reproducibility study for the VITEK® 2 AST-GN card with Tobramycin was
conducted at three clinical sites using ten isolates of Gram-negative bacilli consistent
with the Intended Use. Testing was performed on three separate days and in triplicate
for a total of 270 data points. The isolates tested in the reproducibility study included
Serratia marcescens (three isolates), Escherichia coli (two isolates), Klebsiella
pneumoniae pneumoniae (three isolates), and Citrobacter braakii (two isolates).
Inocula were prepared using both the auto-dilution and manual dilution methods for
testing in the VITEK® 2 System. Inocula were prepared by the manual dilution
method only for use with the VITEK® 2 Compact. The mode MIC value was
determined and the reproducibility was calculated based on MIC values that fell
within +/- one doubling dilution from the mode MIC value. Both intra-site and inter-
site reproducibility for Tobramycin was calculated. There were some off-scale MIC
results; accordingly, reproducibility was calculated for best- and worst-case scenarios
per the AST Special Controls Guidance.
For the VITEK® 2 auto-dilution method, overall reproducibility was 100% and
97.78% for best- and worst-case scenarios, respectively. There were a total of 6 off-
scale MIC results.
For the VITEK® 2 manual dilution method, overall reproducibility was 100% and
95.2% for best- and worst-case scenarios, respectively.
For the VITEK® 2 Compact manual dilution method, overall reproducibility was
100% and 95.9% for best- and worst-case scenarios, respectively. There were a total
of 11 off-scale MIC results.
The combined reproducibility results for all three sites were acceptable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Inoculum Density Control
The DensiCHEKTM Plus was used to standardize the inoculum to a 0.5 MacFarland
standard. The instrument was standardized daily with all results recorded at each site.
Calibration values were within the expected range.
Purity Check
A purity check of all organisms was performed on the dilution tube used to prepare
the VITEK® 2 card inoculum. Only those cultures that were pure were evaluated in
the study.
Growth Failure Rate
Of the 961 clinical isolates that were evaluated (810 Enterobacteriaceae and 147 P.
Page 6 of 13

--- Page 7 ---
aeruginosa), three isolates did not grow in the VITEK® 2 Tobramycin test using the
VITEK® 2 System. Complete test results were available for 957 isolates out of 961
clinical isolates. The growth failure rate was 0.3% and was acceptable.
All 76 challenge organisms grew in the VITEK® 2 GN card with Tobramycin using
both the auto-dilution and manual dilution methods of the VITEK® 2 and Compact
Systems. Therefore, 1033 isolates had VITEK® 2 AST results available.
Quality Control (QC) Testing
Two FDA/CLSI recommended QC organisms were tested throughout the
comparative testing at three study sites. The organisms tested were Escherichia coli
ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. These recommended QC
organisms were tested a minimum of 20 times/site by both the VITEK® 2 AST-GN
card with Tobramycin and with the CLSI broth microdilution reference method.
Both the auto-dilution and the manual dilution methods were within the expected
range >95% of the time. In instances where any organism was out of range for the
reference method, all testing data from that particular day was invalid and repeated.
The following table (Table 1) provides a summary of QC results.

*The lowest dilution of the VITEK® 2 Tobramycin MIC range is ≤1 µg/mL. Obtaining this value was
considered as an indicator that the quality control test results were acceptable.
The expected range for E. coli ATCC 25922 with Tobramycin is 0.25 – 1µg/mL.
Even though the Tobramycin concentrations included in the VITEK® 2 AST-GN card
are 8, 16, and 64 µg/mL, the reporting range is ≤1 – ≥16 µg/mL. Therefore, all results
for E. coli ATCC 25922 were off scale for the VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact
Systems as both VITEK® systems report the lowest end of the scale as ≤1 µg/mL. P.
aeruginosa ATCC 27853 was also tested to verify the performance of the device.
Many results for this QC strain were also off scale (≤1 µg/mL). Overall, performance
of the QC organisms was found to be acceptable.
There was no specific recommendation for any additional QC strains to be tested, but
the sponsor’s internal QC process assures that the devices are produced and
manufactured appropriately. To inform the end-user of this point, the sponsor
included the following footnote to the QC table in the device labeling:
“The VITEK® 2 Gram Negative Tobramycin does not include the full CLSI/FDA-
recommended dilution ranges for QC testing with E. coli ATCC 25922 and P.
aeruginosa ATCC 27853”.
In addition, two Gram-positive organisms and one Gram-negative organism were
tested as supplemental quality control organisms throughout comparative testing at
each study site by the reference method only. This was done to provide further
assurance of the performance of the broth microdilution panels. The organisms tested
were:
· Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212
· Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213
· Klebsiella pneumoniae subspecies pneumoniae ATCC 700603
Performance of these additional QC organisms was evaluated and deemed acceptable.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Results obtained with the bioMérieux VITEK® 2 AST-Gram Negative card with
Tobramycin were compared to results obtained with the CLSI broth microdilution
reference panel. The following concentrations of Tobramycin are contained in the
VITEK® 2 AST-GN test card: 8, 16, and 64 µg/mL (equivalent standard method
concentration by efficacy in µg/mL) and the reporting range is ≤ 1 – ≥ 16 µg/mL (i.e.,
≤ 1, 2, 4, 8, ≥ 16). The reference panel contained two-fold serial dilutions with a
range of ≤ 0.0625 to ≥ 128 µg/mL. The testing conditions for the reference method
consisted of the following:
· Medium – Mueller Hinton broth with appropriate dilutions of antimicrobial
solution added
· Inoculum – Direct colony suspension
· Incubation – 35°C ambient air incubator; 16-20 hours for all organisms
All test inocula used for the evaluation of VITEK® 2 AST-GN Tobramycin and the
reference method were standardized using the DensiCHEKTM Plus instrument. The
cards were inoculated with each test organism by auto-dilution for reading by the
VITEK® 2 System and by manual dilution for reading on the VITEK® 2 System and
Compact instrument. Reference broth microdilution panels were inoculated in
adherence with CLSI document, M07-A9.
The VITEK® 2 Tobramycin susceptibility test was evaluated by three independent
clinical sites located in different geographic regions of the United States. Every
clinical isolate was tested one time by auto-dilution on the VITEK® 2 System and the
reference method using the same initial standardized suspension. The study evaluated
961 clinical isolates and 76 challenge isolates for a combined data set of 1037
isolates. Of the 1037 clinical and challenge isolates that were tested by the VITEK® 2
card with Tobramycin, 1033 isolates yielded AST results. However, 33 of these
isolates were removed from analysis due to inherent forcing rules applied by the
VITEK® 2 software for non-indicated Salmonella and Shigella species. Thus, the
combined performance of the VITEK® 2 Tobramycin test as compared to the
reference method is shown in Table 2 for 1000 isolates (924 Enterobacteriaceae and
76 P. aeruginosa).
The majority of clinical isolates were isolated from fresh clinical specimens (825
isolates, 85.8%) and 136 were stock isolates (14.2%).
A total of 76 challenge organisms (51 Enterobacteriaceae and 26 P. aeruginosa)
were evaluated at one external site. The challenge set was tested with both the auto-
dilution and manual dilution options of the VITEK® 2 System and with the manual
dilution method on the VITEK® 2 Compact System. Overall performance of the
challenge organisms is shown in Table 2.

‡EA – Essential Agreement (+/- 1doubling dilution) Min – Minor discrepancies
CA – Category Agreement Maj – Major discrepancies
EVAL – Evaluable isolates Vmj – Very major discrepancies
R – Resistant isolates
Essential agreement was calculated when the VITEK® 2 System results were within
+/- one doubling dilution of the reference method results. Category agreement was
calculated when the VITEK® 2 System result interpretations agreed exactly with the
reference method result interpretations. Evaluable results were defined as when both
the reference method results and the VITEK® 2 System results were on-scale.
Evaluable results were also defined as when the reference method results were on-
scale and off-scale VITEK® 2 System results clearly did not agree within the accepted
+/- one doubling dilution.
The overall performance using the auto-dilution method of the VITEK® 2 System
demonstrated an essential agreement of 98.4% and an overall category agreement of
96.8%. There were no very major errors, 1 major error (0.1% error rate, 1/864
susceptible organisms), and 31 minor errors (3.1% error rate).
The performance based on combined clinical and challenge data was acceptable.
Evaluable P. aeruginosa Isolates:
P. aeruginosa provided evaluable results for a total of two isolates. Of these two
isolates, only one was within essential agreement (EA) for a percent EA of evaluable
isolates of 50%. Because of the limited data submitted with evaluable MIC data, the
performance of this device with isolates that have MICs near the breakpoints could not
be determined and the following footnote was added in the labeling (Product
Information Manual):
“Due to an insufficient number of on-scale isolates available for comparative
testing, the performance of VITEK® 2 Gram Negative Tobramycin is unknown for
P. aeruginosa isolates with MICs in the range of 4-16 µg/mL. If critical to patient
care, isolates with MICs of 4-16 µg/mL should be retested using another
method”.

Resistant Organisms:
A total of 66 resistant isolates were identified in the combined clinical and challenge
study of Tobramycin for the VITEK® 2 auto-dilution method out of 1000 organisms
(6.6%). However, the following organisms had no resistant isolates available during
comparative testing: Citrobacter koseri, Morganella morganii, and Proteus vulgaris.
This was addressed by adding the following limitation in the package insert:
“The ability of the VITEK® 2 AST card to detect resistance with the following
combination(s) is unknown because resistant strains were not available at the
time of comparative testing:
Tobramycin: Citrobacter koseri, Morganella morganii, and Proteus
vulgaris”
In addition, there was an insufficient number of resistant isolates tested during the
comparative study for the following organisms: Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter
cloacae, and Proteus mirabilis. This was addressed by adding the following limitation
in the package insert:
“The ability of the VITEK® 2 AST card to detect resistance with the following
combination(s) is unknown because an insufficient number of resistant strains
were available at the time of comparative testing:
Tobramycin: Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus
mirabilis”
Challenge Data – Auto and Manual Dilution:
The challenge set of 76 isolates (51 Enterobacteriaceae and 25 Pseudomonas
aeruginosa) was evaluated on the VITEK® 2 System and the VITEK® 2 Compact

MIC Trends:
Using the combined clinical and challenge data for Enterobacteriaceae, an analysis of
trending was conducted. This trending calculation takes into account MIC values that
are determined to be ≤ 1 or ≥ 1 doubling dilution compared to the reference method
irrespective whether the device MIC values are on-scale or not. The data for 122
results constitute the evaluable data for trend analysis which is presented in Table 4.

A lower MIC reading trend was observed in the overall performance of
Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa compared to CLSI broth
microdilution, which raises concerns for potential very major errors.
To address the low trending and the potential occurrence of very major error(s) for
Tobramycin when testing clinical and challenge Enterobacteriaceae and P.
aeruginosa isolates with the VITEK® 2 System, the following statement was added as
a footnote in the labeling (Product Information Manual):
“VITEK® 2 Tobramycin MIC values for evaluable Enterobacteriaceae and P.
aeruginosa isolates tended to be one or more doubling dilutions lower compared
to reference broth micro-dilution”.
