L. Test Principle:
The Simplexa C. difficile Direct assay system is a real-time PCR system that enables the
direct amplification and detection of toxigenic C. difficile DNA from unprocessed liquid or
unformed stool specimens that have not undergone nucleic acid extraction. In the Simplexa
C. difficile Direct assay, bi-functional fluorescent probe primers are used together with
corresponding reverse primers to amplify C. difficile and DNA internal control targets. The
assay targets a sequence which is in a well conserved region of C. difficile toxin B gene
(tcdB). A DNA internal control is used to detect PCR failure and/or inhibition.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility
Reproducibility testing for the Simplexa C. difficile Direct was performed at three
sites with a coded and randomized sample panel that included a positive control, a
negative control (TE-stool matrix without analyte) and four contrived samples spiked
into a negative stool - TE buffer matrix. As shown in Table 1, the four contrived
positive samples consisted of a low positive (LP) and a medium positive (MP) for
each of two strains of toxigenic C. difficile (ATCC 43255 and NAP1A). Each
contrived sample was prepared by spiking a specific organism concentration into
negative stool - TE matrix. Both positive and negative controls were also tested
during this study.
Table 1. Reproducibility Sample Panel
Sample Panel Member Strain at Spiked Concentration
ATCC 43255 – LP ATCC 43255 at 0.95 CFU/mL (1 X LoD)
ATCC 43255 – MP ATCC 43255 at 3.8 CFU/mL (4 X LoD)
NAP1A – LP NAP1A at 0.43 CFU/mL (1 X LoD)
NAP1A – MP NAP1A at 1.7 CFU/mL (4 X LoD)
Negative None
Positive Control n/a
Each sample panel member was coded, randomized, and tested in triplicate per run
for two runs per day for a total of five non-consecutive days per site. Two runs per
day were performed by each operator. Therefore, a total of 90 replicates (three
replicates x two runs x five days x three sites) were tested for each sample panel
member. Two Integrated Cycler instruments were used at each site for a total of six
instruments overall.
One negative control replicate and one NAP1A sample replicate produced invalid
results with the test device due to insufficient specimen volume upon initial testing.
Both samples were retested according to the labelled instructions for use, and both
samples produced the expected result upon retest.
Test results were acceptable and did not vary between sites, operators, days, runs, or
instruments. Combined results for all sites are presented in the Table 2.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls:
The Simplexa C. difficile Positive Control Pack consists of inactivated C. difficile,
and is intended to be used as an external control for the Simplexa C. difficile Direct
kit. The positive control pack is provided separately. Focus recommends testing
external controls once per day.
Sample Prep Buffer should be used as a No Template Control (NTC). A NTC should
be tested for every control run in which a positive control is tested.
A DNA internal control (DNA IC) template with a specific fluorescent primers/probe
set is included in each reaction mix and is used to detect PCR failure and/or
inhibition. Failure of the DNA IC will cause the software to report an invalid result
when toxigenic C. difficile DNA has not been detected in the sample. In case of an
invalid result, the sample should be re-prepared and the assay repeated. A new
Sample Prep Swab and Sample Prep Buffer should be used.
Expected control results are listed in Table 3. If the controls are not within these
parameters, patient results should be considered invalid and the assay repeated.

Detection of the Simplexa DNA IC is not required for a valid result when toxigenic C. difficile DNA
is detected.
Positive Controls and No Template Controls were tested daily at each site during the
prospective clinical study. A total of 458 Positive controls and 459 No Template
Controls were tested across all sites and produced valid expected initial results for
456 (99.6%) Positive Controls and 451 (98.3%) No Template Controls. After QC
retesting, 100% of the unexpected QC results resolved to the expected result.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical sensitivity/ Limit of detection
The Limit of Detection (LoD) for the Simplexa C. difficile Direct was determined
using a panel consisting of negative stool-TE matrix spiked with two strains of
toxigenic C. difficile (ATCC 43255 and NAP1A). The bacterial stocks were serially
diluted, and a total of 32 replicates were tested at each dilution. The lowest
concentration of C. difficile where at least 95% of the replicates were detected was
determined to be the LoD for each strain. The results are shown in Table 4 below.
Table 4. Simplexa C. difficile Direct LoD
Toxigenic C. difficile Strain LoD Concentration (CFU/mL)
ATCC 43255 0.95
NAP1A 0.43
Analytical reactivity
The Simplexa C. difficile Direct assay was evaluated for analytical reactivity to 32
strains of toxigenic C. difficile from a variety of toxinotypes.
Analytical reactivity samples were prepared by spiking regrown and retitered strains
into negative stool-TE matrix at 4X LoD of the ATCC 43255 strain (approximately 4
CFU/mL). Each sample was tested in triplicate. If at least one of three replicates
produced a negative assay result, higher concentrations were tested until all three
replicates were detected. Of the 32 tested strains, 22 strains were detected at 4
CFU/mL, eight strains were detected at 8 – 32 CFU/mL, and two strains were

testing 127 organisms that are closely related to C. difficile, or that cause similar
clinical symptoms, or that are present as normal flora in the specimen type of interest.
Samples were prepared by spiking each of the 127 organisms at clinically relevant
concentrations into TE-stool matrix. Clinically relevant concentrations were defined
as ≥106 CFU/mL for bacteria and fungi and ≥105 TCID /mL (PFU/mL) for viruses,
50
or other industry accepted units. Each sample was tested in triplicate. If at least one of
the three replicates was detected as positive with the assay, an additional five
replicates of the same cross reactant was tested. The organisms are listed in Table 6.
Cross reactivity was not observed. One replicate of Clostridium noyii produced a
positive result; however, testing with an additional five replicates produced negative
results.
Campylobacter jejuni was tested during validation. However, it is unknown if
subspecies jejuni was tested. In silico NCBI BLAST analysis was performed for C.
jejuni subsp jejuni did not predict cross reactivity with the Simplexa C. difficile Direct
kit.
The organisms Clostridium botulinum, Desulfovibrio piger, and Ruminococcus
bromii were not available for wet testing. These organisms were evaluated for
potential cross reactivity with the assay primers and probes by in silico NCBI BLAST
analysis of genomic DNA sequences. The in silico analysis did not predict cross
reactivity with the Simplexa C. difficile Direct kit for these species.

Microbial interference:
The same 127 potentially interfering organisms that were tested for cross reactivity
were also evaluated for potential interference with the detection of toxigenic C.
difficile DNA. Two strains of toxigenic C. difficile (ATCC 42355 and NAP1A) were
tested at two to four times LoD in triplicate in the presence of potentially interfering
organisms. If at least one replicate was not detected, an additional five replicates were
tested.
The Simplexa C. difficile Direct kit successfully detected toxigenic C. difficile DNA
in the presence of these organisms at the concentrations tested. Strain NAP1A was
detected in seven out of eight replicates of Clostridium septicum and Clostridium
sordellii, and six out of eight replicates of Abiotrophia defective. All replicates of
both strains NAP1A and ATCC 43255 were detected successfully in the presence of
all other organisms tested.
Interference:
A study was conducted to evaluate the effects of exogenous and endogenous
substances that could potentially interfere with assay performance. A total of 33
potentially interfering substances were co-spiked into TE-stool matrix with toxigenic
C. difficile strains ATCC 43255 or NAP1A spiked at two to four times the LoD.
Endogenous interferents were spiked at the highest possible endogenous level, and
exogenous interferents were spiked at approximately 10% of the recommended dose.
The samples were tested in triplicate. If at least one replicate showed evidence of
interference, an additional five replicates were tested. For substances that showed
evidence of interference, successively lower concentrations were tested to determine
the minimally interfering level. The results are summarized in Table 7 below.
Four substances produced evidence of interference at the highest concentrations
tested. Colace tested at 10% w/v and 5% w/v produced invalid results in all replicates.
When the Colace concentration was reduced to 2.5% w/v, five out of eight (62.5%)
replicates of C. difficile strain ATCC 42355 and seven out of eight (87.5%) replicates
of C. difficile strain NAP1A were detected successfully. The remaining replicates
were not detected.
Naproxen tested at 14 mg/mL produced false negative results in four out of five
replicates of strains ATCC 42355 and NAP1A. All replicates of both strains were
detected when the naproxen concentration was reduced to seven mg/mL.

All replicates of the ATCC 42355 strain were detected at a Dulcolax concentration of
10% w/v. However, Dulcolax at 10% w/v, 5% w/v, 2.5% w/v, and 1.25% w/v
produced invalid results for all replicates of strain NAP1A. Dulcolax at 0.625% w/v
produced invalid results in four out of eight replicates and a Not Detected result in
one replicate of strain NAP1. All replicates of strain NAP1 were detected when
Dulcolax concentration was reduced to 0.3125% w/v.
All replicates of the ATCC 42355 strain were detected in the presence of 0.2 mg/mL
Milk of Magnesia. Five out of eight replicates of strain NAP1were detected at this
concentration of Milk of Magnesia.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The clinical performance of the Simplexa C. difficile Direct test was established in a
prospective multi-site investigation. Two thousand three hundred and fifty one (2351)
samples were prospectively collected from five geographically diverse sites between
December 3, 2015 and June 10, 2016 from patients with signs and symptoms of C.
difficile infection. Each site enrolled fresh unformed stool specimens that were left
over from routine clinical C. difficile infection diagnostic testing. Two thousand three
hundred and thirty (2330) were evaluable on the Simplexa C. difficile Direct and the
Direct Culture method. Two thousand three hundred and thirty six (2336) were
evaluable on the Simplexa C. difficile Direct and the Combined Direct and Enriched
Culture methods.
Of the 2336 samples, 1233 (52.8%) were collected from females and 1103 (47.2%)
were collected from males. The age distribution of the subjects is shown in Table 8.

The initial invalid rate of the clinical prospective study using Simplexa™ C. difficile
Direct was 0.64% (15/2351 samples). After repeat testing, 3/15 samples remained
invalid, thus resulting in a final invalid rate of 0.13% (3/2351 samples).
