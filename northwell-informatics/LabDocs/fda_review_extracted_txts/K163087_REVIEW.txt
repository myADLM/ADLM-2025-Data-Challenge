The iXensor PixoTest Blood Glucose Monitoring system is comprised of a test strip with an
integrated lancing device, that is attached to a clip (the uni-clip accessory) that holds the
cartridge over the camera of a mobile device (iPhone 5, 5S, 6, or 6S). Blood glucose is
measured using the hardware camera on the iPhone 5, 5S, 6, or 6S in conjunction with the
PixoTest Glucose Test Strip with Integrated Lancet Cartridge and PixoTest Uni-Clip. A
plastic clip holds the test cartridge over the camera lens. A drop of fresh capillary blood is
added to the test strip where a line forms in response to glucose in the blood on the test strip.
A photograph is taken of the color change on the test strip and an iOS application uses the
properties of the line to generate a blood glucose concentration. The PixoTest Control
Solutions and PixoTest Standard Card are used to verify that the camera on the phone is
operating properly.

L. Test Principle:
iXensor PixoTest BGMS is a device that utilizes smartphone technology in conjunction with
reflectance photometry and glucose-oxidase chemical reaction testing principles to measure
the glucose level in human blood. A small drop of blood is applied to the eyelet on top of the
disposable PixoTest Glucose test strip with integrated lancet cartridge. The blood sample is
then transferred to and absorbed by the test strip’s glucose-oxidase impregnated reagent pad,
which reacts with the glucose to produce a color change. The intensity of the color change is
proportional to the glucose concentration present in the blood sample as detected by the
camera on the mobile phone by using a clip that holds the test cartridge in place for analysis.
The results are displayed on a phone application that is proprietary to the iXensor products.
After 8 seconds, the blood glucose measurement result is displayed on the smartphone
screen.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The testing described below was performed on an iPhone 5S and iPhone 6S as representative

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study for the PixoTest BGMS was performed using 3 compatible iPhone
5S and 3 iPhone 6s smartphones and 3 lots of PixoTest Glucose test strip cartridges (3
smartphones tested for each lot). Venous whole blood samples were prepared at 11
levels of glucose concentrations ranging from low to high level (20, 40, 60, 90, 132,
178, 224, 316, 362, 408, 500, 550 mg/dL). Test procedures were performed in 7
replicates per lot per concentration level. The results were compared to a comparator
method, the YSI 2300 laboratory analyzer.

The results of the study support the claimed glucose measurement range of 40 to 500
mg/dL. If a sample result is less than 40 mg/dL the result is flagged by the meter as
“LO” and if a sample result exceeds 500 mg/dL the result is flagged by the meter as
“HI”. The ‘HI/LO’ error message feature was validated to demonstrate that the
feature functions as intended.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The iXensor PixoTest Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to
the NIST SRM 917b glucose reference material.
Test Strip Stability:
Test strip stability has been evaluated through accelerated and real-time studies. The
real-time studies are on going. The testing protocols and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found to be acceptable to support the claimed shelf life stability of 24
months when stored between 50 and 104 °F and 10 – 90% relative humidity.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study in Section M1b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
The interference study for PixoTest BGMS was performed using venous blood
samples with 3 glucose concentration levels (60, 20, and 250 mg/dL) and 30 potential
interfering substances. Ten compatible smartphones (iPhone 5S) and 3 lots of
PixoTest Glucose test strip cartridges were used to perform 10 replicates per lot and
the results were compared to a comparator method, the YSI 2300 Analyzer. Testing
was repeated with the iPhone 6S. The results were consistent across the two devices.

There is no calibration required by the user for the PixoTest Blood Glucose monitoring
system. The meter is automatically coded when the test strip is inserted into the meter.
6. Quality Control:
Two levels of controls are available for use with this meter. The control solutions are sold
separately. The control solution range for each control level is printed on the test strip
vial label. It is recommended that users check the accuracy of the meter by using the
control solutions.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) (radiated emissions and immunity) testing:
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing
(EMC) had been performed and the device system was found compliant.
2. Infection Control and Robustness Studies:
The device is intended for a single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed on the external materials comprising the iPhone 5S, 6S and the Uni-Clip by an
outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B
virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes
by Clorox Professional Products (EPA Registration Number 67619-12). Robustness
studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in
performance or external materials of the Uni-Clip or iPhones 5S and 6S after 7665
cleaning and 7665 disinfection steps. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 7
cleaning and disinfection procedures per day over the device system’s three-year use life.
Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and
disinfection procedures.
3. Hematocrit:
The hematocrit effect study for PixoTest BGMS was performed using venous blood
samples: 5 hematocrit levels (20, 30, 42, 55, and 60%) with 3 glucose concentration
levels (30-50, 110-120, and 395-405 mg/dL). Six PixoTest BGMS compatible
smartphones (3 iPhone 5S and 3 iPhone 6S) and 3 lots of PixoTest Glucose test strip
cartridgs were used. Test procedures were performed in 30 replicates per sample (10 per
lot). The results were compared against the comparator method, the YSI 2300 Analyzer,
and support the claimed hematocrit range of 20-60%.
4. Altitude:
The operated altitude effect study for PixoTest BGMS evaluated performance under
environment factors of 4 different altitudes: 3, 3281, 6562, and 9843 feet above sea level
(10, 1000, 2000 and 3000 meters) for both the iPhone 5S and iPhone 6S. Venous blood
samples with 3 glucose concentration levels (40-50 mg/dL, 96-144 mg/dL and 280-420
13

--- Page 14 ---
mg/dL) were tested using 5 PixoTest BGMS compatible smartphones and 3 lots of
PixoTest Glucose test strip cartridgs. Test procedures were performed in 5 replicates per
smartphone. The results were compared against reference method YSI 2300 Analyzer.
The results demonstrate acceptable bias relative to the reference method to support the
claim in the labeling that altitudes up to 9843 feet do not significantly affect device
performance.
5. Temperature and Humidity operating conditions:
The operating temperature and humidity effect study for PixoTest BGMS evaluated
system performance under various environment factors: 10, 25, 35, and 42 °C (50, 77, 95,
107 °F) and 10%, 50%, and 90% relative humidity. Extreme combinations were
evaluated in the procedure using venous blood containing three glucose concentration
levels (51, 119, 353 mg/dL) measured on the PixoTest BGMS with the iPhone 5S and
iPhone 6S, and 3 lots of PixoTest Glucose test strip cartridges. The results were
compared the comparator method, the YSI 2300 Analyzer. The data support the use of
the device in the claimed temperature and humidity range of 50-104°F(10-40°C) and 10-
90% relative humidity.
6. Sample Volume:
The sample volume study for PixoTest BGMS was performed using 3 lots of test strip
cartridges, venous blood samples at 3 glucose concentration levels (60, 100, 220 mg/dL)
with 5 sample volumes ranging from 1.25 to 2.5 μL. An error message, “Blood Volume
Insufficient” (Error 004) is displayed with less than 2 μL of blood is applied to the test
strip. Test procedures were performed in 10 replicates and results were compared to the
comparator method, the YSI 2300 Analyzer. The data support the sample volume claim
of 1.75 μL.
