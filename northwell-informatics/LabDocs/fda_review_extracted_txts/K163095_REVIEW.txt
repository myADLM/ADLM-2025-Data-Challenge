510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number: K163095
B. Purpose for Submission: To obtain a substantial equivalence determination and FDA
clearance for a new device
C. Measurand: Anti-Borrelia burgdorferi (IgG) antibodies
D. Type of Test: Enzyme Immunoassay
E. Applicant: Immco Diagnostics
F. Proprietary and Established Names: Lyme B. burgdorferi (IgG) MarStripe Test
G. Regulatory Information:
1. Regulation section: 21 CFR 866.3830; Treponema pallidum treponemal test reagents
2. Classification: Class II
3. Product code: LSR; Reagent, Borrelia Serological Reagent
4. Panel: Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s): Lyme B. burgdorferi (IgG) MarStripe Test is an immunoblot assay for
the in vitro qualitative detection of human IgG antibody to individual proteins of Borrelia
burgdorferi in human serum or plasma (K -EDTA) in samples which have been found
2
positive or equivocal using an EIA or IFA test procedure to provide supportive evidence
of infection with B. burgdorferi.
2. Indication(s) for use: Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements: N/A
I. Device Description: The kit is an immunoblot method to detect IgG antibodies against B.
burgdorferi antigens. The nitrocellulose test strips are coated with purified recombinant B.
burgdorferi antigens (10) and quality control lines (3) in specific positions. To perform the
test, serum or plasma is incubated with individual B. burgdorferi Test Strips. In positive sera
antibodies specifically bind to one or more of the test lines on the strip. The strips are washed
according to the protocol, and then the pre-diluted, ready-to-use Conjugate is added to the
1

--- Page 2 ---
test strips. After incubation and wash steps, the ready-to-use Substrate is added to the strips.
During a 10 minute (±4 min) incubation, conjugate and substrate binding produces visible
blue/purple lines for Serum Addition Control (SAC), Conjugate Addition Control (CAC) and
Cut-Off Control lines. If the sample is positive for any of the antigen coated test lines, it will
show a reaction more intense than the Cut-Off line. Reactions are read visually and reported.

Diagnosis of Lyme Disease. The results are summarized below.

The 29 discrepant specimens from the above study were tested on two additional
commercially available B. burgdorferi IgG Western blot methods. Results of the
Lyme B. burgdorferi (IgG) MarStripe Test were compared to the consensus (2/3
comparator) results. The 12 positives by MarStripe remained positive by consensus
testing and the 17 negatives by MarStripe were found to be positives.

b. Matrix comparison: To establish equivalence of serum vs. plasma (K -EDTA) matrix,
2
10 pairs of sera/plasma (samples A-J below) were sourced from specimens tested
with an FDA cleared Lyme EIA assay. Two of these were Western blot IgG positive,
8 were negative. These specimens were selectively pooled to create another set of 10
samples (samples 1-10 below), including 3 Western blot IgG positives and 7
negatives. These samples were assayed on the Lyme B. burgdorferi (IgG) MarStripe
Test. Qualitative agreement for all pairs was 100%.
