2. Indication(s) for use:
The CEDIA® Buprenorphine II Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay for
the qualitative and/or semiquantitative determination for the presence of
buprenorphine and its metabolites in human urine at a cut-off concentration of 10
ng/mL. The assay is intended to be used in laboratories and provides a simple and
rapid analytical screening procedure to detect buprenorphine in human urine. The
assay is designed for use with a number of clinical chemistry analyzers.
The semi-quantitative mode is for the purpose of enabling laboratories to determine
an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method
such as LC-MS/MS or permitting laboratories to establish quality control
procedures.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result.
Gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid chromatography/ mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.
Clinical and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result,
particularly when preliminary results are used. For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only.
CEDIA® Buprenorphine II Calibrators:
The CEDIA® Buprenorphine II calibrators and CEDIA Negative Calibrator II are
intended for the calibration of the CEDIA® Buprenorphine II Assay in human urine.
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only.
CEDIA® Buprenorphine II Control Set:
The CEDIA® Buprenorphine II controls are used to validate the CEDIA®
Buprenorphine II Assay calibration in human urine. For In Vitro Diagnostic Use
Only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The CEDIA Buprenorphine II Assay is intended for use on automated clinical
analyzers capable of maintaining a constant temperature, pipetting, mixing reagents,
measuring enzymatic rates at 570 nm and timing the reaction accurately can be used
to perform this immunoassay. All performance data was collected on a Beckman
Coulter AU680 analyzer.
I. Device Description:
CEDIA® Buprenorphine II Assay is supplied as two liquid and two lyophilized reagent

kit homogeneous enzyme immunoassay:
1 EA Reconstitution Buffer
Contains buffer salts, mouse monoclonal anti-buprenorphine derivative antibody
0.8 - 1.0 mg/L, stabilizer, and preservative.
1a EA Reagent
Contains 0.171 g/L Enzyme Acceptor, buffer salts and preservative.
2 ED Reconstitution Buffer
Contains buffer salts, stabilizers, and preservatives
2a ED Reagent
Contains 0.175 mg/L Enzyme Donor conjugated to buprenorphine derivative, 1.67
g/L chlorophenol red-β-D-galactopyranoside, stabilizers, detergent and preservative.
The assay uses specific antibodies that can detect buprenorphine and its metabolites
without significant cross-reactivity to other opiate compounds. In the assay, analyte in
the sample competes with analyte conjugated to one inactive fragment of β-
galactosidase for antibody binding site. If analyte is present in the sample, it binds to
antibody, leaving the inactive enzyme fragments free to form active enzymes. If analyte
is not present in the sample, antibody binds to analyte conjugated on the inactive
fragment, inhibiting the reassociation of inactive β-galactosidase fragments, and no
active enzyme is formed. The amount of active enzyme formed, and resultant
absorbance change, is directly proportional to the amount of analyte present in the
sample.

L. Test Principle:
CEDIA® technology uses recombinant DNA technology to produce a unique
homogeneous enzyme immunoassay system. The assay is based on the bacterial
enzyme β-galactosidase, which has been genetically engineered into two inactive
fragments. These fragments spontaneously re-associate to form fully active enzymes
that, in the assay format, cleave a substrate. This generates a color change that can
be measured spectrophotometrically.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated using CLSI Guideline EP05-A3 as a guideline, at one
site with one analyzer, two operators, and two lots of reagents, calibrators and
controls. Testing was carried out for 20 days with two runs per day, at least two
hours apart and two replicates per run in both Qualitative and Semi-quantitative
modes, giving a total of 80 determinants (n = 80). Drug-free negative urine was
spiked with buprenorphine analyte to final concentrations of -100%, -75%,

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor performed a spike recovery study using two lots each of reagent,
calibrators and controls and analyzed concentrations of 7.5, 10, and 12.5 ng/mL.
Samples were analyzed in semi-quantitative mode in replicates of 5. Recoveries
ranged from 96.6% - 105.3%.
The sponsor also performed a linearity study using two lots each of reagent,
calibrators and controls and analyzed concentrations of 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 ng/mL. Samples were analyzed in semi-quantitative
mode in replicates of 5. Recoveries ranged from a low of 98.3% to a high of
119.8%. Recovery at the claimed cutoff of 10 ng/mL was 109.7%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The primary calibrators and controls are treaceable to a
commercially available Buprenorphine drug stock with a starting concentration
of 1 mg/mL.
Value Assignment: The nominal values for calibrators are 0, 10, 20, 50 and 100
ng/mL, and 7.5 and 12.5 ng/mL for controls. All values are verified by LC-
MS/MS.
The sponsor’s protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
Stability: Real time and accelerated stability studies for both controls and
calibrators were conducted. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
found to be acceptable. The results support the manufacturer’s stability claims of
60 days for an opened vial and 18 months for an unopened vial for both
calibrators and controls. Real time studies are ongoing.

Specific gravity and pH
Interference from specific gravity and pH was evaluated by adjusting the specific
gravity and pH of samples with near cutoff negative (7.5 ng/mL) and near cutoff
positive (12.5 ng/mL) concentrations of buprenorphine. The following specific
gravity or pH levels did not cause any positive or negative interference:
Specific gravity of 1.002, 1.004, 1.008, 1.013, 1.016, 1.018, 1.022, 1.023, 1.025,
and 1.030.
