L. Test Principle:
Mitochondrial antigen mixture composing of recombinant the E2 subunit of the branched-
chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCOADC-E2), the E2 component of pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2) and the E2 subunit of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
complex (OGDC-E2) is bound to the wells of a polystyrene microwell plate followed by
blocking of the unreacted sites to reduce non-specific binding. Controls, calibrators and
diluted patient sera are added to separate wells, allowing any anti-mitochondria antibodies
present to bind to the immobilized antigen. Unbound sample is washed away and an enzyme
labeled anti-human IgG conjugate is added to each well. These enzyme conjugated
antibodies bind specifically to the human immunoglobulin of the appropriate class. After
washing away any unbound conjugate, specific enzyme substrate (TMB) is then added to the
wells. After stopping the enzymatic reaction, the intensity of color change, which is
proportional to the concentration of antibody, is read by a spectrophotometer at 450 nm.
Results are expressed in ELISA units per milliliter (EU/mL).
Semi-quantitative results are determined from a series of five calibrators (160 EU/mL, 80
EU/mL, 40 EU/mL, 20 EU/mL, and 1 EU/mL). Values less than 20 EU/mL are considered
negative results while values greater than 25 EU/mL are considered positive; results between
20 EU/mL and 25 EU/mL are considered ‘indeterminate/borderline’. The sponsor states the
following recommendations in the Package Insert: “Indeterminate/borderline results should
be retested and evaluated along with other laboratory methods”.
Qualitative results are determined using a ratio of the absorbance of the sample to the
absorbance of the cut-off calibrator (20 EU/mL). The ratio is multiplied by the concentration
of the cut-off calibrator to give a numerical value. Values greater than or equal to 20 EU/mL
are considered positive and <20 EU/mL values are considered negative.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Semi-Quantitative Precision:
Precision performance was evaluated in accordance with CLSI guideline EP05-A2
“Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods;
Approved Guideline”. A panel consisting of seven patient sera with levels of AMA
antibodies that cover the analytical measuring range was assayed in duplicate, twice a
day, for 20 days with one reagent lot (a total of 80 replicates per sample). Testing was
performed by two operators using different equipment sets. The first operator
performed the assay with a multi-channel pipettor, microplate washer and microplate
reader. The second operator used different instruments with the same type of
equipment. All %CV values were within the manufacturer’s pre-determined
acceptance limit. The results are summarized in the table below for each assay:

Qualitative Reproducibility:
Studies were performed under the guidance of CLSI EP12-A2 “User Protocol for
Evaluation of Qualitative Test Performance.” Eighty replicates of each patient serum
in the negative range, ~20% below cut-off, at cut-off, ~20% above cut-off and in the
moderate positive range of the assays were performed to determine intra-assay
qualitative reproducibility. Results were calculated using single-point (qualitative)
analysis as indicated in the product insert. All values for qualitative agreement were
within the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance limit. Results are summarized
below.

The linear range was determined to be 3.3–160 EU/mL for the AMA IgG assay and
3.3–160 EU/mL for the AMA IgA/IgG/IgM assay. For test results above 160 EU/mL,
the package insert recommends dilution and retesting of the samples.
High dose hook effect: Four high concentrations specimens were serially diluted to
assess the presence of any artifactual decrease in assay signal associated with AMA
antibody excess (hook effect). No hook effect was demonstrated in sample levels up
to 15,356.8 EU/mL in the AMA IgG assay and 17,915.7 EU/mL in the AMA
IgA/IgG/IgM assay.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i. Traceability:
There are currently no recognized international standards for the measurement of
AMA antibodies. Calibrator and Control values for both assays are directly
traceable to in-house standards.
ii. Value Assignment:
Calibrators and positive controls are dilutions of pooled AMA antibody positive
sera obtained from various commercial plasma centers. The calibrators and
controls are taken from different pooled sera. In order to have traceability with
newly made calibrators, each new lot of calibrators is assayed on an already
cleared kit and compared to the existing calibrators as reference. Each lot of
calibrator is also tested in comparison with normal human sera, clinical samples
and internal standards. Five calibrator levels (Cal A-E) with assigned values from
0–160 EU/mL are included to provide semi-quantitation and must be used with
each run. The cut-off calibrator for the qualitative analysis is derived from Cal D.
Test results greater than or equal to Cal D are considered positive.
For semi-quantitative determinations the positive controls must give values in the
range stated on the vial. The negative control contains negative human serum in
buffer. The negative control must be <10 EU/mL.
iii. Stability:
Shelf-life Stability:
Accelerated and real-time stability studies for each ImmuLisa Enhanced AMA
Antibody ELISAs were conducted on three lots of components/reagents. The
accelerated stability study was conducted with materials incubated at 37°C. Data
from the accelerated stability study support a shelf-life stability of 18 months A
.
real-time stability study is on-going and currently supports an 18-month shelf-life
stability claim.
Open Kit Stability:
For the open kit stability study, materials in each ImmuLisa Enhanced AMA
Antibody ELISA are opened and stored in a dark environment as required for
bench-top usage, then assayed at 15, 45 and 90 day intervals. Data from the open
kit stability study demonstrate that opened reagents are stable at 45 days, but the
sponsor chose a more restrictive one month open kit stability claim.
Sample Stability and Storage:
The package insert recommends that sera be assayed soon after separation or
stored in aliquots at 2–8°C for no longer than one week. For longer storage, serum
specimens should be frozen. Avoid repeated freezing and thawing of samples. It is
recommended that frozen specimens be tested within one year.

d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity was determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2. The
Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying a blank sample in 60 replicates.
The limit of detection (LoD) was determined by assaying six low negative sera in 10
replicates over three days using two reagent lots of each ImmuLisa Enhanced AMA
Antibody ELISAs. The LoB and LoD for the AMA IgG assay was 1.6 and 3.3
EU/mL, respectively. The LoB and LoD for the AMA IgA/IgG/IgM assay was 1.5
and 3.3 EU/mL, respectively.
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Endogenous Interference:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A2 by testing five
serum samples with AMA antibody levels corresponding to the negative range,
near the assay cut-off, and in the low, moderate and high positive range. Each
sample was mixed with known quantities of potentially interfering substances and
analyzed in one assay run with two replicates on one kit lot of each assay. The
recovery was calculated by comparing to control samples spiked with the same
volume of diluents. No significant interference was detected within the
manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria for the following substances up
to the concentrations listed in the table below:
Potential Interfering Compound Test Concentration
Hemoglobin 2 g/L
Bilirubin 342 µmol/L
Triglycerides 37 mmol/L
Rheumatoid Factor 100 EU/mL
Total cholesterol 13 mmol/L
The ‘Limitations of Procedure’ section of the Package Insert states “This test
should not be performed on grossly hemolyzed, microbially contaminated or
lipemic samples”.
ii. Cross-reactivity:
Numerous potentially cross-reactive autoimmune and infectious disease sera were
tested for AMA antibody levels. Refer to test results for 898 serum samples from
patients in the Non-Target Disease Group in the table presented in the section
below on Clinical studies. The number of serum samples tested positive is 12
(0.1%) for AMA IgG and 15 (0.2%) for AMA IgA/IgG/IgM.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-offs for the ImmuLisa Enhanced AMA Antibody ELISAs were
determined by testing specimens from 128 healthy blood donors. Using the 97.5th

percentile value of the results obtained, an arbitrary value of 20 EU/mL was assigned
for the cut-off to establish the following result interpretations:
AMA antibody value Result interpretation
<20 EU/mL Negative
20–25 EU/mL Indeterminate (Borderline)
>25 EU/mL Positive
The cut-off using the 20 EU/mL was validated in a separate study using samples from
healthy blood donors and samples from patients with autoimmune, infectious, and
other conditions expected to be found in the differential diagnosis of PBC; 2.3%
(3/130) and 3.8% (5/130) of the samples from were positive for AMA IgG and AMA
IgA/IgG/IgM, respectively.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
For analysis of agreement with the predicate device, clinically defined serum samples
from the target disease (PBC) and non-target disease group (defined in Section 3.a,
below) were tested with both the predicate and the new device. A total of 434 samples
were tested by the AMA IgG assay; 154 PBC samples and 289 non-target disease
samples were included. A total of 453 samples were tested by the AMA IgA/IgG/IgM
assay; 163 PBC samples and 290 non-target disease samples were included. Only
specimens in the linear range of both the predicate device and the new device were
included in the method comparison. The semi-quantitative results for each assay are
summarized below:
