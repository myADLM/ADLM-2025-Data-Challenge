b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using three (3) test strip lots and 17 mixed pools of venous
blood with glucose concentrations at 15.8, 17.1, 37.3, 58.8, 77.7, 85.6, 98.0, 119.8,
156.3, 225.5, 229.3, 367.8, 438.5, 508.8, 581.5, 651.8, and 723.3 mg/dL, as measured
by the YSI laboratory method.
Each level was measured in replicate with each of three (3) test strip lots and three
meters, per representative smart phone device and the values from the Dario Blood
Glucose Monitoring System were compared with those obtained from the YSI-2300.
Results from the regression analysis are as follows:
Samsung S3 y = 1.004x – 0.5737, r2 =0.9994
Samsung Note 3 y = 1.0045x – 0.3563, r2 =0.9995
LG G2 y = 1.0057x – 0.5021, r2 =0.9996
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of
20-600 mg/dL. The meter displays “LOW” with glucose values below 20 mg/dL, and
“HIGH” with glucose values over 600 mg/dL. The “Lo” and “HI” functions were
validated and were demonstrated to function as intended.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
As established in k150817, the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable
to NIST SRM 917b.
Test Strip Stability:
The Dario blood glucose test strips are identical to the test strips in the predicate
device, Dario Blood GLuocse Monitoring System (k150817). Stability protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed in k150817 and support the sponsors claimed shelf
life of 24 months and an open-vial stability of 1 month at the recommended storage
conditions of 36°F-90°F (2°C-32°C) and 10-90% relative humidity. The instructions
state not to refrigerate open test strip cartridges or put test strips in a freezer.
d. Detection limit:
As established in k150817
e. Analytical specificity:
As established in k150817
Interference studies were performed by spiking venous blood with two levels of
glucose concentrations (65 and 250 mg/dL). Each of these samples was divided into
a test pool and a control pool and each potential endogenous and exogenous
7

--- Page 8 ---
interfering substance was added to the test pool. Each substance was tested at three
concentrations. Each sample was analyzed 10 times with the Dario meter and the %
difference between the individual measurements and the reference (YSI) calculated.

The sponsor has included the following limitations in the labeling:
If you are taking acetaminophen containing drugs (e.g. Tylenol) or Vitamin C
(ascorbic acid) you may get inaccurate results with this system.
If you have a disease or condition in which uric acid levels in your blood may be
elevated (>11 mg/dL), such as gout, you may get inaccurate results with this system.
If you have very high levels of triglyceride (>810 mg/dL), you may get inaccurate
results with this system.
This system should not be used when undergoing xylose absorption tests.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1) Hematocrit Study: As established in k150817, to support the claimed hematocrit range of
20 to 60%.
2) Altitude study: As established in k150817 to support the claims in the labeling that
altitudes up to 10,000 feet (3048 meters) have no significant effect on blood glucose
measurements from the Dario meter.
3) Sample volume study: As established in k150817, to support the claimed minimum
sample volume of 0.3 mL.
4) Temperature and humidity studies: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity
operating condition studies using venous blood samples at five glucose concentrations
(approximately 50, 100, 197, 305, and 488 mg/dL) to evaluate temperatures ranging from
12±2oC to 43±2oC and relative humidity from 15% to 85% for each of the three
representative platforms. Meter results were compared to YSI values. Six temperature
and humidity combinations were tested including low temperature/low humidity, low
temperature/high humidity, average temperature/low humidity, average temperature/high
humidity, high temperature/low humidity, and high temperature/high humidity. The
results support the claims in the labeling that the system can be used in conditions of 50
to 95°F (10 to 45°C) with relative humidity of 15 to 85%.
5) Infection Control Studies: As established in k150817. The device is intended for single-
patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials
comprising the meter, test strip cartridge cap and housing by an outside commercial
testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of live hepatitis B virus with the
chosen disinfectant, Super Sani-Cloth wipes with EPA registration #9480-4. Robustness
studies were also performance by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change
in performance or in the external materials after 156 cleaning and disinfection cycles
(one cycle includes one cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting wipe) to simulate 3 years of
single-patient use. The sponsor provides a disposable sleeve for use with the mobile device
to be used with each test strip. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the
validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
6) The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic (EMC)
testing was performed and the device was found compliant.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
