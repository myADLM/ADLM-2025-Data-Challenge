L. Test Principle:
The test is performed as a solid phase immunoassay. Gliadin antigen is bound to the wells of a
polystyrene microwell plate followed by blocking the unreacted sites to reduce non-specific binding.
Controls, calibrators and patient sera are added to separate wells, allowing any gliadin antibodies present
to bind to the immobilized antigen. Unbound antibodies and other serum proteins are removed by
washing the microplate wells. Bound antibodies are detected by adding an enzyme labeled anti-human
IgA or IgG conjugate to the microplate wells. These enzyme conjugated antibodies bind specifically to
the human immunoglobulin of the appropriate class. After washing away any unbound conjugate,
specific enzyme substrate (TMB) is then added to the wells and the presence of antibodies is detected by
a color change produced by the conversion of TMB substrate to a colored reaction product. After
stopping the enzymatic reaction, the intensity of color change, which is proportional to the concentration
of antibody, is read by a spectrophotometer at 450 nm. Results are expressed in ELISA units per
milliliter (EU/ml) and reported as positive or negative.
Semi-quantitative results are determined from a series of five calibrators (160 EU/mL, 80 EU/mL, 40
EU/mL, 20 EU/mL, and 1 EU/mL). Values less than 20 EU/mL are considered negative results while values
greater than 25 EU/mL are considered positive; results between 20 EU/mL and 25 EU/mL are considered
‘indeterminate/borderline’. The sponsor states the following recommendations in the Package Insert:
“Indeterminate/borderline results should be retested and evaluated along with other laboratory methods,
such as assays for detection of EMA and/or tTG antibodies”.
Qualitative results are determined using a ratio of the absorbance of the sample to the absorbance of the cut-
off calibrator (20 EU/mL). The ratio is multiplied by the concentration of the cut-off calibrator to give a
numerical value. Values greater than or equal to 20 EU/mL are considered positive and <20 EU/mL values
are considered negative.
M. Performance Characteristics:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Semi-Quantitative Precision:
Precision performance was evaluated in accordance with CLSI guideline EP05-A2 “Evaluation
of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline”. A panel
consisting of seven patient sera with levels of gliadin antibodies that cover the analytical
measuring range was assayed in duplicate, twice a day, for 20 days with one reagent lot (a total
of 80 replicates per sample). Testing was performed by two operators using different equipment
sets. The first operator performed the assay with a multi-channel pipettor (BioHit), microplate
washer (ELx405) and microplate reader (ELx808). The second operator used different
instruments from the same type of equipment. All %CV values were within the manufacturer’s
pre-determined acceptance limit. The results are summarized in the table below for each assay:

Qualitative Reproducibility:
Studies were performed under the guidance of CLSI EP12-A2 ‘User Protocol for Evaluation of
Qualitative Test Performance.’ Eighty replicates of each patient serum in the negative range, ~20%
below cut-off, at ~cut-off, ~20% above cut-off and in the moderate positive range of the assays were
performed to determine intra-assay qualitative reproducibility. Results were calculated using single-
point (qualitative) analysis as indicated in the product insert. All values for qualitative agreement
were within the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance limit. Results are summarized below.

The linear range was determined to be 7.5–160 EU/mL for the gliadin IgA assay and 4.6–160
EU/mL for the gliadin IgG assay. For test results above 160 EU/mL, the package insert
recommends dilution and retesting of the samples.
High dose hook effect: Four high concentrations specimens were serially diluted 1:100 to assess
the presence of any artefactual decrease in assay signal associated with gliadin antibody excess
(hook effect). No hook effect was demonstrated in dilution sample levels up to 5515.8 EU/mL of
gliadin IgA and 1686.3 EU/mL of gliadin IgG.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i. Traceability:
There are currently no recognized international standards for the measurement of gliadin
antibodies. Calibrator and Control values are directly traceable to in-house standards.
ii. Value Assignment:
Calibrators and positive controls are dilutions of pooled gliadin antibody positive sera
obtained from various commercial plasma centers. The calibrators and controls are taken
from different pooled sera. In order to have traceability with newly made calibrators, each
new lot of calibrators is assayed on an already cleared kit and compared to the existing
calibrators as reference. Each lot of calibrator is also tested in comparison with normal
human sera, clinical samples and internal standards. Five calibrator levels (Cal A-E) with
assigned values from 0–160 EU/mL are included to provide semi-quantitation and must be
used with each run. The cut-off calibrator for the qualitative analysis is derived from Cal D.
Test results greater than or equal to Cal D are considered positive.
For semi-quantitative determinations the positive controls must give values in the range
stated on the vial. The negative control contains negative human serum in buffer. The
negative control must be <10 EU/mL.
iii. Stability:
Shelf-life Stability:
Accelerated and real-time stability studies for each ImmuLisa™ Enhanced Gliadin Antibody
ELISA were conducted on three lots of components/reagents. The accelerated stability study
was conducted with materials incubated at 37°C. Data from the accelerated stability study set
the shelf-life stability at 18 months A real-time stability study is on-going and currently
.
supports an 18-month shelf-life stability claim.
Open Kit Stability:
For the open kit stability study, materials in each ImmuLisa™ Enhanced Gliadin Antibody
ELISA are opened and stored in a dark environment as required for bench-top usage, then
assayed at 15, 45 and 90 day intervals. Data from the open kit stability study demonstrate that
9

--- Page 10 ---
opened reagents are stable at 45 days, but the sponsor chose a more restrictive one month
open kit stability claim.
Sample Stability and Storage:
The package insert recommends that sera be assayed soon after separation or stored in
aliquots at 2-8°C for no longer than one week. For longer storage, serum specimens should
be frozen. Avoid repeated freezing and thawing of samples. It is recommended that frozen
specimens be tested within one year.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity was determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2. The Limit of
Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying a blank sample in 60 replicates. The limit of detection
(LoD) was determined by assaying six low negative sera in ten replicates over three days using
two reagent lots of each ImmuLisa™ Enhanced Gliadin Antibody ELISA. The Limit of
Quantitation was determined by testing four low level samples in replicates of four over three
days using two reagent lots. The claimed LoB, LoD and LoQ are summarized in the table below:
ImmuLisa™ Gliadin LoB LoD LoQ
Antibody ELISAs (EU/mL) (EU/mL) (EU/mL)
Gliadin IgA 2.2 3.6 7.5
Gliadin IgG 1.6 2.8 4.6
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Endogenous Interference:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A2 by testing five serum
samples with gliadin antibody levels corresponding to the negative range, near the assay
cutoff and in the low, moderate and high positive range. Each sample was mixed with known
quantities of potentially interfering substances and analyzed in one assay run with two
replicates on one kit lot of each assay. The recovery was calculated by comparing to control
samples spiked with the same volume of diluents. No significant interference was
demonstrated in the ImmuLisa™ Enhanced Gliadin Antibody ELISAs with the following
substances up to the concentrations listed in the table below:
Potential Interfering Compound Test Concentration
Hemoglobin 2 g/L
Bilirubin 342 µmol/L
Triglycerides 37 mmol/L

The ‘Limitations of Procedure’ section of the Package Insert states “This test should not be
performed on grossly hemolyzed, microbially contaminated or lipemic samples”.
ii. Cross-reactivity:
Numerous potentially cross-reactive autoimmune and infectious disease sera were tested for
gliadin antibody levels. Refer to test results for 456 serum samples from patients in the Non-
Target Disease Group in the table presented in the section below on Clinical studies. The
number of serum samples tested positive is 12 (2.4%) for gliadin IgA and 21 (4.6%) for
gliadin IgG. The ‘Limitations of Procedure’ section of the Package Insert states: “The results
obtained serve only as an aid in the diagnosis and should not be interpreted as diagnostic in
themselves.”
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-offs for the ImmuLisa™ Enhanced Gliadin Antibody ELISAs were determined by
testing specimens from 126 healthy blood donors. Using the 97.5th percentile value of the results
obtained, an arbitrary value of 20 EU/mL was assigned for the cut-off.
Gliadin antibody value Result interpretation
<20 EU/mL Negative
20–25 EU/mL Indeterminate (Borderline)
>25 EU/mL Positive
Utilizing the 20 EU/mL cut-off value, 4.2% (5/120) and 1.7% (2/120) of the samples from
healthy blood donors and patients in the Non-Target Disease Group were positive for gliadin IgA
and gliadin IgG, respectively
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate devices:
For analysis of agreement with a predicate device, clinically defined serum samples from the
target disease group and non-target disease group were assayed for each gliadin antibody on both
ImmuLisa™ Enhanced Gliadin Antibody ELISA and Anti-Gliadin (AGA) ELISA. The
diagnosed conditions in each group and the numbers of specimens tested for each gliadin
antibody are presented in the table below:

The performance of each ImmuLisa™ Enhanced Gliadin Antibody ELISA was evaluated against
the clinical diagnosis of celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis separately. In both
evaluations, the clinical sensitivity and specificity were calculated by grouping the assay’s
indeterminate results with its test negative results, and then sensitivity and specificity were
calculated again by grouping the assay’s equivocal results with its test positive results.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Test results in a normal population are expected to be negative. However, it has been determined
that some apparently healthy, asymptomatic individuals may test positive for gliadin IgA or gliadin
IgG (Rashtak S. et al. Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2008; 6:426-432).
A total of 269 normal human sera (130 pediatrics and 139 adults) tested with the ImmuLisa™
Enhanced Gliadin Antibody ELISAs yielded 8 (3%) positive results for gliadin IgA (all adults) and
10 (3.7%) positive for gliadin IgG (4 pediatrics and 6 adults).
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
