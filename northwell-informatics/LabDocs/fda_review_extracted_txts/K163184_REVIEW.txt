510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
K163184
B. Purpose for Submission:
This submission is for a modification to the ancillary specimen collection kit used with the
cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test (K132270). The modification consists of changing the endocervical
collection swab from a spun (woven) bud to a flocked bud. The swab used for the collection
of vaginal specimens, as previously cleared as an ancillary collection kit to the above two
assays, remains unchanged. The modified collection kit will be marketed under the name
cobas® PCR Media Dual Swab Sample Kit and the original cobas® PCR Female Swab
Sample Kit will be gradually phased out.
The cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test remains unchanged.
C. Measurand:
Chlamydia trachomatis DNA and Neisseria gonorrhoeae DNA

setting), clinician-collected vaginal swab specimens, and endocervical swab specimens,
all collected in cobas® PCR Media (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.), and cervical
specimens collected in PreservCyt® solution. This test is intended as an aid in the
diagnosis of chlamydial and gonococcal disease in both symptomatic and asymptomatic
individuals.
Ancillary Collection Kits:
The cobas® PCR Media Dual Swab Sample Kit is used to collect and transport
endocervical and vaginal swab specimens. The cobas® PCR Media serves as a nucleic
acid stabilizing transport and storage medium for gynecological specimens. Use this
collection kit only with the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test.
The cobas® PCR Urine Sample Kit is used to collect and transport urine specimens.

1 flocked bud swab (polyester)
· cobas® PCR Media 1 x 4.3 mL
· ≤40% (w/w) Guanidine hydrochloride Tris-HCl buffer
Collection of endocervical specimens:
The flocked swab is used to collect the endocervical specimen. The woven swab is intended
to remove excess mucus from the cervical and surrounding mucosa prior to the collection of
endocervical specimen and is discarded after cleaning.
Collection of vaginal specimens:
The woven swab is used to collect vaginal specimens (the flocked swab is discarded).

The swab sample collection kit, which is the subject of this submission, is designed to
preserve the integrity of the Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae DNA in
gynecological specimens collected from female patients.
Cells in the collected specimens are lysed in the collection device by the chaotropic agent in
the cobas® PCR Media. The guanidine hydrochloride denatures all proteins in the sample,
preventing any enzymatic degradation of the nucleic acid in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The performance characteristics of the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test were established under
K132270; please refer to that file for the associated data.
A risk analysis was performed to evaluate the modification made to the collection kit and its
impact on the performance of the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test. The FMEA identified one
significant risk from the change from a spun swab to a flocked swab. The risk identified was
a risk of a false negative result if the collected swab sample did not contain enough cells due
to the design change from spun to flocked.
Two analytical studies using clinical samples were performed to demonstrate that the flocked
swab was substantially equivalent to the spun swab for the endocervical specimens.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Dilution Sensitivity Study:
This study’s purpose was to demonstrate that clinical samples co-collected with Puritan
woven swab and Puritan flocked swab have similar detection levels in serial dilutions using
clinical matrix. This study was performed using the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 according to the
instructions for use.
Method: Ten pairs of co-collected clinical specimens were selected based on positivity for
CT or NG and Ct values within 1 Ct of each other, based on testing with the cobas® CT/NG
v2.0 assay. See Table 1 below for the obtained specimen Ct values. Two negative
background matrix pools were prepared from previously tested negative specimens. One
negative pool was made for each swab type. Each swab of the ten positive pairs of co-
collected specimens was diluted in the appropriate negative matrix pool. A minimum of
eight dilution levels were made for each specimen and swab type.

*this specimen exhibited one cycle (Ct value) difference suggesting approximately 2 fold
N. gonorrhoeae DNA concentration difference even before dilution series were prepared.
The specimen was included in the study despite being exactly at the borderline of
inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Results: Each dilution was tested with the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 assay in triplicate. The first
dilution where 2 out of 3 replicates were negative was considered the dilution limit. The
limit for each dilution of each swab sample was recorded in Table 2 below. The new flocked
swab performed equally or better than the original woven swab in detecting CT or NG. One
sample, 1006, had disparate dilution limits for each swab type, however the newer swab type
(flocked swab) performed better than the original woven swab. No demonstrated negative
impact was observed when using a flocked swab as compared to a woven swab. Equivalence
was defined as both swabs having a dilution limit within one dilution of each other.

considering that the starting concentration of N.gonorrhoeae DNA was already 2 fold different even
before the dilution series were prepared. More importantly, signal loss was observed at a higher
dilution in the specimen collected with proposed flocked swab device suggesting that this swab had
no negative impact on the results.

b. Method comparison with predicate device:
A swab comparison study was performed to demonstrate that the flocked swab has
equivalent performance to the woven swab when used with the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test in a
clinical environment. One woven and one flocked swab were prospectively collected from
1,949 women who came in to the clinical facility for STI testing. The swab type collected
first was alternated between the two swab types.
The comparison of the two swab types is presented as Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) and
Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) between results obtained with the flocked swab vs. the
woven swab for positive and negative patients. Table 3 (CT) and Table 4 (NG) below show
the results of this study.

PPA: 86.96% (95%CI : 67.87%-95.46%)
NPA: 99.95% (95%CI : 99.71%-99.92%)
All discordant samples were at or near the limit of detection with a Ct value above 35, except
for one Chlamydia trachomatis positive specimen which was positive in the flocked swab
only with a Ct value of 25.
The performance of the two Puritan swabs (woven and flocked) used for collection of
endocervical specimens for testing on the cobas® 4800 platform with CT/NG v2.0 are not
significantly different. A Student’s t-test was performed on the data resulting in a p-value of
0.92 for Chlamydia trachomatis and 0.84 for Neisseria gonorrhoeae demonstrating no
significant difference between the swab types. Although the PPA point estimate for
Chlamydia trachomatis results (94.3%) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (86.96%) were below the
desirable 95% goal, the data provided do not raise concerns with the use of the flocked swab
instead of the woven swab for the collection of endocervical specimens and support a
substantially equivalent decision.
