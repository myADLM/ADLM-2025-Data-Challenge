L. Test Principle:
The reaction in each AnemoCheck test vial is an oxidation-reduction reaction utilizing 3,3’-
5,5 tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). Erythrocyte membranes are disintegrated via high osmotic
pressure when exposed to a chemical solution, releasing the hemoglobin. TMB is then
oxidized in the presence of hemoglobin and hydrogen peroxide within the solution,
exhibiting stable color products that are discernible by visual interpretation.
To determine hemoglobin values from this test, 5 μL of the capillary tube is filled with blood

pre-filled with the TMB chemical solution. After mixing the blood with solution and 2
minutes of development, the reaction with whole blood is complete. The resulting color of
the solution then allows for visual interpretation with the color card for determination of
hemoglobin (g/dL) and estimated hematocrit percentage (%).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted to assess the sources of potential variation for the
AnemoCheck test, namely variance due to site, operator, and lot.
Repeatability
Repeatability studies were conducted at a point-of-care site using three different
AnemoCheck test lots and three operators. Five natural patient samples collected in
sodium citrate tubes with hemoglobin concentrations at the lower and upper limits
and medical decision levels of the analytical measuring range of the AnemoCheck
were tested. Each sample was tested 10 times for a total of 90 tests results for each
hemoglobin concentration. Repeatability results were within the defined acceptance
criteria.

once daily using the same set of controls for 5 days. Each control level was run 10
times by two operators at each site. A total of 300 test results were generated for each
control level at each site. SD and %CV for within-run, between-day, between-
operator, and between-site were calculated for each site and all sites combined.
Results for each site and all sites combined were within the predefined acceptance
criteria.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Two linearity studies were conducted for AnemoCheck. The first linearity study was
conducted using 13 natural patient samples (5.0–17.7 g/dL) correlating to
AnemoCheck color blocks on the test card. Samples were tested in triplicate using
three lots of AnemoCheck tests. Color change in the AnemoCheck test vials were
interpreted visually and recorded. The second linearity study utilized contrived
samples across the reportable range (4.0–18.0 g/dL). Samples were tested in triplicate
using three lots of AnemoCheck tests. Results were interpreted visually and by
spectrophotometry. Linear regression of the visual results was performed and based
on the data analysis, AnemoCheck demonstrated linearity over the claimed measuring
range of 4.0–18.0 g/dL.

Open-vial stability was determined by testing natural patient samples across the
reportable range using three lots AnemoCheck tests. Each sample was tested in
triplicate. Under room temperature conditions (15–30°C), samples were tested
immediately after opening the vial containing the AnemoCheck chemical reagent
solution (t=0) and at 15 minutes. The acceptance criterion for open-vial stability was
met at 15 minutes. The open-vial stability study supports a claim for 10 minutes after
opening when stored at 15–30°C.
Closed-vial stability was determined by testing control material across the reportable
range using three lots AnemoCheck tests. Each sample was tested in triplicate.
Samples were tested immediately after opening the AnemoCheck chemical reagent
solution vial (t=0), 156 days, and 280 days at 15–30°C. The closed-vial stability study
supports a claim for 9 months when stored at 15–30°C.
Transport Stability
Three different AnemoCheck test lots were tested after being exposed to different
transport conditions which included vibration testing for various time frames (8
hours, 1 day and 5 days), extreme temperature (45–50 °C, 60°C and -20°C) and
prolonged humidity (7 days). AnemoCheck tests were from lots that were stored for
260, 262 and 264 days after being manufactured. Patient whole blood samples
spanning medical decision points and a low control (4.0, 10.0, 13–15.0 and 18.0
g/dL) were used to evaluate the AnemoCheck test kits exposed to the different
transport conditions. Acceptance criteria were met for all conditions with the
exception of studies conducted for the test stored at -20°C for 5 days. The labeling
adequately addresses the limitation that AnemoCheck tests should not be stored
frozen.
Value Assignment
Value assignment of control material (Streck High hemoglobin control, K842017)
was conducted with two operators using two lots of control material on two different
days with two different lots of AnemoCheck for a total of 67 test results. The operator
was instructed to fill an AnemoCheck capillary tube halfway with a control sample in
order to obtain 6.0 g/dL Hgb value. AnemoCheck test results were quantified (via
spectrophotometer) to enable direct comparison of hemoglobin values to the expected
hemoglobin control result of 6.0 g/dL. The results confirmed that 6.0 g/dL Hgb value
corresponds to AnemoCheck capillary tube filled halfway.
Quality Controls
Quality control testing is recommended to be performed prior to use. A hemoglobin
test capturing a hemoglobin level of approximately 6.0 g/dL is utilized to ensure the
redox reaction color change can proceed. The user is instructed to fill an
AnemoCheck capillary tube halfway with a control sample (Streck, Inc.High
hemoglobin control, K842017) and test it using an AnemoCheck test vial. After
7

--- Page 8 ---
mixing and development time (2 minutes), the resulting color should correlate to
approximately 6 g/dL on the AnemoCheck color scale.
d. Detection limit:
In order to determine the detection limit (LoD) of the AnemoCheck assay (4.0–18.0
g/dL), four low hemoglobin samples 0.0, 0.2, 0.5 and 1.4 g/dL as verified by the
predicate device were used. Each sample was tested 10 times using one lot of
AnemoCheck test. Testing was completed as an end-user would perform testing per
the instructions for use. The blank 0.0 g/dL did not elicit any visual color change and
all other samples elicited a blue result correlating to the lowest color block in the
reportable range when interpreted between 2–10 minute development time. The limit
of detection (LoD) is 0.2 g/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Studies were conducted where the interfering substance was introduced into a subject,
and then compared against control samples drawn from the same subject. Venous
blood samples containing ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin, Benadryl, bilirubin and
triglycerides with the maximum concentrations listed below were tested in triplicate
using one lot of AnemoCheck.
In order to assess potential interference with blood pH and extremely high bilirubin
and albumin concentrations, studies were conducted by delivering a concentrated
dose of a potentially interfering substance (“spiking”) to healthy venous blood
samples of known volume in order to reach final concentrations. Hemoglobin
concentrations were verified on a reference standard hematology analyzer that
covered the analytical measuring range (4.0, 10, 13.0–15.0, 18.0 g/dL). Samples were
then tested in triplicate using one lot of AnemoCheck. Potential interfering substances
at the concentration in the table below and blood pH values between 6.8 and 8.4 do
not interfere with the AnemoCheck test.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed at three point-of-care clinical sites in the
United States to assess the performance of AnemoCheck compared to the predicate
device (HemoCue Hb 201+ System). A total of 262 patient samples, which included
221 venous samples and 41 capillary samples, were used to assess the AnemoCheck
test. Of the 221 venous samples, 140 samples that were collected in K EDTA tubes,
2
34 samples were collected in citrate tubes and 47 samples were collected in heparin
tubes. Of the capillary samples, 30 samples were collected in K EDTA tubes and 11
2
samples were collected in heparin tubes. In total 170, 34 and 58 patient samples were
collected in K EDTA, citrate tubes and heparin tubes, respectively. Fourteen samples
2
of the 262 patient samples used in this study were contrived. Testing was performed
using three different lots of AnemoCheck (one lot at each site) with five operators
over three sites. The study population consisted of 48.1% males and 51.9% females
including pediatric (i.e. infants, children, and adolescents) and adult subjects up to 92
years of age. In addition to healthy individuals, subjects with the following clinical
conditions were included in the studies: microcytic hypochromic anemia, thalassemia,
sickle cell anemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), aplastic anemia, acute
idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and iron deficiency anemia. Linear
regression analyses demonstrate comparable performance between the AnemoCheck
and HemoCue Hb 201+ System across the analytical measuring range. The method
comparison study demonstrated that the analytical performance of the AnemoCheck
test is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
