L. Test Principle:
AFIAS iFOB is an immunoassay system based on antigen-antibody reaction and
fluorescence technology. When a human fecal sample is mixed with the extraction buffer,
human hemoglobin in fecal occult blood (FOB) is extracted from the fecal sample. When the
extracted sample is loaded into the sample well of the test cartridge, human hemoglobin
binds with mouse monoclonal anti-hemoglobin-fluorescence located at the glaze line. This
complex migrates through the nitrocellulose matrix of the test strip. The fluorochrome-
labeled detector antibody-FOB hemoglobin complexes get captured on to the antibodies
(mouse monoclonal anti-hemoglobin) which have been immobilized at the test line on the
test strip. As a result, the fluorochrome-labeled complexes of the detector antibody and FOB
hemoglobin capture-antibody are accumulated at the test line on the test cartridge membrane.
The more hemoglobin in the human fecal sample, the more complexes that will be
accumulated at the test line on the test cartridge membrane. The test strip also contains rabbit
IgG immobilized at a control line. The control line of AFIAS iFOB test cartridge functions as
the built-in procedural control.
AFIAS-50 is a fluorescence-scanning instrument to be used in conjunction with the AFIAS
iFOB test which are based on antigen-antibody reaction and fluorescence technology
(Fluorescence Immuno-Assay). AFIAS iFOB test cartridges and sample mixed extraction
buffer tubes are inserted into the designated positions on AFIAS-50 for testing. AFIAS-50
uses a semiconductor diode laser as the excitation light source for illuminating the sample-
loaded AFIAS iFOB cartridge(s) inserted in its magazine station(s); thereby triggering
fluorescence from the fluorochrome-labeled complexes of hemoglobin accumulated at the
test line on the cartridge membrane as well as the control line. The fluorescent light is
collected together with the scattered laser light. Pure fluorescence is filtered from the mixture
of the scattered and fluorescent light. Intensity of the fluorescence generated at the ‘test line’
and ‘control line’ is scanned and collected by the optical assembly onto a photo sensor and
converted into an electric signal which correlates to the intensity of fluorescence and hence to
the concentration of occult blood, fecal hemoglobin in the test sample. The on-board
microprocessor computes the occult blood, fecal hemoglobin concentration based on a pre-
programmed calibration derived from the “AFIAS iFOB ID Chip” inserted in the ID chip
port. The computed and converted result is displayed by AFIAS-50 in a qualitative (positive
or negative) manner based on the analytical cut-off value 100 ng/mL or 8.0 μg hemoglobin/g
stool.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
5

--- Page 6 ---
Repeatability was evaluated using a single test kit lot, one intended use site and one
operator. Reproducibility was conducted across three intended use sites using three
test kit lots, three operators, three AFIAS-50 instruments. For reproducibility, one run
per day was performed for three non-consecutive days. i-CHROMA iFOB Negative
and Positive Controls were also tested daily to ensure the validity of the test results.
For repeatability and reproducibility, Hb-free fecal samples were collected and spiked
with human whole blood with known hemoglobin levels to achieve the following
seven fecal hemoglobin concentrations: 4 μg Hb/g stool, 6.8 μg Hb/g stool, 7.6 μg
Hb/g stool, 8.0 μg Hb/g stool, 8.4 μg Hb/g stool, 8.8 μg Hb/g stool, and 80 μg Hb/g
stool, that are equivalent to 50 ng/mL, 85 ng/mL, 95 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 105 ng/mL,
110 ng/mL, and 1000 ng/mL, respectively. Fourteen replicates were performed for
each sample and concentration level. Repeatability and reproducibility results at all
test sites were within the defined acceptance criteria.

Stability Studies
i-CHROMA iFOB Negative and Positive Controls were also tested daily to ensure
and confirm the validity of the test results of the stability studies.
1. Test Kit Stability (Accelerated)
The accelerated stability study was conducted with three lots of AFIAS iFOB test
kit (test cassette and sampling tubes). Test kit stability testing was performed by
preparing 21 aliquots of spiked stool test samples collected in extraction buffer in
AFIAS iFOB test extraction buffer tubes. The Hb-free stool specimens were
spiked with human blood (of known hemoglobin level) to obtain fecal samples
containing nine different hemoglobin concentrations: 25 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL,
85 ng/mL, 90 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 110 ng/mL, 130 ng/mL, 150 ng/mL and
500 ng/mL. One operator tested the three lots stored at 50℃ and test results were
collected at the following time points (in weeks): 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and
28. The test kit was determined to be stable for 20 months at 4–30°C.
2. Stool Samples Collected by Collection Slide Stability
Stability testing for stool samples collected on collection slides was performed by
using one lot of AFIAS iFOB collection slides and spiked Hb-free stool samples
with human blood (of known hemoglobin concentration) to obtain fecal samples
containing nine different hemoglobin concentrations: 25 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL,
85 ng/mL, 90 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 110 ng/mL, 130 ng/mL, 150 ng/mL and
500 ng/mL. Twenty-one aliquots of each of the nine concentrations of spiked
stool test samples were added to the AFIAS iFOB sample collection slide and
analyzed in random order.
To substantiate the 30-day room temperature (25–30℃) claim, each sample was
tested with AFIAS iFOB on day 0 and every 4 days for a total of 36 days from the
start of storage. Stool samples collected on AFIAS iFOB collection slides are
7

--- Page 8 ---
stable up to 30 days when stored at room temperature.
3. Stool Samples Collected by Extraction buffer Tube Stability
Stability testing for stool samples collected in extraction buffer tubes was
performed by using one lot of AFIAS iFOB extraction buffer tubes and spiked
Hb-free stool samples with human blood (of known hemoglobin concentration) to
obtain fecal samples containing nine different hemoglobin concentrations: 25
ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 85 ng/mL, 90 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 110 ng/mL, 130 ng/mL, 150
ng/mL and 500 ng/mL. Twenty-one aliquots of each of the nine concentrations of
spiked stool test samples were collected by the AFIAS iFOB sampling sticks at
day 0 and added to the AFIAS iFOB sample extraction buffer tubes and analyzed
in random order.
To substantiate the 14-day refrigerated claim, each sample was stored at 2–8°C
and tested with AFIAS iFOB on day 0 and every 2 days for a total of 18 days
from the start of storage. AFIAS iFOB extraction buffer tubes must be brought
back to room temperature before testing. Stool samples collected in AFIAS iFOB
extraction buffer tubes are stable up to 14 days when stored at 2–8°C.
4. Stool Samples Collected in Sterile Specimen Collection Cups
Stool samples collected in collection cups stability testing was performed by
using one lot of AFIAS iFOB test kits and spiked Hb-free stool samples with
human blood (of known hemoglobin concentration) to obtain fecal samples
containing nine different hemoglobin concentrations: 50 ng/mL, 75 ng/mL, 90
ng/mL, 110 ng/mL, 125 ng/mL, 150 ng/mL. A total of 384 specimen cups (64
cups x 6 hemoglobin concentrations x 4 storage temperatures) containing the
spiked fecal samples were stored at -20°C, 4°C, 25°C and 37°C immediately after
spiking/preparation. Each test sample was tested with AFIAS iFOB at day 0 and
every other day.
Stool test samples collected in sterile specimen collection cups were stable for 30
days when stored at -20°C and for 2 days when stored at 37°C.
5. Stability of i-CHROMA iFOB Controls
Stability of i-CHROMA iFOB Controls was evaluated by real time stability
testing using 10 aliquots of each of the control levels. One lot of AFIAS iFOB test
kits and three lots of i-CHROMA iFOB Controls (negative and positive) were
evaluated during the shelf-life and open-vial stability studies of the i-CHROMA
iFOB Controls.
The shelf-life stability was evaluated by using separate vials (of each lot) of the
controls for each periodic testing. The open-vial stability was evaluated by using
the same vial of the control for the initial as well as all successive periodic testing.
i-CHROMA iFOB controls from each lot were stored at 2℃, 8℃ and 25℃ and
tested at time points of initial start of 0 and biweekly up to 16 weeks from the
start of the stability study. The results showed that the i-CHROMA iFOB controls
8

--- Page 9 ---
shelf-life stability was three months and the open-vial stability was one month
when stored at 2–8°C.
6. Humidity Effect Stability Study
Humidity stability was conducted with one lot of AFIAS iFOB test kits and
spiked Hb-free stool samples with human blood (of known hemoglobin
concentration) to obtain fecal samples containing seven different hemoglobin
concentrations: 50 ng/mL, 85ng/mL, 95 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 105 ng/mL, 110
ng/mL and 1,000 ng/mL. Fifty AFIAS iFOB test cartridges were stored at a
temperature of 25℃ and the humidity conditions listed in Table 2 below and were
tested at the following intervals (in hours): 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5. The positive percent
for each concentration in each humidity condition was calculated. The test results
showed that there is no humidity effect on AFIAS iFOB test results up to 75 ± 5%

Specificity to Human Hemoglobin Variant
The sensitivity of the AFIAS iFOB test to hemoglobin S (HbS) was determined using
one kit lot and one operator. Spiked stool samples containing five different HbS
concentrations were prepared: 50 ng/mL, 85 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 115 ng/mL and 150
ng/mL. Twenty aliquots of each of the five concentrations of spiked stool samples
were mixed with extraction buffer in AFIAS iFOB extraction buffer tubes. Samples
were tested in a randomized order. Results showed that the AFIAS iFOB is sensitive
to HbS.
Cross-Reactivity
Cross-reactivity of AFIAS iFOB test with non-human hemoglobin was evaluated by
using one kit lot and one operator. Test samples were prepared by spiking Hb-free
stool specimens with known levels of six different human hemoglobin solutions to
obtain fecal samples with the following hemoglobin concentrations: 0 ng/mL, 50
ng/mL, 85 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 115 ng/mL and 150 ng/mL.

Twenty aliquots of the six stool concentrations listed above were spiked with the
intended level of respective non-human hemoglobin: bovine Hb (2,000 μg/mL), pig
Hb (500 μg/mL), fish Hb (100 μg/mL), horse Hb (500 μg/mL), goat Hb (500 μg/mL),
rabbit Hb (500 μg/mL), sheep (500 μg/mL), and chicken Hb (500 μg/mL).
All samples were mixed with extraction buffer in AFIAS iFOB extraction buffer
tubes and tested in a randomized order. There was no significant interference
observed for the non-human hemoglobins listed above.
Interfering Substances
Susceptibility to interference from Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), bilirubin, albumin,
myoglobin, glucose and triglyceride was evaluated using one kit lot and one operator.
Test samples were prepared by spiking stool samples containing six different
hemoglobin concentrations: 0 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 85 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 115 ng/mL
and 150 ng/mL.
Twenty aliquots of the six stool concentrations listed above were spiked with the
intended level of Vitamin C (30 μg/mL), bilirubin (200 μg/mL), albumin (60 mg/mL),
myoglobin (2,000 μg/mL), glucose (120 mg/dL), and triglyceride (500 mg/dL).
All samples were mixed with extraction buffer in AFIAS iFOB extraction buffer
tubes and tested in a randomized order. There was no significant interference
observed for Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), bilirubin, albumin, myoglobin, glucose and
triglyceride.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off value for the AFIAS iFOB test was validated in-house. Fecal test samples
were prepared by spiking stool samples with human blood of known hemoglobin
concentration, to obtain the following fecal hemoglobin concentrations: 50 ng/mL, 85
ng/mL, 90 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 110 ng/mL, 130 ng/mL and 150 ng/mL. Forty aliquots
of each of the seven concentrations of spiked stool test samples were mixed with
extraction buffer in AFIAS iFOB extraction buffer tubes and 40 aliquots of each of
the seven concentrations of spiked stool test samples were mixed with the predicate
(i-CHROMA iFOB) sample collection tubes. Samples were tested in randomized
order. Testing was performed side-by-side with the predicate by comparing the test
results of the device with that of the predicate. The cut-off was determined to be 8.0
μg hemoglobin/g stool or 100 ng/mL (hemoglobin in fecal sample mixed with
detection buffer).

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison of AFIAS iFOB test with the predicate test, i-CHROMA iFOB
test, was conducted by assessing 522 patient samples, 165 of which were positive,
and 357 negative. The method comparison study was performed at one professional
medical laboratory in the U.S. and two international professional medical laboratories
by three different operators (one) at each site. The i-CHROMA iFOB external
controls (positive and negative) were run prior to testing. Statistical analysis of site-
wide test results as well as combined results showed that AFIAS iFOB test results
have acceptable overall percent agreement as well as positive percent agreement and
negative percent agreement with i-CHROMA iFOB test results. The method
comparison study (Table 4) demonstrated that the analytical performance of the
AFIAS iFOB test is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Yes ___x_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Enter patient identification information manually on the label of the collection slide or
extraction buffer tube. Patient identification can also be entered into the AFIAS-50
manually, by barcode reader or the AFIAS-50 will assign specific patient ID as ‘P01’,
‘P02’, and so on.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
To collect human fecal samples for testing, two different sample collection methods are
available. AFIAS iFOB uses specific sampling devices (collection slide and sampling
stick). Using a collection slide (for use by patients), fecal samples are collected with an
applicator stick applied into the windows which are provided inside of the collection
slide. After collecting the fecal sample, the sample strip, which detaches from the back of
the collection slide will be inserted into the extraction buffer tube. The patient submits
the test sample to the hospital/laboratory for testing. The fecal test sample can also be
collected using a sampling stick (intended to be used by professional/reference
laboratories only) which is attached in the bottom cap of the extraction buffer tube. After
collection of the fecal sample, the sampling stick with fecal sample will be inserted into
the extraction buffer tube.
5. Calibration:
The “ID Chip” provided with AFIAS iFOB test cartridge(s) contains a memory device
which contains encoded calibration data. An ID chip having a lot number matching with
that of the test cartridge and the extraction buffer collection tube is inserted into the
designated port of the AFIAS-50 which utilizes the calibration data for computing the test
result(s). The end-user is not required to perform routine calibration before performing
the test.
6. Quality Control:
AFIAS iFOB Cartridge
Internal Control: The Procedural Control is found in the procedural control region of the
13

--- Page 14 ---
test cartridge to assure the operator that the test has been properly performed. This
control does not ensure that the capture antibody is accurately detecting the presence or
absence of Hb in the sample.
AFIAS-50
Pre-programmed System Self-Check and System Check of AFIAS-50 using System
Check Cartridge & ID Chip are electronic control mechanisms to check whether
electronic features of the AFIAS-50 are within specifications.
External control: External controls are used to assure the operator that the capture and
conjugated antibodies are present and reactive. Controls should be assayed according to
the manufacturer’s instructions once per kit lot, following the local and state guidelines.
If controls do not perform as expected, the test results should not be used.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Specimen Collection Verification:
Verification that the sample collection methods using a sample collection slide and applicator
stick (used by patients and laboratories) versus sampling stick (used by laboratories only)
consistently delivers the specified amount of stool required for optimal test performance was
performed by using one lot of AFIAS iFOB extraction buffer tubes (with sampling sticks)
and collection slides (with applicator stick). Hb-free fecal samples were collected and spiked
with human blood (of known hemoglobin concentration) to obtain fecal samples containing
eight different hemoglobin concentrations: 25 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 80 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 120
ng/mL, 150 ng/mL, 500 ng/mL and 1,000 ng/mL. Twenty aliquots of each of the eight
concentrations of spiked stool test samples were tested by each sample collection method. i-
CHROMA iFOB Negative and Positive Controls were also tested to ensure and confirm the
validity of the test results. Statistical analysis of the sample collection verification study
shows that the test results from the two sampling methods have acceptable overall percent
agreement as well as positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement. There was
no statistical significance in the analyses of the test samples by the two sampling methods.
Carry-Over:
The carry-over study was conducted by using hemoglobin-negative fecal samples spiked
with human blood (of known hemoglobin concentration) to obtain fecal samples containing
25 ng/mL as the low concentration and 2,000 ng/mL as the high concentration. Four
replicates for each low concentration sample (labeled as L1, L2, L3 and L4) and four
replicates each high concentration sample (labeled as H1, H2, H3 and H4) were tested.
According to the test results and acceptance criteria, “Carry Over (%)” for all test results
were less than 1%. There is no significant carry-over with the AFIAS iFOB test on the
AFIAS-50.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
