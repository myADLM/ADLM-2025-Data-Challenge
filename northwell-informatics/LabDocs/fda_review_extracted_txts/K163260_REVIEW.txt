H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The SeptiCyte LAB is a gene expression assay using reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction to quantify the relative expression levels of host response genes isolated
from whole blood collected in the PAXgene Blood RNA Tube. The SeptiCyte LAB is
used in conjunction with clinical assessments and other laboratory findings as an aid to
differentiate infection-positive (sepsis) from infection-negative systemic inflammation in
patients suspected of sepsis on their first day of ICU admission. The SeptiCyte LAB
generates a score (SeptiSCORE) that falls within one of four discrete Interpretation
Bands based on the increasing likelihood of infection-positive systemic inflammation.
The SeptiCyte LAB is intended for in-vitro diagnostic use.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Blood must be collected in PAXgene Blood RNA Tube (K042613)
4. Special instrument requirements:
Applied Biosystems7500 FastDx Real-Time PCR Instrument
QIAcube (optional, for automated RNA extraction)
Spectrophotometer (e.g., Nanodrop)
I. Device Description:
The SeptiCyte LAB is an in vitro diagnostic test for simultaneous amplification and detection
of four RNA transcripts (LAMP1, CEACAM4, PLA2G7, PLAC8) using total RNA extracted
from human blood. The test has been designed, manufactured, and validated for use on the
ABI 7500 Fast Dx real-time thermal cycler. Each SeptiCyte LAB kit includes, in two boxes,
the reagents sufficient for up to 12 patient samples.
The specimen used for the SeptiCyte LAB is a 2.5 mL sample of whole blood collected by
venipuncture using the PAXgene collection tubes within the PAXgene Blood RNA System
(Qiagen, kit catalogue # 762164; Becton Dickinson, Collection Tubes catalogue number
762165; FDA 510k number K042613). A white blood count (WBC) of 2.7 X 105 WBC/mL
or greater must be verified prior to testing patients.
Total RNA isolation is performed using the procedures specified in the PAXgene Blood
RNA kit (a component of the PAXgene Blood RNA System). The purified total RNA must
be evaluated for concentration (A260 indicating a concentration of ≥2 ng/µL) and purity (as
estimated by A260/A280 ratio ≥ 1.6). RNA specimens may need to be adjusted in
concentration to facilitate a constant input volume of 10 µL. If purified total RNA is <2 ng/
Page 2 of 30

--- Page 3 ---
µL then the sample is too dilute to use. If purified total RNA concentration is >50 ng/µL and
≤ 500 ng/ μL , the specimen must be diluted 10-fold with SeptiCyte LAB Diluent (1 μL RNA
into 9μL Diluent) to ≤ 50 ng/µL to prevent exceeding 500 ng total input into the RT reaction.
If total RNA concentration is >500 ng/µL, the specimen must be diluted 50-fold with
SeptiCyte LAB Diluent (1 μL RNA into 49μL Diluent). Patient RNA samples are normalized
to concentrations between 2 ng/µL to 50 ng/µL using SeptiCyte LAB Diluent to result in a 20
ng to 500 ng of RNA input per RT reaction for the SeptiCyte LAB . Purified total RNA
should be tested immediately after extraction or stored frozen in single-use portions at or
below -70°C until ready for testing.
The SeptiCyte LAB uses quantitative, real-time determination of the amount of each
transcript in the sample based on the detection of fluorescence by the qPCR instrument
(Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument, Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, catalogue number 4406985; FDA 510k number K082562). The SeptiCyte LAB
includes an RT step which converts the Extracted RNA to cDNA. The cDNA is immediately
run in the qPCR portion of the test.
Transcripts CEACAM4, LAMP1, and PLAC8 are amplified, detected, and quantified in a
multiplex reaction. There is a separate reaction (singleplex) well for PLA2G7. The reported
score is calculated based on the difference between two pairwise combinations of the four
markers, using SeptiCyte Analysis software which accompanies the SeptiCyte LAB . The
software is designed to analyze .sds run files from the ABI 7500 Fast Dx instrument,
compute the likelihood of sepsis for each patient sample, and generate a separate Patient
Report for each sample.
The SeptiCyte LAB quantifies the gene expression levels of four host immune
Response mRNA targets, to produce a quantitative score (the SeptiScore) ranging from
0 – 10. The SeptiScore is interpreted by means of four Interpretation Bands, which
directly correlate with an increased likelihood of sepsis. The SeptiCyte LAB is a quantitative
blood test that combines the results of four RNA transcripts (CEACAM4, LAMP1, PLA2G7,
and PLAC8) as a single numerical result.
PAXgene Blood RNA tube extraction utilizes manual extraction with the IVD version of the
QIAGEN PAXgene Blood RNA Kit. Both standard or accelerated RNA extraction can be
performed. The standard PAXgene Blood RNA tube processing , which is performed
according to manufacturer instructions, includes the 2 hour room temperature incubation
prior to extraction while the accelerated processing does not include the 2 hour room
temperature incubation prior to extraction. The median turnaround time for the SeptiCyte
LAB including all steps from the start of the blood draw to the report generation, but
excluding the standard 2 hour pre-incubation step was 4 h 23 min. If the 2 hour pre-
incubation in included, the turnaround time results are about 6.5 hours. Semi-automated
extraction PAXgene Blood RNA Tube, using the QIAGEN QIAcube System can also be
utilized.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The intermediate precision and reproducibility of the SeptiCyte LAB was evaluated at
three analytical laboratories using pooled blood samples. Results are summarized in
Table 1A and 1B below. The blood sample pools were constructed to yield High (~9),
Medium (~5), or Low (~0.5) SeptiSCORE values. Identical replicates (prepared as
aliquots from the blood sample pools) were tested in triplicate over five non-
consecutive days with multiple operators.
When intermediate precision was assessed at the Ct level, the SD was < 1.3 cycles
and the CV was < 7%. The SD for the SeptiSCORE was ≤ 0.37 Score units. The CV,
when measurable, for the SeptiSCORE was ≤ 10%.

b. Lot-toLot Precision Study Design:
The lot-to-lot component of the precision study was to determine the extent of
variation in assay performance, due to differences in manufactured lots of the
SeptiCyte LAB reagents. The study consisted of three Branches (A, B and C). Branch
A analyzed 60 replicate blood samples from a single pool that was created by
combining blood from nine healthy individuals. Branch B analyzed 60 replicate blood
samples from each of three pools of clinical samples constructed to produce high,
medium and low SeptiSCORE values, respectively. Branch C consisted of a two-part
analysis. 50 replicates of purified healthy pool RNA were tested with each kit (Lot2
and Lot3) and 15 replicates of each of three mixtures of IVTs (Ct-Max,Ct-Mid,Ct-
Min) formulated to give maximum, medium or minimum Ct values for all four
transcripts were tested with kit Lot 1, Lot 2 and Lot 3. An additional study with 30
replicates using the purified healthy pool RNA used in Branch C was used to test
three lots of reagents. were tested with kit Lots 1, 2 and 3.
No significant performance differences were detected for three lots of test kit reagents
when used to test purified healthy pool RNA.
SeptiSCORE differences of ≤0.88 units are detected when reagent lots are tested with
synthetic IVT mixtures. These differences were within the manufacturing tolerances
for the SeptiCyte LAB reagents.
c. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A panel of clinical specimens was tested over a comprehensive range of RNA input
amounts (1000, 750, 600, 500, 400, 300, 200, 100, 50, and 20 ng per RT reaction).
The testing demonstrated a linear response for all SeptiCyte LAB transcripts at RNA
input amounts up to 50 ng across a panel samples. The testing demonstrated a strong
linear response for all SeptiCyte LAB transcripts at RNA input from 20 ng (2 ng/uL)
to 500 ng (50 ng/uL) across a panel samples. The results validated the reportable
range of 20 ng (2 ng/uL) to 500ng (50 ng/uL) of RNA input per RT reaction for the
SeptiCyte LAB .

• Single tests each of the High Positive Controls (HPC), Low Positive Control
(LPC) and Negative Control (NC), must be included in each run. The run is
valid if no flags appear for any of these controls.
• A single test of the No Template Control (NTC) is included in each run and
No Score generated results in a valid result.
• The SeptiCyte LAB High Positive Control, Low Positive Control and
Negative Control must yield SeptiSCORE values correlating with the ranges
listed in Table 2 below. If any of the SeptiCyte LAB Controls are out-of-
range, the entire batch run is invalid and an error report is generated.
The software compares each control specimen (HPC, LPC, NC) to its expected
result. Controls are run as a single replicate.
Table 2: Control Expected Results
Designation Name Expected result
HPC High Positive Band 4 (Score ≥8.0)
Control
LPC Low Positive Band 2, 3 or 4 (6.5 ≤
Control Score ≥ 3.1)
NC Negative Control Band 1 (Score < 3.1)
NTC No Template Pass (no Score
Control Generated)
If all Controls are valid, then the batch run is valid and specimen results are
reported.
If HPC, LPC, NC and/or NTC fail, the batch run is invalid and no data is reported
for the clinical specimens and an error report is generated. This determination is
made automatically by the interpretive software. The user confirms by visual
inspection of the run data. For this failure, the batch run is repeated starting with
either a new RNA preparation or starting at the RT reaction step.
In the clinical study, each plate contained a full set of controls HPC, LPC, NC, NTC.
All controls passed for all runs.
If the RNA input per RT reaction for the SeptiCyte LAB is not within the linear range
(i.e., 20 ng (2 ng/uL) to 500 ng (50 ng/uL) ), the controls will indicate that the run
passed even if the input RNA for the sample is not within the linear range.
Real time stability
Three manufactured lots of SeptiCyte LAB were found to be stable for 16 months
when stored under the label stated conditions (-15oC to -30oC).

Open vial stability
The SeptiCyte LAB kit consists of three component types: Base Reagents (BR),
Target Specific Reagents (TSR), and Controls (HPC, LPC, NC). Freeze-thaw stability
was assessed for each component type. This study validated all claims relating to
open vial stability when the freeze-thaw occurs between a -20 oC freezer and ambient
bench temperature:
• BR Stability: The BRs in the SeptiCyte LAB kit, consisting of Diluent, RT
Buffer, RT Enzyme Mix, qPCR Buffer and qPCR Enzyme Mix, are stable for are
stable for up to 12 freeze-thaw cycles.
• TSR Stability: The TSRs in the SeptiCyte LAB kit, consisting of Primer/Probe
Mix A, Primer/Probe Mix B, are stable up to four freeze-thaw cycles.
• Test Control Stability: The SeptiCyte LAB Controls, consisting of HPC, LPC and
NC, are stable for up to four freeze-thaw cycles.
Shipping stability
Shipping stability testing consisted of testing kits under different shipping
configurations and testing the shipping containers(shippers) for resistance to dropping
and crushing. Human blood peripheral leukocyte RNA (Clontech 636592) and the
SeptiCyte LAB controls (HPC, LPC, NC, and NTC) were used to assess the shipping
stability. The SeptiCyte LAB is stable under real-time and simulated shipping
conditions. The change in Ct values for shipping conditions tested was ≤+/- 0.22
cycles for all four transcripts. The change in SeptiSCORE was ≤+/- 0.5 units.
e. Detection limit:
To determine the LoD and LoQ, leukocyte-depleted blood (LDB) was spiked with
serial dilutions of white blood cells (WBCs) and 20 replicates of each level of WBC
tested with the SeptiCyte LAB Test. The lowest level at which 19/20 replicates
generated a SeptiSCORE is reported as the LoD. The LoQ is the lowest level of
WBC for which 19/20 replicates generate a SeptiSCORE with a standard deviation of
1.0 Score units or less. The LoD and LoQ were both determined to be 0.273 X 106
WBC/mL blood. Additionally, a leukocyte depleted blood (LDB) sample was
included and tested with 10 replicates to demonstrate that a SeptiSCORE would not
be generated for any of the LDB replicates.

Integrity of the No Template Control (NTC)
Contamination of any general-purpose test components (e.g., with human cellular
RNA), or non-template-directed cross-reactivity of primers and probes could generate
a defined Ct value. Accordingly, this study investigated the performance of the
SeptiCyte LAB when challenged with 40 replicates of the NTC. Diluent consists of
purified water that contains no deoxyribonuclease (DNAse) or ribonuclease (RNAse).
The panel also included controls (HPC, LPC and NC) which were used to verify
SeptiCyte LAB kit function. All three controls were correctly determined and all
NTCs (i.e., 40 / 40) had an “undetermined” Ct value for each template; meaning no
Ct values and no SeptiSCORE were obtained. Results demonstrated that the
SeptiCyte LAB does not generate Ct values or a SeptiSCORE when NTC (i.e., a
blank) is processed by the test.

Fluorescence Channel Specificity
To demonstrate that the primers and probes for each transcript (CEACAM4, LAMP1,
PLAC8) were not cross-detected in the neighboring three fluorescence channels used
by the other multiplexed transcripts in the SeptiCyte LAB , testing of In-vitro
transcripts (IVTs) corresponding to each of the four targets was prepared by in-vitro
transcription from synthetic gBlocks DNA templates (Integrated DNA Technologies).
Testing for PLA2G7 was also performed although this was considered supplementary
as the PLA2G7 reaction is singleplex in a separate reaction well. Concentrations of
in-vitro transcripts within the stock preparations were calculated in terms of
copies/μL, using the theoretical transcript molecular weight and the measured
RNAconcentration (ng/μL). Stock preparations of each IVT product were formulated
in an inert matrix consisting of polyadenylicacid(poly(A)). For this study, poly(A)
was used as matric as it mimics the polyelectrolyte and chemical composition of
clinical RNA samples and is a simple homopolymer and would not introduce a risk of
sequence-specific cross-reactivity.
Each IVT was tested both in the triplex reaction (Primer/ProbeMixA,specific for
CEACAM4,LAMP1, PLAC8) and in the simplex reaction (Primer/ProbeMix B,
specific for PLA2G7). Ten replicates of each reaction were run at 1X106 IVT copies
input per reaction.
All controls (HPC, LPC, NC, NTC) were correctly determined. In all cases (40/40)
when an IVT was correctly paired with the corresponding Primer/ProbeMix, a single
Ct value was observed in the expected channel. No Ct value’s ( 0/120) were observed
in an inappropriate reaction or channel.
The study demonstrated that the primers and probes for the individual transcripts
(CEACAM4, LAMP1, PLAC8) are not cross-detected in the neighboring three
fluorescence channels used by the other multiplexed transcripts in the SeptiCyte LAB
Test. Additionally, the presence of poly(A) carrier does not lead to detectable signal
in any fluorescent channel.
Absence of ReactivityToward Genomic DNA
Genomic DNA(gDNA) samples were tested with and without reverse transcriptase
enzyme to evaluate nonspecificity of the SeptiCyte LAB with respect to the
requirement for RNA template and absence of reactivity towards gDNA. Studies
demonstrated that the SeptiCyte LAB does not generate a SeptiSCORE when gDNA
is used as the sole source of input material for the test.
Testing was conducted over two days and included 10 replicates of the two
commercially-procured total human gDNA samples, each tested at10 ng and100 ng
input per RT reaction. Each sample was tested with and without reverse transcriptase
enzyme in the RT reaction, followed by qPCR using either theTriplex Primer/Primer
Mix A (specific for CEACAM4,LAMP1, PLAC8) or the Simplex Primer/Probe MixB
(specific for PLA2G7) at the qPCRstep. HPC, LPC and NC controls were included to
Page 15 of 30

--- Page 16 ---
verify SeptiCyte LAB kit function. NTC controls were included for detection of
potential contamination and carry-over events.
Results demonstrated that controls performed as expected depending on the presence
or absence of reverse transcriptase enzyme. No SeptiSCORE was determined when
gDNA was used as input for all conditions tested.
When gDNA was used as a template, although no SeptiSCORE could be calculated,
individual Ct values were observed for PLAC8. Further investigation was conducted.
The EP400NL pseudogene was experimentally tested for activity in the SeptiCyte™
LAB as it has significant homology to the PLAC8 coding sequence. Pure EP400NL
DNA in the form of agBlock double-stranded template was used as input in the
SeptiCyte LAB . No Ct for the PLAC8 reaction was detected, when up to108 copies
of the EP400NLg Block template was used as input to the SeptiCyte LAB.
Additionally, while the EP400NL pseudogene has significant homology to the
PLAC8 coding sequence, the production of Ct values from the EP400NL pseudogene
would require both amplification and probe binding across mismatches. In-silico
sequence analysis determined this cause to be unlikely.
Although it remains unclear why a signal is generated for PLAC8 in the presence of
gDNA and absence of reverse transcriptase enzyme, this occurrence impacts neither
the normal use of the SeptiCyte LAB . Normal use of the test includes reverse
transcriptase and the amount of residual gDNA is expected to be lower than 10 ng per
RT reaction. In addition,the other three transcripts (LAMP1, CEACAM4, PLA2G7)
were not detected. The SeptiCyte Analysis software is designed so that the presence
of an acceptable Ct value for all four transcripts is needed to generate a SeptiSCORE.
In the absence of reverse transcriptase, the study found that PLAC8 reactions yielded
high Ct values (>31cycles) at gDNA inputs of either 10 ng or100 ng. The likely cause
of low level PLAC8 detection in the presence of gDNA template and absence of
reverse transcriptase enzyme remains unresolved. However, the reverse transcriptase
should never be omitted from the recommended assay procedure. A message of an
invalid result would be returned when only the PLAC8 transcript was detected.
A limitation was added to the labeling describing that a signal is generated for
PLAC8 in the presence of gDNA and absence of reverse transcriptase enzyme.
Requirement for Reverse Transcriptase
Four RNA samples were analyzed by the SeptiCyte LAB with and without reverse
transcriptase in order to evaluate the requirement for reverse transcriptase enzyme.
The study included 10 replicates of the four RNAs tested at 1000 ng RNA input per
RT reaction. Each sample was tested with and without the SeptiCyte RT Enzyme
mix followed by the usual qPCR step (i.e., Triplex Primer/Primer Mix A
(CEACAM4,LAMP1,PLAC8) and Simplex Primer/Probe Mix B (PLA2G7)). HPC,
LPC and NC were included to verify the SeptiCyte LAB function. The study
Page 16 of 30

--- Page 17 ---
demonstrated that the SeptiCyte LAB does not generate a SeptiSCORE for HPC, LPC
or NC controls or from clinical specimens, when reverse transcriptase is omitted from
the RT step of the test.
g. Recovery:
The validated sample type for SeptiCyte LAB is a 2.5 mL peripheral blood sample
collected in a PAXgene Blood RNA tube. The recovery study determined the
variability in RNA yield for this collection tube when processed from different
collection sites and when processed either with the inclusion or omission of a two-
hour pre-incubation step, before the extraction step. The study also determined the
percentage of PAXgene blood RNA samples that will yield sufficient RNA to run the
test. The specimens included in the recovery study were blood samples collected in
PAXgene Blood RNA tubes. Six groups of samples were evaluated and demonstrated
the following results:

No significant differences in the yield of purified RNA was found between sample
groups. Across all groups, 627/630 = 99.5% of samples produced sufficient purified
RNA to perform the SeptiCyte LAB.
h. Carryover:
Carryover contamination was investigated using fifteen clinical samples. The samples
were chosen to represent SeptiSCORE values distributed across the range of clinically
observed SeptiSCORE values. The samples were received in the form of PAXgene
blood RNA tubes and total RNA was isolated from the tubes using the PAXgene
isolation kit. Both the RT and qPCR steps were evaluated.
• RT step: RNA samples (n=5) spanning the range of SeptiSCORE were tested, each
in quadruplicate. An input of 200 ng RNA was used in each RT reaction. A total of
60 RT reactions containing RNA template were interspersed with 60 NTCs, in an
alternating row pattern on three plates.
• qPCR step: Testing was conducted on a single day, over three qPCR plates.

All 15 RNA samples (tested in quadruplicate) produced acceptable SeptiSCORE
values. No cross-contamination of any of the NTC wells was observed for the RT or
qPCR plate configurations. As there were 120 NTC wells in the qPCR plates, this
implies that the frequency of carryover contamination events is < 1/120 (0.8 ).
i PAXgene Blood RNA Tube Stability:
Two PAXgene Blood RNA tubes were collected from each of nine donors and
incubated for at least two hours at room temperature according to the manufacturer’s
procedure. One tube was processed immediately after the two-hour pre-incubation;
the RNA was extracted according to the PAXgene Blood RNA extraction kit protocol
and analyzed by the SeptiCyte LAB. The other tube was frozen and stored at -70°C.
After 11 months, the frozen sample was thawed and the RNA was extracted
according to the manufacturer’s protocol and analyzed by the SeptiCyte LAB. The
SeptiSCORE values for the two RNA samples were compared by regression analysis.
The study demonstrated that blood collected and stored in PAXgene Blood RNA
tubes is stable for subsequent use in the SeptiCyte LAB for at least 11 months when
stored at -70°C.
j Stability of Extracted RNA:
The SeptiSCORE values for 20 RNA samples were compared before and after the
RNA was frozen at -70°C (+5°C) for 20 weeks. The RNA evaluated was extracted
from samples and tested directly with the SeptiCyte LAB as part of the Precision
Study (see 1a above). After running the test, the RNAs were frozen at -70°C (+5°C).
At 20 weeks after freezing, the RNAs were thawed and tested again with the
SeptiCyte LAB (frozen). The SeptiSCORE values from the fresh RNAs were
compared to the SeptiSCORE values for the frozen RNAs. The SeptiSCORE
differences were all < 1 unit. Linear regression indicated strong correlation (R2
=0.991) demonstrating that RNA extracted from PAXgene Blood RNA tubes is
stable for the SeptiCyte LAB after being frozen at -70 °C (+5°C) for 20 weeks.
k. RNA Automation Study:
The manual and automated RNA (QiaCube) extractions were evaluated using two
operators that processed a total of 48 identical sample aliquots across three PAXgene
Blood RNA Kit lots. Each operator performed two manual and two automated
PAXgene Blood RNA extractions per day for each of six non-consecutive PAXgene
Blood RNA extractions according to the manufacturer’s procedure for manual or
automated extraction (QiaCube), as described in the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit
Handbook (Version 2). Extracted RNA samples were analyzed using a standard
quantity of 100 ng RNA input into the reverse transcription step of the SeptiCyte
LAB . Extracted RNAs were measured for nucleic acid concentration (A260) and
purity (A260:A280 ratio) by Nanodrop spectrophotometer. Manually isolated RNA
concentration ranged from 11.8-70.2 ng/μL (median 60.2 ng/μL), with A260:A280
ranging from 1.9-2.1 (median 2.02). Automated extraction RNA concentration ranged
from 65.3-97.3 ng/μL (median 74.3 ng/μL), with A260:A280 ranging from 1.97-2.12
(median 2.02). Overall, a slightly higher median RNA yield was observed for the
Page 18 of 30

--- Page 19 ---
automated compared to the manual RNA extraction. The purity, as assessed by
A260:A280, was similar for both extraction methods. Significant differences between
manual and automated RNA extraction methods for the SeptiCyte LAB result. CVs
were investigated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a mixed-model
approach. All statistical analyses were carried out using custom R scripts within the R
package lme4 The precision of the SeptiCyte LAB was found to be equivalent across
manual and automated (QIAcube) PAXgene Blood RNA extraction procedures. The
CV values for all four target Cts and SeptiSCORE values for the automated extraction
were within 1 of those for the manual extraction. The CV values also aligned to those
determined in the Precision-Intermediate Study (See 1a above) using only manual
extraction.
For the clinical validation of the automated vs manual processing method, two types
of samples were analyzed: Pooled clinical samples (Part 1) and individual clinical
samples (Part 2). In Part I, pooled samples were selected to produce High, Medium
and Low (H, M, L) SeptiSCORE values as part of Branch B of the Precision Study.
The same six subject PAXgene tubes per pool (H, M, L) for a total of 18 tubes were
used. Samples were stored frozen at -70oC for 16 months before use. For Part 2, the
SeptiSCORE values from the VENUS subjects were reviewed and 10 from each of
the four SeptiSCORE Interpretation Bands were selected (total = 40). The duplicate
PAXgene™ Blood tubes from each of the 40 subjects were thawed, extracted and
analyzed. Samples were extracted using the automated method and examined for
sources of variability between two operators over four nonconsecutive days. The
automatically extracted samples were compared to the SeptiSCORE values obtained
with manually-extracted RNA previously determined by three laboratory sites and
reported in the clinical study. The SeptiSCORE values for manually extracted
samples were compared through linear regression to their automatically extracted
equivalents. The SeptiSCORE values determined from automated and manually
extracted samples were compared for all the clinical samples from both Part 1 and
Part 2 and found to be highly correlated (R2 = 0.98). The SeptiSCORE values for
each of the pools analyzed in Part 1 (H, M, and L), were within the range of
SeptiSCORE values observed in the precision study.

a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Clinical performance of the SeptiCyte LAB was evaluated through observational, non
interventional, prospective clinical trials (Molecular Diagnosis and Risk Stratification
of Sepsis (MARS- NCT01905033) and Septic Gene Expression Using SeptiCyte
(VENUS - NCT02127502)) which were conducted across eight clinical sites in the
United States and Europe. This evaluation included PAX gene Blood RNA tube
samples from 447 subjects (n=198 (n=64 from MARS and n=135 from MARs
expanded) subjects and n=249 VENUS subjects (n=129 from VENUS and n=120
from VENUS expanded)) recruited from adult patients (18-89 years old) admitted to
the ICU exhibiting at least two SIRS criteria. The demographics of the clinicaly study
population are found in Table 7a and 7b below.
The SeptiSCORE for each subject was compared to a Retrospective Physician
Diagnosis(RPD) comparator based on clinical case review by medical experts who
independently reviewed clinical information about each subject while remaining
blinded to the SeptiCyte LAB results. Case reviews occurred after the patient was
discharged from the hospital. The RPD Case Review Panel based their diagnosis on
clinical data. Two RPD methods were used:
1. Forced RPD: Subjects were stratified by diagnosis (Systemic Inflammatory
Response Syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis) according to the majority opinion of the
RPD Case Review Panelists. The category of Indeterminate was not allowed; all
subjects were forced into either the SIRS or sepsis categories,with no subjects
excluded. The performance evaluation of the SeptiCyte LAB was based on the
Forced RPD.
2. Consensus RPD: Subjects were stratified by diagnosis (SIRS, sepsis or
indeterminate) according to the majority opinion of three expert reviewers.
Indeterminate cases (n=37) were those for which a definitive diagnosis could not
be reached by expert review and were not included in the analysis.
The Consensus RPD is also presented and should be considered supplementary
information. An analysis of the study indeterminates found that these patients did
not cluster as a group, but rather span the SeptiSCORE spectrum (i.e., the
complete range of scores from 0-10 was observed). Patients classified as
indeterminates do not appear to differ in any meaningful way from that of the rest
of the intended use population, except that the clinical variables recorded for these
subjects was insufficiently clear to support a confident RPD.

The clinical study results show a relationship between SeptiSCORE and the
increasing likelihood of sepsis across each SeptiSCORE Interpretation Band. The
Likelihood Ratios (LR) in Tables 10 - 13 (below) were calculated using the standard
definition where LR equals the probability that an individual with disease has the test
result divided by the probability that an individual without disease has the test result.
This formula was applied to each SeptiSCORE Interpretation Band separately. These
predictive values depend on the likelihood ratios and the prevalence of disease.
Laboratories and other users should establish their own reference intervals for their
patient populations using the SeptiCyte LAB to reflect potential sources of variability,
such as patient gender, race, age, and preparation techniques. As higher SeptiSCORE
values were observed in this sample of African American/European of African
descent, additional analysis was performed for this subgroup (Tables 11 and 13
below).
Due to administrative errors, Tables 11, 12, 16 and 17 have been updated. In Table 11, the

Confidence Interval (80% CI) of the probability of sepsis was calculated for every
SeptiSCORE Interpretation Band using an exact binomial test via the R function
binom.test (implementing Clopper & Pearson, 1934). Upper and lower limits of the
80% CIs of the probability of sepsis for non-adjacent SeptiSCORE Interpretation
Bands were compared in order to determine if any of the non-adjacent SeptiSCORE
Interpretation Bands had overlapping 80% CIs. The probability of a sepsis diagnosis
as determined by Consensus RPD (left panel); Forced RPD (right panel) is shown
across each of the four SeptiSCORE Interpretation Bands for the Complete Clinical
Dataset. As shown in Figure 1 above, non-adjacent SeptiSCORE Interpretation Bands
displayed non-overlapping 80% confidence intervals (CIs) for probability of sepsis.
The point estimate for each Band is the observed sepsis diagnosis probability;
whiskers are the upper and lower 80% CI boundaries.The probability of sepsis
exhibited a monotonic increase that correlates with SeptiSCORE for both the Forced
RPD and the Consensus RPD.
To further evaluate whether the SeptiCyte LAB t is effective and will provide
clinically significant results in the intended use population, the SeptiCyte LAB was
also analyzed with respect to available clinical and laboratory variables (see Table 14
below) from the Complete Clinical Dataset using a backwards-elimination (BW-
Elimination) variable selection procedure, combined with a logistic regression
decision rule. The backwards-elimination was used to determine which clinical
variables best discriminate sepsis from SIRS. Area Under Curve (AUC) was used as
the metric for assessing model performance for each analysis. Models were
constructed using the Forced or Consensus RPD and the top five clinical variables
contributing to the AUC were identified. For all logistic regression models, BW-
Elimination and k-fold cross-validation were used to determine if the test provided
diagnostic clinical utility beyond that provided by other clinical variables and
laboratory assessments available within the first~24 hours of the suspicion of sepsis.
The backward elimination technique started with the full model including all
independent variables. Models were constructed including or excluding Procalcitonin
(PCT). At each step, the effect showing the smallest contribution to the model was
deleted. The logistic regression model for discriminating between sepsis and SIRS
found SeptiSCORE to be the most significant variable for each model. This
observation was found for both Consensus RPD and Forced RPD.

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ___X_____ or No ____
2. Software: FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
Note: The software V1.3 is intended to be run only using Windows 7 (not Windows 8.1)
and was validated to run only using Windows 7.
3. Specimen Identification:
The Sample IDs (for 1, 2 or 3 samples) for a run are entered into the ABI-7500 Fast Dx
setup screen, by the laboratory operator when setting up the run. The laboratory operator
types in the sample IDs through the keyboard attached to the ABI-7500 Fast Dx console.
The SeptiCyte LAB does not provide any provision for data entry other than by the
keyboard. This does not preclude the use of a bar code reader if the laboratory has a
reader that can be attached to the ABI-7500 Fast Dx and used as a data input device.
This, however, would be part of the laboratory operations, and would occur outside of the
instructions provided with the SeptiCyte LAB. The sample IDs are automatically
embedded in the SDS file, along with the associated real-time RT-qPCR data, as created
by the ABI-7500 Fast Dx during the run. SDS file is exported by the ABI-7500 Fast Dx
and manually transferred to the computer running SeptiCyte Analysis software. SDS file
is read by the SeptiCyte Analysis Software. The SeptiCyte Analysis Software parses the
contents of the SDS file, and uses each embedded Sample ID to search in the local HL7
directory for the first instance of an HL7 file that contains the corresponding Sample ID
tag within the appropriate HL7 file element. Once the SeptiCyte Analysis software
locates the corresponding HL7 file, it reads the contents of this file, and then populates
the relevant fields on the patient report with the following patient demographic
information: Patient Name, Medical Report , Blood Collection Date, Sample ID.
Alternatively, if no corresponding HL7 file is available in the local HL7 directory, then
the SeptiCyte Analysis software generates a report with only the Sample ID field
populated taking information from the ABI-7500 Fast Dx SDS file. In such a case, the
Sample ID would need to be manually linked to the patient demographic information
after the report was generated.
The SeptiCyte LAB Analysis Software imports patient demographic information from the
LIMS system via file system transfer. Further the software exports patient and report
information to the LIMS system.
