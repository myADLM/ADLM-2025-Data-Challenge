OIR Decision Summary
To: Alere Scarborough, Inc. RE: K163266
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own
Class II, Class III or Class I devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable
(delete/add items as necessary):

Alere i Influenza A & B
510(k) number: K151464
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in
its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for
use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials (labeling changes
are permitted as long as they do not affect the intended use).
3. Description of the device MODIFICATION(S):
An additional molecular beacon has been added to the assay to address an identified mismatch with
certain Flu B strains and the sugar excipient was modified to enable more efficient lyophilization and
to further streamline the manufacturing process. The Alere i Influenza A & B assay package insert has
been updated to include the additional analytical reactivity information.
4. The FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.

Analytical Reactivity (Comparison Study)
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the modified Alere i Influenza A & B assay has equivalent
or better analytical reacitivty compared to the current assay. Initial virus concentrations were prepared
until one device did not provide 3 out of 3 positive results. If testing resulted in one negative result on both
devices, the devices were tested again with a 2-fold more concentrated preparation. Two-fold more
concentrated virus preparations were tested until one device provided 3 out of 3 positive results during
the comparison testing. Acceptance criterion was set as: ‘the modified Alere i Influenza A & B assay must
perform equivalent or better than the unmodified assay. The assay procedure used was the direct swab
method.

The modified Alere i Influenza A & B Assay demonstrated superior analytical sensitivity in the
detection of Influenza B compared to the current Alere i Influenza A & B Assay.
Clinical Sample Evaluation (Comparison Study)
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of the modified Alere i Influenza A & B
test when testing retrospective clinical viral transport media samples, with performance compared to the
current Alere i Influenza A & B assay when testing the same clinical samples. On each day of testing, a
positive and a negative control swab were tested on both the current and modified Alere Influenza A & B
tests. Each clinical sample was tested n=1 on both the current and modified Alere i Influenza A & B test
according to the VTM assay procedure. Retrospective samples tested in this study are of a known
influenza status based on PCR. For samples tested in this study, the sensitivity and specificity of the
modified test must be equivalent to or higher than the current test. Results of the comparison testing are
shown in the table below.
Current Assay Modified Assay
Flu A Sensitivity 88.9% (24/27) 88.9% (24/27)
Flu A Specificity 95.9% (47/49) 100% (51/51)
Flu B Sensitivity 95.9% (47/49) 100% (51/51)
Flu B Specificity 98.7% (75/76) 100% (76/76)
The invalid rate for the current Alere i Influenza A & B assay was 2.3% (3/128); the invalid rate for
the modified Alere i Influenza A & B assay was 0.8% (1/128). The modified Alere i Influenza A & B
assay has demonstrated equivalent or superior clinical performance compared to the current Alere i
Influenza A & B assay.

Shelf Life
Test Bases containing the modified reagents were stored at the appropriate temperature for up to
four months. Following storage, QC samples and controls were tested according to the package
insert. There was one invalid result (out of 106 tested) observed with the Flu B QC specimen group
which was attributed to operator error. One false positive result (out of 51 tested) was observed in
the presumed negative nasal swab group. All other samples provided the expected results. The
results are consistent with the current Alere i Influenza A & B test and the modified test is expected
to launch with at least a four month expiration. Alere intends to expand this expiration dating as is
supported through ongoing shelf life validation testing.
A “Declaration of Conformity” statement was submitted for the manufacturing facility and validation
activities and signed by the Regulatory Affairs manager and the Quality Assurance manager. The
statements indicate that:
1. The manufacturing facility is in conformance with design control procedure requirements as
specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are available for review.
2. The validation activities, as required by the risk analysis, for the modification were performed
by the designated individuals and the results demonstrated that the predetermined
acceptance criteria were met.
In conclusion, based on the results of the analytical reactivity testing the modified labeling is truthful
and accurate. The changes do not affect the performance of the test and it is therefore substantially
equivalent to the current cleared test.
7. Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary or Statement and the Indications for
Use Enclosure.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use
for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular
modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices
demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the
design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the
device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
