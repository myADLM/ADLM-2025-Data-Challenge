L. Test Principle:
The i-STAT Glucose test is measured amperometrically. In amperometric measurements, a
potential is applied to the measuring electrode while current generated by the resulting
oxidation or reduction reactions in the test system is measured. The current generated is
directly proportional to the concentration of the analyte. Oxidation of glucose, catalyzed by
the enzyme glucose oxidase, produces hydrogen peroxide (H O ). The liberated hydrogen
2 2
peroxide is oxidized at the electrode to produce an electrical current that is proportional to
the sample glucose concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All performance studies for the i-STAT Glucose test were conducted using the i-STAT
EC4+ cartridge. The glucose test included in the EC4+ cartridge is identical to the assay
cleared in k103195 and is representative for the glucose assay found in all i-STAT
cartridges that include the glucose assay.

iii.) Precision study at 3 POC sites (using whole blood (WB))
The precision of the i-STAT Glucose Test on the i-STAT Alinity System was
evaluated using venous whole blood (native and altered) samples targeted to six
different glucose levels (30 – 50 mg/dL, 51 - 110 mg/dL, 111 – 150 mg/dL, 151 – 250
mg/dL, 251 – 400 mg/dL, and 401 – 700 mg/dL) within the i-STAT Glucose test
reportable range. One EC4+ test cartridge lot was used across 3 point of care sites. At
each site, each sample was tested 3 times on each of 7 i-STAT Alinity instruments
(total of 21 test results per sample). The results are shown below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The study was designed based on CLSI EP06-A guideline. The linearity of the
i-STAT Glucose test on the i-STAT Alinity System was evaluated by preparing a
series of glucose concentration levels in whole blood that spanned the reportable
range of the test. Whole blood was obtained from a healthy subject and altered to
produce a high sample pool and a low sample pool. Intermediate test samples were
created from the high and low pool. The test sample expected values are found in the
table below. An assessment of linearity was performed using polynomial regression
analysis for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order polynomials. The i-STAT Alinity Glucose test
results were plotted against the expected concentrations. Analysis of the regression
coefficients (using a significance level of 0.05) showed that the nonlinear coefficients
in both the second and third order were significant with p-values of the coefficients
less than 0.05. The 2nd order was determined to have the best fit and was used for the
assessment of degree of non-linearity. The degree of nonlinearity acceptance criteria
analysis results are as follows:
Expected Values Acceptance Absolute Degree
Sample ID Pass/Fail
(mg/dL) criteria of Nonlinearity
B1 787.8 39.4 23.8 Pass
B2 691.6 34.6 15.6 Pass
B3 595.3 29.8 8.9 Pass

B9 85.4 4.3 0.1 Pass
B10 45.3 3 1.3 Pass
B11 17.6 3 2.4 Pass
For all test samples, the absolute value of the degree of non-linearity met the pre-
defined acceptance criterion of less than or equal to the greater of 3 mg/dL or 5% of
expected value (glucose concentration, mg/dL). The degree of nonlinearity analysis
demonstrates that the i-STAT Glucose test used with the i-STAT Alinity instrument is
linear over the claimed reportable range of the glucose test of 20 - 700 mg/dL.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The i-STAT glucose test and glucose values assigned to i-STAT controls and
calibration verification materials are traceable to the U.S. National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) standard reference material SRM965.
The stability of the glucose test was previously cleared in k103195.
The instrument calibration is a one-point on board calibration and is performed each
time a cartridge requiring calibration is used. This one-point calibration adjusts the
offset of the stored calibration curve.
The i-STAT Controls and i-STAT Calibration Verification Material were previously
cleared in k972868 and stability/value assignment information can be found in
k972868.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limits are supported by the linearity study (see M.1.b. above). In
addition, a LoQ study was performed to verify the low end of the claimed measuring
range.
The study was based on the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. The LoQ of the i-STAT
Glucose test on the i-STAT Alinity System was evaluated on 36 instruments using
whole blood that was altered to low glucose concentrations (< 20 mg/dL) and two
EC4+ test cartridge lots over four days by three operators. The LoQ for the i-STAT
Glucose test on the i-STAT Alinity System was determined to be 5.558 mg/dL.
The i-STAT Glucose test on the i-STAT Alinity system has a measuring range of
20–700 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The interference performance of the i-STAT Glucose test on the i-STAT Alinity
System was evaluated based on CLSI EP07-A2 guideline. The interference
performance was evaluated using whole blood samples at two glucose concentrations
(low 70 – 90 mg/dL and high 110-130 mg/dL glucose concentrations). The effect of
each potentially interfering compound was evaluated by comparing the performance
of a test sample spiked to a high concentration of the compound and a control test
sample spiked with an equal volume of solvent. A compound was identified as an
interferent if the difference between the spiked test sample and the control was > 10%
of the mean of glucose test results for the control sample.

*Tested in g/L
**The molecular weight of the substance tested was used to convert the test
concentration from mmol/L to mg/dL. The molecular weight of each substance
could vary depending on the form chosen.
Hydroxyurea at a concentration of 0.92 mmol/L (7.0 mg/dL) interferes with the
i-STAT Glucose test on the i-STAT Alinity System. Hydroxyurea dose response
testing was performed and results showed that hydroxyurea concentration above
0.43 mmol/L may give a falsely elevated i-STAT glucose test result of more than
10%.
The sponsor includes the following limitations in the labeling:
“An alternative method should be used if it is suspected that the patient have been
administered hydroxyurea. A hydroxyurea concentration above 0.43 mmol/L may
give a falsely elevated i-STAT glucose test results of more than 10%.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison study compared the results of the i-STAT Glucose Test on
the i-STAT Alinity System to the i-STAT Glucose Test performance on the i-STAT 1
Wireless Analyzer (predicate). This study was conducted across 3 point of care sites,
performed in the intensive care unit (ICU), blood gas lab, emergency department
(ED) and general hospital wards. A total of 145 lithium heparin venous whole blood
specimens and 92 lithium heparin arterial whole blood specimens were tested using
one lot of i-STAT EC4+ cartridges. Twelve specimens were contrived (5.1%).
Weighted Deming regression analysis comparing the first replicate of the candidate
device results to the mean of the predicate device results yielded the following
results:

b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study comparing non-anticoagulated venous whole blood and
anti-coagulated venous whole blood (lithium heparin) was performed. The reference
matrix for this study is heparinized venous whole blood (lithium heparin collection
tubes) and the test condition is the non-anticoagulated venous whole blood sample
collected without anticoagulant. A total of 40 matched venous whole blood samples
were tested using the i-STAT Glucose test on 8 i-STAT Alinity Systems. Deming
regression analysis between first individual non-anticoagulated result and the
heparinized mean result yielded the following regression results.

Non-anticoagulated venous whole blood and anticoagulated (lithium heparin) venous
whole blood samples are acceptable for use with the i-STAT Alinity System with the
i-STAT Glucose test.

of Clinical Chemistry – Second Edition, C.A. Burtis and E.R Ashwood, eds.
(Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Company, 1994).
The reference range for whole blood with the i-STAT Glucose test on the i-STAT Alinity
System listed above is similar to reference ranges derived from serum or plasma
measurements with standard laboratory methods. The reference range shown above is
intended to be used as a guide for the interpretation of results. Since reference ranges may
vary with demographic factors such as age, gender and heritage, it is recommended that
reference ranges be determined for the population being tested. Each facility should
establish its own reference range to assure proper representation of specific populations.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
