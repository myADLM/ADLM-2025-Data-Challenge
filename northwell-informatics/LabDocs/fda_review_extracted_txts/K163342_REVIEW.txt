CLSI H7-A3: Procedure for Determining Packed Cell Volume by the Microhematocrit
Method; Approved Standard – Third Edition
L. Test Principle:
The i-STAT Hematocrit test uses the conductivity method. The measured conductivity of the
sample is inversely proportional to the number of cells in the sample. In a whole blood
sample, the plasma conducts electrical current and blood cells act as insulators. The
hematocrit sensor contained in the test cartridge first measures the electrical conductivity of
the calibrant solution, followed by the conductivity of the whole blood sample. The
hematocrit result (expressed as % packed cell volume or %PCV) is calculated from the ratio
of the sample conductivity to the calibrant conductivity. The conductivity of the sample is
also a function of the plasma electrolyte concentration. The i-STAT Hematocrit test
algorithm uses the measured electrolyte concentration in the sample (e.g. the sodium
concentration) in the calculation of the test result. As a measured electrolyte concentration is
required to calculate a hematocrit result, the i-STAT Hematocrit test is always paired with
the i-STAT Sodium test in an i-STAT cartridge.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
For the analytical performance studies described below, the i-STAT Hematocrit test was
performed using the EC4+ cartridge, which contains both the hematocrit test and the
sodium test, and was run on the i-STAT Alinity instrument.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i. Internal Site/20-day Precision Study:
The internal precision study was performed over the course of 20-days using four
levels of control material, with duplicates of each sample tested twice a day. This
study was performed at one site, using two operators, on 10 i-STAT Alinity
instruments, with one lot of test cartridges (type EC4+; 500 cartridges used). The
following components of variability for each level of control were determined and
are shown below: within-run, between-run, between-day, and total (within-
laboratory) precision. The i-STAT Hematocrit test demonstrated acceptable
precision when evaluated using control material at four %PCV levels spanning
the reportable range of the test.

material (i-STAT TriControls Calibration Verification Set) for five days, with one
run per day on five instruments and one lot of test cartridges. The results from
this study are shown below for all sites combined (within-site/total variability
includes within-run and between-run variance components). For all levels of
control material evaluated, the within-site SD and overall SD were found to be the

iii. Whole Blood Precision Study
The whole blood precision study was performed using nine venous whole blood
patient samples, either native or contrived, to generate the following hematocrit
(%PCV) target ranges: < 38%, 38–51%, and > 51%. The study was performed at
three POC sites, with each sample tested in triplicate, on seven i-STAT Alinity
instruments per site, for a total of 21 test results per sample. One lot of test
cartridges (type EC4+) was used for the study. The abnormal low hematocrit
specimens were contrived by adding plasma and the abnormal high hematocrit
specimens were contrived by removing plasma. A summary of the results from
this study is shown below. The i-STAT Hematocrit test demonstrated acceptable
precision when evaluated using fresh venous whole blood at four %PCV levels.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study was performed using heparinized venous whole blood from one
subject to make a high hematocrit sample and a low hematocrit sample (via
concentration or dilution with plasma, respectively). A series of seven samples with
varying hematocrit levels (< 15% PCV to > 75% PCV) were created by mixing
different proportions of the low and high hematocrit samples. The low and high
samples were (hematocrit) value assigned using 10 i-STAT EC4+ test cartridges on
10 i-STAT 1 Analyzers (model 300). The study was conducted at one site, using a
single instrument, and one lot of test cartridges. The regression coefficients for the
first, second, and third order polynomial regression models were determined and the
non-linear models were assessed for fit. The third order model was determined to
have the best fit and was used for the assessment of the degree of non-linearity. For
all test samples, the absolute value of the degree of non-linearity met the pre-defined
acceptance criteria of < 0.81 %PCV for samples with expected values < 15 %PCV, or
< 5.4 %PCV of the expected value for samples with expected values > 15.0 %PCV.
The linearity of the i-STAT Hematocrit test used with the i-STAT Alinity instrument
has been demonstrated over the reportable range of the test of 15–75% PCV. The
absolute value of non-linearity for the test ranged from 0.19 to 0.81 %PCV.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i. Controls and calibrators:
Control and calibration materials to be used with the i-STAT Alinity System are i-
STAT Control Solutions (Levels 1, 2, and 3), i-STAT TriControl Solutions
(Levels 1, 2, and 3), i-STAT Calibration Verification material (Levels 1–5), and i-
STAT TriControl Calibration Verification material (Levels 1–5). The control and
calibration verification materials were cleared under K972868.

clinical chemistry tests in various combinations are currently cleared for use with
previous models of the i-STAT instrument. The hematocrit test on the EC4+ test
cartridge type was evaluated in the majority of the analytical studies and the
method comparison study. The i-STAT Hematocrit test, when evaluated on the i-
STAT 1 Analyzer, is directly traceable to the microhematocrit centrifugation
reference method. The i-STAT Hematocrit test when run on the i-STAT Alinity
has been found to be equivalent to the i-STAT Hematocrit test run on the i-STAT
1 Analyzer.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of quantification (LoQ) study was performed using fresh venous whole
blood from four subjects with same-subject plasma added to dilute samples to the
target range of 13.5–14.5 %PCV. Each sample was value assigned using the i-STAT
EC4+ cartridges run on the i-STAT 1 Analyzer, which is directly traceable to the
microhematocrit centrifugation reference method. Determination of the LoQ for the
hematocrit test on the i-STAT Alinity instrument used 52 instruments, in which each
of the four diluted samples were then tested on two cartridge lots using 50 cartridges
from each lot, for a total of 100 test results per sample. The LoQ for each cartridge
lot was determined to be the lowest mean/median hematocrit level to meet the
calculated total error goal. The LoQ for the i-STAT Hematocrit test was thus
determined to be 14.0% PCV, which is the larger of the two LoQ values associated
with the two lots evaluated.
The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) for the i-STAT Hematocrit test
on the i-STAT Alinity were determined in a study conducted over four days, using
two lots of i-STAT EC4+ cartridges, and 40 i-STAT Alinity instruments.
Heparinized venous whole blood samples from four subjects were altered to generate
low hematrocrit level samples for the LoD study and used to generate plasma (“zero
hematocrit”) samples for the LoB study. The LoB was determined to be 3.8 %PCV
and the LoD was determined to be 4.5 %PCV for the i-STAT Hematocrit test on the
i-STAT Alinity.
e. Analytical specificity:
The interference study was performed using heparinized venous whole blood samples
at two hematocrit levels (low and high) tested against six potentially interfering
compounds at concentrations indicated by CLSI EP07-A2 to be “toxic” for
exogenous compounds or “pathological” for endogenous compounds (or “similarly
high” for compounds not specified in CLSI EP07-A2). For compounds identified as
interferents at the high concentration, a concentration-response curve evaluating
multiple concentrations of the interfering compound was generated. Based on this
method of interferent determination, compounds listed in the table below were found
not to interfere with the i-STAT Hematocrit test at the concentration indicated:
Non-Interfering Substances:

Compound Test Concentrations
Bromide* < 37.5 mmol/L and < 325.69 mg/dL
Bilirubin < 0.342 mmol/L and < 20.01 mg/dL

*Bromide (37.5 mmol/L) is an interferent with the sodium test and it may result in an increased rate of
star out (***) for the hematocrit test.
Total protein and high levels of white blood cells (WBC) were identified as
interferents to the i-STAT Hematocrit test for samples with certain hematocrit levels,

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison study was initially performed using 229 heparinized whole
blood samples (134 venous and 95 arterial samples). In order to provide better
coverage of the reportable range of 15–75 % packed cell volume (PCV), an additional
11 heparinized venous samples (for a total of n = 240 samples) were additionally
evaluated to help supplement the samples evaluated in the initial study. Less than
10% of all samples used in the study were contrived to supplement the lowest and
highest hematocrit samples. Samples were tested in duplicate on both the i-STAT
Alinity instrument and the i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer (K103195), using two of
each instrument type at each of the three clinical sites. Each site collected specimens
from the point-of-care (POC) settings of the intensive care unit and emergency
department. Two sites collected specimens from general hospital floors. Specimens
were evaluated in blood gas laboratories or in the hospital laboratory by typical POC
operators, to include nurses, research technicians, phlebotomists, nursing assistants,
clinical site coordinators, and certified clinical research coordinators.
Passing-Bablock (PB) and Weighted Deming (WD) regression analyses were
performed on the data separately for each site and for all sites combined, and the

(heparinized) venous whole blood samples and non-anticoagulated venous whole
blood samples. The anticoagulant study was performed using 40 anticoagulated
(lithium heparin) and non-anticoagulated whole blood samples spanning the
hematocrit reportable range (15–75 %PCV). Performance was assessed using one lot
of i-STAT EC4+ cartridges on eight i-STAT Alinity instruments. Deming regression
of the results obtained from the two sample types gave a slope of 1.00 and a
correlation coefficient of 1.00, which indicates that these two sample types gave
comparable results when tested using the i-STAT Hematocrit test on the i-STAT
Alinity.

the interpretation of results. Reference range may vary with demographic factors such as
age, gender and heritage; therefore, it is recommended that reference ranges be determined
for the population being tested. Each test facility should establish its own reference range.

Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
The specimen identification may be manually entered or automatically scanned by the
device.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The i-STAT Hematocrit test is intended to be used with arterial and venous whole blood.
The sample type must be selected using the device touchscreen. After the sample type is
selected the on-screen help appears and the help graphics on the device screen vary based
on the sample type selected. The reagent cartridge contains a sample chamber that
includes the sample well and the channel leading from the well up to the fill mark. The
cartridge label is intended to help the operator fill the cartridge correctly. When filled,
the sample chamber contains sufficient sample for testing. Sample volume and
placement are monitored by the instrument and an error message will be generated if
filled incorrectly. Either lithium heparin tube or syringe could be used but samples must
be analyzed within 30 minutes. Samples should be remixed thoroughly before testing. If
plain non-anticoagulated tube or syringes are used then samples must be analyzed within
3 minutes after collection.
5. Calibration:
The cartridge housing the i-STAT Hematocrit test includes an on-board calibration that is
performed with each cartridge use. The calibration solution is automatically released
from its foil pack and is positioned over the sensors. The signals produced by the
12

--- Page 13 ---
sensors’ responses to the calibration solution are measured. This one-point calibration
adjusts the offset of the stored calibration curve. The calibration solution is used to
measure a known resistance before the sample resistance is measured. The final
hematocrit result is based on a ratio of the known resistance and the unknown (sample)
resistance.
6. Quality Control:
Control and calibration materials to be used with the i-STAT Alinity System are i-STAT
Control Solutions (Levels 1, 2, and 3), i-STAT TriControl Solutions (Levels 1, 2, and 3),
i-STAT Calibration Verification material (Levels 1–5), and i-STAT TriControl
Calibration Verification material (Levels 1–5). The control and calibration verification
materials were cleared under K972868.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Temperature Operating Range Study:
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the i-STAT Hematocrit test
on the i-STAT Alinity across the operating temperature range of the i-STAT cartridge
(16°C to 30°C). Using the i-STAT EC4+ cartridge, the cartridge temperature operating
range of the i-STAT Hematocrit test was evaluated using blood samples at four
hematocrit levels that spanned the reportable range of the test on 40 i-STAT Alinity
instruments. The results of this study demonstrate that the performance of the i-STAT
Hematocrit test on the i-STAT Alinity instrument is not affected by operating
temperature over the temperature range of 16°C to 30°C.
2. Recovery Study:
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the i-STAT Hematocrit test recovery (using the
i-STAT EC4+ cartridge) on the i-STAT Alinity instrument across the reportable range of
15 – 75% PCV. The recovery study used seven whole blood samples with hematocrit
levels ranging from < 15% PCV to > 75% PCV, and the highest and lowest hematocrit
were value assigned using the i-STAT EC4+ cartridges run on the i-STAT 1 Analyzer.
The i-STAT Hematocrit test on the i-STAT Alinity instrument recovered between
100.1% to 102.8% of the assigned hematocrit value.
3. Altitude Study:
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the i-STAT Hematocrit test
(using the i-STAT EC4+ cartridge) on the i-STAT Alinity instrument at elevations of up
to 10,000 feet above sea level. The altitude study was performed at three altitudes (250,
5,000, and 10,000 feet) using three levels of i-STAT TriControl Control material (L1, L2,
and L3) on six i-STAT Alinity instruments. The study was performed using control
material to ensure that test results generated on different days at different altitudes were
13

--- Page 14 ---
comparable. The study as performed demonstrated that the Hematocrit test was found to
be equivalent from sea level to elevations up to 10,000 feet.
4. Cleaning Robustness Study:
The purpose of the cleaning robustness study was to evaluate the i-STAT Alinity
performance after 10,950 cleaning and disinfection cycles using CaviWipes Disinfecting
Towelettes (which corresponds to three years of peak use, with 10 cleaning and
disinfection cycles per day). The study design was based on communications with the
FDA through Pre-Submission Q130270 and using “Reprocessing Medical Devices in
Health Care Settings: Validation Method and Labeling: Guidance for Industry and Food
and Drug Administration Staff.” The study utilized three i-STAT Alinity instruments and
three i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzers, used three lots of i-STAT E3+ test cartridges, and
whole blood samples (from three healthy subjects) at four concentrations of hematocrit
spanning the range of the test were evaluated at four testing events: pre-test (before any
cleaning/disinfection), after 3650 cycles, after 7300 cycles, and after 10,950 cycles. At
each testing event, the i-STAT Alinity was evaluated for its appearance, operational
functionality, and performance. Based on the results of this study, performance up to
10,950 cycles (or three years of peak use) was not supported for all sample types tested
(samples with different levels of hematocrit).
5. Lot-to-Lot (Cartridge) Imprecision Study:
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the lot-to-lot component of variability of the i-
STAT Hematocrit test on the i-STAT Alinity instrument. Precision was evaluated using
three lots of i-STAT EC4+ cartridges over 5 days with test samples spanning the
reportable range of the test (15 – 75 %PCV). Each i-STAT EC4+ cartridge lot used in
this study was manufactured with an independent lot of hematocrit biosensor chips, thus
the three cartridge lots are unique. The precision of the i-STAT Hematocrit test was
evaluated on 15 i-STAT Alinity instruments using four levels of commercially available
i-STAT TriControl Calibration Verification materials. The lot-to-lot (between-lot)
variability for the different levels of control material had %CV values that ranged from
0.20%CV (highest control level) to 0.80%CV (lowest control level). Lot-to-lot
imprecision was found to meet the predefined acceptance criteria.

6. Operator-to-Operator Imprecision Study:
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the operator-to-operator component of
variability of the i-STAT Hematocrit test on the i-STAT Alinity instrument. Precision
was evaluated using one lot of i-STAT EC4+ cartridges over 5 days with test samples
spanning the reportable range of the test (15–75 %PCV). Testing was conducted by three
operators representative of point of care operators: a medical doctor, a nurse and a
phlebotomist. The precision of the i-STAT Hematocrit test was evaluated on i-STAT
Alinity instruments using commercially available i-STAT TriControl Calibration
Verification materials. The operator-to-operator variability for the different levels of
control material had %CV values that ranged from 0.28%CV (lowest control level) to
0.12%CV (highest control level). Operator-to-operator imprecision was found to meet
the predefined acceptance criteria.
7. Evaluation of the Effect of Sodium Study:
Since the measurement of hematocrit by the i-STAT Hematocrit test is based on a
conductivity method that relies on the measurement of the sodium concentration in the
sample, an evaluation of the effect of physiological levels of sodium on hematocrit
measurements made by the i-STAT Hematocrit test was conducted. The performance of
the i-STAT Hematocrit test was evaluated on the i-STAT Alinity instrument using whole
blood test samples at three hematocrit levels and three sodium concentrations (for a total
of nine test conditions). The effect of the sodium concentration was evaluated by
comparing the i-STAT Hematocrit test result from an i-STAT EC4+ cartridge to the
microhematocrit result of each test sample. An interfering effect was identified if the
difference between the results was > 10.8% CV of the microhematocrit result. The
microhematocrit (reference) method was used as the comparator in this study because the
sodium concentration (ionic strength) of the test sample has a direct effect on the size of
the red blood cells and thus the true hematocrit of the sample. The 95% confidence
intervals of the observed differences fell within the acceptable differences and the
acceptance criteria were met.
8. Interference by total protein:
Hematocrit measurements may be affected by the level of total protein in the blood
sample. The sponsor includes the following limitations in the labeling:

“Total protein levels may be low in neonatal and burn patient populations, as well as in
additional clinical populations listed in Statland (e.g. kidney disease, liver disease, severe
malnutrition, and malabsorption conditions)2. Total protein levels may also be decreased
in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass IV fluids. Care should be taken when
using hematocrit results from patients with total protein levels below the adult reference
range (6.5 to 8 g/dL).”
