H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The iCubate iC-GPC Assay for use on the iC-System is a qualitative, multiplexed, in
vitro diagnostic test for the detection and identification of potentially pathogenic gram
positive bacteria, which may cause bloodstream infection (BSI). The iC-GPC Assay is
performed directly on positive blood cultures, confirmed by Gram stain to contain gram
positive cocci. Cultures demonstrating mixed Gram stain results should not be tested on
the assay. The iC-GPC Assay is validated for use with select BACTEC, BacT/ALERT and
VersaTREK blood culture bottles. The iC-GPC Assay is indicated for use in conjunction
with other clinical and laboratory findings, such as blood culture isolate identification and
antimicrobial susceptibility testing, to aid in the diagnosis of bacterial bloodstream
infections; however, it is not used to monitor bloodstream infections.
The iC-GPC Assay detects organism DNA and identifies the following bacterial species
and resistance markers:
Bacterial Species Resistance Markers
mecA- associated with methicillin
Staphylococcus aureus resistance
Staphylococcus epidermidis vanA- associated with vancomycin
Streptococcus pneumoniae resistance
Enterococcus faecalis vanB- associated with vancomycin
Enterococcus faecium resistance
The iC-GPC Assay detects the mecA resistance marker, inferring mecA-mediated
methicillin resistance, and the vanA and vanB resistance markers, inferring vanA/vanB-
mediated vancomycin resistance. In mixed growth, the iC-GPC Assay does not
specifically attribute van-mediated vancomycin resistance to either E. faecalis or E.
faecium, or mecA-mediated methicillin resistance to either S. aureus or S. epidermidis.
Sub-culturing of positive blood cultures is necessary to recover organisms for
susceptibility testing, identification of organisms not detected by the iC-GPC Assay,

I. Device Description:
The iC-GPC Assay detects gram positive bacteria and resistance markers from positive blood
culture specimens that are determined to contain gram positive cocci by Gram stain.
The assay utilizes PCR for the multiplex amplification of specific gram positive bacterial and
resistance marker targets and detects the amplified targets with microarray hybridization. The
assay utilizes proprietary ARM-PCR (Amplicon Rescued Multiplex PCR) technology
allowing multiple targets to be amplified in one reaction. Testing is performed using a self-
contained disposable cassette that is processed by the iC-Processor. After processing, the
cassette is read using the iC-Reader. Final results are generated by the iC-Reader aided by
computer software for data acquisition, analysis and display in the iC-Report.
The iC-GPC Cassettes are provided in individually sealed plastic pouches which must be
stored at 2-8°C.
The analytes detected and reported by the iC-GPC Assay include the following:

analyzed using iC-Report software and a final result is generated. The user may view or print
the final result.
iC-GPC provides a qualitative result for the presence (“Detected”) or absence (“Not
Detected”) of iC-GPC target organisms. Detected organisms and resistance markers are
reported separately. If a resistance marker is identified without an associated organism
concurrently detected, the resistance marker will not be reported. Positive mecA resistance
marker results will only be reported for specimens that are also positive for Staphylococcus
aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Positive vanA and vanB resistance marker results will
only be reported for specimens that are also positive for Enterococcus faecium or
Enterococcus faecalis.

The first step of amplification utilizes a set of nested sequence‐specific primers
designed for each target. These primers are used to enrich targets as well as
incorporate tags and priming sites for the 2nd stage PCR reaction.
3. 2nd stage PCR‐ Following the 1st stage PCR, a 2nd stage PCR is conducted using
universal primers specific for tags incorporated into the amplicon during the 1st stage
reaction. The 2nd stage PCR exponentially amplifies the target sequence and prepares
it for microarray hybridization by enriching for single strand amplicons.
4. Microarray Hybridization‐ Upon completion of the 2nd stage PCR, amplified DNA is
bound by gene specific fluorescently labeled probes and hybridizes to positions on
the microarray specific for each target. Binding to a specific spot is measured by
emission from the fluorescently labeled probes upon excitation with a laser in the iC‐
Reader and is interpreted by iC‐Report to generate a data report.
5. The iC‐Report software controls the operation of the iC‐Processor and iC‐Reader,
analyzes data, and generates a test report after a run. The entire process takes
approximately four and a half hours.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Evaluation of organism concentration at bottle positivity (bottle ring)
A study was performed to establish the concentration of each iC-GPC Assay target
organism at initial bottle positivity. A total of nineteen organisms were evaluated.
Organisms were inoculated into BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic blood culture bottles
with human blood added. Bottles were allowed to incubate on the blood culture
system until initial bottle positivity. Bottles were removed from the incubator within
two hours of bottle ring after which plating and subsequent colony counts were
performed to confirm organism concentrations. A minimum of five bottles were
evaluated for each strain. The average concentrations at bottle ring are presented in
Table 1 below. These concentrations, representative of the levels that may be
observed in a clinical setting, are equivalent to or greater than the respective target
LoDs (see below) and were used to determine target organism concentrations for
analytical studies.

b. Reproducibility
A multi-site reproducibility study was conducted to assess the site to site, operator to
operator, and lot to lot reproducibility of the iC GPC Assay. A representative panel
of iC GPC target organisms and one non target organism were tes‐ted‐ at two ‐
concentrations, t‐he ‐concentration present at bott‐le ring and the concentration present
after ‐eight hours incubation post bottle ri‐ng. Testing was performed by two
independent operators at each of three sites, two external and one in house. The panel
was tested in replicates of three across five, non consecutive days. Testing was
evaluated across three cassette lots and four iC Systems. ‐
‐
Five organisms, representing each of the iC GP‐C Assay targets, plus one non target
organism were evaluated (see table 2 below). Blood culture bottles were inoculated
with low organism concentrations and appro‐priate volumes of human blood a‐nd
incubated on the automated blood culture instrument until signaled as positive by the
instrument. Within one hour after initial positivity, an aliquot was removed from each
bottle. Smaller aliquots were prepared and frozen at 20°C until testing was
performed. The bottle was returned to the blood culture instrument for approximately
eight additional hours of incubation. After this exten‐ded incubation, the bottle was
removed, and aliquots were prepared and frozen at 20°C until testing.

consecutive days. Each panel member was tested in triplicate per site, per day and per
operator. Three lots of iC-GPC Cassettes were included in the study.
Results from testing are shown in Table 3 below. Two false negative results were
observed, one bottle negative for both S. aureus and mecA. Six false positive results
were observed, five E. faecalis and one Staphylococcus epidermidis/mecA. All false
positive results occurred in blood culture bottles containing the non-targeted organism
Corynebacterium striatum, with three false positive results (two E. faecalis and one S.
epidermidis/mecA) occurring at initial bottle ring and the three additional false
positive results (all E. faecalis) occurring after eight hours incubation post bottle ring.
A total of 15 tests (1.4%) generated invalid results and were not included in the data
analysis.

Samples were stored under three temperature conditions: incubated (35 37°C, on the
automated blood culture instrument), ambient temperature (20 25°C), and refrigerated
(2 8°C). Samples were tested in triplicate for each organism and storage‐ condition at
each of the following time points: 8, 24, and 48 hours beyond i‐nitial bottle positivity.
Fo‐r each time point and storage condition, results of the study demonstrated 100%
detection for all bottle replicates containing targeted organisms and 100% negative
results for bottles containing the non-targeted organism.
Results from the specimen stability study support the following stability claims for
positive specimens stored under the following conditions: incubated (35 37°C), room
temperature (20 25°C), and refrigerated (2 8°C) for up to 48 hours beyond initial
bottle positivity. ‐

Fresh versus frozen and freeze/thaw studies:
A study was performed to evaluate the effect of freezing blood culture specimens on
performance of iC-GPC Assay. The same panel of organisms presented in Table 4
above was evaluated in contrived blood culture specimens with human blood added.
Samples were evaluated with organism concentrations both at bottle ring and eight
hours post bottle ring concentrations. For each organism and organism concentration,
three replicates were evaluated after both two and four weeks of frozen storage
between -10°C and -30°C. Study results demonstrated 100% detection of samples
containing targeted organisms and 100% negative results for bottles containing the
non-targeted organism for each time point and organism concentration evaluated.
Additional testing was conducted with the same sample panel to evaluate the effect
on positive blood culture specimens subjected to one or two freeze-thaw cycles.
Again, positive blood culture samples with organism concentrations at bottle ring and
eight hours post bottle ring concentrations were evaluated. Results of the study
showed 100% detection as expected and demonstrated no effect on iC-GPC Assay
performance for blood culture specimens subjected to two freeze/thaw cycles.
Results from the fresh versus frozen and the freeze/thaw studies demonstrated
equivalent iC-GPC Assay performance between fresh and frozen specimens and for
specimens subjected to one or two freeze thaw cycles. These results support the use
of frozen clinical specimens in the clinical study as well as frozen contrived
specimens in the reproducibility study.
Assay controls:
Internal DNA amplification and processing control: An internal positive control
of heat killed Bacillus thuringiensis is loaded into the test sample prior to DNA
extraction. The positive control is lysed, amplified using primers specific for a
B. thuri‐ngiensis cry gene, processed, and hybridized to the array at the same
time as the sample. Reporting of the positive control in the iC Report confirms
‐ 11

--- Page 12 ---
the assay was successful and ran to completion. In cases where targets are
present at high concentrations, it is possible the target sequence will be
preferentially amplified over the positive control. If the positive control is not
detected on the array but a target is reported, the assay is still considered valid. If
neither positive control nor target is reported, the assay is considered to have
failed; an end report of “Positive controls check failed” will be generated.
Recommended External Controls: The iC-GPC Assay does not include external
controls. The following recommendations for external control testing are included
in the iC-GPC package insert:
Cultured organisms for each of the iC GPC Assay targets should be tested
occasionally in accordance with laboratory defined quality control requirements. It
is recommended that external quality con‐trols are performed before testing newly
manufactured cassette lots and any time system performance is in question. A
fresh culture of recommended quality control organisms should be isolated on
TSA 5% sheep blood agar plates or equivalent media. From the growth plate,
transfer the organisms into saline, and adjust organism concentration to 0.5
MacFarland or 1x108 CFU/ml equivalent. Then, test in accordance to iC GPC
Assay instructions. If the external control fails, the test should be repeated. The
strains listed in Table 5 can be used for external control testing. ‐

External control testing, clinical study: A total of 551 quality control samples were
evaluated in the clinical study and 24 quality control failures were observed.
Six quality control failures were due to incorrect organism calls with three samples
generating false positive results and three samples generating false negative results. A
total of 17 quality control samples generated internal control failures or instrument
failures: twelve positive control check failures, two processor errors and two array
registration errors. One additional sample was processed but not read by the site.

The LoD study included preliminary estimations of target LoDs based on testing of
10 sample replicates of each strain at several organism concentrations. Additional
testing was performed with three organism concentrations spanning the estimated
LoD, with replicates of 20 tested on three different lots for each dilution. All samples
were prepared in a blood culture media/blood matrix.

The final LoD for each strain was calculated as the lowest organism concentration
(CFU/mL) demonstrating a detection rate of approximately 95%. Final LoD organism
concentrations were determined by plating and subsequent colony counts. A total of
91 runs with positive controls check failures (2.11%) and 21 system failures (0.49%)
were observed in the study and were excluded from the data analysis. Results from
LoD testing are shown in Table 8.

f. Analytical reactivity (Inclusivity)
The analytical reactivity (inclusivity) for each iC-GPC Assay target was evaluated
using multiple well-characterized and clinically relevant strains chosen to represent
temporal, geographic, and genetic diversity. Inclusivity panel organisms included the
following:
• 5 Staphylococcus epidermidis, mecA negative strains
• 6 Staphylococcus epidermidis, mecA positive strains
• 5 Staphylococcus aureus, mecA negative strains
• 58 Staphylococcus aureus, mecA positive strains, representing various
pulse- field gel electrophoresis types and including the following:
- Vancomycin-intermediate SA (VISA)
- Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL)-producing SA
- ATCC 43300 (hetero-resistant, mecA positive)
• 2 borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains (BORSA)
• 10 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains
• 5 Enterococcus faecalis, vanA/vanB negative strains
• 5 Enterococcus faecalis, vanA or vanB positive strains
• 5 Enterococcus faecium, vanA/vanB negative strains
• 5 Enterococcus faecium, vanA or vanB positive strains
A total of 106 organisms were evaluated for iC-GPC Assay Inclusivity testing with
testing performed in triplicate. Strains were tested near the target LoD (2-3x LoD) or
at the lowest level of bottle positivity. Colony counts were used to confirm final
concentration tested. In the event of a false negative result, the strain was retested
near the target LoD in replicates of ten.

Results from the study showed that all expected targets were detected by the iC-GPC
Assay with the exception of two false negative results: one false negative for S.
epidermidis and one false negative S. aureus/mecA. Repeat testing of the two strains
generated 10/10 replicates with the expected positive results. In this study there were
four runs with positive controls check failures (1.13%) and one system error (0.28%).

Note: The iC-GPC software logic only allows reporting of vanA/B targets with
Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis. Therefore the vanA target will not
be reported for positive specimens containing S. aureus strains that carry this marker
(i.e., VISA/VRSA strains).
g. Analytical specificity (Exclusivity)
The analytical specificity of the iC-GPC Assay was evaluated by testing a
comprehensive panel of non-targeted microorganisms that may be encountered in
positive blood cultures. Exclusivity panel members included organisms
phylogenetically related to iC-GPC target organisms, organisms commonly recovered
from positive blood cultures as well as common blood culture contaminants. A total
of 94 exclusivity organisms were tested. Potential cross-reactivity was evaluated by
testing panel organisms at high concentrations in blood culture bottle media with the
appropriate volume of human blood added according to bottle instructions. In the
event of a false positive result, additional replicates were evaluated. Samples
excluded from the sample set for data analyses were 17 samples with positive
controls check failures (4.4%) and 3 samples with system errors (0.8%).
Due to false positive E. faecalis results observed with samples containing
Streptococcus bovis (strain Z167), a second strain of Streptococcus bovis (ATCC
9145) was also tested. In a total of 14 sample replicates containing Streptococcus
bovis, 11 samples generated false positive results for the E. faecalis target indicating
cross reactivity of this organisms with the iC GPC Assay target. The package insert
includes a limitation indicating cross-reactivity of Streptococcus bovis with the
Enterococcus faecalis target of the iC-GPC A‐ssay.
Exclusivity results are presented in Table 10 below; performance is based on the
observation of expected negative results.

h. Microbial interference
A study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the iC-GPC Assay for samples
containing mixtures of targeted and non-targeted organisms. Samples were prepared
in a blood culture media/blood matrix with target organisms near the assay LoD
mixed with non-targeted organisms at high concentrations ranging from 106-109
CFU/mL or at concentrations present at eight hours post bottle ring. A total of 85
different non-targeted microorganisms were evaluated in combination with each of
five targeted organism strains. Testing was performed in triplicate.
For those organism combinations generating initial false negative results, additional
samples were tested in replicates of 10 with the target organism near target LoD. If
additional false negative results were observed, testing was repeated with the target
organism at bottle ring concentrations. For those combinations with unexpected initial
false negative results, additional replicate testing at the same concentration or at a
higher bottle ring concentration generated 100% positive results with the iC-GPC
Assay. Samples excluded from the sample set for data analysis included 22 samples
with positive controls check failures (1.4%) and 10 samples with system errors
(0.7%). Microbial interference study results are presented in Table 11 below;
performance is based on all expected targets detected.

i. Competitive inhibition
Performance of the iC-GPC Assay was evaluated with combinations of target
analytes that may be found in mixed positive blood cultures. One target organism was
tested at a concentration near LoD (“low organism”) in combination with a second
target organism at a concentration of bottle ring + 8 hours (“high organism”).

Combinations of five organisms representing each of the iC-GPC Assay targets were
tested, for a total of 20 combinations. Competitive inhibition results are summarized
in Table 12 below. Results represent the number of detected targeted organisms out of
the total number of replicates tested. No positive control failures or other system
errors were observed in the study.
Due to competitive inhibition, low concentration organism targets were detected in
only 3/20 (15%) of organism combinations. All high concentration iC-GPC targeted
organisms were detected in all organism combinations. A limitation was placed in the
package insert indicating the following:
• Due to competitive inhibition, target organisms present near LoD
concentrations may not be detected by the iC-GPC Assay when a second
target organism is present at higher concentrations.

Commonly used blood culture bottle media types were evaluated to demonstrate that
variability in media composition does not interfere with iC-GPC Assay performance.
A total of 19 representative strains of iC-GPC targeted organisms plus one non-target
organism were tested in 10 bottled blood culture media types. Target organisms were
tested near LoD concentrations (2-3x LoD). Expected performance for targeted
organisms was based on all expected targets identified and no false positive targets
detected. Expected performance for non-target organisms was based on expected
negative results. A total of 10 runs with positive controls check failures (1.23%) and
five system errors (0.62%) were observed in the study and excluded from the data
analysis.
Performance of the iC-GPC Assay for all BACTEC and VersaTREK bottle types and
for BacT/ALERT SA Standard Aerobic bottles met the acceptance criteria of ≥ 95%
accurate results, demonstrating acceptable analytical performance for these bottle
types with the iC-GPC Assay (see table 13 below).
False positive results for Enterococcus faecium were observed in 15/59 (25.4%) of
BacT/ALERT FA Aerobic FAN and 13/60 (21.7%) of BacT/ALERT FA Plus
Aerobic bottles for specimens prepared with target organisms present at 2-3x LoD.
Additional testing for both bottle types was performed with higher organism
concentrations of 5-10x LoD for each targeted organism. This additional testing
resulted in false positive E. faecium results for 8/59 (13.6%) and 5/60 (8.3%) of
BacT/ALERT FA Aerobic FAN and BacT/ALERT FA Plus Aerobic bottles
respectively.
The potential cause of false positive E. faecium results was further investigated using
multiple lots of uninoculated BacT/Alert FA Aerobic FAN and FA Plus Aerobic
bottles. Results from this testing showed that false positive results continued to occur
for these two bottle types with the iC-GPC Assay. Further testing of inoculated
BacT/Alert FA Aerobic FAN and FA Plus Aerobic blood culture bottles was
performed using a PCR assay that detects a different E. faecium DNAs sequence.
This testing generated positive PCR results that were subsequently confirmed by
sequencing and therefore confirming that the uninoculated bottle media contained E.
faecium nucleic acids. Results from the investigation indicate that the iC-GPC Assay
false positive E. faecium results observed in BacT/Alert FA Aerobic FAN and
BacT/Alert FA Plus Aerobic media in the analytical bottle equivalency study are not
likely due to a limitation of the iC-GPC Assay but rather are due to the presence of
remnant nucleic acids and/or non-viable E. faecium organisms in the culture media.
Although analytical testing showed significant numbers of false positive E. faecium
results for samples prepared in BacT/Alert FA Aerobic FAN and BacT/Alert FA Plus
blood culture media, there were no false positive E. faecium results observed in
clinical positive blood culture specimens for these two bottle types (i.e., no false
positive E. faecium results observed in 96 BacT/Alert FA Aerobic FAN and for 18
BacT/Alert FA Plus blood culture bottles).
26

--- Page 27 ---
Because of the observed false positive results observed in analytical testing, the result
interpretation section as well as the limitations section of the package insert indicate
that all positive E. faecium results should be confirmed using alternative methods
when testing BacT/ALERT FA Aerobic FAN or FA Plus Aerobic blood culture
bottles.
The following limitations are included in the package insert regarding testing of
BacT/Alert blood culture bottles with the iC-GPC Assay:
• There is an increased risk of E. faecium false positives when the iC-GPC
Assay is used with bioMérieux BacT/ALERT FA Aerobic FAN and
BacT/ALERT FA Plus Aerobic blood culture bottles due to remnant nucleic
acids or non-viable organisms that have been reported to be present in the
culture media. When using these bottle types, positive E. faecium test results
should be confirmed using alternative methods.
• The iC-GPC Assay has not been validated for use with bioMérieux
BacT/ALERT SN Standard Anaerobic, FN Anaerobic FAN, and FN Plus
Anaerobic blood culture bottles due to an increased risk of E. faecium false
positives from nucleic acids or non-viable organisms present in the culture
media. Anaerobic BacT/ALERT bottles including SN Standard Anaerobic, FN
Anaerobic FAN, and FN Plus Anaerobic should not be used with the iC-GPC
Assay.
Study results from the blood culture equivalency study are presented in Table 13.

k. Interfering substances
iC-GPC Assay performance was evaluated in the presence of potentially inhibiting
substances that may be present in blood and blood culture media. Samples containing
five representative target organisms plus one gram positive, non-target organism
(Group B Streptococcus) were evaluated. Samples were prepared with targeted
organisms at near LoD concentrations with each potential interferent at “worst-case”
concentrations that exceed the potentially highest concentration encountered in blood
culture bottles inoculated with indicated blood volumes. Antibiotics were tested at
five times the concentration expected in whole blood.
Target organism performance was based on all expected targets detected, while non-
target organism performance was based on expected negative results. In the event of a
false negative result, the organism/interferent was retested in replicates of ten. In the
event of a false positive result or other system failure, the organism/interferent was
retested in replicates of three. For any discordant results observed both initially and
with additional replicates, additional samples were evaluated with decreasing
inhibitor concentrations until interference was no longer observed.
Interference testing was performed in BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic blood culture bottle
media with a sodium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) concentration of 0.05% w/v.
Additional SPS at concentrations greater than 0.03% w/v was found to interfere with
iC-GPC Assay performance. Total protein (gamma-globulin and albumin) in
concentrations greater than 3g/dL was also found to interfere with iC-GPC Assay
performance. The presence of these substances in positive blood culture specimens
may result in false negative results or positive controls check failures.
A total of 10 positive controls check failures (2.69%) and three system errors (0.81%)
were observed during the study and results from these samples were excluded from

l. Carryover/cross-contamination
The iC-System is a closed system, designed to reduce the potential for carryover or
cross-contamination between samples. A study was conducted to evaluate the
potential for false positive results from carryover or cross-contamination when high
positive samples are tested consecutively with negative samples. Two representative
iC-GPC target organisms, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC BAA977 (nuc positive,
mecA negative) and Enterococcus faecium ATCC 700221 (fcm positive, vanA
positive), were tested as representative high positive samples. A gram positive non-
target organism, Corynebacterium striatum, was used as the negative sample. All
organisms were tested at high concentrations, eight hours beyond initial bottle
positivity. Positive, target organism samples were tested in an alternating pattern with
negative, non-target organism samples across eight blades of an iC-Processor.
Performance was based on accurate iC-GPC Assay target detection. No false positive
results were observed.
m. Assay cut-off:
The iC-GPC Assay identifies and reports detected analytes based on the relative
intensity levels of fluorescent markers (amplified DNA bound by gene specific
fluorescently labeled probes) hybridized to a glass microarray within the iC-Cassette.
The assay software analyzes data captured from image processing and compares
fluorescent signals from analyte-specific sensors in the sensor array to background
fluorescence.
2. Clinical studies:
a. Method comparison with FDA-cleared multiplex assay:
A method comparison study was performed at four geographically dispersed clinical
sites to evaluate the performance of the iC-GPC Assay for use on the iC-System.
Sites tested 966 leftover, de-identified blood culture specimens from aerobic and
anaerobic blood culture bottles flagged as positive by their respective continuous
monitoring blood culture system. Three of the commonly used blood culture systems
were included in the study: BD BACTEC, bioMérieux BacT/ALERT, and Thermo
Fisher VersaTREK. The following blood culture bottle types were evaluated: BD
BACTEC Standard Aerobic/Anaerobic, VersaTREK REDOX 1/2, BacT/ALERT SA
Standard Aerobic, and BacT/ALERT FA Aerobic FAN.
Blood culture specimens flagged as positive by the instrument were confirmed using
Gram stain to contain gram positive cocci prior to being entered into the study.
Specimens demonstrating mixed Gram stain results were excluded as indicated by the
assay instructions for use.
Performance of the iC-GPC Assay was evaluated as compared to an FDA-cleared
multiplex assay that detects gram positive organisms and associated resistance
30

markers directly from positive blood culture specimens. PCR and bi-directional
sequencing were also performed for all specimens with positive results for resistance
markers by either the iC-GPC Assay or an FDA-cleared multiplex assay. Results
from this additional testing were used only for discordant analysis with results
included as footnotes under the performance tables.
Additionally, performance of the iC-GPC Assay was compared to conventional
reference methods including subculture, identification of isolates using biochemical
methods or MALDI-TOF identification and phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility
testing (AST).
An additional 168 contrived specimens were tested for low prevalence organisms and
resistance markers. Contrived specimens were prepared using a variety of clinical
strains and type strains of S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, and E. faecium. Confirmation
of strain identities was confirmed by sequencing for all clinical isolates as well as
isolates containing vanA/vanB resistance markers. Contrived specimens were
prepared in BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic blood culture bottles with the appropriate
volume of blood added in accordance with bottle instructions. Organisms were spiked
into bottles at low concentrations and incubated until flagged as positive by the
instrument. Aliquots of specimens were frozen and provided to the three clinical sites
for testing.
Of the 966 positive blood culture specimens evaluated in the study, a total of 53
specimens were excluded from the study results. Of the remaining 913 specimens
remaining, 879 were fresh prospective specimens and 34 were frozen prospective
specimens.
The total specimens excluded from the iC-GPC Assay Method Comparison Study
(n=53) are listed by site and reason for exclusion in Table 16. The most common
reasons for exclusion included repeat iC-GPC errors, repeat comparator assay errors,
or exclusion of specimens with mixed Gram stain results.

When performance of the iC-GPC Assay was compared to the FDA-cleared multiplex
assay, there was no apparent difference in performance noted between the four study
sites or between the three blood culture systems. Performance for all positive bottle
types/systems combined is presented in Tables 17-24 respectively for detection of the
S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, E. faecium, mecA, vanA and
vanB iC-GPC Assay targets as compared to the comparator assay. Results are

b. Performance of iC-GPC compared to traditional culture and susceptibility testing
Performance of the iC-GPC Assay was also evaluated compared to results from
traditional laboratory reference methods that included subculture of positive bottles to
agar media, identification of culture isolates using conventional biochemical or
MALDI-TOF identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). AST
testing was comprised of cefoxitin disc testing for all Staphylococcus isolates
(phenotypic reference method for mecA) and vancomycin Etests for all Enterococcus
faecalis and Enterococcus faecium (phenotypic reference method for vanA/vanB).
Performance of the iC-GPC Assay in comparison to culture and AST testing is
presented in Tables 34-40 for each targeted analyte (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S.
pneumoniae, E. faecalis, E. faecium, mecA, vanA and vanB). Performance is stratified
by prospectively tested fresh specimens and prospectively collected, retrospectively
tested frozen specimens.

*Of the 28 observed false negative mecA results by the iC-GPC Assay, 14/28
were positive for mecA by multiple FDA-cleared multiplex assays. Repeat AST
testing also confirmed 14 false negative samples to be cefoxitin sensitive. See
note below.
Tables 41-44 include performance of the iC-GPC Assay for detection of mecA and
vanA/vanB in comparison to traditional culture and AST testing for specific organism
targets. Results include all fresh and frozen prospective clinical specimens with
performance stratified for detection of mecA with S. aureus, detection of mecA with S.
epidermidis, detection of vanA/vanB with E. faecalis and detection of vanA/vanB with
E. faecium.

NOTE: There were 21 observed false negative mecA results by the iC-GPC Assay for
specimens identified to contain methicillin-resistant S. aureus by conventional
identification methods and cefoxitin disc testing (See Table 41 below). Of these 21
specimens, five were false negative due to a missed detection for the S. aureus target.
Of the remaining 16 false negative results for mecA, all were also mecA negative by
the FDA-cleared multiplex assay used in the method comparison study. Further
investigation into these false negative results revealed that 14 of the specimens were
from a single clinical site. Additional testing of isolates from the 14 false negative
specimens was performed. Isolates were tested with an alternate real-time PCR assay
that detects mecA and mecC. This assay confirmed the isolates to be negative for both
mecA and mecC. Cefoxitin disc testing was also repeated on the 14 specimen isolates.
Upon repeat testing, all isolates were found to be susceptible to cefoxitin with a zone
size of 22mm which is very close to the cutoff of 21 mm for susceptibility/resistance.
Results from the additional testing confirm that the iC-GPC result of mecA negative
was correct for 14 of the 21 false negative mecA results.

b. Analysis of Mixed Culture Results:
In the method comparison study, there were seven mixed culture specimens that were
detected by the iC-GPC Assay, the FDA-cleared multiplex comparator assay, or with
both assays. Tables 45 and 46 list the mixed target combinations detected by iC-GPC
Assay and/or the comparator assay. There was one discrepant specimen for which the
iC-GPC Assay detected a target that was not detected by the comparator assay. There
was one discrepant specimen for which the comparator assay detected targets that
were not detected by iC-GPC. It is noted that the assay labeling includes a limitation
that due to competitive inhibition, target organisms present near LoD concentrations
may not be detected by the iC-GPC Assay when a second target organism is present
at higher concentrations.

Table 48 includes a listing of specimens for which multiple organisms were recovered
by traditional reference culture methods. There were 56 mixed culture specimens
identified by culture and standard of care isolate identification, including organisms
not detected by the iC-GPC Assay. There were a total of 12 discrepant specimens for
which the reference methods identified isolates that were not detected by iC-GPC
(false negatives). There were nine discrepant specimens for which iC-GPC detected
targets that were not detected by the reference methods (false positives).

2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes __X______ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification: Patient information is manually entered into the iMac computer
for each iC-GPC test. For each patient specimen, the user then selects “Link Cassette” in
the iC-System software and then scans the Cassette barcode using a barcode scanner.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Positive blood culture specimens are extracted from the blood culture bottle using a
syringe and placed into a sterile tube. A gram stain is then performed to determine the
presence of gram positive cocci. If gram positive cocci are present and is not mixed, the
user then pipets the well-mixed specimen into the bottom of the sample well in the iC-
GPC Cassette. The user closes the cassette cap and locks the sliding lid into place. The
loaded cassette is then placed onto the iC-Processor. When processing is complete, the
Cassette automatically ejects and then the user inserts the iC-Cassette into the iC-Reader
where the iC-Cassette is read. Results are automatically transferred to the iC-Software
and subsequently reported.
5. Calibration:
The user is not required to calibrate the instrument.
6. Quality Control:
See Section M(1)(d) above for information on internal and external controls.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not applicable
