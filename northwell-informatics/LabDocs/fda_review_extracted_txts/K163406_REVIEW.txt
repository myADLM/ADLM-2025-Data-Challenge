L. Test Principle:
Mission Cholesterol and Mission Cholesterol Pro Meter:
The Mission Cholesterol/Mission Cholesterol Pro Meter consists of a reflectance photometer
that measures the intensity of light reflected from the reagent area of a test strip. The meter
reads the Test Cartridges along with the lot-specific code chip.
Test Cartridge:
The Mission Cholesterol/Mission Cholesterol Pro Test Cartridge is a lipid panel test device
used to measure concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in
whole blood. The cartridge is a plastic housing into which multilayers of dry reagents are
applied . The test cartridge contains three distinct and separated reagent areas for total
cholesterol, HDL and triglycerides. After whole blood is applied into the test cartridge, blood
cells are separated by a glass fiber layer and a membrane. The plasma then enters the color
membrane layer and the analytes in the plasma react with the enzymes to affect a color
change. The color change is measured as a reflectance by the meter.
Total cholesterol:
Trinder reaction - Cholesterol esterase hydrolyzes cholesterol esters to free cholesterol and
fatty acids. The free cholesterol is oxidized to cholesten-3-one and hydrogen peroxide by
cholesterol oxidase. Peroxidase catalyzes the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with 4-
aminoantipyrine and phenol to produce a colored quinoneimine product.
HDL:
The dextran sulphate/Mg2+ on the test device precipitates the chylomicrons, VLDL and LDL,
leaving HDL in the sample. The HDL cholesterol concentration is then determined
enzymatically by the Trinder reaction.
Triglycerides:
Triglycerides in the sample are hydrolyzed to glycerol and free fatty acids by the action of
lipase. A sequence of three coupled enzymatic steps using glycerol kinase, glycerophosphate
7

--- Page 8 ---
oxidase, and horseradish peroxidase causes the oxidative coupling of 4-aminoantipyrine to
form a blue dye.
Calculated LDL:
When the concentration of triglycerides in the specimen is ≤ 400 mg/dL, the LDL
concentration is calculated by the Friedewald equation:
LDL cholesterol, mg/dL = total cholesterol - HDL cholesterol - triglycerides/5
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
The analytical performance studies were conducted using with the Mission Cholesterol
Monitoring System. The meters are identical and the only differences between the
Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System and Mission Cholesterol Pro Monitoring System
are the intended use with associated sample types and labeling.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three separate point-of-care (POC) studies were performed to evaluate the precision
of the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System.
#1 Precision using whole blood samples
A precision study was performed at three POC sites using freshly collected lithium
heparin venous whole blood samples. In order to cover the analytical measurement
range, whole blood samples with three concentration levels of total cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol and triglycerides were tested.
To minimize the effects of whole blood aging on the results, all samples were tested
within 4 hours from preparation. Each POC site used the same whole blood sample
as three aliquots from the same stock were taken to the three sites.
At each POC site, 3 operators performed the study. Each operator used a different lot
of cartridges; three lots per site. The same three lots were used at all three sites. Each
operator used 2 different meters to conduct a run of 25 replicates with each meter;
total of 3 operators x 2 meters x 25 replicates per meter =150 measurements per level
per site, and 450 measurements per level across all sites. Each operator tested all
three concentration levels.
Total precision represents the sum of all variabilities; the variance of total precision
was calculated by taking the sum of the between-site, between-operator, between-lot,
between-meter, and repeatability variances. The data was analyzed by ANOVA and
the results are summarized below:

#2 Precision using control materials
A second precision study was performed at three POC sites using control material.
At each clinical site, 2 operators performed the study with 1 meter, 1 run of two
replicates for each operator per day, over a total of 20 days for a total of 240
replicates per level across the sites. Each site used a different lot of test cartridges.
The control material was from one lot and common to all three sites.
The precision study was designed as a three factorial design with site/lot/meter,
operator/run, and day as the factors of interest. Total precision represents the sum of
all of these variabilities. The data was analyzed by ANOVA and the results are

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was conducted on the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System in
accordance to CLSI EP6-A.
To challenge the analytical measuring range for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol,
and triglycerides a linear dilution series of 9 levels was prepared from a high and a
low sample pool. A high sample pool was prepared by spiking each analyte into a
lithium heparin whole blood sample. The low pool was a native lithium heparin
whole blood sample. Each sample of the dilution series was tested in replicates of 10
on each of three lots of test cartridges for a total of n=30 measurements at each level.
Linearity was assessed by a polynomial evaluation of linearity. For total cholesterol,
regression analysis found statistically significant coefficients for second order and
third order polynomial fits which indicated possible non-linearity. The degree of
nonlinearity was further assessed by comparing the deviation of the second order and
third order polynomial regression lines from linearity. At each level, the deviation
from linearity by either the second order and third order polynomial was ≤ 2%.
For HDL cholesterol, regression analysis found a statistically significant coefficient
for a third order polynomial fit which indicated possible non-linearity. The degree of
nonlinearity was further assessed by comparing the deviation of the regression line
for the third order polynomial from linearity. At each level, the deviation from
linearity was ≤ 1%.
For triglycerides, regression analysis found statistically significant coefficients for a
second order and third order polynomial fit which indicated possible non-linearity.
The degree of nonlinearity was further assessed by comparing the deviation of the
second order and third order polynomial regression lines from linearity. At each
level, the deviation from linearity by either the second order and third order
polynomial was ≤ 5%.

cholesterol
Triglycerides 1.007 0.46 0.9993 ~ 45 to 695
Based on these results, the sponsor concluded that the linearity data supported the
claimed analytical measurement range for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and
triglycerides:
· 100 to 400 mg/dL for total cholesterol
· 15 to 100 mg/dL for HDL cholesterol
· 45 to 650 mg/dL for triglycerides
Readings outside of reportable range:
Bench studies and software verification studies were provided to demonstrate that if a
total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or triglycerides measurement was less than the
lower end of the analytical measurement range, a ‘<’ indicator is displayed preceding
the lower limit; e.g. <100 mg/dL for total cholesterol. If a measurement exceeded the
upper end of the analytical measurement range a ‘>’ indicator is displayed preceding
the upper limit; e.g. >400 mg/dL for total cholesterol.
LDL cholesterol
The LDL cholesterol concentration is derived by calculation using the Friedewald
equation. Software verification studies were provided to demonstrate that the
reported LDL concentration is calculated according to the Friedewald equation when
the triglycerides concentration is ≤ 400mg/dL.
Software verification studies were provided to demonstrate that if the triglycerides
concentration is > 400 mg/dL, the LDL cholesterol result will not be calculated, and
the meter will display “--”.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System is CRMLN certified for total cholesterol and
HDL cholesterol using whole blood samples. The total cholesterol assay is traceable
to the National Reference System for Cholesterol. The HDL cholesterol assay is
traceable to the National Cholesterol Education Program. The accuracy and precision
performance in lithium heparin venous whole blood met the NCEP’s performance
criteria. The triglyceride assay is traceable to NIST certified reference material
1951c.

Test cartridge shelf life stability
The shelf life stability of the Mission Cholesterol Test Cartridges in foil pouches was
assessed in a real-time stability study; test cartridges are provided in individual foil
pouches. The study protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found
acceptable to support the product shelf life under the recommended storage
conditions of 36°F to 86°F (2 to 30°C). The sponsor can currently support a shelf life
claim of 6 months.
Test cartridge stability under shipping conditions
The Mission Cholesterol Meter and Test Cartridges were stressed under conditions to
simulate the range of possible conditions experienced during actual shipping. The
study protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification
(LoQ) for the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System were conducted in accordance
with CLSI EP17-A2.
LoB: To estimate the LoB, the sponsor tested analyte free venous blood samples
using two reagent lots and two meters. The samples were tested in replicates of 10 on
each meter/lot across each of three testing days for a total of 60 replicates per lot.
LoB was derived using the parametric approach, and where the value was derived
from the 95th percentile of a normal distribution.
LoD: To estimate the LoD, the sponsor prepared five low level venous blood
samples with analyte concentrations ranging from the LoB to approximately 4 x LoB.
Each samples was tested in replicates of 10 on two reagent lots each, with one meter
per lot for a total of 20 replicates per level. The data was analyzed to calculate LOD
using a parametric analysis recommended in the CLSI guideline EP17-A2.
LoQ: To estimate the LoQ, the sponsor prepared four venous blood samples with
concentrations spanning the anticipated LoQ. The samples were tested using two lots
of test cartridges and two meters. Each sample was tested in replicates of 10 on each
instrument/ lot across two runs for a total of 40 replicates per sample. LOQ was
derived based upon a total error goal as described in CLSI EP17-A2:
Total error goals
Total cholesterol ≤9%
HDL cholesterol ≤12%
Triglycerides ≤13%

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing on the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System was evaluated in
accordance with CLSI EP7-A2.
Interference testing was performed to evaluate exogenous and endogenous substances
using lithium heparin venous whole blood spiked at two concentrations of each
analyte: total cholesterol 150 and 250 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 35 and 70 mg/dL, and
triglycerides 150 and 500 mg/dL. The samples were divided into two aliquots:
control with no added interferent and test with added interferent. Each sample was
measured in five replicates using five meters and three test cartridge lots.
The sponsor defined no significant interference according to the following for total
cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides:
Average Bias vs. Actual Level ≤ ±10%
Individual Bias vs. Actual Level ≤ ±15%
The following table lists the concentration of each substance at which no significant
interference was detected.

Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
POC method comparison studies were performed to establish the accuracy
performance of the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System at three POC sites. The
study data was analyzed in accordance with CLSI EP09-A2. A total of 369 patients
were recruited for the study at three physician office laboratory sites located in
different geographical locations. Participants included male and female adults, aged
18 years or older, across diverse ethnicities, educations, and occupations in the US.
The accuracy assessment for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides
comprised a comparison of an FDA cleared comparator method using plasma samples
to the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System using samples of: (1) fingertip

capillary collection by the lay user, (2) fingertip capillary collection by the
professional, and (3) venous draw into lithium heparin collection tube by the
professional. No contrived or altered samples were tested in this clinical POC study.
The comparator methods used lithium heparin plasma samples from the same venous
draw.
Capillary collection and self testing
For self-testing, the lay user followed the OTC product labeling and performed the
test with their capillary fingertip blood using the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring
System.
Capillary collection and testing by professional
For each participant following their self collection/testing, a medical professional
performed the test with the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System from a second
fingertip puncture.
Venous draw and testing by professional
For each participant, a venous draw was collected by a phlebotomy professional. A
medical professional then mixed by inversion the collection tube, and used the
transfer tube to collect 35 μL venous blood from the collection tube, and dispense
blood to the Mission Cholesterol test cartridge. A total of three different operators
per site conducted the test. The plasma from the venous collection was stored at -
70°C, and sent to a clinical laboratory to run on the comparator method.
The results of the method comparison studies are summarized as follows.

3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification by this device.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
For capillary specimens, following a lancing procedure, the user applies a drop (35 µL)
of fingerstick whole blood to the specimen application area of the test cartridge using the
capillary transfer tube.
For venous specimens, the user draws 35 µL venous whole blood from collection tube
using the capillary transfer tube and dispense to the specimen application area of the test
cartridge.
5. Calibration:
The Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System and Mission Cholesterol Pro Monitoring
System are factory calibrated and not user adjustable. Calibration information for the test
cartridges is stored in the code chip, which is provided with each lot of test cartridges and
is required to run the test. The meter reads the code chip automatically when inserted
into the meter. The concentrations of CHOL, HDL and TRIG based on a standard curve
is programmed into the code chip.
6. Quality Control:
The Mission Cholesterol and Mission Cholesterol Pro Monitoring Systems include two
levels of control solutions with known concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol, and triglycerides.
The Mission Cholesterol and Mission Cholesterol Pro Monitoring System also include an
optical verifier that checks the proper operation of the meter’s optical detection system.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study:
The effect of hematocrit was evaluated with two samples of lithium heparin venous
whole blood with total cholesterol at 150 and 300 md/dL, HDL at 35 and 80 mg/dL, and
triglycerides at 150 and 300 mg/dL. The hematocrit of each sample was adjusted to 30%,
35%, 42%, 50%, 55%, and 60%. Each sample was tested in 10 replicates with each of
three lots of the test cartridges (n=30). The % bias of each sample relative to a plasma
sample of the same concentration run on the comparator method, and the average % bias
at each hematocrit level relative to 42% was calculated. The bias results supported the
sponsor’s claimed acceptable hematocrit range of 30 to 50% for the Mission Cholesterol
Monitoring System.

2. Temperature and Humidity Studies:
a. To verify the operating temperature range (15 to 40°C) of the Mission Cholesterol
Monitoring System, the system was tested at the following temperatures: 15, 20, 25,
30, 35, and 40°C. Lithium heparin venous whole blood samples with cholesterol at
150 and 350 mg/dL, HDL at 30 and 80 mg/dL, and triglycerides at 120 and 450
mg/dL were tested in 5 replicates on each of three cartridge lots (n=15) at each of the
temperatures. The results relative to the comparator method supported the sponsor’s
claim that the test results are not significantly impacted by temperatures ranging from
15 to 40°C.
b. To verify the operating humidity range (20 to 90% RH) of the Mission Cholesterol
Monitoring System, the system was tested at 20%, 50%, and 90% RH and at room
temperature (23-25°C). Lithium heparin venous whole blood samples with
cholesterol at 150 and 350 mg/dL, HDL at 30 and 80 mg/dL, and triglycerides at 120
and 450 mg/dL were tested in 5 replicates on each of three cartridge lots (n=15) at
each of humidity level. The results relative to the comparator method supported the
sponsor’s claim that the test results are not significantly impacted by humidity
ranging from 20% to 90% RH.
c. A study was performed to test the device at different combinations of temperature and
humidity. The operating temperature range and humidity range for the Mission
Cholesterol Monitoring System were evaluated using 5 meters and one lot of test
cartridges, and with lithium heparin venous whole blood samples at total cholesterol
of 120, 200, 350 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol of 35, 50, 70 mg/dL, and triglycerides
85,150, 300 mg/dL. The following four combination temperature and humidity
extreme conditions were evaluated:
15°C (59°F) and 20% RH
15°C (59°F)and 90% RH
40ºC (104ºF) and 20% RH
40ºC (104ºF) and 90% RH
The results support the claimed operating temperature range of 15°C (59°F) to 40ºC
(104ºF) and operating relative humidity range of 20 to 90%.
d. Validation studies were provided to demonstrate that when the ambient room
temperature is below 15°C or higher than 40°C, the meter will display “LO.t” or
“HI.t”, and is disabled so to not conduct a measurement.
3. Sample Volume Study:
A sample volume study was conducted on the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System to
verify the robustness of the system to variations in the intended 35 µL sample volume
applied to the cartridge using capillary transfer tube. A lithium heparin venous whole
blood sample was spiked to a total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol of 50
mg/dL, and triglycerides of 200 mg/dL, as measured by the comparator methods. The
24

--- Page 25 ---
effect of different sample volumes (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50 µL) on the accuracy
performance of the device was measured on the sample in replicates of 5 on each of three
lots of test cartridges and using 5 meters. The bias results relative to the comparator
method supported the claims that the device performance is not impacted by sample
volumes ranging from 25-50 μL.
An additional study was conducted to verify that when the sample volume applied to the
cartridge is insufficient to return an accurate result the meter displays an “E-5” error due
to insufficient sample volume.
4. Infection Control Studies:
The virucidal disinfection efficacy for the Mission Cholesterol Meter was established in
k122553 using the Mission Plus Hb Meter.
Disinfection robustness testing on the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System was
performed using Oxivir® TB wipes for 10,950 cleaning and 10,950 disinfection cycles
(one cycle includes one cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting wipe) to simulate 3 years of
device use cycles (10 tests/disinfection per day, 365 working days per year for 3 year, 10
x 365 x 3 =10950). After 10950 cycles of disinfection, the meter exterior was found to
be unchanged in appearance, the meter passed a basic functional test, and a performance
evaluation found no significant change in %bias relative to a comparator method using
spiked lithium heparin venous whole blood samples. The labeling was reviewed for
adequate instructions for the cleaning and disinfection procedures.
5. Electromagnetic Compatibility:
The sponsor provided appropriate documentation certifying that electromagnetic (EMC)
testing was performed and the device systems were found to be compliant.
6. Electrical Safety:
The sponsor provided adequate documentation certifying that electrical safety testing was
performed and that all requirements for electrical safety were met.
7. Readability Evaluation:
A readability study was conducted on the User’s Manual, all package inserts, and Quick
Reference Guide for the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System. The grade reading
levels were found to be at an 8th grade level or less.
8. Altitude study:
The sponsor made no claims of operating altitude or oxygen dependency for the Mission
Cholesterol Monitoring System.
