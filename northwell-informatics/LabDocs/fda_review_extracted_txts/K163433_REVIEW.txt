L. Test Principle:
A drop of patient sample is deposited on the slide and is evenly distributed by the spreading
layer to the underlying layers. The oxidation of sample glucose is catalyzed by glucose
oxidase to form hydrogen peroxide and gluconate. This reaction is followed by an oxidative
coupling catalyzed by peroxidase in the presence of dye precursors to produce a dye. The
intensity of the dye is measured by reflected light.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-day and within-lab precision studies for the VITROS GLU assay were
performed in accordance to CLSI EP5-A3 guideline. Precision studies were
performed using 2 serum controls, 2 serum pools, 2 urine controls, 1 urine pool , 2
CSF controls and 3 CSF pools. Samples were analyzed in duplicate, over the course
of 22 working days using 3 lots of VITROS GLU slides on VITROS 4600 chemistry

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was determined following CLSI EP06-A guideline. A high glucose pool
was intermixed with a low pool to generate 14 concentration levels each tested in six
replicate determinations for each sample type (serum, urine and CSF) and compared
to hexokinase reference value. The linearity study supports the claimed measuring
range for each sample type, as shown in the table below.

The interferent substances were tested for urine at glucose concentrations of
approximately 30 mg/dL and 215 mg/dL. The sponsor defined no significant
interference for urine as bias ≤ 4.42 mg/dL for glucose concentration below 120
mg/dL and bias ≤ 3.7% mg/dL for glucose concentrations above 120 mg/dL.
The substances that showed not to interfere in urine are summarized in the following
table:

CSF
A single human CSF patient pool containing glucose approximately 65 mg/dL was
used for the hemoglobin interference evaluation. Test substance pools were made by
spiking a hemolysate stock solution prepared from human hemoglobin directly into
the CSF test pool. The control pool was made by spiking an equivalent volume blank
solvent (water) as the hemoglobin stock. Hemoglobin was tested in concentrations of
100, 150, 500 mg/dL in CSF with 6 replicates and 3 lots. The sponsor defined no
significant interference as a bias of ≤10% for glucose concentrations above 40 mg/dL.

Hemoglobin was found not to interfere up to 200 mg/dL at a glucose concentration of
65 mg/dL (bias less than 4 mg/dL).
The following limitations are listed in the package insert:
When using samples with visible hemolysis (Hb >200 mg/dL), there may be a
negative bias due to catalase released from the lysis of red blood cells. On VITROS
Systems capable of performing Sample Indices using the MicroSensor, the GLU
result will be flagged with H (Hemolysis).
Elevated lipids may limit diffusion of oxygen to the reactants. Dilute grossly lipemic
samples two-fold before analysis.
For total protein, a negative bias of -4 mg/dL (-0.22 mmol/L) is observed for total
protein = 5 g/dL (50 g/L) and a positive bias of +6 mg/dL (+0.33 mmol/L) is noted
for total protein = 10 g/dL (100 g/L) at a glucose concentration of 85 mg/dL.
Known interferences in urine:
High levels of ascorbic acid in urine will cause a large negative bias, potentially
resulting in values less than the measuring range. The degree of bias is proportional to
the ascorbic acid concentration.
Glacial acetic acid at 10 mL/L results in ~4% negative bias. The magnitude of the
bias increases with higher concentrations of glacial acetic acid (60 mL/L). Do not use
urine specimens with acetic acid as a preservative.
12N Hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 2.5 mL/dL results in a large negative bias, potentially
resulting in values less than the measuring range. Do not use urine specimens with
HCl as a preservative.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed according to CLSI EP9-A3 guideline. A
total of 113 serum samples, 105 urine samples and 45 unique CSF samples (plus
additional admixture CSF samples to cover claimed range) were assayed on one
predicate lot and one modified lot using the VITROS 4600 System.

b. Matrix comparison:
A total of 68 paired serum and plasma specimens (EDTA, sodium heparin, lithium
heparin, and sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate) with concentrations within the
claimed measuring range (20 - 625 mg/dL) were tested using the modified VITROS
GLU Slides on the VITROS 4600 Chemistry System.
