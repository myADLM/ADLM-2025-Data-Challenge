The Greiner Vacuette Urine Count and Culture, Mannitol (CCM) tubes are tubes made of
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with a pre-defined vacuum to exact draw volumes. They
are fitted with yellow Vacuette Safety Caps.
The evacuated tube contains a fine particle granulate stabilizer to preserve the urine sample at
20-25 oC for up to 48 hours. The stabilizer helps to preserve and protect the level of bacteria
and yeast at collection and maintain typically formed elements in urine sediment.

L. Test Principle:

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
The performance characteristics of the Greiner Vacuette Urine CCM tubes were determined
using organism recovery (i.e., viability) studies. The bacteria listed in Table 1 below were
evaluated in this study. The organisms evaluated were representatives from bacterial species
that are usually associated with urinary tract infections. Inoculation and organism recovery
studies conducted in accordance with the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
M40-A2 document.
To perform viability studies, organisms were diluted from 1.5 x 108 CFU/mL (equivalent to a
0.5 McFarland standard) down then spiked into pooled filter sterilized urine to get a final
concentration of 1.5 x 104, 1.5 x 103, and 1.5 x 102 CFU/mL. The spiked urine samples were
then placed in their respective Greiner Vacuette Urine CCM tubes in triplicates and held for
0, 24, 48 hours at room temperature (20-25°C) and at refrigerated temperature (2-8°C). At
the designated time intervals, the Greiner Vacuette Urine CCM tubes were removed from
storage and 100µL from each urine tube was removed and plated. The average plate count
results from the organism recovery study are shown in Table 1 below. Demonstrating that the
recovered organism concentration is within +/- 1 log of the original spiked concentration is
considered acceptable performance. The data provided shows that acceptable performance
was demonstrated for all organisms tested.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Shelf life: The shelf life for the Greiner Vacuette Urine CCM tube is 14 months after
the date of manufacture. The stability of the vacuum tubes was performed on a total
of five lots of Greiner Vacuette Urine CCM tubes. Tube vacuum stability was done in
real time. At time point zero, four tubes from each lot were averaged together to
ensure that they met (or did not exceed by more than 10%) the predetermined fill
volume (10 mL, 5 mL or 4 mL). The rest of the lot was kept at room temperature and
periodically tested at one, three, six, nine, 12, 14,and 20 months. At each time point
25 tubes per lot were tested for vacuum fill volume. Tubes were demonstrated to have
enough vacuum to autofill within 10% of the deigned fill volume for each of the three
sizes and for all the time points out to 14 months.
Sterilization: The Greiner Vacuette Urine CCM tubes are sold as sterile by e-beam
irradiation. Irradiation was set at 16.6 KG. Bioburden testing was conducted on
expired vials. The 14 month sterility claim was supported based on data
demonstrating no growth detected up to this period.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison is not applicable for a bacterial transport medium. The device itself
does not provide a result that can be used in making a clinical decision. Bench testing
studies were done to determine the ability of the Greiner Vacuette Urine CCM tube to
maintain viability of microorganisms commonly found as the etiological agents of
urinary tract infections. The microorganisms were spiked into filter sterilized pooled
urine for testing. The Greiner Vacuette Urine CCM tube showed recovery of
representative bacteria from pooled urine within the acceptance criteria recommended in
CLSI-M40-A2. (See section M.1. above ).
