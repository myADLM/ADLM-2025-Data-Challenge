fluorescence using a europium (Eu) chelate as the fluorescent label and was previously
cleared under k112161.
The modifications made to the AQT90 FLEX system in the current submission are outlined
below:
· System clean has been updated to implement semi-automated system clean using two
new accessories: a blank cartridge and cleaning solution tubes and the needle used in
the cup wash has been shortened.
· Algorithm used to determine hematocrit value has been updated.
· Flash lamp in detection system has been changed to a new flash lamp.
· The filter, which is located in the liquid pathway after the cup washing step, has been
removed.
· Test cartridge and CAL cartridge foil is now pre-laser cut on one side of the foil
instead of both sides.
· Recombinant streptavidin which is chemically identical to the old native streptavidin

L. Test Principle:
The AQT90 FLEX is a cartridge-based immunoassay analyzer, based on time-resolved
fluorescence using a europium (Eu) chelate as the fluorescent label. The test receptacles for
the assay are test cups, which contain the antibodies used for capture of the analyte, and the
Eu chelate labeled antibodies used to trace the captured analyte. The sample is added to the
test cup together with assay buffer. The cup is then incubated to allow formation of the
immuno-complex, and subsequently washed to remove unbound antibodies and sample
material. Finally, the cup is exposed to excitation light, and after a delay the emitted light
generated by the fluorescent label is measured by single photon counting. The total count is
then compared to an assay calibration curve to obtain a quantitative measurement of the
analyte’s concentration in the sample.

sample. The samples were measured in replicates of ten using one MyoTest Kit
lot and one analyzer during one day. The measured mean myoglobin
concentrations for each sample type were as follows:
Whole blood: 12.9, 15.6, 34.0, 70.8, 144.4, 275.9, 467.2, 682.4, 897.5, 1148.6,
and 1208.3 ng/mL
Plasma: 15.4, 17.2, 31.4, 59.2, 116.5, 224.4, 375.9, 550.5, 738.5, 1045.8, and
1052.3 ng/mL
The second order fit was significant for whole blood, and the third order fit was
significant for plasma. The non-linearity degree (%) was calculated to evaluate
linearity. The results showed that the deviation from linearity did not exceed 10%
for either whole blood or plasma.
The claimed measuring range for Myo is 20 – 900 ng/mL for whole blood and
plasma.
2. CKMB Test Kit:
A linearity study was performed with lithium heparin whole blood and lithium
heparin plasma samples. A linearity series with a total of 11 sample levels were
prepared by serially diluting a high CKMB concentration sample with a low
CKMB concentration sample. The linearity series samples were measured in
replicates of 10 using one Test Kit lot and one analyzer during one day. The
measured mean CKMB concentrations for each sample type were as follows:
Whole blood: 1.3, 1.7, 9.0, 15.0, 21.7, 50.4, 98.8, 177.6, 252.8, 330.4, and 331.7
ng/mL
Plasma: 1.5, 1.8, 8.5, 13.1, 19.0, 42.5, 90.2, 158.5, 220.1, 289.3, and 291.2 ng/mL
The second and third order fits were not significant for whole blood, thus the
whole blood assay was considered to be acceptably linear. The third order fit was
significant for plasma, and the non-linearity degree (%) was calculated to evaluate
linearity. The results showed that the deviation from linearity did not exceed 10%
for plasma.
The claimed measuring range for CKMB is 1.5 – 300 ng/mL for whole blood and
plasma.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
AQT90 FLEX Myo Test Kit: The antigen material, M0725 by Scripps, was used to
establish the metrological traceability chain of the AQT90 FLEX Myo assay in
k112161 and remains unchanged.
AQT90 FLEX CKMB Test Kit: The antigen material, ERM-AD455/IFCC material,
was used to establish the metrological traceability chain of the AQT90 FLEX CKMB
assay in k120326 and remains unchanged.
d. Detection limit:
Limits of detection studies followed the guidelines in CLSI EP17-A2. For the limit
of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) studies the sponsor set the Type I and II
error risks to 5 %.
LoB: The LoB study was performed by measuring four blank samples with five
replicates on three days using two test kit lots and two AQT90 FLEX analyzers (one
lot/analyzer). The total number of measurements per test kit lot across all samples and
days was 60 and a nonparametric method was used.
LoD and LoQ: The study was performed with lithium heparin whole blood and
lithium heparin plasma samples. Ten samples per matrix were measured using two
test kit lots and two AQT90 FLEX analyzers (one lot/analyzer). Each sample was
measured in 45 replicates per lot.
The LoD was calculated using the estimated LoB and the SD of the low
total
concentration samples.
To determine the LoQ, a power function was fit to the concentration versus CV
total
plot using data from all samples. For the Myo Test Kit, the intersection of this fit and
10% CV was used to determine the LoQ. For the CKMB Test Kit, the intersection
total
of this fit and the 20% CV was used to determine the LoQ.
