I. Device Description:
The hemochroma PLUS Analyzer is a battery powered, hand-held device to measure the
concentration of total hemoglobin in blood in 3 seconds with 15μL of whole blood. Whole
blood may be collected by fingerstick (capillary) or venipuncture and analyzed without pre-
processing. The hemochroma PLUS Analyzer uses hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes with
dual ports where the user applies samples either through capillary action or direct volume
pipetting.
The hemochroma PLUS Analyzer determines hemoglobin concentration in whole blood
samples using a dual wavelength photo-absorption method and measures the degree of light
absorption with a spectrophotometer. The optical distance between the hemochroma PLUS

L. Test Principle:
The hemochroma PLUS Analyzer utilizes a dual wavelength LED light source by which the
hemoglobin absorbance is detected and converted into an electrical signal. The signal is
directly proportional to the amount of hemoglobin present in the sample. The concentration
of hemoglobin is calculated based on a pre-programmed calibration. The hemochroma PLUS
Microcuvette is specifically designed for the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. Approximately
15 μL of capillary or venous blood is taken up by capillary action using the tip of the
hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette or by direct volume pipetting of the sample. The blood
filled Microcuvette is inserted onto the microcuvette holder, and the hemochroma PLUS
Analyzer measures the degree of light absorption with a spectrophotometer. The absorbance
of the light from the hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette is converted into an electrical signal.
The optical distance between the hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette walls is fixed and permits

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability
Repeatability was assessed in-house using three hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette
test lots, three hemochroma PLUS Analyzers, three operators and one lot of
hemochroma PLUS Controls (low, middle, and high hemoglobin). Five test samples
collected in K EDTA tubes with hemoglobin concentrations evenly distributed
2
throughout the lower and upper limits and medical decision levels of the analytical
measuring range of the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer were tested. Each hemochroma
PLUS Analyzer was tested seven times in duplicate (duplicate runs in the morning
and duplicate runs in the evening) for a total of 84 tests results for each hemoglobin
concentration. Sample Level 1 (5.6 g/dL) and Sample Level 5 (23.7 g/dL) were
prepared by spiking natural human whole blood samples. Sample Levels 2 (11.3
g/dL), 3 (14.6 g/dL), and 4 (18.4 g/dL) were sourced from unmodified natural
samples. Repeatability results were within the defined acceptance criteria.
Three additional repeatability studies was accessed in-house using five test samples
collected in K EDTA tubes with hemoglobin concentrations evenly distributed
2
throughout the lower and upper limits and medical decision levels of the analytical
measuring range of the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer.
Between Operator: In order to evaluate the performance for repeatability between
operators, three operators conducted the testing with five hemoglobin levels of test
samples using the same lot of the hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette and the same
instrument. Each operator repeated the test seven times in duplicate runs (duplicate
runs in the morning and duplicate runs in the evening).
Between Lot: In order to evaluate the performance for repeatability between the
hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette lots, one operator conducted the testing with five
hemoglobin levels of test samples using three different lots of hemochroma PLUS
Microcuvette and the same instrument. Each Microcuvette lot was tested seven times
in duplicate runs (duplicate runs in the morning and duplicate runs in the evening).
Between Instrument: In order to evaluate the performance for repeatability between
instruments, one operator conducted the testing with five hemoglobin levels of test
samples using one lot of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette and three different
hemochroma PLUS instruments.
Results calculated from the repeatability studies including the three additional are
represented in table (1) below.

Reproducibility
Reproducibility was conducted at three intended use sites over 20 operating days
using three hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette lots (one lot per site), three
hemochroma PLUS Analyzers (one instrument per site), and one lot of hemochroma
PLUS Controls (levels 1, 2 and 3) tested across the three sites. Testing was performed
twice daily using the same set of controls for 20 days. Each control set was run in
duplicate (two runs in the morning and two runs in the afternoon), independently, by
two operators at each site. A total of 160 test results were generated for each control
level at each site. SD and %CV for within-run, between-run, between-day, between-
operator, and between-site were calculated for each site and all sites combined.
Reproducibility results at all test sites were within the defined acceptance criteria.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study was conducted using low and high-level hemoglobin
concentrations prepared from a venous blood sample. A total of 11 hemoglobin
concentration levels (2.5, 4.8, 7.1, 9.4, 11.7, 14.1, 16.4, 18.7, 21.0, 23.3, and 25.6
g/dL) spanning the claimed measuring range of the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer
(5.0–25.6 g/dL) were tested in triplicate and analyzed using one hemochroma PLUS
Analyzer and one lot of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes. The hemochroma PLUS
Controls (low, middle, and high) were tested to ensure and confirm the validity of the
test results obtained with the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. The mean result for each
concentration was plotted against the expected value. Linear regression was
performed and based on the data analysis, the hemochroma PLUS System
demonstrated linearity over the claimed measuring range of 5.0–25.6 g/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
hemochroma PLUS Controls (low, middle, and high) Value Assignment
The hemochroma PLUS Controls were produced into three levels (low, middle, high).
Each control level was tested in 15 replicates using the same lot of hemochroma
PLUS Microcuvettes on the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. The percent difference
between the expected value and the mean value of the 15 replicates was calculated.
The average of the 15 replicates was set as the mean value: 8.5 g/dL (low control),

12.5 g/dL (middle control), and 16.2 g/dL (high control). Value assignment was
conducted using three hemochroma PLUS Analyzers with three lots of hemochroma
PLUS Microcuvettes and one lot of each control level. Each control level was tested
in 10 replicates on each hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. All data points for the
hemochroma PLUS Analyzers were within the acceptance criteria.
hemochroma PLUS Controls Stability
Closed-vial stability was determined by using three lots of hemochroma PLUS
Controls (low, middle, and high) stored at refrigerated temperature (2–8°C) and tested
one day every month in triplicate for 10 months. Controls should be brought to room
temperature (15–30°C) before testing. The hemochroma PLUS Controls (low,
middle, and high) closed-vial stability study supports a stability claim of 6 months
when stored at 2–8°C.
Open-vial stability was determined by using three lots of hemochroma PLUS
Controls (low, middle, and high) stored at 2–8°C after opening. The controls were
tested every day in triplicate for 17 days. After one hour of leaving the controls
outside of the refrigerator, the controls were tested and then placed back in the
refrigerator at 2–8°C. The open-vial stability claim was established at 14 days after
opening when stored at 2–8°C after each use.
hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes Stability
hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes shelf-life stability was determined by using three
lots of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes stored at 15–35°C. Testing was performed
one day per month in triplicate for 27 months. The hemochroma PLUS Controls (low,
middle, and high hemoglobin) were tested during the hemochroma PLUS
Microcuvettes shelf life stability to ensure and confirm the validity of the test results
obtained with the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. The study data support a shelf-life
stability claim of 24 months when stored at 15–35°C.
hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes open container (in-use) stability was determined
by using three lots of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes stored at 15–35°C. Testing
was performed one day per month in triplicate for 27 months. Every month, three lots
of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes were removed from the container and tested
with fresh hemochroma PLUS Controls (low, middle, and high hemoglobin) in
triplicate with the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer and each replicate was tested in 1-
hour intervals (total of nine test results each month). The study data support a stability
claim of 24 months when stored at 15–35°C after the seal is broken.
Sample Stability
The sample stability study was assessed using one lot of hemochroma PLUS
Microcuvettes and one hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. Thirty-seven fresh venous
blood samples were collected in K -EDTA tubes and measured immediately with the
2
hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. The venous blood test samples were then stored in the

refrigerator (2–8ºC) and tested at various time intervals (3, 6, 12 hours, and 1, 2, 3, 6,
7 days). The venous blood test samples were inverted gently 10 times to ensure
mixing of anticoagulant with blood prior to testing. The venous blood test samples
stored in the refrigerator were brought to room temperature before testing. Percent
recovery was calculated for each venous blood test sample after each time point from
the fresh venous blood sample test results. The study data support a stability claim of
24 hours when stored at 2–8°C.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by testing five blank hemoglobin (depleted
human plasma) samples measured in five replicates and tested over a period of three
days with three different lots of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes and three
hemochroma PLUS Analyzers for a total of 75 test results per lot of hemochroma
PLUS Microcuvettes. LoB was calculated by parametric analysis and was determined
to be 0.23 g/dL.
Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by testing six low Hgb samples prepared
by spiking plasma with red blood cells. Each sample was tested in five replicates over
a period of three days with three different lots of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes
using one hemochroma PLUS Analyzer for a total of 90 test results per lot of
hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes. LoD was calculated by parametric analysis and
was determined to be 1.66 g/dL.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined by testing six low Hgb samples prepared
by spiking plasma with red blood cells. Each sample was tested in five replicates over
a period of three days with three different lots of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes
using one hemochroma PLUS Analyzer for a total of 90 test results per lot of
hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes. The LoQ data are considered acceptable when the
%Total-error is smaller than the desired total error for the measurand. LoQ of the
hemochroma PLUS System was determined to be 4.5 g/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was conducted to evaluate the potential of various endogenous
and exogenous substances. Three hemoglobin levels of human whole blood were
spiked with various potential interfering substances listed in Table 6 below. Control
samples (no interfering substances) and test samples (with interfering substances)
were tested in five replicates with the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer and HemoCue Hb
301 Analyzer. All tested interference substances (endogenous and exogenous)
showed non-significant interference up to the concentrations given in Table 6 below.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison study was performed at three point-of-care clinical sites in the
United States to assess the performance of the hemochroma PLUS System compared
to the predicate device (HemoCue Hb 301 System) utilizing a total of 60 capillary
fingerstick blood samples and 60 venous blood samples collected in K EDTA tubes at
2
each site. An additional 10 spiked venous samples in the extreme hemoglobin ranges
were tested to assess the performance at the lower and upper ends of the measurement
range. Testing was performed using three hemochroma PLUS Analyzers (one at each
site), three operators (one at each site), and three lots of the hemochroma PLUS
Microcuvettes (one at each site). The hemochroma PLUS Controls (low, middle, and
high) were run prior to testing. Linear regression analyses demonstrate comparable
performance between the hemochroma PLUS System and HemoCue Hb 301 System
across the analytical measuring range. The method comparison study demonstrated
that the analytical performance of the hemochroma PLUS System test is substantially
equivalent to the predicate device.

b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed to demonstrate comparability between
venous whole blood samples and capillary whole blood samples using the
hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. The matrix comparison was performed using whole
blood (venous and capillary) from 80 study participants with one hemochroma PLUS
Microcuvette lot and one hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. The hemochroma PLUS
Controls (low, middle, and high) were run prior to testing. The percent difference
between capillary blood and venous blood (K EDTA) was calculated. A Bland-
2
Altman plot was used to analyze the agreement between capillary blood and venous
blood. The results of the Bland-Altman plot analysis and % difference between
venous whole blood samples and capillary whole blood samples on the hemochroma
PLUS Analyzer met the acceptance criteria.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Capillary or venous whole blood is directly applied from the finger or blood tube (using a
disposable pipette) to the Microcuvette. Wipe off excess blood from the surface of the
microcuvette using a piece of soft gauze. The blood-filled Microcuvette is then inserted
into the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer.
5. Calibration:
The hemochroma PLUS ID chip contains encoded memory with the calibration
data/information.
6. Quality Control:
The hemochroma PLUS Controls (low, middle, and high) are intended for use as quality
control material to assure the validity and performance of the hemochroma PLUS System
in measuring human hemoglobin concentrations. The hemochroma PLUS Controls
should be assayed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and following the local
and state guidelines. If controls do not perform as expected, the test results should not be
reported.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Comparison of hemochroma PLUS Analyzer and HemoCue Hb 301 Analyzer for Disease
Conditions:
A study was conducted to determine the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer and HemoCue Hb
301 Analyzer performance when testing certain disease conditions. Venous blood
specimens were collected from diseased donors: 3 specimens from donors with
Polycythemia, 2 specimens from the donors with hypochromia, 3 specimens from the
donors with high WBC count, and 2 specimens from sickle cell donors. Each test
specimen was tested 5 times with the HemoCue Hb 301 Analyzer and 5 times with the
hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. These results indicate that hemochroma PLUS System
hemoglobin assay meets the expected performance criteria therefore, no interference was
observed in these disease conditions.
2. Anticoagulant Comparison (K EDTA vs K EDTA, Lithium Heparin, Sodium Heparin,
2 3
and Sodium Citrate):
To evaluate the effect of anticoagulants (K EDTA, K EDTA, Lithium Heparin, Sodium
2 3
Heparin, and Sodium Citrate) on the performance of the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer,
venous blood was collected in each of 2.0 mL anticoagulant tubes (K EDTA, K EDTA,
2 3
Lithium Heparin, Sodium Heparin, and Sodium Citrate) from 50 study participants.
Spiked plasma samples were used for hemoglobin concentrations in the extreme
hemoglobin (low and high) measuring ranges. The % difference between K EDTA and
2
14

--- Page 15 ---
four different anticoagulants (K EDTA, Lithium heparin, Sodium heparin, and Sodium
3
Citrate) was calculated. A Bland-Altman plot was used to analyze the agreement between
the K EDTA tube and the four other anticoagulant tubes. The results of the Bland-Altman
2
plot analysis and % difference on the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer were within the
defined acceptance criteria.
3. Cleaning Disinfection and Robustness Testing:
To perform the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer cleaning step, the operator should use a
Micro-Kill Bleach Germicidal Bleach Wipe to wipe all surface areas of the analyzer to
remove all blood and other body fluids. During the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer
disinfection step, the operator uses Micro-Kill Bleach Germicidal Bleach Wipes to
thoroughly wet all surface areas of the analyzer. The operator also carefully disinfects the
entire surface of the hemochroma PLUS Instrument and the holder for microcuvettes with
the Micro-Kill Bleach Germicidal Bleach Wipes. There was a minimum 5-minute rest
period between each the cleaning.
The hemochroma PLUS Analyzer lifespan claim is 27375 cleaning cycles which is
equivalent to 3 years of analyzer life.
One (1) cycle = One (1) wipe for cleaning + One (1) wipe for disinfecting 25 cleaning
cycles per day x 365 days x (3) years = 27375 cleaning cycles.
The lifespan of the analyzer will vary depending on actual usage.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
