L. Test Principle:
The VALIDATE® Heparin Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Kit consists of assayed
quality control materials used to establish the relationship between theoretical and actual
performance of heparin anti-Xa activity.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision performance was evaluated on the IL ACL TOP® 500 analyzer. To obtain
estimates of repeatability and within-laboratory precision, three lots of the
VALIDATE® Heparin Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Kit (levels 1–5) were
tested with one lot of HemosIL® Liquid Heparin reagents and quality controls.
Testing was performed on one IL ACL TOP® 500 analyzer over 20 days, two runs per
day, and two replicates per run to obtain a total of 80 replicates per kit level and lot.
Estimates were expressed as %CV and SD for the within-run, between-run, between-
day, and within-laboratory (total) variance components, as illustrated in the table
below. Results for each level met the pre-determined acceptance criteria.

Heparin Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Kit using three different lots. Results
met the defined acceptance criteria.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The traceability of the IL HemosIL® heparin calibrator is traceable to the 5th
International WHO Standard 97/578 for UF heparin and the 2nd International WHO
Standard 01/608 for LMW heparin.
Shelf life and Open Vial Stability Testing:
A real-time stability study was performed to support the shelf-life claim for the
VALIDATE® Heparin Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Kit. The real-time
stability study was performed on the IL ACL TOP® 500 analyzer with four individual
VALIDATE® Heparin Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Kit lots. The shelf-life
claim was established at 5 months from the date of manufacture (DOM) when stored
at - C to -10 C. Results for each level met the defined acceptance criteria.

A freeze/thaw stress stability study was conducted to support a maximum of two
freeze/thaw events. Results for each level met the defined acceptance criteria.
Value Assignment:
A linear relationship exists between levels 1 through 5 of each VALIDATE® Heparin
Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Kit; level 1 being the lowest concentration and
level 5 being the highest concentration. Levels 1 and 5 are prepared independently by
the addition of heparin to a human plasma base matrix. The heparin is sourced from a
commercial manufacturer. Intermediate levels 2, 3, and 4 are subsequently prepared
from levels 1 and 5 by equal part dilutions. Testing was performed for each level on
five separate days with six replicates per day for a total of 30 replicates per level.
Total percent coefficient of variation (%CV) was calculated for levels 1 and 5, and
found to be within predefined acceptance criteria. Typical mean recovery values for
one representative lot tested using the VALIDATE® Heparin Calibration
Verification/Linearity Test Kit in combination with the IL ACL TOP® 500 analyzer
are presented in the table below.
