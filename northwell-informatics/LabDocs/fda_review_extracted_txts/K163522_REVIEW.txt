3. Special instrument requirements:
FilmArray Warrior Control Panel M290 was evaluated on FilmArray 2.0 instrument.
I. Device Description:
FilmArray Warrior Control Panel M290 is a quality control panel consisting of two
Controls: FilmArray Warrior Positive Control and FilmArray Warrior Negative Control. The
Positive Control contains non-infectious surrogate control material; a solution of synthetic
DNA in buffers, stabilizers and preservatives. The DNA carries segments of all biothreat
agents detected by the FilmArray NGDS Warrior Panel assay (see Table below) on
FilmArray 2.0 systems. The Negative Control is comprised of non-specific DNA in buffers,
stabilizers and preservatives. Each liquid control of FilmArray Warrior Control Panel M290
is processed separately according to FilmArray NGDS Warrior Panel assay manufacturer’s
Instructions for Use for Blood Samples.
The FilmArray Warrior Control Panel M290 is prepared nucleic acid concentrations of 5X-
10X LoD for each of the organisms detected by the FilmArray NGDS Warrior Panel assay.

Not applicable
f. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Not applicable
Stability:
Open Vial Stability: Not applicable because FilmArray Warrior Control Panel M290
is packaged for single use.
Closed Vial Real-time Stability: An accelerated stability study was performed to
establish the shelf life stability claims for the FilmArray Warrior Control Panel
M290. Based on this study, the FilmArray Warrior Control Panel M290 is expected to
be stable until the expiration date (12 months) when stored frozen (-20°C or colder)
and unopened. This product is for single use.
Real-Time Stability Program: Real-time stability studies are ongoing to support
product claims and to monitor potential assay modifications for which the FilmArray
Warrior Control Panel M290 is indicated for use. Real-time stability study protocols
and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
Shipping Stability: MMQCI ships the FilmArray Warrior Control Panel M290 on dry
ice with overnight delivery, ensuring that the control material remains frozen upon
receipt. The frozen control material is then to be stored at -20oC, as indicated in the
FilmArray Warrior Control Panel M290 Package insert. A shipping study was
performed to confirm the shipping process and to investigate the outcome of a
possible shipping delay and subsequent arrival with no dry ice. The study evaluated
two (2) lots of the FilmArray Warrior Positive Control placed in dry ice and was
stored for five (5) days at ambient temperature then tested using the FilmArray
Warrior Panel Assay. To simulate a shipping delay, two (2) lots of the FilmArray

Warrior Positive Control were stored for up to 5 days at ambient temperature and
tested using the FilmArray Warrior Panel Assay.
The study demonstrated that the FilmArray Warrior Control Panel M290 is stable for
two (2) days on dry ice in MMQCI’s standard shipping box. FilmArray Warrior
Positive Control is stable after five (5) days at ambient temperatures of approximately
19-21°C. The FilmArray Warrior Positive Control should be stored frozen (–20°C or
colder) as indicated in the package insert.

FilmArray Warrior Positive Control is a qualitative control and the expected results
are listed in the tables below.

Matrix Effects:
A study was performed to evaluate potential matrix effects of the FilmArray Warrior
Control Panel M290. To confirm that clinical matrix (blood) does not significantly
affect the results of the FilmArray NGDS Warrior Panel assay, inactivated
Francisella tularensis was spiked into the FilmArray Warrior Negative Control,
which contains the identical matrix found in the FilmArray Warrior Positive Control,
and whole blood to simulate a clinical sample. Both sample types were tested in
triplicate by the FilmArray NGDS Warrior Panel assay.
