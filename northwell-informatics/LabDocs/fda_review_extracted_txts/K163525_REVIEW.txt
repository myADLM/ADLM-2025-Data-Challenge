automated closed system with continuous load and random access capabilities that
automatically processes the samples, runs the assay and reports the results. It includes liquid
handling hardware, luminometer and computer with software-user interface. The QUANTA
Flash M2 (MIT3) assay utilizes a reagent cartridge format, which is compatible with the
BIO-FLASH instrument.
A patient’s serum is diluted with buffer and mixed with M2 (MIT3) antigen-coated beads
(final serum dilution: 1:276). Any antibodies specific for the mitochondrial antigens present
on the beads will bind to the beads. Timed incubation and wash steps are followed by the
addition of isoluminol conjugated monoclonal anti-human IgG (known as Tracer IgG).
Following additional incubation and wash steps, the isoluminol conjugate is oxidized when
Trigger 1 (Fe(III)coproporphyrin in sodium hydroxide solution) and Trigger 2 (urea-
hydrogen peroxide in sodium chloride solution) are added to the cuvette, and the flash of
light produced from this reaction is measured as Relative Light Units (RLU) by the
BIOFLASH optical system. The measured RLU is proportional to the amount of bound
isoluminol conjugate, which in turn is proportional to the amount of anti-mitochondrial
antibodies bound to the antigen on the beads.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance: For all studies presented here, the results met the sponsor’s pre-
defined acceptance criteria.
a. Precision/Reproducibility: The precision/reproducibility studies were performed in
accordance with CLSI EP05-A3.
Precision:
The precision of the QUANTA Flash M2 (MIT3) assay was evaluated on five patient
samples, along with negative and positive controls which contained anti-
mitochondrial antibodies ranging from 8.5–2187.3 CU. Samples were run in
duplicate, twice a day, for 20 days on one lot of reagent. Within-run, between-run,
between-day and total precision were calculated and summarized in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the AMR (1.2–3,000 CU) was evaluated by a study according to
CLSI EP6-A. Six anti-mitochondrial antibody positive serum samples were diluted
with negative serum in 10% increments (from 0% to 90% negative serum) to obtain
values from 1.2–3,373.5 CU. The dilutions were assayed in duplicates. Percent
recovery of obtained mean results was calculated compared to the expected mean
results (based on the dilution factor). The obtained values were plotted against
expected values. The linear regression analysis with samples falling within AMR
resulted in the following equation.

High dose hook effect:
Hook effect was assessed with serial dilution of a high concentration sample. RLU
values increased with increasing analyte concentrations, thereby confirming that high
positive specimens above the AMR do not show hook effect up to 256,113 CU
(theoretical value calculated using the highest value in the Working Curve and its
dilution factor) in the QUANTA Flash M2 (MIT3) assay.

i) Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
No international standard material for anti-M2 (MIT3) antibodies is available for
the standardization of anti-M2 (MIT3) antibody assays. Calibrators and controls
values are directly traceable to the in-house standards.
Value Assignment
Calibrators – The calibrators are human serum with stabilizer and preservative.
There are seven levels of standards that are used to create a Master Curve that is
specific for each lot of reagents, with assigned values from 6.7–3474.6 CU, plus
zero CU. The parameters for the Master Curve are provided with the reagent lot.
Three levels of commercial calibrators are marketed separately, traceable to the
Master Lot and used to calibrate the Master Curve on the BIO-FLASH®
Instrument. Calibrators are tested on at least two instruments, on at least two lots

target values and ranges for the Calibrators can be found in the table below.
Controls – Controls contain human anti-mitochondrial antibodies in stabilizer.
Controls are tested on at least two instruments, on at least two lots of reagent
cartridge, in replicates of ten to determine final value assignment. Control values
are directly traceable to the in-house Standards that are used to create the Master
Curves for the QUANTA Flash M2 (MIT3) assay. The target values and ranges
for the Controls can be found in the table below.

ii) Kit Stability:
Shelf-life stability
To establish the initial claim for shelf life, accelerated stability studies were
performed for up to 4 weeks at 37°C ± 3°C, where one week is equal to six
months at 5 ± 3°C. Accelerated stability testing was performed on each of the
following sealed components of the QUANTA Flash M2 (MIT3) to establish
initial stability claim: the beads, the two Calibrators, the Negative and Positive
Controls and two high positive samples (>2000 CU). Each week a new sealed
component was placed in the incubator, and all components were tested at the end
of the experiment together with the one that was stored at 5 ± 3°C. The recovery
of the measured values was calculated for each time point by comparing results of
sealed components stored at 37 ± 3°C (test) for 1, 2, 3, and (optional) 4 weeks to
those stored at 5 ± 3°C (control), where one week is equal to six months at 5 ±
3°C.
A real-time stability study is underway and currently available data supports a 12-
month stability claim when stored at 2–8oC..
On-board/in-use stability
Calibrators: Calibrators were placed uncapped, onboard the instrument, and
calibration was performed altogether five times over nine hours. Controls and a
panel of characterized patient specimens were run on each calibration curve.
Testing verified that calibrators can be used for up to four calibrations over an
eight hour period.

Controls: Two vials of each control were assayed once a day for a total of 20
runs. The first run was used to establish baseline value, by running each vial in
duplicate, and then additional 19 runs were performed, by running each vial in
singlicate. During runs, the controls were left uncapped, onboard the instrument
for 15 minutes per run. When not in use, the controls were capped, and stored at 5
± 3°C. Results obtained support the claim that controls can be used for up to 15
times, at ten minutes per use.
Reagent Cartridge: Two lots of cartridges were tested with four serum specimens.
The specimens were tested periodically up to 70 days. Percent recoveries were
calculated compared to the average values at Day 0, and linear regression analysis
was performed by plotting % recovery against the number of days. Based on this
study, the in-use (on-board) stability of M2 (MIT3) reagent cartridge was set up to
60 days.
iii) Sample Storage:
Four samples, encompassing negative, around the cut-off, and positive samples
were tested in duplicates for up to 21 days while stored at 2–8°C, up to 48 hours
while stored at room temperature and after repeated freeze/thaw cycles up to 3
cycles. Results were compared to those obtained on control samples (day zero,
stored at 2-8°C). Based on these results, the sponsor recommends that samples
could be stored up to 48 hours at room temperature, up to 14 days at 2-8°C, and
can be subjected to up to 3 freeze/thaw cycles (when samples are stored at or
below −20°C).
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
were determined based on the studies designed according to CLSI EP17-A2.
The LoB was determined by testing four blank samples (System Rinse). Samples
were run in replicates of five on two reagent lots, once per day, for 3 days, with 60
data points generated on each lot. The LoB for each lot was calculated separately at
the 95th percentile. The claimed LoB is 0.43 CU.
The LoD was determined by testing four low level samples with two reagent lots,
consistent with CLSI EP17-A2. The LoD was established with less than 5% false
positive and false negative results based on 240 determinations; 60 measurements on
blank samples from LoB study and 60 measurements of low level samples with two
reagent lots. The claimed LoD of the QUANTA Flash M2 (MIT3) assay is 0.61 CU
and is below the lower limit of the analytical measuring range (AMR) of the assay.
The LoQ was determined based on the data generated from the LoD study with a total
error (TE) goal of 25%. The claimed LoQ for the assay is 1.2 CU and is the lower
11

limit of the AMR.
e. Analytical specificity:
i) Endogenous Interference:
The interference study was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2. Five
specimens, one high positive (1422.5 CU), one moderately positive (392.4 CU),
two near the cutoff (13.9 and 22.1 CU), and one negative (9.9 CU) sample were
tested. Interfering substances (hemoglobin, conjugated bilirubin, triglycerides,
cholesterol, human IgG, glutamate oxacatate transaminase and high density
lipoprotein) were spiked into every specimen at three different concentrations in
10% of total specimen volume, and the resulting samples were assessed in
triplicates with the QUANTA Flash M2 (MIT3) assay. Six additional samples
were tested for rheumatoid factor (RF) interference by combining them with
different concentrations of a high positive RF IgM serum sample (1,534 IU/mL).
Recovery of the unit values was calculated compared to control samples spiked
with the same volume of diluents (10% of total sample volume). No interference
was detected in the samples up to the concentrations listed in the table below.
Potential Interfering Test % Recovery
Compound Concentration
Bilirubin (conjugated) 1 mg/mL 93% – 100%
Hemoglobin 2 mg/mL 94% – 101%
Triglycerides 1000 mg/dL 94% – 102%
Cholesterol 332.5 mg/dL 97% – 104%

Glutamate Oxacatate 0.12 IU/mL 98% – 115%
Transaminase
High Density Lipoprotein 3.5 mg/mL 95% – 105%
In addition, the same protocol was used to evaluate the interference of six drugs
commonly used to treat primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). The tested
concentrations for the drugs were three times the therapeutic concentration. No
interference was detected in the samples up the concentrations listed in the table
below.
Potential Interfering Test % Recovery

f. Assay cut-off:
The reference population for establishing the reference interval for the M2 (MIT3)
assay consisted of 180 subjects:
Sample Group N
Apparently healthy blood donors 100
Infectious disease 30
Rheumatoid arthritis 30
Celiac Disease 20
The cut-off was established in accordance to CLSI EP28-A3c. One high positive
sample confirmed to be true positive with the predicate device was excluded from the
calculations as an outlier. The 99th percentile of the remaining obtained values was
calculated as 3,835 RLU. Additionally, three diagnosed PBC patient specimens were
assayed to aid in the determination of the cut-off. Based on these results, the cut-off
was increased to 6,000 RLU to ensure optimal differentiation between negatives and
positives, and a 20 CU value was assigned to this RLU value. No reference patients
tested positive at this new cut-off level.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Samples for method comparison analysis included 409 samples from the clinical
validation study plus an additional eight contrived samples to yield a total of 417
samples with 20 around the cutoff (15–25 CU). These samples were tested on both
the QUANTA Flash M2 (MIT3) and on the predicate QUANTA Lite M2 EP (MIT3)
ELISA. A total of 174 samples within the AMRs of both assays were included in the
method comparison analysis to evaluate negative percent agreement (NPA), positive
percent agreement (PPA), and total percent agreement (TPA). The data are presented
in the following tables.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical sensitivity and specificity:
A total of 586 characterized samples were included in the clinical evaluation for the
QUANTA Flash M2 (MIT3). This validation set of samples included 151 samples
from patients diagnosed with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and 435 control
samples from patients with various types of liver and gastroenterological diseases,
other autoimmune syndromes, and various infectious diseases. Literature indicates a
relatively high prevalence of PBC in Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (LSSc)
patients, as compared to the general population. LSSc samples were therefore
excluded from sensitivity and specificity calculations. Additionally, four samples
with AIH/PBC overlap were excluded for all sensitivity and specificity calculations.
Clinical sensitivity and specificity for PBC is summarized in the following table:

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected value in the normal population is “negative”. Anti-mitochondrial antibody
levels were analyzed in a cohort of 100 apparently healthy blood donors (50 females and
50 males, ages 17 to 57 years, with an average and median age of 34 years) using the
QUANTA Flash M2 (MIT3). This patient population was different from the one that was
used to establish the cutoff, and was only used to assess expected values. With the cut-off
of 20 CU, two samples were positive on the QUANTA Flash M2 (MIT3). The mean
concentration was 2.8 CU, and the values ranged from <1.2 to 91.4 CU.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
1. The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
