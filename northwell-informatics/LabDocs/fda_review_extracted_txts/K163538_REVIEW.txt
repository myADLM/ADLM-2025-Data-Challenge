L. Test Principle:
Recombinant cytochrome P450 2D6 (LKM-1) antigen is coated on to paramagnetic beads,
which are stored in the reagent cartridge lyophilized. When the assay cartridge is ready to be
used for the first time, a buffer solution is added to the tube containing the beads, and the
beads are resuspended with the buffer. The reagent cartridge is then loaded onto the BIO-
FLASH instrument.
A patient serum sample is diluted by the instrument using system rinse in a disposable
plastic cuvette. An aliquot of the diluted patient serum, LKM-1 coupled beads, and assay
buffer are combined into a second cuvette, and mixed. This cuvette is incubated at 37°C. The
beads are then magnetized and washed several times. Isoluminol conjugated anti-human
IgG antibody is then added to the cuvette, and incubated at 37°C. Again, the beads are
magnetized and washed repeatedly. The isoluminol conjugate produces a luminescent
reaction when “Trigger” reagents are added to the cuvette. The light produced from this
reaction is measured as Relative Light Units (RLU) by the BIO-FLASH optical system.
RLU values are proportional to the amount of bound isoluminol conjugate, which in turn is
proportional to the amount of anti-LKM-1 antibodies bound to the antigen on the beads.
The QUANTA Flash LKM-1 assay utilizes a predefined lot specific Master Curve that is
uploaded into the instrument through the reagent cartridge barcode. Based on the results
obtained by running the Calibrators, an instrument specific Working Curve is created, which
is used by the software to calculate chemiluminescent units (CU) from the RLU value
obtained for each sample.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance: The results presented below were within the sponsor’s pre-
determined acceptance criteria for each study.

The analytical measuring range (AMR) of the assay is 1.6 CU to 400.0 CU. The
linearity of the AMR was evaluated by a study designed according to CLSI EP6-A.
Five serum samples with various anti-LKM-1 antibody concentrations were serially
diluted in analyte free serum to obtain values that cover the AMR. Each dilution was
tested in duplicate. The linear regression analysis with samples falling within the
AMR resulted in the following equation:

Hook effect:
Two high positive samples having anti-LKM-1 antibody concentration above assay
measuring range (743.2 CU and 13,812.8 CU) were examed to assess potential hook
effect. No hook effect was observed up to 13,812.8 CU.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
There is no recognized standard or reference material for anti-LKM-1 antibodies.
Calibrators and controls values are directly traceable to the in-house standards.
Value Assignment:
The QUANTA Flash LKM-1 Calibrators and Controls are manufactured by diluting
human serum that contains high titer of anti-LKM-1 antibodies. The target CU is
achieved through trial dilutions on a small scale. Once a dilution is selected, the
Calibrators and Controls are bulked, tested, and adjusted. Upon completion of the
manufacturing process, the Calibrators and Controls are tested on at least two
instruments, on at least two lots of reagent cartridge, in replicates of five to obtain a
minilum of 10 data points to determine final value assignment. The target values and
ranges for the Calibrators and Controls are listed below:

Stability:
Kit stability (unopened): The accelerated stability study was performed using three
lots of LKM-1 coupled beads, resuspension buffer 7, calibrators, and controls. Real-
time stability is on-going; the results to date support a claim of 12 months stability for
unopened reagent cartridge and up to 6 months on calibrators and controls stored at
2–8°C.
On-board (In-use) stability: On-board stability study was performed for calibrators,
controls and reagent cartridge:
i. Calibrators: Calibrators were placed uncapped, onboard the instrument, and
calibration was performed five times over 9 hours. Controls and a panel of
characterized patient specimens were run on each calibration curve.
ii. Controls: Two vials of each control were assayed once a day for a total of 20 runs.
The first run was used to establish baseline value, and then an additional 19 runs
were performed. During runs, the Controls were left uncapped, onboard the
instrument for 15 minutes per run. When not in use, the controls were capped, and
stored at 5ºC ± 3°C.
iii. Reagent Cartridge: Two lots of cartridges were tested with five serum specimens
(with different reactivity levels) along with the Negative and Positive Controls.
The specimens were tested periodically up to 62 days. Percent recoveries were
calculated compared to the day zero average values, and linear regression analysis
was performed by plotting % recovery against the number of days.
All results met the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria and support the following on-
board stability claims:
Calibrators 8 hours on-board; up to 4 calibrations
Controls Up to 15 uses with 10 min on-board per use
Reagent Cartridge 60 days on-board
Sample stability: The study was performed with four samples (one negative, one
positive, and two around the cut-off), tested at 2–8°C, and room temperature (RT). In
addition, the samples were tested for the stability after up to three repeated
freeze/thaw cycles. The results support sample stability up to 48 hours of storage at
RT, up to 14 days of storage at 2–8°C, and up to three freeze/thaw cycles when

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying four blank samples in five
replicates per sample over three days with two reagent lots. Sixty data points were
generated. LoB was calculated at the 95th percentile using the parametric method, as
the dataset showed non-normal distribution. The LoB of both two lots was below the
measuring range and was determined to be 0.00 CU and 0.14 CU. The claimed LoB
was determined to be 0.14 CU.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by assaying four low-level samples
with anti-LKM-1 antibody concentration tested in five replicates over three days
on two reagent lots (60 replicates per lot). The LoD of the QUANTA Flash LKM-
1 assay for the two lots were below the measuring range and was determined to be 0.24
CU and 0.26 CU. The claimed LoD is 0.26 CU.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined based on the data generated from
the LoD testing with a total error (TE) goal of 25%. The claimed LoQ is 1.6 CU.
e. Analytical specificity:
The interference study was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2 using six
specimens, one high positive (290.9 CU), one moderately positive (124.8 CU), one
low positive (28.9 CU), two near the cutoff (17.0 and 25.1 CU), and one negative
(12.3 CU). Each interfering substance (hemoglobin, conjugated bilirubin,
triglycerides, cholesterol, human IgG and RF IgM) was spiked into every specimen
at three different concentrations in 10% of total specimen volume. Each resulting
sample was assessed in triplicates with the QUANTA Flash LKM-1 assay. Recovery
of the unit values was calculated compared to control samples spiked with the same
volume of diluents. No interference was detected with conjugated bilirubin up to 1
mg/mL, hemoglobin up to 2 mg/mL, triglycerides up to 1000 mg/dL, cholesterol up
to 332.5 mg/dL, human IgG up to 35 mg/mL, and rheumatoid factor IgM up to 153.4
IU/mL.
Additionally, four samples, one negative (2.3 CU), two around the cutoff (19.9 and
21.1 CU) and one low positive (31.1 CU) were tested to assess the interference
caused by corticosteroids (prednisone), azathioprine and interferon alpha by using
the same methodology described above. No interference was detected with
corticosteroids (prednisone) up to 0.3 mg/L, azathioprine up to 2.99 mg/L and
interferon alpha up to 0.33 mg/L.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off was determined using 242 samples from reference subjects as
shown in the table below. The cut-off was established as 20 CU based on the 99th

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Samples for the method comparison analysis included 334 samples from the clinical
validation study, along with additional 10 pooled samples that yield results around the
cut-off. All samples were tested on both the QUANTA Flash LKM-1 and on the
predicate device. Among 334 samples, a total of 119 samples within the assay
measuring ranges of both assays were included in the method comparison analysis.
