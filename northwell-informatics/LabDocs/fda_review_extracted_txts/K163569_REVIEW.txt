I. Device Description:
The Elecsys CMV IgM is a µ-capture immunoassay that uses streptavidin microparticles,
biotinylated recombinant CMV-specific antigen labeled with a ruthenium complex, and
electrochemiluminescence detection. The test system contains human serum-based
calibrators intended for use with the system.
The toal duration of the assay is 18 minutes. The assay steps are as follows:
· During the first incubation, 6 µL of sample are automatically prediluted 1:20 with
diluent (Diluent Universal). Biotinylated monoclonal anti-human IgM specific
antibodies are also added.
· During the second incubation, CMV-specific recombinant antigen labeled with a
ruthenium complex and streptavidin-coated microparticles are added. Anti-CMV IgM
antibodies present in the sample react with the ruthenium-labeled CMV-specific
recombinant antigen. The complex becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction
of biotin with streptavidin.
· The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are
magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then
removed with ProCell II M. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces
chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.
· The analyzer automatically calculates the cutoff based on the measurement of
Calibrator 1 and Calibrator 2. The result of the samples is given either as reactive,
borderline, or non-reactive as well as in the form of a cutoff index (signal of
sample/cutoff)(COI) as shown in Table 1.

L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys CMV IgM immunoassay is based on the m-Capture test format. During the first
incubation step, biotinylated monoclonal anti-h-IgM-specific antibodies binds specifically to
IgM the diluted test specimen. CMV-specific recombinant antigen labeled with a ruthenium
complex and streptavidin-coated microparticles are then added for the second incubation.
Anti-CMV IgM antibodies present in the sample react with the ruthenium-labeled CMV-
specific recombinant antigen. The complex becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction
of biotin with streptavidin. The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where
the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound
substances are then removed with ProCell II M. Application of a voltage to the electrode then
induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the Elecsys CMV IgM assay was evaluated according to CLSI EP05-A3
on one cobas e 801 Immunoassay Analyzer with one reagent lot. Two replicates per
run for each control [PreciControl (PC) CMV IgM, level 1 and 2] and five native
human serum and plasma samples (HSP) from single donors were measured (except
for plasma sample 5 which was pooled). Measurements were performed in 2 runs per
day for 21 days. All results met the pre-defined acceptance criteria and are shown in

d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank: The Limit of Blank (LoB) of the Elecsys CMV IgM assay on the
cobas e 801 Immunoassay Analyzer was determined according to CLSI EP17-A2 as
the 95th percentile of measurements of blank samples. Five blank serum samples were
assayed with two replicates per run for six runs, using three reagent lots on one
instrument, for a total of 60 blank replicates per reagent lot. The LoB was calculated
to be 0.243 COI.
Limit of Detection: The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the Elecsys CMV IgM assay on
the cobas e 801 Immunoassay Analyzer was determined according to CLSI EP17-A2
as the lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be detected with 95%
probability. Five samples were prepared by spiking human serum samples from single
donors with low levels of analyte. The samples were tested with two replicates per
sample per run, six runs, with three reagent lots, on one instrument for a total of 60
replicates per sample per reagent lot. The LoD was calculated to be 0.267 COI using
the following equation: LoD=LoB+1.653 x SD.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interferences: To evaluate the effect of elevated levels of biotin (10 to
100 ng/mL), intralipid (150 to 1500 mg/dL), hemoglobin (50 to 500 mg/dL), and
bilirubin (2 to 20 mg/dL) on the Elecsys CMV IgM assay, four CMV IgM samples
(low negative, low positive, positive, and high positive) were tested on the cobas e
801. The recovery (% COI) was calculated for each sample and compared to the
reference unspiked sample.
Acceptance criteria: Negative/borderline samples (COI<1.0), deviation ± 0.2 COI;
Positive samples (COI ≥ 1.0), deviation ± 20% (Recovery 80-120%).
The results met the acceptance criteria for all concentrations of endogenous
interferent tested. Roche will receive the following claims for no interference
observed at the following concentrations: biotin £100 ng/mL,
intralipid ≤ 1500 mg/dL, hemoglobin £ 500 mg/dL, and bilirubin £ 20 mg/dL.
To evaluate the effect of rheumatoid factor (RF), native high RF samples were diluted
1:1 with RF negative-CMV IgM positive and RF negative-CMV negative samples.
The results of the CMV positive sample diluted with a RF high sample is compared to
a 1:1 dilution of the same CMV sample with RF negative samples with similar total
IGM levels as the RF high sample. Seven samples with a CMV IgM COI from 0.203
to 5.77 were diluted 1:1 with 3 RF high/CMV-IgM negative samples. As a reference,
the sample samples were diluted with RF negative/CMV-IgM negative samples. RF
concentrations of 462 to 899 IU/mL were tested and met the acceptance criteria.
Roche will receive a claim for no interference for RF < 899 IU/mL.
Exogenous Interfering Substances (Drugs): The effect of quantitation of analyte in
the presence of drugs was determined by comparing values obtained from native
7

--- Page 8 ---
human serum and plasma samples from single donors on the cobas e 801. The
samples were spiked with 17 commonly used and 2 special pharmaceutical
compounds and tested on the Elecsys 2010 Immunoassay Analyzer. Acetylcysteine
and phenylbutazone were measured on the cobas e 411 Immunoassay Analyzer. Two
samples negative and positive for CMV IgM were divided into aliquots and spiked
with the potential interferent. The concentration of CMV IgM in the samples was
approximately 0.2 COI and 1.9 (2.4 for acetylcysteine and phenylbutazone)COI. The
CMV IgM concentration of the spiked aliquots was determined in 9-fold
determination and compared to the CMV IgM concentration determined for the
reference aliquot on the Elecsys 2010 and the cobas e 411 Immunoassay Analyzers,
respectively. Acceptance criteria: Negative/borderline samples (COI<1.0), devation
+0.2COI; Positive samples (COI>1.0),deviation +10%. Each compound was found to
be non-interfering at the concentration listed in the Table 3.

g. High-dose hook effect:
Testing with the Elecsys CMV IgM assay on the cobas e 801 demonstrated no high-
dose hook effect. Three naturally positive human serum and plasma samples from
single donors with high CMV IgM concentrations were diluted in a series of 11
dilution steps. Each dilution was tested in singlicate. No high-dose hook effect was
observed up to 18.7 COI.

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ________ or No ____X____
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Barcode
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Input and transport of samples using universal sample racks, modular sample buffer
input, core/transportation unit and STAT port.
5. Calibration:
Calibration must be performed once per reagent lot using fresh reagent (i.e., not more
than 24 hours since the reagent kit was registered on the analyzer. Renered calibration is
recommended after 12 weeks when using the same reagent lot, after 28 days when using
the same cobas e pack on the analyzer, and as required (e.g., quality control finding
outside the defined limits).
6. Quality Control:
Controls should be run individually at least once every 24 hours when the test is in use,
once per cobas e pack, and following each calibration. Values should fall within the
defined limits. Each laboratory should establish corrective measures to be taken if values
fall outside defined limits.
