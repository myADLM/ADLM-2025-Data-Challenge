H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Carolina Liquid Chemistries Cocaine and Cocaine Metabolite Test System (COCM)
is for the qualitative determination of benzoylecgonine (cocaine metabolite) in human
urine at a cutoff value of 300 ng/mL. The assay is designed for professional use with a
clinical chemistry analyzer. For in vitro diagnostic use only.
This assay provides a rapid screening procedure for determining the presence of
benzoylecgonine in urine. The assay provides only a preliminary analytical result. A
more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas or Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS or LC/MS)
is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical considerations and professional judgment
should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary
test result is positive.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Performance characteristics were determined using the CLC480/Biolis 24i Clinical
Chemistry Analyzer.
I. Device Description:
The Carolina Liquid Chemistries Cocaine and Cocaine Metabolite Test System (COCM) is a
ready-to-use, liquid reagent homogeneous enzyme immunoassay for qualitatively
determining the presence of cocaine metabolite (benzoylecgonine) in human urine. The
COCM R1 Antibody/Substrate Reagent contains mouse monoclonal anti-benzoylecgonine
antibody, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD),
stabilizers, and sodium azide as preservative, and the COCM R2, Enzyme-Drug Conjugate
Reagent contains benzoylecgonine-labeled glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in
buffer with sodium azide as preservative.

L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on competition between benzoylecgonine labeled with the enzyme
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and free drug from the urine sample, for a
fixed amount of antibody. In the absence of free drug from the urine sample, the specific
antibody binds to the drug labeled with G6PDH causing a decrease in enzyme activity. The
G6PDH enzyme activity is determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by measuring its
ability to convert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to NADH.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To evaluate device precision, samples were prepared from negative urine samples
spiked to nine different concentrations (cutoff, and + 25 %, + 50%, + 75%, and
+100% of the cut off concentration 300 ng/dL) and were analyzed in duplicate, twice
per day for 22.5 days to obtain a total of 90 replicates per concentration. Results are
summarized below.

Effect of pH:
To evaluate the effect of urine pH on device performance, negative urine samples
with pH ranging from 3.00 to 11.00 (in increments of 1 pH unit) were spiked with
benzoylecgonine to +25% of the device cutoff. The pH ranges tested did not affect
the results from the device.
Effect of specific gravity:
To evaluate the effect of urine specific gravity on device performance, negative urine
samples with specific gravities ranging from 1.000-1.030 were spiked with
benzoylecgonine to ± 25% of the device cutoff. The specific gravity ranges tested did
not affect the results from the device.
