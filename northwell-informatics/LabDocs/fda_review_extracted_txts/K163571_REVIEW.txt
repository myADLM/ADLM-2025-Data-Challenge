H. Intended Use:
The Great Basin Stool Bacterial Pathogens Panel is a multiplexed, qualitative test for the
detection and identification of DNA targets of enteric bacterial pathogens. The Stool
Bacterial Pathogens Panel detects nucleic acids from:
• Campylobacter (C. coli/C. jejuni)
• Salmonella
• Shiga toxin 1 (stx1)
• Shiga toxin 2 (stx2)
• Escherichia coli serotype O157
• Shigella
Shiga toxin genes are found in Shiga toxin-producing strains of E. coli
(STEC/EHEC/VTEC) and Shigella dysenteriae. The E. coli O157 test result is only reported
if a Shiga toxin gene (stx1 and/or stx2) is also detected.
The Stool Bacterial Pathogens Panel is performed directly from Cary Blair or C&S Medium
preserved stool specimens from symptomatic patients with suspected acute gastroenteritis,
enteritis, or colitis and is performed on the Portrait™ Analyzer.
The test is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of specific agents of gastrointestinal
illness in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information; however, it is not to be
used to monitor these infections. Positive results do not rule out co-infection with other
organisms and may not be the definitive cause of patient illness. Negative test results in the
setting of clinical illness compatible with gastroenteritis may be due to infection by
pathogens that are not detected by this test, or non-infectious causes such as ulcerative
colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or Crohn’s disease. Concomitant culture is necessary if
organism recovery or further typing of bacterial agents is desired.

I. Device Description:
The Great Basin Stool Bacterial Pathogens Panel on the PA500 Portrait™ System utilizes
automated, hot-start PCR amplification technology to amplify specific nucleic acid
sequences that are then detected using hybridization probes immobilized on a modified
silicon chip surface, in a single-use, self-contained test cartridge.
An aliquot of the specimen (stool preserved in stool transport media) is first processed using
the Sample Preparation Device (SPD). An aliquot of the eluate obtained from the SPD is
loaded into the sample port of the SBPP Test Cartridge.
Genomic DNA is extracted from microbial cells and diluted to reduce potential inhibitors of
the PCR. During the PCR process, biotin-labeled primers direct the amplification of specific
nucleic acid sequences within a conserved region for identification of: a bacterial sample
processing control (SPC), Campylobacter coli/Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella spp.,
Shigella spp., Shiga toxin 1, Shiga toxin 2, and E. coli serotype O157.
Following PCR, biotin-labeled, amplified target DNA sequences are hybridized to sequence
specific probes immobilized on the silicon chip surface, and incubated with anti-biotin
antibody conjugated to the horseradish peroxidase enzyme (HRP). The unbound conjugate is
washed away, and tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) is added to produce a colored precipitate at
the location of the probe/target sequence complex. The resulting signal is detected by the
automated Portrait™ Optical Reader within the PA500 Portrait™ Analyzer System. The SPC
undergoes the same extraction, amplification, and detection steps as the sample in order to
monitor for inhibitory substances, as well as process inefficiency due to instrument or reagent
failure. No operator intervention is required once the sample is loaded into the sample port,
and the Stool Bacterial Pathogens Panel cartridge is loaded into the Portrait™ Analyzer.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A Reproducibility Study was conducted at 3 clinical study sites; 2 external and 1
internal. The study incorporated several variables including 6 different operators (2
per site), 70 different Portrait Analyzers and 10 different cartridge lots.
A panel consisting of 7 different samples was tested in triplicate over 5 non-
consecutive days by each operator. Each analyte detected in the Stool Bacterial
Pathogens Panel (SBPP) was included as a low positive (1.5X LoD) and a moderate
positive (3X LoD) in the reproducibility panel. A single negative was also included.
The overall results of the Reproducibility Study are summarized in the table below.
There was ≥ 95% agreement of positive results for analytes that were present in low
concentrations in the samples (1.5X LoD) and 100% agreement of positive results for
analytes present at moderate concentration (3X LoD). There was 100% agreement in
negative results from the negative sample.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
External Controls:
External positive and negative controls are intended to monitor for correct procedural
technique and reagent integrity. External controls are not provided by Great Basin.
· External Controls should be treated as if they are patient specimens.
· The External Negative Control is intended to detect reagent or environmental
contamination by target nucleic acids.
· All External Controls should yield the expected results, with no internal control
failures (INVALID results).
· The following External Control materials are recommended to allow the user to
choose the most appropriate controls for the lab’s Quality Control Plan:
External Negative Control may be any of the following:
- an aliquot of pure Cary Blair or C&S media
- a fresh (never frozen), previously characterized sample known to be negative
for all assay targets
- a frozen, raw stool specimen that has been thawed and then preserved and
known to be negative for all assay targets
External Positive Control: commercially-available ATCC strains for all assay
targets are available, and may be pooled and diluted in stool preservation media
and processed as a patient specimen.
Specimen Processing Control (SPC):
The SPC controls for all analytical steps in the procedure, including DNA extraction,
PCR amplification of target DNA sequences, hybridization, and detection on the chip
surface. The SPC consists of B. subtilis cells lyophilized directly onto the frit of the
SPD, and is processed along with the stool sample. The SPC detects inhibition of
PCR reactions, ensuring the reaction conditions are appropriate and that the
amplification reagents are functional. The SPC signal should be ”Detected” in a
sample in which target sequences were ”Not Detected“ for all Stool Bacterial
Pathogens Panel targets, and can be ”Detected“ or ”Not Detected” in samples for
which at least one target sequence of the SBPP was ”Detected“.

Specimen Stability:
The recommended storage time and temperature conditions for Cary-Blair or C&S
preserved stool specimens, prior to testing via the SBPP are as follows:
• Refrigerated storage (2°- 8° C) for up to 120 hours (5 days)
• Room temperature (RT) (20°-25°C) storage for up to 2 hours
• The combination of 2-hour storage at room temperature (20º-25ºC) followed by
refrigerated storage for up to 120 hours.
To assess the stability of the SBPP nucleic acid targets under the recommended
storage conditions, a Specimen Stability Study was conducted to evaluate each
suggested time and temperature condition. The Specimen Stability Study tested 8
strains for which the LoD was experimentally measured:
• Campylobacter coli (ATCC 43486)
• Campylobacter jejuni (ATCC 49943)
• Escherichia coli (ATCC BAA-2196, stx1+/stx2+/non-O157)
• Escherichia coli (ATCC 43895, stx1+/stx2+/O157+)
• Salmonella bongori (ATCC 43975)
• Salmonella enterica (ATCC 13311)
• Shigella flexneri (ATCC 25929)
• Shigella sonnei (ATCC 29930)
The contrived positive samples were prepared by spiking fresh cultures of each
organism into similar pooled, preserved, clinical negative stool matrix. The results of
the specimen stability study support the recommended storage time and temperature
conditions for Cary-Blair or C&S preserved stool specimens Results are summarized
in the tables below:

stability after the third freeze/thaw is important because generation of a Frozen
Retrospective panel from archived clinical specimens requires a two freeze thaws prior
to shipment to clinical sites. Clinical sites will perform the third thawing of archived
specimens prior to testing. Samples tested in the Reproducibility Study were subjected
to two freeze/thaws.
Contrived positive samples for the Fresh vs. Frozen Study were prepared with fresh
bacterial cells spiked into a pooled, preserved, negative, clinical stool. The panel for the
Fresh vs. Frozen Study was comprised of eight (8) SBPP target strains that included:
· Campylobacter coli (ATCC 43486 cadF+)
· Campylobacter jejuni (ATCC 49943 cadF+)
· Escherichia coli (ATCC BAA-2196 stx1+/stx2+/non-O157)
· Escherichia coli (ATCC 43895 stx1+/stx2+/O157+)
· Salmonella bongori (ATCC 43975 invA+)
· Salmonella enterica (ATCC 13311 invA+)
· Shigella flexneri (ATCC 25929 ipaH+)
· Shigella sonnei (ATCC 29930 ipaH+)
The E. coli (ATCC BAA-2196), E. coli (ATCC 43895), S. flexneri (ATCC 25929) and
S. sonnei (ATCC 29930) strains were stable following three (3) freeze thaw cycles at
<1X LoD, 1X LoD, and 5X LoD.
Freeze/thaw had a negative impact on contrived samples spiked with Salmonella
species, S. enterica (ATCC 13311) and S. bongori (ATCC 43975), and the
Campylobacter species, C. coli (ATCC 43486) and C. jejuni (ATCC 49943) .
The results of the Fresh vs. Frozen study are summarized in the tables below.

Media Equivalency:
A Media Equivalency Study was conducted to demonstrate equivalent SBPP performance
in five (5) prevalent stool preservation media types:
• Thermo Scientific™ Remel™ Cary Blair Transport Medium
• Meridian™ Para-Pak Enteric Plus Transport Medium
®
• Meridian™ Para-Pak Culture & Sensitivity (C&S) Medium
®
• Thermo Scientific™ Protocol™ Cary Blair Medium
• Thermo Scientific™ Protocol™ Culture & Sensitivity (C&S) Medium
To generate the unique stool matrices for each media type, raw clinical stool specimens,
that previously tested negative for SBPP targets, were preserved in each preservation
medium, listed above, per the Manufacturer’s instructions. The subsequent stool matrices
were used as the base for contrived positive samples, and the clinical negative sample, for
each media type.
The Media Equivalency Study was designed to demonstrate equivalent SBPP test
performance in the 5 media types, by evaluating eight (8) strains for which LoD was
initially measured. The 8 strains included:
• C. coli (ATCC 43486)
• C. jejuni (ATCC 49443)
• E. coli (ATCC BAA-2196 stx1+/stx2+/non-O157)
• E. coli (ATCC 43895 stx1+/stx2+/O157+)
• S. bongori (ATCC 43975)
• S. enterica (ATCC 13311)
• S. flexneri (ATCC 25929)S. sonnei (ATCC 29930)

All stool transport media tested: Remel™ Cary Blair Transport Medium; Protocol™ Cary
Blair Medium; Protocol™ Culture & Sensitivity (C&S) Medium; Para-Pak® Enteric Plus
Transport Medium; and Para- Pak® Culture & Sensitivity (C&S) Medium, performed as
expected, and each test medium type demonstrated equivalent performance to all other
test media. At 5X LoD, for all strains tested, there was 100% agreement with the
expected results in all five (5) media types. Likewise, at 2X LoD there was ≥95%
agreement with the expected results for all strains tested across all five (5) media types.
Also, as expected, the percent agreement for strains below LoD (<1X LoD) varied from
10% to 90% across these five (5) media types. All the media types tested, therefore, are
compatible with the SBPP Test.

e. Analytical specificity:
The potential for cross-reactivity was evaluated in an Exclusivity Study, by testing
non-target organisms commonly found in stool. The study included 100 organisms
phylogenetically related to targeted organisms as well as other bacteria, fungi/yeast,
parasites, viruses, and human genomic DNA (84 bacterial strains, 3 yeast, 3
parasites, 9 viruses and human genomic DNA). For those isolates that were
classified as Biosafety level III, or unable to be cultured via standard clinical
microbiology techniques, genomic DNA was tested in place of whole organism.
Each non-target organism or nucleic acid was prepared in pooled, preserved,
negative, clinical stool matrix. All bacterial and yeast strains were tested at
concentrations ≥ 1.0x106 CFU/mL. Genomic DNA (gDNA) templates, viral strains,
and parasites, were tested at ≥1 ug/mL, ≥1x106 copies/mL, or ≥1x105 TCID /mL,
50
respectively.
All but one of the organisms shown gave the expected “Not Detected” result
indicating that there was no cross-reactivity in the SBPP. The one exception was
Enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) which was “Detected” in the SBPP. This
cross-reactivity was expected since the gene target used to detect Shigella spp.
(ipaH) is also present EIEC.

Competitive Inhibition:
To evaluate potential for competitive interference in the SBPP, combinations of the
8 SBPP target organisms representative of potential dual infections, were tested.
The organisms included: C. coli (ATCC 43486), C. jejuni (ATCC 49943), E. coli
(ATCC BAA-2196 stx1+/stx2+), E. coli (ATCC 43895 stx1+/stx2+/O157+), S.
bongori (ATCC 43975), S. enterica (ATCC 13311), S. flexneri (ATCC 25929), and
S. sonnei (ATCC 29930). The panels were designed such that one organism of each
bacterial species was present at a low titer (2X LoD) with a second organism
present at a high titer (>106 CFU/mL). The combinations and concentrations tested
along with the study results are shown in the table below.
Competitive inhibition was observed for Salmonella when E. coli
(stx1+/stx2+/O157+) was present at concentrations ≥ 1 x 106 CFU/mL.

Non-microbial Interference:
Potential interference in the SBPP from 19 different substances that are common
stool contaminants, or likely to be present in patients with diarrhea were evaluated
in an Interfering Substances Study. Each substance was added to a positive stool
prepared by adding a single SBPP target organism to pooled, negative, preserved
clinical stool at ≤ 3X LoD. The organisms tested represented each analyte
detected by the SBPP and included: C. coli (ATCC 43486), C. jejuni (ATCC
49943), E. coli (ATCC BAA-2196 stx1+/stx2+), E. coli (ATCC 43895

Microbial Interference:
The potential for cross-reactivity in a mixed infection was evaluated in a
Microbial Interference Study. A panel of non-target gastrointestinal pathogens
commonly encountered in stool was tested in the presence of each of the analytes
detected in the SBPP.
Potentially interfering bacteria/fungi, viruses, and DNA were added at ≥106
CFU/mL, ≥1 x 106 copies/mL, and ≥ 1 µg/mL, respectively, to pooled, negative,
preserved, clinical stool with a single SBPP target analyte added at ≤ 3X LoD. In
total, 21 unique bacterial strains, 2 yeast, 2 parasites, 3 viruses and human
genomic DNA were tested for microbial interference with the 8 SBPP target
strains.

Carryover/Cross-Contamination:
To evaluate potential carry-over/cross-contamination of the SBPP a Carry-over
Study was conducted. Contrived stool samples containing a high concentration of
an analyte were alternated with clinical negative stool samples in 10 consecutive
testing rounds. The high positive sample was generated by adding previously
frozen and quantified enriched broth cultures into pooled negative, preserved,
clinical stool at a final concentration ≥ 1 x 106 CFU/mL. The organisms used in
this study were C. coli (ATCC 43486), E. coli (ATCC 43895
stx1+/stx2+/O157+), S. bongori (ATCC 43975), and S. flexneri (ATCC 25929).
The negative sample was stool from symptomatic patients that previously tested
negative for all SBPP targets.
The alternating pattern of 10 test rounds of high positive and negative samples
were performed in direct succession on 4 different analyzers. In total, 80 SBPP
tests were performed: 40 tests of a high positive sample and 40 tests of a negative
sample. No carry-over or cross contamination was observed in the SBPP.

The clinical evaluation of the SBPP consisted of a prospective and a frozen retrospective
method comparison study. An additional study using selected fresh positive Salmonella
samples was also performed.
The prospective method comparison study was conducted to compare the performance of
the SBPP to standard stool culture-based methods for identification of Campylobacter
jejuni /Campylobacter coli, Escherichia coli serotype O157 Salmonella spp., Shiga toxin 1
Shiga toxin 2, and Shigella spp. The study was conducted at four external, geographically-
diverse U.S. clinical study sites (Midwest, Northeast, Southwest and West) from July,
2016 through November, 2016. The specimens enrolled in the study were excess remnants
of preserved stool samples collected from symptomatic individuals suspected of
gastrointestinal infection that were processed according to routine standard care. A total of
1506 samples were collected for all four sites combined. Subsequent to enrollment, 24
samples were excluded from the data set leaving 1479 samples included in the analysis.
In addition, frozen archived de-identified specimens that were previously characterized as
positive or negative by the standard of care method used at the institution (historical
result) were obtained. The historical result for each sample was first confirmed by an FDA
cleared Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) prior to enrolling the sample in the
study. A total of 150 frozen samples were included in the panel. The SBPP results were
compared to the historical result.
To further increase the number of positive Salmonella samples evaluated, additional fresh
samples selected as positive by the standard of care method used by that site were
collected and tested.
The positive (PPA) and negative (NPA) percent agreement for each of the three studies
(Prospective Study - all sites combined, Frozen Retrospective Sample study and Selected
Salmonella study) along with the 95% Confidence Intervals are shown in table below.

b. Clinical specificity: See M3a.
4. Clinical cut-off: N/A
5. Expected values/Reference range:
In the SBPP clinical study, 1479 prospectively collected fresh specimens which were
obtained from four geographically distributed U.S. healthcare institutions (Midwest,
Northeast, Southwest, West) were included in the method comparison study. The number
and percentage of positive SBPP results for each analyte (overall prevalence rate) are
shown in below. The prevalence rate obtained in routine use may vary depending on the
institution, geographic location and patient population.
