H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The ARIES Bordetella Assay is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based
qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the direct detection and identification of Bordetella
pertussis (B. pertussis) and Bordetella parapertussis (B. parapertussis) nucleic acid in
nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens obtained from individuals suspected of having a
respiratory tract infection attributable to B. pertussis or B. parapertussis. The ARIES
Bordetella Assay targets the B. pertussis toxin promoter and the B. parapertussis IS1001
insertion element in the genomes. When clinical factors suggest that B. pertussis or B.
parapertussis may not be the cause of respiratory infection, other clinically appropriate
investigation(s) should be carried out in accordance with published guidelines.
Negative results for the ARIES Bordetella Assay do not preclude B. pertussis or B.
parapertussis infection and positive results do not rule out co-infections with other
respiratory pathogens. The direct detection and identification of B. pertussis and B.
parapertussis nucleic acids from symptomatic patients aids in the diagnosis of B.
pertussis and B. parapertussis respiratory infection in conjunction with other clinical
findings and epidemiological information.
The ARIES Bordetella Assay is indicated for use with the ARIES Systems.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use.

I. Device Description:
The ARIES Bordetella Assay is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based qualitative in vitro
diagnostic test system that consists of the ARIES System or the ARIES M1 System with their
included ARIES Software, an assay-specific cassette, and an assayspecific protocol file. The
ARIES Bordetella Assay cassette is a disposable, single-use cassette containing nucleic acid
2

--- Page 3 ---
purification reagents, internal sample process control (SPC), and an assay-specific master
mix capable of performing the designated assay on one sample. The ARIES Bordetella Assay
cassette directly detects and identifies B. pertussis and B. parapertussis DNA from
nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens collected from the human nasopharynx region.
Nasopharyngeal swab specimens are collected from patients using a commercially available
nasopharyngeal swab placed into transport media (i.e. Universal Transport Media (UTM),
ESwab, M5, M6). The specimen is then transported to the laboratory for testing. The
specimen is lysed and nucleic acid is extracted using the ARIES system. The ARIES system
subsequently performs PCR amplification of target sequences, and assay fluorescence is
monitored via distinct fluorophore labels on primer pairs. As the reaction is slowly heated the
fluorescent-quencher labeled strands separate, and a maximum fluorescence is observed. The
instrument fluorescence output is analyzed, and test results are determined using the ARIES
System software and the ARIES Bordetella Assay protocol and run files.

L. Test Principle:
The ARIES Bordetella Assay chemistry is based on an expanded genetic alphabet
technology, consisting of synthetic DNA base pair—2'-deoxy-5-methyl-isocytidine (iC):2'-
deoxyisoguanosine (iG). The isobases (iC and iG) pair specifically with each other and not
with natural nucleotides. In addition, isobases are efficiently incorporated during PCR.
During PCR amplification, a quencher-modified iGTP is incorporated by the polymerase
opposite an iC and a fluorophore reporter attached to a PCR primer. If the target is present
and is amplified, assay fluorescence decreases with every cycle as amplification product
accumulates. The decrease in assay fluorescence is monitored in real time using the ARIES
Systems. Following PCR, the amplification products are thermally denatured and assay
fluorescence is monitored. The strands of the amplification products are separated and assay
fluorescence increases, thus enabling determination of the melting temperature (Tm) of the
amplicon.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
For all precision and reproducibility studies where the concentration of the Bordetella
targets are varied, low positive (LP) is 1.5x LoD, and moderate positive (MP) is 5x
LoD.
Inter-site reproducibility of the ARIES Bordetella Assay was evaluated by testing one
lot of ARIES Bordetella Assay Cassettes on two ARIES Systems at each of three
sites—2 external clinical and 1 internal. The results are shown in Table 1. A blinded
and randomized reproducibility panel was prepared and sent to the sites that consisted
of B. pertussis low positive, B. pertussis moderate positive, B. parapertussis low
positive, B. parapertussis moderate positive, and B. pertussis and B. parapertussis

One replicate of Low Positive (1.5x LoD) B. pertussis correctly identified B. pertussis
as expected, but also yielded a false positive B. parapertussis with late Ct (~39
cycles). Note that the expected results for a Moderate Positive target was 100%

Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility of the ARIES Bordetella Assay was evaluated by one
operator using one ARIES instrument to test 3 lots of the assay cassettes. A
reproducibility panel consisting of B. pertussis low positive, B. pertussis moderate
positive, B. parapertussis low positive, B. parapertussis moderate positive, and B.
pertussis and B. parapertussis negative sample diluted into the negative natural
nasopharyngeal matrix were prepared and tested to evaluate the lot-to-lot
reproducibility. Three replicates of each sample concentration were run five times (15
total replicates) for each lot of the ARIES Bordetella cassette. The identity of these
samples was blinded to the operator. The test results shown in Table 2 indicated that
the reproducibility demonstrated across the 3 Bordetella cassette lots was according
to what was expected for moderate positive samples (100% positive), low positive
samples (≥ 95% positive), and negative samples (100% negative).

evaluated by testing B. pertussis and B. parapertussis samples at various
concentration levels across multiple days utilizing multiple operators, ARIES
systems, and one lot of the ARIES Bordetella Assay cassette. . Samples were blinded
to the operator and tested in triplicate by two operators across 5 non-consecutive
days. The results of the study shown in Table 3, demonstrate repeatability between
multiple operators, using multiple instruments within a laboratory run across multiple
days and range of Bordetella concentrations.

Stability:
Fresh Specimen Stability: Fresh specimen stability was determined using samples
of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis independently diluted into pooled natural
negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix at 3x LoD. These samples were
aliquoted and stored at both ambient (18-25°C) and refrigerated (2-8°C)
temperatures and tested in triplicate at multiple time points using the ARIES
Bordetella Assay (total of 15 samples for each storage condition type). The samples
stored at ambient temperature (18 to 25°C) were evaluated for stability up to 8
hours, with testing at multiple intervals between 0 and 8 hours plus an additional
time point past 8 hours. The samples stored refrigerated (2 to 8°C) were evaluated
for stability up to 7 days, with testing at multiple intervals between 0 and 7 days
plus an additional time point past 7 days.
The results of testing are shown in Table 4, and indicated that fresh clinical
specimens for the ARIES Bordetella Assay are stable for up to 8 hours when stored at
18-25°C and up to 7 days when stored at 2-8°C. Note that there was one Low Positive
B. pertussis sample (8 hour time point) that yielded an invalid result for the ambient
storage condition, and was not repeated.

Fresh vs. Frozen Study: The performance of frozen samples when tested on the
ARIES Bordetella Assay was assessed using contrived Bordetella specimens stored at
-65 to -95°C (frozen). Peformance was established using samples consisting of B.
pertussis and B. parapertussis culture diluted independently into natural negative
human nasopharyngeal swab matrix at three test concentrations. A total of 120
samples were tested for each Bordetella strain;half were tested immediately upon
preparation (fresh) and the remaining samples were frozen and tested 24-48 hours
later. Six replicates of nautral negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix were also
tested fresh and frozen as a negative control. For each set of fresh and frozen samples,

the proportions of samples per concentration were 50% (3x LoD), 25% (10x LoD),
and 25% (100x LoD). No significant difference in performance of ARIES Bordetella
Assay was observed between fresh or frozen samples.
Frozen Specimen Stability: Frozen specimen stability was determined using
contrived samples of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis independently diluted into
pooled natural negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix at 3x LoD for the strain,
and a negative sample. Stability testing of the frozen specimens was conducted for up
to 6 months. Samples were aliquoted and stored at -65 to -95°C, tested in triplicate at
multiple time points using the ARIES Bordetella Assay. Study results indicated that
clinical specimens for the ARIES Bordetella Assay are stable for up to 5 months
when stored at -65 to -95°C.
Shelf-life Stability:
Reagent stability was assessed by testing 3 replicates of Bordetella Extractable
Control, 100x LoD Blend and 3 replicates of negative targets (Copan UTM) on three
different lots of ARIES Bordetella cassettes stored at 4°C (2-8°C) and room
temperature (15-30°C). The study was according to guidelines in EP25-A, Evaluation
of Stability of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents; Approved Guideline and BS EN ISO
23640: 2013-In vitro diagnostic medical devices–Evaluation of stability of in vitro
diagnostic reagents. Acceptance criteria was set to 100% positivity for all Bordetella
replicates and 100% negativity for all negative replicates. Data was collected for 7
months and indicated stability up to 7 months.
Controls:
Each ARIES Bordetella Assay cassette contains a Sample Process Control (SPC),
which is processed with the sample and analyzed during each run. The SPC verifies
sample lysis, nucleic acid extraction, and proper performance of the ARIES System’s
assay protocol and test components. The SPC has known Tm and Ct values. With
each assay run, the system measures the SPC temperature and fluorescence intensity
to ensure the thermal and optical subsystems are within the specifications.
The ARIES Bordetella Assay Cassette Kit does not include external positive and
negative controls. External controls should be tested according to guidelines or
requirements of local, provincial, federal, and/or accreditation organizations.
Reference strains or well characterized clinical isolates of B. pertussis and B.
parapertussis may be used as positive controls.
d. Detection limit:
A Limit of Detection (LoD) study was performed to establish the analytical
sensitivity of the ARIES Bordetella Assay. Serially diluted suspensions from
quantified cultures of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis each in natural negative
9

--- Page 10 ---
nasopharyngeal (NP) swab matrix were used to determine preliminary LoD
concentrations. These preliminary LoD concentrations were confirmed by testing
twenty (20) replicates of each strain. All Bordetella strain concentrations were
verified by plating and colony counts (CFU/mL). The LoD for each Bordetella strain
was determined as the lowest concentration that generated a positivity rate of ≥ 95%.
The analytical LoD was confirmed using the final assay protocol file parameters (i.e.
cut-off values). The final LoD concentrations for the four strains of Bordetella are
shown in Table 5 below. The overall assay LoD for B. pertussis is 1800 CFU/mL and
B. parapertussis is 213 CFU/mL.

e. Inclusivity:
The ability of the ARIES Bordetella Assay to detect multiple strains of B. pertussis
and B. parapertussis was evaluated in analytical reactivity (inclusivity) studies.
Eighteen (18) Bordetella strains; eleven (11) B. pertussis and seven (7) B.
parapertussis strains which were not tested in the LoD studies were used to establish
inclusivity. . The specimens were prepared by diluting cultured organism into pooled
natural negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix at a concentration of 3x LoD,
and tested in triplicate.
In summary, all seven strains of B. parapertussis were detected with 100% positivity
(3x LoD). Nine of the eleven B. pertussis strains were detected with 100% positivity
(3x LoD). Two of the eleven B. pertussis strains (ATCC 8478 and ATCC 9797), were
not detected at either 3x, 10x, or 100x LoD. Sequencing of these two strains revealed
a similar nucleotide mismatch in both ARIES B. pertussis forward and reverse primer
binding regions, and is believed to have impacted the reactivity of the assay. An in
silico search of B. pertussis sequences in the NCBI database indicated a low number
(2.9%) of strains with similar mismatches.
The results of the inclusivity testing are shown below for B. parapertussis and B.
pertussis respectively:

Three replicates each of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis were tested at
concentrations near the assay LoD with a relatively high concentration of each non-
microbial substance spiked into the contrived sample. Additionally, negative natural
human nasopharyngeal swab matrix was spiked with the same concentration of each
non-microbial substance and tested for assay interference.
B. pertussis and B. parapertussis samples were contrived by independently diluting
cultures into natural negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix at a concentration
of 3x LoD for the strain tested.

· Cause infections that might present similar symptoms to B. pertussis and B.
parapertussis infections
· Were previously determined to potentially interfere with the diagnostic
performance of the ARIES Bordetella Assay
Bacteria were tested at ≥106 CFU/mL or the highest available concentration, and
viruses were tested at ≥105 TCID /mL or the highest available concentration. These
50
potential cross reactive organisms were spiked at high concentration into natural
negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix and tested in triplicate on the ARIES
System. In addition to the aforementioned 65 microorganisms, multiple strains of
Bordetella bronchiseptica and Bordetella holmesii were also tested for cross-
reactivity for a total of 71 microorganisms evaluated. Of the 71 microorganisms
tested, 66 yielded negative results for B. pertussis and B. parapertussis and thus are
considered non-reactive with the ARIES Bordetella Assay. Five organisms,
Fusobacterium necrophorum, Human Coronavirus OC43, Influenza B, Moraxella
catarrhalis and Proteus vulgaris each generated a false positive result in 1 out of 6
replicates.
MICROBIAL INTERFERENCE
Microbial interference for the ARIES Bordetella Assay was established by testing 65
unique potentially cross reactive microorganisms (CRO) that are commonly found in
the nasopharynxand cause infections that might cause similar symptoms to B.
pertussis and or B. parapertussis. Bacteria were tested at ≥106 CFU/mL or the highest
available concentration, and viruses were tested at ≥105 TCID50/mL or the highest
available concentration. The potential cross-reactive organisms (CROs) were spiked
into natural negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix containing representative
strains of Bordetella pertussis (BP) or Bordetella parapertussis (BPP). The
concentration of the B. pertussis and B. parapertussis targets were prepared at 3x
LoD. All target strain + CRO samples were tested in triplicate (n=3) on the ARIES
System. Three replicates each of 3x LoD target with no cross-reactive organism
spiked, and natural negative matrix were tested as controls. In addition to the 65
unique microorganisms, multiple strains of Bordetella bronchiseptica and Bordetella
holmesii were also tested for microbial interference.
Microbial interference was also evaluated in a co-infection setting where lower (3x
LoD) concentration B. pertussis was tested with high concentration (100x LoD) of B.
parapertussis and vice-versa. The high/low combinations of B. pertussis and B.
parapertussis were tested as part of the microbial interference study (Table 9). An
overall invalid rate of 0.9% (7/744) was observed during the execution of the
microbial interference and cross reactivity study. All invalids were re-run and gave
the expected call.
All potential CROs when tested with negative matrix as no template controls (NTCs)
gave the expected result of B. pertussis NEGATIVE and B. parapertussis
13

--- Page 14 ---
NEGATIVE during testing. Five CROs (Fusobacterium necrophorum, Human
Coronavirus OC43, Influenza B, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Proteus vulgaris) yielded
a false positive in 1/3 replicates with late Ct’s but yielded NEGATIVE for all 3
replicates in repeat testing.
All potential CROs when tested with the B. pertussis matrix gave the expected result
of B. pertussis POSITIVE. A total of 9 CROs were tested twice in triplicate for a total
of 6 replicates. Four CROs (Bordetella bronchiseptica (strain 1), Bordetella petrii,
Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia) yielded a false negative in 1/6
replicates and five CROs (Acientobacter Iwoffii, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum,
Bordetella holmesii (strain 3), Coxsackievirus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa)
yielded a false positive for B. parapertussis in 1/6 replicates when tested in a B.
pertussis matrix.
All potential CROs when tested with the B. parapertussis matrix gave the expected
result of B. parapertussis POSITIVE. B. bronchiseptica at high concentration of 108
CFU/mL, showed some interference in the ability to detect low concentrations of B.
pertussis and B. parapertussis. However, no interference was observed at 106
CFU/mL.

testing yielded the same outcome. After concentration of the CRO was reduced to 106 CFU/mL, expected positivity
was achieved. Data is shown for the reduced CRO concentration.
d Initial testing of 3 replicates resulted in a false positive for B. parapertussis. Subsequent repeat testing yielded
the same outcome. After concentration of the CRO was reduced to 106 CFU/mL, expected positivity was
achieved. Data is shown for the reduced CRO concentration.
In addition to the high/low combinations of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis tested,
additional combinations of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis were evaluated (i.e.
low/low and high/high combinations respectively). All replicates in all combinations
yielded expected positivity for B. pertussis and B. parapertussis (Table 10).

g. Cross-contamination:
Carry-over and cross contamination for the ARIES Bordetella Assay was evaluated by
using thirty high positive (1x106 CFU/mL) Bordetella pertussis samples in series
alternating with thirty Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis negative
(pooled natural negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix) samples. These samples
were tested in an alternating series for a total of 5 consecutive runs using one ARIES
system.
All samples gave the expected results of 100% positivity for positive samples and
100% negative for negative samples. No INVALIDS were observed from the study.
h. Assay cut-off:
Each target in the ARIES Bordetella assay (B. pertussis and B. parapertussis) has a Ct
cut-off, Tm window, and Tm Peak Threshold. In addition, the internal sample process
control (SPC) also has a corresponding Ct cut-off, Tm window, and Tm Peak
Threshold. Collectively, the cut-off values compose the assay protocol file parameters,
which are used to determine the assay result for the detection target as POSITIVE,
NEGATIVE, or INVALID. The Assay Protocol File parameters were determined, and
their performance in the ARIES Bordetella Assay were evaluated according to the
following general procedure:
· Initial Assay Protocol File parameters were set during internal optimization studies
· The final Assay Protocol File parameters were then established during internal
verification studies
· The selected Assay Protocol File parameter values were utilized in the
determination of assay performance in the multi-site clinical trial conducted for the

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
The compatibility of four collection media—UTM, M5, M6 and ESwab, were
evaluated with the ARIES Bordetella Assay using two strains each of B. pertussis and
B. parapertussis. Each strain of Bordetella was independently diluted in the media at
a concentration of 3x LoD of the ARIES Bordetella Assay for that strain. The study
was performed with 20 replicates for each media type and each strain of Bordetella,
and 3 replicates for each media type by itself as the negative control.
All media evaluated generated 100% positive results for B. pertussis and B.
parapertussis with the exception of UTM, which generated a 95% positive result for
one strain of B. pertussis. However, the results met the evaluation criteria of at least
95% positivity for all targets. The negative sample gave a result of 100% negative for
both Bordetella targets with 100% detection of the DNA SPC target. An overall
invalid rate of 1.2% (4/336) was observed during this study.
Evaluation of mean Ct and mean Tm values indicated no trends in performance
between the different types of collection media. The average Ct for B. pertussis and B.
parapertussis among all media was very similar, and within ~1 cycle of each other.
The study results demonstrate that these collection media, UTM, M5, M6 and ESwab
perform similarly when used with the ARIES Bordetella Assay.
The nasopharyngeal swab equivalency study was executed using one strain each of B.
pertussis and B. parapertussis applied independently to three different
nasopharyngeal swab types (flocked, rayon, and polyester).
Results generated showed that all swab types gave the expected results of 100%
positivity for B. pertussis and B. parapertussis. The negative sample also gave the
expected results of 100% negative for both Bordetella targets with 100% detection
of the DNA SPC target. An overall invalid rate of 0% (0/69) was observed during
this study.
Evaluation of mean Ct and mean Tm values indicated no trends in performance
between the different types of nasopharyngeal swab types. The average Ct for B.
pertussis and B. parapertussis across all swab types was very similar and within ~1
Ct of each other and the positive control. The study results demonstrated that these
collection swabs performed similarly when used with the ARIES Bordetella assay.

3. Clinical Performance:
A clinical evaluation was conducted (Table 11) to determine the diagnostic performance
of the ARIES Bordetella Assay in nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from
subjects with clinical signs and symptoms consistent with B. pertussis and B.
parapertussis infection. The clinical and contrived specimens were assayed at the testing
sites, following the sponsor’s instructions. Upon completion of the ARIES Bordetella
Assay runs, the clinical study results were reviewed by the sponsor, and the data
management group conducted final analyses.

bAll prospective specimens collected at Site 06 were sent frozen on dry-ice to Site 01 for
ARIES Bordetella Assay testing
In order to ensure that the study was statistically powered, a sufficient number of
prospectively collected specimens were included in order to achieve at least 95%
sensitivity with a lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI greater than 85%. Based on an
estimated B. pertussis prevalence of approximately ~5% in the intended use population, it
was anticpated that the inclusion of 1000 specimens would be sufficient in order to obtain
at least 50 positive specimens for determining Positive Percent Agreement.
SAMPLE PROCESSING AND STORAGE
All prospective clinical specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs in Universal Transport Media)
were submitted fresh to the institutions’ clinical laboratories and were processed
according to their standard procedures. The time from specimen collection to receipt at
the clinical laboratories was kept to a minimum (<24 hours). Upon receipt at the
laboratory, any left-over specimen that met the study inclusion/exclusion criteria was
blinded and assigned a unique clinical study specimen number by an individual at the site
who was not directly involved in the study.
Multiple aliquots of the fresh left-over specimen were then generated and placed into
sterile, leak-proof containers. All specimens were tested within the validated specimen
stability parameters. Table 12 shows a summary of the specimen processing:

The performance of the ARIES Bordetella Assay was established using a composite
comparator assay consisting of 2 well-characterized real time-PCR assays (for each
bacterial pathogen) followed by confirmation of positive PCR amplification product with
bi-directional sequencing. The comparator PCR assays for B. pertussis and B.
parapertussis targeted unique sequences (i.e. different from those targeted by the ARIES
Bordetella assay) within the promoter region of the ptxA (toxin promoter) and IS1001
insertion region, respectively.
Specimens were characterized as positive for B. pertussis or B. parapertussis if both
comparator PCR assays were positive (Ct values ≤40) or if one of the validated real time-
PCR assays was positive and a third PCR/sequencing combination assay was positive.
Specimens were characterized as B. pertussis or B. parapertussis negative if both
comparator PCR assays were negative (Ct ≥ 40).
Comparator testing was performed at an internal testing facility on all clinical specimens
that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Clinical runs and re-runs with the ARIES
Bordetella Assay were conducted by trained operators at the 4 testing sites (see above
table of Participating Investigators and Investigative Sites) on specimens stored
refrigerated at 2-8°C (up to 72hrs) prior to testing (N=667;63.4%) or stored frozen at -65

RESULTS
The clinical study results are as follows—
Arm 1: Blinded, Prospectively Collected Specimens
Performance of the ARIES Bordetella Assay for B. pertussis and B. parapertussis was
established using prospectively collected (from 27-July through 08-November 2016), de-
identified, left-over nasopharyngeal swab specimens in Universal Transport Media
accrued at 5 clinical sites. ARIES Bordetella Assay testing was performed by trained
operators at each of the collection sites with the exception of one site (Site 06). All
clinical specimens accrued at Site 06 during the enrollment period were sent frozen on
dry-ice to Site 01 for ARIES testing.
A total of 1053 left-over clinical specimens from pediatric and adult subjects were
collected at five (5) US clinical sites and included in the study. A single specimen was
obtained per subject and a single measurement was taken per specimen (excluding
allowable re-runs).
A summary of sample accrual per participating site is as follows (Table 13):
Table 13: Specimen Accrual Per Site

Site 03 124 11.8%
Site 05 25 2.4%
Site 06 340 32.3%
Total 1053 100.0%
Of these 1053 specimens, one specimen (Sample ID #02-192) was kept refrigerated (2°C-
8°C) for more than 72 hours before being tested by the ARIES Bordetella Assay and was
therefore excluded from testing. The remaining 1052 clinical specimens were used for
subsequent analysis of the prospective clinical data set.
A summary of the general demographic information of the 1052 prospectively collected
nasopharyngeal swabs included in the analysis is provided as follows (Table 14):

Out of the 1052 clinical specimens included in the prospective study analysis, 1043
(99.1%) clinical specimens in the prospective study generated valid ARIES Bordetella
Assay results (i.e. positive or negative) on the first attempt. There were 9 specimens
(9/1052; 0.9%) that were retested with the ARIES Bordetella Assay because they yielded
INVALID results in the intial run (N=3) or because of an instrument error (N=6). All
nine specimens generated valid ARIES results upon repeat testing.

A supplemental analysis of the results by specimen state (i.e. fresh vs. frozen) was also
performed. Clinical performance of the ARIES Bordetella Assay (after allowable re-runs)
based on specimen state were as follows—the ARIES Bordetella Assay Positive Percent
Agreement (PPA) for B. pertussis and B. parapertussis prospective, fresh specimens was
reported to be 93.3% (14/15; lower bound 95% CI of 68.1%) and 100% (1/1; lower
bound 95% CI of 2.5%), respectively. The Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) for B.
pertussis and B. parapertussis prospective, fresh specimens was reported to be 98.8%
(644/652; LB 95% CI of 9.6%) and 99.7% (664/666; LB 95% CI of 98.9%), respectively.
The ARIES Bordetella Assay Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) for B. pertussis and B.
parapertussis prospective, frozen specimens was reported to be 94.1% (16/17; lower
bound 95% CI of 71.3%) and 100% (1/1; lower bound 95% CI of 2.5%), respectively.
The Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) for B. pertussis and B. parapertussis
prospective, frozen specimens was reported to be 99.2% (365/368; LB 95% CI of 97.6%)
and 100% (384/384; LB 95% CI of 99.0%), respectively.
Arm 2: Blinded, Pre-selected Specimens
Because both B. pertussis and B. parapertussis are low prevalence analytes in the
prospective study cohort, banked (pre-selected) positive specimens were collected at
selected sites. Pre-selected specimens were characterized by the same comparator method
as that used in the prospective study. In order to minimize bias, pre-selected specimens
were tested along with an equal number of unique negative clinical specimens in a
randomized, blinded fashion at three (3) testing sites (all of which were external to
Luminex). Results from pre-selected specimens were analyzed separately from those of
the prospective data set.
A total of 57 unique, pre-selected, de-identified, B. pertussis and B. parapertussis
positive nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from pediatric and adult
subjects. A total of 37 B. pertussis positive specimens were obtained from 6 collection
sites in the United States and 20 B. parapertussis positive specimens were collected at 3
sites in the United States.

All pre-selected B. pertussis and B. parapertussis positive specimens were previously
characterized using the method routinely used at the collection site. The expected result
for each of the pre-selected specimens was confirmed by comparator real-time PCR and
bi-directional sequencing assays. Pre-selected specimens were randomized and blinded
by an individual who was not directly involved in the study. The following table provides
a summary of subject demographic information (i.e. age and gender) from the 57 pre-
selected clinical specimens.

specimens were tested with ARIES Bordetella Assay at one external clinical site, along
with 20 unique negative clinical specimens in a randomized, blinded fashion.
All but 1 of the positive and negative samples included in the pre-selected sample set
generated valid ARIES Bordetella Assay results on the first attempt. The invalid result
(Sample ID #01-198) was resolved upon re-test.

1 One (1) pre-selected specimen generated a false positive result by ARIES Bordetella Assay when compared to the
composite comparator method (Sample #01-122).
Arm 3: Contrived Specimens
Due to the limited number of clinical samples positive for B. parapertussis in the
prospective and pre-selected arm of the study, additional testing was performed using
contrived specimens. Contrived samples were prepared by spiking varying concentrations
of cultured strains into unique negative human nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Two
strains of B. parapertussis (A747 and BAA-587; used in the LoD study were evaluated in
these spiking experiments. A thorough review of the literature was unable to yield
clinically relevant titers for B. parapertussis. Hence, the range was determined based on
the evaluations of the cycle thresholds (Ct) from archived B. parapertussis positive
clinical samples. Based on that evaluation, 10-100x LoD was determined to accurately
represent the clinically relevant range of B. parapertussis samples obtained from
nasopharyngeal swabs.
Fifty (50) contrived specimens spanning the clinically relevant range were prepared with
relevant B. parapertussis strains. Near LoD specimens were prepared at 2-3xLoD while
the remaining specimens were prepared at 10x and 100x LoD concentrations. Bacterial
organism concentrations were verified by culture methods (plating and colony count) and
reported as CFU/mL. In order to minimize bias, contrived specimens were tested along
with an equal number (50) of unique negative specimens in a randomized, blinded
fashion at 3 testing sites as was performed for Arm 2 (pre-selected specimens). The
negative designation for these 50 specimens was confirmed by comparator real-time PCR
assays. A summary of the contrived sample set is as follows:

2. Software:
a. FDA has reviewed the applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types: Yes ______X______ or No ________
b. Level of Concern: Moderate
c. Device Hazard Analysis: Acceptable
The risks associated with the ARIES Systems and Software were reviewed as part
of previous premarket notifications—
· K151917 (ARIES System with ARIES Software)
· K160517 (ARIES System with ARIES Software plus SYNCT Software)
· K161220 (Updated ARIES Software for the ARIES System)
· K161495 (ARIES M1 System with ARIES Software plus SYNCT
Software)
The risks specific to the ARIES Bordetella Assay were also detailed by the firm.
Risks were managed based on the ISO 14971 risk management standard. 7 types
of hazards and 62 possible causes leading to the hazards were identified with the
ARIES Bordetella Assay. Risk evaluation of each of these possible causes related
to each hazard type, identified multiple combinations of hazards and potential
causes. Risk control activities identified 30 methods of control that could be
implemented and applied across multiple combinations of hazards and potential
causes. In all, there were 465 combinations of hazards with possible causes, and
related methods of control. 220 of the 465 were considered ACCEPTABLE in
initial risk estimate by the firm, requiring no further mitigation. 146 had initial
risk estimates that were considered for further risk mitigation.
Mitigation measures were implemented by the firm so that all risks were reduced
to acceptable levels. Mitigation measures included proper labeling and training,
conduct of analytical and clinical studies to determine proper configuration of
assay components (i.e. primer design, cut-off definition, and determination of
parameter configurations) for generating appropriate clinical results,
implementation of sample processing controls, and use of barcoding to specific
the appropriate parameter protocol file.
d. Architecture Design Chart: Acceptable
This was previous reviewed with the ARIES Software as part of premarket
notifications K151917, K160517, and K161495.
e. Software Description: Acceptable
The ARIES Systems include software which manages operations of the
28

--- Page 29 ---
instrument including—
· the manipulation of sample and reagent movement within the assay
cassette,
· control heaters for lysis,
· elution,
· nucleic acid amplification,
· controlling the fluorimeter for real-time PCR bulk fluorescence detection
and melt analysis,
· controlling thermal and optical calibration,
· and performing data analysis for IVD assays run on the system
The software resides entirely on the instrument, a separate PC is not required.
Assay-specific parameters, suchas target-specific Tm and Ct cutoffs, are
communicated to the ARIES software for a specific assay like the ARIES
Bordetella Assay through a protocol file that is provided as part of the specific
assay kit and installed on the ARIES instrument.
Premarket notification K161495 demonstrated that the intended use and
fundamental scientific technology did not change for the ARIES M1 System, and
was substantially equivalent to the ARIES System and included software.
The software interpretation algorithm used to determine test results was coded by
the firm into the protocol file, using the ARIES Assay Protocol Software. The
ARIES Software determined test results for the sample and the sample processing
control (SPC) based on the amplification cycle (Ct) value, the melting
temperature value (Tm), and Tm threshold values as defined in the ARIES
Bordetella Assay Protocol File. The combination of these assay parameters and
the interpretation of the sample results for the ARIES Bordetella Assay are
illustrated as follows:

In brief, if there are any samples that meet the Tm criteria without a
corresponding Ct value (i.e. no valid Ct value) for the corresponding B. pertussis
or B. parapertussis target, then the result is INVALID. Further, if a Ct value for
both targets has exceeded threshold but the Tm criteria is met, but the SPC does
not have a valid Ct value then the result is INVALID. Both the Tm and Ct criteria
must be met for the corresponding B. pertussis or B. parapertussis target for a
positive call for the respective organism. All negative specimens for B. pertussis
and B. parapertussis must have a positive internal sample processing control
(SPC). If the SPC is negative, the result is INVALID.

l. Off the Shelf Software (OTS)/Software of Unknown Pedigree (SOUP):
Acceptable
m. EMC Testing and Standards: Acceptable
3. Specimen Identification:
Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens collected from the human nasopharynx region.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Nasopharyngeal swab specimens are collected from patients using a commercially
available E-Swab (Nylon Flocked Swab along with modified Liquid Amies) or a
commercially available nasopharyngeal swab (i.e. rayon, flocked, nylon, plastic shaft,
etc.) placed into an approved transport media (i.e. UTM, M5, M6, or equivalent). NPS
swab specimens are transported to the laboratory for testing. The specimen is lysed and
nucleic acid is extracted using an ARIES System.
5. Calibration:
The SPC has known Tm and Ct values. During each run, the system measures the SPC
temperature and fluorescence intensity to ensure the thermal and optical subsystems
remain calibrated.
6. Quality Control:
An extractable sample processing control (SPC) target is present in the ARIES Bordetella
Assay cassette and is processed with the specimen. The SPC monitors specimen lysis,
recovery of extracted nucleic acid, for inhibitory substances and for PCR reagent and
instrument integrity.
