OCC – Respiratory Virus Panel Nucleic Acid Assay System
4. Panel:
Microbiology (83)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Idylla Respiratory (IFV-RSV) Panel is an in vitro assay intended for the qualitative
detection of nucleic acids for Influenza A, Influenza A subtype H1, Influenza A subtype
H3, Influenza A subtype 2009 H1, H275Y mutation of Influenza A subtype 2009 H1,
Influenza B and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (A and B) from nasopharyngeal swabs in
viral transport media of adult and pediatric patients. The test uses the Idylla system to aid
in the diagnosis of respiratory viral infection when used in conjunction with other clinical
and laboratory findings.
Negative results do not preclude respiratory virus infection or co-infection with other
viruses and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other patient
management decisions.
Performance characteristics for Influenza A were established when influenza A/2009 H1
and H3 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other Influenza A
viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary. If infection with a novel
Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening
criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with
appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to
state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in
these cases unless a BSL3+ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

I. Device Description:
The Idylla Respiratory Panel is a self-contained molecular in vitro diagnostic test intended to
work with the Idylla System. The assay is performed using a single-use, disposable, multi-
chambered fluidic cartridge. The assay process includes automated sample preparation/
purification, reverse transcription and real-time, multiplex Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR) for the detection of viral RNA. All steps in this process are all fully
automated and completely integrated; results are available in less than 50 minutes.
To perform the assay, a nasopharyngeal (NPS) sample is added to the cartridge lysis pad. The
cartridge lid is then closed and placed in the cartridge tray on the Idylla Instrument. Once the
tray is closed, the test begins automatically. Once started, cartridge manifolds move the
specimen and reagents systematically through the cartridge fluidics from sample lysis,
nucleic acid purification, mixing of PCR reagents, and finally amplification and signal
detection. All amplification, detection of fluorescence, and the interpretation of the signals
are done automatically by the Idylla System. The Idylla Console provides a qualitative result
for the presence (Detected) or absence (Not Detected) for influenza A, influenza B, RSV, and
subtyping information for influenza A positive samples, including H1, H3, 2009 H1, and
H275Y. Results are displayed on the Idylla Console and uploaded to the laboratory
information system.
Interpretation of results:
Each of the amplified targets has a unique type of fluorophore attached to their respective
probe that is cleaved by the exonuclease activity of the Taq polymerase enzyme allowing for
the identification and differentiation of the target viruses. Each gene marker is detected using
fluorescent molecules with different excitation and emission wavelengths. Light generated by
the released fluorophore(s) is captured by a photodetector and is translated into a fluorescent
signal.
Quality Control
The Idylla Respiratory Panel test contains a sample processing control (SPC) in each
cartridge. The SPC checks for adequate sample processing and downstream amplification
and is co-amplified in each reaction chamber to ensure no PCR inhibitors were present in the
sample. A SPC signal is required in every chamber for a “negative” result to be reported. In
the event that no influenza or RSV signal is detected and there is no SPC signal, the cartridge
is “invalid”. In positive samples where target amplification is strong, the SPC is ignored and
the target amplification serves as the ‘control’ to confirm that the sample was not inhibitory
and that assay reagent performance was robust.
Negative and positive controls should be run according to local, state, and federal accrediting
organization requirements.

A reproducibility study of the IFV-RSV was conducted by operators from three sites
using panels of coded specimens containing negative, near the cutoff (C -C ), low

positive (at the limit of detection), and moderate positive (above the limit of detection)
panel analyte samples. Two Operators tested three replicates each twice daily for six days
for a total of 36 tests per site for each panel member at a specific analyte concentration.
Participants tested multiple samples of each panel member on six different days. The
percent agreement with expected results was 100% for all panel members except
influenza B in the moderate positive and low positive test categories (Influenza B low
positive overall agreement was 99.1%). All of the true negative samples (108) generated
negative test results. There were no significant differences observed within run (replicates
tested by one operator), between run (five different days), between sites (three sites), or
between operators (six operators).
The Reproducibility Study site-to-site qualitative results (agreements with expected
results) are presented in the table below.

Specimen Stability
To provide data supporting the specimen storage recommendations stated in the product
package insert, an analytical study was carried out to evaluate specimen stability.
Positive specimens were freshly diluted into a simulated negative background matrix
spiked into VTM to approximate the required target concentrations at a moderate positive
(5x LoD), and tested in replicates of 10 per condition. An additional subset of 10 negative
samples was analyzed per sample per condition. A total of 60 cartridges were tested (30
positive and 30 negative). All specimens were tested with the Idylla System on the day
the samples were prepared. Test conditions for this study were: 0 hours, 2 hours at room
temperature (15-30°C), and 24 hours refrigerated at 2-8°C. Results of the specimen

Fresh versus Frozen Performance Equivalency
This study was performed with contrived positive and negative specimens. A background
matrix was made using negative human donor matrix samples, re-suspended in VTM for
NPS testing. The positive simulated specimens were spiked into VTM media, and serially
diluted to the appropriate panel concentrations. Contrived negative specimens consisted
of simulated background matrix only and were added to VTM. For NP samples,
contrived specimens were tested fresh (at time of serial dilutions) and after 2 freeze/thaw
cycles (2 F/T) for a total of 30 paired tests for the low (2x LoD) concentration panel
members. Each freeze/thaw cycle consisted of a minimum of 48 hours at ≤-70°C,
followed by a thaw at 15-30°C for 1 hour prior to re-freezing or testing. Positive
specimens in the study consisted of a panel of the 3 viral strains, representing the target
viruses. Influenza A 2009 H1N1, Influenza B, and RSVA were selected as representative
markers. Results for testing the low concentration panel members are shown in the table
below.

Shelf Life
Janssen performed a product stability study to generate stability data to support the expiry
assigned to IFV-RSV test kits. Three lots of Idylla cartridges were tested in support of
claimed shelf life. The product lots were tested minimally at Month 0 (QC Release), 6, 7,
12, and 13 months. Testing occurred within 2 weeks of the targeted date. The Idylla
Respiratory (IFV-RSV) Panel is stable when unopened up to 13 months. Janssen intends
to test additional time points to extend the shelf life.
Swab Type Compatibility Study
Janssen performed a swab type validation study to establish which swabs are acceptable
for use with the IFV-RSV assay. Swabs tested in this study include: Puritan HydraFlock
Flocked Swab, Puritan UltraFlock, Copan Flocked Swab; Copan Pediatric Mid Turbinate
Flocked Swab; and Copan Adult Mid Turbinate Flocked Swab. Positive specimens in this
study were freshly prepared. Positive specimens were tested in replicates of 10 per each
specimen (5x LoD) and swab type (n=5); along with negative specimens as controls. A
total of 100 cartridges were tested (50 positive and 50 negative). All specimens were
tested with the Idylla system on the same day as preparation. Agreement at 100% was
demonstrated for both 5x LoD and negative specimens when tested using all Copan and
Puritan flocked swabs tested.

Viral Transport Media Validation Study
Janssen performed a study to determine the validity of commonly used viral transport
media for use with the Idylla Respiratory Panel. Contrived positive specimens consisted
of cultured viral targets diluted into a simulated background matrix (negative matrix).
This background matrix was made using pooled negative human donor swab samples re-
suspended in one of the VTMs. Each pool of negative matrix was tested to confirm the
absence of influenza and RSV prior to the study. All replicates were correctly called
negative in each type of media used. The positive specimens were diluted into the
negative background matrix at a 1000x LoD concentration, then diluted in the appropriate
medium under investigation to approximate the required target concentrations at a
moderate positive (5x LoD). Each panel simultaneously detected FluA, 2009H1, FluB,
and RSVA. The positive specimens were diluted into the negative background matrix
made for each media type and tested in replicates of 10 per each specimen (5x LoD and
Negative) and media (n=6). A total of 120 cartridges were tested (60 positive and 60
negative). All specimens were tested with the Idylla System on the day they were
prepared. Agreement at 100% was demonstrated for both 5x LoD and negative specimens
when tested using Remel media (M4, M4-RT, M5, M6), Copan UTM, and Cepheid

d. Detection limit:
The objective of the Analytical Sensitivity Study was to identify the limit of detection
of the IFV-RSV using characterized strains of each analyte target. The analytical
sensitivity was determined using quantified cultures of 8 Influenza A (2 each of AH1,
AH3, 2009 H1 and 2009 H1 + H275Y Genotype), 2 Influenza B, 2 Respiratory
Syncytial Virus Type A (RSVA), and 2 Respiratory Syncytial Virus Type B (RSVB)
strains serially diluted. The LoD for each strain was defined as the lowest
concentration at which ≥95% of the 20 tested replicates were detected by the system
for each clinical sample type.
Three replicates of each dilution level were tested at 200 μL sample addition. At the
lowest dilution level in which 3/3 replicates were detected, confirmation of LoD for
each target was achieved by testing 20 replicates at this level with minimum reported
“Detected” result in 95% of the cartridges tested (≥19/20) using 200 μL of sample.
For 500 μL sample addition, 3 replicates were analyzed at the equivalent
concentration as determined for LoD with 200 μL sample addition, followed by a
minimum of 2 additional dilutions lower in replicates of 3. If testing of 2-fold
dilutions did not generate a 95% positive result, dilutions that were half-way between
the lowest 100% positive 2-fold dilution and the 2-fold dilution below it were tested
until a dilution testing 95% positive was determined. The empirically determined
LoD for each Influenza and RSV strain is shown in the table below.

e. Analytical reactivity:
An analytical reactivity study was completed to determine whether the Idylla
Respiratory (IFV-RSV) Panel can detect a variety of Influenza A, Influenza B, RSVA
and RSVB strains that represent both temporal and geographic diversity.
The analytical reactivity (inclusivity) of the Idylla Respiratory (IFV-RSV) Panel was
determined using quantified cultures of Influenza A (subtypes H1, H3, H1N12009 +/-
H275Y mutation), Influenza B, RSVA and RSVB strains. The virus was diluted into a
VTM containing a donor swab. Each strain was run in triplicate at 2X LoD using both
sample volumes, 200 μL and 500 μL. Concentrations used for analytical reactivity
(inclusivity) claims were calculated based on the reported LoD. A summary of the
results of the reactivity testing is presented in the table below.

The potentially interfering substances were evaluated in the presence of viral targets
spiked near 2x LoD consisting of Influenza A (all subtypes detected in IFV),
Influenza B and RSV A/B. No evidence of interference caused by these substances
was found.
Each interfering substance was tested in triplicate using VTM samples containing 5x
LoD of each target at a 500 μL sample volume. To create the interferent test sample,
positive simulated specimens were created at 10x LoD, and spiked into VTM media
containing the background matrix. For each interferent, the final concentration was
obtained by combining a 2x concentration of the interfering substance with 250 μL of
the concentrated 10x LoD panel into a final 500 μL volume, resulting in the final 5x
LoD concentration of each analyte and the reported final interferent concentration.
Each interferent was diluted in the VTM sample containing 5x LoD of each target and
tested in triplicate.
h. Competitive Interference:
The competitive interference study evaluated the effects of clinically relevant co-
infections with each of the analytes in the IFV-RST test. The study assessed whether
a high concentration of one virus (3 logs > LoD) in the specimen could potentially
affect the IFV-RSV Panel performance when detecting another target present at low
levels in the multiplex Test (approximately 3x LoD). All testing was performed in
triplicate. The presence of any virus at high copy number and at LoD in the same
Cartridge had no effect on the analytical sensitivity (limit of detection) of the IFV-
RSV Panel.
i. Carry-over:
Not applicable; all test components are single use and no reagents come into contact
with the instrument.
j. Assay cut-off:
The initial assay cutoff was determined by testing a population of known influenza
and respiratory syncytial virus positive and negative samples. A “curve classification”
method was then used (Ct offset settings applied to curve analysis) to analyze each
PCR curve and determine if the target was detected by finding an exponential growth
curve; or else the target was not detected. Next, human experts analyzed each curve in
a blinded setting, with the experts reporting curves as positive or negative. The final
algorithm was designed to maximize the IFV-RSV Panel LoD while maintaining the
assay’s specificity. Clinical samples of known influenza and RSV status (n=204)
were tested to determine the percent agreement to Culture or NAT method. The PPA
and NPA were calculated and the results support that the test correctly identifies the
target analytes.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable. Performance of the IFV-RSV was evaluated against the reference
method in a prospective clinical study.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable.
3. Clinical Studies:
The prospective study consisted of freshly collected specimens obtained during the 2015-
2016 season (n=214) as well as frozen prospective samples collected during previous
seasons (2012-2013 n=494; and 2013-2014 n=306). A total of 1014 prospective samples
were collected for use in the clinical study. Of these 1014 samples, fifteen were excluded
for protocol deviations or lack of a comparator result, leaving 999 specimens. Since
multiple specimen types were collected, not every patient was able to supply all the
specimens intended for the study. For 200 µl NPS specimens in VTM, 986 were available
for testing. For 500 µl NPS specimens in VTM, 956 were available for testing. There
were 26 and 27 QC failures for NPS 200 µl and NP 500 µl specimens, respectively
leaving final evaluable specimens of n=960 (NPS 200 µl) and n=929 (NPS 500 µl). The
invalid rate during the clinical study was 2.9%.

a: Three samples were RSV positive by Idylla but negative by the comparator @ 500 µl.
Sequencing results confirmed one RSV positive and two RSV negative samples.
b: 13 samples were RSV negative @ 500 µl by Idylla and RSV positive by the comparator.
Sequencing results confirmed four samples as RSV negative and nine samples as RSV positive.
A separate study was performed using nasopharyngeal swab specimens from archived
banked retrospective clinical collections tested on the Idylla Respiratory (IFV RSV)
Panel and comparator Assays. Testing of the IFV-RSV Panel was conducted by three
operators on the three Idylla Systems for both 200 µl and 500 µl samples. A total of 419
patient samples were tested at 200 µl with 408 reported results, (invalid rate of 1%) and a

Testing of 40 contrived samples containing Influenza A virus with the H275Y mutation
was performed by introducing the contrived samples into the frozen sample testing
workflow. Each sample returned a positive result by the comparator method for Influenza
A H1 2009 and a negative result for all other targets. These samples were then tested for
the H275Y mutation using a validated bidirectional sequencing assay. Each of these
returned a positive H275Y mutation result from the bidirectional sequencing assay. Using

N. Instrument Name:
Idylla Instrument
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Idylla Respiratory Panel is a self-contained molecular in vitro diagnostic test
designed to work with the Idylla System. The Idylla System consists of the Idylla console
connected to between one and eight Idylla Instruments, and the test cartridge. The Idylla
Instrument’s function is the automated processing of Idylla Test specific cartridges.
Processing is triggered by the user loading a cartridge into the instrument. Upon loading
of a cartridge into the Instrument, the Instrument automatically processes the test specific
cartridges according to the corresponding Test specific software that provides instructions
for processing of PCR fluorescence data into reportable results. The Instrument’s front
panel acts as the Instrument’s user interface. It has a button to open and close the
cartridge tray, and it uses LEDs (indicator lamps) to indicate the status of the Instrument.
