Cobas HbA1c Test: The cobas HbA1c Test is an in vitro diagnostic test designed to
quantitatively determine glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in capillary finger-stick or
venous whole blood, collected in EDTA (K or K ) or lithium heparin tubes, on the cobas
2 3
b 101 instrument. This test is intended for professional use in a clinical laboratory setting
or point-of-care (PoC) locations. This test is not for screening or diagnosis of diabetes or
neonatal use. Measurement of hemoglobin A1c is used to monitor long term blood
glucose control in patients previously diagnosed with diabetes.
Cobas 101 system: The cobas b 101 instrument is a multi-assay system designed to
quantitatively analyze cobas reagent discs. The system is intended for professional, in
vitro diagnostic use in a clinical laboratory setting or point-of-care (PoC) locations.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
· This test is not for screening or diagnosis of diabetes or neonatal use
· For clinical laboratory and point-of care use
· Use fresh whole blood only. Do not use plasma and serum.
· For prescription use only
· The test is not intended for judging day-to-day glucose control and should not be used
to replace daily home testing of urine or blood glucose.
· This test should not be used for analyzing samples from patients with conditions
causing shortened red blood cell survival, such as hemolytic diseases, homozygous
sickle cell trait, pregnancy and significant acute or chronic blood loss
· Glycated HbF is not detected by this assay as it does not contain the glycated beta-
chain that characterize HbA1c, However, HbF levels (>10%) may result in lower than
expected %HbA1c values (DCCT/NGSP).
4. Special instrument requirements:
cobas b 101 system
I. Device Description:
The cobas HbA1c test is an in vitro diagnostic test designed to measure glycated hemoglobin
(HbA1c) in capillary or venous whole blood samples on the cobas b 101 instrument. The
cobas b 101 system is a bench top analyzer which measures HbA1c. The system is fully
automated, self-contained and utilizes a single use reagent disc. The operator applies sample
to the disc and places the disc in the instrument. The disc is self-filling by capillary forces. At
completion of the test, the instrument displays a quantitative result.
The cobas HbA1c Test contains 10 tests. Each test contains:
· Dilution buffer: TRIS (hydroxymethylaminomethane)
· Erythrocyte Hemolysis: Sodium Lauryl Sulfate

L. Test Principle:
The device is based on a latex agglutination inhibition immunoassay. The blood sample is
diluted and mixed with TRIS buffer to release hemoglobin from the erythrocytes. A fraction
of the sample is conveyed into a reaction chamber where it is mixed with sodium lauryl
sulfate (SLS). SLS is used to form the SLS‑hemoglobin complex. The concentration of total

hemoglobin is calculated by measuring SLS‑hemoglobin complex with a wavelength of 525
nm. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in another fraction of the sample is first denaturated by
potassium ferricyanide and sucrose laurate. The denatured HbA1c bonds with HbA1c
antibody on the latex particle. Latex agglutination inhibition reaction then occurs by reacting
the agglutinator that has synthetic antigen which can bond with HbA1c antibody. The
concentration of HbA1c is calculated by measuring the latex agglutination inhibition reaction
with a wavelength of 625 nm. The % hemoglobin A1c value is measured using a ratio of
concentrations of HbA1c to total hemoglobin.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study was evaluated according to CLSI-EP06-A. Linearity was verified
on the cobas b 101 System using 11 dilutions of a low (3.6 % HbA1c) and high (12.9
% HbA1c) K -EDTA whole blood sample. Single measurements on three
2
instruments were performed for every dilution level. The following sample
concentrations were tested: 3.6, 4.8, 6.2, 7.2, 8.2, 9.0, 9.7, 10.7, 11.4, 12.1, and 12.9%
HbA1c. The linearity regression results are in the table below:
NGSP units (%HbA1c):
Slope Intercept Pearson’s R Claimed
Measuring Range
0.996 -0.014 0.9961 4 – 12% HbA1c
The linearity results support the sponsor’s claims that the assay is linear across the
reportable measuring range of 4 to 12% HbA1c.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The cobas HbA1c Test has been standardized against the approved IFCC reference
method for the measurement of hemoglobin A1c in human blood. The cobas b 101
instrument reports values in % hemoglobin A1c traceable to DCCT/NGSP by
calculation. The cobas b 101 is certified with the National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP). The certification expires in one year. See NGSP
website for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
Stability
The shelf life, out-of-pouch and disc warm up stability study protocols and
acceptance criteria for the cobas b 101 HbA1c test system were reviewed and found
to be acceptable to support the sponsor’s following claims:
Shelf life 2-30 °C (36-86 °F) for 16 months
Out-of-pouch use disc within 20 minutes after the pouch is opened.
Disc warm up if the pouch is stored in a refrigerator, remove the pouch but do not
open for at least 20 minutes.
d. Detection limit:
Please see linearity study above in M1b.

e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interference
The effect on quantitation of HbA1c in the presence of endogenous interfering
substances was determined on the cobas b 101 system using the cobas HbA1c Test.
The interference study was performed according to CLSI guideline EP07-A2. The
sample pool material was K -EDTA venous whole blood with a concentration of 4.9-
2
5.5 % HbA1c and 8.6-9.2 % HbA1c.
To achieve the target high concentration interferent pool (high sample pool); pooled
whole blood was spiked with the interferent. Another pool (low sample pool), without
interferent, was created by dilution of the pooled whole blood with the same volume
of diluent as the high sample pool. This pool contains no interferent and serves as the
reference pool for the testing. The high and low sample pools were mixed in different
ratios to yield a dilution series with varying concentrations of the interferent. The
sponsor defined non-significant interference as <±10% deviation compared to the
result of the reference pool. The table below summarizes the results and claims for
the endogenous substances.

Exogenous Interference
The effect on quantitation of HbA1c in the presence of exogenous interfering
substances was determined on the cobas b 101 system with the cobas HbA1c Test.
The interference study was performed according to CLSI guideline EP07-A2. For
each substance, a separate stock solution containing the potentially interfering drug
was prepared. All pools were prepared using K -EDTA venous whole blood with a
2
concentration of 5.1-5.4 % HbA1c and 8.3-9.1 % HbA1c. To achieve the target
concentration drug pool, pooled whole blood was spiked with the drug. Another pool,
without drug, was created by dilution of the pooled whole blood with the same
volume of diluent as the high concentration drug pool. This pool contains no drug and
serves as the reference pool for the testing. Each sample was tested in 5 replicates and

Cross-Reactivity
The effect on quantitation of HbA1c in the presence of potential cross-reactants was
determined on the cobas b 101 system with the cobas HbA1c Test. The study was
performed according to CLSI guideline EP07-A2. Sample pool material was K -
2
EDTA venous whole blood with a concentration of 4.9-5.5 %HbA1c and 8.0- 8.5 %
HbA1c.
Labile A1c interference:
To prepare the high sample pool, pooled whole blood was spiked with glucose. The
low sample pool, without glucose, was created by dilution of the pooled whole blood
with the same volume of diluent as the high sample pool. This pool contains no cross-
reactant and serves as the reference pool for the testing. The high and low sample
pools were mixed in different ratios to yield a 3 level dilution series with the
following concentrations: 1000, 2000 and 3000 mg/dL. Each dilution level was
tested in singlicate on three cobas b 101 instruments. The sponsor defined non-
significant interference as ≤ ± 10% deviation compared to the result of the reference
pool. The study supports the sponsor’s claim of no labile A1c cross-reactivity found
up to 3000 mg/dL.

Carbamylated hemoglobin interference:
To prepare the high sample pool, pooled whole blood was spiked with the cross-
reactant Sodium Cyanate. The low sample pool, without Sodium Cyanate, was
created by dilution of the pooled whole blood with the same volume of diluent as the
high sample pool. This pool contains no cross-reactant and serves as the reference
pool for the testing. The high and low sample pools were mixed in different ratios to
yield a three level dilution series with the following concentrations: 1000, 2000 and
3000 mg/dL. Each dilution level was tested in singlicate on three cobas b 101
instruments. The sponsor defined non-significant interference as ≤ ± 10% deviation
compared to the result of the reference pool. The results support the sponsor’s claim
no carbamylated hemoglobin cross-reactivity was found up to 3000 mg/dL.
Acetylated hemoglobin interference:
To prepare the high sample pool, pooled whole blood was spiked with Acetylsalicylic
Acid. The low sample pool, without Acetylsalicylic Acid, was created by dilution of
the pooled whole blood with the same volume of diluent as the high sample pool.
This pool contains no cross-reactant and serves as the reference pool for the testing.
The high and low sample pools were mixed in different ratios to yield a three level
dilution series with the following concentrations: 1000, 2000 and 3000 mg/dL. Each
dilution level was tested in singlicate on three cobas b 101 instruments. The sponsor
defined non-significant interference as ≤ ± 10% deviation compared to the result of
the reference pool. The results support the sponsor’s claim no acetylated hemoglobin
cross-reactivity was found up to 3000 mg/dL.
Hemoglobin variant interference
Hemoglobin variant testing was conducted to determine if there is any significant
interference with the major hemoglobin variants and the cobas HbA1c Test.
The study was performed using a total of 130 whole blood samples (HbS n=20, HbC
n=20, HbD n=20, HbE n=20, elevated HbF n=20, and elevated HbA2 n=10). Each
sample was tested once in one run on one cobas b 101 instrument. Results obtained
were compared to those obtained with a comparator method shown to be free of
interference from the hemoglobin variant tested (Tina-quant HbA1c Gen.3 (k121610)
on cobas 501 for HbS, HbC, HbD, HbE, and HbA2; Tosoh G8 (k071132) for HbF).
Mean relative bias against the comparator method was calculated separately for each
variant type. The sponsor defines no significant interference as the % recovery as ≤
±10% deviation from the comparator method at 6% and 9% HbA1c.
The labeling contains the following limitation: Heterozygous presence of the most
common hemoglobin variants (HbS, HbC, HbD, HbE, and Hb2) does not interfere.
Testing results indicate that there is no significant interference for HbS (≤41%), HbC
(36%), HbD (42%), HbE (27%) and HbA2 (6.2%).

Glycated HbF is not detected by the assay as it does not contain the glycated beta-
chain that characterizes HbA1c. However, HbF is measured in the total Hb assay and
as a consequence, specimens containing high amounts of HbF (> 10 %) may result in
lower than expected % HbA1c values (DCCT/NGSP)

Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison of the cobas b 101 HbA1c assay was performed according to
CLSI EP09-A3 at three POC sites. Capillary finger-stick whole blood and venous
whole blood (K -EDTA and Li-Heparin) from prospective blood sampling (n=379) )
2
were measured on the cobas b 101 in singlicate and compared to matched venous K -
2
EDTA whole blood measured on the Tosoh G8 HPLC Analyzer at a NGSP secondary
reference laboratory. For capillary finger-stick whole blood, the range tested was 4.3-
11.6 % HbA1c. For K -EDTA venous whole blood, the range tested was 4.4-12.9%
2
HbA1c. For lithium heparin whole blood, the range tested was 4.3-11.6 % HbA1c.
Each site utilized three cobas b 101 instruments with four study operators at each site.
Each site received a different lot of the cobas b 101 HbA1c reagent disc. Passing-
Bablok regression analysis results in NGSP units (%HbA1c) are listed in the tables
below.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor states the following in the labeling:
In 2016, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended a reasonable A1c
goal for many non-pregnant adults is < 7 % (53 mmol/mol). Providers might reasonably
suggest more stringent A1C goals (such as 6.5 % [48 mmol/mol]) for selected individual
patients if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects
of treatment. Appropriate patients might include those with short duration of diabetes,
type 2 diabetes treated with lifestyle or metformin only, long life expectancy, or no
significant cardiovascular disease. Less stringent A1C goals (such as 8 % [64
mmol/mol]) may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia,
limited life expectancy, advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications,

difficult to attain despite diabetes self-management education, appropriate glucose
monitoring, and effective doses of multiple glucose-lowering agents including insulin.
