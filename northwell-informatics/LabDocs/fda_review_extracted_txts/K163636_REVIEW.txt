The detection and identification of specific viral and bacterial nucleic acids from
individuals exhibiting signs and/or symptoms of respiratory tract infection aids in the
diagnosis of respiratory infection when used in conjunction with other clinical and
epidemiological information. The results of this test should not be used as the sole
basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions.
Negative results in the setting of a respiratory illness may be due to infection with
pathogens that are not detected by this test, or lower respiratory tract infection that
may not be detected by a nasopharyngeal swab specimen. Positive results do not rule
out co-infection with other organisms: the organism(s) detected by the ePlex® RP
Panel may not be the definite cause of disease. Additional laboratory testing (e.g.
bacterial and viral culture, immunofluorescence, and radiography) may be necessary
when evaluating a patient with possible respiratory tract infection.
Due to the genetic similarity between human rhinovirus and enterovirus, the ePlex®
RP Panel cannot reliably differentiate them. If differentiation is required, an ePlex®
RP Panel positive human rhinovirus/enterovirus result should be followed-up using
an alternative method (e.g., cell culture or sequence analysis).
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established when influenza A H1-
2009 and A H3 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. Performance
of detecting influenza A may vary if other influenza A strains are circulating or a
novel influenza A virus emerges. If infection with a novel influenza A virus is
suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria
recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with
appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent
to state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted
in these cases unless a BSL-3+ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

I. Device Description:
The ePlex Respiratory Pathogen (RP) Panel is based on the principles of competitive
nucleic acid hybridization using a sandwich assay format, wherein a single-stranded
target binds concurrently to a sequence-specific solution-phase signal probe and a solid-
3

--- Page 4 ---
phase electrode-bound capture probe. The test employs nucleic acid extraction, target
amplification via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription PCR (RT-
PCR), and hybridization of target DNA. In the process, the double-stranded PCR
amplicons are digested with exonuclease to generate single-stranded DNA suitable for
hybridization.
Nucleic acid extraction from biological specimens occurs within the cartridge via cell
lysis, nucleic acid capture onto magnetic beads, and release for amplification. The nucleic
acid extraction is processed through microfluidic liquid handling. Once the nucleic acid
targets are captured and inhibitors are washed away, the magnetic particles are delivered
to the electrowetting environment on the printed circuit board (PCB) and the targets are
eluted from the particles and amplified.
During hybridization, the single-stranded target DNA binds to a complementary, single-
stranded capture probe immobilized on the working gold electrode surface. Single-
stranded signal probes (labeled with electrochemically active ferrocenes) bind to specific
target sequence / region adjacent to the capture probe. Simultaneous hybridization of
target to signal probes and capture probe is detected by alternating current voltammetry
(ACV). Each working electrode on the array contains specific capture probes, and
sequential analysis of each electrode allows detection of multiple analyte targets.
A summary of the ePlex RP Panel nucleic acid targets is presented in Table 1 below.

L. Test Principle:
The ePlex instrument automates all aspects of nucleic acid testing including extraction,
amplification, and detection, combining electrowetting and GenMark’s eSensor
technology in a single-use cartridge. eSensor technology is based on the principles of
competitive DNA hybridization and electrochemical detection, which is highly specific
and is not based on fluorescent or optical detection.
Electrowetting, or digital microfluidics, uses electrical fields to directly manipulate
discrete droplets on the surface of a hydrophobically coated printed circuit board (PCB).
Sample and reagents are moved in a programmable fashion in the ePlex cartridge to
complete all portions of the sample processing from nucleic acid extraction to detection.
A sample is loaded onto the ePlex cartridge and nucleic acids are extracted and purified
from the specimen via magnetic solid phase extraction. For RNA targets, a reverse
transcription step is performed to generate complementary DNA from the RNA, followed
by PCR to amplify the targets. Exonuclease digestion creates single-stranded DNA in
preparation for eSensor detection.
The target DNA is mixed with ferrocene-labeled signal probes that are complementary to
the specific targets on the panel. Target DNA hybridizes to its complementary signal
probe and capture probes, which are bound to gold-plated electrodes, as shown below in
Figure 1.

The presence of each target is determined by voltammetry which generates specific
electrical signals from the ferrocene-labeled signal.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Reproducibility Study :
A multisite reproducibility study of the ePlex RP Panel was conducted at three
testing sites (two external sites and one internal site) across major potential sources
of variability, such as site-to-site, lot-to-lot, day-to-day, and operator-to-operator.
One ePlex instrument per study site with either three or four towers was employed
in this reproducibility study. Two operators performed testing at each site on six
days (five nonconsecutive days) with three unique lots of ePlex RP Panel cartridges.
A reproducibility study panel consisting of three panel members with six organisms
that represent seven RP Panel targets (multi-spiked1) at three concentrations
(moderate positive - 3x LoD, low positive - 1x LoD, and negative) was tested in
triplicate. The six representative organisms in the reproducibility study panel
included adenovirus, coronavirus OC43 (CoV-OC43), human metapneumovirus,
1Due to the design of ePlex RP Panel, where each of the representative targets are located in separate PCR
reactions/lanes (except for CoV-OC43 and RSV A), nucleic acid amplification of each target is conducted in a
reaction that is physically separated from the other targets. Therefore, pooling of multiple analyte targets in one
specimen (i.e., the multi-spiking approach) most likely does not perform differently than a test sample containing a
single analyte target. Analytical study results also demonstrated that the same analytical sensitivity was achieved for
CoV-OC43 and RSV A regardless of whether they were tested separately/independently or together within the same
sample mix.

influenza A H3, parainfluenza virus 1, and RSV A; organisms were diluted in
natural clinical matrix (pooled, negative nasopharyngeal swab in VTM samples).
Negative samples consisted of the same natural clinical matrix (pooled, negative
nasopharyngeal swab in VTM samples) only. Each contrived sample was divided
into aliquots and stored frozen (‐70 °C) prior to testing. Each operator tested nine
samples (i.e., three member reproducibility panel in triplicate) each day; each panel
member was tested 108 times (3 replicates x 3 sites x 2 operators x 3 lots x 2 days
of testing/operator/lot) for a minimum of 324 tests.
Summary results for the ePlex RP Panel reproducibility study are provided in Table
4 below.

a 1/324 reproducibility panel samples had initial and re-tested invalid results (tested at Site 3) and was excluded
from this analysis.
Over the course of the reproducibility study, a total of three different ePlex
instruments and 66 different ePlex bays (one 4-tower ePlex instrument each at Site 1
and Site 2, and one 3-tower ePlex instrument at Site 3, each tower has six bays)
were used by six different operators at three different sites. All bays were utilized at
least once during the conduct of this study.
In total, 334 runs were attempted with one pre-flight check failure. Of the 333 runs
that initiated, all runs completed and valid results were obtained from 323 out of the
333 runs that were initiated (323/333, 97.0%).

and detection of DNA targets, and RNA controls verify amplification and detection
of RNA targets. Each amplification reaction on the cartridge has at least one
internal control and in each reaction either the internal control or a target must
generate signal above the defined threshold for a valid test result. Internal control
results are interpreted by the ePlex software and displayed on ePlex RP Panel
Reports as Internal Control with a result of PASS, FAIL, N/A, or INVALID. Table
5 below includes detailed interpretation of Internal Control results.

External Controls
External controls are not provided with the ePlex RP Panel. However, during the
prospective clinical evaluation of the ePlex RP Panel, each testing site was provided
with positive and negative external control samples. There were four external
positive controls (A, B, C, D) and one external negative control. The positive
controls together represent all the targets on the ePlex RP Panel. On each day of
testing with the ePlex RP Panel, each site tested at least one positive and one
negative control. Sites rotated through the four positive controls throughout the
study.

· two Positive Controls (A and B) each had a FP result for Human
Rhinovirus/Enterovirus
· one Positive Control A had a false negative (FN) result for PIV 4.
The sponsor is also recommending the following in the product package insert:
“Positive and negative external controls should be tested with each new lot of
reagents or monthly, whichever occurs first. Viral transport medium can be used as
the negative control. Previously characterized positive samples or viral transport
medium spiked with well characterized organisms can be used as the external
positive control. External controls should be run in accordance with laboratory
protocols and accrediting organizations, as applicable.”
Specimen Stability
The ePlex RP Panel package insert claims that clinical specimens can be stored at
room temperature (15–30ºC) for up to 12 hours or refrigerated at 4°C for up to 10
days after collection in transport media. Specimens can also be stored at -20°C or
-80°C for six months with up to two freeze/thaw cycles.
These clinical specimen stability claims are supported by analytical study which
investigated the effect of different specimen storage conditions on specimen
integrity (as determined by performance on the ePlex RP Panel).
A representative panel of six analytes (Table 7) was spiked into a pooled
nasopharyngeal (NP) sample to approximately 1x LoD concentrations. It is noted
that the six-analyte test sample generates seven results for the ePlex RP Panel.

The specimen stability study acceptance criteria were the following:
· Performance at each time point will be considered acceptable if the
positivity rate for each analyte (either from the first 10 replicates or from the
final 20 replicates in case of additional testing) is equivalent to the positivity
rate for the corresponding analyte at time point T0 (baseline time point).
“Equivalent” is defined as positivity rates that differ by 5% or less.
· If a time point did not meet the positivity acceptance criteria, the next time
point was evaluated. If the subsequent time point met the acceptance
criteria, the study was continued. If two consecutive time points failed, the
specimen stability was determined to be the last time point when the
acceptance criteria were met.
The specimen stability assessment data are summarized in Table 9 to Table 13
below.

instructions. Twenty (20) of these cartridges were run within 10 minutes of loading;
the other 20 cartridges were kept for two hours at room temperature and then run
following package insert instructions.
The acceptance criteria for this analytical study were the following:
· The sample is stable at room temperature after it has been loaded into the
cartridge for up to 120 minutes prior to running the cartridge. Stability is
defined as equal positivity rates for each target in each of the tested
conditions that will be compared to each other. Equivalent positivity rate is
defined as positivity rates that differ by 5% or less.

The study results demonstrated that the cartridge can be stored at room temperature
(15–30ºC) for two hours after the sample has been loaded prior to running the
cartridge in an ePlex bay.
Simulated vs. Natural NPS in VTM Specimen Study
An analytical study was conducted to verify sample matrix equivalency between
Remel M5 VTM (simulated matrix) and pooled negative nasopharyngeal swabs
(NPS) collected in commercially available VTM (natural matrix) for the ePlex RP
Panel for targets that are tested at 10x LoD and above.
A representative panel of six analytes (Table 7 above) was spiked either into Remel
M5 VTM or pooled negative NPS at a final concentration of approximately 10x
LoD. A negative control was run in duplicate for VTM and the NPS pool. Twenty
(20) cartridge runs of spiked NPS matrix and 20 cartridge runs of spiked VTM were
performed, as were two negative controls with each set of 20 runs (i.e., 44 cartridge
runs were performed).
The acceptance criteria for this analytical study were the following:
· The assay will be determined to not be impacted by sample matrix if the
positivity rate for each target is equivalent to the positivity rate for the
corresponding target in the simulated matrix control. Equivalent is defined
as positivity rates that differ by 5% or less.
The sample matrix equivalence study results are summarized in Table 17 below.

The results from the sample matrix equivalency study demonstrated the equivalency
between Remel M5 VTM and natural nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) collected in
Remel M5 VTM for targets at approximately 10x LoD.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD), or analytical sensitivity was identified and verified for
each viral and bacterial target on the ePlex RP Panel using quantified reference
strains/isolates. Serial dilutions were prepared in a natural clinical matrix (pooled,
negative nasopharyngeal swab in VTM samples) with one or more organisms per
series, and at least 20 replicates per target were tested in the verification. The limit
of detection was defined as the lowest concentration at which each target is detected
at least 95% of the time. The confirmed LoD for each ePlex RP Panel organism is
shown in Table 18 below.

e. Analytical Reactivity:
A panel of 101 strains/isolates representing the genetic, temporal, and geographic
diversity of each target on the ePlex RP Panel was evaluated to demonstrate
analytical reactivity. Each strain/isolate was tested in triplicate at 3x LoD in natural
clinical matrix (pooled, negative nasopharyngeal swab in VTM samples); if the
organism was not detected at this concentration, testing of higher concentrations
was performed. Additional in silico analysis was also performed on a subset of
ePlex RP Panel organisms.
Results of analytical reactivity study, including in silico analysis results, are shown
in Tables 19 to Table 29.

For human, avian, and swine influenza A strains that were not available for wet
testing on the ePlex RP Panel, in silico analysis was performed. Bioinformatics
analysis was used to predict a result based on the number and location of
mismatches in the primers, capture probes, and signal probes found in the ePlex RP
Panel relative to an alignment of GenBank sequences. The in silico analysis results
are summarized in Table 24 below.

a Extracted genomic RNA
b Plasmid does not contain full length viral genome.
No cross-reactivity was observed between any of the off-panel viruses,
bacteria or fungi with the ePlex RP Panel targets.
g. Assay cut-off:
Analytical studies were conducted to establish the signal boundaries for all targets
and controls of the ePlex RP Panel.
Positive and negative NPS samples were obtained from internal and external
sources. Supplemental samples were contrived for analytes that were under-
represented in the existing sample set. Contrived samples included viral and
bacterial cultures prepared in negative NPS. Contrived positive samples were
formulated using cultured analytes that were diluted into negative NPS matrix. For
each target, the signals for positive and negative tests were analyzed. An
appropriate boundary was established wherein specificity and sensitivity were
maximized. The analysis was verified by ROC analysis. The final boundary set
points are listed in Table 32 below.

a Due to elevated background signal on RSV B in the presence of RSV A virus, there is a conditional
threshold for RSV B for when an RSV A signal is detected. In the absence of RSV A signal above
10 nA, the boundary set point for RSV B is 20 nA; if an RSV A signal is detected at greater than 10
nA on a cartridge, the boundary set point for RSV B is set to 30 nA.
h. Interfering Substances:
Substances commonly found in respiratory samples, substances that could be
introduced during specimen collection, or medications commonly used to treat
congestion, allergies, or asthma symptoms that could potentially interfere with the
ePlex RP Panel were individually evaluated in an analytical study. To simulate
clinical samples, quantified representative viral and bacterial strains were diluted to
1x LoD in a natural clinical matrix (pooled, negative nasopharyngeal swab
specimens) and tested in triplicate for negative and positive interference. Natural
clinical matrix (pooled, negative nasopharyngeal swab samples) with no organisms
added was used as a control.
All substances and organisms tested for interference were shown to be compatible
with the ePlex RP Panel. No potentially interfering substances or microorganisms
were found to inhibit the ePlex RP Panel at the concentrations tested in Table 33
below.

Note: Nasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist) were not evaluated in this study, but
are predicted to be reactive with the ePlex RP Panel Influenza A (including
subtype) and Influenza B assays. Therefore, contamination of specimens with
vaccine or recent administration of the vaccine prior to NPS specimen collection
could lead to accurate detection by the ePlex RP Panel of the viruses contained in
the vaccine, but would not represent infection by those agents.
i. Co-Detected Organisms Study:
Detection of more than one clinically relevant viral and/or bacterial organism in a
sample was evaluated in an analytical study with the ePlex RP Panel, using a
natural clinical matrix (pooled, negative nasopharyngeal swab samples) spiked with
two ePlex RP Panel targeted organisms: one organism at a low concentration (i.e.,
1-3x LoD) and the second organism at a high concentration (i.e., 1.0E+05
TCID /mL).

The study results demonstrated the ability of the ePlex RP Panel to detect two
clinically relevant co-infecting organisms in a sample at both high and low
concentrations.
j.Carry-Over Contamination:
The carryover/cross-contamination rate of the ePlex RP Panel and ePlex instrument
was evaluated using a checkerboard approach by running high positive and negative
samples interspersed in all bays of a four-tower ePlex instrument (i.e., 24 bays total)
over five separate runs on five separate days. Quantified parainfluenza virus 3 was
prepared in VTM at a high concentration (1.0E+05 TCID /mL) to simulate a
50
clinically relevant high positive and was tested as a representative target organism.
VTM was used to represent negative samples. On each round of testing, 24 ePlex
RP Panel cartridges were evaluated. 100% of parainfluenza 3-positive samples
generated a result of Detected and 100% of parainfluenza 3-negative samples
generated a parainfluenza 3 result of No Target Detected, indicating no carryover or
cross-contamination was observed between bays or within bays with the ePlex RP
Panel when testing samples consecutively or in adjacent bays with an ePlex
instrument .

representative of the intended use setting (clinical laboratories) and testing was
performed by trained clinical laboratory personnel.
Clinical performance of the ePlex RP Panel was evaluated testing clinical
nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples prospectively-collected in VTM at eight
geographically distinct U.S. clinical sites in two phases. From March 2013 through
August 2014 (Phase 1), NPS in VTM samples were prospectively-collected from all
comers meeting the study eligibility criteria at four specimen collection sites and
immediately frozen (N=2218 specimens) for later testing as prospective
archived/frozen (Category II) specimens. From September 2016 through October
2016 (Phase 2), NPS in VTM samples were prospectively-collected from all comers
meeting the study eligibility criteria and tested fresh at five specimen collection and
testing sites (N=514 specimens) as prospective fresh (Category I) specimens.
Category II specimens were distributed to sites beginning in September 2016. Study
sites also began testing Category I specimens at this time. At each site, Category II
specimens were thawed and tested according to the study procedures as time
permitted over the remaining duration of the clinical study.
A total of 2732 prospective specimens (Category I and II) were collected across the
two phases. Prior to the start of investigational testing the ePlex RP Panel, 263
specimens were withdrawn (251 specimens had sample handling deviations, nine
specimens were outside of the protocol allowed timelines, two specimens had
insufficient volume, and one specimen had incomplete documentation) from the
study. Of the 2469 remaining prospective specimens eligible for testing, 2462 (511
Category I and 1951 Category II specimens) were evaluable. Samples with final,
valid results and a valid comparator result were considered evaluable. Seven (7)
prospective specimens were not evaluable due to the lack of final, valid ePlex RP
Panel results and were excluded from performance evaluations.
Demographic information for the 2462 evaluable prospective specimens is
described in Table 35 below.

A total of five test sites participated in the prospective clinical evaluation of ePlex
RP Panel. One test site had a 4-tower ePlex instrument (24 bays) and the remaining
four test sites had a 3-tower ePlex instrument (18 bays). A total of 13 ePlex RP
Panel cartridge lots were used in the prospective clinical evaluation.
The performance of the ePlex RP Panel was evaluated by comparing the ePlex RP
Panel results with those from an FDA-cleared multiplexed respiratory pathogen
panel (i.e., the main comparator) and an analytically validated PCR test with bi-
directional sequencing for confirmation of RSV subtypes.
Prospective Clinical Study Performance
Positive percent agreement (PPA) for each panel organism was calculated by
dividing the number of true positive (TP) results by the sum of TP and false
negative (FN) results, while negative percent agreement (NPA) was calculated by
dividing the number of true negative (TN) results by the sum of TN and false
positive (FP) results. A TP result was one where the “detected” ePlex RP Panel
result matched the “detected” comparator method result, while a TN result was one
where a “negative” ePlex RP Panel result matched a “negative” comparator method
result. A FN result was one where the “negative” ePlex RP Panel result did not
match the “detected” comparator method result, while a FP result was one where
the “detected” ePlex RP Panel result did not match the “negative” comparator
method result. The two-sided 95% confidence interval was also calculated.
Samples for which FP and/or FN results (i.e., discrepant results) were obtained
when comparing the ePlex RP Panel results to the comparator method results were
further investigated. The discrepancy investigation was mainly conducted by
performing analytically validated PCR/Sequencing assays.
The ePlex RP Panel prospective performance data in positive percent and negative
percent agreements against the comparator methods (all sites combined) are
presented in the following Table 36 by analyte:

Retrospective Clinical Study
Some of the organisms on the ePlex RP Panel were of low prevalence and were not
encountered in sufficiently large numbers during the prospective evaluation to
adequately demonstrate system performance. To supplement the number of
positives for targets that were not sufficiently represented in the prospective
collection, additional nasopharyngeal swab in VTM specimens were retrospectively
collected from six clinical sites.

A total of 535 nasopharyngeal swab in VTM specimens that had previously tested
positive for one or more of the target organisms during standard-of-care (SOC)
testing were collected and stored frozen. Prior to the start of investigational testing,
11 specimens were withdrawn due to incompliance to the study protocol, and 52
specimens were withdrawn because the organisms present had sufficient
representation in other samples. In addition, the composition and integrity of the
pre-selected specimens were also confirmed with the same comparator method
employed in the prospective clinical study (i.e., an FDA-cleared multiplexed
respiratory pathogen panel). As the result of this confirmation testing using the
comparator method, 26 additional specimens were excluded because the original
SOC testing positive results for the intended organisms were not confirmed when
tested with the comparator method.
The remaining 446 retrospective specimens were eligible for testing in this study,
all 446 specimens were evaluable. The retrospective specimens were distributed
approximately equally across the same five testing sites that participated in the
prospective evaluation of the ePlex RP Panel. Prospective and retrospective
samples were intermixed and testing sites were blinded to the identity of the
samples.
Demographic information for the 446 eligible retrospective specimens is described
in Table 39 below.

Mock Clinical Study
Influenza A H1 and Chlamydia pneumoniae are of such rarity that both prospective
and retrospective testing efforts were insufficient to demonstrate system
performance for these two organisms. To supplement the prospective and
retrospective data, an evaluation of contrived specimens was performed at the same
five testing sites that participated in the prospective and retrospective evaluations of
the ePlex RP Panel. Contrived clinical specimens were prepared using individual
unique negative residual clinical NPS in VTM specimens. For each target, at least
50 individual specimens were prepared with half of the samples spiked at
approximately 2 -10x LoD and the remaining samples spiked with target spanning
the expected clinical range. Contrived samples were tested along with other clinical
samples and/or contrived samples that were negative for the corresponding target.
There were 327 contrived specimens created and tested to supplement low
prevalence targets on the RP Panel; 104 specimens contained one or more low
prevalence organisms (i.e., Influenza A H1 and Chlamydia pneumoniae) and 223
specimens were negative for these organisms. All 327 contrived specimens were
tested with the ePlex RP Panel and 326 were evaluable. The one unevaluable
specimen did not have a final, valid ePlex RP Panel result after repeat testing.
Mock clinical study results are summarized for these two low prevalence organisms
in Table 40 below.

Clinical Study ePlex Instrument Performance
There were 3242 specimens eligible for ePlex RP Panel testing (i.e., 2469
prospective specimens, 446 retrospective specimens, and 327 contrived specimens)
in the clinical evaluations of the ePlex RP Panel. Influenza A with no subtype was

detected in 11 specimens. These 11 specimens underwent an additional ePlex RP
Panel test per the product instructions for use to identify the subtype. In addition, 28
specimens that had been withdrawn were inadvertently sent for investigational
testing. In total, there were 3281 specimens initially tested using the ePlex RP
Panel.
Of the 3281 specimens initially tested, 3127 (95.3%, 95% CI: 94.5% - 96.0%) had
valid results and 154 (4.7%, 95% CI: 4.0% -5.5%) had invalid results. Initial
validity rates were similar across the five testing sites. The 154 initially invalid
specimens were re-tested per the product instructions for use at the same or a
different testing site and 146 had valid results. The final validity rate was 99.8%
(3273/3281) (95% CI: 99.5%-99.9%). Final validity rates were also similar across
the testing sites.
Of the 162 invalid results (154 initial invalid and 8 re-test invalid), 161 were due to
an assay algorithm failure and one was due to operator error. For the one invalid
due to an operator error, the cartridge ejected due to a pre-flight failure but the
operator did not notice until the following morning. The cartridge was re-inserted
and testing completed; however, the sample was in the cartridge for longer than
indicated in the product instructions for use so the initial result was invalidated by
the operator and the specimen was re- tested.

Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A prospective, multicenter clinical study was conducted to evaluate the clinical
performance of the ePlex RP Panel in nasopharyngeal swab in VTM specimens.
2462 prospective specimens were collected at eight collection sites in two phases
from patients of all ages and genders presenting with signs and/or symptoms of
respiratory infection. In the first phase from March 2013 through August 2014,
1951 prospective specimens were collected and frozen; from September 2016
through October 2016, 511 prospective specimens were collected and tested fresh
(never frozen). The expected values of individual analytes based on ePlex RP Panel
results in prospective specimens for each phase are summarized in Table 41 to
Table 44 below.

N. Instrument Name:
ePlex Instrument
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
After samples have been loaded in the ePlex RP Panel cartridge, the remaining
processing steps are executed under control of the ePlex instrument.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes
for this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification can be entered manually or via barcode.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The ePlex RP Panel is intended for use with nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) collected in
VTM specimens. The operator removes an ePlex RP Panel cartridge pouch and one
Sample Delivery Device from Kit packaging. The operator first writes the accession
ID or place a barcode label with accession ID on the ePlex RP Panel cartridge and the
Sample Delivery Device, and then pipette 200 µl of specimen into the Sample
Delivery Device using a calibrated pipette, close the Sample Delivery Device, and
vortex it for 10 seconds. The operator subsequently removes the white cover from the
tip of the Sample Delivery Device, invert the Sample Delivery Device and dispense
the entire volume (~350 µL) by squeezing the vial and dispensing the drops into the
sample loading port of the ePlex RP Panel cartridge. The operator then close the
sample loading port by sliding the cap over the port and firmly pushing down on the
cap to securely seal the sample delivery port, scan the ePlex RP Panel cartridge using
the barcode reader provided with the ePlex instrument, and insert the cartridge into
any available bay on the ePlex instrument, indicated by a flashing, white LED light.
The test then begins automatically when the cartridge has been inserted into the bay
and the pre-run check (cartridge initialization) is completed, indicated by a blue LED
light.
5. Calibration:
Not applicable

6. Quality Control:
Internal Controls
Each ePlex RP Panel cartridge includes internal controls that monitor performance of
each step of the testing process. A DNA control verifies extraction, amplification and
detection of DNA targets, and RNA controls verify amplification and detection of
RNA targets. Each amplification reaction on the cartridge has at least one internal
control and in each reaction either the internal control or a target must generate signal
above the defined threshold for a valid test result. Internal control results are
interpreted by the ePlex software and displayed on ePlex RP Panel Reports as Internal
Control with a result of PASS, FAIL, N/A or INVALID.
External Controls
External controls are not provided with the ePlex RP Panel. However, the sponsor is
making the following recommendations regarding running external controls in the
product package insert:
“Positive and negative external controls should be tested with each new lot of
reagents or monthly, whichever occurs first. Viral transport medium can be used as
the negative control. Previously characterized positive samples or viral transport
medium spiked with well characterized organisms can be used as the external
positive control. External controls should be run in accordance with laboratory
protocols and accrediting organizations, as applicable.”
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not applicable
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
