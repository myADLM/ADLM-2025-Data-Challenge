H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System is intended for the in vitro rapid
identification (ID) and quantitative determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by
minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Gram Negative aerobic and facultative
anaerobic bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae and non-
Enterobacteriaceae.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is intended for in vitro quantitative
determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)
of most Gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial isolates from pure
culture for Enterobacteriaceae and Non-Enterobacteriaceae and most Gram-positive
bacteria isolates from pure culture belonging to the genera Staphylococcus, Enterococcus
and Streptococcus.
Ceftazidime/avibactam has been shown to be active in vitro against most strains of
microorganisms listed below, as described in the FDA-approved package inserts for this
antimicrobial agent.
Active in vitro and in Clinical Infections Against:
Citrobacter freundii complex
Citrobacter koseri
Escherichia coli
Enterobacter aerogenes
Enterobacter cloacae
Klebsiella pneumoniae
Klebsiella oxytoca

--- Page 3 ---
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
Limitations:
· The ability of the Phoenix System to detect resistance in the following
combination(s) is unknown because a sufficient number of resistant strains were
not encountered at the time of comparative clinical testing:
Ceftazidime/avibactam Isolates other than Klebsiella pneumoniae and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
· Ceftazidime/avibactam: Providencia stuartii - Due to the lack of an intermediate
breakpoint, three out of four major errors which occurred for P. stuartii were
within essential agreement when compared to the reference method. The adjusted
error rate was 3.4%. Testing should be repeated using an alternative
testing/reference method prior to reporting results for the drug with Providencia
stuartii when the Phoenix MIC is 16/4 μg/mL.
· Enzyme group characterization was not available at the time of comparative
testing, and therefore the performance of the BD Phoenix ceftazidime/avibactam
is unknown for Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence AmpC, or lacking outer
membrane porin (OprD).
4. Special instrument requirements:
BD Phoenix Instrument and software (V5.83A or higher)
BD PhoenixSpec Nephelometer
BD Phoenix AP instrument
I. Device Description:
This submission is for a single drug in the gram negative ID/AST or AST only panel. The
ID System was not reviewed.
The Phoenix AST method is a broth based microdilution test. The Phoenix panel is a
sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene tray, with 136 micro-wells containing
dried reagents. The ID/AST combination panel includes an ID side (51 wells) with dried
substrates for bacterial identification and an AST side (85 wells). The AST panel contains
a wide range of two-fold doubling dilution concentrations of antimicrobial agents and
growth and fluorescent controls at appropriate well locations. The AST panel does not
include wells for isolate identification.
The Phoenix System utilizes a redox indicator for the detection of organism growth in the
presence of an antimicrobial agent. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and
be preliminarily identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then
3

--- Page 4 ---
suspended in ID broth, and equated to a 0.5 McFarland suspension using a nephelometer
device. A further dilution is made into AST broth (a cation-adjusted formulation of
Mueller-Hinton broth containing 0.010% Tween 80), to which the redox-buffered
oxidation-reduction AST indicator solution is added producing a blue color in the wells.
The concentration of organisms in the final AST broth suspension is approximately 5 X
105 CFU/mL.
The Phoenix AST Broth is poured into the inoculation port of the AST panel and the
inoculum flows into the panel, filling panel wells. Polyethylene caps are applied to seal
the inoculation ports. An air admittance port is located in the panel lid to ensure adequate
oxygen tension in the panel for the duration of the test. Inoculated panels are barcode
scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System instrument
where panels are continuously incubated at 35˚C ± 1˚C.
Continuous measurements of changes to the indicator as well as bacterial turbidity are
used in the determination of bacterial growth. The instrument takes readings every 20
minutes. Organisms growing in the presence of a given antimicrobial agent reduce the
indicator (changing it to a pink color). This signals organism growth and resistance to
that antimicrobial agent. Organisms killed or inhibited by the antimicrobial agent do not
cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do not produce a color change. The
Phoenix instrument reads and records the results of the antimicrobial tests contained in
the panel and interprets the reactions (based on the organism identification) to give a
minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value and category interpretations (susceptible,
intermediate, resistant or not susceptible). AST results are available within 4 to 16 hours.
This is an autoread result; no manual readings are possible with this system.
Additional comments concerning specific organism/antimicrobial combinations is
provided from the software-driven “EXPERT” system, using rules derived from CLSI
documentation.

L. Test Principle:
The BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution method
that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection of
organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells containing serial
two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control wells” that contain no
antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing was conducted at three clinical trial sites. Testing was
performed using inocula prepared manually using the PhoenixSpec nephelometer and
the automated BD Phoenix AP instrument. The mode MIC value was determined and
the reproducibility was calculated based on MIC values falling within ± 1 dilution of
the mode MIC value.
Fourteen organisms with on-scale ceftazidime/avibactam modal MIC values were
provided to the testing sites by BD with isolate identification and expected MIC result
blinded to the testers. Isolates were tested in triplicate on three separate days.
14 isolates x 3 replicates x 3 sites x 3 days= 378 data points
Results of the inter-site and intra-site reproducibility studies were acceptable and
demonstrated best case and worst case results of greater than 95%. There were no off-
scale MIC results. A summary of the reproducibility study performance is shown in
Table 2 below.

ATCC 25922, E. coli ATCC 35218, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, and P.
aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were performed each day of the challenge and clinical study
testing with the reference method and with the BD Phoenix Systems. The inocula
were standardized using both the Phoenix AP instrument and PhoenixSpec
Nephelometer (manual). A sufficient number of tests were performed and all quality
control results for the BD Phoenix fell within the acceptable ranges as per the FDA
drug label, demonstrating that the BD Phoenix System can consistently produce
quality control results in the recommended range for ceftazidime/avibactam. Results
demonstrate that acceptable results were achieved >95% of the time by both Phoenix
AP and manual inoculum preparation methods as shown in Table 3 below.

MIC for ceftazidime in the presence of a fixed concentration of 4 µg/mL of avibactam.
b
K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 should be tested against ceftazidime and avibactam and
ceftazidime alone to confirm the activity of avibactam in the combination and to ensure that the
plasmid encoding the beta-lactamase has not been lost in this strain. The acceptable range for
ceftazidime alone is greater than16 µg/mL.
c The lowest dilution of the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System ceftazidime/avibactam
MIC range is ≤0.25 µg/mL. Obtaining this value was considered as an indicator that the quality
control test results were acceptable.
The expected range of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 is 0.5/4 – 4/4μg/mL.
All P. aeruginosa results were on-scale and within the MIC reporting range of
Phoenix ceftazidime/avibactam. However, the Phoenix MIC reporting range is 0.25/4
to 32/4 μg/mL and does not provide results lower than 0.25/4 μg/mL to cover the
expected range of E. coli ATCC 35218 (0.03/4 – 0.12/4), the lower end of the
expected ranges for E. coli ATCC 25922 (0.06/4), and K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603
(0.25/4). A MIC value of ≤0.25/4 μg/mL indicated that the results for these three QC
organisms were acceptable.
The footnote below is included in Table 1, Quality Control Organisms and Expected
Results of the BD Phoenix ceftazidime/avibactam package insert.
· “The lowest dilution of the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System
ceftazidime/avibactam MIC range is ≤0.25/4 µg/mL. Obtaining this value
was considered as an indicator that the quality control test results were
acceptable.”
In addition, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 is recommended to test against
ceftazidime alone to ensure the presence of the plasmid encoding beta-lactamase
when testing this beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination,
ceftazidime/avibactam. The acceptable result for ceftazidime alone is greater than
16µg/mL. The footnote below is included in Table 1, Quality Control Organisms and

Growth Rate: Seven isolates failed to grow during the clinical study. The overall
growth rate during the clinical studies was 99.5%.
Purity Check Plates: Purity check plates were inoculated from the standardized
organism suspensions for both the Phoenix and reference methods. Any isolate that
showed mixed growth on the purity check plate was considered noncompliant and not
included in result analysis.
Inoculum Density Control: The PhoenixSpec Nephelometer was used to prepare the
inocula for testing of the clinical, challenge, reproducibility and QC isolates. The
same inoculum suspension was used for both the Phoenix System and the reference
method testing. The BD Phoenix AP instrument was used to standardize the inocula
for challenge, QC, and reproducibility isolates. Validation data for both the
PhoenixSpec and the Phoenix AP instrument was provided and found to be
acceptable.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The accuracy of results obtained with the Phoenix System was determined by
comparison to the CLSI-recommended broth dilution method (reference method).
Reference panels were prepared according to CLSI M07-A10 guidelines. In addition,
specific to ceftazidime/avibactam, reference panels need to be read within 18 hours of
incubation because of degradation of ceftazidime activity by 24 hours. During the
comparative studies, the reference results were read after 16 to 18 hours of
incubation. Sites performed testing on Gram negative isolates using Phoenix and
reference panel formats appropriate for gram negative organisms. Antimicrobial
9

--- Page 10 ---
agents in the test and reference panels had identical dilution ranges which were
appropriate for the interpretive breakpoints of the drug. Testing was performed using
at least two different production lots of Phoenix panels, AST broth and AST indicator
at each study site. A minimum of three different lots of the Phoenix panel were used
across all sites for the entire study. Phoenix and reference panels were inoculated
using the same organism suspension.
Growth in the Phoenix panels was determined from data recorded by the instrument.
Performance was analyzed using FDA breakpoints for ceftazidime/avibactam, and
results were compared to results obtained by the broth microdilution reference
method based on the guidelines provided in the Class II Special Controls Guidance
Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems.
A total of 1216 clinical isolates were tested at the three study sites and included both
fresh and stock isolates. Stock isolates comprised 9.0% of total isolates tested.
Clinical isolates tested included representatives of species listed in the FDA
pharmaceutical drug label and were tested using inocula prepared by the PhoenixSpec
nephelometer (manual method).
A total of 132 unique challenge isolates with expected results (expected MIC value of
each isolate was the mode after testing with the reference broth dilution multiple
times) were also supplied to the testing sites by the sponsor. Challenge isolates were
obtained from BD’s internal collection and from external laboratories. The challenge
isolates were randomized and divided equally among the testing sites. Results
obtained for Challenge isolates using the Phoenix System were compared to expected
MIC results. Identification and expected results were masked to the study sites. The
inocula for the challenge isolates were prepared using both the PhoenixSpec
Nephelometer (manual method) and the Phoenix AP (automated method).
The performance evaluation summary of essential and categorical agreement results
for clinical and challenge isolates with inocula prepared using the PhoenixSpec
nephelometer (manual method) is shown in Table 4 below.

‡EA – Essential Agreement (+/- 1 doubling dilution)
CA – Category Agreement Maj – Major discrepancies
EVAL – Evaluable isolates Vmj – Very major discrepancies
R – Resistant isolates
NOTE: There are no minor discrepancy calculations due to lack of intermediate category for ceftazidime/avibactam
Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the result of the reference method and that of
BD Phoenix within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are
on scale for both the BD Phoenix panel and the reference method. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the
interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the BD Phoenix result.
The Phoenix ceftazidime/avibactam performance met the acceptance criteria for
Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with overall EA and CA greater
than or equal to 90%. Due to lack of intermediate category, there are no minor
discrepancy calculations for ceftazidime/avibactam. There were no very major
discrepancies. The major (maj) discrepancy rate was 0.5% (6/1178) and 2.7% (4/147)
for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa respectively. When stratified
by organisms, a high maj discrepancy rate was observed with Providencia stuartii.
Providencia stuartii: There were four maj discrepancies (13.8%, 4/29) observed. Of
the four maj discrepancies, three were at the reference breakpoints of 8µg/mL but
within EA (i.e., resistant Phoenix MIC at 16µg/mL). Taking into consideration the
three values within essential agreement, the maj discrepancy rate became 3.4% (1/29)
for P. stuartii. The concern for major discrepancies is addressed in the limitations
section:
“Ceftazidime/avibactam: Providencia stuartii - Due to the lack of an intermediate
breakpoint, three out of four major errors which occurred for P. stuartii were
within essential agreement when compared to the reference method. The adjusted
error rate was 3.4%. Testing should be repeated using an alternative
testing/reference method prior to reporting results for the drug with Providencia
stuartii when the Phoenix MIC is 16/4μg/mL.”

Resistant Isolates: There were a total of 23 resistant isolates in the evaluation of
ceftazidime/avibactam. However, ten isolates each were from K. pneumoniae and P.
aeruginosa. A limitation of insufficient resistant isolates was included:
“The ability of the Phoenix System to detect resistance in the following
combination(s) is unknown because a sufficient number of resistant strains were
not encountered at the time of comparative clinical testing:
Ceftazidime/avibactam Isolates other than Klebsiella pneumoniae and

evaluated for trending. This trending calculation takes into account MIC values that
are determined to be ≤1 and ≥1 doubling dilutions compared to the reference method
irrespective whether the device MIC values are on-scale or not. The trending analysis
is shown in Table 6.

A trend towards higher MIC was observed with claimed Enterobacteriaceae isolates
and P. aeruginosa when compared to the CLSI broth microdilution reference method.
This trending and the potential for occurrence of major discrepancies for
ceftazidime/avibactam when testing clinical and challenge isolate results with the
Phoenix ceftazidime/avibactam was addressed by adding the following footnote:
“BD Phoenix ceftazidime/avibactam MIC values tended to be in exact agreement
or at least one doubling dilution higher when testing Enterobacteriaceae or P.
aeruginosa compared to the reference broth micro-dilution.”
Enzyme Group Characterization/Resistance Markers Information
Enterobacteriaceae with beta-lactamases were included in the ceftazidime/avibactam
comparative studies. They were AmpC (6), KPC (16), OXA (9), CTX-M (8), TEM (14),
and SHV (8). The Enterobacteriaceae included Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter
aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, E. coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae
and Proteus mirabilis.
The study indicated that when beta-lactamases were known, eight K. pneumoniae
demonstrated ceftazidime/avibactam resistance (>32/4µg/mL) in the presence of AmpC,
KPC, OXA, CTX-M, TEM, and/or SHV. However, twelve K. pneumoniae showed
susceptibility to ceftazidime/avibactam with MIC values range from ≤0.25/4 to
4/4µg/mL in the presence of KPC, OXA, CTX-M, TEM, and/or SHV.
In addition, seven metallo-beta-lactamase producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa were
tested and demonstrated resistance (≥32/4µg/mL) to ceftazidime/avibactam. The
following limitation was added to the ceftazidime/avibactam labeling regarding other
resistance markers and enzyme characterization:
“Enzyme group characterization was not available at the time of comparative
testing, and therefore the performance of the BD Phoenix ceftazidime/avibactam
is unknown for Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence AmpC, or lacking outer
membrane porin (OprD).”
