L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA Centaur Intact Parathyroid (PTH) assay is a two-site sandwich immunoassay
using direct chemiluminometric technology, and two monoclonal antibodies. The first
antibody in the Lite Reagent is a monoclonal mouse anti-human PTH (N-terminal) antibody
labeled with acridinium ester. The second antibody is a biotinylated monoclonal mouse anti-
human PTH (C-terminal) antibody that is preformed to streptavidin-coated paramagnetic
latex particles in the Solid Phase reagent.
A direct relationship exists between the amount of PTH present in the patient sample and the
amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the system. Results are calculated from a
master curve adjusted by using high and low calibrators.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3. Nine (9)
samples (6 human K2-EDTA plasma pools and 3 controls) with concentrations
spanning the measuring range of the device were tested in duplicate using 2 runs per
day over 20 days for a total of 80 replicates per sample. The within-run and total
precision results shown in the table below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The ADVIA Centaur Intact PTH assay is traceable to internal standards prepared with
purified human PTH (1-84). Anchor standards are used to assign gold standards,
which are manufactured using the same formulation as the anchor standards. Gold
standards are then used to assign working standards. Working standards are used to
value assign each lot of reagent calibrators.
Value assignment of calibrators:
The value assignment of calibrators is performed during Master Curve runs since the
calibrators are lot specific. Calibrator value assignment is a full-curve value
assignment using working standards for calibration. Four (4) different instruments, 3
runs, and 6 replicates per run are used. For new calibrators, mean concentrations
across all lots and runs and repeatability pooled across all runs per reagent lot must
meet internal specifications. Once the calibrators are value assigned, performance
confirmation steps are executed to ensure that internal specifications for release are
met. The target values for the kit calibrators are approximately 30 pg/mL and 1,630
pg/mL.
Stability:
The calibrator stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
found to be acceptable. Stability information for calibrator materials can be found in
the following table:
Shelf-life 14 months at 2-
8°C
Open, reconstituted, stored at room
8 hours
temperature
Open, reconstituted, stored at < -20°C 60 days
On board the analyzer 8 hours
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2.
Duplicates of each of 5 blank human samples (3 serum, 2 EDTA plasma) were
measured over 2 runs per day and 3 days using 2 instruments and 3 reagent lots for a
total of 120 replicates per reagent lot. The LoB was calculated non-parametrically by
using the 95th percentile of 120 ranked observations for each lot.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2
using a non-parametric approach. Eight (8) replicates of each of 8 human EDTA
plasma pools with a low analyte level (~3.00 pg/mL) were measured over 2 runs per
day and 3 days using 2 instruments for a total of 96 replicates per sample for each of
3 reagent lots. The LoD was determined as the lowest median dose of all samples
tested per lot at which at least 95% of the measurements were greater than the LoB.

The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2.
Ten (10) replicates of each of 8 human pooled EDTA plasma samples with analyte
concentrations ranging from 2 to 12 pg/mL were tested over 2 runs per day and 3
days using 1 instrument and 3 reagent lots for a total of 60 replicates per reagent lot.
The LoQ was determined as the lowest concentration of PTH that can be detected at
a total CV of 20%.
The following detection limit claims were made:

The measuring range of the assay is 6.3 to 2000 pg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
Interference testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP07-A2. Two EDTA
plasma pools were spiked with PTH 1-84 antigen to concentrations of 75 pg/mL and
600 pg/mL. The high PTH sample (spiked with interferent stock solution) and the low
PTH sample were mixed to create intermediate levels of interferent. Samples were
tested in replicates of 6. Percent interference was calculated using the following
equation:
% Interference = 100 × ((Observed dose of spiked sample – Observed dose of
unspiked sample) / Observed dose of unspiked sample)
Interference was defined by the sponsor as >10% difference from the control sample.
The interference study results are summarized in the following table:

Human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) interference:
A HAMA interference study was performed by spiking four HAMA positive serum
samples and four HAMA positive EDTA samples with synthetic PTH 1-84 to a final
PTH concentration of approximately 60 and 350 pg/mL. Testing was performed on
one analyzer with one lot of reagent. Percent recovery was calculated by comparing
the observed PTH values from spiked HAMA positive samples to the expected PTH
concentrations (based on adding a known amount of PTH).

The sponsor includes the following limitation in the assay package insert:
“Patient samples may contain heterophilic antibodies that could react in
immunoassays to give falsely elevated or depressed results. This assay is designed to
minimize interference from heterophilic antibodies.”
Cross-reactivity:
Cross-reactivity was determined by spiking each cross-reactant into human EDTA
plasma containing endogenous intact PTH (~30 pg/mL). Percent cross-reactivity was
calculated using the following equation:
% Cross-reactivity = 100 × ((Concentration of cross-reactant sample – Concentration
of control sample)) / Concentration of cross-reactant
The cross-reactivity study results are summarized in the following table:

Hook Effect Study:
To evaluate the potential for a high dose hook effect in the ADVIA Centaur Intact
PTH assay, a concentrated PTH sample was prepared by spiking a EDTA plasma
sample with synthetic human PTH for a final target concentration of 400,000 pg/mL.
The sample was serially diluted using a Siemens Multi-diluent to obtain 11 PTH
samples ranging from 391 to 400,000 pg/mL. The samples were tested in triplicate on
2 ADVIA Centaur XP systems using 2 reagent lots. The study results demonstrated
that patient samples with intact PTH levels as high as 400,000 pg/mL are not affected
by a high dose hook effect. The sponsor includes the following statement in the
labeling regarding hook effect:
“Patient samples with high intact PTH levels can cause a paradoxical decrease in the
RLUs (high-dose hook effect). In this assay, patient samples with intact PTH levels as
high as 100,000 pg/mL (10,600 pmol/L) are reported as >2000 pg/mL (>212
pmol/L).”

minute post-excision test result after the last parathyroid gland excision.
Data analysis of positive and overall percent agreements was determined in
accordance with CLSI EP12-A2. Positive agreement is defined as the number of
successful surgeries on both devices relative to the number of successful surgeries on
the comparator devices. The overall agreement is defined as the sum of the number of
successful surgeries on both devices and the number of unsuccessful surgeries on
both devices relative to the total number of surgeries conducted. Successful
agreement between the ADVIA Centaur Intact PTH assay and the comparator assays
is defined as > 85% positive percent agreement and > 85% overall percent agreement.
The results of the study are shown in the table below.
Comparator assay
Successful surgery Unsuccessful surgery
ADVIA Centaur Successful surgery 29 1
Intact PTH assay Unsuccessful surgery 0 0
Positive Agreement = 100% (29/29)
Overall Agreement = 96.7% (29/30)
This intra-operative clinical study comparing the ADVIA Centaur intact PTH assay to
comparator assay methods supports the intra-operative claims of the ADVIA Centaur
Intact PTH assay.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The reference range was assessed in accordance with CLSI EP28-A3c using 142 fresh,
paired serum and EDTA plasma samples from apparently healthy donors (70 females
aged 22-76 years; 72 males aged 22-65 years) with normal calcium, TSH, creatinine, and
Vitamin D levels. Samples were analyzed in singlicate with one ADVIA Centaur XP
system and one reagent lot. The results of the reference range study are shown below.
Sample type 95% Reference interval (pg/mL) Overall range (pg/mL)
Plasma 18.4 – 80.1 10.7 – 84.6
Serum 18.5 – 88.0 11.2 – 99.4
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
