4. Panel:
Immunology and Microbiology Devices
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Sofia Lyme FIA:
The Sofia Lyme FIA employs immunofluorescence for the rapid differential detection of
human IgM and IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi from serum and plasma
specimens from patients suspected of B. burgdorferi infection. This qualitative test is
intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of Lyme disease. A negative result does not
preclude infection with B. burgdorferi. All positive results for IgM and/or IgG should be
further tested by a corresponding second-tier western blot assay. Test results are to be
used in conjunction with information obtained from the patient’s clinical evaluation and
other diagnostic procedures.
Sofia Lyme Control Set:
The Sofia Lyme Control Set is intended for use as assayed quality control materials to
verify the performance of the Sofia Lyme FIA test system.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use(s)
I. Device Description:
The Sofia Lyme FIA is an immunofluorescence-based, lateral flow assay for detection of
IgM and/or IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in patient specimens. Reagents for the
assay are ready-to-use and provided in the kit.
The assay uses a bidirectional test strip format to detect both IgM and IgG antibodies to B.
burgdorferi. One side of the test strip detects IgM antibodies to B. burgdorferi and the other
side of the test strip detects IgG antibodies to B. burgdorferi.
To perform the test, the patient specimen (30 μL serum/plasma) is added to a pre-filled
Reagent Vial. The diluted sample (100 μL) is then dispensed into the round sample well
located near the center of the Test Cassette. The Test Cassette is loaded into the Sofia
instrument for an automatically defined development time (WALK AWAY Mode) or pre-
incubated on the bench top prior to loading into Sofia (READ NOW Mode). Sofia scans the
test strip, analyzes the fluorescent signal, and then displays two (2) test results: IgM
(positive, negative or invalid) and IgG (positive, negative or invalid). As an option, the
results are automatically printed on the integrated printer.

--- Page 3 ---
Each Sofia Lyme FIA kit will contain one Positive and one Negative Control—each provided
in separate dropper bottles. The external controls will be available separately as well in a
Sofia Lyme Control Set. The Positive and Negative QC controls are formulated with patient
Lyme IgM and IgG positive serum that are diluted into 1X PBS, and 0.3% Microcide is
added to the solution as an antimicrobial. To use External Controls, two drops from the
Negative or Positive Control are added to the round sample well located near the center of
the cassette. The cassette is then treated in the same manner as a cassette containing a patient
sample. The Positive and Negative Control each require their own cassette.

h. Cross-Reactivity:
The cross-reactivity of the Sofia Lyme FIA was evaluated with 17 disease state
sample types for possible interference with the Sofia Lyme FIA assay. Samples were
characterized and obtained from commercial vendors and did not include any first or
second tier Lyme testing results. The total number of each disease state sample type,
as well as the number of positives observed with the Sofia Lyme FIA is summarized
in the table below.

i. Quality Controls/ Matrix Effects
The Sofia Lyme External positive and negative quality controls are individual bottles
manufactured to generate positive IgG and IgM results, and negative IgG and IgM results.
The Sofia Lyme QC materials simulate the composition of patient samples as closely as
possible in order to minimize matrix effects and correctly reflect the expected
performance with patient samples. The positive and negative QC controls are
formulated with patient serum samples that are diluted into 1X PBS, filled into dropper
bottles and added dropwise to the Sofia Lyme FIA test device. Unlike a patient sample,
0.3% Microcide is added to the external control solutions to act as an antimicrobial.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate matrix effects other than the analyte that may
influence the measured value of the analyte in the positive and negative external quality
controls. This protocol is based on the FDA Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff
Assayed and Unassayed Quality Control Material: June 7, 2007.
This study addressed the following potential effects:

· Determine if there was any bias of the external control matrix relative to the
natural sample. Demonstrate that the manufacturing formulation that includes
0.3% Microcide did not alter the properties of the sample and still reflects similar
performance compared to natural human specimens.
· Demonstrate that the external quality control solution result output was similar
to the sample result output regardless of the preparatory and operational steps
that are required.
· Demonstrate the precision of the manufactured positive and negative controls
over a span of 5 days.

In addition to the above studies, the external controls were used daily or as described in
the package insert in the following studies, and performed as expected:
Blood Tube Matrix Comparison Precision
Reproducibility Cross-Reactivity
Interfering Substances Read Now vs Walk Away
Specimen Volume control Development Time
Diluted Sample Volume
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device: prospective
A prospective study was performed on 678 samples to establish the clinical
performance of the assay. Of these, 178 samples were prospectively-collected and
500 were frozen samples previously submitted for Lyme testing and sequentially
retained without regard to results. At each of three laboratories, samples were tested
in parallel using a commercially available Lyme IgM and IgG EIA method
(predicate) and the Sofia Lyme FIA. Possible results for the predicate assay were
negative, positive or equivocal. Possible results for the Sofia Lyme FIA were negative
or positive. Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) was calculated between Sofia Lyme
FIA positive results and predicate positive and equivocal results because the Centers
for Disease Control (CDC) recommended 2-tier Lyme testing algorithm calls for first
tier positive and equivocal results to be tested by a second tier western blot assay.
Combined results from the three sites are shown below:

western blot
2 Additional Information: Four specimens that were negative by the predicate were positive by Sofia
Lyme FIA and confirmed positive by western blot

sample, for which there were 21 donors. Five replicates from each donor were used.
The comparative matrix qualitative IgM and IgG results demonstrate that four (4)
whole blood collection tube types, (serum (RED), serum (TIGER), sodium heparin,
and lithium heparin tubes) are not significantly different when compared to the serum
matrix IgM and IgG results.
The EDTA collection tube qualitative results were significantly different when
compared to the serum matrix results. This difference was most pronounced in
samples that were evaluated at the C5 level.

Well-characterized clinically or culture confirmed Lyme disease serum samples were
tested with the Sofia Lyme FIA. The results were compared to those obtained with
the predicate Lyme IgG and IgM assays. The samples include the following patient
populations:
• Category 1a: Initial (acute) samples from patients with documented erythema
migrans (EM) or culture positive ˂1 month after symptom onset.
• Category 1b: Initial (acute) samples from patients with documented erythema
migrans (EM) or culture positive 1-2 months after symptom onset.
• Category 1c: Initial (acute) samples from patients with documented erythema
migrans (EM) or culture positive 2-3 months after symptom onset.
• Category 2: Convalescent samples from patients with documented erythema
migrans (EM) or culture positive 3-12 months after appearance of
symptoms.
• Category 3: Late Lyme (˃1 year) neurological or Arthritic.
Results are reported as Lyme IgG and/or Lyme IgM positive or negative by Sofia for
each sample tested. Results are summarized for each test method as “Sofia %
Sensitivity” and “Predicate Device % Sensitivity” including 95% Confidence
Interval for each method. Percent Sensitivity and 95% Confidence Interval are
calculated for each sample sub-group as well as for all groups combined.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
CDC Lyme panel was provided and tested with the Sofia Lyme FIA. First tier testing
on the panel provided by the CDC was completed with a total Lyme antibody assay.
These assay results were reported as positive or negative only, the type of antibody
(IgM or IgG) was not reported. As a result their ability to evaluate the performance of
the Sofia Lyme FIA on the CDC provided panel is limited. Please note that provision
of a panel for testing does not imply an endorsement of the assay by the CDC.
