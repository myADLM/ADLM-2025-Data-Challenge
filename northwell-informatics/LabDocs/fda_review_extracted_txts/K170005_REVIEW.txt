processed, FFPE specimens using a specific heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) method
and incubation with the primary mouse monoclonal antibody PR, Clone PgR 1294. The
procedure employs a series of incubation and wash steps, and a ready-to-use horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-linked visualization reagent. The enzymatic conversion of the added
3,3’-Diaminobenzidine (DAB+) chromogen results in the formation of a visible reaction
product at the antigen site. The tissue slide may then be counterstained with hematoxylin
stain and coverslipped. The slide is then visualized with a light microscope.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra-/Inter-Run Precision:
Studies to assess the intra-run and inter-run precision were conducted using the FLEX
Monoclonal Mouse Anti-Human Progesterone Receptor, Clone PgR 1294, Ready-to-
Use on the Dako Omnis, following the recommended staining procedure with the
EnVision FLEX Visualization System. In each of these studies, 12 different paraffin
embedded tissue blocks of human breast carcinoma were evaluated. The sample set
represented the dynamic range of PR protein expression including 3 cases around the
cut-off. Five runs were performed on 5 non-consecutive days over a period of at least
20 days, each with 3 sections. Each run also included 1 section from each block that
was stained with a negative control reagent. Positive staining was defined as ≥ 1 %
of tumor nuclei stained at any intensity. The results for both intra-run and inter-run
were reported as overall agreement and the lower bound of the two-sided 95%
confidence interval (95% CI). The acceptance criteria for the endpoint were at least
85% at the lower bound of a two-sided 95% confidence interval, using Wilson score
confidence intervals.
The acceptance criteria were met, as staining calls for each tissue block stained with
Anti-PR, Clone PgR 1294 did not differ within or between runs, and the slides stained
with the negative control reagent were reported to have negative staining.
Inter-Laboratory Reproducibility:
Three sites with 1 investigator each evaluated tissue sections from a set of 20
different breast cancer specimens with approximately equal distribution of PR
positive and negatives cases with 2 specimens around the cut-off. A fourth site was
later added which tested 19 of the 20 original tissue sections; one was removed due to
tissue degradation. Each site performed staining on 5 non-consecutive days over at
least 20 days.
The results for the inter-laboratory reproducibility study were reported as positive and
negative percent agreements (PPA and NPA) and the corresponding two-sided 95%
5

evaluated across 3 manufactured lots of antibody, using 30 human breast carcinoma
tissue samples with differing levels of PR expression, including 6 specimens around
the cut-off. Samples were tested in triplicate for each lot for a total of 9 serial
sections per specimen. The results were reported as positive percent agreement
(PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) with the two-sided 95% confidence
intervals (95% CI). The acceptance criteria for the endpoints were at least 85% at the
lower bound of a two-sided 95% confidence interval, using Wilson score confidence
intervals.
For all the studies, staining calls for each tissue block stained with Anti-PR, Clone
PgR 1294 did not differ within lots or between lots, and the slides stained with the

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability:
Real-time stability tests using 3 lots of the device and simulated ship-stress tests
using 1 lot of the device were conducted to determine the shelf life of the reagent.
Additionally, all 3 lots were subjected to in-use/onboard testing with each lot being
subjected to a minimum of 80 hours of time on-board the instrument. Based on the
testing, the current product shelf-life is set at 12 months with 80 hours of on-board
stability.
Controls:
Positive and negative tissue controls should be run simultaneously using the same
protocol as the patient specimens in each staining run. Ideally, the positive controls
should include a low to moderate PR-expressing breast carcinoma tissue. As an
alternative, benign cervix may also be used. Studies on formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded cervix have shown variations in progesterone receptor expression based
on the menstrual cycle. For negative tissue controls, colon epithelium or endothelium
present in cervix or breast carcinoma may be used. In addition, each case should
have a negative reagent control slide included in the staining run.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Three samples from 30 tissue types for a total of 90 samples were stained with the
FLEX Monoclonal Mouse Anti-Human Progesterone Receptor, Clone PgR 1294,
Ready-to-Use on the Dako Omnis, using the recommended staining procedure with
EnVision FLEX Visualization System. The cell types that most commonly
demonstrated nuclear positivity were epithelial cells, stromal cells, and interstitial
cells. Nuclear PR expression was also observed in breast glandular cells, cervix
stromal cells, endometrium (epithelial, muscle, and stromal cells), the fallopian tube
(epithelial and stromal cells), ovary (epithelia and stromal cells), pancreas insular
cells, prostate (epithelial and stromal) , and uterus (smooth, stromal, and glandular
cells). Low nuclear PR expression (< 10% of cells) was observed in colon smooth
muscle cells, the pituitary, salivary gland, testis stromal cells, and urinary bladder
stromal cells. Weak cytoplasmic immunoreactivity was also observed in adrenal
9

glomerular cells.
f. Assay cut-off:
A positive staining result is defined as ≥1% of tumor cell nuclei staining of any
intensity and a negative result is <1% tumor cell nuclei staining of any intensity.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
This study was a three-site, blinded, randomized, comparative study using 300
FFPE breast cancer specimens containing differing levels of PR expression.
Samples were run on both the current assay, FLEX Monoclonal Mouse Anti-
Human Progesterone Receptor, Clone PgR 1294, Ready-to-Use (Dako Omnis),
and on the predicate, FLEX Monoclonal Mouse Anti-Human Progesterone
Receptor, Clone PgR 636, Ready-to-Use, (Dako Link) according to their
respective instructions for use. In total, there were 600 stained sections (300 per
device). Twenty-two slides were excluded from analysis due to insufficient or
absent invasive tumor cells or tissue shredding, resulting in a total of 289
specimens tested per device. Appropriate positive and negative control slides
were included. Stained slides were interpreted by pathologists and the intensity
and the proportion of cells staining were recorded. PR expression in DCIS also
was evaluated. Positive staining was defined as ≥ 1 % of tumor nuclei stained at
any intensity.
The acceptance criteria for the PPA and NPA endpoints were at least 85% at the
lower bounds of the two-sided 95% confidence intervals, using Wilson score
confidence intervals. The results were a PPA of 96.7% with a lower bound of the
two-sided 95% confidence interval being 93.2% and an NPA of 100% with a
lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval being 95.4%. A table of
the results is shown below.
