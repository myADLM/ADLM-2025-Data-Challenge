L. Test Principle:
Rabbit monoclonal anti-human antibody ER α, Clone EP1, specifically binds to the estrogen
receptor-α antigen located in the nuclear region of cells of a variety of normal and neoplastic
tissues. Automated immunohistochemical (IHC) staining on the Dako Omnis instrument is
performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human breast cancer specimens
using a specific heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) method and incubation with the
primary rabbit monoclonal antibody ER α, Clone EP1. The procedure employs a series of
incubation and wash steps, a ready-to-use horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked visualization
reagent. The enzymatic conversion of the added 3,3’-Diaminobenzidine (DAB+) chromogen
results in the formation of a visible reaction product at the antigen site. After the IHC
staining, specimens may be counterstained, cover slipped, and then visualized with a light
microscope.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra-/Inter-Run Precision:
Studies to assess the intra-run and inter-run precision were conducted using the FLEX
Monoclonal Rabbit Anti-Human Estrogen Receptor α, Clone EP1, Ready-to-Use
(Dako Omnis), according to the instructions for use. In each of these studies, 12
different FFPE tissue blocks of human breast carcinoma were evaluated at one site.
The sample set represented the dynamic range of ER protein expression including 3
cases around the cut-off. Five runs were performed on 5 non-consecutive days over a
period of at least 20 days. Each run also included one section from each block that
was stained with a negative control reagent (NCR). Positive staining was defined as
≥ 1 % of tumor nuclei stained at any intensity.
The acceptance criteria for the percent agreements were at least 85% lower bounds of
the two-sided 95% confidence intervals, using Wilson score. All specimens stained
with the NCR were negative with no specific staining and < 1 background staining
intensity. All specimens stained with ERα, Clone EP1 antibody had 100% overall
agreement with regard to the ER status (positive and negative) for both intra- and
inter-run precision.
Inter-Laboratory Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was evaluated at 4 sites with one pathologist each. At 3 sites, tissue
sections from a set of 20 different breast cancer specimens (8 positive, 8 negative, and
4 near the cutoff) were evaluated. The fourth site assessed 17 of the 20 tissue
specimens; 3 were excluded due to lack of remaining tissue and tissue degradation.
Each site stained slides on 5 non-consecutive days over at least 20 days. Following
staining, the study slides were blinded and randomized prior to evaluation by a
pathologist.
The results for the inter-laboratory reproducibility study were reported as overall,
positive, and negative percent agreement and the two-sided 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI). The acceptance criteria of > 85% at the lower bound of the two-sided 95%
confidence intervals, using Wilson score confidence intervals, were met. Summary
results of the inter-laboratory reproducibility study for the 17 specimens tested at all 4
laboratories is shown below.

Reagent shelf-life stability was assessed at specified time intervals (0, 8 10, 12, and
14 months) at 2-8 °C using 3 manufactured lots of primary antibody. Additionally,
on-board stability was assessed by placing the same 3 manufactured lots of primary
antibody at 18 °C (in-use conditions) at various time intervals during the course of
the study. One of the 3 antibody lots was also subjected to a transport simulation
test, i.e., 3 freeze/thawing cycles (freeze at -18°C and thaw at 2-8°C) followed by
incubation at 35-39 °C for 16-24 hours and then incubation at 28-32 °C for 4 days.
Results demonstrated a shelf-life stability of 12 months when stored at 2-8 °C, and
on-board stability of 80 hours by the end of the study. The transportation stability
testing met the acceptance criteria of no more than 0.5 grade specific staining
intensity with the aged antibody when compared to baseline and the freshly diluted
EP1 clone antibody.
Controls:
Positive (breast carcinoma or benign cervix) and negative controls (normal colon
or endothelium of breast carcinoma or benign cervix) should be performed with
each staining run. The pathologist is responsible for assuring that the assay is
performing properly.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Three independent samples from 30 normal tissue types were tested with the ERα,
Clone EP1 and Dako EnVision FLEX visualization system. Results demonstrated
negative immunoreactivity with most tissues expected to be negative, and positive
nuclear staining in a subset of normal cells from seven tissue types including
epithelial cells and/or stromal cells from breast, cervix, esophagus, ovary, prostate,
tonsil and uterus. The distribution of ERα, Clone EP1 normal tissue reactivity is

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A blinded, randomized concordance study was conducted at 2 sites using 250
FFPE samples, split evenly (n=125) between each site, and tested with both the
subject and predicate devices according to the instructions for use. Breast cancer
tissue samples were pre-screened with the predicate to ensure that there was an
approximately equal distribution of ERα-positive (n=107) and ERα-negative
specimens (n=123) and that there was a number of samples expressing ERα
staining levels near the cut-off (n=20). Of the 250 samples, 12 samples were
excluded because they did not meet pre-established inclusion criteria (10 samples
were the incorrect specimen type and 2 failed QC).
