professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly
when the preliminary result is positive. The test provides only preliminary test results. A
more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. GC/MS or LC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method.
These tests are intended for over-the counter and for prescription use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription or over-the-counter use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable; this is a visually read single use device.
I. Device Description:
The AssureTech Panel Dip Tests and AssureTech Quick Cup Tests are
immunochromatographic assays that use a lateral flow system for the qualitative
detection of Amphetamine, Oxazepam, Cocaine, Marijuana, Methamphetamine,
Morphine, Oxycodone, Secobarbital, Buprenorphine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine,
Phencyclidine and Methadone (target analytes) in human urine. The tests are the first step
in a two-step process.
The AssureTech Panel Dip Tests comprise two items, a urine collection cup and the dip
card with a plastic casing as the lateral flow device. The AssureTech Quick Cup Tests
comprise a urine collection cup and a quick cup test with a lateral flow device that will
start when the cap is screwed onto cup.

immunoassays. During testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. If a
target drug present in the urine specimen is below the cut-off concentration, it will not
saturate the binding sites of its specific monoclonal mouse antibody coated on gold particles.
The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate in the
test line region and a visible colored line will show up in the test line region. The colored line
will not form in the test line region if the target drug level exceeds its cutoff-concentration
because it will saturate all the binding sites of the antibody coated on the particles. A band
should form in the control region of the devices (coated with anti-mouse antibodies)
regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the sample to indicate that the tests have
been performed properly.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of -100% cut-off, -
75% cut-off, -50% cut-off, -25% cut-off, cut-off, +25% cut-off, +50% cut-off, +75% cut-
off and +100% cut-off. The samples used in the precision studies were prepared by
spiking drug into negative urine samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by
LC/MS. All sample aliquots were blindly labeled by the person who prepared the samples
and who did not take part in the sample testing. For each concentration, tests were
performed two runs per day for 25 days per device in a randomized order. The results
obtained are summarized in the following tables for Oxazepam,
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine and Morphine. The precision data for the remaining
drugs of abuse devices were reported in k153465, k151211, k152025, and k161044.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
External control materials are not supplied with the devices.
The devices are stable at 4 - 30°C for 24 months based on accelerated and real-time
stability studies. Real time stability studies are ongoing.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Specificity:
To test specificity, drug metabolites and other components that are likely to interfere in
urine samples were tested using three batches of each device. The lowest concentration
that caused a positive result for each compound is listed below for Oxazepam,
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine and Morphine. The data for the remaining drugs of
abuse devices were reported in k153465, k151211, k152025, and k161044. There were
no differences observed for different devices.

Potential interfering substances found in human urine of physiological or pathological
conditions were added to drug-free urine and urine with target drug concentrations at
25% below and 25% above cut-off levels. These urine samples were tested using three
lots of each device. The compounds in the following table were tested at a concentration
of 100 µg/mL, and did not show positive or negative interference. Albumin at a
concentration of 100 mg/dL did not cause positive or negative interference. There were
no differences observed for different devices.

Effect of Urine Specific Gravity and Urine pH:
To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine pH, urine samples with 1.000
to 1.035 specific gravity or urine samples with pH 4 to 9 in increments of 1 pH unit were
spiked with target drugs at 25% below and 25% above cut-off levels. These samples were
tested using three lots of each device. For all devices, results were all positive for samples
at 25% above cut-off and all negative for samples at 25% below cut-off.

f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cut-off
concentration appears in the precision/reproducibility section above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies for the AssureTech Panel Dip Tests and the AssureTech
Quick Cup Tests were performed with three laboratory assistants for each device.
Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered clinical samples for each drug.
The samples were blind labeled and compared to LC/MS results. The results are presented
in the tables below for Oxazepam, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine and Morphine. The
data for the remaining drugs of abuse were reported in k153465, k151211, k152025, and
k161044.

Lay-user Study
A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 280 lay persons for each
device format (Panel Dip and Quick Cup) and morphine cut-off of 300 ng/mL and 2000
ng/mL. The lay users who tested the Panel Dip format were different from those who
tested the Quick Cup format. The lay users had diverse educational and professional

backgrounds and ranged in age from 18 to > 50 years. Urine samples were prepared at the
following concentrations; negative, +/-75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of the cutoff by spiking
drugs into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were
confirmed by LC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers and blind-
labeled. Each participant was provided with the package insert, 1 blind labeled sample
and a device. Each device (panel dip and panel cup) containing all drugs was tested.
Results were similar between panel dip and panel cup formats. Below, results are
provided for the Panel Dip format.
