L. Test Principle:
The GLUCOCARD S Blood Glucose Monitoring System operates on the electrochemical
detection of the reaction of glucose with the enzyme glucose oxidase. Glucose in the blood
reacts with the reagent in the test strip, and this produces a small electric current. The
strength of this current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the blood. The meter
measures this current and calculates the blood glucose concentration that is then displayed on
the meter.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed within-run precision studies using venous whole blood
samples spiked with 5 different concentration ranges of glucose; 30-50, 51-110, 111-
150, 151-250, and 251-400 mg/dL. Each glucose concentration range was analyzed
in replicates of 10 on ten different GLUCOCARD W meters, using 3 different test
strip lots in a single day, for a total of 300 tests for each glucose level. Results of the
testing are summarized below:
Glucose Level Lot Mean n SD (mg/dL) %CV

Intermediate (day to day) precision was evaluated by measuring 5 levels of glucose
control solutions (30-50 mg/dL; 51-110 mg/dL, 111-150 mg/dL, 151-250, and 251-
400) over 10 days with 3 test strip lots using ten meters. For each level, 10 replicates
were tested per each lot of test for a total of 300 tests for each glucose level. Results
of the testing are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed using venous whole blood samples. A total of eleven
different concentrations of glucose using three lots of test strips and ten meters were
tested. Samples with the following glucose concentrations (mg/dL) were prepared and
measured: 17.2, 80.9, 132.0, 201.9, 274.1, 339.2, 414.0, 491.5, 571.6, 630.5, and
666.2 mg/dL. Glucose values were compared to those obtained from a laboratory
based comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer)). Each concentration level was tested
30 times. The resulting regression equation based on all measurements is provided
below:
Lot 1: y = 1.021x - 2.494; R2 = 0.999
Lot 2: y = 0.990 - 1.794; R2 = 0.999
Lot 3: y = 1.022x - 3.088; R2 = 0.999
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 20
to 600 mg/dL.
The GLUCOCARD W Blood Glucose Meter displays results between 20 and 600
mg/dL. The message ‘HI’ appears when results are greater than 600 mg/dL and the
message ‘Lo’ appears when a test result is less than 20 mg/dL. The ‘Hi/Lo’ error
message feature was validated using blood glucose samples outside the measuring
range to demonstrate that the feature functions as intended.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The system is traceable to the NIST SRM #917c glucose reference material.
Test Strip Stability:
Test Strip stability was assessed through accelerated and real-time open vial and
closed vial studies. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The manufacturer claims closed vial stability of 24 months and open vial
stability of 6 months when stored at 34–86°F, 10-90% relative humidity. The
labeling instructs the users not to freeze the test strips.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range of the device is 20 to 600 mg/dL. See linearity study in Section
M1b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were carried out by evaluating 27 endogenous and exogenous
substances in venous blood samples with 3 different levels of glucose concentrations;
approximately 60 mg/dL, 120 mg/dL, and 250 mg/dL as measured by a laboratory
based comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer). Each sample was divided into a test
pool containing samples spiked with interferent and untreated samples. Ten meters
and three different test strip lots were used to test 30 replicates per test sample and
compared to control test results obtained from the meter. No interference was defined
by the sponsor as ≤ 10% at each glucose level. Results are presented in the table
below:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
To assess the performance of the GLUCOCARD W Blood Glucose Monitoring
System in the hands of the intended users, the sponsor performed a study at 3 sites
with a total of 300 English speaking participants. Three hundred participants
collected and tested samples from their own fingertip and 240 participants collected
and tested samples from their palm. The participants used only the labeling materials
to inform testing. A total of seven lots of test strips and GLUCOCARD W Blood
Glucose Meters were used. Results were analyzed by comparing the blood glucose
results obtained by the lay users with the GLUCOCARD W Blood Glucose
Monitoring System against results obtained with a laboratory based comparator
method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The glucose concentrations in the samples ranged from
49-467 and 60-468 mg/dL for fingerstick and palm respectively, as measured by the
laboratory based comparator method. The results are summarized below:

The readability assessment using a Flesch-Kincaid analysis for the GLUCOCARD W
A questionnaire designed to evaluate the ease of use of the device and the clarity of
the English language labeling was completed by the subjects that participated in the
lay-user study.. The responses to the Instructions for Use Questionnaire met the
sponsor’s acceptance criteria, with lay users demonstrating acceptable levels of
comprehension of the labeling. Labeling was assessed and determined to be at an 8th
grade reading level or less. The meter manual states that customer service is
available (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) by calling 1-800-566-8558.
Accuracy of the GLUCOCARD W System vs. laboratory based comparator method at
extreme glucose values:
To assess the performance of the system with extreme glucose concentrations the
sponsor altered 100 capillary whole blood samples, by spiking or allowing samples to
glycolyse, to achieve glucose concentrations below 80 mg/dL and above 250 mg/dL.
Fifty samples were allowed to glycolyze to achieve glucose concentrations of 19.5 to
78.5 mg/dL and 50 samples were altered to achieve glucose concentrations of 259 to
568 mg/dL, as measured by a laboratory based comparator method (YSI 2300
analyzer). Results were analyzed by comparing the blood glucose results obtained on
the GLUCOCARD W Blood Glucose Monitoring System against results obtained
with a laboratory comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The data is summarized
below:
Glucose Concentrations ≤ 80 mg/dL
Within ± 5 mg/dL Within ± 10 mg/dL Within ± 15 mg/dL
44/50 (88%) 49/50 (98%) 50/50 (100%)
Glucose Concentrations ≥ 250 mg/dL

27/50 (54%) 41/50 (82%) 50/50 (100%) 50/50 (100%)
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The range of a normal fasting blood glucose level for non-diabetic adults is less than 100.
Two (2) hours after a meal, the range of a normal blood glucose level for non-diabetic
adults is less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L).

acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is
cautioned not to use the meter and to contact customer support if the control result falls
outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study:
To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the Glucocard W Blood Glucose Monitoring
System, venous whole blood samples were adjusted to hematocrit levels of 20%,
35%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 42%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65% and 70%. Each hematocrit
level was tested at five glucose concentration intervals (45, 67, 134, 200, 336 mg/dL).
A single glucose determination for each sample aliquot was made using three
different lots of test strips tested with ten different meters and compared to values
obtained using a laboratory analyzer (YSI 2300 analyzer). The percent biases relative
to laboratory based comparator method demonstrated acceptable performance across
the claimed hematocrit range of 20-70%.
2. Altitude Study:
An altitude study was conducted at two different locations at two different altitudes
(Hsinchu City at sea level-377 feet and Mt. Hehuan at 10,335 feet). At each altitude,
venous blood samples at six glucose concentrations (47.8, 72.2, 147.7, 242.1, 388.0,
and 475.3 mg/dL) were tested using three lots of test strips and ten meters. The results
obtained using the GLUCOCARD W Blood Glucose monitoring system were
compared to results obtained using a laboratory based comparator method (YSI 2300
analyzer). The results demonstrate acceptable bias to the laboratory based comparator
method to support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 10,335 feet (3150
meters) have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements on the
GLUCOCARD W Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
3. Sample Volume:
The sponsor performed a study to support the claimed minimum sample volume for
the GLUCOCARD W Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Blood samples with three
levels of glucose (60, 110, and 225 mg/dL) were tested at six sample volumes (0.1,
0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, and 10.0 μL) using 3 test strip lots and 10 meters. The values
obtained using the GLUCOCARD W Blood Glucose Monitoring System were
compared to values obtained using the laboratory based comparator method (YSI
2300 analyzer). The meter has an error feature (E13) that is displayed when not
enough blood is added to the test strip. This feature was validated and was shown to
function as intended. Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.5 μL.

4. Temperature and Humidity Studies:
The sponsor performed operating conditions studies using venous blood samples at
three glucose concentrations (67, 134, and 336 mg/dL) to evaluate temperatures from
5°C to 45°C and relative humidity (RH) from 10 % to 90 % RH. Four temperature
and humidity combinations were tested including low temperature/low humidity, low
temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low humidity, and high
temperature/high humidity. The results from the GLUCOCARD W Blood Glucose
Monitoring System were compared to the laboratory based comparator method (YSI
2300) and percent bias calculated. Results demonstrated that glucose measurements
on the GLUCOCARD W Blood Glucose Monitoring System were not significantly
affected by the tested conditions. The results support the claims in the labeling that
the system can be used in temperature conditions of 46-104˚F (8°C to 40°C) and
relative humidity between 10 to 90%.
5. Sample Perturbation:
The sponsor performed sample perturbation studies using venous whole blood
samples comparing meter readings to results from the laboratory-based comparator
method (YSI 2300 analyzer). Results were obtained without perturbation of the test
strip and various methods of perturbation. The results support that the performance of
GLUCOCARD W Blood Glucose Monitoring System is acceptable when samples are
perturbed.
6. Intermittent Sampling:
The sponsor assessed the performance of the device when intermittent sampling
occurs using venous whole blood samples comparing meter readings to results from
the laboratory based comparator method (YSI). Results were obtained by adding
samples to the test strip that were less than the required volume followed by a second
sample application to the test strip The results support that the GLUCOCARD W
Blood Glucose Monitoring System does not provide blood glucose values when
samples are intermittently applied. The labeling indicates that the user should not
reapply or apply more sample after the testing has begun..
7. Testing with Used Test Strips:
The sponsor assessed the performance of the device when used test strips were
inserted into the meter using capillary blood and control solutions. Each test resulted
in an error code. The results support that the performance of the GLUCOCARD W
Blood Glucose Monitoring System is acceptable when used test strips are inserted
into the meter.

8. Infection Control and Robustness Studies:
The GLUCOCARD W Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for single
patient home use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials
comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrating
complete inactivation of viral hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant,
Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes (EPA Reg. No: 67619-12). Robustness
studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in
performance or external materials of the meter after 160 cleaning and disinfection
cycles designed to simulate 3 years of single-patient use (approximately one cleaning
and disinfection cycle per week). Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for
the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
9. EMC Testing:
The sponsor provided appropriate documentation certifying that electromagnetic
(EMC) testing was performed and the GLUCOCARD W Blood Glucose Monitoring
System were found to be compliant.
10.This device was cleared after the FDA issued final guidance documents for
prescription use blood glucose monitoring systems (BGMS) and over-the-counter use
blood glucose monitoring systems (SMBG). However, the recommendations in the
guidance documents were not followed for this device since the studies were
conducted prior to the finalization of the guidance documents.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
