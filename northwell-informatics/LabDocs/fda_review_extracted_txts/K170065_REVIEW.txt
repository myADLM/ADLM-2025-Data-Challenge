L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA® Chemistry Total Bilirubin_2 (TBIL_2) method is based on a chemical
oxidation method using vanadate as an oxidizing agent. The bilirubin is oxidized by vanadate
at about pH 2.9 to produce biliverdin. In the presence of the detergent and the vanadate, both
conjugated (direct) and unconjugated bilirubin are oxidized. This oxidation reaction causes
the decrease in the optical density of the yellow color, which is specific to bilirubin. The
decrease in optical density at 451/545 nm is proportional to the total bilirubin concentration
in the sample. The concentration is measured as an endpoint reaction.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision for the ADVIA® Chemistry Total Bilirubin_2 (TBIL_2) was previously
established in k063845.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated according to CLSI EP06-A. A high serum pool was prepared
by spiking human serum with unconjugated bilirubin at a known concentration. A
low serum pool was prepared by dilution of human serum with saline. Dilutions were
prepared by mixing different proportions of the high and low serum pools to create
nine (9) samples (0, 5, 9.9, 14.8, 19.8, 24.7, 29.6, 34.5, and 39.2 mg/dL), which
spanned the assay range. Samples were assayed in triplicate and the mean result was
compared to the expected values determined by the dilution scheme. Linear
regression analysis of the mean observed concentration and expected values is
summarized in the table below.
Slope y- intercept r
0.999 0.0510 0.999
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ADVIA® Chemistry Calibrator, traceable to the AACC reference method
(Doumas), was previously cleared in k030169.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were
determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2. The LoB, LoD, and LoQ for bilirubin
were determined by running replicate measurements on blank and low level analyte
serum samples using three reagent lots, one calibrator lot, one system, and one
operator across multiple days.
LoB was determined by running 4 blank samples in 5 replicates over 3 days (for a
total of 60 replicates per lot). LoD and LoQ were determined by testing 4 low analyte
samples in 20 replicates over 3 days. LoB and LoD were calculated
nonparametrically. The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was calculated for each reagent lot
with the maximum LoQ across all reagent lots taken as the LoQ for the assay. The
results are summarized in the table below.
LoB LoD LoQ
0.02 mg/dL 0.06 mg/dL 0.08 mg/dL
The measuring range of the assay is 0.15 - 35.1 mg/dL and is supported by the
linearity and detection limit studies.

neonates were evaluated according to CLSI EP7-A2 using one reagent lot and one
calibrator lot.
Interference from cyanokit and 3 endogenous compounds was evaluated using native
serum samples with low (~ 1 mg/dL) and high (~10 mg/dL) bilirubin levels. Bilirubin
samples were prepared by spiking a native serum pool with approximately 1 mg/dL
or 10 mg/dL bilirubin. Test samples were prepared by spiking each drug or
endogenous substance (at least five concentrations per interferent) into the low and
high bilirubin samples. Test samples were assayed in triplicate and the mean
concentration of bilirubin for each interferent concentration was compared to control
samples containing no interferent. The sponsor defined significant interference as
greater than or equal to 10% difference between the test and control samples.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP09-A3. The
levels of total bilirubin were measured using the ADVIA® Chemistry Total
Bilirubin_2 (TBIL_2) and a legally marketed comparator method with an assay
measuring range of 0.146 - 35.1 mg/dL.
One hundred and nineteen (119) serum samples from neonates with ages of 5 hours to
8 days were tested. The range of samples tested was 0.8 - 26.6 mg/dL and included
five spiked samples. Data were analyzed using a weighted Deming linear regression.

Bias at the medical decision levels (MDLs) were calculated from the linear regression
equation. MDL concentrations (bias) are as follows: 1.0 mg/dL (-0.2 mg/dL), 8.0
mg/dL (0.2 mg/dL), 13.0 mg/dL (0.5 mg/dL), and 17.0 mg/dL (0.8 mg/dL).
