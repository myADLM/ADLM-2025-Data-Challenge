L. Test Principle:
Quantitative measurement of glucose within whole blood using the Tyson Bio HT100/ Tyson
Bio HT100-B Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems, an amperometric biosensor, begins with a
small drop of blood. This blood sample is then placed onto the Tyson Bio HT100 Test Strip
where it is diffused and solvated into the reagent layer, which contains glucose
dehydrogenase, potassium ferricyanide and nonreactive ingredients. Glucose in the sample
reacts with glucose dehydrogenase and potassium ferricyanide. Electrons are generated
producing a current, which is proportional to the glucose in the sample. This current is then
measured and correlated to the glucose concentration within the whole blood sample.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
The two systems in this submission are identical except for the presence or absence of
blue tooth functionality and the name; therefore, performance data provided in this
section using the Tyson Bio HT100 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is applicable to
both systems.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed repeatability precision studies (within-run precision) using
pooled venous whole blood samples spiked with glucose to eight glucose -
concentration ranges (20-29 mg/dL, 30-50 mg/dL, 51-110 mg/dL, 111-150 mg/dL,
151-250 mg/dL, 251-400 mg/dL, 401-500 mg/dL, and 501-600 mg/dL). Each
glucose sample was measured in replicates of 10 using 3 test strip lots and 10 meters
for a total of 300 tests for each glucose level. Results are summarized below:

Intermediate (between day) precision was evaluated using 3 lots of test strips and
10 meters. Glucose control solutions in three concentration ranges were used (60-
80 mg/dL, 96-114 mg/dL and 280-420 mg/dL). Each sample was tested over 10
days with each meter, for each test strip lot, resulting in a total of 100
measurements per lot and 300 measurements per glucose level. Results are
summarized below:
Glucose Strip n Mean SD % CV
Concentration lot (mg/dL) (mg/dL)

30-50 1 100 47.3 3.0 6.4
2 100 48.2 3.1 6.5
3 100 49.8 3.2 6.5

2 100 347.5 10.2 2.9
3 100 342.1 10.3 3.0
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed using venous whole blood adjusted to 12
different glucose concentrations ranging from 22.8 to 639.4 mg/dL (22.8
mg/dL; 52.9 mg/dL; 81.1 mg/dL; 120.6 mg/dL; 183.1 mg/dL; 255.5 mg/dL;
326.3 mg/dL; 404.3 mg/dL; 466.3mg/dL; 546.5 mg/dL; 586.8 mg/dL; 639.4
mg/dL). Each sample was measured in replicates of 10 with 3 test strip lots and
30 Tyson Bio HT100 blood glucose meters. The values were compared to a
laboratory comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The evaluation yielded the
following regression analysis:
Lot Slope y-intercept R2
1 0.9996 4.5779 0.9968
2 0.9955 4.5691 0.9973
3 0.9930 4.6833 0.9961
The results of the study support the claimed glucose measurement range of 20 to
600 mg/dL. If a sample result is less than 20 mg/dL the result is flagged by the
meter as “LO” and if a sample result exceeds 600 mg/dL the result is flagged by
the meter as “HI”. The ‘HI/LO’ error message feature was validated to
demonstrate that the feature functions as intended.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Tyson Bio HT100 Blood Glucose Monitoring System and the Tyson Bio HT100-
B Blood Glucose Monitoring System are traceable to a certified glucose reference
material (NIST 965b).
Test Strip Stability:
Test strip open vial and closed vial stability was assessed in real-time studies and is
ongoing. The testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to
be acceptable. The manufacturer claims vial shelf life stability of 1 month and
open-vial stability of 1month when stored at 39.2 to 86°F (4-30°C) and relative
humidity (RH) of 10-90%. The labeling states: Do not freeze.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20-600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity study
(M.1.b above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by spiking endogenous and exogenous
substances into venous whole blood. Each potential interferent was tested at 3
glucose levels (50-100 70 mg/dL, 110-140 mg/dL and 250-350 mg/dL as
measured on the YSI 2300 Analyzer) using 3 test strip lots measuring each
sample in replicates. The % difference between the test sample and the control
sample was calculated. The substances tested and the highest concentrations
tested with no significant interference (defined by the sponsor as ≤ 10% bias)
are summarized in the table below:
Highest tested concentration with

To assess the performance of the Tyson Bio HT100 Blood Glucose Monitoring
System in the hands of the intended users, a study was performed at one clinical site
using three test strip lots with 121 untrained lay user participants that obtained their
own fingerstick, palm and forearm samples. Each subject performed testing on their
own sample and results were compared to those obtained by a health care
professional on the YSI 2300. The range of glucose values for the samples as
measured by YSI was 35 to 348 mg/dL. The results relative to the YSI are
summarized below:

5. Calibration:
There is no calibration required by the user for the Tyson Bio HT100 Blood Glucose
Meter and the Tyson Bio HT100-B Blood Glucose Meter. The meters are automatically
coded.
6. Quality Control:
Three levels of controls are available for use with this meter. The control solutions are
sold separately. The control solution range for each control level is printed on the test
strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside
these ranges. The Tyson Bio HT100/HT100-B Blood Glucose meters may be set in a
Control Solution test mode by pressing a button; the control results will not be included
in any day average calculation when the meter is set in the Control Solution test mode.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit
The effect of different hematocrit levels on the Tyson Bio HT100 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System was evaluated using venous whole blood samples with hematocrit
levels of 9-71% (9, 14, 19, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 61, 66 and 71%) at 5 concentrations
of glucose (27, 64, 134, 224 and 375 mg/dL). Three test strips lots were evaluated with
10 meters. Each sample was tested in replicates for each hematocrit level and glucose
levels. For each blood sample, individual glucose readings taken on the Tyson Bio
HT100 glucose meter were compared to YSI comparator values to calculate the bias. The
% bias of the Tyson Bio HT100 Blood Glucose meter results relative to YSI
demonstrated adequate performance to support the claimed hematocrit range of 10-65%.
The meter has an Hct H and Hct L feature that was validated to demonstrate that the
feature functions as intended.
2. Altitude Testing
To evaluate the effects of altitude on the Tyson Bio HT100 Blood Glucose Monitoring
System, venous blood samples were altered to 9 glucose concentrations intervals (47-53,
75-85, 110-120, 175-195, 245-265, 315-335, 380-410, 450-480, and 520-555 mg/dL) and
tested at 164, 5719 and 10745 feet above sea level. Results obtained were compared with
those obtained with the comparator method (YSI). The results demonstrate acceptable
bias to the comparator to support the claims in the labeling at altitudes up to 10745 feet
have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements.
3. Sample volume study
To assess the minimum sample volume of the Tyson Bio HT100 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System, venous whole blood samples from volunteers were collected with
K3-EDTA vacutainer tubes and were spiked with B-D- Glucose to four glucose
concentrations (54.0, 117.0, 234.0 and 331.0 mg/dL). Blood samples were test with 10
measurements obtained from 10 meter with each level of blood sample using 3 different
lots. Different testing volumes (0.5, 0.7, 1.0 ul) of each level were evaluated for accuracy.

--- Page 14 ---
The study results support the sponsor’s claim that 0.7ul is the minimum sample volume
required. The meter has an insufficient sample volume feature that was validated to
demonstrate that the feature functions as intended.
4. Test System Operating Conditions:
Operating conditions studies were performed using three test strip lots and ten meters,
with venous blood altered to glucose concentrations of 41 mg/dL, 123 mg/dL and 345
mg/dL. Testing with the Tyson Bio HT100 Blood Glucose Monitoring System was
performed at the combination of extremes of claimed temperature and humidity operating
conditions and results compared to an established laboratory method (YSI). Results
support the claims in the labeling that the test system can be used at temperatures from
50° to 104°F (10-40°C) and relative humidity of 10-90%.
5. Infection control studies:
The device system is intended for single-patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed on the external meter materials demonstrating removal of the HBsAg antigen
with the chosen disinfectant, Clorox Bleach Germicidal Wipes (EPA Registration
#67619-12). Robustness studies were performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there
was no change in performance or external materials of the meters after 550 cleaning and
disinfection cycles comprised of 1100 wipes. The robustness studies support 3 years of
single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated
cleaning and disinfection procedures.
6. EMC Testing:
The sponsor provided appropriate documentation certifying that electromagnetic (EMC)
testing was performed and the Tyson Bio HT100 Blood Glucose Monitoring System and
the Tyson Bio HT100-B Blood Glucose Monitoring System were found to be compliant.
7. This device was cleared after the FDA issued final guidance documents for prescription
use blood glucose monitoring systems (BGMS) and over-the-counter use blood glucose
monitoring systems (SMBG). However, the recommendations in the guidance
documents were not followed for this device since the studies were conducted prior to
the finalization of the guidance documents.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
