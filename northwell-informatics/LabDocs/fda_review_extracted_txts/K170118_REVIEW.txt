between the developed colors and calibration colors.
The Scanostics UTI Check Application instructs the user how to perform a UTI test and uses
the built-in smartphone camera to perform color comparison between the test strip and the
calibration squares.
The application guides the user through the test setup steps and prompts the user to apply the
sample to the test strip.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The first precision study was performed in-house with five operators over 10 days using
one iPhone 6 device with the App installed. Each day, each operator tested the Scanostics
UTI Check application with five urine based controls; negative, trace leukocytes (15
cells/µL, near the clinical decision point), low positive nitrite (0.1 mg/dL, near the
clinical decision point), medium leukocytes and nitrite, and high leukocytes and nitrite.
Two replicates were obtained per control, so that a total of 100 measurements were
collected per control sample. Results are described in the tables below:
Leukocyte Results:

In a second precision study, five iPhone 6 devices with the App installed were each
tested with five urine based control solutions; negative, trace leukocytes (near the
clinical decision point), low positive nitrite (near the clinical decision point), medium
leukocytes and nitrite, and high leukocytes and nitrite. 25 replicates were tested for
each device with each control solution (Negative, Medium, High, Low Positive
Leukocytes (15 cells/ µL), and Low Positive Nitrite (0.1 mg/dL). All results were
within expected values.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The lower limit of the device’s reportable range is described in section d (detection
limit). Device performance across the range is described in section a
(precision/reproducibility).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
No traceability is claimed.
The sponsor claims that the device is stable for 18 months when stored at 15-30 C°.
The sponsor instructs the user to use the strip immediately after the foil pouch is
opened.
d. Detection limit:
A sensitivity study was performed in-house to evaluate the lower limits of detection
of the Scanostics UTI Check application for each analyte. Negative urine was spiked
to known concentrations of each analyte and diluted to the analyte concentrations
described in the table below. 30 replicates were obtained for each concentration. The
limit of detection was defined as the lowest concentration tested where at least 80%
of results yielded the trace result for leukocytes or the positive result for nitrite. The
results are summarized below:

e. Analytical specificity:
The CLSI Guideline EP7-A2: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry, Approved
Guideline – Second Edition (2005) was referenced in designing the protocol for
specificity testing. 31 possible exogenous interferences were added to negative urine,
leukocyte positive urine and nitrite positive urine pools and tested using the
Scanostics UTI Check Application.
First, four pools of urine were prepared; negative urine, low positive leukocyte urine
(15 cells/µL), high positive leukocyte urine (500 cells/uL), and low positive nitrite
urine (0.1 mg/dL). Stock solutions of the interferents were then added to the negative
and positive urine pools. Five replicates were obtained for each pool and the results of
the urine pools spiked with interfering agents were compared with the results of the
unspiked samples. Where interference was detected, dilutions were made to
determine the interference threshold.
No interference was observed for the following compounds at the concentrations
evaluated below:

The possible interference of certain endogenous analytes commonly tested in urine on
Leukocyte and Nitrite was tested with protocols following the recommendations in
CLSI Guideline EP7-A2: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry, Approved
Guideline – Second Edition (2005). Each possible interfering substance was tested at
three different concentrations in 10 replicates. Each analyte was first tested at a
specific concentration without the interfering substance present, and then again with
the interfering substance present. The results are summarized below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Three sites were selected to perform the comparison studies. 159 lay users were
recruited to test the Scanostics UTI Check application test system. Laypersons
performed one test with the Scanostics UTI Check application using midstream urine
collection and then collected a sample of their urine for comparison testing by
healthcare professionals (HCPs). HCPs then performed the test using the predicate
method.
In order to evaluate an adequate number of leukocyte and nitrite positive samples, 25
additional users tested their own midstream samples as well as four additional
blinded, unaltered urine samples, for a total of 125 additional samples. All samples
were also tested by an HCP using the predicate method.
Additionally, 14 positive samples were prepared by spiking negative urine with
esterase and with sodium nitrite. Each sample was masked and given to one lay user
(naïve to the test method) for testing.
A total of 298 samples were tested by 184 lay users. The results obtained by the lay
users using the candidate device compared to the results obtained by the HCPs using
the predicate device are summarized below:

O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Smartphone image capture, analysis
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes _X_ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes _X_ or No ________
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes _X_ or No ________
The sponsor has classified their software as a Moderate level of concern. Documentation
provided in this submission adequately addresses requirements for this level of concern.
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with these devices. Samples are applied
directly to the urinalysis strips as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The device is intended to be used with a freshly collected urine sample (midstream
collection). The App instructs the user to image the test strip (to obtain a test result) no
more than two minutes after sample application.
5. Calibration:
Color coded backing card serves to reference the color interpretation of the strip, to
normalize for lighting conditions.
6. Quality Control:
Scanostics UTI Check performs two quality control checks on your device’s optics
during image processing with a positive and negative control on the backing card.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Dip time study: A dip time study was performed using low positive samples (near clinical
decision points) and negative control solutions, including nitrite and leukocyte samples of
15 cells/µL and nitrite samples at 0.1 mg/dL. Test strips were dipped in control samples
for 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, and 30 seconds prior to imaging by the App to determine the impact
of dipping time on reported results. This study indicated that dipping times between two
and 30 seconds did not impact results.
2. Assay time study: An assay time study was performed using positive and negative control
solutions, including nitrite and leukocyte samples of 15 cells/µL and nitrite samples at 0.1
mg/dL. In this study, test strips were imaged by the App at 30 second intervals between
two and five minutes after sample application. This study indicated that assay times
between 2:00 and 2:30 did not did not impact results, and a positive bias (an increase in
results of +1 color block) is observed in the leukocyte test at 3:00. Based on these
results, a timer is included in the App that instructs the user to image the test strip two
minutes after wetting the strip, and will alert the user if the image of the strip has not
been captured within three minutes after strip wetting (instructing the user to discard the
test strip and start again).
3. Humidity Study: Stability studies were performed at 15 and 30 C° and 20%, 50%, and 70%
relative humidity using positive and negative control solutions, including nitrite and
leukocyte samples of 15 cells/µL and nitrite samples at 0.1 mg/dL. The sponsor
evaluated 20%, 50%, and 70% relative humidity at 30 C°, and evaluated 50% relative
humidity at 15 C°. The sponsor determined that samples were stable for 4 hours at the
temperature and humidity conditions tested.
4. Lighting conditions: The sponsor evaluated the performance of the device in different
lighting conditions (levels ranging from 100 to 500 lux) and demonstrated that the device
works as expected in these lighting conditions. The labeling indicates that testing should
be performed in a well-lit area. The App warns the user if there are shadows detected.
5. The App can also detect if the strip is misaligned and will warn the user when the strip is
not properly aligned.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
