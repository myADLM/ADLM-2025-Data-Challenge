L. Test Principle:
The Rightest GM280 Blood Glucose Monitoring System, Rightest 280B Blood Glucose
Monitoring System, GE 180 Blood Glucose Monitoring System, and GE 182 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System measures glucose amperometrically. The reaction of glucose oxidase and
potassium ferricyanide in the test strip with glucose in the sample produces an electrical
current which is proportional to the amount of glucose in the sample. The meter measures the
current and converts it to the corresponding glucose concentration, which is displayed on the
meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
There are no differences between the Rightest GM280 Blood Glucose Monitoring System,
Rightest 280B Blood Glucose Monitoring System, GE 180 Blood Glucose Monitoring
System, and GE 182 Blood Glucose Monitoring System except for Bluetooth capabilities in
the GM280B and GE182 meters. Therefore, analytical studies were conducted on the
GM280B device to support the four systems.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run (Repeatability)
Within-run precision studies were performed using venous whole blood samples of 5
glucose levels (30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250, 251-400 mg/dL). Samples were
tested ten times with each of three lots of single test strips with 10 meters for a total
of 300 tests per glucose concentration. Results are summarized below:

Intermediate Precision
Intermediate (between run) precision was evaluated using three levels of glucose
control solutions, 3 test strip lots, and 10 meters. Each control solution level was
measured once a day for 10 days with each meter and test strip lot, for a total of 100
replicates per control solution level per test strip lot for a total of 300 replicate for
each glucose control level. Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was assessed with three lots of GS280 Blood Glucose Test Strips. Each test
strip lot was tested with three GM280 Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems using
blood samples spiked to 15 glucose levels (0, 13.7, 24.0, 57.6, 117, 165, 225, 265,
325, 375, 429, 475, 535, 552, and 635 mg/dL). Each sample was measured in
triplicate with each Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM280 and
measured in duplicate with a laboratory method (YSI 2300 glucose analyzer). The
observed meter values were averaged and compared with the mean of duplicate
reference method measurements
The evaluation yielded the following regression equations for each of three lots based
on all samples:
Lot 1: y = 0.9929x + 1.5820 ; R2 = 0.9992
Lot 2: y = 0.9926x +1.1366 ; R2 = 0.9983
Lot 3: y = 0.9917x + 2.3442; R2 = 0.9992
These studies support the claimed analytical measuring range of the systems. If a
sample reading falls outside of the measuring range of the device, a “LO” or “HIGH”
message appears instead of a value. These features were tested and shown to function
as intended.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The systems are traceable to the NIST SRM 917c glucose reference material.
Test Strip Stability
Test Strip stability has been evaluated through accelerated and real-time open vial and
closed vial studies. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable to support the claimed shelf life stability and open vial stability of 24
months from manufacture when stored at 40- 86°F (4-30˚C) and 10-90% relative
humidity.
d. Detection limit:
See the linearity studies (section M.1.b.) above.

e. Analytical specificity:
The interference study for Rightest GM280 BGMS was performed using 2 glucose
concentration levels (50-100 and 250-350 mg/dL) of venous blood samples and 26
interference substances. 10 meters and 3 lots of test strips were used to perform 10
replicates per lot and compared to an established laboratory reference method (YSI
2300 Analyzer). The sponsor defined significant interference as of bias greater than
±10% (vs reference method). The compounds at the concentrations listed below did
not demonstrate significant interference:

Based on these results, the sponsor includes the following in their test strip labeling:
- If you are taking high dose of vitamin C (blood concentration > 3 mg/dL), the
result from your meter may not be correct.
- If you have a condition that may cause your blood levels of uric acid to increase
(uric acid ≥12 mg/dL), such as kidney disease or gout, then the results from your
meter may not be correct.

3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with these devices. Samples are applied
directly to the test strips as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip,
palm or forearm. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary
action.
5. Calibration:
There is no calibration required by the user for the Rightest GM280 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System, Rightest 280B Blood Glucose Monitoring System, GE 180 Blood
Glucose Monitoring System, GE 182 Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The meter is
automatically coded when the test strip is inserted into the meter.
6. Quality Control:
Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. An
acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial labels. The user is
cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges. Control
results are stored along with the blood results. The control solution tests are differentiated
by a control solution symbol.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Sample Volume Study
To evaluate the minimal sample volume of the blood glucose test strips, accuracy of the
system with blood volumes of 0.60 µL, 0.65 µL, 0.70 µL, 0.75 µL, 0.80 µL, 1.00 µL, 1.25
µL, 2.00 µL, and 3.00 µL was assessed. Three blood glucose meters were used in this
assessment and three lots of test strips to evaluate three blood glucose concentrations (50-
75, 80 – 120 mg/dL, and 270 – 330 mg/dL). This testing supported the claimed minimum
sample volume of 0.75for this device and that the sample detection feature functioned
appropriately when the sample volume was <0.75uL.
2. Altitude Study
To evaluate the effects of altitude on system performance, three test strip lots were tested
with 3 meters using three whole blood samples with glucose concentrations of 47.5-52.5,
92-100, and 283-307 mg/dL. The samples were tested at 0, 3280, 6561, and 10745 feet
above sea level. Results obtained were compared with those obtained with an established

--- Page 16 ---
laboratory reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The results demonstrate acceptable bias
relative to the reference method to support the claim in the labeling that altitudes up to
10,745 ft. (3275 meters) do not affect device performance.
3. Hematocrit Study
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using whole blood. Rightest Blood
Glucose Monitoring System GM280/GM280B was tested with venous blood at six
glucose concentration intervals (20-50, 60-80, 135-165, 180-220, 270-330 and 360-440
mg/dL) and nine hematocrit levels (10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 55, 60, 65 and 70%). Each sample
was measured in five replicates for each of three test strip lots also with an established
laboratory comparotor method (YSI).. Results of samples at each hematocrit level were
compared to samples measured with an established laboratory reference method (YSI) and
support the claimed hematocrit range of 20-60%.
4. Test System Operating Conditions
Three Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM280/GM280B Meters were used to
test venous blood sample with three lots of blood glucose test strips. Six test conditions
were used in this study: 50 °F/ 10% RH, 50 °C/ 90% RH, 77 °C/ 10% RH, 77 °C/ 90%
RH, 104 °C/ 10% RH, 104 °C/ 90% RH. The results of this study supported the sponsor’s
claimed operating conditions of 50 °F-104 °F and a relative humidity range of 10% to
90%.
5. EMC Testing
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing
(EMC) had been performed and the device system was found compliant.
6. Infection Control Studies
The device is intended for a single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed on the materials comprising the polycarbonate, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
plus polycarbonate meters by an outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrating
complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Cavi Wipes
disinfecting towelettes (EPA Registration Number 46781-8). Robustness studies were also
performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or
external materials of the meter. The robustness studies were designed to simulate cleaning
and disinfection procedures 8 times a month for a total of 550 times in a meter’s five-year
lifetime. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and
disinfection procedures.

use blood glucose monitoring systems (BGMS) and over-the-counter use blood glucose
monitoring systems (SMBG). However, the recommendations in the guidance documents
were not followed for this device since the submission was received prior to the
finalization of the guidance documents.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
