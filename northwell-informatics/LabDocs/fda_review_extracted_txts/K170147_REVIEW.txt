L. Test Principle:
The Lucica Glycated Albumin-L provides quantitative measurement of glycated albumin
based on an enzymatic method and quantitative albumin measurement by a colorimetric
assay. The glycated albumin value (mmol/mol) is automatically calculated by the test
system using the glycated albumin concentration (µmol/L) and the albumin concentration
(µmol/L).
Measurement of glycated albumin:
The serum sample reacts with a ketoamine oxidase to eliminate endogenous glycated
amino acids. The generated hydrogen peroxide is converted to H O by reaction with
2
peroxidase and hydrogen donor (N, N-Bis (4-sulfobutyl)-3-methylaniline disodium salt).
The treated solution reacts with an albumin-specific protease, which converts glycated
albumin to glycated amino acids. The glycated amino acids react with a ketoamine
oxidase to form glucosone, amino acids, and hydrogen peroxide. The generated hydrogen
peroxide reacts with peroxidase in the presence of N, N-Bis (4-sulfobutyl)-3-
methylaniline disodium salt and 4-aminoantipyrine (4-AA) forming a blue-purple
pigment. Measurement of the absorbance of this blue-purple pigment quantifies the
glycated amino acids produced by glycated albumin.
Measurement of albumin:
The serum sample reacts with the pretreatment solution to convert reduced albumin to
oxidized albumin. The treated solution reacts with bromocresol purple, forming a blue
conjugate of albumin and bromocresol purple. The absorbance of this blue conjugate is
measured to quantify albumin concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
An internal precision study and a multisite precision study at three centers were
performed. Precision studies used three levels of glycated albumin (GA) controls, a
human serum albumin (HSA) pool with a low glycated albumin value, and five native
serum pools. For the internal precision studies, samples were tested with 2 runs per
day, 2 replicates per run over 20 days. Results from different lots were similar.
The precision summary table of glycated albumin values (mmol/mol) for the internal
precision study is shown below.

d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) determination was made using five blank samples that
were measured in replicates of four for five days. Two reagent lots were used. The
LoB was calculated as the mean of 95th and 96th ranked values. The claimed LoB for
GA concentration is 6.9 µmol/L and 3.8 µmol/L for albumin concentration
Limit of Detection:
Eight low-level samples were measured in duplicate for five days using two reagent
lots. The LoD was calculated using the parametric procedure specified by CLSI
EP17-A2. The claimed LoD for GA concentration is 7.9 µmol/L and 7.0 µmol/L for
albumin concentration.
Limit of Quantitation:
Eight low-level serum samples were analyzed in duplicate, twice daily over 14 testing
days with two reagent lots. A precision profile curve as used to specify the GA or
albumin concentration representing 10% CV as the limit of quantitation (LoQ). The
claimed LoQ for GA concentration is 9.7 µmol/L and the claimed LoQ for albumin
concentration is 21.8 µmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed using a normal serum pool and a diabetic serum
pool. Six different concentration levels were prepared for each potential interferent by
mixing high and low level interferent serum pools in varying proportions. Samples
were analyzed in triplicate for glycated albumin concentration, albumin
concentration, and glycated albumin value in a single run. The effect of albumin and
total protein was evaluated by preparing specimens with high or low levels of
albumin and total protein, and spiking glycated albumin at high and low levels. The
level at which there is not significant interference (bias < ±10%) for each analyte with
glycated albumin (mmol/mol) is listed in the table below.

Complications Trial (DCCT) (1, 2). Elevated glycated albumin was associated with
coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke in the ARIC cohort (3). In order to bridge
the assay used in these clinical studies to the candidate device, a study was performed
using n = 1831 samples that were measured by the candidate device and the research
use only glycated albumin assay with a Roche Modular P Chemistry Analyzer. The
performance of the Lucica Glycated Albumin-L assay showed good concordance (r =
0.997) with the research use only glycated albumin assay used in the literature.
