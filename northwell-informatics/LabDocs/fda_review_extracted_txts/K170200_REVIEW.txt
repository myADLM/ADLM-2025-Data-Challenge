L. Test Principle:
The carbon dioxide in the sample reacts with phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in the presence of
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and magnesium to yield oxaloacetic acid (OAA)
and phosphate. In the second reaction, in the presence of malate dehydrogenase (MDH), the
reduced NADH cofactor is oxidized by OAA. The reduced cofactor absorbs strongly at 405
nm, whereas its oxidized form does not. Spectrophotometric determination of the decrease in
absorbance monitored at 405 nm/415 nm, is directly proportional to the total carbon dioxide
concentration in the sample.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was conducted in accordance with the CLSI EP5-A2 guideline.
The precision study was performed utilizing 2 reagent lots, using serum based control
material and human serum samples that were spiked with carbon dioxide
concentrations. Two replicates of each of the control and serum samples were tested
on two separate runs per day over 20 days, leading to the generation of 80 data points
per sample. The mean, SD, and %CV calculated for within-run and total imprecision
for each lot yielded similar results. The results from one representative lot are shown
below.
Mean Repeatability Within-Laboratory
Sample
(mmol/L) SD %CV SD Precision% CV
QC Level 1 30.6 0.1782 0.582 1.62 5.31
QC Level 2 20.5 0.7065 3.426 187 9.07
Serum Level 1 12.0 0.1275 1.065 0.69 5.75
Serum Level 2 26.6 0.1521 0.571 0.85 3.21
Serum Level 3 37.4 0.1949 0.521 0.59 1.58
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity studies were performed in accordance with the CLSI EP6-A guideline.
Samples were prepared by mixing a high spiked serum sample (64 mmol/L CO ) with
2
a low diluted serum sample (2.0 mmol/L CO ) to obtain 11 concentrations. Each
2
sample was assayed in replicates of three using two different Carbon Dioxide Reagent
lots. The results of the linear regression analyses for one representative lot are
summarized below:
y = 1.0192x + 0.0351, R2 = 0.9993
The sponsor claims a linearity range from 8.70 to 40.0 mmol/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Carbon Dioxide Reagent Set is traceable to NIST SRM 351. The CO assay is
2
calibrated by comparing the change in absorbance of the unknown sample to the
change in absorbance of the 30 mEq/L CO standard. The CO standard was
2 2
previously cleared under k936245.

Stability:
Accelerated shelf-life stability, real-time open-vial stability and on-board stability
studies for the Carbon Dioxide Reagent were performed. The protocols and
acceptance criteria for stability were reviewed and are found to be acceptable. The
studies support a shelf life stability claim of 21 months from the date of manufacture
for reagent when stored at 2 to 8°C, an open-vial stability claim for the Carbon
Dioxide Reagent of 28 days when stored at 2 to 8°C, and a reagent on-board stability
claim of 13 days. The real-time shelf-life stability testing is on-going.
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit studies have been carried out in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2
guideline. Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of
Quantification (LoQ) studies were performed on two lots of reagents tested on one
TC-MATRIX analyzer. For the LoB studies, four (4) blank samples were tested in
five replicates over three days. For LoD studies four low CO level samples with
2
target concentrations ranging from 0.92 to 3.68 mmol/L were tested in five replicates
using two lots over three days. For LoQ study, five different samples with target
concentrations ranging from 0.7 to 4.08 mmol/L were tested in replicates of three
using two lots over a three days period.
LoB, LoD and LoQ results are summarized in the following table:

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies have been carried out in accordance with CLSI EP7-A2
guideline. Human serum samples with two (2) different concentrations of carbon
dioxide (20 mmol/L and 35 mmol/L) were used to evaluate interference testing using
two reagent lots. Serum samples with added potential interferents were tested in
replicates of ten (10) and compared to a sample without interferent. The sponsor
defined no significant interference as <10 % difference from the control sample.

Interferent
interference was observed
Hemoglobin 1,000 mg/dL
Total Bilirubin 60 mg/dL
Conjugate Bilirubin 30 mg/dL

The reference interval for Carbon Dioxide was verified by testing human serum from 23
apparently healthy donors in singlicate using two reagent lots. Results of the study
indicate that all values measured are within the expected values of the cited literature,
therefore the reference interval has been verified for the Carbon Dioxide Reagent Set.
