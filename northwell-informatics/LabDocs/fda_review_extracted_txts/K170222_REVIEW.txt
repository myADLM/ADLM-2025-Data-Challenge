H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Refer to Indications for Use.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Rapid TOX Cup II is an in vitro diagnostic drugs of abuse testing device intended
for use in the qualitative detection of the following drugs of abuse testing in a human
urine specimen:
Analyte Calibrator Cutoff (ng/mL)
Amphetamine D-amphetamine 1000
Amphetamine D-amphetamine 500
Barbiturates (Butalbital) Butalbital 300
Benzodiazepines (Oxazepam) Oxazepam 300
Buprenorphine Buprenorphine 12.5
Cocaine Benzoylecgonine 300
Cocaine Benzoylecgonine 150
MDMA MDMA 500
(Methylenedioxymethamphetamine)
Methadone Methadone 300
Methamphetamine D-methamphetamine 1000
Methamphetamine D-methamphetamine 500
Opiates Morphine 2000
Opiates Morphine 300
Oxycodone Oxycodone 100
Phencyclidine Phencyclidine 25
Marijuana 11-nor-Δ9-THC-9- carboxylic-acid 50
Tricyclic Antidepressants Nortriptyline 1000
The test is intended for over-the-counter use.
This assay may yield positive results when barbiturates, benzodiazepines, or tricyclic
antidepressants are ingested at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly
recognized cutoff levels for barbiturates, benzodiazepines, or tricyclic antidepressants in
urine. The assay is not intended to distinguish between prescription use or abuse of these
drugs.
Rapid TOX Cup II provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific alternate
method must be used in order to obtain a more confirmed analytical result. GC/MS is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical and professional judgment should be applied to
any drug of abuse result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.

strip consists of a membrane strip with an immobilized drug conjugate. A colloidal gold-
labeled antibody complex is dried at one end of the membrane. The specifically labeled drug
(drug conjugate) competes for antibody binding sites with drugs or metabolites that may be
present in the urine specimen.
An internal quality control line, comprised of a different antibody/antigen reaction is
contained in on each membrane strip. The control line is not influenced by the presence or
absence of drug analytes in the urine specimen, and therefore, it should be visible in all
samples tested.
In the absence of specified drug(s) in the urine specimen, the colloidal gold-labeled antibody
complex moves with the urine by capillary action to contact the immobilized drug conjugate.
An antibody-antigen reaction occurs forming a visible line in the “test” area. The formation of
two (2) visible lines (control and test lines) occurs when the test is negative or below the cut-
off for the drug.
When a drug analyte is present in the urine specimen, the drug or metabolite will compete
with the immobilized drug conjugate in the test area for the antibody binding sites on the
colloidal gold-labeled antibody complex. If a sufficient amount of drug analyte is present, it
will fill all of the available binding sites, thus preventing attachment of the labeled antibody to
the drug conjugate. The formation of a control line, and the absence of a test line is indicative
of a preliminary positive result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Each analyte for the precision study was tested at the following concentrations: Negative, and
-75%, -50%, -25%, +25%, +50% and +75% of the specific cutoff for each drug assay. The
panels were blinded and randomized prior to testing. Testing was performed using 3 lots of
ABMC test strips and was performed once a day by 3 operators over 12 consecutive days, and
the results of this testing are summarized as follows for each device.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. These devices are intended for qualitative use only.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The device has internal process controls. A control line appears in the control region
confirming that sufficient sample volume has been applied to the test strip and that
the sample has migrated correctly on the test strip. Users are informed that the test is
invalid if the colored line does not appear in the control region. There are no external
controls supplied with the device.
Device stability has been evaluated through accelerated and real-time studies.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The
manufacturer claims that the devices are stable for two years (24 months) when stored
at 2–30º C. Real-time studies are ongoing.
d. Detection limit:
See precision data in Section M1a above for assay performance around the claimed cutoff
concentrations.
e. Analytical specificity:
The cross-reactivity of structurally similar compounds was evaluated in k073078.
Interferences. Potential interference of structurally dissimilar and endogenous
compounds was evaluated in k073078. The following additional compounds were also
tested for interference, where exogenous and endogenous compounds into samples at -
50% and -50% of the cutoff. No positive or negative interference was observed from any
of the following compounds when present at 100,000 ng/mL:
AcetylsalicylicAcid/
Acetaminophen Albumin
Aspirin
Amikacin Ampicillin Arterenal
Atropine Benzoic Acid Bilirubin
Caffeine Creatine Ethanol
Glucose Hemoglobin Lidocaine
Methanol Oxalic Acid Penicillin-G
Phenylpropanalamine Ranitidine Salicylic Acid
Thioridazine Trifluoperazine Uric Acid

Specific gravity and pH
The effect of specific gravity for each analyte was evaluated by testing positive and
negative samples at specific gravities ranging from 1.00 to 1.035. No interference was
observed for all specific gravities tested.
The effect of pH for each analyte was evaluated by testing positive and negative samples
over a range of pH levels. No interference was observed for all pH levels tested.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration appears in the precision section, M.1.a., above.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
A consumer study was performed for all analytes to evaluate the ability of untrained
users to interpret the devices properly when given only the labeling (package insert)
provided with the devices. A total of 430 demographically diverse untrained consumers
at three sites took part in the study, with enrollment and testing over the course of five
(5) days. Each day, individual participants tested two (2) contrived samples using one of
two product configurations. On the last day, 20 participants only tested one (1) contrived
sample.
Samples were created by spiking the analyte into drug-free urine pool. Each sample was
aliquoted into an individual blind-labeled container. The concentrations analyzed for
each analyte and cutoff were negative, 25%, 50%, 75%, 125%, 150%, and 175% of the
cutoff, and were confirmed by a reference method. The results are summarized below:
