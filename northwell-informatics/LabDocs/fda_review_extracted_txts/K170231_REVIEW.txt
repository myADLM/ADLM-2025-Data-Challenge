L. Test Principle:
The iHealth Align Gluco-Monitoring System (BG1) and iHealth Wireless Smart Gluco-
Monitoring System (BG5) measures glucose amperometrically. The reaction of glucose
dehydrogenase and an electron mediator in the EGS-2003 test strip with glucose in the
sample produces an electrical current which is proportional to the amount of glucose in the
sample. The meter measures the current and converts it to the corresponding glucose
concentration, which is displayed by the meter and the iHealth mobile app.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability was evaluated using ten BG1 and ten BG5 meters and three lots of
EGS-2003 test strips. Venous whole blood samples adjusted to five glucose
concentrations of (30-50, 51-110,111-150, 151-250, and 251-400 mg/dL) were tested
in replicates of ten with each meter and strip lot combination resulting in 300
measurements per glucose level. Results are summarized below for each of the test

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was established using nine spiked venous whole blood samples with
Glucose concentrations of 22.2, 38.1, 63.6, 98.2, 172, 236, 356, 422, and 598 mg/dL
as measured on the comparator method, YSI.
Each sample was tested in 5 replicates using EGS-2003 test strips and BG1 or BG5
meters. The liner regression results are presented below:
BG1: y = 0.9761X-3.8574; R2=0.9989
BG5: y = 0.9665x+3.8313; R2=0.9984
The results of the linearity study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement
range of 20-600 mg/dL for both systems. If a sample is less than 20 mg/dL, the result
is flagged by the meters as LO. If a sample result exceeds 600 mg/dL, the result is
flagged by the meters as HI. The Hi and Lo features were validated using blood
glucose samples outside the measuring range of the device and demonstrated that the
features function as intended.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The system is traceable to NIST SRM #917c reference material and calibrated to be

plasma-equivalent.
Test Strip Stability:
Test strip stability was assessed with accelerated studies and on-going real-time
studies. The testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. Testing for the test strips supports the claimed shelf life of 24 months
when stored at 39 to 86ºF (4-30ºC) with relative humidity of 10-85% and 5 month
stability after opening when stored at the same conditions.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study in Section M1b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed interference studies using the iHealth Align Gluco-
Monitoring System (BG1) to support the use of the EGS-2003 test strips with both the
BG1 and BG5 meters. Spiked venous blood samples at two glucose concentrations of
60 and 350 mg/dL were divided into a test pool and a control pool. The potential
interfering substances were added to the test sample at low and high concentrations.
Each sample was measured in 5 replicates using the BG1 meter and EGS-2003 test
strips. The differences between meter results between the test sample and the control
sample were calculated. The table below lists the highest concentration at which no
significant interference (<10%, as defined by the sponsor) was observed for the
substances tested.

The following limitations for use are included in the labeling for the test strip:
· If you are taking acetaminophen containing drugs (Tylenol and other medicines
containing acetaminophen, blood concentrations >5 mg/dL) or Vitamin C
(ascorbic acid, blood concentrations >4 mg/dL) at doses higher than
recommended, these may interfere with your glucose meter and cause you to get
inaccurate results with this system.
· Certain conditions may cause your blood level of uric acid to rise. These
conditions include gout or kidney disease. You should know that if your blood
level of uric acid is high (≥10 mg/dL) then your blood glucose results may be
not reliable. If you are unsure, then ask your healthcare professional.
· Do not use this device during or shortly after receiving xylose absorption
therapy since xylose may cause inaccurate blood glucose results.

3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with fresh capillary whole blood from the finger,
palm, forearm, calf, and thigh only. The sample is applied directly to the test strip and
testing is performed immediately. Sample storage is not required.
5. Calibration:
When using the EGS-2003 test strip, no coding is necessary by the user when using either
the BG1 or BG5 meters.
6. Quality Control:
Three levels of aqueous glucose control solutions are available with this system (iHealth
Glucose Control level 1, level 2, level 3). Level II control is included in the kit and Level
I and III may be purchased separately. The meter automatically recognizes control
materials as separate from patient samples and identifies them as control in the
smartphone application where meter values are displayed and recorded. Controls are not
included in patient glucose averaging. Recommendations on when to test the control
materials and troubleshooting steps if the controls are outside of specifications are
provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test
strip vial label.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the iHealth Align Gluco-
Monitoring System (BG1) and the iHealth Wireless Smart Gluco-Monitoring System (BG5)
was evaluated using venous whole blood samples with hematocrit levels of 20 – 60% (20%,
30%, 42%, 50%, 60%) at glucose to concentrations of 40, 110 and 300 mg/dL. Results of
samples at each hematocrit level were compared to samples with the same glucose
concentration at normal (42%) hematocrit as well as to the corresponding YSI value. The %
bias of the meter results relative to YSI demonstrated adequate performance to support the
claimed hematocrit range of 20 – 60%.
2. Altitude study: Effect of altitude was evaluated using 10 BG1 meters and 10 BG5 meters,
respectively and six venous blood (spiked and glycolyzed) samples from 2 donors at six
glucose concentrations (49, 60, 96, 104, 278, 288 mg/dL). The samples were tested under
conditions to simulate 10744 feet above sea level and sea level (0 feet) as a control. Results
obtained were compared with those obtained with the reference method (YSI). The results
demonstrated acceptable bias to the reference to support the claims in the labeling that
15

--- Page 16 ---
altitudes up to 10,744 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements from
the iHealth Align Gluco-Monitoring System (BG1) and the iHealth Wireless Smart Gluco-
Monitoring System (BG5).
3. Operating Temperature and Humidity: Temperature and humidity operating conditions were
evaluated for temperatures ranging from 41oF-104oF (10℃~40℃), and relative humidity
(RH) from 25%~80% including extreme combinations of temperature and humidity, e.g.
lowest humidity with lowest and highest temperature and highest humidity with lowest and
highest temperature. Protocol and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be
acceptable. The results supported the Sponsor’s claimed operating temperature from 41oF-
104oF and relative humidity range from 25% to 80% for both BG1 and BG5 meters.
4. Infection Control Study:
The iHealth Align Gluco-Monitoring System (BG1) and iHealth Wireless Smart Gluco-
Monitoring System (BG5) is intended for single-patient use. Disinfection efficacy for the
BG1 and BG5 meters was established in k123935 and k110017, respectively, demonstrating
complete inactivation of hepatitis B (HBV) virus using materials comprising the meter and
CaviWipes Disinfecting Towelettes (EPA registration #46781-8). Robustness testing was
performed demonstrating that there was no change in performance or in the external
materials of the meters after 11,000 cleaning and disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one
cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting wipe) to simulate 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling
was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection
procedures. The sponsor provides a disposable sleeve for use with the mobile device to be
used with each test strip, not to be reused and to be disposed of as bio-hazard, therefore no
disinfection studies were required of the mobile device. The sleeve is intended to be used
with the iHealth Align Gluco-Monitoring System (BG1).
5. Sample volume requirements: The minimum sample volume is 0.7 μL. The sponsor
performed a study to verify the test strip sample volume requirement and the test strip fill
error requirement established using BG5 Blood Glucose Meter. Blood samples were tested
at 4 sample volumes (0.4, 0.7, 1.0. 1.5 uL,) and values obtained were compared to YSI
values. Results support the claimed sample volume of 0.7 mL.
6. EMC and electrical safety: As established previously in k153286 (BG1) and k153278 (BG5).
7. The device was cleared after the FDA issued final guidance documents for prescription use
blood glucose monitoring systems (BGMS) and over-the-counter use blood glucose
monitoring systems (SMBG). However, the recommendations in the guidance documents
were not followed for this device since the studies were conducted prior to the finalization of
the guidance documents.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
