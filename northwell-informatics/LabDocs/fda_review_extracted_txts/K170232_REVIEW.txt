I. Device Description:
The AFIAS TSH-SP and the AFIAS TSH-VB test cartridges consist of two closed chambers;
one containing lyophilized detection buffer and the other containing diluent/reconstitution
buffer. Lyophilized detection buffer contains the fluorochrome-labeled anti-human TSH
murine antibodies (0.05 µg) and fluorochrome-labeled chicken immunoglobulin Y (0.01 µg).
The nitrocellulose matrix of the test strip contains a test/capture line which is tagged with
anti-human TSH murine antibodies (0.929 µg); and a control line which is tagged with anti-
chicken immunoglobulin Y (0.465 µg).
The AFIAS TSH-SP and AFIAS TSH-VB ID chips are electronic memory devices fitted into
a plastic flat rectangular device 24 mm x 20 mm x 3 mm. The AFIAS TSH-SP ID chip is
intended for use with the AFIAS-6/SP analyzer for use with serum and plasma and the
AFIAS-VB ID chip is intended for use with the AFIAS-6/VB analyzer for use with whole
blood samples. The ID chip contains lot specific information. Relevant information derived
from the ID chip (test name/item, lot number, expiration date and sample type) will be saved
in the internal memory of AFIAS-6/SP or AFIAS 6/VB analyzer. The analyzers can save ID
chip information of up to 100 ID chips.
AFIAS-6/SP and AFIAS-6/VB analyzers are identical except the AFIAS-6/SP analyzer will
only accept the AFIAS-6/SP ID chip and is intended for use with serum and plasma samples
and the AFIAS-6/VB analyzer will only accept the AFIAS-6/VB ID chip and is intended for
use with venous whole blood samples. The analyzer is a compact, bench-top, automated,
fluorometric analyzer measuring 42 cm (L) x 33.6 cm (W) c 29.3 cm (H). AFIAS-6/SP and
AFIAS-6/VB are fluorescence-scanning analyzers to use in conjunction with various AFIAS
tests which are based on antigen-antibody reaction and fluorescence technology. The
analyzers use a semiconductor diode laser as the excitation light source for illuminating the
sample loaded AFIAS test cartridges inserted in its cartridge holder; thereby triggering
fluorescence from the fluorochrome-labeled complexes of analytes accumulated at the test
line on the cartridge membrane. The on-board microprocessor computes concentration of
the analyte in the test sample base on the pre-programmed calibration derived from the
AFIAS ID chip inserted in the ID chip port.
The AFIAS TSH-SP cartridge is for use with the AFIAS-6/SP analyzer; this test system is
intended for use with serum and plasma samples. The AFIAS TSH-VB cartridges are for use
with the AFIAS- 6/VB analyzer; this test system is for use with venous whole blood
samples. The test systems are identical except for the intended uses and sample types.

L. Test Principle:
Fluorochrome-labeled anti-human TSH murine antibodies (detector antibody) present in the
reconstituted detection buffer bind with thyroid stimulating hormone present in the sample.
The test mixture migrates through the nitrocellulose matrix of the test strip which contains a
test capture line and a control line. The test line is tagged with anti-human TSH murine
antibodies and the control line is tagged with anti-chicken immunoglobulin Y. As the test
sample migrates through the test strip, anti-human TSH murine antibodies at the test line
capture the detector antibody-TSH complexes. Similarly, complexes of fluorochrome-labeled
chicken immunoglobulin Y-capture antibodies accumulate at the control line. At the end of
the 15 minute incubation time, a laser light source illuminates the cartridge membrane
thereby triggering fluorescence from the fluorochrome-labeled complexes accumulated at the
test and control lines. The intensity of the fluorescence is scanned and converted into an
electric signal which correlates to the concentration of human TSH in the test sample. An on-
board microprocessor calculates the TSH concentration in the sample utilizing a pre-
programmed, lot-specific and sample-specific master calibration curve stored in the AFIAS
TSH ID chip.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

A linearity study was performed on serum and Na-heparinized whole blood samples.
A serum sample with a high TSH concentration was serially diluted using a serum
sample with a low concentration of TSH to produce 22 equally spaced, TSH
concentrations. The serum linearity samples had the following mean TSH
concentrations: 0.0, 0.03, 0.49, 0.99, 1.98, 2.99, 3.98, 4.99, 5.94, 6.99, 7.96, 9.00,
10.03, 20.16, 29.99, 40.77, 50.25, 61.63, 68.00, 79.01, 90.56, and 102.91 µIU/mL.
Likewise, a Na-heparinized whole blood sample with a high TSH concentration was
serially diluted with a Na- heparinized whole blood sample with a low TSH
concentration to produce 22 equally spaced TSH concentrations. The Na-
heparinized whole blood linearity samples had the following mean TSH
concentrations:0.00, 0.14, 0.49, 0.97, 1.92, 2.92, 3.91, 4.92, 5.94, 6.93, 7.86, 8.82,
9.81,19.39, 30.50, 39.38, 48.77, 57.69, 70.40, 77.66, 88.69, and 98.36 µIU/mL. The
samples were run in replicates of three. The following linear regression equations
were obtained:
Serum analysis for the AFIAS TSH-SP on the AFIAS-6/SP Analyzer:
y=1.0081 x - 0.0785, R2= 0.9993
Na-heparinized whole blood analysis for the AFIAS TSH-VB on the AFIAS-6/VB
Analyzer:
y= 0.9824 x + 0.0216, R2= 0.9997
The claimed measuring range of the AFIAS TSH-SP on the AFIAS TSH/SP
Analyzer for serum TSH is 0.07 to 80 µIU/mL.
The claimed measuring range of the AFIAS TSH-VB on the AFIAS TSH/VB
Analyzer for venous whole blood TSH is 0.3 to 80 µIU/mL.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: AFIAS TSH Controls are prepared gravimetrically and are traceable to
the WHO International Standard Human Thyroid Stimulating Hormone for
Immunoassay (3rd IRP, NIBSC Code 81/565).
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit studies were performed on both serum and Na-heparinized whole
blood samples to determine the limit of blank, limit of detection, and limit of
quantitation for both matrix types.
Limit of Blank (LoB): Five TSH-depleted human serum and whole blood samples
were each tested in replicates of 5 using 3 cartridge lots and 3 analyzers for 3 days for
a total of 75 test results per lot. The LoB was calculated by non-parametric analysis of
the study data. The sponsor used the highest LoB from the three lots as the claimed
LoB. The LoB for the serum matrix was determined to be 0.03 µIU/mL for use with
the AFIAS TSH-SP on the AFIAS-6/SP Analyzer. The LoB for the whole blood
matrix was determined to be 0.13 µIU/mL for use with the AFIAS TSH-VB on the
AFIAS-6/VB Analyzer.
Limit of Detection (LoD): Five low level TSH spiked human serum samples were
prepared to have approximate TSH concentrations of 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10, and 0.12
µIU/mL. Five low level TSH spiked venous whole blood samples were prepared to
have approximate TSH concentrations of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 µIU/mL. The
samples were tested in replicates of 5 using 3 cartridge lots and 3 analyzers for 3 days
for a total of 75 tests per lot. The following equation was used to calculate the LoD:
LoD= LoB + Cp x SD . The sponsor used the highest LoD from the three lots as the
L
claimed LoD. The LoD for the serum matrix was determined to be 0.05 µIU/mL for
use with the AFIAS TSH-SP on the AFIAS-6/SP Analyzer. The LoD for the whole
blood matrix was determined to be 0.2 µIU/mL for use with the AFIAS TSH-VB on
the AFIAS-6/VB Analyzer.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ): Five low level TSH spiked human serum samples were
prepared to have approximate mean TSH concentrations of 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, and
0.09 µIU/mL. Four low level TSH spiked Na-heparin whole blood samples were
prepared to have approximate mean TSH concentrations of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5
µIU/mL. The samples were tested and the SD and %CVs were calculated from the
data. The sponsor defines LoQ as the lowest TSH concentration with an imprecision
of less than or equal to 20%. The sponsor used the highest LoQ from the three lots as
the claimed LoQ. The LoQ for the serum matrix was determined to be 0.07 µIU/mL
for use with the AFIAS TSH-SP on the AFIAS-6/SP Analyzer. The LoQ for the
whole blood matrix was determined to be 0.3 µIU/mLfor use with the AFIAS TSH-
VB on the AFIAS-6/VB Analyzer.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference study:
The sponsor performed an interference study to evaluate the susceptibility of the
AFIAS TSH test systems to interference from several endogenous substances and
common thyroid medications. Two serum samples and two Na-heparin venous whole
blood samples with TSH concentrations of 0.5 and 5.0 µIU/mL were spiked with
endogenous substances and medications. The samples were run in triplicate and the
results were compared to control sample results which were not spiked with potential
interfering substances. The sponsor defines significant interference as ±10% bias as
compared to the control results. The results of the interference study are summarized
in the table below and are applicable to the AFIAS TSH-SP and AFIAS TSH-VB
assays:
Highest concentration of substance tested that

did not demonstrate significant interference
Albumin 6 g/dL
Conjugated bilirubin 20 mg/dL
Unconjugated bilirubin 20 mg/dL
Biotin 56 ng/mL

Cross-Reactivity Study
Cross-reactivity studies were performed to evaluate the susceptibility of the AFIAS
TSH test systems to cross-reactivity with the following endogenous structural analogs
of human TSH: human follicle stimulating hormone (hFSH), human luteinizing
hormone (hLH), and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Two serum samples and
two Na-heparin venous whole blood samples with TSH levels of 0.5µIU/mL and
5.0µIU/mL were spiked with 1,200 mIU/mL of each of the potential cross-reactants
and measured in triplicate. The sponsor defines significant cross reactivity as less
than a 10% bias in expected results.
The following equation was used to calculate the % cross reactivity:
Mean concentration of spiked sample – mean concentration of unspiked sample x 100
Spiked concentration of the cross-reactant
The cross-reactivity study results are summarized in the table below and are
applicable to the AFIAS TSH-SP and AFIAS TSH-VB assays:
Highest concentration of substance tested that did
Substance
not demonstrate significant cross-reactivity
hFSH 1,200 mIU/mL
hLH 1,200 mIU/mL
hCG 1,200 mIU/mL
High Dose Hook Effect study
A hook effect study was performed by spiking a serum sample with the following
TSH concentrations: 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, and
3,000 µIU/mL. The samples were run in triplicate using the AFIAS TSH test system.
The study showed that the samples with a TSH concentration of greater than 80
µIU/mL of TSH displayed results of “>80 µIU/mL” on the AFIAS-6 analyzer. The
sponsor concludes that the AFIAS TSH test system did not show hook effect for TSH
concentrations up to 3000 µIU/mL.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed at 3 point-of-care (POC) sites to evaluate
the accuracy of the AFIAS TSH test system against the comparator method, the
Access Fast hTSH test. Matching sets of serum and Na-heparinized venous whole
blood were tested by the candidate devices. Serum was measured by the comparator

method at an in-house laboratory. The method comparison study included 183 serum
samples and157 Na- heparinized venous whole blood samples. Less than 15% of the
samples were contrived. The method comparison study was performed by 3 POC
operators at each of the 3 POC sites for a total of 9 POC operators (nurses, nursing
assistants, medical assistants, office assistants, etc.). One lot of AFIAS test cartridges
and 3 analyzers were used in the study. The results of the method comparison study
are summarized below for each sample type:
Serum analysis for the AFIAS TSH-SP on the AFIAS-6/SP Analyzer:
y= 0.976x + 0.003, R2=0.9994 (n=183) ,test range: 0.07-79.9 µIU/mL
Na-heparinized venous whole blood analysis for the AFIAS TSH-VB on the AFIAS-
6/VB Analyzer:
Serum results on the predicate were compared to Na-heparinized venous whole blood
on the candidate device.
y=0.909 x + 0.012, R2=0.999 (n=157), test range: 0.31-76.26 µIU/mL
Analysis of individual sample results was performed to assess the classification as
hypothyroid or normal using the reference range for each. The classification into
hypothyroid or normal by the candidate was the same as the predicate for all samples.
The difference in results are due matrix differences between serum and whole blood.
Serum and whole blood results are not interchangeable and must be interpreted with
the corresponding reference range only. See M.5. below.
b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed by testing matched sample sets of the
claimed sample types: serum, sodium heparin venous whole blood and plasma,
EDTA venous whole blood and plasma. The results are summarized in the following
table:
Range tested
Compared matrices n Linear Regression R2

The results of the matrix comparison study support the manufacturer’s claim that
serum, K2-EDTA plasma and Na-heparin plasma are acceptable sample types to use
with the AFIAS TSH-SP test system and that venous K2-EDTA and venous Na-
heparin whole blood and are acceptable sample types to use with the AFIAS TSH-
VB test systems.
