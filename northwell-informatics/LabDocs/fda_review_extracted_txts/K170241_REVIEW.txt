L. Test Principle:
The GlucoDr.S Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are based on measurement of electric
currents caused by the reaction of glucose with the reagents on the gold electrode of the test
strip. The blood sample is drawn into the test strip's reaction chamber through capillary
action. Glucose in the sample reacts with glucose dehydrogenase and mediator on the test
strip. This reaction creates electric currents. The consequent electric currents are proportional
to the glucose concentration in the blood and converted to the equivalent glucose
concentration by the algorithm programmed in the GlucoDr.S Blood Glucose Meters.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Performance testing was conducted using the GlucoDr.S Blood Glucose Monitoring System,
which is representative of the other two blood glucose monitoring systems. There are no
differences between the three systems that would affect performance.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision was determined according to CLSI EP05-A2. Human venous
blood samples from one donor were adjusted to 5 glucose levels (30-50 mg/dL, 51-
110 mg/dL, 111-150 mg/dL, 151-250 mg/dL, and 251-400 mg/dL). Samples were
tested on 10 GlucoDr.S meters with 3 lots of test strips. Each sample was tested over
1 day in 10 replicates per meter and per test strip lot, giving a total of 100
measurements per lot for a total of 300 measurements for each glucose level. Blood
samples were also tested in duplicate by a comparator measurement procedure (YSI
2300 STAT Plus). Results are summarized below:

mg/dL, 51-110 mg/dL, 111-150 mg/dL, 151-250 mg/dL, and 251-400 mg/dL). Each
control level was analyzed on 10 meters using 3 lots of test strips each day for a total
of 10 days, giving a total of 100 measurements per lot for a total of 300

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed according to CLSI EP6-A. A low glucose human
venous blood sample (aged to deplete glucose) and a high glucose venous blood
sample (spiked with glucose) were mixed to create 15 glucose levels: 15 mg/dL, 20
mg/dL, 43 mg/dL, 61 mg/dL, 78 mg/dL, 136 mg/dL, 194 mg/dL, 252 mg/dL, 310
mg/dL, 368 mg/dL, 426 mg/dL, 484 mg/dL, 542 mg/dL, 600 mg/dL, and 650 mg/dL.
Each sample was measured in 5 replicates with 3 GlucoDr.S meters and 3 test strip
lots and the values compared to a comparator method (YSI 2300 STAT Plus).
Results from the regression analysis are as follows:
Test Strip Lot Slope Y-intercept R2

The reportable range for glucose measurements is 20-600 mg/dL. If a sample glucose
level is below 20 mg/dL, ‘LO’ will be displayed on the glucose meter. If a sample
glucose level is above 600 mg/dL, ‘HI’ will be displayed on the glucose meter.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The GlucoDr.S Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are traceable to NIST SRM 917c
glucose reference material.
Test Strip Stability
Test strip stability was assessed using accelerated and real-time stability studies.
Testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
The sponsor claims a shelf life stability of 19 months and an open vial stability of 4
months at the recommended storage conditions of 34°F to 90°F (1°C to 32°C) and
relative humidity of 15% to 85%.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range for the GlucoDr.S Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems is 20 –
600 mg/dL. See the linearity study above (M.1.b.).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP07-A2. Endogenous
or exogenous substances, each at two concentrations (normal/therapeutic and
high/toxic), were added to venous whole blood samples and adjusted to 3 glucose
concentrations (70 mg/dL, 130 mg/dL, and 260 mg/dL). Each test sample containing
interferent was measured using 10 GlucoDr.S meters with 3 lots of test strips. The
difference between each test sample (measured with the candidate device) and paired
control sample (measured with YSI) was calculated for each substance. The table
below shows the highest levels of substance tested at which no significant
interference (as defined by ± 10 mg/dL for glucose concentrations < 75 mg/dL and ±
10% for glucose concentrations > 75 mg/dL) was observed:

The sponsor has included the following in the labeling:
· If you are taking high doses of Tolazamide (> 16.0 mg/dL in your blood), then
you should know that this drug might affect the reliability of your blood
glucose results.
· The increased levels of the uric acid occurring naturally in the blood (> 8.0
mg/dL) may interfere with the test, resulting in inaccurate test results. High
levels of uric acid are associated with a number of drugs, particularly diuretics
and salicylates (aspirin).
· Do not use during or soon after xylose absorption testing. Xylose in the blood
will cause interference.

from the system.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Sample Volume Study
To verify the test strip minimum sample volume requirement (0.5 µL), fresh venous
blood was spiked with glucose to obtain concentrations of 50-65 mg/dL, 100-120 mg/dL,
200-250 mg/dL, and 425-550 mg/dL. The sample volumes of 0.40 µL, 0.45 µL, and 0.5
µL were measured using 3 GlucoDr.S glucose meters and 3 test strip lots (9
measurements per sample volume) relative to the comparator method (YSI 2300 STAT
Plus) results. At sample volume 0.5 µL, all GlucoDr.S meters test results supported a
minimum sample volume of 0.50 µL for the GlucoDr.S meter and that the sample
detection feature functioned appropriately when the sample volume was insufficient.
2. Hematocrit Study
The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the GlucoDr.S glucose
meter was evaluated using venous whole blood samples with 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%,
42%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, and 65% hematocrit at glucose levels of 30-50 mg/dL, 51-
110 mg/dL, 111-150 mg/dL, 151-250 mg/dL, 251-400 mg/dL, and 401-600 mg/dL.
Measurements were taken using 10 GlucoDr.S glucose meters and 3 test strip lots.
Results of the sample at each hematocrit level were compared to samples measured with
by the established comparator method (YSI 2300 STAT Plus). The study supports the
claimed hematocrit range of 20-65%.
3. Altitude Study
To assess the effect of altitude, human venous blood samples were adjusted to 4 glucose
concentrations: 30-50 mg/dL, 111-150 mg/dL, 251-400 mg/dL, and 425-550 mg/dL and
tested near sea level (181 feet) and 10,020 feet above sea level using 9 GlucoDr.S™

glucose meters and 3 test strip lots. Values measured by the GlucoDr.S glucose meters
were compared to the comparator method YSI 2300 STAT Plus. The results support the
claim that the GlucoDr.S system can be operated at altitudes up to 10,020 ft.
4. Operating Conditions (temperature, humidity)
The effect of temperature and relative humidity on the GlucoDr.S glucose meter was
evaluated using venous blood samples adjusted to 30-50 mg/dL, 96-144 mg/dL, 280-420
mg/dL, and 425-550 mg/dL glucose. Measurements were taken under four
environmental conditions (50°F/15% humidity, 50°F/85% humidity, 104°F/15%
humidity, 104°F/85% humidity) in replicates of 10 with 10 GlucoDr.S glucose meters.
Values measured by the GlucoDr.S glucose meters were compared to the comparator
method YSI 2300 STAT Plus. The study results support the operating condition claim of
50 to 104°F (10 to 40°C) with relative humidity of 15% to 85%.
5. Infection Control and Robustness Studies
The GlucoDr.S glucose meter is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection
efficacy studies for the GlucoDr.S glucose meter was evaluated on the external meter
materials by an outside commercial laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of
hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant CaviWipes Disinfecting Towelettes
(EPA Registration Number 46781-8). Robustness studies were also performed by the
sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of
the meter after 1,095 cleaning and disinfections cycles designed to simulate 3 years of
use using the CaviWipes Disinfecting Towelettes. Labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
6. Electrical Safety and EMC Testing
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing had been performed and the system was
found to be compliant.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
