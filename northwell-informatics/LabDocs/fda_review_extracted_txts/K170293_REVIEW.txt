2. Indication(s) for use:
The Emit II Plus Cocaine Metabolite Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay with
a 150 ng/mL or 300 ng/mL cutoff. The assay is intended for use in the qualitative and
semiquantitative analyses of benzoylecgonine (cocaine metabolite) in human urine. Emit
II Plus assays are designed for use with a number of chemistry analyzers.
The Emit II Plus Cocaine Metabolite Assay provides only a preliminary analytical test
result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred
confirmatory method. Other chemical confirmation methods are available. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug-of-abuse test
result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Performance data was obtained using Beckman Coulter DxC 700 AU Clinical Chemistry
Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The Emit II Plus Cocaine Metabolite Assay consists of two ready-to-use reagents:
Antibody/Substrate Reagent 1 consists of sheep polyclonal antibodies to benzoylecgonine
(2.2 μg/mL), bovine serum albumin, G6P (15 mM), NAD (12 mM), preservatives, and
stabilizers. Enzyme Reagent 2 consists of Benzoylecgonine labeled with bacterial G6PDH
(0.46 U/mL), HEPES buffer, bovine serum albumin, preservatives, and stabilizers.

L. Test Principle:
The Emit II Plus Cocaine Metabolite Assayis is based on competition between free drug in
the specimen and drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PDH), for antibody binding sites. G6PDH enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the
antibody, so the drug concentration in the specimen is proportional to G6PDH activity. The
G6PDH enzyme converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH, which can be
measured as an absorbance change spectrophotometrically at 340 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3. Testing was
performed for twenty (20) days with two (2) runs per day, two (2) replicates per run
for a total of n = 80 sample replicates per test concentration. Nine (9) drug-free
negative urine samples were spiked with benzolecogonine to concentrations of ±25%,
±50% , ±75% , and ±100 of each cutoff, as well as a zero drug concentration sample.
The results are provided below, as determined in qualitative and semi-quantitative
modes using each of the 150 ng/mL and 300 ng/mL cutoffs:

e. Analytical specificity:
For analytical specificity please reference k993988. Additional structurally related
compounds were evaluated by spiking each of the drugs indicated in the tables below
into drug free urine, and determining the lowest concentration that produces a
response equivalent to benzoylecgonine at each device cutoff.

*Ecgonine and cocaine tested at the concentrations above produced a result
approximately equivalent to the cutoff.
Benzoylecgonine glucuronide, a metabolite of benzoylecgonine, shares structural
similarities to benzoylecgonine has significant cross reactivity to the Emit II Plus
Cocaine Metabolite Assay. This cross reactivity was observed in the method
comparison study, where the presence of Benzoylecgonine-glucuronide produced a
positive result when insufficient levels of benzoylecgonine were present to produce a
positive result.
Laboratories who use this assay should use caution when confirming positive results.
Confirmatory methods that do not detect benzoylecgonine glucuronide may not match
the initial screening assay results (see method comparison results below).
