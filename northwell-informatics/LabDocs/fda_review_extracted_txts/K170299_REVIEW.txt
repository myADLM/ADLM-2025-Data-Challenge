510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k170299
B. Purpose for Submission:
Expansion of the intended use of the device to include DNA and RNA from FFPE samples.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Life Technologies Corporation
Ion PGM Dx System
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
High-throughput DNA sequencing
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Ion PGM Dx System is a high throughput DNA sequence analyzer for clinical use.
The Ion PGM Dx System consists of the Ion OneTouch Dx Instrument, the Ion
OneTouch ES Dx Instrument, the Ion OneTouch Rack Kit, the Ion PGM Dx Chip
Minifuge, the Ion PGM Dx Sequencer, the Ion PGM Wireless Scanner, the DynaMag Dx
Kit – Tube and Plate, the Ion Torrent Server and the Torrent Suite Dx Software. It is for
use with the Ion PGM Dx Library Kit, the Ion OneTouch Dx Template Kit, the Ion PGM
Dx Sequencing Kit, and the Ion 318 Dx Chip Kit. The end-user inputs extracted DNA to
be sequenced and uses an established assay or provides the Analyte Specific Reagents
(ASRs) to develop a sequencing assay that targets their sequence of interest.
2. Principles of Operation:
DNA from whole blood samples is isolated using a commercially available extraction
method, or DNA and RNA from FFPE tissue samples are isolated and the RNA is reverse
transcribed into cDNA.
The DNA and/or cDNA is made into amplicon libraries via polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) to specifically amplify the regions intended for sequencing while also adding
indexing sequences (barcodes) to the amplified products. Employing emulsion PCR, each
sample library is templated onto Ion PGM Dx Ion Sphere Particles (ISPs) using the Ion
1

--- Page 2 ---
OneTouch Dx Instrument. Templated ISPs are enriched from non-templated ISPs and
loaded onto an Ion 318 Dx Chip for sequencing on the Ion PGM Dx Sequencer. The
sequencing reaction measures hydrogen ions that are generated during the incorporation
of nucleotides into the nascent strand complementary to the template sequence. The
resulting signal is translated into base calls which are assembled into reads, which are
strings of nucleotide bases in the order found in the original library molecules. Reads are
mapped to a reference sequence and mapped reads are assessed at specific nucleotide
locations to identify variation from the sequence information in the reference sequence
from which variant calls are determined.
3. Modes of Operation:
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes ____X____ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ________ or No ____X____
4. Specimen Identification:
Sample barcode adapters are used in all runs to assign a unique nucleic acid barcode to
each sample DNA allowing the ability to pool up to sixteen (16) barcoded sample
libraries into a single sequencing run.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The Ion PGM Dx specimen is a library (or multiple pooled libraries) derived from
genomic DNA extracted from peripheral whole blood or DNA or RNA from FFPE
samples that is generated and sequenced through the following steps: nucleic acid is
extracted from a sample, quantified and qualified, and used to make an indexed barcode
library; the library is processed to remove remaining library preparation reagents (e.g.
unused primers), normalized as necessary to ensure that each library is equally
represented in the pooled samples, and templated onto beads; the templated beads are
added onto a sequencing chip and sequenced.
6. Calibration:
There is no end-user calibration of the system. During the installation of the Ion PGM Dx
System a company representative performs an Installation Qualification/ Operational
Qualification/ Performance Qualification (IQ/OQ/PQ) protocol to ensure that software
has been installed properly on all items (IQ), the instruments have been calibrated
properly (OQ), and performance of the system is adequate (PQ). This includes an actual
2

--- Page 3 ---
run on the system and uses all instruments included in the Ion PGM Dx System; the run
comprises a control for the Ion OneTouch Dx Instrument, and another control for the Ion
PGM Dx Sequencer. Two controls are needed in case one fails so the company
representative can troubleshoot at which step the sequencing run is failing. These
assessments can only be performed by a company representative and are required after
major software updates. The system cannot be used by customers for any other runs until
a PQ run has been successfully performed.
7. Quality Control:
A double-stranded 221 bp oligonucleotide (CF-1 control fragment) synthesized with the
appropriate ends needed for amplification is spiked into every templating reaction setup.
One region of the CF-1 oligonucleotide contains a unique sequence to differentiate it
from library amplicons. CF-1 is used as a run quality control to ensure that templating
and sequencing was performed correctly. A quality control check is run on results of CF-
1 sequencing and must be passed before results are released to a user.
8. Software:

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Two studies were conducted to assess reproducibility:
Sample Reproducibility
Two wild-type (WT) and ten variant-positive samples were evaluated at 4 testing
sites, each with 4 Ion PGM Dx systems and 4 operators, to determine the
reproducibility and repeatability of detection for multiple variants using a
representative assay.
Each sample was tested 8 times at each site, for a total of 32 replicates per sample, or
768 sample sequencing results (12 samples × 32 replicates × 2 library types (RNA
and DNA)). The call rate, no call rate, positive call rate, negative call rate, and within-
run repeatability were computed at each variant location of interest.
Including no calls and excluding known positive variant locations, the negative call
rate at each clinical variant location for all samples was 100%. Including no calls, all
positive call rates from positive variant locations were >84%.
Excluding no calls and combining data across all study samples, the estimate of
repeatability was 100% for DNA variants and 87.5% for the RNA variants. The lower
limit of the 95% two-sided confidence interval (CI) for repeatability exceeded 96% at
all variant locations.
Including no calls from the data, the estimate of repeatability was 100% at 218 out of
605 variant locations, 94–99.9% at 186 out of 605 variant locations, and 71.6–93.9%
at 184 out of 605 variant locations. Including no calls, the lower limit of the 95% two-
sided confidence interval for repeatability exceeded 64.6% at all variant locations.
The lower limit of the 95% two-sided confidence interval (CI) for repeatability
exceeded 96% at all variant locations.

Assay Reproducibility
The reproducibility and repeatability of a representative assay on the Ion PGM Dx
System was evaluated for 30 representative variants from 18 DNA and 9 RNA
samples. The study was designed to evaluate within-run precision performance
(repeatability) and variability across sites, operators, and instrument platforms
(reproducibility). Six of the 18 DNA samples were mixtures of plasmid and clinical
DNA. Seven of the 12 deletion variants were represented by these plasmid blends. All
other variant types were represented by clinical sample DNA.
Due to the large number of variants detected by the test and the rarity of some of the
variants, a representative variant approach was used. Variants were selected in the
following categories:

Two of the 18 DNA samples were WT at all locations, and the remaining 16
contained DNA from one or more DNA variants. One of the 9 RNA samples
contained no fusion molecules, and the remaining 8 samples each contained RNA
from an RNA variant. Each pre-extracted DNA or RNA sample was sequenced at 4
sites by 2 operators on 2 systems at each site.
At each site, operators were grouped into 2 pairs, with each pair being assigned to 2
instrument systems, and each pair being responsible for testing of 9 of the DNA
samples and all 9 of the RNA samples. Samples were run in duplicate using 2
different reagent lots at 3 of the study sites and on all 3 reagent lots at 1 study site.
The design resulted in a total of 72 test determinations per DNA sample (3 sites × 2
lots × 2 operators × 2 systems × 2 replicates + 1 site × 3 lots × 2 operators × 2
systems × 2 replicates). Because there were half as many RNA samples as DNA
samples, each RNA sample was tested twice as many times (n=144). In total, at least
1,296 sequencing reactions were performed, and all variant locations were assessed
for each sample.

Excluding no calls, the estimate of repeatability at each DNA variant location across
all the samples was ≥98.8% (95% CI lower limit of ≥97.5%). The coefficient of
variation (CV) across all DNA clinical variants ranged from 9.8% to 39%. The
highest CVs (24.9–39.2%) were observed for one specific variant (BRAF V600E
variant); the root cause for the higher percent CV for this sample was not definitively
determined. The CVs for other specific variants (e.g., EGFR L858R variant and
EGFR deletion variants) ranged from 9.8% to 11.3%, and 11.2% to 25.5%
respectively.
Excluding no calls, the estimate of repeatability at each RNA clinical variant location
was 94.4%. The CV across all RNA locations ranged from 72% to 78%.
c. Linearity:
Not applicable.
d. Carryover:
A study was performed to evaluate the potential for inter-run and intra-run sample
carryover (cross-contamination). Eight FFPE cell line samples were evaluated to
determine the percentage of false positive results caused by contamination from one
sample to another within the same sequencing run and by contamination from a
previous run on the same instrument system. Samples that were WT and mutant were
tested in consecutive sequencing runs on the same instruments, and 5 DNA variant
locations and 2 RNA variant locations that were expected to be WT for a sample were
evaluated for contamination. Out of 100 DNA and 80 RNA data points analyzed, no
false positive results were reported in the DNA variants, and 1 false positive result
was reported in an RNA variant. Therefore, the false-positive rate at the DNA variant

e. Interfering Substances:
Endogenous and Exogenous Substances
To assess the impact of endogenous and exogenous interfering substances on the
instrument, a representative assay was evaluated in the presence and absence of
potential interferents. Six potentially interfering substances were evaluated, including
five potentially interfering substances used to extract DNA and RNA from FFPE
tissue samples, in addition to hemoglobin, a potentially interfering endogenous
substance. A total of 8 FFPE samples (1 WT and 7 mutants) with 6 replicates each
were processed through the entire assay workflow, and the samples were spiked with
additional concentrations or amounts of the listed substances at the relevant
processing step, as shown in the table. Replicates of a control sample with no spike-
ins were also analyzed. The concordance between variant calls in samples with and
without interfering substances was computed for each substance under investigation.
Amounts of the tested substances and the steps at which they were added during the
assay are summarized in the table below:

No false positive or false negative results were observed with any of the tested
exogenous interferents. With no calls excluded, for each potential interferent, the
positive and negative concordance with the control condition across all samples was
100%, and the overall concordance with the control condition across all samples was
100%.
With no calls excluded, the results of testing with hemoglobin showed positive
concordance with the control condition of 100% (only samples with a positive control
condition were analyzed), negative concordance of 99.99%, and overall concordance
of 99.99%. For one sample, 1 of 6 replicates of a control condition was a false
negative. For another sample, 1 of 6 replicates of a hemoglobin condition was a false
positive.
Necrosis
It is currently unknown whether necrotic tissue in the region of interest in FFPE tissue
samples interferes with sequencing of FFPE samples. Therefore, users should
macrodissect highly necrotic areas or select alternate samples if possible.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
Tissue input study:
Sixty slide-mounted FFPE samples were analyzed to determine if samples extracted
using the Ion Torrent Dx Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit yield DNA and RNA at the
concentrations required by a representative assay when tissue input requirements are met.
The test requires DNA at a concentration of ≥0.83 ng/μL and RNA at a concentration of
≥1.43 ng/μL.
Thirty resection samples with ≥20% tumor content were prepared without
macrodissection, 15 resection samples with <20% to ≥10% tumor cell content were
macrodissected, and 15 samples were collected by core needle biopsy (CNB). For the
resection samples, 2 × 5 μm sections were used per extraction. For CNBs, 9 × 5 μm
sections were used per extraction. DNA and RNA concentrations were determined using

the Ion Torrent Dx DNA and RNA Quantification Kits, respectively. No sequencing was
performed on the extracted samples.
Of the 60 samples tested, 98.3% (59/60) had a DNA concentration of ≥0.83 ng/μL and an
RNA concentration of ≥1.43 ng/μL. One CNB sample failed the minimum DNA and
RNA concentration specifications, with values of 0.52 ng/μL and 1.23 ng/μL
respectively.
DNA input study:
To evaluate the amount of input FFPE-excted DNA and RNA required to reproducibly
make accurate variant calls, eight cell-line samples were prepared as FFPE sections, and
DNA and RNA were extracted and quantified from multiple sections from each cell line
for blending and testing. Sample blends were prepared with known variants at various
DNA and RNA input-level combinations within the range of 5−15 ng. The DNA and
RNA blends had a target allele frequency of 15% for SNVs and deletions and target
fusion reads of 300−600 for a specific variant (ROS1). A total of 540 individual DNA
and RNA libraries were tested, including positive controls and NTC controls, with 6
replicate libraries each for DNA and RNA per test condition.
The study demonstrated a 100% positive variant call rate within the input range tested,
supporting an input amount of 10 ng each for DNA and RNA for a specific representative
assay.
The negative variant call rate was >95% for all except 4 sample and DNA/RNA input-
level combinations. All cases with a negative variant call rate of <95% were due to no
calls, 3 of which occurred with a DNA or RNA input amount of 5 ng and 1 of which
occurred in a single sample with DNA and RNA inputs of 10 ng each. There were no
false-positive calls.
Additionally, 4 clinical samples prepared as FFPE sections were tested: two samples
containing DNA variants and two containing the specific CD74-ROS1 fusion variant.
The DNA variant samples were paired with wild-type RNA from the same sample at
various input combinations within the range of 5–15 ng, and the RNA variant samples
were paired with wild-type DNA at input combinations within the same range.
The study demonstrated positive and negative call rates of >95% for the DNA variants at
all input combinations, and 100% for one of the CD74-ROS1 fusion variants at all input
combinations. The second CD74-ROS1 clinical sample showed 100% negative call rates
for all test conditions, and 100% positive call rates except for Test Condition 4 (8.5 ng
RNA/15 ng DNA), where the call rate was 83%, and Test Condition 6 (15 ng RNA/15 ng
DNA), where the call rate was 50%.
Sample indexing study:
Sample barcode adapters are used in all runs to assign a unique nucleic acid barcode to
each sample DNA, allowing the ability to pool up to sixteen (16) barcoded sample
17

--- Page 18 ---
libraries into a single Ion PGM Dx sequencing run. All 16 barcode adapters were tested
with the SVA panel and genomic DNA samples (NA12878 and NA19240) to determine
variant call (SNV and Indel) reproducibility between adapter sequences. Sample results
were compared to reference database sequences for the NA12878 and NA19240 genomes
at all variant and non-variant positions. Comparison of data from 60 runs consisting of 4
sequencing reactions (2 DNA samples × 2 barcodes each) and 24 runs consisting of 16
sequencing reactions (2 DNA samples × 8 barcodes each) indicate that the barcode
adapter used and the number of samples pooled together had no effect on variant call
reproducibility.
Indexing chemistry and software is identical for all libraries, independent of the type and
source of nucleic acid. The previously conducted indexing study for indexing genomic
DNA extracted from whole blood was therefore used to support indexing of FFPE RNA
and DNA samples.

appropriate prescription statement as required by 21 CFR 801.109(b), and the special
controls for this type of device.
L. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
