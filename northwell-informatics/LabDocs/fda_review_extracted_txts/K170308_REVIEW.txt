1. Intended use:
The BD MAX Extended Enteric Bacterial Panel performed on the BD MAX System, is
an
automated in vitro diagnostic test for the direct qualitative detection and differentiation of
enteric bacterial pathogens. It is used in conjunction with the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial
Panel as an optional Master Mix. The BD MAX Extended Enteric Bacterial Panel detects
nucleic acids from
· Plesiomonas shigelloides
· Vibrio (V. vulnificus, V. parahaemolyticus, and V. cholerae)
· Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) heat-labile enterotoxin (LT)/ heat-stable
· enterotoxin (ST) genes
· Yersinia enterocolitica
Testing is performed on soft to diarrheal unpreserved stool specimens or Cary-Blair
preserved stool specimens from symptomatic patients with suspected acute
gastroenteritis, enteritis or colitis. The test is performed directly on the specimen,
utilizing real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the amplification of relevant gene
target DNA. The test utilizes fluorogenic gene-specific hybridization probes for the
detection of the amplified DNA.
This test is intended for use, in conjunction with clinical presentation, laboratory
findings, and epidemiological information, as an aid in the differential diagnosis of
Plesiomonas shigelloides, Vibrio (V. vulnificus, V. parahaemolyticus, and V. cholerae),
Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) LT/ST and Yersinia enterocolitica infections.
Results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other
patient management decisions. Positive results do not rule out coinfection with other
organisms that are not detected by this test, and may not be the sole or definitive cause of
patient illness. Negative results in the setting of clinical illness compatible with
gastroenteritis may be due to infection by pathogens that are not detected by this test or
non-infectious causes such as ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or Crohn’s
disease.

I. Device Description:
The BD MAX System and the BD MAX Extended Enteric Bacterial Panel are comprised of
an instrument with associated hardware and accessories, disposable microfluidic cartridges,
real-time PCR master mixes, unitized reagent strips, extraction reagents, and sample buffer
tubes (SBT). The instrument automates sample preparation including target lysis, DNA
extraction and concentration, reagent rehydration, and target nucleic acid amplification and
detection using real-time PCR. The assay includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC) that is
present in the Extraction Tube. The SPC monitors DNA extraction steps, thermal cycling
steps, reagent integrity and the presence of inhibitory substances. The BD MAX System
software automatically interprets test results.
Brief Explanation of the Procedure
A soft to diarrheal stool is collected and transported to the laboratory. After the stool has
been homogenized, a disposable inoculating loop is used to collect a 10 μL aliquot of the
stool material and the contents of the loop are dispensed into a SBT. The SBT is closed with
a septum cap and vortexed. A worklist is created and the SBT, the BD MAX Enteric
Bacterial Panel Unitized Reagent Strips (URS) and the BD MAX PCR cartridge are loaded
onto the BD MAX System. The BD MAX System automates sample preparation including
cell lysis, DNA extraction and concentration, reagent rehydration, and target nucleic acid
amplification and detection using real-time PCR. Amplified targets are detected with
hydrolysis probes labeled with quenched fluorophores. The amplification, detection and
interpretation of the signals are done automatically by the BD MAX System.

are captured on magnetic beads. The beads, with the bound nucleic acids, are washed using
Wash Buffer and the nucleic acids are eluted by heat in Elution Buffer. Eluted DNA is
neutralized using Neutralization Buffer and transferred to the Master Mix tubes to rehydrate
the PCR reagents. After rehydration, the BD MAX System dispenses a fixed volume of PCR-
ready solution containing extracted nucleic acids into the BD MAX PCR Cartridge.
Microvalves in the BD MAX PCR Cartridge are sealed by the system prior to initiating PCR
to contain the amplification mixture, thus preventing evaporation and amplicon
contamination.
The amplified DNA targets are detected using hydrolysis (TaqMan®) probes labeled at one
end with a fluorescent reporter dye (fluorophore) and at the other end with a quencher
moiety. Probes labeled with different fluorophores are used to detect the amplicons of the
enteric bacterial targets (Plesiomonas shigelloides, Vibrio (V. vulnificus, V.
parahaemolyticus, and V. cholerae), heat labile and heat stabile (LT/ST) ETEC
(Enterotoxigenic E. coli) and Yersinia enterocolitica) and the Sample Processing Control
amplicons in five different optical channels of the BD MAX System. When the probes are in
their native state, the fluorescence of the fluorophore is quenched due to its proximity to the
quencher. However, in the presence of target DNA, the probes hybridize to their
complementary sequences and are hydrolyzed by the 5’–3’ exonuclease activity of the DNA
polymerase as it synthesizes the nascent strand along the cDNA template. As a result, the
fluorophores are separated from the quencher molecules and fluorescence is emitted. The BD
MAX System monitors these signals at each cycle, and interprets the data at the end of the
program to report the final results.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision
Within-laboratory precision was evaluated for the BD MAX Extended Enteric Bacterial
Panel at one (1) internal site. Testing was performed over 12 days, with two runs per day
(one each by 2 operators), for a total of 24 runs. The Precision panel members were
divided into four (4) concentration categories, based upon organism concentration
relative to the LoDs established for each of the assay targets and expected correct percent
positive/negative. The panel members contained Vibrio cholerae, Plesiomonas
shigelloides, ETEC and Yersinia enterocolitica. The following values were used as spike
levels for the target organisms contained in each panel member:
· Moderate Positive (MP): ≥2 to ≤3x LoD; positive approximately 95% of the time
· Low Positive (LP): ≥1 to <2x LoD; positive approximately 95% of the time
· High Negative (HN): C20-80 LoD; negative between 20 and 80% of the time
7

--- Page 8 ---
· True Negative (TN): No target; negative 100% of the time
Each panel member was spiked with negative unpreserved stool matrix. True negative
samples contained no target. High negative samples were spiked with target organisms
below the analytical LoD of the assay; however, the HN samples were expected to yield a
positive result in approximately 20% to 80% of the replicates due the inherent sensitivity
of the PCR assays. Results are summarized by target and concentration below.

a For the True Negative (TN) and High Negative (HN) categories, the expected assay result was deemed to
be negative. Therefore, percent agreement was calculated for negative results.
Site-to-site Reproducibility
The Site-to-Site reproducibility study was performed at three (3) clinical sites using one
(1) reagent lot. Two (2) operators performed 2 runs per day, over five (5) distinct days
(consecutive or not), for a total of 30 runs. The panels used were the same as described
under the Precision heading, above.
The overall site-to-site reproducibility percent agreement was 100% for the TN category
for all targets, and ranged from 30.0 to 48.9%, 97.8 to 100 % and 98.9 to 100% for the
HN, LP and MP categories, respectively. Results are summarized in Table 1. The
quantitative reproducibility results across sites by target are presented in Table 2. Ct.
Score is an internal criterion used to determine final assay results and was selected as a
means of assessing quantitative assay reproducibility. Mean Ct. Score and the mean

The Lot-to-lot reproducibility study was performed at one (1) site using three (3)
reagent lots. Two (2) operators performed 2 runs per day, over five (5) distinct days
(consecutive or not), for a total of 30 runs. The panels used were the same as
described under the Precision heading, above. Results from 5 days of the accuracy
and precision study were used to comprise data for one lot of reagents for the Lot-to-
Lot study.
The overall Lot-to-lot reproducibility percent agreements were 100% for TN, and ranged
from 23.3 to 41.1%, 97.8 to 100 % and 98.9 to 100% for the HN, LP and MP respectively.
Results are summarized in Table 3. The quantitative results across lots and by target are
presented in Table 8 and Table 6. Cycle threshold score and the Cycle EP, an internal
criteria used to determine a final assay result, was selected as a means of assessing
quantitative assay reproducibility. Mean Ct. Score and the mean Cycle EP values with
variance components (SD and % CV) are shown in Table 4.

Each testing site included one (1) positive external control and one (1) negative
external control in each BD MAX run. A total of 186 runs were performed. Of those,
171 runs (91.9%) passed. The pass rate ranged between 85.3% and 95.7% between
sites. All samples included in a run with EC failure were repeated or remained invalid
if it was a final run. Runs with valid External Controls remained high throughout the
trial.
Internal Specimen Processing Control:
Each BD MAX Extended Enteric Bacterial Extraction Tube contains a Sample
Processing Control (SPC) which is a plasmid containing a synthetic target DNA
sequence. The SPC monitors the efficiency of DNA capture, washing and elution
during the sample processing steps, as well as the efficiency of DNA amplification
and detection during PCR analysis. If the SPC result fails to meet the acceptance
criteria, the test result of will be reported as Unresolved (UNR). An Unresolved result
is indicative of sample-associated inhibition or reagent failure. The user is instructed
to repeat any sample reported as Unresolved.
Specimen Stability Study: (Preservation of DNA in stool or Cary-Blair Media)
Pooled unpreserved or Cary-Blair preserved negative stool specimens were spiked
with BD MAX xEBP targets and tested according to the storage conditions described
in the table below. An additional storage of 3 hours at room temperature was also
applied to every SBT following inoculation in order to mimic a full run of the BD
MAX xEBP, representing the normal customer workflow. To further represent normal
workflow, SBT septum caps were pierced before storage at the appropriate
temperature (including the initial 3-hour storage period).

For each xEBP target and for all test conditions ≥ 95% expected results for positive
and negative samples were required.
Only positive and negative results were included to determine the percentage of
detection at each concentration. All non-reportable results (UNR/IND/INC) and
unexpected results (ex: false positive in a channel not being evaluated) were required
to be repeated from the SBT. Valid results upon repeat were included in the analysis.
If the non-reportable/unexpected result did not resolve upon repeat, it was excluded
from the study.
Cary-Blair Preserved Samples:
The acceptance criteria were met for positive and negative samples at all time-points
analyzed (T0 to 1D) following an initial incubation time of 24h at 25°C in the
collection device, except for one condition:
· ETEC negative condition (1C): 24h at 25°C plus 120h at 2-8°C resulted in
91% (51/56). The failure was investigated and determined to be a result of
poor handling while preparing the samples for the study. Specifically, it was
determined that the same pipette tip that was used for manually piercing the
positive tubes was used for piercing the negative tubes, resulting in
contamination. These failures are not linked to assay performance as is further
demonstrated with passing results at the last time point (1D) (24h at 25°C plus
120h + 20% at 2-8°C).
The acceptance criteria were met for positive and negative samples at all time-points

collection device, except for two conditions, both representing buffer time point
conditions:
· Plesiomonas shigelloides positive condition (2B): 120h at 2-8°C plus 48h
+10% at 25°C resulted in 93% (26/28);
· Vibrio (V. cholerae, V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus) positive condition
(2D): 120h at 2-8°C plus 120h +20% at 2-8°C resulted in 93% (26/28).
Considering that a trend was not observed, the results for Plesiomonas shigelloides
are likely due to the variability of quantification at low levels, resulting in insufficient
low target spike and thus not indicative of stability. The method for quantification is
based on plate count, for which up to 30% of variation can be expected. For Vibrio, if
the failure was truly due to stability, it is reasonable to expect a failure at condition
2B, whereby the samples were held at a worst case room temperature condition.
Unpreserved Samples:
The acceptance criteria were met for positive and negative samples at all time-points
analyzed (T0 to 1D) following an initial incubation time of 24h at 25°C in the
collection device, except for one condition:
· ETEC negative condition (1C): 24h at 25°C plus 120h +20% at 2-8°C
resulted in 93% (52/56). These samples were prepared by the same operator
and therefore impacted by the same handling error as described above for
ETEC negative condition (1) in preserved matrix.
The acceptance criteria were met for negative and positive samples at all time-points
analyzed following an initial incubation time of 120h at 2-8°C in the collection
device, except for one condition:
· Vibrio (V. cholerae, V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus) positive condition
(2B): 120h at 2-8°C plus 48h +10% at 25°C resulted in 93% (26/28).
If the failure was truly due to stability, it is reasonable to expect a failure at condition
1B, whereby the samples were held at a worst case room temperature initial hold for
24 hours followed by room temperature storage for an additional
48 + hours.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity (Limit of Detection or LoD) for the BD MAX Extended
Enteric Bacterial Panel was determined as follows: Each target organism was
prepared and quantified from culture prior to inclusion in this study. Individual
inoculating loops were dipped into each organism preparation and were then
transferred to a Sample Buffer Tube already containing fecal matrix (preserved or
unpreserved) that was pre-determined to be negative for all the targets detected by the
BD MAX Extended Enteric Bacterial Panel. Each organism was tested with a
13

--- Page 14 ---
minimum of 24 replicates per sample type (preserved or unpreserved), by 2 operators,
using 3 different production lots of the BD MAX Extended Enteric Bacterial Panel.
The LoD for a specific organism was confirmed by testing at least 24 additional
replicates at the determined LoD concentration. Analytical sensitivity (LoD), defined
as the lowest concentration at which greater than 95% of all replicates are expected to
test positive, ranged from 34 to 534 CFU/SBT and 3,434 to 53,852 CFU/mL (in
stool) for unpreserved specimens for both strains and 79 to 257 CFU/SBT and 7,860
to 25,712 CFU/mL (in stool) for preserved specimens.

e. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity):
A variety of BD MAX Extended Enteric Bacterial Panel assay target strains were
included in this study. Strain selection criteria included prevalence, serotype and
geographic location, where appropriate. Sixty-nine (69) strains were tested,
including strains from public collections and well-characterized clinical isolates.
Inclusivity testing included 10 strains of Plesiomonas shigelloides, 10 strains of
Yersinia enterocolitica, 36 strains of Vibrio (cholerae, parahaemolyticus and
vulnificus) and 13 strains of ETEC LT/ST. The strains were tested at < 3 x LoD
(Limit of Detection) of the corresponding strain in unpreserved stool matrix. The
BD MAX Extended Enteric Bacterial Panel correctly identified 68 of the 69
strains tested upon initial testing. One strain of ETEC ST/LT (CCUG 38088) did
not meet acceptance criteria and was further evaluated. This strain was titrated
and tested to determine the minimum concentration sufficient for detection. Upon
repeat, the CCUG 38088 strain of ETEC ST/LT was detected at 10 x LoD.

1 Further testing was performed as defined in the protocol
f. Analytical specificity:
The BD MAX Extended Enteric Bacterial Panel was performed on
samples containing phylogenetically related species and other organisms
(bacteria, viruses, parasites and yeast) likely to be found in stool
specimens. The bacterial cells, yeasts, parasites and viruses were tested in
the Sample Buffer Tube at ≥ 106 CFU, cells or genome equivalents/mL in
stool, or ≥ 105 PFU/mL in stool or TCID50/mL in stool or equivalent
amount of RNA/DNA/PCR reaction. Overall, 184 organisms were tested
and are listed in the table below.
· Most of bacterial strains, yeast, parasites and viruses tested
produced negative results with the BD MAX Extended Enteric
Bacterial Panel.
· Two (2) strains of Vibrio mimicus, associated with human
disease, produced positive results with the BD MAX Extended
Enteric Bacterial Panel. However, no positive result was recorded
at ≤ 1.0 x 106 cells/mL in stool with those two strains.
· The following 8 Vibrio species, NOT associated with infections in
humans and therefore unlikely to be encountered in human stool,
were detected by the BD MAX Extended Enteric Bacterial Panel:
V. brasiliensis, V. campbellii, V. harveyi, V. hispanicus, V. nereis,
V. pacini, V. rotiferianus and V. tubiashii.
Based upon in silico analysis, the following Vibrio species could be
detected by the BD MAX Extended Enteric Bacterial Panel:
· 2 Vibrio species, NOT associated with infections in humans and
therefore unlikely to be encountered in human stool: V.

h. Interference Study
Nineteen (19) biological and chemical substances that may occasionally be present in
stool specimens were evaluated for potential interference with the BD MAX Extended
Enteric Bacterial Panel. Included in this study was an Antibiotics Mixture, which
consisted of a combination of 8 different antibiotics tested simultaneously (each
antibiotic at a concentration that may be found in a stool sample).
Nystatin cream was found to interfere at levels above 3.1 mg/mL. Spermicidal
lubricant and hydrocortisone cream were found to interfere at levels above 2.5
mg/mL. Vagisil was found to interfere at levels above 0.92 mg/mL. Results
demonstrated no reportable interference with any other substance tested.
In addition, microorganisms that may be endogenously present in stool specimens
were evaluated for potential interference with the BD MAX Extended Enteric
Bacterial Panel. Ten (10) organisms were tested at high concentration (> 106 CFU/mL
of stool). Results demonstrated no reportable interference with any microorganism
tested.

i. Fresh versus Frozen Study:
The objective of this study was to evaluate target stability after two (2) freeze/thaw
cycles in target-spiked preserved and unpreserved specimens.
Individual Preserved and unpreserved negative stool specimens were used to generate
the target-spiked positive specimens. A stool specimen placed into a modified Cary-
Blair medium for transport and storage is defined as “preserved” matrix; a stool
specimen stored in its natural state is defined as “unpreserved” matrix.
Enteric bacterial organisms representing test panel targets (Vibrio cholera,
Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Yersinia enterocolitica, and Plesiomonas
shigelloides) were prepared as a stock enteric organism target mix and spiked into 2
aliquots from each negative specimen in accordance with target loads illustrated in the
table below. The concentrations were chosen to test low positive and moderate
positive specimens (i.e., concentrations near the LoD; 1.99X and 3X the analytical
LoD, respectively) as well as a high LoD values (6X and 9X LoD).

* Testing was performed using a conditional testing sequence algorithm.
This algorithm only mandated testing the lowest concentration (1.99x LoD)
of replicates.
Baseline testing was performed for each individual, target-spiked sample following
preparation and prior to storage or subjected to freeze/thaw cycles. Specimens were

then stored at -80 °C for one (1) month and subjected to two (2) freeze/thaw cycles.
After each freeze/thaw cycle the specimens were sampled and tested.
The study was performed by four (4) operators, using three (3) lots of BD MAX xEBP
reagents and eight (8) BD MAX Systems. Testing was performed using a conditional
testing sequence algorithm. If >95% of the 1.99x LoD samples were gave the expected
result, then no additional testing was performed.
All targets (Vibrio cholera, Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Yersinia
enterocolitica, and Plesiomonas shigelloides) yielded 100% agreement with expected
results, for all specimens, across the conditions tested. The BD MAX xEBP met the
performance requirements for all targets with fresh and frozen specimens. Study

j. Carryover / Cross-Contamination
A study was conducted to investigate within-run carryover and between-run carryover
while processing specimens with high bacterial loads of Enterotoxigenic Escherichia
coli (ETEC) in the BD MAX extended Enteric Bacterial Panel. Positive samples were
prepared in SBT with an unpreserved stool ETEC was present at ~1 x 106 CFU/mL.
The negative member did not contain any target analyte. Negative samples were
prepared in SBT with negative unpreserved stool matrix.
Three different reagent lots along with three (3) lots of negative unpreserved stool
matrix were used. Twelve (12) replicates of the high positive panel member and 12
replicates of the negative panel member were tested in each run by alternating negative
and positive samples. Three (3) operators performed 3 consecutive runs across 3 BD
MAX Instruments for a total of nine (9) runs containing 24 samples (total of 108
negative and 108 high positive samples).
Of a total of 108 ETEC positive samples and 108 ETEC negative samples, 100%
and 99.1% expected assay results were obtained, respectively. One ETEC false
positive result was observed among the negative samples (0.9% false positive).
k. Mixed Infection Study:
A mixed infection/competitive interference study was performed to evaluate the ability
of the BD MAX Extended Enteric Bacterial Panel to detect low positive results in the
presence of other targets at high concentrations. Each of the targeted organisms was
evaluated at low concentrations (1.99x LoD) when present in samples containing
another targeted organisms at a high concentrations (>1x106 CFU/mL). Samples were
prepared with unpreserved stool matrix. A total of 24 replicates were tested for each of
the sample mixes described in the table below.

simulated mixed infection preparations were successfully detected by the BD MAX
Extended Enteric Bacterial Panel. Successful detection of all 3 low target organisms by
the BD MAX Extended Enteric Bacterial Panel was achieved in the presence of

3. Clinical Study:
Clinical performance characteristics of the BD MAX Extended Enteric Bacterial
Panel were determined in a multi-site investigational study. The study involved a total
of six (6) geographically diverse clinical centers where stools specimens were
collected as part of routine patient care, enrolled into the trial, and tested with the BD
MAX Extended Enteric Bacterial Panel. Specimens were obtained from pediatric or
adult patients suspected of acute bacterial gastroenteritis, enteritis or colitis, for which
stool culture had been ordered by healthcare provider. The reference method for
identification of Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio and Plesiomonas shigelloides in fresh
and frozen prospective specimens, was growth on culture media to identify potential
colonies based on appearance and oxidase testing followed by a PCR assay and bi-
directional sequencing on potential colonies for definitive identification. For ETEC,
the comparator method was two PCR assays performed on the stool specimens
followed by bi-directional sequencing of the product. For retrospective specimens, the
historical results were recorded at the collection site. The historical results were
confirmed using a PCR assay and bi-directional sequencing as part of the composite
comparator method in order to confirm the presence of the target DNA.
A total of 2264 prospective specimens (882 unpreserved and 1382 Cary-Blair
preserved) and 146 retrospective specimens (87 unpreserved and 59 Cary-Blair
preserved) were enrolled in the clinical evaluation for a total of 2410 specimens
enrolled. All test results from the BD MAX Extended Enteric Bacterial Panel and the
comparator method were single results, no coinfections were detected. Table 4
describes the number of compliant specimens enrolled by patient age and specimen
type with a total of 2403 compliant specimens overall. Table 5 through 13 describe
the performance characteristics of the BD MAX Extended Enteric Bacterial Panel
that were observed during the clinical trial.

Co-infections Observed in the Prospective Clinical Study
No co-infections were observed during the prospective clinical study.
Non-Reportable Rate
The initial unresolved rate was calculated when considering the unresolved rate of both
BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel and BD MAX Extended Enteric Bacterial Panel assays.
Of the 2264 prospective specimens initially evaluated, 3.1% of the Cary-Blair preserved
and 3.9% of the unpreserved specimens initially reported as unresolved. The unresolved
rate following a valid repeat test was calculated when considering BD MAX Extended
Enteric Bacterial Panel only 0.1% of the prospective Cary-Blair preserved specimens and
0.3% of the prospective unpreserved specimens remained unresolved. Of all the
specimens initially evaluated with both BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel and BD MAX
Extended Enteric Bacterial Panel assays, 1.0% of the Cary-Blair preserved and 1.5% of
the unpreserved initially reported as Indeterminate. Following a valid repeat test, 0.1% of
the Cary-Blair preserved and none of the unpreserved remained Indeterminate. No
incomplete tests were reported during this study.
