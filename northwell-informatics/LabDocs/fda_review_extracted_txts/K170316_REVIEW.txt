L. Test Principle:
The concentration of glucose is determined by the glucose hexokinase method. Glucose in
the specimen is phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) in the presence of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) and magnesium ions to produce glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) and
adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) oxidizes G-
6-P to 6-phosphogluconate with the concurrent reduction of nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD) to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced (NADH). The NADH
produced is detected spectrophotometrically at 340 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies to derive repeatability and within-laboratory precision were
performed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A2 guideline.
Serum glucose:
The samples were three levels of control material and three levels of spiked human
serum (Panels A, B, and C). Precision for spiked human serum was evaluated using
two instruments and two reagent lots per instrument in 3 replicates per run, 2 runs per
day across 22 days for 528 total results. Control samples were tested using two
instruments and two reagent lots with only one reagent lot per instrument in 3
replicates per run, 2 runs per day across 22 days for 264 results per
instrument/reagent lot; one representative lot is shown below. Estimates for
repeatability and within-laboratory precision were analyzed by ANOVA and the
results are summarized as follows. The number of actual results was slightly reduced
due to instrument errors.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP06-A guideline.
Serum glucose:
One low-level glucose sample, SeraSub (synthetic serum) and one high-level serum
glucose sample were inter-diluted to prepare 13 test sample concentrations (828, 796,
777, 730, 560, 361, 189, 93, 48, 22, 4, 2, and 0 mg/dL) spanning the claimed
measuring range. Test samples were assayed in a minimum of two replicates using
one instrument, reagent lot, calibrator lot, and control lot.
Urine glucose:
One low-level glucose sample, UriSub (synthetic urine) and one high-level urine
glucose sample were inter-diluted to prepare 15 test sample concentrations (843, 814,
794 745, 551, 369, 198, 98, 25, 10, 6, 1, 0 mg/dL) spanning the claimed measuring
range. Test samples were assayed in a minimum of two replicates using one
instrument, reagent lot, calibrator lot, and control lot.
CSF glucose:
One low-level glucose sample, UriSub and one high-level human CSF glucose
sample were inter-diluted to prepare 15 concentrations (887, 846, 825, 783, 574, 365,
209, 105, 26, 11, 5, 1.1, 1.0, 0.6, 0.1 mg/dL) spanning the claimed measuring range.
Test samples were assayed in a minimum of two replicates using one instrument,
reagent lot, calibrator lot, and control lot.
For each specimen type, the mean sample concentration result for each test sample
was compared to the expected result determined by the dilution factor and analyzed
by regression analysis. Results of the linear regression analysis per sample type are
presented in the table below.

Serum 0.9903 -0.1 0.9993
Urine 0.9616 -0.2 0.9988

The observed linear range supports the claim that the Alinity c Glucose Reagent is
linear across the measuring interval of 5 to 800 mg/dL for serum and 1 to 800 mg/dL
for urine and CSF.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The Alinity c Glucose Reagent Kit is traceable to NIST standard
reference material 965b.
Stability: The shelf life stability and open on-board reagent stability of the Alinity c
Glucose Reagent Kit was previously established in k060383. The open onboard
stability claim is 30 days. The sponsor claims a product shelf-life/expiration of 12
months.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
were evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
To determine LoB, one blank sample was assayed a minimum of 5 replicates over 3
days. The LoB was calculated as the 95th percentile of the zero-analyte
measurements. The sponsor’s study supported a LoB of 0.33 mg/dL for the serum
application and 0.23 mg/dL for the urine/CSF application.
To determine LoD, five low-level samples were prepared by diluting a glucose serum
stock solution and assaying 10 replicates over 3 days. LoD was evaluated from the
lowest analyte level that had at least 95% of the replicates greater than the LoB. The
sponsor’s study supported an LOD of 0.55 mg/dL for the serum application and 0.40
mg/dL for the urine/CSF application. The sponsor determined the functional
sensitivity of the Alinity c Glucose Reagent Kit based on the LOQ on the Alinity c
System.
To determine the LoQ, test levels near the linear low limit for the glucose assay were
run in replicates of 10 on three instruments over 3 days. The limit of quantitation was
defined as the lowest concentration of analyte which has imprecision less than or
equal to 20% CV. The sponsor’s study supported a LoQ of 2.25 mg/dL for the serum
application and 0.86 mg/dL for the urine/CSF application. e. Analytical
specificity:
Potential interference was in accordance with CLSI EP07-A2 guideline.

Serum glucose:
Interference from six drugs and four endogenous substances was evaluated using
Technopath Serum Matrix spiked with high (135 mg/dL) or low (93 mg/dL) glucose

interferent. The sponsor defined significant interference as bias >6% or >1 mg/dL

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP09-A3
guideline. Serum, urine, and CSF glucose samples were measured using two Alinity c
Systems and an ARCHITECT c8000 System (k060383) as the comparator method.
Samples were tested in duplicate on each system. The first replicate for the Alinity c
System was compared to the mean concentration from the ARCHITECT c System.
The number and range of samples tested for each matrix are listed in the table below
with representative results using a Passing-Bablok linear regression. Less than 15% of
samples were prepared by diluting or spiking specimens.

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes X or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ________ or No X
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes X or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Sample barcode, rack barcode
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Instructions on specimen handling, storage, and shipping is provided in the package insert
for the reagents.
5. Calibration:
Instruction for calibration is provided in the package insert for the assays and in the
operator’s manual for the Alinity c System. Calibration is required with each change in
reagent lot. Calibration verification should be conducted with at least 2 levels of controls
according to the established quality control requirements for the laboratory. If control
results fall outside acceptable ranges, recalibration may be necessary.

6. Quality Control:
The sponsor recommends that two levels of controls (normal and abnormal) should be
tested every 24 hours. Two levels of controls should be used to verify each calibration.
The Alinity c System is equipped with quality control analysis software to monitor
quality control data with Levey-Jennings graphs, Westgard rules, control range tracking,
and quality control data summaries. The sponsor also recommends verification
procedures be performed to verify Alinity ci series claims. Quality control testing should
be performed in accordance with regulatory requirements and each laboratory’s standard
procedure.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
EMC and Electrical Safety: The Alinity c System was tested and passed for compliance to
EMC and Electrical Safety standards.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
