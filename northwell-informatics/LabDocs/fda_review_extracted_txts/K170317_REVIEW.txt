L. Test Principle:
The Alinity i Total β-hCG Reagent Kit is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative
and qualitative determination of β-hCG in human serum and plasma using
chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology. A specific mouse
anti-hCG monoclonal antibody is coated on the magnetic beads; another monoclonal
antibody is labeled with an acridinium-labeled conjugate. After addition of sample,
calibrator, or controls to the microbead-antibody conjugate, the mixture is incubated in
the reaction vessel (RV) allowing β-hCG present in samples, calibrator, or controls to
bind to the monoclonal antibody on the bead. A magnet attracts the paramagnetic
microparticles (which are bound to β-hCG) to a wall of the RV. The wash zone assembly
washes the reaction mixture to remove unbound materials. After a washing step, the
chemiluminescent, acridinium-labled conjugate is added to the RV, reacting with hCG
already bound to the magnetic beads to form sandwich complexes. The wash zone
assembly washes the reaction mixture once more to remove unbound materials.
Subsequently, the Pre-Trigger Solution (hydrogen peroxide) is added to prepare the
mixture for the chemiluminescent reaction. Then the Trigger Solution (sodium
hydroxide) is added to initiate a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting
chemiluminescent reaction is measured as Relative Light Units, which is proportional to
the concentration of total β-hCG present in samples. For qualitative interpretation of the
Alinity i Total β-hCG test results, specimens with β-hCG levels less than or equal to 5.00
mIU/mL will be reported in the INTERPRETATION field on the test results screen or
printout as “NEGATIVE.” Specimens with β-hCG greater than or equal to 25.00
mIU/mL will be reported as “POSITIVE.” Specimens with β-hCG levels greater than
5.00 mIU/mL and less than 25.00 mIU/mL will be reported with concentrations only. No
interpretation will be reported for these results.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Quantitative:
Precision studies were conducted using five levels of pooled human serum specimens,
prepared by spiking normal human male serum with β-hCG, and three levels of hCG
controls, each tested on two lots of Alinity i Total β-hCG Reagent Kit and two Alinity i
Systems. Precision samples were tested in a minimum of 2 runs per day, 2 replicates per
run, over 20 non-consecutive days.
Results from the two reagent lots were similar on the two systems. Results from one
representative lot and analyzer 1 are provided in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity
Linearity was established by preparing ten sample dilutions, with concentrations from
2.47 - 16424 mIU/mL, created by mixing different proportions of a normal human serum
sample, spiked with WHO 4th International Standard β-hCG stock, and a normal human
female serum sample without detectable hCG. Four replicates were measured for each
sample and the mean of these replicates was compared to the expected values. Linearity
results are presented below in terms of expected versus observed.

Health Organization (WHO) 4th Internation Standard (IS) for hCG (75/589). The Alinity
i Total β-hCG controls were cleared under k983424 with the name ARCHITECT Total β-
hCG Controls.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of blank:
The limit of blank was determined by running replicates of at least 10 on 3 days to obtain
a minimum of 60 replicates of 3 β-hCG negative human male serum samples with three
lots of Alinity i Total β-hCG Reagent Kit on two Alinity i Systems. The limit of blank
was determined non-parametricically. The highest value of the three lots was the limit of
blank, which was determined to be 0.20 mIU/mL.
Limit of detection and Limit of quantitation:
Ten low-level hCG samples (2 samples at each of 5 unique target concentration levels of
approximately 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 3.6, 4.2 mIU/mL) were prepared from β-hCG negative
human male serum samples spiked with β-hCG. These samples were tested with three
lots of Alinity i Total β-hCG Reagent Kit on two Alinity i Systems with a minimum of 10
replicates per run over 3 days (minimum N=60). The LoD, 0.67 mIU/mL, was
determined parametrically using the highest calculated LoD from the three reagent lots.
The assay LoQ claimed by the sponsor is 2.42 mIU/mL based on a total error goal of ≤
25%.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-Reactivity:
A cross-reactivity study was performed for Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH),
Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), and Human Chorionic
Gonadotropin (hCG) alpha subunit, added to human female serum containing hCG (> 25
mIU/mL) and to hCG negative human female serum. Results from these cross-reactant
spiked samples were evaluated against that of the unspiked serum sample alone, defined
as the control. No cross-reactivity (defined by the sponsor as < ±10% bias between the
test pool and control pool for samples with > 25 mIU/mL hCG, and < 5 mIU/mL bias for
samples with hCG negative human female serum) was observed at the concentrations that
were tested for TSH, LH, FSH, and hCG α subunit as shown below.

TSH 100 µIU/mL
LH 500 mIU/mL

Isoform Recognition:
Known concentrations of commercially available WHO reference standards (isoforms)
were diluted in hCG negative human female serum for isoform recognition studies. The
results (as shown in the table below) demonstrated that the Alinity i Total β-hCG Reagent
Kit measures four hCG isoforms: intact hCG, β subunit of hCG, nicked hCG and nicked
β-hCG, while free α subunit and β-core fragment yield no detectable response.

were spiked with various endogenous substances and therapeutic drugs. Results from
these spiked serum samples were compared to results of the unspiked serum sample
alone, defined as the control. There was no significant interference (defined by the
sponsor as < ±10% between the test pool and the control pool) up to the concentrations
summarized below.

The sponsor added the following limitation to their labeling:
Specimens from patients who have received preparations of mouse monoclonal
antibodies for diagnosis or therapy may contain human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA).
Such specimens may show either falsely elevated or depressed values when tested with
assay kits such as Alinity i Total β-hCG that employ mouse monoclonal antibodies.
Additional information may be required for diagnosis (Primus FJ et al., 1988 and Schroff
RW et al., 1985).
Hook effect:
Hook effect was not tested for the Alinity i Total β-hCG Reagent Kit. The device is a 2-
step assay with a wash step prior to the addition of the detection antibody.
f. Assay cut-off:
Hormone levels greater than or equal to 25 mIU/mL are reported as positive. Hormone
levels less than or equal to 5 mIU/mL are reported as negative. Indeterminate results are
reported as concentrations between 5-25 mIU/mL.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Quantitative:
A total of 250 serum samples covering the claimed measuring range were assayed in
singlicate using the Alinity i Total β-hCG Reagent Kit on the Alinity i System and in
duplicate using the ARCHITECT Total hCG assay for ARCHITECT system (predicate
device; k983424) over a minimum of three days. There were 34 samples excluded from
the analyisis because the results were outside the measuring interval of 2.40 to 15,000
mIU/mL; therefore, 210 samples were analyzed. Five samples were considered outliers,
but were included in the analysis. One replicate from each sample tested on the Alinity i
System and the mean results from each sample on the predicate were used in the analysis
shown below. Sample values on the Alinity i System ranged from 2.9 – 14692 mIU/mL.
The results are summarized in the table below.

5. Calibration:
The Alinity i Total β-hCG Reagent Kit on Alinity i System utilizes a RFID card that is
preprogrammed with a reagent lot specific master curve and is supplied with each kit.
The full calibration curve consists of six levels of concentration points and is specific to
the Alinity i processing module. A full calibration is created by using one of the three
calibration (data reduction) methods:
· Point to point method
o Uses the average relative light units value obtained at each calibrator
compared to the calibrator concentration to generate a calibration curve
· Linear regression method
o Uses the linear relationship between the relative light unit value and the
concentration of the analyte in the sample to generate a calibration curve
· Four-parameter calibration (4PLC) method
o Uses the difference between predicated and observed calibrator
concentrations or signals to generate a calibration curve
A two-point adjust calibration assay has master calibration data encoded within a two-
dimensional bar code on the reagent cartridge label. After the operator loads a reagent
cartridge on a processing module, the system performs a scan and stores master
calibration data in the system software. The stored data is specific for the Alinity i Total
β-hCG Reagent Kit, but the data must be adjusted to fit a specific processing module.
Therefore, the operator must run two calibrators. The Alinity i System provides four
methods of calibration adjustment (ratio technique method, linear transformation method,
parameter method, and curve shape methods).
6. Quality Control:
Quality control can be performed using Alinity i Total hCG controls. Controls should be
tested once every 24 hours each day of use. Control intervals should be adjusted to match
each individual laboratory's requirements. Values should fall within established ranges
and if not, laboratories should follow its established quality control procedures.
