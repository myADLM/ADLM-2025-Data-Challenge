Addison's disease (caused by destruction of the adrenal glands), dehydration,
inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, or other diseases involving electrolyte
imbalance.
Potassium measurements are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the diagnosis and

L. Test Principle:
Ion-selective electrodes (ISE) for sodium, potassium, and chloride utilize membranes
selective to each of these ions. An electrical potential (voltage) is developed across the
membranes between the reference and measuring electrodes in accordance with the Nernst
equation. The voltage is compared to previously determined calibrator voltages and
converted into ion concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A2 guideline.
Precision for Na+, K+, and Cl- were evaluated by testing two lots of controls, serum
pools, and urine pools in three replicates per run, two runs per day for 20 days. Serum
and urine pools were tested using two reagent lots. The studies were performed on
two instruments.
Precision studies for serum sodium, potassium, and chloride are shown in the table
below for one representative lot.

The linearity studies support the claimed measuring ranges for each sample type, as

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability.
The Alinity c ICT Sample Diluent and calibrators have the same bulk material as the
diluent and calibrators cleared for use with the predicate device, ARCHITECT ICT
(Na+, K+, Cl-) Sample Diluent. The reagent container for Alinity c ICT Sample
Diluent has changed, and performance has been established on the Alinity c System
as the candidate test system in this submission. Assay traceability is the same as
established under clearance in k980367.
Stability.
The protocols for stability and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
adequate. The Alinity c ICT Sample Diluent is stable for 14 months when stored at 15
to 30 °C, and onboard the instrument for 30 days. Real time reagent stability studies
are on-going and scheduled to continue for a maximum of 25 months.
d. Detection limit:
The upper and lower limits of the measuring ranges for sodium, potassium, and
chloride are supported by linearity studies. Refer to M.1.b. linearity section above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI document EP07-A2 to
determine the effects of potential interferences on the sodium, potassium, and
chloride in serum and urine. Various concentrations of interferents were spiked into
low and high levels of each analyte in serum or urine. Each sample was tested with a
minimum of 12 replicates. The sponsor states that interference was considered non-
significant if the difference in measured concentration between the test and control
samples is within ±2% for serum sodium, ±10% for urine sodium, ±10% for serum
and urine potassium, and ±10% for serum and urine chloride.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed using a minimum of 100 human serum
specimens with analyte concentrations within the analytical ranges of sodium,
potassium, and chloride. A minimum of 100 urine samples for sodium, potassium,
and chloride were used for the urine application. Samples were measured using the
candidate device, Alinity c ICT Sample Diluent on the Alinity c System, and
compared to the ICT Sample Diluent on the ARCHITECT c8000 instrument. Less
than 10% of the samples were altered by spiking and diluting human serum samples
and urine. The regression analysis using Passing-Bablok regression for the first
replicate on the predicate device versus mean values of the predicate is summarized
in the table below.

Cl-, urine 112 1.00 -0.30 1.000 25 - 299 20 - 300
b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed to demonstrate the equivalence between
serum and plasma samples when measuring sodium, potassium, and chloride on the
Alinity c Analyzer. Blood was collected from a minimum of 40 donors in the control
tube type (serum) and in the following evaluation tube types: serum separator, lithium
heparin, sodium heparin, and lithium heparin plasma separator. Singlicate
measurements of the evaluation tube were compared to the mean of the reference
tube. The following regression equations were obtained from the matrix comparison
study for sodium, potassium, and chloride analytes:
