L. Test Principle:
The BioPlex 2200 Syphilis Total & RPR kit employs Treponema pallidum fusion
protein (rTP47/rTP17) and cardiolipin antigen-coated fluoromagnetic beads with
unique fluorescent signatures to identify the presence of IgG and IgM antibodies to
Treponema pallidum and reagin in a two-step assay format.
Dyed beads are coated with recombinant T. pallidum rTP47/rTP17 fusion protein or
cardiolipin antigen.
The BioPlex 2200 System combines an aliquot of patient sample, sample diluent, and
bead reagent into a reaction vessel. The mixture is incubated at 37ºC. After a wash
cycle, a mixture of murine monoclonal anti-human IgG and murine monoclonal anti-
human IgM antibody conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE), is added to the dyed beads,
and this mixture is incubated at 37ºC. The excess conjugate is removed in a wash
cycle and the beads are re-suspended in wash buffer. The bead mixture then passes
through the detector. The identity of the dyed beads is determined by the fluorescence

signature of the dyes, and the amount of antibody captured by the antigen is
determined by the fluorescence intensity of the attached PE. Raw data is calculated in
relative fluorescence intensity (RFI).
Two additional dyed beads, an Internal Standard Bead (ISB) and a Serum Verification Bead
(SVB) are present in each reaction mixture to verify detector response and the addition of
serum or plasma to the reaction vessel. Refer to the BioPlex 2200 System Operation
Manual for more information.
The system is calibrated using a set of five (5) distinct calibrator vials, supplied separately
by Bio-Rad Laboratories. One vial containing negative sample, and four vials containing
human Treponema pallidum or human reagin antibodies, are used for qualitative calibration
of assays. The results are expressed in antibody index (AI). The Syphilis Total treponemal
assay results are reported as nonreactive (≤ 0.8 AI), equivocal (0.9, 1.0 AI) or reactive (≥
1.1 AI); while the RPR assay results are reported as nonreactive (< 1.0 AI) or reactive (≥
1.0 AI).

RPR Titer On-board Dilution Reproducibility
The BioPlex 2200 System has a feature for the determination of an end point RPR titer result.
All reactive RPR samples can be diluted on board at 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, and 1:64. Four
reactive RPR samples as well as negative and positive controls were selected to evaluate the
titer precision were tested in two runs per day in duplicate per run for 5 days for a total of 20
data points. Samples with a titer within ±1 doubling dilution were considered acceptable. The
results are summarized below.

The BioPlex Syphilis Total assay is calibrated using a set of four levels of distinct serum
based calibrators whereas the BioPlex RPR assay is calibrated with a set of two levels of
calibrators.
Controls
The BioPlex Syphilis & RPR Control Set contains one negative control, one positive
control for Syphilis Total and one positive control for RPR. Positive controls are made
from the human serum of infected individuals containing anti-T. pallidum and reagin
antibodies. The control set is provided in a human serum matrix stabilized with ≤ 0.3%
ProClin 300, ≤0.1% sodium benzoate and <0.1% sodium azide.
For each control level, three vials are tested in multiple replicates using multiple reagent
lots on three BioPlex 2200 analyzers for a minimum of 45 replicates per reagent lot. The
minimum number of replicates for each control level is 90 when two reagent lots are used
and 135 when three reagent lots are used. For each control level, the mean values were
derived from replicate analyses and should fall within the corresponding ranges as shown
below.
The manufacturing target ranges of the Control Sets are listed below.

Kit Stability:
The following are the stability claims for the BioPlex 2200 Syphilis Total & RPR Kit:
· Real Time (unopened) Kit Stability study demonstrated 24 month stability when
stored unopened on the instrument or at 2 to 8°C, the date of expiration may
increase based on continuing stability studie.
· Additionaly stability studies demonstrated stability of up to 60 days at room
temperature or 2 to 8°C for an open kit.
Carryover:
This study was designed to look for potential carryover of sample when using the
BioPlex 2200 instrument probe. High positive Syphilis Total and RPR samples were
identified and chosen for this study. Testing was performed by having the probe sample
100uL (maximum probe dispensing volume) of high positive sample, immediately prior
to running five replicates of low negative samples with 10uL aspiration volume. This
study was conducted with one set of reagents on three separate instruments.
Carryover was defined as a change in antibody index of <0.1000. No significant
carryover was observed for either the Syphilis Total or RPR assays.
High dose hook effect:
Not Applicable due to a two-step indirect immunoassay with a wash cycle.
IgM Detection:
An IgM depletion study was performed to demonstrate that the Syphilis Total RPR assay
can detect IgM antibodies specifically. In this study three different detection reagent
systems were used: (1) the original assay which contains anti-IgG and anti-IgM, (2) IgG
only assay which contains only anti-IgG, and (3) a IgM only assay which contains only
anti-IgM detection reagents. Fourteen known positive clinical samples were tested in this
study. Each clinical sample was split and one aliquot was incubated with dithiothreitol to
deplete IgM antibodies. Depletion was confirmed and the testing was performed.
The results demonstrated that there was a loss of RPR assay signal, when using the assay
with only anti-IgM reagent after IgM depletion (by dithiothreitol). This test design
demonstrates that the anti-IgM reagent in the BioPlex 2200 Syphilis Total RPR assay is
specific for IgM antibodies.
A second study was performed testing a nine-member syphilis sero-convesion panel. It is
well established that the IgM response to infection is detectable before the IgG response.
Therefore testing of a serial bleed sero-conversion panel by the BioPlex 2200 Syphils
Total assay should be positive at the same bleed as a IgM specific syphilis diagnostic
assay. For this study each panel member was tested with the BioPlex 2200 Syphilis Total
assay as well as syphilis IgM and IgG specific assays that are commercially available.
The results below demonstrate that the BioPlex 2200 Syphilis Total assay was positive
13

--- Page 14 ---
when the sample was only positive in the IgM specific commercially available assay.
This demonstrates that the BioPlex 2200 Syphilis Total assay is specific for IgM
antibodies.

Cross-Reactivity:
A study was conducted to determine if samples from various cross reactants interfered
with test results when tested with the BioPlex 2200 Syphilis Total & RPR kit. A panel of
at least ten (10) specimens positive for each potential cross reactant was evaluated for
possible cross reactivity with the BioPlex 2200 Syphilis Total & RPR kit for Syphilis
Total and RPR assays.
The majority of the samples evaluated were high positive (2x cut-off) for each cross
reactant. The potential cross reactant samples were tested with commercially available
predicate kits in order to confirm the negative status for the analytes intended to be
measured. Cross reactivity, expressed as percent negative agreement is calculated by the
ratio of the number of negative results to the total number of samples assayed for each
cross reactant sample set. The results of each potential cross reactant are listed below:

Testing demonstrated no cross reactivity except for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
(SLE) and Anti-Cardiolipin IgA in the RPR assay. A limitation will be added to the
package insert to inform users of the potential for false positive results in Systemic Lupus
Erythematosus (SLE) patients. No specific limitation regarding the Anti-Cardiolipin IgA
cross-reactivity was added because this is detection of an antibody actually generated
during syphilis infection and because there is no standard test for Anti-Cardiolipin IgA.
It is not possible to know which patients would be cross-reactive if there were a specific
Anti-Cardiolipin IgA limitation. The general limitation that restuls should be considered
with other laboratory findings adequately covers the demonstrated cross-reactivity with
Anti-Cardiolipin IgA.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cutoff values were established in the feasibility phase of BioPlex 2200 Syphilis Total
& RPR assay development using native human samples from apparently healthy subjects,
patients sent to the laboratory for syphilis testing and patients diagnosed with syphilis
infection. Based on the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis using
predicate results as standard, calibrator values were adjusted such that the cut-off value
was equal to 1.0 AI.
To further confirm the cutoff value the BioPlex Syphilis Total and RPR results were
compared to those from the commercially available assays for agreement. Subsequently,
clinical studies conducted at three sites in the US provided the final validation of the cut-
off value.
For the Syphilis Total assay an equivocal range of ±10% was then set around the cut-off
value. Thus, results above or equal to 1.1 AI are considered reactive and results below 0.9

AI are considered nonreactive. The 10% range was established based on the precision of
the assay.
For RPR assay, no equivocal range was set around the cut-off value. Thus results ≤0.9 are
considered non-reactive and results ≥1.0 are considered reactive.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The results of the BioPlex 2200 Syphilis Total & RPR assay were compared to a
composite comparator and an FDA cleared RPR assay, respectively. For additional
details on the composite comparator please see the “Clinical Studies” section below.
b. Matrix comparison:
Five different sample types were evaluated for use with the BioPlex 2200 Syphilis Total
& RPR assay:
· Serum
· K EDTA Plasma
2
· K EDTA Plasma
3
· Lithium heparain Plasma
· Sodium heparin Plasma
Matched serum and plasma sample sets were obtained from 113 doors and screeened for
non-reactivity with both assays. Non-reactive samples were then spiked with high
reactive Syphilis Total or RPR samples to generate samples with concentrations that span
the assay range.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
Clinical Studies
Clincical performance was evaluated at three sites from November to December 2016
using a total of 2008 prospective and retrospective samples. Samples were obtained from
multiple commercial suppliers who collected samples in the following geographical areas
(all prospective samples were collected in the US):
· US : 90.7%
- 23.6% Northeast (Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania)
- 18.7% Southwest (California, Hawaii, New Mexico)
- 28.4% Southeast (Florida, Georgia)
- 9.2% Midwest
- 10.8% Unknown
· Outside US: 9.3%
- 3.5% Argentina
- 3.2% France/Europe
- 1.4% China
- 1.2% Others
The samples tested included 1001 prospective samples, 546 retrospective samples, 160
clinically diagnosed syphilis patients and 301 apparently healthy subjects. Six samples
generated no values due to repeat instrument error.
Performance with Prospectively Collected Samples
Prospective samples were purchased by Bio-Rad from multiple vendors. Each vendor
prospectively collected samples per Bio-Rad’s requisition order stating all comers
arriving into the laboratory with a physician’s request for Syphilis or RPR testing be
collected and included in the clinical study regardless of testing results. Samples were
collected in the following regions: Southern California, New Mexico, Florida, and
Massachusetts. Testing was conducted at three study sites in California (one in house and
two locations representative of intended use sites for the BioPlex 2200 System). Serum
samples were collected, de-identified (only information on patient age, gender, and HIV
or pregnancy status was made available), frozen, and sent to the laboratories for testing.

One thousand and one (1001) prospectively collected serum samples were tested, 401
samples were from subjects who had a physican order for Syphilis and/or RPR testing,
295 pregnant women, and 305 HIV positive patients. Patients were aged 7 years to 96
years with 586 females (58.5%) and 415 males (41.5%).
The serum samples were tested with the BioPlex 2200 Syphilis Total assay and compared
to the result of a reference comparator algorithim. The comparator algorithm consists of
three tests; a treponemal IgG/IgM assay, a non-treponemal assay and a second non-
treponemal TP-PA assay. A final comparator result is determined from the three tests in
the algorithm and used in the estimation of positive and negative percent agreement. The
table below shows the comparator algorithm for treponemal syphilis assays used in this
clinical study.

syphilis. The diagnosis of syphilis and the stage of the disease were made by a licensed
physican based on the patient’s clinical sypmptoms, medial history, and laboratory test
results at the time of diagnosis. Samples were collected from 160 individuals diagnosed
with primary, secondary, or latent syphilis with treatment status including 43 females
(27%) and 117 males (73%). Four samples with no results were excluded due to repeated
instrument error flags observed. The comparison results between BioPlex Syphilis Total
and RPR assays and predicate results are shown below.

Of the total number of 2002 samples tested in the clinical study, 6 invalid results were
generated on the initial testing and had to be retested, none gave valid results upon retest.
The calculated rate of invalid results in this study was 0.3%.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not Applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A total of 1001 specimens collected from the intended use population were tested with
the BioPlex Syphilis Total and RPR kit. The three cohorts consisted of 401 specimens
sent for routine syphilis or RPR testing (194 females, 207 males, 7 - 96 years old), 295
pregnant women (15 -42 years old), 45 pregnant women with STD (18 -36 years old),
and 305 HIV positive individuals (97 females, 208 males, 17 -75 years old). The syphilis
prevalence in each cohort is presented below.

3. Specimen Identification, Sampling and Handling:
The BioPlex 2200 software is designed to control and process data for the BioPlex 2200
instrument system. The instrument system operates in a continuous processing mode with
an on-demand STAT mode as well as when connected to a track (TLA) system. Orders,
either imported from an LIS or entered manually by the user, are processed by the
software from a worklist. Calculated results are both reported to the user and exported to
the LIS. Some instrument functions controlled by the software include order scheduling,
sample verification, sample aspiration/dispense, bead reagent aspiration/dispense,
conjugate reagent aspiration/dispense, in process agitation, magnetic separation and
wash, detector aspiration, multiplexed flow cytometric detection, results processing,
detector calibration, assay calibration, assay quality control, internal quality control,
reagent kit and consumables inventory, and waste management.
The device also contains service software that allows only authorized personnel to set and
check parameters and service the system. No diagnostic patient results are generated or
accessed through the service software.
Significant software features can be categorized under Instrument Control, Data Analysis,
Data Management, and LIS functionality:
· Instrument Control
o Manage a random-access work list using barcodes to process the
assays for each sample, entered manually or from the LIS.
o Use a workflow that is compatible with existing laboratory instruments
and practice.
o Control all hardware modules automatically.

o Optimize scheduling of processing steps in order to complete the assay
of each sample as soon as possible.
o Provide for STAT sample processing.
o Provide for track (TLA) sample processing.
o Acquire and process detector data.
o Perform setup operations that are required at installation or for new
reagent packs.
o Monitor and display instrument supplies and reagents.
o Monitor and report system parameters.
o Track the status of samples on the instrument.
· Data Analysis
o For quantitative assays, determine analyte concentration. Qualitative
tests may report “positive” or “negative”.
o Multiple-level calibration of concentration versus intensity as required
the analyte.
o Chemistry calibration.
o Run control samples and display the data.
· Data Management
o Sample data storage and retrieval.
o Storage and management of test parameter sets.
o Tracking of consumables used with the assay.
o QC data management to facilitate compliance.
· Connection to a Laboratory Information System (LIS) using ASTM protocols.
o Work lists may be imported from an LIS.
o Patient results may be exported to an LIS.
The BioPlex 2200 software runs on a PC running the Windows operating system. The
software serves as the user interface, data processing, and instrument control center. The
user interacts with the software via touch screen, and keyboard/mouse inputs. The
software communicates with the instrument via USB connections. The software interacts
with the firmware and modules through dynamic link libraries (DLL’s). The user can
modify or control software functions—Barcode symbologies and parameters, reportable
analytes, report settings (lab name, lab details), define test groups, and LIS configuration.
4. Calibration:
Syphilis Total and Negative calibrators are prepared in a serum base that has been
stripped of immunoglobulins while RPR calibrators are derived from disease free human
plasma that are pre-screened for immune-reactivity to Syphilis and RPR antigens.
Positive plasma are tested with FDA cleared methods, pooled, processed, and diluted to
target concentrations in the appropriate base matrix. Calibrators and controls may use
common high positive plasma units. Both calibrators and controls are supplemented with
protein preservatives. Control materials use a serum base containing a full contingency of
immunoglobulins to simulate actual human serum specimens.
The serum units used to prepare these materials are tested with FDA-cleared products to
ensure that they are non-reactive for hepatitis B and C viruses as well as for HIV-1 and
HIV-2. The antibody indices for each antigen are determined for each raw serum unit,
30

and appropriate dilutions are determined to obtain the target calibrator and control values.
5. Quality Control:
At the beginning of each day that the Syphilis Total & RPR kit is to be used, load and
process the Syphilis Total & RPR Control Set as indicated in the BioPlex 2200 System
Operation Manual. The Syphilis Total & RPR Control Set should be run at least once per
day, and with each new Reagent Pack lot.
The Syphilis Total & RPR Control Set includes a negative control and a positive control
in a human serum matrix made from defibrinated plasma. Each positive control contains
antibodies for analytes within the Syphilis Total & RPR kit. The positive control is
manufactured to give reactive results, with values above the cut-off for each specific
bead. The negative control is manufactured to give nonreactive results with values below
the cut-off for each specific bead. The negative control must have a nonreactive result,
and the positive control must have a reactive result.
Note: The Negative and Positive Controls of the Syphilis Total & RPR Control Set are
intended to monitor for substantial reagent failure.
Lot specific values for the positive control are loaded into the BioPlex 2200 System
database via the provided media or by manual input. After identifying the control via the
barcoded vial, the BioPlex 2200 System compares the control results to the expected lot
specific control values stored in the BioPlex 2200 System database.
Failure to obtain the appropriate values for controls will invalidate the assay and indicates
procedural error, improper sample handling or deterioration of reagents. Additional
controls may be tested in accordance with a laboratory’s quality control policy.
If a control result is out of its specified range, any test results generated since the last
acceptable control results must be evaluated to determine if test results may have been
adversely affected. Adversely affected results are invalid, and these samples must be re-
tested.
