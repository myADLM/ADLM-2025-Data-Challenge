2. Indication(s) for use:
The LZI Methadone Metabolite (EDDP) Enzyme Immunoassay is an in vitro diagnostic
test intended for the qualitative and semi-quantitative determination of Methadone
Metabolite in human urine. The cutoff for both the qualitative and semi-quantitative
modes of the assay are 100 ng/mL and 300 ng/mL for Methadone Metabolite. The assay
is designed for prescription use on automated clinical chemistry analyzers.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of (1) enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as
Gas or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS or LC/MS)or (2) permitting
laboratories to establish quality control procedures.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific alternative
analytical chemistry method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result.
Gas or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS or LC/MS) is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary test result
is positive.
The LZI Methadone Metabolite (EDDP) (100 and 300) Calibrators are for use as
calibrators in the qualitative and semi-quantitative calibration of the LZI Methadone
Metabolite (EDDP) Enzyme Immunoassay at the cutoff values of 100 ng/mL and 300
ng/mL.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Performance data was obtained using the Beckman Coulter AU480 Analyzer.
I. Device Description:
The LZI Methadone Metabolite (EDDP) Enzyme Immunoassay is comprised of two
reagents, R1 and R2, which are provided as ready to use liquids. The R1 solution contains
mouse monoclonal anti-methadone metabolite antibody, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P),
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), stabilizers, and sodium azide
(0.09 %) as a preservative. The R2 solution contains glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PDH) labeled with methadone metabolite in buffer with sodium azide (0.09 %) as a
preservative.
The LZI Methadone Metabolite (EDDP) 100 Calibrators contain 0, 50, 100, 250, and 500
ng/mL of methadone metabolite (EDDP) in human urine with sodium azide as a preservative.
These five calibrators are sold as liquid, ready to use individual bottles.

EP5-A, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices, Vol. 19, No.2,
February 1999.
L. Test Principle:
The LZI Methadone Metabolite assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay based on
competition between EDDP in the sample and EDDP labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for a fixed amount of antibody in the reagent. In the
absence of EDDP in the sample, EDDP-labeled G6PDH conjugate is bound to antibody, and
the G6PDH enzyme activity is inhibited. When free EDDP is present in the sample, it
competes with EDDP-labeled G6PDH for binding to the antibody allowing for an amount of
active G6PDH enzyme that is proportional to EDDP concentration. Active G6PDH enzyme
converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance
change that can be measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were carried out in qualitative and semi-quantitative mode. All
methadone metabolite samples were tested in replicates of 2, two runs per day for 22
days on one Beckman Coulter AU480 automatic clinical analyzer for a total of 88
sample results. The samples were prepared by spiking drug into negative urine with
the concentrations provided in the below tables. Each drug concentration was

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study in the semi-quantitative mode was conducted by spiking a drug free
urine pool to create a high concentration EDDP, and preparing serial dilutions with
negative urine to achieve the EDDP concentrations provided in the tables below.
Each level was tested in triplicate on the Beckman Coulter AU480 automated clinical
chemistry analyzer. The concentrations were confirmed by LC/MS. The results of the
linearity/recovery study are summarized below:

Stability
Accelerated and real-time stability studies were conducted and the stability protocols
and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The study results
support the stability claim of eighteen (18) months when the LZI Methadone
Metabolites EDDP Calibrators are stored at 2 to 8 ºC.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Compounds sharing structural similarity with EDDP were tested for cross-reactivity
with the candidate device. The structurally related compounds that exhibited cross-
reactivity with the candidate device were titrated to determine the lowest
concentration that generated a positive result. The concentration (ng/mL) of cross-
reactant that gives a response equivalent to the cutoff, and the calculated percent
cross-reactivity are presented in the table below.

Effect of Urine Specific Gravity
To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity, urine samples with 1.004 to 1.025
specific gravity were spiked with EDDP at -25% of cut off and +25% of cut-off.
Samples were then evaluated against the assay’s calibration curve in both qualitative
and semi-quantitative modes. No interference was observed.
Effect of pH
Urine samples with pH 3 to11 were spiked with EDDP at -25% of cut off and +25%
of cut-off. Samples were then evaluated against the assay’s calibration curve in both
qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. No interference was observed.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration is described in the precision section, M.1.a. above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies for the LZI Methadone Metabolite Enzyme Immunoassay
were conducted on the Beckman Coulter AU480 automated clinical analyzer. All
samples were confirmed with LC/MS for both methadone and methadone metabolite
