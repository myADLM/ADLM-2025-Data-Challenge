L. Test Principle:
The test principle of the KetoSens Blood β-Ketone Monitoring System/KetoSens Multi
Blood β-Ketone Monitoring System is based on the amperometric detection of beta-
hydroxybutyrate (also known as 3-hydroxybutyrate) in whole blood. β-hydroxybutyrate is
converted by the enzyme β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase to acetoacetate. The magnitude
of electrical current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is proportional to the amount of β-
hydroxybutyrate present in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
The only differences between the KetoSens Blood β-Ketone Monitoring System and
KetoSens Multi Blood β-Ketone Monitoring System are the trade name and intended use
(single-patient home use vs. multiple-patient use); therefore, performance testing
conducted on the KetoSens Blood β-Ketone Monitoring System.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability:
Venous EDTA whole blood was spiked with five different β-hydroxybutyrate
concentrations (0.4, 1.1, 3.4, 5.2, and 6.9 mmol/L) and tested on ten KetoSens Blood
β-Ketone meters. Ten replicates were tested per meter per concentration with each of
three lots of test strips. The results are summarized below:
Concentration Mean SD
N %CV
(mmol/L) (mmol/L) (mmol/L)
0.4 300 0.39 0.027 6.8
1.1 300 1.08 0.056 5.1
3.4 300 3.38 0.126 3.7
5.2 300 5.16 0.182 3.5
6.9 300 6.91 0.248 3.6
Intermediate Precision:
Intermediate precision was evaluated by 10 operators using three lots of test strips.
Each operator was provided with three KetoSens Blood β-Ketone meters. Each meter
was assigned to a test strip lot. Each operator conducted testing of three different test
strip lots a day for 20 days using three β-Ketone control solutions. The results are
summarized below:
Control Mean SD
N %CV
Level (mmol/L) (mmol/L)
Level 1 600 0.63 0.049 7.7
Level 2 600 2.23 0.085 3.8
Level 3 600 4.04 0.173 4.3
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of KetoSens Blood β-Ketone Monitoring System was evaluated using
venous EDTA whole blood spiked with β-hydroxybutyrate. Nine whole blood
samples were adjusted to the following β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations: 0.1, 0.3,
0.7, 1.2, 2.1, 3.9, 5.7, 7.7, and 9.3 mmol/L. The concentrations were assigned using
the Randox RANBUT d-3-Hydroxybutyrate assay on the RX imola analyzer. The
summary of the linear regression analysis for each lot was as follow:
Lot 1: y = 1.0034x – 0.0145; R2 = 0.999
Lot 2: y = 1.0250x – 0.0466; R2 = 0.998
Lot 3: y = 1.0209x – 0.0323; R2 = 0.998
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed b-Ketone measurement range

of 0.1 to 8.0 mmol/L for both systems.
Validation testing was performed demonstrating that the meter displays ‘HI’ when the
measurement result is greater than 8.0 mmol/L and ‘LO’ when the measurement
result is less than 0.1 mmol/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The KetoSens Blood β-Ketone Monitoring System and KetoSens Multi Blood β-
Ketone Monitoring System are traceable to an in-house standard prepared from
commercially available control materials. The method comparison study was performed
using the Randox RANBUT d-3-Hydroxybutyrate assay on the RX imola analyzer as
the comparator method (see Section M.2.a.).
Test strip stability:
The KetoSens Blood β-Ketone Test Strips are provided in individual foil packages.
The shelf life stability of the foil packaged test strips was assessed in real-time
studies. The study protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found
acceptable to support the sponsor’s claimed stability of 15 months when stored under
the recommended storage conditions of 39°F to 86°F (4 to 30°C) and relative
humidity of 20 to 80%.
Because each test strip is individually packaged, open vial stability testing is not
necessary.
d. Detection limit:
The β-Ketone measuring range is 0.1 to 8.0 mmol/L. The range is validated under the
linearity study. See section M.1.b.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed to evaluate exogenous and endogenous substances
using venous EDTA whole blood spiked at two β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations of
0.6 and 2.8 mmol/L. The samples were divided into two aliquots: control (with no
added interferent) and test (with added interferent at a toxic level or 10 times the
known therapeutic level). Each sample was measured using 20 KetoSens Blood β-
Ketone meters and three test strip lots.
The sponsor defined no significant interference according to the following:
The following table lists the concentration of each substance at which no significant
interference was detected. At the β-hydroxybutyrate concentration of 0.6 mmol/L
the %bias ranged from -17% to 12%. At the β-hydroxybutyrate concentration of 2.8
mmol/L the % bias ranged from -8.3% to 4.3%. The following table lists the high
concentrations at which no significant interference was observed:

six health care professionals at three POC sites.
The POC study was performed on 136 patients from the intended use population
using six KetoSens Multi Blood β-Ketone meters and three lots of KetoSens Multi
Blood β-Ketone test strips. Capillary blood was collected from each patient and
analyzed once using the KetoSens Multi Blood β-Ketone Monitoring System.
Venous blood was collected from the same patient using an EDTA collection tube
and analyzed once using the KetoSens Multi Blood β-Ketone Monitoring System.
The b-Ketone measurements on the fingertip capillary whole blood and venous
EDTA whole blood were compared to those obtained using the Randox RANBUT d-
3-Hydroxybutyrate assay on the RX imola analyzer. To test specimens with β-
Ketone concentrations at the high end of the claimed measuring range, 12 of 136 of
these were altered by spiking analyte into both capillary and venous whole blood
samples. The results are summarized below:

be purchased separately.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study:
The effect of varying hematocrit level on the measurement of b-Ketone concentration
was evaluated using venous EDTA whole blood samples with hematocrit levels of 20%,
25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, and 60%. Five different β-hydroxybutyrate
concentrations of 0.5, 1.6, 2.9, 4.2, and 6.1 mmol/L were prepared at each of the five
different hematocrit levels. The b-Ketone concentration was measured using 30 meters
and three lots of test strips. The % bias at each hematocrit level relative to a plasma
sample of the same concentration run on the Randox RANBUT d-3-Hydroxybutyrate
assay on the RX imola analyzer was calculated. The results support the claimed
acceptable hematocrit range of 20 to 55%.

2. Altitude study:
An altitude/oxygen dependency study was performed to assess the effect of low oxygen
levels when the system is used at elevations above sea level. For testing, three different
altitudes (0, 5000, and 10000 feet) were simulated. Venous whole blood was spiked to
achieve three β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations (0.6, 2.4, and 4.9 mmol/L) as measured
by the Randox RANBUT d-3-Hydroxybutyrate assay on the RX imola analyzer. Each
sample was tested across three lots of test strips using 15 meters. The results
demonstrated acceptable bias to support the claim that altitudes up to 10,000 feet have no
significant effect on b-Ketone measurement with the KetoSens Blood β-Ketone
Monitoring System.
3. Temperature and Humidity Study:
The sponsor performed operating condition studies to evaluate the operating temperature
and relative humidity (RH) ranges. Venous whole blood samples at three β-
hydroxybutyrate concentrations (0.5, 2.5, and 5.0 mmol/L) were evaluated using the
KetoSens Blood β-Ketone Monitoring System. Each sample was tested at the
temperature and humidity conditions shown below using 30 meters and three lots of
ketone test strips for a total of 30 replicates per temperature/humidity condition. The
results were compared with those obtained using the Randox RANBUT d-3-
Hydroxybutyrate assay on the RX imola analyzer was calculated.
50°F (10°C) and 10% RH, 40% RH, 90% RH
59°F (15°C) and 10% RH, 40% RH, 90% RH
73°F (23°C) and 10% RH, 40% RH, 90% RH
86°F (30°C) and 10% RH, 40% RH, 90% RH
104°F (40°C) and 10% RH, 40% RH, 90% RH
The results support the sponsor’s claimed operating temperature range of 50°F to 104°F
and operating relative humidity range of 10 to 90%.
4. Sample Volume Study:
A sample volume study was conducted to verify the minimum sample volume required
for the KetoSens Blood β-Ketone Monitoring System. Three venous whole blood
samples were spiked to β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations of 0.7, 2.4, and 4.4 mmol/L, as
measured by the Randox RANBUT d-3-Hydroxybutyrate assay on the RX imola
analyzer, to evaluate the effect of different sample volumes (0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 1.0 µL) on
the accuracy performance of the device and validation of error message when sample
volume is too low. Three lots of test strips and 5 meters were used. Results from the
study support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.5 mL and that the insufficient
volume error message (Er4) functioned as intended.
5. Infection Control Studies:
The KetoSens Blood β-Ketone Monitoring System is intended for single-patient use, and
the KetoSens Multi Blood β-Ketone Monitoring System is intended for multiple-patient
use. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meters
by an outside commercial laboratory service to demonstrate complete inactivation of
14

hepatitis B virus (HBV) with Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes (EPA Reg.
No. 67619-12). Robustness studies were performed by the sponsor demonstrating that
there were no changes in performance or to the external materials of the meters after
10,950 cleaning and 10,950 disinfection cycles with Clorox Healthcare Bleach
Germicidal Wipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 5 years of single-
patient use and 3 years of multiple-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
6. Electromagnetic Compatibility:
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing
had been performed and the KetoSens Blood β-Ketone Monitoring System was found
compliant.
