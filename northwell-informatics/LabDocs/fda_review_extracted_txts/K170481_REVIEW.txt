H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Strep B Carrot Broth™ Kit is a selective and differential medium which is intended for
the detection of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) from anovaginal specimens collected
from pregnant women. The medium is used as an aid in the qualitative determination of
GBS colonization in pregnant women. The color change reaction from white to orange is
representative of a positive result for presence of GBS. The medium requires 24 hours of
incubation but positive results can be interpreted and reported as early as 16 hours. Due
to the properties of Strep B Carrot Broth™ Kit, non-hemolytic GBS cannot be detected
by the medium’s color change and require subculture for identification. Any
presumptive negative indicated by lack of color change at the end of the incubation
period must be subcultured to a non-selective medium (e.g., Tryptic Soy Agar with 5%
Sheep Blood) to confirm absence of GBS. Subculture must also be performed to recover
isolates for conducting susceptibility testing as recommended for penicillin-allergic
women.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as the Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription Use only
Strep B Carrot Broth Kit culture with no color change after 24 hrs incubation is
considered presumptive negative for GBS and must be subcultured to non-selective
media followed by biochemical testing to rule-out presence of weakly β-hemolytic or
non-hemolytic GBS.
Storage of vaginal/rectal swabs in the specified specimen transport systems beyond 24
hrs at room temperature before inoculating Strep B Carrot Broth Kit is not
recommended.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
Strep B Carrot Broth Kit is a selective and differential medium used for the detection of
Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae, GBS) colonization in pregnant women by testing
vaginal/rectal swabs. Color development (light orange, orange, or red-orange color) is a
unique characteristic of β-hemolytic GBS strains resulting from colored pigment production
in the presence of substrates such as starch, peptone, serum, and folate pathway inhibitors.

--- Page 3 ---
Non-hemolytic GBS cannot be detected by color production, but can be recovered from
Strep B Carrot Broth Kit upon subculture to non-selective plates. Growth of microorganisms
belonging to other species is either inhibited, or if there is growth, the culture does not
produce the expected color reaction.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Not Applicable
L. Test Principle:
Strep B Carrot Broth Kit is a selective, differential medium for the detection of GBS. The
ability to detect GBS is based on the presence of selective agents that suppress growth of
organisms other than GBS, and the presence of components necessary for pigment
production that allow the detection of GBS colonization based on color development.
Vaginal/rectal swabs from antepartum women are inoculated directly into Strep B Carrot
Broth Kit and incubated aerobically at 35°-37°C for 16-24 hrs. Positive results can be
reported as early as 16 hrs. If negative at 16 hrs, the broth cultures are re-incubated until 24
hrs. The cultures are examined after 24 hrs incubation for the development of light orange to
orange to red-orange color. After the subculture of negatives to a non-selective media,
biochemical testing is performed to rule-out the presence of GBS before calling the sample
negative.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated at three sites using a blinded panel of twelve well-
characterized strains, which included 10 hemolytic GBS strains, 1 non-hemolytic
GBS strain, and 1 non-GBS strain as the negative control. At each site, panel
members were tested in triplicate at 103 CFU/ml with Strep B Carrot Broth Kit each
day for five days. Strep B Carrot Broth Kit tubes were observed for development of
light orange to orange color at 24 hrs. Testing was done with at least one operator
and two readers. All strains produced the expected results with the Strep B Carrot
Broth Kit at 24 hrs >95% of the time for each operator (538/540). All non-hemolytic
GBS were recovered upon subculture to Tryptic Soy Agar with 5% sheep blood.
Isolates were also plated onto Tryptic Soy Agar with 5% sheep blood to ensure
viability and purity of cultures.

Recovery Study
A Recovery Study was performed with two GBS strains (ATCC 12386 and ATCC
12403). After preparing six serial dilutions per strain in natural negative matrix and
inoculating media, Strep B Carrot Broth Kit tubes were incubated to determine color
development between 12-24 hrs at 35°C. Tube color was recorded at 12 hrs and
every 2 hrs until 24 hrs incubation had occurred. At 16 hrs, the minimum
concentration of GBS detected for both strains with Strep B Carrot Broth Kit was
103 CFU/ml. The LoD for the two GBS strains was confirmed by testing Strep B
Carrot Broth Kit with 20 replicated of each strain at the determined LoD
concentration (103 CFU/ml).
Analytical Reactivity
A study was conducted to demonstrate the sensitivity of Strep B Carrot Broth Kit in
detecting various GBS strains at a concentration of 103 CFU/ml. The study included
54 ATCC reference and clinical GBS strains representing seven of the nine different
serotypes (48 hemolytic, 6 non-hemolytic). Tubes were read at 24 hrs of incubation
for an orange color reaction, which was indicative of GBS. The inclusivity panel is
shown in Table 3 below.

In Strep B Carrot Broth Kit, all 48 β-hemolytic strains produced the expected orange
color, and all six non-hemolytic GBS strains showed a negative color reaction.
Results also demonstrated that Strep B Carrot Broth Kit was able to recover all non-
hemolytic GBS strains tested at the LoD (103 CFU/ml).
Incubation Study
An Incubation Study was conducted to determine the effect of various incubation
times on the performance of Strep B Carrot Broth Kit when tested with ten GBS
strains (hemolytic and non-hemolytic) at 103 CFU/ml concentration. The recovery of
organisms and development of characteristic color with broth cultures were
evaluated every 2 hrs from 12-24 hrs. At the earliest time point (12 hrs), all
hemolytic organisms produced some kind of orange color reaction (light orange to
orange). All GBS strains, including the non-hemolytic strain tested, were recovered
upon subculture of Strep B Carrot Broth Kit. The earliest incubation time set for
positive detection of GBS by color was 16 hrs.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-Reactivity Study
In order to evaluate the performance of Strep B Carrot Broth Kit with
microorganisms potentially encountered in vaginal/rectal swabs, a Cross-Reactivity
Study was completed with 78 non-target organisms (gram negative bacteria, gram
positive bacteria, and yeast) at approximately108 CFU/ml. Results showed that all 78
organisms from the cross-reactivity panel produced a negative color reaction with
Strep B Carrot Broth Kit. A total of 48 organisms (61.5%) were recoverable when
subcultured at the end of 24 hrs incubation. The cross-reactivity panel is shown in
Table 4 below.

Interference Study
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of potentially interfering
substances commonly found in vaginal/rectal swab specimens on the detection of six
hemolytic GBS strains at approximately 103 CFU/ml. Interfering substances were
tested at physiologically or biologically relevant concentrations and mixed with
bacterial suspensions. Development of color was evaluated after 18 hrs and 24 hrs
incubation in the presence of 21 interfering substances (Table 5). No interference
was observed with any substance at the highest clinically relevant concentration
when tested in negative specimen matrix.

organism was not recovered, the concentration of the non-target organism was
lowered 10-fold until the target organism was recovered.
At 24 hrs, both GBS strains (S. agalactiae, ATCC 12386 and S. agalactiae, ATCC
13813) gave the expected results in the presence of 108 CFU/ml of all non-target
strains in the Microbial Interference Study, except in the presence of Enterococcus
faecalis (ATCC 29212). In the presence of E. faecalis, proper color development
with the β-hemolytic GBS strain (ATCC 12386) was observed at 105 CFU/ml or
lower. For the non-hemolytic GBS strain (ATCC 13813) tested, it was recovered
upon subculture when the concentration of E. faecalis was 106 CFU/ml or lower.
The potential for high concentrations of E. faecalis to inhibit the detection and
recovery of GBS is noted as a Limitation in the device labeling.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Strep B Carrot Broth Kit was evaluated at four clinical sites. A total of 884
vaginal/rectal swabs from pregnant women were prospectively collected. Due to
protocol deviations (enrollment criteria not met), 108 specimens were excluded from
the study leaving 776 swab specimens to be inoculated and incubated in Strep B
Carrot Broth Kit. An additional 5 samples were excluded due to improper storage
(time of set-up) before enrichment. In total, 771 compliant specimens were included
in the final performance calculations.
A 30 µl aliquot of the clinical specimen in transport media was used to inoculate
Strep B Carrot Broth Kit, and the culture was incubated at 35-37°C for 24 hrs. The
samples included in the evaluation of performance consisted of 771 specimens
obtained in three different types of transport swabs/media—Liquid Stuart’s Sponge
(n=284), Liquid Amies Sponge (n=111), and Liquid Amies ESwab (n=376). For the
Reference Culture Method, vaginal/rectal specimens were tested by inoculating LIM
Broth with 30 µl of specimen from the transport swab system and incubating for 24
hrs at 35-37°C. Turbid LIM Broth cultures were subcultured to Tryptic Soy Agar

with 5% Sheep Blood, and all colonies with characteristic appearance suggestive of
GBS were screened to confirm the presence of GBS (both hemolytic and non-
hemolytic strains) using established laboratory methods: gram stain, catalase, latex
agglutination.
Color development after enrichment in Strep B Carrot Broth Kit was observed after
24 hrs. The Strep B Carrot enriched broth culture (regardless of color development)
was also subcultured to Tryptic Soy Agar with 5% Sheep Blood using a 10 µl loop,
and the agar plate was incubated for 24 hrs at 35-37°C in a CO enriched
2
environment. All colony types were submitted for identification. Results of Strep B
Carrot Broth Kit at 24 hrs incubation were compared to the Reference Culture
Method. The color change from white to orange with Strep B Carrot Broth Kit was
representative of a positive result for the presence of GBS. Tables 6-8 below show
the clinical performance data for Strep B Carrot Broth Kit vs the Reference Culture
Method (all sites). Performance (sensitivity and specificity) of Strep B Carrot Broth
Kit was calculated based on color development and the recovery of GBS from the
medium and compared to the recovery of β-hemolytic GBS and total GBS strains by
the Reference Culture Method.
All isolates with discrepant results were frozen in CryoSavers with Brucella Broth
and returned to Hardy Diagnostics for testing. The identity of each isolate was
confirmed (β-hemolytic GBS, non-hemolytic GBS, or non-GBS isolate). Once the
identity was confirmed, positive organisms (β-hemolytic GBS or non-hemolytic
GBS) were tested at LoD (103 CFU/ml) in donated negative-vaginal rectal matrix for
their recovery from the LIM Culture Reference Method, color development in Strep
B Carrot Broth Kit, and recovery from the Strep B Carrot Broth Kit + Subculture
method.

1 There were 7 False Positives observed. All isolates were re-tested and confirmed using the
discrepant analysis protocol described above. Three isolates that were originally negative by
LIM Reference Method showed a positive color reaction in Carrot Broth, but no β-hemolytic
GBS colonies were recovered upon subculture to Blood Agar. Of these three, both Blood
Agar plates from one sample (from LIM and Carrot Broth subcultured plates) were swarmed
with Proteus and no β-hemolytic GBS colonies could be isolated for confirmation. No β-
hemolytic GBS colonies were recovered from the frozen samples of the other two isolates,
and therefore, could not be confirmed. The remaining four discrepant isolates were
confirmed to be β-hemolytic GBS.
2 There were 20 False Negatives observed. All isolates were re-tested and confirmed using
the discrepant analysis protocol described above. Fourteen of the β-hemolytic GBS isolates
recovered from LIM, but originally gave a negative Carrot Broth color reaction, were
confirmed as β-hemolytic GBS and subsequently confirmed to have a positive Strep B Carrot
Broth Kit color reaction at LoD. Two isolates were identified as a very weak β-hemolytic
GBS and did not produce the expected color reaction in Strep B Carrot Broth Kit. Four
isolates were confirmed as non-hemolytic GBS with a negative color reaction in Strep B
Carrot Broth.

1Considering that non-hemolytic GBS cannot be detected by the medium’s color change and
require subculture for identification, there were seven specimens that were found to contain
non-hemolytic GBS strains upon subculture and identification by the Reference Method. If
these specimens are included as negatives, then the overall sensitivity and specificity values
observed when comparing the recovery of β-hemolytic GBS by the LIM Reference Method to
the Strep B Carrot Broth Kit color development can also be evaluated.
