L. Test Principle:
A small amount of specimen is transferred to a Lysis Tube using a swab. The Lysis Tube is
then subjected to heat‐treatment at 95 °C for five minutes. The heat‐treated sample is added
to a Dilution Tube, and then transferred to a Reaction Tube. The Reaction Tube contains
lyophilized HDA reagents, dNTPs, primers and probes. Once rehydrated with the diluted
sample, theReaction Tube is placed in Solana for amplification and detection of target
sequence. In Solana, the target sequence is amplified by specific primers and detected by a
specific fluorescence probe included in the Reaction Tube. A competitive process control
(PRC) is included in the Lysis Tube to monitor sample processing, inhibitory substances in
clinical samples, reagent failure or device failure. The PRC is amplified by the target‐specific
primers and detected by a PRC specific fluorescence probe. The target and PRC probes are
labeled with a quencher on one end and a fluorophore on the other end. Upon annealing to
target or PRC amplicons, the fluorescence signal increases due to physical separation of
fluorophore from quencher. Solana measures and interprets the fluorescent signal, using
on‐board method‐specific algorithms. Solana then report the test results to the user on its
display screen, and it can print out the results via a printer.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To evaluate the reproducibility of the Solana C. difficile Assay, a blinded and
randomized study panel was tested at one internal site and two external clinical sites.
The panel was contrived in negative stool matrix and consisted of negative samples
and positive samples spiked with toxigenic C. difficile at the following three organism
concentration levels: moderate positive (3.4 x 103 CFU/mL), low positive (1.7 x 103
CFU/mL), and high negative (4.8 x 102 CFU/mL). Each site tested the panel and
external positive and negative controls in triplicate for five non-consecutive days.
Testing was conducted by two operators at each site with two runs per day.
The Solana C. difficile Assay produced the expected results in 98.9% (89/90) of the
low positive samples, 100% (90/90) of the moderate positive samples, and 100%
(90/90) of the negative samples. The assay produced positive results in 47.8% (43/90)
of the high negative samples which was within the expected range of 20 to 80%
positive results. The results did not vary between sites, days, or runs.
The external positive and negative controls produced the expected results for all
replicates and no invalid control results were observed during the study. The
reproducibility study results were acceptable. The results are summarized in Table 1.

conditions that may be observed in a clinical setting. Specimen stability was also
assessed in the prospective clinical study that tested 852 specimens stored for up to
three days at 2° to 8°C. The results of clinical and analytical studies supported the
storage of unpreserved stool specimens at 2 to 8oC for up to three days before testing.
Controls:
The Solana C. difficile assay incorporates several controls to monitor assay
performance.
A competitive process control (PRC) is included in the Lysis Tube to monitor sample
processing, inhibitory substances in clinical samples, reagent failure or device failure.
The PRC is amplified by the target‐specific primers and detected by a PRC specific
fluorescence probe.
External positive and negative controls for toxigenic C. difficile (such as the Quidel
Molecular C. difficile Control Set available separately) are intended to be tested and
processed as if they were patient specimens. The external positive control is intended
to monitor substantial reagent and instrument failure. The external negative control is
used to detect reagent or environmental contamination (or carry-over) by C. difficile
DNA or amplicon.
It is recommended that the reactivity of each new lot and each new shipment of the
Solana C. difficile Assay be verified by testing external controls on receipt and before
the new lot or shipment are put into use. External control tests should be performed
thereafter in accordance with appropriate federal, state and local guidelines. The
Solana C. difficile assay should not be used in patient testing if the external controls
do not produce the correct results.
During the prospective clinical study, external positive and negative controls were
tested daily at each site. A total of 80 positive controls and 80 negative controls were
tested across all sites, and all controls produced the expected results. Out of a total of
854 specimens tested during the study, two (0.2%) produced invalid Solana C.
difficile Assay results and both specimens remained invalid after repeat testing.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical sensitivity/ Limit of detection
The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the Solana C. difficile Assay was determined using
serial dilutions of two toxigenic C. difficile strains, ATCC BAA‐1805 and CCUG
20309 spiked in negative stool matrix. The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration
of C. difficile in the sample at which 95% of all replicates tested positive. The LoD
was confirmed by testing an additional 20 replicates of each strain at the LoD
concentration in two additional lots of reagents. The results of the LoD study are
summarized in Table 2.

Serial dilutions of a preparation of quantified C. difficile genomic DNA, BAA‐
1382DQ™ spiked in lysis buffer were also tested with the Solana C. difficile Assay.
The genomic DNA was detected in 95% or more of all replicates at a concentration
equivalent to 15 copies per assay.
Analytical reactivity (Inclusivity):
The inclusivity of the Solana C. difficile Assay was evaluated by testing an additional
twenty three strains of toxigenic C. difficile representing multiple toxinotypes. Solana
C. difficile Assay testing was performed on three replicates of each strain spiked in
negative stool matrix at a concentration near the LoD (1.83 x 104 CFU/mL, 2X LOD
concentration as determined for ATCC BAA-1805). All twenty-three additional
strains were detected in all replicates by the Solana C. difficile Assay at this
concentration.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity/ Microbial interference
The analytical specificity of the Solana C. difficile Assay was evaluated by testing a
panel of sixty‐eight bacterial, viral and yeast microorganisms and human DNA
representing enteric pathogens, flora or nucleic acids commonly present in the
intestine. Microorganisms were tested at 106 CFU/mL or higher for bacteria and
yeast, 105 PFU/mL (or TCID /mL) or higher for viruses, and 106 copies/mL for
50
human DNA. The microorganisms were mixed with pooled negative stool matrix and
tested directly for cross‐reactivity. The microorganisms were also tested in stool
matrix in the presence of two strains of toxigenic C. difficile (CCUG 20309 or ATCC
BAA 1805 tested separately) at 2X LOD for potential microbial interference. Three
replicates were tested for each sample. Potential cross reactivity of Clostridium
botulinum with assay primers and probes was evaluated in silico analysis of genomic
DNA sequences since this organism was not available for wet testing. In silico
analysis did not predict C. botulinum cross reactivity with the assay primers. No cross
reactivity or microbial interference was observed with any of the wet tested panel
members. Table 4 lists the microorganisms evaluated in these studies.

Carryover – Cross Contamination
A study was conducted to evaluate the Solana C. difficile Assay for potential
carryover and cross contamination. Two samples were prepared: a high positive
sample consisting of toxigenic C. difficile strain CCUG 20309 at 4.9 x 106 CFU/mL
in negative stool matrix, and a negative sample consisting of unspiked stool matrix.
Positive and negative samples were tested in alternating fashion on the Solana C.
difficile Assay by two operators over 10 runs for a total of 50 positive and 50
negative results. No carryover was observed in the study.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off values for the Solana C. difficile Assay were based on specific parameters
of the amplification curve calculated from results from preliminary LoD studies and
initial clinical specimen testing. The cut-offs were set based on the longest amount of
time to obtain a positive amplification result.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Performance characteristics of the Solana C. difficile Assay were established during a
prospective study conducted from November 2016 to February 2017. Eight hundred
fifty-four left-over specimens from patients suspected of having CDI were collected
from three distinct geographical sites across the United States. The patient ages

ranged from less than two years old to > 60 years, and 799 (93.6%) were 22 years old
or older. The specimens were tested raw with the Solana C. difficile Assay at the sites
on the day of collection or after storage for up to three days at 2 to 8°C. The Solana
results were compared to a “broth enhanced” toxigenic bacterial culture and
separately compared to a FDA-cleared molecular test. An alternate FDA-cleared
molecular test was used for discrepant analysis.
Comparison with broth enhanced toxigenic bacterial culture
Eight hundred fifty-four (854) raw specimens were tested by both the Solana C.
difficile Assay and broth enhanced toxigenic culture. For the toxigenic culture
method, samples were inoculated into chopped-meat glucose (CMG) broth and after
48-hours sub-cultured onto CCFA-HB plates. Suspicious colonies were further
characterized and C. difficile identified colonies were sub-cultured in CMG broth for
subsequent cytotoxin testing. Two specimens (0.2%) were invalid in the Solana C.
difficile Assay when tested according to the Solana C. difficile Assay draft
instructions for use. Both specimens remained invalid upon repeat testing and were
removed from further analysis. The combined results of the remaining eight hundred
fifty-two specimens are summarized in Table 6.
