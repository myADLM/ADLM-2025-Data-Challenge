L. Test Principle:
The BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgM kit employs a panel of three antigen-coated fluoromagnetic beads
with unique fluorescent signatures to identify the presence of IgM class antibodies to T. gondii,
Rubella virus, and CMV antigens in a two-step assay format. In the first step, the system
combines an aliquot of patient sample with sample diluent and bead reagent and then agitates the
mixture at 37°C. In the second step, immobilized IgM is identified indirectly using a fluorescent

anti-human IgM reporter conjugate in a manner similar to antibody detection using an enzyme-
linked reporter in an EIA. The assay is calibrated using a set of two distinct calibrator vials,
supplied separately by Bio-Rad Laboratories. One vial containing negative sample, one vial
containing T. gondii IgM, Rubella IgM, and CMV IgM are used for qualitative calibration of the
assays.Two control beads are used. One is used to normalize assay output for fluctuations in
detector function (internal standard bead, ISB) and the other control bead is used to verify that
the sample is serum or plasma (serum verification bead, SVB). The fluorescent properties of the
beads allow multi-analyte data to be acquired simultaneously from a single sample and
segregated based upon the fluorescent codes embedded in the antigen-coated and control beads.
The magnetic properties of the beads allow rapid washing to remove unbound molecules in
between assay steps. Bead classification and reporter data are acquired as the beads flow through
the reader which uses a dual laser detector employing the same principles utilized by
fluorescence activated cell sorters. Raw data are reported as relative fluorescent intensity (RFI).

Reproducibility:
A reproducibility panel, consisting of six (6) panel members made using serum
matrix and BioPlex ToRC IgM QC controls was prepared by Bio-Rad Laboratories.
The serum sample panel included one (1) low negative, one (1) high negative, one
(1) low positive near cut-off, one (1) medium positive, and one (1) high positive
sample, and one (1) positive control for all three (3) analytes. Reproducibility testing
was performed at three (3) US testing facilities using one (1) lot of the BioPlex 2200
ToRC IgM Pack, one (1) lot of BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgM Calibrator Set and one (1)
lot of BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgM Control Set. The panels were provided to each of the
testing sites. Each of the panel members and control sets were tested in replicates of
four (4) on two runs per day over five (5) days at three (3) sites (4 replicates x 2 runs

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrator Traceability
The BioPlex ToRC IgM calibrators are traceable against frozen internal standards
which are anchored to a quantitation panel. The quantitation panel consists of patient
samples whose analyte values span the assay range.
The BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgM Reagent Kit is calibrated using a set of two distinct
serum based calibrators. A negative calibrator and a multianalyte T. gondii, Rubella
CMV IgM calibrator are used to calibrate the T. gondii, Rubella and CMV IgM
assays. The cut-off value and assignment of the calibrators were determined by
determining the 98-99th percentile on normal samples and performing concordance
and Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis during feasibility and
development.
The manufacturing target ranges of the Calibrator Set are listed below.
Calibrator Set Range (AI)
Calibrator Level 1 0.0 – 0.2
Calibrator Level 2 1.1 – 2.0
Controls
The control set includes two vials each of a negative control and a multianalyte
positive control that contains T. gondii, Rubella and CMV IgM. The positive control
contains known concentrations of human T. gondii, Rubella and CMV IgM, and is
prepared by blending human disease state serum (T. gondii and CMV) and human
recombinant Rubella IgM (huCal) with ToRC IgM negative serum matrix.
The assignment for the BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgM Control Set is performed using a
minimum of two reagent lots along with matched calibrators with a target of three
reagent lots with matched calibrators. For each control lot, three vials per control
level are tested in replicates of five on all reagent lots for a total of fifteen replicates
per reagent lot. This testing is performed on three analyzers yielding a total of forty-
five replicates per reagent lot. The total number of replicates for each control level is
90 when two reagent lots are used and 135 when three reagent lots are used.
The manufacturing target ranges of the Control Set are listed below.
Control Set Range (AI)
Negative Control 0.0 – 0.5
Positive Control 2.0 – 2.6

d. Detection limit:
Not Applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross Reactivity:
The study was conducted to determine if samples from various disease states interfere
with test results when tested with the BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgM kit. A panel of at least
ten (10) specimens that are positive for each cross reactant were evaluated for
possible cross reactivity with the BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgM kit for each of the three
antibody assays. The potentially cross reactive samples were tested in commercially
available predicate kits in order to confirm their negative status for the target analyte.
Cross reactivity, expressed as percent negative agreement is calculated by the ratio of
the number of negative results to the total number of samples assayed for each cross
reactant set of samples The results of each potential cross reactant are listed below.

f. Assay cut-off:
A final cut-off of 1.0 AI was established for the BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgM assay based
on an evaluation of 401, 454 and 511 test-ordered and retrospective positive samples
for T. gondii, Rubella and CMV IgM, respectively, for which the serological status
was determined from the predicate T. gondii, Rubella and CMV IgM assays. The
assay employs an equivocal zone that brackets the cut-off, which results in samples >
1.1 AI being positive and < 0.9 AI being negative. This analysis was used to optimize
sensitivity and specificity for the BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgM assay.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not Applicable
b. Matrix comparison:
Matched serum and plasma (EDTA and heparin sodium) samples drawn from the
same donor were acquired from an outside reference lab. For each assay in the panel,
a minimum of 40 sets of paired serum and plasma samples were prepared and values
within the measurement range of the assay were analyzed in accordance with CLSI
EP09-A3. Samples were assayed in replicates of two (2) with the second replicate run
in reverse order. Mean plasma AI values were compared to matched mean serum AI
values. Linear regression analysis was used to determine the presence of a matrix
effect when compared to serum. The regression correlation parameters for slope,
intercept and correlation coefficient (r) are shown below.

Retrospective Study:
Performance of the BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgM kit was also evaluated against
corresponding commercially available T. gondii, Rubella, and CMV IgM
immunoassays using presumptive positive samples. Three clinical sites tested 210 T.

Correlation with CDC Evaluation Panels:
A correlation study was performed to evaluate the characteristics of the BioPlex 2200
ToRC IgM kit with serum panels provided by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) for T. gondii IgM. The results are presented as a means to convey
further information on the performance. This does not imply an endorsement of the
BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgM kit by the CDC. Results are presented in the table below.

IgM Specificity:
Samples positive for T. gondii, Rubella and CMV IgM and IgG were treated with
dithiothreitol (DTT) to inactivate IgM activity. The samples were assayed neat and
diluted into assay range in replicates of two. IgM was measured using the BioPlex
2200 ToRC IgM kit.
