I. Device Description:
The InSure ONE – One Day Fecal Immunochemical Test qualitatively detects human
hemoglobin from blood in fecal samples. The fecal sample is generally collected by the test
subject at home. Stool samples in toilet bowl water are collected using long handled brushes
to collect a small volume of water from around the defecated stool. Once collected, the
stool sample is placed on an InSure ONE Test Card. The InSure ONE Test Card then serves
as a means to transport the dried stool sample to the laboratory. The test reaction is
developed in the clinical laboratory or medical professional office with appropriate quality
control.
Components of InSure ONE – One Day Fecal Immunochemical Test:
a. The InSure ONE Collection Kit contains:
· InSure ONE Instructions for Use-Patient
· InSure ONE Test Card
· Brush Kit containing 2 brushes and a waste bag
· Business reply form and envelope
b. The InSure ONE Developer Components (for development and interpretation of the test)
contains:
· InSure ONE Instructions for Use-Professional Laboratory

· InSure Test Strips: The Test Strips contain a mouse monoclonal anti-human
hemoglobin Test Line and a conjugate-specific polyclonal (donkey anti-goat)
antibody Control Line and a conjugate of anti-human hemoglobin polyclonal
antibodies bound to colored (colloidal gold) particles.
· InSure Run Buffer: Contains borate salts, ethanol, bovine serum albumin, and
sodium azide as preservative.

L. Test Principle:
The InSure ONE Test uses the principle of immunochromatography to detect human
hemoglobin in samples of toilet bowl water collected from around the stool after defecation.
The test result is obtained from one stool sample. The toilet bowl water is collected after
brushing the surface of the stool to release any blood into the surrounding water. Long handled
brushes are used to collect and transfer two samples of toilet bowl water from one bowel
movement to the InSure ONE Test Card. The InSure ONE Test Card is used to transport the
dried sample to the testing site. At the testing site, an immunochromatographic Test Strip is
inserted into the Test Card and Run Buffer is added to rehydrate the sample and to extract the
hemoglobin, if present, from the sample. The sample flows along the InSure ONE Test Strip,
rehydrates the colloidal gold anti-human hemoglobin conjugate and, if hemoglobin is present,
forms a hemoglobin-conjugate immune complex. The complex is then captured on the Test
Strip, in a zone containing immobilized anti-human hemoglobin antibodies, to form a visible
test line – a positive test. No test line is indicative of the absence of human hemoglobin in the
sample – a negative test. Unbound conjugate continues to migrate along the InSure ONE Test
Strip and binds to the control line, which contains conjugate-specific antibodies. The control
line confirms that the reagent flow is complete and the test is functional.

f. Assay cut-off:
Fecal test samples were prepared by spiking stool samples with human blood of known
hemoglobin concentration, to obtain the following fecal hemoglobin concentrations: 0
μg Hb/g stool, 5 μg Hb/g stool, 10 μg Hb/g stool, 20 μg Hb/g stool, 30 μg Hb/g stool, 40
μg Hb/g stool, 50 μg Hb/g stool, 60 μg Hb/g stool and 80 μg Hb/g stool. Pre-measured
quantities of stool spiked with different levels of hemoglobin were placed in a pre-
measured volume of water to simulate toilet water in which stool will be deposited.
Following deposition of the stool, water samples were taken at 2 minutes with the InSure
sample collection brushes and applied to Test Cards using the InSure FIT and the InSure
ONE sampling procedures. Testing was performed side-by-side with the predicate by
comparing the test results of the device with that of the predicate. Test Cards were
prepared on Day 0, stored at room temperature (20–25°C) and developed on Day 5 to
simulate the time span between the patient collecting the fecal water sample on the Test
Card and transporting the sampled Test Card to the laboratory by mail. The cut-off was
determined to be 50 μg hemoglobin/g stool.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison between the InSure ONE and the predicate test–InSure FIT, was
conducted to determine if there was a significant difference in test performance between
sampling two separate fecal samples once each or a single fecal sample, sampled twice,
for detection of occult blood. Patients were recruited from three intended use sites and
the study was performed at one intended use site in Australia. The study included an
enriched population of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms or a history of past
colorectal disease that were scheduled to have a colonoscopy for any reason:
· Patients in an endoscopy unit at a large public hospital that maintained a database
of individuals under surveillance, based on their family history or personal
history of colorectal cancer or adenomas.
· Patients from the general population based on referral to colonoscopy from their
general practitioners for a prior positive fecal occult blood test or other indication.
· Patients from the general population with GI related conditions (i.e., abdominal pain,

A total of 859 patients (ages 20 – 93 years old) collected fecal water samples using the
InSure FIT (Test Card A) and InSure ONE (Test Card B and Test Card C) prior to
colonoscopy. Tissue samples collected at colonoscopy were histopathologically
examined for the type of lesion (i.e., cancer, advanced adenoma, etc.). Statistical
analysis of the test results for clinical positive percent agreement (PPA) and clinical
negative percent agreement (NPA) showed that the InSure ONE test results have
acceptable overall agreement with the InSure FIT test results. The study demonstrated
that there were no statistically significant differences in the test results obtained from
two fecal water sample aliquots taken from one bowel movement (new sampling method
with InSure ONE), when compared to one fecal water sample aliquot taken from two
separate bowel movements (predicate sampling method with InSure FIT).

b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Not applicable
N. Instrument Name:
Not applicable
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or
mobile device?
Yes ________ or No ___x_____
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using
wireless transmission?
Yes ________ or No ___x_____
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this
line of product types:
Yes ________ or No __x______
3. Specimen Identification:
Enter patient identification information manually on the label of the Test Card.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
10

--- Page 11 ---
Two separate applications of the fecal water sample, taken from the same bowel movement
using a new sample collection brush for each sample. The first fecal water sample is applied
to window “1” and the second fecal water sample from the same bowel movement is applied
to window “2” on the same Test Card. The sample flap is then sealed with the peel off label.
The patient provides their name, date of birth and date the sample was collected on the label
included in the instructions for use. The test sample is placed in Test Card in the envelope
provided and returned to the laboratory or medical professional office either by mail or
personal delivery.
5. Calibration:
Not applicable
6. Quality Control:
Internal Controls: Procedural controls are included in the test device. A pink line appearing
the control region is considered as the internal procedural control. The internal procedural
control confirms the following: the conjugate was properly hydrated and has flowed through
the test and control line areas, the control line antibodies were immunoreactive, and the
conjugate is intact. The test is invalid if the control line does not appear.
External Control: It is recommended that positive and negative controls be performed to
verify proper test performance. The Enterix Insure FIT FOBT Controls (positive and
negative) cleared in K101831, are recommended for use as external controls.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports substantial
equivalence decision.
