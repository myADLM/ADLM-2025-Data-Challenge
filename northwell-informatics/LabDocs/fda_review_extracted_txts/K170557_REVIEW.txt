I. Device Description:
The GenePOC GBS LB Assay is a single-use test for the qualitative detection of GBS DNA
from enriched vaginal/rectal swab specimens using real-time PCR technology and
fluorogenic oligonucleotide probes. The assay is automated and utilizes a microfluidic
cartridge for the simultaneous detection of the target GBS DNA and the internal process
control (PrC) DNA on the revogene instrument.
The GenePOC GBS LB Assay is composed of a GBS-specific disposable microfluidic
cartridge (PIE), Sample Buffer Tube (SBT) and Disposable Transfer Tool (DTT). These
components are used to lyse and dilute the sample, amplify, and detect GBS nucleic acid
from vaginal/rectal swabs following LIM Broth enrichment. User intervention is required for
sample preparation, adding LIM Broth enriched samples into the SBT, transferring the
2

--- Page 3 ---
sample into the cartridge, and loading/unloading the cartridge into the revogene instrument.
Once the sample is added into the cartridge, the process is then fully automated. Each test kit
contains 24 individual pouches.
The revogene instrument can process from one up to a maximum of 8 samples
simultaneously in the same run. On completion of a run, the results are reported by the
revogene instrument from measured fluorescent signals and embedded calculation
algorithms. For the GBS application, two signals are processed: GBS target and PrC. The
output results can be reported as positive, negative, indeterminate, or unresolved. On
completion of a run, the user removes the used cartridges and disposes of them in normal
biological waste. Results may be viewed, printed, transferred, and/or stored by the user.

L. Test Principle:
Vaginal-rectal swab specimens are collected and used to inoculate LIM Broth. After
incubation at 35-37°C for 18-24 hours in ambient air, 15 μl of the enriched broth culture is
transferred to the SBT. After vortexing the SBT for 15 seconds, approximately 150 µl of the
inoculated sample buffer is transferred into the GenePOC microfluidic cartridge (PIE) using
the DTT. The loaded GBS LB cartridge is placed into the revogene for further sample
processing. No operator intervention is necessary once the clinical sample is loaded onto the
revogene.
Each GBS LB microfluidic cartridge is a completely integrated and self-contained cartridge.
Each sample is transferred by centrifugation from one microfluidic chamber to the next in
sequence, where all reagents specific for the PCR reaction are incorporated and dried within
the PCR wells. The step-wise process includes sample homogenization, lysis of cells, and
specimen dilution followed by subsequent real-time PCR steps within 1 PCR well in the
cartridge. An internal Process Control (PrC) is contained in the homogenization chamber and
is present in every test to monitor the analytical process (including sample lysis, dilution and
nucleic acid amplification, and detection) for the presence of potential inhibitory substances
as well as system or reagent failures.The amplified products are detected in real time using
target-specific TaqMan chemistry-based probes. The GBS LB-specific designed primers and
probe detect a target region of 190 base pairs of the cfb geneof the Streptococcus agalactiae
genome. The results are reported by the revogenefrom measured fluorescent signals and
embedded calculation algorithms.
Interpretation of Sample Results
The analysis software associated with the revogene instrument determines results for GBS and
PrC based on the amplification cycle (Ct) values provided in the assay protocol file. The

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the GenePOC GBS LB Assay was evaluated by testing three
reagent lots of the assay on three revogene instruments (one per site) with two operators
at each of three sites for five days. A blinded and randomized reproducibility panel
containing three GBS strains was tested in triplicate at two concentrations in negative
matrix: low positive (735 CFU/ml) and moderate positive (1,125 CFU/ml). A
Precision Study was based on the within-site variability over five days. The GBS
strains used in the panel included two hemolytic strains (ATCC 12400 and ATCC
12403) and one non-hemolytic strain (ATCC 13813). Two true negative samples
(LIM Broth matrix previously inoculated with vaginal/rectal swabs that was
determined to be GBS negative) were also included as panel members. Across three
sites, a total of 720 replicates were tested with the GenePOC GBS LB Assay. For
site-to-site reproducibility, the overall percent agreement with expected result (i.e.,
negative for true negative and positive for moderate positive and low positive
samples) was >95% for all GBS strains tested at low positive and high positive
concentration. The true negatives yielded expected results 100% of the time. During
the Reproducibility and Precision Study, one unresolved result and one indeterminate

with each specimen tested and monitors the efficacy of the DNA extraction and
PCR amplification processes.
External Controls: External controls should be tested according to guidelines or
requirements of local, provincial and/or federal regulations or accreditation
organizations. Commercial control material (e.g., Streptococcus agalactiae
ATCC 13813) can be used as a positive external control. It is recommended that
bacterial strains be freshly prepared in LIM Broth. Transfer a 15 μl aliquot of an
18-24 hour culture in LIM broth into a SBT. Pure LIM Broth is recommended
for use as a negative external control. The GenePOC GBS LB Assay does not
include external positive and negative controls.
During the clinical study, positive and negative external controls were tested with
the GenePOC GBS LB Assay daily. Overall, it was reported that 99.5% of the
external controls yielded the expected results (189/190). The submitted external
control data are acceptable.
Reagent Stability
A Reagent Stability Study was conducted with three GenePOC GBS LB reagent
lots and three revogene instruments. Stability of the kits stored at both 4°C and
25°C was evaluated at the following time points: Day 0, Day 14, Month 1, Month
2, Month 4, and Month 5. The three reagent lots were not produced on the same
date and, therefore, testing was staggered. For every stability point, six cartridges
per condition were processed. All SBT were inoculated with 15μl of LIM Broth
containing GBS gDNA.
Results of the study indicated that the GenePOC GBS LB Assay reagents were
stable up to 4 months with conditioning at 4°C and 25°C. Testing of all lots is
ongoing at GenePOC until the 15 month time point is reached.
LIM Broth Stability and SBT Stability
For both the LIM Broth Culture and inoculated SBT Stability Studies, performance of
the GenePOC GBS LB Assay was assessed when broth cultures and SBT were stored
at room temperature and 2 – 8°C across several time points: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 12
days. All testing was performed on three revogene instruments. One strain of GBS
was tested at 1,125 CFU/ml and prepared in negative matrix for the positive samples.
An aliquot of negative matrix was used to prepare negative samples. Four replicates
were tested at each time point and storage condition per lot across three lots. Results
from the nested stability study at room temperature (25 + 2°C) showed that enriched
LIM Broth culture could be stored at 25 + 2°C for up to 48 hrs before inoculating
SBT (then held at room temperature for an extra 3 days) and still detect 4/4 GBS
samples per condition. Two unexpected results were obtained in the room
temperature stability test. One sample during the room temperature study yielded an
unresolved assay result; it was re-tested and yielded a positive result. Also, one
replicate yielded a false negative GBS result with LIM Broth stored for 48 hrs at
room temperature only, which was considered a worst-case scenario. For the LIM
Broth stored at 2-8°C up to 3 days, all tested samples produced the expected results.

--- Page 10 ---
LIM Broth culture stored for 3 days at 2-8°C was then used to inoculate SBT and
held up to 12 days at 2-8°C. All SBT samples produced the expected results when
stored for 12 days at 2-8°C. In addition, all positive and negative external controls
yielded the expected results during the study. The initial rate of unresolved results
was 0.3% (1/336). No indeterminate results were obtained during the study. Table 5
shows results of the stability studies with LIM Broth culture and inoculated SBT. The
results support claims for the following in the package insert:
· LIM Broth Culture stored at 25°C for up to 2 days or at 2-8°C for up to 3
days.
· Inoculated SBT stored at 25°C for up to 3 days or at 2-8°C for up to 5 days.

PIE Stability
To establish the sample stability after loading the sample into a cartridge, a true
negative and one strain of GBS (ATCC 12403) spiked at 1,125 CFU/ml in SB were
tested at room temperature in duplicate across three time points: 0, 60 minutes, and
120 minutes. Assays were performed using three reagent lots and three revogene
instruments. All samples yielded the expected results. A sample stability of 60
minutes in the PIE will be claimed. No unresolved or indeterminate results were
obtained in the study.
d. Detection limit:
LoD
A Limit of Detection (LoD) study was performed to evaluate the analytical
sensitivity of the GenePOC GBS LB Assay using two representative strains of GBS
(ATCC 12403 and ATCC 13813). Preliminary LoD concentrations were determined
by serially diluting strains in negative clinical LIM Broth matrix from 5,000
CFU/ml down to 150 CFU/ml per strain. For each strain, eight replicates were tested at
each dilution across three GenePOC GBS LB assay lots. The observed LoD of each
GBS strain was determined as the lowest concentration that had a positivity rate of ≥
95%. While the preliminary LoD for ATCC 13813 GBS strain was estimated to be
10

at 200 CFU/ml, the LOD for ATCC 12403 GBS strain was determined to be 375
CFU/ml. The analytical studies were performed using these two strains based on the
final assay LoD claims. Only one sample was reported as unresolved for an initial
unresolved rate of 0.3% (1/384). Repeat testing yielded a valid result.
The LoD concentrations determined in the preliminary study were confirmed with
the same GBS reference strains (diluted to the preliminary LoD concentrations) and
tested with twenty-four (24) replicates. A third GBS strain was added (ATCC 12400)
to the confirmation panel, where the LoD was estimated to be 375 CFU/ml. The final
LoDs values for these strains are presented in Table 6 below.

Analytical Reactivity
The analytical reactivity (inclusivity) of the GenePOC GBS LB Assay was evaluated
with a panel of twelve Streptococcus agalactiae strains representing 11 serotypes (Ia,
Ib, Ic, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX) and one non-hemolytic strain. Each isolate was
tested with twenty-four (24) replicates in negative matrix at a concentration near the
LoD based on the average CFU/ml from the three isolates tested in the LoD study. If
the positivity rate for GBS was not 100%, sample GBS strain concentrations were
increased until all replicates were positive. Table 7 below provides a list of GBS
strains tested and the test concentration where 100% of the replicates were positive
for GBS.

aThe higher concentrations needed to obtain 100% positivity are not a concern as the enriched
LIM Broth culture is expected to have GBS organism concentrations well-above the assay LoD.

e. Analytical specificity:
A study was conducted to determine the cross-reactivity of 75 microorganisms (or
gDNA/RNA) that represented various non-GBS groups of Streptococci, along with
other bacteria, parasites, and viruses normally found in vaginal and anal flora, with
the GenePOC GBS LB Assay. Bacteria and yeasts were tested at > 106 CFU/ml in
SB, whereas viruses, parasites and human DNA were tested at > 105 DNA or RNA
cp/ml in SB. Samples were tested in triplicate and spiked into negative enriched LIM
Broth.
The results for all replicates in the cross-reactivity study were negative,
demonstrating that the organisms or gDNA/RNA tested at these concentrations did
not cross react with the GenePOC GBS LB Assay. During the study, no unresolved or
indeterminate results were obtained with any of the organisms tested. Table 8 shows
the cross-reactivity panel tested for this study.

f. Interfering Studies
Microbial Interference
This study was performed to evaluate potential interference from common
microorganisms (associated with vaginal/rectal flora) with the detection of GBS by
the GenePOC GBS LB Assay. All testing was completed with three reagent lots and
three revogene instruments. For testing, non-target organisms were grouped into 7
pools according to Table 9 shown below. Pools were diluted to obtain a concentration
of 105 or 106 CFU/ml (or cp/ml) of SB and tested in triplicate. Each of the seven
pools was a tested in the presence of negative LIM Broth culture with two GBS
strains. Both ATCC 13813 and ATCC 12403 were tested at 735 CFU/ml. No
interference from non-target organisms was observed, except for GBS strains in the
presence with Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 19433), Enterococcus faecium (ATCC
19434), and Lactobacillus acidophilus (ATCC 4356). Interference with Enterococcus
faecalis (ATCC 19433) was observed with both GBS strains at 106 CFU/ml. No
interference was observed with both GBS strains when Enterococcus faecalis was
lowered to 105 CFU/ml. For Enterococcus faecium, all three replicates of GBS strain
ATCC 12403 were detected at 104 CFU/ml. At 105 CFU/ml of Lactobacillus
acidophilus, GBS strain ATCC 12403 was inhibited. When the concentration of
Lactobacillus acidophilus was lowered to 104 CFU/ml, all three replicates of GBS
strain ATCC 12403 could be detected. All pools, when tested in the absence of GBS,
yielded the expected negative result with the assay. No interference with the internal
process control was observed when microorganisms were present in high loads (105
or 106 CFU/ml of SB). The initial rate of unresolved results obtained during the study
was 0.8% (1/133). This unresolved sample replicate was successfully repeated. No
indeterminate results were obtained. The potential for high concentrations of E.
faecalis, E. faecium, and L. acidophilus to inhibit the detection of GBS is noted as a
Limitation in the device labeling. The results of the Microbial Interference Study are
acceptable.

Interfering Substances
This study was conducted to evaluate the potential interference of a panel of 31
endogenous and exogenous substances with the GenePOC GBS LB Assay.
Potentially interfering substances were distributed into 11 pools for testing. Samples
were prepared in triplicate with one of two strains of GBS (ATCC 13813 and ATCC
12403) in negative LIM Broth and diluted to 735 CFU/ml in SB in the presence of the
potential interferent. LIM Broth served as a negative sample. Interfering substances
were added at concentrations that would be expected to be observed among patient
specimens. Interference was observed against GBS strain ATCC 12403 in the

presence of Pool E (1.5 µg/ml loperamide hydrochloride, 45 µg/ml bismuth
subsalicylate, and 0.735 µg/ml sennosides). When tested individually, no interference
on the detection of GBS strain ATCC 12403 was observed with the substances from
Pool E. Interference pools used for the study are highlighted in Table 10 and Table 11
below. Fecal fat was not tested due to lack of supply. One indeterminate result was
obtained for a positive external control to yield an initial indeterminate rate of 0.75%
(1/133). After re-testing, the control yielded a valid positive result. No unresolved
results were obtained during the study. Eight samples were excluded due to: errors in
the placement of the PIE cartridge, wrong sample tested, or wrong PIE lot tested. All
samples were re-tested according to the study protocol and the re-test results were
used to replace the previous results. Results of the Interference Study are acceptable.

g. Carry-over/Cross Contamination
Carry-over and cross contamination for the GenePOC GBS LB Assay was assessed
with two operators conducting a total of 20 runs of 8 samples in each run. Samples were
tested in an alternating pattern with high positive samples and negative samples
(within-run and between-run). No carry-over and cross contamination was observed. The
overall percent agreement was 100% for positive and negative samples. No
unexpected results, including unresolved or indeterminate results, were obtained
during the study.
h. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off was established and validated by evaluating the performance of the
GenePOC GBS LB Assay on the revogene instrument in two separate studies. A total
of 258 LIM specimens were tested with the GenePOC GBS LB Assay and with the
Reference Culture Method. In the first study, the assay cut-off and thresholds for the
GenePOC GBS LB Assay were established by testing 133 fresh specimens previously
enriched in LIM Broth. Testing was conducted on one revogene instrument with three
unique GBS LB PIE lots. In the second study, testing was performed to validate the
cut-offs from an additional 125 frozen LIM specimens. Testing was conducted on one
revogene with the same three GBS LB PIE lots utilized for Study 1. The cut-off
values for a positive result for both the internal process control and GBS were set at
Ct values <45 and an EP Threshold at 125. Using these cut-offs, a sensitivity of
98.3% (58/59) (95% CI: 91.0-99.7%) and a specificity of 99.0% (197/199)(95% CI:
96.4-99.7%) were reported after testing the 258 specimens.

b. Matrix comparison:

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
GenePOC conducted a prospective multi-center trial at 4 geographically diverse
clinical trial sites (two Canadian and two US clinical sites). Vaginal/rectal swab
specimens were collected from pregnant women at 35-37 weeks of gestation for
whom GBS diagnostic procedures were indicated and ordered. Vaginal/rectal
specimen swabs were collected and cultured according to established guidelines;
swabs were placed in LIM Broth and incubated for 18-24 hrs at 35-37°C in ambient
17

air or 5% CO . Residual de-identified LIM Broth cultures were used for testing with
2
the GenePOC GBS LB Assay. A total of 839 vaginal/rectal swab specimens initially
met the study criteria. Sixty-eight (68) specimens were shown to be non-compliant
for the following reasons:
· Transport and storage times exceeded study protocol requirements (1)
· Samples did not have all test results as required by the study protocol (4)
· Reference Method and/or GenePOC GBS LB Assay not performed according to
the clinical trial protocol (63)
For the Reference Culture Method, LIM Broth cultures were subcultured to a non-
selective blood agar, and all colonies with a characteristic appearance suggestive of
GBS were screened to confirm the presence of GBS using established laboratory
methods: gram stain, catalase, latex agglutination, and CAMP test. The CAMP test
was only used at one site in addition to the other biochemical tests listed. If GBS was
not presumptively identified after incubation for 18-24 hrs on sheep blood agar plates,
the plates were further incubated overnight and then re-inspected to identify suspect
colonies. Originally, the Reference Culture Method revealed 156 positive specimens.
To improve the recovery of GBS by the Reference Culture Method, a supplemental
study was conducted with frozen LIM Broth culture aliquots (in glycerol) from all
negative samples by the Reference Culture Method (n=615). Aliquots were
subcultured onto non-selective agar and again examined for the presence of GBS
colonies. GBS identification was confirmed by biochemical testing according to the
clinical reference method protocol. Any positive GBS samples identified by this
method were combined with the results of the first culture. No GenePOC GBS LB
Assay results were changed for the supplemental study. For six isolates in the
supplemental study, results were excluded due to inconclusive culture, the frozen
LIM Broth tube was not found, or the frozen LIM Broth tube was not stored with
glycerol; therefore, the original Reference Culture Method results for the six samples
were included in the analysis instead of excluding these samples from the final
analysis. With the addition of the secondary study, the Reference Culture Method was
considered to be a Composite Reference Method. A total of 14 additional reference
positive samples were identified by the supplemental study and added to previous
results for a total of 170 reference positive results [156 (original) + 14 (supplemental
study)].
The GenePOC GBS LB Assay was performed according to the package insert. A 15
µl aliquot of enriched LIM Broth culture was transferred to a sample buffer tube
(SBT), and a 150 µl was loaded into each PIE. The assay was run on the revogene
instrument. Residual SBT with sample was stored at 2-8°C for repeat testing, if
needed. One hundred thirty-seven (137) GenePOC GBS LB runs out of one hundred
thirty-nine (139) were valid (98.6% success rate). The overall initial unresolved and
indeterminate rates were 0.74% (6/812) and 1.48% (12/812), respectively. The final
non-reportable result rate was 0.25% for the GenePOC GBS LB Assay. Results of the
GenePOC GBS LB Assay were compared to a Composite Reference Culture Method
as shown in Table 12.
