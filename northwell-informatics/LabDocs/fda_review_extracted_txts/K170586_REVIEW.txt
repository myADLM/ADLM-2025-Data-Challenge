H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Strep B Carrot Broth™ One-Step is a selective and differential medium which is intended
for the detection of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) from anovaginal specimen collected
from pregnant women. The medium is used as an aid in the qualitative determination of
GBS colonization in pregnant women. The color change reaction from white to orange is
representative of a positive result for presence of GBS. The medium requires 24 hours of
incubation but positive results can be interpreted as early as 16 hours. Due to the
properties of Strep B Carrot Broth™ One-Step, non-hemolytic GBS cannot be detected
by the medium’s color change and require subculture for identification. Any presumptive
negative indicated by lack of color change at the end of the incubation period must be
subcultured to a non-selective medium (e.g. Tryptic Soy Agar with 5% Sheep Blood) to
confirm absence of GBS. Subculture must also be performed to recover isolates for
conducting susceptibility testing as recommended for penicillin-allergic women.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as the Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use only
Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step with no color change after 24 hours incubation is
considered presumptive negative for GBS and should be subcultured to non-selective
media followed by biochemical testing to rule-out presence of weakly β-hemolytic or
non-hemolytic GBS.
Storage of vaginal/rectal swabs in the specified specimen transport systems beyond 24
hours at room temperature before inoculating Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step is not
recommended.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step is a selective and differential medium used for the detection
of Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae, (GBS) colonization in pregnant women by testing
vaginal/rectal swabs. Color development (light orange, orange, or red-orange color) is a
2

--- Page 3 ---
unique characteristic of β-hemolytic GBS strains resulting from colored pigment production
in the presence of substrates such as starch, peptone, serum, and folate pathway inhibitors.
Non-hemolytic GBS cannot be detected by color production, but can be recovered from Strep
B Carrot Broth One-Step upon subculture to non-selective plates. Growth of microorganisms
belonging to other species is either inhibited, or if there is growth, the culture does not
produce the expected color reaction.

L. Test Principle:
Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step is a selective, differential medium for the detection of GBS.
The ability to detect GBS is based on the presence of selective agents that suppress the
growth of organisms other than GBS, and the presence of components necessary for pigment
production that allow the detection of GBS colonization based on color development.
Vaginal/rectal swabs from antepartum women are inoculated directly into Strep B Carrot
Broth One-Step and incubated aerobically at 35°-37°C for 16-24 hours. Positive results can
be reported as early as 16 hours. If negative at 16 hours, the broth cultures are re-incubated
until 24 hours. The cultures are examined after 24 hours incubation for the development of
light orange to orange to orange-red color. After the subculture of negatives to non-selective
media, biochemical testing is performed to rule-out the presence of GBS before calling the
sample negative.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated at three sites using a blinded panel of twelve well-
characterized strains, which included 10 hemolytic GBS strains, 1 non-hemolytic
GBS strain, and 1 non-GBS strain as the negative control. At each site, panel
members were tested in triplicate at 103 CFU/ml with Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step
each day for five days. Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step tubes were observed for
development of light orange to orange color at 24 hours. Testing was done with at
least one operator and two readers. All strains produced the expected results with the
Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step at 24 hours >95% of the time for each operator
(538/540). All non-hemolytic GBS were recovered upon subculture to Tryptic Soy
Agar with 5% sheep blood. Isolates were also plated onto Tryptic Soy Agar with 5%
sheep blood to ensure viability and purity of cultures.

Specimen Stability
Various types of specimen transport swabs were evaluated to determine the acceptable
storage conditions required to recover GBS from Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step. Swabs
were spiked with GBS and a contrived matrix consisting of organisms commonly found in
vaginal flora. Eight different GBS strains were used in this study and spiked into contrived
matrix near LoD. Organisms suspenstions in the different transport systems were kept at
both room temperature and 2-8°C for 0, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours before inoculation
into Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step. TransPRO swabs with Liquid Amies (flocked swab
liquid-based transport system) and four other types of transport systems (Sponge-based
Liquid Amies and Liquid Stuart’s, and Gel-based Amies Gel and Stuart’s Gel) were used in
this study. Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step was able to recover 8/8 (100%) of GBS strains
and produce orange coloration from swabs in Liquid Amies, Liquid Stuart’s, Amies Gel,
and Stuart’s Gel when stored at 2-8°C for up to 96 hours. 100% of GBS strains also
produced the expected orange color reaction from TransPRO Liquid Amies stored at 2-8°C
for up to 120 hours. Both color development and recovery of GBS were impacted by
specimen storage at room temperature beyond 24 hours. All transport systems tested saw a
decline in recovery of GBS after 24 hours storage at room temperature as shown in Table 3
below. A limitation in the package insert has been added regarding storage at room
temperature beyond 24 hours with the specified specimen transport swabs.

Recovery Study
A Recovery Study was performed with two GBS strains (ATCC 12386 and ATCC
12403). After preparing six serial dilutions per strain in natural negative matrix and
inoculating media, Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step tubes were incubated to determine
color development between 12-24 hours at 35°C. Tube color was recorded at 12 hours
and every 2 hours until 24 hours incubation had occurred. At 16 hours, the minimum
concentration of GBS detected for both strains with Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step was
103 CFU/ml. The LoD for the two GBS strains was confirmed by testing Strep B Carrot
Broth One-Step with 20 replicates of each strain at the determined LoD concentration
(103 CFU/ml).
Analytical Reactivity
A study was conducted to demonstrate the sensitivity of Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step
in detecting various GBS strains at a concentration of 103 CFU/ml. The study included 54
ATCC reference and clinical GBS strains representing six of the nine different serotypes
(48 hemolytic, 6 non-hemolytic). Tubes were read at 24 hours of incubation for an orange
color reaction, which was indicative of GBS. The inclusivity panel is shown in Table 4
below.

Incubation Study
An Incubation Study was conducted to determine the effect of various incubation
times on the performance of Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step when tested with ten
GBS strains (hemolytic and non-hemolytic) at 103 CFU/ml concentration. The
recovery of organisms and development of characteristic color with broth cultures
were evaluated every 2 hours from 12-24 hours. At the earliest time point (12 hours),
all hemolytic organisms produced some kind of orange color reaction (light orange to
orange). All GBS strains, including the non-hemolytic strain tested, were recovered
upon subculture of Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step. The earliest incubation time set
for positive detection of GBS by color was 16 hours.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-Reactivity Study
In order to evaluate the performance of Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step with
microorganisms potentially encountered in vaginal/rectal swabs, a Cross-Reactivity
Study was completed with 78 non-target organisms (gram negative bacteria, gram
positive bacteria, and yeast) at approximately108 CFU/ml. Results showed that all 78
organisms from the cross-reactivity panel produced a negative color reaction with
Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step. A total of 45 organisms (57.7%) were recoverable
when subcultured at the end of 24 hrs incubation. The cross-reactivity panel is shown
in Table 5 below.

Microbial Interference Study
A Microbial Interference Study was conducted to demonstrate that high levels of non-
target organism will not suppress color development and recover of GBS. All
organisms that were recovered upon subculture from Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step
in the Analytical Specificity Study were used in the Microbial Interference Study.
Additionally, L. acidophilus (ATCC 4356) and E. coli (ATCC 25922) were included
in this study. Non-target organisms at a concentration of 108 CFU/ml were mixed
with one hemolytic and one non-hemolytic GBS strain at the LoD. If the target
organism was not recovered, the concentration of the non-target organism was
lowered 10-fold until the target organism was recovered.
At 24 hrs, both GBS strains (S. agalactiae, ATCC 12386 and S. agalactiae, ATCC
13813) gave the expected results in the presence of 108 CFU/ml of all non-target
strains in the Microbial Interference Study, except in the presence of Enterococcus
faecalis (ATCC 29212). In the presence of E. faecalis, proper color development with
the β-hemolytic GBS strain (ATCC 12386) was observed at 105 CFU/ml or lower.
For the non-hemolytic GBS strain (ATCC 13813) tested, it was recovered upon
subculture when the concentration of E. faecalis was 106 CFU/ml or lower. The
potential for high concentrations of E. faecalis to inhibit the detection and recovery of
GBS is noted as a Limitation in the device labeling.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step was evaluated at four clinical sites. A total of 884
vaginal/rectal swabs from pregnant women were prospectively collected. Due to
protocol deviations (enrollment criteria not met), 108 specimens were excluded from
the study leaving 776 swab specimens to be inoculated and incubated in Strep B
Carrot Broth Kit. An additional 5 samples were excluded due to improper storage
(time of set-up) before enrichment. In total, 771 compliant specimens were included
in the final performance calculations.
A 30 µl aliquot of the clinical specimen in transport media was used to inoculate
Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step, and the culture was incubated at 35-37°C for 24
hours. The samples included in the evaluation of performance consisted of 771
specimens obtained in three different types of transport swabs/media—Liquid
Stuart’s Sponge (n=284), Liquid Amies Sponge (n=111), and Liquid Amies ESwab
(n=376). For the Reference Culture Method, vaginal/rectal specimens were tested by
inoculating LIM Broth with 30 µl of specimen from the transport swab system and
incubating for 24 hours at 35-37°C. Turbid LIM Broth cultures were subcultured to
Tryptic Soy Agar with 5% Sheep Blood, and all colonies with characteristic
appearance suggestive of GBS were screened to confirm the presence of GBS (both
hemolytic and non-hemolytic strains) using established laboratory methods: gram
stain, catalase, latex agglutination.
Color development after enrichment in Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step was observed
after 24 hours. The Strep B Carrot enriched broth culture (regardless of color
development) was also subcultured to Tryptic Soy Agar with 5% Sheep Blood using a
10 µl loop, and the agar plate was incubated for 24 hours at 35-37°C in a CO
2
enriched environment. All colony types were submitted for identification. Results of
Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step at 24 hours incubation were compared to the
Reference Culture Method. The color change from white to orange with Strep B
Carrot Broth One-Step was representative of a positive result for the presence of
GBS. Tables 7-9 below show the clinical performance data for Strep B Carrot Broth
One-Step vs the Reference Culture Method (all sites). Performance (sensitivity and
specificity) of Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step was calculated based on color
development and the recovery of GBS from the medium and compared to the
recovery of β-hemolytic GBS and total GBS strains by the Reference Culture
Method.
All isolates with discrepant results were frozen in CryoSavers with Brucella Broth
and returned to Hardy Diagnostics for testing. The identity of each isolate was
confirmed (β-hemolytic GBS, non-hemolytic GBS, or non-GBS isolate). Once the
identity was confirmed, positive organisms (β-hemolytic GBS or non-hemolytic
11

GBS) were tested at LoD (103 CFU/ml) in donated negative-vaginal rectal matrix for
their recovery from the LIM Culture Reference Method, color development in Strep
B Carrot Broth One-Step, and recovery from the Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step +
Subculture method.

1 There were 8 False Positives observed. All isolates were re-tested and confirmed at Hardy
Diagnostics using the discrepant analysis protocol described above. Of these, six isolates were
originally negative by LIM reference method, showed a positive color reaction in Strep B Carrot
Broth One-Step, and were confirmed to be β-hemolytic when subcultured on Blood Agar. One was
not able to be confirmed because no GBS isolate was frozen and the remaining specimen had β-
hemolytic colonies present on the blood agar plates; however, Proteus swarmed the plates,
preventing the technician from isolating the β-hemolytic colonies for identification.
2 There were 20 False Negatives observed. All isolates were re-tested and confirmed at Hardy
Diagnostics using the discrepant analysis protocol described above. Fourteen of the β Group B
Streptococci isolates recovered from LIM, but originally gave a negative Strep B Carrot Brot
One-Step color reaction, were confirmed as β Group B Streptococci and subsequently confirmed
to have a positive Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step color reaction at LoD. Two isolates were
identified as very weak β Group B Streptococci and did not produce the expected color reaction in
Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step. Four isolates were confirmed as non-hemolytic Group B
Streptococci with a negative color reaction in Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step.

1Considering that non-hemolytic GBS cannot be detected by the medium’s color change and
require subculture for identification, there were 5 specimens that were found to be non-hemolytic.
If these specimens are included as negatives, then the overall sensitivity and specificity values
observed when comparing the recovery of β-hemolytic GBS by the LIM Reference Method to the
Strep B Carrot Broth One-Step color development can also be evaluated.
b. Clinical specificity:
See above
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not Applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not Applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The overall prevalence of GBS (both hemolytic and non-hemolytic strains) by the
Reference Culture Method was 21.1% (163/771).
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
