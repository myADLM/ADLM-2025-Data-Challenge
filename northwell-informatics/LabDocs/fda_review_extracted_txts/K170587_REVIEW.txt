I. Device Description:
On Call Reagent Strips for Urinalysis and Healthy Me Ketone Reagent Strips for Urinalysis
are identical (and differ only by the tradename) and consist of a plastic strip to which a
reagent pad is affixed. The reagent pad reacts with the urine and provides a visible color
reaction.
On Call Reagent Strips for Urinalysis and Healthy Me Ketone Reagent Strips for Urinalysis
are packaged along with a drying agent in a canister bottle. Each strip is ready to use upon
removal from the canister. The entire reagent strip is disposable. Results are obtained by
direct comparison to the test strip with color blocks printed on the bottle label. No
calculations or laboratory instruments are needed.
The devices are over-the-counter versions of a previously cleared professional device for
urine ketones (k061559-ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips). The strips are identical, except
that the ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips contained test pads to evaluate 10 analytes
(including ketones), and the On Call Reagent Strips for Urinalysis and Healthy Me Ketone
Reagent Strips for Urinalysis strips each contain a single reagent pad (to evaluate ketones).

L. Test Principle:
The On Call Reagent Strips for Urinalysis and Healthy Me Ketone Reagent Strips for
Urinalysis are for the qualitative and semi-quantitative detection of ketones (acetoacetic acid)
in urine. The On Call Reagent Strips for Urinalysis and Healthy Me Ketone Reagent Strips
for Urinalysis are based on ketones reacting with nitroprusside and acetoacetic acid to
produce a color change ranging from beige for negative results to a dark purple color for
positive results. Ketones are normally not present in urine.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The ketones pad of the On Call Reagent Strips for Urinalysis and Healthy Me Ketone
Reagent Strips for Urinalysis are identical to the ketones pad in the ACON Urinalysis
Reagent Strips evaluated in k061559 (see device description).
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The ketones pad is identical to the ketones pad in the ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips
evaluated in k061559, therefore precision/reproducibility studies were not repeated.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The ketones pad is identical to the ketones pad in the ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips
evaluated in k061559, therefore linearity studies were not repeated.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor did not indicate any degree of traceability for their device.
The recommended storage temperature conditions and claims are unchanged and are the
same stability claims described in k061559.

d. Detection limit:
The ketones pad is identical to the ketones pad in the ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips
evaluated in k061559, therefore sensitivity studies were not repeated.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference study was performed according to CLSI guideline EP7-A2, “Interference
Testing in Clinical Chemistry” to determine the effect of potential interfering substances
commonly found in human urine on the strips. Pooled human urine was divided into
three samples; a negative sample with no ketones, a sample spiked with lithium
acetoacetate for a ketone concentration of 5 mg/dL, and a sample spiked with lithium
acetoacetate for a ketone concentration of 160 mg/dL.
Potential interfering substances and target concentrations evaluated are shown below.
Interferences were initially evaluated at concentrations listed; if interference was
observed, serial dilutions of the substance were tested until no interference was observed:

No interference was observed with potentially interfering substances at the concentrations
listed (i.e., all results were an exact color block match to control solutions lacking
interferents).
Blood at a concentration of 5% caused false positive results for the proposed device.
Since blood concentration ≥ 1% may cause false positive results for the proposed device,
the sponsor’s labeling states that blood in urine can lead to false positive results.
The sponsor additionally evaluated the performance of the proposed device under
different light sources (incandescent, fluorescent, sunlight, mercury vapor, and sodium
vapor) and determined that these sources provided adequate lighting for use since the test
results (of urine samples with ketone concentrations of 5, 15, 40, 80 and 160 mg/dL)
were not impacted by the different lighting conditions evaluated.
The effect of pH and specific gravity was also evaluated. Five normal fresh urine
samples were pooled and split into aliquots spiked to contain ketone concentrations of 0,
5, 15, 40, 80, and 160 mg/dL. To evaluate the effect on device performance, aliquots
with pH of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, as well as aliquots with specific gravities of 1.000, 1.005,
1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025, 1.030, 1.035, and 1.040 were prepared. Five replicate
measurements were taken of each sample concentration at each condition. For all
specific gravity and pH conditions evaluated, results were an exact color block match
with the spiked sample concentrations prior to pH or specific gravity adjustment. Neither

Normal urine will not have any ketones present. If your results are positive, you should
immediately consult your health care provider. A positive ketone level in urine is called
ketonuria. This can occur in the following instances:
When a person is on a very low carbohydrate diet
·
When diabetes mellitus is out of control.
·
As a result of fasting, dieting, starvation, eating disorders, high protein diets and
·
isopropanol ingestion.
Ketonuria may be noted in normal pregnancy.
·
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
Additionally, the sponsor performed a readability assessment which showed that the package
insert had a Flech-Kincaid Grade Level Score of 7.9. A survey of the voluneers who
participated in the lay user study indicated that over 90% of users described the overall
instructions as clear and easy to undersand, and no users described the instructions as
difficult to follow or understand.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
