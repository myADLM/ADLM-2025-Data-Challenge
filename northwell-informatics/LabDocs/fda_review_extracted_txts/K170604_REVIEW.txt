The detection and identification of specific viral and bacterial nucleic acids from
individuals exhibiting signs and/or symptoms of a respiratory infection aids in the
diagnosis of respiratory infection if used in conjunction with other clinical and
epidemiological information. The results of this test should not be used as the sole basis
for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions.
Negative results in the setting of a respiratory illness may be due to infection with
pathogens that are not detected by this test, or lower respiratory tract infection that may
not be detected by a nasopharyngeal swab specimen. Positive results do not rule out co-
infection with other organisms: the agent(s) detected by the FilmArray® RP2 may not be
the definite cause of disease. Additional laboratory testing (e.g. bacterial and viral
culture, immunofluorescence, and radiography) may be necessary when evaluating a
patient with possible respiratory tract infection.
Due to the genetic similarity between Human Rhinovirus and Enterovirus, the
FilmArray® RP2 cannot reliably differentiate them. A positive FilmArray® RP2
Rhinovirus/Enterovirus result should be followed up using an alternate method (e.g., cell
culture or sequence analysis) if differentiation is required.
Performance characteristics for Influenza A were established when Influenza A H1-2009
and A H3 were the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation. Performance of
detecting Influenza A may vary if other Influenza A strains are circulating or a novel
Influenza A virus emerges. If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based
on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health
authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions
for novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for

testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is
available to receive and culture specimens.
2. Indication for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
FilmArray 2.0 or FilmArray Torch systems
I. Device Description:
The FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2 (RP2) is designed to simultaneously identify 21 different
potential pathogens (see the Intended Use section) of respiratory tract infection from a single
NPS specimen in approximately 45 minutes. FilmArray RP2 is compatible with BioFire
Diagnostics’ (BioFire) PCR-based in vitro diagnostic FilmArray 2.0 and FilmArray Torch
systems for infectious disease testing. A specific software module (i.e., FilmArray RP2
pouch module) is used to perform FilmArray RP2 testing on these systems.
A test is initiated by loading Hydration Solution into one port of the FilmArray pouch and a
NPS sample (in transport media) mixed with the provided Sample Buffer into the other port
of the FilmArray RP2 pouch and placing it in a FilmArray instrument. The FilmArray pouch
contains all of the reagents required for specimen testing and analysis in a freeze-dried
format; the addition of Hydration Solution and Sample/Buffer Mix rehydrates the reagents.
After the pouch is prepared, the FilmArray Software guides the user though the steps of
placing the pouch into the instrument, scanning the pouch barcode, entering the sample
identification, and initiating the run.
The FilmArray instrument contains a coordinated system of inflatable bladders and seal
points, which act on the pouch to control the movement of liquid between the pouch blisters.
When a bladder is inflated over a reagent blister, it forces liquid from the blister into
connecting channels. Alternatively, when a seal is placed over a connecting channel it acts as
a valve to open or close a channel. In addition, electronically-controlled pneumatic pistons
are positioned over multiple plungers in order to deliver the rehydrated reagents into the
blisters at the appropriate times. Two Peltier devices control heating and cooling of the pouch
to drive the PCR reactions and the melt curve analysis.
Nucleic acid extraction occurs within the FilmArray pouch using mechanical and chemical
lysis followed by purification using standard magnetic bead technology. After extracting and
purifying nucleic acids from the unprocessed sample, the FilmArray performs a nested
multiplex PCR that is executed in two stages. During the first stage, the FilmArray performs
a single, large volume, highly multiplexed reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) reaction,
PCR1. The products from first stage PCR are then diluted and combined with a fresh, primer-
free master mix and a fluorescent double stranded DNA binding dye (LC Green® Plus,
BioFire Diagnostics, LLC). The solution is then distributed to each well of the array. Array
4

--- Page 5 ---
wells contain sets of primers designed specifically to amplify sequences internal to the PCR
products generated during the first stage PCR reaction. The second stage PCR, or nested
PCR, PCR2, is performed in singleplex fashion in each well of the array. At the conclusion
of the second stage PCR, the array is interrogated by melt curve analysis for the detection of
signature amplicons denoting the presence of specific targets. A digital camera placed in
front of the second stage PCR captures fluorescent images of the PCR reactions and software
interprets the data.
The FilmArray Software automatically interprets the results of each DNA melt curve analysis
and combines the data with the results of the internal pouch controls to provide a test result
for each organism on the panel.
Materials Provided with the FilmArray RP2 Kit:
Each kit contains sufficient reagents to test 6 samples (6-test kit; RFIT-ASY-0130) or 30
samples (30-test kit; RFIT-ASY-0129):
· Individually-packaged FilmArray RP2 pouches
· Single-use (1.0 mL) Sample Buffer ampoules
· Single-use pre-filled (1.5 mL) Hydration Injection Vials (blue)
· Single-use Sample Injection Vials (red)
· Individually-packaged Transfer Pipettes
Materials Needed but Not Provided with the FilmArray RP2 Kit:
· 10% bleach solution
FilmArray system including:
· FilmArray 2.0 or FilmArray Touch and accompanying software
· FilmArray Pouch Loading Station
Interpretation of Results
When PCR2 is complete, the FilmArray instrument performs a DNA melting analysis on the
PCR products and measures the fluorescence signal generated in each well. The FilmArray
Software then performs several analyses and assigns a final assay result. The steps in the
analyses are described below.
· Analysis of melt curves
The FilmArray Software evaluates the DNA melt curve for each well of the PCR2 array
to determine if a PCR product was present in that well. If the melt profile indicates the
presence of a PCR product, then the analysis software calculates the melting
temperature (Tm) of the curve and compares it against the expected Tm range for the
assay. If the software determines that the Tm falls inside the assay-specific Tm range,
the melt curve is called positive. If the software determines that the melt curve is not in
the appropriate Tm range, the melt curve is called negative.
· Analysis of replicates
Once melt curves have been identified, the software evaluates the three replicates for
each assay to determine the assay result. For an assay to be called positive, at least two
of the three associated melt curves must be called positive, and the Tm for at least two
of the three positive melt curves must be similar (i.e., within 1°C). Assays that do not
meet these criteria are called negative.

For the following organisms detected by the FilmArray RP2, the organism is reported as
“Detected” if a single corresponding assay is positive.
· Coronavirus 229E
· Coronavirus HKU1
· Coronavirus NL63
· Coronavirus OC43
· Human Metapneumovirus
· Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus
· Influenza B
· Parainfluenza Virus 1
· Parainfluenza Virus 2
· Parainfluenza Virus 3
· Parainfluenza Virus 4
· Respiratory Syncytial Virus
· Bordetella parapertussis (IS1001)
· Bordetella pertussis (ptxP)
· Chlamydia pneumoniae
· Mycoplasma pneumoniae
The test results for Adenovirus and Influenza A (including subtyping) depend on the
interpretation of results from more than one corresponding assay. Interpretation and actions
for these results are provided below.
· Adenovirus
The FilmArray RP2 pouch contains five different assays (Adeno2, Adeno3,
Adeno6, Adeno7.1, and Adeno8) for the detection of Adenovirus. The FilmArray
Software interprets each of these assays independently and the results are combined
as a final test result for the virus. If one or any combination of assays is positive, the
test report result will be Adenovirus “Detected”. If all assays are negative, the test
report result will be Adenovirus “Not Detected”.
· Influenza A and Subtyping
The assays in the FilmArray RP2 are designed to both detect Influenza A and to
differentiate commonly occurring hemagglutinin subtypes. To accomplish this, the
FilmArray RP2 uses two Influenza A assays, FluA-pan-1 and FluA-pan-2, and three
subtyping assays, FluA-H1-2, FluA-H1-2009, and FluA-H3, directed at the
respective hemagglutinin gene. Each of the individual assays is interpreted
independently and the test result reported for Influenza A is based on the combined
results of the five assays as outlined in Table 1.

The FilmArray RP2 can simultaneously detect multiple influenza viruses contained in multivalent vaccines.
b Repeated multiple positives should be further confirmed by other FDA cleared Influenza subtyping tests.
Influenza A (no subtype detected):
If both of the FluA-pan assays are positive, but none of the hemagglutinin subtyping assays
are positive, then the interpretation is Influenza A (no subtype detected). This result could
occur when the titer of the virus in the specimen is low and not detected by the subtyping
assays. This result could also indicate the presence of a novel Influenza A strain. In both
cases, the sample in question should be retested. If the retest provides a different result, test
the sample a third time to ensure the accuracy of the result. If the retest provides the same
result, then the function of the RP2 pouches should be verified by testing with appropriate
external control materials (known positive samples for Influenza A H1, Influenza A H3 and
Influenza A H1-2009), and a negative control should also be run to test for PCR-product
contamination. If the FilmArray RP2 accurately identifies the external and negative controls,
contact the appropriate public health authorities for confirmatory testing.

L. Test Principle:
The FilmArray instrument, software, and pouch work together to perform sample lysis and
purification, amplification, and detection of nucleic acid.
One of the primary functions of a FilmArray instrument is to drive the various steps in the
testing process by moving liquids to appropriate locations within the pouch. Liquids are
moved from the fitment to the blisters of the pouch by means of pneumatic actuators in the
11

--- Page 12 ---
instrument piston block which press on the syringe-like plunging devices in the pouch
fitment. There are 12 pistons that operate in a specified sequence to deliver reagents to the
appropriate blisters in the pouch when they are needed.
Within the pouch, liquids are moved by using bladders and hard seals to exert pressure on the
exterior of the pouch, such that the instrument is never in contact with the liquids contained
in the pouch. The bladders are inflatable elastomeric membranes used to ‘squish’ the pouch
blisters, thus forcing the liquid out of the compressed blister and along any connecting
channels. The hard-seals are piston driven actuators used to direct the flow of liquids from
the blisters by pinching shut the channels and blocking flow while pinched.
Thermal interactions between the pouch and instrument play a crucial role in the
amplification of target nucleic acids. Temperature control is driven by a pair of numerically
controlled Peltier devices; solid-state thermal control instruments fitted with calibrated
temperature sensors and protective circuitry. These Peltier devices heat and cool to perform
the first and second stage PCR reactions and carefully control the temperature across the
array during DNA melting. The instrument uses a blue LED to illuminate the second stage
PCR array and a digital camera to record fluorescence generated in the second stage PCR.
The optical system is designed to detect the fluorescence signal generated during DNA
melting.
The instrument communicates with the computer and the FilmArray software using Ethernet
cables. The software provides instructions to the instrument to control each of the steps
described above.
A detailed explanation of specific steps in the testing process is provided below:
2nd Stage PCR and Detection
1. Sample Lysis and Purification
Nucleic acid purification occurs in the first four blisters of the pouch using magnetic bead
technology.
a. Sample Lysis
Prior to loading the sample into the pouch, nucleases are inactivated by mixing the
sample with a denaturing buffer (FilmArray Sample Buffer). The sample/sample
buffer mixture is then loaded into the pouch via the injection port and pouch vacuum
pulls the liquid into the sample well of the pouch fitment.
During the addition of the sample/sample buffer mixture, the template for the RNA
Process Control is rehydrated and introduced into the reaction mixture. The RNA
Process Control targets an mRNA of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which is freeze-
dried into the sample well of each pouch. The S. pombe is processed in parallel with
the patient sample through each step of the test including nucleic acid extraction,
reverse transcription (RT), PCR1, PCR2, and DNA melting. A positive result for the
RNA Process Control indicates that all steps in the test are functioning properly.
The instrument activates a piston located above the fitment to move the sample/sample
buffer mixture from the fitment into the trapezoidal sample lysis blister and then heat-
12

--- Page 13 ---
seals the fitment to prevent sample loss. The sample lysis blister contains ceramic
beads. The instrument then activates the bead beater assembly which rotates a metal
bar that strikes the pouch for 60 seconds to lyse organisms in the sample by creating
high speed impacts between the sample and beads (bead beating). At the conclusion of
the bead beating process, cells and organisms are lysed and the cell contents, including
the nucleic acids, are released into the reaction mixture.
b. Nucleic Acid Isolation
The instrument inflates the appropriate bladder and moves the lysed sample into the
magnetic bead blister. Here, the liberated nucleic acids are captured by adsorption to
silica-magnetic beads.
The instrument then uses a retractable magnet positioned adjacent to the blister to hold
the beads against the inside of the blister while they are washed to remove proteins,
cell debris, and other potential PCR inhibitors. The instrument moves the wash buffer
from the fitment into the appropriate blisters by exerting pressure on pistons located
above the fitment.
After the washes are completed, an elution buffer is moved from the fitment to the
appropriate blister resulting in the nucleic acids being released from the beads. The
instrument then moves the purified nucleic acid solution to the 1st stage PCR blister
while the beads and other waste products are pushed back to the trapezoidal blister.
2. Reverse Transcription and 1st Stage Multiplex PCR
In the 1st stage PCR blister, liquid containing the purified nucleic acid rehydrates a
freeze-dried reagent pellet containing all of the outer primers. A PCR master mix,
containing all components needed for PCR and reverse transcription (RT), is moved from
the fitment to an adjoining blister. A Peltier device is in contact with these two blisters
and the instrument performs a “hot-start” PCR and RT by preheating the blisters
containing the purified sample and the PCR master mix. Once the appropriate
temperature is reached, the contents of the two blisters are mixed and the RT step and
thermo-cycling is initiated.
Since the FilmArray RP2 includes RNA viruses, an RT step is needed to convert the viral
RNA into cDNA that can be amplified by PCR. Both the RT and the first stage of the
nested PCR reaction are performed using the same outer primers and master mix.
3. Dilution, 2nd Stage PCR and DNA Melt Analysis
Following completion of the RT and 1st stage PCR steps, a second singleplex PCR is
carried out. To accomplish this, the instrument dilutes the products of the 1st stage PCR
with fresh PCR master mix containing a double stranded DNA binding dye (LC Green®
Plus, BioFire Diagnostics, LLC). This solution is distributed over the 2nd stage PCR
array, where it rehydrates the dried primers in each well. The individual wells in the array
contain primers for different assays (each assay is present in triplicate wells of the array)
that target specific nucleic acid sequences from each of the pathogens or control
templates. The primers in the PCR2 array are “nested” or internal to the specific PCR
13

--- Page 14 ---
products of the 1st stage multiplex reaction. A second Peltier device is responsible for
driving the PCR2 reaction and for controlling temperature during DNA melting. The
product of the 2nd stage PCR is visualized with the fluorescent LC Green® Plus dye. At
the conclusion of PCR2, the temperature of the array is gradually increased and the
fluorescence in each well is monitored and analyzed to generate a melt curve. The
instrument then transfers images and temperature measurements to the FilmArray
software for analysis.
The PCR2 array also contains a control assay, called the PCR2 Control, which is
comprised of a specific set of PCR2 assay primers along with the corresponding template
pre-spotted into three specific wells of the array. Failure of the PCR2 Control invalidates
the run and indicates a test failure that is specific to the PCR2 step of the testing process.
4. Data Analysis and Result Reporting
The temperature at which a specific PCR product melts (melting temperature or Tm) is
consistent and predictable. The FilmArray software automatically evaluates the results
from replicate wells of each assay for the detection of amplicons with a specific Tm,
which denotes the presence of specific bacterial or viral targets. The FilmArray software
uses the following steps to interpret the melt curve data generated from each FilmArray
RP2 assay:
a. Analysis of Melt Curves
First, the FilmArray RP2 Melt Detector performs a set of basic calculations on the
melt data to determine if a PCR reaction occurred in each well. If the melt profile
indicates that a PCR product is present, then the analysis software calculates one or
two Tm values, depending on the number of melt curves present in the data, and the
Tm values are compared against an expected melt range for the associated assay. If the
software determines that the melt is positive and the melt curve falls inside the assay’s
specific melt range, then the curve is called positive. If the software determines that
the melt is negative or that it is not in the appropriate range, then the curve is called
negative.
b. Analysis of Replicates
Next, the analysis software evaluates the replicates for each assay (target and control)
to determine if the assay is positive or negative. To be called positive, at least two of
the three wells associated with an assay must have a positive melt curve and the Tm
for the positive curves must be similar (i.e., within 1°C). Assays with replicates that do
not meet these criteria are called negative.
c. Analysis of Controls
Results for control assays are compared to their expected values and assigned a single
pass or fail result for each control. Pouch-specific rules define how control failures
affect interpretations. The default rule specifies that any control failure invalidates the
entire run. For the FilmArray RP2, failure of the RNA Process Control or the PCR2
Control is interpreted as a control failure and all target assays (regardless of the assay
result) are assigned a test result of invalid.
14

--- Page 15 ---
d. Interpretation of Assay Results
Once the results for the individual assays are determined, the software applies
interpretation rules to determine the final test results. For many organisms, the target is
determined to be present or absent if a single associated assay is positive or negative,
respectively. For these organisms, the final test result is either “Detected” (for positive
results), “Not Detected” (for negative results) or “Invalid” (when either control fails or
the run fails). The FilmArray RP2 also includes test results that rely on the results of
multiple assays. See the Interpretation of Results section for more information on
interpreting these test results.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Reproducibility Study :
A reproducibility study was conducted at three testing sites on a combination of
FilmArray 2.0 and FilmArray Torch systems. The study incorporated a range of
potential variation introduced by site (three testing sites), day (five different days),
operator (at least two per site), system, instrument or Torch module (at least three per
site/sample), and pouch lot (at least three).
A total of four contrived NPS samples containing known quantities of various RP2
analytes (Table 4 below) were prepared in simulated NPS in VTM sample matrix1.
The contrived samples contained various combinations of 12 different FilmArray RP2
analytes2, each at three different concentrations, Negative, Low Positive (1×LoD),
and Moderate Positive (3×LoD). Note that the negative data were acquired from
samples not spiked with a particular analyte (i.e., negative data for the analytes in
Sample#1 and #2 were obtained from Sample#3 and #4, and vice-versa).

Note: The simulated NPS in VTM sample matrix and the natural NPS in VTM sample matrix were demonstrated to be
equivalent with regard to FilmArray® RP test detectability of analytes in analytical studies in support of the original FDA-
clearance of the FilmArray® RP test. Refer to K103175, K110764, and K120267 for additional details of the analytical studies.

b For B. pertussis, the FilmArray RP2 amplifies a single-copy target and commercially available qPCR assays typically target
the multi-copy IS481 sequences, therefore RP2 testing was performed based on the CFU/mL and an equivalent Copies/mL
was not determined for this analyte.
Once prepared, each sample of the reproducibility study panel was tested with the
FilmArray RP2 to confirm that it contained the intended analytes at the intended
concentration and then divided into single-use aliquots (400 µL) and stored frozen (≤ -
70˚C) until the day of testing.
After being distributed to the sites, six replicates of each sample were tested on five
different days on various FilmArray Torch modules (Site A, Site C) or FilmArray 2.0
instruments (Site B, Site C). Sites A and C conducted testing with at least three Torch
modules per sample, while sites B and C utilized at least three different FilmArray 2.0
instruments per sample. Note that Site C tested a total of 12 replicates of each sample

per day, with six replicates tested on the Torch system and six replicates tested on the
FilmArray 2.0 system.
Daily testing was performed by at least two different operators per system and site, and
three different pouch lots were used on rotating days so that data from all variables
were distributed between reagent lots. For any required retest per the Instructions for
Use, another aliquot of the same sample was tested on the same day by the same
operator using the same system, instrument or Torch module, and pouch lot. Results of
the valid retest were used as the final test result for the sample aliquot.
In total, 120 data points per sample (over a total of 480 valid runs) were obtained, with
60 data points per sample per system (i.e., FilmArray 2.0 and FilmArray Torch
systems), 30 data points per sample per Site A and B, and 60 data points at Site C.
Over the course of the reproducibility study, a total of 15 different FilmArray 2.0
instruments and 19 different FilmArray Torch modules (four Torch bases) were used
by seven different operators at three different sites. Valid results were obtained from
480 out of the 489 runs that were initiated (480/489, 98.2%). The majority of invalid
runs (8/9) were associated with a Control failure, while one invalid run was due to an
instrument error (Table 5 below).

a Data from Site A were further reviewed by the unique site-specific variables including test day, Torch module, and operator. No
correlation could be found between the Not Detected results and any one or more of these variables. The Not Detected results at
Site A were found to be statistically non-significant (p>0.05 by Fisher’s exact test) and therefore do not appear to indicate a site-
or system-dependent variance in precision of the FilmArray RP2 Bordetella parapertussis (IS1001) results.
The reproducibility (standard deviation) of melting temperature (Tm) for the
amplification products generated by the FilmArray RP2 was also evaluated, with a Tm
standard deviation for each assay of ± 0.5°C3 or less observed within and between the
FilmArray 2.0 and FilmArray Torch systems (Table 7 below).
3
Note: The Tm window for an assay is determined based on a mathematical model of known sequences and empirical
data. An observed standard deviation in Tm of 0.5°C or less is believed to be adequately ensure that Tm variability
contributed by the system (rather than amplicon sequence) will not lead to inaccurate results.

PCR2 Control
The PCR2 Control assay detects a DNA target that is dried into wells of the array along
with the corresponding primers. A positive result indicates that PCR2 was successful.
Both control assays must be positive for the test run to pass. If the controls fail, the
sample should be retested using a new pouch.
The FilmArray Software automatically fails the run if the melting temperature (Tm) for
either the RNA Process Control or the PCR2 Control is outside of an acceptable range
(i.e., 80.3-84.3°C for the RNA Process Control and 73.8-77.8°C for the PCR2 Control).
If required by local, state, or accrediting organization quality control requirements,
users can monitor the system by trending Tm values for the control assays and
maintaining records according to standard laboratory quality control practices.
External Controls
External controls are not provided with the FilmArray RP2. However, five frozen (-
70°C) external control mixes (ECMs) (see Table 8 below) were prepared and provided
to the clinical study sites for testing during the prospective clinical trial and the clinical
study testing contrived specimens. FilmArray operators were required to complete a valid
ECM run (correct results obtained) on each day of clinical specimen testing (tested on a
rotating basis).

The sponsor is also recommending the following in the product package insert: “Good
laboratory practice recommends running external positive and negative controls
regularly. Transport media can be used as an external negative control. Previously
characterized positive samples or negative samples spiked with well characterized
organisms can be used as external positive controls. External controls should be used in
accordance with the appropriate accrediting organization requirements, as applicable.”
Specimen Stability
FilmArray RP2 testing requires approximately 0.3 mL of NPS in Viral Transport
Medium (VTM) specimen, collected according to a standard technique. Samples in
VTM should be tested as soon as possible, though they may be stored at room

temperature (15-25°C) for up to four hours, under refrigeration (2-8°C) for up to three
days, or frozen (≤-15 °C or ≤-70°C) for up to 30 days.
Detailed documentation concerning NPS in VTM sample storage and transport was
provided in the original FilmArray RP submissions (K103175, K110764, and
K120267). The results of the analytical study conducted for the original FilmArray RP
submissions supported the claim that NPS specimens in Viral Transport Medium
(VTM) can be stored for up to 4 hours at room temperature (18-30°C), 3 days in the
refrigerator (2-8°C) or 30 days in the freezer (< -15°C) without affecting the accuracy
of FilmArray RP test results. The specimen stability claims for the FilmArray RP2
remain unchanged.
Fresh vs. Frozen Study
Detailed documentation concerning fresh vs. frozen NPS in VTM specimens was
provided in the original FilmArray RP submissions (K103175, K110764, and
K120267). The results of the analytical study conducted for the original FilmArray RP
submissions demonstrated that preservation of samples (by freezing at ≤-70°C) does not
affect the accuracy of test results compared to freshly collected or freshly prepared
samples. Therefore, it is appropriate to utilize frozen archived prospective and
retrospective clinical samples in the evaluation of FilmArray RP2 to supplement the
prospective (fresh) clinical study data, and to use frozen simulated samples in analytical
studies for this submission.
Single-Spiked vs. Multi-Spiked Specimen Study
Detailed documentation concerning analytical study results used to determine whether
the presence of multiple organisms in a specimen would affect the system LoD was
provided in the original FilmArray RP submissions (K103175, K110764, and
K120267). The results of the analytical study demonstrated that the LoD for each target
analyte from testing single-spiked and multi-spiked specimens were comparable.
Therefore, it is appropriate to utilize the multi-spiked approach in conducting the
analytical studies and the clinical study testing contrived clinical specimens in support
of this submission.
Simulated vs. Natural NPS in VTM Specimen Study
Detailed documentation concerning analytical study results used to determine whether
the simulated NPS in VTM sample matrix and the natural NPS in VTM sample matrix
were equivalent with regard to FilmArray RP test analytical sensitivity was provided in
the original FilmArray RP submissions (K103175, K110764, and K120267). Result of
the analytical study demonstrated that the simulated NPS in VTM sample matrix and
the natural NPS in VTM sample matrix were equivalent with regard to FilmArray RP
test ability to detect target analytes. Therefore, it is appropriate to utilize the simulated
NPS in VTM sample matrix in conducting the analytical studies in support of this
submission.

Quantification of Nucleic Acids Derived from Viral and Bacterial Cultures
The majority of the FilmArray RP2 analytes require specific technique-dependent
methods for culturing and quantification. Consistency in the quantification method of
isolates and strains within and between species is important to mitigate inconsistencies
in molecular detection that may be caused by variability of quantification methods
based on infectivity or viability of microorganisms. Therefore, an analytical study was
conducted to determine the nucleic acids concentration (copies/mL) of bacterial and
virus stocks used in the analytical and clinical studies of the FilmArray RP2 using
commercially available quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay kits.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of detection (LoD) estimation and confirmation studies were carried out with
contrived samples in simulated NPS in VTM (Remel M4 transport medium) matrix
designed to resemble a natural clinical NPS in VTM specimen. An equivalence study
was performed previously which demonstrated that the simulated matrix was equivalent
to the natural clinical NPS matrix and did not impact FilmArray RP test performance.
Refer to the “Simulated vs. Natural NPS in VTM Specimen Study” section.
Representative isolates of respiratory viruses and bacteria were selected to make
contrived samples in order to obtain positive results for every assay on the panel. In
some cases, testing of more than one isolate/strain per analyte was performed to
assess LoD for clinically important species or variants, specifically when more than
one assay was needed to detect the expected diversity of an analyte (e.g. Adenovirus).
An estimated LoD concentration for each analyte was first determined by testing
contrived samples serially diluted ten-fold to span at least four concentrations
(10× to 0.01×) bracketing the anticipated LoD. Five replicates were tested at each
dilution, with additional dilutions tested, if needed, to reach a concentration at
which loss in detection could be observed. The estimated LoD concentration was
subsequently confirmed by testing 20 replicates on the FilmArray 2.0 and 20
replicates on the FilmArray Torch, for a total of 40 replicates at 1×LoD. An
additional 20 replicates per system were tested at a 10-fold lower concentration,
for a total of 40 replicates at 0.1×LoD. The required criteria for confirmation of
LoD was a detection rate of at least 95% at 1×LoD (≥19/20 per system) and a
detection rate of less than 95% below LoD (≤19/20 detected per system at
0.1×LoD).
A multi-spiked approach was employed in both the LoD estimation and the LoD
confirmation studies where samples spiked with up to five analytes at various
concentrations were tested in the LoD studies. An equivalence study was performed
previously which demonstrated that the multi-spiked samples were equivalent to the
single-spiked samples and employing the multi-spiking approach did not impact
FilmArray RP test performance. Refer to the “Single-Spiked vs. Multi-Spiked
26

--- Page 27 ---
Specimen Study” section.
LoD confirmation criteria were met for each analyte on both the FilmArray 2.0 and
FilmArray Torch systems at the same concentration. The confirmed LoD
concentrations are shown in Table 9 below with detected results at the 1× (shaded) and
0.1× concentrations presented separately for each system and also combined. The LoD
concentration for most analytes is reported in Copies/mL, as determined primarily by
commercially-available quantitative PCR and RT-PCR assays. Refer to the
“Quantification of Nucleic Acids Derived from Viral and Bacterial Cultures” section.
In addition, viable units for the specific cultures tested (50% tissue culture infectious
dose (TCID /mL) or colony forming unit (CFU/mL)) based on the values obtained
50
from the respective Certificate of Analysis (CoA) are also presented.

a A cultured isolate of Coronavirus HKU1 was not available for testing. LoD for Coronavirus HKU1 was therefore
determined by testing dilutions of a clinical NPS specimen known to contain the virus. The amount of viral RNA in the
specimen (in RNA copies/mL) was determined by real-time RT-PCR against a standard curve.
b IS1001 sequences can be present in more than one copy per cell, so the relationship between CFU/mL and copies/mL
may vary from strain to strain and culture to culture. LoD was determined based on the copy number of IS1001
measured by an independent quantitative real-time PCR assay and for this culture.
c The copy number of Mycoplasma pneumoniae was determined by a multicopy assay (16S rRNA) and may not
accurately reflect the number of copies detected by the single-copy FilmArray RP2 gene target.
e. Analytical Reactivity:
The analytical reactivity/inclusivity of the FilmArray RP2 for each reported analyte
was initially assessed by in silico analysis and subsequently by testing unique strains
or isolates. Isolate/strain selection emphasized variants of known human clinical

significance, including relevant species, serotypes, genotypes, isolates collected at
various times and from different locations, recently circulating or newly emerging
variants, or any strains of particular interest based on sequence alignments, as
available. For more genetically diverse analytes a larger collection of isolates were
selected in order to better demonstrate and characterize the analytical reactivity of the
assay(s) with the expected diversity of the analyte.
Each isolate/strain was prepared and tested as a contrived sample in Remel M4
Transport Medium at a concentration near the LoD (3×LoD) in triplicate, with
one replicate on each of three different reagent lots. The majority of isolates
were tested based on molecular quantification in units of copies/mL, though a
few were tested in viable units of TCID /mL or CFU/mL. Any isolate that
50
was not reliably detected in 3/3 or 4/5 replicates at the 3×LoD level, was
tested again at 10×LoD or a higher concentration, as needed, until detection
was observed or a limitation on assay analytical reactivity with that isolate was
identified.
Analytical reactivity wet testing results are summarized in Table 10 to Table
21 below.

Analytical reactivity was demonstrated with a wide variety of
isolates/strains, including over 25 Adenovirus isolates of different species
and serotypes, 25 different Human Rhinovirus or Enterovirus species and
serotypes, and several isolates of the major Influenza A subtypes that
typically infect humans. Due to the public health concerns related to
zoonotic transmission of influenza A viruses to humans (primarily swine
and avian lineages), several isolates of swine and avian influenza A viruses
were also tested at a concentration equal to 3× the lowest Influenza A LoD.
The expected outcomes of Influenza A H1, Influenza A Equivocal, and
Influenza A (no subtype detected) results were reported for influenza A
viruses of swine and avian origin, depending on the strain, RNA sequence,
and concentration tested. As expected, the majority of zoonotic and
recombinant viruses of non-H1, H1-2009, or H3 hemagglutinin subtypes
were reported as Influenza A (no subtype detected). However, one (avian
H2N3) virus was reported as Influenza A Equivocal at lower
concentrations of 3× and 10× LoD and Influenza A (no subtype detected)
at a higher concentration of 100× LoD. Another avian isolate (H10N7) was
reported as Influenza A Equivocal at all concentrations tested, up to 100×
LoD.
f. Analytical Specificity/Cross-reactivity Evaluation:
Analytical specificity (cross-reactivity) of the FilmArray RP2 was evaluated by
challenging the system with contrived samples containing a high concentration
of the potentially cross-reacting organism. On-panel organisms were tested to
assess the potential for intra-panel cross-reactivity (e.g., does the Coronavirus
OC43 assay cross-react with Coronavirus HKU1, etc.), while off-panel
organisms (those not intended to be detected by the panel) were tested to assess
the potential for non-specific amplification of respiratory flora or other
respiratory pathogens that may be present in an NPS specimen. Organisms for
off-panel testing were selected based on a combination of several factors
including 1) relatedness to specific species detected by the FilmArray RP2 (i.e.,
near-neighbors), 2) clinical relevance (cause respiratory symptoms) or likelihood
of being present in NPS specimens, and 3) genetic similarity to FilmArray RP2
assay primers, as determined by in silico analyses.
Each organism was tested in Remel M4 transport medium on three different lots
of FilmArray RP2 pouches and at the highest concentration possible based on
the stock concentration of the cultured isolate. The final concentrations of
analytes in the samples were typically ≥1.0E+06 CFU/ml for bacteria and fungi
and ≥1.0E+05 TCID /mL for viruses (calculated to be between ∼7.0E+01 –
50
4.0E+05 fold higher than the LoD of the FilmArray RP2 assays).

--- Page 37 ---
On-Panel Organisms Testing
A group of 22 on-panel analytes were tested at high concentration to assess
the potential for intra-panel cross-reactivity. The organisms tested are shown
in Table 22 below and results, including cross-reactivity observed or
predicted for three of the on-panel organisms are discussed below.

Influenza A H1-2009 at a concentration of 8.9E+06 CEID50/mL; indicating the potential for cross-reactivity with
the FluA H1-2009 assay at higher concentrations.
c Contains pertussis toxin pseudogene sequences that are predicted to be amplified by the ptxP assay and reported as
Bordetella pertussis (ptxP) Detected when present at very high concentrations (i.e., >1.2E+09 CFU/mL).
d Non-specific amplification by the HRV/EV assay, generating a Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus Detected result, was
observed when testing B. pertussis at high concentration (i.e., ≥4.5E+07 CFU/mL). Similar cross-reactivity is predicted
to be possible with B. parapertussis, but was not observed when tested up to 1.2E+09 CFU/mL.
Testing of two different clinical NPS specimens known to contain high
concentrations of Coronavirus HKU1 (i.e., up to 8.9E+08 Copies/mL or
>4.0E+05× LoD) did not generate inaccurate Coronavirus OC43 Detected
results. These data support the conclusion that the intra-panel cross-reactivity
observed between the Coronavirus OC43 assay contained in the FilmArray
RP and high concentrations of Coronavirus HKU1 (>1.0E+08 Copies/mL)
has been eliminated by the redesigned Coronavirus OC43 assay (CoV-OC43-
2) contained in the FilmArray RP2.
Based on sequence analysis and experience with the same assay in the
FilmArray RP, cross-reactivity was expected between the assay for the
detection of Bordetella pertussis (ptxP) and non-pertussis Bordetella strains
that carry a pertussis toxin pseudogene (e.g. B. parapertussis and the off-
panel species B. bronchiseptica) when present at concentrations >1.0E+06
CFU/mL. However, reaction conditions for the FilmArray RP2 were
determined to be less permissive for this non-specific interaction and the
predicted cross-reactivity was not observed when testing on-panel B.
parapertussis at a much higher concentration (i.e., ≥1.2E+09 CFU/mL).
(Note: also see B. bronchiseptica testing in off-panel testing section below).

Though not observed, the potential for cross-reactivity with B. parapertussis
will be described as possible, but in the FilmArray RP2, the true organism (B.
parapertussis) will also be identified and reported.
The FilmArray RP2 includes assays to distinguish classical human Influenza
A H1 and the pandemic H1-2009 variant derived from swine. However, due
to sequence similarity, some reactivity of the H1-2009 assay may be observed
with historical and/or novel H1N1 strains of swine origin. This was
demonstrated by testing a swine origin influenza A Hsw1N1 isolate from the
1970s (A/New Jersey/8/1976) which was detected and reported as Influenza
A H1 in one replicate and as Influenza A H1-2009 in two replicates when
tested at a high concentration of 8.9E+06 CEID /mL.
50
Finally, the FilmArray RP2 assay for detection of Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus
(HRV/EV) contains a primer pair that, despite several mismatches, is able to
amplify sequences of the oxidoreductase gene found in Bordetella pertussis as well
as selected published B. parapertussis and B. bronchiseptica sequences. The
predicted non-specific amplification was confirmed when testing B. pertussis at a
concentration of 4.5E+07 CFU/mL and higher. The cross-reactivity was not
observed when testing B. parapertussis (or the off-panel organism B.
bronchiseptica, see below) at a concentration of 1.2E+09 CFU/mL, but it may still
be possible. Bordetella infections are less common than the “common cold’ caused
by Rhinoviruses (and Enteroviruses). Therefore not only should this cross-
reactivity be rarely observed, but the presumably more significant Bordetella
pertussis infection should be appropriately identified for treatment, with possible
extra care for a concurrent Rhinovirus infection associated with the non-specific
result.
Off-Panel Organisms Testing
In silico analysis of assay specificity was supplemented with wet testing of 50
off-panel bacteria, viruses, and fungi at high concentrations (typically
≥1.0E+06 CFU/ml for bacteria and fungi and ≥1.0E+05 TCID /mL for
50
viruses). The organisms tested are shown in Table 23 below and results are
discussed below.

Heat-inactivated viral culture obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), EMC/2012, Heat-Inactivated, NR-50171.
The only non-specific interaction observed in testing of the off-panel
organisms was a Bordetella pertussis (ptxP) Detected result in one of three
replicates of B. bronchiseptica tested at a concentration of 1.2E+09
CFU/mL. This cross-reactivity has been observed at lower concentrations in
the FilmArray RP and was predicted based on the presence of pertussis toxin
pseudogene sequences in this species. Though not observed, Human
Rhinovirus/Enterovirus assay cross-reactivity with some sequences of B.
bronchiseptica is predicted by in silico analyses. In addition, certain strains
of B. bronchiseptica are known to carry the IS1001 insertion sequences that
are most common to B. parapertussis. In these cases, the FilmArray RP2
assay for detection of Bordetella parapertussis (IS1001) will amplify the
correct targeted sequence, but will misidentify the organism as Bordetella
parapertussis rather than B. bronchiseptica. As B. bronchiseptica is a very
rare human pathogen (more commonly associated with veterinary cases of
canine “kennel cough”), the probability of inaccurate Bordetella pertussis
(ptxP) results or inaccurate Bordetella parapertussis (IS1001) results due to
cross-reactivity with B. bronchiseptica is low.
Analytical Specificity Evaluation Conclusion
Analytical specificity testing has demonstrated that the majority of the
FilmArray RP2 assays are highly specific for the organisms they are designed
to detect. Cross-reactivity that was identified will occur almost exclusively at
high organism levels (i.e., >1.0E+07 units/mL) and most events are associated
with near-neighbor species that carry the same genes or highly similar
sequences as the targeted organism. Overall, the likelihood, risk, and impact of
the FilmArray RP2 non-specific interactions are predicted to be minor. All
identified FilmArray RP2 cross-reactivity cases are indicated in the product
Instructions for Use, as a precaution to minimize misinterpretation of results. A
summary is provided in Table 24 below.

the operator. The FilmArray system uses the results of the Melt Detector to determine
each test result. The Melt Detector is part of the FilmArray Analysis Software and
assigns a positive or negative result to each reaction on the array through analysis of
the melt data collected during the test. These positive and negative results are
combined in the FilmArray Analysis Software (using the replicate, assay and
interpretation rules) to report the presence or absence of each pathogen in the panel.
To determine the result for each well, the Melt Detector was developed to analyze the
melt data. The Melt Detector analyzes the melt data for each well independently, and
utilizes curve-specific characteristics (e.g., shape, signal-to-noise, etc.) to assign a
positive or negative call to each curve. To maximize the sensitivity and specificity of
the Melt Detector, the algorithm was tuned against a large data set comprising typical
and atypical melting curves (i.e., training data set) with expert annotation (positive or
negative calls) during the development of the original FilmArray RP.
To evaluate the Melt Detector performance for the FilmArray RP2, the observed
sensitivity and specificity rates for the individual melt curves and assay calls were
reported and analyzed. These sensitivity and specificity rates were determined by
comparing the FilmArray RP2 test results obtained from testing well-characterized
samples collected as part of the clinical evaluation and analytic testing of the
FilmArray RP2 panel, to expert annotation.
For individual melt curves, the observed sensitivity and specificity, as compared to
expert annotation, of the Melt Detector is 99.65% and 99.94%, respectively. For the
Analysis Software, the observed sensitivity and specificity of the assay calls, as
compared to expert annotation, are greater than 99.80% for sensitivity and 99.96%
specificity. These rates are comparable to the observed rates reported in the previous
melt detector validation studies.
h. Interfering Substances:
An analytical study was performed to assess the potential inhibitory effects of
exogenous and endogenous substances and competitive microorganisms that may be
commonly found in nasopharyngeal specimens (NPS). This study also assessed the
potential inhibitory effects of disinfecting/cleaning substances and specimen collection
materials.
For this study, potentially interfering substances were selected for evaluation based
upon whether the substance may normally be found in NPS specimens or may be
introduced into specimens during NPS collection or subsequent handling and testing.
This included endogenous substances that may be found in specimens at normal or
elevated levels, such as blood, mucus/mucin, human genomic DNA, and various
commensal or infectious microorganisms (both on-panel and off-panel). Exogenous
substances that may be present in specimens, such as medications, treatments, or
topical applications for soothing symptoms associated with respiratory infections were
also included. Lastly, substances such as disinfectants (e.g., bleach and ethanol) and
41

--- Page 42 ---
various swabs and transport media that could contact specimens during collection or
testing were evaluated as potential technique- specific interfering substances.
Each tested substance was added to a contrived sample at a concentration similar to or
greater than the level expected to be found in a clinical NPS specimen. The contrived
sample contained a mix of five different FilmArray RP2 analytes, each present at a
concentration near the limit of detection (LoD), i.e., 2-3xLoD. Contrived sample with
no substance added served as a positive control (no interference) on each day of
testing, and a potentially interfering substance in negative sample matrix served as a
negative or substance-only control. Samples containing test substances were evaluated
for effects of the substance on the internal pouch control assays as well as effects on
the ability of the FilmArray RP2 to provide accurate organism test results compared to
the positive control samples.
In total, 39 different endogenous and exogenous substances, potentially competing

Testing showed that none of the substances evaluated had an effect on the FilmArray
RP2 control assays and no interference with pouch function was identified. However, it
was demonstrated that exposure of samples to bleach prior to testing could damage the
organisms/nucleic acids in the sample and generate inaccurate FilmArray RP2 test
results (i.e., lack of analyte detection), depending on the concentration and/or length of
time the bleach was allowed to interact with the sample.

Interfering Substances Evaluation Conclusion
No interference was observed when testing samples containing potentially inhibitory
biological substances (e.g., blood etc.) or high levels of potentially competing
microorganisms. Similarly, detection near LoD was robust in samples prepared in a
variety of transport media types or when exposed to various swabs that may be used
for NPS collection. Saline, decongestants, ointments or other substances that could
be introduced into the sample also had no effect on the function of the FilmArray
RP2.
The only limitation is related to potential damage to the organisms in the sample
caused by bleach that could lead to false negative results. A warning describing the
potential for sample damage caused by bleach will be included in the product
Instructions for Use.
Note: Nasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist) were not evaluated in this study, but are
predicted to be reactive with the FilmArray RP2 Influenza A (including subtype) and
Influenza B assays. Therefore, contamination of specimens with vaccine or recent
administration of the vaccine prior to NPS specimen collection could lead to accurate
detection by the FilmArray RP2 of the viruses contained in the vaccine, but would not
represent infection by those agents.
i. Carry-Over Contamination:
A formal carry-over study in support of this regulatory submission for the FilmArray
RP2 was not performed, since carry-over studies with high positive samples followed
by negative samples have been performed for other FDA-cleared FilmArray Panels
(i.e., FilmArray RP, BCID, and GI) for both the FilmArray 2.0 and the FilmArray
Torch systems. No carry-over has been observed.
j. Comparator Assay for B. parapertussis Analytical Validation
In the prospective clinical study for the FilmArray RP2, the FilmArray RP2 results
were compared to the results from standard of care testing using the same FDA-cleared
multiplexed respiratory pathogens panel performed at the clinical sites for all the
FilmArray RP2 analytes except for Bordetella parapertussis.
Two well-validated PCR assays for Bordetella parapertussis (IS1001) followed by bi-
directional sequencing (designed to give at least 200 base pairs of sequence
information) were performed as the comparator method for Bordetella parapertussis
(IS1001). The two comparator PCR assays target the same gene as the FilmArray RP2
assay (i.e., the IS1001 genetic element), but the primers identify sequences that do not
overlap with the FilmArray RP2 assays. The two PCR comparator assays used in the
clinical studies were designed by BioFire as published assays could not be found that
provided adequate amplicon length or quality suitable for sequencing. Additionally, the
assays were nested in order to match the sensitivity of the FilmArray RP2 assay.
44

--- Page 45 ---
Validation testing demonstrated that the PCR followed by sequencing assays had
similar analytical reactivity performance to the FilmArray RP2 assay, and a LoD that
was within 5-fold of the FilmArray RP2 assay LoD (this was considered "equivalent
analytical sensitivity").

Prospective Clinical Study
The clinical performance of the FilmArray RP2 was established during a multi-center
study conducted at three geographically distinct U.S. study sites during portions of the
2015-2016 and 2016-2017 respiratory illness seasons. Each study location was
representative of the intended use setting (clinical laboratories) and testing was
performed by trained clinical laboratory personnel.
Residual NPS specimens in VTM meeting the following eligibility criteria were
prospectively collected and tested using the FilmArray RP2 during the clinical study:
Inclusion criteria:
· Specimen is residual NPS in VTM left over from standard of care (SOC) testing
under clinician order for respiratory pathogen analysis using the FilmArray RP,
an FDA-cleared multiplexed respiratory pathogens panel
· Specimen has been held at room temperature for less than or equal to four hours
or at 4°C for less than or equal to three days before enrollment (FilmArray RP2
testing or archiving of specimen aliquots at ≤-70°C must be completed within
this window)
· At least 1.5 mL of specimen is remaining after standard of care testing and
available for use in the study
Exclusion criteria:
· Specimen other than NPS in VTM (e.g., nasopharyngeal aspirate, anterior or
mid-turbinate swab, oropharyngeal swab, NPS collected in medium other than
VTM)
· Specimen was not tested with the comparator test as part of patient care
· Specimen cannot be tested within the defined storage parameters
45

--- Page 46 ---
· Insufficient specimen volume for testing
A waiver of the informed consent requirement was obtained from the Institutional
Review Boards (IRBs) at each study site for the use of residual NPS specimens. Each
residual specimen collected for the study was assigned a unique Study Code Number
(SCN). The SCN was used to de-identify the specimen aliquots used for FilmArray
RP2 testing and comparator PCR/sequencing testing, and to provide select clinical data
to the sponsor. The SCN was recorded in a key which linked each SCN to subject
identification information to allow collection of subject demographic information,
hospitalization status, and the comparator test result(s) provided for subject care.
Access to this key was limited to specific site personnel who de-identified study
specimens and who had no knowledge of the FilmArray RP2 results.
The following information was recorded on the Case Report Form (CRF) for each
subject from whom a specimen was enrolled:
· Age group and sex
· Date of specimen collection
· Subject hospitalization status (Outpatient, Emergency Department, or
Hospitalized)
· SOC comparator test result(s)
A total of 1635 residual NPS specimens in VTM were prospectively acquired initially
for the clinical study. Between January and March 2016, specimens were prospectively
collected from all comers meeting the study eligibility criteria and immediately frozen
(N=695 specimens) for later testing as prospective archived/frozen (Category II)
specimens. Between September and November 2016, specimens were prospectively
collected from all comers meeting the study eligibility criteria and tested fresh (N=940
specimens) as prospective fresh (Category I) specimens. Category II specimens were
distributed to sites beginning in September 2016. Study sites also began testing
Category I specimens at this time. At each site, Category II specimens were thawed and
tested according to the study procedures as time permitted over the remaining duration
of the clinical study.

Of the total of 1635 prospective NPS specimens in VTM that were initially acquired for
the clinical study, 23 were excluded from the final performance data analysis (see Table
27 below). The most common reason for specimen exclusion was one instance of a site
failing to run an ECM for a given day of testing (10 specimens excluded). The second
most common reason for specimen exclusion was the testing of specimens outside the
3-day refrigerated storage window (nine specimens). The third most common reason
for exclusion was that the specimen was found to not meet the inclusion criteria after
the specimen had been enrolled (three specimens).

The performance of the FilmArray RP2 was evaluated by comparing the FilmArray
RP2 test results with those from an FDA-cleared multiplexed respiratory pathogen
panel as well as with results from two analytically-validated PCR followed by bi-
directional sequencing assays for B. parapertussis (this analyte is not detected by the
FDA-cleared multiplexed respiratory pathogen panel). The B. parapertussis comparator
assays were designed to amplify a different sequence than that amplified by the
FilmArray RP2. Any specimen that had bi-directional sequencing data meeting pre-

defined quality acceptance criteria that matched organism-specific sequences deposited
in the NCBI GenBank database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) with acceptable E-values was
considered Positive. Any specimen that tested negative by both of the comparator
assays was considered Negative.
Prospective Clinical Study System Performance
The overall success rate for initial specimen tests in the prospective study was 99.3%
(1611/1623) (95% CI: 98.7% - 99.6%); 12 tests were unsuccessful (one due to an
incomplete test, one due to an instrument error, and ten due to control failures). Two
tests (2/1623; 0.1%) did not complete on the initial run, resulting in an instrument
success rate of 99.9% (1621/1623) (95% CI: 99.6% - 100%) for initial specimen tests.
Both specimens were retested and valid results were produced after a single retest. Ten
tests (10/1621; 0.6%) did not produce valid pouch controls, resulting in a pouch control
success rate of 99.4% (1611/1621) (95% CI: 98.9% - 99.7%) for completed runs in the
initial specimen tests. Nine of the 10 invalid specimens were retested and produced
valid control results after a single retest; one could not be retested due to insufficient
specimen volume.
Prospective Clinical Study Performance
Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) for each analyte was calculated as
100% x (TP / (TP + FN)). True positive (TP) indicates that both the FilmArray RP2 and
the comparator method had a positive result for this specific analyte, and false negative
(FN) indicates that the FilmArray RP2 result was negative while the comparator result
was positive. Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) was calculated as 100% x (TN / (TN
+ FP)). True negative (TN) indicates that both the FilmArray RP2 and the comparator
method had negative results, and a false positive (FP) indicates that the FilmArray RP2
result was positive but the comparator result was negative. The exact binomial two-
sided 95% confidence interval was calculated.
Samples for which false positive and/or false negative results (i.e., discrepant results)
were obtained when comparing the FilmArray RP2 results to the comparator method
results were further investigated. The discrepancy investigation was mainly conducted
by performing independent molecular tests with primers that are different from that of
the FilmArray RP2 and/or comparator method retesting.
The FilmArray RP2 prospective performance data in positive percent and negative
percent agreements against the comparator methods (all sites combined) are presented
by analyte in the following Table 29:

a Adenovirus was detected in 3/4 FN specimens using an independent molecular method. Adenovirus was detected in
38/48 FP specimens using an independent molecular method; an additional two FP specimens were indicated to have
been collected from subjects with an acute history of adenovirus infection.
b The single FN specimen was negative for CoV-229E when tested using an independent molecular method. All five FP
specimens were negative for CoV-229E when tested using an independent molecular method.
c CoV-HKU1 was detected in 3/12 FP specimens upon comparator method retest.
d CoV-NL63 was detected in 3/10 FP specimens during discrepancy investigation; two were detected using an
independent molecular method and one was detected upon comparator method retest.
e Of the eight FN specimens, six were TP for CoV-HKU1. They were confirmed to be due to a known cross-reactivity
with CoV-HKU1 by the comparator method. All six specimens were negative for CoV-OC43 when tested with two
independent PCR assays; the remaining two FN specimens were negative for CoV-OC43 when tested using an
independent molecular method. CoV-OC43 was detected in 2/5 FP specimens upon comparator method retest.
f Both FN specimens were negative for hMPV when tested using an independent molecular method. hMPV was detected
in 6/8 FP specimens during discrepancy investigation; one was detected using an independent molecular method and five
were detected upon comparator method retest.
g HRV/EV was detected in 5/11 FN specimens during discrepancy investigation; one was detected using an independent
molecular method and four were detected upon FilmArray RP2 retest. HRV/EV was detected in 33/77 FP specimens
during discrepancy investigation; four were detected using an independent molecular method and 29 were detected upon
comparator method retest.

Prospective Clinical Study Mixed Infection Analysis
FilmArray RP2 reported a total of 245 specimens with distinctive multiple organism
detections (15.2% of all specimens, 245/1612; and 24.0% of all positive specimens,
245/1020; Table 30). The majority of multiple detections (190/245; 77.6%) contained
two organisms, while 20.0% (49/245) contained three organisms, 1.6% (4/245)
contained four organisms, 0.4% (1/245) contained five organisms, and 0.4% (1/245)
contained six organisms. Out of the 245 specimens with multiple detections, 124
specimens (50.6%; 124/245) were concordant with the comparator methods. One
hundred twenty-one (121) specimens (49.4%; 121/245) contained one or more
organisms that had not been detected by the comparator methods (i.e., false positive
results).
The three organisms that were most prevalent in multiple detections were also the three
most prevalent organisms in the study as a whole (i.e. HRV/EV, RSV, and adenovirus).

a This table includes only distinct co-infections that were detected by the comparator method(s) but not by FilmArray
RP2; the remaining co-infections detected by the comparator method(s) are already represented in Table 32 above.
b Of the six FilmArray RP2 FN specimens, all were TP for CoV-HKU1. They were confirmed to be due to a known
cross-reactivity with CoV-HKU1 of the comparator method. All six specimens were negative for CoV-OC43 when
tested with two independent PCR assays.
Retrospective Clinical Study
Some of the analytes on the FilmArray RP2 were of low prevalence and were not
encountered in sufficiently large numbers during the prospective study to adequately
demonstrate system performance. To supplement the results of the prospective clinical
study, an evaluation of preselected archived retrospective specimens was performed at
BioFire Diagnostics. These specimens were archived NPS in VTM specimens that were
selected because they had previously tested positive for one of the following analytes at
the source laboratory: coronavirus 229E, influenza A H1, influenza A H3, influenza B,
parainfluenza virus 1, parainfluenza virus 4, Bordetella parapertussis, Bordetella
pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, parainfluenza virus 2, parainfluenza virus 3, and
Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
A total of 217 clinical specimens were initially received for testing in this retrospective
study (Table 34 below). In preparation for testing, a study code number (SCN) was
assigned to each specimen and a key was created in order to randomize them such that
operators were blinded to the expected test result.
Prior to testing with the FilmArray RP2, the composition/integrity of the pre-selected
specimens was confirmed with the same comparator methods employed in the
prospective clinical study (i.e., PCR followed by bi-directional sequencing assays for B.
parapertussis or an FDA-cleared multiplexed respiratory pathogen panel for all other
analytes). Specimens were divided into two different groups for testing based on the
method of confirmation testing performed: all specimens containing analytes on the
FDA-cleared multiplexed respiratory pathogens panel comparator method were tested
in Group 1 and specimens containing B. parapertussis were tested in Group 2. Negative
NPS specimens were included in each group. Table 33 below shows the number of
specimens for each analyte (and negatives) that were tested with the FilmArray RP2 in
this study.

One specimen contained two analytes of interest
The FDA-cleared multiplexed respiratory pathogen panel comparator method was
performed on 197 of the 217 achieved specimens (Group 1). One of the 197
specimens was excluded from performance analysis because of an invalid RP2 run
with insufficient volume to retest. Additionally, two of the 197 specimens were also
excluded from performance analysis because a valid FDA-cleared multiplexed
respiratory pathogen panel comparator method confirmation result was not obtained
and there was insufficient specimen volume for retesting: one comparator run was
incomplete and the other comparator run had a control failure. FilmArray RP2 results
for these specimens are shown below in Table 34. Valid comparator method and
FilmArray RP2 results were obtained for 194 of the 197 archived specimens (Group
1).

Testing of Contrived Clinical Specimens
Influenza A H1 is of such rarity that both prospective and retrospective testing efforts
were insufficient to demonstrate system performance. To supplement the prospective
and retrospective data, an evaluation of contrived specimens was performed at one of
the three clinical sites participated in the prospective evaluation. Contrived clinical
specimens were prepared using individual unique residual NPS specimens that had
previously tested negative by the FDA-cleared multiplexed respiratory pathogens panel

retrospective clinical evaluations) at the source laboratory.
Spiking was performed using multiple quantified isolates of Influenza A H1. At least 25
of the contrived positive specimens had analyte concentrations at 2 × the limit of
detection (LoD), while the remaining 25 contrived positive specimens were at
additional concentrations that spanned the clinically relevant range which was based on
FilmArray RP2 Cp observations of influenza A (A H1, A H-2009, and H3) from the
prospective and archived specimen studies. Contrived positive specimens were
prepared and randomized along with 50 un-spiked influenza A H1 negative specimens
such that the analyte status of each contrived specimen was unknown to the users
performing the testing. The results of the FilmArray RP2 testing are presented in 39
below.

with the Hydration Injection Vial and then adds Sample Buffer into the Sample Injection
Vial using the provided Sample Buffer ampoule. Using a transfer pipette provided in the
kit, the operator adds ~300 µl of specimen into the Sample Injection Vial, closes the
Sample Injection Vial, removes the Sample Injection Vial containing the sample mixture
from the Loading Station, inverts the vial at least three times to mix, and then inserts it
into the Loading Station port where the proper amount of specimen is pulled into the
FilmArray RP2 pouch by vacuum. The FilmArray RP2 pouch is then placed in the
FilmArray 2.0 instrument or the available module of a FilmArray Torch system for
testing.
5. Calibration:
Not applicable
6. Quality Control:
Two process controls are included in each FilmArray RP2 pouch:
RNA Process Control
The RNA Process Control assay targets an RNA transcript from the yeast
Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The yeast is present in the pouch in a freeze-dried form and
becomes rehydrated when sample is loaded. The control material is carried through all
stages of the test process, including lysis, nucleic acid purification, reverse transcription,
PCR1, dilution, PCR2, and DNA melting. A positive control result indicates that all steps
carried out in the FilmArray RP2 pouch were successful.
PCR2 Control
The PCR2 Control assay detects a DNA target that is dried into wells of the array along
with the corresponding primers. A positive result indicates that PCR2 was successful.
Both control assays must be positive for the test run to pass. If the controls fail, the
sample should be retested using a new pouch.
The FilmArray Software automatically fails the run if the melting temperature (Tm) for
either the RNA Process Control or the PCR2 Control is outside of an acceptable range
(i.e., 80.3-84.3°C for the RNA Process Control and 73.8-77.8°C for the PCR2 Control). If
required by local, state, or accrediting organization, users can monitor the system by
trending Tm values for the control assays and maintaining records according to standard
laboratory quality control practices.
External controls are not provided with the FilmArray RP2. However, the sponsor is
making the following recommendations in the product package insert regarding running
external controls:
“Good laboratory practice recommends running external positive and negative controls
regularly. Transport media can be used as an external negative control. Previously
65

--- Page 66 ---
characterized positive samples or negative samples spiked with well characterized
organisms can be used as external positive controls. External controls should be used in
accordance with the appropriate accrediting organization requirements, as applicable.”
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not applicable
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
