2. Indication(s) for use:
ACE Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Reagent is intended for the quantitative determination of
percent hemoglobin A1c in venous whole blood collected in K2-EDTA tubes using the
ACE Alera and ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry Systems. This test is intended for use in
clinical laboratories and physician office laboratories to monitor long term blood glucose
control in individuals with diabetes mellitus. For in vitro diagnostic use only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
For in vitro diagnostic use only.
This test is not intended for screening or diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.
This test is not intended for use in neonates.
This test is not useful in judging day-to-day glucose control and should not be used to
replace daily home testing of urine and blood glucose.
Diseases and other conditions that affect red blood cell survival (e.g., hemolytic anemia
or other hemolytic diseases, pregnancy, significant or chronic blood loss), will cause a
decrease in results for % Hemoglobin A1c and are not reliable.
Hemoglobinopathies may interfere with glycated hemoglobin analysis. The results from
both ACE Alera and ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry Systems show that there is no
significant interference for Hemoglobin D (≤ 36.3%) or Hemoglobin E (≤ 22.5%). High
Hemoglobin F (> 10.1%) will result in lower than expected HbA1c values. High
Hemoglobin C (> 14.0%) and high Hemoglobin S (> 17.1%) will result in higher than
expected HbA1c values.
4. Special instrument requirements:

L. Test Principle:
The ACE Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Reagent assay requires a pretreatment step of the whole
blood samples, which is done off-line. The red blood cells in the sample are lysed by the
Hemoglobin Denaturant and the hemoglobin chains are hydrolyzed. For determination of
HbA1c, a latex agglutination inhibition assay is used. HbA1c in the sample inhibits
agglutination of the polymer agglutinator and the antibody-coated microparticles in the
HbA1c Antibody Reagent. The increase in absorbance, monitored monochromatically at 692
nm, is inversely proportional to the HbA1c present in the sample. The HbA1c concentration
is calculated using delta data acquisition method, instead of the previously cleared quadratic
method, for the same ACE HbA1c Reagent on the ACE Alera and ACE Axcel Clinical
Chemistry Systems. All hemoglobin derivatives in the sample are converted to alkaline
hematin in order to determine total hemoglobin. The reaction produces a green colored
solution, which is measured bichromatically at 573 nm/692 nm. The intensity of color produced
is directly proportional to the total hemoglobin concentration in the sample. The
concentrations of both HbA1c and total hemoglobin are measured, the ratio is calculated and
the result reported as percent HbA1c.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated according to CLSI EP06-A. Specific dilutions of a high
sample were prepared to make a total of 11 samples with concentrations covering the
assay range (2.7, 3.7, 4.8, 5.8, 6.8, 7.8, 8.9, 9.9, 10.9, 11.9 and 13.0%). All samples
were analyzed in triplicates on one ACE Alera and one ACE Axcel Clinical
Chemistry Systems. The mean of these replicates was compared to the expected
values and the results of linear regressions are summarized below:
ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry System: y = 0.987x + 0.3, r2 = 0.995
ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry System: y = 0.954x + 0.3, r2 = 0.994
The study supports the sponsor’s claimed linearity range of 2.7 - 13.0% HbA1c on
both ACE Alera and ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry Systems.
Acceptable total hemoglobin/hematocrit ranges for the HbA1c measurement was
determined following CLSI EP06-A. Specific dilutions of a high hemoglobin sample
were prepared to make a total of 11 samples. All samples were analyzed in four
replicates on one ACE Alera and one ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry Systems. The
mean of these replicates was compared to the expected values and the results of linear
regressions are summarized below:
ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry System: y = 1.006x + 0.10, r2 = 0.998
ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry System: y = 0.997x + 0.20, r2 = 0.996
The study supports the sponsor’s claimed reportable range of 1.4 to 21.8 g/dL for
total hemoglobin on both ACE Alera and ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry Systems.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The ACE Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Reagent is certified by the National
Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). The NGSP certification expires
in one year. See NGSP website for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
d. Detection limit:
A Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) study was performed according to the CLSI EP17-A2
guideline. Five whole blood samples with low analyte concentrations were tested
over 5 days with 8 replicates per day using one lot of the ACE Hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c) Reagent on both ACE Alera and ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry Systems.
LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration at which %CV was < 20% and was
determined to be 2.5%.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous substances:
Interference studies were performed according to recommendations in the CLSI
EP07-A2 guideline. Various concentrations of potential endogenous interferents were
spiked into two levels of whole blood samples (4.9-5.5% HbA1c and 6.9-7.8%
HbA1c). All samples were tested in triplicate on both ACE Alera and ACE Axcel
Clinical Chemistry Systems. The sponsor defined non-significant interference as ≤
10% bias in recovery for spiked samples when compared to control samples. The
highest endogenous substance concentrations tested that demonstrated no interference
are shown below:
Highest Concentration tested at
Substance
which no interference was observed
Bilirubin 53 mg/dL
Triglycerides 1100 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid 6 mg/dL
Acetaldehyde 100 mg/dL
Sodium Fluoride 1200 mg/dL
Hemoglobin variant interference:
A hemoglobin variant study was performed using 15 K2-EDTA venous whole blood
samples (4.7 – 12.0% HbA1c) containing known levels of hemoglobin variants C, D,
E, F and S. Three to five samples per hemoglobin variant were tested in four
replicates on both ACE Alera and ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry Systems for
%HbA1c results. Percent recovery was calculated by comparing to the results
obtained on comparator methods free of interference with the respective hemoglobin
variant (Trinity Biotech Premier Hb9210, k112015, for HbC, HbD, HbS, Primus

Ultra 2 Boronate Affinity HPLC, k891235, for HbE and Tosoh G8, k071132 for
HbF). Non-significant interference was defined as recovery within 100 ± 10%.
The testing results indicate that there is no significant interference from Hemoglobin
D (≤ 36.3%) or Hemoglobin E (≤ 22.5%). Hemoglobin F (> 10.1%) will result in
lower than expected HbA1c results, while Hemoglobin C (> 14.0%) and Hemoglobin
S (> 17.1%) will result in higher than expected HbA1c results.
The labeling contains the following limitation statements for Hb variant interference:
“Hemoglobinopathies may interfere with glycated hemoglobin analysis. The results
from both ACE Alera and ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry Systems show that there is
no significant interference for Hemoglobin D (≤ 36.3%) or Hemoglobin E (≤ 22.5%).
High Hemoglobin F (> 10.1%) will result in lower than expected HbA1c values. High
Hemoglobin C (> 14.0%) and high Hemoglobin S (> 17.1%) will result in higher
than expected HbA1c values.”
Labile A1c interference:
Two HbA1c levels of whole blood samples were spiked with glucose to contain 360,
720, 1080 and 1440 mg/dL glucose and then incubated for four hours at 37°C to
facilitate the formation of labile A1c. The samples were tested in four replicates on
both ACE Alera and ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry Systems. The sponsor defined
non-significant interference as within 10% difference between samples containing
glucose and the control sample. The results support the sponsor’s claim that labile
A1c showed no significant interference at 1440 mg/dL glucose level.
Carbamylated hemoglobin interference:
Two HbA1c levels of whole blood samples were spiked with Sodium Cyanate to
contain 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 mg/dL of sodium cyanate. The samples were tested
in four replicates on both ACE Alera and ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry Systems.
The sponsor defined non-significant interference as within 10% difference between
samples containing Sodium Cyanate and the control sample. The results support the
sponsor’s claim that Carbamylated Hb showed no significant interference at 2000
mg/dL Sodium Cyanate level.
Acetylated hemoglobin interference:
Two HbA1c levels of whole blood samples were spiked with Acetylsalicylic Acid to
contain 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 mg/dL of Acetylsalicylic Acid. The samples were
tested in four replicates on both ACE Alera and ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry
Systems. The sponsor defined non-significant interference as within 10% difference
between samples containing Acetylsalicylic Acid and the control sample. The results
support the sponsor’s claim that acetylated hemoglobin showed no significant
interference at 2000 mg/dL Acetylsalicylic Acid level.
HbA0 and HbA1a+b interference:
Two HbA1c levels of whole blood samples were spiked with HbA1a+b to contain 25,
8

--- Page 9 ---
50, 75 and 100 mg/dL of HbA1a+b. The samples were tested in four replicates on
both ACE Alera and ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry Systems. The sponsor defined
non-significant interference as within 10% difference between samples containing
HbA1a+b and the control sample. The results support the sponsor’s claim that
HbA1a+b fraction showed no significant interference at 100 mg/dL.
Two HbA1c levels of whole blood samples were spiked with HbA0 to contain 575,
1150, 1725 and 2300 mg/dL of HbA0. The samples were tested in four replicates on
both ACE Alera and ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry Systems. The sponsor defined
non-significant interference as within 10% difference between samples containing
HbA0 and the control sample. The results support the sponsor’s claim that HbA0
fraction showed no significant interference at 1725 mg/dL.
