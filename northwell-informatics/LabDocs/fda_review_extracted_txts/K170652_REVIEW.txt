The ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle
immunoassay (CMIA) for the quantitative determination of procalcitonin (PCT) in
human serum and plasma (lithium heparin and K2EDTA) on the ARCHITECT
iSystem. Used in conjunction with other laboratory findings and clinical assessments,
the ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT assay is intended for use as an:
· Aid in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of intensive care
unit (ICU) admission for progression to severe sepsis and septic shock.
· Aid in assessing the cumulative 28-day risk of all-cause mortality for patients
diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock in the ICU or when obtained in the
emergency department or other medical wards prior to ICU admission, using a
change in PCT level over time.
· Aid in decision making on antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected or
confirmed lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) – defined as community-
acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute bronchitis, and acute exacerbation of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) – in an inpatient setting or an emergency
department.
· Aid in decision making on antibiotic discontinuation for patients with suspected or
confirmed sepsis.
The ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT Calibrators are for the calibration of the
ARCHITECT iSystem when used for the quantitative determination of procalcitonin
(PCT) in human serum and plasma (lithium heparin and K2EDTA). For in vitro
diagnostic use only.
The ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT Controls are for the estimation of test precision
and the detection of systematic analytical deviations of the ARCHITECT iSystem when
used for the quantitative determination of procalcitonin (PCT) in human serum and
plasma (lithium heparin and K2EDTA). For in vitro diagnostic use only.
2. Indications for Use:
Same as Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
Warnings and Precautions for Test Interpretation:
· The ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT assayis not indicated to be used as a stand-
alone diagnostic assay and should be used in conjunction with clinical signs and
symptoms of infection and other diagnostic evidence.
· Decisions regarding antibiotic therapy should NOT be based solely on PCT
concentrations.
· PCT results should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical status of the
patient and other laboratory results. Changes in PCT levels for the prediction of
mortality, and overall mortality, are strongly dependent on many factors, including
pre-existing patient risk factors and clinical course.
· The need to continue ICU care at Day 4 and other covariates (e.g., age and SOFA
score) are also significant predictors of 28-day cumulative mortality risk.
2

--- Page 3 ---
· Certainpatient characteristics, such as severity of renal failure or insufficiency, may
influence PCT values and should be considered as potentially confounding clinical
factors when interpreting PCT values.
· PCT levels may not be elevated in patients infected by certain atypical pathogens,
such as Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
· Low PCT levels do not always indicate absence of bacterial infection. Falsely
low PCT levels in the presence of bacterial infection may occur during the early
course of infections, in localized infections, and in subacute infectious endocarditis.
· Increased PCT levels may not always be related to systemic bacterial infection.
There are a few situations where PCT levels may be elevated by non-bacterial
causes. These include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Neonates at < 48 hours of life (physiological elevation),
- Severe illness such as polytrauma, burns, major surgery, and prolonged or
cardiogenic shock,
- Treatment with OKT3 (muromonab-CD3) antibodies and other drugs
stimulating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
- Patients with invasive fungal infections,
- Patients with acute attacks of Plasmodium falciparum malaria,
- Patients receiving peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis treatment,
- Patients with biliary pancreatitis, chemical pneumonitis, or heat stroke,
- Patients with small cell lung cancer, severe liver cirrhosis and acute or chronic
viral hepatitis, or medullary C-cell carcinoma of the thyroid.
· The safety and performance of PCT-guided therapy for individuals younger than
age 18 years, pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals or those on
immunomodulatory agents, was not formally analyzed in the supportive clinical
trials.
· ARCHITECT B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT results should not be used interchangeably with
other methods for PCT determinations for monitoring patients.
· If the PCT results are inconsistent with clinical evidence, additional testing is
recommended.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT, ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT Calibrators,
and ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT Controls were validated on the ARCHITECT

L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT is a two-step immunoassay to determine the
presence of procalcitonin (PCT) in human serum and plasma using chemiluminescent
microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology.
In the first step, paramagnetic microparticles coated with a monoclonal anti-PCT antibody
are combined with the patient’s sample. PCT present in the sample binds to the anti-PCT
antibodies coated onto the microparticles. After incubation and washing, acridinium-
labeled anti-PCT antibody conjugate is added in the second step. Following another
incubation and wash step, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction

mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured in terms of relative light
units (RLUs). A direct relationship exists between the amount of PCT in the sample and the
number of RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT iSystem optics. The concentration of PCT
is read relative to a standard curve established with calibrators of known PCT
concentrations.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT assay was evaluated
according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP5-A2 Evaluation
of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved
Guideline-Third Edition (October 2014).
Internal Precision (20 day):
A single site precision study was conducted using according to CLSI EP05-A3,
Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative Measurement Procedures. Three PCT level
controls (low, medium, and high) and three PCT plasma panels (1, 3, and 5) were
evaluated in duplicate with two runs per day over 20 testing days. Two reagent lots,
two calibrator lots, one control lot, and one panel lot were used for 320 replicates
(80 per sample-reagent-calibrator lot). Testing was performed using two
ARCHITECT i2000SR instruments and one instrument operator. Control
concentrations were selected to cover the measuring range of the assay (0.20, 2.0,
and 70.0ng/mL) and panel concentrations were selected to cover physiologically
low, medium, and high concentrations (0.06, 1.3, and 13ng/mL) found in plasma.
Data analyses were performed for each sample separately, by site and for all sites
combined.
Analysis of the internal precision study data for the ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S
PCT assay is shown in Table 1 and 2 below.

Verification of Precision and Estimation of Bias. The study used one reagent lot,
one calibrator lot, one control lot, and one ARCHITECT i2000SR instrument per
site over 5 days. For each sample, the sites tested five replicates per sample with
one run per day over the 5 days for a total of 25 replicates per sample per site.
Control concentrations were selected to cover the measuring range of the assay and
panel concentrations were selected to cover physiologically low, medium, and high
concentrations found in plasma. Specifically, the samples comprised three-level
PCT Controls (Low, Medium, and High) and three-level plasma panels (Panel 1, 3,
and 5).

b. Linearity/Assay Reportable Range:
The linearity studies were performed on the ARCHITECT i2000SR instrument
following guidance of CLSI Guideline EP06-A, Evaluation of the Linearity of
Quantitative Measurement Procedures. The linearity data was obtained in two
independent studies using the same protocol with the exception of the number of
replicates per sample. Specifically, Study 1 had three clinical sample sets with 11
dilutions per sample tested in replicates of ten per sample, and Study 2 had three
clinical sample sets with 11 dilutions per sample tested in replicates of eight. The

PCT concentration of each clinical sample pool was unknown prior to executing the
study. Each study utilized one unique lot each of reagents, calibrators, and controls.
Both studies were run on the ARCHITECT i2000SR instrument and testing was
conducted on different days for each study.
In study 1, three EDTA plasma sample sets were produced by pooling multiple
clinical samples to form the three “High” pools with PCT target values of
approximately 110 ng/mL (10 individual donors were pooled to form the 3 “High”
pools). For each clinical sample set, 10 sample levels in addition to the High sample
were created by diluting each High pool gravimetrically with Low Pool (Calibrator
Diluent) such that the 11 sample levels spanned from 0.01ng/mL to ~110ng/mL. All
testing for each study was performed in one run in one day.
In study 2, the EDTA plasma high clinical pools were produced by pooling multiple
clinical samples. For the clinical sample set, 10 sample levels in addition to the
High sample were created by diluting High pool 3 gravimetrically with Low Pool
(Calibrator Diluent) such that the 11 sample levels spanned from 0.01 ng/mL to
~110.00ng/mL. All testing was performed in one run in one day. Linearity
concentrations ranges demonstrated by the 4 sample sets are shown in Table 4
below.

Regression analysis using first, second, and third order models was conducted to
determine the linearity of the assay. Regression statistics (i.e., deviation from
linearity for non-linear pools) for Sample Sets 1 and 2 are presented in the table 5
below. All levels tested demonstrated a ≤10% deviation from linearity. For sample
sets 3 and 4, none of the slope coefficients for the second and 3rd order regressions
were significant at the p=0.05 level, and therefore, the sample set was statistically
linear.
The studies demonstrate the range of 0.01 to 106.80ng/mL meet the acceptance
criteria for linearity and support a direct measuring range of 0.02 to 100.00ng/mL.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrator:
The calibrators of PCT Assay are traceable to the ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT
Assay which were subsequently standardized to the predicate B.R.A.H.M.S PCT
sensitive KRYPTOR® assay.
The ARCHITECT method was standardized through correlation with the predicate
device (B.R.A.H.M.S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR®). This standardization was
implemented through a Reference Measurement System recognized as a Category 5
model by ISO 17511. Calibrators for the ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT Assay
were prepared according to ISO 17511:2003.

Six lots of reagents were evaluated to assess expiration dating for Intended Storage
at 2-8°C and a Transport Simulation stability (which included a sequence of stress
conditions in conjunction with Packaging Operations Exposure Limits). At the
indicated times, the PCT Assay kits were removed from storage and evaluated by
testing three clinical samples (~1.3, 5.7, and 13.0ng/mL PCT) and three controls at
low, medium and high PCT level (~0.2, 2.0, and 70ng/mL) were tested at each time
point, covering the measuring range of the assay. Tests were run on the
ARCHITECT i2000SR instrument. Results support a shelf life of 9 months for
Intended Storage in refrigerated conditions at 2-8°C and in addition, the Transport
stability data indicated the reagents can be shipped at ambient or refrigerated
conditions.
Reagent Stability: PCT Reagent (On-Board) Stability Study:
Two kit sizes (100-test kits and 500-test kits) each with one reagent lot, one
calibrator lot, and one control lot were evaluated for On-board Drift stability on the
ARCHITECT i2000SR instrument. The test reagent kit (on-board) was stored on
board the instrument throughout the study with the refrigeration mode on and with
the instrument in constant running mode. Low, medium, high, and very high PCT
concentrations were tested versus a reference condition over 31 days. Linear
regression analysis showed that none of the samples exhibited a significant drift (no
more than 10%) from baseline through 26 days. Studies demonstrated the reagents
for both 100-test and 500-test kits stored onboard the ARCHITECT i2000SR are
stable for 26 days.
Calibrator Stability:
Three unique calibrator lots were used to determine real time (Intended Use)
stability and In Use (IU)-Freeze/Thaw stability for ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S
PCT Calibrators. For each calibrator study, three clinical samples (~1.3, 5.7, and
13.0ng/mL PCT) and three controls at low, medium and high PCT level (~0.2, 2.0,
and 70ng/mL) were tested at each time point in replicates of 6 for the Intended Use
Study and replicates of 7 for the In Use (IU)-Freeze/Thaw Study. Control
concentrations were selected to cover the measuring range of the assay, and panel
concentrations were selected to cover physiologically medium and high
concentrations found in plasma. Studies demonstrated a shelf life of 9 months at the
Intended storage condition of frozen (-10°C or colder). In addition, studies show
that calibrators frozen at -10°C or colder were stable at 9 months after 3 freeze/thaw
cycles.
Control Stability:
Three unique control lots were used to determine real time intended use stability (at
2-8°C) and In Use/After Thaw stability (at -10°C) for ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S
PCT Controls. All 3 controls (low, medium, and high) were tested at each time
point and storage condition. Results demonstrated that were stable at the Intended
Storage for 9 months under frozen (-10°C or colder) conditions. In addition, the
data for the controls indicated In Use stability of 30 days post-thaw at 2-8°C for
Controls aged 6 months at the intended storage conditions (-10°C or colder).
Specimen Stability:

--- Page 14 ---
The Specimen Stability Study was carried out using fresh samples collected from
53 patients across the range of 0.02 to 62.28 ng/mL of PCT in four tube types from
subjects located in various hospital departments (e.g., Emergency Department,
Critical Care Unit, or In-Patient Unit) from two hospital sites in Switzerland. The
study used plasma and serum collected in four tube types (K2EDTA Plasma,
Serum, Lithium Heparin Plasma, and Serum Separator Tube).
All samples were tested in duplicate at one clinical laboratory using one lot each of
ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT reagents, calibrators, and controls on one
ARCHITECT i2000SR instrument. The following storage conditions were tested in
the study (all storage conditions were off the cells or clot unless otherwise noted)
and the results are as follows:
On Board Stability:
Plasma and serum specimens are stable when left on-board the instrument for up to
3 hours.
Room Temperature:
Specimens are stable at room temperature (15-30°C) for up to 24 hours for plasma
or serum harvested from all four tube types. Further, the study verifies specimen
stability at room temperature (15-30°C) for plasma left on the cells and for serum
left on the clot or separator for ≤ 8 hours on the clot, red blood cells, or separator
gel and ≤ 24 hours off the clot, red blood cells, or separator gel. (Off the clot is
defined as serum collected from blood that is allowed to coagulate naturally after
collection.)
Refrigerated:
Specimens are stable for up to 48 hours when stored refrigerated (2-8°C) for plasma
and serum harvested from all four tube types (off the clot, red blood cells, or
separator gel).
Freeze-Thaw Cycles:
The study verified specimen stability for up to 3 freeze/thaw cycles for plasma
harvested from an EDTA tube and for serum harvested from a no-additive serum
tube or from a serum separator tube. In addition, specimens are stable for 1
freeze/thaw cycle for plasma harvested from a lithium heparin plasma draw tube.
Frozen Short Term:
The study verifies short term frozen (-10°C or colder) specimen stability for up to
15 days for all four tube types (off the clot, red blood cells, or separator gel).
Frozen Long Term:
Sample stability studies that support 18-month stability at -70°C were performed.
e. Reference interval (Expected values/Reference Range)
To establish the reference interval of normal population for ARCHITECT
B.R.A.H.M.S PCT Assay, serum samples from 446 apparently healthy adults ≥ 18
years of age were tested using the ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT Assay on the
ARCHITECT i2000SR according to CLSI EP28-A3c, Defining, Establishing, and
14

--- Page 15 ---
Verifying Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory guideline (See Table 8
below.)
The Reference Range study was performed using the ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S
PCT Assay on normal n=446 K2EDTA plasma samples, n=445 lithium heparin
plasma samples, and n=445 serum samples. Each sample was evaluated as a
single replicate with one of three reagent lots, one lot of controls, and one lot of
calibrators. Three ARCHITECT i2000SR instruments were used, with a different
reagent lot on each instrument. Reference limits at the 2.5th and 97.5th
percentiles were determined to be 0.006 and 0.065ng/mL, respectively, for
normal healthy donor K2EDTA plasma collected from n=446 males and females.
Each of the other tube types produced reference limits that were not statistically
different from those of the K2EDTA base tube, as determined by the overlapping
95% confidence intervals around the reference limits. The reference interval
range of the normal population using the ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT Assay is
from 0.006ng/mL and 0.065ng/mL.

f. Detection Limits
Limit of Blank:
The Limit of Blank (LOB) was determined according to CLSI Guideline
EP17-A2, Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement
Procedures.
Four blank (PCT-free) plasma lots were run in replicates of six on each of the two
i2000SR instruments and two reagent lots per instrument with one run per day for
three days. Three reagent lots and two calibrator lots, across two i2000SR
instruments, with for a total of 288 replicates in total (n=72 replicates per reagent
lot-calibrator lot-instrument combination). Reagent Lots 1 and 3 were run on
separate instruments and Reagent Lot 2 was run on both instruments. Results are
summarizd in Table 9 below.The ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT assay LOB of
0.0004ng/mL was the maximum value obtained between three reagent lots.

Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures.
One blank plasma lot spiked to four levels: 4, 5, 6, and 7 times the estimated LoB
concentration (~0.004, 0.005, 0.006, and 0.007 ng/mL, respectively) were run in
replicate replicates of five with one run per day for five days on each of the two
i2000SR instruments with three reagent lots (2 reagent lots per instrument) and two
calibrator lots. Reagent Lots 1 and 3 were run on separate instruments and Reagent
Lot 2 was run on both instruments. Four hundred replicates were tested (n=100
replicates per reagent lot-calibrator lot-instrument combination). The LOD was
calculated as the LOB + (1.653 * Pooled SD of five samples) for each instrument-
reagent lot-calibrator lot combination separately by a parametric method
with/without outliers (ESD) removed. (See Table 10 below.) The maximum
observed LoD between the 3 lots (0.0018ng/mL) was designated as the LoD.

*For each sample level on each instrument/reagent lot/calibrator lot combination, the data were
visually inspected and the generalized extreme Studentized deviate (ESD) test was performed to
identify possible outliers.
Limit of Quantitation:
The Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) for the ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT assay
was determined according to CLSI Guideline EP17-A2, Evaluation of Detection
Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures.
Two blank plasma lots, and each lot was spiked to five levels spanning a
concentration range of 0.0016ng/mL to 0.0500ng/mL (estimated to include a
concentration with 20% CV).The ten spiked panels were run in replicates of five
with one run per day for five days using three reagent lots, two calibrator lots,
across the two i2000SR with Reagent Lots 1 and 3 run on separate instruments and
Reagent Lot 2 was run on both instruments. One thousand replicates were tested
(n=250 replicates per reagent lot per instrument).
Using the calculated CV’s from the five concentrations, a curve was fit to estimate
the point where the upper 95% confidence level has a CV of less than 20%. Per
CLSI guideline, ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT assay LOQ was obtained as the
maximal value among the three reagent lots: 0.0077ng/mL.

A modeling analysis was conducted to evaluate the LOQ and each medical decision
point. The Total Error % was calculated as 1.65*(CV %) + (Bias %). The results
from each of three regressions (Bias, CV, and TE %) are summarized in table 12
below, and were based on fitting the Bias, CV, and TE % from 48 data points
ranging from 0.006 to 2.0ng/mL generated from the LOQ and Precision studies.

g. Analytical Specificity/Cross-Reactivity:
Cross-reactivity:
The cross reactivity study followed the guidance of CLSI Guideline EP7-A2,
Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry. The cross reactivity study was
performed with one ARCHITECT i2000SR instrument and one reagent lot. Four
potential cross-reactants were evaluated in PCT-free plasma and 2 medically
relevant levels of PCT (0.5 and 2.0ng/mL). For each PCT level, two samples, a Test
Sample, and a Reference Sample were tested in replicates of seven in a single run.
The Test Sample contains the potential cross-reactant and the Reference Sample
does not include the potential cross-reactant. The difference in PCT concentrations
and the percentage difference were compared to the acceptance criteria to determine
if the bias remains within acceptable limits. The following compounds were tested
at the associated concentrations: Human Katacalcin 10 ng/mL, Human Calcitonin 2
ng/mL Human a-CGRP 10μg/mL, and human b-CGRP 10 μg/mL.

Interference was determined based on the recovery of PCT from plasma panels
spiked with the potential interferent relative to the Reference sample. The
difference or percent difference with each interferent was compared to Cross
Reactant Acceptance Criteria.
Studies indicate that 10ng/mL Human Katacalcin, 2 ng/mL Human Calcitonin, 1
μg/mL Human a-CGRP, and 10μg/mL Human β-CGRP in plasma do not affect the
ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT assay.
Endogenous Interferences:
Three plasma-based panels were used for endogenous interference testing whose
PCT concentrations were selected to cover physiologically low, medium and high
concentrations (i.e., ~0.1 ng/mL, 0.35 ng/mL, and ~13 ng/mL) found in plasma.
Testing was conducted using one ARCHITECT i2000SR instrument, and one lot
each of reagents, calibrators, and controls following CLSI Guideline EP7-A2,
Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry.
For each potential interferent, a “reference sample” with abnormal endogenous
level of potential interferent and a “test sample” with the elevated level of potential
interferent indicated were tested in replicates of eight across three ARCHITECT
runs. The difference in concentration values between the test sample with an
elevated level of potential interferent and a reference sample with a normal
endogenous level potential interferent was evaluated to determine the amount of
interference, if any.
The following endogenous substances were tested and showed no significant
interference ≤ 10% or ≤ 0.05ng/mL up to the concentrations; results are
summarized in table 14 below.

Exogenous Interference:
Three exogenous studies using one lot of reagent, one lot of calibrators, one lot of
controls, and one ARCHITECT i2000 instrument were used to identify
SR
interference of human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA), rheumatoid factor (RF) and
drug interference on the ARCHITECT assay.
Three plasma panels (PCT-free plasma, Panel 3, and Panel 5) were spiked with a
low, medium and high amount of purified recombinant human PCT and tested with
multiple levels of HAMA (3200-8000ng/mL), multiple levels of RF (500-
2,000IU/mL) and tested on the ARCHITECT i2000SR instrument. PCT spike levels
included ~1.3ng/mL, 13ng/mL and critical decision points (0.5ng/mL and
2.0ng/mL). In addition, potential therapeutic drugs at concentrations and
interferents were tested; see table 15 and 16 below.

Interference was determined based on the recovery of PCT from plasma panels
spiked with the potential interferent. The difference or percent difference with each
potential interferent was compared to the acceptance criteria for exogenous
interferences; both positive and negative sample pools’ mean absolute difference
must be ≤10% or ≤0.05ng/ml, whichever was greater.

h. High-Dose Hook Effect:
To test for High Dose “Hook Effect” associated with immunoassays, EDTA plasma
pools were prepared within 10% of CAL F at approximately 90, 95, and 99ng/mL
and at extremely high concentrations far above CAL F at 500, 1,000, 5,000, and
10,000ng/mL were tested in one run with 18 replicates per sample using one lot of
reagent and one lot of calibrators on one ARCHITECT i2000SR instrument. The
study demonstrates that assay is free of hook effects up to 10,000 ng/mL of PCT.
i. Assay Cut-off:
28-day mortality:
· ΔPCT ≤ 80%
A decrease in the PCT levels below or equal to 80% defines a positive
ΔPCT test result representing a higher risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of
patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock.
· ΔPCT > 80%
A decrease in the PCT levels of more than 80% defines a negative ΔPCT
test result representing a lower risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of
patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock.
NOTE: The combination of the first PCT level (≤ 2.0 ng/mL or > 2.0 ng/mL) at
initial diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock with the patient’s clinical course
and the change in PCT level over time until Day 4 provides important additional
information about the mortality risk.

Recommendations for Laboratory Reports for Initiation and Discontinuation:
The Change in Procalcitonin Calculator is available at www.BRAHMS-PCT-
Calculator.com. The Change in Procalcitonin Calculator can be used to determine
ΔPCT results. It is suggested to report the numerical PCT values (individual or
paired). For paired PCT values the report should also indicate if the ΔPCT(%) was
≤ 80% or > 80%. The laboratory report should include a reference or a link to the
package insert for a guided interpretation of the test results.
j. Sample Auto-Dilution Study:
A sample auto-dilution study was performed to evaluate the degree of bias
introduced when the system auto-dilution function is used on samples within the
measuring range of the assay (>20.50 to ≤100.00ng/mL) or above the measuring
range (>100.00ng/mL - 1000.00ng/mL).
Specimens with a PCT value exceeding 100 ng/mL are flagged with a code (> 100
ng/mL or > 100μg/L) and may be run using the Auto Dilution Protocol. In the auto-
dilution option only one dilution scheme is programmed, the system performs a
1:10 dilution before analysis and reports the result after accounting for the dilution.
21

--- Page 22 ---
The ARCHITECT i2000SR instrument has an auto-detection limit of
1000.00ng/mL.
In this study, auto-dilution testing was conducted using one lot of reagents, one lot
of calibrators, one lot of controls, plasma panels spiked with (≥0.5ng/mL)
recombinant PCT, and one ARCHITECT i2000SR instrument. Panels were
evaluated using the 1:10 auto-dilution protocol, neat without dilution, and by
manual dilution. Five specimens between Cal E and Cal F (>20.50 to
≤100.00ng/mL) were evaluated by three methods (neat, manual dilution, and auto-
dilution) in replicates of five for a total of 75 test points. In addition, five specimens
between Cal F and the auto-dilution limit of 1000.00ng/mL were evaluated by
manual dilution and auto-dilution in replicates of five for a total of 50 test points.
The study demonstrates that the 1:10 auto-dilution protocol meets the 10% bias
limit acceptance criteria up to 1026ng/mL (20.5-1026ng/mL).
k. Carry Over Study:
A sample carryover study was performed using one lot each of reagent, calibrators
and controls, over five runs conducted on one ARCHITECT i2000SR instrument.
Each run consisted of testing a pattern of high (592ng/mL PCT) and low (no PCT)
analytes for a total of 90 replicates. The data showed that samples with PCT
≥500ng/mL will not carry over to a low-level analyte specimen enough to increase
the sample result above of 0.03ng/mL.
l. Matrix Comparison Study
To evaluate anticoagulant effects, matched specimen sets from 4 tube types
(K EDTA Plasma, Serum, Lithium Heparin Plasma, Serum Separator Tube) were
2
prospectively collected from donors located in various departments (e.g.,
Emergency Department, Critical Care Unit, or In-Patient Unit) at two hospitals sites
in Switzerland. Each patient, sample was tested in duplicate per sample matrix and
compared to the K2EDTA base tube. Regression analysis demonstrated no
significant matrix effect between K2EDTA Plasma, Serum, Lithium Heparin
Plasma, Serum Separator tubes meeting the acceptance criteria of ≤ 10% as
compared to K2EDTA plasma tube.
2. Comparison studies
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison study was performed according to the guidance of CLSI
Guideline EP09-A3, Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation
Using Patient Samples. The ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT assay was evaluated
by testing individual serum samples from the intended target population (Intensive
Care Unit, ICU) with comparison to the predicate (B.R.A.H.M.S PCT sensitive
KRYPTOR® assay). A total of 142 patient samples (130 native and 12 contrived)
representing high, low and disease state specimen from the intended use population
were tested by the ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT assay and predicate PCT assay
the study. Samples in excess of 50ng/mL were run without dilution on the
ARCHITECT and by auto-dilution on the predicate. Regression analysis comparing
the ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT assay results to the predicate assay results

3. Clinical studies
a. Clinical sensitivity: Clinical Concordance between ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT
and B.R.A.H.M.S PCT sensitive Kryptor®
The ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT clinical performance study was conducted
with banked specimens (as available) that were collected from subjects(>18 years of
age) diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock, admitted to the ICU and included
as part of the intention-to-diagnose population from the BRAHMS MOSES study
(DEN150009).
To demonstrate clinical agreement of the ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT with the
B.R.A.H.M.S PCT sensitive Kryptor® predicate device, all PCT values obtained in
the ARCHITECT B.R.A.H.M.S PCT clinical performance study were compared for
concordance at the PCT cutoffs 0.1μg/L, 0.25μg/L, 0.5μg/L and 2.0μg/L. The
analysis showed a total percent agreement of more than 96% at each of the four
medical decision points. Additionally, Weighted Deming and Passing Bablok

3. Specimen Identification:
Sample IDs can be entered manually or by barcode reader.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Preparation for Analysis
· Follow the tube manufacturer’s processing instructions for collection tubes.
Gravity separation is not sufficient for specimen preparation.
· For serum specimens, ensure that complete clot formation has taken place prior to
centrifugation. Some specimens, especially those from patients receiving
anticoagulant or thrombolytic therapy, may exhibit increased clotting times. If the
specimen is centrifuged before complete clot formation, the presence of fibrin may
cause erroneous results. The use of plasma is recommended for rapid
turnaround of results.
- To ensure consistency in results, recentrifuge specimens before testing if they
contain fibrin, red blood cells, or other particulate matter or they were frozen
and thawed.
5. Quality Control:
See “Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (controls, calibrators, or methods)”
