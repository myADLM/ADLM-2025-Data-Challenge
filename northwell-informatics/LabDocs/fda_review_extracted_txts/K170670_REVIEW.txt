K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: “Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”;
CLSI M07-A10 “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for
Bacteria That Grow Aerobically”; Approved Standard, January 2015
CLSI M100-S25 “Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing”;
Twenty-five Informational Supplement, Volume 35 No. 3, Jan 2015
L. Test Principle:
The Etest gradient technology is based on a combination of the concepts of dilution
and diffusion test methods for susceptibility testing. Etest directly quantifies
antimicrobial susceptibility in terms of discrete MIC values. When the Etest strip is
applied to an inoculated agar plate, the antibiotic is immediately released from the
plastic surface into the agar. A predefined, continuous gradient of antibiotic
concentrations is created and maintained directly underneath the strip. After
incubation whereby bacterial growth becomes visible, a symmetrical inhibition ellipse
centered along the strip will be seen. The MIC value in µg/mL is read where the
ellipse edge intersects the strip. Since Etest generates MIC values which fall between
two-fold dilutions for interpretation, the MIC value read must be recorded to the next
two-fold dilution.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three external sites using 25
organisms of gram negative bacilli that were consistent with the intended use.
The isolates tested in the reproducibility study included E. cloacae (one
isolate), E. coli (seven isolates), K. oxytoca (three isolates), K. pneumoniae
(five isolates), P. aeruginosa (nine isolates).
Results were within +/- one doubling dilution agreement as compared to the
mode MIC value of Ceftolozane/Tazobactam for all organisms at all sites. All
results were on scale. The reproducibility was 97.33%.
The reproducibility results were acceptable.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Inoculum Density Check:
The inoculum was prepared to match a 0.5 McFarland. Colony counts were
performed periodically at each site to demonstrate that the inoculum
procedure results were in the expected CFU/mL.
Inoculum density checks were performed on E. coli ATCC 25922, quality
control strain, reproducibility and 10% of the fresh clinical isolates.
The mean inoculum density of E. coli ATCC 25922 was 2.6 x105 CFU/mL.
Quality Control (QC) Testing:
Organisms recommended by both FDA and CLSI, namely E. coli ATCC
25922, E. coli ATCC 35218, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603, and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were tested against
Ceftolozane/Tazobactam at four sites. These recommended QC organisms
were tested a minimum of 20 times/site by both the Etest
Ceftolozane/Tazobactam and reference method at each site. The Etest results
demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in the recommended
range > 95% of the time. Table 2 provides a summary of these QC results.
A second set of quality control results were obtained. This testing included
one additional quality control organism, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC
700603. This organism was also tested against Ceftazidime alone to check for
integrity of the plasmid-mediated resistance. Testing was conducted at four
external sites plus one internal site. Results are presented in Table 3a/3b
below.
K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 is recommended to test against ceftazidime
alone to ensure the presence of the plasmid encoding β-lactamase when
testing Ceftolozane/Tazobactam. The footnote below is included in the
labeling.
“K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 should be used for routine QC of
Ceftolozane/Tazobactam. This QC strain should also be tested against
ceftazidime alone to ensure that the plasmid encoding the beta-lactamase has
not been lost in this strain.”

Clinical testing was performed at five sites (four external and one internal). There
were 966 (793Enterobacteriaceae and 173Pseudomonas aeruginosa) clinical
isolates, of which 435 were stock (45%), and 531 were fresh (55%). All isolates
grew in the Etest Ceftolozane/Tazobactam test.
A challenge set consisting of 90 isolates (51 Enterobacteriaceae, and 39 P.
aeruginosa) was also evaluated at one external site. Each challenge isolate was
tested by the Etest Ceftolozane/Tazobactam and the CLSI reference method. All
of the challenge organisms grew in the Etest Ceftolozane/Tazobactam test.
The Etest Ceftolozane/Tazobactam results were compared to the CLSI broth
microdilution reference method tested at each study site. Results from the 1056 clinical
and challenge isolates are summarized in Table 4. The overall performance using the
Etest Ceftolozane/Tazobactam was acceptable, with an EA of 97.2%, CA of 98.6%, a
minor error (discrepancy) rate of 1.1% (12/1056), and a major error rate of 0.3% (3/928).

other resistance markers noted in the FDA drug label. The performance of the
Etest with Ceftolozane/Tazobactam included 38 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
45 Enterobacteriaceae isolates that were characterized as detailed below.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa:
Molecular characterization was conducted to determine beta lactamase
enzyme resistance marker status for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates for the
following: chromosomal AmpC, and loss of OprD. Enzyme characterization
was also performed for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates that produce serine
carbapenemases [K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)] and metallo-β-
lactamases.
Pseudomonas isolates with MexXY and MexAB up-regulation enzymes were
not evaluated as this information was not available at the time of testing. This
was addressed by adding the following footnote in the labeling:
“Enzyme group characterization was not available for the following
organisms at the time of comparative testing, and therefore the
performance of the Etest with Ceftolozane/Tazobactam is unknown for:
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (up-regulation of MexXY and MexAB) and
Enterobacteriaceae (OXA)”.
Enterobacteriaceae (ESBLs):
Molecular characterization was conducted to determine beta lactamase
enzyme resistance marker status for claimed Enterobacteriaceae isolates for
the following ESBLs: TEM, SHV and CTX-M. However, information on
Enterobacteriaceae isolates with OXA enzymes was not available at the time
of testing and was not provided. This was addressed by adding the footnote
listed above in the labeling.
Enterobacteriaceae (KPC and β-lactamases):
Enzyme characterization was also conducted for to determine carbapenemase
enzyme resistance marker status for claimed Enterobacteriaceae isolates that
produce serine carbapenemases [K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)].
However, MIC testing did not include Enterobacteriaceae isolates with
known metallo-beta lactamase status with the exception of one Proteus
mirabilis isolate tested that contain VEB metallo beta-lactamase. Tazobactam
is not an inhibitor of carbapenemases such as KPC and metallo-β-lactamases
such as IMP and VIM. In conformance with the Ceftolozane/Tazobactam
Pharmaceutical Drug label, the following footnote was added in the labeling
“Ceftolozane/Tazobactam is not active against Enterobacteriaceae that
produce KPC or metallo-beta lactamases”.
Page 10of 12

--- Page 11 ---
Resistant Organisms:
A total of 114 out of 1056 organisms tested (10.8%) were found to be resistant
to Ceftolozane/Tazobactam by the reference method. However, the following
indicated organisms had no resistant isolates available during comparative
testing: Citrobacter koseri, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia liquefacians. This
was addressed by adding the following limitation in the labeling:
“The ability of the Etest to detect resistance with the following combination
(s) is unknown because resistant strains were not available at the time of
comparative testing. If such a strain is observed, it should be submitted to a
reference laboratory for further testing
• Ceftolozane/Tazobactam: Citrobacter koseri, Proteus vulgaris, and
Serratia liquefacians”
MIC Trends:
Using the combined clinical and challenge data for Enterobacteriaceae an
analysis of trending was conducted. This trending calculation takes into
account MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilution
lower or higher compared to the reference method irrespective whether the
device MIC values are on-scale or not. The combined data for 821 results
constitute the evaluable data for trend analysis which is presented in Table 5.

A trend towards lower MIC reading was observed in the overall performance
of Enterobacteriaceae compared to the CLSI broth micro-dilution method,
which raises concerns for potential occurrence of very major errors. This
trending and the potential for occurrence of very major error(s) for
Ceftolozane/Tazobactam was addressed in the labeling by adding the
following footnote:
“Etest Ceftolozane/Tazobactam MIC values tended to be in exact agreement
or at least one doubling dilution lower when testing Enterobacteriaceae
compared to the reference broth micro-dilution”.
