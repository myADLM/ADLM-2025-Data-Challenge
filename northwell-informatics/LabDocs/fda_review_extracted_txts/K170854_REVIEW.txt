L. Test Principle:
The HemosIL AcuStar HIT‐IgG ) assay is a chemiluminescent two‐step immunoassay
(PF4‐H
consisting of paramagnetic beads coated with PF4 complexed to polyvinyl sulfonate (PVS)
which capture PF4/Heparin antibodies if present in the sample. Diluted patient plasma or
serum, the magnetic beads suspension, and the assay buffer are combined into a second
cuvette, and mixed. Following incubation, magnetic separation and a wash step, a tracer
consisting of an isoluminol conjugated anti-human IgG antibodies is added to the cuvette and
may bind the captured PF4/Heparin IgG on the particles. After a second incubation, magnetic
separation and wash step, reagents that trigger the luminescent reaction are added and the
emitted light is measured as Relative Light Units (RLU) by the ACL AcuStar optical system.
The RLUs are directly proportional to the PF4/Heparin IgG antibody concentration in the
sample.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
HemosIL AcuStar HIT‐IgG(PF4‐H) assay is a qualitative assay therefore, linearity is
not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
There is currently no International Standard available for Anti‐PF4/Heparin (PF4/H)
antibodies; therefore, each manufacturer must establish their own internal
standardization and reportable units. Two different types of calibrator materials are
prepared for the HemosIL AcuStar HIT‐IgG assay standardization:
(PF4‐H)
· House Standard Calibrators: Used internally to prepare the kit calibrators
· Kit Calibrators: Used by the ACL AcuStar instrument to prepare the Working
Calibration Curve
HemosIL AcuStar HIT‐IgG is standardized to House Standards (humanized
(PF4‐H)
monoclonal anti PF4‐Heparin antibody) diluted in Tris buffer containing bovine
serum albumin (BSA), stabilizers and preservative. The values of the House
Standards were set after studying a population of HIT suspected samples. Receiver
Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis vs Serotonin Release Assay (SRA)
demonstrated a clear separation of negative and positive results with an optimal
sensitivity and specificity using a cut‐off of 1.00 U/mL. The Primary Standard was
set at 1.00 U/mL.
Stability
HemosIL AcuStar HIT‐IgG reagent
(PF4‐H)
Reagent real-time shelf-life stability and continuous on-board stability testing was
performed using three lots of HemosIL AcuStar HIT-Ab kit reagents and
(PF4-H)
analyzed on the ACL AcuStar instrument. Shelf‐life testing included four plasma
samples and one lot of control material (low and high) analyzed with three reagent
lots. The lots were manufactured at different time points, spanning the claimed
stability range. Each material was analyzed in triplicate and compared to the results
obtained with the newly manufactured lot (Reference Lot) as time zero.
The continuous on-board stability was established at 12 weeks, after opening and
placed on board the ACL AcuStar.

The shelf-life stability was established at 12 months when stored at 2–8oC.
The HemosIL AcuStar HIT‐IgG(PF4‐H) kit is sensitive to temperature change.
Therefore, the shipping procedure requires refrigeration at 2–8oC. Transport will
include a delta‐track temperature monitor in each shipment to record temperature
values during transport.
HemosIL AcuStar HIT Controls
Three lots of HemosIL AcuStar HIT Controls were tested. The continuous on-board
stability was established at 12 hours on‐board the ACL AcuStar.
The cumulative on-board stability was established at 6 days when placed twice daily
on‐board (in an open barcoded tube) for 45 minutes and then recapped and placed at
2–8°C on the ACL AcuStar.
The shelf‐life stability was established at 12 months when stored at 2-8oC.
The HemosIL AcuStar HIT Controls are stable at high temperatures and are
unaffected by one freeze/thaw cycle. Controls can be frozen at ‐20°C and thawed
once. Do not refreeze.
HIT-IgG(PF4-H) Calibrators
The continuous on-board stability was established at 4 hours, after opening and
placed on-board the ACL AcuStar.
The shelf‐life stability was established at 12 months when stored at 2–8oC.
Expected values (controls, calibrators)
HemosIL AcuStar HIT Controls
The values for HemosIL AcuStar HIT Controls are assigned with respect to the House
Standard Controls according to internal protocol and are lot-specific.
An internal precision study was performed using three lots of HemosIL AcuStar HIT
Controls (low and high) run on ACL AcuStar instrument with a single lot of HemosIL
AcuStar HIT-IgG reagent. The control material was tested for 20 days x 2 runs
(PF4-H)
x 2 replicates per run, for a total N=80 measurements per level, for each lot. The
calculated precision data was within pre-established acceptance criteria. The data is

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of the Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) study was performed
using two different lots of HemosIL AcuStar HIT-IgG reagents tested on an
(PF4-H)
ACL AcuStar, according to CLSI EP17-A2. The LoB and LoD were established at
0.06 U/mL and 0.39 U/mL, respectively.
e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity for detecting anti-HIT antibodies was tested in an inhibition
assay with heparin, using 59 citrated plasma samples. Inhibition of a positive reaction
by ≥ 50% was considered confirmatory for the assay specificity to heparin-dependent
antibody characteristics of HIT. Four samples out of 59 were found not inhibited by
the HIT antibody.
A dose-response interference study was performed for hemoglobin, unconjugated
bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, triglycerides, low-molecular weight (LMW) heparin,
unfractionated (UF) heparin, rheumatoid factor, and human anti-mouse antibody
(HAMA). Three samples were prepared from healthy donors and HIT-positive

patients to achieve a negative (0.6 U/mL), weakly positive (1.0 U/mL) and positive
(7.0 U/mL) levels of the PF4-H antibody. The results of the study determined that the
HemosIL AcuStar HIT-IgG on the AcuStar analyzer is not affected by the
(PF4-H)
interferents up to the levels indicated in table below:
Highest Concentration with no
Interferent
Significant Interference
Hemoglobin 500 mg/dL
Bilirubin (conjugated and
18 mg/dL

Triglycerides 1250 mg/dL
LMW and UF Heparin 1 IU/mL
HAMA 1 μg/mL
Rheumatoid Factor was found to interfere with the assay. A limitation stating that
Rheumathoid Factor may produce an over estimation of the test result with the
HemosIL AcuStar HIT‐IgG assay is included in the labeling.
(PF4‐H)
Twenty-six samples from patients diagnosed with Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS)
were tested with a single lot of HemosIL AcuStar HIT‐IgG(PF4‐H) reagent. All
samples reported negative, demonstrating that the assay is not affected by APS
antibodies.
f. Assay cut-off:
A method comparison with the Serotonin Release Assay (SRA) was performed using
87 citrated plasma samples from HIT suspected patients (45 SRA positive and 42
SRA negative). The optimal cut-off determined by ROC analysis was 1.0 U/mL
(95.2% Agreement, CI = 86.7% ‒ 99.0%). Based on these studies, it was determined
that for heparin treated patient samples, HemosIL AcuStar HIT-IgG results ≥
(PF4-H)
1.0 U/mL may indicate the presence of HIT antibodies.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A multi-site clinical study included a total of 802 patients exposed to heparin and
suspected of HIT. The subjects enrolled in the study ranged from 18–97 years old. All
subjects were categorized according to the 4Ts pretest probability scoring system for
HIT. Studies were performed in three clinical test sites located in the United States.
Testing included comparison of AcuStar HIT‐IgG to the Zymutest HIA IgG
(PF4‐H)
assay (K071255).
The combined sites data, summarized below, are based on a cut-off of 1.0 U/mL for
the HemosIL HIT-Ab(PF4-H) assay and 0.5 OD for the Zymutest HIA IgG.

b. Matrix comparison:
3.2% vs. 3.8% Sodium Citrated Plasma
Twelve fresh, unadulterated, paired citrated 3.2% and 3.8% plasma samples were
tested for equivalence. In addition, 29 frozen paired 3.2% and 3.8% citrated plasma
samples were spiked with HIT-positive samples to achieve a concentration range
covering 0.15–66.82 U/mL. The study confirmed equivalence between 3.2% citrated
and 3.8% citrated plasma for fresh and frozen samples.
Sodium Citrated Plasma vs. Serum
Thirteen fresh unadulterated paired 3.2% citrated plasma and serum samples were
tested for equivalence. Additionally, 29 paired samples were collected and shipped
frozen to another location for testing. After thawing, the samples were spiked, with
HIT positive samples to achieve concentration range 0.13–75.92 U/mL. The study
confirmed matrix equivalence between 3.2% citrated plasma and serum for fresh and
frozen samples.
Fresh vs. Frozen Sample Study:
Fifty-seven unadulterated samples covering the range of 0.0–32.16 U/mL were tested
for fresh/frozen equivalence after storage at ≤ -20oC for at least 24 hours. The study
confirmed equivalence between matrices up to two freeze/thaw cycles.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Reference Interval – Healthy Donors Not Heparin Exposed
A total of N=154 citrated plasma samples from apparently healthy adult donors who were
not exposed to heparin were tested. The gender and age distribution was 88 females and
66 males, between 18 and 80 years of age. The data were analyzed using the non-
parametric quantile interval based on the order statistics. The reference interval was
calculated and the upper limit determined to be 0.37 U/mL (90% CI: 0.17 to 1.25 U/mL).
Reference Interval – Heparin Exposed, Not- HIT Suspected Patients (HIT Negative):
A total number of 91 samples from patients exposed to heparin but not suspected of HIT
were tested. The gender and age distribution included 39 females and 52 males,
between18 and 100 years of age. The statistical method applied to analyze the data was
the non-parametric quantile interval based on the order statistics. The reference interval
was calculated and the upper limit determined to be 0.75 U/mL (90% CI: 0.46 to 2.86
U/mL).

Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Barcode, manual entry
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Automated. The ACL AcuStar instrument’s fluidic system performs the sampling, adding
of diluents, reagent mixing, aspirating waste from cuvettes, cleaning of the magnetic
particles and dispensing and aspirating of trigger agents. The sample carousel can hold 6
sample racks (numbered 1 to 6), each capable of holding 5 samples for a total capacity of
30 samples. The sample racks are moved by the carousel to dedicated locations where an
aliquot of the sample can be aspirated and transferred for testing.
5. Calibration:
The HemosIL AcuStar HIT‐IgG assay utilizes a 4-Parameter Logistic Curve fit
(PF4‐H)
(4PLC) data reduction method to generate a Master Curve. The Master Curve is
predefined and lot dependent. The master curve is uploaded onto the ACL AcuStar
instrument through the Reagent Cartridge barcode. The master curve is generated by
analyzing, on different ACL AcuStar instruments (at least 2), on different days, a set of
internal materials at concentrations that cover the range of 0.00 U/mL up to 128.00
U/mL. A minimum of 72 determinations per level are obtained. Every new Reagent
Cartridge lot must be calibrated before first use with the HIT‐IgG(PF4‐H) Calibrators.
The calibrators are ready to use in a barcoded tube and when loaded, the ACL AcuStar
instrument automatically performs three replicates of each calibrator. Based on the results
obtained with the both Calibrators, an instrument specific 4PLC Working Curve is
created by the ACL AcuStar software, which is used to calculate the reported values
(U/mL) from the instrument signal (RLU) obtained for each sample.
6. Quality Control:
HemosIL AcuStar HIT Controls Low and High are recommended for a complete quality
control program.
