L. Test Principle:
The VALIDATE® D-Dimer Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Kit is used for calibration
verification and verification of the D-dimer measuring range of the INNOVANCE® D-Dimer
reagent with the Siemens Sysmex CS-2500® instrument system. The kit includes five levels
of D-dimer used to establish the relationship between theoretical and actual performance of
the D-Dimer analyte quantitatively. The Level 1 D-Dimer is configured to contain the lowest
level (lower limit) and Level 5 D-Dimer to contain the highest level (upper limit) of
concentration of D-Dimer of the measuring range. The intermediate levels (Level 2, Level 3,
and Level 4) are subsequently prepared from Level 1 and Level 5 by equal part dilutions
following the CLSI EP06-A guideline to measure intermediate levels of the measuring range.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was evaluated on the Siemens Sysmex CS-2500® instrument system
with the VALIDATE® D-Dimer Calibration Verification/Linearity Test kit. One lot
of VALIDATE® D-Dimer (levels 1–5) was tested with one lot of Siemens
INNOVANCE® D-Dimer reagent and quality controls on three instruments, across
multiple sites, over five days, with one run per day of each level, five replicates per
run, and a minimum of three operators. The study produced a total of 75 data points
for each level. The reproducibility study met the pre-specified acceptance criteria.
Results from the study are provided in the table below:

b. Precision/Repeatability:
To evaluate repeatability and within-laboratory precision, three lots of VALIDATE®
D-Dimer Calibration Verification/Linearity Test kit (levels 1–5) were tested with one
lot of Siemens INNOVANCE® D-Dimer reagent and quality controls at one site on
one Siemens Sysmex CS-2500® instrument system.The study was performed over 20
operating days, two runs per day, and two replicates per run with a minimum of two
operators to obtain a total of 240 replicates for each level. The repeatability study met
the pre-determined acceptance criteria. Results from the study are summarized in the
table below:

Linearity was determined using three lots of the VALIDATE® D-Dimer Calibration
Verification/Linearity Test kit on the Siemens Sysmex CS-2500® instrument.
Linearity performance was confirmed for the D-Dimer analyte using statistical
software. The D-dimer concentrations of each measured value of the five levels were
plotted vs. five assigned levels of concentration. The results were determined to be
linear.
d. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability:
Open Vial (Freeze/Thaw) Stability
A freeze/thaw vial stability assessment was performed to support the open vial
stability claim. Three lots of the VALIDATE® D-Dimer Calibration
Verification/Linearity Test kit were tested on a Siemens Sysmex CS-2500®
instrument. The study demonstrated that each level of VALIDATE® D-Dimer is
stable after four freeze/thaw events when stored at -10 to -25°C. The study met the
pre-determined acceptance criteria.
Closed Vial Stability Study
Real-time stability testing was performed using three lots of VALIDATE® D-Dimer
Calibration Verification/Linearity Test kit on a Siemens Sysmex CS-2500®
instrument. Results from the VALIDATE® D-Dimer meet acceptance criteria out to a
2 month time point from the date of manufacture (DOM) when stored at -10 to -25°C.
A 2 month expiry date is supported by current stability data. Real-time stability
testing is ongoing. Stability data is being maintained to extend the stability claim of
the VALIDATE® D-Dimer Calibration Verification/Linearity Test kit.

Expected Values:
Value Assignment/Recovery Data
Value assignment for the VALIDATE® D-Dimer Calibration Verification/Linearity
Test kit is established by testing Level 1 (lowest concentration) and Level 5 (highest
concentration) of VALIDATE® D-Dimer to generate 30 replicates on one Siemens
Sysmex CS-2500® instrument. The value assignments for the intermediate levels are
calculated based on an equal distance (delta) between levels. Levels 1 and 5 are
prepared independently by the addition of D-dimer to a human plasma base matrix.
Intermediate Levels 2, 3, and 4 are subsequently prepared from Levels 1 and 5 by
equal part dilutions following CLSI EP06-A. The value assignment study met the pre-
determined acceptance criteria. Typical recovery target values for all five levels are
presented in the table below:
