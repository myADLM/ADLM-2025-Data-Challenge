I. Device Description:
The CoaguChek Vantus System consists of a hand-held CoaguChek Vantus meter, used in
combination with the CoaguChek XS PT test strips. The CoaguChek Vantus meter is a small
handheld instrument intended for the quantitative measurement of INR based on a PT
response by using a single electrochemical test strip. The CoaguChek XS PT test strip
contains a lyophilized reagent (reagent in dried form). The reactive components of this
reagent consist of thromboplastin and a peptide substrate.
The test strip has one reaction chamber, which includes both the prothrombin time reaction
and on-board quality control (OBC). The prothrombin time test reaction and OBC tests run
simultaneously, which are based on electrochemical technology. If the quality control are
within limits, the strip integrity is verified. If the OBC is not within limits, the meter displays
an according error and the test result is not reported.

L. Test Principle:
When a blood sample is applied to the test strip, thromboplastin activates the coagulation
cascade which leads to the formation of thrombin. The activity of thrombin, the final protease
for both plasmatic coagulation pathways, is monitored during the test instead of detecting the
clot by mechanical or optical methods. Thrombin cleaves the thrombin substrate creating an
electrochemically active peptide, which generates an electrical signal. The signal is converted
to a PT/INR value and displayed by the CoaguChek Vantus meter.
The CoaguChek Vantus System connects with the CoaguChek® XS PT test strip by means
of seven main electronic pins. These contact points allow the CoaguChek Vantus meter to
generate and display valid PT/INR results even if there are minor defects on the test strip
(e.g. small scratches).
CoaguChek Vantus uses the identical electrochemical technology as the CoaguChek XS
System to perform the PT test and the on-board quality control (OBC) test simultaneously.
The OBCchecks the test strip integrity for damage from extreme temperature, humidity or
light. The chemical components of the OBC are added directly to the formulation of the
thromboplastin reagent. This ensures that the check for the test strip integrity is performed
for every single strip at the same place and same time as the PT test (“on the spot OBC”).
The test system determines whether the OBC result is within preset limits, if it is, then the
strip integrity is verified, and the meter reports the PT test. If the OBC is not within limits,
the meter displays an error and a test result is not reported. Release testing during
manufacturing determines and sets the lot-specific ranges for the OBC.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:

i. Linearity: Not applicable
ii. Assay Reportable Range: The assay reportable range (0.8 – 6.0 INR) of the
CoaguChek Vantus System was established through method comparison studies
against both the predicate (Roche CoaguChek XS System) and the reference
device (Sysmex CA-1500 laboratory analyzer using Dade Innovin Reagent).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i. Traceability: Each lot of CoaguChek XS PT test strips is factory calibrated to a
reference lot of human recombinant thromboplastin traceable to the WHO
International Reference Preparation, rTF/95.
ii. Closed Vial and Transport Stability: The CoaguChek XS PT test strips were
stored at 2–8°C and 26–30°C and tested after a storage time of 3, 6, 16 and 25
months.
iii. Open Vial Stability: Open vial stability simulates the repeated opening and
closing of the vial by the customer when test strips are removed from the vial for
measurement. Open vial stability was tested by opening the vials once per day for
at least one minute at 32°C, 85% relative humidity (RH) over a period of 30 days.
iv. Out of Vial Stability: Out of vial stability was tested to demonstrate that the test
strips can be kept outside the vial before measurement for at least 10 minutes
when directly exposed to 32°C, 85% RH. This was verified by storing the test
strip outside the vial under the specified environmental conditions for 14 minutes
before measurement.
d. Detection limit:
Factor sensitivity was assessed for coagulation factors II, V, VII and X using four lots
of CoaguChek XS PT test strips. The factor sensitivity was performed using standard
human plasma that was mixed with varying amounts of factor II, V, VII and X
deficient plasma to obtain plasma samples with different factor activities (0, 1, 19, 20,
30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100%). For each CoaguChek XS PT test strip, four
measurements were performed per coagulation factor and dilution level. The study
verifies factor sensitivity for the CoaguChek XS PT test strips at the following levels:
Factor II < 31%; Factor V < 46%; Factor VII < 44%; and Factor X < 50%.
e. Analytical specificity:
The interference studies were performed for the following interferents: bilirubin,
hemolysis, heparin, LMWH and triglycerides. In addition, an interference study was
conducted to characterize the levels of other known drugs: oritavancin, daptomycin,
clopidogrel, fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran and edoxaban.
7

--- Page 8 ---
Interference limits were established using up to four CoaguChek XS PT test strip lots,
using fresh citrated venous whole blood from both normal and warfarin blood
samples spiked separately with the interferents. The acceptance criteria for
interference effect of the aforementioned interferents were met. The interference
study results demonstrate that the following interferents do not interfere with test
results up to following concentrations:
Interferent Concentration
Bilirubin Up to 30mg/dL
Hemolysis Up to 1000 mg/dL
Heparin Up to 0.8 U/mL
Low Molecular Weight Heparin Up to 2 IU anti-factor XA activity/mL
Triglycerides Up to 500 mg/dL
Clopidogrel Up to 20 mg/dL
Fondaparinux Up to 0.5 mg/L
Oritavancin Cannot be tested with the system
Daptomycin Up to 50 mg/L
Rivaroxaban Cannot be tested with the system
Apixaban Cannot be tested with the system
Dabigatran Cannot be tested with the system
Edoxaban Cannot be tested with the system
Hematocrit
The hematocrit interference study was conducted with one lot of CoaguChek XS PT test
strips on the CoaguChek Vantus meter using venous whole blood samples from three
healthy donors and 10 VKA treated donors adjusted to the following hematocrit values:
0%, 15%, 30%, 45% and 55%. To achieve the desired hematocrit values, centrifugation
was utilized and at least four measurements were performed per sample. Results
demonstrated that the CoaguChek XS PT test strip is unaffected by hematocrits within
the claimed hematocrit range of 25–55%.
f. Assay cut-off

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Accuracy was evaluated by comparing the CoaguChek Vantus System against the
predicate device, CoaguChek XS System. The method comparison study was
performed using capillary whole blood samples from subjects not receiving warfarin
and from subjects on warfarin therapy. The method comparison study was conducted
across four point-of-care sites using three CoaguChek XS PT test strip lots. The table
below summarizes the study results by individual sites and combined sites.

Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Code chip contains information about the test method, the lot number and the expiry date.
The date and INR result is recorded by the CoaguChek Vantus meter.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The CoaguChek XS PT test strip is intended for single-use only. Once the test strip is
inserted into the meter, a drop of fresh capillary whole blood sample collected by a
fingerstick is manually applied to the test strip target area and analyzed by the
CoaguChek Vantus meter.
5. Calibration:
Each lot of CoaguChek XS PT test strips is factor calibrated to a reference lot of human
recombinant thromboplastin traceable to the World Health Organization International
Reference Preparation. This lot-specific calibration information is embedded within the
code chip, which is required by the CoaguChek Vantus meter prior to using the specific
lot of the CoaguChek XS PT test strip.
6. Quality Control:
The CoaguChek Vantus System provides On-Board Controls (OBC), which provide a
quality control check for each individual CoaguChek XS PT test strip used with the
CoaguChek Vantus meter. There are no additional steps required by the user to activate
the OBC.
When a test strip is inserted, the CoaguChek Vantus meter, the first check assesses
potential issues with the reagent. The second check ensures that the test strip has not been
exposed to environment conditions or physical stresses, like bending. If either of these
checks do not pass, then no INR result is provided.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Temperature and Altitude Study: The purpose of this study was to examine the specified
operating temperature and humidity conditions for the CoaguChek XS PT test strip on the
CoaguChek Vantus instrument. Using the CoaguChek XS PT test strip, operating
temperature range was evaluated using two different levels of CoaguChek XS PT Controls
over the specified temperature range of 15–32°C (59–90°F) and the specified relative
humidity (RH) range of 10–85%. Additional temperature conditions were also tested in
combination with 60% RH: 9°C, 12°C, 23°C, 34°C and 36°C. Results from these studies met
the acceptance criteria and demonstrated that the performance of the CoaguChek XS PT test
strip on the CoaguChek Vantus instrument is not affected by operating temperatures under
the conditions specified above.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable.
