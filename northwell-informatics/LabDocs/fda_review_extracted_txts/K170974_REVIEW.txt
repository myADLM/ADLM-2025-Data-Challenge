E. Systems Description:
1. Device Description:
The BD FACSLyric™ flow cytometer (3−1, 4−2, 4−2−2, and 4−3−3 optical
configurations) systems consist of a flow cytometer, sheath tank, waste tank, and a
computer workstation. System options include an automated FACS Universal Loader and
a barcode reader.
The BD FACSLyric Flow Cytometer includes the 488 nm laser and 640 nm laser as part
of four available manufactured instrument configurations.

The lower level configurations are upgradeable to higher level configurations by adding
filters, photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), and a laser. Only the 488 nm laser and 640 nm
lasers are utilized for cleared in vitro diagnostic (IVD) applications and only fluorescence
channels 1 (FL1) through FL6 are the subject of this 510(k) submission. Seven to ten-
color immunophenotyping is for research use only (RUO).
All optical configurations of the FACSLyric share the same dimensions: 22.8 inches in
height by 24.93 inches in width by 22.8 inches in depth.

a. Accuracy:
The Accuracy study was performed based on recommendations in the CLSI
document CLSI EP9-A3, Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation
Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline- Third Edition. The accuracy study
demonstrates equivalence between the test system BD FACSLyric™ with BD
FACSuite™ clinical software and the BD FACSCantoII™ (predicate) with BD
FACSCanto™ clinical software. Method comparison with the predicate instrument
was used to determine accuracy through comparative evaluation of the same
specimen stained with the BD Multitest IMK Kit (4-color; IMK) and the BD
Multitest 6-color TBNK reagent (TBNK) and analyzed in parallel with the new
instrument and the predicate device. A total of 297 specimens were tested using
Multitest 6-Color TBNK and 336 specimens from apparently healthy normals and
HIV patients were tested with Multitest IMK kit at five clinical sites. Seven
manipulated specimens were included in the analysis. Results are presented in the
tables below:

Instrument Configuration Comparison was performed with 44 specimens comprised
of HIV+ donors and normal donors. Four of the normal donor samples were
manipulated in order to provide for absolute CD4 count across the AMR.
Manipulations were done by diluting the whole blood specimen using cell free
plasma and PBS to yield the desired CD4+ absolute count. The comparison
demonstrated the performance equivalency of the six IVD channels between the 3-1,
4-2, 4-2-2 and 4-3-3 optical configurations of the FACSLyric flow cytometer.
b. Precision/Reproducibility: The precision study was performed based on
recommendations in the CLSI document CLSI EP5-A3, Evaluation of Precision of
Quantitative Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline-Third Edition.
Repeatability:
Within-Site Repeatability was performed for the enumeration of the lymphocyte
subset percentages and absolute counts across four FACSLyric flow cytometers, each
with a different optical configuration. Testing was performed by four operators, two
runs per day for 21 days using Streck CD-Chex Plus (K960894) and Streck CD-Chex
Plus CD4 Low (K931825) as the control samples with four lots of 6-color TBNK
reagent and four lots of IMK reagent. Multi-Check and Multi-Check CD4 Low
Controls were used as the process controls. Each sample was stained in duplicate in
Trucount tubes.

Whole Blood Repeatability performance was determined by enumeration of CD3+,
CD4+, CD8+, CD19+ and CD16+56+ lymphocyte subset percentages and absolute
counts across all configurations of BD FACSLyric cytometers, using the BD
Multitest 4-Color TBNK reagents (BD Multitest CD3/CD8/CD45/CD4 and BD
Multitest CD3/CD16+CD56/CD45/CD19) and BD Multitest 6-Color TBNK reagents
in Trucount tubes. A total of 12 instruments were used with the 4-color assay and 9
instruments were used with the 6-color assay. Patient specimens were run in duplicate
per instrument x three instruments x four configurations for 4-color reagents and 3
configurations for 6-color reagents. Specimens were tested with representation of
values for CD4 across the AMR.

Whole Blood Repeatability was also performed for absolute CD4counts. The study
was performed with 44 samples including normal and HIV+ patient samples.
Specimens spanned the analytical measuring range (AMR) and closely bracketed the
medical decision points (very low <50 CD4 cells/μL and low 50 to <200 CD4
cells/μL).

Reproducibility:
Inter-laboratory reproducibility was carried out at four clinical sites using Streck CD-
Chex Plus (K960894) process control materials tested for a minimum of 5 non-
consecutive days with one operator per site and one instrument per site. Three
replicates of each level (normal and low) of the control material were tested during
two runs per day on the FACSLyric system. The variability for within-run, between-
run, between-day, between-site and total precision per reagent and lymphocyte subset
was evaluated.

c. Linearity/assay reportable range: The linearity study was performed based on
recommendations in the CLSI document CLSI EP6-A6, Evaluation of the Linearity of
Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline.
Linearity was evaluated using triplicate measurements of 11 concentrations of
lymphocyte subsets across a range approximately 20 to 30% wider than the
anticipated linear range. In addition, seven supplemental concentration levels for CD4
were used to evaluate linearity near the medical decision point at 50 cells/μL and 200
cells/μL for CD4 absolute counts. Linearity studies were performed on each
configuration to verify that the relationship between the observed values and the true
concentrations of the analyte was linear for each configuration. The objective of each
linearity study was to estimate the linearity of the BD FACSLyric with BD
FACSuite™ clinical software using the BD Multitest IMK Kit (4-color) and the BD
Multitest 6-color TBNK reagent for the lyse/no-wash method of sample preparation.
Whole blood samples collected in EDTA tubes were fractionated by centrifugation to
isolate PBMCs, plasma, and RBCs. A low concentration pool was created using
autologous plasma reconstituted with RBCs; a high concentration pool was created
using concentrated PBMCs in autologous plasma and RBCs. Intermediate
concentration levels were created by proportionally mixing high and low pools.
Replicates of each dilution were stained with the BD Multitest IMK Kit (4-color) and
BD Multitest 6-color TBNK Reagent in Trucount tubes.
Regression statistics were provided for all each cellular subset. The instrument system
using the FACSuiteClinical software for the IMK and TBNK assay was found to be
linear for each parameter (absolute counts) for each configuration.
d. Carryover: The carryover studies were performed based on CLSI H26-A2 Validation,
Verification, and Quality Assurance of Automated Hematology Analyzers; Approved
Standard- Second Edition.
Sample Carryover:
Specimen carry over studies were performed on the BD FACSLyric™ to determine
whether results were affected by contamination from neighboring samples. System
carryover was evaluated by estimating the percent carryover of abnormally high
leucocyte count samples to abnormally low leucocyte count samples. Three high
leucocyte concentration samples were acquired sequentially, immediately followed
by the sequential acquisition of three low leucocyte concentration samples. Carryover
of both BD FACS Universal Loader (UL) and manual acquisition was evaluated on
three FACSLyric instruments (one 3-1 and two 4-3-3) using two different sample
volumes, 500 uL and 1500 uL and calculating the percent difference according to the
formula % Carryover = [(L1-L3)/H3-L3)]*100.
Carryover from one specimen to another was demonstrated to be leucocyte carryover
less than or equal to 0.1% for low carryover and less than or equal to 0.5% for
17

--- Page 18 ---
standard carryover on all three FACSLyric instruments.
Reagent Carryover:
Percent volume carryover was measured by enumeration of Trucount Control beads
in known concentrations and sample volumes. Percent reagent carryover was then
calculated using the volume carryover because the amount of reagent is consistent
throughout the sample. Three replicates of Trucount tubes with Trucount High
Control beads were run first, followed by three replicates of Trucount tubes without
Trucount Control beads. The volume carryover was quantified by the number of
Trucount High Control beads present in the first tube without Trucount Control beads
(L1) after subtracting the number of events present in the third tube without Trucount
Control beads (L3), this tube is considered background. This procedure was repeated
three times on each instrument and each run was evaluated individually. The volume
carryover experiment was carried out on three FACSLyric instruments using UL
acquisition on two instruments and manual acquisition on one instrument. The
amount of reagent being carried over is found to be well below the amount of reagent
required for effective staining of the sample.
e. Interfering Substances:

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
Limit of Blank (LoB); Limit of Detection (LoD); Limit of Quantitation (LoQ):
The study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2, Evaluation of Detection
Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline-
Second Edition.
Twenty four samples with sixty total replicates were evaluated for each blank for LoB
and low concentration sample for LoD per reagent lot, across four test days for each
instrument configuration. Three lots of the reagent were collected for a total of 180 data
points per assay and configuration combination. LoB and LoD for all reagents tested was
less than 15 cells/μL. For CD4 Lymphocyte subset absolute counts of each of the
reagents, the established LoB and LoD were less than 50 cells/μL.
For LoQ determination, four low concentration pools were created by diluting normal
whole blood with cell free plasma to achieve CD4 absolute counts of 10, 20, 30 and 50
cells/μL. Forty replicates were prepared from each of the concentration pools and were
stained with two different lots of each reagent. Ten replicates from each concentration
pool were run on each FACSLyric instrument configuration. The remaining ten replicates
were run on the predicate device, FACSCanto II. The LoQ of the FACSLyric system with
Multitest reagents was established for the CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, CD19+,
CD16+CD56+ and CD45+ lymphocyte subsets. The LoQ is less than 50 cells/μL for
CD4 absolute count.

Expected values/Reference range:
The reference interval study was performed based on recommendations in the CLSI
document CLSI EP28-A3c, How to Define and Determine Reference Intervals in the
Clinical Laboratory, Approved Guideline-Second Edition. A total of 134 samples for
Multitest 6-Color TBNK and 130 samples for Multitest IMK kit from one clinical site
were evaluated. Reference Intervals for all lymphocyte subsets in the Multitest 6-Color
TBNK and Multitest IMK kit were established for the FACSLyric system. Testing was
performed using prospectively procured EDTA venous blood specimens from apparently
healthy adult male and female subjects free of hematological abnormalities to satisfy age.
