DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k170983
B. Purpose for Submission:
Modification of a previously cleared device to add a 6 second exhalation mode
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Circassia AB NIOX VERO
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Quantitative
E. System Descriptions:
1. DeviceDescription:
NIOX VERO is a portable system for the non‐invasive, quantitative measurement of the
fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (NO) in expired human breath (FeNO).
The NIOX VERO system is comprised of the NIOX VERO unit with AC adapter, a
rechargeable battery, an electrochemical NO sensor, disposable patient filters, and an
exchangeable handle containing an internal NO scrubber filter. The NIOX Panel is an
optional PC application for operation of the NIOX VERO from a PC and access to
electronic medical record systems. The device can connect to the PC via a standard USB
cable or wirelessly via Bluetooth.
For testing, the patient empties their lungs, inhales deeply through the patient filter to
total lung capacity and then slowly exhales for 6 or 10 seconds, depending on the mode
of operation. The default mode of operation is the 10 second exhalation mode. In
approximately one minute, the NO concentration is displayed in parts per billion (ppb).
Results are processed using dedicated software. The device has built‐in system control
procedures and a Quality Control procedure to be performed on a daily basis.
2. Principles of Operation:
The measurement principle is based on American Thoracic Society guidelines (ATS/ERS
Recommendations for Standardized Procedures for the Online and Offline Measurement
of Exhaled Lower Respiratory Nitric Oxide and Nasal Nitric Oxide, 2005. Am J Respir
1

--- Page 2 ---
Crit Care Med. 2005;171:912-930). The last three second fraction of a 6 second or 10
second exhalation is evaluated for average NO concentration. The exhalation flow is
controlled to 50 ml/s ±5 ml/s at an applied pressure of 10 to 20 cm H O. Sample is
2
evaluated in 25 seconds (2 ml/sec for 25 seconds). The inhaled air is NO free. NO is
measured using electrochemical detection. There is a gas inlet chamber with an
electrolyte (sulfuric acid solution) and hardware. The NO molecules diffuse through the
membrane and reach the electrolyte. A chemical reaction takes place where one electron
for each NO molecule is generated. The current is proportional to the number of
converted NO molecules.
3. Modes of Operation:

or mobile device?
Yes ___X____ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ___X____ or No ________
4. Specimen Identification:
There is no mechanism to identify the specimen.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The user obtains a breath sample by exhaling into the device.
6. Calibration:
The manufacturer performs calibration for each NIOX VERO sensor. NIOX VERO
sensor is an electrochemical sensor pre-calibrated and pre-programmed for a defined
number of tests (60, 100, 300, 500, or 1000 tests).The user exchanges the sensor upon
expiration. The instrument prompts the user for upcoming exchange prior to sensor
expiration and does not allow for measurements with an expired sensor. No additional
calibration is needed during the lifetime of the sensor.
7. Quality Control:
NIOX VERO provides internal controls as well as an External Quality Control program
for the user to verify the reliability of measurements.

G. Intended Use:
1. Indication(s) for Use:
NIOX VERO measures Nitric Oxide (NO) in human breath. Nitric Oxide is frequently
increased in some airway inflammatory processes such as asthma. The fractional NO
concentration in expired breath (FeNO), can be measured by NIOX VERO according to
guidelines for NO measurement established by the American Thoracic Society.
Measurement of FeNO by NIOX VERO is a quantitative, non-invasive, simple and safe
method to measure the decrease in FeNO concentration in asthma patients that often
occurs after treatment with anti-inflammatory pharmacological therapy, as an indication
of the therapeutic effect in patients with elevated FeNO levels. NIOX VERO is suitable
for children, 7- 17 years, and adults 18 years and older.
NIOX VERO 10 second test mode is for age 7 and up.
NIOX VERO 6 second test mode is for ages 7-10 only who cannot successfully complete
a 10 second test.
FeNO measurements provide the physician with means of evaluating an asthma patient's
3

--- Page 4 ---
response to anti-inflammatory therapy, as an adjunct to the established clinical and
laboratory assessments in asthma. The NIOX VERO is intended for prescription use and
should only be used as directed in the NIOX VERO User Manual by trained healthcare
professionals. NIOX VERO cannot be used with infants or by children under the age of 7
as measurement requires patient cooperation.
NIOX VERO should not be used in critical care, emergency care or in anesthesiology.
2. Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
NIOX VERO should only be operated by trained healthcare professionals and only after
careful reading of the NIOX VERO User Manual.
The device should not be used with infants or by children under the age of 7, or any
patient who cannot cooperate with any necessary requirements of test performance.
The device should not be used in critical care, emergency care or in anaesthesiology.
Subjects should not smoke in the hour before measurements, and short- and long-term
active and passive smoking history should be recorded. In addition, subjects should
refrain from eating and drinking for 1 hour before exhaled NO measurement. Alcohol
ingestion reduces FENO in patients with asthma and healthy subjects FENO.
It is prudent, where possible, to perform serial NO measurements in the same period of
the day and to always record the time.
For prescription use only.

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
A method comparison study was performed to assess the agreement between the 6
second and 10 second exhalation modes of the NIOX VERO in patients ages 7 – 10.
The difference in FeNO measurements between the 6 second and 10 second
exhalation modes was not clinically significant.
b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Analytical precision for the 6 second exhalation mode was evaluated based on the
CLSI standard EP5-A2. A certified NO calibration gas concentration of 200 ppb was
mixed with nitrogen gas in a gas mixer to create concentrations of 5, 25, 75, and 200
ppb. Data was collected over 20 operating days, two runs per day, with duplicate
determinations for each concentration. The repeatability and within-device precision
over 20 days were determined for each concentration. Five NIOX VERO sensors,
continually mounted in 5 NIOX VERO instruments, respectively, were used. The
results at the 5 and 25 ppb levels, expressed as standard deviation (ppb), and at the 75
and 200 ppb levels, expressed as percent CV (%), are as follows:

c. Linearity:
Linearity of measurements using the 6 second exhalation mode was determined using
certified NO at 200 ppb and 2000 ppb in nitrogen calibration gas mixed with nitrogen
gas in a gas mixer, connected in-line with the NIOX VERO instrument, (with
mounted NIOX VERO sensors), to obtain 7 NO concentration levels (3, 5, 25, 100,
200, 300 and 330 ppb). Five replicate determinations of the concentrations at 3 and 5
ppb, and three replicate determinations on the other intervals were made.
For the 10 devices tested, the regression analysis gave slopes of 1.05 to 1.09 and
intercept ± 4 ppb. The squared correlation coefficient r2 was 0.999 for all 10 devices
tested. Results indicate linearity within the 5-300 ppb measuring range.
Effects of Temperature and Relative Humidity
The effects of temperature and relative humidity were characterized in k133898.
Please refer to the Decision Memorandum for k133898 for details.
d. Carryover:
Not applicable
e. Interfering Substances:
The effect of potentially interfering substances was characterized in k133898.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
Other clinical supportive data:
A clinical study was not conducted with the 6 second mode of the NIOX VERO device.
In 2007, a multi-center device randomized open-label prospective single-cohort study
was conducted to demonstrate substantial equivalence between NIOX MINO and
predicate device (NIOX) when measuring the change of FeNO that often occurs after 2
weeks of corticosteroid therapy compared to their baseline levels. Symptomatic asthmatic
males and females performed two valid FeNO measurements at each visit, with NIOX
MINO and NIOX respectively, with a limit of six exhalation attempts per subject in each
device. The order of the FENO measurement on NIOX MINO versus NIOX was
randomized. At every visit and for every patient, spirometry was performed and asthma
symptoms were recorded using Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ). In total, 156
subjects were included, 105 adults 18 - 70 years old and 51 children 7 - 17 years old.
Results from this study, in conjunction with the new method comparison study described
above, were determined to be applicable to the 6 second mode of the candidate device,
the NIOX VERO. See k072816 for more details.

Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The NIOX VERO instrument is calibrated by the manufacturer and does not require
calibration by the user. A replaceable sensor is used which is pre-programmed and pre-
calibrated for a defined number of tests. The life time of NIOX VERO instrument is set
to 5.5 years. The number of possible tests is 15000. The sensor life time is limited to 12
months in unopened packaging following manufacture, for 6 months from initial
installation into NIOX VERO, or for the defined number of tests (60, 100, 300, 500 or
1000), whichever comes first. The shelf life for NIOX Filter in unopened primary
package is 2 years. NIOX Filter is for single use and must be replaced for every new
patient and measurement occasion. Stability information to support all claims was
reviewed in k133898.
Detection limit:
The detection limit of the NIOX VERO using the 6 second mode was determined in a
laboratory setting, using mixtures of standard reference NO gas and nitrogen gas below
and above the detection limit, at 3 and 5 ppb. Five replicate determinations of each
concentration were made. 10 NIOX VERO sensors, continually mounted in 10 NIOX
VERO instruments, respectively, were used in these tests. The results of the study support
the claimed detection limit of 5 ppb for the 6 second mode.
Expected values/Reference range:
The expected values are provided from the literature. In the labeling the sponsor states,
“Given that physiological and environmental factors can affect FeNO, FeNO levels in
clinical practice need to be established on an individual basis. However, most healthy
individuals will have NO levels in the range 5-35 ppb (children slightly lower, 5-25 ppb)
when measured at 50 ml/s.

K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
L. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
