L. Test Principle:
The principle of the assay is chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay, a variation of
solid phase immunoassay. The QUANTA Flash® Calprotectin assay is designed to run on
the BIO-FLASH® instrument. This platform is a fully automated closed system with
continuous load and random access capabilities that automatically processes the samples,
runs the assay and reports the results. It includes liquid handling hardware, luminometer and
computer with software-user interface. The QUANTA Flash® Calprotectin assay utilizes a
reagent cartridge format, which is compatible with the BIO-FLASH® instrument.

Calprotectin-specific capture antibodies are coated on to paramagnetic beads, which are
stored in the reagent cartridge under conditions that preserve the antibody in its reactive state.
Prior to use in the BIO-FLASH® system, the reagent pack containing all the necessary assay
reagents is mixed thoroughly by being inverted several times. The sealed reagent tubes are
pierced with the reagent cartridge lid, and the reagent cartridge is loaded onto the instrument.
Reagents are calibrated when the lot is first used. A patient extracted stool sample is
prediluted by the BIO-FLASH® with sample buffer in a disposable plastic cuvette. Small
amounts of the diluted patient extracted stool, the beads, and the assay buffer are all
combined into a second cuvette, and mixed. This cuvette is then incubated at 37°C. The
beads are magnetized and washed several times. Isoluminol conjugated monoclonal anti-
calprotectin antibodies are then added to the cuvette, and again incubated at 37°C. The beads
are magnetized and washed repeatedly. The isoluminol conjugate is oxidized when Trigger 1
(Fe(III)coproporphyrin in sodium hydroxide solution) and Trigger 2 (urea-hydrogen peroxide
in sodium chloride solution) are added to the cuvette, and the flash of light produced from
this reaction is measured as Relative Light Units (RLU) by the BIO-FLASH® optical
system. The measured RLU is proportional to the amount of bound isoluminol conjugate,
which is in turn proportional to the amount of calprotectin antigen captured by the antibodies
(anti-calprotectin polyclonal antibodies in this case) on the beads. For quantitation, the
QUANTA Flash® Calprotectin will utilize a predefined lot specific Master Curve that is
uploaded onto the instrument through the reagent cartridge barcode. The Master Curve for
each reagent pack lot with in-house Standards with assigned unit values (ng/mL). The RLU
and assigned ng/mL values of the Standards are used to create a 4 parameter logistic curve.
These four parameters are embedded in the reagent pack barcode. When the lot is used the
first time, the Calibrators are run, and based on the results obtained on the Calibrators, an
instrument specific Working Curve is created; The Working Curve is used to calculate units
(ng/mL) based on RLU values obtained on each sample. The obtained ng/mL values will be
converted to mg/kg by a calculation that takes into account the dilution of the samples. This
unit conversion is calculated automatically by the software.

Accuracy/Recovery
Assay recovery was evaluated using seven extracted stool samples containing various
concentrations of calprotectin antigen covering the AMR of the assay. Extracts were
spiked with calibrator material and then tested to calculate recovery results. For the
samples with calprotectin concentrations lower than 200 mg/kg, Calibrator 2 was
used as spiking material, while for samples with concentrations higher than 200
mg/kg, Calibrator 3 was used. Each sample was mixed with their correspondent
calibrator material in a proportion of 9:1. Each sample, calibrator and spiked sample
was tested in duplicate and recovery values were calculated. The results are
presented in the table below:

Stability
Reagent Stability: The study was done to support the shelf-life stability of the the kit
reagents (Beads, tracer, calibrators, low and high controls, extraction buffer, and
special wash). Accelerated stability was performed using three lots of reagents at
37°C for three weeks, where one week is equal to six months a 5 ± 3 °C. The results
support a stability claim up to 12 months at 5 ± 3 °C.
Real-time reagent Stability: Real time stability testing was completed up to six
months at the time of the submission. Additional real-time stability testing is on-
going.
In-use (onboard) Stability: The study was performed to determine the stability of
reagents used over a period of time or for a number of assay runs. The results support
calibrator stability for up to four calibrations over an eight hour period. The results
support the claim that controls can be used up to 15 times. For reagent cartridges, the
result support an in-use stability claim of 90 days. For Calprotectin Extraction Buffer
diluted to 1X, the results support a stability claim of 90 days when stored at 2–8°C.
For the special wash, the results support the QUANTA Flash Special wash onboard
(in‐use) stability claim of 30 days uncapped continuous use, or 720 hours distributed
over 90 days onboard of the instrument.
Sample Stability: The stool stability claim for four days at 2–8°C was established by
K160447 and acceptable because both devices use the same capture and detection
antibodies. Further, the stability claim was up and supported by Walsham et.al., Clin.
Exp. Gastroenteriology, 2016; 9: 21–29.
Analyte Stability: The study was performed to determine the stability of extracted
stool samples when stored at various temperatures. The study results support stability
of extracts for 72 hours at room temperature; 24 days at 2–8°C; and up to three
months at -20°C. The study results also supports extract stability up to five freeze-
thaw cycles.
d. Detection limit:
The LoB was determined using four blank samples, using two different lots of
reagents. Samples were run in replicates of five, for three days, for a total of 60
replicates per reagent lot. The LoB was determined at the 95th percentile using the
parametric method for one lot and the non-parametric methodod for the second lot.
The LoB was determined to be 0.0 mg/kg.
The LoD was determined using four samples, two reagent lots, five replicates per
run, for three days, consistent with CLSI EP17‐A2 guideline with proportions of false
positives (alpha) less than 5% and false negatives (beta) less than 5%. The
determination was based on 240 measurements, with 60 measurements on blank
samples and 60 measurements of low level samples per reagent lot. LoD was
11

--- Page 12 ---
determined to be 2.4 mg/kg.
For determination of the LoQ, two low level samples were tested in replicates of five,
on two reagent lots, once per day, for 3 days, obtaining 30 data points per sample to
generate data used to calculate the LoQ for the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin assay.
The LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration at which total imprecision was
<20%. The LoQ for the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin assay was determined to be
16.1 mg/kg, which has been set as the lower limit of the AMR.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference was performed according to CLSI EP07‐A2: Interference Testing in
Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline ‐ Second Edition. Six human stool
specimens were tested, one high positive (1365.1 mg/kg), one moderately positive
(664.7 mg/kg), one low positive (215.1 mg/kg), one near the cutoff (123.0 mg/kg),
one in the indeterminate rage (62.2 mg/kg) and one negative (22.1 mg/kg). Interfering
compounds were spiked into every specimen in 10% of total specimen volume, and
the resulting samples were assessed in triplicates with the QUANTA Flash
Calprotectin assay. Stool samples were tested for potential interference by:
Microorganisms: The data demonstrate that the results of the QUANTA Flash®
Calprotectin was not affected by Yersinia ruckeri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella
sonnei, Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli at 1.5x107 cfu/mL for each
individual bacterial culture.
Drugs, Antibiotics, and Nutrients: The data demonstrate that the results of the
QUANTA Flash® Calprotectin was not affected by the following oral
pharmaceuticals: mesalamine (1.33 mg/50 mg stool), prednisone (0.01 mg/50 mg
stool), vancomycin (0.67 mg/50 mg stool), gamma‐tocopherol (0.0010 mg/50 mg
stool), tacrolimus (0.07 mg/50 mg stool), beta‐carotene (0.0048 mg/50 mg stool),
ciprofloxacin (0.50 mg/50 mg stool), cholecalciferol (0.275 ng/50 mg stool),
lansoprazole (lansoprazole 0.02 mg/50 mg stool), and ascorbic acid (0.05 mg/50 mg
stool).
Others: The results demonstrate that the results of the QUANTA Flash® Calprotectin
was not affected by the addition of Hemoglobin into the stool samples at
5.56mg/50mg stool.
