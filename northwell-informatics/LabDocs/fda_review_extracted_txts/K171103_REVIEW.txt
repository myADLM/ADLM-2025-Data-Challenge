L. Test Principle:
Lumipulse G TSH-III is an assay system for the quantitative measurement of TSH in serum
specimens based on CLEIA technology by a two-step sandwich immunoassay method on the
LUMIPULSE G1200 System. TSH in specimens specifically binds to mouse anti-human
TSH monoclonal antibody on the particles, and antigen-antibody immunocomplexes are
formed. The particles are washed and rinsed to remove unbound materials.

--- Page 4 ---
Alkaline phosphatase-labeled mouse anti-human TSH monoclonal antibody specifically
binds to TSH of the immunocomplexes on the particles, and additional immunocomplexes
are formed. The particles are washed and rinsed to remove unbound materials. Substrate
solution is added and mixed with the particles. AMPPD (3-(2'-spiroadamantane)-4-methoxy-
4-(3"-phosphoryloxy) phenyl-1, 2-dioxetane disodium salt) contained in the substrate
solution is dephosphorylated by the catalysis of alkaline phosphatase indirectly conjugated to
particles. Luminescence (at a maximum wavelength of 477 nm) is generated by the cleavage
reaction of dephosphorylated AMPPD. The luminescent signal is proportional to the amount
of TSH.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Five panels (4 native serum pools and one spiked serum pool) were each assayed over
20 days, in duplicate, two runs per day, for a total of 80 results per sample. A multi-
site precision study was also conducted using four serum panels at three additional
sites, where the panels were run in triplicate, twice per day, for five days. Lot-to-lot
precision studies for three paired reagent and calibrators lots were also performed at
one site using four serum panels tested in triplicate, two runs per day, for five days.
All lots of reagents and the multi-site precision study yielded similar results.
The results of the 20-day precision study are shown in the table below (n = 80 for
each panel):

A high TSH serum pool was created using native samples with known high TSH
values. The high TSH serum pool was serially diluted with a low sample TSH pool
that was created by ultrafiltration of charcoal adsorbed human serum to create 14
TSH serum pools. All 14 TSH serum pools were assayed four times.

The linear regression equation obtained was:
y = 1.03(x) + 0.001; R2 = 0.9962
The linearity study supports the claimed measuring range of 0.02 to 100 µIU/mL.
Dilution Recovery
Verification studies were performed to determine the sample recovery after a 1:10
dilution is performed either manually or automatically by the LUMIPULSE G1200
system. Several serum samples were spiked with TSH WHO International Standard to
target values up to 900 µIU/mL. Each sample was diluted 1:10 manually and onboard
the LUMIPULSE G1200 system with the Lumipulse G Specimen Diluent 1. All
samples were run in triplicate. The average percent differences for the diluted sample
versus the expected concentration was within 10%. The dilution study results support
the sponsor’s labeling claims that samples with TSH concentrations above the 100
µIU/mL may be diluted 1:10 either manually or on-onboard the analyzer to obtain
results up to 1000 µIU/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Lumipulse G TSH-III calibrators are prepared gravimetrically and are traceable
to in-house reference calibrators, whose values have been assigned to the 3rd
International Standard, 2003 (code: 81/565) provided by the National Institute for
Biological Standards and Control.

Reagent Stability:
The shelf life for the Lumipulse G TSH-III Immunoreaction Cartridges is 12 months
at 2 -10 °C, and can be stored on-board the LUMIPULSE G1200 System for a
maximum of 30 days. The shelf-life stability protocols and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank:
Two panels of zero analyte serum were created by ultrafiltration of charcoal adsorbed
human serum. The panels were tested in duplicate using two LUMIPULSE G1200
Instruments and two reagent lots over 15 testing days (n = 60 for each panel and lot
combination). The limit of blank was estimated by the 95th percentile of 60 values for
each lot. The limit of blank was determined to be 0.001 µIU/mL.
Limit of Detection:
Lumipulse G TSH-III Calibrator 2 Solution Stock was diluted with ultrafiltration
charcoal adsorbed human serum to create eight low-level TSH serum pools. Samples
were tested using two reagent lots over 15 days of testing (n = 60 for each panel and
lot combination). The limit of detection was determined to be 0.002 µIU/mL.
Limit of Quantitation:
The limit of quantitation was determined using eight low-level TSH serum pools. The
limit of quantitation was defined as the value at which the between run CV is 20%,
and determined to be 0.006 µIU/mL.
The claimed measuring range is 0.02 - 100 µIU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was conducted to evaluate the effect of endogenous
interference substances using the Lumipulse G TSH-III on the LUMIPULSE G1200
system. Three native serum pools containing low (0.5 µIU/mL), medium (2-3
µIU/mL), and high concentrations (66-72 µIU/mL) of TSH were tested by spiking
with potential interferents or an equivalent volume of diluent. A significant difference
was defined as greater than 10% different in the test and control serum pools.

determined by comparing values obtained from samples spiked with drugs into three
native human serum pools and tested with the Lumipulse G TSH-III on the
LUMIPULSE G1200 system. The TSH analyte concentrations of the three serum
pools were approximately 0.5 µIU/mL, 2 - 3 µIU/mL, and 66 - 72 µIU/mL. The

Cross-reactivity:
A cross-reactivity study was conducted according to CLSI-EP7-A2 to evaluate the
potential cross-reactivity of the assay. Potential cross-reactants were added into test
pools, and an equivalent volume of diluent added to control pools. Cross-reactivity
was calculated as follows:
% cross-reactivity = [(mean concentration of spiked sample - mean concentration of
unspiked sample) / spiked concentration] x 100
The following potentially cross-reacting compounds at the indicated concentrations,
tested with TSH concentrations of approximately 0.5 µIU/mL, 2 - 3 µIU/mL, and 66 -
72 µIU/mL, did not interfere with the performance of the device.
Potential Cross-
Concentration Tested
Reactant
FSH 5000 mIU/mL
hCG 200000 mIU/mL
hGH 100 ng/mL
LH 1000 mIU/mL
Human Anti-Mouse Antibodies:
To determine the susceptibility of Lumipulse G TSH-III to potential human anti-
mouse antibody (HAMA) interference, three native serum pools with low, medium,
and high TSH values were spiked with HAMA to a target of 1268 ng/mL or an
equivalent volume of diluent. Three replicates of each test and control serum pool
were tested. No HAMA interference at a concentration up to 1268 ng/mL was
observed.
High Dose Hook Effect:
To determine any hook effect, TSH was spiked into a low TSH serum pool to create
target TSH concentrations of at least 5000 µIU/mL. The signal levels of individual
replicates of all samples with mean concentrations greater than 100 µIU/mL, up to
5000 µIU/mL of TSH, were higher than signal responses at 100 µIU/mL. The sponsor
concluded there was no high dose hook effect when samples up to 5000 µIU/mL were
assayed.
