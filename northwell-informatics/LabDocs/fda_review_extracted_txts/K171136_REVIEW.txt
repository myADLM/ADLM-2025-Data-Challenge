L. Test Principle:
The method employs a combination of monoclonal-dye conjugate and polyclonal-solid phase
antibodies to selectively identify hCG in the test samples. The Lia Pregnancy Test is a lateral
flow chromatographic immunoassay. When a mid-stream urine sample is applied to the
absorbent end, the sample enters the device by capillary action and mixes with the antibody-
dye conjugate, flowing across the pre-coated membrane. During the test, hCG in the urine
specimen reacts with the dye conjugate and forms a complex. The complex migrates along
the cellulose strip to the α-hCG antibody line (T), and remains captured in the T line. As a
result, a red colored band develops in the T line, indicating a positive result. If there is no
hCG in the urine, there is no red band in the test zone, indicating a negative result. The
control line develops in the Control (C) zone regardless of the result.

Cross reactivity:
To determine if structurally similar analytes to hCG would interfere with test results,
three glycoprotein hormones were analyzed: Luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-
stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Negative and
positive hCG urine samples (50 mIU/mL) were spiked with different levels of
hormones; LH: 500 mIU/mL, FSH: 1000 mIU/mL, and TSH: 1000 µIU/mL. Results
demonstrated no interference from LH, FSH and TSH at the concentrations tested.
Interference:
A study was conducted to evaluate interference of specific exogenous compounds.
Negative and positive hCG urine samples (25 mIU/mL) were individually spiked with
the substances listed in the table below. One replicate/lot, 3 lots of devices were
tested. No interference was observed from the compounds at the concentrations listed
below.

A study was conducted, using 3 lots of devices, to evaluate the effect of pH and
specific gravity of urine specimens. Negative and positive hCG urine samples (0
mIU/mL, 7 mIU/mL, 22mIU/mL, and 38 mIU/mL) were tested across a pH range of
4.58-8.57 and specific gravity range of 1.003-1.036. No interference was observed in
samples from the pH ranges of 4.56-8.87 and specific gravity ranges of 1.003-1.036.
High Dose /Hook effect:
The sponsor completed testing, using 3 lots of devices, with urine samples containing
high concentrations of hCG to determine if high hCG concentrations would cause
false negative results. Negative urine samples were spiked with hCG to achieve
concentrations of 2.5, 25, 100, 150, 500 IU/mL. The test results demonstrated no
hook effect at hCG concentrations up to 500 IU/mL.
hCG β-core fragment test:
To evaluate hook effects of the hCG β-core fragment, negative (0 mIU/mL) and
positive hCG urine samples (250 IU/mL) were spiked with β-core hCG fragment
standard (traceable to WHO reference reagent 99/708) at concentrations up to
500,000 pmol/L. Each spiked urine sample was tested using 3 lots of devices. The
results demonstrated that no hook effect was observed at an hCG β-core fragment
concentration up to 500,000 pmol/L.
hCG β-core fragment testing also demonstrated that hCG β-core fragment
concentrations above 1,000 pmol/L produce positive results with the Lia Pregnancy
Test.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A lay-user study was conducted with 159 female participants, ages 18-49 years, who
tested their own urine on the Lia Pregnancy Test following instructions in the
package insert. The Lia Pregnancy Test result recorded by each lay user was
compared to the result obtained by professional interpretation of each lay user’s
device. In addition, a matching fresh urine specimen from each participant was
collected in a cup and tested by health care professionals using the predicate device,
and the results from this test were compared to the corresponding lay user’s result.
Following the instructions for use, 153 lay users successfully recorded positive or
negative results from the device, 5 lay users obtained invalid results, and 1 participant
did not complete the study.
The following table is a summary of the lay user results obtained with the Lia
Pregnancy Test compared to the results obtained by professionals interpreting the

The sponsor conducted a post-test questionnaire, where 98% of users said that the
printed instructions were clear and usable, 91 % of subjects were confident that they
had performed the test correctly, and 98% said it was easy to use the device.
