2
on the standard Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (using the measured pCO and pH values);
2
this test is metrologically traceable to the IFCC TCO reference method. The test card is
2
inserted into the epoc Reader and all analytical steps are performed automatically. The epoc
Blood Analysis System is an in vitro diagnostic device system for the quantitative testing of
blood gases, electrolytes, and metabolites in venous, arterial, and capillary whole blood
samples. The epoc System is comprised of 3 major subsystems: epoc Host, epoc Reader and
epoc BGEM Test Card. The main accessory used with the epoc System includes the epoc
Care-Fill Capillary Tubes used to collect and introduce capillary blood samples into the epoc
Test Card.

L. Test Principle:
Urea Nitrogen (BUN) Sensor
The sensor module consists of an epoxy foil supporting array of foil electrode contacts on the
outer side (or contact surface) and an array of sensor membranes on the inner side (or sensor
surface). The epoc BUN electrode design is an enzymatic potentiometric-based sensing
device. The BUN electrode uses the enzyme urease to hydrolyze urea to ammonium ions, as
follows:
Urea + H O + 2H+ + Urease → 2NH + + CO
2 4 2
A potentiometric ion-selective electrode then detects the enzymatically-produced
ammonium ion. The sensor is designed as a two-layer device, each layer providing the
functions described above. The concentration of ammonium ions is obtained from the
measured potential using the Nernst equation.

Total Carbon Dioxide
The epoc System calculates total carbon dioxide using the measured and
reported values of pH and pCO2 according to the standard Henderson-Hasselbalch
equation:
Calculated TCO (cTCO ) = cHCO - + 0.0307 x pCO
2 2 3 2
where: LOG cHCO - = pH + LOG pCO – 7.608
3 2
This calculated TCO (cTCO ) value is metrologically traceable to the epoc pH and pCO
2 2 2
measurements, which are in turn traceable to primary standard reference materials for
pH and pCO .
2
The measured TCO is achieved by calibrating a function of pH and pCO
2 2
against the accepted IFCC Reference Measurement Procedure for Total Carbon Dioxide
by mathematically modifying the calculated TCO equation in order to match the IFCC
2
reference values. Hence, the measured TCO will be metrologically traceable to the IFCC
2
TCO reference method.

For TCO

The pCO2-pH (and hence the HCO-) the stability in the calibration fluid as part of the
epoc test card was previously cleared under k061597.
d. Detection limit:
The study was performed as per the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. Test samples were
prepared from whole blood using lithium heparin anticoagulant. 4 blank and 4 low
concentration samples were each prepared separately for BUN and TCO . Each
2
sample was tested using two epoc BGEM Test Cards lots over 3 days.
A minimum of 64 replicates of measurements (16 replicates x 4 samples) per lot were
used to calculate the LoB, LoD, and LoQ of BUN. For TCO , a minimum of 60
2
replicates of measurements per lot were used (15 replicates x 4 samples). The LoB
was calculated as the 95th percentile using the nonparametric method and a risk level,
β, of 0.05. The LoD was evaluated from the lowest analyte level that had at least 95%
of the replicates greater than the LoB. The limit of quantitation was determined
according to accuracy goal based on total error (TE); for BUN the TE accuracy goal
was 2 mg/dL and for TCO of 4mmol/L. The results of the detection limits study are
2
summarized below:
Analyte LoB LoD LoQ Claimed Range
BUN(mg/dL) 2 3 3 3 -120
TCO (mmol/L) 4 4.3 4.3 5 - 50
2
e. Analytical specificity:
An interferent testing of the BUN and TCO measurements on the epoc Blood
2
Analysis System was performed per the CLSI EP07-A2 guideline. Potential
interferences were evaluated at BUN concentrations of 8 and 20 mg/dL and TCO
2
concentrations of 20 and 35 mmol/L. In each of these tests, human specimens were
aliquoted into 2 samples. The test samples were spiked with interferent, while the
control samples were spiked with the solvent of the interferent. The bias between the
control sample and the test sample with added interferent was calculated. The
concentration of interfering substance considered as causing no clinically significant
interference is defined as a bias (difference between the test and the control sample)
of: 1.77 mg/dL for BUN; 3.32 mmol/L for TCO concentrations ≤20 mmol/L and
2
2.95 mmol/L for TCO concentrations >20 mmol/L.

Clinically significant interfering substances for BUN measurements are itemized
below:
· Samples contaminated with benzalkonium salts used as coatings for in-dwelling
lines may cause elevated BUN results. For proper line-flushing procedures refer
to CLSI H11-A4.
· Citrate will have no significant effect up to 6.0 mmol/L (176.5 mg/dL) after
which it will decrease the BUN concentration by up to 0.26 mg/dL BUN per
mmol/L citrate.
· EDTA will have no significant effect up to 4.5 mmol/L (167 mg/dL) after which
it will decrease the BUN concentration by up to 0.43 mg/dL BUN per mmol/L
EDTA.
· Glutathione reduced will have no significant effect up to 1.7 mmol/L (52.2
mg/dL), after which it will increase the BUN concentration by up to 1.91 mg/dL
BUN per mmol/L glutathione reduced. Blood glutathione (GSH) in human
subjects is ~0.79-1.05 mmol/L. Long term oral glutathione reduced
supplementation (250-1,000 mg/day administered for 6 months) increases
glutathione plasma levels by ~0.2-8 μmol/L (~0.01-0.25 mg/dL). Short-term, oral
intake of glutathione reduced does not affect plasma glutathione levels.
· β-Hydroxybutyrate will have no significant effect up to 17.2 mmol/L (216.9
mg/dL), after which it will decrease the BUN concentration by up to 0.11 mg/dL
BUN per mmol/L hydroxybutyrate. The reference range for β-hydroxybutyrate in
plasma is <0.4 to 0.5 mmol/L. β-hydroxybutyrate concentration over 3 mmol/L
are indicative of ketoacidosis; in very severe diabetic ketoacidosis the
concentration may exceed 25 mmol/L.
· Hydroxyurea will have no significant effect up to 1.3 mmol/L (9.9 mg/dL), after
which it will increase the BUN concentration by up to 1.61 mg/dL BUN per
mmol/L hydroxyurea. The recommended dose of hydroxyurea for patients range
from 15 mg/kg/day to 30 mg/kg/day. A treatment dose of 2,000 mg/day
(~30mg/kg) results in maximum plasma concentration of ~800μmol/L with oral
administration and ~1 mmol/L with intravenous method.

· N-acetylcysteine will have no significant effect up to 9.2 mmol/L (150.1 mg/dL),
after which it will increase the BUN concentration by up to 0.11 mg/dL BUN per
mmol/L N-acetylcysteine. It has been reported that 1 mmol/L N-acetyl cysteine is
therapeutically unattainable in plasma. The therapeutic level for N-acetyl cysteine
is 0.3 mmol/L.
· Nithiodote will have no significant effect up to 4.1 mmol/L (64.8 mg/dL) after
which it will decrease the BUN concentration by up to 0.41 mg/dL BUN per
mmol/L Nithiodote. The expected peak sodium thiosulfate plasma concentration
following a 12.5 g of Nithiodote is 16.7 mmol/L.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed at 3 POC sites by POC operators.
Lithium heparin venous and arterial whole blood samples and fresh capillary whole
blood samples were analyzed for BUN using the epoc Blood Analysis System
(candidate device) and compared to matched lithium heparin plasma samples
analyzed using BUN assay on the Roche Cobas 8000 Modular Analyzer. Lithium
heparin venous and arterial whole blood samples and fresh capillary whole blood
samples were analyzed for TCO using the epoc Blood Analysis System (candidate
2
device) and the i-STAT CHEM8+/i-STAT system (predicate device). The results of
the overall performance of the device at all the sites are summarized in the tables
below.

b. Matrix comparison:
A comparison was performed to demonstrate the equivalence between lithium heparin
whole blood and un-anticoagulated venous whole blood and sodium heparin venous
whole blood for testing BUN and TCO levels. The results of linear regression for
2
heparinized (Na heparin) vs. lithium heparin, and non-anticoagulated venous samples
vs lithium heparin are shown below:
