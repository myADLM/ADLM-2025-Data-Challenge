L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA Centaur TNIH is a 3-site sandwich immunoassay using direct
chemiluminometric technology. The Solid Phase reagent is magnetic latex particles
conjugated with streptavidin with two bound biotinylated capture monoclonal antibodies
each recognizing a unique cardiac troponin I (cTnI) epitope.
The Lite Reagent comprises a conjugate whose architecture consists of a proprietary
acridinium ester and a recombinant anti-human cTnI sheep Fab covalently attached to BSA
for chemiluminescent detection. The accumulated light signal is directly related to the sample
cTnI concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated precision in several studies following the recommendations in
CLSI EP05-A3. The ADVIA Centaur TNIH precision study was performed in a
single-site for 20 days using two instruments, one reagent lot with two readings a day
with native patient samples and samples from AMI patients that were diluted with
native serum or lithium heparin plasma from healthy subjects for a total of 80
replicates per troponin level. Within-lab precision estimate is a total of within-run
variability, within-day run-to-run variability, and day-to-day variability.

Additional precision studies evaluated lot-to-lot imprecision using 3 reagent lots for 6
serum and 4 plasma samples over 20 days on two instruments and provided similar
results to those reported above.
Site-to-site reproducibility was evaluated on the ADVIA Centaur TNIH across 3 sites,
1 lot of reagents, for 5 days with 2 samples a day and 3 replicates a day in accordance
with CLSI EP05-A3. The precision reported in the site-to-site variability study was
similar to the results reported above in the instrument-to-instrument study.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Two linearity studies were performed according to CLSI EP06-A ranging from 0 to
150 pg/mL and 2 to 25,000 pg/mL. High serum and lithium heparin plasma pools
were prepared by diluting native cTnI samples from AMI patients with negative
samples from healthy subjects. Low pools were prepared from negative samples from
healthy subjects. Each dilution series comprised of 9 levels that were prepared by
mixing the high and low pools. The mean was taken from each sample tested in
duplicate. Test results did not deviate from linearity by more than 10%.

Representative results for weighted linear regression are shown below:
Li Hep Plasma
y = 1.016x - 0.028 pg/mL
Serum
y = 0.943x + 0.339 pg/mL
The measuring range is 2.5-25000 pg/mL with the upper end of the measuring range
being defined by the linear range of the assay. See detection limits in M. item d.
below for information supporting the lower end of the measuring range.
Hook Effect:
A study was performed to evaluate hook effect. There was no hook effect with the
ADVIA Centaur TNIH assay up to 611,899 pg/mL in lithium heparin plasma and up
to 578,452 pg/mL in serum.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The sponsor’s traceability scheme was reviewed and found acceptable. The Centaur
hs-TnI primary standards are traceable to a commercially available troponin assay.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) Test Protocol
Limit of Blank was determined for the ADVIA Centaur TNIH assay as described in
CLSI Guideline EP17-A2. Testing was performed using three lots of ADVIA Centaur
TNIH reagents, each on one ADVIA Centaur XP instrument. 240 determinations per
matrix per lot were obtained by testing four serum negative basepools or four lithium
heparin plasma negative basepools in twenty replicates a day for three days. LoB was
calculated non-parametrically. The largest estimate across all reagent lot-matrix-
instrument combinations tested was taken as the LoB estimate for the measurement
procedure
Limit of Detection (LoD) Test Protocol
Limit of Detection studies were performed using 3 lots of ADVIA Centaur TNIH
reagents, each on two ADVIA Centaur XP instruments. 640 determinations per
matrix per lot were obtained by testing four low analyte serum samples or four low
analyte lithium heparin plasma samples on two instruments in two replicates in two
runs each day for twenty days.
The Limit of Detection was determined as the dose at which 95% of the
measurements would be greater than the LoB. The largest estimate across all reagent
6

--- Page 7 ---
lot-matrix-instrument combinations tested was taken as the LoD estimate for the
measurement procedure.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) Protocol
Six low troponin lithium heparin plasma pools and seven low troponin serum pools
across three lots and two instruments were used in these studies.
For each reagent lot, the within-laboratory precision over twenty consecutive
working days for each sample, expressed as %CV, was plotted against the mean
concentration obtained for each sample. LoQ was determined by this precision
profile as the concentration where the %CV was less than 20%. The largest estimate
across all reagent lot-matrix-instrument combinations tested was taken as the LoQ
estimate for the measurement procedure.
The sponsor claims an LoB of 0.50 pg/mL, an LoD of 1.60 pg/mL, and an LoQ of
2.50 pg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A2. Two
sample pools per matrix were tested. One sample pool had 20-60 pg/mL cTnI. The
second sample pool had 1000-2000 pg/mL cTnI. These sample pools were spiked
with potential interferents. Control samples were prepared by spiking sample pools
with the appropriate diluent at the same volume as the interfering substance stock.
Test results from samples spiked with the potential interferent were compared to test
results from the control samples. At the tested concentrations, these compounds
caused <10% interference on the ADVIA Centaur TNIH assay.

percentile (i.e. 30-100 pg/mL). A total of three serum and three lithium heparin
plasma samples were used in this study. The high RF (1100 IU/mL) sample and the
high HAMA (~200 ng/mL) sample were spiked into serum and lithium heparin
plasma samples. Interference was <10% using the ADVIA Centaur TNIH assay at all
combinations of HAMA/RF and troponin tested.
Therapeutic drug interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A2.
Two sample pools per matrix were tested. One sample pool had 20-60 pg/mL cTnI.
The second sample pool had 1000-2000 pg/mL cTnI. These sample pools were spiked
with potential interferents at low and high levels. Control samples were prepared by
spiking sample pools with the appropriate diluent at the same volume as the
interfering substance stock. At the tested concentrations, all drugs caused <10%
interference on the ADVIA Centaur TNIH assay.

Specimens from some individuals with pathologically high gamma globulin levels
may demonstrate depressed troponin values. Additional information may be required
for diagnosis.
Heterophilic antibodies and rheumatoid factor in human serum can react with reagent
immunoglobulins, interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely exposed
to animals or to animal serum products can be prone to this interference and
anomalous values may be observed. Additional information may be required for
diagnosis.
Samples from patients receiving preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies for
therapy or diagnosis may contain human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA). Such
samples may show either falsely elevated or falsely depressed values when tested
with this method.
An unknown interference was observed in analytical spiking and dilution studies
causing negative bias that may affect interpretation of patient results. The unknown
interference may be due to the presence of troponin autoantibodies, which have been
reported in up to 10% of patients with or without AMI and up to 20% of patients
positive for rheumatoid factor. If the cTnI result is below the 99th percentile value at
the first blood draw, at least two additional blood samples should be drawn before
results are interpreted as negative for AMI.

below). A multicenter prospective study enrolled 2495 patients from Emergency
10

--- Page 11 ---
Departments presenting with chest pain or equivalent ischemic symptoms suggestive
of Acute Coronary Syndromes. Final diagnoses were adjudicated by an independent
panel of expert physicians using criteria consistent with the 2007 Universal Definition
of Myocardial Infarction (MI). Serial samples were collected from patients within 24
hours of presentation to the Emergency Department. The number of patients
adjudicated with an MI was 13% (329/2495). The sample collection times were at 0 –
1.5 hours from time since presentation) and at the following timepoint relative to the
time from presentation: 1.5 to 2.5 hours, 2.5 to 3.5 hours, 3.5 to 4.5 hours, 4.5 to 6
hours, 6 to 9 hours, 9 to 24 hours, and greater than 24 hours after presentation to the
Emergency Department. Investigators and adjudicators were blinded to the proposed
device’s results. Adjudicators were also blinded to site diagnoses. All results
presented below were based on the adjudicated diagnoses. Clinical performance was
estimated at overall (male and female combined across both matrices) and male- and
female-specific 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) cut-offs for each matrix
type, calculated as described in Section 5, Expected values/reference Range, below.
The results are summarized below.

The following statements about cutoffs are included in the labeling:
“Using the higher male-specific 99th percentiles instead of the overall 99th percentile
of 47.34 pg/mL (ng/L) may result in a higher proportion of negative test results for
males that are MI. For males that are MI, data analyzed using the male-specific cutoff
versus the overall cutoff increased the false-negative rate by up to 2.9%.”
“Using the lower female-specific 99th percentiles instead of the overall 99th
percentile of 47.34 pg/mL (ng/L) may result in a higher proportion of positive test
results for females that are non-MI. Taking into consideration the lower bound of the
95% confidence interval, in the worst-case scenario (lithium-heparin plasma drawn at
≥4.5-<6 hours after presentation) up to 71% of positive test results for females may
be non-MI.”
b. Clinical specificity:
See section M.3.a., Clinical sensitivity, above.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
The cut-offs for this assay were determined based on the 99th percentile upper reference
limit in apparently healthy adults. Please see section 5, Expected values/Reference range,
below for the determination of the clinical cut-offs.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor conducted a multicenter prospective study to establish the 99th percentile in a
population of apparently health adults with no known diseases of the cardiovascular
system or other serious acute or chronic diseases or infections. Serum and lithium-
heparin plasma specimens were collected from 1990 apparently health adults with no
known diseases of the cardiovascular system or other serious acute or chronic diseases or
infections from the United States who ranged in age from 22–91 years of age.

Both male and female subjects were included in the reference range study to determine
the 99th percentile URL using a non-parametric empirical univariate distribution function.
Results are as follows:
99th Percentile Upper Reference Limit
in pg/mL
Population N
Lithium Heparin Serum
Plasma
Females 1006 36.99 pg/mL 39.59 pg/mL
Males 984 57.27 pg/mL 58.05 pg/mL
Overall (males and females combined) 1990 47.34 pg/mL 46.47 pg/mL
Two female subjects had troponin values of approximately 400 pg/mL and 5000 pg/mL
and were considered to be outliers. These results were not included in the 99th percentile
determination. The sponsor demonstrated that the change in the cut-off values (either for
women or overall) were not impacted by this exclusion.
Overall (combination of all cut-offs for both serum and plasma): 47.34 pg/mL
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
