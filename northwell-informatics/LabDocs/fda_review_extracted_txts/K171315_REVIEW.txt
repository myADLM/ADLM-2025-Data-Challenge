K171315
B. Purpose for Submission:
Seeking clearance for Advanced RBC Application, an optional software module delivered
with the CellaVision DM96 and DM1200 systems
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
CellaVision AB; CellaVision DM96 and DM1200 with Advanced RBC Application
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
White blood cell (WBC) differential, red blood cell (RBC) characterization, and platelet
estimation
E. System Descriptions:
1. DeviceDescription:
CellaVision DM96 and DM1200 Systems
The CellaVision DM96 and DM1200 (hereafter DM systems) both consist of a slide
scanning unit (SSU) and a computer system. The SSU consists of a microscope, camera
and a slide feeder unit; whereas the computer system contains the acquisition and
classification software–CellaVision DM Software (CDMS). The DM96 and DM1200
perform the following functionalities:
· Scan a user-defined area on a slide
· Locate and present images of every located cell or object found on the smear
· Store images and results in a database
· Present an overview image of a user-defined area on a slide
· Create digital slides
Advanced RBC Application
The Advanced RBC Application is an optional software module of the CellaVision DM
Software (CDMS) that replaces the existing (standard) RBC functionality of the
CellaVision DM Software installed on the CellaVision DM96 and DM1200. General
functionality of the Advanced RBC Application includes:
1

--- Page 2 ---
· Present and suggest 21 morphological characteristics in an overview image of red
blood cells on a screen
· Allow operators to confirm or modify the pre-characterization of the red blood
cell morphology
· Organize, present, and suggest a morphology for every individual red blood cell
image on a screen
· Allow operators to confirm or modify the suggested classification of the red blood
cells
The results for the red blood cells (RBCs) are presented as absolute cell counts and
proportional counts and classified according to the user-predefined 4-grade scale for each
morphological characteristic.
The major difference between the standard RBC functionality and the Advanced RBC
Application is that the Advanced RBC Application pre-characterizes RBCs based on size,
color, shape, and inclusion using trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into 21
morphological characteristics whereas the standard RBC functionality pre-characterizes
into six morphological characteristics and does not have trained artificial neural networks
(ANNs). Additionally, with the Advanced RBC Application, pre-characterized RBCs are
displayed individually and in an overview screen image whereas the standard RBC
functionality displays an overview screen image only.
2. Principles of Operation:
Patient blood smears are wedged and stained outside the device on standard rectangular
glass slides by standardized staining methods provided in the labeling. Prepared slides
are coded with a barcode label and placed in a barcode-labeled magazine, which is then
loaded into the DM system. The DM system identifies the barcode on the magazines and
the slides. The DM system requests order information from the Laboratory Information
System, using the slide barcode information. If the DM System cannot communicate
with the LIS, it defines the type of analysis from the information given by the barcode on
the magazine and the predefined analysis settings. When a red blood cell image is
ordered, an overview image is captured. The Advanced RBC Application pre-
characterizes the RBCs into 21 different morphological characteristics and calculates the
relative percentage of distribution for each characteristic. Based on the relative
percentages, a grade (0–3) is suggested for each characteristic. The operator views the
overview or a panel of individual cell images and either verifies the results or performs a
manual re-characterization. The operator can also re-characterize each cell into 10
different user defined morphology characteristics. The operator also has the capability of
viewing the cells automatically excluded from analysis. A summary of the red blood cell
analysis is presented. The operator signs the slide result with user name and password.
The results can be sent to the LIS and/or be printed.

Statistical Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests, March
13, 2007
J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
Method comparison studies were performed at five clinical sites including two U.S. sites
and three sites outside the U.S. The Advanced RBC Application on CellaVision DM96
and CellaVision DM1200 was compared with manual microscopy (reference method)
and results from automated differential cell counters. An automated differential cell
counter was used at four of the five clinical sites to characterize the RBC size (i.e.,
macrocytes, microcytes, or anisocytosis). At three of the five sites both the automated
differential cell counter and manual microscopy were used for the comparison study. At
the remaining two sites, one site used manual microscopy as the comparison method and
the other site used the cell counter method as the comparison method to evaluate group
size. For one of the five sites, an expert operator reviewed all images and then judged the
morphology for each class by overriding (or confirming) the suggested grading. The
results for the remaining sites were achieved by re-characterization of individual cell
images into appropriate cell characteristics, thereby altering the suggested grading. At
each study site, venous whole blood was collected in K EDTA Vacutainer tubes. From
3
each sample one slide was prepared. A total of 1598 samples were collected and tested
for RBC characterization on DM96 and DM1200 at five different laboratories. The study
population consisted of 47.3% males and 52.4% females including pediatric (i.e.
neonates, infants, children, and adolescents) and adult subjects up to 101 years of age.
The gender for 0.3% of the study population (5 samples) was reported as unknown. In
addition to healthy individuals, subjects with the following clinical conditions were
included in the studies: iron deficiency anemia, thalassemia, megaloblastic anemia,
myelodysplastic syndrome (including sideroblastic anemia and myelofibrosis), hemolytic
anemia, sickle cell anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombotic
microangiopathy (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura , hemolytic uremic syndrome ),
post-splenectomy and malaria.
The evaluation was divided into two parts, a primary evaluation at group level and a
secondary evaluation for individual morphologies. The secondary evaluation was in turn
divided into two sub-levels as described below:
· Primary evaluation of the groups color, size, shape and inclusions
· Secondary evaluation of individual morphologies:
Ø Part 1: Evaluation of the group of clinically significant morphologies and
parasites: schistocytes (+helmet cells), target cells, sickle cells, tear drop cells
and parasites.
Ø Part 2: Evaluation of the remaining individual morphologies: polychromatic
cells, hypochromatic cells, anisocytosis, microcytes, macrocytes,

To determine agreement between the Advanced RBC Application and manual
microscopy reference method, the efficiency, analytical sensitivity and analytical
specificity were calculated along with the 95% confidence intervals for color, size and
shape. Comparison between the DM system with Advanced RBC Application and the
automated differential cell counter method for size was provided as overall agreement,
positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) along with the
95% confidence interval. The results met the predefined acceptance criteria.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision performance using the Advanced RBC Application on CellaVision DM96
and CellaVision DM1200 was evaluated by performing repeatability and
reproducibility studies across three clinical laboratories.
Repeatability
The repeatability study was performed at three clinical laboratories. The samples
included both normal and elevated levels for each of the 21 RBC morphological
characteristics included in the Advanced RBC Application. At two of the three sites,
six samples were run on DM96 and seven samples were run on DM1200,
respectively. At the third site, seven samples were run on DM96 and eight samples

were run on DM1200. From each sample, two slides were prepared as replicates.
Slides were run two times a day with two replicates per run for 20 days on both
DM96 and DM1200. The study was designed to provide repeatability data for both
qualitative results (e.g. grade 0, 1, 2 and 3) and quantitative results (e.g. proportional
count) for each morphological characteristic. The grading agreement was calculated
for each slide and for each sample by determining the relation between the occurrence
of true grade and the total number of runs for each morphological characteristic. The
results met the predefined acceptance criteria. Representative data from one site is
presented below.

Reproducibility
The reproducibility study was performed at three sites with samples collected from
routine workflow that included normal and elevated levels for each of the 21 RBC
morphological characteristics. From each sample, three slides were prepared. The slides
were then run at each site two times a day for 5 days. Seven blood samples were used for
the DM96 study and five samples were used for the DM1200 study. The grading
reproducibility was calculated by determining the relation between the occurrence of true
grade and the total number of runs. The results met the predefined acceptance criteria.

characteristics obtained with the Advanced RBC Application using CellaVision
