L. Test Principle:
ELITech Clinical Systems BILIRUBIN TOTAL 4+1:
Sulphanilic acid reacts with sodium nitrite to form diazotized sulphanilic acid. In the
presence of accelerator (cetrimide), conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin react with
diazotized sulphanilic acid to form azobilirubin. The increase of absorbance at 546 nm is
proportional to the total bilirubin concentration.
ELITech Clinical Systems BILIRUBIN DIRECT 4+1:
Sulphanilic acid reacts with sodium nitrite to form diazotized sulphanilic acid. In the
absence of accelerator (cetrimide), only conjugated bilirubin reacts with diazoted sulphanilic
acid to form azobilirubin. The increase of absorbance at 546 nm is proportional to the direct
bilirubin concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated using one serum control material, one human serum pool,
and one spiked human serum pool sample. Within-run and total imprecision results
were obtained by performing two runs per day, two measures per run, for 3
concentrations of samples on two instruments for twenty days. The results are
presented in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
ELITech Clinical Systems BILIRUBIN TOTAL 4+1:
The linearity of total bilirubin was studied by mixing a patient serum pool sample
with a high bilirubin value (25.13 mg/dL) and a sample with low value (0.25 mg/dL)
to obtain 11 levels with equidistant concentration, and then measuring the total
bilirubin concentration of each of the 11 levels. All samples were assayed in
triplicates. Data was analyzed using 1st, 2nd and 3rd order least square regressions.
A first order linear regression was generated as follows:
y = 1.1067x – 0.2378, r = 0.9994
The results of the study support the measuring range of 0.25 to 25.0 mg/dL.
A study evaluating the 1:5 auto-dilution used several spiked samples with total
bilirubin concentrations between 32.80 to 115.66 mg/dL. The % recovery between the
expected value and observed values were within 10% for samples with total bilirubin
concentrations up to 60.00 mg/dL. Therefore the sponsor claimed that samples with
total bilirubin concentration greater than the assay claimed measuring range and up to
60.00 mg/dL can be auto-diluted and assayed.
ELITech Clinical Systems BILIRUBIN DIRECT 4+1:
The linearity of direct bilirubin was studied by mixing a sample with high value
(10.59 mg/dL) and a sample with low value (0.06 mg/dL) to obtain 11 levels with
equidistant concentrations and then measuring the direct bilirubin concentration of
each of the 11 levels. Data was analyzed using 1st, 2nd and 3rd order least square
regressions. A first order linear regression was generated as follows:
y = 1.0943x – 0.2244, r = 0.9995
The results of the study support the measuring range of 0.08 to 10.55 mg/dL.
A study evaluating the 1:5 auto-dilution study using several spiked samples with
direct bilirubin concentrations between 10.86 and 47.49 mg/dL. The % recovery
between the expected value and observed values were within 10%. Therefore the
sponsor claimed that sample with total bilirubin concentration greater than the assay
claimed measuring range and up to 50.00 mg/dL can be auto-diluted and assayed.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The calibrator for the assay is ELITech Clinical Systems ELICAL 2 (cleared in
k110780).
5

--- Page 6 ---
Controls recommended for the assay are ELITROL I and ELITROL II (cleared in
k110780).
Stability:
An On-board stability study was performed for 30 days. Protocols and acceptance
criteria for the stability study were reviewed and found acceptable. The study results
support an on-board stability for 28 days for both total and direct bilirubin reagents.
A real time shelf-life stability study has been performed for 24 months at 2-8ºC.
Protocols and acceptance criteria for the stability study were reviewed and found
acceptable. The study supports a real time stability for both products at 24 months.
d. Detection limit:
The limits of blank (LoB), detection (LoD) and quantitation (LoQ) studies were
conducted on two Selectra Pro Analyzers with two lots of reagents. The LoB was
determined by analyzing a blank sample 60 times. LoD and LoQ studies each used 4
serum pools measured 15 times for both assays for a total of 60 measurements for
each. The serum pools for LoD had concentrations approximately 4 times the LoB.
LoQ was determined by analyzing 4 serum pools with analyte concentrations near the
expected LoQ. Results are summarized below:
Assay LoB LoD LoQ
Total bilirubin 0.01 mg/dL 0.04 mg/dL 0.15 mg/dL
Direct bilirubin 0.00 mg/dL 0.01 mg/dL 0.08 mg/dL
The ELITech Clinical Systems BILIRUBIN TOTAL 4+1 assay has a measuring
range of 0.25 to 25.00 mg/dL.
The ELITech Clinical Systems BILIRUBIN DIRECT 4+1 assay has a measuring
range of 0.08 to 10.55 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Testing for interfering substances was performed on different concentrations for each
interfering substances on both total and direct bilirubin assays. Samples with
increasing amounts of triglycerides, hemoglobin, acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic, and
ascorbic acid were tested in triplicates and compared to the same sample without the
interfering substances. The sponsor defined non-significant interference as the highest
level tested that does not cause > 10% change between the tested samples and the
control sample. Results are summarized in the tables below.
ELITech Clinical Systems BILIRUBIN TOTAL 4+1:
The two levels of serum pool samples with a low and high concentrations of (1.0 and
15.0 mg/dL) of total bilirubin were tested and yielded the following results.

Based on the interference study the following limitations are included in the labeling.
For ELITech Clinical Systems BILIRUBIN TOTAL 4+1:
In very rare cases monoclonal gammapathies (multiple myeloma) in particular IgM
type (Waldenstroms macroglobulinemia) can cause unreliable results.1

clinical chemistry analysis of blood samples containing monoclonal
immunoglobulins: 2 case reports and a review of literature, Acta Clin Belg., (2004),

For ELITech Clinical Systems BILIRUBIN DIRECT 4+1:
Ascorbic acid concentrations greater than 0.5 mg/dL cause falsely elevated total
bilirubin results.
