Refer to Indications for Use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The OralTox Oral Fluid Drug Test is a competitive binding, lateral flow
immunochromatographic assay for qualitative and simultaneous detection of
Amphetamine, Cocaine, Marijuana (THC), Methamphetamine, Opiates and
Phencyclidine, in human oral fluid at the cutoff concentrations listed below:
Test Calibrator Cut-off level
Amphetamine (AMP) d-Amphetamine 50 ng/mL
Cocaine (COC) Benzoylecgonine 20 ng/mL
Cannabinoids (THC) Delta-9 Tetrahydrocannabinol 40 ng/mL
Methamphetamine (MET) d-Methamphetamine 50 ng/mL
Morphine (MOP) Morphine 40 ng/mL
Phencyclidine (PCP) Phencyclidine 10 ng/mL
The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Liquid
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test
result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.
For in vitro diagnostic use only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription point-of-care use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable, as the device is a visually-read single use device.
Device Description:
The OralTox Oral Fluid Drug Test is an immunochromatographic assay that uses a lateral
flow system for the qualitative detection of Amphetamine, cocaine, cannabinoids,
methamphetamine, morphine, phencyclidine (target analytes) in human oral fluid. The
device has a built-in sample collection tool, including collection swab and sponge, as
well as a saturation indicator strip. The saturation indicator strip turns red when a volume
of oral fluid has been collected that is adequate for both the OralTox test and for
confirmation testing at a laboratory if the result is a presumptive positive.
OralTox Oral Fluid Drug Tests tests are the first step in a two-step process. The second
step is to send the sample for confirmatory laboratory testing using a more specific
method (e.g., LC-MS/MS) if preliminary positive results are obtained.

flow system for the qualitative detection of Amphetamine, cocaine, Marijuana,
methamphetamine, morphine, and phencyclidine (target analytes) in human oral fluid. The
tests are lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays, consisting of one test strip per analyte.
During testing, an oral fluid specimen migrates up the test strip by capillary action. If target
drugs present in the oral fluid specimen are below the cut-off concentration, it will not
saturate the binding sites of its specific monoclonal mouse antibody coated on the particles.
The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a
visible colored line will show up in the test line region. The colored line will not form in the
test line region if the target drug level exceeds its cutoff-concentration because it will saturate
all the binding sites of the antibody coated on the particles. A band should form in the control
region of the devices regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the sample to
indicate that the tests have been performed properly.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision-Reproducibility-Cut-Off studies were carried out for samples with
concentrations of -100% cut off, -75% cut off, -50% cut off, -25% cut off, cut off,
+25% cut off, +50% cut off , +75% cut off and +100% cut off. These samples were
prepared by spiking drug in negative oral fluid samples. The sponsor has stated that
each drug concentration was confirmed by LC-MS/MS. All sample aliquots were
blindly labeled by the person who prepared the samples and didn’t take part in the
sample testing. For each concentration, tests were performed two runs per day for 10
days per device lot in a randomized order. The sponsor provided the following
summaries.

Sample Volume:
A sample volume study was conducted to confirm the reproducibility of adequate
sample volume collection by the device. Operators collected samples at two sites
from a total 136 subjects (including drug users) following the device’s instructions for
use. Operators swept the inside of volunteer’s mouth (cheek, gums, and tongue), and
then held the swab in the subject’s mouth until the color indicator within the
collection device indicated that collection was complete.
The sponsor reported that all subjects evaluated were able to provide sufficient
sample (so that the collection device’s color indicator showed adequate collection)
within the recommended seven minute collection timeframe. Mean volume collected
was 2.5 +/- 0.2 mL, and time required for collection was 3.7 +/-1.7 minutes. The
maximum time required for collection was reported as seven minutes, and the
minimum volume collected was 2.2 mL.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. These devices are intended for qualitative use only.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Accelerated stability studies have been conducted for the device. Protocols and
acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer
claims that when stored un-opened at 4-30 º C, the device is stable for 24 months.
Real time studies have been conducted and are ongoing.
Sample Recovery
Sample volume recovery:
A sample volume recovery study was conducted to confirm that adequate sample
volume could be extracted from the device for confirmatory testing after collection
and shipping. Operators collected samples at two sites from a total 194 subjects
(including drug users) following the device’s instructions for use. Devices containing
oral fluid samples were then sent to the confirmation laboratory using overnight
shipping. The sponsor reported that the confirmation lab was able to extract
sufficient sample volume for the confirmation testing of all six analytes for all
samples collected.
Analyte recovery:
To confirm that preliminary positive results can be adequately measured via
confirmation testing after being subject to the temperature conditions required for
shipping and storage, negative oral fluid samples in glass bottles were spiked with a
single analyte/bottle to concentrations approximately -50% and +50% of the cutoff.
Samples were spiked using known standards. Each drug concentration was
confirmed by LC-MS/MS. The samples were transferred to OralTox devices using
the collection sponges. For each of 3 storage conditions (-20°C, 20-25°C, and 40°C),
12 devices were used (4 devices from each of 3 lots). For each device, drug was
measured by LC-MS/MS at time zero and the devices containing the specimens were
stored under the specified condition. Drug in the devices stored at 20-25°C and 40°C
was measured by LC-MS/MS at two (2) days, and drug in the devices stored at -20°C
was measured by LC-MS/MS at 90 days.
The minimum and maximum recovery from 12 devices per lot per storage condition
is shown below.

The following potential interference from substances commonly present in oral fluid
were evaluated by spiking into drug free oral fluid or oral fluid containing the target
drug with concentrations of 50% below and 50% above cutoff level to a concentration
of 5%: alcohol, baking soda, chewing gum, coffee, cola, cough syrup, cranberry
juice, food coloring (blue, green, and red), methanol cough drops, milk, mouthwash,
MSG, orange juice, salt, sugar, tea, toothpaste, and tomatoes. None of these
substances showed any interference with the detection of any analyte (MET, COC,
MOP, AMP, PCP, THC) using the device.
Potential interference from cigarette smoking, was evaluated by asking a participant
to smoke a cigarette, after 15 minutes and oral fluid sample was collected and spiked
with each drug at concentrations of cutoff +/- 50%. No interference with the
detection of any analyte (MET, COC, MOP, AMP, PCP, THC) using the device was
observed.
Potential interference from Hemoglobin was evaluated by adding it to drug free oral
fluid or oral fluid containing the target drug with concentrations of 50% above and
50% below cutoff level to a concentration of 100ug/mL. No interference with the
detection of any analyte (MET, COC, MOP, AMP, PCP, THC) using the device was
observed.
Effect of oral fluid pH: To investigate the effect of oral fluid pH, oral fluid samples
with pH 4 to 9 were spiked with target drugs at 50% below and 50% above Cut-Off
levels. These samples were tested using three lots of the device. Results were all
positive for samples at and above +50% Cut-Off and all negative for samples at and
below -50% Cut-Off.
There is the possibility that other substances and/or factors not listed above may
interfere with the test and cause false results, e.g., technical or procedural errors.
