H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The ARIES C. difficile Assay is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based
qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the direct detection of toxigenic Clostridium difficile
(C. difficile) nucleic acid in unpreserved, unformed (liquid or soft) stool specimens obtained
from patients suspected of having Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). The test targets the
C. difficile toxin A gene (tcdA) and toxin B gene (tcdB) and is indicated for use as an aid in
the diagnosis of C. difficile infection (CDI).
The ARIES C. difficile Assay is indicated for use with ARIES Systems.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
The ARIES C. difficile Assay is for use with unpreserved, liquid or soft human stool
specimens from symptomatic patients. Performance characteristics with other specimen
types or patients without symptoms of infection with toxigenic C. difficile have not been
established.
False negative results may occur due to the presence of sequence variation in the regions of
the tcdA and tcdB genes targeted by the ARIES C. difficile assay.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The ARIES C. difficile Assay is indicated for use with Luminex ARIES Systems.
I. Device Description:
The ARIES C. difficile Assay is a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based qualitative in
vitro diagnostic test system that consists of the ARIES System or the ARIES M1 System
with the associated ARIES Software, a stool resuspension kit, an assay-specific test cassette,
and an assay-specific Protocol File. The ARIES C. difficile Assay cassette is a disposable,
single-use device that contains nucleic acid purification reagents, an internal Sample
Processing Control (SPC), and an assay-specific master mix for the detection of the C.
difficile toxin A (tcdA) and toxin B (tcdB) genes. The assay is for use on unpreserved, liquid
2

--- Page 3 ---
or soft stool specimens from patients suspected of C. difficile infection.
The stool specimens are processed using the ARIES Stool Resuspension Kit which includes
flocked swabs for sample transfer, Stool Resuspension Tubes containing pre-processing
beads, and Stool Resuspension Buffer. To process a specimen, a flocked swab is used to
transfer an aliquot of stool to a Stool Resuspension Tube containing the appropriate volume
of Resuspension Buffer. The swab head is broken off into the tube which is then vortexed
and centrifuged. An aliquot of the supernatant from the pre-processed sample is then added
to the assay cassette which is loaded into the ARIES instrument for automated nucleic acid
extraction, amplification and detection.
The assay cassette includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC) that is extracted and
processed with the patient specimen. The SPC is designed to monitor DNA recovery,
amplification and detection.
The extracted nucleic acid and SPC are transferred through the assay cassette by magnetic
beads. The eluted sample is then used to rehydrate lyophilized PCR reagents that are specific
for the tcdA and tcdB genes and SPC. Each primer pair is labeled with a different fluorophore
and is detected in a different optical channel of the ARIES Systems. During PCR
amplification, synthetic quencher nucleotides are incorporated into the amplified products
that result in a decrease in fluorescence in the corresponding optical channel when target
DNA is present. Following amplification, melt curve analysis is performed to confirm the
identity of the amplicons. Results are interpreted automatically using parameters in the
ARIES C. difficile Assay Protocol File as either “Toxigenic C. difficile Positive”, “Toxigenic
C. difficile Negative” or “Invalid, and may be reported from the ARIES Software or from the
optional SYNCT Software desktop application.

L. Test Principle:
The ARIES C. difficile Assay is performed on unpreserved, unformed (liquid or soft) stool
from patients suspected of C. difficile infection. A swab is used to transfer a portion of the
stool specimen to a Stool Resuspension Tube containing Resuspension Buffer and
preprocessing beads. The tube is vortexed briefly to homogenize the sample and centrifuged
to sediment the beads and particulate matter. An aliquot of the supernatant is then added to
an ARIES C. difficile Assay cassette which is loaded into the magazine of the ARIES System
for automated processing. Up to 6 cassettes can be loaded in a single magazine. Within the
instrument, a barcode on the ARIES C. difficile Assay cassette is automatically scanned to
associate the cassette with the appropriate assay protocol that provides all the necessary
information to perform the test, analyze the data and generate the result report.
Each assay cassette contains all the reagents necessary for nucleic acid extraction,
amplification and detection for one sample and includes a Sample Processing Control to
monitor reagent and process integrity. Processing of the sample within the assay cassette is
fully automated and there is no direct contact between the sample or reagents and the
instrument, reducing the potential for contamination.
The extracted nucleic acids are used to rehydrate the lyophilized PCR Master Mix which
contains specific, fluorescently labeled primers for each toxin gene target and the SPC. The
fluorescently labeled primers contain the synthetic nucleotide base 2'-deoxy-5-methyl-
6

--- Page 7 ---
isocytidine (iC). During PCR amplification, incorporation of quencher-modified 2'-
deoxyisoguanosine triphosphate (iG) into the nascent DNA strand opposite the iC residues
results in a target-specific reduction of fluorescence with each successive cycle as amplicons
accumulate. The ARIES Systems monitor the decrease in fluorescence in real-time and use
the changes in signal over the course of the reaction to calculate amplification cycle (Ct)
values. At the end of the reaction the amplification products undergo melt curve analysis to
verify their identity. A combination of metrics for the toxin A (tcdA) and toxin B (tcdB)
genes of C. difficile and the SPC is used for result interpretation. If either toxin gene is
detected, the sample is reported as “Toxigenic C. difficile Positive”. If neither of the toxin
genes is detected and the SPC signal is valid, the sample is reported as “Toxigenic C. difficile
Negative”, otherwise the result is “Invalid”.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The Site-to-Site Reproducibility, Within Laboratory Precision/Repeatability and Lot-to-Lot
Reproducibility Studies described below were conducted using an assay workflow that did
not include pre-processing of the stool specimens. However, the LoD of the ARIES C.
difficile Assay was shown to be similar in terms of CFU/test cassette with and without pre-
processing, and the data from these studies were therefore considered acceptable. Assay
reproducibility with pre-processing was demonstrated over multiple days in studies
performed to evaluate the stability of stool specimens prior to testing (Section M(1)(c)).
Site-to-Site Reproducibility
The reproducibility of the ARIES C. difficile Assay between sites was evaluated in a study
performed by two operators on two instruments at each of three sites over a period of five
days. Each operator tested a blinded panel of C. difficile positive and negative samples using
the same lot of reagents (3 sites X 2 operators X 5 days X 3 replicates = 90 data points per
panel member). The panels consisted of two strains of toxigenic C. difficile each of which
was tested at Moderate, Low and High Negative target levels, in addition to C. difficile
negative samples. The results of the study demonstrated acceptable reproducibility from site-
to-site at target levels close to the limit of detection (LoD) of the assay (Table 1).

Within laboratory precision/repeatability of the ARIES C. difficile Assay was evaluated by
testing a panel of samples in triplicate on multiple ARIES instruments over a period of 12
days (3 replicates X 12 days = 36 replicates per panel member). The panel members were
prepared using same two strains of C. difficile and target levels as those in the Site-to-Site
Reproducibility Study, above. The results of the study demonstrated acceptable repeatability
and precision from day-to-day with target levels at or above the LoD (Table 2).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Specimen Stability
The stability of stool specimens for use with the ARIES C. difficile Assay was evaluated
analytically by testing pooled C. difficile negative stool specimens that were seeded with an
enumerated suspension of cultured tcdA+/tcdB+ organisms and stored under different
conditions. Unseeded stool was included to assess the effect of specimen storage on the
performance of the SPC. Six C. difficile positive and negative assay replicates were tested at
each stability time point. The results of these studies supported the stability of stool
specimens for up to 4 hours at 15-30°C, 7 days at 2-8°C or 3 months at ≤-70°C.
An additional study was conducted to verify the ability of the ARIES assay to detect C.
difficile in seeded specimens after multiple freeze-thaw cycles. The expected results were
obtained at each target level after 5 freeze-thaw cycles.
The Specimen Stability Studies required testing of multiple samples with standardized target
levels over multiple days. The results of these studies therefore provided additional data to
demonstrate acceptable reproducibility and/or repeatability of the ARIES C. difficile Assay
when using the specimen pre-processing procedure.
Reagent Stability
The shelf-life of the ARIES C. difficile Assay cassettes was evaluated in a real-time stability
study performed on three lots of reagents that were stored either refrigerated (2-8°C) or at

room temperature (15-30°C). The results from the study support assignment of an expiration
date 12 months from the day of manufacture for the assay cassettes when stored under the
recommended conditions.
A separate study demonstrated that ARIES C. difficile Assay cassettes were stable to up to 10
hours at ambient temperature when removed from their primary packaging.
Sample Processing Control
Each ARIES C. difficile Assay cassette contains a Sample Processing Control (SPC) that is
designed to monitor nucleic acid extraction and PCR amplification. Samples that are negative
for toxigenic C. difficile by the ARIES assay and in which the SPC is not detected are
reported as “Invalid” and must be retested beginning with the primary stool sample.
External Controls
External Controls should be tested according to guidelines or requirements of local, provincial
and/or federal regulations or accreditation organizations. A toxigenic reference strain of C.
difficile or clinical isolate may be used as a Positive Control. Another species of Clostridium or a
non-toxigenic strain of C. difficile or may be used as a Negative Control. Alternatively, clinical
specimens that are known to be positive or negative for toxigenic C. difficile may be used as
Positive and Negative External Controls, respectively.
External Positive and Negative Controls were tested on a daily basis during the prospective
Clinical Study described in Section M(3)(a). The Positive External Control comprised a
standardized suspension of a strain of toxigenic C. difficile. The negative External Control
comprised a strain of Clostridium sordellii. On initial testing, 184/187 (98.4%) Positive and
183/187 (97.9%) Negative External Controls produced the expected results.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection
The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the ARIES C. difficile Assay was determined for five strains
of C. difficile by testing various dilutions of enumerated cell stocks in stool matrix. The LoD
was defined as the lowest concentration tested at which ≥95% of assay replicates produced
positive results (Table 4).

Bioinformatic Analysis
The inclusivity of the ARIES C. difficile Assay primers for the tcdA and tcdB gene targets was
analyzed in silico using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). The targeted regions
of tcdA and tcdB are generally well conserved, although the potential for false-negative ARIES
C. difficile assay results due to sequence variation is noted as a Limitation in the device labeling.
In silico analysis demonstrated that the ARIES C. difficile Assay is likely to detect strains of
Toxinotype X although this was not demonstrated functionally.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity Study
The analytical specificity of the ARIES C. difficile Assay was evaluated by testing a panel of
61 organisms and viruses that may be found in stool specimens (Table 6). Testing was
performed in triplicate with each potentially cross-reactive species at ≥106 CFU/mL of Stool
Resuspension Buffer for bacteria and yeast and ≥105TCID /mL for viruses (or the highest
50
concentration attainable). Human DNA was also tested at a concentration of 5µg/mL of Stool
Resuspension Buffer.
On initial testing, 1/3 replicates for C. bifermentans and E. coli were reported as positive for
toxigenic C. difficile. Upon repeat testing of both organisms, 3/3 replicates gave negative
results with the ARIES C. difficile Assay.
Invalid results were obtained on initial testing of A. baumannii (3/3 replicates) and S.
marcescens (2/3 replicates) at >107 CFU/mL. Both produced negative results when retested at
106 CFU/mL.
The results of the Cross-reactivity Study are noted in the device labeling.

Contamination Study
The potential for false-positive results with the ARIES C. difficile Assay due to within run or
between run cross-contamination was evaluated by testing an alternating series of C. difficile
“high positive” (106 CFU/mL of Stool Resuspension Buffer) and negative samples in
successive instrument runs. The expected results were obtained for all C. difficile positive
and C. difficile negative samples (30/30 each). These results are acceptable.
f. Assay cut-off:
The ARIES C. difficile Assay result algorithm uses a combination of parameters based on
cycle threshold, amplicon melting temperature and fluorescence intensity for the tcdA and
tcdB gene targets and SPC to report results as either toxigenic C. difficile Positive, Negative
or Invalid. The algorithm parameters were established through Receiver Operator
Characteristic (ROC) analysis using known toxigenic C. difficile positive and negative
clinical specimens. The final parameters were validated in the prospective Clinical Study
described in Section M(3)(a).
g. Assay interference:
Potentially Interfering Substances
The potential for interference with the ARIES C. difficile Assay was evaluated with
endogenous and exogenous substances that may be present in stool specimens. Testing was
performed in the presence of two strains of toxigenic C. difficile (ATCC BAA-1870 and
BAA-1871, both of which are positive for both tcdA and tcdB+) as well as with C. difficile
negative samples.
All C. difficile positive and negative samples produced the expected results, with the
exception of those tested in the presence of 3.5% w/v mucin in which case 5/6 positive
samples were incorrectly reported as toxigenic C. difficile negative (Table 7). However,
when tested at a lower concentration (0.35% w/v) no interference in the presence of mucin
was observed. The potential for false negative results in the presence of mucin >0.35% w/v is
noted as a Limitation in the device labeling.

BAA-1871
4 In the presence of 3.5% w/v mucin in stool, 2/3 replicates for BAA-1870 and 3/3
replicates for BAA-1871 were reported as toxigenic C. difficile negative. No
interference was observed when mucin was tested at 0.35% w/v.
5 2/3 replicates for both BAA-1870 and BAA-1871 were negative for tcdA
Microbial Interference
The potential for interference with the ARIES C. difficile Assay by organisms and viruses
that may be present in stool specimens was investigated using the same list of species that
was evaluated for potential cross-reactivity (refer to Section M(1)(e) and Table 6). Testing
was performed in triplicate with each potentially interfering species in the presence of low
levels of each of two strains of toxigenic C. difficile, close to the LOD of the assay. The
potentially interfering species were tested at ≥106 CFU/mL of Stool Resuspension Buffer for
bacteria and yeast and ≥105TCID /mL for viruses. Human DNA was also tested at a
50
concentration of 5µg/mL of Stool Resuspension Buffer. For all replicates, the expected
results were obtained with both strains of C. difficile with the exception of those listed in
Table 8 for which repeat testing was performed. On initial testing with C. difficile strain
ATCC BAA-1870, one false negative result was obtained in the presence of both S.
marcescens and human DNA, although repeat testing produced the expected positive results.
The results of the Microbial Interference Study are included in the device labeling and the
potential for false negative results in the presence of very high concentrations of S.
marcescens is noted as a Limitation.

a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The performance of the ARIES C. difficile Assay was evaluated in a prospective Clinical
Study at four geographically diverse sites in the US using left-over de-identified unpreserved,
unformed stool specimens from patients suspected of having C. difficile infection. A total of
1021 specimens were enrolled in the study, of which 37 did not meet the prescribed criteria
for inclusion in the analysis of performance [failure to meet patient inclusion criteria (2);
absence of reference result (26); improper documentation (4); performance of the ARIES C.
difficile Assay by untrained operators (3); incorrect specimen storage prior to ARIES C.
difficile testing (2)]. Results from a total of 984 specimens were therefore available for
analysis, of which 472 (48.0%) were from males and 512 (52.0%) were from females. The
age distribution of subjects is shown in Table 9.

The results obtained with the ARIES C. difficile Assay were compared to those obtained by
direct and enriched toxigenic C. difficile culture performed at a central laboratory. Specimens
for culture were transported/stored at ambient temperature in tubes containing Anaerobic
Tissue Transport Medium (ATTM). All cultures were inoculated within 72 hours of
specimen collection. The direct culture method comprised anaerobic incubation of
cycloserine-cefoxitin-fructose agar (CCFA) plates for up to 48 hours, followed by phenotypic
identification of suspected colonies of C. difficile and testing of confirmed isolates for
cytotoxin production. For the enriched culture method, broth containing cycloserine-
cefoxitin-mannitol with taurocholate and lysozyme (CCM-TAL) was incubated anaerobically
for 48 hours before sub-culture to CCFA plates. As for the direct culture method, colonies
that were identified phenotypically as C. difficile were tested for cytotoxin production.
For the ARIES C. difficile Assay, the majority of specimens (875/984; 88.9%) were stored
refrigerated at 2-8°C prior to testing. There were also 109 specimens (11.1%) for which
testing could not be performed with 36 hours of collection, and which were therefore stored
frozen at -80°C prior to analysis.
Forty-three (43) specimens (4.3%) required repeat testing with the ARIES C. difficile Assay
due to initial Invalid results (18; 1.8%), improper specimen storage/processing (10; 1.1%),
aborted runs (10; 1.1%) or specimen mix-up (5; 0.5%). Upon re-testing, 38 specimens were
reported as either toxigenic C. difficile positive or negative but five specimens still produced
Invalid results for a final Invalid rate of 0.5% (5/984). The number of specimens available for
evaluation of performance was therefore 979. The performance of the ARIES C. difficile
Assay in comparison to direct toxigenic culture and to the combined results from direct and
enriched toxigenic culture is shown in Tables 10 and 11, respectively, and was found to be
acceptable.

ARIES C. difficile Assay performance was evaluated separately for fresh and frozen
specimens and the results are shown in Table 14. Although there was a difference in positive
percent agreement between fresh and frozen specimens in comparison to direct toxigenic
culture, performance in relation to direct and enriched toxigenic culture in combination was
similar for the two types of sample. This is acceptable.
