L. Test Principle:
The SelectaLyte Electrolyte Analyzer (Na+, K+, Cl-) measures sodium, potassium, and
chloride in dialysate using ion selective electrode technology. The sodium electrode contains
a glass tube, specially formulated to be sensitive to sodium ions. The potassium electrode
incorporates neutral carrier ionophore membranes which are highly selective for their
respective ions. The chloride electrode contains an ionophore covalently bound to a substrate
which is sensitive to negatively charged ions. The potential of each electrode is measured
relative to a fixed, stable reference established by a silver/silver chloride electrode in
concentrated salt solution. The measured potential varies with the concentration of the ion
sensed by the electrode.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A2 guideline. Serum
sample precision was evaluated by testing three levels of serum pools in two
replicates per run, two runs per day for 20 days on two instruments by multiple
operators. Whole blood sample precision was evaluated by testing three levels of
whole blood samples on two instruments with calibrations after 10 consecutive
replicates to obtain a total of 40 results per sample. The data obtained from two
instruments are very similar and a representative data set is shown in the tables
below:

The results of the linearity study support the sponsor’s claimed measuring ranges (as
described in the table above).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The SelectaLyte Na assay is traceable to a flame emission spectrophotometry
reference method, which uses reference materials from the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST).
The SelectaLyte K assay is traceable to a flame emission spectrophotometry reference
method, which uses reference materials from the NIST.
The SelectaLyte Cl assay is traceable to a coulometric reference method, which uses
reference materials from the NIST.
d. Detection limit:
Reportable ranges were determined based on the linearity studies (see above, M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A2 guideline to
determine the effects from potential interferents on the ISE assays. Various
concentrations of interferents were spiked into two levels (low and high) of each
analyte in serum or whole blood. Testing was performed in four replicates per level
using one reagent lot on one instrument. The sponsor states that interference is
considered to be non-significant if the bias between the tested and control samples are
within 4.0, 0.20 and 3.1 mmol/L for Na+, K+ and Cl-, respectively.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed following CLSI EP09-A3. One hundred
patient samples for each sample matrix type were run in singlet on one SelectaLyte
Electrolyte Analyzer and the results were compared to those obtained on the predicate
device (AVL 9180 Electrolyte Analyzer). Among the samples tested for each analyte,
10% of the samples were spiked or diluted to fully span the claimed measuring range
of each analyte. The ordinary linear regression analyses for the three electrolytes are
summarized below:

5. Calibration:
The SelectaLyte Electrolyte Analyzer (Na+, K+, Cl-) performs a 2-point calibration every
4 hours or by request with a known fluid from the SelectaLyte Reagent Pack. A 1-point
calibration is performed automatically during each measurement.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor recommends on their labeling that “Use only Selectalyte Quality Control Kit
Tri Level for monitoring performance.” and “Follow government regulations or
accreditation requirements for quality control frequency. At least once each day of use,
analyze 2 levels (low and high) of commercially available quality control (QC) material
with known Na, K, Cl concentrations.”
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not applicable
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
