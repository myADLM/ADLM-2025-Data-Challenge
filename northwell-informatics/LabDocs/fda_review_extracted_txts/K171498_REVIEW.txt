L. Test Principle:
The assay in the MSD CRP Kit is a sandwich immunoassay employing
electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection. This assay is carried out in a 96-well plate that
has integrated carbon ink electrodes screen-printed on the bottom of each well. The plate is
provided pre-coated with capture antibody on a single, well-defined region of the electrode
surface. The user adds the calibrator or sample and a solution containing detection antibody
conjugated with electrochemiluminescent labels over the course of two incubation periods.
Analyte in the sample binds to the capture antibodies immobilized on the electrode surface;
recruitment of the detection antibodies by the bound analyte completes the sandwich. The
user adds a buffer that creates the appropriate chemical environment for the
electrochemiluminescent signal and loads the plate into an MSD MESO SECTOR S 700
instrument. In the instrument, a voltage is applied to the plate electrodes causing the
captured labels to emit light. The instrument measures the intensity of emitted light to
provide a quantitative measure of analyte in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance: All results presented below were within the sponsor’s pre-
determined acceptance criteria for each study.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity: The linearity across the measuring range of the assay was evaluated by a
study according to CLSI EP6-A. Eleven serially diluted sampels were prepared by
mixing “low” (0.6 mg/L CRP) and “high” (214 mg/L CRP) pooled serum samples.
Each dilution sample was tested in a single replicate per plate. A total of four
plates/replicate were tested. Each plate was run using three lots of MSD CRP Assay
kits. This yielded a total of twelve runs. Linear regression results of this analysis are
as follows:
Test Slope (95% CI) Intercept (95% CI) R2 % Recovery
Range
(mg/L)
0.627–201 0.942 (0.926–0.958) 0.0296 (-0.04 – 0.98) 0.997 -8.9% – 0.0%
The manufacturer is reporting that the assay is linear from 3 to 160 mg/L.

Hook effect (antigen excess):
The assay was tested for prozone or hook effect up to a CRP concentration of 800
mg/L. No prozone effect was observed.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The calibrators used to calibrate the MSD CRP test are traceable to the
ERM®-DA 474 reference material.
Value assignment: A reference lot is created by diluting bulk calibration material. It is
assigned using four dilutions across the quantitation range; CRM474 is utilized as the
calibration standard. Production lots of kit calibrator are created by diluting the bulk
calibration material in CRP Diluent to the nominal highest calibration level used in
the assay. The concentration of each lot of kit calibrator is assigned using four
dilutions across the quantitation range, using the reference lot as the calibration
standard.
Controls:
The manufacturer recommends that at least two controls be run to verify the
performance of the assay method. A control in the mid to upper end of the normal
range, and a control in the mid-region of the assay curve are recommended for the
day to day evaluation of the performance of the assay. The manufacturer recommends
that at least two CRP controls at two different levels be used for quality control. The
manufacturer recommends Bio-Rad’s LiquichekTM Cardiac Markers Plus Controls,
LiquichekTM Elevated CRP Controls or equivalent.
Stability:
Kit stability/Shelf Life:
All kit components are one-time use only, and therefore open-vial stability testing is
not required. A total of three kits were utilized for stability testing. Real-time stability
testing was conducted at baseline, three months, six months, seven months, nine
months and 12 months. Six replicates were run per plate, three total runs per kit, three
kits, and six time intervals for a total of 108 data points. The provided data support
the kit stability claim of 7 months. The real-time stability study is ongoing.
Data provided for the calibrator stability testing after thawing support the stability of
the calibrators for 2 hours after thawing.

d. Detection limit:
All three studies below were conducted based on CLSI EP17-A2.
The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying 24 replicates of the blank
sample (assay diluent) over five working days on three different lots of MSD CRP
assay kits. A total of 120 data points per lot were generated. LoB was determined to
be 0.02 mg/L for all three assay lots.
Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by testing 20 replicates of six low-level
CRP pools that were prepared by mixing the MSD CRP Calibrator and the MSD CRP
Diluent in varying propritions. This resulted in 120 data points per lot, and three
different lots were tested. The measured LoD values for the three assay kits used for
this testing were 0.039 mg/L, 0.049 mg/L and 0.048 mg/L. The overall LoD for the
test system is equal to the highest LoD calculated for any of the 3 assay lots used for
testing. Therefore, the overall test system LoD = 0.049 mg/L.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined by further testing six low-level CRP
pools that were prepared by mixing the MSD CRP Calibrator and the MSD CRP
Diluent in varying proportions. Each sample was tested in eight replicates in a single
run, and one run was conducted per day for a total of five closely grouped working
days. Three los were tested. A total of 48 data points were acquired per lot. The LoQ
for the MSD CRP Assay Kit and MESO SECTOR S 700 Instrument was determined
to be 0.597 mg/L, and the Sponsor is claiming an\ LoQ of 3 mg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference study was performed according to CLSI EP7-A2 using pooled human
serum or CRP Diluent samples with CRP concentrations ranging from 10 mg/L to 40
mg/L. Each sample was tested in five replicates across three different lots of reagents.
The following putative interferents were tested by spiking in pooled human serum
samples with the CLSI EP7-A2-recommended concentrations (control samples were
spiked with the same volume of the sample diluent): unconjugated bilirubin (32
mg/dL), conjugated bilirubin (5.4 mg/dL), hemoglobin (22,200 mg/dL), triglyceride-
rich lipoproteins (633 mg/dL), rheumatoid factor (4000 IU/mL), human anti-mouse
antibodies (500 ng/mL), acetaminophen (1324 mM), acetylsalicylic acid (3.62 mM),
ibuprofen (2425 mM), salicylic acid (4.34 mM), methotrexate (2 mM). No
interferences from the tested substances were observed at the concentrations tested.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison with Roche Diagnostics C-Reactive Protein (Latex) Assay and
Roche Diagnostics Cobas Integra 800 Analyzer: Human serum samples with varying
varying levels of CRP were obtained from biorepositories from different geographical
locations within the United States. A total of 120 samples were used for this study.
13/120 (10.8%) of samples were contrived, i.e., pooled or spiked with CRP. For each
of the 120 samples, one aliquot was tested at MSD using the MSD system and the
other was tested by a commercial laboratory using the predicate device. This testing
yielded a total of 120 matched-pair data points for comparison. The results are
summarized below:
