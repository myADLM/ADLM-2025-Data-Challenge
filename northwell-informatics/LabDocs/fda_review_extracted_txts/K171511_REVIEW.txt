L. Test Principle:
The RIDA GENE Norovirus GI/GII assay is a real-time RT-PCR in vitro diagnostic test for
the simultaneous qualitative detection and differentiation of norovirus GI and GII RNA in
human stool specimens. The assay also detects an internal control RNA (ICR, bacteriophage
MS2) that is added to each sample prior to extraction. Nucleic acid extraction and
amplification/real-time detection are completed on separate instruments. Following nucleic
acid extraction with the NucliSENS easyMag extraction system from bioMérieux, the assay
is performed on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx System.
The isolated RNA is transcribed into cDNA by a reverse transcriptase. Gene fragments
specific for norovirus GI and GII are subsequently amplified by real-time PCR. The
amplified targets are detected with hydrolysis (TaqMan) probes, which are labeled at one
end with a quencher and at the other end with a fluorescent reporter dye (fluorophore). In
the presence of a target, the probe(s) hybridize to it and, during the extension step, the Taq-
polymerase breaks the reporter-quencher proximity. Upon excitation by the Applied
Biosystems 7500 FAST Dx’s halogen light source, the reporter emits a distinct fluorescent
signal which is detected by the optical unit of the Applied Biosystems 7500 FAST Dx
System. Hence, depending on the target sequence present (genogroup GI, GII or both), one,
two or none of the reporters on the norovirus specific probes emits light to be detected by
the instrument. Fluorophores are chosen in a way that their excitation and emission
wavelengths do not overlap and signals are readily discriminated by the software. The
fluorescence signal increases with the amount of formed amplicons.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The RIDA GENE Norovirus GI/GII assay incorporates an Internal Control RNA
(ICR; bacteriophage MS2), a positive control (non-infectious in vitro transcribed
RNA containing a portion of the targeted norovirus GI and GII genes) and a negative
control (Tris buffer) to monitor reagent and assay performance. The positive and
negative controls should be included in every PCR run. The Internal Control RNA
(ICR) should be used during extraction and amplification in the assay.
Control types used to monitor:
· Positive control: Substantial reagent failure including primer and probe
integrity
· Negative control: Reagent and/or environmental contamination
· ICR: Inhibitors in the extracted specimen; assures adequate amplification
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) was performed to evaluate the analytical sensitivity of
the RIDA GENE Norovirus GI/GII assay using a dilution series of two native fecal
samples, one genogroup I and one genogroup II, diluted into a negative stool matrix.
The genogroup of the two native samples was determined by conventional RT-PCR
followed by bi-directional sequencing. The norovirus RNA copy numbers in the
dilution series of fecal samples were determined by using two standard curves
containing either GI or GII transcripts quantified by real-time RT-PCR.
Measurements for the standard curve were performed in duplicate. The dilution
series of samples were tested by the RIDA GENE Norovirus GI/GII assay applying
the quantified standard curve described above.
The preliminary limit of detection of the RIDA GENE Norovirus GI/GII was
established based on the RNA copy number that gave a minimum of 2 out of 3
positive test results. The LoD concentration determined from the preliminary study
was further verified by testing 20 replicates at the the LoD concentration. The LoD
was confirmed if all of those replicates yielded positive results.
The LoDs of the RIDA GENE Norovirus GI/GII for the two genogroups are
presented in the table below.

Norovirus Genogroup Limit of detection
Norovirus GI 6.5x 105 copies/g stool
Norovirus GII 2.5x 105 copies/g stool
e. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity):
The analytical reactivity of the RIDA GENE Norovirus GI/GII was evaluated using
twenty four genotypes representing both norovirus genogroups (GI and GII). The
studies were carried out with positive clinical stool specimens representing norovirus
GI and GII genotypes at low (near LoD) and at high concentration. Negative pooled
clinical stool matrix was used for preparing the dilutions of norovirus clinical stool
samples. Positive clinical stool specimens were tested for eight (8) norovirus GI
genotypes and sixteen (16) norovirus GII genotypes including the recently
circulating Norovirus GII.4 Sydney strain and the previously dominant Norovirus
GII.4 New Orleans strain with the RIDA GENE Norovirus GI/GII assay. The results
of the analytical reactivity (inclusivity) study demonstrated that the RIDA GENE
Norovirus GI/GII assay appropriately identified all the temporally and
geographically diverse samples selected to represent the range of norovirus
genotypes. The table below shows the data for the analytical reactivity studies.

f. Analytical specificity (Cross-reactivity):
The analytical specificity of the RIDA GENE Norovirus GI/GII Assay was
evaluated by testing a panel of 69 organisms, consisting of 56 bacteria, 1 fungus, 8
viruses, and 4 parasites representing common gastroenteritis pathogens or those
potentially encountered in stool. The analytical specificity study included testing of
bacterial cultures at 106 to 109 cfu/ml, parasite and fungi cultures at 107 to 109
cfu/ml, and viral cell culture supernatants at 105 to 109 pfu/ml in the stool
specimens.
The samples were extracted using the NucliSENS easyMAG System and tested on
the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx platform. The analytical specificity of the
RIDA GENE Norovirus GI/GII Assay was 100 %. Results are shown in the table

g. Interference:
The performance of the RIDA GENE Norovirus GI/GII assay was evaluated with
potentially interfering substances that may be present in stool. The substances were
added to 9 fecal samples containing the analyte: 3 low positive GI, 3 low positive
GII and 3 negative. Low positive stool specimens contained norovirus GI and GII at
a concentration of 2-3x LoD. For each sample a common batch was prepared and
subsequently aliquoted into 12 portions (11 substances and 1 reference
measurement). An interfering substance was added to each sample and tested in
triplicates. As a reference one aliquot of each sample was measured without addition
of a substance.
None of the potentially interfering substances interfered with detection of norovirus
concentrations near the LoD of the RIDA GENE Norovirus GI/GII.

h. Carry-Over/Cross-Contamination:
An internal carry-over/cross-contamination study was performed with the RIDA
GENE Norovirus GI/GII assay in association with the NucliSENS easyMAGSystem
and the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx platform. In this study, one high positive
norovirus GII sample was measured 47 times alternating with a negative sample
measured 47 times on the same plate. This setup was repeated for a total of 5 runs
(negative adjacent positive). The results showed no carry-over/cross-contamination.

Clinical Performance
Performance characteristics of the RIDA GENE Norovirus GI/GII assay were
established during a prospective, multi-center study conducted at four institutions in
the U.S. from February 2014 to April 2015. The study specimens consisted of raw or
unpreserved unformed stool specimens from subjects with symptoms of acute
gastroenteritis. A total of 769 specimens were collected at the four different study
sites. Of the 769 samples, 50 samples could not be used for study analysis. An
additional 332 samples were prospectively collected during various outbreaks at two
institutions and were tested (September 2016 to April 2017); of the 332 samples, 300

samples provided valid results.
A total of 1019 specimens provided valid results with the norovirus GI and GII by the
RIDA GENE Norovirus GI/GII assay. The RIDA GENE Norovirus GI/GII
performance was compared to a composite reference method performed at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, GA, US). The composite
reference method consisted of conventional RT-PCR followed by bi-directional
sequencing for two different target regions of norovirus.
The RIDA GENE Norovirus GI/GII demonstrated 91.8% PPA and 99.1% NPA for
detection of norovirus GI, relative to the composite reference method. The RIDA
GENE Norovirus GI/GII assay demonstrated 94.7 % PPA and 98 % NPA for
detection of norovirus GII. Results are presented in the tables below.

4. Expected values/Reference range:
The prevalence of norovirus GI and norovirus GII with the RIDA GENE Norovirus
GI/GII was calculated for 719 prospectively collected fresh, raw or unpreserved stool
specimens from a multicenter study. The overall number and percentage of positive
prospective norovirus GI and norovirus GII as determined by the RIDA GENE
Norovirus GI/GII assay was 4.2 % (30/719) and 31.3 % (225/719), respectively, as
presented in the following table.
