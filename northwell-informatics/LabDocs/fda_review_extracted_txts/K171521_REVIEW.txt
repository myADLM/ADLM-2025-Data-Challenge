4. Special instrument requirements:
DUS R-50S Analyzer
Device Description:
The DUS R-50S (Urine Chemistry System) consist of the DUS R-50S Analyzer and the
DUS Series Urine reagent strips (DUS 10 reagent strips and the DUS 2AC reagent
strips). The DUS R-50S Analyzer is a semi-automated urine chemistry analyzer. The
analyzer uses the principle of light-reflection. The strip is illuminated by white light and
the reflected light from the strip is detected by the sensor. The RGB signals are digitized
and this digitized image is interpreted by the processor. The parameter values are
determined based on the changes in the pad color. The DUS R-50S Urine Chemistry
system reports qualitative and semi-quantitative results including the date and time of the
measurement, sequence number and ID stored in the analyzer.
DUS Urine reagent strips are plastic strips with different reagent pads affixed for the
determination of leukocyte, nitrite, urobilinogen, protein, pH, blood, specific gravity,
ketone, bilirubin, glucose, microalbumin and creatinine in urine. The DUS Series Urine
reagent strips contain the following multi-parameter strip:
• DUS 10 reagent strips for urinalysis include test pads for leukocytes, nitrite,
urobilinogen, protein, pH, blood, specific gravity, ketone (acetoacetic acid), bilirubin
and glucose.
• DUS 2AC reagent strips for urinalysis include test pads for microalbumin and
creatinine.

L. Test Principle:
Urobilinogen: The test is based on the Ehrlich’s reaction. Color changes from light orange-
pink to dark pink.
Glucose: Glucose oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of glucose to form hydrogen peroxide. The
hydrogen peroxide thus formed then oxidizes a chromogen on the reaction pad by the action
of peroxidase.

Bilirubin: Azo-coupling reaction of bilirubin with a diazonium salt in an acid medium to
form an azo dye. Color changes from light tan to beige or light pink.
Ketones: The test is based on the Legal’s test-nitroprusside reaction. Acetoacetic acid in an
alkaline medium reacts with nitroferricyanide to produce a color change from beige to
purple.
pH: The test is based on the double indicator system. Indicator’s methyl red and
bromothymol blue are used to give distinct color changes from orange to green to blue.
Blood: The test is based on the pseudo-peroxidase activity of the heme moiety of hemoglobin
and myoglobin. The chromogen is oxidized by a hydroperoxide in the presence of heme and
changes color from yellow to blue.
Specific Gravity (SG): Ionic solutes present in the urine cause protons to be released from a
polyelectrolyte. As the protons are released the pH decreases and produces a color
change of bromothymol blue from blue-green to yellow-green.
Protein: The test is based on the protein-error of-indicators reaction. When pH is held
constant by a buffer, indicator dyes release H+ ions because of the protein present and
change color from yellow to blue green.
Nitrite: The test is based on the diazotization reaction of nitrite with an aromatic amine to
produce a diazonium salt. It is followed by an azo-coupling reaction of this diazonium salt
with an aromatic compound on the reaction pad. The azo dye produced causes a color change
from white to pink.
Leukocyte: This test pad contains an indoxyl ester and diazonium salt. It is followed by an
azo-coupling reaction of the aromatic amine formed by leukocytes esterase with a diazonium
salt on the reaction pad. The azo dye produced causes a color change from beige to violet.
Microalbumin: This test is based on dye binding using sulfonephthalein dye. At a
constant pH, albumin binds with sulfonephthalein dye to develop a blue color. The
resulting color ranges from pale green to aqua blue.
Creatinine: This test is based on the reaction of creatinine with a dye-metal complex.
At an alkaline condition, creatinine reacts with a dye-metal complex to form a purplish
brown color complex.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was done in accordance with CLSI EP5-A3. The within-run and
within-day precisions were performed by trained laboratory professionals at three
clinical sites, using two levels of commercially available urine based quality control
material. The studies utilized three DUS R-50S analyzers and three different lot
numbers of DUS 10 and DUS 2AC reagent strips.
The within-run precision study was conducted by three laboratory professionals
testing 2 levels of commercially available urine based quality control material. Ten
test strips from three different lots at 3 sites were used in this study (30 tests at each
site = 90 replicates per level). The within-day precision study was conducted by three
laboratory professionals each testing one test strip a day from three different lots at 3
sites for ten days (30 tests at each site = 90 replicates per level).
The within-run and within-day precision studies for all 3 sites are summarized below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: No traceability is claimed
Calibration: The DUS R-50S Analyzer performs a “self-test” and calibration each
time it is turned on. Each time a test is run, the analyzer re-calibrates using a white
plastic calibration bar located at the upper end of the loading plate. Reflectance
measurements from the bar must match the factory set calibration.
Self-life stability: The stability studies was performed to assess the shelf life (closed
bottle) stability for the DUS Series Urine reagent strips on the DUS R-50S Analyzer.
The protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and founds sufficient. The
stability studies support the sponsors claim that the DUS Series Urine reagent strips,
unopened, are stable for 26 months at 2-30 C° at <50% humidity.
Open vial stability: Open bottle stability studies were performed on the DUS Series
Urine reagent strips used on the DUS R-50S Analyzer. The protocol and acceptance
criteria were reviewed and found sufficient. Based on the studies, once opened the
test strips are stable for 6 months when stored from 2-30 °C at <50% humidity.

Quality Control: No urine controls are provided with this device. In the labeling, the
sponsor recommends the use of commercially available quality control material.
d. Detection limit:
A detection limit study was performed to determine the analytical sensitivity or the
lowest concentration of each analyte that can be distinguished from negative. Urine
samples were prepared by spiking a negative human urine pool with standard
materials to create 3 levels across the measuring range for each analyte concentration.
Each samples concentration was analyzed 30 times using three reagent strip lots, on
three DUS R-50S Analyzer. Sensitivity was defined as the cutoff which 95% of the
contrived pool measurements were trace or positive. The detection limit study and
the linearity study support the following reportable ranges for the DUS 10 reagent
strips and the DUS 2AC reagent strips:

e. Analytical specificity:
Potential interferents and drugs were evaluated to assess the interfering effect on the
performance of the DUS R-50S (Urine Chemistry System). A urine sample pools
was prepared at 3 concentrations (negative, low positive and high positive) for each
urine chemistry analyte. A negative urine pool was spiked with potential interfering
substances at various interference concentrations and analyzed in three replicates
using three lots of DUS strips (DUS10, DUS2AC) on three DUS R-50S analyzer.
Interference was defined as change in output of ±1 color block between the spiked
and unspiked control sample. The results of the interference studies are summarized
below:

The labeling includes the following limitations to address the interferences observed:
As with all laboratory tests, definitive diagnostic or therapeutic decisions should not
be based on any single result of method. Substances that cause abnormal urine color
may affect the readability of test pads in urinalysis reagent strips.
Urinary ascorbic acid concentrations as low as 40mg/dl can cause interference in
specimens with low concentrations of glucose, blood, nitrite and bilirubin.
Urobilinogen: The absence of urobilinogen in the specimen can’t be determined. The
test area will react with interfering substances known to react with Ehrlich’s reagent,
such as p- amino salicylic acid. Drugs containing azo gantrisin (sulfamethoxazole) or
high bilirubin may give a masking golden color. Preservative formaldehyde may
cause false negative. The test is not reliable method for the detection of
porphobilinogen.
Glucose: Ascorbic acid (more than 40mg/dl) may cause false negative result at the
low level of glucose. Ketones reduce the sensitivity of the test. Moderately high
ketone level (> 40mg/dl) may cause a false negative for specimen containing small
amount of glucose (100mg/dl). Chlorine Bleach (≥1%), low SG and formaldehyde
urine may cause false positive result at the low level.

--- Page 15 ---
Bilirubin: Metabolites of drugs, such as selenium (≥220mg/dL),
phenazopyridine(≥37mg/dL) may cause false positives. p-Amino salicylic acid
(≥1500mg/dL) can produce a yellow-orange to red color response, which may result
in false positive bilirubin readings. Ascorbic acid (≥40mg/dL) may cause false
negative.
Ketones: Low level false positive reactions may be seen in highly concentrated urine
specimens (high specific gravity) or in specimens containing large amounts of
levodopa metabolites drug such as captopril. The uroprotective drug mesna (sodium
2-mercaptoethane sulfonate) and other free-sulfhydryl compounds produce false-
positive results in ketone methods that are based on the Legal reaction (alkaline
sodium nitroprusside).
pH: If excessive urine remains on the strip because of improper test procedure, it is
possible that the acidic buffer in the protein pad comes out and affect the pH pas, then
pH results may be erroneously decreased. This phenomenon is called “carry-over
effect.”
Blood: Elevated specific gravity or protein in urine may reduce the reactivity of the
blood test pad. Microbial peroxidase associated with urinary tract infection may cause
false positive results. Ascorbic acid concentrations (>30 mg/dl) may cause false
negatives at the low blood concentrations. Substances that cause abnormal urine
color, such as drug containing azo dyes, nitrofurantoin and riboflavin may cause false
positive results. Strong oxidizing cleaning agents such as chlorine bleach cause false
positive results.
Specific Gravity (SG): High-buffered alkaline urine may cause diminished result,
whereas high buffered acidic urine may cause slightly elevated result.
Protein: False positive results may be found in strongly basic urine (pH 9). The
interpretation of results is also difficult in turbid urine specimens. Metabolites of
drugs, such as acetaminophen, hemoglobin may cause false positives. Pigments such
as bilirubin and azo-containing compounds cause false positive results.
Nitrite: Ascorbic acid (>40mg/dL) may cause false negative result with urine
containing low levels of nitrite (<0.03mg). The negative result does not always mean
that the patient is free from bacteriuria. Medication such as phenazopyridine or other
azo-containing compounds or other dyes cause false positive results.
Microalbumin: The following substances may cause false positive results; a large
amount of hemoglobin(≥5mg/dl), visibly bloody urine, highly alkaline urine(pH≥9),
disinfectant including quaternary ammonium compound. Substances that cause
abnormal urine color, such as drug containing nitrofurantoin, riboflavin may affect
the results (false positives).
Creatinine: Nitrofurantoin(≥200mg/L), Riboflavin(≥50mg/L) and a large amount of
15

--- Page 16 ---
hemoglobin(≥5mg/dl) cause false positive results. Visibly dark brown color urine
may affect the results (false positives). Substances that cause abnormal urine color,
such as drug containing nitrofurantoin, riboflavin may affect the results (false
positives).
Microalbumin to Creatinine Ratio: A low microalbumin result (10mg/L) in
combination with strongly diluted urine (creatinine result of 10mg/dl) could indicate a
microalbumin concentration below the sensitivity limit. In that case, consider testing
a new specimen, preferably a first morning collection, for greater confidence in the
result.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison study was conducted at three clinical sites with a total of 867
samples (Site A 255 samples, Site B 280 samples and Site C 332). Three trained
laboratory professionals performed the testing at each site. Fresh urine samples were
obtained at each medical facility. The samples were processed within 4 hours. The
results from the DUS R-50S urine chemistry system (DUS R-50S instrument, DUS10
and DUS2AC reagent strips) was compared to the predicate device (Siemens Clinitek
Status + urine chemistry instrument using Multistix 10SG and CLINITEK
Microalbumin 2 test strips). No altered samples were used in this study. The results
of the method comparison study for the combined sites are shown in the table below.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Literature references were provided to support the stated reference ranges:
Urobilinogen: The normal urobilinogen range is 0.1 to 1.0 Ehrlich unit /dl. If results
exceed the concentration of 2.0 mg/dl, the patient and the urine specimen should be
evaluated further.
Glucose: The kidney normally excretes small amounts of glucose. Concentrations of
100mg/dl may be considered as abnormal if found consistently.
Bilirubin: Normally no bilirubin is detectable in urine by even the most sensitive
methods. Even trace amounts of bilirubin are sufficiently abnormal to require further
investigation.
Ketones: Ketone bodies should not be detected in normal urine specimens with this
reagent.
pH: Urine values generally range from pH 4.5 to 8.
Blood: Normally, no hemoglobin is detectable in urine (0.010mg/dl; 3 RBC/μl). When
hemoglobin appears in urine it indicates kidney disease or a urinary tract disorder. Blood
may often be found in the urine of menstruating females.
Specific Gravity (SG): The normal SG of urine ranges from 1.001 to 1.035.
Protein: Normal urine specimens ordinarily contain some protein (<20mg/dL) therefore
only persistent elevated levels of urine protein indicate kidney or urinary tract disease.
The persistent results of trace level or over indicate significance proteinuria and thus
further clinical testing is needed to evaluate the significant of results.
Nitrite: Normally no nitrite is detectable in urine.
Leukocyte: Normally no leukocytes are detectable in urine.
Microalbumin: Normal albumin levels in urine are under 2mg/dl. Microalbuminuria is
indicated with results of 3~30mg/dl.
Creatinine: The urine of healthy individuals contains 10~300mg/dl of creatinine. Very
low creatinine results can be caused by adulteration of the urine specimen or by severe
renal failure.
21

--- Page 22 ---
Microalbumin to Creatinine Ratio: Microalbumin is normally present in urine at
concentrations of less than 30mg albumin / g creatinine. Microalbuminuria is indicated at
a ratio result of 30-300 mg/g (abnormal) and clinical albuminuria at a ratio result of
>300mg/g (high abnormal).

N. Instrument Name:
DUS R-50S Analyzer
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ____X____ or No ________
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
The DUS R-50S user manual instructs the user to input the patient and sample ID number
into the DUS R-50S analyzer by pressing the number keypad of the display (Maximum
10 digits).
22

--- Page 23 ---
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The urine sample should be collected in a clean, dry container with no added
preservatives. The specimen should be tested by the user by dipping a DUS test strip into
a patient’s urine specimen for no more than two seconds. The user removes the strip and
excess urine and places the test strip onto the instrument. The DUS R-50S will perform
the reading and evaluation of the urine strip.
5. Calibration:
The DUS R-50S analyzer calibrates using a white plastic calibration pad located on the
edge of the strip tray. Calibration is performed automatically before each reagent strip is
read. Reflectance measurements from the pad must match the factory set calibration.
When strong variations are detected by contamination of the calibration pad or low light
intensity an error message (system check failed) will be displayed.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsors states the following in their labeling: For best results, performance of
reagent strips should be confirmed by commercially available quality control or assayed
urine controls whenever a new bottle of DUS reagent strips are first opened. Water
should NOT be used as a negative control. Controls should be tested after performing
maintenance or service on the reader. Quality Control materials should be used in
accordance with local, state, and/or federal requirements for QC testing.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not applicable
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
