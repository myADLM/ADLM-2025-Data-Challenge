2. Indication(s) for use:
The CAPI 3 Hb A1c kit is intended for separation and quantification of the HbA1c glycated
fraction of hemoglobin (in IFCC unit (mmol/mol) and NGSP unit (%)) in venous whole
human blood, by capillary electrophoresis in alkaline buffer with the CAPILLARYS 3 TERA
instrument. Measurement of hemoglobin A1c is used as an aid in diagnosis of diabetes, as an
aid to identify patients who may be at risk for developing diabetes mellitus, and for the
monitoring of long-term blood glucose control in individuals with diabetes mellitus. The
CAPI 3 Hb A1c kit is intended for in vitro Diagnostic Use Only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For In Vitro Diagnostic Prescription Use.
The CAPI 3 HbA1c kit should not be used:
· for point-of-care use
· in monitoring daily glucose control
· to replace daily home testing of urine and blood glucose levels
· to replace glucose testing in pediatric patients, pregnant women, or patients with Type
1 diabetes.
· for analyzing samples from patients with total hemoglobin levels of less than 2.9 or
greater than 30.5 g/dL and any hemoglobinopathies that may interfere.
· to diagnose diabetes during pregnancy or to diagnose gestational diabetes. HbA1c
reflects the average blood glucose levels over the preceding 3 months (the average
life of a red blood cell), and therefore may be falsely low during pregnancy or any
other condition associated with recent onset of hyperglycemia and/or decreased red
cell survival,
· to diagnose diabetes in patients with the following conditions:
Any condition that alters the life span of the red blood cells, including recent blood
loss, transfusion, significant iron deficiency, hemolytic anemia (including hereditary
spherocytosis) or other hemolytic diseases, hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias, as
the altered red blood cell turnover interferes with the relationship between mean
blood glucose and HbA1c values, malignancies or severe chronic hepatic and renal
disease.
· In cases of rapidly evolving Type 1 diabetes, the increase of HbA1c values might be
delayed compared to the acute increase in glucose concentrations. In these conditions,
diabetes mellitus must be diagnosed based on plasma glucose concentration and/or
the typical clinical symptoms.
4. Special instrument requirements:

L. Test Principle:
The CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument uses the principle of capillary electrophoresis in free
solution. With this technique, charged molecules are separated by their electrophoretic mobility
in an alkaline buffer with a specific pH. Separation occurs according to the electrolyte pH and
electroosmotic flow.
The CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument has silica capillaries functioning in parallel allowing 12
simultaneous analyses of HbA1c quantification in a whole blood sample. A sample dilution with
hemolysing solution is prepared and injected by aspiration at the anodic end of the capillary. A
high voltage protein separation is then performed and direct detection of the hemoglobins is
made at the cathodic end of the capillary at 415 nm, which is the absorbance
wavelength specific to hemoglobins. Before each run, the capillaries are washed with a wash
solution and prepared for the next analysis with buffer.
At the end of analysis, relative quantification of individual HbA1c fractions is performed
automatically. The HbA1c concentrations are reported in %HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP) and in
mmol/mol (IFCC) units.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the CAPI 3 HbA1c procedure was evaluated based on CLSI EP06-A
Guideline Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A
Statistical Approach. Two blood samples, including a normal sample with HbA1c
concentration at 3.8 % HbA1c (18 mmol/mol) and an elevated HbA1c level sample with
HbA1c concentration at 17.3 % HbA1c (166 mmol/mol) were mixed within different
proportions and the mixtures were electrophoresed with the CAPI 3 Hb A1c procedure.
For each mixture, samples were analyzed in triplicate. The following table summarizes
the linear regression results.
Units Slope y-intercept Correlation coefficient
NGSP (%HbA1c) 1.0034 -0.3047 0.999
IFCC (mmol/mol) 1.0016 -3.2377 0.999
The study supports the claimed reportable range of the device from 4.0 to 16.5% HbA1c
(20 - 157 mmol/mol).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The CAPI 3 HbA1c assay is certified with the National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP). The NGSP certification expires in one year. See NGSP
website for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
Value assignment:
The Hb A1c CAPILLARY CALIBRATORS are required for use with this device. Value

e. Analytical specificity:
i. Endogenous Interference
Interference studies were performed to assess endogenous substances that could
interfere with the CAPI 3 HbA1c assay. The interfering substances were evaluated in
venous whole blood K EDTA samples that contained a blood sample close to the
2
cut-off value 6.4% (46 mmol/mol) and a blood sample with elevated HbA1c level
8.4% (69 mmol/mol). Ten replicates were analyzed using the CAPI 3 Hb A1c on the
CAPILLARYS 3 TERA testing system. The sponsor’s definition of non-significant
interference is ≤ 7% mean relative deviation between the tested and the control
samples.

iii. Cross Reactivity with Hemoglobin Derivatives
To study interference from carbamylated hemoglobin, four EDTA whole blood patient
samples with HbA1c concentrations at 6.3% HbA1c, 8.3% HbA1c, 45 mmol/mol
HbA1c and 67 mmol/mol HbA1c were split into two aliquots. One aliquot, at each
HbA1c level, was spiked with 1 mmol/L of potassium cyanate and incubated for 3
hours and 30 minutes at 37˚C. Another aliquot, at each HbA1c level, without potassium
cyanate was incubated for 3 hours and 30 minutes at 37˚C. Ten replicates were
analyzed using the CAPI 3 Hb A1c on the CAPILLARYS 3 TERA testing system. The
sponsor’s definition of non-significant interference is ≤7% mean relative deviation
between the tested and the control samples. The sponsor concluded that presence of ≤
8.1 mg/mL carbamylated hemoglobin does not interfere with this assay.

with HbA1c concentrations at 6.3% HbA1c, 8.5% HbA1c, 45 mmol/mol HbA1c and 67
mmol/mol HbA1c were split into two aliquots. One aliquot, at each HbA1c level, was
spiked with glucose (50 g/L) and incubated for 3 hours at 37˚C. Another aliquot, at
each HbA1c level, without glucose was incubated for 3 hours at 37˚C. Ten replicates
were analyzed using the CAPI 3 Hb A1c on the CAPILLARYS 3 TERA testing system.
The sponsor’s definition of non-significant interference is ≤7% mean relative deviation
between the tested and the control samples. The sponsor concluded that labile HbA1c ≤
20.0 mg/mL does not interfere with this assay.
To study interference from acetylated hemoglobin, four EDTA whole blood samples
with HbA1c concentrations at 6.2% HbA1c, 8.4% HbA1c, 44 mmol/mol HbA1c and 68
mmol/mol HbA1c were split into two aliquots. One aliquot, at each HbA1c level, was
spiked with acetylsalicylic acid (10 mmol/L) and incubated for 6 hours at 37˚C.
Another aliquot, at each HbA1c level, without acetylsalicylic acid was incubated for 6
hours at 37˚C. Ten replicates were analyzed using the CAPI 3 Hb A1c on the
CAPILLARYS 3 TERA testing system. The sponsor’s definition of non-significant
interference is ≤7% mean relative deviation between the tested and the control samples.
The sponsor concluded that acetylated hemoglobin up to ≤ 4.2 mg/mL does not
interfere with this assay.
To study interference from glycated albumin, four EDTA whole blood samples with
HbA1c concentrations at 6.2% HbA1c, 8.5% HbA1c, 44 mmol/mol HbA1c and 70
mmol/mol HbA1c were split into two aliquots. One aliquot, at each HbA1c level, was
spiked with glycated albumin (0.20 mg/mL) and the other aliquot, at each HbA1c level,
was without glycated albumin. Ten replicates were analyzed using the CAPI 3 Hb A1c
on the CAPILLARYS 3 TERA testing system. The sponsor’s definition of non-
significant interference is ≤7% mean relative deviation between the tested and the
control samples. The sponsor concluded that glycated albumin up to ≤ 0.20 mg/mL
does not interfere with this assay.
iv. Hemoglobin Variant Interference
A hemoglobin variant study was performed using a total of 131 normal and diabetic
whole blood K EDTA patent variant samples known to contain hemoglobin variants S,
2
C, E, D, A2, and F. Testing of the samples containing hemoglobin variants S, C, E, and
D, A2, and F were performed using CAPI 3 Hb A1c on the CAPILLARYS 3 TERA
testing system and compared to results obtained by a NGSP reference method that has
been demonstrated to be free from interference by the hemoglobin variants (Trinity
Biotech Ultra2 for HbS, HbC, HbD, HbE and Tosoh HLC-723G8 for HbF and HbA2).

HbF -4.1% (-3.3% - 4.9 % ) -0.8% (0% - 2.0%)
Significant interference was defined as ≥ 7% change in HbA1c value in the presence of
the hemoglobin variant relative to control. The results show there is no significant
interference for HbS (≤40.8%), HbC (≤37.6%), HbD (≤41.3%), HbE (≤26.8%) and
HbA2 (≤7.8%) and HbF (≤ 23.7%) at the concentrations tested in this study.
The package insert labeling contains the following prominent boxed warning;
“A significant negative interference has been observed with fetal
hemoglobin (Hb F) concentrations >23 %. HbA1c results are invalid for
patients with high amounts of Hb F (>23 %) including those with known
Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin.”
The package insert labeling states;
No interference has been observed with HbA1c fraction quantification due to the
presence of major abnormal hemoglobins Hb S (≤ 40.8 %), Hb C (≤ 37.6 %), Hb D
(≤ 41.3 %) and Hb E (≤ 26.8 %). However, due to the number of variants, the
presence of another hemoglobin variant may be observed in the HbA1c migration
zone; in the case of a shoulder on HbA1c, no result will be reported by the
software (as in presence of Hb Bart’s).

Total Error Calculations:
Using the results of bias estimation (%Bias) in the method comparison study and
precision estimates in the reproducibility study, total error (TE) at four concentrations:
(5.0 %, 6.5%, 8.0% and 12.0%) were calculated as follows: %TE=|%Bias| + 1.96 *CV*
(1 + %Bias/100). The results are as follows:
Total Error Estimation
