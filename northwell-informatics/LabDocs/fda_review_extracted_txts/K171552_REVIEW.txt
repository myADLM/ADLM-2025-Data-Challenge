1. Intended use(s):
Device Intended Use:
The Cepheid Xpert® Xpress Flu Assay, performed on the GeneXpert® Xpress System, is an
automated, multiplex real-time, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR)
assay intended for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A and
influenza B viral RNA. The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay uses nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and
nasal swab (NS) specimens collected from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory
infection. The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza
infections in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the
sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2016-2017
influenza season. When other novel influenza A viruses are emerging, performance
characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture
should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and
culture specimens.
Ancillary Collection Kit for Nasal Swabs Indications for Use:
The Xpert® Nasal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve, and transport
nasal swab specimens containing viruses from patients with signs and symptoms of
respiratory infection prior to analysis with the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay.
Ancillary Collection Kit for Nasopharyngeal Swabs Indications for Use:
The Xpert® Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve, and
transport nasopharyngeal swab specimens and to preserve and transport nasal
aspirate/wash specimens containing viruses from patients with signs and symptoms of
respiratory infection prior to analysis with the Xpert Flu Assay or the Xpert Flu/RSV XC
Assay. The Xpert® Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve,
and transport nasopharyngeal swab specimens containing viruses from patients with signs
and symptoms of respiratory infection prior to analysis with the Xpert Flu+RSV Xpress
Assay, Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay or the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay.

4. Special instrument requirements:
Gene Xpert Xpress System
I. Device Description:
This assay uses nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of
respiratory infection. Viral nucleic acid is extracted from the sample and the influenza A
and/or influenza B viral RNA is amplified and detected through real-time reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Detection and differentiation of influenza
A and influenza B is reported to the user.
The assay uses single use disposable cartridge that has a separate section for specimen
loading. The cartridge also contains all PCR reagents and is where the PCR reaction takes
place. The GeneXpert Xpress System performs all assay steps from clinical sample to
reporting assay results automatically. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check
Control (PCC) are also included in the cartridge. The SPC is present to control for adequate
processing of the target viruses and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the PCR reaction.
The Probe Check Control (PCC) verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the
cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability.
The GeneXpert Xpress System, comprised of the GeneXpert Dx System GX-II, which has
two modules capable of performing separate sample preparation and real-time PCR and RT-
PCR tests, and the GX-IV which has four modules. Each module contains a syringe drive for
dispensing fluids (i.e., the syringe drive activates the plunger that works in concert with the
rotary valve in the cartridge to move fluids between chambers), an ultrasonic horn for lysing
cells, and a proprietary thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and RT-PCR and
detection.
Turnaround time for analysis of a sample is approximately 30 minutes or less. The assay
results are automatically generated at the end of the process and provided in a report that can
be viewed and printed.

Please refer to the Decision Summary for submissions K163221 and K162456.
Reproducibility
A multi-center study was conducted at 3 sites with 3 operators at each site. Each operator
tested a 7-member blinded panel 2 times per day over 5 testing days. One lot of Xpert
Xpress Flu/RSV Assay reagents was used for this study. All sites used the GeneXpert
Xpress IV Instrument System. The panel members were comprised of influenza A (Flu
A), influenza B (Flu B), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) viral isolates spiked into
simulated matrix. Reanalysis with the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay ADF reported results of
only Flu A and Flu B. The panel member composition, with viral titer, is listed in the table

All negative samples produced a negative result (90/90).
All moderate positive samples produced a positive result [Flu A (90/90) and Flu B
(90/90)].
The low positive samples were prepared to target a concentration close the limit of
detection (LoD) for both sample types. However, this resulted in the low positive
samples having a titer lower than the LoD for the NP swab matrix. Overall, 91.0%
(81/89) of the Flu A low positive samples and 93.3% (84/90) of the Flu B low
positive samples were classified as positive for the corresponding target. Based on
the virus titer used and the LoD for the different sample types, the 91% and 93%
positive results for the low positive samples are acceptable.

d. Detection limit:
Studies were performed to determine the analytical limit of detection (LoD) of the Xpert
Xpress Flu Assay with two lots of reagents across three testing days. The higher LoD
observed per strain and per lot was selected for verification. Verification of the estimated
LoD claim was performed on one reagent lot across a minimum of three testing days.
LoD was established using two influenza A H3N2 strains, two influenza A 2009 H1N1
strains, and two influenza B strains. Viruses were diluted into negative pooled NP swab
and NS clinical matrices for testing. The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration
(tissue culture infective dose, TCID50/mL) per sample that can be reproducibly
distinguished from negative samples 95% of the times or the lowest concentration at
which 19 of 20 replicates were positive. Each strain was tested in replicates of 20 per
concentration of virus in each matrix, in NP swab and NS clinical matrix. The LoD
point values for each strain tested are summarized in Table below.

Simulated matrix consisted of 2.5% (w/v) porcine mucin, 1% (v/v) human whole blood
in 0.85% sodium chloride (NaCl) formulated in 1x PBS solution with 15% glycerol,
which was then diluted in UTM to a final concentration of 16.7%. The NS clinical matrix
was created by pooling negative NS clinical matrix, then aliquoting the pooled matrix and
spiking it with the appropriate virus. This study was performed by spiking the NS clinical
matrix and simulated matrix with influenza strains at four different concentrations relative
to the assay LoD: low positives (2X LoD), medium positives (5X LoD), and high
positives (10X and 100X LoD). The virus strains used and their concentration are shown
in the table below.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
Clinical Studies
A total of 3610 patients were enrolled in this clinical study, 29 patient specimens were
ineligible for inclusion because of improper consent documents, previously enrolled
subjects and subjects deemed ineligible by the institutional review board (not an
institution of employee). Of the 3576 eligible specimens there were 1784 nasal swabs
(NS) and 1792 nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. Each patient provided either an NS specimen
or NP swab specimen. For nasal swab specimens one swab was used to swab both
nostrils, only one nostril was swabbed for the NP swab specimen. Specimens were
prospectively collected fresh and tested as soon as possible after collection and within 24
hours.
A total of 304 samples were excluded for the following reasons; 235 unresolved
comparator result, 6 invalid comparator assay controls, 17 specimen frozen, 14 shipping
problem 9 incorrect specimen collection, 8 not tested with GX system, 4 run on incorrect
assay, and 4 not tested within protocol specified time period.
There were 3279 eligible specimens evaluated which resulted in 61 indeterminate results
(33NO RESULT and 28 INSTRUMENT ERROR), 59 of those were re-tested to yield 54
valid results from repeat testing. The final indeterminate rate was 0.2%.
The total number of eligible samples with valid results was 3272; 54.8% from female
subjects and 45.2% from male subjects. The table below shows the distribution of
patients by age group and the number of posititves for Flu A and Flu B.

4. Level of Concern
Moderate
5. Software Description
The GeneXpert Instrument Systems are provided with a computer, preloaded with
software for running tests and viewing results. Each instrument (Dx and Infinity) contains
random access, closed-system, computer-based software and embedded firmware which
run dedicated microprocessor-controlled modules to integrate sample preparation,
amplification and real-time detection in a single system.
The GeneXpert Infinity modules contain extra robotic features for cartridge handling.
The Xpertise software utilized by the Infinity Systems is the user interface and provides
the ordering of tests as well as automates loading and unloading of cartridges into
GeneXpert modules within the system. The Xpertise user interface builds upon the
existing core software functionality for handling GeneXpert modules for cartridge
fluidics control, temperature control, optics control, and data analysis by the addition of
automation handling for the robotic arm.
6. Specimen Identification
Specimens are manually loaded into the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay cartridge by the user.
The user can then either scan or type the sample and patient ID into the system. Prior to
placing the cartridge into the GeneXpert Instrument System, the barcode on the Xpert
Xpress Flu Assay cartridge is scanned. The information contained in the assay barcode is
utilized by the software to run the appropriate assay definition file (ADF). If an assay is
being run that does not already exist in the GeneXpert database, the user must import the
ADF before starting the test.
7. Calibration
Not required.
8. Quality Control
Sample Processing Control
The sample processing control (SPC) is a non-infectious armored RNA pseudovirus that
is included in each cartridge to verify that adequate processing of the sample has
occurred. The SPC verifies that nucleic acids have been released from the target viruses if
the organism is present and detects specimen-associated PCR and RT-PCR inhibitors.
The SPC should be POSITIVE in a sample that is negative for influenza A and influenza
B target analytes, and can be NEGATIVE or POSITIVE in a sample containing
detectable levels of one or both of the target analytes.
18

--- Page 18 ---
Probe Check Control
Before the start of the amplification process, the GeneXpert Instrument Systems
measures the fluorescence signal from the probes to monitor bead rehydration, reaction
tube filling, probe integrity, and dye stability. All assay reagents must be present and
intact for the PCC to pass the validated acceptance criteria. If any of the PCC conditions
fail, the result is reported as an ERROR and the test must be repeated using a new assay
cartridge.
