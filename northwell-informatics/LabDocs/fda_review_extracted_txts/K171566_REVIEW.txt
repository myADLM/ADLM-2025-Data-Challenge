L. Test Principle:
Atellica IM TnIH is a 3-site sandwich immunoassay using direct chemiluminometric
technology. The Solid Phase reagent is magnetic latex particles conjugated with streptavidin
with two bound biotinylated capture monoclonal antibodies each recognizing a unique
cardiac troponin I (cTnI) epitope.
The Lite Reagent comprises a conjugate whose architecture consists of a proprietary
acridinium ester and a recombinant anti-human cTnI sheep Fab covalently attached to bovine
serum albumin (BSA) for chemiluminescent detection. The accumulated light signal is
directly related to the sample cTnI concentration.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated precision in several studies following the recommendations in
CLSI EP05-A3. The Atellica TnIH precision study was performed in a single site for
20 days using two instruments, one reagent lot with two readings a day with native
patient samples and samples from AMI patients that were diluted with native serum
or lithium heparin plasma from healthy subjects for a total of 80 replicates per
troponin level. The within lab precision estimate is a total of within-run variability,
within-day, run-to-run variability, and day-to-day variability.

for six serum and four plasma samples over 20 days on two instruments and provided
similar results to those reported above. Site-to-site reproducibility was evaluated on
the Atellica IM TnIH across three sites, one lot of reagents, for five days with two
samples a day and three replicates a day in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3. The
precision reported in the site-to-site variability study was similar to the results
reported above in the instrument-to-instrument study.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Two linearity studies were performed according to CLSI EP06-A with samples
ranging from 0.28 to 150 pg/mL and 2.34 to 25,000 pg/mL. High serum and lithium
heparin plasma pools were prepared by diluting native cTnI samples from AMI
patients with negative samples from healthy subjects. Low pools were prepared from
negative samples from healthy subjects. Each dilution series comprised of nine levels
that were prepared by mixing the high and low pools. The mean was taken from each
sample tested in duplicate. Test results did not deviate from linearity by more than
10%. Representative results for weighted linear regression are shown below:
Li Hep Plasma
y = 1.016x - 0.028 pg/mL
Serum
y = 0.943x + 0.339 pg/mL
The measuring range is 2.5-25000 pg/mL with the upper end of the measuring range
being defined by the upper linear range of the assay. See detection limits in M. item
d. below for information supporting the lower end of the measuring range.
Hook Effect
The sponsor demonstrated that there is no hook effect with the Atellica IM TnIH
assay up to 530,976 pg/mL in lithium heparin plasma and up to 603,244 pg/mL in
serum.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor’s traceability scheme was reviewed and found acceptable. The Atellica
IM TnIH assay is traceable to a commercially available troponin assay.

d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) Test Protocol
The LoB was determined for the Atellica IM TnIH assay as described in CLSI
Guideline EP17-A2. Testing was performed using three lots of the Atellica IM TnIH
reagents, each on one Atellica IM analyzer. 240 determinations per matrix per lot
were obtained by testing four serum negative basepools or four lithium heparin
plasma negative basepools in twenty replicates a day for three days. LoB was
calculated non-parametrically. The largest estimate of all reagent lot-matrix-
instrument combinations tested was taken as the LoB estimate for the measurement
procedure.
Limit of Detection (LoD) Test Protocol
The LoD was determined for the Atellica IM TnIH assay in accordance with CLSI
Guideline EP17-A2. Testing was performed using three lots of Atellica IM TnIH,
each on two Atellica IM TnIH instruments. For lithium heparin plasma, 960
determinations per lot were obtained by testing six low analyte lithium heparin
plasma samples on two instruments in two replicates during two runs each day for
twenty days. For serum, 1120 determinations per lot were obtained by testing seven
low analyte serum samples on two instruments in two replicates during two runs
each day for twenty days.
The LoD was determined as the dose at which 95% of the measurements would be
greater than the LoB. The largest estimate across all reagent lot-matrix-instrument
combinations tested was taken as the LoD estimate for the measurement procedure.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) Protocol
Six low troponin lithium heparin plasma pools and seven low troponin serum pools
were utilized for the study. Testing was performed using three lots of Atellica IM
TnIH, each on two Atellica IM TnIH instruments.
For each reagent lot and matrix combination, the within-laboratory precision over
twenty consecutive working days for each sample, expressed as %CV, was plotted
against the mean concentration obtained for each sample. LoQ was determined by
this precision profile as the concentration where the %CV was less than 20%. The
highest value calculated of all reagent lot-matrix combinations tested was taken as the
LoQ estimate for the measurement procedure.
The sponsor claims an LoB of 0.50 pg.mL, and LoD of 1.7 pg/mL, and an LoQ of 2.5
pg/mL.

e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A2. Two
sample pools per matrix were tested. One sample pool had 20-60 pg/mL cTnI. The
second sample pool had 1000-2000 pg/mL cTnI. These sample pools were spiked
with potential interferents. Control samples were prepared by spiking sample pools
with the appropriate diluent at the same volume as the interfering substance stock.
Test results from samples spiked with the potential interferent were compared to test
results from the control samples. At the tested concentrations, these compounds
caused <10% interference on the Atellica IM TnIH assay.

Human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) Interference:
The interference study was designed in accordance with CLSI EP7-A2 to evaluate the
performance of the Atellica IM TnIH assay in samples containing high levels of
HAMA and RF. Interference was tested at a troponin concentration near the 99th
percentile (i.e., 30-100 pg/mL). A total of three serum and three lithium heparin
plasma samples were used in this study. The high RF (1100 IU/mL) sample and the
high HAMA (~200 ng/mL) sample were spiked into serum and lithium heparin
plasma samples. Interference was <10% using the Atellica IM TnIH assay at all
combinations of HAMA/RF and troponin tested.
Therapeutic drug interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A2.
Two sample pools per matrix were tested. One sample pool had 20-60 pg/mL cTnI.
The second sample pool had 1000-2000 pg/mL cTnI. These sample pools were spiked
with potential interferents at low and high levels. Control samples were prepared by
spiking sample pools with the appropriate diluent at the same volume as the
interfering substance stock. At the tested concentrations, all drugs caused <10%
interference on the Atellica IM TnIH assay.

Cross-Reactivity
Potential cross-reactivity of drugs and metabolites on the Atellica IM TnIH assay was
evaluated in accordance with CLSI document EP07-A2.
To evaluate cross reactivity, the substances shown in the following table were added
to lithium heparin plasma and serum patient samples at two TnI concentrations (~ 0
and 20 - 60 pg/mL). Test results from samples spiked with the cross-reactant were
compared to test results from samples without cross-reactant added. Samples were
measured on three lots. The sponsor claims that at the tested concentrations, these
compounds caused 0.0% cross-reactivity.

The following limitations are included in the labeling:
Specimens from some individuals with pathologically high gamma globulin levels
may demonstrate depressed troponin values. Additional information may be required
for diagnosis.
Heterophilic antibodies and rheumatoid factor in human serum can react with reagent
immunoglobulins, interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely exposed
to animals or to animal serum products can be prone to this interference and
anomalous values may be observed. Additional information may be required for
diagnosis.
Samples from patients receiving preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies for
therapy or diagnosis may contain human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA). Such
samples may show either falsely elevated or falsely depressed values when tested
with this method.
An unknown interference was observed in analytical spiking and dilution studies
causing negative bias that may affect interpretation of patient results. The unknown
interference may be due to the presence of troponin autoantibodies, which have been
reported in up to 10% of patients with or without AMI and up to 20% of patients
positive for rheumatoid factor. If the cTnI result is below the 99th percentile value at
the first blood draw, at least two additional blood samples should be drawn before
results are interpreted as negative for AMI.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
A clinical study was performed to evaluate the clinical performance of the device at
the different clinical cut-offs (see section 5, Expected values/reference Range,
below). A multicenter prospective study enrolled 2494 patients from Emergency
Departments presenting with chest pain or equivalent ischemic symptoms suggestive
of Acute Coronary Syndromes. Final diagnoses were adjudicated by an independent
panel of expert physicians using criteria consistent with the 2007 Universal Definition
of Myocardial Infarction (MI). Serial samples were collected from patients within 24
hours of presentation to the Emergency Department. The number of patients
adjudicated with an MI was 13% (326/2494). The sample collection times were at 0 –
1.5 hours (from time since presentation) and at the following timepoint relative to the
time from presentation: 1.5 to 2.5 hours, 2.5 to 3.5 hours, 3.5 to 4.5 hours, 4.5 to 6
hours, 6 to 9 hours, 9 to 24 hours, and greater than 24 hours after presentation to the
Emergency Department. Investigators and adjudicators were blinded to the proposed
device’s results. Adjudicators were also blinded to site diagnoses. All results
presented below were based on the adjudicated diagnoses. Clinical performance was
estimated at overall (male and female combined across both matrices) and male- and
female-specific 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) cut-offs for each matrix
type, calculated as described in Section 5, Expected values/reference Range. The
results are summarized below.

The following statements about cut-offs are included in the labeling:
Using the higher male-specific 99th percentiles instead of the overall 99th percentile
of 45.20 pg/mL (ng/L) may result in a higher proportion of negative test results for
males that are MI. For males that are MI, data analyzed using the male-specific cutoff
versus the overall cutoff increased the false-negative rate by up to 0.9%.
Using the lower female-specific 99th percentiles instead of the overall 99th
percentile of 45.20 pg/mL (ng/L) may result in a higher proportion of positive test
results for females that are non-MI. Taking into consideration the lower bound of
the 95% confidence interval, in the worst-case scenario (lithium-heparin plasma
drawn at ≥ 4.5–< 6 hours after presentation), up to 68% of positive test results for
females may be non-MI.
b. Clinical specificity:

4. Clinical cut-off:
The cut-offs for this assay were determined based on the 99th percentile upper reference
limit in apparently healthy adults. Please see section 5, Expected values/Reference range,
below for the determination of the clinical cut-offs.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor conducted a multicenter prospective study to establish the 99th percentile in a
population of apparently healthy adults. Serum and lithium-heparin plasma specimens
were collected from apparently healthy adults with no known diseases of the
cardiovascular system or other serious acute or chronic diseases or infections from the
United States who ranged in age from 22–91 years of age.
Plasma samples from 2007 subjects and serum samples from 2001 subjects were tested in
singlicate using the Atellica IM TnIH assay. The 99th percentile value for results in
apparently healthy subjects was calculated for lithium heparin plasma and serum. The
99th percentile was calculated using a non-parametric empirical univariate distribution
function. The results are summarized below:
Sample Population N 99th percentile URL 95% CI pg/mL
Matrix pg/mL (ng/L) (ng/L)
Lithium Overall 2007 45.20 33.21–64.30
Females 1007 34.11 27.36–66.23
Males 1000 53.48 38.73–80.22
Serum Overall 2001 45.43 35.47–63.63
Females 1007 38.64 28.58–72.36
Males 994 53.53 33.77–78.03
Two female subjects had troponin values of approximately 300 pg/mL and 5000 pg/mL
and were considered to be outliers. These results were not included in the 99th percentile
determination. The sponsor demonstrated that the change in the cut-off values (either for
women or overall) were not impacted by this exclusion.
Overall (combination of all cut-offs for both serum and plasma): 45.43 pg/mL
