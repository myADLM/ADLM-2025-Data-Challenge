antibody labeled with a ruthenium complex) to form a sandwich complex. In the second
step, the complex binds to the streptavidin-coated microparticles. The reaction mixture is
aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the
surface of the electrode and unbound substances are then removed with ProCell II M.
Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission which is
measured by a photomultiplier. Results are determined using a calibration curve that is
generated specifically on each instrument by a 2-point calibration and a master curve
provided with the reagent barcode.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance: The test results met the sponsor’s pre-determined acceptance
criteria for all analytical performance studies.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The within-laboratory precision of the Elecsys CA 15-3 II assay on cobas e 801 was
evaluated according to CLSI guideline EP05-A3 by testing seven human serum pools
samples and two control samples (PreciControl Tumor Marker: PC 1 and PC 2).
Samples were tested in two replicates per run, two runs per day, for 21 days using one
reagent lot on one cobas e 801 immunoassay analyzer (n=84 observations per
sample). The results are summarized in the following table:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity: Linearity of the Elecsys CA 15-3 II assay was evaluated using the cobas e
801 immunoassay analyzer according to CLSI guideline EP6-A. Fifteen dilutions
were prepared by diluting each of three high analyte serum samples with
concentration above 300 U/mL down across the lower end of the measuring range.
Each dilution was measured in replicates of three on cobas e 801 analyzer. The data
summarized in the table below support linearity throughout the claimed measuring

Hook effect: The high-dose hook effect of the Elecsys CA 15-3 II assay was assessed
using two positive serum samples spiked with CA 15-3 to achieve final analyte
concentrations of 25,713 and 21,180 U/mL. Each sample was diluted to obtain five
dilutions with CA 15-3 concentrations above the upper limit of the measuring range.
Each dilution was tested in singulate using one lot of reagent on one cobas e 801
analyzer. No hook effect was observed up to 20,000 U/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: There is no international standard available for CA 15-3. This method
has been standardized against the Elecsys CA 15-3 assay. This in turn has been
standardized against the Enzymun Test CA 15-3 method and CA 15-3 RIA by
Fujirebio Diagnostics.
Value Assignment:
The predefined master curve is adapted to the analyzer using the relevant CalSet. The
value assignment for the CalSet was described previously in K001468 and K010588.
Stability:
i) Reagent stability: Real-time stability studies for un-opened reagent stability
(shelf life) and on-board stability studies were each performed. The results
support that the reagents are stable when stored unopened at 2–8°C for 18
months or on-board (2–8°C) for 16 weeks on the cobas e 801 analyzer.
ii) Calibraton stability: The lot calibration and on-board calibration stability were
performed on the cobas e 801 and support that the calibration for the Elecsys
CA 15-3 II assay is stable for 12 weeks when using a same reagent lot and for
28 days when using the same cobas e pack on the cobas e 801 analyzer.
iii) Sample Stability: The studies were performed on the cobas e 801 for the
following storage temperatures: 2–8°C, 20–25°C, and −20°C. The results
support the claim that the specimens are stable up to five days at 2–8°C, up to
two days at 20–25°C, and up to 90 days at −20°C.
d. Detection limit: The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of
Quantitation (LoQ) of the Elecsys CA 15-3 II on the cobas e 801 analyzer were
determined according to CLSI EP17-A2.
LoB was determined by testing analyte-free serum sample in 10 replicates per run,
one run per day, for six days with three reagent lots on one cobas e 801 analyzer.
The LoB was defined as the 95th percentile of 60 measurements for each of tested lots
and determined to be 0.58, 0.21 and 0.43 U/mL for three lots. The claimed LoB is
1.0 U/mL.
LoD was determined using five serum samples with low analyte concentration. Each
7

--- Page 8 ---
sample was tested in replicates of two per run, one run per day, for six days with three
reagent lots on one cobas e 801 analyzer. The LoD value was calculated as the LoB
+ 1.653 x SD of the replicates for the samples and determined to be 1.10, 0.416, and
0.631 U/mL for each of three lots. The claimed LoD is 1.5 U/mL
LoQ was determined using a set of ten serum samples with low analyte concentration.
Each sample was tested in replicates of five per run, one run per day, for five days
with three reagent lots on one cobas e 801 analyzer to generate 25 data points per
sample per reagent lot. The LoQ is defined as the mean value of the sample which
fulfills the specification for the total within-laboratory imprecision (<20% CV) and
was determined to be 1.6, 1.46 and 1.43 U/mL for each of three lots. The claimed
LoQ is 3 U/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
i). Endogenous interferences:
The effect of the presence of elevated level of hemoglobin, lipemia, bilirubin and
rheumatoid factor (RF) on the performance of the Elecsys CA 15-3 II assay on the
cobas e 801 analyzer was evaluated by testing three serum samples with CA 15-3
concentration of 26 U/mL (low), 125 U/mL (medium) and 230 U/mL (high)
spiked with varying levels of interferent. The % recovery for each sample was
calculated by comparing to the reference sample (without spiking the interference
substance). No interference was noted for samples containing hemoglobin up to
1,000 mg/dL, lipemia up to 2,000 mg/dL, bilirubin up to 66 mg/dL, and
rheumatoid factors up to 1,500 IU/mL.
The effect of the presence of HAMA on the performance of the Elecsys CA 15-3
II assay was evaluated using three serum samples with analyte concentrations of
14.9, 124, and 240 U/mL on one cobas e 801 analyzer. The samples were tested
by spiking with HAMA serum with a concentration of 805 ng/mL. The control
samples were spiked analogously with a serum without interferent. The data
support that no significant effect with HAMA up to 805 ng/mL on the
performance of the Elecsys CA15-3 II assay.
The biotin interference on the performance of the Elecsys CA 15-3 II assay on the
cobas e 801 was evlauted by testing three serum samples with CA 15-3
concentration of 26.6 U/mL, 146 U/mL, and 238 U/mL spiked with varying level
of biotin up to 800 ng/mL. The results (% bias) are summarized in the following
table:
8

--- Page 9 ---
% Bias for Samples Containing Biotin
Sample Biotin Concentration (ng/mL)
(U/mL) 160 240 320 400 480 560 640 720 800
26.6 −4.5% −5.2% −6.2% −8.2% −11.5% −8.9% −9.8% −13.5% −13.0%
146.0 −4.0% −6.5% −9.4% −11.8% −12.3% −14.9% −15.1% −16.1% −17.7%
238.0 −1.7% −3.0% −0.9% −6.7% −5.5% −7.7% −10.4% −11.5% −12.4%
The results indicated that sample with biotin concentrations up to 320 ng/mL
demonstrated ≤10% bias in results. Biotin concentrations greater than 320 ng/mL
can lead to falsely decreased CA15-3 results.
ii) Exogenous interferences:
The effect of the presence of drugs on the performance of the Elecsys CA 15-3 II
assay on the cobas e 801 analyzer was evaluated by testing two serum samples
with concentration of 30 U/mL and 230 U/mL spiked with interferent. A total of
27 pharmaceutical compounds including 16 common drugs and 11 additional
specially used drugs were tested. No significant interference was found for each

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 190 native human serum samples spanning the measuring range were tested
with the Elecsys CA 15-3 II using the cobas e 801 (candidate) and the cobas e 601
(predicate) analyzers. Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed and the
data are summarized in the following table:
N Range Slope Intercept Correlation
(U/mL) (95% CI) (95% CI) Coefficient
190 5.14–290.00 0.97 (0.95–0.98) 0.57 (0.06–1.31) 0.97
b. Matrix comparison:
A study was performed to demonstrate that Li-heparin plasma yield comparable
values as serum by the Elecsys CA 15-3 II assay on the cobas e 801 analyzer. A total
of 49 matrix-matched samples spread across the assay range were assayed using one
lot of reagent on one instrument. Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed
and the data are summarized in the following table:
Range Slope Intercept Correlation
N
(U/mL) (95% CI) (95% CI) Coefficient
49 8.37–248.00 1.01 (0.98–1.04) −0.92(−1.36– -0.21) 0.97
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Clinical Specificity:
The clinical performance of CA 15-3 was demonstrated in K001468.
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The reference range in the normal population was previously generated by testing 272
samples from apparently healthy subjects. 95% of the results were ≤25 U/mL
(K010588). This reference range was verified per CLSI guidance C28-A3c by testing 20
apparently healthy women in age of 20 to 64 years on the cobas e 801 analyzer. The
