H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Accula Flu A/Flu B Test performed on the Accula Dock is a molecular in vitro
diagnostic test utilizing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and lateral flow technologies
for the qualitative, visual detection and differentiation of influenza A and influenza B
viral RNA. The Accula Flu A/Flu B Test uses a nasal swab specimen collected from
patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The Accula Flu A/Flu B assay
is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza infection in conjunction with clinical
and epidemiological risk factors. The assay is not intended to detect the presence of
influenza C virus.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the
sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2016-2017
influenza season. When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance
characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
influenza viruses and sent to state or local public health department for testing. Viral
culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to
receive and culture specimens.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Prescription Use
4. Special instrument requirements:
To be used only with the Accula Dock Instrument
I. Device Description:
The Accula Flu A/Flu B Test is a semi-automated, colorimetric, multiplex reverse-
2

--- Page 3 ---
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nucleic acid amplification test to
qualitatively detect influenza A and B viral RNA from unprocessed nasal swabs that have not
undergone prior nucleic acid extraction. The system integrates nucleic acid extraction,
reverse transcription, amplification using a novel Mesa Biotech technology, and
hybridization-based visual detection into a completely self-contained and automated system.
The Accula Flu A/Flu B system consists of a small reusable Dock to drive the automated
testing process and a single-use disposable test cassette that contains all the enzymes and
reagents.
Upon insertion of a Test Cassette, the Dock will detect and identify the cassette type. After
the user transfers a clinical sample into the cassette and closes the dock lid, the embedded
firmware will control fluid flow of the sample into the various chambers of the cassette.
Amplicon detection requires the hybridization of two internal probes to generate a signal on
the Accula Flu A/Flu B detection strip. Dyed polystyrene microspheres are conjugated to
oligonucleotide probes to form an amplicon-microsphere complex by hybridization to an
internal region of the amplicon. The complex migrates through the pores of the detection
strip membrane and across capture zones which contain oligonucleotides complementary to
an amplicon region distinct from the detection probe binding site. Hybridization of the
amplicon-microsphere complex to a capture zone probe retards the flow of the specific
amplicon and results in the generation of a visible signal in the form of a colored line.
Interpretation of results:
Results are interpreted visually by the operator after the test has completed. A colored line of
any intensity at the “Flu A” and/or “Flu B” location indicates a positive result for that
influenza virus type if the test is valid. A Negative Control line at the end of the test strip
controls for non-specific binding or amplification and must be absent for a valid test. A
control line at the beginning of the strip displays amplification effectiveness and is necessary
to interpret a test as “negative” for influenza A and influenza B.

L. Test Principle:
Nucleic acid amplification plus hybridization to a membrane and chromatographic visual
detection
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the Accula Flu A/Flu B Test was tested in a study using
contrived nasal swabs at three CLIA-waived sites and one moderately complex site
based in the United States. The objective of this study was to test panels of contrived
nasal swab samples with the Accula Flu A/Flu B Test to demonstrate reproducibility
of the assay in the hands of multiple users at multiple sites over multiple non-
consecutive days.
Samples were provided to testing operators in panels of 5 samples (Flu A Low
Positive and Moderate Positive, Flu B Low Positive and Moderate Positive, and
Negative). The targeted concentrations for the Moderate Positive samples were
approximately 3X the respective LoD, the targeted concentrations for the Low
Positive samples were approximately 1X the respective LoD, and the Negative
samples contained no influenza virus. Samples were blinded and randomized. Each
operator tested one panel per day, testing a maximum of five samples at a time. Each
sample was tested in triplicate (from separate swabs) (2 operators x 1 run x 3 swabs x
5 non-consecutive days = 30 observations for each site per sample type). Results are
reported for counts and percent agreement with expected results. Results were
evaluated by site, by operator and by day.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable; this is a qualitative assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality Control:
Each test cassette contains two internal process controls: an internal positive control
and a negative control. The positive control is a non-infectious RNA molecule of the
MS2 bacteriophage. The negative control is a non-influenza nucleic acid target
intended to check for non-specific binding. Each test kit also contains separate control
swabs with inactivated virus for influenza A or influenza B. The manufacturer
recommends positive controls be run for each new lot or shipment of kits received,
and for each new operator performing the test. Additional positive control swabs are
available for purchase from the manufacturer.
Specimen Stability
Contrived samples of Influenza A (A/CA/07/2009; 300 TCID /mL) and Influenza B

Mesa Biotech has indicated that specimens should be transferred to the nasal swab
buffer sample tube immediately after collection and stored for no longer than one
hour at room temperature.
Shelf Life
Accula Flu A/Flu B test kits are being tested for shelf life by storage at 30°C for
different lengths of time. At each time interval (day 0, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, and
1 month intervals beyond) stored test kits are used to test control swabs and simulated
influenza A and influenza B samples prepared in clinical matrix. Contrived specimens
are prepared in clinical matrix at approximately 3X LoD. Negative samples and
control swabs are tested as one replicate. Acceptance criteria for shelf life studies are
as follows: all positive samples and controls must yield a 100% positive rate and all
negative samples and controls must yield a 100% negative rate. Tests were

considered stable as long as they continued to produce positive results for positive
samples and negative results for negative samples. Data generated so far demonstrates
that two lots are stable for three months and a third lot is stable for at least two
months. Kit storage conditions for the Accula Flu A/Flu B test are being labeled as
stable at 15-30°C for at least two months. Expiration dating will be extended as the
study continues provided that correct results are obtained for all three test lots during
the testing period.
d. Detection limit:
The objective of the Analytical Sensitivity Study was to identify the limit of detection
(LoD) of the Accula Flu A/Flu B assay using characterized strains of Influenza A and
Influenza B. Four (4) influenza strains were run in replicates of twenty (20) for each
concentration. The influenza strains selected for testing included a 2009-like seasonal
H1N1 influenza A strain, an H3N2 influenza A strain, and two influenza B strains
representing Victoria and Yamagata lineages. Clinical matrix was used as dilution
material for all LoD determination/confirmation experiments.
To determine the limit of detection, a range-finding study was first conducted to
establish the lower limit of analytical sensitivity using virus dilutions tested in
replicates of n=5. Following identification of the lower end of the detectable
concentrations in the range finding study, virus concentrations ranging from 1.3-fold
to 2-fold more concentrated were prepared for each virus based on experimental
design and viral stock available. Virus concentration was increased until at least
19/20 independent positives were found reproducibly (i.e., in two similar
confirmations) during testing. The final concentrations whereby at least 95% of
results (≥19/20) were positive for the target virus are shown in the table below:

lineage strains. Virus was diluted into a pooled clinical matrix to create contrived
samples at a 1.5X LOD concentration. Each strain was tested in triplicate. The

g. Interfering Substances:
To assess substances with the potential to interfere with the performance of the
Accula Flu A/ Flu B test, four (4) influenza strains were tested in replicates of three
(3) with each interfering substance at the “worst case” concentration. The influenza
strains selected for testing include a 2009 pandemic swine-like H1N1 influenza A
strain, an H3N2 influenza A strain, and two influenza B strains representing Victoria
and Yamagata lineages. Virus was serially diluted into a pooled clinical matrix to
achieve a 1.5X LoD concentration.
Each influenza strain was tested with the “worst case” interferent concentration,
representing the highest concentration likely to be found in a respiratory sample.

3. Clinical studies:
Clinical performance was evaluated in a multi-site study in the U.S. during the 2016-
2017 influenza season. Accula Flu A/Flu B was used to evaluate fresh, prospectively
collected nasal swab specimens from children and adults with suspected respiratory
infection and meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Samples were tested with the
Accula Flu A/Flu B within one hour of sample collection. At all sites, one swab specimen
was tested directly on the Accula Flu A/Flu B according to product instructions. The
other swab was eluted in VTM and shipped to a reference laboratory for testing with a
high performance, FDA-cleared molecular influenza assay. Elution and shipping of the
reference swab sample was performed according to the kit instructions.
A total of 1331 nasal swab specimens were enrolled in the study. Of those, 73 specimens
were unevaluable: four did not meet eligibility criteria, 53 samples were rejected due to
protocol deviations, and 16 samples returned invalid results after repeat testing. A total of
1258 nasal swab specimens were considered evaluable. Patient age and gender
distribution for the evaluable specimens is presented in the table below:

22-59 78 49 127
≥60 26 16 42
Total 613 645 1258
During the prospective clinical study, the initial invalid rate for nasal swab samples
(before repeat testing per the product instructions) was 9.1% (116/1272). After repeat
testing per the product instructions, the invalid rate was 1.1% (14/1272). Performance of
the Accula Flu A/Flu B assay compared to an FDA-cleared molecular assay for nasal
swab samples is presented below.
