L. Test Principle:
The Atellica IM Fer assay is a 2-site sandwich immunoassay using direct chemiluminescent
detection technology, which uses constant amounts of two anti-ferritin antibodies. The first
antibody, in the Lite Reagent, is a goat polyclonal anti-ferritin antibody labeled with
acridinium ester. The second antibody, in the Solid Phase Reagent, is a mouse monoclonal
anti-ferritin antibody covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles. A direct relationship
exists between the amount of ferritin present in the patient sample and the amount of relative
light units (RLUs) detected by the system.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was determined in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3. Eleven samples [six
patient samples (four unaltered serum pools, two spiked serum pools); three serum-
based controls; and two serum-based calibrators] were assayed on an Atellica IM
Analyzer in duplicate in two runs per day for 20 days for a total of 80 replicates per
sample. Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were conducted according to CLSI EP06-A. A dilution series of 11
samples with ferritin concentrations distributed throughout the assay range were
prepared by diluting a high serum pool spiked with ferritin (1757.5 ng/mL) with a
low serum pool (<0.5 ng/mL). Samples were tested in triplicate on an Atellica IM
Analyzer using one reagent lot. The weighted Deming regression equation for the
linear range (0.9–1650.0 ng/mL) was y = 0.914x–0.888, R2 = 0.999. The 95th
confidence interval (CI) of the slope was 0.86–0.965; the 95th CI of the intercept was
-2.235–0.460.
Sample auto-dilution:
A study showed the on-system auto-dilution with factors of 2-fold, 5-fold, and 10-
fold showed results are all within ±10% of manually diluted samples above the
measuring range.
High dose hook effect:
To test for high dose hook effect associated with the Atellica IM Fer assay, 11
samples created by serially diluting a high serum sample containing ~100,000 ng/mL
ferritin with Multi-Diluent 1 were tested. The assay did not demonstrate a hook effect
up to 80,000 ng/mL ferritin.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Atellica IM Fer assay standardization is traceable to World Health Organization
2nd International Standard (WHO 80/578). Assigned values for calibrators are
traceable to this standardization.
Reagent Stability:
Shelf-life stability: The shelf-life of the Atellica IM Fer ReadyPack is eight months
when stored at 2-8°C.

On-board and open-vial stability: A stability study demonstrated that opened the
Atellica IM Fer ReadyPack stored on-board the Atellica IM Analyzer is stable for 28
days.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantification (LoQ)
of the Atellica IM Fer assay were determined according to CLSI EP17-A2.
LoB was determined by testing a total of six blank samples (human serum-based
sample pools with no detectable amounts of ferritin) using two reagent lots in two
replicates, twice a day over a period of 10 days on one Atellica IM Analyzer and
over a period of nine days on a second Atellica IM Analyzer. LoB was established as
the ferritin value corresponding to the 95th rank position. The LoB was determined to
be 0.3 ng/mL.
For LoD determination, a total of seven low level human serum-based sample pools
were evaluated. Four low level human serum-based sample pools were evaluated
using two reagent lots for ten days on one Atellica IM Analyzer and for nine days on
a second Atellica IM Analyzer. An additional three human serum-based sample pools
were tested using two reagent lots on two Atellica IM Analyzers over five days. The
LoD was determined to be 0.7 ng/mL.
The sponsor defined LoQ as the lowest amount of ferritin in a sample at which the
within-laboratory %CV is ≤ 20%. To calculate LoQ, six low level human serum
samples with ferritin concentrations between 0.4–4.6 ng/mL were tested using two
reagent lots in eight replicates per a day over a period of five days on one Atellica IM
Analyzer. Five of those samples were tested using two reagent lots in eight replicates
per day over a period of five days on a second Atellica IM Analyzer. The LoQ was
determined to be 0.9 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Endogenous Interference:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A2 by testing two
human serum pools (~20 ng/mL and ~200 ng/mL) spiked with interferent stock
solution. Each sample was tested in triplicate and analyzed in one assay run on the
Atellica IM Analyzer. The recovery was calculated by comparing to control
samples spiked with the same volume of diluents. No significant interference
(≤10% recovery of the control value) was detected for the following substances
up to the concentrations listed in the table below:

Conjugated Bilirubin 60 mg/dL

The package insert notes: “Avoid assaying grossly hemolyzed samples because
the release of intracellular ferritin can cause elevated results.”.
ii. Exogenous Interference:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A2 by testing two
human serum pools (~20 ng/mL and ~200 ng/mL) spiked with interferent stock
solution. Each sample was tested in triplicate and analyzed in one assay run on the
Atellica IM Analyzer. The recovery was calculated by comparing to control
samples spiked with the same volume of diluents. No significant interference
(≤10% recovery of the control value) was detected for the following substances

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 126 native human serum samples with ferritin concentrations across the
assay measuring interval were tested using the Atellica IM Fer assay and the
predicate device. There was no demographic or clinical diagnosis information
associated with the samples. Final calculations were performed with 107 samples
(samples outside the range of either assay were not included in final calculations) that
cover the range of 3.4–1641.4 ng/mL. Results were analyzed in accordance with
CLSI EP09-A3. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r value) was 0.99 while the
weighted Deming regression analysis generated the following results:
y = 1.03x – 0.5 ng/mL (y = Atellica IM Fer, x = predicate)
(95% CI: Intercept = -0.86 – -0.09; Slope = 1.01–1.04)
b. Matrix comparison:
A total of 56 matched sample sets (serum, EDTA plasma and Lithium heparin
plasma) spanning the assay range were tested to evaluate the effect of anticoagulants
on assay results. Of the 56 sets, seven were contrived (five spiked with liver ferritin
and two diluted with Multi-Diluent 1); the serum sample range was 2.5–1440.7
ng/mL. The results were analyzed by Weighted Deming regression:
