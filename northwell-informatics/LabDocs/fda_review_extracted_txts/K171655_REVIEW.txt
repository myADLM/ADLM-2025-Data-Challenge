--- Page 2 ---
making capability and digital cell imaging that contains a rack transport system for
sample tubes. It has five processing stations: sample mixing, slide printing, slide staining,
slide imaging (low and high magnification) and slide output. It also includes a separate
compartment, which houses the necessary consumables and waste containers.
cobas m 511 viewing station
The viewing station hardware is a computer with software that provides the graphical
user interface for the system. It is designed to interface with a standard Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for result reporting. It can be configured as the control station
or as a review station
Consumables and components
The DigiMAC³ stain pack is intended to fix and stain cells from a whole blood sample or
control/calibrator material that have been applied to a slide by the cobas m 511 analyzer.
The DigiMAC3 stain pack is comprised of the following four separate solutions, which
are individually applied to each processed slide: DigiMAC3 fix, DigiMAC3 eosin,
DigiMAC3 methylene blue, and DigiMAC3 rinse. The application of these stain solutions
results in a Romanowsky type stain.
DigiMAC³ reticulocyte is intended to stain a whole blood sample or control material
before it is applied to a slide by the cobas m 511 analyzer, in order to make the
reticulocytes suitable for automated imaging or manual microscopy.
DigiMAC3 wash is used to clean all specimen-contacting surfaces, including blood fluid
pathways, following processing of each blood sample.
DigiMAC3 clean is used to remove protein build-up from the surfaces of the cobas m 511
analyzer components that come in contact with blood samples.
The DigiMAC³ slide is a glass substrate on which a whole blood sample or
control/calibrator material is applied and stained by the cobas m 511 analyzer, in order to
enable automated imaging or manual microscopy.
Software Used in cobas m 511 system
The cobas m 511 system includes three major software components: viewing station
software, analyzer software, and the image analysis application.
Viewing Station Software
The viewing station software provides the user interface to the cobas m 511 analyzer,
including: managing system configuration and consumables; reporting analyzer and
sample processing status; troubleshooting and error recover; quality control processing
and results; reviewing sample results; classifying/reclassifying cells; and evaluating cell
morphology.
Analyzer Software
The analyzer software runs the analyzer computer and manages all hardware elements,
sample processing, data management, and viewing station communications.
Image Analysis Application
The image analysis application runs on the analyzer computer and communicates with the
2

--- Page 3 ---
cameras and motion-control hardware to acquire images at both the low- and high-
magnification imaging stations. The program identifies and measures cells in the images,
and it reports the cell counts and measurements to the analyzer software. It also saves
images for display on the viewing station.
2. Principles of Operation:
The cobas m 511 system uses digital morphology from an automatically produced
Romanowsky stained monolayer slide, to provide the complete blood count (CBC),
automated white blood cell (WBC) differential, and the enumeration of reticulocytes.
This is done through the use of proprietary imaging algorithms that locate, count and
evaluate red and white blood cells, platelets and nucleated red blood cells.
The cobas m 511 system prints a consistent sample volume (1 uL) onto a glass
microscope slide using a precision application method. In the stainer module, four
reagents are applied to the cells on the slide: a fixative, an eosin stain, a methylene blue
stain, and a rinse. Following staining, the slide is imaged at low magnification using a
10x lens to locate, image, and count white and red blood cells, nucleated red blood cells,
and platelets. The system selects a specific number of white blood cell locations and
provides their coordinates to the high magnification module for additional analysis. In the
high magnification module, a 50x lens is used to classify white blood cell types, evaluate
red blood cells, and platelets and to evaluate cellular morphology. The white blood cells
are categorized into five types (NEUT, LYM, MONO, EO, BASO), or as unclassified
cells by the instrument. This allows a skilled technologist to review images of the cells on
the viewing station or to perform a full microscopic review of the slide. This 50x
magnification is also used to identify and count the reticulocytes when a reticulocyte test
is requested. For reticulocyte processing, an additional slide is produced from blood in
the sample cup that is first incubated with a supravital stain. The cells are then printed
onto the slide, stained using DigiMAC3 stain and imaged to determine the number and
percentage of reticulocytes and reticulocyte hemoglobin.
Following processing, results and images can be viewed on the viewing station. The
viewing station allows the operator to monitor system processes and status, and to view
sample processing and results. The viewing station also allows a skilled medical
technologist to perform a full white blood cell differential and a morphological review of
white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets for samples requiring further review.

--- Page 4 ---
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Samples can be introduced onto the cobas m 511 system using either the closed tube
(automated rack mode) or open tube modes. In the closed tube mode, the operator loads
the sample tubes into a custom rack. The rack is then mechanically transported into the
cobas m 511 system for processing. In this mode the cobas m 511 system automatically
mixes, aspirates, and analyzes samples while the sample caps remain intact. In the open
tube mode, the operator processes individual samples by manually mixing the sample
collection tube by hand and then introducing the sample to the open port aspiration probe
presented by the cobas m 511 system. The operator will position the tube such that the
aspiration probe is immersed into the approximate center of the blood volume.
6. Calibration:
The DigiMAC3 calibrator is used for calibration of the cobas m 511 system. The
calibrator is a stable suspension of cells of human or animal origin. It is used for
calibrating the following hematology parameters of the cobas m 511 system: WBC, RBC,
MCH, MCV, PLT, and MPV.
7. Quality Control:
DigiMAC3 controls are hematology quality control (QC) materials which consist of
stable suspensions of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets of human or animal
origin. There are three levels of controls (L1, L2 and L3), which are used in conjunction
with each other for monitoring the performance of the cobas m 511 analyzer.

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
Accuracy and Comparison at Medical Decision Levels
This study was conducted to evaluate accuracy of the cobas m 511 system compared
to reference methods and the Symex XN-10 for samples at medical decision levels for
hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean cell volume (MCV), platelet (PLT) and
reticulocytes (RET). The results of 50 samples from the cobas m 511 system were
compared to the following methods: cyanmethemoglobin for the HGB parameter,
packed cell volume (PCV) for the HCT parameter, and a ratio using the PCV and RBC
count to determine the MCV parameter and Sysmex analyzer for PLT and RET
paremeters. Bias to the applicable method and its 95% CI were determined both
separately and combined using data obtained from each cobas m 511 system and each
medical decision level studied. All results were within the predefined acceptance
criteria.

Accuracy for Leukopenia Samples
This study was conducted to evaluate accuracy of the cobas m 511 system compared
to the 200-cell manual differential of leukopenia samples performed by two medical
technologists using the reference method. Ten granulocytopenia samples with
granulocytes ≤ 1.5 x 103/μL and 20 leukopenia samples with white blood cell counts
≤ 4.0 x 103/μL were included in the analysis. For both the test and reference methods,
the five WBC differential parameters, nucleated red blood cells and
immature/abnormal cell types (e.g. blast and immature granulocytes) were
differentiated and enumerated. Sensitivity and specificity were caluculated for the
detection of distributional and morphological abnormalities for the cobas m 511
image, automated differential, system messages and slides versus the reference
method. The test method results were compared with the results of the reference
method to assess bias. The results met the overall acceptance criteria.
b. Method Comparison:
Method Comparison of Subjects with Medical Conditions
This study was conducted to demonstrate that results produced by the cobas m 511
system are comparable to those produced by the Sysmex XN-10 analyzer when
samples from patients with specific medical conditions are evaluated. One-hundred
thirty residual whole blood samples were obtained for 23 targeted medical conditions:
leukopenia, leukocytosis, neutropenia, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, lymphocytosis,
eosinophilia, basophilia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis, polycythemia, chronic
myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, acute
lymphocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, lymphoma, sickle cell anemia,
thalassemia, hemoglobin SC disease, hemolytic anemia, multiple myeloma and
septicemia. Each sample was processed in singlicate on the cobas m 511 system and
Sysmex XN-10. Deming regression (slope, intercept, 95% confidence intervals and
correlation coefficient) was performed according to CLSI EP09-A3. The results met
the predefined acceptance criteria.
Method Comparison
Method comparison studies were performed at five clinical sites (three sites in U.S.
and two sites in the European Union) to evaluatethe performance of the cobas m 511
system compared to the Sysmex XN-10analyzer using a total of 1,859 residual
K EDTA venous whole blood samples.This study included both pediatric (neonateto
2
≤ 21 years) and adult subjects,as well as samples from patients with hematologic
conditions and ditributional abnormalities (anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia,
leukocytosis, elevated hematocrit, elevated nucleated red blood cells).
Bias was determined based on the results of either a Passing-Bablok or Deming
regression model. For all parameters, except those with an expected large number of
valid results of zero (i.e., %EO, #EO, %BASO and #BASO), the Passing-Bablok
regression model was used to determine the intercept and slope of the regression line.
12

--- Page 13 ---
For those parameters with a large number of valid results of zero, the Deming
(orthogonal) regression model was used. For either regression model used, the sample
size (N), Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r), slope and intercept along with their
95% CIs, and the range of comparative measurement procedure values are reported.
Bias was determined based on the results of either a Passing-Bablok or Deming
regression model. The calculated bias along with its 95% CI are also reported for the
critical bias points at the low end, high end, and crossover point. All results were
within the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

Ψbias was calculated using the mean difference between the cobas m 511 system result and the Sysmex XN-10
Sensitivity and Specificity
For the sensitivity and specificity analysis,the cobas m 511 automated differential,
cobas m 511 system messages and cobas m 511 images were compared to a 400-cell
differential derived from two independent 200-cell microscopic reviews of a blood
smear (reference method). For this analysis, separate 2x2 tables were constructed in
order to determine sensitivity for both morphological and distributional abnormalities.
Results for sample size (N) and numbers of true positives (TP), false positives (FP),
true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN) are reported, as well as sensitivity,
specificity,and efficiency.

Morphological Grading
To determine the performance of the cobas m 511 system (images and slides) with
respect to reporting of morphology grading, data was analyzed using percent
agreement analysis. The morphology grading of 163 sample results from cobas m 511
images and cobas m 511 slides was compared to morphology grading obtained by a
trained independent reviewer (IR) from a single blood smear. WBC morphology,
platelet morphology and RBC size, color and shape characteristics that were graded
using a quantitative grading system (e.g., 0 to 4+ grading scale), the sample size (N),
the number of results that agree (A), the number of results that disagree (D), and the
percent agreement were reported. RBC inclusions (parasites, basophilic stippling,
Howell-jolly bodies, and Pappenheimer bodies) were graded using a present/not
present grading system, the sample size (N), the number of results that agree (A and
D), the number of results that disagree (B and C), the percent positive and negative
agreements (PPA and NPA, respectively), and total agreement are reported. The
results met the predefined acceptance criteria.

c. Precision/Reproducibility:
Two studies were conducted to assess repeatability on the cobas m 511 system. The
first study evaluated inter-intrument precision of whole blood samples and the second
study evaluted within-run precision.
Inter-instrument precision was evaluated using whole blood samples from five
healthy volunteer donors and 21 residual abnormal samples. Eleven replicates were
processed from each sample on three different cobas m 511 systems (33 replicates
total per sample) at one site. Abnormal samples included low and high reticulocyte
counts (%RET ≤ 0.5% and ≥ 5.0%, respectively) and medical decision level samples
including anemia (HGB 6-10 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (PLT ≤ 10 x 103/μL), and
severe leukopenia (WBC 0-2 x 103/μL). The mean, standard deviation (SD) and
percent coefficient of variation (% CV) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals
were calculated for each parameter using a variance component analysis. Within-run
precision (repeatability), between-instrument variability, and total variability (inter-
instrument precision) were analyzed. All results met the predefined acceptance
criteria.
To evaluate repeatability (i.e., within-run precision) whole blood samples were
processed 31 consecutive times on the cobas m 511 system. Residual whole blood
samples were selected for the WBC, RBC, HGB and PLT parameters at targeted low,
middle and high ranges. In addition, samples at medical decision levels of anemia,
thrombocytopenia, severe leukopenia, and nucleated red blood cells were evaluated.
At each of the four sites, 48 samples were targeted for collection (36 residual whole
blood samples and 12 medical decision level samples). Repeatability results were
calculated for all sites combined and all results met their predefined acceptance
criteria.
Reproducibility
Two studies were conducted to assess reproducibility on the cobas m 511 system. The
first study evaluated total precision of a single cobas m 511 instrument at one site and

the second study evaluated total precision of the cobas system across multiple sites.
To evaluate single-site reproducibility, testing was performed using a single cobas m
511 system with three lots of DigiMAC3 stain packs, wash solution, and reticulocyte
stain and three different lots of DigiMAC3 controls. Three different operators
conducted the study over the course of 20 operating days with wo runs per day and
two replicates per run. The following components of precision were evaluated:
repeatability (within-run), between-run, between-day, between-lot, between-operator,
and within-laboratory (total precision). All results met the predefined acceptance
criteria.
To evalute precision at all sites, one lot of control material (L1, L2, L3) was used
across four sites for five days with two runs per day and three replicates per run. The
data generated from this assessment was used to calculate repeatability (within-run
precision), between-day and between-run precision, between-laboratory precision
(includes variability of different systems and operators), and reproducibility (total
precision). For each reported parameter and for each level of control tested, the
sample size (N), mean, SD and %CV of the various components of precision were
calculated along with the 95% CI of the SD and %CV for repeatability and
reproducibility (total precision). All results met the predefined acceptance criteria.

*Parameters were evaluated based on SD.
c. Linearity:
Linearity for RBC, HGB, HCT and WBC was evaluated using fresh whole blood
samples. PLT linearity was evaluated using fresh platelet apheresis samples and
corresponding whole blood samples. Reticulocyte (RET) linearity was evaluated
using residual whole blood samples. Each sample was concentrated and diluted as
necessary to create three separate linearity series, each consisting of a high pool, a
low pool, and seven intermediate concentrations. The low pool concentrations for
WBCs ranged from 0.04–0.07 x 103/μL and the high pool concentrations ranged from
404.8–561.1 x 103/μL. In the linearity series for PLT the low pool concentration
ranged from 0–9 x 103/μL and the high pool concentration ranged from 5000–5130 x
103/μL. The low pool concentrations in each of the three separate linearity series for
RET ranged from 0.01–0.03 x 106/μL and the high pool concentrations ranged from
0.63–0.75 x 106/μL. Each of the nine concentrations, in each of the three linearity
series, was processed to obtain six replicates in each of the closed tube and open tube
modes. Each linearity series was processed in both open and closed tube modes on
three cobas m 511 systems.
Regression analysis was used to assess linearity for first order model (e.g. linear), and
weighted polynomial regression was used to assess linearity for second and third
order models (e.g, quadratic and cubic). RBC achieved linearity with a first order
model while for all other parameters linearity was achieved through polynomial
regression.

d. Carryover:
Carryover study was conducted at targeted thresholds for WBC, RBC, PLT and
samples with a high percentage of blasts. For each of the four sample types, three
independent carryover experiments were conducted at each site using residual high-
target value (HTV) whole blood samples for a total of 48 samples [12 samples for
each of the four categories]. Filtered serum samples were used as low-target value
(LTV) samples. For each experiment at each site, the HTV samples were run three
consecutive times immediately followed by three LTV serum samples. Slides from
the LTV serum samples were reviewed by an external hematopathologist to
determine WBC, RBC, PLT and blast percent carryover from the HTV samples.
Carryover for the cobas m 511 system met all predefined acceptance criteria.
e. Interfering Substances:
The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential interference effects of hemolysis,
lipemia, icterus (unconjugated or conjugated bilirubin), high levels of white blood
cells (WBC > 100 x 109/L) and high levels of platelets (PLT > 1000 x 109/L). Each
interfering substance was tested in a series of six incremental concentrations.
Results showed there were no significant interference effects of unconjugated
bilirubin or conjugated bilirubin up to the maximum tested concentration of 40 mg/dL
for the evaluated parameters.
There were no significant hemolysis interference effects up to the maximum tested
concentration of 1000 mg/dL for evaluated parameters.
Clinically significant hemolysis interference effects were observed at ≥ 672 mg/dL
for HGB and ≥ 792 mg/dL for HCT.
There were no significant lipemia interference effects up to the maximum tested
concentration of 3000 mg/dL for evaluated parameters.
Clinically significant lipemia interference effects were observed at ≥ 1646 mg/dL for
WBC and ≥ 2459 mg/dL for LYMPH #.
High concentrations of white blood cells (up to 100.2 x 103/μL) and high
concentrations of platelets (up to 1166 x 103/μL) did not cause any clinically
significant bias in any of the evaluated parameters.

a. Reference Intervals
The normal adult reference interval for all parameters reported by the cobas m 511
system was established by analyzing whole blood samples collected in K EDTA from
2
a total population of 489 healthy individuals (N=240 males, N=249 females).
A literature reference interval verification study was performed for the pediatric
population. A total of 504 samples were collected from apparently healthy pediatric
patients that ranged from < 1 day old to 18 years (258 samples) and 18 to ≤ 22 years
(246 samples) to support the Intended Use. All samples were collected in K EDTA
2
anticoagulant and analyzed in singlet in the automated whole blood sampling mode.
b. Mode to Mode Comparison
To demonstrate equivalency between results of samples processed in the closed tube
(i.e. automated) mode of operation and the open tube (i.e. manual) mode of operation
on the cobas m 511 system, a comparison study was conducted using 140 residual
samples collected in K EDTA. Correlation and bias between the closed tube and open
2
tube processing mode results were determined based on the results of either a
Passing-Bablok or Deming regression model. For the %NRBC and #NRBC
parameters the mean difference was used to calculate bias. All reportable parameters
that were evaluated met their predefined bias acceptance criteria.
c. Open Mode studies
Precision (repeatability)
To evaluate repeatability in open tube mode performance, 12 residual K EDTA whole
2
blood samples selected at random from the routine laboratory population as well as
two residual whole blood samples with reticulocytes ≥ 5% were used for this study.
Eleven replicates were processed from each random sample on three different cobas
m 511 systems (33 replicates per sample) in the open tube mode. The results from all
three systems were pooled for analysis. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and
percent coefficient of variation (% CV) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals
were calculated for each parameter using a variance component analysis in
accordance with the CLSI EP05-A3 guideline. Within-run precision (repeatability),
between-instrument variability, and total variability (inter-instrument precision) were
analyzed. All results were within the predefined acceptance criteria.
Morphology
To assess the WBC differential parameters and WBC, RBC and PLT morphology in
open tube mode, two studies were conducted using 24 targeted residual K EDTA
2
whole blood samples. The samples were processed in both open tube and closed tube
modes on each of three cobas m 511 systems. Two separate analyses were conducted.
In Part IIA the cobas m 511 system automated WBC differential results for the 24
samples were compared between the open tube and closed tube modes. Correlation
and bias were determined in accordance with the CLSI EP09-A3 guideline. In Part
IIB, each of three medical technologists (MTs) reviewed on the viewing station all of
the cobas m 511 images generated from the 24 samples from all three systems, which
were run in both open tube and closed tube modes. This analysis was conducted to
determine whether WBC, RBC and PLT morphology were consistent between the
24

--- Page 25 ---
two modes and between systems. Two analysis methods were used to evaluate results
from this portion of the study. Agreement analysis was performed for each
morphological characteristic using either a qualitative grading system (e.g., Present /
Not Present) or a quantitative grading system (e.g., 0 to 4+ grading scale). All results
were within the predefined acceptance criteria.
Carryover
Carryover in the open tube mode was evaluated using four residual K EDTA whole
2
blood samples, each selected as a high target value (HTV) sample type. Three
separate experiments were run for each of the WBC, RBC, PLT and blasts samples.
In each experiment, the HTV sample was processed three consecutive times
immediately followed by three tubes of low target value (LTV) samples. The HTV
and LTV samples were run in open tube mode on a single cobas m 511 system. The
LTV samples, were comprised of filtered serum equilibrated to room temperature. By
design, when serum samples are run on the cobas m 511 system, the instrument will
make a slide but will ultimately reject the sample when it is presented at the low-
magnification imaging station because it does not contain sufficient cells for the
imaging microscopes to focus. The LTV slides, however, were retrieved from the
instrument and manually reviewed under a microscope to assess if any carryover was
evident from the three prior runs of HTV samples. Carryover in the open tube mode
for the cobas m 511 system met all predefined acceptance criteria.
d. Limits of Detection, Blank, and Quantitation (LoD, LoB, and LoQ)
This study was conducted to evaluate LoB, LoD and LoQ WBC and PLT parameters
on the cobas m 511 system. The study was conducted using three cobas m 511
systems. To determine LoB, testing was performed on three individual test days,
using five preserved Streck RBC samples which contained no white blood cells or
platelets. These samples were processed two times per test day on each of two cobas
m 511 systems, yielding a total of 60 measurements. To determine LoD, residual
K EDTA whole blood samples with targeted low level values that were greater than
2
the LoB were used. The LoD samples were processed four consecutive times on each
of three cobas m 511 systems, for a total of 72 measurements for both WBC and PLT
samples. To determine LoQ, residual whole blood samples with targeted low level
values that were greater than the LoD were used. The LoB, LoD and LoQ were
successfully determined and met all pre-specified acceptance criteria.

were compared to K EDTA results for all parameters. All acceptance criteria were
3
met, demonstrating equivalency of results between samples collected into K EDTA
2
and K EDTA.
3
To evaluate whole blood samples collected with K EDTA a method comparison
3
study was conducted with 40 abnormal samples on the cobas m 511 and Sysmex XN-
10. Bias was determined based on the results of either a Passing-Bablok or Deming
regression model, except for the %NRBC and #NRBC parameters. For these two
parameters, no regression analysis was used; rather, the bias was calculated as the
mean difference between the cobas m 511 system and Sysmex Analyzer. Results
were within predefined critical bias limits.
f. Venous and Capillary Blood Performance Comparisons
This study was conducted to demonstrate comparability between capillary and venous
blood processed on the cobas m 511 system from the same donor. This study was
performed using 40 paired whole blood samples from healthy volunteer donors.
Blood was drawn twice from each donor, once via venipuncture (venous) and once
via finger-stick (capillary). For all samples, results from the cobas m 511 system were
comparable for capillary and venous blood. Overall, the data demonstrate that both
capillary and venous blood can be processed on the cobas m 511 system and produce
similar results.
To evaluate abnormal capillary whole blood samples on the cobas m 511 system a
method comparison study was conducted with 40 abnormal capillary samples on the
cobas m 511 and Sysmex XN-10. Bias was determined based on the results of either a
Passing-Bablok or Deming regression model, except for the %NRBC and #NRBC
parameters. For these two parameters, no regression analysis was used; rather, the
bias was calculated as the mean difference between the cobas m 511 system and
Sysmex Analyzer. Results were within predefined bias limits.
g. Sample Stability
Sample stability was determined for normal and abnormal samples at two clinical
sites. Normal samples were processed in duplicate at each of the following time
points: baseline (time zero (0)) and after 9, 20, 26, 38, and 50 hours in both ambient
(15ºC–25ºC) and refrigerated (2ºC–8ºC) storage conditions. Abnormal samples were
processed in duplicate at each of the following time points: baseline (time zero (0))
and after 9, 26, and 50 hours in both ambient (15ºC–25ºC) and refrigerated (2ºC–8ºC)
storage conditions. For each time point, results were compared to the respective
baseline (zero (0) hour) results. The combined results from both protocols
demonstrated stability for normal and abnormal samples for 48 hours.
h. Stability of cobas m 511 Slides
This study was conducted to demonstrate that cobas m 511 slides stored for 30 days
produce similar results compared to original (baseline) results, with respect to manual
microscopic reviews for the WBC differential and morphology. The results from all
evaluations performed during this study were successful and met predefined
acceptance criteria. This demonstrates that slides generated by the cobas m 511
system are stable for manual microscopic review for a minimum of 30 days.
