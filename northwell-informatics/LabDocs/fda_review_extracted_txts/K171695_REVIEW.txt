H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
First Sign Multi-Drug Cup Test:
First Sign Multi-Drug Cup Test is a qualitative lateral flow immunoassay intended for the
detection of Amphetamine, Cocaine, and Methamphetamine in human urine at cut-off
concentrations of 500 ng/mL, 150 ng/mL, and 500 ng/mL respectively.
The tests provide only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative method must
be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry
is the preferred confirmatory method. It should be used particularly when the preliminary
result is positive.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. The tests are intended for over-the-counter use.

intended for the detection of Amphetamine, Cocaine, and Methamphetamine in human
urine at cut-off concentrations of 500 ng/mL, 150 ng/mL, and 500 ng/mL, respectively.
The tests provide only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative method must
be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result.. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry
is the preferred confirmatory method. It should be used particularly when the preliminary
result is positive. For in vitro diagnostic use only.

First Sign Drug of Abuse Cup Test Marijuana:
First Sign Drug of Abuse Cup Test Marijuana is a qualitative lateral flow immunoassay
intended for the detection of Marijuana in human urine at cut-off concentration of 20
ng/mL.
The tests provide only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative method must
be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry
is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment
should be used when you get any drug of abuse test result.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. The test is intended for prescription use.

results. A more specific alternative method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical
result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry is the preferred confirmatory method.
Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be used when you get any drug
of abuse test result.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. The test is intended for prescription use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For over-the-counter use (Amphetamine, Cocaine, and Methamphetamine).
For prescription use only (Marijuana).
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable; this is a visually read single use device.
I. Device Description:
First Sign Multi-Drug Cup Test, First Sign Multi-Drug Dip Card Test, First Sign Drug of
Abuse Cup Test Marijuana, and First Sign Drug of Abuse Dip Card Marijuana are lateral
flow, immunochromatographic assays. The First Sign Multi-Drug Cup Test and the First
Sign Multi-Drug Dip Card Test are for the qualitative detection of Amphetamine, Cocaine,
and Methamphetamine in human urine. First Sign Drug of Abuse Cup Test Marijuana, and
First Sign Drug of Abuse Dip Card Marijuana are for the qualitative detection of Marijuana
in human urine. The products are single-use in vitro diagnostic devices, which come in the
formats of Dip Cards or Cups. Each test kit contains a Test Device (in one of the two
formats), a package insert and a urine cup for sample collection. Each test device is sealed
with a desiccant in an aluminum pouch.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Not applicable.
L. Test Principle:
Each assay test is a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay. During testing, a urine
specimen migrates upward by capillary action. If target drugs are present in the urine below
its cut-off concentration, it will not saturate the binding sites of its specific antibody
(monoclonal mouse antibody) coated on the particles. The antibody-coated particles will then
be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the test
line region. The colored line will not form in the test line region if the target drug level
exceeds its cut-off concentration because it will saturate all the binding sites of the antibody
coated on the particles. A band should form in the control region of the devices regardless of
the presence of drug or metabolite in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of -100% cut-off, -
75% cut-off, -50% cut-off, -25% cut-off, cut-off, +25% cut-off, +50% cut-off, +75% cut-
off and +100% cut-off. The samples used in the precision studies were prepared by
spiking drug into negative urine samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by
GC/MS. All sample aliquots were blind- labeled by the person who prepared the samples
and who did not take part in the sample testing. For each concentration, tests were
performed two runs per day for 25 days for each format of the device in a randomized
order by three operators. The results obtained are summarized in the following tables:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable, these devices are intended for qualitative use only.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. A transport simulation study was performed to test extreme shipping
temperatures. The manufacturer claims that the devices are stable at 4 - 30°C (39-
86°F) for 24 months based on accelerated stability studies. Real time stability studies
are ongoing.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity:
To test specificity, drug metabolites and other components that are likely to cross-
react in urine samples were tested using three lots of each format of the device. The
substances were added to drug-free urine and cross-reactivity was determined based
on the lowest concentration that produced a positive result. There were no differences
observed between the two formats.

Interference:
Potential interfering substances found in human urine of physiological or pathological
conditions were added to drug-free urine and urine with target drug concentrations at
25% below and 25% above cut-off levels. These urine samples were tested using three
lots of each device. The compounds in the following table were tested at a concentration
of 100 µg/mL, and did not show positive or negative interference. There were no
differences observed for different device formats.

Effect of Urine Specific Gravity and Urine pH:
To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine pH, urine samples with
1.000 to 1.035 specific gravity or urine samples with pH 4 to 9 in increments of 1 pH
unit were spiked with target drugs at 25% below and 25% above cut-off levels. These
samples were tested using three lots of each device. For all devices, results were all
positive for samples at 25% above cut-off and all negative for samples at 25% below
cut-off.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cut-off
concentration appears in the precision/reproducibility section above (M.1.a.).
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed in-house with three laboratory assistants
for each device format. Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered
clinical samples for each drug. The samples were blind labeled and compared to
GC/MS results. The results are presented in the tables below:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 320 lay persons using
the First Sign Multi-Drug Cup Test and the First Sign Mulit-Drug Dip Card Test. The lay
users had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 21 to
> 50 years. Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations; +/-100%, +/-
75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of the cutoff by spiking drugs into drug-free pooled urine
specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample
was aliquoted into individual containers and was blind labeled. Each participant was
