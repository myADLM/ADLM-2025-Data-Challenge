L. Test Principle:
The FLC test systems are based upon the principles of particle-enhanced
immunonephelometry. Polystyrene particles coated with monoclonal antibodies to human
free light chains, type kappa or lambda, respectively, are agglutinated when mixed with
samples containing FLC. These aggregates scatter a beam of light passed through the
sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the
respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of
known concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
All results met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the N Latex FLC Kappa and N Latex FLC Lambda FLC assays were evaluated
according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP5-A3 guideline. Serum
samples were obtained from commercial sources and samples with values close to normal,
abnormal and very abnormal analyte levels were pooled to achieve target concentrations
spanning the linear range of each FLC assay. In the study, the tests were performed on three
levels of serum specimens, and two levels of controls. These specimens included one sample
within 25% of the cutoff/upper limit of normal for FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda. Testing was
performed on three BN II and three BN ProSpec® instruments with two replicates per run,
two runs per day using one lot of the assay-specific reagents. The precision data was analyzed
according to three-way nested ANOVA and the results of mean (mg/L) and %CV are
summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The studies were performed following the CLSI EP06-A guideline. The linearity of
this assay has been demonstrated using test specimens diluted serially in Kappa or
Lambda depleted plasma or serum to yield 13 levels within the claimed assay range.
Serum and EDTA plasma specimens from healthy donors from a blood bank (one
donor each for Kappa EDTA plasma and serum and one donor each for Lambda
EDTA plasma and serum) were spiked with purified polyclonal FLC Kappa and
FLC Lambda and subsequently diluted with FLC depleted serum or plasma until
concentrations of FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda were below the initial measuring
range. The diluted samples were measured in three independent measurements. The
approximate measuring range of the N Latex FLC Kappa at initial dilution of 1:100 is
3.4–110 mg/L and the approximate measuring range of the N Latex FLC Lambda at
initial dilution of 1:20 is 1.9–60 mg/L.

High Dose Hook Effect:
No high dose hook effect was observed with FLC Kappa samples up 27,100 mg/L or
with FLC Lambda samples up to 57,300 mg/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
In the absence of an international reference standard, the calibration of the assay is
traceable to an internally assigned master calibrator.
Stability:
Shelf-life, opened-vial, on-board BN Prospec and on-board BN II studies were
performed on the N Latex FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda Reagent, on the N Latex
FLC Standard SL, on the N Latex FLC Control SL1 and SL2 and on the N Latex
FLC Supplementary Reagent A and B. All results met stability acceptance criteria
and the product stability claims are listed in the table below:

d. Detection limit:
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ):
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) for N Latex FLC Kappa and N Latex FLC Lambda was
determined on the BN II and BN ProSpec® Systems according to the CLSI EP17- A2
guideline. The limit of quantitation is the lowest concentration of analyte that can be
quantitatively determined with stated accuracy.
All results measured on blank samples for the Limit of Blank (LoB) study yielded results below
the measuring range for both assays. Since Limit of Detection (LoD) is calculated using LoB,
the Limit of Detection is undetermined.
LoQ on BN Systems: FLC Kappa: 0.195 mg/L and FLC Lambda: 0.532 mg/L. The total error
was found to be below 11 % for both methods.
e. Analytical specificity:
The N Latex FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda assays were evaluated for interference
on BN Systems according to the CLSI EP07-A2 guideline. No interferences were
observed with the following tabulated lists of endogenous and exogenous substances
with their corresponding concentration labels as shown below:

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and specificity:
A total of 342 samples were included in the clinical validation study for the N Latex
FLC Kappa and Lambda assay. This validation set included 96 samples from MM
patients, 83 samples from AL patients and 163 samples from non-myeloma patients
with various clinical conditions: 24 samples from polyclonal immunoglobulin
stimulation patients; 16 samples from CKD patients & 123 samples from other

clinical condition patients.
For MM, a total of 259 samples were included in the clinical validation study for the
N Latex FLC Kappa and Lambda assay. This validation set included 96 samples from
Multiple Myeloma patients, and 163 samples from non-myeloma patients with
various clinical conditions.
Clinical sensitivity and specificity summary of the N Latex FLC Kappa and Lambda
Ratio for MM are shown in the table below (using the FLC Kappa and Lambda Ratio
Reference Interval of 0.53–1.51 as cut-off):

Clinical Specificity: 96.9% (95% CI: 93.0 – 98.7%)
For AL, a total of 246 samples were included in the clinical validation study for the N
Latex FLC Kappa and Lambda assay. This validation set included 83 samples from
AL Amyloidosis patients, and 163 non-AL Amyloidosis samples from patients with
various clinical conditions.
Clinical sensitivity and specificity summary of the N Latex FLC Kappa and Lambda

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Reference intervals were determined from a US-population of 201 apparently healthy subjects. The
reference intervals were calculated nonparametrically and represent the central 95 % range of the
population.
The following reference intervals apply for serum and plasma samples from healthy adults:
FLC Kappa: 8.24 – 28.9 mg/L (2.5th – 97.5th percentile)
FLC Lambda: 9.10 – 32.6 mg/L (2.5th – 97.5th percentile)
FLC Kappa/ Lambda Ratio: 0.53 – 1.51 (median 1.0st – 99.0th percentile)
The Package Insert states: “Nevertheless, each laboratory should determine its own reference
intervals since values may vary depending on the individual population studied.”
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
