L. Test Principle:
The cobas Liat Cdiff test uses silica magnetic particle-based nucleic acid extraction and
TaqMan probe-based real-time PCR amplification and detection. The cobas Liat Analyzer
automates and integrates sample purification, nucleic acid amplification and detection of the
target sequence in biological samples. Other than adding the sample to the cobas Cdiff assay
tube, no reagent preparation or additional steps are required. The cobas Liat System consists
of a cobas Liat Analyzer with integrated software for running tests and analyzing the results,
and a single-use disposable cobas Cdiff assay tube that holds all of the sample purification
and PCR reagents and hosts the sample preparation and PCR processes specific for the Cdiff
analyte. The test uses the assay tube as both the sample and reaction vessel. The assay tube
comprises flexible tubing containing all required unit dose reagents pre-packed in tube
segments, separated by pressure-sensitive seals, in the order of reagent use.
During the testing process, multiple sample processing actuators of the analyzer compress the
cobas Cdiff assay tube to selectively release reagents from tube segments, move the sample
from one segment to another, and control reaction conditions such as reaction volume,
temperature, pressure, and incubation time. Precise control of all these parameters provides
optimal conditions for assay reactions, allowing the test to achieve high performance similar
to or better than that of currently available molecular assays. The cobas Liat Analyzer
software controls and coordinates these actions to perform all required assay processes,
including sample preparation, nucleic acid extraction, target enrichment, inhibitor removal,
nucleic acid elution, and real-time PCR. All assay steps are performed within the closed and
self-contained cobas Cdiff assay tube, thereby eliminating the potential for cross-
contamination between samples. The collected data are automatically analyzed and the result
is displayed in the assay report on the integrated LCD touch screen of the cobas Liat
Analyzer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility
The reproducibility of the cobas Liat Cdiff test was established in a multi-site
investigation (two external sites and one internal site) using simulated clinical
samples evaluated across reagent lot, site, operator, and testing day. Overall, 818 tests
were performed in this study, out of which 798 were valid for the study. Only those
valid results were included in the final percent agreement analysis.
Panels consisted of three members: one negative specimen and two specimens with
4

--- Page 5 ---
different concentrations of one strain of toxigenic C. difficile: a low positive
concentration near the limit of detection (~1X LOD), and a moderate positive
concentration (~3X LOD). A run was defined as testing of three replicates of a panel
member. For each of three lots, panels were run on five different nonconsecutive days
by two different operators at each of the three sites.
Table 1 shows the percent agreement to expected results by panel member. Results
were in agreement when a positive panel member had a valid result of Positive (Cdiff
Detected) for the analyte or when the negative panel member had a valid result of
Negative (Cdiff Not Detected) for the analyte. For the ~1X LOD panel members, the
overall percent agreement was 98.5% with a lower bound of the two-sided 95% Score
CI of 96.2%. Overall percent agreement was 99.3% for the ~3X LOD panel member
and 100% for the negative panel member.

Table 2 below presents the overall standard deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of
variation (% CV) of cycle threshold (Ct) values for positive panel members at ~1X
LOD and ~3X LOD concentrations, as well as the variance attributed to individual
components (lot, site, operator, testing day, and within-run). Within-run variation
refers to the variation within a ‘study run’ that consists of the three replicates for a
given panel member processed by the same operator on the same analyzer on the
same day.
Across all components, the total % CV was ≤ 1.9% with respect to the Ct value for all
positive panel members. Within each component, the % CV was ≤ 1.6% across
positive panel members.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Internal Control
A whole organism Internal Control is included in the assay tube and automatically
added to all samples at the start of sample preparation. The cobas Liat Cdiff Internal
Control is a chemically-inactivated bacterium (Bti) that is included in each cobas
Cdiff assay tube and processed along with each sample. The Internal Control checks
for adequate processing of the target bacteria through all steps of the assay and
monitors the presence of inhibitors in the sample preparation and PCR. The cobas
Liat Cdiff Internal Control should be positive in a negative sample and can be
negative or positive in a Cdiff positive sample.
C. difficile External Positive and Negative Controls
Positive Control
The cobas Liat Cdiff Positive Control contains non-infectious DNA plasmids with C.
difficile target sequence. The cobas Liat Cdiff Positive Control verifies the integrity
of reagents in the cobas Cdiff assay tube and proper function of the cobas Liat
Analyzer.
Negative Control
The cobas Liat Negative Control contains no target and monitors potential target
contamination in the workflow or environment.
One cobas Liat Cdiff Positive Control and one cobas Liat Negative Control are run
during the “Add Lot” procedure described earlier. Valid results must be obtained for
both the Positive and Negative Control for the new lot of cobas Cdiff assay tubes to
be validated on the instrument. Additional control runs may be performed after the
“Add Lot” procedure in accordance with local, state, federal and/or accrediting
organization requirements.
Across all sites during the clinical study, a total of 387 QC external control batches
(including both positive and negative controls) were run. Of these QC batches, 376
(97.2%) were valid, two (0.5%) failed due to hardware issues, and nine (2.3%) were
invalid due to reagent or protocol issues.
Sample stability
Unformed stool sample stability was demonstrated by testing C. difficile positive and
negative clinical specimens on the cobas Liat Cdiff test after storage at 15 or 30°C for
two days, and also after storage at 2-8°C for an additional seven days. The study also
evaluated the stability of stool samples re-suspended in cobas PCR media. The results
supported the labeled claims of unformed stool sample stability at 2-30°C for two
days, at 2-8°C for nine days, and the stability of stool sample resuspended in cobas
PCR media for seven days at 2-30°C.

d. Detection limit:
Analytical sensitivity
The Limit of Detection (LoD) for the cobas Liat Cdiff test was determined by
analyzing quantified C. difficile cultures diluted to multiple concentration levels in
negative stool matrix. Two toxigenic C. difficile strains were tested: ATCC
43255(VPI 10463) and R12087 (CDI 196). Negative stool matrix samples were also
run to verify the Limit of Blank (LoB). All C. difficile concentrations were tested in
three replicates each using two unique lots of cobas Cdiff assay tubes. The lowest
level with 100% hit rate was tested with additional replicates to confirm the LOD
level. If the overall hit rate for that level was less than 95%, the panel level above was
tested with additional replicates. The final LOD level was confirmed with at least 21
additional replicates. LOD for this test is defined as the target concentration which
can be detected as positive in ≥ 95% of the replicates tested, based on results
generated by the worst performing reagent lot. The results are shown in Table 3.

Inclusivity
The inclusivity of the cobas Liat Cdiff test was evaluated on 37 toxigenic strains
representing additional toxinotypes. Three replicates per strain were tested at three
times the LOD level (~60 CFU/ml equivalent to 270 CFU/swab) as determined for
ATCC 43255. At this inoculum level, all 37 toxigenic strains were detected. The
tested strains are listed in Table 4.

type of human cell, and 29 Clostridium genus organisms, including non-toxigenic C.
difficile (Table 5 and Table 6). No wet testing was conducted for Clostridium
botulinum; analytical specificity for this organism was predicted using BLAST
program analysis against the GenBank nucleotide sequence database to mimic PCR
amplicon generation.
All bacteria and human cells were spiked to 1 x 106 Units/mL, and all viruses were
spiked to 1 x 105 Units/mL equivalent in stool matrix. Bacteria were quantified in
colony forming units (CFU)/mL, human cells were quantified in cells/mL, and
viruses were quantified in TCID /mL, except for Chlamydia trachomatis, which was
50
quantified in IFU/mL.
The organisms were tested alone or in the presence of two toxigenic C. difficile
isolates spiked at 3X LOD of the cobas Liat Cdiff test. Results indicated that none of
the test organisms interfered with detection of intended toxigenic C. difficile targets.
None of the test organisms produced false positive results in the absence of toxigenic
C. difficile.

substances were tested at levels above what could be reasonably expected to be
collected by a swab in a stool specimen. The amount of interference substance is
expressed as the concentration spiked in the primary stool specimen in Table 8. Two
C. difficile isolates were spiked to 3X LOD of the cobas Liat Cdiff test and used as

Exogenous substances at the highest tolerable concentration with no interference on
cobas Liat Cdiff test are shown in Table 8. Exogenous substances concentrations
higher than listed in Table 8 may generate false negative or invalid results. For fecal
fat, no interference was observed up to 39% (w/v), and for mucin no interference was
observed up to 50% (w/v). For whole blood, no interference was observed up to
100% (v/v), which is equivalent to 100% capacity of the transfer swab.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The clinical performance of the cobas Liat Cdiff test was established in a prospective,
multi-site investigation in comparison to the combined results of direct and broth
enriched toxigenic culture using leftover, de-identified, unformed stool samples from
patients suspected of having C. difficile infection.
Nine study sites from geographically diverse locations participated in this study.
Nineteen operators distributed across these study sites performed testing with the
cobas Liat Cdiff test. Reference culture was performed at a reference laboratory.
Discrepant analysis testing was conducted using an FDA-cleared comparator NAAT.
A total of 1188 fresh remnant specimens were prospectively collected from
symptomatic patients suspected of CDI. Of these, 172 were excluded according to the
criteria for enrollment, storage, or cobas Liat Cdiff test processing as defined in the
protocol. Of the 1,016 specimens tested with the cobas Liat Cdiff test, 1.4%

(14/1016) were initially invalid and 0.2% (2/1016) initially had failed results. After
one retest per invalid or failed result following the labeled instructions, the final
invalid rate was 0.1% (1/1016) and the final failed rate was 0% (0/1016). The three
repeat invalid test results were excluded from the final performance analysis.
A total of 1,013 evaluable specimens were included in the study from 483 males
(47.7%) and 530 females (52.3%) with a median age of 59 years (range 5 to 98). All
1,013 specimens had valid results for both combined direct and enrichment culture
and the cobas Liat Cdiff test. Of the 1,013 specimens, 179 were positive for toxigenic
C. difficile using the combined results from direct and enrichment toxigenic culture,
for a prevalence of 17.7% for the study.
Comparison with Combined Direct and Broth Enrichment Culture
The clinical performance of the cobas Liat Cdiff test compared with the combined
results of direct and enrichment toxigenic culture are shown in Table 9. The
sensitivity and specificity of the cobas Liat Cdiff test were 87.2% (156/179; 95% CI:
81.5% to 91.3%) and 98.1% (818/834; 95% CI: 96.9% to 98.8%), respectively; and
the PPV and NPV were 90.7% (95% CI: 85.4% to 94.2%) and 97.3% (95% CI:
95.9% to 98.2%), respectively. Of the 23 specimens with false-negative cobas Liat
Cdiff test results relative to combined direct culture and enrichment culture, 19 were
negative, three were positive and one was invalid by an FDA-cleared NAAT for tcdB
DNA. Of the 16 specimens with false-positive cobas Liat Cdiff test results relative to
combined direct and enrichment culture, 14 were positive and two were negative by
the FDA-cleared NAAT.

Comparison with Direct Culture
The performance of the cobas Liat Cdiff test compared to direct culture is shown in
Table. The positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA)
of the cobas Liat Cdiff test compared to the direct culture for all 1,013 specimens
were 94.6% (139/147) and 96.2% (833/866), respectively. Of the eight specimens
with false-negative cobas Liat Cdiff test results relative to direct culture, seven were
negative and one was positive by a second NAAT method. Of the 33 specimens with
false-positive cobas Liat Cdiff test results relative to direct culture, only 17 were
tested with the second NAAT method: 14 were positive and three were negative by
that second NAAT method. The remaining 16/33 specimens were positive by
enriched culture and hence not tested with the second NAAT method per the
discrepant analysis protocol.

3. Specimen Identification:
A sample barcode is scanned or a sample ID entered into the cobas Liat System during
the assay run process. After scanning the sample barcode, the corresponding sample is
loaded directly into a cobas Liat Tube using a transfer pipette. After the tube is capped,
the tube barcodes is scanned by the cobas Liat System and the tube is inserted into the
system to start the test.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimen sampling and handling during the assay is controlled automatically using
multiple sample processing modules contained within the cobasLiat System. The sample
processing modules are composed of two assemblies, a moving side assembly comprised
of multiple sample processing plungers and clamps and a fixed side assembly. When
performing an assay, a cobasLiat Tube is inserted into the tube slot of a cobasLiat
System. The plungers and clamps selectively compress the cobasLiat Tube segments
against the fixed side assembly to release reagents from the segments, move the sample
from one segment to another, and control reaction conditions.
5. Calibration:
Not required. The cobas Liat Tube is single use and part of a closed system.
