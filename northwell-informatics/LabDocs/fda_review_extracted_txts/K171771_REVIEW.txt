2. Indication(s) for use:
The ADVIA Chemistry Enzymatic Hemoglobin A1c (A1c_E) assay is an in vitro
diagnostic assay for the quantitative determination of mmol/mol HbA1c (IFCC) and
% HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP) in human anticoagulated venous whole blood and hemolysate
for use on the ADVIA Chemistry systems. Measurement of Hemoglobin A1c is used as
an aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of long-term blood glucose control in patients with
diabetes mellitus, and as an aid in the identification of patients at risk for developing
diabetes mellitus.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
For in vitro diagnostic use.
The ADVIA Chemistry A1c_E assay has significant interference with fetal hemoglobin
(HbF). Samples containing HbF may produce negative bias (lower than actual results)
with the ADVIA Chemistry A1c_E assay. Hemoglobin A1c results are invalid for
patients with abnormal amounts of HbF, including those with known Hereditary
Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin.
Patients with hemoglobin concentrations outside of the acceptable range for the
ADVIA Chemistry A1c_E assay should be assayed by a test employing a different assay
principle.
Any cause of shortened red blood cell survival (for example, hemolytic anemia or other
hemolytic diseases, pregnancy, or recent significant blood loss) will reduce exposure of
red blood cells to glucose with a consequent decrease in HbA1c values. HbA1c results
are not reliable in patients with chronic blood loss and consequent variable erythrocyte
life span.
Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) consists of 2 alpha and 2 gamma chains that are not recognized
by FPOX enzyme which measures N-terminal fructosyl dipeptides on the beta-chain
(refer to Principles of the Procedure). Samples that contain high amounts of HbF, usually
found in some people with thalassemia, in infants, and in some pregnant women, may
yield a lower than expected HbA1c result with this assay.
The Hemoglobin A1c assay should not be used to diagnose diabetes during pregnancy.
Hemoglobin A1c reflects the average blood glucose levels over the preceding 3 months
(i.e., the average life span of a red blood cell) and therefore may be falsely low during
pregnancy or any other condition associated with recent onset of hyperglycemia and/or
decreased red blood cell survival.
The Hemoglobin A1c assay should not be used to diagnose or monitor diabetes in
patients with the following conditions: hemoglobinopathies except as demonstrated to
2

--- Page 3 ---
produce acceptable performance (e.g., sickle cell trait), abnormal red blood cell turnover
(e.g., anemias from hemolysis and iron deficiency), malignancies, and severe chronic
hepatic and renal disease.
In cases of rapidly evolving Type 1 diabetes, the increase of HbA1c values might be
delayed compared to the acute increase in glucose concentrations. In these conditions,
diabetes mellitus must be diagnosed based on plasma glucose concentrations and/or the
typical clinical symptoms.
This test should not replace glucose testing for patients with Type 1 diabetes, pediatric
patients or pregnant women.
Do not use sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate collection tubes as they may interfere with
the results of the ADVIA Chemistry A1c_E assay.

L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA Chemistry hemoglobin A1c assay consists of two separate measurements:
glycated hemoglobin (A1c_E) and total hemoglobin (tHb_E). The two measurements are
used to determine the percent HbA1c (NGSP units) or the hemoglobin A1c_E/tHb_E ratio in
mmol/moL (IFCC units). The individual concentration values of A1c_E and tHb_E generated
by this assay are used only for calculating the %HbA1c or A1c_E/tHb_E ratio, and must not
be used individually for diagnostic purposes.

The anticoagulated whole blood specimen is lysed on the system for the automated
ADVIA Chemistry A1c_E assay or may be lysed manually using the ADVIA Chemistry
A1c_E pretreatment solution to obtain hemolysate for manual ADVIA Chemistry A1c_E
(A1c_EM) assay.
The ADVIA Chemistry A1c_E assay is an enzymatic method that specifically measures N-
terminal fructosyl dipeptides on the beta-chain of HbA1c. In the pretreatment step, the
erythrocytes are lysed and the hemoglobin is oxidized to methemoglobin by reaction with
sodium nitrite. In the first step of the reaction (the ADVIA Chemistry A1c_E reagent 1 (R1)+
sample) , the N-terminal fructosyl dipeptide fragment is cleaved from the hemoglobin beta
chain with a protease. Concurrently, methemoglobin is converted into stable azide-
methemoglobin in the presence of sodium azide and the total hemoglobin concentration is
determined by measuring the absorbance at 478/805 nm. In the second step of the reaction,
fructosyl peptide oxidase (FPOX) is added to react with the fructosyl dipeptide to generate
hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide reacts with the chromagen in the presence of
peroxidase to develop a color that is measured at 658/805 nm.
The ADVIA Chemistry A1c_E assay incorporates a turbidity normalization mechanism
(cHb_E) that is measured at 884 nm to remove the effect of any sample turbidity which could
impact the tHb_E measurement.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Testing was performed with both the automated pretreated and manual pretreated
samples and two calibrations were performed per each method (automated and
manual) over the duration of the study. Data were analyzed consistent with CLSI
document EP05-A3, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative
Measurement Methods. Samples were run in duplicate in 2 runs per day on 3 ADVIA
1800 instruments for 20 days. Testing was performed using 3 lots of reagents per
instrument for a total of 720 results per sample. The pooled data from the study is
shown in the tables below.
Samples consisted of two commercial quality controls (BioRad QC) and four whole
blood patient pools with target values of 5.0% HbA1c, 6.5% HbA1c, 8.0% HbA1c,
and 12.0% HbA1c. The manual and automated methods were assessed and are
summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was conducted based on CLSI EP06-A, Evaluation of the Linearity
of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved
Guideline. A dilution series consisting of 11 levels across the assay range were
prepared by mixing high HbA1c and low HbA1c whole blood pools. Samples levels
evaluated were 2.77, 3.51, 4.25, 4.99, 5.73, 7.21, 8.69, 10.16, 11.64, 13.12, and
14.60% HbA1c (6.73, 14.81, 22.90, 30.98, 39.07, 55.24, 71.41, 87.58, 103.74,
119.91, and 136.08 mmol/mol HbA1c). Three replicates were tested at each level.
The measured values were compared to the expected values. The regression
parameters (slope, intercept, and r2) are the following:
NGSP:
Slope Intercept R2 Concentration Range Tested
1.009 -0.111 0.999 2.77 to 14.60% HbA1c
IFCC:
Slope Intercept R2 Concentration Range Tested
1.009 -0.974 0.999 6.73 to 136.08 mmol/mol HbA1c
The linearity study supports the claimed assay measuring range of 3.8 to 14.0%
HbA1c (18.01 to 129.51 mmol/mol HbA1c (IFCC)).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

certified through the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP).
The NGSP certification expires in one year. See NGSP website for current
certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
The derived results of (%) from the NGSP correlation are calculated from the
individual quantitative results for Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).
The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) units of mmol/mol are
calculated using the Master Equation NGSP (%) = 0.09148 x IFCC (mmol/mol) +
2.152. HbA1c results are provided to the customers using two different units: NGSP
equivalent units (%) and IFCC equivalent units (mmol/mol).
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) testing was conducted in
accordance with CLSI EP17-A2, Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical
Laboratory Measurement Procedures.
The LoB and LoD values were determined by measuring 180 blank measurements
and 180 low-level HbA1c measurement.
To determine LoB and LoD, 4 blank and whole blood low level samples each were
processed using 3 reagent lots and 1 instrument. Testing was performed for 3 days at
5 replicates per day for a total of 60 measurements per reagent lot (180 measurements
total per LoB and LoD).
The detection limits are summarized in the tables below:
Hemoglobin
Limit %HbA1c µmol/L tHb µmol/L A1c
Limit of Blank (LoB) 3.18 60.15 µmol/L 1.77 µmol/L
Limit of Detection (LoD) 3.60 69.42 µmol/L 2.50 µmol/L
The ADVIA® Chemistry Enzymatic Hemoglobin A1c (A1c_E) assay has a
reportable range of 3.80–14.00 % HbA1c (18.03–129.51 mmol/mol HbA1c).
e. Analytical specificity:
Testing to determine the interference bias of various endogenous and exogenous
interferents on the ADVIA A1c_E Assay was performed according to CLSI EP07-
A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline – Second
Edition.
The effect of each interferent listed below was evaluated using a paired difference
analysis that compared HbA1c values of control samples (whole blood without any

Hemoglobin derivative interference
Testing to determine the interference bias of hemoglobin derivatives on the ADVIA
A1c_E Assay was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2, Interference Testing in
Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline – Second Edition.
The effect of each hemoglobin derivative was evaluated using a paired difference
analysis that compared HbA1c values between control samples (whole blood without
any added derivative) and test samples (whole blood spiked with the derivative being
tested). Three replicates were tested at each of two HbA1c levels: 6.5% ± 1.0% and
8.0% ± 1.0%.
Highest Derivative Concentration
with No Significant Interference
Acetylated Hb
(up to 50 mg/dL of acetylsalicylic acid)
Carbamylated Hb
(up to10 mmol/L of Cyanate)
Labile Hb
(up to 1000 mg/dL of Glucose)
To verify that HbA1a, HbA1b, or HbA0 derivatives did not interfere with assay
performance, the sponsor evaluated the assay’s HbA1c recovery of whole blood
patient samples with known HbA1c, HbA1a, HbA1b, and HbA0 concentrations. The
highest concentrations tested with no interference were 1.7, 1.4, and 86.0% for
HbA1a, HbA1b, and HbA0, respectively. The data supports the sponsor’s claim that
HbA0, HbA1a, and HbA1b do not interfere with assay results.
Hemoglobin Variant Testing
Interference testing to determine the effect of hemoglobin variants on the ADVIA
A1c_E Assay was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2, Interference Testing in
Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline – Second Edition.

Anticoagulated (K EDTA) human venous whole blood samples with known
2
concentrations of hemoglobin variant and HbA1c were obtained from NGSP (HbC,
HbD, HbE, HbS, and HbF) and IFCC (HbA2). The effect of each hemoglobin variant
on assay performance was evaluated by analyzing these samples and comparing the
%HbA1c values obtained by using the candidate assay on the ADVIA 1800 to the
comparator %HbA1c values. Comparator values were obtained on the Trinity
Biotech Ultra 2 A1c, with the acception of HbF that was measured on the Tosoh G8
and HbC measured on the Trinity Biotech Ultra 2 A1c and Bio-Rad Variant II Turbo
provided by the supplier of the sample. To obtain values across the assay range, some
samples were combined into pools. Testing was performed in triplicate in the results

b. Matrix comparison:
Testing was performed to demonstrate equivalence between 4 different anticoagulants
in accordance with CLSI EP09-A2.
Matched sets of whole human blood were collected by Siemens Healthcare
Diagnostics in four anticoagulant tubes containing K2 EDTA, K3 EDTA, Na
Fluoride/Na2 EDTA, and Lithium heparin. All samples were native (unaltered).
HbA1c values were measured for each sample using the ADVIA A1c_E assay on the
ADVIA 1800 using 1 reagent lot and 1 instrument. Samples were analyzed in
duplicate. Only the first replicate values were used in statistical analysis.
Regression analysis was used to analyze the measured values using the K2 EDTA
samples as the comparator (i.e., the value plotted on the x-axis).
