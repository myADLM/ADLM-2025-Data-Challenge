H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Alere i Influenza A & B 2 assay performed on the Alere i Instrument is a rapid
molecular in vitro diagnostic test utilizing an isothermal nucleic acid amplification
technology for the qualitative detection and discrimination of influenza A and B viral
RNA in direct nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs and nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs eluted
in viral transport media from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. It
is intended for use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of influenza A and B viral
infections in humans in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. The
assay is not intended to detect the presence of influenza C virus.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the
sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2016-2017
influenza season when influenza A/H3 and A/H1N1 pandemic were the predominant
influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging,
performance characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture
should not be attempted in cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and
culture specimens.

I. Device Description:
The Alere i Influenza A & B 2 assay consists of a single-use Sample Receiver containing the
elution buffer, a single-use Test Base comprising two sealed reaction tubes, each containing a
lyophilized pellet, disposable Transfer Cartridge for transfer of the eluted sample to the Test
Base, the Alere i Instrument to process the sample and to record raw data, and embedded
software to analyze and interpret the data. The test also includes Alere i Influenza A&B
positive and negative external control swabs for quality control purposes. The controls are
also available separately as an accessory item. The Alere Universal Printer and Barcode
Scanner are also available as accessories.
To perform the assay, the Sample Receiver and the Test Base are inserted into the Alere i
Instrument and the elution buffer is automatically heated by the instrument. The sample is
added to the Sample Receiver and transferred via the Transfer Cartridge to the Test Base.
Resuspending the lyophilized pellet contained within the Test Base initiates the target
amplification. Heating, mixing, and detection by fluorescence are provided by the
instrument, with results automatically reported.
The test performs individual amplification reactions for influenza A and B within the Test
Base by targeting regions within the RNA genomes of the two viruses. The amplification
target for influenza A is the polymerase basic gene 2 (PB2); the amplification target for
influenza B is the polymerase acidic gene (PA). Separate results for influenza A and
influenza B are reported by the test. Alere i influenza A & B 2 assay technology is isothermal
and does not require a heat denaturation step to generate a single strand target for
amplification. Instead a thermostable, strand-displacing DNA polymerase, a thermostable
nicking endonuclease, and two oligonucleotide templates (primers) are utilized. Reverse
transcription is also performed in the reaction. The products of Alere i influenza A & B 2
amplification are two complementary oligonucleotides 30-40 nucleotides in length. A
product of this size is of sufficient length to be highly unique amongst genomes. The exact
length of the products depends on the specific placement of the templates relative to one
another and relative to their complementary sequences within the target genome.
The Alere i influenza A & B 2 test uses fluorescently-labeled molecular beacon probes for
sensitive and specific real-time detection. Results (positive, negative, or invalid) are
displayed by the Alere i Instrument. Results are also stored in an on-board archive and are
assigned to a sample ID that has been entered into the Alere i Instrument by the operator, and
the date/time the test was performed. Data can be retrieved and downloaded by the operator
at any time after testing. An external Alere Universal Printer can be attached via USB to the
Alere i Instrument to print test results.
Interpretation of results:
Alere i influenza A & B 2 consists of two fluorescence channels for each tube: ROX for the
influenza A or influenza B channels and FAM for the Internal Control (IC) channel. The
response curves are analyzed within a decision algorithm to form an assay result. Results are
reported to the end user as positive, negative or invalid.

--- Page 4 ---
Quality Control
Alere i influenza A & B 2 contains an internal control in the influenza B reaction tube. The
control has been designed to monitor functionality of the amplification/detection process and
reagents. Detection of the IC occurs via a molecular beacon that specifically detects the
amplified product generated from the IC RNA oligonucleotide. In positive samples where
target amplification is strong, the internal control is ignored and the target amplification
serves as the ‘control’ to confirm that the clinical sample was not inhibitory and that assay
reagent performance was robust. At a low frequency, clinical samples can contain inhibitors
that may generate invalid results.
Procedural Control Valid displayed on the instrument screen indicates that the assay reagents
maintained their functional integrity and the sample did not significantly inhibit assay
performance.
Alere i influenza A & B External Controls are designed for use with Alere i influenza A & B
2 assay. The Positive Control swab is coated with inactivated Influenza A and B viruses dried
onto a swab. The Negative Control swab is coated with inactivated Streptococcus Group C
dried onto a swab. External control swabs are provided with the Alere i influenza A & B 2 kit
and are also available separately.

Reproducibility Study
A reproducibility study of Alere i Influenza A & B 2 was conducted by operators at three
sites using panels of blind coded specimens containing negative, low positive , and
moderate positive influenza A and influenza B samples. Nine operators from three sites
(3 operators per site) participated in the study. The study was conducted over five days
each for the VTM and the Swab Direct panels. On each day of testing each operator
tested a blinded panel of 10 swabs comprised of the following sample types: true negative
(clinical matrix diluent), moderate positive (3x LOD), and low positive (2x LOD) of each
influenza type A and B. Swab samples were prepared using the influenza A and B strains
diluted to the appropriate concentration in clinical matrix diluent.
For VTM samples, the percent agreement with expected results for the influenza A
moderate positive and low positive samples was 100% (90/90) and 98.9% (89/90),
respectively. The percent agreement with expected result for the influenza B moderate
positive and low positive samples was 100% (90/90). All of the true negative samples
(90) generated negative test results. For Direct Swab samples, the percent agreement with

Specimen Stability
To provide data supporting the specimen storage recommendations stated in the product
package insert, an analytical study was carried out to evaluate specimen stability.
Contrived positive nasal swab samples were prepared using the Influenza
A/Texas/250/2012 and Influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 dilutions in pooled negative
clinical matrix with targeted concentrations near the respective limit of detection (LOD)
levels. Mock negative nasal swab samples were prepared using pooled clinical matrix.
Swabs were prepared by coating 10 μL of the virus dilution or clinical matrix onto the
swab. Swab coating was done by lightly scratching the swab surface with the pipette tip
as the dilution was pipetted to ensure liquid was absorbed into the swab tip. All prepared
swabs were tested at N=10 at each of the following three time points/conditions: For
Direct Swabs, Time 0, 3 hours at 30 °C, 22 hours at 2-8 °C. Swabs tested after 22 hours
at 2-8 °C were obtained from the group of swabs stored for 3 hours at 30 °C for a total of
25 hours elapsed before testing. For swabs eluted in VTM, 200 µL was tested according
to the VTM assay procedure at the following time points: 0, 9 hours at 30 °C, 45 hours at
2-8 °C, and 64 hours at 2-8 °C. Positive samples were considered stable as long as they
tested positive in Alere i Influenza A & B 2. Negative samples were considered stable as
long as they generated negative results in the test. Results of the Direct Swab and VTM
stability studies are shown in Tables 4 and 5 below.

Shelf Life
Alere performed a product stability study to generate stability data to support the expiry
assigned to Alere i influenza A & B 2 test kits and control swabs. The test components
were tested at specified time points using the influenza A & B Positive QC LOD
Controls, and influenza Positive Control Swabs as the positive samples. The QC LOD
Controls are approximately 3X the LOD when 50μl of a control is added to the sample
receiver. Elution Buffer, UTM, Negative Controls Swabs, and presumed negative nasal
swabs were tested as negative samples. Table 6 details the sample type and number of
replicates tested at each time point for each condition.

Swab Type Compatibility Study
Alere performed a swab type validation study to establish which swabs are acceptable for
use with the Alere i Influenza A & B 2 assay. Swab samples were prepared using
influenza A and influenza B strains diluted to approximately 3 times the limit of
detection. Swabs were prepared by coating 10μL of the influenza A virus dilution,
influenza B virus dilution or clinical matrix diluent on the swab. Ten samples of each
swab type were prepared for each sample type (influenza A, influenza B, or clinical
matrix). Swab coating was done by lightly scratching the swab surface with the pipette
tip as the solution was pipetted to ensure liquid was absorbed into the swab tip. All swabs
were tested within 10 minutes of coating.
Swabs tested in this study include: Puritan Small Foam Tipped Swab; Puritan Regular
Foam Swab; Puritan Regular Rayon Swab; Puritan Mini Rayon Swab; Puritan PurFlock
Standard Swab; Puritan PurFlock Mini Swab; Puritan HydraFlock Flocked Mini Swab;
Puritan HydraFlock Standard Swab; Copan Mini-tip Nylon Flocked Swab; Copan
Standard Flocked Swab; and Copan Standard Rayon Swab.
All of the swabs, except the Puritan PurFlock Standard Flocked Swab, Puritan PurFlock
Mini-tip swab, and the Copan Standard Rayon Swab generated the expected results for all
ten replicates for each sample type. A precaution has been added to the package insert
warning the Puritan PurFlock Standard Flocked Swab, Puritan PurFlock Mini-tip swab,
and the Copan Standard Rayon Swabs are not acceptable to be used with this assay. All
other commonly used flocked swabs appear to be acceptable.
Viral Transport Media Validation Study
Sixteen common transport media were tested in a VTM validation study to determine if
the particular media type is acceptable for use with VTM specimens in the Alere i
Influenza A & B 2 assay. Presumed negative nasal swabs were eluted in 3 mL of each
VTM type by swirling and mixing the swab for 10 seconds. For each VTM type, n=10
clinical matrix diluent (negative sample), influenza A, and influenza B samples were
tested at a volume of 200 μL on the Alere i Influenza A & B 2 test according to the VTM
assay procedure. Dilutions of influenza A and influenza B were prepared at a
concentration approximately 3 times the VTM limit of detection level in each VTM type
clinical matrix diluent. A VTM was considered acceptable if positive influenza samples
generated positive influenza result and negative samples (clinical matrix diluent)
generated negative results. A summary of the testing is shown in the table 8 below.

d. Detection limit:
The objective of the Analytical Sensitivity Study was to identify the limit of detection
(LOD) of the Alere i Influenza A & B 2 using characterized strains of influenza A
and influenza B. For the purposes of the study, the LOD level was defined as
concentration of influenza A and influenza B that produced positive Alere i Influenza
A & B 2 test results approximately 95% of the time when tested in multiple
replicates.
The Swab Direct Method samples were tested on the Alere i Influenza A & B 2 test
according to the swab direct assay procedure. VTM samples were each eluted into a
separate vial containing 3 mL of UTM. Four swab eluates were combined and mixed
thoroughly by gentle vortex. The four eluates were combined in order to prepare
homogenous sample volume sufficient to test 40 replicates. Each swab eluate was
tested on the Alere i Influenza A & B 2 test according to the VTM assay procedure.
For both methods, Probit analysis was first performed to determine the LOD of the
sample. The LOD was then verified by testing 20 replicates. If 95% or greater
detection was obtained with the concentration then that concentration was considered
the LOD for that lot. If less than 95% positive results were obtained, a 2-fold higher
concentration of virus was tested at n=20 replicates. If the 2x more concentrated panel
resulted in 100% detection, a 0.5x dilution was tested to ensure the LOD is not lower
than the level determined via Probit analysis.
A minimum of 0.3 mL of each dilution was retained at -80°C for determination of the
concentration in targets/mL via qPCR. The empirically determined LOD for each
specimen type and each influenza strain is shown in the table below along with the
corresponding genome equivalents/mL.

e. Analytical reactivity:
Various influenza A and influenza B strains were tested to examine the ability of the
Alere i Influenza A & B 2 to detect a wide variety of virus strains in a clinical setting.
Samples were prepared as swab specimens and tested using the swab direct
procedure.
Dilutions of each virus were prepared in clinical matrix diluent and 10μL of each
dilution was dispensed on to sterile foam swabs. All viral dilutions were run in
triplicate. Swab direct samples were prepared using the influenza A and B strains
diluted in clinical matrix to approximately three times the swab direct limit of
detection levels as defined in the Analytical Sensitivity Study. If initial testing
generated at least one negative result at the initial concentration, a higher
concentration was tested and then diluted 2-fold until negative results were obtained.
The lowest level of each strain that generated positive results on all three replicates
was identified as the lowest level detected by Alere i Influenza A & B 2. A dilution
level was considered positive if all three replicates generated a positive result. At least
one out of three negative results was considered a negative result in the study.
The lowest detectable dilutions were stored frozen at -80 °C until conclusion of
testing each day. This dilution was used to determine concentration in targets/mL via
validated qPCR. A summary of the results of the reactivity testing is presented in the
table 10 below.

Swab samples were prepared using influenza A and influenza B strains diluted to
approximately three times the swab direct limit of detection in clinical matrix diluent.
Swabs were prepared by coating 10μL of the virus dilution onto the swab. Swab
coating was done by lightly scratching the swab surface with the pipette tip as the
solution was pipetted to ensure liquid was absorbed into the swab tip.
A volume of 50μL of each interfering substance was dispensed into sterile tubes.
Blank swabs or influenza A or influenza B inoculated swabs were placed into each
tube in triplicate. Swabs were stirred to absorb all of the liquid into the swab head.
Blank swabs containing only the potentially interfering substance were tested to
determine if the substance causes false positive or invalid results in the assay. None
of the substances were found to affect test performance at the concentrations tested.
False negative results were observed when mucin was present at a concentration of
1% w/v or greater and has been noted in the package insert Limitations section.
h. Microbial Interference:
Alere i Influenza A & B 2 testing was performed in the presence of non-influenza
respiratory pathogens. Vendor provided stocks of influenza A and B strains were
diluted in clinical matrix to approximately three times the swab direct limit of
detection. Contrived swab specimens were prepared by coating 10 microliters of virus
dilution onto each swab. Fifty microliters of each of the three potentially interfering
viruses were dispensed into sterile tubes.
One of the influenza A or influenza B inoculated swabs was placed into each tube
(n=3 influenza A and n=3 influenza B swabs total for each non-influenza virus).
Swabs were stirred to absorb all of the liquid into the swab head. Swabs were tested
immediately as a swab direct sample according to the Alere i Influenza A & B 2 test
procedure. The potentially interfering viruses, the concentrations tested, and the test
results are shown in the table 14 below.

This study demonstrated that RSV may potentially interfere with the ability of the test
to positively identify influenza A or influenza B if present as a co-infection. A
limitation has been added to the package insert to inform the user of such a possible
outcome.
The Sponsor also tested influenza A and influenza B near the LOD when a high titer
co-infection with the other influenza type was present (i.e., influenza A + 30x LOD
co-infection with influenza B or vice versa). All tests produced the expected results
for all replicates (n=3).
i. Carry-over:
To test for the possibility of cross-contamination between runs, samples containing
both influenza A and influenza B were prepared in clinical matrix diluent at
approximately 30 times each strain’s limit of detection level. Swab direct samples
were prepared by coating 10μL of the virus dilution onto the swab. Swab coating was
done by lightly scratching the swab surface with the pipette tip as the solution was
pipetted to ensure liquid was absorbed into the swab tip. VTM method samples were
tested on the Alere i Influenza A & B 2 test according to the VTM assay procedure.
For each testing method (Swab Direct and VTM), testing alternated between positive
and negative samples for a total of 15 rounds (15 positives and 15 negatives) on one
Alere i instrument. All positive and negative daily controls generated the expected

j. Assay cut-off:
Alere i Influenza A & B 2 consists of three fluorescence channels, ROX for influenza
A, FAM for influenza B, and ROX for the Internal Control (IC). Their fluorescent
processes physically occur in two separate tubes: ROX for influenza A in Tube 1
while ROX for influenza B and FAM for the Internal Control in Tube 2. The response
curves are analyzed within a decision algorithm to form an assay result. For each
response curve, the gradient values within the threshold window are compared to the
gradient threshold and the results of this comparison determine the channel result,
“Asserted”, “Not Asserted”, or “Indeterminate”. The gradient threshold (cut-off) in
the algorithm was derived through the data collected to support feasibility and from
verification studies. These thresholds were subsequently verified during the clinical
study performed during the 2016-2017 respiratory season.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable. Performance of Alere i Influenza A & B 2 was evaluated against the

sites, one swab specimen was tested directly on Alere i Influenza A & B 2 according to
product instructions for testing swabs. The other swab was swirled in VTM for 10
seconds and an aliquot tested using the VTM method. The remaining VTM containing
the residual swab was stored refrigerated and shipped to the central laboratory on cold
packs for reference testing.
A total of 1110 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were enrolled in the study. Of those, 36
specimens did not meet eligibility criteria. A total of 1074 nasopharyngeal swab
specimens were considered evaluable. Of the 1074 Subjects that met inclusion/exclusion
criteria, four direct swab samples and eleven VTM samples produced invalid results.
Additionally, there were six VTM samples that were handled outside of protocol
instructions leaving a total of 1070 direct swab specimens and 1057 VTM specimens
evaluable for the purpose of data analysis. Patient age and gender distribution for the
evaluable specimens is presented in table 16 below.
