2. Indication(s) for use:
The CAPILLARYS Hb A1c kit is intended for separation and quantification of the
HbA1c glycated fraction of hemoglobin (in IFCC unit (mmol/mol) and NGSP unit (%))
in venous whole human blood, by capillary electrophoresis in alkaline buffer with the
CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING instrument. Measurement of hemoglobin A1c is
used as an aid in diagnosis of diabetes, as an aid to identify patients who may be at risk
for developing diabetes mellitus, and for the monitoring of long-term blood glucose
control in individuals with diabetes mellitus. The CAPILLARYS Hb A1c kit is intended
for in vitro Diagnostic Use Only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use
Prescription Use Only
The CAPILLARYS Hb A1c kit should not be used:
· for point-of-care use
· in monitoring daily glucose control
· to replace daily home testing of urine and blood glucose levels
· to replace glucose testing in pediatric patients, pregnant women, or patients with
Type 1 diabetes.
· for analyzing samples from patients with total hemoglobin levels of less than 2.9
or greater than 30.5 g/dL and any hemoglobinopathies that may interfere.
· to diagnose diabetes during pregnancy or to diagnose gestational diabetes. HbA1c
reflects the average blood glucose levels over the preceding 3 months (the average
life of a red blood cell), and therefore may be falsely low during pregnancy or any
other condition associated with recent onset of hyperglycemia and/or decreased
red cell survival,
· to diagnose diabetes in patients with the following conditions:
o Any condition that alters the life span of the red blood cells, including
recent blood loss, transfusion, significant iron deficiency, hemolytic
anemia (including hereditary spherocytosis) or other hemolytic diseases,
hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias, as the altered red blood cell
turnover interferes with the relationship between mean blood glucose and
HbA1c values, malignancies or severe chronic hepatic and renal disease.
· In cases of rapidly evolving Type 1 diabetes, the increase of HbA1c values might
be delayed compared to the acute increase in glucose concentrations. In these
conditions, diabetes mellitus must be diagnosed based on plasma glucose
concentration and/or the typical clinical symptoms.

L. Test Principle:
The CAPILLARYS Hb A1c kit uses the principle of capillary electrophoresis in free
solution. With this technique, charged molecules of hemoglobin are separated by their
electrophoretic mobility in an alkaline buffer with a specific pH. Separation of the glycated
HbA1c fraction from other hemoglobins occurs according to the electrolyte pH and
electroosmotic flow.
The CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING instrument has silica capillaries functioning in
parallel allowing 8 simultaneous analyses of HbA1c quantification in a whole blood sample.
A sample dilution with hemolysing solution is prepared and injected by aspiration at the
anodic end of the capillary. A high voltage protein separation is then performed and direct
detection of HbA1c is made at the cathodic end of the capillary at 415 nm, which is the
absorbance wave length specific to HbA1c. Before each run, the capillaries are washed with
a wash solution and prepared for the next analysis with buffer.
The HbA1c concentrations are reported in %HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP) and in mmol/mol
(IFCC) units.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated for the CAPILLARYS Hb A1c kit based on CLSI EP05-A3
using four K EDTA venous whole blood samples with targeted HbA1c
2
concentrations (5.1%, 6.4%, 8.2%, and 12.2%), two quality control solutions (5.1%
and 8%), and two calibrators (5.6% and 10.1%). Samples were analyzed on three
CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING instruments using three lots of reagents. Each
sample was analyzed in duplicate on two capillaries per run, two runs per day for 20
days. The results are shown below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the CAPILLARYS Hb A1c kit was evaluated based on CLSI EP06-
A. Two blood samples, including a normal venous K EDTA whole blood sample with
2
HbA1c concentration at 4.4% (24 mmol/mol) and an elevated HbA1c level venous
whole blood sample with HbA1c concentration at 16.7% (159 mmol/mol) were mixed
within different proportions (5.3%, 6.3%, 7.3%, 8.4%, 9.6%, 10.8%, 12.1%, 13.6%,
and 15.1%) and the mixtures were electrophoresed with the CAPILLARYS Hb A1c
kit. For each mixture, samples were analyzed in triplicate.
The following table summarizes the linear regression results for both NGSP
(%HbA1c) and IFCC units (mmol/mol).

The derived result of the ratio (%) from the NGSP correlation is calculated from the
individual quantitative results for Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The International
Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) units of mmol/mol are calculated using the
Master Equation: IFCC = (NGSP- 2.15) / 0.092. Two different units are provided to
the customers: NGSP equivalent units (%) and IFCC equivalent units (mmol/mol).
d. Detection limit:
The claimed measuring range of 4.4 to 16.6% for the CAPILLARYS Hb A1c kit is based
on linearity, see M.1.b.
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Endogenous Interference
Interference studies were performed to assess endogenous substances that could
interfere with the CAPILLARYS Hb A1c kit. The interfering substances were
evaluated in two venous whole blood K EDTA samples with one sample close to
2
the cut-off value, ~6.3% (45 mmol/mol) HbA1c, and one sample with high levels of
HbA1c, ~8.3% (67 mmol/mol) HbA1c. Test samples were prepared by spiking each
endogenous substance at a single dose to simulate the expected dose into the two
HbA1c samples. Test samples were assayed in replicates of 10 and the mean
concentration for each test sample was compared to the mean concentration of 10
replicates of the control sample. The sponsor defined significant interference as
greater than or equal to 7% mean relative deviation between the test and control
sample.
The highest concentration of endogenous substances tested that show non-
significant interference are summarized in the table below:

the cut-off value, 6.3% (45 mmol/mol) HbA1c, and one sample with high levels of
HbA1c, 8.3% (67 mmol/mol) HbA1c. Test samples were prepared by spiking each
drug at a single dose to simulate the maximum expected dose into the two HbA1c
samples. Test samples were assayed in replicates of 10 and the mean concentration
for each test sample was compared to the mean concentration of 10 replicates of the
control sample. The sponsor defined significant interference as greater than or equal
to 7% mean relative deviation between the test and control samples.

iii. Cross Reactivity with Hemoglobin Derivatives
To study interference from carbamylated hemoglobin, two K EDTA whole blood
2
patient samples with HbA1c concentrations at ~6.3% (46 mmol/mol) and ~8.4%
(69 mmol/mol) were split into two aliquots. One aliquot, at each HbA1c level, was
spiked with 1 mmol/L of potassium cyanate. The other aliquot, at each HbA1c
level, was not spiked and served as a control sample. Samples were then analyzed
on the CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING instrument using the CAPILLARYS Hb
A1c kit. Samples were analyzed in replicates of 10. The sponsor’s definition of non-
significant interference is ≤7% mean relative deviation between the test and the
control sample. The sponsor concluded that carbamylated HbA1c up to 810 mg/dL
(7.2%) does not interfere with this assay.

To study interference from labile hemoglobin, two K EDTA whole blood patient
2
samples with HbA1c concentrations at ~6.2% (44 mmol/mol) and ~8.1% (65
mmol/mol) were split into two aliquots. One aliquot, at each HbA1c level, was
spiked with glucose (50 g/L). The other aliquot, at each HbA1c level, was not
spiked and served as a control sample. Samples were then analyzed on the
CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING instrument using the CAPILLARYS Hb A1c
kit. Samples were analyzed in replicates of 10. The sponsor’s definition of non-
significant interference is ≤7% mean relative deviation between the test and the
control sample. The sponsor concluded that labile HbA1c up to 1970 mg/dL
(18.4%) does not interfere with this assay.
To study interference from acetylated hemoglobin, two K EDTA whole blood
2
samples with HbA1c concentrations at ~6.2% (45 mmol/mol) and ~ 8.5% (69
mmol/mol) were split into two aliquots. One aliquot, at each HbA1c level, was
spiked with acetylsalicylic acid (10 mmol/L). The other aliquot, at each HbA1c
level, was not spiked and served as a control sample. Samples were then analyzed
on the CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING instrument using the CAPILLARYS Hb
A1c kit. Samples were analyzed in replicates of 10. The sponsor’s definition of non-
significant interference is ≤7% mean relative deviation between the test and the
control sample. The sponsor concluded that acetylated HbA1c up to 420 mg/dL
(3.6%) does not interfere with this assay.
To study interference from HbA1a+b, two K EDTA whole blood samples with
2
HbA1c concentrations at ~6.5% and (48 mmol/mol) ~ 8.4% (68 mmol/mol) were
split into two aliquots. One aliquot, at each HbA1c level, was spiked with HbA1a+b
(20 mg/dL). The other aliquot, at each HbA1c level, was without HbA1a+b and
served as a control sample. Samples were then analyzed on the CAPILLARYS 2
FLEX-PIERCING instrument using the CAPILLARYS Hb A1c kit. Samples were
analyzed in replicates of 10. The sponsor’s definition of non-significant interference
is ≤7% mean relative deviation between the test and the control sample. The
sponsor concluded that HbA1a+b up to ≤ 20 mg/dL does not interfere with this
assay.
To study interference from glycated albumin, two K EDTA whole blood samples
2
with HbA1c concentrations at ~6.1% and (45 mmol/mol) ~ 8.7% (68 mmol/mol)
were split into two aliquots. One aliquot, at each HbA1c level, was spiked with
glycated albumin (220 mg/dL). The other aliquot, at each HbA1c level, was without
glycated albumin and served as a control sample. Samples were then analyzed on
the CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING instrument using the CAPILLARYS Hb
A1c kit. Samples were analyzed in replicates of 10. The sponsor’s definition of non-
significant interference is ≤7% mean relative deviation between the test and the
control sample. The sponsor concluded that glycated albumin up to 220 mg/dL does
not interfere with this assay.

iv. Hemoglobin Variant Interference
A hemoglobin variant study was performed using a total of 121 normal and diabetic
whole blood K EDTA patient variant samples known to contain hemoglobin
2
variants HbS, HbC, HbE, HbD, HbA2, and HbF. Testing was performed using the
CAPILLARYS Hb A1c kit on the CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING instrument
and results were compared to results obtained by a NGSP reference method that has
been demonstrated to be free from the hemoglobin interferent (Trinity Biotech
Ultra2 for variants HbS, HbC, HbD, HbE and Tosoh G8 for variants HbA2 and
HbF). The sponsor’s definition of non-significant interference is ≤7% mean
relative deviation between the CAPILLARYS Hb A1c result and the NGSP
reference method. The range of hemoglobin variants and range of HbA1c that
were evaluated are summarized in the table below:

HbS 0.8 % (0.0% – 1.6%) 0.4% (-3.1% – 3.2%)
HbC 0.0 (0.0% – 0.0%) 3.3% (1.0% – 5.7%)
HbD 0.5% (-1.4% – 1.6%) -1.9% (-2.4% – -1.2%)

HbA2 -3.4% (-4.5% – -1.4%) -0.8% (-2.0% – 0.0%)
HbF -3.3% (-4.8% – -1.6%) -2.0% (-5.0% – 0.0%)
Significant interference was defined as ≥ 7% change in HbA1c value in the
presence of the hemoglobin variant relative to control. The results show there is no
significant interference for HbS (≤40.8%), HbC (≤37.6%), HbD (≤41.3%), HbE
(≤26.8%), and HbA2 (≤7.8%) at the concentrations tested in this study.
The software displays the following message if the HbF level is higher than 23%:
“Atypical profile—possible quantitative interference if HbF or variant > 23%.”
The following prominent warning is stated in the package insert:
“A significant negative interference has been observed with fetal
hemoglobin (Hb F) concentrations >23 %. HbA1c results are invalid for
patients with high amounts of Hb F (>23 %) including those with known
Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin.”
The package insert labeling states:
No interference has been observed with HbA1c fraction quantification due to
the presence of major abnormal hemoglobins Hb S (≤ 40.8 %), Hb C (≤
37.2%), Hb D (≤ 41.3 %) and Hb E (≤ 37.0 %). However, due to the number of
variants, the presence of another hemoglobin variant may be observed in the
HbA1c migration zone; in the case of a shoulder on HbA1c, no result will be
reported by the software (as in presence of Hb Bart’s).
