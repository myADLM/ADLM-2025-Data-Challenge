4. Special instrument requirements:
The A1AT Genotyping Test is to be performed using the 384-well Veriti® Dx and 96-well
Veriti® Dx thermal cyclers, and the Luminex 200 instrument.
The xPONENT 3.1 is a software application that is used to view and analyze genotype data
obtained from Luminex 200. The A1AT Genotyping Test ANALYSIS SOFTWARE
conducts control checks on the file, resulting in a final analytical genotype profile for each
sample.
I. Device Description:
The A1AT Genotyping Test is comprised of a single multiplex PCR reaction for amplification of
target DNA sequences followed by hybridization to microspheres and extension of allele-specific
oligonucleotide probes for determination of allelic variants.
The test is composed of four reagent components in sufficient quantity for either 48 or 192 tests and a
CD containing the A1AT Genotyping Test ANALYSIS SOFTWARE.
1. The A1AT PCR Master Mix contains four primer pairs needed for the amplification of four
genomic DNA fragments that contain the 14 allelic variants interrogated by the test. In addition to
the primers, this kit component contains all the ingredients needed for a PCR reaction (nucleotides,
biotin-dCTP, buffer) except the DNA Taq Polymerase that must be purchased independently.
2. The A1AT Beads Master Mix contains 28 individual oligonucleotide probes (two probes per tested
allelic variant, one complementary to the common allele and another complementary to the variant
allele) coupled to color coded beads (carboxylated microspheres from Luminex xMAP®
2

--- Page 3 ---
technology) in addition to the tetramethylammonium chloride containing buffer needed to
guarantee the correct performance of the hybridization.
3. The SAPE Dilution Buffer (phosphate buffer with Tween and ProClin 950) is used to dilute the
SAPE component which contains a streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate required for the labeling
and detection steps for the A1AT Genotyping Test.
4. The A1AT Genotyping Test Software component contains the kit instructions for use (Package
Insert and ANALYSIS SOFTWARE User Manual), the A1AT Genotyping Test ANALYSIS
SOFTWARE, and the A1AT Genotyping Test Luminex Template. This template file contains the
Luminex protocol to run the A1AT Genotyping Test and includes the following information: the
required temperature of the heater (52ºC), the specific bead types to be tested, theassociation
between the bead type and the specific probe (Probe Set and normal or variant), the allowed
doublet discrimination window (DD gate) between 7000 ̶ 20000, the volume of sample to be taken
from each well (90 mL), the minimum number of each bead type to be counted per well (80), and
the maximum time allowed to analyze each well (90 seconds).
The end user of A1AT Genotyping Test assay is required to include one Negative Control
(nuclease free molecular-grade water, not provided as part of A1AT Genotyping Test kit) to
determine run validity. It must be included in each assayrun to check for potential DNA
contamination. It is also recommended, but not required, to include a Positive Control sample
(DNA of known genotype, not provided in the kit) in each assay run.

The assay consists of the following processing steps:
Firstly, target sequences in the DNA (previously extracted from human K2 EDTA anticoagulated
whole blood or from dry blood spots) are amplified using specific primer pairs and biotinylated using
the A1AT PCR Master Mix. As result of this multiplex PCR, four biotin-labeled DNA fragments that
span the 14 allelic variants under analysis are obtained. A 384-well Veriti® Dx (Life Technologies®)
thermal cycler is required for this step.
The PCR products are then denatured and hybridized to oligonucleotide probes coupled to specific
color-coded beads. Each probe type is coupled to a specific bead identifiable by its specific spectral
properties included in the A1AT Beads Master Mix reagent. Two probes coupled to two different
beads are needed for the analysis of each allelic variant, one complementary to the sequence of the
common allele and the other specific for the variant allele. Therefore, A1AT uses 28 color-coded
beads, two color-coded beads per tested variant allele, to simultaneously genotype the allelic variants
in one single suspension array. Each coupled bead is spectrally distinguishable from the other coupled
beads. A 96-well Veriti Dx (Life Technologies) thermal cycler is required for this step.
Hybridized DNA is labeled with a fluorescent conjugate (SAPE, previously diluted in SAPE Dilution
Buffer) with a high binding affinity for the biotin incorporated to the DNA in the amplification step.
This fluorescent labeling step allows the detection and quantification of the hybridization signal by the
Luminex System. This step is also performed using a 96-well Veriti Dx (Life Technologies) thermal
cycler.
In the data acquisition step, the fluorescent signal associated with each specific bead and probe is
detected with a Luminex 200 instrument, allowing the analysis of the mixture of different
oligonucleotide probe-coupled beads one-by-one. The Luminex instrument contains two lasers: one
identifies the color-coded beads, and the other detects the fluorescence emission intensity coming from
the SAPE fluorescent conjugate attached to the biotinylated DNA that is bound to the probes on the
surface of each bead. For each colored bead (i.e. each tested allele), the median fluorescence intensity
(MFI) emitted by at least 80 beads is provided by the Luminex xPonent Software.
Finally, in the data analysis step, raw data from the Luminex System (.csv files containing the MFI
value for each bead type) is processed with the A1AT Genotyping Test ANALYSIS SOFTWARE to
determine the presence or absence (++, +/-, -/-) of each variant allele detected by the A1AT
Genotyping Test.
The A1AT Genotyping Test is indicated to detect and report the presence or absence of 14 allelic
variants found in the SERPINA1 gene.

^ Allelic variants have been reported and classified using the protease inhibitor (PI) nomenclature that assesses A1AT
mobility in isoelectric focusing analysis. Normal A1AT migrates in the middle (M) and variants are designated A–L if
they migrate faster than M, and N–Z if they migrate more slowly. As all the letters of the alphabet are associated with an
specific allelic variant, any novel allele detected is named using the letter of the closest allele variant (towards the anode of
the gel) followed by the birthplace of the first individual reported to carry that novel allele (example: PI* S iiyama) or with
PI* Q0 in the case of a null allele (example: PI* Q0 granite falls).

SOFTWARE allows for the generation of pdf and/or .csv reports summarizing those results. Two different
pdf reports can be generated: one report per sample (individual report) or one report per run or runs
(global report).
MFI values that fall outside of the expected range of intensities are returned as “Invalid Test”. The
proximity between the allelic variants PI* M malton (c.226_228delTTC) and PI* S iiyama (c.230C>T),
can lead to a decrease in the hybridization signal under the following conditions resulting in a ‘no-call’:
When PI* M malton is homozygous (delTTC/ delTTC) then PI* S iiyama cannot be detected.
Conversely, when the genotype for allelic variant PI* S iiyama is homozygous (T/T) then PI* M malton
cannot be detected. The software generates an Invalid Test result for these particular cases as mentioned in
the “Assay Limitations” of the labeling. The potential for hybridization interference is minimal because
the possibility of having two disease associated variants in close proximity in the same sample is rare.
When PI* M malton is heterozygous, the normal genotype for PI* S iiyama is correctly detected by the
A1AT Genotyping Test. However, the A1AT Genotyping Test would not adequately genotype samples
that are compound heterozygous for PI* M malton and PI* S iiyama (i.e. +/- for PI* M malton and +/- for
PI* S iiyama). Samples with mutations of both these allelic variants in the same allele have not been
evaluated since such mutations have not been described in the literature. Based on theoretically expected
results, the labeling indicates that “for a sample compound heterozygous for PI* M malton and PI* S
iiyama, a homozygous +/+ result for either PI* S iiyama or PI* M malton is provided by A1AT
Genotyping Test. Either Sample Result (M malton/S iiyama, M malton/ M malton or S iiyama/ S iiyama)
is associated to a phenotype of severe A1AT deficiency”.
Results for a sample are deemed invalid (“Invalid Test”) when at least one of the allelic variants
genotyping results cannot be called due to "Indeterminate genotype”, “Low signal intensity” or “Low bead
count”. Any Invalid Test will be repeated once. Whether the repeat test yields a valid or invalid result,
testing is considered complete.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
The results of all studies met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Site-to-Site Reproducibility:
To evaluate total variability of the A1AT Genotyping Test, a reproducibility study was
conducted at three sites (LifeShare Blood Centers and Progenika Inc. in the USA, and the
Center for Diagnosis of Inherited Alpha1-antitrypsin Deficiency, University of Pavia, in Italy).
At each site, two operators performed one run per day across three non-consecutive days (three
runs per operator and six runs per site) over at least a twenty-day period, using one lot of Taq
polymerase, one lot of DNA extraction reagents and one lot of A1AT Genotyping Test. Within
a given run, the sample panel was tested in duplicate. The reproducibility of the DNA
extraction steps for the DBS type of samples was also evaluated in this study. The sample
panel consisted of: five whole blood samples of selected volunteer donors representing the PI*
7

--- Page 8 ---
M/PI* S, PI* M/PI* Z, PI* S/PI* Z, PI* S/PI* S and PI* Z/PI* Z genotypes collected in DBS,
11 archived genomic DNA samples covering the heterozygous genotype of all 14 allelic
variants included in the A1AT Genotyping Test, and a synthetic DNA sample (HET2) included
to represent the presence of the M/M iiyama allelic variant not covered by the genomic
samples. The 12 DNA samples were prepared at Progenika and shipped along with the 5 DBS
samples to each site in randomized, blinded, panels.
For each genomic DNA sample and the synthetic DNA sample, a total of 36 replicates were
obtained: three sites, two operators, three runs per operator and samples run in replicates of
two; 3 x 2 x 3 x 2 = 36. For the five DBS samples, the DNA extraction was performed at each
site according to the two methods specified in the A1AT Genotyping Test package insert;
hence, a total of 72 replicates of each DBS sample were obtained over the course of the study.
The two methods are commercial lysis and neutralization solutions method (LN) and the in
house-made BSA/Azide (BA) buffer method. The expected results for 16 of the 17 samples
were confirmed by bidirectional sequencing at Progenika. For the HET2 sample, the
sequencing results were provided by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, USA). The genotype
call, expressed as presence or absence of associated allele for each allelic variant, and Sample
Result, the combination of the alleles detected, for all samples and replicates were determined.
A summary of results of the reproducibility study and % agreement between sites by Sample
Results is shown in the table below. Three sample replicates produced invalid test results due
to processing errors related to improper sealing of the PCR plate (both replicates) and improper
removal of the adhesive film from the plate (one replicate). Upon repeat testing, all alleles were
called correctly as compared to bidirectional sequencing results. There were no invalid test
results.

Lot-to-Lot Variability:
To evaluate the reproducibility of the reagent lots for the A1AT Genotyping Test, a study was
conducted by two operators who tested DNA samples from five patient specimens representing
the PI* M/PI* S, PI* M/PI* Z, PI* S/PI* Z, PI* S/PI* S and PI* Z/PI* Z genotypes in
triplicate using three reagent lots and two instruments. Each operator performed one run per
lot, alternating between two Luminex instruments, on six non-consecutive days over a period
of at least 20 days. A total of 360 replicates were obtained: five samples x two replicates x
three lots x six days x two operators; 5 x 2 x 3 x 6 x 2 = 360. Genotype calls were determined
for all samples and replicates for all reagent lots and the percent of correct calls was calculated.
None of the samples produced invalid test results that required repeating. There are no ‘no-call’
or unknown results. The percent of correct Sample Results for the PI* M/PI* Z, PI* S/PI* Z,
PI* S/PI* S and PI* Z/PI* Z genotypes is 100% for all reagent lots. For the PI* M/PI* S
genotypes, one incorrect Sample Result is obtained (a M/M Sample Result was provided for an
PI* M/PI* S sample), giving rise to an overall correct rate of 98.6% for Lot 3.

DNA Extraction Variability:
To assess the impact of different DNA extraction methods and types of sample collection
matrix on the performance of the A1AT Genotyping Test, 12 donor samples collected both in
DBS and in blood tubes with K2 EDTA anti-coagulant were analyzed. Two DNA extraction
methods, the commercial lysis and neutralization solutions method and the home-made
BSA/Azide buffer method, were tested for samples collected in DBS, and one DNA extraction,
the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit method, was tested for samples collected in K2 EDTA
blood extraction tubes. Additionally, the effect of the use of different sample collection
matrices on the performance of the test was evaluated using two different kinds of filter paper
cards for DBS sample collection, the Whatman 903 Neonate Blood Collection Cards
(K100682) and PerkinElmer 226 filter paper cards (K121864). The test samples include six
wild-type (M/M) and six allelic variants representing PI* M/PI* S (two samples), PI* M/PI* Z
(one sample), PI* S/PI* Z (one sample), PI* S/PI* S (one sample) and PI* Z/PI* Z (one
sample). The three extraction methods were tested using the same DNA polymerase enzyme
lot and A1AT Genotyping Test lot by two operators across three non-consecutive days at a
single site. DNA extraction for DBS was carried out from a 3 mm (1/8 inch) punch per
extraction and the extracted DNA, if not being processed immediately, was stored at 2 8ᵒC.
Each operator performed one run with the extracted DNA per day in duplicate for a total of 12
replicates (3 extractions x 1 replicate x 1 run x 3 days x 2 operators) per sample. The test
samples were also analyzed by bi-directional sequencing. Variant calls were determined for all
samples and replicates for all conditions and the percent of correct Sample Results calculated.
There were no invalid runs and sample repetition was not needed in this study. There were also
no incorrect calls as compared to bidirectional sequencing results and no ‘no-call’ or unknown
results. The percent of correct Sample Results across all the samples, conditions and replicates
was 100%.

The shelf-life stability of the A1AT Genotyping Test was evaluated using three lots of each set
of reagents that were stored at 2- 8ºC for 3, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15 and 16 months after
manufacturing. At each time point of evaluation, 20 replicates of each of the five genomic
DNA samples representing the PI* M/PI* S, PI* M/PI* Z, PI* S/PI* Z, PI* S/PI* S and PI*
Z/PI* Z genotypes were assayed per reagent lot. Sample Results from each time point were

The open-vial (in-use) stability of the A1AT Genotyping Test was evaluated using sets of
reagents from one production lot that had been opened for 3, 6, 7, 9 and 10 months and stored
at 2 ̶ 8°C. The impact of having the A1AT Beads Master Mix at room temperature during plate
dispensing was also evaluated in this study by keeping this component at room temperature for
at least 30 minutes before plate dispensing at each time point. At each time point, twenty
replicates of each of the five genomic DNA samples representing the PI* M/PI* S, PI* M/PI*
Z, PI* S/PI* Z, PI* S/PI* S and PI* Z/PI* Z genotypes were assayed. The percent of correct
Sample Results was 100% for all DNA samples and replicates at every time point as compared
to bidirectional sequencing results. Results demonstrated that the A1AT Genotyping Test is
stable up to 9 months after the reagent vials were first opened and that the A1AT Beads Master
Mix component can be maintained at room temperature (18 ̶ 25ºC) for up to 30 minutes
without affecting assay performance.
Specimen stability:
Genomic DNA from a total of 12 K2 EDTA anticoagulated whole blood samples, representing
the PI* M/PI* S, PI* M/PI* Z, PI* S/PI* Z, PI* S/PI* S and PI* Z/PI* Z genotypes, was
extracted after 10 to 43 days of storage at 2 8 ºC after collection using the QIAamp DNA
Blood Mini Kit and tested with the A1AT Genotyping Test. Results demostratedthat all
samples provided 100% correct Sample Results. Progenika claims that whole blood samples
collected in K2 EDTA can be maintained up to 24 days at 2 8 ºC.
To evaluate the stability of DBS samples, five whole blood samples, representing the PI*
M/PI* S, PI* M/PI* Z, PI* S/PI* Z, PI* S/PI* S and PI* Z/PI* Z genotypes, were collected in
DBS and stored at room temperature away from direct sunlight prior to DNA extraction using
the two methods evaluated in the external reproducibility study. Results show that samples
extracted from 36 to 202 days (or 1.2 months to 6.7 months) after collection provided 100%
correct Sample Results. Progenika claims 180 days (6 months) of stability for the DBS samples
maintained at room temperature away from direct sunlight.
d. Detection limit:
A lower limit of detection (LLoD) study was performed with the aim of determining the lowest
concentration of DNA at which 95% of the sample replicates resulted in correct sample results
by using the Probit Approach described in CLSI EP17-A2. DNA samples from five patient
specimens representing the PI* M/PI* S, PI* M/PI* Z, PI* S/PI* Z, PI* S/PI* S and PI* Z/PI*
Z genotypes were each diluted at nine different DNA concentration levels (0.16, 0.1, 0.08,
0.04, 0.02, 0.0133, 0.0067, 0.0044 and 0.0033 ng/μL) and tested by one operator 20 times
using one thermocycler, one Luminex instrument and one polymerase enzyme lot. A total of
two different reagent lots were used throughout the study. For each reagent lot, a total of 20
replicates for each sample or a total of 100 replicates for all five samples at each DNA level
were obtained. The rates of correct genotype calls and Sample Results were determined for all
replicates per DNA input level and per reagent lot.
The percent of correct results are mathematically converted into cumulative normal probability
units (probits) and fitted by a regression model versus their respective DNA input level, in
order to calculate the hit rate of 0.95 to be reported as the LLoD of each reagent lot used in the
12

--- Page 13 ---
study. The LLoD obtained was 0.0228 ng/μL (95% CI: 0.0183 0.0308) for reagent lot 1 and
0.0310 ng/μL (95% CI: 0.0242 0.0429) for reagent lot 2. Based on the probit analysis of
correct Sample Results for each reagent lot, the A1AT Genotyping Test LLoD is 0.0310 ng/μL
corresponding to a DNA input of 0.155 ng.

An upper limit of detection (ULoD) study was carried performed using two reagent lots to
determine the highest DNA concentration at which 95% of correct calls are obtained. A total of
twenty replicates of each sample were tested with each reagent lot at two DNA concentration
levels, 150 ng/μL and 200 ng/μL. Results demonstrated that that the ULoD of the A1AT
Genotyping Test assay is above 200 ng/μL (an input of 1000 ng of DNA).

e. Analytical specificity:
i. Endogenous Interference:
To evaluate how potentially interfering substances may impact the performance of the
A1AT Genotyping Test, the effects of hemoglobin (500 mg/dL), unconjugated bilirubin (20
mg/dL dissolved in NaOH) and triglycerides (300 mg/dL) were assessed. Five whole blood
samples collected in blood tubes with K2 EDTA from selected volunteer donors
representing the PI* M/PI* S, PI* M/PI* Z, PI* S/PI* Z, PI* S/PI* S and PI* Z/PI* Z
genotypes were evaluated. The substances were spiked into each K2 EDTA whole blood
sample, and the spiked blood samples were then processed according to the standard
procedure, along with the corresponding set of unspiked blood samples. In addition, the
effect of an K2 EDTA short drawn was also examined by using an K2 EDTA tube with 1/5
of the total volume (a 5x final concentration of K2 EDTA in the sample). For K2 EDTA
whole blood samples (spiked and unspiked), DNA extraction was carried out according to
the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit. For DBS samples, Whatman 903 cards were spotted

with the spiked and unspiked K2 EDTA whole blood and DNA extraction was carried out
using the commercial lysis and neutralization solution method. DBS without K2 EDTA
(spotted directly from whole blood) acted as a control for DBS with K2 EDTA blood
samples. A total of five spiked and one unspiked conditions for the K2 EDTA whole blood
samples and five spiked and two unspiked conditions for the DBS samples were tested.
DNA was extracted in triplicate for each condition. The variant calls were compared across
the spiked and unspiked samples to determine if the substances tested lead to alterations in
the Sample Results. None of the samples produced invalid test results that required
repeating. There are no ‘no-call’ or unknown results. The percent of correct Sample Results
for all samples and replicates is 100% as compared to bidirectional sequencing. The results
indicate that none of the potentially interfering substances evaluated affects assay
performance at the concentrations tested.
ii. Cross-reactivity:
To assure the specificity of the four primer pairs (forward and reverse) for PCR
amplification and the 28 oligonucleotide probes for allele-specific primer extension
reactions, BLAST analyses were conducted using the Primer-BLAST tool and the Standard
Nucleotide BLAST tool to evaluate whether primer and probe sequences could hybridize to
other regions in the human genome apart from the expected sequences. Non-specific
amplicons are not predicted for any of the potentially cross-reactive primer pairs, in any of
the A1AT Genotyping Test multiplex PCR reactions. All probes bind to DNA regions with
no described variants or reported polymorphisms in the target population that could
potentially interfere with assay results.
iii. Cross-contamination:
A cross contamination study was performed with one lot of A1AT Genotyping Test to
evaluate cross-contamination and/or carryover occurs between samples or between samples
and the Negative Control during processing in 384-well PCR and 96-well hybridization
plates.
For the Sample-to-Sample cross-contamination evaluation, replicates of genomic DNA
samples representing the PI* M/PI* S, PI* M/PI* Z, PI* S/PI* Z, PI* S/PI* S and PI*
Z/PI* Z genotypes were tested in the PCR plate, alternating between high (200 ng/μL) and
low (0.1 ng/μL) DNA input levels. None of the samples produced invalid test results that
required repeating. There were no incorrect calls as compared to bidirectional sequencing
results and no ‘no-call’ or unknown results. The percent of correct Sample Result calls for
all five samples at low DNA concentration and at high DNA concentration was 100% as
compared to bidirectional sequencing.
For the Sample-to-Negative Control cross-contamination evaluation, replicates of the same
panel samples at the selected high DNA concentration (200 ng/μL) were alternated with
Negative Control samples (DNase free water). The complete checkerboard pattern included
47 alternating pairs for a total of 94 reactions (47 high samples and 47 negative control
samples). Results from these studies demonstrated that no carryover events occurred. The

PCR step to avoid contamination of the adjacent well’ is included in the Package Insert.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison:
Accuracy of the A1AT Genotyping Test was assessed by evaluating a sample panel
representing all heterozygous and homozygous genotypes of each allelic variant and covering
all the possible results provided by the assay. The sample panel consists of 66 clinical samples
(12 clinical K2 EDTA anticoagulated blood samples and 54 archived clinical genomic DNA
samples) and 46 genomic DNAs extracted from cell lines. The sample panel was supplemented
with recombinant synthetic DNA samples representing all the homozygous genotypes for the
A1AT Genotyping Test allelic variants. The allelic variant coverage of the sample panel is
summarized in the table below.

As sequencing is a sensitive technique for A1AT variant detection and it is able to identify
specific rare and null alleles, which are not detected by isoelectrofocusing techniques, results
obtained with the A1AT Genotyping Test are compared to bi-directional Sanger sequencing
instead of the HYDRAGEL 18 A1AT ISOFOCUSING kit. All the DNA samples were
sequenced. For the synthetic DNA samples, the sequencing results were provided by the
supplier (IDT). None of the samples produced invalid test results that required repeating. The
