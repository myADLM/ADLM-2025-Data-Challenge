DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
K171883
B. Purpose for Submission:
Clearance of a new device
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Sysmex America, Inc., Sysmex® UF-5000 Fully Automated Urine Particle Analyzer
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Microscopic analysis of formed elements in urine. The analyzer quantitates the following
parameters: RBC, WBC, Epithelial Cells, Casts, Bacteria, and flags the presence of
Pathologic Casts, Crystals, Sperm, Yeast like cells, and Mucus.
E. System Descriptions:
1. DeviceDescription:
The Sysmex UF-5000 Automated Urine Particle Analyzer is a fully automated urine
particle analyzer that is used in the clinical laboratory to analyze formed elements in
urine samples quantitatively and flag for the presence of particles in the sample. It
provides screening of abnormal samples. The Sysmex UF-5000 reports analysis results
for five quantitative parameters in urine: RBC (Red Blood Cells), WBC (White Blood
Cells), EC (Epithelial Cells), CAST and BACT (Bacteria). It also flags the following
urine elements: Pathologic Cast, Crystal, Sperm, Yeast like cell and Mucus. This flagging
information alerts the operator of the need for further testing and/or review.
The Sysmex UF-5000 is a dedicated system for the analysis of microscopic formed
elements in urine and uses a Microsoft® Windows Operating System. The analyzer
consists of the following units:
· Main Unit which aspirates, dilutes, mixes and analyzes urine samples and
processes data from the main unit and provides the operator interface with the
system
· Sampler Unit which supplies samples to the main unit automatically
· Pneumatic Unit which supplies pressure and vacuum to the main unit

--- Page 2 ---
The analyzer uses five reagents—UF-CELLSHEATH (sheath reagent), UF-CELLPACK
CR and UF-CELLPACK SF (diluents) and UF-Fluorocell CR and UF-Fluorocell SF
(stains). The quality control material is UF-CONTROL.
2. Principles of Operation:
The Sysmex UF-5000 uses the flow cytometry method to analyze particles in urine.
Fluorescent stain is applied to specific characteristics within the cells that are placed in a
suspension surrounded by sheath fluid and then ejected through a nozzle sequentially.
Particles and cells pass through in single file through a sheath-like laminar flow. A blue
semiconductor laser beam is irradiated on the particles and cells stained with a UF
Fluorocell stain and the particle is classified based on the following four types of signals:
1) Forward scattered light: reflects information about the size and permeability of
particles
2) Side scattered light: reflects the thickness and internal structure of particles
3) Fluorescence intensity: reflects the stainability of particles
4) Depolarized side scattered light: reflects the intensity of birefringence of
particles
Cells and particles are detected by forward light scattering, which occurs with objects that
are the same size or bigger than the size of the wavelength of the laser. The Sysmex UF-
5000 laser has a wavelength of 488 nm, which can detect particles as small as 0.488 μm.
Based on the principle of flow cytometry, the Sysmex UF-5000 fractionates particles and
expresses the following parameters quantitatively: RBC (Red Blood Cells); WBC (White
Blood Cells); EC (Epithelial Cells); CAST; and BACT (Bacteria).

--- Page 3 ---
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Samples can be introduced onto the Sysmex UF-5000 using sampler analysis or STAT
analysis. Sampler analysis allows the operator to load the sample tubes into a rack (up to
10 samples per rack), which is automatically transported into the UF-5000 for processing.
The analyzer automatically mixes, aspirates, and analyzes samples. STAT analysis is
performed when the operator analyzes samples by interrupting the sampler analysis, or
when the sample volume is low. In STAT analysis, the operator manually mixes samples
and manually loads the sample tubes individually.
6. Calibration:
Calibration and calibration verification of the Sysmex UF-5000 is performed by trained
field service personnel upon installation, when quality control or system errors indicate
changes in sensitivity parameters, and when major components are replaced. User
calibration is not required.
7. Quality Control:
The control material used for quality control (QC) of the Sysmex UF-5000 is UF-
CONTROL. There are two levels of controls used for routine monitoring of instrument
performance for the following parameters: RBC, WBC, EC, CAST, BACT and Cond.
(Conductivity is not a reportable parameter). UF-CONTROL contains latex control
particles for use in quality control measurement procedure of the Sysmex UF-5000.

Method Comparison
A method comparison study was conducted to demonstrate performance equivalency
between the Sysmex UF-5000 and the Sysmex UF-1000i (predicate device). The
method comparison study included a total of 551 residual urine samples collected
without preservatives across three clinical sites in the U.S. All samples were run in
automated sampling mode in singlet on the UF-1000i analyzer and within 1 hour on
the UF-5000. Samples used in the study covered the full reportable measuring ranges
to the extent possible. When native samples were not available to adequately span the
full analytical measuring range, concentrated, diluted and/or spiked samples were
used.
Patient demographics included both males and females ranging in age from 1 day old
to 97 years of age. A total of 101 normal (no flags) and 450 abnormal (flagged) urine
samples were tested. Weighted Deming and Deming Linear Regression analysis,
including 95% confidence intervals (CI) and estimates of the bias/difference were
calculated for each parameter. In addition, Bland-Altman plots were generated to
show the differences between the two devices for all reportable parameters. The
results of the regression analyses including 95% CI are included in the following
tables:

There are noted technological differences between the UF-5000 and the UF-1000i
(i.e. wavelength used for analyzing urine elements, minimum particle size detected,
measuring channels). In addition, clinical data demonstrate agreement between the
UF-5000 and manual microscopy. For these reasons, the method comparison data for
CAST and BACT were found to be acceptable.
Flagging Comparison
A flagging comparison study was incorporated into the method comparison study to
demonstrate that the flagging capabilities of the UF-5000 are equivalent to those of
the UF-1000i for the following findings: Pathologic Cast, Crystal, Sperm, Yeast like
cell, and Mucus. The agreement of the flagging capabilities was established using the
flagging results obtained from the samples used in the method comparison study.
Samples were divided into two categories: (1) Normal, healthy subjects – No flags
and (2) Abnormal, subjects with positive morphologies/concentrations – Flags
present.
Agreement between the flagging of the UF-1000i (predicate device) and the UF-5000
analyzers was determined using the following calculations:
· Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) = TP/(TP + FN) x 100
· Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) = TN/(TN + FP) x 100
· Overall Agreement = (TP+TN/ TP+FP+TN+FN) x100

Sensitivity and Specificity
Analytical sensitivity and specificity were determined by evaluating the flagging
capabilities of the UF-5000 analyzer against the reference method (manual
microscopy). The study was conducted using the flagging results obtained from the
samples used in the method comparison study. Samples were divided into two
categories: (1) Normal, healthy subjects – No flags, and (2) Abnormal, subjects with
positive morphologies/concentrations – Flags are present. The established reference
ranges for the UF-1000i (predicate device) were used to discriminate between normal
and abnormal results for the UF-5000 and manual microscopy.
The results of the flagging comparison between the manual microscopy and UF-5000
analyzer are presented in the tables below. The following calculations were used:
· Sensitivity = 100 x [TP/(TP + FN)]
· Specificity = 100 x [TN/(FP + TN)]
· Prevalence = 100 x (TP + FN)/TP
· Positive Predictive Value (PPV) = 100 x [TP/(TP + FP)]
· Negative Predictive Value (NPV) = 100 x [TN/(FN + TN)]
· Efficiency = 100 x (TP + TN)/N

The results obtained from the flagging comparison of the UF-5000 to manual
microscopic method met predefined acceptance criteria.
b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability
Repeatability was evaluated using residual natural urine specimens without
preservatives around the low and high end of the analytical measuring range. Ten
replicates of each sample were tested for each parameter (RBC, WBC, EC, BACT
and CAST) using the Manual Analysis Mode of the UF-5000. Testing was conducted
across three sites using three analyzers and two different reagent lots. The precision
(repeatability) performance data met predefined limits for all samples at
concentrations greater than or equal to the predefined limit concentrations. Samples
below the predefined limit concentrations were determined to be acceptable.
Reproducibility
Reproducibility studies were performed to evaluate within-run, between-run,
between-day, between-site, and total imprecision of the UF-5000 analyzer. Testing
was performed across three clinical sites (one operator per site), using two levels of
UF-CONTROL material (Low and High). Each level was run in the Automated
Sampling Mode in duplicate twice each day for 20 days using one reagent lot. The
results of the precision (reproducibility) study met the predefined acceptance criteria.
Results from all sites combined are presented in the table below.

c. Linearity:
Linearity for RBC, WBC, EC, CAST and BACT was evaluated at one site using three
UF-5000 analyzers. Urine specimen pools were created by concentrating, diluting,
and spiking natural urine samples, including a wide range of cell type concentrations
(high and low), to cover the full measuring range for each enumerated parameter.
Eleven evenly spaced concentration levels were tested for RBC, WBC, and BACT.
Five evenly spaced concentration levels were tested for EC and CAST. Each
parameter was tested in three replicates. Regression analysis was used to assess
linearity for first order model (e.g. linear), and polynomial regression was used to
assess linearity for second and third order models (e.g, quadratic and cubic). BACT,
EC, and CAST achieved linearity with a first order model while RBC and WBC
linearity was achieved through polynomial regression.

The UF-5000 demonstrated linearity for RBC, WBC, EC, CAST and BACT
parameters from lower limit to upper limit, and met acceptance criteria for
measurement error.
d. Carryover:
Carryover was evaluated by testing residual urine samples without preservatives with
high RBC, WBC, EC, Cast and Bacteria counts three consecutive times (H1, H2, H3)
followed immediately by testing samples with low counts three consecutive times
(L1, L2, L3). Testing was performed in the Automated Sampling Mode across three
clinical sites. Carryover effect was calculated for each parameter using the formula
(L1-L3)/ (H3-L3) x 100% , where L1 is the first low sample analyzed; L3 is the last
low sample analyzed; and H3 is the last high sample analyzed. The carryover results
for the UF-5000 analyzer met the predefined limits for all parameters across sites.
e. Interfering Substances:
The potential interference effects of hematuria, turbidity (intralipid), and preservative
tubes were evaluated for the UF-5000 by adding different levels of interfering
substances to urine specimens and system diluent. Control baseline pools
(absence/normal concentration of substance) and stock pools with potential

interfering substance were prepared for each test run. Baseline control samples were
included with each interfering substance test run and prepared the same as the test
pool, except the test interferent was replaced with the same volume of solvent used to
prepare the stock test pool. Samples were measured three consecutive times using the
Manual Sampling Mode.
Serial dilutions of intralipid were used to evaluate the potential interference of
turbidity on the UF-5000 for WBC, RBC, EC, CAST and BACT results. Results
demonstrated that there was no significant turbidity (intralipid) interference up to a
concentration of 0.100 g/dL for RBC, WBC and CAST parameters, and up to a
concentration of 0.040 g/dL for EC and BACT parameters. Intralipid concentrations
≥0.200 g/dL caused measurement error due to the high density of the specimen.
Serial dilutions of known high RBC concentrations were used to evaluate the
potential interference of hematuria on the UF-5000 for WBC, EC, CAST and BACT
results. Results demonstrated that there was no significant hematuria interference up
to 98,444.8/μL for EC and CAST parameters, up to 78,117.7/μL for WBC and up to a
concentration of 56,020.7/μL for BACT.
Several different types of preservative tubes, including Iwaki,Greiner Vacuette Urine
Culture, Greiner Vacuette Urine CCM and Sarsteds V-Monovette tubes were used to
evaluate their potential interference effects. System diluent (4 mLs) was delivered to
the control tube and 10 mLs of diluent was added to each preservative tube prior to
analysis on the UF-5000. Results demonstrated that there was no significant
interference seen with the use of Iwaki, Greiner Vacuette Urine Culture, Greiner
Vacuette Urine CCM or Sarsteds V-Monovette tubes for WBC, EC and CAST
parameters.
A significant increase in results was seen with the use of Greiner Vacuette Urine
Culture and Greiner Vacuette Urine CCM tubes for RBC and BACT parameters.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Reference Intervals
A reference interval study was performed to establish a combined male and female
reference range for the UF-5000 analyzer. A total of 237 prospectively collected
random urine samples were collected across three U.S. sites from generally healthy
consenting individuals. Ninety-six samples were excluded due to positive results on
the UF-1000i and/or manual microscopy. The remaining 141 eligible enrolled
subjects, 68 males and 73 females between the ages of 17 and 68 years of age
representative of the United States population (i.e. race demographics), were included
in the final analysis. The mean, standard deviation, and 95% confidence intervals
(non-parametric method) were calculated for the established reference range for the
UF-5000 analyzer. The results of the established combined male and female reference
intervals for the UF-5000 are supported by published literature.

b. Detection Limits (LoB, LoD, and LoQ)
The Limit of Blank (LoB), the Limit of Detection (LoD), and the Limit of
Quantitation (LoQ) were determined for the WBC, RBC, Epithelial Cell, Cast and
Bacteria parameters on the UF-5000 analyzer.
Limit of Blank (LoB)
The determination of the LoB was conducted using the system diluent (UF
CELLPACK) as blank samples. Four blank samples were prepared with five repeat
measurements performed per day for each of the four samples over a period of three
days in the Manual Sampling Mode, resulting in a total of 60 blank measurements for
each parameter (4 samples x 5 reps x 3 days). The mean and SD and LoB were
calculated for each parameter. The LoB was calculated as follows:
LoB = Mean + (1.645 x SD)
Limit of Detection (LoD)
Four low level urine samples without preservative and concentrations in the
approximate range of one to five times the calculated LoB of each parameter were
used to establish the LoD. Each sample was analyzed five consecutive times in the
Manual Sampling Mode, over a period of three days using two reagent lots for a total
of 120 measurements for each parameter (4 samples x 5 reps x 3 days x 2 staining
reagent lots). The mean and SD were calculated for each parameter per reagent lot.
The reagent lot with the maximum estimated value for each parameter was carried
forward to calculate the limit of detection of each parameter. The LoD was calculated
as follows:
LoD = LoB + (1.645 x SD)
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
To determine the LoQ, four low level urine samples without preservatives at
concentrations around the calculated LoD of each parameter were used. Each sample

c. Sample Stability
Stability testing was conducted to demonstrate the stability of urine samples at room
temperature (18–26ᵒC) and refrigerated temperature (2–8ᵒC) on the UF-5000
analyzer. Ten normal urine samples (results with no flags) and 10 abnormal urine
samples (results containing flags) were tested at one site using one analyzer. Normal
and abnormal samples were processed at each of the following time points: baseline
(time zero (0)) and after 6, 23, 24, and 25 hours at refrigerated storage conditions;
baseline and after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours at room temperature. For each time point,
results were compared to the respective baseline results. Acceptance criteria were met
for each storage condition. Results demonstrated stability of 4 hours for urine samples
stored at room temperature (18–26°C) and 24 hours for urine samples stored at
refrigerated temperature (2–8°C).
