L. Test Principle:
The FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose Test Strips (in conjunction with a compatible
blood glucose meter) utilizes amperometric technology to quantitatively measure the glucose
concentration in capillary whole blood samples from the fingertip and in MediSense Glucose
and Ketone Control Solutions.
The FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose Test Strips measures glucose electrically when
used in conjunction with a compatible blood glucose meter. The glucose biosensor is
capable of recognizing the glucose present in whole blood or control solutions by virtue of
the glucose specificity of the enzyme GDH present on the glucose test strip. The electrons
liberated by this reaction are transferred via a co-factor and mediator to the meter where they
are read as a small electrical current. The size of the current is directly proportional to the
level of the glucose in the applied sample. The blood glucose concentration (mg/dL) is
displayed on the reader.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The performance of the FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose Test Strips with the
FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose Meter was established in k140371. The performance
of the FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose Test Strips with the FreeStyle Libre Reader’s
built-in-meter component of the FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System
(P160030) is described below.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision was performed using human venous blood samples (collected
into sodium heparin tubes) adjusted to five blood glucose levels (30-50 mg/dL, 51-
110 mg/dL, 111-150 mg/dL, 151-250 mg/dL, and 251-400 mg/dL). Each glucose

level was tested on 10 FreeStyle Libre Reader’s built-in-meters with 3 lots of
FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose Test Strips. Each sample was tested over 1
day in 10 replicates per meter and per test strip lot, giving a total of 100
measurements per lot for a total of 300 measurements for each glucose level. Blood
samples were also tested by a comparator measurement procedure (YSI 2300 Stat
Plus). Results are summarized below:
Within-run precision
Glucose Level (mg/dL) n Mean (mg/dL) SD (mg/dL) CV (%)
30-50 300 41 2.5 6.2
51-110 300 90 4.0 4.5
111-150 300 128 5.2 4.0
151-250 300 205 8.3 4.0
251-400 300 329 12.0 3.7
Intermediate precision was evaluated using 3 levels of glucose control solution. Each
control level was analyzed in duplicate on 10 meters using 3 lots of test strips each
day for a total of 10 days, giving a total of 200 measurements per lot for a total of 600
measurements for each glucose level. Results are summarized below.
Intermediate: Within-lot precision
Glucose Level (mg/dL) n Mean (mg/dL) SD (mg/dL) CV (%)
Low 600 43 2.2 5.2
Medium 600 90 3.0 3.3
High 600 284 9.7 3.4
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed according to CLSI EP06-A. Three (3) sets of human
venous blood samples (collected into heparin tubes) were adjusted to 9 blood glucose
levels: 21 mg/dL, 48 mg/dL, 84 mg/dL, 122 mg/dL, 198 mg/dL, 269 mg/dL, 346
mg/dL, 403 mg/dL, 497 mg/dL. Each sample was measured with 10 FreeStyle Libre
Reader’s built-in-meters with 3 lots of FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose Test
Strips and the values compared to a comparator method (YSI 2300 Stat Plus).
Results from the regression analysis:
Test Strip Lot Slope Y-intercept R2
1 0.988 0.899 0.997
2 0.992 -0.638 0.997
3 0.986 -0.381 0.997
Combined 0.988 -0.041 0.997
The reportable range for glucose measurements is 20-500 mg/dL. If a sample glucose
level is below 20 mg/dL, ‘LO’ will be displayed on the glucose meter. If a sample
glucose level is above 500 mg/dL, ‘HI’ will be displayed on the glucose meter.

The FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose Test Strips are traceable to NIST SRM
917c, D-Glucose (Dextrose). The method comparison study was performed using the
FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose Test Strips with FreeStyle Libre Reader’s
built-in-meters and YSI 2300 Stat Plus as the comparator method (see Section 2.a.).
Test Strip Stability
Stability of the FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose Test Strips was previously
established in k140371. The test strips have a shelf-life of 18 months at the
recommended storage temperature of 36°F-86°F and relative humidity of 10%-90%.
The test strips are individually wrapped in foil packets; therefore, open vial stability
claims are not provided.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity/assay reportable range in section M.1.b. above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were conducted according to CLSI EP07-A2. Endogenous or
exogenous substances, each at one concentration, were added to venous whole blood
samples (collected into heparin tubes) adjusted to 2 glucose levels (50-100 mg/dL and
250-350 mg/dL). Each test sample containing interferent or control sample without
interferent was measured with 10 FreeStyle Libre Reader’s built-in-meters and 3 lots
of FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose Test Strips as well as by YSI 2300 Stat
Plus. Bias from YSI 2300 Stat Plus was compared between the samples with and
without interferent. Results are shown below.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Altitude study: 3 sets of human venous blood samples (collected into heparin tubes) were
adjusted to 3 blood glucose levels: 60-70 mg/dL, 100-120 mg/dL, and 380-420 mg/dL.
Each sample was measured using YSI as well as 10 FreeStyle Libre Reader’s built-in-
meters and 3 test strip lots at high altitude (10,000 feet) and sea level. The results support
the labeling claims that altitudes up to 10,000 feet have no significant effect on
performance of the FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose Test Strips with the FreeStyle
Libre built-in-meter.
2. Hematocrit study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the
FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose Test Strips with the FreeStyle Libre Reader’s
built-in-meter was evaluated using venous whole blood samples with 15%, 20%, 30%,
42%, 50%, 60%, 65% hematocrit at glucose levels of 60-70 mg/dL, 100-120 mg/dL, 210-
230 mg/dL, 330-350 mg/dL, and 440-460 mg/dL. Measurements were taken with 10
glucose meters and 3 test strip lots as well as YSI. The study supports the claimed
hematocrit range of 15-65%.
3. Sample volume study: A sample volume study was performed using venous whole blood
samples adjusted to 3 glucose levels (60-70 mg/dL, 100-120 mg/dL, 380-420 mg/dL).
The sample volumes of 0.4 µL, 0.6 µL, and 1.0 µL were tested using 10 FreeStyle Libre
Reader’s built-in-meters and 3 lots of FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose Test Strips.
Results of samples at each sample volume were compared to the corresponding YSI
value. The study results support the claimed sample volume of 0.6 µL.
4. Operating conditions: The effect of temperature and relative humidity (RH) on the
FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose Test Strips with FreeStyle Libre Reader’s built-
in-meter was evaluated using venous blood samples adjusted to 3 glucose levels (60-70
mg/dL, 100-120 mg/dL, 380-420 mg/dL). Measurements were taken under 5
environmental conditions (59°F/10% RH, 59°F/90% RH, 104°F/10% RH, 104°F/90%
RH, 75°F/50% RH) using 10 meters and 3 lots of test strips as well as YSI. The study
results support the operating condition claim of 59° to 104° F with relative humidity of
10% to 90%.

--- Page 11 ---
5. Infection control studies: The device system is intended for single-patient use only.
Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter by an
outside commercial testing laboratory. This study was reviewed in P160030 and
demonstrated complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen
disinfectant, Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes (EPA Registration #67619-12).
A robustness study was also conducted demonstrating that there was no change in
performance or in the external materials of the meter after 156 cleaning and disinfection
cycles (each cycle consisted of 1 cleaning wipe followed by 1 disinfection wipe) to
simulate 3 years of device use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the
validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
6. Electrical safety and EMC testing: Electrical safety and EMC testing of the FreeStyle
Libre Reader’s built-in-meter was reviewed in P160030 and found acceptable.
