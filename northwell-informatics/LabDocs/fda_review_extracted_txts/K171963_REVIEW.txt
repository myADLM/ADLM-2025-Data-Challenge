H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV assay is a multiplex real-time PCR (RT-PCR) in vitro
diagnostic test for the rapid and qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A
virus, influenza B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Nucleic acids are isolated
and purified from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens obtained from individuals
exhibiting signs and symptoms of a respiratory tract infection.
This assay is intended to aid in the differential diagnosis of influenza A virus, influenza B
virus and RSV infections in humans and is not intended to detect influenza C virus
infections. Negative results do not preclude influenza A virus, influenza B virus or RSV
infections and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other management
decisions. This assay is designed for use on the Panther Fusion system.
Performance characteristics for influenza A Virus were established when Influenza
A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation.
When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary. If
infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture
should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and
culture specimens.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

4. Special instrument requirements:

I. Device Description:
The Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV assay is a multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-
PCR) in vitro diagnostic test developed for use on the fully automated Panther Fusion system to
detect and differentiate influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) directly
from the nasopharyngeal swab specimens.
The Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV assay involves the following steps:
a) Sample lysis; Prior to processing and testing on the Panther Fusion system, specimens are
transferred to a tube containing specimen transport media (STM) that lyses the cells, releases
target nucleic acid and protects them from degradation during storage.

--- Page 3 ---
b) Nucleic acid capture and elution takes place in a single tube on the Panther Fusion system.
The eluate is transferred to the Panther Fusion system reaction tube containing the assay
reagents. The Internal Control-S (IC-S) is added to each test specimen and controls via the
working Panther Fusion Capture Reagent-S (wFCR-S). The IC-S in the reagent is used to
monitor specimen processing, amplification, and detection. Magnetic particles with covalently
bound oligonucleotides mediate the nucleic acid capture. Capture oligonucleotides hybridize to
total nucleic acid in the test specimen. Hybridized nucleic acid is then separated from the lysed
specimen in a magnetic field. Wash and aspiration steps remove extraneous components debris
from the reaction tube. The elution step elutes purified nucleic acid.
c) Elution transfer and multiplex RT-PCR; Eluted nucleic acid is transferred to a Panther Fusion
reaction tube already containing oil and reconstituted master mix. A reverse transcriptase
generates a DNA copy of the target sequence. Target specific forward and reverse primers and
probes then amplify targets while simultaneously detecting and discriminating multiple target
types via multiplex RT-PCR. The Panther Fusion system compares the fluorescence signal to a
predetermined cut-off to produce a qualitative result for the presence or absence of the analyte.
The positive result for each analyte will be accompanied by the cycle threshold (Ct value).

CLSI guidelines: EP15-A3: User Verification of Precision and Estimation of Bias and
EP05-A3: Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative Measurement Procedures.
L. Test Principle:
The assay detects viral nucleic acids that have been extracted from a patient respiratory
sample. A multiplex Real-time RT-PCR reaction is carried out under optimized conditions
generating amplicons for influenza A, influenza B, and RSV. The Internal Control-S (IC-S)
is added to each test specimen before processing to act as a control for specimen processing,
amplification, and detection. Identification of influenza A, influenza B, RSV, and the IC-S
occurs by the use of target-specific primers and fluorescent-labeled probes that hybridize to
conserved regions in the viral genomes.

The mean and variability analysis between instruments, between reagent lots, between
operators, between days, between runs, within runs, and overall (total) for Ct values is
shown in the table above. Overall %CV was < 4.3%. The greatest source of
variability was from the RSV 1X LoD panel member (within-run % CV of 4.2%).
Overall variability was low and the study demonstrates assay variability within an
acceptable range.
Reproducibility
The reproducibility study was conducted at 3 sites, with two operators at each site. Each
operator performed one run per day using one reagent lot. Testing was performed over
five non-consecutive days at each site using one Panther Fusion instrument. Each
operator tested three replicates of each panel member in every run. The table below
shows the sample panel that was used for the reproducibility study.

Agreement was 100% for Flu A, Flu B and RSV moderate positive panel members and
for the negative panel member tested with the Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV assay.
Agreement was also 100% for Flu A and Flu B low positive panel members tested with
the Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV assay. However, agreement for the RSV low positive
panel member was 97.8% (87/89; 95% CI: 92.2-99.4). The lower agreement observed
using low positive panel members is to be expected, since these panel members were
spiked with a concentration close to the limit of detection (yielding an approximately
95% to 100% detection rate).

The table above shows the variability of the Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV assay between
sites, operator, days, and runs. The largest source of variation was the ‘within runs’ factor
with %CV values ranging from 2.19% to 3.45%. All other sources of variation had %CV
values less than 1.30%. The total performance variability (%CV) across all assay results
was <4%.
The reproducibility study data presented demonstrates an acceptable reproducibility for
this assay.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable; this is a qualitative assay
c. Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods), Stability:
Controls:
The assay contains an internal control (IC-S) which is added to each test specimen. The
IC-S is first added to the Panther Fusion Capture Reagent-S (FCR-S) to make the
working Panther Fusion Capture Reagent-S (wFCR-S). The control material wFCR-S is
added to the specimen after lysis. This control monitors specimen processing,
amplification, and detection. It does not monitor lysis of the sample.
Two external controls are also included with this assay in a single use vial, the Panther
Fusion Flu A/B/RSV Positive Control and the Panther Fusion Negative Control. The
control validity was studied during the Reproducibility Study where a positive and
negative control was tested during every run (30 runs total). All controls produced the
expected result.
Stability:
Stability studies have been performed to support the following claims:

Shipping Stability:
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the exposure to extreme hot or cold
temperatures potentially encountered by the Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV assay
components during shipment would not impact the performance of the assay. One lot
of components and controls for the Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV Assay were tested in
this study. All components were exposed to the extreme temperatures in their final
container closure systems and all of the components of the Panther Fusion Flu
A/B/RSV assay were exposed to the extreme conditions.
The Panther Fusion A/B/RSV Assay components and controls were cycled between the
extreme low temperatures (-40 ±5°C), room temperature (28 ±2°C), and extreme high
temperature (55±5°C). One stress cycle consisted of incubation for at least 9 hours at
extreme high temperatures and then at least 15 hours at room-temperature, followed

by at least 9 hours at extreme low temperature, followed by at least 15 hour incubation
at room temperature (1 cycle = approx. 48 hours). A total of 5 cycles were performed
to evaluate the worst case scenario of shipment to customers.
All runs tested gave the expected result for spiked and un-spiked samples. The Panther
Fusion A/B/RSV Assay and its components are not altered by exposure to extreme hot
or cold temperatures that may be encountered during shipping.
Carryover:
This study was conducted to determine the carry-over (cross-contamination) rate of the
Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV assay when high titer Flu A/B/RSV positive samples are
tested interspersed throughout the runs of negative samples on the Panther Fusion
system.
One run was comprised of 100 negative samples (baseline run), followed by three runs
comprised of 50 positive samples and 50 negative samples in a checkerboard pattern
(positive and negative samples loaded in alternate order).
Negative samples were comprised of simulated clinical matrix in VTM. Positive
samples consisted of simulated clinical matrix in VTM spiked with Flu A at 104
TCID50/mL (over 10,000X LoD). Testing was completed on three Panther Fusion
systems using one lot of reagents.

Baseline runs comprised of negative samples showed 0% positivity for all targets, for
all three instruments. All positive samples from the checkerboard runs (runs 2-4) were
Flu A positive. Two negative samples from the checkerboard runs were Flu A positive,
for 0.4% overall carryover contamination rate (2/449).
d. Detection limit:
The purpose of this study was to evaluate and verify the analytical sensitivity and Limit
of Detection (LoD) of Flu A, Flu B, and RSV viruses in pooled negative clinical
nasopharyngeal swab specimens when tested with the Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV
assay. Target-specific LoD values were obtained using multiple strains for each targeted
virus. Dilutions of two strains of Flu A H1, two strains of Flu A H3, two strains of Flu
B, one strain of RSV A, and one strain of RSV B in pooled negative clinical
nasopharyngeal swab (NP) specimens and tested with 11-13 replicates per

*Multiple concentrations were tested for some of the strains. Lowest concentration that produced 100%
reactivity for the intended target is shown, unless noted otherwise.
^Strains recommended by FDA to be included in vaccine 2015-2016 and 2016-2017. California/07/2009 and
Switzerland/9715293/2013 were tested as part of the LOD study (VAR-05327).
^^When tested at higher concentration, low level of cross reactivity for the RSV has been observed.
The results from this study demonstrate that the Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV assay is
capable of detecting multiple clinically relevant strains of Flu A, Flu B, and RSV,
including the strains targeted by the Flu vaccine 2015-2017.
Interfering Substances
This study evaluated the performance of the Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV Assay in the
presence of medications, over the counter products, and other potentially interfering
substances. Assay results were evaluated to determine if the presence of potentially
interfering substances in analyte-negative or analyte-positive samples had an effect on
assay performance. Panels made of Simulated Clinical Matrix with potentially
interfering substances were divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was tested un-spiked
and the other aliquot was tested with intended targets (Fu A, Flu B and RSV) spiked at
1-2X LoD. Panels were tested with 3 reagent lots. The substances tested are listed
below:

For all conditions, all spiked panel members were 100.0% positive for intended targets.
All un-spiked panel members were 0.0% positive for all targets other than IC. This
study demonstrates that the substances tested do not interfere with the performance of
the Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV Assay at the concentrations tested.
Competitive Interference:
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that samples tested with the Panther
Fusion Flu A/B/RSV assay that are co-infected with multiple types of targeted
organisms do not inhibit the detection of either one (competitive interference). One

representative strain of each targeted organism (Flu A, Flu B and RSV) was tested.
Co-infection Panels were made by spiking one target organism at high concentration
(1000X LoD) and another target organism at low concentration (3X LoD) in simulated
clinical matrix. Additional panel members were made with one target at high
concentration (1000X LoD) and another target at low concentration (5X – 10X LoD),
if the competitive interference was observed. Testing was completed on one Panther
Fusion system using one lot of reagents. The test panel members are shown below.
Table 16. Competitive Interference study sample panel composition

1 Flu A 3X LoD RSV 1,000X LoD

7 Flu B 10X LoD Flu A 1,000X LoD
8 Flu B 5X LoD Flu A 1,000X LoD
Interference was observed for Flu B in Panel member 3 with Flu B spiked at 3X LoD
(Low) and Flu A spiked at 1000X LoD (high). Panel member 3 was 100% positive for
Flu A (6/6) but 83.3% positive for Flu B (5/6). A second lot of the Panel member 3 was
made and tested for additional 20 replicates. Initial and combined test result was less than
95% for Flu B (92.3%, 24/26). Therefore, two new panel members were made and
tested where Flu B was spiked at a slightly higher concentrations: Panel member 7 (Flu B
at 10X LoD and Flu A at 1000X LoD) and Panel member 8 (Flu B at 5X LoD and Flu A
at 1000X LoD). Both produced 100% positive for Flu B and for Flu A (6/6),
demonstrating that the competitive interference for the Flu B by Flu A is not observed
when Flu B is present at least at 5X LoD in the presence of Flu A at 1000X LoD. This is
acceptable as 5X LoD is a titer that is much lower than what is commonly found in
clinical samples. All the other panel members were 100% positive for both targets.
Results are summarized below.

Cross-Reactivity:
This study evaluated the analytical specificity and sensitivity of the Panther Fusion Flu
A/B/RSV Assay in the presence of non-targeted microorganisms that could be present
in the clinical specimen. Assay results were evaluated to determine if the presence of
spiked microbes in analyte negative or analyte positive specimens had an effect on
assay performance. Panels members were composed of 3-5 different microorganisms
spiked into simulated clinical matrix at either 101-107 TCID50/mL (for virus) or 105-108
CFU/mL or IFU/mL (for bacteria). Each panel member was split into two parts. One
part was spiked with one representative strain of intended targets (Flu A, Flu B, RSV)
to a final concentration of 0.5 log above LoD to assess interference (negative effect on
sensitivity). The other part was left un-spiked to assess specificity. Panels were tested
with 3 reagent lots. Panel descriptions are shown below.

replicates all of which were negative for Flu B, for a final Flu B % positivity of 3.0%
(1/33). This one Flu B positive reaction was likely caused by a rare carryover event,
and not due to cross-reactivity (there is no sequence alignment of Flu B primers with
HSV-1, HSV-2 or hMPV). Panel member 9 was 0% positive for Flu A and RSV, as
expected. All other panel members were 100.0% positive for spiked samples, and were
0.0% positive for un-spiked samples. The final results for all conditions tested are
detailed in the table below.

f. Assay cut-off:
The relative fluorescence units (RFU) range is the difference between maximum and
minimum fluorescent signal seen in a sample during amplification. For Panther Fusion
Flu A/B/RSV positive samples, the amplification curve rises above the background
florescence RFU resulting in a high RFU range for the intended targets. The IC resembles
a positive target and also has a high RFU range. For the Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV
negative samples the amplification curve remains flat resulting in a low RFU range for
the intended targets. This difference in RFU range is the primary criteria used to
distinguish positive and negative specimens. RFU range thresholds were set at 1,000 for
Flu A, 500 for Flu B, 1000 for RSV for determination of positivity in their specific
channels (FAM, ROX, HEX, respectively) and 500 RFU range for IC for determination
of validity in its specific channel (RED677). The RFU range thresholds were set based on
data from multiple RFU readings from known positive samples. The cycle number at
which the amplification curve crosses target specific assigned RFU range threshold value
is called Ct. Target specific Ct will be generated only for positive valid reaction for that
target.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The results of the assay were compared to shell vial culture followed by Direct
Fluorescence Antibody Testing (DFA). For additional details on the composite
comparator please see the “Clinical Studies” section below.
b. Matrix comparison:
The following five commonly used Viral Transport Media (VTM) types were evaluated:
M4, M4RT, M5, M6, and BD UTM (identical to Copan Universal Transport Medium).
Five types of simulated clinical matrix (SCM) were prepared by spiking 2x104 cells/mL
of HeLa cells in to each of five VTM types listed above. Cultured Flu A, Flu B, and
RSV were then spiked into each VTM type at concentrations 1log below LoD, 0.5 log
above LoD and 1 log above LoD to prepare the VTM panel. Panel was tested once right
after sample spiking (T=0) and again after being stored at 2-8°C for at least 72 hours
(T>72 hrs). Testing was completed on four Panther Fusion systems using one lot of
reagents.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
Four clinical sites participated in this study. Each site obtained, processed, and tested
prospectively collected specimens with the Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV assay as well as
performed the comparator shell vial culture/DFA testing. The study was conducted from
October 2016 to March 2017 and 3 lots of reagents were used during the study. Fresh and
frozen samples were tested during this clinical study.
Specimens included in this study were leftover, remnant nasopharyngeal swabs collected
from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The specimen inclusion
criteria were:
· A minimum volume of 1.75mL
· Stored at 2C to 8C for less than 72 hours after collection
· Specimen was collected in appropriate VTM (M4, M4RT, M5, M6, Copan
Universal Transport Medium or BD Universal Transport Medium)
Specimens were excluded if they were deemed unsuitable for reference culture or Panther
Fusion testing. Examples of unsuitable samples are: specimen leakage, unacceptable
VTM, storage time or temperature exceeded, etc.
This study collected 2961 clinical specimens, 6 were withdrawn after it was determined
that they did not meet the specimen inclusion criteria and further 25 were withdrawn by
patient request. A total of 61 specimens had invalid results; 54 invalid results on the
Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV and 7 invalid results from the reference testing. The overall
invalid rate for the Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV was 1.8% (54/2930).
The tables below show the performance of the Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV assay, the
data are stratified by analyte: Flu A, Flu B, and RSV. All data below represent
performance for prospectively collected specimens. The data includes 1112 freshly
collected and tested specimens and 1757 samples prospectively collected and stored
frozen until testing.

this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
Hologic has provided sufficient documentation in K171963 for review of software . A
summary of software documentation is described below.
Level of Concern
Moderate
Software Description
There are two software components of the Panther Fusion System that are required to
perform Panther Fusion assays:
· System Software—Panther Fusion System Software includes the Master
Controller Software and instrument firmware. This software is assay independent
and does not include assay specific parameters.
· Assay Software—Assay software contains all the information that is specific to a
given assay (reagent volumes, incubation times/temperatures, sequence of steps,
etc.).
Additionally, the system contains Off-the-Shelf (OTS) software obtained from third
parties.
Device Hazard Analysis
A device risk analysis was performed that accounted for known and foreseeable device
hazards associated with the device’s Intended Use, hardware hazards, software hazards
(including OTS), potential user-induced hazards due to intentional or inadvertent misuse,
and cybersecurity hazards. Hazards associated with the system were placed into two
categories: Instrument Specific Hazards and Assay Specific Hazards. In addition, a risk
analysis was performed to evaluate new consumable items used by the system in order to

--- Page 35 ---
process Panther Fusion assays. A few examples of hazards evaluated for the system
included:
Table 27. Hazards evaluated in risk analysis
Potential manufacturing,
Electric Shock Usability
shipping, and storage
Fire Contamination Cybersecurity
Exposure to barcode Defective ancillaries and
Electro-mechanical
scanner light source accessories
Unintended contact
between operator and Software Environmental
moving parts
Hologic also reported that a risk assessment was performed to ensure updates
implemented within the system software v6.1 (including the related hardware updates) did
not introduce new safety hazards or adversely impact assay performance of approved
TMA assays. The changes assessed in this separate analysis included the software updates
to move from v5.3 to v6.1 for the Panther System and the hardware and software updates
to support the addition of the Panther Fusion module onto the Panther System.
After all potential hazards associated with the system were evaluated for risk, and the
various risk control measures were implemented and verified, an assessment of the
overall risk management activities and the residual risk for the Aptima and Panther
Fusion assays on the system was made. There were no hazards that fell within the
“Undesirable” or “Unacceptable” residual risk regions. Potential hazards were mitigated
to a residual risk rating level of “Broadly Acceptable” or “As Far As Possible (AFAP).”
Software Requirement Specifications (SRS) and Software Design Specifications (SDS)
SRS documents were provided that described the requirements for various components of
the system software relevant for processing of the Aptima and Panther Fusion assays and
the trace matrix of the consolidated SRS. The SRS covered the following (not an
exhaustive list):
Table 28. Software Requirement Specifications provided

It was reported that the process of capturing and analyzing software requirements was an
iterative process covering risk analysis and software architectural design and that SDS
were developed for key software components.
Architecture Design Chart
Detailed information was provided to describe the system architecture, including flow
charts for each of the system components for running the Aptima and Panther Fusion

assays.
Traceability Analysis
A traceability matrix for the system was provided that tracked activities from system
requirements, through instrument and software design inputs, up to verification and
validation of outputs. Risk management traceability matrices were also provided.
Software Development Environment Description
The software development environment description summarized the software
development life cycle, configuration/change management, and comparability
assessments.
Verification and Validation (V&V)
V&V testing was performed with traceability to specific design inputs. System validation
included the collective body of all V&V activities associated with the assay, software,
firmware, hardware, and instrument in order to demonstrate that the device conformed to
defined user needs and Intended Use. According to Hologic, system software
encompassed the following V&V activities: instrument validation, assay verification,
instrument verification, and software verification and validation.
It was stated that the system for use with the Aptima and Panther Fusion assays (with
software v6.1) met user needs, Intended Use, and safety requirements as demonstrated by
the validation testing.
Revision Level History
A list was provided of the software versions generated for the system software as well as
the Aptima and Panther Fusion assay software versions. The revision level history
included the release date and most current version of software-system software version
6.1 and Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV Assay version 2.4.7. Clinical and non-clinical
(analytical studies) for K171963 were conducted with system software v6.0 and Panther
Fusion Flu/A/B/RSV v1.116.
Unresolved Anomalies
A summary of unresolved anomalies in the system software up to the current release
version (6.1) was documented in the Summary Anomaly Report for Panther and Panther
Fusion System Software. The report contained a complete list of open anomalies in the
Panther/Panther Fusion system software, v6.1 that were reported up through completion
of software V&V testing. Each software anomaly was assessed for impact to patient and
user safety, and it was determined that there were no known software anomalies that
exceeded the severity level of “Minor.”
Cybersecurity and OTS
A cybersecurity risk analysis was performed as part of the risk management process to
ensure cybersecurity hazards were minimized and controlled. Hazard analysis for OTS
software was conducted as part of the system hazard analysis.
3. Calibration:
Real Time Fluorometers (RTF) undergo a single calibration during manufacturing. No
additional calibration is performed by the end user.
