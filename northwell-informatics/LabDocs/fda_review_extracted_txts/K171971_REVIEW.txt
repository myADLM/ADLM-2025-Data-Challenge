The Comprehensive Metabolic Panel contains a set of dried reagents that are used in
the quantitative testing of various substances in the blood sample. The
Comprehensive Metabolic Panel reagent discs are designed to separate a heparinized
venous whole blood sample into plasma and blood cells, quantity the amount of
plasma and diluent through the metering function of disc, mix both of plasma and
diluent, and deliver the mixture to each reaction wells where the dried reagent are
present to initiate the chemical reactions that are then measured by analyzer.
Alternately, the disc may also be used with heparinized plasma only and serum
sample.
The skyla Clinical Chemistry System consists of a portable analyzer and single-use
disposable reagent panel discs. The analyzers utilize precision photometric
measurement technology, combined with the use of specific reagent panel disc, to
measure the amount of substance in blood. The analyzer measures absorbance change
of each reaction well in reagent panel disc and covert it to a concentration value for
each analyte included on the panel.
The analyzer contains the following features and components:
· Compatibility with lithium-heparinized venous whole blood samples without
the need for sample dilution.
· Operation by a colored touchscreen panel
· Fully automated system for simple operation
· Rapid analysis, reporting test results in approximately 15 minutes

L. Test Principle:
ALP activity is enzymatically determined. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate that is hydrolyzed by
ALP into a yellow colored product p-Nitrophenol which has an absorbance at a wavelength
of 405 nm. The rate of the reaction is directly proportional to the enzyme activity.
ALP
p-Nitrophenyl Phosphate ────→ p-Nitrophenol + Phosphate
ALT activity is enzymatically determined. ALT catalyzes the reaction of alanine with α-
ketoglutarate, converting them into glutamate and pyruvate. In the presence of NADH,
lactate dehydrogenase converts pyruvate into lactate. In the course of the reaction NADH is
oxidized to NAD+. The decrease of NADH absorbance is measured at a wavelength of 340
nm and is proportional to ALT activity.
ALT
L-Alanine +α-ketoglutarate ────→ Pyruvate + L-Glutamate
LDH
Pyruvate + NADH + H+ ────→ L-Lactate + NAD+ + H2O
AST activity is enzymatically determined. When the test sample reacts with the substrate-
enzyme reagent, AST converts L-Aspartic acid and α-ketoglutarate into monosodium
glutamate and amide acetate. amide acetate is subsequently converted into malate by malate
dehydrogenase while NADH undergoes oxidation to NAD+. The decrease of NADH
absorbance is measured at a wavelength of 340 nm and is proportional to AST activity.
AST
L-asparate + α-ketoglutarate ────→ oxaloactate + L-glutamate
MDH
oxaloactate + NADH ────→ malate + NAD+
BUN is enzymatically determined. Urea undergoes a urease catalyzed hydrolysis, thus
producing ammonia and carbon dioxide. In a glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) catalyzed
reaction ammonia reacts with 2-oxoglutarate yielding L-glutamate. In the process of this
reaction, NADH is oxidized to NAD+ which in turn undergoes a color reaction. The rate of
change of absorbance at wavelength of 340 nm is measured and proportional to the BUN
concentration.
Urease
Urea + H2O ─────→ 2NH3 + CO2
GLDH
NH3 + 2-Oxoglutarate + NADH ─────→ L-Glutamate + H2O + NAD+

CREA is determined through the endpoint enzymatic reaction approach. Creatinine
amidohydrolase hydrolyzes CREA to creatine. Then creatine is converted into sarcosine
through catalysis of creatine amidinohydrolase. Furthermore, sarcosine oxidase oxidizes
sarcosine, yielding glycine, formalehyde and peroxide (H2O2) in the process. The enzyme
peroxidase processes hydrogen peroxide, 2,4,6-3 hydroxy-benzoic acid (TBHBA) and 4-
amine triazolam alternate pyrazol (4-AAP), forming a quinoneimine dye as a product. The
dye formation is measured at wavelength of 546 nm and is proportional to the amount of
creatinine in the sample.
Creatinine amidohyrolase
Creatinine + H2O ───────────→ Creatine
Creatine amidohyrolase
Creatine + H2O ───────────→ Sarcosine + Urea
Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)
eGFR is the kidney filtrate per minute, which is calculated from creatinine results. It is used
to assess renal function. Calculation of the eGFR is performed by the skyla Clinical
Chemistry Analyzer using the patient’s age, gender and race. The equation is shown below.
For African American, multiply the eGFR value by 1.212.
eGFR = 175 x (Scr)-1.154 x (Age)-0.203 x (0.742 if female)
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:

The results of the linearity study support the sponsor’s claimed measuring ranges (as
described in the table above).
e. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The calibrators are traceable to Siemens ADVIA Chemistry analyzer
method calibration to below reference material or method. The calibration
parameters of each test system were established internally, and are unique with
each reagent lot. The calibration information is bar-encoded on each reagent disc.
Assay Reference material / method
The ADVIA ALT method is traceable to the IFCC reference method via
ALT
patient sample correlation.
The ADVIA ALP method is traceable to the IFCC reference method via
ALP
patient sample correlation.
The ADVIA AST method is traceable to the IFCC reference method via
AST
patient sample correlation.
The ADVIA BUN method is traceable to the CDC reference method,
BUN which uses reference materials from the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST). via patient sample correlation.
The ADVIA CREA_2 method is traceable to the IDMS Reference Method
CREA via correlation of patient samples and reference material SRM967 from
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
f. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ)
were determined according to CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. Human serum samples were
diluted with BSA to obtain the blank for the LoB studies and low concentration
samples for LoD and LoQ studies. LoB was determined by running three blank
samples in triplicate on two skyla Clinical Chemistry Analyzers with two reagent disc
lots per day for ten days (N=60). LoD and LoQ were performed using serum
samples containing very low concentrations of the analyte tested in triplicate using 2
lots of reagents disc for ten days (N=60).
The LoB is the 95th percentile value from 60 measurements of a near zero of sample
over 10 days.
The LoD was calculated using the following formula: LoD = LoB + cß*SD
S.
In the equation, cß = 1.645/(1-(1/(4 *f)), where f is the degrees of freedom, and SD
S
is the standard deviation of the low concentration sample.

g. Analytical specificity:
To determine the effects of potential endogenous and exogenous interference, the
sponsor conducted an analytical specificity study according to CLSI EP07-A2
guideline. Different known concentrations of the interferent were tested in triplicate
on two concentration of each analyte: level 1 (within normal range) and level 2 (high
level at abnormal range). Samples were tested using the skyla Clinical Chemistry
Analyzer with the Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (ALP, ALT, AST, BUN and
CREA). The sponsor defined significant interference as bias >10% between the test
and control samples.
