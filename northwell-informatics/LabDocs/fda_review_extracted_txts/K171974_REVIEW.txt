H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Solana RSV+hMPV Assay is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the detection
and differentiation of RSV and hMPV viral RNA in nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs
from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. This test is intended for
use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of RSV and hMPV viral infections in humans in
conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. This test is not intended to
differentiate the two subtypes of RSV or the four genetic sub-lineages of hMPV.
Negative results do not preclude RSV infection and/or hMPV infection and should not be
used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other patient management decisions.
Conversely, positive results do not rule-out bacterial infection or co-infection with other
viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease. The use of
additional laboratory testing and clinical presentation must be considered in order to
obtain the final diagnosis of respiratory viral infection.
2. Indication(s) for use:
As a diagnostic aid in patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
· For in vitro diagnostic use only
· For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Solana Instrument
I. Device Description:
An aliquot (50 μL) of patient nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimen collected in viral
transport media is transferred to a Process Buffer Tube. One Process Buffer Tube, which
contains a competitive process control (PRC), is required for each specimen or control
sample to be tested. The tubes are vortexed and heated in a heat block at 95°C for 5 minutes.
After a 2nd vortexing step, 50 μL of the heated sample is transferred to a Reaction Tube
which rehydrates its contents. The Reaction Tubes are then placed in the Solana instrument

for amplification and detection. Upon annealing to RSV, hMPV or PRC amplicons, the
fluorescence probes are cleaved by RNaseH2 and the fluorescence signal increases due to
physical separation of fluorophore from quencher. The Solana software automatically
interprets the fluorescent signal and the test results are displayed on the Solana result screen
in approximately 40 minutes. The following RSV and hMPV combinations of results may be
displayed:

L. Test Principle:
The assay consists of two major steps: 1) specimen preparation, and 2) amplification and
detection of target sequences specific to RSV and/or hMPV using isothermal Reverse
Transcriptase - Helicase-Dependent Amplification (RT-HDA) in the presence of target-
specific fluorescence probes. The cells in a patient nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimen
are lysed during a heating step releasing viral nucleic acids when present. An aliquot of the
processed sample is then added to the lyophilized RT-HDA reagents, dNTPs, primers and
probes contained in the Reaction Tube. The Reaction Tube is then placed in the Solana
instrument for amplification and detection of RSV and hMPV specific target sequences. In
the Solana instrument, the target sequences are amplified by RSV and hMPV specific
primers and detected by RSV and hMPV specific fluorescence probes, respectively. A
competitive process control (PRC) is included in the Process Buffer Tube to monitor sample
processing, inhibitory substances in clinical samples, reagent failure, or instrument failure.
The PRC target is amplified by RSV and hMPV specific primers and detected by a PRC
specific fluorescence probe. The two target probes and the PRC probe are labeled with a
quencher on one end and a fluorophore on the other end. In addition, the two target probes
and the PRC probe incorporate one or more RNA bases. Upon annealing to RSV, hMPV or
PRC amplicons, the fluorescence probes are cleaved by RNaseH2 and the fluorescence
signal increases due to physical separation of fluorophore from quencher. Solana measures
and interprets the fluorescent signal, using on-board method-specific algorithms. The results
are displayed on the instrument screen and can be printed out via an attached printer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical Performance:
The analytical studies were conducted in pooled negative clinical matrix consisting of
nasopharyngeal samples collected by medical personnel from volunteer donors during the
winter of 2017. The samples were collected with flocked swabs, placed into viral
transport media and screened with the Solana RSV+hMPV Assay. Only the negative
samples were pooled to generate clinical matrix for use in the analytical studies. The
pooled negative matrix was stored at -20°C or at ≤ -70°C for long period storage.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision
The precision of the Solana RSV+hMPV assay was evaluated in an internal study testing
a panel of contrived samples over 12 days (non-consecutive). Testing was performed by
two operators and each sample was tested in 3 replicates.
The test samples were prepared by spiking two strains of RSV (RSV A and RSV B) and
two strains of hMPV (hMPV 20 Type A2 and hMPV 4 Type B2) into contrived nasal
matrix to targeted concentrations for low positive (at LoD, or C ), a moderate positive

Sample Stability
A study was conducted to evaluate specimen stability of RSV and hMPV viruses when
stored at 2-8°C or at -70°C in various types of transport media. The following transport
media containing negative clinical matrix were evaluated: Copan UTM, Remel M4,
Remel M5, Remel M6, Remel M4RT, and Copan ESwab transport media. Two strains of
RSV and two strains of hMPV were spiked into each transport media targeting near LoD
concentrations. The virus concentrations used in the study are shown below:

hMPV 16 Type A1 strain IA10-2003 1.11 x 103
hMPV 5 Type B1 strain Peru3-2003 1.14 x 104
All test samples were aliquoted and placed in storage at the designated temperature. A
negative sample (unspiked) of each media was also aliquoted and placed in storage. Each
sample was tested in the Solana RSV+hMPV assay at time 0. One set of samples was
placed in a refrigerator (at 2-8°C) and the second set was placed in a freezer at -70°C.
Each transport media stored in the refrigerator was tested in the Solana RSV+hMPV
assay in triplicate after storage for 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 8 days and 10 days. Each
transport media stored in the freezer was tested in the Solana RSV+hMPV assay in
triplicate after storage for 1 week, 2 weeks 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 10 weeks and 15
weeks.
A positive and negative control was included in each experiment and generated expected
results. All positive specimens generated positive results for RSV and hMPV at all time
points and all negative specimens remained negative at all time points for both storage
conditions. The data support specimen stability claim for RSV and hMPV samples up to
8 days when stored in a refrigerator (at 2-8°C) and up to 10 weeks when frozen at -70°C.
Processed Sample Stability-Prior to Heating
Sample stability was evaluated for specimens that were processed with the Solana
Process Buffer and then placed in storage at three temperatures (2 to 8°C, room
temperature, and -20°C) prior to the heat lysis step and analysis with the Solana
instrument.

The samples (50 μL) were added to the Process Buffer tube and vortexed for 5 seconds,
according to the Solana RSV+hMPV assay procedure. The tubes were then placed at each
of the designated temperatures for a defined period of time before performing the heating
step of the procedure. All samples were evaluated and tested in the Solana assay in three
replicates at each time point: 3 minutes, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, 24 hours, and 48
hours after storage at each of the temperature conditions. One set of samples was further
processed without delay through the heating, amplification and detection steps (0 time
point). The Solana RSV+hMPV assay results were positive for all samples tested at each
time point after storage at the three evaluated temperatures. A positive and negative
control was included in each experiment and generated expected results. The results
showed that samples remain stable in the Process Buffer when stored prior to further
analysis for up to 48 hours at 2 to 8°C, 25°C and -20°C.
Processed Sample Stability-Post Heating
Sample stability was evaluated for specimens that were processed with the Solana
RSV+hMPV assay through the heating step and then placed in storage at three
temperatures (2 to 8°C, 25°C (room temperature), and -20°C) prior to placing the tubes in
the Solana instrument for amplification and detection.
Test samples consisted of pooled negative matrix spiked with RSV and hMPV viruses
targeting near LoD concentrations (RSV A at 2.37 x 104 and hMPV B1 at 1.14 x 104).
The samples (50 μL) were added to the Process Buffer tube and vortexed for 5 seconds,
and then subjected to the heating step at 95°C for 5 minutes. After the heating step the
tubes were placed in storage at three temperatures: 2 to 8°C, room temperature (25°C),
and -20°C. The tubes were kept at the designated temperatures for: 3 minutes, 10
minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours before placing in the Solana instrument
for amplification and detection. One set of samples was analyzed without delay (0 time
point). All samples were evaluated and tested in three replicates at each time point after
storage at each of the temperature conditions. The Solana RSV+hMPV assay results were
positive for all samples tested demonstrating that the assay performance is not affected if
samples are stored for up to 48 hours after the heating step, at the temperatures tested (2
to 8°C, 25°C or -20°C) before further analysis with the Solana instrument. A positive and
negative control was included in each experiment and generated expected results.
Effect of Varying the Length of the Heating Interval - Robustness Study
The Solana RSV+hMPV assay procedure requires that samples are subjected to lysis by
heating at 95°C for 5 minutes. This study evaluated the performance of the assay when
the heating process was either shortened or prolonged, outside of the indicated 5 minutes.
The test samples were prepared by spiking nasal clinical matrix with RSV and with
hMPV to near LoD concentrations (RSV A at 2.37 x 104 and hMPV B1 at 1.14 x 104).
After addition of 50 μL of each sample to the Process Buffer, the samples were heated to
95°C and subjected to heating for either 1 minute, 3 minutes, 5 minutes, 7 minutes, 10
10

--- Page 11 ---
minutes or 12 minutes. Each sample was evaluated and tested in three replicates in the
Solana RSV+hMPV assay. All samples generated expected positive results
demonstrating that accurate results are obtained if the samples are heated anywhere
between 1 to 12 minutes. A positive and negative control was included in each
experiment and generated expected results.
Range of Heating Temperatures - Robustness Study
The Solana RSV+hMPV assay procedure requires that samples are subjected to a lysis
step by heating at 95°C for 5 minutes. This study evaluated the performance of the assay
when the heating temperature is outside of the specified 95°C. The test samples were
prepared by spiking nasal clinical matrix with RSV and with hMPV to near Lode
concentrations (RSV A at 2.37 x 104 and hMPV B1 at 1.14 x 104). After addition of 50
all of each sample to the Process Buffer, the samples were heated to one of the following
heating temperatures: 55°C, 65°C, 75°C, 85°C, 95°C, and 105°C. . Each sample was
evaluated and tested in three replicates in the Solana RSV+hMPV assay. All samples
generated expected positive results demonstrating that accurate results are obtained if the
heating temperature ranges from 55°C to 105°C for 5 minutes. A positive and negative
control was included in each experiment and generated expected results.
Fresh vs. Frozen Study
To demonstrate the stability of RSV and hMPV nucleic acids in clinical samples, the
sponsor selected 30 samples that were tested fresh (within 72 hours of collection) in the
study and then frozen at -70°C. These samples (10 positive for RSV, 10 positive for
hMPV and 10 negative samples) were retested with the Solana assay and with the
comparator assay after the study was completed. The time range of storage of the selected
samples was from 17 to 29 weeks. The qualitative results for all samples remained
unchanged after storage at -70°C, i.e., all positive samples tested positive and all negative
samples tested negative in both assays. The Ct values obtained with the comparator assay
when testing fresh samples positive for RSV ranged from 23.1 to 35.8, with a median Ct
value of 27.0. The Ct values obtained with the comparator assay when testing fresh
samples positive for hMPV ranged from 23.1 to 35.8, with a median Ct value of 31.2.
The change in Ct values obtained with the comparator assay testing samples positive for
RSV after storage at -70°C ranged from -0.8 to 2.3. The change in Ct values obtained
with the comparator assay testing samples positive for hMPV after storage at -70°C
ranged from -4.4 to 3.7. The data showed that there was no significant change in Ct
values over time when stored at -70°C for the samples tested.
Carry-over Study
A carryover study was conducted to verify that cross-contamination and amplicon
carryover does not occur when using the Solana assay. Six high positive samples were
run in alternating sequence with six negative samples in five separate runs on the Solana
instrument. The high positive samples were prepared in nasal clinical matrix at a
concentration of 1.0 x 105 for each virus, RSV A and hMPV B. There was no carryover
11

--- Page 12 ---
observed as all 30 negative samples tested negative even when tested immediately after a
high positive sample.
Controls
The Solana RSV+hMPV Assay contains an internal process control that is included in the
reagent mix in the Reaction Tube and is used to detect HDA inhibitory substances in
clinical samples and to confirm the integrity of assay reagents and the operation of the
Solana instrument.
The Solana RSV+hMPV Control Set is available as an accessory to the assay and
consists of two vials of Positive Controls containing inactivated strains of RSV B and
hMPV B2, and one vial of a Negative Control made of RSV and hMPV RNA-free
matrix. The controls are intended to be used in the same manner as patient samples. The
external Positive Control is intended to monitor for substantial reagent and instrument
failure. The external Negative Control serves to detect reagent or environment
contamination by RSV and hMPV RNA or amplicons.
d. Analytical Sensitivity (Limit of Detection):
The analytical limit of detection (LoD) of the Solana RSV+hMPV Assay was evaluated
using two subtypes of RSV (RSV A and RSV B) and four genetic sub-lineages of hMPV
(hMPV A1, hMPV A2, hMPV B1 and hMPV B2). Each pre-titered virus stock was
diluted in the negative clinical matrix to a concentration that was 10x the estimated LoD
(previously determined). The stocks were further serially diluted and each dilution was
tested in 20 replicates with the Solana RSV+hMPV assay according to the instructions
for use. The study included multiple Solana instruments. The LoD for each organism was
determined to be the viral concentration from the highest dilution where at least 19 out of
20 replicates (≥ 95%) were positive in the Solana assay for that analyte. The results of the
study are shown below.

e. Analytical Reactivity (inclusivity)
The reactivity of the Solana RSV+hMPV Assay was evaluated with four additional
strains of RSV (two RSV A and two RSV B) and with four additional strains of hMPV
(one each of hMPV A1, hMPV A2, hMPV B1 and hMPV B2) at concentrations near the
level of detection (LoD) of the assay. Pre-titered RSV and hMPV strains were serially

diluted in negative nasal matrix targeting concentrations of 2x LOD. The dilutions of the
viruses were tested in three replicates in the Solana RSV+hMPV Assay according to the
instructions for use. The study was performed using multiple Solana instruments. The
experiments included a positive and a negative control for each setup. All RSV and
hMPV strains were detected in all three replicates at the concentrations shown below.

Additionally, the sponsor conducted an in silico analysis of the hMPV and RSV primers
and probes used in the assay to determine the inclusivity of various strains of these
viruses based on the hMPV and RSV sequences available from NCBI. The primer and
probe sequences demonstrated 100% homology with the majority of viral sequences
found in the NCBI database.
f. Analytical specificity:
Cross-Reactivity
The Solana RSV+hMPV Assay was evaluated for potential cross-reactivity (false positive
results) with organisms that may be found in the nasal passages of patients with
symptoms of respiratory tract infection.
A panel of 46 microorganisms (25 bacteria, 1 yeast, 20 viruses) was tested in the Solana
RSV+hMPV Assay. All microorganisms tested were pre-titered. Each organism was
spiked into pooled negative nasal matrix such that the concentration was ≥1x105
TCID /mL for viruses or ≥1x106 CFU/mL for bacteria and yeast.
50
The samples were tested in 3 replicates with the Solana RSV+hMPV Assay according to
the instructions for use. The study was performed using multiple Solana instruments. The
experiments included a positive and a negative control for each setup. No cross-reactivity
was observed with the organisms shown below at the concentrations tested.

Microbial Interference
A study was conducted to demonstrate that organisms that may be present in specimens
collected from nasal passages of patients symptomatic of respiratory tract infections do
not interfere with the detection of RSV or hMPV when tested with the Solana assay.
A panel of the same 46 microorganisms described above was tested with the Solana
RSV+hMPV Assay in the presence of low concentrations of RSV and hMPV. Each
potential interfering microorganism was spiked into negative nasal matrix for a final
concentration of ≥1x105 TCID50/mL for viruses or ≥1x106 CFU/mL for bacteria and
yeast. This study was conducted with two strains of RSV and two strains of hMPV at

g. Assay cut-off:
The preliminary threshold settings for the Solana RSV+hMPV Assay were determined
during the development stage and were based on the analysis of the fluorescent signal
obtained with known positive and negative clinical specimens, as well as analysis of
contrived samples used in the determination of LoD. The RSV cutoff determination
involved 24 positive and 62 negative specimens and the hMPV cutoff 23 positive and 61
negative specimens, as determined by the comparator assay. The specific parameters used
for the determination of the cutoff for each analyte included the slope of the amplification
curve for samples near the LoD (“slope threshold”), the time required to reach the slope
threshold and the duration of the evaluation of the generated signal. The cutoff settings
were established and used during the clinical study.

3. Clinical studies:
A prospective clinical study was conducted between January and May 2017, testing
specimens collected from 2064 patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection.
Four specimens were removed from the study due to protocol deviations (inappropriate
specimen type) leaving a total of 2060 specimens for evaluation. Three hundred (300)
nasal and 1760 nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected in transport media were tested
with the Solana RSV+hMPV assay at six clinical testing sites. Comparison testing was
performed on all specimens at a central clinical laboratory using an FDA cleared
molecular assay detecting RSV and hMPV. Of those, 769 specimens (collected between
April and May 2017) were tested fresh and 1291 specimens (collected between January
and May 2017) were frozen at -70°C and shipped to clinical sites for testing with the
Solana assay. An aliquot of each sample was sent (on cold packs or dry ice as needed) to
the central laboratory for testing with the comparator assay.
The samples were transported and stored at 2° to 8°C for up to 72 hours or frozen at
-70°C after 72 hours until testing.

Data analysis
Of the 2060 samples evaluated, 14 specimens were invalid in the Solana assay (remained
invalid upon repeat testing) and were excluded from data analysis for an invalid rate of 0.7%
(14/2060), with the 95% CI (0.4% -1.1%). The remaining 2046 samples were included in the
final data analysis.
The positive percent agreement (PPA) and the negative percent agreement (NPA) of the
Solana RSV+hMPV assay for RSV and for hMPV, when compared to an FDA cleared
comparator assay is shown below. The performance is presented by sample storage category
(fresh or frozen) and combined.

5. Expected values:
The positivity rate of RSV and hMPV was established during the prospective study
conducted between January and May 2017, based on 2046 (760 fresh and 1286 frozen)
evaluable specimens collected from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract
infection across six clinical sites in the United States. The majority of samples collected
between January and May 2017 were frozen before testing. The majority of samples
collected between April and May 2017 were tested fresh. The positivity rate of the Solana
RSV+hMPV assay during the study period is shown below for the frozen samples and for
the fresh samples, stratified by age.

6. Quality Control:
a. Process Control
A competitive process control (PRC) is included in the Process Buffer Tube to
monitor sample processing, inhibitory substances in clinical samples, reagent failure
or device failure. The PRC target is amplified by RSV and hMPV specific primers
and detected by a PRC specific fluorescence probe.
a. External Controls:
The external controls are available from Quidel as an accessory to the assay. The
control kit includes two vials of Positive Controls (inactivated strains of RSV B and
of hMPV8 B2) and one vial of a Negative Control (RSV and hMPV RNA-free
matrix). These controls are intended to monitor pre-analytical and environmental
factors that could substantially affect reagent integrity or the instrument function. The
negative control is used to detect reagent or environmental contamination of the
