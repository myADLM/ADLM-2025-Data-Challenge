I. Device Description:
1. Overview
The Sofia Strep A+ FIA is a rapid lateral flow immunoassay for the qualitative detection
of GAS antigens from throat swabs collected from patients with signs and symptoms of
pharyngitis. The Sofia Strep A+ FIA components have not been modified; a detailed
description of the lateral flow device is available in submission K141775, which
describes Sofia Strep A+ FIA use with the original Sofia analyzer.
The purpose of this submission is to obtain 510(k) clearance for the Sofia Strep A+ FIA
for use with the newly developed Sofia 2 analyzer. The Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers are
similar in function and design. Both systems utilize the same fail-safes and failure alert
2

--- Page 3 ---
mechanisms, the same calibration and assay-specific cartridges, and the same ultraviolet
light-emitting diodes (UV LEDs) to excite the fluorophore. The primary difference
between the original Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzer is the design of the optical detection
system. Sofia uses a motorized optics unit to collect fluorescent signal data as it performs
a series of scans across the longitudinal axis of the test strip, whereas Sofia 2 captures a
still image of the entire test strip window using a complimentary color-oxide
semiconductor (CMOS) camera. To emulate Sofia, the Sofia 2 analyzer converts pixels
captured by the CMOS camera to fluorescent signal data, which is analyzed in an
equivalent manner to Sofia to yield qualitative test results.
2. Quality Control
See Decision Summary for K141775.
3. Results Interpretation
There are three possible test results for the Sofia Strep A+ FIA: 1) Positive for Strep A,
2) Negative for Strep A, and 3) Invalid. If an invalid test result is reported, the Sofia Strep
A+ FIA should be repeated with a new patient sample and a new test cassette.
Note: The Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers may be set to one of two operating modes: “Walk
Away” or “Read Now.” Time to results for the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers are described
below.
· In Walk Away Mode, the user inserts the test cassette into the analyzer immediately
following addition of the specimen to the Sofia Strep A+ FIA sample port. The
analyzer automatically times the test development and provides positive or negative
test results after 5 minutes.
· In the Read Now Mode, the user incubates the test cassette on the benchtop for 5
minutes before inserting the cassette into the analyzer. Positive and negative test
results are displayed within 1 minute.
No changes were made to test components in the Sofia Strep A+ kits or calibration
cassette.

M. Performance Characteristics
Limit of Detection, Reproducibility, Assay Precision, Read Now vs Walk Away Mode,
Analyzer Calibration, Transport Media/Sample Stability, and Method Comparison Studies
were conducted to demonstrate equivalent performance of the Sofia Strep A+ FIA on the
Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers, where relevant. Results from each of these studies are described
in sections M(1a-1d) and M(2) below. Additional analytical and clinical performance data for
the Sofia Strep A+ FIA are available under K141775.
1. Analytical Performance
a. Limit of Detection
The limit of detection (LoD) of the Sofia Strep A+ FIA was established on both the
Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers. The study included three GAS strains spiked into
negative clinical throat swab matrix. Briefly, dose-response curves were generated
using three GAS strains from which the C95 concentration for each strain was
interpolated. The preliminary LoD concentration was determined for each strain with
two lots of cassettes on each instrument platform and defined as the lowest dilution
yielding 100% positive results, where the next lower dilution returned one or more

negative results. The LoD was verified by testing each GAS strain to confirm that the
expected proportion of positive results was obtained. An additional 60 replicates for
each GAS strain were tested at the preliminary LoD on one cassette lot on each
instrument platform. Testing spanned three days with at least 20 replicates run per
day for each strain/instrument. The LoDs of the two instrument platforms were
compared to demonstrate similar performance of the Sofia Strep A+ FIA with both
analyzers.
Testing was performed in Read Now Mode in accordance with the Package Insert of
Sofia Strep A+ FIA and user manuals of the two analyzers. A Calibration Check of
each Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzer was performed prior to use on the first day of testing
and the results were recorded. In addition, the External Positive and Negative
Controls were tested with each cassette lot for every day of testing and on each
analyzer used in the study. Results of control testing were recorded. The LoD and
Signal/Cut-off (S/CO) results are shown in Table 1 below.

The established LoDs for the Sofia Strep A+ FIA on the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers
with the 3 strains of GAS ranged from 3.94E+04 to 1.60E+05. The study confirmed that
the LoD generated for the Sofia Strep A+ FIA on Sofia 2 is similar to the LoD
generated on Sofia.
b. Reproducibility
Reproducibility of the Sofia Strep A+ FIA on the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers was
evaluated at three different laboratories. A total of 270 samples were tested across 3
sites on both analyzers. Two operators at each site tested nine coded contrived
samples (prepared in negative clinical matrix) from the reproducibility panel over 5
days per site. Test panels included Negative (no bacteria), Low Positive (1X LoD
GAS), and Moderate Positive (2-3X LOD GAS) samples. The study demonstrated
intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility with a panel of GAS samples of various
concentrations (See Table 2 and Table 3 below). When testing the low Strep A
positive samples (C95), Sofia and Sofia 2 reported the samples positive 98.9%
(89/90) of the time. When testing the moderately positive samples, Sofia and Sofia 2
called the Strep A+ sample positive 100% (90/90) of the time. Out of the 270 samples
tested, there were no invalid test results obtained with either the Sofia or Sofia 2

Any quantitative differences between sites did not impact the final qualitative results
reported.
c. Assay Precision
To supplement the Reproducibility Study, within-laboratory precision of the Sofia
and Sofia 2 analyzers was evaluated. The precision of Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers
with the Sofia Strep A+ FIA was examined using three lots of devices and two
operators testing the same samples for twelve (12) days over two calibration cycles
for a total of 144 data points for each analyzer and each sample type. One strain of
GAS was tested at Low Positive (approximately 1X LoD) and Moderate Positive
(approximately 2-3X LoD) levels. A Negative sample was also included in the test
panel.
One Sofia and two Sofia 2 analyzers (one for back-up) were used in this study. When
an error for saving the test result happened on the Sofia 2 analyzer, the cassette was
re-scanned immediately on the backup Sofia 2 analyzer. The testing was conducted in
Read Now Mode. Overall percent agreement between the expected results and the
precision study results for the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers is shown in Table 6 below.
The qualitative call rates for both Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers were the same for the
Negative, Low Positive and Moderate Positive samples: 100% negative for the
Negative samples and 100% positive for the Low and Moderate Positive samples.
There were three (3) invalid tests reported in the study.

operated over multiple days.
d. Read Now vs Walk-Away Mode/Temperature Study
The purpose of this study was to document testing results of the Sofia Strep A+ FIA
in Read Now and Walk Away Modes on the Sofia 2 analyzer. In the Read Now
Mode, the cassette with loaded sample was developed for 5 minutes on the bench top
before insertion into the Sofia 2 analyzer for scanning. In Walk Away Mode, the
cassette was placed in the Sofia 2 analyzer immediately and developed for 5 minutes
in the Sofia 2 analyzer. Additionally, testing was performed at different ambient
temperatures. The entire test kit (including the Sofia 2 analyzer) was equilibrated to,
and tested at, each of the following environmental conditions: 15°C, room
temperature, and 30°C. The temperature range evaluated was the same as the range
currently approved for the Sofia Strep A+ FIA and the existing Sofia analyzer.
For sample testing, one GAS strain was tested at approximately 2-3X LoD. Contrived
Negative Matrix was also tested as the negative sample. All positive and negative
samples were in 100% agreement with the expected results regardless of the
temperature and reading mode. This study demonstrated that the correct results can be
obtained with the Sofia Strep A+ FIA when the test materials are stored and tested at
temperatures from 15° to 30°C in both Read Now and Walk Away Modes on Sofia 2
analyzer.

e. Analyzer Calibration
The purpose of this study was to assess the Sofia 2 intra-instrument variability and
performance during the maximum 30-day calibration cycle. To verify the intra-
instrument variability, the study was executed using five Sofia 2 analyzers. On day 1,
all analyzers were calibrated. The variability in RFU for each of the four (4) lines was
analyzed by each instrument to determine the percentage change in RFU over three
reads per working day for 45 calendar days. The study data showed that the Sofia 2
analyzer demonstrated intra-instrument variability of less than 6% (+/-3%) over the
maximum calibration interval of 30 days, and therefore, met the acceptance
specification over this interval.
f. Transport Media and Sample Stability
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the stability of GAS spiked on
· Puritan Rayon Swabs stored in a transport tube with a secured cap
· BBL Culture Swabs stored in the Collection and Transport system containing
Stuart’s media
The study included testing the contrived swab specimens spiked on Puritan Rayon
swabs stored in dry transported tubes with secured caps as well as spiked on BBL
Culture Swabs stored in the Collection and Transport system for up to 50 hours at two
different temperatures. The seeded swabs were stored and kept at 4°C for 0, 6, 24, 48
and 50 hours and room temperature for 0, 6, 24, 48 and 50 hours. Six (6) replicates
for each condition were tested. The cassettes were read in Read Now Mode on the
Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers.
When the negative matrix was tested with BBL CultureSwab and Dry Puritan Rayon
swabs after storage at room temperature and at 2-8°C on Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers,
all valid negative swabs were negative and yielded 100% negativity up to 50 hours.
There was one (1) invalid result. When the positive samples were tested with BBL
CultureSwab and Dry Puritan Rayon swabs after storage at room temperature and at
2-8°C on Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers, all swabs were positive and yielded 100%
positivity up to 50 hours. There were three (3) invalid tests. If not processed soon
after collection, Quidel has stated that swabs can be held in any clean, dry plastic tube
or sleeve up to 24 hours at room temperature (23°C) or refrigerated (2°C to 8°C) up
to 48 hours. For the BBL CultureSwab with Liquid Stuart Media, the recommended
storage is 2-8°C or ambient temperature up to 48 hours.

2. Comparison Studies
a. Method Comparison
A multi-center study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the Sofia Strep
A+ FIA run on the Sofia 2 analyzer vs the Sofia analyzer using a panel of known
positive and negative clinical and contrived samples prepared in clinical negative
matrix. One-hundred (100) Strep A positive and (100) Strep A negative samples were
incorporated into each panel (tested positive or negative with the current FDA-cleared
Sofia Strep A+ FIA on Sofia). According to the test protocol, positive panel members
were prepared so that approximately 60% to 80% of the samples had Strep A levels
close to the Sofia Strep A+ FIA cut-off with approximately one-half around the LoD
and the remainder as moderate positive samples. The remaining positive samples
were evenly distributed across the range of the assay. Negative panel members were
prepared so that approximately 30% to 40% were High Negatives.
Each panel member was assigned to one of the analyte concentration levels based on
the signal-to-cut off ratio (S/CO) that was obtained from testing on the Sofia analyzer.
Table 8 below shows the S/CO for each level.

High Positive (4-5X LoD) 6.1-9
Very High Positive (>5X LoD) >10.3
The final composition of the Method Comparison Panel was reported as shown in

All samples were coded and used to prepare randomized panels, with an identical
panel of specimens prepared for each of three sites. Each site received a set of two
hundred (200) numbered tubes each containing 2 swabs, as well as Positive and
Negative Control swabs. For all analyte levels combined, the Positive Percent

and the Sofia 2 results were 98.7% and 96.9%, respectively (See Table 10 below).
Agreement between the results obtained on the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers for each
of the individual analyte levels tested is shown in Table 11 below.
There were 12 discordant results for GAS across all three sites. Ten discordant
samples were categorized as “High Negative” samples, and two discordant samples
were characterized as “Negative” samples. For the two discordant samples originally
prepared as “Negative” samples, results were reported as positive by the Sofia
analyzer but negative by the Sofia 2 analyzer. The two false positives by the Sofia
analyzer appeared to be due to contamination of the samples. Discordant results were
observed across all three sites and were generated by multiple operators; there was no
trend indicating any instrument bias.

aThere were 5 discordant Sofia 2 negative/Sofia positive results for Strep A, which included
3 high negative (C5) and 2 true negative (C0) specimens. The 2 true negatives (C0) showing
false positive results in Sofia appeared to be due to contamination.
bThere were 7 discordant Sofia 2 positive/Sofia negative results for Strep A, which included
all high negative (C5) specimens.

4. Level of Concern
Moderate
5. Software Description
The Sofia 2 analyzer images the test strip and utilizes an embedded software algorithm to
process the resulting data set into a qualitative test result. A positive test result for the
analyte is determined by detection and analysis of the fluorescent signal at the test and
reference lines, which are processed by the assay-specific algorithm. The algorithm
employs a smoothing filter to the data and, identifies a peak maxima, minima and width,
then calculates the RFU value based on peak height for the analyte test line. Results are
presented on a screen and can be printed on an integrated printer.
6. Specimen Identification
Each cassette is labeled with a barcode that is detected by the Sofia 2 internal barcode
reader. The 2-dimensinal barcode contains lot, expiration, and test method information. If
the cassette is not in the correct orientation, the barcode cannot be read and the analyzer
will display an error.
7. Calibration
To ensure that signal drift is controlled, the Sofia 2 analyzer has a calibration algorithm
that reminds the operator to check the calibration status of the instrument every 30 days.
The calibration cassette uses a highly stable fluorescent reagent along with a unique
barcode. The insertion of this cassette triggers the Sofia 2 analyzer to self-check its
calibration.
