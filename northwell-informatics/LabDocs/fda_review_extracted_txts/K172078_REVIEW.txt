L. Test Principle:
Recombinantly expressed and purified RNA POL III antigen is bound to the wells of a
polystyrene microwell plate followed by blocking of the unreacted sites to reduce non-
specific binding. Controls, calibrators and diluted patient sera are added to separate wells,
allowing any anti-RNA POL III antibodies present to bind to the immobilized antigen.
Unbound sample is washed away and an enzyme labeled anti-human IgG conjugate is added
to each well. After washing away any unbound conjugate, specific enzyme substrate (TMB)
is then added to the wells. After stopping the enzymatic reaction, the intensity of color
change, which is proportional to the concentration of antibody, is read by a
spectrophotometer at 450 nm. Results are expressed in ELISA units per milliliter (EU/mL).
Semi-quantitative results are determined from a series of five calibrators (1 EU/mL, 20
EU/mL, 40 EU/mL, 80 EU/mL, and 160 EU/mL). Values less than 20 EU/mL are considered
negative results while values greater than 25 EU/mL are considered positive; results between
20 EU/mL and 25 EU/mL are considered ‘indeterminate/borderline’. The sponsor states the

following recommendations in the Package Insert: “Indeterminate/borderline results should
be retested and evaluated along with other laboratory methods detection of antibodies to
RNA POL III such as indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA) using a HEp-2 substrate.”.
Qualitative results are determined using a ratio of the absorbance of the sample to the
absorbance of the cut-off calibrator (20 EU/mL). The ratio is multiplied by the concentration
of the cut-off calibrator to give a numerical value. Values greater than or equal to 20 EU/mL
are considered positive and values less than 20 EU/mL values are considered negative.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
The results of all the studies met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision performance was evaluated in accordance with CLSI guideline EP05-A2. A
panel consisting of seven patient sera with levels of RNA POL III antibodies that
cover the analytical measuring range was assayed in duplicate, twice a day, for 20
days with one reagent lot (a total of 80 replicates per sample). Testing was performed
by two operators using different equipment sets. The first operator performed the
assay with a multi-channel pipettor, microplate washer and microplate reader. The
second operator used different instruments with the same type of equipment. The
results are summarized in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity and recovery were tested by diluting positive specimens across the
measuring range in equidistant dilutions with negative patient sera. The observed
values were graphed against the calculated values and a linear regression was
performed. The linear range was determined to be 3.2–160 EU/mL for the assay. The
results are summarized in the table below:

High dose hook effect: Four high concentrations specimens were serially diluted to
assess the presence of any artifactual decrease in assay signal associated with anti-
RNA POL III antibody excess (hook effect). No hook effect was demonstrated in
sample levels up to 2092.3 EU/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i. Traceability:
There are currently no recognized international standards for the measurement of
RNA POL III antibodies. Calibrator and Control values for both assays are
directly traceable to in-house standards.
ii. Value Assignment:
Calibrators and positive controls are dilutions of pooled anti-RNA POL III

antibody positive sera obtained from various commercial plasma centers. The
calibrators and controls are taken from different pooled sera. In order to have
traceability with newly made calibrators, each new lot of calibrators is assayed on
an already cleared kit and compared to the existing calibrators as reference. Each
lot of calibrator is also tested in comparison with normal human sera, clinical
samples and internal standards. Five calibrator levels (Cal A-E) with assigned
values from 0–160 EU/mL are included to provide semi-quantitative results and
must be used with each run. The cut-off calibrator for the qualitative analysis is
derived from Cal D. Test results greater than or equal to Cal D are considered
positive.
For semi-quantitative determinations, the positive controls must give values in the
range stated on the vial. The negative control contains negative human serum in
buffer. The negative control must be <10 EU/mL.
iii. Stability:
Shelf-life Stability:
Accelerated and real-time stability studies were conducted on three lots of
components/reagents. The accelerated stability study was conducted with
materials incubated at 37°C. Data from the accelerated stability study support a
shelf-life stability of 18 months A real-time stability study is on-going and
.
currently supports a real-time claim of stability claim at this writing.
Open-Kit Stability:
For the open-kit stability study, materials in each ImmuLisa Enhanced RNA POL
III Antibody ELISA were opened and stored in a dark environment as required for
bench-top usage, then assayed at 15, 45 and 90 day intervals. Although data from
the open-kit stability study demonstrate that opened reagents are stable at 45 days,
the sponsor chose a more restrictive one month open-kit stability claim.
Sample Stability and Storage:
The package insert recommends that sera be assayed soon after separation or
stored at 2–8°C for no longer than one week. For longer storage, serum specimens
should be frozen. Users should avoid repeated freezing and thawing of samples.
The sponsor recommends that frozen specimens be tested within one year.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity was determined in accordance with CLSI guideline EP17-
A2. The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying a blank sample in 60
replicates. The limit of detection (LoD) was determined by assaying six low negative
sera in 10 replicates over three days using two reagent lots of each ImmuLisa
Enhanced RNA POL III Antibody ELISAs. The LoB and LoD for the assay was 1.7
and 3.2 EU/mL, respectively. The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined by
testing four low level samples in replicates of four over three days using two reagent
lots and was determined to be 3.3 EU/mL.

e. Analytical specificity:
i. Endogenous Interference:
Interference studies studies were performed according to CLSI guideline
EP07-A2 by testing five serum samples with anti-RNA POL III antibody
levels corresponding to the negative range, near the assay cut-off, and in the
low, moderate and high positive range. Each sample was mixed with known
quantities of potentially interfering substances and analyzed in one assay run
with two replicates with one lot of reagents. The recovery was calculated by
comparing to control samples spiked with the same volume of diluents. No
significant interference was detected for the following substances up to the
concentrations listed in the table below:
Potential Interfering Compound Test Concentration
Hemoglobin 2 g/L
Bilirubin 342 µmol/L
Triglycerides 37 mmol/L
Rheumatoid Factor 100 EU/mL
Total cholesterol 13 mmol/L
Prednisone 0.84 μmol/L
Naproxen 25 mg/mL
The ‘Limitations of Procedure’ section of the Package Insert states “This test
should not be performed on grossly hemolyzed, microbially contaminated or
lipemic samples”.
ii. Exogenous Interference:
Interference by selected exogenous substances was evaluated according to
CLSI guideline EP07-A2 by testing five serum samples with anti-RNA POL
III antibody levels corresponding to the negative range, near the assay cut-off,
and in the low, moderate and high positive range. Each sample was mixed
with known quantities of potentially interfering substances and analyzed in
one assay run with one lot of reagenrs. The recovery was calculated by
comparing to control samples spiked with the same volume of diluents. No
significant interference was detected for the following substances at the
concentrations listed in the table below:

ii. Cross-reactivity:
Numerous potentially cross-reactive autoimmune and infectious disease sera were
tested for anti-RNA POL III antibody levels. Refer to test results for 521 serum
samples from patients in the Non-Target Disease Group in the table presented in
the section below on Clinical studies. The number of serum samples tested
positive is nine (1.7%) for the assay.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-offs for the ImmuLisa Enhanced RNA Pol III Antibody ELISA was
determined by testing specimens from healthy blood donors. The optical density of
the 97.5th percentile value of the results was defined as a value of 20 EU/mL and
assigned for the cut-off to establish the following result interpretations:
RNA Pol III antibody value Result interpretation
<20 EU/mL Negative
20–25 EU/mL Indeterminate (Borderline)
>25 EU/mL Positive
The cut-off using the 20 EU/mL was validated in a separate study using 123 samples
from healthy blood donors and samples from patients with autoimmune, infectious,
and other conditions expected to be found in the differential diagnosis of SSc; 2.4%
(3/123) of the samples from were positive for RNA Pol III.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
A total of 830 serum samples were included in the clinical validation for the
ImmuLisa Enhanced RNA POL III IgG ELISA. The validation set of samples
included the target disease group of 281 systemic sclerosis subjects, and a non-target
disease group of 549 samples from subjects with autoimmune, infectious, and other
conditions expected to be found in the differential diagnosis of systemic sclerosis.
The 2013 ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria for Systemic Sclerosis1 were used for
the diagnosis of SSc samples. Test results for each individual disease and both disease
groups are shown below:

The performance of the ImmuLisa Enhanced RNA POL III IgG Antibody ELISA was
evaluated against the clinical diagnosis of systemic sclerosis. The clinical sensitivity
and specificity were calculated by grouping the indeterminate results with test-
negative results, and then sensitivity and specificity were calculated again by
grouping the equivocal results with test-positive results:
