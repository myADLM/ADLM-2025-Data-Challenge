nasopharyngeal/throat swabs [NPS/TS]) and lower respiratory
tract specimens (including bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL],
bronchial wash [BW], tracheal aspirate [TA], sputum, and lung
tissue) from human patients with signs and symptoms of
respiratory infection and/or from viral culture;
· To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of
circulating influenza viruses.
Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a
season when seasonal influenza viruses A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) were the
predominant influenza A viruses in circulation and during a season when
the A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus was the predominant influenza A
virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other
emerging influenza A viruses.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used
as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely,
positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other
viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical
and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for
novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for
testing. Viral culture should not be attempted unless a BSL 3E facility is available
to receive and culture specimens.
All users, analysts, and any person reporting results from use of this
device should be trained to perform and interpret the results from this
procedure by a competent instructor prior to use. CDC Influenza
Division will limit the distribution of this device to only those users
who have successfully completed a training course provided by CDC

Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Kit:
The Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Kit contains reagents and controls of the
CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel and is
intended for use in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on an Applied
Biosystems (ABI) 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument in conjunction with
clinical and epidemiological information:
· For the determination of the genetic lineage of human influenza B
viruses as B/Victoria or B/Yamagata lineage from viral RNA in
upper respiratory tract clinical specimens (including nasopharyngeal
swabs [NPS], nasal swabs [NS], throat swabs [TS], nasal aspirates
[NA], nasal washes [NW] and dual nasopharyngeal/throat swabs
[NPS/TS]) from human patients with signs and symptoms of
respiratory infection and/or from viral culture;
· To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of circulating
influenza viruses.
Performance characteristics for influenza B lineage genotyping were established
during a season when influenza B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages were found in
approximately equal proportion.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the
sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive
results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent
detected may not be the definite cause of disease.

--- Page 7 ---
· For the presumptive identification of virus in patients who may be
infected with influenza A subtype A(H5) (Asian lineage) from viral RNA
in human respiratory specimens and viral culture in conjunction with
clinical and epidemiological risk factors;
· To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of circulating
influenza viruses.
Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when
seasonal influenza viruses A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) were the predominant influenza
A viruses in circulation and during a season when the A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza
virus was the predominant influenza A virus in circulation. Performance
characteristics may vary with other emerging influenza A viruses.
Testing with the influenza H5a and H5b primer and probe sets should not be performed
unless the patient meets the most current U.S.Department of Health and Human Services
(DHHS) clinical and epidemiologic criteria for testing suspect A(H5) specimens. The
definitive identification of influenza A(H5) (Asian lineage) either directly from patient
specimens or from virus cultures requires additional laboratory testing, along with
clinical and epidemiological assessment in consultation with national influenza
surveillance experts.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used
as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely,
positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other
viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture
should not be attempted unless a BSL 3E facility is available to receive and culture

I. Device Description:
The CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is used in real-time
RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on the Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7500 Fast Dx Real-time
PCR system. The panel is configured in four separate kits. Each kit consists of
oligonucleotide primers, fluorescently labeled hydrolysis probes, and controls which
are used in rRT-PCR assays for the in vitro qualitative detection and characterization
of influenza virus RNA in respiratory specimens from patients presenting with
influenza-like illness (ILI). Oligonucleotide primers and probes for detection of
influenza A, influenza B, and 2009 influenza A (swine origin) were selected from
highly conserved regions of the matrix (M), non-structural (NS), and nucleoprotein
(NP) genes, respectively. Oligonucleotide primers and probes for characterization and
differentiation of influenza A(H3) and A(H1)pdm09 viruses and genetic lineages of
influenza B were selected from highly conserved regions of their HA genes.
Oligonucleotide primers and probes to detect the human RNase P gene (RP) in control
samples and clinical specimens are also included in the panel.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
NA
L. Test Principle:
The CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel includes sets of
oligonucleotide primers and dual-labeled hydrolysis probes to be used in real-time RT-PCR
assays on the Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7500 Fast Dx Real-time PCR instrument. The
targeted regions of influenza viral RNA are transcribed into complimentary DNA (cDNA)
and amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The fluorescently labeled probes
anneal to amplified DNA fragments and the fluorescent signal intensity is monitored by the
ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-time PCR instrument during each PCR cycle. Amplification of
target is recorded as increase of fluorescence over time in comparison to background
signal.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Using the CDC Influenza A Subtyping Kit as the representative assays from
the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, studies were
conducted to assess the reproducibility of the two additional nucleic acids
extraction instrument platforms to be used with the CDC Human Influenza
Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel test kits. The Roche MagNA Pure
96 was evaluated with the Roche DNA and Viral NA Small Volume Kit. The
QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL was evaluated with the QIAGEN EZ1 DSP
Virus Kit and the QIAGEN EZ1 RNA Tissue Mini Kit.
A blinded panel of contrived samples containing a background of beta-
propiolactone (BPL) treated A549 cells in viral transport medium (VTM) was
assembled by adding a BPL treated influenza A(H3N2) virus, A/Hong
Kong/4801/2014. The samples included a moderate positive sample, a low
positive sample near the established assay LoD for the CDC Influenza A
Subtyping Kit, and a negative sample consisting of background A549 cells and
VTM.
Three separate testing sites were selected for each extraction instrument
platform. The sample panel was tested five times by two analysts at each site
over five days. Analysts performed extractions with the investigational nucleic
acids extraction instrument platform and the relevant extraction method(s),
13

--- Page 14 ---
and tested the extracted nucleic acids with the InfA, H3, and RP assays from
the CDC Influenza A Subtyping Kit using Invitrogen SuperScript and utilizing
the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx (ABI 7500 Fast Dx) real-time PCR
system.
The results for the reproducibility studies of each nucleic acids extraction
instrument platform and the relevant extraction method(s) are summarized in
Table 1 to Table 3 below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable, qualitative tests.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Not applicable, aspects of the tests other than nucleic acids extraction options are not
modified from the previously FDA-cleared versions.
d. Detection limit:
The LoD performance equivalency between a previously FDA-cleared nucleic
acids extraction method and either the Roche MagNA Pure 96 or the QIAGEN
EZ1 Advanced XL nucleic acids extraction instrument platform and the relevant
extraction method was evaluated by testing 5-fold serial dilutions of a
characterized influenza A(H3N2) virus, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, of known
embrio infectious dose 50% titer (EID ), using the CDC Influenza A
50
Subtyping Kit as the representative assays from the CDC Human Influenza
Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel.
Virus dilutions were prepared using a suspension of BPL treated A549 cells in
VTM as diluent. Triplicate samples of each dilution were extracted separately
with the previously FDA-cleared Roche MagNA Pure Compact RNA Isolation
Kit, as well as the investigational nucleic acids extraction instrument platform
and the relevant extraction method. The Roche MagNA Pure 96 was evaluated
with the Roche DNA and Viral NA Small Volume Kit. The QIAGEN EZ1
Advanced XL was evaluated with the QIAGEN EZ1DSP Virus Kit and the
QIAGEN EZ1 RNA Tissue Mini Kit.
Extracted RNA was tested with the InfA and H3 assays from the CDC
Influenza A Subtyping Kit using Invitrogen SuperScript III Platinum One-Step
RT-PCR System (Invitrogen SuperScript™) and utilizing the ABI 7500 Fast
Dx real-time PCR system.
The pre-established acceptance criteria for demonstrating LoD equivalence
between the previously FDA-cleared and the investigational extraction
methods was defined as a demonstration of 100% positivity (3 out of 3
replicates) at either the same endpoint concentration or within one 5-fold
dilution. The results of the study are summarized in Table 4 to Table 6 below.

3. Clinical studies:
Performance testing natural clinical specimens using the two additional nucleic
acids extraction instrument platforms with the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-
Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel test kits, the Roche MagNA Pure 96 and the
QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL instrument platforms, was evaluated in a study
using the CDC Influenza A Subtyping Kit as the representative assays from the
CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to demonstrate
equivalent performance when testing natural clinical specimens to a nucleic
acids extraction instrument platform and extraction method combination that was
previously FDA-cleared for use with the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time
Diagnostic Panel test kits (the comparator).
The Roche MagNA Pure 96 was evaluated using the Roche DNA and Viral NA
Small Volume Kit. The QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL was evaluated using the
QIAGEN EZ1 DSP Virus Kit and the QIAGEN EZ1 RNA Tissue Mini Kit. The
comparator was the Roche MagNA Pure Compact instrument using the RNA
Isolation Kit.
The study was conducted internally testing a set of retrospective clinical
specimens collected during the 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 influenza seasons. A
total of thirty clinical specimens that were previously determined to be positive for
influenza A(H3) virus and thirty negative clinical specimens were evaluated with
the InfA, H3, and RP assays from the CDC Influenza A Subtyping Kit as
representative assays from the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR
Diagnostic Panel. Testing was performed using Invitrogen SuperScript and
utilizing the ABI 7500 Fast Dx real-time PCR system. The study results are
summarized in the Table 7 to Table 9 below.
