L. Test Principle:
The Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay is performed on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems
(GeneXpert Dx, GeneXpert Infinity-48s, and GeneXpert Infinity-80 systems) that automate
nucleic acid extraction, amplification and detection in single-use, disposable cartridges. Each
cartridge contains primers and probes for detection of the targeted region of the S. pyogenes
chromosome (if present) and a Sample Processing Control (SPC). The SPC and a separate
Probe Check Control (PCC) are used by the GeneXpert systems to monitor reagent and
process integrity.
Throat swab specimens for testing with the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay are collected using
the Copan Liquid Amies Elution Swab (ESwab) Collection and Transport System. Upon
receipt in the testing laboratory, the ESwab tube is mixed by shaking and 300µL of the
6

--- Page 7 ---
transport medium is added to an Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay cartridge using a disposable
transfer pipette. The operator then initiates the test from the user interface and loads the
cartridge into the GeneXpert instrument, after which all process steps are performed
automatically.
Once complete, the final result report can be viewed on-screen and/or printed. Results are
reported as Strep A DETECTED, Strep A NOT DETECTED, INVALID (SPC failure), ERROR
(SPC and PCC failure) or NO RESULT (insufficient data collected). Instructions for retesting
are provided for samples with indeterminate results.
The Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay has an Early Termination Feature whereby results for
samples that are strongly positive for S. pyogenes are reported prior to completion of the full
number of PCR cycles designated in the assay definition file.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To estimate the components of variance associated with the Xpert Xpress Strep A
Assay a Reproducibility Study was conducted at 3 sites, with 2 operators per site.
Each operator tested a 3 member panel of samples in duplicate twice per day over 6
days using 3 lots of reagents (3 sites x 2 operators/site x 2 panels/day x 2
replicates/panel member x 6 days = 144 results/panel member). Two sites conducted
testing using the GeneXpert Dx and one site used the Infinity-80. Samples were
prepared using simulated throat swab matrix in Liquid Amies transport medium and
stored at 2-8°C until testing. Separate studies were conducted to demonstrate
equivalent assay performance with simulated and natural throat swab matrix (Section
M(2)(b)). The panel members used in the Reproducibility Study are summarized in
Table 1.

When the study was initially performed, there was an unexpectedly high rate of
indeterminate results (47/432 = 10.8%), although no false positive or false negative
results were observed (i.e., there was 100% agreement at all target levels among
samples with valid results). An investigation showed that the high rate of
indeterminate results was due to a combination of the duration of storage of the

simulated samples prior to testing, in combination with the specific reagent lots used
in the study. Even though the results of the Reproducibility Study were acceptable,
the study was repeated using new panel members that were stored for a shorter
duration prior to testing, as well as new reagent lots. The results of the repeat study
are described below.
Eleven (11) indeterminate results were obtained over the course of the repeat study
(ERROR: 5; INVALID: 4 and NO RESULT: 2) for an initial indeterminate rate of
2.5% (11/432). In all cases, the expected results were obtained upon retesting.
After retesting, percent agreement with the expected results for Negative and
Moderate Positive target levels was 100% (144/144). For Low Positive samples, the
percent agreement was 98.6% (142/144). ANOVA (Analysis Of Variance) was
performed to assess the variance components of the Ct values for the S. pyogenes and
SPC targets (Table 2). The total variation for all targets was between 0.9 and 2.3 Ct
(2.5-6.6%).
The Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay demonstrated acceptable reproducibility across sites,
GeneXpert systems, operators, panel members and reagent lots.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Internal Controls
Each Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay includes two types of Internal Control to monitor
the performance of the system:
Sample Processing Control (SPC): Designed to monitor bacterial lysis and sample
inhibition. Test results are reported as INVALID if the SPC fails.
Probe Check Control (PCC): Fluorescence measurement to monitor probe
rehydration and integrity, as well as filling of the reaction tube. Test results are
reported as ERROR if the PCC fails.
The performance of the Internal Controls was verified by testing 29 potential failure
modes due to errors in the manufacture of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay cartridges
or the assay procedure. Under the conditions tested, no false positive results were
obtained and all S. pyogenes negative samples were reported as either Negative, Error
or Invalid. Two false negative results were obtained with S. pyogenes positive
samples, the remainder of which were reported as Positive, Error or Invalid. The
device manufacturer implemented appropriate measures by which to mitigate the
risks associated with the failure modes that gave rise to false negative results,
including use of a fixed volume pipette for sample transfer and 100% manual
inspection during cartridge assembly.
External Controls
The device labeling includes information regarding the availability of commercially
prepared External Positive and Negative Controls. These External Controls were run
each day During the Clinical Study for the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay (Section
M(3)(a)) prior to testing of any clinical specimens. A summary of the results obtained
is shown in Table 3.

--- Page 11 ---
An additional evaluation of the recommended External Controls was conducted by
testing 3 lots of each control material with 3 lots of Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay
reagents. All 180 pairs (100%) of the External Positive Negative Controls tested
produced the expected results.
Specimen Stability
The stability of throat swab specimens for use with the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay
was determined analytically by testing ESwabs seeded with pooled throat swab
matrix in the presence and absence of S. pyogenes strain ATCC BAA-946 at
approximately 3X LoD (26 CFU/mL). Specimens were placed at different
temperatures and tested at pre-specified intervals. Results were analyzed qualitatively
and by ANOVA to assess differences in Ct values for the S. pyogenes and SPC targets
over time. No false negative or false positive results were observed during the course
of the study, although a statistically significant increase in Ct values for the SPC was
observed with S. pyogenes negative specimens after storage for 8 days at 8°C. As a
result, the claimed stability of throat swab specimens at 2-8°C was restricted to ≤6
days. The study also demonstrated the stability of specimens at 15-30°C for ≤2 days.
Reagent Stability
The shelf-life of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay cassettes was evaluated in a real-
time stability study performed on three lots of reagents that were stored under
different conditions. The results from the study to-date support assignment of an
expiration date 6 months from the day of manufacture for the assay cassettes when
stored under the recommended conditions.
Cartridge Hold Time
After loading onto the GeneXpert Infinity System, assay cartridges may have to wait
for a GeneXpert module to become available before being processed. A study was
therefore conducted to determine the maximum permissible interval between addition
of a sample to an Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay cartridge and testing on the GeneXpert
Infinity System. The study was performed with S. pyogenes positive (3X LoD; 26
CFU/mL) and negative samples prepared with simulated throat swab matrix. The
samples were added to Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay cartridges that were held for up to
5 hours under different environmental conditions prior to testing (i.e., ambient
temperature/humidity, 25°C/75% relative humidity or 35°C/ambient humidity). The
expected results were obtained at each time point and there were no important
differences in Ct values under any of the conditions tested. The results of the study
support the recommended maximum interval of 4.5 hours from sample addition to the
Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay cartridges to processing on the GeneXpert Infinity
System, with a maximum of 4 hours on the deck of the instrument.
d. Detection limit:
Determination of the Limit of Detection
The analytical sensitivity of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay was evaluated by testing
dilutions of two strains of S. pyogenes in pooled throat swab matrix. The Limit of
11

--- Page 12 ---
Detection (LoD) was determined for each strain using logistic regression according to
the guidance in CLSI Document EP17-A2. Testing was performed using two lots of
reagents and six different concentrations of each strain ranging from <2 to 35
CFU/mL of ESwab Transport Medium, in addition to S. pyogenes negative samples.
The LoD point estimates were confirmed by testing an additional 20 replicates of
each strain at the claimed LoD target level. At least 19/20 replicates had to produce
positive results in order for the LoD to be considered confirmed. The results of the
LoD Study are shown in Table 4.

Analytical Reactivity/Inclusivity
A study was conducted to demonstrate the ability of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay
to detect strains of S. pyogenes representing different emm sequence types, including
representatives of those types most commonly isolated in cases of pharyngitis in the
U.S. (Table 5). A total of 24 strains were tested at a concentration of 26 CFU/mL in
simulated throat swab matrix (Section M(2)(b)), corresponding to ~3X LoD, with
four replicates per strain. All 26 strains were successfully detected. These results are
acceptable.

Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). The assay region was shown to be well conserved,
with limited evidence of polymorphisms that could affect primer or probe
hybridization. The potential for false-negative Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay results
due to unforeseen sequence variation is noted as a Limitation in the device labeling.
e. Analytical specificity:
The analytical specificity of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay was evaluated by testing
a panel of 63 potentially cross-reactive strains of bacteria, including 15 non-Group A
species of Streptococcus, one strain of yeast and six viruses in simulated throat swab
matrix (Table 6).
Each strain was tested in triplicate at a concentration of ≥106 CFU/mL for bacteria
and yeast, and ≥105 TCID for viruses. In all cases, the expected results were
50
obtained and there was no evidence of the potential for false-positive results due to
cross-reaction with non-target organisms. These results are acceptable.

Bioinformatic Analysis
The specificity of the Xpert Xpress Strep A primers and probes for the targeted
sequence was also evaluated through extensive in silico BLAST analysis which
showed that positive results with species other than S. pyogenes are unlikely to occur.
Carry-over Contamination Study
To determine the potential for sample-to-sample contamination using the Xpert
Xpress Strep A Assay, testing was performed with alternating “high positive” (>1 x
106 CFU/mL of ESwab Transport Medium) and negative samples that were prepared
using simulated throat swab matrix. The study was conducted on two GeneXpert
Systems (one GX-IV and one GX-XVI) with 20 high positive and 21 negative
samples per instrument. No false-positive of false-negative results were obtained on
either system and the results were therefore determined to be acceptable.
f. Assay cut-off:
Thresholds and cut-offs for the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay are embedded within the
Assay Definition File that also encodes the instrument settings required to perform
the test. The valid Ct ranges for the S. pyogenes target and SPC are shown in Table 7.

In addition to fixed algorithm parameters within the software Assay Definition File
for the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay, Lot Specific Parameters (LSP) are also generated
for every lot of assay reagents to account for potential variations in production. The
LSP are embedded within the barcode of each assay cartridge and are transferred to
the GeneXpert instrument system when the barcode is scanned.
g. Assay interference:
The potential for interference with the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay was evaluated
with endogenous and exogenous substances that may be present in throat swab
specimens, as well as a representative panel of commensal or potentially pathogenic
microorganisms. Testing was performed using simulated throat swab matrix (Section
M(2)(b)) in the presence of S. pyogenes ATCC BAA-946 at approximately 3X LoD
(26 CFU/mL). S. pyogenes negative samples were also included to assess the
potential for interference with the SPC. In addition to analysis of qualitative test
results, ANOVA was used to assess differences in Ct values for the S. pyogenes and
SPC targets in relation to appropriate control conditions without any interfering
substances or organisms present.
Interfering Substances Study
All S. pyogenes positive and negative samples (n = 8 per condition) were correctly
identified in the presence of each of the potentially inhibitory substances shown in
Table 8 and there were no statistically significant differences in Ct values between
the test and control conditions for either the SPC or S. pyogenes targets. Nevertheless,
a significant reduction in fluorescence intensity was observed for the S. pyogenes
target in the presence of antiseptic mouthwash at 6.5% w/v. These results are noted in
the device labeling.

The list of microorganisms tested is shown in Table 9. Each of the species was tested
at ≥106 CFU/mL of ESwab Transport Medium. The Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay
correctly identified all the S. pyogenes positive and negative specimens in the study (n
= 4 per condition) and there were no statistically significant differences in Ct values
between the test samples and controls. However, a reduction in fluorescence intensity
was observed for both the S. pyogenes target and SPC in the presence of a high

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
Comparison of Fresh and Frozen Cell Stocks
Specimens for analytical evaluation of assay performance were prepared using S.
pyogenes cell stocks that were grown on Tryptic Soy Agar plates for 18-24 hours,
suspended in Typtic Soy Broth containing 15% (v/v) glycerol and frozen at -80°C.
The concentration of the stocks was determined by performing viable counts. Testing
of samples prepared from fresh cell stocks and cell stocks that were frozen at -80°C
for 10 days showed negligible difference in qualitative assay performance or Ct
values. Use of frozen cells stocks in preparation of samples for analytical testing was
therefore deemed acceptable.
Comparison of Performance with Natural and Simulated Matrices
To provide a sufficient quantity of material for testing, a simulated throat matrix was
used for the majority of Analytical Studies. To represent a worst case scenario, for
each sample, the ESwab Transport Medium was seeded with 150µL of simulated
matrix (equal to the absorptive capacity of the swab head). Studies were performed in
accordance with the standard assay procedure by transferring 300µL of the simulated
matrix to the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay cartridge.
To assess the suitability of the simulated matrix for use in analytical testing, a
comparison study was conducted to confirm that the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay
performed similarly in the presence of natural and simulated throat swab matrix.
Testing was performed with S. pyogenes ATCC BAA-946 at levels close to the LoD
of the assay. The results are summarized in Table 10 and show that the pre-defined
acceptance criteria were met at each target level and therefore that the assay exhibited
similar analytical sensitivity when performed in the presence of either natural or
simulated matrix. Ct values for the S. pyogenes and SPC targets were also similar in
both matrices. The results of this study support the use of simulated matrix in the
Analytical Studies to characterize the performance of the Xpert Xpress Strep A
Assay.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The performance of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay was evaluated in two multicenter
studies that were conducted at a total of nine (9) clinical sites in the U.S. Specimens
were collected from subjects who presented with a sore throat and at least one other
symptom that was characteristic of pharyngitis (e.g., tonsillar exudate, tender cervical
lymphadenopathy or fever). All the specimens were collected using the Copan Liquid
Amies Elution Swab (ESwab) Collection and Transport System and were used for
both Xpert Xpress Strep A testing and the reference culture method. One study
evaluated performance of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay using residual, de-
identified specimens that were left over from standard of care testing (1st swab), while
the second study evaluated specimens that were collected prospectively under
informed consent following the collection of swabs for use in standard of care patient
management (2nd swab).
Testing with the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay was conducted at each of the clinical
sites. Residual sample after Xpert testing was shipped at 2-8°C to a central laboratory
for reference culture (inoculation of 10µL transport medium onto Trypticase Soy
Agar with 5% Sheep Blood and incubation at 35°C in 5% CO ). All reference
2
cultures were inoculated within 48 hours of specimen collection. Isolated colonies

that exhibited b-hemolysis were typed by latex agglutination (Remel Streptex).
Culture plates that did not exhibit b-hemolytic colonies after 48 hours were recorded
as negative for Group A Streptococcus.
Eight hundred and forty-four (844) specimens were initially enrolled in the two
studies. Of these, 261 were excluded from the analysis of performance due to failure
to comply with the inclusion criteria (19), reference culture procedural error (184),
delay in reference culture inoculation (31), delay in shipment (26) or labeling error
(1). A total of 583 specimens was therefore included in the analysis. On initial testing,
18/583 specimens (3.1%) produced indeterminate results (Error [9], Invalid [6], No
Result [3]). Sixteen of the 18 were retested, of which 12 produced valid results that
were included in the analysis of performance for a final indeterminate rate of 6/583
(0.9%) (Table 11).

1 25/26 specimens were tested by an alternative PCR assay with bi-directional sequencing of the
amplified products; 21/25 were positive for S. pyogenes by this method
2 10/26 subjects were positive by a rapid antigen test method used as standard of care
3 On initial testing, 18/583 specimens (3.1%) produced indeterminate results (Error (9), Invalid (6),
No Result (3)); 16/18 were retested, of which 12 produced valid results that were included in the
analysis of performance for a final indeterminate rate of 6/583 (0.9%)
The results of the two Clinical Studies were also analyzed separately to determine the
performance of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay with residual clinical specimens from
standard of care testing (1st swab) and specimens that were collected prospectively (2nd
swab) (Table 12). Although both residual and prospectively collected specimen types
yielded 100% sensitivity, higher specificity was observed with the residual specimens
(96.4% vs 90.9%).

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The performance of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay was evaluated in a Clinical Study
conducted at multiple sites in the US (Section M(3)(a)). The overall prevalence of S.
pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus) in throat swab specimens was 28.4% as determined
by the Xpert assay and 23.9% as determined by culture. The prevalence of Group A
Streptococcus as determined by the Xpert assay is shown in Table 14, stratified by the
age and gender of the subjects.

3. Specimen Identification:
Barcode scan or manual entry.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Throat swab samples are collected using the Copan Liquid Amies Elution Swab (ESwab)
and transported to the testing laboratory. The test operator briefly shakes the ESwab tube
containing the swab to elute the sample and adds 300µL of the transport medium to an
Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay cartridge using a transfer pipette. The operator then loads the
cartridge into the GeneXpert System and initiates the run from the user interface.
