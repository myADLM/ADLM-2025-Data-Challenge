H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Etest is a quantitative technique for determination of antimicrobial susceptibility of both
non-fastidious Gram-negative and Gram-positive aerobic bacteria such as
Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus species and
fastidious bacteria, such as anaerobes, N. gonorrhoeae, S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus and
Haemophilus species. The system comprises a predefined antibiotic gradient which is
used to determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), in µg/mL, of different
antimicrobial agents against microorganisms as tested on agar media using overnight
incubation.
Ceftazidime/avibactam has been shown to be active against the Gram negative aerobic
microorganisms listed below, according to the FDA label for this antimicrobial agent.
Etest CZA can be used to determine the MIC of ceftazidime/avibactam against the
microorganisms listed below:
Active both in vitro and in clinical infections:
Citrobacter freundii
Enterobacter cloacae
Escherichia coli
Klebsiella oxytoca
Klebsiella pneumoniae
Proteus mirabilis
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
The following in vitro data are available, but clinical significance is unknown:
Citrobacter koseri
Enterobacter aerogenes
Morganella morganii
Providencia rettgeri
Providencia stuartii
Serratia marcescens
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as the Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only

--- Page 3 ---
Limitations:
Due to the lack of an intermediate interpretive category for ceftazidime/avibactam, testing of
Morganella morganii with this drug has resulted in very major discrepancies for isolates that
are otherwise within essential agreement of the reference method. Testing should be
repeated using an alternative testing/reference method prior to reporting results for M.
morganii when the Etest MIC is 8 µg/mL.
The ability of Etest to detect resistance with the following microorganisms is unknown
because resistant strains were not available at the time of comparative testing. If such a
strain is observed, it should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing
Ceftazidime/Avibactam: Citrobacter koseri
4. Special instrument requirements:

L. Test Principle:
The Etest consists of a thin, inert, nonporous plastic strip that is used to determine the
antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria. One side of the strip carries the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) reading scale expressed in µg/mL. The other side of the strip contains a
predefined continuous gradient of antibiotic concentrations.
When the strip is applied to an inoculated agar surface, the preformed antibiotic gradient
immediately transfers into the agar matrix, then forming a stable, continuous and exponential
gradient of antibiotic concentrations directly underneath the strip. Bacteria growth becomes
visible during incubation, and a symmetrical inhibition ellipse centered along the strip
appears. After incubation, the MIC value is read from the scale in terms of µg/mL at
complete inhibition of bacterial growth, where the pointed end of the ellipse intersects the
strip. Since Etest generates MIC values which fall between two-fold dilutions for
interpretation, the MIC value read must be recorded to the next two-fold dilution.
The MIC gradient on Etest Ceftazidime/Avibactam ranges from 0.016 to 256 µg/mL. The

M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three external sites using 25 isolates of
gram negative bacilli that were consistent with the intended use. The isolates tested
included Citrobacter freundii (two isolates), Citrobacter koseri (two isolates),
Enterobacter aerogenes (two isolates), Enterobacter cloacae (two isolates),
Escherichia coli (five isolates), Klebsiella oxytoca (three isolates), Klebsiella
pneumoniae (three isolates) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (six isolates).
All results were within ± 1 doubling dilution of the mode MIC value for
ceftazidime/avibactam. Eleven results were on scale. The reproducibility was
acceptable at 100.0%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Inoculum Density Check. Inoculum density checks were performed for all quality
control and reproducibility organism suspensions and for 10% of the suspensions
prepared for susceptibility testing of the fresh clinical isolates. The mean inoculum
density was acceptable at 4.40 X 105 CFU/mL.
Purity Check. All clinical, challenge and reproducibility test suspensions were
subcultured to assure purity.
Growth or Device Failure. There were no growth or device failures during the
course of the study.
Quality Control Testing. Organisms recommended by both FDA and the CLSI
were tested with ceftazidime/avibactam at three sites. According to the CLSI M100
S27 document, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 must be used for routine QC testing of
ceftazidime/avibactam. The QC organisms tested included: E. coli ATCC 25922, E.
coli ATCC 35218, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853.
These QC strains were tested a minimum of 20 times per site by both the Etest and
the reference method. One quality control strain (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC
29213) was tested with the reference method only to provide additional control for
this method; 100% of the results obtained with S. aureus ATCC 29213 were in the
acceptable range. The results demonstrate that the ceftazidime/avibactam Etest can
6

--- Page 7 ---
produce quality control results in the recommended range > 95% of the time. See
Table 2 below for a summary of the QC results.
Per the recommendations in the CLSI document M100, additional testing was
performed using the reference method with K. pneumoniae 700603 with ceftazidime
alone and K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 and E. coli ATCC 35218 with ampicillin to
assure the integrity of the β-lactamase encoding plasmid. The testing demonstrated
that the QC strains maintained their resistance profiles throughout the testing as
evidenced by obtaining MIC values of 16-64 µg/mL with ceftazidime for K.
pneumoniae 700603 and obtaining MIC values of >128 µg/mL with ampicillin for the
same organism. MIC values of >32 µg/mL were obtained with ampicillin for E. coli
ATCC 35218.
The sponsor included the following comment in the device labeling: K. pneumoniae
ATCC 700603 should be used for routine QC of ceftazidime/avibactam. This QC
strain should also be tested against ceftazidime alone to ensure that the plasmid
encoding the beta-lactamase has not been lost in this strain.

Results obtained with Etest Ceftazidime/Avibactam were compared to results
obtained with the CLSI broth microdilution reference panel. The CLSI panel was
prepared and interpreted according to CLSI recommendations outlined in the CLSI
Standard: CLSI Document M07-A10, Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria that Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard – Tenth
Edition, Vol. 35, No. 2; January 2015. The testing conditions for the reference
method consisted of the following:
· Medium – Cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton Broth with appropriate dilutions of
antimicrobial solution added
· Inoculum – Direct colony suspension to achieve a suspension equivalent to a
0.5 McFarland standard suspension
· Incubation 35 °C in ambient air; 16-20 hours for all organisms
Clinical testing was performed at three sites using a total of 1153 clinical isolates
(1033 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and 120 isolates of P. aeruginosa). Of the
clinical isolates, 699 were fresh isolates (60.6 %) and 454 were stock isolates
(39.4%). Clinical isolates were tested using both Etest and the reference method.
A total of 86 challenge isolates were tested at a single site using Etest and the
reference method (54 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and 32 isolates of P.
aeruginosa).

EVAL – Evaluable isolates vmj – very major discrepancies
R – Resistant isolates
Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when the result of the reference method and that of Etest
Ceftazidime/Avibactam are within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable
results are those that are on scale for both Etest Ceftazidime/Avibactam and the reference method. Category
Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the
interpretation of Etest Ceftazidime/Avibactam.

A total of 79 resistant isolates were evaluated; however, no resistant strains of
Citrobacter koseri were evaluated. The sponsor added the following limitation to the
device labeling:
The ability of Etest to detect resistance with the following microorganisms is
unknown because resistant strains were not available at the time of comparative
testing. If such a strain is observed, it should be submitted to a reference
laboratory for further testing.
Ceftazidime/Avibactam: Citrobacter koseri
Three clinical isolates (one isolate each of P. stuartii, E. aerogenes and P.
aeruginosa) were determined to be susceptible by the reference method but resistant
with ceftazidime/avibactam Etest. Both the P. stuartii and E. aerogenes MIC results
were within essential agreement of the results obtained with the reference method.
For the single isolate of P. aeruginosa Etest results were not within essential
agreement with the reference method. However, the major error rates for
Enterobacteriaceae and for P. aeruginosa were determined to be acceptable at 0.2%
and 0.8%, respectively.
Two isolates of M. morganii were determined to be resistant by the reference method
but susceptible with Etest Ceftazidime/Avibactam resulting in an overall very major
error rate for Enterobacteriaceae of 4.4%. Because there is no intermediate
breakpoint for ceftazidime/avibactam and because the Etest MIC values obtained with
these two isolates were within essential agreement of the reference method, the
overall very major error rate for Enterobacteriaceae was adjusted to 0.0% and
considered to be acceptable. The following footnote was added to the performance
table in the device labeling:
The overall very major error rate for Enterobacteriaceae was 4.4%. The two
very major errors were one dilution apart from the reference method and as such
fall within essential agreement. Based on the essential agreement and the lack of
an intermediate breakpoint, the adjusted very major error rate is 0.0%
In addition, because both of the very major errors occurred with M. morganii (for a
very major error rate of 100% for this species) the following limitation was added to
the device labeling to address the possibility of very major errors when testing M.
morganii:
Due to the lack of an intermediate interpretive category for ceftazidime/avibactam, testing of
Morganella morganii with this drug has resulted in very major discrepancies for isolates that
are otherwise within essential agreement of the reference method. Testing should be
repeated using an alternative testing/reference method prior to reporting results for M.
morganii when the Etest MIC is 8 µg/mL.

Enzyme Group Molecular Characterization:
Isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa harboring various molecular
mechanisms of resistance noted in the FDA drug label were tested with
ceftazidime/avibactam. The following resistance mechanisms were evaluated:
· Enterobacteriaceae – ESBL, not specified, CTX-M, TEM, SHV, KPC
· P. aeruginosa – chromosomal AmpC, OprD loss, KPC, IMP, VIM, other
metallo-β-lactamase
Enterobacteriaceae isolates harboring AmpC and OXA were not evaluated. The
sponsor included the following footnote to the performance table in the device
labeling:
Enzyme characterization was not available for the following organisms at the
time of comparative testing, and therefore the performance of Etest
Ceftazidime/Avibactam is unknown for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (up-regulation
of MexXY and MexAB) and Enterobacteriaceae (OXA and AmpC).
The sponsor also included the following footnote regarding additional resistance
mechanisms:
Ceftazidime/avibactam is not active against bacteria that produce metallo-beta-
lactamase enzymes and may not have activity against gram-negative bacteria that
overexpress efflux pumps or have porin mutations.
MIC Trending
An analysis of trending was conducted using the combined clinical and challenge data
for P. aeruginosa and for Enterobacteriaceae. This trending calculation takes into
account MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilution lower or
higher compared to the reference method irrespective of whether the device MIC
values are on-scale or not.
The data for 152 P. aeruginosa results determined to be evaluable for trending
analysis showed no evidence of trending.
The data for 1061 Enterobacteriaceae results determined to be evaluable for trending
analysis is presented in Table 4.

A trend towards higher MIC readings was observed in the overall performance of
Enterobacteriaceae compared to the CLSI broth microdilution method which
raises concerns for the potential occurrence of major errors. The sponsor included
the following footnote to the performance table to address the trending observed
for ceftazidime/avibactam:
Etest Ceftazidime/Avibactam MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or
