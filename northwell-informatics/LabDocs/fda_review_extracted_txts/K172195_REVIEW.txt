L. Test Principle:
Abnormal bands in serum protein electrophoregrams (SPEP), primarily those in the beta
globulin and gamma globulin zones, are suspected to be monoclonal proteins (M-proteins,
paraproteins, monoclonal immunoglobulins). The presence of monoclonal protein as
indicated by SPEP leads to testing of sample with an IF technique to detect and identify the
monoclonal protein components, using the HYDRAGEL IF assay.
Daratumumab is a human therapeutic IgG Kappa monoclonal antibody and as such, during
the clinical monitoring of patients treated with daratumumab, this antibody is visualized as a
band detected by serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation in the gamma region.
The presence of daratumumab can be interpreted as the presence of an endogenous IgG
Kappa monoclonal protein, and confound clinical interpretation of the results of the assay.
The HYDRASHIFT daratumumab immunofixation procedure performed on HYDRAGEL
IF 2/4 gel is based on the creation of a daratumumab/anti-daratumumab antibody complex
that is shifted outside the gammaglobulin zone. With the HYDRASHIFT daratumumab
procedure, the daratumumab/anti-daratumumab antibody complex is visualized in alpha-1
zone on IgG and Kappa immunofixation tracks and the daratumumab interference is
removed from the gamma zone. This can allow for the visualization of any endogenous
IgG-kappa monoclonal proreins by IF that may have been masked by the endogenous
daratumamab.
Daratumumab CONTROL is a qualitative quality control for the assay.

M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
All results met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To evaluate precision (repeatability and reproducibility), a panel of ten serum
samples, including one normal serum sample (daratumumab control) one
electrophoresis (ELP) control and eight serum samples with different monoclonal
protein components, were tested using the HYDRASHIFT 2/4 daratumumab
procedure used in conjunction with each of the following kits: HYDRAGEL 4 IF
Acid violet Standard mask, and HYDRAGEL 4 IF Acid violet Dynamic mask. The
samples tested for precision are described in the table below:
Sample Sample Type
Number
1 Normal (Daratumumab control)
2 IT/IF control (ELP)
IgG, L + IgA, K + IgM, L
3 IgG, K
4 IgG, L
5 IgA, K
6 IgA, L
7 IgM, K
8 IgM, L
9 Kappa free
10 Lambda free
Within-run precision, repeatability:
Each of the above 10 samples was tested four times within the same gel. Samples 1
and 2 were run without addition of daratumumab as controls. Samples 3–10 were run
with daratumumab (1g/L) and without daratumumab. All samples were run with
both Standard Mask (SM) and Dynamic Mask (DM) for a total of eight runs per
sample. The gels results were read and evaluated by two readers for the presence or
absence of monoclonal proteins and the presence of the daratumumab/anti-
daratumumab antibody complex visualized in the alpha-1 zone on IgG and Kappa
immunofixation tracks. Repeatability was evaluated visually for the concordance of
band presence from the same sample. Results showed 100 % of concordance for the
same sample, and between the same sample tested with SM and DM and between
readers. The results are summarized below:
· Native samples were 100% concordant when run on SM and DM
· Replicates of daratumumab spiked samples were 100% concordant between
SM and DM. Samples with monoclonal proteins other than IgG Kappa were
also 100% concordant with native samples
· As expected, results that were different between native and spiked samples
showed shifted bands in the IgG and Kappa immunofixation tracks from the

gammaglobulin zone and the band was visualized in the alpha-1 zone
Reproducibility between days, between lots and between instruments:
Reproducibility was tested with the same panel of 10 samples, as described above.
Samples 1 and 2 were run without addition of daratumumab as controls.Samples 3-
10 were tested with and without daratumumab (1g/L). The samples were run with
the four gel configuration on SM and DM using three HYDRASYS 2 instruments,
with three lots of HYDRASHIFT IF kits, over three days resulting in nine replicates
per sample on SM and nine replicates per sample on DM. All results were read by
two readers. Reproducibility was evaluated visualy for the concordance of
monoclonal proteins and the daratumumab/anti-daratumumab antibody complex.
Results that were different between native and spiked sample showed, as expected
the shifted band of the daratumumab/anti-daratumumab antibody complex in the
alpha-1 zone of IgG and Kappa Immunofixation tracks. There was 100%
concordance for the all the samples between days, instruments and lots, between SM
and DM application methods and between the two readers.
An additional study was done to demonstrate reproducibilitybetween two and four
gel configuration and between DM and SM applicators. 163 patient samples were
used that included negative samples and samples with monoclonal protein
components including IgG-Kappa. The samples included 80 daratumumab-treated
samples and 62 samples that were tested native and spiked with daratumumab.
Assays were performed with HYDRASHIFT 2/4 daratumumab procedure used in
conjunction with:
HYDRAGEL 4 IF Acid Violet Standard mask kit
HYDRAGEL 4 IF Acid Violet Dynamic mask kit
HYDRAGEL 2 IF Acid Violet Standard mask kit
HYDRAGEL 2 IF Acid Violet Dynamic mask kit
There was 100% concordance between the two and four gel configuration and
between the DM and SM procedures.

Stability:
The test reagents except for the daratumumab control and the anti-daratumumab
antibody were cleared in the predicate device. All the components are stable until the
expiration date indicated on the kit box or on the components labels.
Detection Antibody: the anti-daratumumab detection antibody is murine anti-human
daratumumab IgG. The antibody stability was tested in an accelerated stability study
for two months at 18-22°C with three lots of anti-daratumumab antibody. One
month acceleratated stability is equal to one year stability at 2–8°C. Results were
compared to results of anti-duratumumab stored at 2–8°C for two months, using four
gel configuration and SM and DM application methods, with four serum samples
with monoclonal proteins (IgM Kappa, IgA Kappa and two IgG Kappa). Open vial
stability was tested in real time at 2–8°C. The results are summarized in the table
below. Additional real-time stability testing is ongoing.
Sample stability: Real-time stability was evaluated on six IgG Kappa samples from
patients treated with daratumumab. Testing was performed using SM and the two gel
configuration. Results were compared to the same sample at time zero. There was
100% concordance between reference (T0) and test results. Testing was performed
for:
· Three months at −26°C to −30°C
· For 10 days at 2–8°C
· For three days at 19–25°C
Control Stability: The daratumumab control stability was tested with three lots using
DM and SM with the four gel configurationfor using a normal sample tested in four
replicates. Accelerated stability study was performed for three months at 18–22° C.
One month acceleratated stability is equal to one year stability at 2–8°C. Results
were compared to the same lots tested at time zero and at the same time points when
stored at 2–8°C. Real time stability was performed to evaluate open vial stability at
2–8°C and at −26 to −30°C. In addition the control was tested as reconstituted,
frozen, and then subjected to freeze/thaw cycles. The results are summarized in the
table below. Real-time stability is ongoing.

d. Detection limit:
Sensitivity:
A study was done to determine the threshold detection value of visualization of the
daratumumab and/or the daratumumab/anti-daratumumab antibody complex. Six
serum samples, including two normal serum samples and four serum samples with
different monoclonal components, were spiked with daratumumab at different
concentrations for a final daratumumab concentration of 3.0, 2.0, 1.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.3,
0.2, 0.1 and 0.0 g/L. Samples were analyzed with the HYDRASHIFT 2/4
daratumumab procedure using the 4 gel configuration and SM and DM application
method.
The serum samples that were used in the study are described in the table below:
Sample Sample type Total Band Protein
Concentration
1 Pool of normal serum 73.3 g/L
2 Pool of normal serum 37.3 g/L
3 IgG Kappa 5.0 g/L
4 IgA Kappa 8.3 g/L and 1.7
5 IgM Kappa 2.9 g/L
6 IgM Lambda and Kappa free 1.2 g/L
The results showed that the limit of detection for visualization of the
daratumumab/anti-daratumumab antibody complex at the alpha-1 zone of G Kappa
tracks is 0.3 g/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference: The performance of the HYDRASHIFT 2/4 daratumumab procedure
was evaluated in the presence of common interfering factors. Testing was
performed based CLSI guideline EP7-A2. No interference with the HYDRASHIFT
2/4 daratumumab procedure, was detected with the intereferents up to the

configuration, with both SM and DM, and two readers. For samples with visual
bands in the IgG and Kappa tracks, the HYDRASHIFT 2/4 daratumumab
demonstrated that shifting of the daratumumab band allowed evaluation of whether
endogenous daratumamab is present. The samples tested at the two sites are

*** 172/198 samples were analyzed at both sites.
Samples were run with HYDRAGEL IF Acid Violet kit procedure (predicate) and
compared to samples run with the HYDRASHIFT 2/4 daratumumab procedure (the
test method). The results were evaluated as “Same” or as “Different”.
Not unexpectedly, there were a large number of samples that had a different
characterization/results between the two methods (113 samples at Site 1 and 98
samples at Site 2). For 100% of these samples , the difference of interpretation was
due to the presence of daratumumab in the IgG Kappa monoclonal component in the
sample, interpreted in the predicate as positive. That band was different in the test
method because the the daratumumab/anti-daratumumab complex was shifted out of
the gamma zone of the gel. Therefore, the discordant results are explained by the
assay desing differences. There was 100% concordance between the results of the
172 samples tested at the two sites.
