L. Test Principle
The Atellica IM Folate assay is a competitive immunoassay using direct chemiluminescent
technology. The sample is pretreated to release the folate from endogenous binding proteins
in the sample. Folate in the patient sample competes with acridinium-ester-labeled folate in
the lite reagent for a limited amount of biotin-labeled folate binding protein. Biotin-labeled
folate binding protein binds to avidin that is covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles in
the solid phase. An inverse relationship exists between the amount of folate present in the
patient sample and the amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the system.
The Atellica IM Folate assay reports system generated serum folate concentration and
system-generated hemolysate folate value.
RBC folate (ng/mL) is calculated using the following formula:
RBC folate (ng/mL) = (Folate result for hemolysate (ng/mL) x 21 x 100)/hematocrit

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A 20-day precision study was performed according to CLSI EP5-A3. Four human
serum and 5 whole blood samples and 2 levels of controls were tested using 3 lots of
reagents. The samples were tested in duplicates per run, 2 runs per day for 20
working days. All 3 lots of reagents yielded similar results. The precision study
summary is presented in the table below showing the results for one representative
lot.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
i. Linearity of the Atellica IM Folate assay for serum was performed according to
CLSI EP06-A guideline. Nine samples with folate concentrations distributed
throughout the assay range were prepared using human serum pools with high and
low levels of folate. The concentration range tested was 0.46 - 24.44 ng/mL.
Each sample was test in triplicate and the mean was used in the regression
analysis.
The result of the linear regression is: y = 0.9706 x – 0.2368, with an r2 = 0.9956
The results of the study supports that the assay is linear across the claimed
measuring range of 0.56- 24 ng/mL for serum.

Linearity of Atellica IM Folate assay for red blood cells was demonstrated by
comparing the test result of the candidate device to that obtained from a
previously cleared red blood cell folate device. Red blood cell lysates with folate
concentrations between the measuring interval of 0.98 to 17.51 ng/mL (11
samples) were tested. The following regression result was obtained: y = 0.917 x +
0.596, r2 =0.9834.
The results of the study supports that the assay is linear across the claimed
measuring range of 0.98 – 17.51 ng/mL for red blood cells (prior to calculation).
ii. Sample dilution study:
Studies were performed to determine the sample recovery after a 1:2 dilution.
Five human serum samples with folate concentrations up to 32.42 ng/mL were
diluted 1:2 with Atellica IM Fol DIL and assayed for recovery. The average
percent differences for the diluted sample versus the expected concentration was
within 10%.
In the labeling, the sponsor states that dilution is for serum only; hemolysates
with concentrations above the claimed measuring interval should not be diluted.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Atellica IM Folate assay is traceable to an internal standard manufactured using
highly purified material (N 5 methyl tetrahydrofolate). Assigned values for
calibrators are traceable to this standardization.
d. Detection limit:
LoB, LoD and LoQ of serum matrix was determined using 3 lots of Atellica IM
Folate reagents.
For limit of blank (LoB), 5 blank serum samples (unique human serum sample pools
that have been filtered, stripped and mixed with Siemens Folate BA Diluent) were
tested on 2 analyzers in 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 5 test days, yielding a
total of 200 blank measurements per reagent lot. LoB was determined as the 95th
percentile of the measurement of the blank samples.
For limit of detection (LoD), 6 contrived low level serum samples were analyzed on 2
analyzers in 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 15 runs yielding a total of 60
measurements per reagent lot for each sample. LoD corresponds to the lowest
concentration of folate that can be detected with a probability of 95%.
5

--- Page 6 ---
For limit of quantitation (LoQ), 8 serum samples with folate concentrations ranging
from 0.27 to 1.25 ng/mL were assayed in 10 replicates, 2 runs per day per reagent
lot, over a period of 5 days. LoQ was defined as the analyte concentration for which
CV≤20% is met.
Lot specific LoB, LoD, and LoQ values were calculated, and the highest of the 3 lots
are the claimed serum LoB, LoD and LoQ, respectively. A similar study was
performed for whole blood samples collected using lithium heparin and K EDTA,
2
respectively using 2 lots of reagents.
The results of the detection limit studies are summarized below.
Serum Whole Blood
LoB 0.19 ng/mL 0.00 ng/mL
LoD 0.38 ng/mL 0.21 ng/mL
LoQ 0.56 ng/mL 0.56 ng/mL
The claimed measuring range for serum is 0.56 - 24 ng/mL and for red blood cells
(before applying conversion factors) is 0.98 – 17.57 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A2 to evaluate the
performance of the Atellica IM Folate assay in the presence of endogenous and other
interfering substances. Two human serum sample pools with folate concentrations of
approximately 4.0 and 12.0 ng/mL were spiked with potential interferents. The
sponsor defines non-significant interference as less than 10% bias between the spiked
sample and the control.
The following substances were tested up to the levels indicated and demonstrated no
significant interference:

respectively). The results of are shown below.

*Interference could not be calculated because the results of the biotin spiked samples were
above the claimed analytical measuring range.
Cross reactivity was evaluated in the Atellica IM Folate immunoassay using a normal
human serum sample and blank assay diluent for each test compound. An aliquot of
each sample was spiked with the potential cross-reactant and a second aliquot of the
base pool was spiked with just the diluent to serve as a control sample. Multiple
replicates of the test and control samples were processed. Cross-reactivity was
calculated as the % difference between the mean test and control sample results, with
respect to the test compound concentration. Cross-reactivity results are presented
below.
Cross-Reactant Concentration tested (ng/mL) Cross-Reactivity
Amethopterin 150 ≤2%
Aminopterin 75 ≤1%
Folinic Acid 25 ≤4%
The sponsor states the following limitations in the labeling:
· Hemolysis significantly increases folate values in serum due to the high folate
concentrations found in red blood cells.

· Methotrexate and leucovorin interfere with folate measurement because these
drugs cross-react with folate binding proteins.
· Specimens that contain biotin at a concentration of 50 ng/mL (in serum) or 75
ng/mL (in whole blood) demonstrate less than or equal to 10% change in results.
Biotin concentrations greater than these may lead to falsely elevated results for
patient samples.
· Do not test samples from patients who take high doses of biotin. If biotin
interference is suspected, follow your established internal procedures to
investigate the interference or test with an alternate assay that is not affected by
biotin interference.

The sponsor states in the labeling that:
“Laboratories should consider these expected values as guidelines only. The data were
obtained on apparently healthy males and females from the United States. Because of
population demographic factors, diet, and assay methods, each laboratory should
determine its own expected values for the diagnostic evaluation of patient results.”
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
