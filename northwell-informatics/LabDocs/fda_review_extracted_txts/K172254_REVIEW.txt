1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision. A panel of eight specimens were tested. Each specimen was tested in 4
replicates on each run, two runs per day over 12 days for a total of 96 tests for each
specimen. Samples were selected based on FDA cleared B. burgdorferi ELISA
results, including 2 low negative samples, 2 high negative samples, 1 cutoff sample, 1
low positive sample and 2 moderate positive samples. The cutoff specimen presented
reactions near the cutoff control for two bands.
Qualitative agreement was 100% for the results of seven specimens; the cutoff
specimen produced a positive result in 78/96 replicates (81.3%). A summary of
results by antibody line is provided in Table 1below:

Reproducibility. A panel of eight specimens was tested at three laboratories (2
external, 1 internal). At each site, each specimen was tested in 4 replicates per run,
two runs per day over 12 days for a total of 288 tests. Results were read by 2 human
operators at each site, equaling a total of 576 read-outs. Samples were selected based
on FDA cleared B. burgdorferi ELISA results The cutoff specimen was chosen so
that two bands were near the cutoff control.

Final positive or negative agreement was 100% for both low negative samples, one
high negative and one moderate positive sample. One high negative sample produced
a 99.7 % negative agreement. One low positive and one moderate positive sample
produced a 99.3% positive agreement. The cut off sample produced a 68.4% positive

Interferences:
Five (5) specimens (2 negative, 3 positive) were spiked with hemoglobin (2g/L),
unconjugated bilirubin (342 μmol/L), rheumatoid factor (100 IU/ml), triglycerides
(3.7 mmol/L) and total cholesterol (13 mmol/L), and then tested for Borrelia
burgdorferi IgM following guidance of CLSI EP7-A2. Samples were tested with and
without interfering agents. Qualitative agreement between results, spiked and
unspiked was 100% for all interferents tested.
f. Assay cut-off:
Cut-off was established by testing a panel of Lyme positive specimens along with
healthy normal and controls. The Cut-Off Control Line was derived from these
studies and provides a qualitative visual reference point for determination of bands as
positive or negative.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Prospective Study:
Specimens that were determined positive using an FDA cleared first-step EIA assay
were tested prospectively at three geographically distinct study sites. The specimens
testing positive (n=676) on a FDA cleared first-step EIA were tested with Lyme B.
burgdorferi (IgM) MarStripe Test and an FDA cleared immunoblot. Interpretation of
immunoblot results followed the recommended criteria described by the Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) and the Second National Conference on Serological
Diagnosis of Lyme Disease. The results are summarized below in Table 6.

CDC Panel Testing: A reference panel from the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (Lyme Disease Validation Panel n=10, Lyme Disease Basic Research
Panel n=32) was tested with the Lyme B. burgdorferi (IgM) MarStripe Test and the
predicate device.

Note: The results are presented as a means to convey further information on the performance of this
assay with a masked, characterized serum panel. This does not imply an endorsement of the assay by
the CDC.
b. Clinical specificity: N/A
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): N/A
4. Clinical cut-off: N/A
5. Expected Values/Reference range:
The performance of the Lyme B. burgdorferi (IgM) MarStripe Test was evaluated in
clinical studies using sera obtained from the following: 1) patients meeting a case
definition for Lyme disease based on physician diagnosis, B. burgdorferi culture, and
other laboratory tests; 2) patients for whom requests were made for routine B. burgdorferi
serology tests; and 3) apparently healthy individuals from endemic and non-endemic
regions for Lyme disease.
The first table summarizes the presence of B. burgdorferi specific bands in specimens
from documented cases of Lyme disease. Specimens have been grouped by the time after
onset of symptoms.
