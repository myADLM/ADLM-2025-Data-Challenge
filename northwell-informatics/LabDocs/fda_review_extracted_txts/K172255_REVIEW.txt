3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
The following information is included in labeling
· Results obtained with E. cloacae and ceftolozane/tazobactam have shown
discrepant MICs when compared with the reference method when read by the
MicroScan instruments. Therefore, prior to reporting, these isolate results should
be interpreted manually.
· Results obtained P. rettgeri and S. liquefaciens and ceftolozane/tazobactam have
shown discrepant MICs when compared with the reference method when read by
the WalkAway instrument and inoculated using the Prompt. Therefore, prior to
reporting, these isolate results should be interpreted manually.
· Ceftolozane/tazobactam results obtained with M. morganii and P. rettgeri isolates
using the Prompt Inoculation system have shown potential major errors.
Therefore, prior to reporting, isolates with resistant results should be retested
using the turbidity inoculation method.

Twenty-Seventh Informational Supplement
3. CLSI M7-A10: Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria that
Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard – Tenth Edition
L. Test Principle:
The MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panels with Ceftolozane/tazobactam are
antimicrobial susceptibility tests that are miniaturizations of the broth dilution susceptibility
test which have been dehydrated. Various antimicrobial agents are diluted in Mueller Hinton
broth supplemented wtih calcium and magnesium to concentrations bridging the range of
clinical interest. Breakpoint Combo panels use concentrations equivalent to the categorical
breakpoints of FDA and/or CLSI. After inoculation and rehydration with a standardized
suspension of organism and incubation of 35°C +/- 1°C for a minimum of 16 hours, the
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test organism is determined by observing
the lowest antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was performed at three sites using 17 isolates of non-
fastidious Gram negative organisms. The isolates were tested in triplicate over three
different days using both inoculation methods (Prompt, turbidity) for each reading
method (WalkAway, autoSCAN-4, manual). The isolates tested in the reproducibility
study included C. koseri (1), E. cloacae (1), E. coli (5), K. oxytoca (2), K.
pneumoniae (3), P. aeruginosa (3), P. mirabilis (1) and S. marcescens (1). The mode
MIC value was pre-determined and the reproducibility was calculated based on MIC
values falling within ±1 dilution of the mode MIC value. There were no “off-scale”
MIC results for any reading method versus inoculation method; therefore, only best
case scenario is reported in Table 2 below. Reproducibility was calculated and was
reported as greater than 95% for all combinations of reading methods and inoculation
methods. The results (Table 2) were acceptable.

Quality Control Testing:
The QC isolates recommended by both FDA and CLSI, E.coli ATCC 25922, E. coli
ATCC 35218, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were
tested a sufficient number of times (i.e., at least 20/site) at each of three testing sites.
They were tested using both turbidity and Prompt inoculation methods for the manual
read, WalkAway instrument and autoSCAN 4 instruments. The results are
summarized in Table 3 below. Greater than 95% of the results obtained for each
inoculation method with each read method were acceptable.

for each organism tested. Colony counts were performed using the QC strain E. coli
ATCC 25922 for both Prompt and Turbidity inoculation methods during QC testing.
In addition, data was also collected during the Reproducibility phase using the
Prompt inoculum preparation method. Colony counts were performed weekly on the
quality control strain E. coli ATCC 25922. Colony counts were also done once at
each site for each Reproducibility isolate. All colony counts were acceptable.
Growth Failure Rate
The growth rate for all combinatinos of inoculation and read methods was 100%.
Purity Check:
Purity check plates were performed on all isolates from each inoculum preparation.
Prompt Inoculation Validation:
An additional study was conducted to demonstrate that additional time after
inoculating the Prompt would not have an impact on susceptibility testing prior to
panel inoculation. Prompt bottles were inoculated with C. koseri and S. liquefaciens
and tested at 0 (baseline) and 4 hours after inoculation. Panels were read by the
WalkAway, AutoScan-4 and manually and compared to the reference method. When
compared to baseline and reference results, the 4 hour incubation did not appear to
affect C. koseri susceptibility results when read by any method. In addition, the 4
hour incubation did not appear to affect S. liquefaciens susceptibility results when
compared to the reference and baseline when read manually only.

microdilution reference panel. The range of dilutions evaluated with the MicroScan
panels was 0.25/4 to 16/4 µg/mL.
Two inoculation methods were used: the Prompt Inoculation System and the turbidity
method. For the Prompt Inoculation System, inocula were prepared using the
instructions of the manufacturer. For the turbidity method, inocula were standardized
using the MicroScan Turbidity Meter to approximate a 0.5 McFarland turbidity
standard. Reference panels were inoculated using the turbidity method. Each isolate
was tested using both inoculation methods and read by the WalkAway instrument,
autoSCAN-4 instrument, and read manually; however, the primary read that was
identified as being used by most users was the WalkAway instrument with the
Prompt inoculation.
Clinical:
Clinical testing was conducted at three sites using 394 fresh, 162 recent, and 19 stock
Gram negative organisms for a cumulative of 575 isolates. These consisted of 496
Enterobacteriaceae isolates to include E. cloacae (48 isolates), E. coli (77), S.
liquefaciens (1), S. marcescens (32), C. koseri (49), K. oxytoca (47), K. pneumoniae
(88), M. morganii (41), P. mirabilis (56), P. stuartii (21), P. rettgeri (19) and P.
vulgaris (17) and 79 P. aeruginosa isolates. All isolates tested are listed in the
Indications for Use. Of these, 23 isolates were resistant to cefotolozane/tazobactam
by the reference method.
Challenge:
Additional stock challenge isolates were tested at an external study site. These
isolates consisted of organisms with known resistance mechanisms (e.g., isolates
obtained from FDA/CDC AR bank) to challenge the ability of AST system to
correctly identify the susceptibility category. Challenge testing was conducted using
118 Gram negative organisms, consisting of 20 P. aeruginosa isolates,and 98
Enterobacteriaceae including E. cloacae (13 isolates), E. coli (20), S. liquefaciens
(10), S. marcescens (4), C. koseri (13), K. oxytoca (8), K. pneumoniae (18), M.
morganii (3), P. mirabilis (7), P. stuartii (1), and P. vulgaris (1). Of these 118 Gram
negative organisms, 40 were resistant to ceftolozane/tazobactam by the reference
method.
594 Enterobacteriaceae and 99 P. aeruginosa isolates (Clinical and Challenge)
isolates were evaluated. Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6 below illustrate the performance of
testing Ceftolozane/tazobactam on the WalkAway, autoSCAN-4, and manual reads
using the Prompt and turbidity inoculation methods, respectively.

Evaluable results are those that are on-scale for both the reference panel and the
MicroScan Gram negative panel. Essential agreement (EA) occurs when there is
agreement between the MIC result of the reference method and that of MicroScan
panel within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Category
agreement occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees
exactly with the interpretation of the MicroScan panel result.
As seen in Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6, the percent EA overall for combined clinical and
challenge isolates was above 90% for all read methods and inoculation methods with
the exception of some organisms within the Enterobacteriaceae family when
inoculated with the Prompt. Specifically, E. cloacae demonstrated a performance of
83.6% (51/61) and 86.9% (53/61) when read by the WalkAway and AS-4 instruments
but when read manually, the EA increased to 90.2% (55/61). Therefore, for this
organism, the following limitation is included in the labeling:

Results obtained with E. cloacae and ceftolozane/tazobactam have shown
discrepant MICs when compared with the reference method when read by the
MicroScan instruments. Therefore, prior to reporting, these isolate results should
be interpreted manually.
M. morganii, P. rettgeri, and S. liquefaciens isolates also demonstrated less than 90%
EA [82.0% (50/61), 77.3% (34/44), 78.9% (15/19), and 36.4% (4/11) respectively]
when read by the WalkAway and inoculated using the Prompt. When the same plates
were reviewed manually, the EA when testing P. rettgeri and S. liquefaciens isolates
surpassed 90% [100% (19/19) and 100% (11/11) respectively]. Therefore, for these
two isolates, the following limitation is included in the labeling:
Results obtained P. rettgeri and S. liquefaciens and ceftolozane/tazobactam have
shown discrepant MICs when compared with the reference method when read by
the WalkAway instrument and inoculated using the Prompt. Therefore, prior to
reporting, these isolate results should be interpreted manually.
In addition, isolates of M. morganii demonstrated high major error (MAJ) rates when
inoculated with the Prompt and read by the WalkAway [15.9% (7/44)]. When these
isolates were retested using the turbidity method, they were able to meet 90% EA
with the WalkAway [95.5% (42/44)] and demonstrated no MAJ errors (0%).
Therefore, the following limitation is included in the labeling:
Ceftolozane/tazobactam results obtained with M. morganii isolates using the
Prompt Inoculation system have shown potential major errors. Therefore, prior to
reporting, isolates with resistant results should be retested using the turbidity
inoculation method.
The MAJ error rate for Enterobacteriaceae with the WalkAway and Prompt is 3.6%;
however, when M. morganii isolates were retested using the turbidity method, the
MAJ error rate decreased to 2.3% which is acceptable. In addition, the VMJ error rate
decreased from 3.6% to 1.8% when P. rettgeri isolates were read manually and
therefore, acceptable.
As seen in Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6, the percent CA overall for combined clinical and
challenge isolates was above 90%, and is therefore acceptable as described in the
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST)
Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA, August 2009. However, when interpreted by
the WalkAway and inoculated with the Prompt, M. morganii, P. rettgeri, and S.
liquefaciens isolates demonstrated lower than adequate CA performance when
analyzed separately [i.e., 81.8% (36/44), 84.2% (16/19), and 45.5% (5/11)
respectively] and yielded high major error rates as mentioned above. The CA rates
significantly improved when M. morganii isolates were repeated with the turibidity
inoculation (100%), and when P. rettgeri (100%) and S. liquefaciens (100%) isolates
were interpreted manually.

MIC Trends:
Table 7. Summary of Evaluation of MIC Trends
(combined clinical and challenge data)
Ceftolozane/ tazobactam Total ≥1 dil lower Exact ≥1 dil higher
WalkAway/Prompt
Enterobacteriaceaea 576 100 (17.36%) 299 (51.96%) 177 (30.73%)
P. aeruginosa 98 14 (14.29%) 75 (76.53%) 9 (9.18%)
aDifference between the higher and lower dilutions is 13.37%; 95% C.I. (8.46% to 18.20%)
As illustrated in Table 7, there was a difference in in results trending above the
reference for Enterobacteriaceae using the WalkAway read method and Prompt
inoculation method. The data demonstrates a trend for one doubling dilution higher
for these results compared to the reference method and therefore, the following is
included as a footnote in the labeling:
Ceftolozane/tazobactam MIC values for Enterobacteriaceae isolates tended to be
one doubling dilution higher when read by the WalkAway and using the Prompt
inoculation method.
