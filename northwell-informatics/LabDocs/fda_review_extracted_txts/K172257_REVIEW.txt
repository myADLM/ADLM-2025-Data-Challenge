2. Indication(s) for use:
TrueDX hCG Early Result Pregnancy Test
TrueDX hCG Early Result Pregnancy Test (Midstream and Cassette Format) is a rapid
chromatographic immunoassay for qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin
(hCG) in urine, as an aid in early detection of pregnancy, in some cases as early as five
(5) days before the expected period, i.e., as early as six (6) days before the day of the
missed period.
Important note regarding negative result:
Some pregnant women will not be able to detect hCG in their urine 5 days before the
expected period. If you test negative before your missed period, but think you may still
be pregnant, you should test against a few a few days after you missed period.
Important note regarding positive results:
Because this test detects low levels of hCG, it is possible that this test may give positive
results even if you are not pregnant. If you test positive, but think you may not be
pregnant, you should check with your doctor.
All results should be confirmed by your healthcare provider, especially when making
decision about future medical care.

membrane as test line, and goat anti-mouse IgG immobilized on the membrane as control
line. After the urine specimen is applied to the device, the hCG present in the specimen will
react with the mouse anti-hCG monoclonal antibody-colloidal gold conjugate. The complex
migrates along the membrane towards the test and control zones. Two lines in the test
window 3 minutes after the urine application indicate that hCG has been detected (pregnant);
one line (control line) indicates that no hCG has been detected (not pregnant).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The VeriClear Early Result Pregnancy Test and TrueDX hCG Early Result Pregnancy Test
are identical; therefore, only one set of representative performance data is presented below.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed using samples with hCG concentrations of 3.0 5.0,
8.5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mIU/ml, traceable to the WHO 4th International Standard.
Each sample was tested in 10 replicates each day over 5 days, using 3 lots of devices
(for both formats) by 5 operators. A total of 250 replicates (10 replicates/run x 5
operators x 5 days) per lot of device for each sample were obtained. The positive
results observed over total number of tests are summarized in the following tables:

High dose hook effect study:
Negative urine samples were spiked with hCG at concentrations up to 450,000
mIU/ml, and then tested in 2 replicates per lot using two lots of devices for each
format. The results demonstrated that no hook effect was observed at hCG
concentrations up to 450,000 mIU/ml.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The test is calibrated against the WHO 4th International Standards for hCG.

The stability testing protocol and acceptance criteria used to support the shelf life
were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims a 24-month shelf life
for both formats when stored in the sealed foil pouch at 39-86ºF (4-30ºC).
d. Detection limit:
An analytical sensitivity study was performed using negative human urine sample
spiked with hCG traceable to the WHO 4th International Standards for hCG to obtain
concentration of 0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.5, 8.5, 9.0, 10, 12.5, 15, and 25 mIU/ml hCG. The
samples were measured in 15 replicates, using 3 different lots of each test format. The
tests were performed by 3 different operators for 3 consecutive days. A different set
of operators tested each format of the device. The positive results observed over the
total number of tests are summarized in the following tables.

Effect of urine pH and Specific Gravity:
Negative and positive (10 mIU/ml hCG) urine samples were adjusted to have pH
values of 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0, and then tested in 2 replicates per lot using
two lots of devices for each format. The positive and negative hCG results were not
affected by urine pH levels between the ranges of 4.0 and 9.0.
Negative and positive (10 mIU/ml hCG) urine samples were adjusted to have specific
gravities of 1.000, 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025, 1.030 and 1.035, and then tested
in 2 replicates per lot using two lots of devices for each format. The positive and
negative hCG results were not affected by urine specific gravity concentrations
between 1.000 and 1.035.
Effect of hCG β-core fragment:
Negative urine samples (0 and 5 mIU/ml hCG) and positive urine samples (10, 25 and
20,000 mIU/ml hCG) were spiked with hCG β-core fragment at concentrations of
50,400, 102,000, 204,000 and 408,000 pmol/L, and then tested in 5 replicates per lot
using two lots of devices for each format. All samples yielded correct results with
hCG β-core fragment concentrations up to 408,000 pmol/L.
f. Assay cut-off:
See detection limit section M.1.d.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Urine samples were collected from 166 women at physician offices for pregnancy
testing. Of the 166 women, 65 of them were suspected to be pregnant. Patient
samples were randomly collected at various times throughout the day. Ages of these
women ranged from 19 to 41 years. Samples were masked and randomized prior to
testing by two health care professionals. Two lots of each device format (Midstream
and Cassette) were tested with every sample. For the midstream format, one lot of test
device was tested in the simulated mid-stream method, while the other lots were
tested in dip method. The results are summarized in table below:

Detection of hCG in Early Pregnancy Clinical Samples
A total of 616 urine samples were collected from 56 different women (25 - 45 years
old) who planned to become pregnant. These women were followed throughout their
conception cycles with urine collected from day -9 to day +1 of their expected period.
The Candidate device (both formats) detected hCG in 71% of samples from, five days
before the expected menstrual period, and 100% of samples from one day before the
expected menstrual period. The early pregnancy detection results are summarized
below:
Day in cycle Midstream Format Cassette Format Overall Pregnancy

-9 days 0% 0% 0%
-8 days 0% 0% 0%

Lay user study
A lay user study was performed at an intended use site with a total of 218 females
with diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ages, 18 years and older.
110 lay users tested with midstream format devices and 108 lay users tested with
cassette format devices. Lay users were only provided with the package insert prior to
performing the study. Lay user results compared to professional user results are listed
below.
Pregnancy Result Lay user vs. professional

Total 110/110 (100%) 110/110 (100%) 108/108 (100%)
Besides testing their own urine samples, lay users also tested 4 spiked urine samples
around the cut-off level, at concentrations of 3.0, 7.0, 8.5 and 10 mIU/ml hCG. A
total of 110 samples at each level were tested with the candidate device in both
Cassette and Midstream formats. Among the 110 midstream format devices tested at
each hCG level, 53 were tested in simulated midstream method while 57 were tested
in dip method. An aliquot of each of the urine samples was also tested by a laboratory
professional using the candidate device. The results are summarized below.

A Flesch-Kincaid reading analysis was performed on each OTC package insert and
the score demonstrated a reading Grade Level of 7. The results of the questionnaire
reflected that the consumers found the test easy to use and that they did not have
trouble understanding the labeling or interpreting results.

Specificity study to determine false-positive result rate
A study was performed to determine the incidence of positive test results using the
candidate device among non-pregnant women in three age groups: 18 - 41 years of
age (Pre-menopausal), 42-55 years of age (peri-menopausal) and >55 year of age
(post- menopausal). A total of 320 subjects provided urine samples: 100 from pre-
menopausal subjects, 111 from peri-menopausal subjects, and 109 from post-
menopausal subjects. Three lots of each test format of the candidate devices were
used for this study. No positive results were observed in any of the age groups.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Not applicable.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
