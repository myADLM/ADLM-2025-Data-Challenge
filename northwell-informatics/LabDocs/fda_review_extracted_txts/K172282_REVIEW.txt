H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Panther Fusion Paraflu assay is a multiplex real-time PCR (RT-PCR) in vitro
diagnostic test for the rapid and qualitative detection and differentiation of
parainfluenza 1 virus, parainfluenza 2 virus, parainfluenza 3 virus and parainfluenza 4
virus (HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, and HPIV- 4). Nucleic acids are isolated and purified
from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens obtained from individuals exhibiting signs
and symptoms of a respiratory tract infection.
This assay is intended to aid in the differential diagnosis of HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-
3, and HPIV-4 infections in humans. Negative results do not preclude HPIV-1,
HPIV-2, HPIV-3, and HPIV-4 infections and should not be used as the sole basis for
treatment or other management decisions. This assay is designed for use on the
Panther Fusion system.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Prescription Use Only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Panther Fusion System
I. Device Description:
The Panther Fusion Paraflu Assay is a multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)
in vitro diagnostic test developed for use on the fully automated Panther Fusion system to detect
and differentiate parainfluenza 1 virus, parainfluenza 2 virus, parainfluenza 3 virus, and
parainfluenza 4 virus directly from the nasopharyngeal swab specimens.
The Panther Fusion Paraflu Assay involves the following steps:
a) Sample lysis; prior to processing and testing on the Panther Fusion system, specimens are
transferred to a tube containing specimen transport media (STM) that lyses the cells, releases
target nucleic acid, and protects them from degradation during storage.
b) Nucleic acid capture and elution takes place in a single tube on the Panther Fusion system.
The eluate is transferred to the Panther Fusion system reaction tube containing the assay
reagents. The Internal Control-S (IC-S) is added to each test specimen and controls via the
working Panther Fusion Capture Reagent-S (wFCR-S). The IC-S in the reagent is used to
monitor specimen processing, amplification, and detection. Magnetic particles with covalently
bound oligonucleotides mediate the nucleic acid capture. Capture oligonucleotides hybridize to
total nucleic acid in the test specimen. Hybridized nucleic acid is then separated from the lysed
specimen in a magnetic field. Wash and aspiration steps remove extraneous components debris
from the reaction tube. The elution step elutes purified nucleic acid.

--- Page 3 ---
c) Elution transfer and multiplex RT-PCR; Eluted nucleic acid is transferred to a Panther Fusion
reaction tube already containing oil and reconstituted master mix. A reverse transcriptase
generates a DNA copy of the target sequence. Target specific forward and reverse primers and
probes then amplify targets while simultaneously detecting and discriminating multiple target
types via multiplex RT-PCR. The Panther Fusion system compares the fluorescence signal to a
predetermined cut-off to produce a qualitative result for the presence or absence of the analyte.
The positive result for each analyte will be accompanied by the cycle threshold (Ct) value.

L. Test Principle:
The assay detects viral nucleic acids that have been extracted from a patient respiratory
sample. A multiplex Real-time RT-PCR reaction is carried out under optimized conditions
generating amplicons for HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, and HPIV-4. The Internal Control-S
(IC-S) is added to each test specimen before processing to act as a control for specimen
processing, amplification, and detection. Identification of HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, and
HPIV-4, and the IC-S occurs by the use of target-specific primers and fluorescent-labeled
probes that hybridize to conserved regions in the viral genomes.

The mean and variability analysis between instruments, between reagent lots,
between operators, between days, between runs, within runs, and overall (total) for Ct
values is shown in the table above. Overall %CV was < 5.7%. The greatest source of
variability was from the HPIV-3 1X LoD panel member (within-run % CV of 5.4%).
Overall variability was low and the study demonstrates assay variability within an
acceptable range.
Reproducibility
The reproducibility study was conducted at 3 sites, with two operators at each site. Each
operator performed one run per day using one reagent lot. Testing was performed over
five non-consecutive days at each site using one Panther Fusion instrument. Each
operator tested three replicates of each panel member in every run. The table below
shows the sample panel that was used for the reproducibility study.

Agreement was 100% for HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, and HPIV-4 moderate positive
panel members and for the negative panel member tested with the Panther Fusion
Paraflu Assay.
For low positive panel members tested with the Panther Fusion Paraflu Assay, the
agreement was 100% for HPIV-1 and HPIV-2, 98.9% for HPIV-3 detection, and 96.6%
for HPIV-4 detection. The lower agreement observed using low positive panel members
is to be expected, since these panel members were spiked with a concentration close to
the limit of detection (yielding an approximately 95% to 100% detection rate).

c. Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods), Stability:
Controls:
The assay contains an internal control (IC-S) which is added to each test specimen. The
IC-S is first added to the Panther Fusion Capture Reagent-S (FCR-S) to make the
working Panther Fusion Capture Reagent-S (wFCR-S). The control material wFCR-S is
added to the specimen after lysis. This control monitors specimen processing,
amplification, and detection. It does not monitor lysis of the sample.
Two external controls are also included with this assay in a single use vial, the Panther
Fusion Paraflu Positive Control and the Panther Fusion Negative Control. The control
validity was studied during the Reproducibility Study where a positive and negative
control was tested during every run (30 runs total). All controls produced the expected
result.
Stability:
Stability studies have been performed to support the following claims:
Sample Stability:
The study data supports specimen stability at the following storage temperatures and
storage times:
· Stored neat at 2-8°C for at least 96 hours
· Stored diluted (transferred to Specimen Lysis Tube (SLT)) at 30°C for at least
144 hours (6 days)
· Stored diluted (transferred to SLT) at 2-8°C for at least 3 months.
· 3 Freeze/Thaw cycles (-70°C to Room Temperature = 1 Freeze/Thaw cycle)
Kit Stability:
Stability of the whole kit and all of the included reagents was evaluated. The reagents
included in the kit are: Panther Fusion Paraflu Assay Cartridge, Panther Fusion Capture
Reagent-S, Panther Fusion Enhancer Reagent-S, Panther Fusion Internal Control-S,
Panther Fusion Elution Buffer, Panther Fusion Oil, Panther Fusion Reconstitution Buffer
I, Panther Fusion Paraflu Assay Positive Control, and Panther Fusion Negative Control.
Two types of stability studies were performed: Shelf-Life Stability and In-Use (or on-
board) Stability. The study data supports the following storage conditions.

Shipping Stability:
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the exposure to extreme hot or cold
temperatures potentially encountered by the Panther Fusion Paraflu Assay components
during shipment would not impact the performance of the assay. One lot of
components and controls for the Panther Fusion Paraflu Assay were tested in this
study. All components were exposed to the extreme temperatures in their final
container closure systems and all of the components of the Panther Fusion Paraflu
Assay were exposed to the extreme conditions.
The Panther Fusion Paraflu Assay components and controls were cycled between the
extreme low temperatures (-40 ±5°C), room temperature (28 ±2°C), and extreme high
temperature (55±5°C). One stress cycle consisted of incubation for at least 9 hours at
extreme high temperatures, then at least 15 hours at room-temperature, followed by at
least 9 hours at extreme low temperature, followed by at least 15 hour incubation at
room temperature (1 cycle = approx. 48 hours). A total of 5 cycles were performed to
evaluate the worst case scenario of shipment to customers.
All runs tested gave the expected result for spiked and un-spiked samples. The Panther
Fusion Paraflu Assay and its components are not altered by exposure to extreme hot or
cold temperatures that may be encountered during shipping.
Carryover:
This study was conducted to determine the carry-over (cross-contamination) rate of the
Panther Fusion Paraflu Assay when high titer Human Parainfluenza Virus type 2,
positive samples are tested interspersed throughout the runs of negative samples on the
Panther Fusion system.
One run was comprised of 100 negative samples (baseline run), followed by three runs
comprised of 50 positive samples and 50 negative samples in a checkerboard pattern
(positive and negative samples loaded in alternate order).
Negative samples were comprised of simulated clinical matrix in VTM. Positive
samples consisted of simulated clinical matrix in VTM spiked with HPIV-2 at 106
TCID50/mL (> 10,000X LoD). Testing was completed on three Panther Fusion systems
using one lot of reagents.

Baseline runs comprised of negative samples showed 0% positivity for all targets, for
all three instruments. All positive samples from the checkerboard runs (runs 2-4) were
HPIV-2 positive. No negative samples from the checkerboard runs were HPIV-2
positive. No carryover was detected in this study.
d. Detection limit:
The purpose of this study was to evaluate and verify the analytical sensitivity and Limit
of Detection (LoD) of HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, and HPIV-4 viruses in pooled
negative clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimens when tested with the Panther Fusion
Paraflu Assay. Target-specific LoD values were obtained using one strain for each
targeted virus. Dilutions of each virus were prepared in pooled negative clinical
nasopharyngeal swab (NP) specimens and tested with 12 replicates per concentration,
using three reagent lots. Testing was performed on three Panther Fusion systems per
concentration and per reagent lot for a total of at least 36 replicates per virus type.
Determined LoD value for each virus type was verified by testing newly prepared
samples for at least 20 replicates using one lot of reagents. The LoD value for each virus
is listed in the table below.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering Substances
This study evaluated the performance of the Panther Fusion Paraflu Assay in the
presence of medications, over the counter products, and other potentially interfering
substances. Assay results were evaluated to determine if the presence of potentially
interfering substances in analyte-negative or analyte-positive samples had an effect on
assay performance. Panels made of Simulated Clinical Matrix with potentially
interfering substances were divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was tested un-spiked
and the other aliquot was tested with intended targets (HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3 and
HPIV-4) spiked at 1-2X LoD. Panels were tested with 3 reagent lots. The substances
tested are listed below:

This study demonstrates that the substances tested do not interfere with the
performance of the Panther Fusion Paraflu Assay at the concentrations tested.
Competitive Interference:
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that samples tested with the Panther
Fusion Paraflu Assay that are co-infected with multiple types of targeted organisms do
not inhibit the detection of either one (competitive interference). Each targeted
organism (HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3 and HPIV-4) was tested. Co-infection Panels
were made by spiking one target organism at high concentration (1000X LoD) and
another target organism at low concentration (3X LoD) in simulated clinical matrix.
Additional panel members were made with one target at high concentration (1000X
LoD) and another target at low concentration
(5X – 10X LoD), if the competitive interference was observed. Testing was completed
on one Panther Fusion system using one lot of reagents. The test panel members are
shown below.

Interference was observed for HPIV-1 in Panel member 3 with HPIV-1 spiked at 3X LoD
(Low) and HPIV-4 spiked at 1000X LoD (high). Panel member 3 was 100% positive for
HPIV-4 (6/6) but 50.0% positive for HPIV-1 (3/6). A second lot of the Panel member 3
was made and tested for additional n=20 replicates. Two new panel members were made
and tested where HPIV-1 was spiked at a slightly higher concentration: Panel member 13
(HPIV-1 at 10X LoD and HPIV-4 at 1000X LoD) and Panel member 14 (HPIV-1 at 5X
LoD and HPIV-4 at 1000X LoD) both produced 100% positive for HPIV-1 and for
HPIV-4 (6/6), demonstrating that the competitive interference for the HPIV-1 by HPIV-4
is not observed when HPIV-1 is present at least at 5X LOD in the presence of HPIV-4 at
1000X LoD. All the other panel members were 100% positive for both targets. This is
acceptable as the four viruses are very similar and treatment is the same for all. here is
minimal risk associated with interference from different human parainfluenza viruses.

Cross-Reactivity:
This study evaluated the analytical specificity and sensitivity of the Panther Fusion
Paraflu Assay in the presence of non-targeted microorganisms that could be present in
the clinical specimen. Assay results were evaluated to determine if the presence of
spiked microbes in analyte negative or analyte positive specimens had an effect on
assay performance. Panels members were composed of 3-5 different microorganisms
spiked into simulated clinical matrix at either 101-107 TCID50/mL (for virus) or 105-108
CFU/mL or IFU/mL (for bacteria). Each panel member was split into two parts. One
part was spiked with one representative strain of intended targets (HPIV-1, HPIV-2,
HPIV-3, HPIV-4) to a final concentration of 0.5 log above LoD to assess interference
(negative effect on sensitivity). The other part was left un-spiked to assess specificity.
Panels were tested with 3 reagent lots. Panel descriptions are shown below.

Panel member 8 was composed of HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3 and HPIV-4, because
these are also the viruses being spiked into each panel member, panel member 8 was
not spiked with virus. Competitive interference was tested in a separate study (Table
17) and was therefore not repeated here.
No cross-reactivity was seen with organisms in any of the panels except panel member
14. When this panel was spiked with HPIV-2, one out of nine replicates (from reagent
Lot B testing) was positive for HPIV-2, which is not expected. Six additional
replicates, three from same samples and three from newly prepared samples, were
tested with the reagent lot B. All additional replicates tested were negative for HPIV-
2, for a final HPIV-2 positivity of 6.7% (1/15). The one HPIV-2 positive reaction is
likely caused by a rare cross-carryover event (carryover has been document with this
instrument previously), and not due to cross-reactivity. For all other panel members,
when tested spiked with intended organisms were 100.0% positive for intended targets,
and when tested un-spiked were 0.0% positive for all targets. The final results for all
conditions tested are detailed in the table below.

f. Assay cut-off:
The relative fluorescence units (RFU) range is the difference between maximum and
minimum fluorescent signal seen in a sample during amplification. For Panther Fusion
Paraflu positive samples, the amplification curve rises above the background florescence
RFU resulting in a high RFU range for the intended targets. The IC resembles a positive
target and also has a high RFU range. For the Panther Fusion Paraflu negative samples
the amplification curve remains flat resulting in a low RFU range for the intended targets.
This difference in RFU range is the primary criteria used to distinguish positive and
negative specimens. RFU range thresholds were set at 500 for HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3,
and 350 for HPIV-4 for determination of positivity in their specific channels (FAM,
HEX, ROX, RED647 respectively). RFU range threshold for IC was set at 500 for
determination of validity in its specific channel (RED677). The RFU range thresholds
were set based on data from multiple RFU readings from known positive samples. The
cycle number at which the amplification curve crosses target specific assigned RFU range
threshold value is called Ct. Target specific Ct will be generated only for positive valid
reaction for that target.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The results of the assay were compared to shell vial culture followed by Direct
Fluorescence Antibody Testing (DFA) for HPIV-1, HPIV-2, and HPIV-3 and PCR

followed by sequencing for HPIV-4. For additional details on the comparator please see
the “Clinical Studies” section below.
b. Matrix comparison:
The following five commonly used Viral Transport Media (VTM) types were evaluated:
M4, M4RT, M5, M6, and BD UTM (identical to Copan Universal Transport Medium).
Five types of simulated clinical matrix (SCM) were prepared by spiking 2x104 cells/mL
of HeLa cells in to each of five VTM types listed above. Cultured HPIV-1, HPIV-2,
HPIV-3, and HPIV-4 were then spiked into each VTM type at concentrations 1 log
below LoD, 0.5 log above LoD, and 1 log above LoD to prepare the VTM panel. Panel
was tested once right after sample spiking (T=0) and again after being stored at 2-8°C
for at least 72 hours (T>72 hrs). Testing was completed on four Panther Fusion systems
using one lot of reagents.
One aberrant result was detected for HPIV-3 samples, where one sample was positive
for HPIV-1, HPIV-2, and HPIV-4 in addition to HIPIV-3. Additional vials of the same
panel were tested again and all 8 replicates showed detection only of HIPV-3. The
aberrant result appears to be an anomaly with an unknown cause.
The testing results support use of all 5 Viral Transport Media types evaluated.

dual reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) followed by bi-directional sequencing (HPIV-
4). The study was conducted from October 2016 to March 2017 and 3 lots of reagents
were used during the study. Fresh and frozen samples were tested during this clinical
study.
Specimens included in this study were leftover, remnant nasopharyngeal swabs collected
from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The specimen inclusion
criteria were:
· A minimum volume of 1.75mL
· Stored at 2C to 8C for less than 72 hours after collection
· Specimen was collected in appropriate VTM (M4, M4RT, M5, M6, Copan
Universal Transport Medium or BD Universal Transport Medium)
Specimens were excluded if they were deemed unsuitable for reference culture or Panther
Fusion testing. Examples of unsuitable samples are: specimen leakage, unacceptable
VTM, storage time or temperature exceeded, etc.
This study collected 2961 clinical specimens, 6 were withdrawn after it was determined
that they did not meet the specimen inclusion criteria and further 25 were withdrawn by
patient request. A total of 67 specimens had invalid results; 53 invalid results on the
Panther Fusion Paraflu Assay and 14 invalid results from the reference testing. The
overall invalid rate for the Panther Fusion Paraflu Assay was 1.8% (53/2930).
The tables below show the performance of the Panther Fusion Paraflu Assay, the data are
stratified by analyte: HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, and HPIV-4. All data below represent
performance for prospectively collected specimens. The data includes 1112 freshly
collected and tested specimens and 1757 samples prospectively collected and stored
frozen until testing.
