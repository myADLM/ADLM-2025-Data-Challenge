Sysmex® Automated Blood Coagulation Analyzer CS-2500
I. Device Description:
Sysmex CS-2500
The Sysmex® Automated Blood Coagulation Analyzer CS-2500 (hereafter Sysmex CS-2500)
is an automated blood coagulation instrument which analyzes samples collected in 3.2%
sodium citrate using clotting, chromogenic and immunoassay methods. Results are displayed
on the Information Processing Unit (IPU) screen and can be printed on external printers or
transmitted to a host computer. The instrument is capable of analyzing samples in a normal
mode and micro-sample mode.
Factor V Leiden with Factor V Leiden Assay
The Factor V Leiden Assay is based on the activation of endogenous Protein C by incubation
of plasma with Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix (Southern Copperhead) venom. The kit
contains the venom activator in stabilizing-buffer solution and the PR3V Reagent: dilute
phospholipid rich Vipera Russelli venom, calcium and heparin inhibitor. Both reagents
contain sodium azide as a preservative.
Coagulation Factor VIII and IX Deficient Plasmas
Coagulation Factor Deficient Plasmas are lyophilized human plasmas with a residual Factor
VIII, IX, XI or XII activity of ≤ 1 %. The deficient plasmas are manufactured by
immunoadsorption from normal plasma and are free from antigen of the respective factor.
Fibrinogen is present in a quantity of at least 1 g/L, and the remaining coagulation factors are
present in an activity greater than 40% of the norm. The plasmas contain mannitol (20 g/L)
as a stabilizer.
LA 1 Screening and LA 2 Confirmation Reagents
LA 1 Screening Reagent and LA 2 Confirmation Reagent both contain Russell’s viper
venom, phospholipids, antiheparin agents, calcium, buffers, stabilizers, sodium azide and
dyes.

L. Test Principle:
Factor V Leiden Assay
The Factor V Leiden Assay is based on the activation of endogenous Protein C. A point
mutation in the Factor V gene (Factor V (Leiden) slows the inactivation of factor Va by
activated Protein C (APC) causing a hypercoagulable state. The presence of a mutation is
detected by measuring APC resistance in plasma upon activation of a clotting cascade with
Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix (Southern Copperhead) venom. A dilute Russell’s Viper
Venom Time (DRVVT) is then performed on the plasma. The DRVVT is sensitive to
prolongation in the presence of APC. Results are reported as a ratio of clotting times obtained
with and without protein C activation which indicates presence or absence of APC resistance.
Generally, ratios less than or equal to the claimed cut-off value of 1.8 suggest the Leiden
variant of Factor V.
Coagulation Factor VIII and Coagulation IX Deficient Plasmas
A plasma deficient in coagulation Factor VIII or Factor IX results in a prolonged partial
thromboplastin time (APTT). Results are reported as percent of norm.
Lupus Anticoagulant with LA 1 Screening and LA 2 Confirmation Reagents:
LA 1 Screening Reagent and LA 2 Confirmation Reagent are Simplified Dilute Russell’s
Viper Venom Tests (DRVVT) for detection of Lupus Anticoagulants. The Russell’s viper
venom present in LA 1 Screening Reagent initiate plasma clotting by directly activating
factor X. LA antibodies prolong the LA 1 Screening Reagent clotting time. LA 2
Confirmation Reagent is similar to LA 1 Screening Reagent but contains a high phospholipid
concentration. The extra phospholipid counteracts the LA antibody and largely corrects the
clot time. Results are reported as a ratio.

Reproducibility:
The reproducibility study was performed in the Normal Mode of the Sysmex CS-
2500 analyzer at three external sites. At one site, additional testing was performed in
the Micro Mode. For each test application, the reproducibility study was carried out
using one Sysmex CS-2500 analyzer following the 20 x 2 x 2 study design (20 days
with 2 runs/day and 2 replicates/run). The same reagent lot, control lot, calibrator lot and
plasma pools were used at each site. For each application, plasma pools and quality
control materials were used to cover each assay measuring interval. The site specific
data were analyzed separately and combined to achieve standard deviation and
percent CV for within-run, between-run, between-day, between-site, and total
imprecision components for each panel member and control. Data analysis was
performed using ANOVA and the truncated analysis method.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated for two calibrated coagulation assay applications:
Coagulation Factor VIII with Dade Actin FSL and Coagulation Factor IX with
Dade Actin FSL. The study was performed using one Sysmex CS-2500 analyzer
and one lot of reagent (Coagulation Factor VIII/Factor IX). Testing was performed
with a high concentration sample pool (high pool) serially diluted to various
concentrations using a diluent pool (low pool). Low pools were prepared by dilution
with respective factor deficient plasma; high pools were prepared by adding
respective factor concentrate. Thirteen different dilutions were prepared; each
analyte concentration was measured in replicates of four. For each sample,
deviation between the linear regression model (predicted value from 1st order
regression) and the best fitting polynomial regression model was calculated.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Commercial Standard Human Plasma (SHP) is used for the calibration of the
following applications: Coagulation Factor VIII with Dade Actin FSL Reagent and
Coagulation Factor IX with Dade Actin FSL Reagent.
Control Plasma N (CPN), and Control Plasma P (CPP) are assayed controls used to
monitor assay performance on the Sysmex CS-2500. SHP, CPN, and CPP are
traceable to the following WHO Standard reference materials: 6th WHO Standard
07/316 and 4th WHO Standard 09/172.
On-Board Stability Testing for Calibrators and Controls
Real-time on-board stability testing for Control Plasma N, Control Plasma P, Pro C
Control Plasma, LA Control Low and LA Control High was conducted internally.
The on-board stability of the calibrators (Standard Human Plasma) were not
determined since calibrators are intended to be used immediately. Three lots of each
of the controls were tested over multiple time points distributed over the expected
stability claim. Stability was assessed in terms of measurand drift for each control
level and lot and found to be acceptable to support the following on-board stability:
25 hours for control Plasma N and Pro C Control Plasma for Factor V Leiden with
Factor V Leiden Assay; 11 and 7 hours for Control N and P, respectively for
Coagulation Factor VIII with Dade Actin FSL; 25 hours for Control N and P for
Coagulation Factor IX with Dade Actin FSL; 25 hours for Control Plasma N and
24 hours for LA Control Low and High with Lupus Anticoagulant with LA 1
Screening, LA 2 Confirmation Reagents and LA 1/LA 2 Ratio.
On-Board Stability Testing – Reagents
Real-time on-board stability testing for Factor V Leiden with Factor V Leiden Assay,
Coagulation Factor VIII with Dade Actin FSL, Coagulation Factor IX with Dade
Actin FSL, and Lupus Anticoagulant with LA 1 Screening and LA 2 Confirmation
Reagents was conducted internally using pooled plasma and control materials as test
samples. The test samples were selected to cover the clinically reportable range and
medical decision points for each assay. For each reagent, multiple testing time points
were pre-defined and distributed over the expected on-board stability claims. For each
application, one lot of reagent was tested and 4–6 replicates were measured at each
time point. Stability was assessed in terms of measurand drift for each test sample and
found to be acceptable to support the following claims.

Limit of Quantitation
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was established for the following calibrated assays:
Coagulation Factor VIII with Dade Actin FSL Reagent and Coagulation Factor IX
with Dade Actin FSL Reagent. The LoQ studies were performed internally using
plasma pools prepared by dilution of normal plasma with the respective application-
specific deficient plasma. Each study was conducted over three testing days with four
replicates per run. Testing was performed using one Sysmex CS-2500 analyzer, two
reagent lots (factor VIII/factor IX), one calibrator lot, and five independent low
analyte samples. Each application met the pre-defined acceptance criteria to support
the lower limit of the clinically reportable range (CRR).

Interference Study
Interference with hemoglobin, conjugated bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin, and
triglycerides was tested for each assay. The study was performed with one reagent lot,
one calibrator lot, and one trained operator. A dose-response experiment was carried
out to determine the degree of interference as a function of the interferent
concentration. For each of the 3rd wave applications at least two plasma pools, normal
and abnormal, were prepared, representing the low pools of interference testing. The
summarized data is provided in table form below. No interference was observed up to
the following interferent concentrations as per the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was conducted at four clinical sites including three external
sites in the United States. Subjects over 18 years of age were enrolled. At each site, a
minimum of 300 samples were included for a total of 2500 samples across all four sites.
Samples were tested on both the predicate device (Sysmex CA-1500) and the Sysmex
CS-2500 in random order. Remnant citrated plasma samples from routine laboratory
testing were selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The percentage of
frozen and contrived samples was limited to approximately 10% of the number of
total samples. Samples included in the method comparison study covered the clinical
reportable ranges and respective medical deicision points. Results of the study met
the defined acceptance criteria.

b. Matrix comparison:
For the purpose of including frozen samples in the method comparison studies, a
fresh/frozen comparison study was performed to demonstrate that the assays on the
Sysmex CS-2500 analyzer are not affected by freezing and thawing specimens. The
study results demonstrated comparability between frozen and fresh samples for the
following assays: Factor V Leiden with Factor V Leiden Assay, Coagulation Factor
IX with Dade Actin FSL, Lupus Anticoagulant with LA 1 Screening Reagent, LA 2
Confirmation Reagent and LA 1/LA 2 Ratio. Samples were not tested with the
Coagulation Factor VIII with Dade Actin FSL assay as no frozen samples were
included in the method comparison study. The study results demonstrated
comparability between fresh and frozen samples and met the defined acceptance
criteria for all applicatons.

FV Leiden Cut-off Validation Study: Blood samples from the intended use population
were collected at three external clinical sites including one U.S. site. The samples were
tested with the Factor V Leiden Assay on the Sysmex CS-2500 analyzer and using the
FDA cleared FV Leiden PCR method. The results of the FV Leiden assay on the Sysmex
CS-2500 analyzer were subsequently compared to the FV Leiden genotype to calculate
positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA). A ratio of ≤
1.8 obtained with the FV Leiden assay is considered as suggestive for the FV Leiden
variant (single point mutation G1691A). The Siemens FV Leiden Assay does not support

5. Expected Values/Reference Range:
The reference interval studies were conducted at three clinical sites in the U.S. at
different geographic locations to reflect the U.S. population. Citrated plasma samples
obtained from apparently healthy individuals between ages 18 and 80 years old with no
current or recent history of coagulation disease (e.g. thrombosis or bleeding), use of
anticoagulation medication, apparent infection or acute phase reaction, known pregnancy,
hospitalization within four weeks, or use of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement
therapy (exclusive to protein C testing). Separate reference intervals were established
using fresh and frozen samples for the LA 1/LA 2 Assay. Reference intervals for the
Factor V Leiden Assay and the Lupus Anticoagulant applications were calculated as two-
sided 95 % central interval with 2.5th/ 97.5th percentiles. For Coagulation Factors VIII
and IX, the reference intervals were calculated as one-sided 97.5 % interval (2.5th
percentile) and one-sided 95 % interval (5th percentile).

3. Specimen Identification:
Manual entry and barcode reader
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The Sysmex CS-2500 supports two different analysis modes; normal mode for capped
(closed) and uncapped (open) sampling from collection tubes, and the micro-sample
mode for open (uncapped) sampling. In the normal mode, capped and uncapped samples
may be loaded into the same sample rack for analysis. Automatic reanalysis is also an
exclusive function of the normal mode. In the micro-sample mode, uncapped samples
may be loaded in the sampler or STAT holder.
5. Calibration:
Calibration is performed using Standard Human Plasma (SHP) as an automated function
of the Sysmex CS-2500. SHP is obtained from pooled citrated plasma collected from
healthy blood donors, and is stabilized with HEPES buffer solution. A new standard
curve must be established when changing a reagent lot, post-major maintenance or
service, if indicated by quality control results, and when required according to laboratory
control procedures and government regulations.
6. Quality Control:
Quality control testing using Control Plasma N, Control Plasma P, ProC Control
Plasma, and LA Control Low and High should all be performed at least every 8 hours
during intervals of patient testing. Controls should be run after a new standard curve is
established and after each change of reagent. Patient test results should not be reported
if controls are out of range.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Dilution Study
The Sysmex CS-2500 analyzer offers additional dilution options for each application
carried out by an auto-dilution mode when measurement results are observed outside the
analytical measuring range (AMR): auto-dilution mode 1:4 for Factor VIII with Dade
Actin FSL, for the results above 120% of norm and the auto-dilution mode 1:2 for Factor
IX with Dade Actin FSL for the results above 120% of norm. The Sysmex CS-2500
analyzer also provides the 2:1 processing mode for results below the AMR.
In addition to automatic dilution settings, the Sysmex CS-2500 analyzer also provides an
21

--- Page 22 ---
on-demand ‘dilution analysis.’ The application is programmed with a list of pre-defined
dilutions that may be selected for such purposes. The following options are provided by
the Sysmex CS-2500 analyzer to the customer for ‘dilution analysis’: 1/2, 1/4, 1/8
dilution and processing modes 3/2, 2/1 on-demand. The dilutions that may be selected are
application-specific and are listed in the application sheets.
The auto-dilution study was carried out with one analyzer and one reagent lot (deficient
plasma) with three different plasma samples covering the range outside the calibration
curve between the end of the analytical measurement range (AMR) and the clinically
reportable range (CRR), for each of the applicable reagent applications. Three test
samples were analyzed for each dilution, in five replicates. The same samples, but
undiluted, were measured upon auto-dilution by the instrument. All observed maximum
deviations in the dilution analysis study were within the pre-defined acceptance criteria.
2. Normal Mode versus Micro Mode
The Sysmex CS-2500 has two analysis modes: normal and micro. In the normal-sample
mode, a capped sample tube analysis can be performed for all the analyses and re-
analyses. Automatic re-analysis can also be performed. In the micro-sample mode, the
sample volume from samples set in the sampler or STAT holder is taken into the
instrument through a secondary dispensing sample probe and analyzed. This analysis
mode can also be performed with less sample volume than normal mode. However, in the
micro-sample mode, capped sample tube analysis and automatic re-analysis cannot be
performed.
The comparison study between micro versus normal mode was conducted for each
application using samples (84-Factor V Leiden, 69-Factor VIII/IX, 82-LA 1, 83-LA 2,
and 76-LA 1/LA 2 ratio) covering clinical reportable ranges, measured with one reagent
lot on one Sysmex CS-2500 analyzer and the predicate instrument. The study results met
pre-defined acceptance criteria and demonstrated acceptable comparability between
micro versus normal mode.
3. Carryover Studies
Reagent Carryover
The reagent carryover study investigated whether a reagent or a test component of a
donor application may affect an acceptor application. A combination of donor and
acceptor applications was tested in a defined sequence. One normal plasma pool and one
pathological plasma pool were used as test samples. The reagent carryover studies data
showed no cross-contamination between applications.
Sample Carryover
A donor, was defined as a test sample with the highest possible analyte concentration that
might interfere in the subsequent assay. Whereas an acceptor, was defined as a low
analyte concentration test sample measured after the measurements of the donor assay. If
22

--- Page 23 ---
sample carryover occurs, the results of the acceptor assay demonstrates interference.
Samples were prepared by dilution or spiking of a normal plasma pool with the respective
application-specific deficient plasma or respective analyte concentrate. The donor and
acceptor assay measurements were performed in a defined sequence. The study data
demonstrated that there is no cross-contamination caused by high carryover test samples.
4. Ambient Temperature Testing
The study investigated the influence of environmental temperatures on test results. Each
study was carried out with one Sysmex CS-2500 analyzer, one reagent lot, and one
calibrator lot. Samples were selected to represent the respective clinical reportable range
(CRR) and medical decision points (MDPs). In addition to pooled plasma, ProC Global
Control, Control Plasma N and P were tested in a minimum of five replicates on three
different days, each day representing a different ambient temperature (15°C, 22°C, and
30°C). The mean values were calculated for each sample and the relative (percent) or
absolute differences were calculated for each application and found to be within the pre-
defined acceptance criteria. All observed maximum deviations in the ambient
temperature study were below the pre-defined acceptance criteria.
5. Bridging Study: CS-2100i to CS-2500 Instrument comparison within instrument family
The aim of the study was to show equivalent performance in a method comparison study
between the Sysmex CS-2500 analyzer (new device) and the Sysmex CS-2100
(K151259, K162688) with the representative applications. The study was performed
according to CLSI EP09-A3 “Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation
Using Patient Samples”; Approved Guideline-Third Edition. The same samples and
reagents lots were used. The comparison between instruments comprise of the evaluation
of analytical studies for the detection limit, linearity, precision and method comparison.

a. Method Comparison
The purpose of the study is to demonstrate equivalency between the instrument
family member, Sysmex CS-2500 analyzer and the parent instrument, Sysmex CS-
2100i analyzer (K151259), with each reagent application. Samples were measured on
both analyzers (Sysmex CS-2500 and Sysmex CS-2100i) in random order as to
eliminate any inherent bias. Measurements were performed according to the IFU for
each cleared application. Samples were analyzed on the Sysmex CS-2500 and the
Sysmex CS-2100i analyzer within 2 hours or less in single determination. If a
sufficient number of samples that adequately span the clinical reportable range (CRR)
was not available, diluted and/or spiked samples (contrived samples) were used, but
not more than 10% overall.

The study was performed on three Sysmex CS-2500 analyzers with one lot of reagent
over 20 days, with two runs per day and two replicates per run at one site. For each
application, several samples (plasma pools) as well as different control materials were
investigated as samples. The samples were chosen to represent the entire CRR and

medical decision points. Statistical analyses were conducted for each instrument
separately as well as on the data combined over the three instruments. For the
precision evaluation of the combined instruments, a three-factorial random effects
ANOVA was conducted with the factors instrument, day (nested within instrument)
and run (nested within day) for each sample concentration. The SDs and CVs were
calculated for the following variance components: within-run, between-run, between-
day, between-instrument and total (combined instruments).

c. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
The LoQ studies were performed internally. Plasma pools were prepared by dilution
of normal plasma with the respective application-specific deficient plasma. For each
reagent application the LoQ-verification was performed with five independent low-
analyte plasma pools.
Each study was conducted over three testing days, one run per day, with one Sysmex
CS-2500 analyzer, using two different reagent lots, one calibrator lot, five low analyte
samples, and four replicates per run. Each application met the pre-defined acceptance
criteria to support the lower limit of the CRR.

Testing was performed with a high concentration sample pools (high pool) mixed
with low concentration pools, to obtain samples covering the measuring range. Low
pools were prepared by dilution with factor deficient plasma, high pools were

prepared by adding factor concentrate. At least 11 different dilutions were prepared;
each analyte concentration was measured in replicates of four. The study was
performed on one Sysmex CS-2500 analyzer with one lot of reagent on one day, with
one run, four replicates per sample. For each sample, deviation between the linear
regression model (predicted value from 1st order regression) and the best fitting
polynomial regression model was calculated.

All observed maximum deviations in the linearity studies at the dilution points were
below the pre-defined acceptance criteria. In particular, the linearity at the medical
decision point for each application showed acceptable performance.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
