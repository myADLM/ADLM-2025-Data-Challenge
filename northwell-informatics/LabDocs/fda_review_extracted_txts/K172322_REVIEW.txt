L. Test Principle:
The Atellica IM Total (ThCG) assay is a 2-site sandwich immunoassay using direct
chemiluminescent technology that employs a goat polyclonal anti-hCG antibody labeled with
acridinium ester and a purified mouse monoclonal anti-hCG secondary antibody, which is
covalently bound to paramagnetic particles. These 2 antibodies are specific for different
epitopes that are present on both the free ß-subunit and the ß-subunit of intact hCG.
A direct relationship exists between the amount of hCG present in the patient sample and the
amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the system.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted using two lots of Atellica IM Total (ThCG) reagent
and two Atellica IM analyzers. Testing was performed two times a day with 2
replicates for 20 non-consecutive days for a total of 80 replicates. This study was
performed using 3 spiked human serum samples and 3 human serum based control
samples.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the data consistent with the
recommendations of CLSI EP5-A2. In addition, an estimate of the repeatability,
between-run, between-day, and within-laboratory precision using the restricted
maximum likelihood method (REML) method was conducted. Precision results from
all reagent lots and all systems (n=320) are shown below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity
Linearity was established by preparing eleven sample dilutions at concentrations from
5.6 -1138 mIU/mL by mixing different proporitions of a normal human pregnant
female hCG serum sample with a normal human serum sample without detectable
hCG. The samples were tested with the Atellica IM Total (ThCG) assay on one
analyzer in triplicate with two reagent lots. Results from the two reagent lots were
similar. The expected values were plotted against the recovered hCG values. Linear
regression gave the following equation:
y = 1.037x + 1.619, R2 = 0.9977
The data support an analytical measuring range of 2.6-1000 mIU/mL.
Dilution Studies
A dilution recovery study was performed using 9 unique human serum samples
(1200-14000 mIU/mL) to demonstrate the accuracy of dilution of samples above the
reportable range of the candidate device. Dilutions for each sample were made with
hCG negative serum pool (1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 dilutions) resulting in sample
concentrations of approximately 185 – 900 mIU/mL.
This study was run on one instrument using one reagent pack lot. Each sample
dilution was measured in triplicates. Percent recovery was calculated for each sample
as shown below:

The recoveries ranged from 87% to 108% with mean recoveries of 91%, 101%, 98%
and 100% for dilution factors 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16. The Instructions for Use
recommends diluting and retesting samples with hCG levels > 1000 mIU/mL to
obtain accurate results.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrators for the Atellica IM Total (ThCG) Assay are traceable to the World
Health Organization (W.H.O.) 4th Internation Standard (IS) for hCG (75/589) and
were cleared under k920372.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification
(LoQ) were evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2 Guideline using the Atellica
IM Total (ThCG) System.
Limit of blank:
The limit of blank was determined by testing five blank samples consisting of buffer
based diluents and delipidized human serums. The samples were tested with 2
reagent lots on one instrument, once per day, 20 replicates per sample for 3 days
yielding a total of 300 blank measurements per reagent lot. The limit of blank was
determined non-parametricically. The highest value of the two reagent lots was the
limit of blank. The limit of blank was determined to be 1.5 mIU/mL.

Limit of detection
Low-level hCG samples (1.7 mIU/mL and 2.9 mIU/mL) were prepared from five
human serum pools spiked with patient samples with hCG. These samples were tested
with 2 reagent lots on one instrument, once per day, 20 replicates per sample for 3
days yielding a total of 300 measurements per reagent lot. The LoD, 1.7 mIU/mL,
was determined parametrically using the highest LoD from the two reagent lots.
Limit of quantitation:
Five low-level hCG samples were prepared from β-hCG negative human serum
samples spiked with WHO β-hCG stock. These samples were tested with 2 reagent
lots on one instrument in 5 replicates per run, 2 runs per day over 5 days (N=50 per
sample per lot). The assay LoQ claimed by the sponsor from the worst lot is 2.6
mIU/mL based on a total error goal of bias and precision ≤ 30%.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-Reactivity:
To determine the cross-reactivity of related proteins in the Atellica IM Total (ThCG)
assay, four human serum samples with hCG levels of approximately 2.2, 5, 50, and
500 mIU/mL, were spiked with Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), Luteinizing
Hormone (LH), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Prolactin (PRL), and Human
Growth Hormone (hGH) and assayed using two reagent lots on one Atellica IM
analyzer. Results from these cross-reactant spiked samples were evaluated against
that of the serum without potential cross-reactants. No cross-reactivity (defined by the
sponsor as < ±10% bias between the test pool and control pool for samples) was
observed at the concentrations that were tested for PRL, hGH , TSH, LH, and FSH as
shown below.
Substance Concentration
TSH 1 mIU/mL
LH 500 mIU/mL
FSH 500 mIU/mL
PRL 1000 ng/mL
hGH 500 mg/mL
Interference Study:
Two human serum pools spiked with hCG to final concentrations of 5 mIU/mL and
500 mIU/mL were spiked with various endogenous substances and therapeutic drugs.
All samples were tested in triplicate with two reagent lots on one Atellica IM system.
Results from these spiked serum samples were compared to results of serum without
potential interferenents. There was no significant interference (defined by the sponsor
as < ±10% between the test pool and the control pool) up to the concentrations
summarized below.

Hook effect:
Samples with hCG concentrations up to 1.0 million mIU/mL were prepared by
spiking human hCG antigen to a pool of normal human serum, and were tested with
the candidate Atellica IM Total (ThCG) assay. No hook effect was observed at hCG
concentrations up to 1.0 million mIU/mL.
The sponsor includes the following statement in the labeling regarding hook effect:
“High ThCG concentrations can cause a paradoxical decrease in the RLUs (high-dose
hook effect). In this assay, patient samples with hCG concentrations as high as
1,000,000 mIU/mL (IU/L) will report > 1000.0 mIU/mL (IU/L). Results were
established using the Atellica IM Analyzer.”
Human Anti-Mouse Antibodies:
To determine the susceptibility of the Atellica IM Total (ThCG) assay to potential
human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) interference, three patient samples and two
control samples containing HAMA up to 1500 ng/mL were spiked with low and high
hCG (6.5 mIU/mL and 501 mIU/mL). No HAMA interference at a concentration up
to 1500 ng/mL was observed.
The sponsor includes the following statement in the Limitations section of the
labeling:
“Identified sources of interference that have the potential to bind to and interfere with
