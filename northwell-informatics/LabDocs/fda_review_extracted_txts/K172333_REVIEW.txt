I. Device Description:
Sysmex CS-5100
The Sysmex Automated Blood Coagulation Analyzer CS-5100 (hereafter Sysmex CS-5100)
is an automated blood coagulation instrument which analyzes venous plasma samples
collected in 3.2% sodium citrate using clotting, chromogenic and immunoassay methods.
Results are displayed on the Information Processing Unit (IPU) screen and can be printed on
external printers or transmitted to a host computer. The instrument is capable of analyzing
samples in a normal mode and a micro-sample mode.
Factor V Leiden with Factor V Leiden Assay
The Factor V Leiden Assay is based on the activation of endogenous Protein C by incubation
of plasma with Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix (Southern Copperhead) venom. The kit
contains the venom activator in stabilizing-buffer solution and the PR3V Reagent: dilute
phospholipid rich Vipera Russelli venom, calcium and heparin inhibitor. Both reagents
contain sodium azide as preservative.
Coagulation Factor VIII and IX Deficient Plasmas
Coagulation Factor Deficient Plasmas are lyophilized human plasmas with a residual Factor
VIII, IX, XI or XII activity of ≤ 1 %. The deficient plasmas are manufactured by
immunoadsorption from normal plasma and are free from antigen of the respective factor.
Fibrinogen is present in a quantity of at least 1 g/L, and the remaining coagulation factors are
present in an activity greater than 40 % of the norm. The plasmas contain mannitol (20 g/L)
as a stabilizer.
Lupus Anticoagulant with LA1 Screening and LA2 Confirmation Reagent
LA 1 Screening Reagent and LA 2 Confirmation Reagent contain Russell’s viper venom,
phospholipids, antiheparin agents, calcium, buffers, stabilizers, sodium azide and dyes.

L. Test Principle:
Factor V Leiden Assay
The Factor V Leiden Assay is based on the activation of endogenous Protein C. A point
mutation in the Factor V gene (Factor V (Leiden) slows the inactivation of factor Va by
activated Protein C (APC) causing a hypercoagulable state. The presence of a mutation is
detected by measuring APC resistance in plasma upon activation of a clotting cascade with
Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix (Southern Copperhead) venom. Results are reported as a
ratio of clotting times obtained with and without protein C activation which indicates
presence or absence of APC resistance. Generally, ratios less than or equal to the claimed
cut-off value of 1.8 suggest the Leiden variant of Factor V.
Coagulation Factor VIII and IX Deficient Plasmas
A plasma deficient in coagulation Factor VIII or Factor IX results in a prolonged partial

thromboplastin time (APTT). Results are reported as percent of norm.
Lupus Anticoagulant with LA1 Screening and LA2 Confirmation Reagent
LA 1 Screening Reagent and LA 2 Confirmation Reagent are Simplified Dilute Russell’s
Viper Venom Tests (DRVVT) for detection of Lupus Anticoagulants. The Russell’s viper
venom present in LA 1 Screening Reagent initiate plasma clotting by directly activating
factor X. LA antibodies prolong the LA 1 Screening Reagent clotting time. LA 2
Confirmation Reagent is similar to LA 1 Screening Reagent but contains a high phospholipid
concentration. The extra phospholipid counteracts the LA antibody and largely corrects the
clot time. Results are reported as a ratio.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision:
The precision study was performed to establish instrument-to-instrument precision for
the Sysmex® CS-5100 analyzer. Two instruments were tested for within-run,
between-run, between-day and total precision, using one lot of reagent for 5 days,
with two runs per day and four replicates of each sample per run. The total precision
(within-site combined instruments) values of each application met the pre-defined
acceptance criteria.

Reproducibility
The reproducibility study was performed in the Normal Mode of the Sysmex CS-
5100 analyzer at three external sites. At one site, additional testing was performed in
the Micro Mode. For each test application, the reproducibility study was carried out
using one Sysmex CS-5100 analyzer following the 20 x 2 x 2 study design (20 days
with 2 runs/day and 2 replicates/run). The same reagent lot, control lot, calibrator lot
and plasma pools were used at each site. For each application, plasma pools and
quality control materials were used to cover each assay measuring interval. The site
specific data were analyzed separately and combined to achieve standard deviation
and percent CV for within-run, between-run, between-day, between-site, and total
imprecision components for each panel member and control.

d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
The Factor V Leiden and Lupus Anticoagulant assays are non-calibrated clotting-
based assays for which there is no detection limit. Therefore, LoB and LoD are not
applicable.
Limit of Quantitation
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was established for the following calibrated assays:
Coagulation Factor VIII with Dade Actin FSL Reagent and Coagulation Factor IX
with Dade Actin FSL Reagent. The LoQ studies were performed internally using
plasma pools prepared by dilution of normal plasma with the respective application-
specific deficient plasma. Each study was conducted over three testing days with one
run per day and four replicates per run. Testing was performed using one Sysmex CS-
5100 analyzer, two different reagent lots, one calibrator lot, and five low analyte
samples. Each application met the pre-defined acceptance criteria to support the lower
limit of the clinically reportable range (CRR).

Interference study
Evaluation of interference from hemoglobin, conjugated bilirubin, unconjugated
bilirubin, and triglycerides was tested for each assay. The study was performed with
one reagent lot, one calibrator lot, one device and one trained operator. Dose-response
testing was carried out using multi-level interferent concentrations. For each assay at
least two plasma pools (normal and pathological analyte concentration) were prepared
to test hemoglobin and icterus interference. For the investigation of potential
interference of triglycerides, native samples were used. No significant interference
was observed up to the following interferent concentrations.

4. Clinical cut-off:
FV Leiden Cut-off Validation Study: Blood samples from the intended use population
were collected at three external clinical sites including one U.S. site. The samples were
tested with the Factor V Leiden Assay on the Sysmex CS-5100 analyzer and using the
FDA cleared FV Leiden PCR method. The results of the FV Leiden assay on the Sysmex
CS-5100 analyzer were subsequently compared to the FV Leiden genotype to calculate
positive percentage aggreement and negative percentage aggreement. A ratio of ≤ 1.8
obtained with the FV Leiden assay is considered as suggestive for the FV Leiden variant
(single point mutation G1691A). The Siemens FV Leiden Assay does not support a
distinction between hetero- or homocygote variant carriers. A ratio > 1.8 is considered as
negative for the FV Leiden variant.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The reference interval studies were conducted at three clinical sites in the U.S. at
different geographic locations to reflect the U.S. population. Citrated plasma samples
obtained from apparently healthy individuals between the age of 18 and 80 years with no
current or recent history of coagulation disease (e.g. thrombosis or bleeding), use of
anticoagulation medication, apparent infection or acute phase reaction, known pregnancy,
hospitalization within four weeks, or use of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement
therapy (exclusive to protein C testing). Results from all sites were pooled. Separate

reference intervals were established using fresh and frozen samples, for the LA1/LA2
Assay. Reference intervals for the Factor V Leiden Assay and the Lupus Anticoagulant
applications were calculated as two-sided 95% central interval with 2.5th/ 97.5th
percentiles. For the Coagulation Factors VIII and IX the reference intervals were
calculated as one-sided 97.5% interval (2.5th percentile) and one-sided 95% interval (5th
percentile).

this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Manual entry and barcode reader
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The Sysmex CS-5100 supports two different analysis modes; normal mode for capped
(closed) and uncapped (open) sampling from collection tubes, and the micro-sample
mode for open (uncapped) sampling. In the normal mode, capped and uncapped samples
may be loaded into the same sample rack for analysis. Automatic reanalysis is also an
exclusive function of the normal mode. In the micro-sample mode, uncapped samples
may be loaded in the sampler or STAT holder.
5. Calibration:
Calibration is performed using Standard Human Plasma (SHP) as an automated function
of the Sysmex CS-5100. A new standard curve must be established when changing a
reagent lot, post-major maintenance or service, if indicated by quality control results, and
when required according to laboratory control procedures and government regulations.
6. Quality Control:
Quality control testing using Control Plasma N, Control Plasma P and ProC Control
Plasma should be performed at least every 8 hours during intervals of patient testing.
Controls should be run after a new standard curve is established and after each change of
reagent. Patient test results should not be reported if controls are out of range.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Dilution Study
The Sysmex CS-5100 analyzer offers additional dilution options for each application
carried out by an auto-dilution mode when measurement results are observed outside the
analytical measuring range (AMR): auto-dilution mode 1:4 for Factor VIII with Dade
Actin FSL results above 120% of norm, and auto-dilution mode 1:2 for Factor IX with
Dade Actin FSL results above 120% of norm. The Sysmex CS-5100 analyzer also
provides the 2:1 processing mode for results below the AMR.

--- Page 23 ---
In addition to automatic dilution settings, the Sysmex CS-5100 analyzer provides an on-
demand ‘dilution analysis.’ The application is programmed with a list of pre-defined
dilutions that may be selected for such purposes. The following options are provided by
the Sysmex CS-5100 analyzer to the customer for ‘dilution analysis’: 1/2, 1/4, 1/8
dilution and processing modes 3/2, 2/1 on demand. The dilutions that may be selected are
application-specific and are listed in the application sheets.
The auto-dilution study was carried out with one analyzer and one reagent lot with three
different plasma samples covering the range outside the calibration curve between the
end of the analytical measurement range (AMR) and the clinically reportable range
(CRR), for each of the applicable reagent applications. Three test samples were analyzed
for each dilution, in five replicates. The same samples, but undiluted, were measured
upon auto-dilution by the instrument. All observed maximum deviations in the dilution
analysis study were below the pre-defined acceptance criteria.
2. Normal Mode versus Micro Mode
The Sysmex CS-5100 has two analysis modes: normal and micro. In the normal-sample
mode, samples for all the analyses including re-analyses are taken into the instrument at
the same time and analyzed using capped sample tube analysis. In the normal mode, a
capped sample tube analysis can be performed. Automatic re-analysis can also be
performed. In the micro-sample mode, the sample volume from samples set in the
sampler or STAT holder is taken into the instrument through a secondary dispensing
sample probe and analyzed. This analysis mode can also be performed with less sample
volume than normal mode. However, in the micro-sample mode, capped sample tube
analysis as well as automatic re-analysis cannot be performed.
The comparison study between micro versus normal mode was conducted for each
application using 60 samples covering the clinical reportable ranges. The study was
conducted with one reagent lot on one Sysmex CS-5100 analyzer and the predicate
instrument. The study results met the pre-defined acceptance criteria and demonstrated
acceptable comparability between micro versus normal mode.
3. Carryover Studies
Reagent Carryover
The reagent carryover study investigated whether a reagent or a test component of a
donor application may affect an acceptor application. A combination of donor and
acceptor applications was tested in a defined sequence. One normal plasma pool and one
pathological plasma pool were used as test samples. The reagent carryover studies data
showed no cross-contamination caused between one application into another.
Sample Carryover

--- Page 24 ---
A donor, was defined as a test sample with the highest possible analyte concentration that
might interfere in the subsequent assay. Whereas an acceptor, was defined as a low
analyte concentration test sample measured after the measurements of the donor assay. If
sample carryover occurs the results of the acceptor assay show interference. Samples
were prepared by dilution or spiking of a normal plasma pool with the respective
application-specific deficient plasma or respective analyte concentrate. The donor and
acceptor assay measurements were performed in a defined sequence. The data showed no
sample carryover.
4. Ambient Temperature Testing
The study investigated the influence of environmental temperatures on test results. Each
study was carried out with one Sysmex CS-5100 analyzer, one reagent lot, and one
calibrator lot. The samples were chosen to represent the respective entire clinical
reportable range (CRR) and the medical decision points (MDPs): in addition to pooled
plasma, ProC Global Control, Control Plasma N and P were tested in a minimum of five
replicates on three different days, each day representing a different ambient temperature
(15°C, 22°C, and 30°C). The mean values were calculated for each sample and the
relative (percent) or absolute differences were calculated for each application and found
to be within the pre-defined acceptance criteria. The data confirmed that the correctness
of the measured results is assured within the operating range temperatures of the Sysmex
CS-5100 analyzer (15°C–30°C).
