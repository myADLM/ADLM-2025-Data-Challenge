4. Panel:
83 - Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
For use with MicroScan Dried Gram Negative MIC/Combo Panels and Dried Gram Negative
Breakpoint Combo panels. MicroScan panels are designed for use in determining antimicrobial
agent susceptibility and/or identification to the species level of aerobic and facultatively
anaerobic gram-negative bacilli.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel is used to determine quantitative and/or
qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid media of rapidly growing
aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. After inoculation, panels are incubated
for 16 – 20 hours at 35°C ± 1°C in a non-CO incubator, and read either visually or with
2
MicroScan instrumentation, according to the package insert.
This particular submission is for the addition of the antimicrobial ceftazidime/avibactam at
concentrations of 0.25/4 to 64/4 µg/mL to the test panel.
The gram-negative organisms which may be used for ceftazidime/avibactam susceptibility testing
in this panel are:
Citrobacter freundii complex, Citrobacter koseri, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae,
Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus
mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii and Serratia
marcescens.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Prescription use only.
Limitations:
Results obtained with P. rettgeri and ceftazidime/avibactam with the Prompt Inoculation system
and WalkAway read were outside of essential agreement compared to the reference method;
results should be confirmed using manual read. In addition, isolates of P. rettgeri providing MIC
values ≥ 16 µg/mL with ceftazidime/avibactam should be retested using an alternate method to
avoid major errors.
Results obtained with S. marcescens when using the Prompt Inoculation system and WalkAway
read were outside of essential agreement compared to the reference method. Results obtained
2

--- Page 3 ---
with this species should be confirmed using manual read.
Due to the occurrence of very major errors with all inoculation and read methods, isolates of
Providencia stuartii that provide MICs of 4 and 8 µg/mL and isolates of P. aeruginosa that
provide MICs of 4 µg/mL should be retested using an alternative/method.
The ability of the MicroScan Dried Gram Negative Panels to detect resistance to ceftazidime
avibactam is unknown with C. freundii complex, C. koseri, M. morganii, and P. mirabilis because
resistant strains were not available at the time of comparative testing. If such isolates are
observed, they should be tested on an alternate method and/or submitted to a reference lab.
Elevated MICs with beta-lactam antimicrobials (e.g. ceftazidime/avibactam) may be observed if
panels are over-inoculated with microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia spp.,
Proteus spp., Morganella spp., and Providencia spp. Inoculum concentration is critical with
these antimicrobials as their mechanism of action involves disruption of bacterial cell wall
synthesis. The user should pay careful attention to inoculum preparation, especially with manual
methods that are technique dependent such as the Prompt system or inoculum prepared without
the aid of a photometric device.
Enzyme group characterization was performed at the time of comparative testing with the
exception of testing of OprD (outer membrane porin) for strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Ceftazidime/Avibactam is not active against Enterobacteriaceae bacteria that produce metallo-
beta lactamases and may not have activity against gram- negative bacteria that overexpress
efflux pumps or have porin mutations.
4. Special instrument requirements:
MicroScan panels can be read either manually or automatically on the WalkAway or autoSCAN-
4 instrument systems.
I. Device Description:
The MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo panel with ceftazidime/avibactam is used to
determine the quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of aerobic and
facultatively anaerobic gram negative bacilli colonies grown on solid media. After inoculation, panels
are incubated for 16-20 hours at 35°C ± 1°C in a non-CO incubator and read either visually or with
2
MicroScan instrumentation according to the package insert.

After inoculation and rehydration with a standardized suspension of organism and incubation at 35°C
for a minimum of 16 hours, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test organism is
determined by observing the lowest antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three external sites using 16 isolates of gram
negative bacilli that were consistent with the intended use. The range of
ceftazidime/avibactam dilutions tested was 0.03/4 to 64/4 µg/mL. Isolates were tested in
triplicate over three days for a total of 432 data points. The isolates tested in the
reproducibility study included C. freundii complex (one isolate), C. koseri (one isolate), E.
cloacae (one isolate), E. coli (five isolates), K. oxytoca (one isolate), K. pneumoniae (three
isolates), P. aeruginosa (three isolates) and S. marcescens (one isolate). Inocula were
prepared using both the turbidity and Prompt method and results were read manually and
with the WalkAway and autoSCAN-4 instrument systems. The majority of data points were
on-scale and within ± one doubling dilution agreement as compared to the mode MIC (Table
2). Two data points were off-scale using the Prompt inoculation method and autoSCAN-4
read method. As shown in Table 2, the data was analyzed taking into consideration best case
and worst case scenarios as described in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document:

prepared using the MicroScan Turbidity Meter with a reading of 0.08 ± 0.02 (equivalent to a
0.5 McFarland barium sulfate turbidity standard). The digital reading was recorded each day
of use.
Organism density data was also collected during the Reproducibility phase of the study for
suspensions prepared using the Prompt inoculum preparation method. Colony counts were
performed weekly using the quality control strain E. coli ATCC 25922. Colony counts were
also done once at each site for each reproducibility isolate.
All results were acceptable.
Purity Check. Purity check plates were evaluated; all AST results from a culture showing
mixed growth were deleted and the test was repeated.
Growth Failure Rate. During the course of the study there were no growth failures with the
MicroScan panel with ceftazidime/avibactam.
Organism integrity check. K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 was tested with ceftazidime alone
to check the integrity of the QC strain. All results were within the acceptable range.
Quality Control Testing. The CLSI and FDA recommended QC organisms (E. coli ATCC
25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, E. coli ATCC35218 and K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603)
were tested using all inoculation and read methods using the extended range of dilutions of
ceftazidime/avibactam (0.03/4 – 64/4 µg/mL). The reference panel was inoculated using the
turbidity method only. Results are shown in Table 3.

The sponsor initially tested the QC strains in an extended range of ceftazidime/avibactam
dilutions (0.03/4 – 64/4). The final dilution range included in the device was truncated to
include ceftazidime/avibactam dilutions from 0.25/4 to 64/4 µg/mL. With the revised dilution
range (0.25/4 – 64/4 µg/mL), the lower end of the expected QC range for E. coli ATCC
25922 and E. coli ATCC 35218 are off-scale. Because the lowest dilution in the QC range for
K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 is 0.25 µg/mL, some results obtained with this strain may also
be off scale. The QC range for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 are on-scale with the truncated
range; because P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 will give on-scale results, it is the recommended
QC strain for use with this panel. The following footnote to the QC table was included in the
device labeling:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The results obtained with the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel with
ceftazidime/avibactam were compared to results obtained using a frozen broth microdilution
reference panel at three testing sites in the U.S. The reference panel was prepared according
to CLSI M07-A10 guidelines except for the use of Pluronic-F in the inoculum water for the
reference panel. A validation study was performed to demonstrate equivalence between
reference panels inoculated with organisms suspended in water supplemented with Pluronic-F
and reference panels inoculated with autoclaved distilled water without Pluronic-F. The effect
of Pluronic F in the reference panel was determined with the following species: Citrobacter
freundii (one isolate), Enterobacter cloacae (two isolates), Escherichia coli (three isolates),
Klebsiella oxytoca (one isolate), Klebsiella pneumoniae (two isolates) and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (three isolates) and 11 replicates of each of four QC strains. The essential
agreement (EA) of MIC values obtained using Pluronic-F as the diluent as compared to MIC
values obtained using autoclaved distilled water as the diluent was 100%.
The initial studies included MicroScan and reference panels containing 12 dilutions of
ceftazidime/avibactam (0.03/4 – 64/4 µg/mL) that were appropriate for the interpretive
categories of the drug. The sponsor later modified the ceftazidime/avibactam dilution range to
include a nine-dilution range (0.25/4 – 64/4 µg/mL).
For each organism tested, MicroScan panels and reference panels were inoculated using the
same standardized suspension further diluted into 25 mL of water with either Pluronic-D (for
the MicroScan dried panels) or Pluronic-F (for the frozen reference panels). Panels were
inoculated using both the Prompt System and by the Turbidity method; MicroScan panels
were read using the WalkAway, the autoSCAN4 and Manual Read. The reference panels
were read manually. Performance was evaluated using FDA breakpoints for
ceftazidime/avibactam, and results were analyzed based on the guidelines provided in the
AST Class II Special Controls Guidance Document.

--- Page 9 ---
An internal study was performed to determine the agreement of results obtained with the
Prompt inoculation method using hold times of 0 hours and 4 hours prior to inoculation of the
panels. Results of 4-hour holds were compared to 0-hour hold using the same inoculum and
with expected results as determined by the reference method. Testing was performed with all
three read methods using 20 replicates with each of four QC strains and 12 replicates of C.
koseri. The study demonstrated that Prompt hold times up to four hours provided results
within EA of the reference method.
A total of 79 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates were evaluated; of these 59 (74.7%) were fresh
isolates and 20 (25.3%) were recent isolates. A total of 539 Enterobacteriaceae clinical
isolates were evaluated including C. freundii (12 isolates), C. freundii complex (17 isolates),
C. koseri (49 isolates), E. aerogenes (32 isolates), E. cloacae (48 isolates) E. coli (77
isolates), K. oxytoca (47 isolates), K. pneumoniae (88 isolates), M. morganii (41 isolates), P.
mirabilis (56 isolates), P. rettgeri (19 isolates), P. stuartii (21 isolates) and S. marcescens (32
isolates). Of the 539 clinical isolates, 373 (69.2%) were fresh isolates,149 (27.6%) were
recent isolates and 17 (3.2%) were stock isolates.
A total of 29 challenge isolates of P. aeruginosa and 87 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae were
evaluated. The Enterobacteriaceae isolates included C. freundii (2 isolates), C. freundii
complex (4 isolates), C. koseri (13 isolates), E. aerogenes (4 isolates), E. cloacae (10
isolates) E. coli (16 isolates), K. oxytoca (8 isolates), K. pneumoniae (14 isolates), M.
morganii (4 isolates), P. mirabilis (4 isolates), P. rettgeri (3 isolates), P. stuartii (1 isolate)
and S. marcescens (4 isolates).
For the Enterobacteriaceae and for P. aeruginosa, the overall essential agreement and
category agreement was acceptable at ≥90.0 % for the truncated dilutions (Tables 4 through
7). The essential agreement of evaluable results was initially evaluated using the long dilution
range of ceftazidime/avibactam (0.03/4 – 64/4 µg/mL) and was found to be acceptable for
each species tested; the overall EA of the evaluable results for Enterobacteriaceae was
acceptable with both the long (0.03/4 – 64/4 µg/mL) and truncated dilutions (0.25/4 – 64/4
µg/mL).

For P. rettgeri the EA for isolates tested using Prompt inoculation and Walkaway read was
50.0%. The essential agreement of tests prepared and interpreted with other combinations of
inoculation and read methods was acceptable at >90.0%. In addition, isolates of P. rettgeri
gave MIC values resulting in major errors when tested using the Prompt inoculation method
with WalkAway read and with the Turbidity inoculation method with both WalkAway and
Manual read. To address the lack of EA and the potential for major errors for P. rettgeri, the
following limitation was included in the device labeling:
Results obtained with P. rettgeri and ceftazidime/avibactam with the Prompt Inoculation
system and WalkAway read were outside of essential agreement compared to the
reference method; results should be confirmed using manual read. In addition, isolates of
P. rettgeri providing MIC values ≥ 16 µg/mL with ceftazidime/avibactam should be
retested using an alternate method to avoid major errors.
For S. marcescens, the EA for isolates tested using Prompt inoculation and Walkaway read
was 75.0%. The essential agreement of tests prepared and interpreted with other
combinations of inoculation and read methods for these two species were acceptable at
>90.0%. The following limitation was included in the device labeling:
Results obtained with S. marcescens when using the Prompt Inoculation system and
WalkAway read were outside of essential agreement compared to the reference method.
Results obtained with this species should be confirmed using manual read.
There was a total of 13 resistant strains of P. aeruginosa and 2 resistant isolates of P. stuartii
included in the study. Some isolates of these two species gave MIC values resulting in very
major errors when tested with all inoculation and read methods; the percent of very major
errors was 100% (2/2) for P. stuartii. The percent of very major errors obtained with P.
aeruginosa ranged from 15.4 to 23.1% (2/13 and 3/13) for P. aeruginosa. One isolate of P.
aeruginosa that gave a very major error during the clinical study (reference method result,
16 µg/mL, MicroScan result, 4 µg/mL) was retested multiple times with the reference

method; all replicate testing with the reference method showed MIC values of 4 µg/mL for
this isolate, which demonstrates agreement with the original MicroScan panel results.
Because ceftazidime/avibactam has no intermediate breakpoint, some MIC values for these
two species resulted in very major errors but were within EA of the reference method. The
very major error rate was adjusted to reflect results within EA; the adjusted very major rate
for P. aeruginosa was 7.7% (1/13) for all inoculation and read methods. The adjusted very
major error rate for P. stuartii was 0% (Prompt with WalkAway. Prompt with Manual read
and Turbidity with WalkAway) or 50% (Prompt with autoSCAN-4, Turbidity with
autoSCAN-4 and Turbidity with manual read) for P. stuartii. Due to the potential for very
major errors with P. stuartii and P. aeruginosa for isolates that give MIC values of 4 and 8
µg/mL, the following limitation was included in the device labeling:
Due to the occurrence of very major errors with all inoculation and read methods,
isolates of Providencia stuartii that provide MICs of 4 and 8 µg/mL and isolates of P.
aeruginosa that provide MICs of 4 µg/mL should be retested using an alternative/method.
In addition, to address the very major error rate observed with P. aeruginosa and P. stuartii,
and the lack of an intermediate breakpoint for ceftazidime/avibactam the following footnote
was added to the performance table:
The overall very major error rate for Enterobacteriaceae with Prompt inoculation and
Walkaway read was 11.1% (n=2/18, both errors with Providencia stuartii). All very
major errors were one dilution apart from the reference method and as such fall within
essential agreement. Based on the essential agreement and lack of an intermediate
breakpoint for ceftazidime/avibactam, the adjusted very major error rate for
Enterobacteriaceae is 0%.
The overall very major error rate for P. aeruginosa with Prompt inoculation and
Walkaway read was 15.4% (n=2/13). One of the very major errors was one dilution
apart from the reference method and as such fell within essential agreement. Based on
the essential agreement and the lack of an intermediate breakpoint for
ceftazidime/avibactam, the adjusted very major error rate for P. aeruginosa is 7.7%. For
the second P. aeruginosa isolate providing a very major error, replicate testing of the
reference method gave results identical to those obtained with the MicroScan panel.
No resistant strains were evaluated for the following species: C. freundii complex, C. koseri,
M. morganii, and P. mirabilis. The following limitation was included in the device labeling to
reflect the undetermined ability of the MicroScan panel to detect resistance in these species:
The ability of the MicroScan Dried Gram Negative Panels to detect resistance to
ceftazidime avibactam is unknown with C. freundii complex, C. koseri, M. morganii, and
P. mirabilis because resistant strains were not available at the time of comparative
testing. If such isolates are observed, they should be tested on an alternate method and/or
submitted to a reference lab.
The following limitation was added to the device labeling to reflect potential erroneous
results that may occur based on inaccurate inoculum concentrations, especially with manual
inoculum preparation methods:
Elevated MICs with beta-lactam antimicrobials (e.g. ceftazidime/avibactam) may be
observed if panels are over-inoculated with microorganisms such as Pseudomonas
12

aeruginosa, Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Morganella spp., and Providencia spp. Inoculum
concentration is critical with these antimicrobials as their mechanism of action involves
disruption of bacterial cell wall synthesis. The user should pay careful attention to
inoculum preparation, especially with manual methods that are technique dependent
such as the Prompt system or inoculum prepared without the aid of a photometric device.
Enzyme Group Molecular Characterization
Isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa harboring various molecular mechanisms
of resistance noted in the FDA drug label were tested with ceftazidime/avibactam. The
following resistance mechanisms were evaluated: cAmpC, IMP, OXA, KPC, SME, TEM,
NDM, CMY, SHV, CTX-M, OMPC, OMPK, PDC, GES, and VEB.
To address resistance mechanisms not tested, the following limitation was added to the
device labeling:
Enzyme group characterization was performed at the time of comparative testing with the
exception of testing of OprD (outer membrane porin) for strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
In addition, to address resistance mechanisms against which ceftazidime/avibactam may not
be active, the following limitation was added to the device labeling:
Ceftazidime/Avibactam is not active against Enterobacteriaceae bacteria that
produce metallo-beta lactamases and may not have activity against gram-negative
bacteria that overexpress efflux pumps or have porin mutations.
MIC Trending
An analysis of trending was conducted using the combined clinical and challenge data for P.
aeruginosa and for Enterobacteriaceae using the long ceftazidime/avibactam dilution range
of 0.03 – 64 µg/mL. This trending calculation takes into account MIC values that are
determined to be one or more doubling dilution lower or higher compared to the reference
method irrespective of whether the device MIC values are on-scale or not.
The data for 107 P. aeruginosa results determined to be evaluable for trending analysis
showed no evidence of trending.
The data for 532 Enterobacteriaceae results determined to be evaluable for trending analysis
showed evidence of low trending for panels inoculated using the Prompt inoculation method
and read using autoSCAN-4 or for panels inoculated using the turbidity inoculation method
and read using the WalkAway or Manual read methods. The following footnote to the
performance table was added to the device labeling:
Ceftazidime/Avibactam MIC values for Enterobacteriaceae were most frequently in exact
agreement with the reference method. When not in agreement, results by
Prompt/autoSCAN-4 read and Turbidity/WalkAway and Manual read tended to be at
least one doubling dilution lower than the reference method.
