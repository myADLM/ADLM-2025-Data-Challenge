L. Test Principle:
The AESKUSLIDES nDNA assay utilizes indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay
techniques. Patient sera are diluted in wash/sample buffer at a recommend screening dilution
of 1:10 and applied to a well on the slide. nDNA antibodies, if present, will bind to antigens
coated on the slide. After washing with wash/sample buffer, a conjugate specific for human
IgG is applied which binds to the nDNA antibodies immobilized on the slide surface. After a
final wash to remove excess conjugate, the slide is mounted and read as soon as possible
using a fluorescence microscope for manual microscopy or HELIOS AUTOMATED IFA
SYSTEM. The HELIOS AUTOMATED IFA SYSTEM will dilute samples, process slides,
scans the slides, generates the image, and provides a positive/negative pre-classification
suggestion that must be confirmed by trained personel.
Interpretation of results
Manual interpretation of tests results
AESKU recommends a screening dilution of 1:10, followed by serial dilution for
semiquantitative determinations and suggests each laboratory establish its own screening
dilution and titration scheme based on its population and instrumentation.
The fluorescence intensity level is the intensity of the specific fluorescence expressed as a
numeric value. These values, if present, are reported as a number between “0” (no specific
flurescence) and “4+” (very strong visible reaction).
Qualitative evaluation
A serum dilution is considered negative for nDNA antibodies if the cells exhibit < 1+
fluorescence of the kinetoplast. A sample is considered positive for nDNA antibodies if it
exhibits exhibit ≥ 1+ fluorescence of the kinetoplast at a sample dilution of 1:10 or greater.
Operators should report all titers and specific fluorescence staining seen.
Semi-quantitative evaluation
The endpoint titer is defined as the highest sample dilution factor for which a specific pattern
is identifiable. The titers are classified as in the table below:
Dilution Titer
1:10 Low
1:20 and 1:40 Medium
1:80 and greater High
5

[Table 1 on page 5]
	Dilution			Titer	
1:10			Low		
1:20 and 1:40			Medium		
1:80 and greater			High		

--- Page 6 ---
Automated instrument interpretation of results
The HELIOS DEVICE SOFTWARE examines the fluorescence intensity and uses an
analysis algorithm which takes exposure and pixel frequency into account. It examines
relevant regions of the captured images, such as the fluorescence cell area and subtracts the
background, to provide an assessment of positive or negative results.
Trained operators must confirm all assessments made by the HELIOS DEVICE
SOFTWARE. Intensity and End Point Titers are identified by the HELIOS DEVICE
SOFTWARE and pattern assessmentst are made by the HELIOS PATTERN
RECOGNITION tool.
Intensity Interpretation
+ nDNA positive

AESKU recommends a screening dilution of 1:10, followed by serial dilution for
semiquantitative determinations and suggests each laboratory establish its own screening
dilution and titration scheme based on its population.
M. Performance Characteristics:
Nomenclature and acronyms used in the studies:

Between-Lot
Imprecision due to reagent lot was performed using three reagent lots each for
AESKUSLIDES nDNA. Eleven serum samples were assayed 10 times on each
reagent lot to give a total of 30 replicates per serum sample. Slides were processed
manually according to the instructions for use and subsequently analyzed at the
microscope by two independent readers. The results demonstrated one hundred
percent agreement ( i.e., positive, negative, overall, and FI agreement) between for all
three reagent lots tested.
Endpoint titer determination
Within-Lab Precision
The imprecision associated with reporting endpoint titer was performed at three
different sites. Five serum samples with endpoint titers between 1:10 and 1:320 (10,
20,40, 160, 320) were diluted serially, ranging from 1:10 up to 1:1280. For each
sample, a minimum of four different dilutions around the expected endpoint titer were
made. Serum dilutions were assayed on AESKUSLIDES nDNA and analyzed on
HELIOS (Method B) and manually at the microscope (Method C) by two
independent readers. For each of the two methods, each serum dilution was assayed
on five days, with two runs per day and three replicates per run, resulting in 30
repetitions per serum dilution per reader. For each replicate of the dilution series the
endpoint titer was reported as the reciprocal of the highest dilution at which the
sample was classified as positive. The percentage of samples that differ a maximum
+/-1 titer level from each other and percentage of samples that are > +/-1 titer level
away from each other were calculated. The following table represents the samples
used in the the study:
The results of within-lab precision for Method B and Method C are summarized in
the following tables:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Positive Control is manufactured by diluting human serum that contains high
titter of anti-dsDNA antibodies with protein-based diluent solution, containing
preservative. The positive control is a serum from a certified supplier.
Stability:
Shelf-life Stability:
Real-time shelf-life stability testing is ongoing. At the time of submission, stability of
three different reagent lots of AESKUSLIDES nDNA stored at 2–8°C was
demonstrated to be three months.
Accelerated Stability:
Three lots of complete kits (including slides, controls, conjugate, & sample buffer) of
AESKUSLIDES nDNA were stored at 37°C for 6 weeks. At t=0, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3
weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, and 6 weeks, a kit was manually tested on a set of eight
samples that included negative, low, medium, and high titers. Slides were processed
manually according to the instructions for use and subsequently analyzed at the
microscope by two independent readers. The data supported a shelf life of 24 months
at 2–8°C.
Sample Freeze-Thaw Stability:
Serum stability following multiple freeze-thaw intervals was demonstrated using
eight serum samples (seven positive, one negative). Low positive, medium positive,
and high positive samples were tested. For each serum, one aliquot was prepared to
serve as control (no freeze-thawing). A second aliquot for each serum was prepared
that underwent four freeze-thaw cycles. All samples and controls were analyzed on
AESKUSLIDES nDNA according to the instructions for use. Slides were read by two
independent readers. Each freeze/thaw sample was compared to the respective control

sample. Freezing and thawing up to four times did not affect serum stability.
Long-Term stability
Seven serum samples (four positive and three negative) were aliquoted and stored at
−20°C. Frozen aliquots of the different sera were thawed and assayed on
AESKUSLIDES nDNA at 4, 8 10, 12, and 14 months. All studies were performed
using Method C according to the device’s instruction for use. Stability was mainted
over the entire 14 months for all samples tested.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference
The effect of interfering substances was evaluated by spiking eight different
substances, listed in the table below, at two different concentrations into eight
different serum samples. Controls were prepared for each serum sample by spiking in
only the respective amount of diluent without interfering substances. Spiked serum
samples and controls were tested in triplicates for each concentration of interferent
with AESKUSLIDES nDNA. All tests were performed manually according to the
instruction for use. Results were analyzed by two independent readers at the
microscope. No significant interference was observed for samples containing each
interferernce up to the following concentration:

Carry-over
A study was performed to demonstrate that the HELIOS instrument does not carry
over a positive sample to a negative well. Three high positive samples were run on
HELIOS in alternate with a negative serum sample. Tests were performed in
accordance with the respective instructions for use. Results were confirmed by a
reader. No carry over was observed from well to well.
f. Assay cut-off:
The manufacturer recommends a screening dilution of 1:10 followed by serial
dilutions for semi-quantitative determinations. Each laboratory should establish its
own screening dilution and titration scheme based on its patient population.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison with the predicate device was performed using the same 776
serum samples (comprising 297 serum samples from patients with SLE and 479
samples from patients with other diseases) tested in the clinical study (see table
below). Method comparison was performed with AESKUSLIDES nDNA and the
predicate assay (K880742). For each assay, the sample set was processed manually
and analyzed (positive/negative classification) at the microscope (Methods C and D).
All assays were performed according to the respective instructions for use. Samples
were screened at a dilution of 1:10.
