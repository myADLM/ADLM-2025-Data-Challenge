I. Device Description:
The ARIES Group A Assay is a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based qualitative in vitro
diagnostic test system that consists of the ARIES System or the ARIES M1 System with the
associated ARIES Software and an assay-specific Protocol File. The ARIES Group A Assay
cassette is a disposable, single-use device that contains nucleic acid purification reagents, an
internal Sample Processing Control (SPC), and an assay-specific master mix for the detection
of a conserved region of the S. pyogenes sdaB gene. The assay is for use on throat swab
specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of pharyngitis.
Throat swab specimens are collected and transported to the testing laboratory using the
2

--- Page 3 ---
Copan or BD Liquid Amies Elution Swab (ESwab) Collection and Transport System (nylon
flocked swab with 1mL of liquid Amies medium). An aliquot of the transport medium is
added directly to the assay cassette which is loaded into the ARIES instrument for automated
nucleic acid extraction, amplification and detection.
The assay cassette includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC) that is extracted and
processed with the patient specimen. The SPC is designed to monitor DNA recovery,
amplification and detection.
Extracted nucleic acid is transferred through the assay cassette by magnetic beads and the
eluted sample is then used to rehydrate lyophilized PCR reagents that are specific for the S.
pyogenes sdaB gene and the SPC. Each primer pair is labeled with a different fluorophore
and is detected in a different optical channel of the ARIES Systems. During PCR
amplification, synthetic quencher nucleotides are incorporated into the amplified products
that result in a decrease in fluorescence in the corresponding optical channel when target
DNA is present. Following amplification, melt curve analysis is performed to confirm the
identity of the amplicons generated. Results are interpreted automatically using parameters in
the ARIES Group A Strep Assay Protocol File as either “Group A Streptococcus Positive”,
“Group A Streptococcus Negative” or “Invalid”, and may be reported from the ARIES
Software or from the optional SYNCT Software desktop application.

L. Test Principle:
The ARIES Group A Strep Assay is performed on throat swabs from patients with signs and
symptoms of pharyngitis. Specimens are collected using the Copan Liquid Amies Elution
Swab (ESwab) Collection and Transport System. Upon receipt in the testing laboratory, the
ESwab tube is vortexed to mix the contents, and 200µL of the transport medium is then
added to an ARIES Group A Strep Assay cassette which is loaded into the magazine of the
ARIES System for automated processing. Up to 6 cassettes can be loaded in a single
magazine. Within the instrument, a barcode on the ARIES Group A Strep Assay cassette is
automatically scanned to associate the cassette with the appropriate assay protocol that
provides all the necessary information to perform the test, analyze the data and generate the
result report.
Each assay cassette contains all the reagents needed for nucleic acid extraction, amplification
and detection for one sample and includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC) to monitor
reagent and process integrity. Processing of the sample within the assay cassette is fully
automated and there is no direct contact between the sample or reagents and the instrument,
thereby reducing the potential for contamination.
The extracted nucleic acids are used to rehydrate the lyophilized PCR Master Mix which
contains specific, fluorescently labeled primers for the S. pyogenes target and the SPC. The
primers contain the synthetic nucleotide base 2'-deoxy-5-methyl-isocytidine (iC). During PCR
amplification, incorporation of quencher-modified 2'-deoxyisoguanosine triphosphate (iG) into
the nascent DNA strand opposite the iC residues results in a target-specific reduction of
fluorescence with each successive cycle as amplicons accumulate. The ARIES Systems
monitor the decrease in fluorescence in real-time and use the changes in signal over the
course of the reaction to calculate amplification cycle (Ct) values. At the end of the reaction
the amplification products undergo melt curve analysis to verify their identity. A
combination of metrics for the S. pyogenes gene target and the SPC is used for result
interpretation. If the S. pyogenes target is detected, the sample is reported as “Group A
Streptococcus Positive”. If the S. pyogenes target is not detected but the SPC signal is valid,
the sample is reported as “Group A Streptococcus Negative”, otherwise the result is
“Invalid”.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Site-to-Site Reproducibility
The reproducibility of the ARIES Group A Strep Assay between sites was evaluated in a
study performed by two operators at each of three sites over a period of five days. Each
operator tested a blinded panel of S. pyogenes positive and negative samples using the same
lot of reagents (3 sites X 2 operators X 5 days X 3 replicates = 90 data points per panel
member). The panels were prepared using simulated throat swab matrix (Section M(2)(b))

and S. pyogenes strain ATCC 700294. The results of the study demonstrated acceptable
reproducibility from site-to-site at target levels close to the limit of detection (LoD) of the
assay (Table 1).

Within Laboratory Precision/Repeatability
Within laboratory precision/repeatability of the ARIES Group A Strep Assay was evaluated
by two operators who tested a panel of samples in triplicate on a single ARIES instrument
over a period of 5 days (2 operators X 3 replicates X 5 days = 30 replicates per panel
member). The panel members were the same as those used in the Site-to-Site Reproducibility
Study, above. The results of the study demonstrated acceptable repeatability and precision
from day-to-day with target levels close to the LoD of the assay (Table 2).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Specimen Stability
The stability of throat swabs for use with the ARIES Group A Strep Assay was evaluated
analytically by testing pooled S. pyogenes negative Eswab swab specimens that were seeded
with an enumerated suspension of cultured organisms and stored under different conditions.
Unseeded Eswab throat matrix was included to assess the effect of specimen storage on the
performance of the SPC. Twenty (20) S. pyogenes positive and two (2) S. pyogenes negative
assay replicates were tested at each stability time point. The results of these studies support
the stability of throat swabs for use with the ARIES Group A Strep Assay when collected
using the ESwab Specimen Collection and Transport System for up to 7 days at 4-8°C, up to
48 hours at 20-25°C or up to 6 months when frozen at ≤-70°C.
Reagent Stability
The shelf-life of the ARIES Group A Strep Assay cassettes was evaluated in a real-time
stability study performed on three lots of reagents that were stored either refrigerated (2-8°C)
or at room temperature (15-30°C). The results from the study support assignment of an
expiration date 7 months from the day of manufacture for the assay cassettes when stored
under the recommended conditions.
Sample Processing Control
Each ARIES Group A Strep Assay cassette contains a Sample Processing Control (SPC) that
is designed to monitor DNA recovery, amplification and detection. Samples that are negative
for S. pyogenes by the ARIES assay and in which the SPC is not detected are reported as

“Invalid” and must be retested using the residual swab transport medium and a new test
cassette.
External Controls
External Controls should be tested according to guidelines or requirements of local, provincial
and/or federal regulations or accreditation organizations. A reference strain of S. pyogenes or
well characterized clinical isolate may be used as a Positive Control. ESwab transport medium
may be used as a Negative Control. Alternatively, clinical specimens that are known to be
positive or negative for S. pyogenes may be used as Positive and Negative External Controls,
respectively.
External Positive and Negative Controls were tested on a daily basis during the prospective
Clinical Study described in Section M(3)(a) using a total of four ARIES systems and three
reagent lots. The Positive External Control comprised a standardized suspension of a strain of
S. pyogenes ATCC 700294 at 1.24 x 104 CFU/mL (3X LoD). The Negative External Control
comprised liquid Amies medium alone. On initial testing, 153/158 (96.9%) Positive and
163/163 (100%) Negative External Controls produced the expected results.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection
The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the ARIES Group A Strep Assay was estimated for two
strains of S. pyogenes by testing various dilutions of enumerated cell stocks in throat swab
matrix. The LoD for each strain was then confirmed by testing a further 20 replicates at the
lowest target level that produced 100% positive results. The LoD was defined as the lowest
concentration tested at which ≥95% of assay replicates produced positive results. For ATCC
19615, the LoD was determined to be 2.58 x 103 CFU/mL and for ATCC 700294 it was 4.13
x 103 CFU/mL.
Inclusivity (Analytical Reactivity)
The inclusivity of the ARIES Group A Strep Assay was evaluated by testing nine strains of
S. pyogenes in simulated throat swab matrix in addition to those included in the LoD Study
(Table 4). Eight of the nine strains produced 3/3 positive results at a concentration of 1.24 x
104 CFU/mL (3X the LoD for ATCC 700294). Strain ATCC 12384 gave one false negative
result at this target level but produced 3/3 positive results at 2.07 x 104 CFU/mL, equivalent
to 5X LoD for ATCC 700294. These results are acceptable.

was shown to be well conserved, with no evidence of sequence heterogeneity that could lead
to false negative results. This is acceptable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity Study
The analytical specificity of the ARIES Group A Strep Assay was evaluated by testing a
panel of 35 organisms that may be found in throat swab specimens (Table 5). Each strain
was tested in triplicate in simulated throat swab matrix at ≥106 CFU/mL (or the highest
concentration attainable). No false positive or Invalid results were obtained. These results are
acceptable.

Contamination Study
The potential for false-positive results with the ARIES Group A Strep Assay due to within
run or between run cross-contamination was evaluated by testing an alternating series of S.
pyogenes “high positive” and negative samples in successive instrument runs. The high
positive samples contained S. pyogenes at a concentration of 106 CFU/mL of simulated throat
swab matrix. Negative samples comprised simulated throat swab matrix alone. The expected
results were obtained for all S. pyogenes positive and negative samples (30/30 each). These
results are acceptable.
f. Assay cut-off:
The ARIES Group A Strep Assay result algorithm uses a combination of parameters based
on cycle threshold, amplicon melting temperature and fluorescence intensity for the S.
pyogenes target and SPC to report results as either Group A Streptococcus Positive, Negative
or Invalid. The algorithm parameters were established through Receiver Operator
Characteristic (ROC) analysis using residual S. pyogenes positive and negative clinical
specimens that were characterized using the same reference method as in the prospective
clinical validation study described in Section M(3)(a).
g. Assay interference:
Potentially Interfering Substances
The potential for interference with the ARIES Group A Strep Assay was evaluated with
endogenous and exogenous substances that may be present in throat swab specimens
(Table 7). Each substance was tested in triplicate in the presence and absence of S. pyogenes
using samples prepared with simulated throat swab matrix (Section M(2)(b)). Invalid results
were obtained in the presence of mucin at 5mg/mL although additional testing demonstrated
no interference at a concentration of ≤4mg/mL. Two of three samples containing 0.5%
NyQuil produced false negative results on initial testing, although repeat analysis under the
same condition produced the expected results. The potential for interference with the ARIES
Group A Strep Assay in the presence of NyQuil (0.5% v/v) and mucin (>4mg/mL) is noted in
the device labeling.

results on initial testing; upon repeat analysis 3/3 replicates produced the expected results.
2 When mucin was tested at 5mg/mL, 2/6 S. pyogenes positive samples and 3/6 S. pyogenes negative
samples produced Invalid results (including initial and repeat testing). All results (15/15) obtained at
0.2-4mg/mL were as expected.
Microbial Interference
The potential for interference with the ARIES Group A Strep Assay by organisms that may
be present in throat swab specimens was investigated using the same list of species that was
evaluated for potential cross-reactivity (refer to Section M(1)(e) and Table 5). Testing was
performed in triplicate with each potentially interfering species in the presence of S.
pyogenes ATCC 700294 at 3X LoD. The potentially interfering species were tested at 106
CFU/mL of simulated throat swab matrix or the highest concentration available. The
expected results were obtained with all the organisms tested with the exception of samples
containing Treponema denticola for which 2/3 replicates produced false negative results. No
titer was available for the T. denticola cell stock used in this study but retesting at a lower
concentration (~50% of the original test concentration) produced the expected results.
Although bioinformatic analysis showed no evidence of cross-reaction between the ARIES
Group A Strep Assay primers and T. denticola, the potential for interference by this organism
is noted in the Limitations section of the device labeling.

b. Matrix comparison:
Comparison of Performance with Natural and Simulated Matrices
To provide a sufficient quantity of material for testing, a simulated throat matrix was used for
the majority of Analytical Studies. Testing with simulated matrix was performed in
accordance with the standard assay procedure by transferring 200µL of the sample to the
ARIES Group A Strep Assay cartridge.
The suitability of the simulated matrix for use in analytical testing was evaluated in a
comparison study with natural clinical matrix. The two matrices were tested in parallel as
part of the LoD Study described Section M(1)(d) using S. pyogenes strains ATCC 19615 and
700294. The results demonstrated similar analytical sensitivity in both matrices and there
were negligible differences in relevant assay metrics for both the S. pyogenes target and SPC.
The study therefore provided acceptable evidence to support the use of simulated matrix in
the Analytical Studies to characterize the performance of the ARIES Group Strep A Assay.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The performance of the ARIES Group A Strep Assay was evaluated in a prospective
multicenter study that was conducted at four (4) clinical sites in the U.S. Throat swab
specimens were collected from subjects who presented with a signs and symptoms of
pharyngitis for whom testing for Group A Streptococcus was ordered by their physician.
At three sites, swab specimens for use in the study were collected under informed
consent, while at one site the study was performed using residual, de-identified
specimens leftover from standard of care testing. All the specimens were collected using
the Copan or BD Liquid Amies Elution Swab (ESwab) Collection and Transport System
and refrigerated within 4 hours. The transport medium from each specimen was divided
into four aliquots for use in different test methods: #1 (≥125µL), for shipment to a
centralized laboratory for reference culture; #2 and #3 (≥250µL each), for testing with the
ARIES Group A Strep Assay at the clinical sites (including repeat analysis, if required);
#4 (≥200µL), stored frozen at ≤-70°C for analysis by PCR/bidirectional sequencing
(only performed for subjects with discordant reference culture and ARIES Group A Strep
results).
The reference culture procedure was performed within 48 hours of specimen collection
and comprised inoculation of Group A Selective Streptococcus Agar and Trypticase Soy
Agar (both containing 5% sheep blood) with 50µL ESwab transport medium and
14

--- Page 15 ---
incubation under anaerobic conditions for up to 48 hours. Culture plates that did not
exhibit b-hemolytic colonies after 48 hours were recorded as negative for Group A
Streptococcus. b-hemolytic colonies present on the primary plates were sub-cultured and
identified by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass
Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS; Bruker Daltonics, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Seven hundred and thirty-five (735) specimens were initially enrolled in the study. Of
these, 112 were excluded from the analysis of performance due to failure to comply with
the reference culture protocol or delay in reference culture (67), failure to meet the
inclusion criteria or eligibility for inclusion not confirmed (30), insufficient specimen
volume (7), use of an incorrect collection swab or eligibility of the swab transport
medium not confirmed (3), lack of a pure isolate (2), ARIES testing performed by an
ineligible operator (2), or prior enrolment of the subject (1). In addition, five specimens
gave inconclusive reference culture results (MALDI-TOF MS log(score) <2.00) and were
excluded from the performance calculations. A total of 618 specimens were therefore
included in the analysis of performance (Table 8). On initial testing, 6/623 specimens
(1.0%) produced Invalid results. All 6 specimens were retested and produced valid results
for a final Invalid rate of 0% (0/623).

The performance of the ARIES Group A Strep Assay at each clinical site in comparison to
the reference culture method is shown in Table 9. Although the number of residual
specimens tested was small, a higher point estimate for sensitivity was observed in testing
performed with specimens collected prospectively under informed consent (98.5%; 95%
confidence interval 94.6-99.6%) than with residual specimens (92.9%, 95% CI: 77.4-98.0%).
Overall, performance was determined to be acceptable.
