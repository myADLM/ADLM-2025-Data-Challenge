4. Panel:
83- Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The BacterioScan 216Dx System is a semi-automated, in vitro diagnostic system
(consisting of an instrument, software, and disposable Multicuvettes) that analyzes light
scattering to measure any bacterial growth directly from urine sample incubated in
trypticase soy broth. The BacterioScan 216Dx is for qualitative determination
(presumptive positive or presumptive negative) of bacteriuria at a density of ≥5x104
CFU/mL. The BacterioScan 216Dx results are intended for use in conjunction with other
clinical and laboratory findings to aid in the diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs).
The 216Dx System is not intended to provide bacteriuria levels, bacterial identification or
differentiation. The system does not distinguish between growth of infecting, colonizing
or contaminating bacteria, or if mixed urogenital flora are present. Presumptive positive
urine samples must be cultured. Presumptive negative urine samples must be cultured if a
low level of bacteriuria is suspected and is clinically relevant. The system also does not
detect anaerobic bacteria, fungi/yeasts, fastidious organisms or those associated with
sterile pyuria.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
· For prescription use only
· BacterioScan 216Dx Multicuvettes must be used only with the BacterioScan 216Dx
System.
· The BacterioScan 216Dx System is a qualitative test based on a defined cut-off and is
not designed to provide bacteria quantitative information.
· Failure to follow the BacterioScan 216Dx System procedures can result in assay
failure or false results. Additionally, improper handling, loading, or
contamination of the Multicuvette can generate false results.
· During the clinical studies, the negative control (i.e. commercially available TSB)
failure rate was 7.5%. One positive control and one negative control should be
included in each instrument run.
· The limit of detection for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus saprophyticus,
Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium urealyticum and Aerococcus spp. was
above the defined cut-off (5x104 CFU/mL) and therefore may not be detected unless
present in a sample at higher density levels.
· The following substances in high concentration could interfere with performance:
2

--- Page 3 ---
Phenazopyridine (>200 µg/mL), Mucin (>0.039%, v/v), Bilirubin (>20 µg/mL),
Leukocytes (>103 cells/mL), and blood (>0.0156%).
· Urine samples that are highly turbid, opaque, with intense coloration (e.g., dark
yellow, orange) or visibly contaminated with blood should not be tested on the
BacterioScan 216Dx System.
· In analytical interference studies, talcum powder (0.4% w/v) and Haemophilus
parainfluenzae (1.1x105 CFU/mL) demonstrated interference (i.e., false positivity);
acidic urine (pH 6.0) may interfere with the positivity of Enterobacter cloacae at
density levels of ≤5x104 CFU/mL.
· In the analytical studies, there were instances where S. aureus did not give positive
results at the Limit of Detection (LoD) density level.
· In analytical inclusivity studies, consistent positive results with Enterococcus faecium
at the defined cut-off were not observed.
· Laser warning statement (User Manual):
Laser Radiation Class 1 Laser Product
Avoid direct exposure to eyes. Do not manually open the instrument door unless
instructed by BacterioScan
4. Special instrument requirements:
· BacterioScan 216Dx Instrument, handheld barcode scanner, a network appliance
computer with pre-loaded software
· Disposable BacterioScan Multicuvettes
I. Device Description:
The BacterioScan 216Dx System consists of a self-contained benchtop 216Dx Instrument
with a handheld barcode scanner, a network appliance computer with pre-loaded software,
and required power and interconnecting Ethernet cable(s). One network appliance can
support up to ten BacterioScan instruments.
BacterioScan provides Multicuvettes for use in the system, along with a calibrated pipettor
for sample processing. The Multicuvettes are single-use disposable cartridges. One
Multicuvette contains four cartridge wells and can be used to test up to four samples; up to
four Multicuvettes may be processed by the 216Dx in a single run (16 samples total).
Using aseptic technique, 2.5 mL of sterile trypticase soy broth (TSB) and 360 µL of urine
sample are added to each Multicuvette well. Inoculated Multicuvette can be placed in any
available test position. Alternatively, remove any Multicuvettes that have completed testing
to allow this position to be used for an untested, inoculated Multicuvette.
The 216Dx examines changes in optical signals over a 3-hour period. Optical signal changes
represent bacterial growth in the urine samples. Testing can be interrupted periodically while
loading or unloading Multicuvettes from the instrument. It is recommended that pausing the
instrument be limited to removing used Multicuvettes, and/or to load a new Multicuvette.
Pauses longer than 15 minutes or frequent pauses in operation will create data analysis gaps
3

--- Page 4 ---
that might adversely impact results. Once the testing of the Multicuvettes is finished, the
sample analysis is available.
Interpretation
A “Presumptive Positive” result indicates that bacteriuria may be present in the sample at a
density of ≥5x104 CFU/mL. Samples reported as Presumptive Positive must be cultured for
bacteriuria levels, mixed flora evaluation, organism isolation/identification, and antimicrobial
susceptibility testing.
A “Presumptive Negative” result may indicate either one of the following:
a. No bacteriuria
b. Bacteriuria at densities below the defined cut-off (5x104 CFU/mL), or
c. Mixed urogenital flora contaminants (or other organisms not commonly
associated with UTI) may be present in the sample, but not detected by the
BacterioScan 216Dx.
Samples classified as Presumptive Negative by the 216Dx must be cultured if bacteriuria is
suspected and considered clinically relevant. Other laboratory information and clinical
symptoms must be considered for final determination of bacteriuria.

L. Test Principle:
The BacterioScan 216Dx System uses laser light scattering to measure turbidity (particle
density) of a prepared urine-broth sample during a period of incubation. The system is
designed to kinetically capture digital measurements of sample turbidity at very low particle
densities. Classification software analyzes these optical signal measurements, and interprets
increasing turbidity as bacterial growth. Samples with robust growth during the second half
of the test cycle, and/or high turbidity, are reported as “Presumptive Positive”. Low turbidity
samples that do not exhibit growth are classified as “Presumptive Negative.” Results are
available in approximately three hours.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility panel consists of E. coli and E. faecalis at high, moderate, and low
density levels was tested at three sites, by two operators in quadruplicate for six non-
consecutive days. All samples were blinded and randomized to the operator. For
simplicity, results are presented for all levels and for high and moderate density levels
combined (i.e. at or above the defined cut-off). Results stratified by operators, sites,
and days are shown in Tables 2.1, 2.3, and 2.5 respectively.
Unspiked human urine (i.e. <50 CFU/mL) was used as a “negative” sample and the
performance stratified by operators, sites, and days is shown in Tables 2.2, 2.4, and
2.6 respectively.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity/dynamic range study was conducted to validate the accuracy of the
216Dx algorithm for extrapolation of the growth curve to determine the starting
organism concentration and to assess the dynamic range of the assay for different
bacterial species. The study included a panel consisting of three gram negative and
three gram positive common UTI pathogens which were spiked into negative human
urine and serially diluted to approximate clinical cut-off. Each inoculum
concentration of each organism was tested in quadruplicates. The following
organisms were evaluated and the density level in CFU/mL at which 100% (4/4)
samples were positive is indicated in parenthesis: E. coli (2.37x103), K. pneumoniae
(1.70x103), E. faecalis (7.33x103), S. aureus (2.1x103), P. mirabilis (3.6x104), and E.
faecium (4.03x105).
Unspiked urine samples were used as negative control and were 100% negative (4/4)
Results demonstrated that the dynamic ranges of detection for each gram-negative
and gram-positive organism are within the range of detection and the algorithm for
reporting “Presumptive Negative” or “Presumptive Positive” are within the tested
range of the dynamic range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
A single positive and negative control were run on each instrument each day of
testing at the clinical site during the comparative studies.
Positive Control
The positive control isolates are E. coli ATCC 25922, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603,
E. faecalis ATCC 29212, and S. aureus ATCC 29213 and they were tested at a
rotating basis. The positive control rate was 99.6% (238/239) due to one E. faecalis
QC failure.
Negative Control
Commercially available TSB (2.5 mL) pipetted into a multicuvette well is used as a
negative control. The negative control rate was 92.5% (221/239). Due to the failure
rate of 7.5% with the negative control, one positive and one negative control should
be included in each instrument run. It is noted in the QC and the limitation sections of
the package insert.
Recommendation added in the package insert is:
· Positive and negative controls in each instrument run
· Specify aseptic technique for negative control
· The run is invalid if negative control fails
· Negative control should be repeated as noted in Table 3 below.

Particle interference notify technical support (See
Troubleshooting Section)
The overall QC rate was 96.0% (459/478).
d. Detection limit:
A limit of detection (LoD) study was conducted to determine the estimated analytical
sensitivity (the lowest organism density level detected with an approximate accuracy
of ≥95%). Ten common and seven rare uropathogens were tested in the study. For
initial LoD estimation, each strain was spiked into fresh, culture-negative human
urine, serially dilution to four density levels at clinical cut-off and tested in
quadruplicate to determine the approximate LoD.
Each strain was then tested in replicates of twenty at the approximated density. LoD
was confirmed when density level performance demonstrated >95% or ≥19/20
(Presumptive Positive). The LoD (CFU/mL) was confirmed by 100% (20/20)
positivity for the following UTI pathogens with LoD in parenthesis.
The organisms commonly recognized as UTI pathogens that were found to be
approximately equivalent to the defined cut-off (104 CFU/mL) are noted below:
E. coli (4.40x103), Proteus mirabilis (8.70x103), Enterobacter cloacae (6.67x103),
Staphylococcus aureus (1.11x103), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1.37x104),
Enterococcus faecalis (2.33x104), and Enterococcus faecium (4.37x104). The rare
UTI pathogens were: Acinetobacter baumannii (1.60x104), Citrobacter
freundii/koseri (2.80x104), Morganella morganii (4.23x104), Actinobaculum
schaalii (2.80x104), and Corynebacterium striatum (4.03x104).
The organisms commonly recognized as UTI pathogens that were found to have LoD
higher than defined cut-off are:
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.87x105), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (2.20x105),
Streptococcus agalactiae (1.42x105), Aerococcus spp. (1.77x105), and
Corynebacterium urealyticum (2.63x105).
Information regarding these organisms was included in the Limitations section of the
package insert.
Analytical Inclusivity
To demonstrate analytical inclusivity, multiple strains of each common and rare UTI
pathogen were tested on the 216Dx System. All strains were spiked into fresh,
culture-negative human urine, serially diluted to a bacteriuria density of
approximately 2-3x LoD for each individual organism to be tested. All samples were

evaluated in quadruplicate. There were ten common and seven rare uropathogens
comprising of 85 and 18 strains respectively.
The uropathogens tested were Escherichia coli (10), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9),
Enterobacter spp. (8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9), Proteus mirabilis (9),
Enterococcus faecalis (8), Enterococcus faecium (5), Staphylococcus aureus (9),
Staphylococcus saprophyticus (9), and Streptococcus agalactiae (9); the positivity
rate was 98.8% (336/340).
When stratified, the positivity rate was 85% (17/20) at density level range of 3.20x104
to 1.03x105 CFU/mL for E. faecium, and 97.2% (35/36 due to one failure at 4.90x103)
or density level range of 4.90x103 to 5.57x104 CFU/mL for S. aureus. Because of the
85% positive rate, a limitation for E. faecium was added in the package insert:
“In analytical inclusivity studies, consistent positive results with Enterococcus
faecium at the defined cut-off were not observed.”
The rare uropathogens tested were Acinetobacter baumannii (3), Actinobaculum
schaalii (1), Aerococcus spp. (3), Citrobacter spp. (5), Corynebacterium striatum (1),
Corynebacterium urealyticum (1), and Morganella morganii (4); the positivity rate
was 100% (72/72).
Unspiked urine samples were 100% negative (8/8).
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous or Exogenous Substances/Microbial Interference
This study was conducted to evaluate the 216Dx performance in the presence of
endogenous or exogenous substances that may be found in urine, or various
organisms present in urine that are not expected to grow under the standard
conditions in the BacterioScan system. Representative strains of four gram-negative
(E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and E. cloacae) and three gram-positive (E.
faecalis, E. faecium, and S. aureus) UTI pathogens at 2-3x LoD density level were
spiked into fresh, culture-negative human urine that had first been spiked with an
interfering substance/microorganism. A corresponding unspiked urine control was
included for each interfering substance/organism.
There were a total of 17 interfering substances tested:
Albumin, glucose, phenazopyridine, seminal fluid, talcum powder, blood, bilirubin,
acetaminophen, ibuprofen, mucin, human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG),
testosterone, cortisol, progesterone, leukocytes, fluconazole, and flucytosine.
Acidic urine and alkaline urine were also tested.
Three potentially interfering organisms were tested:
H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, and N. gonorrhoeae
11

--- Page 12 ---
To confirm that the 216Dx could detect each organism at the densities tested,
corresponding urine samples lacking each interfering substance/microorganism were
processed in parallel and evaluated in the 216Dx concurrently. All samples were
evaluated in replicates of four.
The results indicated that the majority of potential substances that may be found in
human urine did not interfere with the 216Dx’s performance. The following
substances with concentrations were noted to interfere with performance:
· Phenazopyridine >200 µg/mL
· Blood >0.0156%
· Bilirubin >20 µg/mL
· Mucin >0.039%, v/v
· Leukocytes >103 cells/mL
· Talcum powder of 0.4% w/v and H. parainfluenzae at 1.1 x 105 CFU/mL
demonstrated false positivity in unspiked urine
· Acidic urine (pH 6.0) interfered with the positivity of Enterobacter
cloacae at density levels of 8 x 104 CFU/mL.
The study also showed that there were instances where S. aureus did not give positive
results at density level of 103 CFU/mL which is the LoD for S. aureus. Limitation for
S. aureus is noted in the Limitations section of the package insert:
“In the analytical studies, there were instances where S. aureus did not give
positive results at the Limit of Detection density level.”
Potential sources of interference are specified in the Limitations section of the
package insert.

accordance with BacterioScan instructions for use and compared with the reference
culture results. Reference testing was performed using 1 and 10 µL loops. Using each
loop, colony count plates were performed in triplicate, and a median result was generated
for each loop size. Median colony count was determined to be the reference result and
were compared to the 216Dx result. Any colony counts at or above 5x104 CFU/mL are
considered a positive result for the primary analysis for evaluating performance. A
secondary analysis was also performed by taking into account pathogens commonly
associated with UTI (UTI-Associated). Performance was also evaluated for
subpopulation with bacterial densities of ≥1x105 CFU/mL. Organisms isolated from
reference colony counts of >5x104 CFU/mL were identified by Matrix Assisted Laser
Desorption Ionization (MALDI) analysis.
Samples measured and containing bacteriuria of >5x104 CFU/mL is reported by the
BacterioScan 216Dx to be “Presumptive Positive.”
The pathogens commonly associated with UTI (UTI Associated) that were encountered
in the clinical studies were:
Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis,
Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus
faecium, Aerococcus urinae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus aureus;
The rare uropathogens encountered were:
Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Acinetobacter
baumannii, Morganella morganii, Aerococcus sanguinicola, Corynebacterium striatum,
and Staphylococcus saprophyticus.
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Of the 3,153 urine samples tested, 3,052 were evaluable for the primary analysis of
bacteriuria at the defined cut-off, ≥5x104 CFU/mL. For the secondary analysis, the
evaluable specimens were 3,010 for ≥5x104 CFU/mL and 3,020 for ≥1x105 CFU/mL
because the identity of some organisms was not obtained in the reference culture for
the secondary analysis of 5x104 CFU/mL.
All BacterioScan 216Dx results are reported as presumptive. The overall performance
for bacterial density of ≥5x104 CFU/mL is shown in Table 4. The performance for
subpopulation with bacterial density of ≥1x105 CFU/mL is shown in Table 5.

* Limited to bacterial pathogens encountered in the clinical studies
Preserved and unpreserved urine samples were collected during the clinical studies.
Urine samples collected in container without preservatives (e.g., boric acid) were
unpreserved while those collected in container with preservatives were preserved.
They were stratified for analysis. Most of the urine samples were preserved (76.2%,
2326/3052). The performance is shown in Tables 11-14.

* Limited to bacterial pathogens encountered in the clinical studies
The reporting results for the BacterioScan 216Dx is for bacteriuria of 5x104 CFU/mL;
presumptive positive is for bacteriuria ≥5x104 CFU/mL and presumptive negative is
for bacteriuria <5x104 CFU/mL. The performance supports the intended use of
“Presumptive positive urine samples must be cultured. Presumptive negative urine
samples must be cultured if a low level of bacteriuria is suspected and is clinically
relevant.”
b. Clinical specificity:
Same as demonstrated in item a. above
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Non-applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
There were 3,052 urine samples from three geographically dispersed clinical sites. The
percentage of positive cases (positivity rate) determined by the reference culture method
was 26.2% (801/3052) and 42.3% (1290/3052) by the 216Dx instrument. It was
consistent across the U.S. sites.

3. Specimen Identification:
The user logs into the 216Dx interface and is prompted to associate a patient sample ID
with a multicuvette serial number and well location. Briefly, the user scans or manually
enters the multicuvette serial number. Next, the user enters and saves the individual
sample IDs for each of the four well positions.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The user pipettes 2.5 mL of sterile TSB into each multicuvette well using a sterile 5 mL
pipette tip. A 360 µl aliquot of an individual urine sample is transferred to the
corresponding multicuvette well. Once specimens are pipetted into the multicuvette, it is
ready to be run in the 216Dx instrument.
5. Calibration:
No calibration by the user is required.
6. Quality Control:
Negative and positive quality controls should be tested on board the instrument in
accordance with the instructions provided in the product labeling.
