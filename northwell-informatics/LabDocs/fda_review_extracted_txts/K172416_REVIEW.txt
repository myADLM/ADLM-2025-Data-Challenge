prescription use only. The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of enabling
laboratories to determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmatory
method such as GCMS or permitting laboratories to establish quality control
procedures.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific
alternative analytical chemistry method must be used in order to obtain a
confirmed analytical result. Gas or Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry
(GC/MS or LC/MS) are the preferred confirmatory methods. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of
abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary test result is positive.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
For in vitro diagnostic use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Synermed IR-500 Chemistry Analyzer

L. Test Principle:
The Opiate Enzyme Immunoassay is a competitive enzyme immunoassay based on
competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for a fixed amount of antibody in the reagent.
Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, and the drug concentration
in the sample is measured in terms of enzyme activity. In the absence of drug in the
sample, morphine-labeled G6PDH conjugate is bound to antibody and enzyme
activity is inhibited. When free drug is present in the sample antibody binds to the
free drug, the unbound morphine-labeled G6PDH then exhibits its maximum enzyme
activity. Active enzyme converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH
resulting in an absorbance change measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision studies were performed on the Synermed IR-500 by measuring
eleven levels of human urine pools for opiate (0, 75, 150, 225, 300, 375, 450,
525, 600, 800, and 1000 ng/mL). Each sample was run in duplicate twice a
day for twenty days for a total of 80 measurements at each concentration in
both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. The data are summarized in the
following tables:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To demonstrate linearity, a drug recovery study in the semi-quantitative mode
was conducted on the Synermed IR-500 by measuring twelve levels of human
urine pools (Samples were prepared by intermixing a high urine pool with a
low urine pool to obtain twelve concentrations across the measuring range: 0,
25, 75, 150, 225, 300, 450, 600, 800, 1000, 1100, and 1250 ng/mL), using
four replicates at each level. Each level of pooled human urine was confirmed
by UHPLC-MSMS. The results confirmed acceptable recovery of samples
tested.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The calibrator to be used with this device were previously cleared under
k020769.
d. Detection limit:
See section M.1.a. for device performance around the cutoff.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity from structurally related compounds, as well as interference
of exogenous and endogenous substances was evaluated in k110298.
f. Assay cut-off:
Analytical performance of the device around the claimed cutoff is described in
the precision section above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed using unaltered clinical urine
samples. A total of 100 samples were analyzed in singlicate in both
Qualitative and Semi-quantitative modes, and the results were compared to
UHPLC-MSMS. The results from the study in the two modes were identical
and are summarized in the table below.
