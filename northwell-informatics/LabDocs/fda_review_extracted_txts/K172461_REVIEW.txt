6. Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Recommendations for Anti-Nuclear Antibody
(ANA) Test System Premarket (510k) Submissions
L. Test Principle:
AESKUSLIDES ANCA is an indirect fluorescent antibody assay utilizing human neutrophil-
granulocyte-coated slides fixed with Ethanol or Formalin as a substrate for the qualitative
and semi-quantitative determination of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA)
in human serum by manual microscopy or with the HELIOS AUTOMATED IFA SYSTEM.
Slides coated with human neutrophil granulocytes for autoantibody detection are fixed by
two different methods: ethanol (EtOH) fixation or formalin fixation. Ethanol fixation allows
cell components to move through the cells after the fixation process. Formalin fixation causes
cellular components to cross-link, i.e., movement of cellular components is abrogated and the
patterns are distinct. By processing serum on both Ethanol and Formalin-fixed slides, the
user can confirm if the pattern is C-, P-, or A-ANCA, according to the table below.
Ethanol-fixed Result Formalin-Fixed Result Pattern
Cytoplasmic (C-ANCA) Cytoplasmic (C-ANCA) C-ANCA
Perinuclear (P-ANCA) Cytoplasmic (C-ANCA) P-ANCA
Perinuclear (P-ANCA) Negative / unclear Confirm with ANA
*
Mixed (P-ANCA + C-ANCA) Negative / weak positive A-ANCA
Very Perinuclear A-ANCA A-ANCA
*Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA)
The ANCA Formalin test is not intended to be used by itself, but in conjunction with the
ANCA Ethanol test.
The HELIOS Vasculitis Pattern Plus software is able to detect both C- and P-ANCA patterns.
The A-ANCA pattern is reported as undefined positive. All suggested results obtained with
the HELIOS AUTOMATED IFA SYSTEM must be confirmed by trained personnel.
Manual interpretation of AESKUSLIDES ANCA (Ethanol):
The two main patterns seen on an ethanol-fixed substrate are perinuclear (P-ANCA) and
cytoplasmic (C-ANCA):
- C-ANCA presents as coarse speckled cytoplasmic fluorescence, often with accentuated
staining between the nuclear lobes. This pattern is characteristic for antibodies reacting
with proteinase 3 (PR3).
- P-ANCA presents as perinuclear staining with or without nuclear extension. This pattern
is usually characteristic for antibodies reacting with myeloperoxidase (MPO). Note that
anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) positive samples (containing anti-DNA/histones) may react
with the nuclei of ethanol-fixed neutrophils, causing nuclear staining, and may mask or
mimic the P-ANCA pattern(s).

[Table 1 on page 5]
Ethanol-fixed Result	Formalin-Fixed Result	Pattern
Cytoplasmic (C-ANCA)	Cytoplasmic (C-ANCA)	C-ANCA
Perinuclear (P-ANCA)	Cytoplasmic (C-ANCA)	P-ANCA
Perinuclear (P-ANCA)	Negative / unclear	*
Confirm with ANA
Mixed (P-ANCA + C-ANCA)	Negative / weak positive	A-ANCA
Very Perinuclear	A-ANCA	A-ANCA

--- Page 6 ---
A third pattern, less commonly seen, is called atypical ANCA (A-ANCA or X-ANCA):
- A-ANCA presents as a cytoplasmic and perinuclear or very perinuclear staining on
ethanol-fixed neutrophil substrate and usually becomes negative on formalin-fixed
substrate.
Manual interpretation of AESKUSLIDES ANCA (Formalin):
On formalin fixed substrate, both MPO and PR3 antibodies appear as coarse cytoplasmic
granular staining with interlobular accentuation.
Results from both AESKUSLIDES ANCA Ethanol and Formalin provide further information
on the antibodies present in the serum. The fluorescence intensity level is the intensity of the
specific fluorescence expressed as a numeric value. These values are reported as a number
between “0” (no specific fluorescence) and “4+” (very strong visible reaction).
Intensity Interpretation
maximal fluorescence, very strong
4+ high positive visible reaction; brilliant yellow‐green
strong visible reaction; less brilliant
3+ positive than 4+; yellow‐green fluorescence
moderate visible reaction; definite but
2+ positive dull yellow‐green fluorescence
weak visible reaction, very dim
1+ positive subdued fluorescence
0 negative no specific fluorescence
AESKU recommends a screening dilution of 1:20, followed by serial dilutions for semi-
quantitative determinations, and suggests each laboratory establish its own screening dilution
and titration scheme based on its population.
Qualitative Evaluation
A serum dilution is considered negative for ANCA antibodies if the cells exhibit < 1+
fluorescence in the cytoplasm or nucleus. Likewise, a serum dilution is considered positive
for ANCA antibodies if the cells exhibit ≥ 1+ fluorescence in the cytoplasm or nucleus. A
sample is considered positive for ANCA antibodies if it exhibits ≥ 1+ fluorescence of the
cytoplasm or nucleus at a sample dilution of 1:20 or greater. Operators should report all titers
and specific fluorescence staining seen.
Semi‐quantitative Evaluation
The endpoint titer is defined as the highest sample dilution factor for which specific
fluorescence of the cytoplasm or nucleus is identifiable. The titers are classified as:
- 1:20 and 1:40 are considered low titers

[Table 1 on page 6]
Intensity	Interpretation	
		
	high positive	maximal fluorescence, very strong

	positive	strong visible reaction; less brilliant

dull yellow‐green fluorescence

- 1:80 and 1:160 are considered medium titers
- 1:320 and greater are considered high titers
Automated instrument interpretation of test results by the software:
After slides are processed by the HELIOS AUTOMATED IFA SYSTEM, digital images of
representative fields of view in the well are captured and stored on the computer system. The
HELIOS AUTOMATED IFA SYSTEM Pattern Recognition software recognizes the pattern
of the captured image by using SVM (Support Vector Machine) technology. After image pre-
processing, feature extraction and classification, the software delivers the results. All
suggested results given by the HELIOS AUTOMATED IFA SYSTEM software must be
confirmed within the Result Confirmation tool by a trained operator.
The HELIOS PATTERN RECOGNITON software tool identifies the following
Immunofluorescence patterns:
The HELIOS DEVICE SOFTWARE examines the fluorescence intensity and uses an analysis
algorithm which takes exposure and pixel frequency into account. It examines relevant
regions of the captured images, such as the fluorescence cell area, and subtracts the
background, to provide an assessment of positive or negative results.
Intensity Interpretation
+ positive
- negative
Trained operators must confirm all suggestions. Intensity and End Point Titers are identified
by the HELIOS DEVICE SOFTWARE and pattern suggestions are made by the HELIOS
PATTERN RECOGNITION tool.
AESKU recommends a screening dilution of 1:20, followed by serial dilutions for semi-
quantitative determinations and suggests each laboratory establish its own screening dilution
and titration scheme based on its population.
M. Performance Characteristics:
The results of all the studies met the Manufacturer’s pre-specified acceptance criteria.
1. Analytical performance:
To establish the analytical performance parameters of the device, the following methods
have been applied:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
All runs have been performed according to the respective instructions for use (IFUs).
One positive and one negative control (kit controls) were included in each run.
Samples were tested at 1:20 dilution. Results were analyzed by two independent
readers. The samples were characterized using three different methods: method A
(HELIOS), method B (HELIOS User Evaluation) and method C (Manual
AESKSULIDES ANCA). Positive/negative classification and pattern was recorded
for each sample in each run and for each method. Fluorescence intensity (FI)
agreement was determined for method C. Pattern suggestion in method A was
provided by the Vasculitis Pattern Plus software tool. FI % agreement across all
samples was evaluated only for method C and was calculated as the number of
samples that did not differ from expected by more than ±1 fluorescene intensity
divided by the number of total samples.
Within-Lab Precision:
To assess the precision performance of the AESKUSLIDES ANCA Ethanol and
Formalin, 10 samples were tested over five days, two runs per day, three replicates
per sample run, resulting in 30 data points for each sample. For ANCA Ethanol, eight
samples were positive, four with P-ANCA pattern, of which two were high positive
and two medium positive, and four with C-ANCA pattern, of which two were
borderline positive, one was medium positive and one was high positive. Two
samples were negative. For ANCA Formalin, eight samples were positive (all C-
ANCA pattern), of which four were high positive, three were medium positive and
one was low positive. There were two negative samples. Below are the results of the
within-lab precision study.

For AESKUSLIDES ANCA Formalin kit, agreement for positive samples was 100%
for all methods. For negative samples, agreement was >90% for all methods.
Between-Site Reproducibility:
There were 10 samples tested on five days, two runs per day, three replicates per
sample per run, at three different study sites. Two study sites were in the U.S., while
one was in Germany, with one HELIOS AUTOMATED IFA SYSTEM per study
site. Results were analyzed by two different readers per study site, resulting in a total
of 90 data points per sample. For ANCA Ethanol, there were four P-ANCA patterns,
with two high positive and two medium positive, and four C-ANCA patterns, with
one high positive, one medium positive and two borderline samples. For ANCA
Formalin, there were eight C-ANCA patterns, with four high positive, three medium
and one low positive sample. There were also two negative samples included in the
Ethanol and Formalin sample sets. Below are the results of the between-site
reproducibility study.
ANCA Ethanol Method C, site-to-site reproducibility results:
When borderline samples were excluded, positive-, negative-, overall-, pattern-, and
FI-agreements for method C ranged from 99.6% to 100.0%. When borderline
samples were included, the agreements for method C are presented in the table
below:

AESKUSLIDES ANCA Ethanol and ANCA Formalin. For ANCA Ethanol, 12 sera
were tested: four P-ANCA patterns, with two high and two medium positive
samples, four C-ANCA patterns, with two high, one medium and one low positive
sample, two A-ANCA patterns, with one high and one medium positive sample, and
two negative samples. For ANCA Formalin, 12 sera were tested: eight C-ANCA
patterns, with four high, three medium, and one low positive sample, and four
negative samples. For both ANCA Ethanol and ANCA Formalin each of the 12
serum samples was assayed 10 times on each reagent lot to give a total of 30

each serum dilution was assayed on five days, with two runs per day and three
replicates per run, resulting in 30 repetitions per serum dilution per reader. This study
was conducted at three different study sites to allow the calculation of Between-Site
reproducibility. All runs have been performed according to their respective IFUs. One
positive and one negative kit controls were included in each run. For each replicate of
the dilution series, endpoint titer was reported as the reciprocal of the highest dilution
at which the sample was classified as positive. Two results were determined to be in
agreement if the reported titers were ±1 titer from the expected value.
Samples used for this study are displayed in the following table:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
A recognized standard for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies is not available.
Stability:
Accelarated Stability Study:
Three lots of complete kits (including slides, controls, conjugate and sample buffer)
of AESKUSLIDES ANCA Ethanol and Formalin were stored at 37°C for 6 weeks.
At t=0, one week, two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, five weeks, and six weeks, a
kit was manually tested on a set of eight samples. For ANCA Ethanol, the following
samples were assayed: three C-ANCA (high-, medium- and low-positive), three P-
ANCA (high-, medium- and low-positive), one A-ANCA (medium-positive), and
one negative sample. For ANCA Formalin, four C-ANCA samples were tested (one
high-, two medium-, one low-, and one borderline-positive), and three negative
samples. The following parameters were assessed: positive-, negative-, overall-,
pattern- and FI-agreements. For AESKUSLIDES ANCA Ethanol all acceptance
criteria were met for a time span of 6 weeks at 37°C. The Sponsor claims a shelf-life
of at least 24 months at 2–8°C. For AESKUSLIDES ANCA Formalin all acceptance
criteria were met for a time span of four weeks at 37°C. The Sponsor claims a shelf-
life of at least 18 months at 2–8°C.
Real-time Stability Study:
In order to confim the results of the Accelareted Stability Study, a real-time stability
study is being conducted over a period of 27 months. ANCA Ethanol and Formalin
kits will be stored at 2–8°C for the aforementioned period. The following time points
are being tested: t = 0, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 27 months. The following samples are
being tested: for ANCA Ethanol, three C-ANCA (high-, medium-, low-positive),
three P-ANCA (high-, medium-, low-positive), one A-ANCA (medium-positive),
and one negative sample; for ANCA Formalin: five C-ANCA (one high-, two
medium-, and two low-positive), and three negative samples. Each serum sample is
being tested in triplicate per run. At t = 0, three runs are being performed for each of
the three different kit lots to give a total of nine repetitions per serum per lot. Two
runs are being conducted for each of three different kit lots to give a total of six
repetitions per serum per lot. Positive-, negative, overall-, pattern- and FI-
agreements will be evaluated. Current results support ANCA Ethanol and ANCA
Formalin real-time stability of at least three months at 2–8°C. This study is ongoing.

In-use Stability Study:
Three different reagent lots were stored at 2–8°C over a time period of 6 weeks.
Tests have been performed at the following time points: t = 0, one, two, four, and six
weeks for each reagent lot. After the first test at time point t= 0, kits were incubated
at 2–8°C. Each kit component (with the exception of slide foils) had been opened
and all buffers (except wash buffer) had been prepared at time point t = 0. Eight
serum samples have been tested at each time point: for ANCA Ethanol, three C-
ANCA (high-, medium-, and low-positive), three P-ANCA (high-, medium-, and
low-positive), one A-ANCA (high-positive), and one negative sample; for ANCA
Formalin, six C-ANCA (one high-, two medium-, one low-, and two borderline-
positive), and two negative samples. Slides were processed manually and analyzed at
the microscope by two independent readers. Positive-, negative-, overall-, pattern-
and FI-agreements were evaluated. The data support in-use stability of six weeks at
2–8°C for both ANCA Ethanol and ANCA Formalin.
Stability data for the diluted wash buffer support a time frame of one week at 2–8°C.
Serum Freeze-Thaw Study:
Serum stability was evaluated by testing 10 serum samples. For ANCA Ethanol, the
following samples were tested: three P-ANCA (two high- and one medium-positive),
three C-ANCA (high-, medium- and low-positive), and one A-ANCA medium-
positive sample, and three negative samples. For ANCA Formalin, there were six C-
ANCA samples tested: three high-, and three medium-positive samples. For each
serum, one aliquot was prepared as a control (no freeze-thaw). A second aliquot for
each serum was prepared that underwent four freeze-thaw cycles. Slides were read
by two independent readers. Each freeze/thaw sample was compared to the
respective control sample. Results were assessed by determining positive-, negative-,
overall-, pattern-, and FI-agreements. All agreements were 100% and support the
manufacturer’s claim that samples can be frozen and thawed up to four times.
Long-term Storage Stability of Sera:
Nine different serum samples were aliquoted and stored at −20°C for a time period
of 14 months. For ANCA Ethanol, the following samples were assayed: two C-
ANCA, three P-ANCA, one A-ANCA, and three negative samples. For ANCA
Formalin, the following samples were assayed: four C-ANCA, one P-ANCA , and
four negative samples. Frozen aliquots of different sera were thawed and assayed
with ANCA Ethanol and ANCA Formalin kits at the following time points: 3, 6, 8,
10, and 14 months. All tests were performed manually and subsequently analyzed at
the microscope. The following parameters were assessed: positive-, negative-,
pattern-, and FI-agreements. The results show that long-term storage of sera at
−20°C over a time period of at least 12 months has no effect on performance and test

Cross-reactivity:
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that Anti-nuclear antibody(ANA)-
positive samples may cause interference with AESKUSLIDES ANCA (Ethanol and
Formalin), leading to fluorescence patterns on neutrophil granlocytes that can be
confused with ANCA patterns. It is known that ANA and other anti-cell antibodies
may interfere with ANCA detection by causing nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining.
It is assumed that the main cause of interference shown in the population below in
tables under Method Comparison to Predicate Device is the result of ANA-
interference in the samples.
In this study, 25 analytically characterzed ANA-positive samples with homogenous,
speckled, centromere, nucleolar, and nuclear dot patterns were tested with ANCA
Ethanol and Formalin kits in triplicates. Methods A, B and C were evaluated. One
positive and one negative control were included in each run. Samples were tested at
1:20 dilution. The number and percentage of ANCA positive samples were
calculated.
In total, 40%, 64% and 60% of ANA positive samples were positive on
AESKLUSLIDES ANCA Ethanol with methods A, B and C, respectively.
In total, 20%, 16% and 16% of ANA positive samples were detected positive on
AESKLUSLIDES ANCA Formalin methods A, B and C, respectively.
The results show that ANA positive samples representing different ANA specific
patterns can also give patterns on neutrophil granulocytes that resemble and can be
confused with P- and C-ANCA patterns. Based on the above results, the following
limitation is contained in the Package Insert: “Decisions about treatment should not
be based solely on ANCA IFA results. ANCA serological test results should be used
in conjunction with information available from the clinical evaluation and other
diagnostic information. Positive ANCA IFA results should be confirmed by MPO and
PR3 ELISA. ANA positive samples may react with fixed neutrophils, generating
fluorescence patterns resembling ANCA patterns.”
f. Assay cut-off:
AESKU recommends a screening dilution of 1:20 followed by serial dilutions for
semi-quantitative determinations, but suggests that each laboratory establishes their
own screening dilution and titration scheme based on their population. The titers of
1:10 and 1:20 are considered low titers. 1:40 and 1:80 are considered medium titers.
and 1:160 and greater are considered high titers.
2. Comparison studies:

--- Page 21 ---
In order to show comparable performance of AESKUSLIDES ANCA (Ethanol and
Formalin) and the predicate assay, a clinical study utilizing 507 serum samples (132
serum samples from patients with AAV and 375 samples from patients with other
diseases) was performed. For each assay, the sample set was processed manually and
analyzed for positive/negative result and pattern classification using Method C.
Positivitiy/negativity was determined in relation to the clinical diagnosis. Samples
were screened at a dilution of 1:20.
