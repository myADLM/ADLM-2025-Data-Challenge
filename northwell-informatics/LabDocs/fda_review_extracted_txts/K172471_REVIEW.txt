L. Test Principle:
CD30 antigen is expressed in mononuclear Hodgkin’s cells and multinucleated Reed
Sternberg cells of Hodgkin Lymphoma as well as on anaplastic large cell lymphomas. The
CD30 (Ber-H2) monoclonal antibody produces membranous, cytoplasmic, and Golgi
staining of both lymphoma cells and of scattered large activated B and T cells in lymph
nodes, spleen, tonsil, and thymus. Approximately 4um thick sections are cut for staining.
After CD30 binding to treated tissue sections, the specific antibody is localized using a
secondary antibody followed by multimer anti-hapten conjugate.

The OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit is an indirect, biotin-free system for detecting mouse
IgG, mouse IgM, and rabbit primary antibodies. The OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit
produces a visible dark brown precipitate (3, 3’-Diaminobenzidine) via a horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) enzymatic reaction at the antigen site. The reaction product precipitates at
the antigen sites localized by VENTANA CD30 (Ber-H2) Assay. The cellular staining
pattern for VENTANA CD30 (Ber-H2) Assay is membranous, cytoplasmic and/or Golgi.The
pathologist evaluates the brown precipitate using bright-field microscopy. A negative control
reagent and tissue controls with positive and negative elements are run with each assay as
process controls.

Precision Study
Between-lot and intra-instrument intermediate precision of VENTANA CD30 (Ber-
H2) staining was evaluated by verifying that replicate slides from a panel of
lymphoma model tissue samples result in concordant CD30 (Ber-H2) status when
stained with full factorial combinations of 3 lots of CD30 (Ber-H2), 3 lots of
OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit, and on 3 BenchMark ULTRA instruments using
twenty-four lymphoma tissue specimens, including 10 positive specimens, 10
negative specimens, and 4 borderline cases, were evaluated by one reader.
The studies were required to demonstrate the same clinical CD30 positive/negative
status with 85% concordance of the 95% lower bound confidence interval (CI) using
the recommended staining protocol. Results in Table 1 show that percent positive
agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) were >93% when borderline
cases were included for antibody lot, detection kit lot, and instrument precision
studies.

Intra-day Repeatability and Inter-day Intermediate Precision Study
The objective of this study was to evaluate the VENTANA CD30 (Ber-H2) Assay
staining repeatability and intermediate precision on lymphoma tissue samples
representing the CD30 (Ber-H2) staining range by verifying concordance of CD30
(Ber-H2) status and/or acceptability. Twenty four lymphoma tissue cases were
enrolled in this study for both intra-day and inter-day analyses, including 4 borderline
cases. Slides were randomized and blinded by assigning a unique identifier to each
slide and scored by one reader.
For intra-day intermediate repeatability, 5 slides per case were stained with CD30
(Ber-H2) and 1 slide per case with Mouse Monoclonal Negative Control Ig to serve
as negative reagent control.
For inter-day intermediate precision, duplicate slides per case were stained with
CD30 (Ber-H2) and 1 slide per case with Mouse Monoclonal Negative Control Ig on
5 non-consecutive days spanning at least a 20-day period. Two CD30 (Ber-H2)-
stained slides per case from intra-day repeatability were used as Day 1 slides for
inter-day intermediate precision.
The studies were required to demonstrate the same clinical CD30 positive/negative
status with 85% concordance of the 95% lower bound CI using the recommended
staining protocol. Results summarized in Table 2 show PPA and NPA were at least
88% for the 95% lower bound confidence interval. Data were analyzed for
morphology acceptability, background acceptability, and intra-day repeatability and
inter-day precision by case-level CD30 (Ber-H2) status concordance.

Inter-Reader/Intra-Reader Precision Study
A study was conducted to assess precision between readers and within readers using
50 lymphoma cases including 6 borderline cases. Slides were blinded and randomized
and read by three pathologists. After a four week washout period, the slides were read
by the same pathologists again. Results in Table 3 for intra-reader and Table 4 for
inter-reader agreement below show both APA and ANA were 98.7%, thus surpassing
the acceptance criteria of >85%.

Inter-laboratory Reproducibility Study
A multi-site reproducibility study was conducted to assess reproducibility of the assay
for determining CD30 status at 3 external sites with 2 readers each. The study was
carried out over 5 non-consecutive days using 24 deidentified formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens. Specimens included both MTCL and CTCL
and spanned a range of staining with 4 borderline cases. Prior to staining, slides were
blinded and randomized. The performance of the VENTANA CD30 (Ber-H2) Assay
was to be considered acceptable if both the PPA and NPA rates across all
observations met or exceeded 85% for the lower bound of the 95% confidence

Tissue thickness was evaluated using human lymphoma tissue. Tissues were
sectioned and tested in duplicate at 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 microns. Tissue thicknesses of 4
microns demonstrated appropriate specific staining for CD30 and appropriate
background levels with VENTANA CD30 (Ber-H2) Assay. Tissue thicknesses cut at
3 microns did have a difference in CD30 status when compared to the 4 to 7 µm
sections for one case. Additional cases cut from 3 to 7 microns did not have any
change in clinical interpretation; however, it was noted that at thicknesses of ≥ 5
microns the background increased causing neoplastic cells to become more difficult
to identify. Ventana recommends that specimens be cut at 4 microns for the assay

All three production lots passed the acceptance criteria. Open Vial and On-Board
Stability have been completed for all three lots, and these data satisfy regional
requirements for open vial and on-board stability. The real time and ship stress
stability data demonstrate that VENTANA CD30 (Ber-H2) Assay Mouse Monoclonal
Primary Antibody is stable for 12 months at the intended use storage of 2-8ºC.
Cut Slide Stability
This study was carried out to evaluate the changes in CD30 antigenicity in lymphoma
tissue sectioned on positively charged microscope slides after storage at two
temperatures, 2-8° and 30°C. Two qualified multi-tissue blocks (MTBs) were
sectioned at Day 0 (up to approximately 100 sections) and the slides were stored at 2-
8°C and 30°C. Slides were read by three readers using two instruments. Testing
established day 0 baseline staining and interpretation of the lymphoma cases.
Subsequent testing was compared to the baseline staining until loss of specific
staining was reached. All three readers noted a decrease in staining intensity for slides
stored at 2-8°C at the month 2 time point for tissue 2 while the 30°C storage
condition passed up to month 6 for MTB D. Therefore the recommended maximum
storage time for cut unstained lymphoma slides using the VENTANA CD30 (Ber-H2)
Assay is 1 month for slides stored at 2-8oC and 5 months for slides stored at 30 oC.
Controls
A negative antibody reagent control is used with used with the assay. Positive and
negative control slides should be stained with each staning run.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
A peptide inhibition study was conducted by incubating a specific peptide for the
CD30 epitope or a nonspecific peptide with a Hodgkin lymphoma specimen. Results
show the specific peptide reduced CD30 staining consistent with a reduction in the
CD30 antibody titer, whereas the nonspecific peptide did not reduce CD30 staining
caused by the Ber-H2 antibody. It was noted that the CD30 statining was not
completely eliminated by the specific peptide. To address this issue specificity of the
assay was evaluated by demonstrating binding of the Ber-H2 antibody to CD30 in
Western Blots. The antibody recognized endogenous CD30 in whole cell lysates from
HH and AT cell lines but did not bind proteins in SKMel5 cell line which does not
express CD30. The Ber-H2 antibody also specifically recognized recombinant CD30
protein but not recombinant FGF19. The staining in the two cell lines expressing
CD30 showed a reactivity pattern to the expected molecular weight as well as weaker
signal for breakdown products of CD30 protein.
f. Assay cut-off:
For HL and ALCL any percent positivity (≥1%) was counted toward positivity.

for CD30 as shown in Table 7. Of the neoplastic tissues, 3 exhibited CD30
expression, including: seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma, as
shown in Table 8.
Analytical sensitivity of the VENTANA CD30 (Ber-H2) Assay was tested on 1378
lymphoma model tissues. The 1378 lymphoma model tissues consisted of 97 CTCL
cases, 35 Mature T-Cell Lymphoma (MTCL, also referred to as Peripheral T Cell
Lymphoma (PTCL)) cases, 1120 DLBCL cases, 40 ALCL cases, and 86 HL cases.
When any staining was observed (≥1% for CD30 staining), the prevalence for ALCL
was found to be 97.5% (39/40) and for HL was found to be 100% (86/86).
Table 7. Specificity of VENTANA CD30 (Ber-H2) Assay was determined by
testing formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal tissues.
