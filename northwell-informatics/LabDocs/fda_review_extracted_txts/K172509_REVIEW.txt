K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): Not Applicable
L. Test Principle:
The Sentosa SA201 HSV-1/2 PCR Test (4x24) contains reagents and enzymes for specific
amplification of a 104 bp fragment of UL30 gene common to both HSV-1 and HSV-2, and
specific probes for the direct detection and differentiation of HSV-1 and HSV-2 amplicons,
respectively. Pathogen detection by PCR is based on the amplification of specific regions
of the pathogen genome. In real-time PCR, the amplified product is detected via fluorescent
dyes, which are usually linked to oligonucleotide probes that bind specifically to the target
sequences. Real-time monitoring of the fluorescence intensities during a PCR run allows the
detection of the accumulating product. Amplification of the targets occurs in three channels:
green, orange and red on the Sentosa SA201. Output is recorded as the increase of fluorescence
over time in comparison to background signal. Monitoring the fluorescence intensities during
the PCR run allows the detection of the accumulating product without having to re-open the
reaction tubes after the PCR run.
Sample Preparation
HSV-1/2 nucleic acids are extracted from swabs in universal virus transport medium (UTM)
automatically using the Sentosa SX101 instrument. Briefly, the samples are collected in 1.5 mL
Sentosa SX Safe-Lock Tubes and loaded onto the Sentosa SX101 worktable together with
relevant reagents from Sentosa SX Virus Total Nucleic Acid Kit v2.0 for extraction. Using the
instrument, the samples are automatically lysed to release the nucleic acids which are then washed
and eluted in the Sentosa SA 96-Well Optical Plate. PCR set-up is subsequently performed.
Reagent Preparation
The Sentosa SA201 HSV-1/2 PCR Test comprises reagents required for PCR amplification. The
reagent tubes are loaded onto the Sentosa SX101 worktable and the Sentosa SX101 instrument
automatically combines the reagents. The resultant master mix is subsequently dispensed into the
Sentosa SA 96-Well Optical Plate where it is mixed with the eluted nucleic acids.

Amplification
PCR is performed using the Sentosa SA201 instrument. The recombinant DNA polymerase in
DNA4 M2 and primers in HSV-1/2 Qual M1 of the Sentosa SA201 HSV-1/2 PCR Test are used
to amplify the target DNA sequence. The first step of PCR amplification is the denaturation and
separation of the double stranded DNA at high temperature. The second step involves the
annealing of the specific primers to the targeted site on the single stranded DNA. This is followed
by the third step where extension of the primers/DNA synthesis occurs with the DNA polymerase.
These steps occur during each cycle of the PCR amplification and multiple cycles will increase
the amplified PCR products exponentially.
Detection
The Sentosa SA201 instrument detects the amplified products via fluorophore emission. In real-
time PCR, the amplified product is detected via fluorescent dyes, which are conjugated to
oligonucleotide probes that bind specifically to the target sequences.
The fluorophore is released during PCR amplification when the probe binds to the complementary
sequence of the target and gets hydrolyzed and released. PCR product is detected accordingly
from the free probes. Amplification of the targets occurs in three channels: green (HSV-1), orange
(HSV-2) and red (extraction control, EC) on Sentosa SA201 Real-Time PCR instrument. Output
is recorded as the increase of fluorescence over time relative to background signal.
Real-time monitoring of the fluorescence intensities during a PCR run allows the detection of the
accumulating product. Monitoring the fluorescence intensities during the PCR run at each cycle
allows the detection of the accumulating product without having to re-open the reaction tubes
after the PCR run.
Sentosa SA201 HSV-1/2 PCR Test workflow
The Sentosa SA201 HSV-1/2 PCR Test workflow starts with extraction of nucleic acids from
samples (genital or oral swabs) using the Sentosa SX Virus Total Nucleic Acid Kit on the
Sentosa SX101 instrument. Following extraction, the instrument will automatically set up the
PCR with the extracted nucleic acids in a 96-well PCR plate. Subsequently, the 96-well PCR
plate is sealed and transferred to the Sentosa SA201 for PCR amplification, followed by data
analysis.
Drivers are installed on the Sentosa Link to connect the Sentosa SX101 instrument and
the Sentosa SA201 thermocycler. This creates a user environment that links the SX101
and the Sentosa SA201 to facilitate automated workflow to export results in a LIS/LIMS-
compatible format.
The Sentosa SA201 HSV-1/2 PCR Test uses the Sentosa SX101 hardware and Sentosa SA201
hardware, along with the associated consumables to operate as an automated sample
extraction, PCR setup, amplification and reporting system as shown in the figures below.

Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of Sentosa SA201 HSV-1/2 PCR Test was assessed using a seven-
precision panel consisting of the assay negative control, assay positive control
and 2 strains of HSV: HSV-1 MacIntyre and HSV-2 Strain G, diluted in
universal viral transport medium. Other than the controls, panel members were
formulated with a single HSV strain present (HSV-1 or HSV-2) at two
concentrations; Positive (3x LoD) and Low Positive (1.5 x LoD). A seventh panel
member labeled Negative (universal viral transport medium) was prepared using the
universal viral transport medium only. The data were used to determine the mean Ct,
standard deviation (SD) and the coefficient of variation (% CV) for each target and
the extraction control.
For the within-laboratory precision study, the seven-member panel was tested in
replicates of three, four runs per day for a total of five days. The tests were
conducted by five alternating operators using three Sentosa SX101, four Sentosa
SA201 and three Sentosa SA201 HSV-1/2 PCR Test lots.

Reproducibility:
For site-to-site reproducibility, the reproducibility test panel samples were tested in
replicates of three, two runs per day by two operators for a total of five days in
three clinical sites in the USA. Each clinical site used one Sentosa SX101, one
Sentosa SA201, one unique lot of Sentosa SA201 HSV-1/2 PCR Test and one unique
lot of Sentosa SX Virus Total Nucleic Acid kit. Thus the reproducibility study tested
three different lots of assay and extraction kits. The results are summarized in the

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Positive Control (PC): The PC supplied in a tube is placed into the Sentosa SX101
sample rack during the workflow run. It consists of two linearized plasmids with
sequences for HSV-1 and HSV-2 detection by primers and probes in the Sentosa
SA201 HSV-1/2 goes through extraction and PCR setup as any sample in the run.
Thus, it also monitors for instrument/workflow issues, such as inhibition or pipetting
errors due to instrument/workflow failure.
Negative Control (NC): The NC is nucleic acid-free water supplied in a tube that is
placed into the Sentosa SX101 sample rack during the workflow run. It can monitor
for substantial PCR reagent failure since the NC goes through extraction and PCR
setup as any sample in the run. Thus, it also monitors for instrument/workflow issues,
such as reagent and/or environmental contamination or pipetting errors due to
instrument/workflow failure.
Extraction Control (EC): The EC supplied in a tube is placed into the Sentosa SX101
during the workflow run. It consists of one linearized plasmid with sequence for an
unrelated tobacco mosaic virus that is detected by EC primers and probe in the

d. Detection limit:
(i) A Limit of Detection (LoD) study was performed to evaluate the analytical
sensitivity of the Sentosa SA201 HSV-1/2 PCR Test using two representative strains
of HSV-1 (McIntyre & KOS) and two representative strains of HSV-2 (MS & G).
The study included serial dilutions of quantified viral cultures of HSV-1 MacIntyre,
HSV-1 KOS, HSV-2 MS, and HSV-2 G. and the preliminary LoD was determined.
The LoD for each strains was confirmed by testing at a level within the LoD range
with 20 replicates. The LoD analytical sensitivity study was conducted over a
period of five (5) days with three (3) reagent lots, four (4) operators and four (4)
instrument systems. The LoD for each strain was determined using probit analysis.
The LoD (with equal or more than 95% positive detection rate) for HSV-1 was 40
TCID /mL and for HSV-2 was 4 TCID /mL, and the LoB (with equal or less
50 50
than 5% positive detection rate) for HSV-1 was 0.81 TCID /mL and for HSV-2
50
was 0.04 TCID /mL. The final LoDs are presented in the table below.

(ii) The analytical reactivity of the Sentosa SA201 HSV-1/2 PCR Test was assessed to
determined whether the test could detect a diverse range of HSV-1 and HSV-2 strains.
A total of 40 clinical isolates (20 HSV-1 and 20 HSV-2) were collected from
male and female genital and oral lesions from different locations that were

all 40 strains tested at 1x LoD.
e. Analytical specificity/Coss-reactivity:
A panel of microorganism that may be present in patient specimens was tested to
determined whether these microorganisms interfered with the detection of HSV-1 or
HSV-2 or were cross-reactive with the Sentosa SA201 HSV-1/2 Qualitative PCR
Test. Organisms were tested at a target concentration of approximately 1 x 106
CFU/mL for bacteria and fungi or 1 x 105 TCID /mL for viruses in the absence and

2 MS. None of the potential interfering organisms cross-reacted or interfered with the
detection of any of the HSV strains by the Sentosa SA201 HSV-1/2 PCR Test. In
addition, there was no cross-reactivity within the multiplex panel (HSV-1 and HSV-
2) in the presence of high concentration of HSV-1 or HSV-2.

g. Cross-contamination and carryover-contamination
The Cross-contamination and Carry-over studies were assessed to evaluate the potential
cross-contamination during extraction and on subsequent runs on the performance of the
Sentosa SA201 HSV1/2 Test with the Sentosa SX101 workflow instrument. The carry-
over and cross-contamination studies were conducted over a period of four (4) days with
one (1) reagent lot, two (2) operators, and two (2) Sentosa workflow systems. The test
materials used in the study included negative samples and 1x10^5 TCID /mL HSV1
50
(2500xLoD) for the cross-contamination study, a NC, a PC, and negative samples for the
carry-over contamination study. Three (3) run matrices were used, two (2) for the cross–
contamination study and one (1) for the carry-over contamination study. The results
showed that there was no contamination. All 96 positive samples were detected as
positive, and the 183 negative samples were detected as negative (no amplification signal
noted).
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The clinical performance evaluation was performed against a gold standard/reference
method i.e., Cell Culture using an enzyme linked virus inducible system with HSV
typing by fluorescently labeled antibodies.
b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The performance of the Sentosa SA201 HSV-1/2 PCR Test was compared with the
ELVIS HSV ID/Typing Test System (Diagnostic Hybrid, Inc.) which is a gold
standard/reference method i.e., Cell Culture using an enzyme linked virus inducible
system with HSV typing by fluorescently labeled antibodies.
Clinical Performance:
A total of 2684 samples were collected throughout the study from eight sample
collection sites in the United States from 2016 – 2017 and then tested at four locations
in the United States to evaluate the performance of the Sentosa SA201 HSV-1/2 PCR

Test. Concurrently the samples were tested by the reference method (ELVIS HSV ID
and D3 Typing Test System) for performance comparison. A total of 389 samples
were excluded due to no/invalid ELVIS/Sentosa SA201 HSV-1/2 PCR Test results,
wrong lesion type and various administrative errors.
Of the 2295 valid samples, 1978 were anogenital lesions and 317 were oral lesions.
In the ELVIS reference test, a sample that was HSV-2 positive could not be used to
type for HSV-1. Thus, the total number of HSV-2 positive samples is deducted
from the total sample number for HSV-1 analysis.
Three hundred and ninety seven (397) anogenital prospective specimens identified as
HSV-2 positive by ELVIS viral culture were removed from the initial 1978
anogenital specimens for the calculation of the HSV-1 clinical performance. Due to
low prevalence of HSV-2 in oral specimens, only three (3) oral specimens identified
as HSV-2 positive by ELVIS viral culture were removed from the initial 317 oral
specimens for the calculation of the HSV-1 clinical performance.
Results from the prospective studies are presented in the tables below.

The sponsor states: Refer to the Sentosa SA201 HSV-1/2 PCR Test User Manual for
detailed operating procedures for the test. For detailed information on software and
instrument operations, refer to the Sentosa SX101 User Manual, Sentosa Link User
Manual and the Sentosa SA201 Real-Time PCR Instrument Reference Guide for detailed
procedures.
3. Specimen Identification:
Patient ID/Sample ID is labeled with a unique barcode, which is tracked by using the
Sentosa Link software to prevent re-use and track positive sample identification.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Not Applicable
5. Calibration:
The Sentosa SA201 Real-Time PCR Instrument undergoes a single calibration during
manufacturing. No additional calibration is performed by the ende use.
6. Quality Control:
The extraction control (EC) consists of one linearized plasmid with sequence for an
unrelated tobacco mosaic virus that is detected by EC primers and probe in the Sentosa
SA201 HSV-1/2 PCR Test reagents. The EC is added to the lysis buffer, which is used in
the extraction of all samples, NC and PC before PCR setup. Thus EC monitors for sample
extraction failure or and/or inhibition, and also instrument/workflow issues, such as
inhibition or pipetting errors due to instrument/workflow failure.
Two controls are provided by Vela to the user in the Sentosa SA201 HSV-1/2 PCR Test:
a tube of negative control (NC) and a tube of positive control (PC) that undergo the full
sample workflow, enabling monitoring of the performance of the assay.
The NC is nucleic acid-free water supplied in a tube that is placed into the Sentosa
SX101 sample rack during the workflow run. The NC will monitor instrument or
workflow issues, such as reagent and/or environmental contamination, as the presence of
HSV-1 and / or HSV-2 DNA will not be detected in the negative control (NC).
The positive control (PC) consists of DNA target sequences for HSV-1 and HSV-2
detection by primers and probes in the Sentosa SA201 HSV-1/2 PCR Test (4x24). It can
monitor substantial PCR reagent failure since the PC goes through extraction and PCR
set-up, alike any sample in the run. It will also monitor instrument / workflow issues,
such as inhibition or pipetting errors due to instrument/workflow failure.
Run Validity Criteria:
Run: Whole run on the Sentosa SA 96-Well Optical Plate
Sample: Single sample in one well of Sentosa SA 96-Well Optical Plate

· The software automatically determines run validity and sample result. The software
will invalidate a run if either or both controls (negative and positive) have invalid
results based on the table in Ct value ranges.
· A run may be invalidated by an operator if technical, operator, or instrument
difficulties are observed and documented while performing the assay.
· An invalid run must be repeated.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
The software documentation was reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor provided
documentation to support that the device was designed , developed, and maintained under
appropriate software lifecycle processes.
