H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Trak Male Fertility Testing System is intended for semi-quantitative assessment of
sperm concentration at 15 million sperm per milliliter (M/mL) or below, between 15 and
55 M/mL, and above 55 M/mL. It also provides a qualitative assessment of semen
volume.
Sperm concentration and semen volume are only two factors that could impact a man's
fertility status and time to pregnancy. For complete assessment of male reproductive
health, the user should consult a physician. For in vitro, over the counter home use.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For over-the-counter (OTC) use
4. Special instrument requirements:
The Trak Male Fertility Testing System (Trak) includes a small instrument, the Engine. It
spins a test Prop to compact sperm cells within an introduced semen sample into a visible
column.
I. Device Description:
The Trak Male Fertility Testing System (Trak) includes: (1) small instrument (the Engine),
(2) AA batteries for the engine, (4) disposable units in which liquefied semen is introduced
and where the sperm concentration is interpreted (the Prop), (4) volume cups with lids, (8)
sample droppers, (1) bottle of control solution A, and (8) “seal before spin” stickers.
The volume cup is a single-use disposable collection cup with an integrated volume
measurement feature. The volume cup contains a small measurement column with markings
incorporated into the outer surface, two channels to collect and drain the semen sample into
the measurement region, and a sloped surface that funnels captured semen into the column
and channels. Once the semen is liquefied the volume cup is used to qualitatively assess the
semen volume: low semen volume (≤ 1.5 mL) or normal semen volume (>1.5 mL).

processing of human semen, 5th Ed. Geneva: WHO Press

Guideline - Second Edition
L. Test Principle:
The Trak volume cups are used to collect, liquefy, and assess the volume of the semen
sample. The volume cups are coated with a digestive enzyme to liquefy the semen sample
and reduce viscosity. Markings on the volume cup allow for the qualitative interpretation of
volume at, below, or above the 1.5 mL threshold.
To estimate the sperm concentration the Trak uses the principle of density gradient
separation to isolate sperm cells from human semen. The Trak Engine spins a test Prop to
compact sperm cells within an introduced semen sample into a visible column (or “pellet”).
The Prop gives a defined shape to the column, the height of which corresponds to the
concentration of sperm cells in the sample. Since semen may also contain cell debris,
immature sperm cells, and other contaminant particulates that could contribute to the
apparent size of a pellet, it is necessary to filter out the contaminants. Trak filters by
removing contaminants from view based on density across a predefined liquid density
medium.
During operation, approximately 0.17 mL of semen is metered by centrifugal action from
the sample inlet into the metering chamber of the Prop. During rotation, the semen floats on
“top” of the pre-loaded density medium. Sperm cells pass through the medium due to their
high density while contaminants remain floating on the medium. When the spin sequence is
complete, the sperm cells form a visible column that is displayed to the user for
interpretation. Contaminants that are less dense than the liquid density medium are
suspended “above” the medium, substantially separated from the sperm cells and are
generally too diffuse to visualize.

Shelf Life
A shelf-life stability study was conducted using two lots of volume cups with a total
of 8 time points (1 day, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 15
months and 18 months) to assess the enzymatic activity of protein used to coat the
volume cup. The enzyme activity was tested by using solidified gelatin. The data
provided support that the enzyme activity is acceptable up to 15 months. Stability
testing is still ongoing; therefore, the shelf-life stability of the volume cup is 12
months.

Consumer Use Study:
Two studies were performed to demonstrate that the 1.5 mL reference marking on the
new volume cup are interpreted correctly by lay users. Study 1 was to demonstrate

the accuracy of semen volume in the new volume cup as interpreted by the intended
users using semen sample photographs and study 2 was to assess interpretation and
ease of use of the physical volume cup filled with known volumes of artificial semen
as interpreted by the intended users.
Study 1: Semen samples were collected by consenting donors, weighed and converted
to volume as recommended in the WHO semen analysis manual, 5th edition, then
photographed. The photographs were used to challenge both technicians and lay
users. Demographics of the lay users include (n=52, male (57.7%) and female
(42.3%), age range 18.0–68.0, 44.2% Caucasian, 25% Asian, 13.5% Latino/Hispanic,
3.8% Black or African American and 15.3% other and varying levels of education,
40.4% some college, 23.1% 4-year degree (bachelor’s), 23.1% high school, 7.7% post
graduate). A total of 232 semen sample photographs were interpreted as ≤ 1.5 mL or
> 1.5 mL by lay users as well as trained technicians (blinded to the results), and were
confirmed with the result obtained by the reference method.

Lay User Questionnaire Results:
After completing the volume cup reader study, lay users (n=32) also completed a
Tester Questionnaire with 11 multiple choice questions. Five of the questions were
designed to capture the user’s perceptions of ease of use of the Trak device, and the
remaining six questions were to gauge interpretation and understandability of the
instructions. While slightly more than a quarter of the respondents assigned
“somewhat difficult” or “difficult” to the task of finding the liquid level, more than
95% of the responses for interpreting cups were assigned correctly with respect to
the reference method. Additionally, 90.6% of users gave answers indicating an
understanding of the instructions according to the intended interpretation.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Semen Liquefaction
The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of new volume cup in
promoting semen liquefaction. A total of 20 semen sample aliquots from three semen
samples were tested for liquefaction by measuring the volume of semen dispensed by the
transfer devices included with the Trak System (250 µL exact volume pipettes) after
incubation according to the instructions for use. The total average for these volume
measures was 253.05 μL, with a 95% CI of 249.60–256.00 μL, meeting the acceptance
criteria for liquefaction from the volume cups.
Trak Sperm Concentration
The objective of this study was to determine whether samples incubated in the new
volume cup give equivalent Trak category results to samples incubated in the collection
cup included with the predicate device. Two sperm concentrations 10 M/mL and 20
M/mL of the WHO threshold cutoff (15 M/mL) were tested in 20 replicates for each cup
type on Trak Props, and results were categorized as ≤15 M/mL (Low), 15–55 M/mL
(Moderate), and > 55 M/mL (Optimal). Sperm concentrations were confirmed by CASA,
and then aliquots of the pooled semen samples were incubated in the new volume cups

--- Page 10 ---
and in the previous collection cups.

Concentration #1, volume cup 11.7 20 0 0
Concentration #2, control 20.7 0 20 0
Concentration #2, volume cup 19.7 0 20 0
Trak results for both the new volume cup and the collection cup with the predicate
device were correctly categorized with respect to the reference method. Results from
this study met the defined acceptance criteria.
Semen Homogenization
The objective of this study was to determine whether sperm concentration is evenly
distributed within the new volume cup compared to the previous collection cup with
the predicate device when agitated. Semen samples were pooled and diluted to two
sperm concentrations differing by more than 50%. Sperm concentrations were
evaluated by CASA using multiple aliquots of the pooled semen samples after
incubation in the new volume cups and in the previous collection cups. Twenty (20)
aliquots were taken from the top and bottom of each cup for each pool, and its sperm
concentration was accessed.

to the previous collection cup.
