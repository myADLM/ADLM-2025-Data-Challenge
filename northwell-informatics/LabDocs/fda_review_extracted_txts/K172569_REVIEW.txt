I. Device Description:
The GenePOC CDiff assay is a single-use test for the qualitative detection of the toxin B
(tcdB) gene of toxigenic C. difficile in unformed (liquid or soft) stool specimens. The
GenePOC CDiff assay kit is comprised of the disposable CDiff microfluidic cartridges (PIE),
Disposable Transfer Loops (DTL), Sample Buffer Tubes (SBT), and individual pouches of
the following materials: Disposable Transfer Tools (DTT), Sample Buffer Tube (SBT) and
CDiff PIE. These components are used to suspend the sample, extract, amplify, and detect C.
difficile nucleic acid. A Process Control (PrC) is also incorporated into each PIE to verify
sample processing and amplification steps. The PrC allows for the verification of potential
inhibitor substances as well as microfluidic, instrument or reagent failure. The GenePOC
CDiff assay is designed to be used on the revogene. The revogene is an instrument that
automates sample homogenization, sample dilution, cells lysis, DNA amplification and
detection of the amplified PCR products.
Each GenePOC CDiff assay kit provides components for 24 tests. User intervention is
required for sample preparation, transferring the stool specimen with the DTL into the SBT,
using the DTT to transfer the sample into the CDiff PIE, and loading/unloading the PIE into
the revogene carousel. Each PIE is a completely integrated closed device in which a sample
is dispensed and processed through different microfluidic chambers and channels that allow
for the sample processing and subsequent real-time PCR steps.
Upon completion of a run, the results are computed by the revogene from measured
fluorescent signals and embedded calculation algorithms. The output results include positive,
negative, indeterminate, and unresolved. Upon completion of a run, the user removes the
used cartridges and disposes of them in normal biological waste. Results may be viewed,

L. Test Principle:
The GenePOC revogene automates and integrates nucleic acid extraction and amplification,
and detection of the target sequence in complex samples using real-time PCR. A liquid or
soft stool specimen is collected using a standard stool collection device. Using the DTL, a
disposable 5μL inoculating loop dipped into the stool specimen, stool material is transferred
into SBT. After vortexing, approximately 150 μL of the inoculated sample buffer is
transferred into the GenePOC microfluidic cartridge using the DTT. The loaded CDiff

cartridge is placed into the revogene for further sample processing. No operator intervention
is necessary once the clinical sample is loaded onto the revogene.
Each CDiff microfluidic cartridge (PIE) is a completely integrated and self-contained device.
Each sample is sequentially transferred by centrifugation from one microfluidic chamber to
the next and all reagents specific for the PCR reaction are incorporated and dried within the
PCR wells. The stepwise process includes sample homogenization, specimen dilution, and
lysis of cells followed by the subsequent real-time PCR steps within one PCR well in the
cartridge. An internal Process Control (PrC) is contained in the homogenization chamber and
is therefore present in every test to verify critical steps of the analytical process (including
sample homogenization, dilution, sample lysis, and nucleic acid amplification and detection)
for the presence of potential inhibitory substances as well as system or reagent failures. The
amplified products are detected in real time using target-specific TaqMan chemistry-based
probes. The CDiff specific designed primers and probe detect a target region of 262 base
pairs (bp) of the toxin B gene (tcdB) of C. difficile. The results are computed by the system
from measured fluorescent signals and embedded calculation algorithms. Results may be
viewed, printed, transferred, and/or stored by the user.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Single site and multi-site precision studies were conducted to determine Between-
Laboratory Reproducibility, Between-Lot Reproducibility, and Within-Laboratory
Precision.
Between-Site Reproducibility:
Between-site reproducibility study was performed at three sites, by two operators per
site, over five distinct days using one CDiff assay kit lot. A total of 120 negative
sample replicates and 90 positive sample replicates were tested for each strain and
concentration. Two toxigenic C. difficile strains were tested: ATCC 43255
(toxinotype 0, ribotype 087) and ATCC BAA-1805 (toxinotype IIIb, NAP1/ribotype
027).
A five-member panel was contrived using a pool of C. difficile-negative stool matrix
at the following target concentrations:
· Low positive (LP) at 1X to < 2X LoD
· Moderate positive (MP) at ≥ 2X to 3X LoD
· True negative (TN) samples without toxigenic C. difficile
The LP concentrations tested were 2,438 CFU/mL and 2,925 CFU/mL of SB for
ATCC 43255 and ATCC BAA-1805, respectively. The MP concentrations tested
were 3,750 and 4,500 CFU/mL of SB for ATCC 43255 and ATCC BAA-1805,
respectively.
For the between-site reproducibility, the overall percent agreement was 100% for TN,

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The GenePOC CDiff assay uses three types of controls: an internal process control
(PrC), a positive external control (PEC), and negative external control (NEC). The
PrC is included in each CDiff PIE cartridge. The PrC is extracted, amplified, and
detected along with each specimen tested, and it verifies the efficacy of the dilution,
cell lysis, PCR amplification, and detection processes.
Quality control procedures monitor the accuracy and precision of the analytical
process. Each laboratory must establish the number, type and frequency of testing
control materials per applicable regulations or accrediting agencies. It is
recommended that one PEC and one NEC should be run at least daily until adequate
process validation is achieved with the CDiff assay on the revogene in each
laboratory setting.
External Control materials are not provided by GenePOC. External Controls are not
used by the revogene software for the purpose of sample test result interpretation. The
PEC monitors for substantial reagent failure, and the NEC monitors for
environmental contamination or carryover. External Controls are treated as if they are
specimens.
For the PEC and NEC, GenePOC recommends using commercially available control
materials (e.g., ATCC 43255, a C. difficile strain bearing the tcdB gene can be used
for the PEC, and ATCC 43593, a non- toxigenic C. difficile strain can be used for the

NEC). It is recommended that the positive bacterial strain be freshly prepared in
saline to a turbidity of 0.5 McFarland from isolated colonies and subsequently diluted
½ in saline before its addition into the SBT with the DTL. The negative strain can be
prepared similarly while added directly to the SBT without the dilution step.
Alternatively, a previously characterized stool specimens positive or negative for
toxigenic C. difficile could also be used as the PEC and NEC, respectively.
One PEC and one NEC were processed each day of analytical and clinical testing and
with the use of each new PIE kit lot. Of the total 403 external controls that were run
across all sites in the clinical study, 391 (97.0%) were valid, nine (2.2%) failed due to
non-reportable results, and three (0.7%) failed due to false results.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity (Limit of Detection or LoD) of the CDiff assay was
determined using negative stool matrix previously spiked with various concentrations
of toxigenic C. difficile bacterial suspensions. The testing to establish and confirm the
LoD included three GenePOC CDiff reagent lots, six revogene instruments, and two
operators. There were four runs per instrument per day, and the confirmation study
was conducted over four days. Two strains of toxigenic C. difficile (ATCC 43255,
Ribotype 087, Toxinotype 0, and ATCC BAA-1805, NAP 1, Ribotype 027,
Toxinotype IIIb) were tested in 24 replicates per concentration in the confirmation
study. The LoD was defined as the lowest concentration at which 95% or more of all
replicates tested positive. The LoD was determined at 1,500 CFU/mL of SB for both
strains.
Analytical inclusivity (reactivity):
The analytical inclusivity of the GenePOC CDiff assay was evaluated by testing 20
strains of toxigenic C. difficile from various geographic origins representing eight
different toxinotypes. Quantitated cultures of each C. difficile strain were diluted in
negative stool matrix, and three replicates per strain were tested using three different
CDiff kit lots. All strains were detected at 3,750 CFU/mL of SB (2-3xLOD). The
results are summarized in Table 4.
In addition, an in silico analysis was performed to assess inclusivity of the primers and
probe of the CDiff assay target for 52 toxigenic C. difficile strains listed in the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. The alignment
results showed no mismatch with the selected 52 sequences. The analysis predicted the
detection of these toxigenic C. difficile strains.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity:
The cross-reactivity of the CDiff assay was assessed by testing high concentrations of
58 non-targeted organisms (50 bacteria, one yeast, seven viruses) and DNA
preparations that may be found in unformed stool specimens (see Table 5, Table 6,
and Table 7) . The test panel included commensal and pathogenic microorganisms
from the intestinal tract, species phylogenetically related to C. difficile, non-
pathogenic strains of C. difficile; and human DNA. Bacteria and yeast were tested at a
load of ≥106 CFU/mL of SB. Nucleic acids from viruses and human DNA were tested
at a load of ≥105 DNA or RNA copies/mL of SB. The test panel was contrived by
spiking quantitated cell cultures or nucleic acid solutions in a C. difficile-negative
liquid stool matrix. Each organism was tested in triplicate.
Under the conditions of the study, Clostridium sordellii gave a false positive result by
the CDiff assay for one replicate out of three at 106 CFU/mL of SB, but no false
positives were observed when an additional three replicates were tested at 105

Microbial Interference
A microbial interference study was conducted to assess the potential inhibitory effect
of 30 non-targeted microorganisms (27 bacteria, one yeast and two viruses) that may
be found in stool specimens (Table 8). Microorganisms were selected from the cross
reactivity panel. Pools of two to six organisms were prepared in negative liquid stool
matrix and tested in four replicates each in the presence or absence of two toxigenic
C. difficile strains (ATCC 43255 and ATCC BAA-1805). The potentially interfering
organisms were spiked at ≥106 CFU/mL of SB for bacteria and yeast and at ≥105
cp/mL of SB for viruses. Toxigenic C. difficile strains were spiked at 2-3X LoD
(ATCC 43255 at 3,750 CFU/mL of SB, and ATCC BAA-1805 at 4,500 CFU/mL of
SB). When potential interference was observed with pooled organisms, additional
replicates of the organisms were tested individually at the same spiked concentration.
No interference was observed with the GenePOC CDiff assay for the detection of C.
difficile strain ATCC BAA-1805, and no interference was observed for the detection
of the assay PrC.
Pool 3 and pool 5 showed potentially inhibitory effects on the detection of the
toxigenic C. difficile strain ATCC 43255 for one replicate out of four and two
replicates out of four, respectively. When each of the bacteria from these pools were
tested individually in duplicate at the same spiked concentration, no interference was
observed for the detection of either toxigenic C. difficile strain or for the PrC.

Interfering Substances
An interfering substances study was conducted to assess the potentially inhibitory
effects of 16 exogenous (Table 9) and five endogenous substances (Table 10) that
may be present in stool specimens. The substances were tested in the presence or
absence of two strains of toxigenic C. difficile (ATCC 43255 and ATCC BAA-1805)
in negative stool matrix in SBTs. Substances were spiked at their high concentrations
expected in stool specimens, and C. difficile strains were spiked at 2-3X LoD (ATCC
43255 at 3,750 CFU/mL of SB, and ATCC BAA-1805 at 4,500 CFU/mL of SB).
Calcium carbonate (e.g. Tums) and aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide (e.g.
Stomaax) showed a potentially inhibitory effect on the detection of toxigenic C.

Carry-Over and Cross-Contamination
Carry-over and cross-contamination were evaluated by running two studies using
three different revogene instruments: two instruments were utilized for the carry-over
study and one instrument was used for the cross-contamination study. Ten runs were
performed for each study without cleaning between runs. Each study tested high
positive (≥ 107 CFU/mL of SB) toxigenic C. difficile and negative samples contrived
in stool matrix.
For the within-run cross-contamination study, four replicates of high positive samples
were alternated with four negative samples in each run, and the positions were
alternated between each run (n=40 replicates each sample). For the between-run
carry-over study, a run of eight replicates of high positive samples was followed by a
run of eight negative samples over five iterations for a total of ten runs (n=40
replicates each sample). No evidence of amplicon carry-over or sample cross
contamination was observed.
Specimen stability
Specimen stability was evaluated within the context of the clinical studies, and it was
also assessed analytically by testing pre-characterized positive and negative clinical
samples under different storage time and temperature conditions. The results
supported the stool specimen storage instructions described in the package insert.
Stool specimens can be stored at 25°C for up to two days, or at 2-8°C for up to four
days. Inoculated SBT can be stored at 25°C for up to two days, or at 2-8°C for up to
three days.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off was established by testing and analyzing clinical stool samples that
were known to be positive or negative for toxigenic C. difficile. The cut-off was
confirmed by the analysis of the results from the limit of detection and prospective
clinical studies.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The clinical performance of the GenePOC CDiff assay was established in a
prospective multi-site investigation conducted at seven geographically diverse sites
across the US (five sites) and Canada (two sites) in comparison with a combined
direct and broth enriched culture method for toxigenic C. difficile. Leftover, de-
identified, unformed (liquid or soft) stool specimens were collected from
symptomatic subjects suspected of CDI.
Two sets of specimens were evaluated. One specimen set was prospectively collected
and tested fresh at six sites with the GenePOC CDiff assay. A second specimen set
consisted of specimens that had been prospectively collected in a previous trial and
stored frozen prior to testing. Frozen specimens were distributed to three sites for
testing with the GenePOC CDiff assay. The reference culture method was performed
for each freshly collected specimen (prior to any specimen freezing) at a central
reference laboratory.
Specimens that met the study inclusion criteria and that did not meet any of the
exclusion criteria were enrolled. A total of 863 fresh specimens and 1718 frozen
specimens were initially collected. Of these, 798 fresh specimens and 1665 frozen
specimens were eligible for enrollment. Of the eligible specimens, 797 fresh and 1664
frozen specimens had valid results for direct toxigenic culture, broth enriched
toxigenic culture, and the GenePOC CDiff assay. These specimens were included in
the performance calculations. The population demographics for both specimen sets
are described in Table 11.

specimen and PCR level according to the study protocol, 12 and 28 were respectively
reported indeterminate at initial testing (1.5% for the fresh specimens and 1.7% for
the frozen specimens) and one frozen specimen remained indeterminate following
repeat testing. The indeterminate rate after repeat testing was 0.0% (0/798) for the
fresh specimen and 0.1% (1/1665) for the frozen specimens.
The overall initial non-reportable rate (including all indeterminate an unresolved
results) for the fresh specimens was 2.6% (21/798), which resolved to 0.1% (1/798)
after repeat testing. The overall initial non-reportable rate for the frozen specimens
was 2.5% (41/1665), which resolved to 0.1% (1/1665) after repeat testing. Non-
reportable assay results (UNR and IND) were excluded from the final performance
calculations.
The sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive
Value (NPV) values were calculated by comparing GenePOC CDiff assay results
with the combined results of direct and enriched culture method (Reference Method).
Discrepant analysis was performed on a portion of specimens with discordant results
between the GenePOC CDiff assay and the culture reference method using FDA-
cleared molecular tests at each site. The performance of the GenePOC CDiff assay
was also reported in comparison to direct culture as positive percent agreement (PPA)
and negative percent agreement (NPA).
Comparison with Combined Direct and Broth Enriched Culture
The clinical performance of the GenePOC CDiff assay compared to the combined
direct and broth enriched toxigenic culture results are presented in Table 12 for fresh
specimens and Table 13 for frozen specimens.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
In the clinical studies, a total of 2 461 specimens were enrolled during two prospective
collections at eight geographically diverse clinical sites, from subjects ranging in age
from less than two years old to more than 60 years old. Of these specimens, 333 were
positive based on the combined results of direct and enriched toxigenic culture for an
overall observed prevalence of 13.5% [333/2461; 95%CI: 12,2 – 15%]. The overall
percentage of positive results observed with the GenePOC CDiff assay with these
specimens was 11.5% [283/2461; 95%CI: 10,3 – 12,8%].

3. Specimen Identification:
The instrument has two barcode readers to identify reagents and patient specimens.
Barcodes are used to identify patient specimens, and the SBT and PIE are pre-labeled with
a unique barcode to identify both specimen and assay. This provides traceability of the
sample ID to the PIE ID, SBT ID, and assay ID.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Samples are manually prepared and transferred to an assay specific PIE for analysis.
Briefly, the user is required to pipette the patient specimen into the SBT, transfer the
sample into the PIE, and load the PIEs into the instrument. All further specimen handling
is automated.
5. Calibration:
The system is factory calibrated by the manufacturer, and will undergo performance
qualification testing on-site during annual preventive maintenance. If qualification testing
results determine significant drift, the instrument will be returned to the manufacturer for
re-calibration.
6. Quality Control:
Each PIE contains an internal process control (PrC) to verify amplification, quality of
assay reagents, and sample processing effectiveness and to detect potential inhibition or
instrument failures. The PrC is lysed, amplified, and detected along with each specimen
tested and monitors the efficacy of the DNA extraction and PCR amplification processes.
Commercial control material can be used as a Positive External Control in accordance
with applicable regulations or accrediting agencies.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:

Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
