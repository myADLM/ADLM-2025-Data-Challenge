L. Test Principle:
Evaluating the concentration of a soluble antigen (e.g. IgG Lambda) by turbidimetry involves
the addition of the test sample to a solution containing the appropriate antibody (anti-IgG
Lambda) in a reaction vessel or cuvette. A beam of light is passed through the cuvette and, as
the antigen-antibody reaction proceeds, the light passing through the cuvette is scattered

increasingly as insoluble immune complexes are formed. Light scatter is monitored by
measuring the decrease in intensity of the incident beam of light. The antibody in the cuvette
is in excess so the amount of immune complex formed is proportional to the antigen
concentration. A series of calibrators of known antigen concentration are assayed initially to
produce a calibration curve of measured light scatter versus antigen concentration. Samples
of unknown antigen concentration can then be assayed and the results read from the
calibration curve.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed following CLSI guideline EP-6A. The linearity of
the IgGκ and IgGλ assays have been confirmed using serially diluted serum samples
to cover the standard measuring ranges of 2.3 – 30.0 g/L and 1.5 – 17.5 g/L,
respectively. The results demonstrated that the IgGK and IgGL assays are linear over
the ranges of 1.930 – 33.427 g/L and 1.380 – 19.300 g/L at 1+19 dilution.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
An internal reference material was assigned by comparison with the Reference
Material ERM-DA470k/IFCC.
Stability:
Open-vial stability was performed on three lots of Optilite Hevylite IgG Kappa
and IgG Lambda kits with testing intervals at various time points up to 112
days. Data supports an open vial stability claim of 3 months at 2-8°C.
On-board stability was performed on three lots of Optilite Hevylite IgG Kappa
Open-vial stability was performed on three lots of Optilite Hevylite IgG Kappa and
IgG Lambda kits with testing intervals at various time points up to 112 days. Data
supports an open vial stability claim of 3 months at 2–8°C.
On-board stability was performed on three lots of Optilite Hevylite IgG Kappa and
IgG Lambda kits with testing intervals at various time points up to 37 days for IgGK
and 49 days for IgGL. Data supports an on-board stability claim of 28 days, provided
that the power is left switched on as stated in the product insert.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity was determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A. The
Limit of Blank was based on 60 determinations of analyte depleted sample and was
calculated as the 95th percentile of the distribution. The Limit of Detection was
calculated from the LoB and the combined SD of the five LoQ samples. The LoQ was
calculated from five independent samples (serum samples diluted with analyte
depleted serum to achieve a concentration close to the bottom of the measuring range)
tested 12 times over five days. The tabulated summary of results is shown below:
LoB LoD LoQ
IgG Kappa 0.000 g/L 0.009 g/L 0.115 g/L
IgG Lambda 0.000 g/L 0.005 g/L 0.075 g/L

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
Interferences were assessed according to CLSI guideline EP07-A2 by testing three
serum samples with different IgG Kappa and IgG Lambda concentration ranges,
including a sample close to the lower limit of the reference interval, a sample within
the reference interval and an elevated serum sample. Each sample was spiked with
interfering substances and tested in multiple replicates. No significant assay
interference effects were observed when the samples were tested with bilirubin at
200mg/L, hemoglobin at 5g/L, triglyceride at 1000mg/dL, intralipid at 125mg/dL or
the 16 commonly used drugs at the concentrations given below.

b. Other clinical supportive data:
Transformation of the BNII Study onto the Optilite
The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical Heavy+Light Chain (HLC)
Response categorization of the predicate and the Optilite Hevylite IgG Kappa and
Lambda Kits obtained from samples taken at multiple time points from patients with
IgG Kappa and IgG Lambda multiple myeloma during the course of their disease.
Passing-Bablok regression equations were generated for the comparison study of the
Optilite kits against the predicate kits. The regression equation was then modeled
with the existing 437 monitoring sample results from the original BNII submission to
evaluate the clinical validity of the new device.
HLC Monitoring Response Categories
Complete Response

> 32% increase in HLC ratio from baseline (the absolute increase in
Relapse from CR involved IgG must be ≥5g/L)
Optilite HLC Response Category Study
Assignment of classification was based on the HLC Monitoring Response Category
detailed in the above table, using all assay data available. Responses were categorized
in accordance with NCCN Guidelines v1.2011 by using the percentage change from
baseline. Responses were characterised as progressive disease (PD), stable disease
(SD), partial response (PR), very good partial response (VGPR), and complete
response (CR). Kappa statistics were used to evaluate agreement between the test and
predicate devices.
Optilite Monitoring Study Design
A comparison of 69 monitoring samples from 10 IgG Kappa patients and 12 IgG
Lambda patients was performed to compare the BNII HLC response category
assigned to those observed with the Optilite Hevylite IgG Kappa and Lambda kits
(Note: The Optilite monitoring response category is not to be used interchangeably
with other manufacturer’s assays or with any other instrument platform monitoring

These monitoring data were also supported by additional statistical regression
equation modelling data.
Data Modelling
A data modelling procedure was carried out on monitoring sample results from the
original BNII submission. The Passing-Bablok regression equations derived from the
previously cleared 437 BNII data set were mathematically transformed using the
Optilite regression equation. The statistical regression equation modeling (Cohen’s
Kappa) results are summarized in the tables below.
