K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle:
The test is a qualitative, solid phase, double antibody sandwich immunochromatographic
assay. Each test device contains mouse monoclonal anti-β-hCG antibody colloidal gold
conjugate pre-dried on a pad. Mouse monoclonal anti-α-antibody (on the test line) and goat
anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody (on the control line) are coated and immobilized on a
nitrocellulose membrane. During the test, hCG in the urine specimen reacts with the dye
conjugate (mouse anti-β-hCG antibody-colloidal gold conjugate specific to the beta subunit
of hCG) and forms a complex. The complex migrates along the membrane to the mouse anti-
-α-antibody test region, and remains captured on the test line (resulting in a visible test line if
hCG is present at concentrations above the cutoff), and excess mouse anti-β-hCG antibody-
colloidal gold conjugate migrates to the control line (resulting in a visible line, indicating the
test results are valid).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed at three hospital sites by 9 operators who tested
urine specimens, using the candidate device, that were spiked to hCG urine
concentrations of 0, 16, 18.75, 20, 25, 27.5, and 100 mIU/mL, with hCG traceable to
the WHO 5th International Standard. Each sample was tested using 10 devices from
each of the 3 device lots at each of the 3 sites, over 5 days. A total of 150 test results
per lot of device for each concentration were obtained. The positive results observed
over the total number of tests are summarized in the following table:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The test is calibrated against the WHO 5th International Standards for chorionic
gonadotropin 07/364.
Stability:
The shelf-life stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found
acceptable. Real time shelf-life stability studies are on-going.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable; see section M.1.a. for precision near the device cutoff.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity:
To determine if structurally similar analytes to hCG interfere with hCG results from
the candidate device, urine samples with 0 mIU/mL and 25 mIU/mL hCG were
spiked with 500 mIU/mL LH, 1000 mIU/mL FSH, and 1000 mIU/mL TSH and tested
with the device. No cross reactivity or interference was observed with the device at
these test concentrations.
Interference:
A study was performed to evaluate interference of common, structurally unrelated
substances on the test results obtained by the candidate device. Common endogenous
and exogenous substances were added to negative (0 mIU/mL) and positive (25
mIU/mL) urine samples. Testing was performed using 3 lots of the device. No
interference or cross-reactivity was observed from the compounds at the
concentrations listed below.

Effects of urine pH and specific gravity
Urine samples containing 0 and 25 mIU/mL hCG were adjusted to the following pH
levels: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. The samples were tested in duplicate using 3 lots of
the candidate device. The study showed that urine pH levels ranging from 3-10 do not
affect the expected results of the testing.
Negative (0 and 16 mIU/mL hCG) and positive (27.5 mIU/mL hCG) urine samples
were adjusted to have specific gravities of 1.000, 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025,
1.035, 1.040, 1.045, and 1.050. Each sample was tested in replicates of 5 per lot
using 3 lots of the candidate device. The positive and negative hCG results were not
affected by urine specific gravity concentrations between 1.000 and 1.050.
High dose/hook effect:
High dose hook effect was evaluated by spiking negative urine samples with hCG to
obtain 16 evenly spaced increasing hCG concentrations spanning the range of 10-
2,000,000 mIU/mL. No high dose hook effect was observed using the candidate
device with up to hCG levels of 2,000,000 mIU/mL.

hCG β-core fragment test:
Negative urine hCG samples containing 0 and 16 mIU/mL hCG and positive urine
samples containing 27.5 mIU/mL hCG were spiked with hCG beta core fragment
standard traceable to WHO reference reagent 99/708 at various concentrations up to
1,000,000 pmol/L. Each sample concentration was tested using three lots of the
device for 10 replicates per lot. No interference or cross-reactivity was observed at
concentrations of up to 100,000 pmol/L hCG β-core fragment.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device and lay user study:
A method comparison study was performed at 3 hospital sites to compare the results
obtained from 360 lay-users, testing their own urine with the David Home Pregnancy
Test Cassette, to results obtained by professionals who tested those same urine
samples using the predicate device, Wondfo One Step HCG Urine Pregnancy Test.
Lay users followed the English language instructions for use. The results are
summarized in the table below:
