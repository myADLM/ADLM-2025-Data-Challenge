H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Panther Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV assay is a multiplex real-time PCR (RT-PCR)
in vitro diagnostic test for the rapid and qualitative detection and differentiation of
Adenovirus (AdV) human Metapneumovirus (hMPV), and Rhinovirus (RV).
Nucleic acids are isolated and purified from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens
obtained from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of a respiratory tract
infection.
This assay is intended to aid in the differential diagnosis of Adenovirus, human
Metapneumovirus, and Rhinovirus infections in humans. Negative results do not
preclude Adenovirus, human Metapneumovirus, and Rhinovirus infections and
should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other management decisions.
This assay is designed for use on the Panther Fusion system.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

I. Device Description:
The Panther Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV Assay is a multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase
PCR (RT-PCR) in vitro diagnostic test developed for use on the fully automated Panther
Fusion system to detect and differentiate AdV, hMPV and RV directly from the
nasopharyngeal swab specimens.
The Panther Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV Assay involves the following steps:
a) Sample lysis; prior to processing and testing on the Panther Fusion system, specimens
are transferred to a tube containing specimen transport media (STM) that lyses the cells,
releases target nucleic acid, and protects them from degradation during storage.
b) Nucleic acid capture and elution takes place in a single tube on the Panther Fusion
system. The eluate is transferred to the Panther Fusion system reaction tube containing the
assay reagents. The Internal Control-S (IC-S) is added to each test specimen and controls
via the working Panther Fusion Capture Reagent-S (wFCR-S). The IC-S in the reagent is
used to monitor specimen processing, amplification, and detection. Magnetic particles with
covalently bound oligonucleotides mediate the nucleic acid capture. Capture
oligonucleotides hybridize to total nucleic acid in the test specimen. Hybridized nucleic

--- Page 3 ---
acid is then separated from the lysed specimen in a magnetic field. Wash and aspiration
steps remove extraneous components debris from the reaction tube. The elution step elutes
purified nucleic acid.
c) Elution transfer and multiplex PCR and RT-PCR; Eluted nucleic acid is transferred to a
Panther Fusion reaction tube already containing oil and reconstituted master mix. A reverse
transcriptase generates a DNA copy of the target sequence for hMPV and RV. Target
specific forward and reverse primers and probes then amplify targets while simultaneously
detecting and discriminating multiple target types via multiplex RT-PCR. The Panther
Fusion system compares the fluorescence signal to a predetermined cut-off to produce a
qualitative result for the presence or absence of the analyte. The positive result for each
analyte will be accompanied by the cycle threshold (Ct) value.

Procedures.
L. Test Principle:
The assay detects viral nucleic acids that have been extracted from a patient respiratory
sample. A multiplex Real-time RT-PCR reaction is carried out under optimized
conditions generating amplicons for AdV, hMPV and RV. The Internal Control-S (IC-
S) is added to each test specimen before processing to act as a control for specimen
processing, amplification, and detection. Identification of AdV, hMPV and RV, and the
IC-S occurs using target-specific primers and fluorescent-labeled probes that hybridize
to conserved regions in the viral genomes.

The reproducibility study data presented demonstrates an acceptable
reproducibility for this assay.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable; this is a qualitative assay
c. Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods), Stability:
Controls:
The assay contains an internal control (IC-S) which is added to each test specimen.
The IC-S is first added to the Panther Fusion Capture Reagent-S (FCR-S) to make
the working Panther Fusion Capture Reagent-S (wFCR-S). The control material
wFCR-S is added to the specimen after lysis. This control monitors specimen
processing, amplification, and detection. It does not monitor lysis of the sample.
Two external controls are also included with this assay in a single use vial, the
Panther Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV Positive Control and the Panther Fusion Negative
Control. The control validity was studied during the Reproducibility Study where a
positive and negative control was tested during every run (30 runs total). All
controls produced the expected result.
Stability:
Stability studies have been performed to support the following claims:
Sample Stability:
The study data supports specimen stability at the following storage temperatures
and storage times:
· Stored neat at 2-8°C for at least 96 hours
· Stored diluted (transferred to Specimen Lysis Tube (SLT)) at 30°C for at
least 144 hours (6 days)
· Stored diluted (transferred to SLT) at 2-8°C for at least 3 months.
· 3 Freeze/Thaw cycles (-70°C to Room Temperature = 1 Freeze/Thaw
cycle)

Shipping Stability:
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the exposure to extreme hot or
cold temperatures potentially encountered by the Panther Fusion
AdV/hMPV/RV Assay components during shipment would not impact the
performance of the assay. One lot of components and controls for the Panther
Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV Assay were tested in this study. All components were
exposed to the extreme temperatures in their final container closure systems.
The Panther Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV Assay components and controls were
cycled between the extreme low temperatures (-40 ±5°C), room temperature (28
±2°C), and extreme high temperature (55±5°C). One stress cycle consisted of
incubation for at least 9 hours at extreme high temperatures, then at least 15
hours at room-temperature, followed by at least 9 hours at extreme low
temperature, followed by at least 15-hour incubation at room temperature (1
cycle = approx. 48 hours). A total of 5 cycles were performed to evaluate the
worst case scenario of shipment to customers.
All runs tested gave the expected result for spiked and un-spiked samples. The
Panther Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV Assay and its components are not altered by
exposure to extreme hot or cold temperatures that may be encountered during
shipping.

Carryover:
This study was conducted to determine the carry-over (cross-contamination) rate
of the Panther Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV Assay when high titer AdV/hMPV/RV
positive samples are tested interspersed throughout the runs of negative samples
on the Panther Fusion system.
One run was comprised of 100 negative samples (baseline run), followed by
three runs comprised of 50 positive samples and 50 negative samples in a
checkerboard pattern (positive and negative samples loaded in alternate order).
Negative samples were comprised of simulated clinical matrix in VTM. Positive
samples consisted of simulated clinical matrix in VTM or pooled lower
respiratory tract specimens (LRT) spiked with RV A and AdV-1 at 104
TCID50/mL (> 10,000X LoD). Testing was completed on three Panther Fusion
systems using one lot of reagents.

***All 41 hMPV positive results were from LRT positive samples (n=224) made with pooled clinical
specimens of which several were hMPV positive. None of the samples in simulate clinical matrix
(SCM) were positive (n=225).
Baseline runs comprised of negative samples showed 0.7% positivity for RV
(2/300 positive for RV) and 0.0% positivity for AdV (0/300 positive for AdV)
across 3 instruments. One negative sample from the checkerboard runs was RV A
positive, resulting in 1/450 or 0.2% overall carry-over contamination rate for RV.
This sample was adjacent to positive SCM samples. All negative samples from
the checkerboard runs were AdV negative, resulting in 0.0% overall carry-over
contamination rate for AdV. All valid positive samples from the checkerboard
runs (runs 2-4) were RV and AdV positive (449/449). A subset of the LRT
positive samples were low hMPV positive (41/449, with Ct > 38) although they
were not spiked with hMPV. This is expected because LRT positive samples were
made from pooled clinical specimens, some of which were positive for hMPV.
Carryover was detected in this study and this will be noted in the limitations
section of the package insert.

d. Detection limit:
The purpose of this study was to evaluate and verify the analytical sensitivity and
Limit of Detection (LoD) of Adenovirus (AdV), Human Metapneumovirus
(hMPV) and Human Rhinovirus (RV) in pooled negative clinical nasopharyngeal
swab specimens when tested with the Panther Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV Assay.
Target-specific LoD values were obtained using multiple strains for each targeted
virus. The strains tested for each virus are listed in the table 12 below.

Dilutions of each virus were prepared in pooled negative clinical nasopharyngeal
swab (NP) specimens and tested with 11-13 replicates per concentration, using
three reagent lots. Testing was performed on three Panther Fusion systems per
concentration and per reagent lot for a total of at least 36 replicates per virus type.
Determined LoD value for each virus type was verified by testing newly prepared
samples for at least 20 replicates using one lot of reagents. The LoD value for each
virus is listed in the table below.

Interfering Substances
This study evaluated the performance of the Panther Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV
Assay in the presence of medications, over the counter products, and other
potentially interfering substances. Assay results were evaluated to determine if the
presence of potentially interfering substances in analyte-negative or analyte-
positive samples affected assay performance. Panels made of Simulated Clinical
Matrix with potentially interfering substances were divided into two aliquots. One
aliquot was tested un-spiked and the other aliquot was tested with intended targets
(AdV, hMPV, RV) spiked at 0.5 log above LoD. Panels were tested with 3
reagent lots. The substances tested are listed below:

For panel members 1-7 and 9-10, all spiked samples were 100.0% positive for
intended targets. All un-spiked panel members were 0.0% positive for all targets
other than IC. For panel members 8 and 11 spiked with RV, both were less than
100% positive (88.9% or 8/9 positive). One negative was from 1 reagent lot
(Reagent lot B) for both cases. Additional 6 replicates for both panel members
were tested with reagent lot B, and all were RV positive (combined 14/15 or
93.5% positive). The negative result is likely caused by either lower than
intended spiked titer (because of LoD variation with different RV strains); this is
supported by the results from panel member 11 (control) which also had 14/15
positive. Sensitivity for RV was deemed not negatively affected by the
interfering substances added to Panel member 8 because the one positive result
for a panel member with no interfering substances added was also erroneously
called negative. This study demonstrates that the substances tested do not
interfere with the performance of the Panther Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV Assay at
the concentrations tested.

Competitive Interference:
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that samples tested with the
Panther Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV Assay that are co-infected with multiple types of
targeted organisms do not inhibit the detection of either one (competitive
interference). Each targeted organism (AdV, hMPV and RV) was tested. Co-
infection Panels were made by spiking one target organism at high concentration
(1000X LoD) and another target organism at low concentration (3X LoD) in
simulated clinical matrix. Testing was completed on one Panther Fusion system
using one lot of reagents. The test panel members are shown below.

Cross-Reactivity:
This study evaluated the analytical specificity and sensitivity of the Panther
Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV Assay in the presence of non-targeted microorganisms
that could be present in the clinical specimen. Assay results were evaluated to
determine if the presence of spiked microbes in analyte negative or analyte
positive specimens affected assay performance. Panel members were composed of
3-5 different microorganisms spiked into simulated clinical matrix at either 103-
107 TCID50/mL (for virus) or 104-107 CFU/mL or IFU/mL (for bacteria). Each
panel member was split into two aliquots. One aliquot was spiked with one
representative strain of intended targets (AdV, hMPV, RV) to a final
concentration of 0.5 log above LoD to assess interference (negative effect on

tested with the same reagent lot. Additional test results were all RV negative
resulting in combined RV positivity of 6.7% (1/15). Additionally, new SCM was
prepared and spiked with seven different organisms included in Panel 1, all new
samples were 0.0% positive for RV. These results suggest that one RV positive
result was likely due to cross-contamination during sample handling and not due
to cross-reactivity. For all the rest of panel members, when tested un-spiked, all
were 0% positive for AdV, hMPV and RV.
Spiked with RV – Sensitivity for RV
When the panel members 2, 4, 5, 10 and 15 were spiked with RV at 0.5 log above
LOD and tested for total 9 replicates (3 replicates per each of 3 reagent lots), result
was 0.0% positive for AdV and hMPV as expected but less than 100.0% positive
for RV (55.6%, 66.7%, 88.9%, 77.8% and 77.8% respectively). For the panel
member 5, only 1/9 replicates were negative for RV. Additional 9 replicates were
tested with the reagent lot which generated one negative (lot B); all new samples
were RV positive. The combined RV positivity of all samples tested was 94.4%
(17/18). These results suggest that one RV negative result was likely due to cross-
contamination during sample handling and not due to cross-reactivity.
For the panel members 2, 4, 10 and 15, since more than one replicate was RV
negative, they were tested again with RV added at higher concentration. When
RV was spiked at 1 log above LOD and tested with 3 reagent lots (3 replicates per
each of 3 reagent lots), panel members 2, 4, 10 and 15 all generated 100.0% RV
positive and 0.0% AdV and hMPV positive. Result suggest that one more
organisms included in those panel members do exert slight inhibition against RV
detection when RV is present at low concentration (less than 1 log above LOD).
Spiked with AdV – Sensitivity for AdV
When the panel member 15 was spiked with AdV at 0.5 log above LOD and tested
for total 9 replicates, result was 0.0% positive for RV and hMPV as expected but
was 22.2% positive (expected 100% positive) for AdV (2/9). The panel member
15 was tested again with AdV added at higher concentration. When AdV was
spiked at 1 log above LOD it was 100.0% AdV positive and 0.0% hMPV and RV
positive. Result suggest that one more organisms included in those panel members
do exert slight inhibition against AdV detection when AdV is present at low
concentration (less than 1 log above LOD).
Spiked with hMPV – Sensitivity for hMPV
Cross-Reactivity panel members tested with hMPV spiked at 0.5 log above
LOD were 100% positive for hMPV and 0.0% positive for RV and AdV.
No inhibition is observed for hMPV detection.
The final results for all conditions tested are detailed in the table below.

f. Assay cut-off:
The relative fluorescence units (RFU) range is the difference between maximum
and minimum fluorescent signal seen in a sample during amplification. For Panther
Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV positive samples, the amplification curve rises above the
background florescence RFU resulting in a high RFU range for the intended targets.
The IC resembles a positive target and also has a high RFU range. For the Panther
Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV negative samples the amplification curve remains flat
resulting in a low RFU range for the intended targets. This difference in RFU range
is the primary criteria used to distinguish positive and negative specimens. RFU
range thresholds were set at 500 AdV, 600 for RV, and hMPV for determination of
positivity in their specific channels (HEX, FAM, ROX, respectively). RFU range
threshold for IC was set at 500 for determination of validity in its specific channel
(RED677). The RFU range thresholds were set based on data from multiple RFU
readings from known positive samples. The cycle number at which the
amplification curve crosses target specific assigned RFU range threshold value is
called Ct. Target specific Ct will be generated only for positive valid reaction for
that target.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The results of the assay were compared to shell vial culture followed by Direct
Fluorescence Antibody Testing (DFA) for adenovirus, Prodesse Pro hMPV+ for
human metapneumovirus, and PCR followed by sequencing for rhinovirus. For
additional details on the comparator please see the “Clinical Studies” section below.
b. Matrix comparison:
The following five commonly used Viral Transport Media (VTM) types were
evaluated: M4, M4RT, M5, M6, and BD UTM (identical to Copan Universal
Transport Medium). Five types of simulated clinical matrix (SCM) were prepared
by spiking 2x104 cells/mL of HeLa cells in to each of five VTM types listed
above. Cultured AdV strain 1 species C, hMPV Strain A2-20, and RV strain A-18
were then spiked into each VTM type at concentrations 1 log below LoD, 0.5 log
above LoD, and 1 log above LoD to prepare the VTM panel. Panel was tested
once right after sample spiking (T=0) and again after being stored at 2-8°C for at
least 72 hours (T>72 hrs). Testing was completed on four Panther Fusion systems
using one lot of reagents.
Two aberrant results were detected; one AdV was positive for RV and one hMPV
was positive for RV. Because the false positives were observed only once there
was no further investigation of the results. The aberrant result appears to be an
anomaly with an unknown cause.
All panel members for AdV, hMPV, and RV tested positive in all VTM types.
The testing results support use of all 5 Viral Transport Media types evaluated.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
Four clinical sites participated in this study. Each site obtained, processed, and
tested prospectively collected specimens with the Panther Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV
Assay as well as performed the comparator shell vial culture/DFA testing (AdV),
Prodesse Pro hMPV+ (hMPV), and dual reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR)
followed by bi-directional sequencing (RV). The study was conducted from
October 2016 to March 2017 and 3 lots of reagents were used during the study.
Fresh and frozen samples were tested during this clinical study.
Specimens included in this study were leftover, remnant nasopharyngeal swabs
collected from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The
specimen inclusion criteria were:
· A minimum volume of 1.75mL
· Stored at 2C to 8C for less than 72 hours after collection
· Specimen was collected in appropriate VTM (M4, M4RT, M5, M6, Copan
Universal Transport Medium or BD Universal Transport Medium)
Specimens were excluded if they were deemed unsuitable for reference culture or
Panther Fusion testing. Examples of unsuitable samples are: specimen leakage,
unacceptable VTM, storage time or temperature exceeded, etc.
This study collected 2961 clinical specimens, 6 were withdrawn after it was
determined that they did not meet the specimen inclusion criteria and further 25
were withdrawn by patient request. A total of 55 specimens had invalid results on
the Panther Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV Assay. Additional samples were removed from
analysis due to invalid reference testing, 6 invalid results from the reference testing
for AdV and 5 for RV. The overall invalid rate for the Panther Fusion
AdV/hMPV/RV Assay was 2.8% (80/2875).
The tables below show the performance of the Panther Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV
Assay, the data are stratified by analyte: AdV, hMPV, and RV. All data below
represent performance for prospectively collected specimens. The data includes
1118 freshly collected and tested specimens and 1757 samples prospectively
collected and stored frozen until testing.
