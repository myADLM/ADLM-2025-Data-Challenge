4. Special instrument requirements:
The T2Bacteria Panel is performed on the T2Dx Instrument
I. Device Description:
The T2Bacteria panel is a qualitative molecular diagnostic assay that employs a whole blood
compatible PCR amplification followed by T2 magnetic resonance (T2MR) detection. The
T2Bacteria Panel is performed on the T2Dx Instrument which executes all steps after specimen
loading. A K EDTA whole blood specimen containing a minimum of 3 mL is loaded directly
2
onto the T2Bacteria Sample Inlet, which is then placed on the T2Bacteria Cartridge along with
2

--- Page 3 ---
the T2Bacteria Reagent Tray. The Cartridge and Reagent Tray contain the lysis reagent, the
internal control, primers, enzyme, buffer and probe-coupled superparamagnetic particles for each
bacterial target. The blood specimen is mixed with the red blood cell lysing reagent and the
bacterial cells are concentrated by centrifugation. The internal control is added to the
concentrated bacterial cells; a bead-beating process then lyses the bacterial cells. The supernatant
containing the DNA from the lysed bacterial cells and the internal control are amplified using the
target and internal control-specific primers. The generated amplicons are aliquoted into
individual tubes containing target-specific conjugated particles for E. faecium, E. coli, K.
pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and the internal control. Bacterial DNA is amplified with
target-specific primers and amplicons are hybridized to target-specific probes attached to
superparamagnetic particles causing clustering of the particles. The hybridization occurring in
individual tubes is analyzed in the MR reader and a signal for each target is generated and is
detected by T2 Magnetic Resonance (T2MR) indicating the presence of the target organism. Up
to seven specimens can be loaded onto the T2Dx instrument at the same time. When running the
first specimen in a series or a single specimen, the result is reported in 3.5 hours from the time
the specimen is loaded onto the instrument. The results are interpreted by the device software as
valid or invalid (based on the result of the internal control or target detections), and if valid,
results are reported as “Positive” or “Target not Detected” for each specific target. For E. coli,
results are reported as Positive, Indeterminate or “Target not Detected”. An Indeterminate result
is a valid result, but the presence or absence of E. coli in the specimen cannot be definitively
assessed.

L. Test Principle:
During processing on the T2Dx instrument, pathogens are concentrated directly in whole
blood, then lysed to release the target DNA. Bacterial DNA is amplified with target-specific
primers and amplicons are hybridized to target-specific probes attached to superparamagnetic
particles causing clustering of the particles. A signal is detected by T2 Magnetic Resonance
(T2MR) indicating the presence of the target organism. The Internal Control on the Panel
monitors performance for each patient sample or control.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A multicenter reproducibility study was performed to determine the run to run,
reagent lot, day to day and site to site reproducibility. Testing was performed at three
sites (two external and one internal) with a panel of five target species, each tested in
triplicate at two concentrations (1-2X LoD and 3-4X LoD) using two reagent lots.
Testing was performed for six non-consecutive days with at least two operators per
site for a total of 36 replicates per sample per site.
The reproducibility panel was comprised of each target species spiked in fresh human
whole blood specimens in double-spiked samples (K. pneumoniae and S. aureus) or
triple-spiked samples (E. coli, P. aeruginosa and E. faecium). (The applicability of
using multi-spiked samples was evaluated in a separate study, see below.) Bacterial
levels were confirmed by colony count testing of the original suspension used for
spiking. A total of 108 negative blood samples were included in reproducibility panel.
Reproducibility results were acceptable with a range of 97.2% to 100% agreement in
detection with expected results for each of the target species. A summary of the
reproducibility results across sites, reagents and operators is shown in Table 2 below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The T2Bacteria Panel utilizes two types of controls, the internal control and the
external controls. The Internal Control (IC) is automatically introduced into each
specimen during sample processing on the T2Dx instrument and is carried through
the lysis, amplification and detection steps of the assay. The IC monitors the
amplification and detection process and detects the presence of inhibitors in the
specimen.
The external controls include the QCheck Positive Kit and the QCheck Negative Kit.
The QCheck Positive Kit contains two sample blends of bacterial species, the SaKp
Positive Control (which contains cells of S. aureus and K. pneumoniae) and the
EcPaEfm Positive Control (which contains cells of E. coli, P. aeruginosa and E.
faecium) suspended in a buffer-based solution. These positive controls individually
interrogate the respective, complementary probe-coated particles in the detection
reactions. Results for the positive controls are reported for only the detection channels
for species included in the control. The QCheck Negative Kit contains vials of a
buffer-based solution which are used to detect contamination of the T2Bacteria
regents or the instrument. Results of the negative control are reported for all five
detection channels.
External controls were run each day of the analytical and clinical studies. Summaries
of the quality control results obtained at all sites during the clinical study are provided
in Tables 3 to 5 below.
There were a total of 4394 negative control results obtained in the clinical study at the
testing sites; 4375 of these were valid and 19 were invalid. Using the original cut-off
for E. coli, 99.2% (4340/4375) gave negative results. There were a total of 35 false
positive results (0.8%) including 25 false positive results for E. coli. To address the
occurrence of false positive results obtained for E. coli, the original E. coli cut-off for
the QCheck Negative Control was modified (increased); cut-off values for other
target analytes were unchanged. Using the modified cut-off for E. coli, 99.4%
(4348/4375) gave acceptable negative results. With the revised cut-off, there was a
total of 27 false positive results with the negative controls, including 17 false positive

d. Detection limit:
LoD testing was performed using two strains of each target bacterial species
inoculated into human whole blood. The determination of the LoD included an initial
screening phase and a confirmatory phase. In the initial phase, double- or triple-
spiked samples were prepared at four concentrations (1, 3, 9 and 10 CFU/mL) and a
preliminary LoD was identified. (The applicability of using multi-spiked samples was
evaluated in a separate study; see below.) To confirm the preliminary LoD, a
minimum of 20 replicates of both strains of each species was tested at increasing
concentrations until a positivity rate of 95% was achieved. The preliminary LoD for
each species was confirmed using two reagent lots. For two species, K. pneumoniae
and P. aeruginosa, the preliminary LoD was not confirmed with both strains of each
species tested; the higher concentration that provided ≥ 95% positivity for both strains
was confirmed as the LoD. For E. coli, the preliminary LoD of 10 CFU/mL did not
provide ≥ 95% positivity during the confirmatory testing. Confirmatory testing was
repeated and the LoD was confirmed at 11 CFU/mL. Results of the confirmatory LoD
testing are shown in Table 6 below.

e. Single species spike, multi-species spike equivalence
A comparison of the equivalence of results obtained for human blood samples
spiked with a single bacterial species vs. samples spiked with three bacterial
species was performed to determine the applicability of testing multiple species in
a single blood specimen for the analytical studies.
A single strain each of the five target bacterial species was tested at
concentrations of 1-2 X LoD and 3-4 X LoD as controls. Four replicates of each
species at each concentration level were evaluated. Multi-spiked samples included
the combinations of K. pneumoniae/S. aureus and E. faecium/E. coli/

P. aeruginosa; each species in each combination was tested at two concentrations,
1-2 X LoD and 3-4 X LoD.
Samples containing two or three bacterial species gave positive results for each
species; signals obtained from the single-spiked samples were equivalent to the
signals obtained from the multi-spiked samples.
f. Analytical specificity:
Analytical exclusivity testing of the T2Bacteria Panel was conducted to assess the
cross reactivity of the panel with non-panel species tested at 103 CFU/mL for fungi
and bacteria, and 103 TCID for viral pathogens. Bacterial species that were shown
50
to be potentially cross-reactive at the initial concentration were then tested in
triplicate at more physiologically relevant concentrations of 100, 33 and 10 CFU/mL.
Isolates for testing were selected based on ≥96 primer homology and ≥84% probe
homology with species identified in a BLAST search. Species that showed no cross-
reactivity with T2Bacteria Panel target organisms when tested at a concentration of
103 CFU/mL or 103 TCID are shown in Table 7 below. Species that showed cross
50
reactivity with T2Bacteria Panel members when tested at concentrations of ≥ 10
CFU/mL are shown in Table 8.
By in silico analysis, Yersinia pestis was determined to be non-cross reactive (Table
7); Klebsiella quasipneumoniae and S. argenteus were determined to be cross reactive
with K. pneumoniae and S. aureus, respectively (Table 8).

For one species, Enterovirus Type 68, 0 of 3 replicates tested at 1,000 TCID /mL were
50
positive for E. coli; 1 of 6 replicates tested at 316 TCID /mL were positive on the
50
E. coli channel of the Panel. This species was deemed not cross reactive.
g. Assay cut-off:
To establish the limit of blank (LoB) and cut-off values for the bacterial target and
internal controls detections, negative blood specimens from healthy donors and blood
specimens from patients suspected of bacteremia were tested using multiple
instruments and reagent lots across multiple days. T2MR signals were evaluated to
establish the upper limit of the signal distribution for negative samples; the T2MR
signal values that encompassed ≥ 99% of all signals from negative samples was
determined to be the LoB.
The assay cut-off values were determined on a per channel basis using spiked positive
and negative samples; the lower limit of the signal distribution for each target channel
and for the internal control measurements determined the assay cut-off. Established
cut-offs were reevaluated utilizing data obtained with prospectively-collected and
contrived samples evaluated during the clinical study to validate the cut-off with a
larger specimen pool; analysis verified the cut-off for all targets except E. coli. The
cut-off for detection of E. coli was redefined using the larger data set and all results
were reanalyzed with the new cut-off. The cut-off values were established to produce
≥ 95.6% specificity and ≥ 90.0% sensitivity.
Because of the occurrence of false positive results with E. coli in the clinical study,
the cut-off for E. coli was reassessed to include an indeterminate range for which the
presence or absence of E. coli cannot be definitively assessed.

h. Analytical Sensitivity
A total of 57 clinical isolates were evaluated for inclusivity in the T2Bacteria Panel.
Isolates were selected to represent variations in antimicrobial resistance, and
phylogenic, temporal and geographic diversity. Isolates were inoculated into human
whole blood at a concentration of 2-3X LoD. Testing of each isolate was performed
in triplicate. In the event of a false negative result, testing was repeated with 20
replicates. Results of inclusivity testing combined with results from contrived
specimen testing in the clinical study (for which 50 unique isolates of each target
species were tested) indicate that the T2Bacteria Panel can detect a variety of strains
of target organisms with >95% accuracy. Results of the inclusivity study are shown
in Table 9 below.

E. faecium 11 33/33 (100)

P. aeruginosa 13 39/39 (100)
S. aureus 8 42/44 (95.5)
i. Co-infection Studies
A competitive inhibition study was performed to evaluate the ability of the
T2Bacteria Panel to detect target bacterial species present at 1-2X LoD in the
presence of other clinically relevant organisms (on- and off- panel) that may be
present in a co-infection. Three combinations of organisms were tested in human
whole blood samples: 1) samples containing two target bacterial species, each in
concentrations of 1-2X LoD (low concentrations); 2) samples containing one target
bacterial species at a concentration of 1-2X LoD (low concentration) and a second
target bacterial species at a concentration of 1000 CFU/mL (high concentration); and
3) samples containing one target bacterial species at a concentration of 1-2 X LoD
(low concentration) and a non-target bacterial species or yeast species at a
concentration of 1000 CFU/mL (high concentration). Four replicates of each
combination were initially tested; any combination resulting in a non-detection was
repeated with 20 replicates. If ≤95% of the target species were detected in the 20
replicates, the concentration of the competing organisms was decreased to determine
the level at which the detection was not inhibited.
On Panel Combinations. All target organisms were detected with four replicates at all
concentrations except for the following combinations: E. coli (low concentration)/ P.
aeruginosa (high concentration), P. aeruginosa (low concentration)/ E. coli (low
concentration) and P. aeruginosa (low concentration)/S. aureus (low concentration).
Repeat testing of 20 replicates of these combinations resulted in 100% detection. For the
combination of P. aeruginosa (low concentration) combined with E. coli (high
concentration), P. aeruginosa was initially detected in 2/4 replicates; repeat testing

showed detection of 18/20 replicates. This combination was further evaluated with
decreasing concentrations of E. coli (100 CFU, 33 CFU and 10 CFU); both P.
aeruginosa and E. coli were detected in all replicates with these concentrations. A
limitation was included in the labeling indicating that high concentrations of E. coli in a
blood specimen may prevent the detection of low concentrations of P. aeruginosa when
present in the same specimen.
Non-Panel Combinations. Combinations of non-panel and panel species were tested
as noted above. Non-panel member species were selected based on clinical relevance
and included Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter
cloacae, Streptococcus salivarius and Candida albicans. Non-panel species were
tested at a concentration of 1000 CFU/mL. Initial testing with four replicates showed
100% detection for all targets except P. aeruginosa with S. pneumoniae for which P.
aeruginosa was detected in three of the four replicates. Additional testing with 20
replicates of this combination resulted in 100% detection.
j. Interfering Substances
An interfering substances study was performed to determine and characterize the
effects of potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances commonly
found in blood on the performance of the T2Bacteria Panel. Interferents were
screened as pools of interferents in human whole blood samples; potential interferents
were added in high concentrations to represent worst case scenarios; samples were
tested in triplicate. Samples were inoculated with T2Bacteria target species at a
concentration of 2-3 X LoD and samples without interferents were include as
controls. Interferents that caused a difference in signal from a sample without
interferents were further analyzed individually in blood samples.
Evaluation of potential endogenous substances included 13 interferents that
represented underlying disease conditions (Table 10). None of the endogenous
substances tested showed interference with the T2Bacteria assay.

assay at the test concentration of 618 µg/mL. Further testing was performed with
lower concentrations of Feraheme; concentrations of Feraheme ≥21 µg/mL were
shown to interfere with the performance of the T2Bacteria Panel. The interference of
Feraheme with the T2Bacteria Panel was noted as a limitation in the device labeling.

k. Carryover/Cross Contamination Studies
A carryover/cross contamination study was performed to evaluate potential assay
contamination caused by operator or carryover in the T2 Dx instrument. Whole blood
specimens were spiked at concentrations of 100 CFU/mL (61 samples) and 1000
CFU/mL (56 samples) and were loaded on the T2 Dx instrument alternately with
negative whole blood specimens (123 negative specimens).
Of the 123 negative specimens, 3 (2.4%) gave false positive results; two with E. coli
(1.6%) and one with K. pneumoniae (0.8%). The occurrence of false positive results was
evaluated in follow-up studies related to reagent contamination (see below).
l. Specimen Stability
The stability of K EDTA blood specimens when stored at room temperature (15-30° C),
2
refrigerator temperature (2-8° C) and frozen (≤65° C) using samples spiked at a
concentration of 20 CFU/mL and tested over a range of days was evaluated. In addition,
studies were performed to evaluate the effect of storage at room temperature followed by
refrigeration. Results indicated that storage at all evaluated temperatures and tested
within the recommended times provided expected results for target and internal control
detections. The acceptable storage times and temperatures included in the device labeling
are shown in Table 12.

To determine the equivalence of fresh vs. frozen specimens, human whole blood samples
were spiked with 20 replicates of two strains of each target species at various
concentrations around the LoD concentration and tested with two lots of reagents (a total
of 980 tests). A total of 70 tests were also performed for a single target organism at 5X
LoD concentrations. All samples were tested with the T2Bacteria Panel at the time of
preparation (fresh) and after freezing for at least 24 hours. Results from both preparations
showed 100% detection with both specimen types at the established LoD. In addition, a
portion of the contrived samples (minimum of 15 for each target species) and eight
prospectively collected T2 blood specimens with positive concurrently-collected blood
cultures were tested fresh and frozen. Results were equivalent for all samples tested.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Because of the expected low prevalence of positive blood cultures for the target
bacterial species, evaluation of the sensitivity of the T2Bacteria Panel required the
use of contrived samples. Contrived sample testing was conducted at three clinical
sites. A total of 300 organism-spiked contrived samples and 50 negative samples
were prepared using human whole blood specimens collected in K EDTA tubes from
2
healthy adults and were verified to be negative for the T2Bacteria target species. Each
contrived sample was prepared using a single unique bacterial strain; a total of 50
unique strains for each target species were tested at specific concentrations for each
target organism. Samples were spiked at four concentration levels, <1 CFU/mL, 1-10
CFU/mL, 11-30 CFU/mL and 31-100 CFU/mL as shown in Table 13 below. The
concentrations were determined to approximate clinically relevant concentrations of
organisms in a blood specimen. Because of the higher LoD for E. coli as compared to
other target species, only 22 samples were prepared for E. coli at or above the LoD.
All samples were tested in a blinded fashion and negative samples were tested
randomly throughout the study.

Testing all target species with the T2Bacteria Panel at concentrations greater than
LoD showed PPA >90% for all species (Range 90.0 – 100%); results for E. coli were
determined using the final modified cut-off (Table 14).
Of the 250 results obtained for the negative samples included in the contrived study,
248 were negative for all targets. Two results were false positive for E. coli.

For samples spiked with E. coli at concentrations > 1 CFU/mL, PPA is 90.0% (36/40) (95% CI,
77.0 – 96.0); one sample gave an indeterminate result (1/40).
b. Clinical specificity:
The specificity of the T2Bacteria Panel was determined by a prospective study
comparing the results of the T2Bacteria Panel with results from a standard of care
blood culture collected from the same draw at the same anatomical site. The
comparison study was performed at 11 geographically diverse clinical sites in the
U.S. A total of 2430 subjects were enrolled, specimens from 1003 subjects were
excluded, with the majority excluded due to blood not collected, blood specimens
frozen and not tested (to decrease the number of frozen specimens vs. fresh
specimens), insufficient blood volume for testing and bloods for which the storage
limits were exceeded. A total of 1427 prospectively-collected specimens were tested
and included in the comparative study. For each participant, standard of care blood
cultures were drawn followed by collection of three K EDTA blood tubes (Tubes A,

B and C) for testing with the T2Bacteria Panel. Tube A was tested with the
T2Bacteria Panel and the remaining tubes were frozen for future analysis. Three
blood culture systems were used in the study; a total of 39 blood cultures gave
positive results for the T2Bacteria targeted organisms. Organism identification was
performed on all positive blood cultures using standard of care methods. Of the 1427
specimens 672 were fresh specimens and 755 were frozen. Results obtained with the
T2Bacteria Panel showed a specificity range of 95.0 to 99.4% depending on the target
(Table 15).

b Eight additional specimens gave indeterminate results
c S. aureus detected with retest using Tube B (residual specimen, drawn at the same time as the

In the clinical study, there were no prospectively collected specimens that contained
two or more target species; the ability of the T2Bacteria Panel to detect more than one
species in a single blood specimen was not evaluated. A limitation was added to the
device labeling.
Although the sensitivity (PPA) and specificity (NPA) of the T2Bacteria Panel was
acceptable, false positive results were obtained at multiple clinical sites during the
prospective arm of the clinical study. These occurred with multiple lots of cartridges
and reagents and from both fresh and frozen specimens. The majority of false positive
results were obtained for the E. coli and P. aeruginosa targets.
A review of other culture results from patients for whom a false positive T2Bacteria
result was obtained was performed. Various data that may provide insight on the
validity of the false positive results was reviewed and additional testing was
conducted. Positive blood cultures for the same target species obtained within ± 14
days of the T2Bacteria test were considered as strong evidence of bacteremia;
positive cultures from other sources were considered less predictive of bacteremia
(Table 16)
To further evaluate the validity of the false positive results, alternative amplification
and sequencing was performed on a frozen, residual blood tube (Tube B of the
original specimen draw) collected from each patient for whom a false positive
T2Bacteria result was obtained and for whom no other culture from any source

(collected within 14 ± days of the T2 positive specimen) was positive with the same
detected organism. Samples that were positive by amplification and sequencing for
the same species detected by the T2Bacteria Panel were also considered strong
evidence of bacteremia (Table 16).
Analysis of the additional data indicated that 44.5% of the false positives were
associated with strong evidence of bacteremia, 14.8% were weakly associated with
bacteremia and 40.6% were not associated with bacteremia.

An investigation into the root cause identified reagent contamination as the likely
source for the false positive results from patients with no evidence of infection. T2
Biosystems implemented improved reagent testing methods and release criteria with
the overall goal of reducing the rate of false positive results that can be attributed to
reagents contamination. To evaluate the effect of the improved testing methods, the
false positive rate obtained with testing negative controls during the clinical study
(875 negative control runs) was compared to the false positive rate obtained with an
additional 286 negative control runs. Results showed that after these improvements
the false positive rate potentially caused by reagent contamination was ≤1.1% for all
targets (Table 18).

Additional testing of archived samples (Tubes B or C) for 43 samples that were
originally positive for E. coli (30 samples) or P. aeruginosa (13 samples) and not
associated with other evidence of infections gave negative results for all samples.
Two of the archived samples were positive for P. aeruginosa from patients who were
originally T2 positive for P. aeruginosa, suggesting that these 2 samples were most
likely true positive results (with negative blood cultures) and the remaining samples
were most likely false positive results for P. aeruginosa.
After reagent improvements, additional testing was completed on 286 QCheck
negative controls and 120 K EDTA blood samples obtained from healthy donors.

blood samples and only for E. coli (1.0%) and P. aeruginosa (0.3%) in the QCheck
negative controls.
To address the possibility of false positive results with E. coli, an indeterminate zone was
instituted for interpretation of results for this species only. The device labeling indicates
that an indeterminate result (while valid) cannot be considered positive or negative, and
no antimicrobial therapy decisions should be based on this result.
The rate of invalid results and instrument failures that occurred during the clinical
study were 0.4% (8/1991 tests) and 3.1% (61/1991 tests), respectively.

Not Applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
In the prospective clinical study a total of 1427 paired blood cultures and T2Bacteria
specimens were evaluated. There were a total of 36 positive blood cultures and 199
positive T2Bacteria results. Positive T2Bacteria results were evaluated as noted above.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
