L. Test Principle:
Lumipulse G B•R•A•H•M•S PCT is an assay system, including a set of immunoassay reagents, for the
quantitative measurement of PCT in specimens based on CLEIA technology by a two- step sandwich
immunoassay method on the LUMIPULSE G1200 System. PCT in specimens specifically binds to anti-
PCT monoclonal antibody (mouse) and anti-calcitonin monoclonal antibody (mouse) on the particles,
and antigen-antibody immunocomplexes are formed. The particles are washed and rinsed to remove
unbound materials. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP; calf)-labeled anti-katacalcin monoclonal antibody
(mouse) specifically binds to PCT of the immunocomplexes on the particles, and additional
immunocomplexes are formed. The particles are washed and rinsed to remove unbound materials.
Substrate Solution is added and mixed with the particles. AMPPD (3-(2’-Spiroadamantane)-4-
Methoxy-4-(3”-Phosphoryloxy) Phenyl- 1, 2-Dioxetane Disodium Salt) contained in the Substrate
Solution is dephosphorylated by the catalysis of ALP indirectly conjugated to particles. Luminescence
(at a maximum wavelength of 477 nm) is generated by the cleavage reaction of dephosphorylated
AMPPD. The luminescent signal reflects the amount of PCT.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Prior to the precision study, technicians were required to pass a 3-day (Lot A and B) and 1-day

B•R•A•H•M•S PCT on the LUMIPULSE G1200 System demonstrated linearity in a study
consistent with the guidelines in the CLSI Protocol EP6-A.9) High and low sample pools were
created using patient serum samples that contained naturally expressed PCT. Lumipulse G
B•R•A•H•M•S PCT assay was shown to be linear within the actual test results of 0.010 ng/mL
to 104.260 ng/mL and supports the claimed Lumipulse G B•R•A•H•M•S PCT measurement
range of 0.020 ng/mL – 100.000 ng/mL. Results are summarized in Table 4 below.

The statistical evaluation of linearity was determined using EP6-A. Linear, quadratic and cubic
regressions were fitted. Lumipulse G B•R•A•H•M•S PCT correlated with expected
concentrations according to the linear regression formula:   = 0.008734 + 0.856577 ;  2 =
0.9979.
Dilution Verification
A dilution verification study was performed to compare and assess manual dilution and
automated (on-board) dilution for Lumipulse G B•R•A•H•M•S PCT. Three specimens (neat,
manually diluted 1:10, manually diluted 1:32, automated 1:10) were tested in triplicate. Manual
dilutions performed at 1:32 are not recommended for Lumipulse G B·R·A·H·M·S PCT.
Automated dilutions for 1:100, 1:200, and 1:1000 on the LUMIPULSE G1200 System can
cause erroneous results and should not be used when a specimen exceeds the 100 ng/mL.
Manual dilutions and automated dilutions performed at 1:10 are recommended for Lumipulse G
B•R•A•H•M•S PCT.
Spike and Recovery
Three individual apparently healthy serum samples were spiked and compared to the diluent
with the identical concentration. Percent recovery was calculated as follows for individual
spiked samples and was found to be within 100 ± 10% for all samples tested. See study results
in Table 5 below.

B•R•A•H•M•S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR testing was performed following the appropriate QC
procedures and manufacturer’s instruction specified in the B•R•A•H•M•S PCT sensitive
KRYPTOR package insert.
Sample testing with Lumipulse G B•R•A•H•M•S PCT was performed on three LUMIPULSE
G1200 Systems utilizing two lots of ICs, one lot of calibrators, and four calibrator curves.
There were 102 samples from female subjects (45.7%) and 121 samples from male subjects
(54.3%) in the method comparison sample set. The PCT range of samples tested and age
demographics are found in Tables 10 and 11 below.

Two separate analysis of the study data were performed, one with analysis restricted to samples
with B•R•A•H•M•S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR assays no more than 50.0 ng/mL and one with
an extended analysis including all samples tested. Weighted Deming and Passing-Bablok
regressions were performed with slope, correlation coefficient, intercept and mean difference
along with 95% CIs determined and found to be acceptable. Bland-Altman Plots with mean %
difference, percent limits of agreement and 95% CIs for Lumipulse G PCT and the predicate
with B•R•A•H•M•S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR were also calculated and found to be acceptable.

b. Matrix comparison (Specimen Tube Type Study):
The Lumipulse G B•R•A•H•M•S PCT matrix comparison study was performed to evaluate the
difference across tube types (SST, K EDTA, Lithium Heparin, Sodium Heparin, and Sodium
2
Citrate) versus the means of the control samples (Red top serum) analyzed per CLSI guideline
EP9-A3. Donor blood was drawn into 78 matched sets of collection tubes. The slope for each
tube type when compared to the control had 95% confidence intervals that lay entirely within
the range 0.9 to 1.1 and the correlation coefficients were ≥ 0.9. Results are summarized in
Table 26 below.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-offs:
28-day mortality:
ΔPCT ≤ 80%
· A decrease in the PCT levels below or equal to 80% defines a positive ΔPCT test result
representing a higher risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients diagnosed with severe
sepsis or septic shock.
ΔPCT > 80%
· A decrease in the PCT levels of more than 80% defines a negative ΔPCT test result
representing a lower risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients diagnosed with severe
sepsis or septic shock.
Progression Risk:
· PCT > 2 ng/mL: A PCT level above 2.0 ng/mL on the first day of ICU admission is
associated with a high risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.
· PCT < 0.5 ng/mL: A PCT level below 0.5 ng/mL on the first day of ICU admission is
associated with a low risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.
LRTI Antibiotic Decision Making:
· PCT < 0.10 ng/mL: Antibiotic therapy strongly discouraged.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Results from a total of 213 samples were used to determine the distribution of Lumipulse G
B•R•A•H•M•S PCT results in apparently healthy individuals. Subject demographics for age are
presented in Table 27 and subject demographics for race are presented in Table 28 for the
apparently healthy subjects. Descriptive statistics for the Lumipulse G B•R•A•H•M•S PCT results
are presented in Table 29 for the apparently healthy subjects.

To determine the upper limit of normal for the Lumipulse G B•R•A•H•M•S PCT assay, calculations
of the 95% reference interval were performed for the overall set of apparently healthy females,
apparently healthy males, and combined apparently healthy females and males in the study
according to CLSI EP28-A3. These results are presented in Table 29 below.

Overall, 98.1% (209/213) of the apparently healthy subjects had a Lumipulse G B•R•A•H•M•S
PCT value equal to or below 0.045 ng/mL. In a population of 213 self-reported healthy individuals,
the 95th percentile, upper reference range limit was calculated at 0.045 ng/mL.
It is recommended that each laboratory establish its own range, which may be unique to the
population it serves depending upon geographical, patient, and environmental factors.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as applicable
and the special controls for this device type under 21 CFR 866.3215.
