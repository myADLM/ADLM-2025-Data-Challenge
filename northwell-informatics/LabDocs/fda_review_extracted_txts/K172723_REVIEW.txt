L. Test Principle:
The Dario LC System determines the amount of glucose in fresh capillary blood using
electrochemical biosensor technology. An electrical current is generated by the reaction of
glucose with the reagent on the test strip (glucose oxidase). The strength of the current
produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the blood sample. The
glucose meter detects the current and converts it into a blood glucose reading. The final
results are communicated from the meter to the smart mobile device through the Apple
Lightning Connector.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
The Dario LC BGMS is compatible with iPhone 5, 5S, 5C, 6, 6s, Plus6 Plus, 7 and 7 Plus
with operating systems iOS 7, 8, 9 and 10. The Apple iPhone5 model of smart mobile
device was used as the representative mobile device for the following analytical
performance studies.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed repeatability (within-run) precision studies using venous
whole blood spiked to five different glucose concentration ranges (30 to 50, 51 to
110, 111 to 150, 151 to 250 and 251 to 400 mg/dL). Each glucose concentration level
was analyzed in replicates of 10, with 3 test strip lots and 10 meters, for a total of 100
replicates per glucose level per test strip lot (for a total of 300 tests per each glucose
level for 10 meter). Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed using heparinized venous whole blood samples. The
evaluation was conducted with five meters and three test strip lots. Seventeen
samples with the following glucose concentrations (mg/dL) were prepared: 11.5,
13.9, 34.7, 55.9, 77.1, 82.3, 97.7, 118.5, 152.3, 225.8, 295.3, 371.5, 446.8, 521.5,
568.0, 640 and 729.0 mg/dL (as established using a laboratory comparator method,
the YSI 2300 analyzer). The values from the Dario LC Blood Glucose Monitoring
System were compared with those obtained from the YSI-2300. Results from the
regression analysis are as follows:
y = 1.0046x + 2.6208, R2 =0.9972
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of
20-600 mg/dL. The system gives error messages “Hi” and “Lo” for results <20
mg/dL and >600 mg/dL, and these were validated.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
As established in k150817, the Dario LC Blood Glucose Monitoring System is
traceable to NIST SRM 917b.
d. Detection limit:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
To assess the performance of the Dario LC Blood Glucose Monitoring System in the
hands of the intended users the sponsor performed a study with 350 lay user
participants. Participants obtained and tested their own fingerstick samples with the
Dario LC System. Blood glucose results from the Dario LC meter obtained by the lay
user were compared to the glucose value from the YSI 2300 comparator method. The
samples ranged from 24 to 479 mg/dL as measured by YSI. The results are
summarized in the tables below:
Lay-user vs. YSI:

Results of linear regression analysis:
y = 0.9982x – 0.20809 , r 2 = 0.9694.
The usability of the proposed Dario LC Blood Glucose Monitoring System with the
Lightning connector was assessed within the User Evaluation study. The 350
subjects that participated in the lay-user accuracy study were included in the
assessment and provided their feedback on a series of three questions related to the
device and its labeling. The average responses rated the device and its individual
components as “easy” or “very easy” and 100% of the users were able to successfully
obtain a blood glucose reading when using the Dario LC Blood Glucose Monitoring
System with the Lightning connector.

--- Page 10 ---
automatically coded.
6. Quality Control:
Two levels of glucose control solutions are available with this system, but are sold
separately. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the
labeling. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these
ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1) Hematocrit Study: As established in k150817, to support the claimed hematocrit range of
20 to 60%.
2) Altitude study: As established in k150817 to support the claims in the labeling that
altitudes up to 10,000 feet (3048 meters) have no significant effect on blood glucose
measurements from the Dario meter.
3) Sample volume study: As established in k150817, to support the claimed minimum
sample volume of 0.3 mL.
4) Electrical Safety Testing: The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable
electrical safety testing had been performed and the candidate device was found
compliant.
5) Electromagnetic Interference Testing: The sponsor provided documentation certifying
that acceptable electromagnetic testing had been performed and the candidate device was
found compliant.
6) Operating Condition Testing: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies
using venous blood samples at five glucose concentrations (YSI glucose values
approximately 51, 100.5, 200.0, 313.5, and 494.0 mg/dL) to evaluate temperatures
ranging from 12±2oC to 45±2oC and relative humidity from 15±5% to 85±5%. Meter
results were compared to YSI values. Seven temperature and humidity combinations
were tested including low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity,
average temperature/low humidity, average temperature/high humidity, high
temperature/low humidity, and high temperature/high humidity. The results support the
claims in the labeling that the system can be used in conditions of 50 to 95°F (10 to
35°C) with relative humidity of 15 to 85%. The system gives an error message if it is
operated outside the claimed operating temperature conditions.
7) The device is intended for single-patine use only. The disinfection efficacy studies were
previously provided in k150817 demonstrating complete inactivation of live hepatitis B
virus using the external materials comprising the the meter, test strip cartridge cap and
housing with the chosen disinfectant, Super Sani-Cloth wipes with EPA registration
10

--- Page 11 ---
#9480-4. Robustness studies were performed by the sponsor demonstrating that the were
no changes in performance or external materials of the Dario LC meter after 156
cleaning and disinfetion cycles using the super sani-cloth wipes The robustness studies
were designed to simulate 3 years of single-patient use. The sponsor provides a
disposable sleeve for use with the mobile device to be used with each tes strip. Labeling
was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection
procedures.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
