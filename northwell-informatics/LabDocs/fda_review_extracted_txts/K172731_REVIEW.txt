4. Special instrument requirements:
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems using VITEK 2 Systems 8.01 software
I. Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card utilizes a miniaturized, abbreviated, and automated version of the
doubling dilution technique for determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) on
the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems.
Each VITEK 2 AST card has 64 microwells containing dehydrated media with or without an
antimicrobial. A control well that contains only dehydrated culture medium is resident on all
cards, with the remaining wells containing premeasured dried amounts of a specific antibiotic
combined with culture medium. VITEK 2 AST-GN Amikacin has 2, 4, 16, and 48 µg/mL
concentrations included in the test. The dried media in the card is rehydrated with the
organism suspension during the vacuum filling process and is then sealed. The VITEK 2
System has two options for preparing the AST card inoculum including an auto-dilution or
manual dilution method. The inoculated, sealed card is automatically loaded into the carousel
of the instrument and incubated (35.5°C) for the duration of the test. In contrast, the
VITEK 2 Compact instrument has a manual inoculation and sealing operation.
Growth of the test organism is optically monitored and measured four times per hour
throughout the incubation cycle (up to 18 hours for GN cards). Interpretive calls are
calculated by the instrument once a predefined growth threshold is obtained. When the test is
complete, the VITEK 2 card is automatically ejected from the carousel into a waste
container. A report is generated that contains the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)
value with an interpretation category of susceptible, intermediate, or resistant for each
antimicrobial on the card. The MIC result reporting range for Amikacin on the VITEK 2
AST-GN card is ≤ 1 – ≥ 64 µg/mL for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species

and ≤ 2 – ≥ 64 µg/mL for Acinetobacter species.

L. Test Principle:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection
using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics within the systems use
visible light to directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 microwells.
Transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth
has begun. Every 15 minutes throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based
on the VITEK 2 card), light transmittance readings of each well measures organism growth
by the amount of light that is prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of
the incubation period, the MIC values and their associated interpretive category results for
each antimicrobial on the test card are displayed in an automatically generated report.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Intended Use. Testing was performed on three separate days and in triplicate for a
total of 270 data points. The ten isolates tested in the reproducibility study included
Serratia marcescens (one isolate), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (one isolate),
Escherichia coli (two isolates), Proteus mirabilis (one isolate), Enterobacter
aerogenes (one isolate), Providencia stuartii (one isolate), Klebsiella pneumoniae
pneumoniae (one isolate), and Enterobacter cloacae complex (two isolates). Inocula
were prepared using both the auto-dilution and manual dilution methods for testing in
the VITEK 2 System. Inocula were prepared by the manual dilution method only for
use with the VITEK 2 Compact. The mode MIC value was determined and the
reproducibility was calculated based on MIC values that fell within +/- one doubling
dilution from the mode MIC value. Both intra-site and inter-site reproducibility for
Amikacin was calculated. There were no off-scale MIC results for any inoculum
preparation method for both the VITEK 2 or VITEK 2 Compact. Reproducibility was
calculated per the AST Special Controls Guidance.
An overall reproducibility of 100% was obtained for the VITEK 2 auto-dilution
method, the VITEK 2 manual dilution method, and the VITEK 2 Compact manual
dilution method.
When combined across all three sites, reproducibility results were acceptable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Inoculum Density Control
The DensiCHEKTM Plus was used to standardize the inoculum to a 0.5 MacFarland
standard. The instrument was standardized daily with all results recorded at each site.
Calibration values were within the expected range.
Purity Check
A purity check of all organisms was performed on the dilution tube used to prepare
the VITEK 2 card inoculum. Only those cultures that were pure were evaluated in the
study.
Growth Failure Rate
Of 473 clinical isolates that were evaluated, two isolates did not grow in the VITEK 2
Amikacin test using the VITEK 2 System. Complete test results were available for
471 clinical isolates (344 Enterobacteriaceae, 49 Non-Enterobacteriaceae, and 78
Pseudomonas species). The growth failure rate was 0.4% and was acceptable.
All 95 challenge organisms grew in the VITEK 2 GN card with Amikacin using both
the auto-dilution and manual dilution methods of the VITEK 2 and Compact Systems.
Therefore, 566 isolates had VITEK 2 AST results available.

Quality Control (QC) Testing
Two FDA/CLSI recommended QC organisms were tested throughout the
comparative testing at three study sites. The organisms tested were Escherichia coli
ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. These recommended QC
organisms were tested a minimum of 20 times/site by both the VITEK 2 AST-GN
card with Amikacin and with the CLSI broth microdilution reference method.
Both the auto-dilution and the manual dilution methods were within the expected
range >95% of the time. In instances where any organism was out of range for the
reference method, all testing data from that particular day was invalid and repeated.
The following table (Table 1) provides a summary of QC results.

*The lowest dilution of the VITEK 2 Amikacin MIC range is ≤1 µg/mL.
The expected range for E. coli ATCC 25922 with Amikacin is 0.5 – 4 µg/mL. Even
though the Amikacin concentrations included in the VITEK 2 AST-GN card are 2, 4,
16, and 48 µg/mL, the reporting range is ≤1 – ≥64 µg/mL for Enterobacteriaceae and
Pseudomonas species. All results for E. coli ATCC 25922 and P. aeruginosa ATCC

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Results obtained with the bioMérieux VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card with
Amikacin were compared to results obtained with the CLSI broth microdilution
reference panel. The following concentrations of Amikacin are contained in the
VITEK 2 AST-GN test card: 2, 4, 16, and 48 µg/mL (equivalent standard method
concentration by efficacy in µg/mL) and the reporting range is ≤ 1 – ≥ 64 µg/mL (i.e.,
≤ 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ≥ 64). Reference panels containing two-fold serial dilutions
ranging from 0.25 to 256 µg/mL were inoculated as outlined in the CLSI document
M07-A9.
All test inocula used for the evaluation of VITEK 2 AST-GN Amikacin and the
reference method were standardized using the DensiCHEKTM Plus instrument. The
cards were inoculated with each test organism by auto-dilution for reading by the
VITEK 2 System and by manual dilution for reading on the VITEK 2 System and
Compact instrument.
The VITEK 2 Amikacin susceptibility test was evaluated by six independent clinical
sites located in different geographic regions of the United States. A total of 473
clinical isolates were tested on the VITEK 2 Amikacin test; however, only 471
isolates grew (344 Enterobacteriaceae, 49 non-Enterobacteriaceae, and 78
Pseudomonas species). Every clinical isolate was tested once by auto-dilution on the
VITEK 2 System and the reference method using the same initial standardized
suspension. The majority of clinical isolates were isolated from fresh clinical
specimens (318 isolates; 67.2%) and 155 were stock isolates (32.8%).
A total of 95 challenge organisms (75 Enterobacteriaceae, 2 non-Enterobacteriaceae
(Acinetobacter spp.), and 18 Pseudomonas spp.) were evaluated at one external site.
The challenge set was tested with both the auto-dilution and manual dilution options
Page 8of 13

--- Page 9 ---
of the VITEK 2 System and with the manual dilution method on the VITEK 2
Compact System.
The study evaluated 471 clinical isolates and 95 challenge isolates for a combined
data set of 566 isolates with AST results (419 Enterobacteriaceae, 25 Acinetobacter
species, 26 other non-Enterobacteriaceae, 96 Pseudomonas species). The combined
performance (clinical and challenge isolates) of the VITEK 2 Amikacin test as
compared to the reference method is shown in Table 2 for 566 isolates.
Of the 566 total organisms evaluated in the comparative analysis, 79 clinical
organisms were not indicated in the FDA drug label for Amikacin (~14%). When the
non-indicated organisms were removed from the clinical performance evaluation, the
EA and CA were slightly higher at 95.9% and 99.0%, respectively compared to
94.9% EA and 98.4% CA with the non-indicated organisms included. Because overall
performance of the VITEK 2 AST-GN card with Amikacin was not affected,
incorporation of the 79 non-indicated organisms was acceptable.

Essential agreement (EA) was calculated when the VITEK 2 System results were within +/- one doubling dilution of
the reference method results. Category agreement (CA) was calculated when the VITEK 2 System result
interpretations agreed exactly with the reference method result interpretations. Evaluable results were defined as
when both the reference method results and the VITEK 2 System results were on-scale. Evaluable results were also
defined as when the reference method results were on-scale and off-scale VITEK 2 System results clearly did not
agree within the accepted +/- one doubling dilution.

A total of 25 resistant isolates were identified in the combined clinical (n=21) and
challenge (n=4) study of Amikacin for the VITEK 2 auto-dilution method out of 566
organisms (4.4%). However, the following indicated organisms had no resistant
isolates and/or an insufficient number of resistant isolates available during

comparative testing: Pseudomonas species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis,
Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Serratia species, and Citrobacter freundii.
This was addressed with the following limitation in the package insert:
“The ability of the AST card to detect resistance with the following combination(s)
is unknown because resistant strains were either not available or an insufficient
number were encountered at the time of comparative testing:
Amikacin: Pseudomonas species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis,
Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Serratia species, Citrobacter
freundii”
MIC Trends
Using the combined clinical and challenge data for indicated Enterobacteriaceae
organisms, an analysis of trending was conducted. This trending calculation takes into
account MIC values that are determined to be ≤ 1 or ≥ 1 doubling dilution compared
to the reference method irrespective whether the device MIC values are on-scale or
not. Results of trending analyses for evaluable isolates are shown in Table 4.1 and
Table 4.2 for Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, respectively.

A higher MIC reading trend was observed in the overall performance of C. freundii,
E. cloacae complex, E. coli, K. pneumoniae pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and P.
aeruginosa compared to CLSI broth microdilution, which raises concerns for
potential major errors.
To address the high trending and the potential occurrence of major error(s) for
Amikacin when testing select clinical and challenge Enterobacteriaceae and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa with the VITEK 2 System, the following statement was
added as a footnote in the labeling (Product Information Manual):
“VITEK 2 Amikacin MIC values for evaluable C. freundii, E. cloacae complex, E.
coli, K. pneumoniae pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and S. marcescens tended to be
in exact agreement or at least one doubling dilution higher compared to the CLSI
reference broth microdilution.”
The analysis of Acinetobacter species MIC data demonstrated no notable trending.
