Qualitative Test Performance
L. Test Principle:
In the indirect IFA method used in this kit, patient sera are incubated on HEp-2 cell
substrates to allow binding of antibodies. Any antibodies not bound are removed by washing
with buffer. Bound antibodies of the IgG class are detected by incubation of the substrate
with fluorescein-labeled anti-human IgG conjugate. Reactions are observed under a
fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filters. The presence of nuclear and
cytoplasmic patterns AC-1 to AC-28 as described by ICAP1 is demonstrated by green
fluorescence of specific structures in the cells. A majority (~90%) of the cells present on the
substrate are devoid of a functional PSIP1 gene which eliminates the relevant antigenic target
of the DFS70 pattern. This may aid in discrimination of ANA homogeneous and speckled
patterns from the DFS pattern.
It is recommended that patient samples demonstrating specific fluorescence reactions at a
dilution of 1:40 be reported as positive. Each laboratory must determine its own normal
values to account for differences in microscopy systems, personnel, and training. The titers
are determined by testing serial dilutions of patient samples and reported as the highest
reciprocal dilution with a positive reaction.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
All results presented below met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.
Interpretation of Results: Results should be reported as negative, positive, or, if end-point
titer has been determined, positive with titer. It is recommended that patient samples
demonstrating specific fluorescence reactions at a dilution of 1:40 be reported as positive.
Each laboratory must determine its own normal values to account for differences in
microscopy systems, personnel, and training. Users should only read only fields that
contain specific staining of the HEp-2 substrates.

The International Consensus on Antinuclear Antibody Patterns report recommends a
standardized nomenclature and reporting format for IFA patterns.1. Major nuclear
patterns that are recommended to be reported include Homogeneous (AC-1), Speckled
(AC-2, AC-4, AC-5), Centromere (AC-3), Discrete Nuclear Dots (AC-6, AC-7) and
Nucleolar (AC-8, AC-9, AC-10). Major cytoplasmic patterns include Fibrillar (AC-15,
AC-16, AC-17), Speckled (AC-18, AC-19, AC-20), Reticular/AMA (AC-21), Polar
Golgi-like (AC-22) and Rods and rings (AC-23). Including the most commonly and
mandated to be reported patterns described above, a total of 28 patterns are described in
the ICAP reference.1
Interpretation of DFS70 pattern on HEp-2 ELITE IFA substrate: In the ~10% baseline
HEp-2 cells in each well, a dense fine speckled pattern will be observed on interphase
nuclei. Chromatin-associated staining is seen on mitotic nuclei. The remaining ~90% of
HEp-2 cells have the PSIP1 gene encoding the LEDGF antigen knocked out and
therefore will not produce a similar pattern. If 10% of the HEp-2 cells have brighter
fluorescence corresponding to DFS70 pattern and rest of the cells present additional
patterns or fine speckled signal above cut-off, it indicates the presence of mixed patterns.
Closer analysis of such patterns is essential to confirm if other antibody specificity is
present in addition to the DFS70 pattern associated with LEDGF/PSIP1. Due to the high
prevalence of AC-2 patterns in an ANA screening population and relatively low
association with autoimmune rheumatic diseases, the ICAP committee recommends all
clinical labs report the DFS70 pattern.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor modeled precision studies based on CLSI guideline EP05-A3.
Repeatability:
To assess repeatability of the ImmuGlo HEp-2 Elite IFA, 8 negative and 17 positive
samples representing various patterns and positivities were tested: six replicates × two
runs/day × five days × two operators = 120 replicate measures for each sample. There
was ≥ 90% agreement for pattern calls for all samples. One speckled sample was
reported with 93% pattern agreement.
Reproducibility:
To assess variability, 10 positive samples with various patterns and positivities and
one negative sample were tested in triplicate in 10 runs (two runs/day × five days) at
three different sites, resulting in 90 datapoints for each sample for each outcome .
Global agreement values for pattern identity and titer (±1 dilution value) are provided
in the table below:

studies as part of design control to assign expiration dating to components and as part
of ongoing quality control/quality assurance analysis. Accelerated and open kit
studies were performed on three lots of components/reagents. Based on these studies,
the sponsor established an 18-month expiration date. Accelerated stability studies
supported maximum shelf life of 18 months from date of manufacture. Open kit
stability studies supported a maximum opened shelf life of 18 months from date of
opening.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity: Potentially cross-reactive disease sera were tested for ANA
antibodies using the ImmuGlo HEp-2 Elite IFA, including 254 samples from non-
systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease autoimmune disease conditions (ANCA-
associated vasculitis, celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, pernicious anemia, primary
biliary cholangitis, Raynaud’s syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune
thyroiditis, and ulcerative colitis), 13 inflammatory disease conditions (atopic
dermatitis, psoriasis), 57 cancer samples (breast, colorectal, ovarian, pancreatic,
prostate), and 173 infectious disease samples (CMV, HBV, HCV, HIV, HSV, Lyme
disease, mononucleosis, Rubella, syphilis, and toxoplasmosis). Positive prevalence in
these cohorts was as expected in literature and comparable to the predicate device.
See section M.3, below for the results of these studies.
Interference: The sponsor modeled interference studies based on CLSI EP07-A2.
Interference was studied by mixing sera with known ANA antibody levels with
potentially interfering substances and evaluating the deviation from expected results.
No significant interference was demonstrated for the following substances at the
levels indicated: hemoglobin (2 g/L), unconjugated bilirubin (342 μmol/L),
rheumatoid factor (100 U/mL), cholesterol (13 mmol/L), triglycerides (3.7 mmol/L),
naproxen (2170 μmol/L), ibuprofen (2425 μmol/L), prednisone (0.84 μmol/L),
mycophenylate mofetil (14.01 μg/mL), hydroxychloroquine (388 ng/mL),
cyclophosphamide (1437 μmol/L), rituximab (1.143 mg/mL) and belimumab (0.939
mg/mL).
While results using suspect specimens will generally produce the correct qualitative
result, testing of grossly hemolyzed or lipemic samples is not recommended as stated
in the product insert.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cutoff of 1:40 was established from literature. The recommended screening
dilution is 1:40, at which a result with fluorescence intensity 1+ – 4+ and a
recognizeable pattern is reported as positive. The manufacturer suggests laboratories
perform doubling dilutions to establish their own titering protocols. The titers of 1:40
and 1:80 are considered low titers, 1:160 and 1:320 are considered medium titers, and
1:640 and greater are considered high titers.
2. Comparison studies:
The sponsor modeled qualitative comparison studies based on CLSI EP12-A2.

To evalute performance in DFS-positive samples, a cohort of 122 DFS antibody-
suspected samples was studied separately. This enriched cohort was tested on both
the predicate HEp-2 device and the HEp-2 ELITE IFA system. The Sponsor stated
that 32 of these samples were reported on the predicate to be difficult to positively
distinguish DFS from homogeneous or speckled patterns and described as
‘Homogeneous/Speckled/DFS unable to be discriminated’.

To further evaluate the ability of the HEp-2 Elite IFA substrate to successfully
determine the DFS pattern, a reader study was performed. A total of 243 samples
were selected to represent ANA patterns and negative samples, with particular
emphasis on DFS, as well as homogeneous and speckled, as discrimination of these
two patterns is most confounded with the DFS pattern. Samples were randomized,
then tested on both the HEp-2 Elite IFA and predicate, and each substrate read by
three independent readers. All readers were blinded to the expected pattern and to
each others’ pattern calls.
Pattern identity calls were compared between the HEp-2 Elite IFA and the predicate
device for each individual reader. In this analysis, a pattern call was considered
agreement if the HEp-2 Elite IFA device reported the same pattern as the predicate. In
addition, aHEp-2 Elite IFA to predicate comparison was made for consensus reads, in
which at least any two-of-three readers agree on the identity of a pattern call. Results
are presented in the table below:

Tests for anti-nuclear antibodies aid in the diagnosis of SLE among other systemic
autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARD). A total of 256 diagnosed SARD samples
were tested on the HEp-2 ELITE IFA. Non-ANA-associated disease conditions,
including non-SARD autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, cancer, and
infectious diseases may be included in the intended use differential diagnosis for
ANA. For comparison to the SARD sample cohort above, 254 samples of non-SARD
autoimmune disease controls, 13 inflammatory disease controls, 57 cancer, and 173
samples from infectious disease cases were studied on the HEp-2 ELITE IFA.
