L. Test Principle:
The Access hsTnI is a two–site immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay. Monoclonal anti–
cTnI antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase is added to a reaction vessel along with a
surfactant–containing buffer and sample. After a short incubation, paramagnetic particles
coated with monoclonal anti–cTnI antibody are added. The human cTnI binds to the anti–
cTnI antibody on the solid phase, while the anti–cTnI antibody–alkaline phosphatase
conjugate reacts with different antigenic sites on the cTnI molecules. After incubation in a
reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound
materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and
light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is
directly proportional to the concentration of cTnI in the sample. The amount of analyte in the
sample is determined from a stored, multi–point calibration curve.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated precision in several studies following the recommendations in
CLSI EP05-A3.
Within-laboratory precision studies:
An internal study was conducted with five serum and five lithium heparin plasma
sample pools with approximate TnI concentrations of 10, 20, 100, 5,000, and 20,000
pg/mL. Samples around the 99th percentile cut-off (i.e., 10, 20 pg/mL) were native
sample pools, all others were spiked with native human cTnI. For the studies, the
instruments were calibrated at 18°C, 24°C, and 30°C and subsequently each sample
level was assayed in duplicate, in up to four runs per day, over 10 days at 18°C, 24°C,
and 30°C (for a total of 9 different calibration temperature/run temperature conditions
evaluated for each sample), using three reagent lots and three instruments for each
calibration/run temperature condition (instrument and lot were confounded in this
study) and one calibrator lot for the entire study. The total %CV estimates include the
within-laboratory sources of variability (within-run, between-run, and between-day)
as well as between-lot and between-instrument variability. The following data
generated at one calibration/run temperature condition are representative of the results
of all of the precision studies:

A second within-laboratory precision study was performed at one external site under
normal laboratory conditions. Four commercial controls (QC), five lithium heparin
plasma sample pools, and five serum sample pools were run in duplicate, two runs per
day for 20 days. This study was performed using one reagent lot and one instrument.

Field precision study:
The sponsor performed an in-house precision study to simulate the use of the device
by the end user. This study was designed to incorporate different sources of
variability that may be found in the field including: the simultaneous running of other
assays; variability in test request type (e.g., panel, stat, and individual testing);
variability of ambient temperatures. Three lithium heparin plasma and three serum
samples with concentrations across the measuring range of the assay were assayed in
randomized singlicates using three reagent lots on three UniCel DxI 800 instruments
over three days for a total of 15 replicates per sample across all temperature
conditions during a single day. During the course of a day, the ambient temperature in
which the study was executed was cycled between 18°C and 28°C as described in the
following table:
Time point Ambient Temperature
1 23°C
2 20.5°C
3 18°C
4 23°C
5 25.5°C
6 28°C
A single calibration curve was generated at 23 ±2ºC on each instrument for this study.
Results are shown below. Differences in the number of data points in the table were
due to experimental design (automatic flex testing of high samples) and some
replicates inadvertently not tested or not yielding results.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated following the recommendations in CLSI EP06-A.
Study 1
Lithium heparin plasma and serum samples covering the upper range of the assay
were used for the linearity determination. The low sample was a normal female
sample. The high sample was prepared by spiking with native human antigen.
Intermediate samples were prepared independently by using incrementally larger
proportions of the high sample mixed with the low sample for a total of seven sample
levels. The low sample was run in replicates of eight, and all other samples were run
in replicates of four. All samples were run on one UniCel DxI 800 Immunoassay
System per temperature, using one reagent lot and one calibrator lot at each of three
temperature conditions (18 °C, 24 °C, and 30 °C). Test results did not deviate from
linearity by more than 10%. Representative results for weighted linear regression are
shown below:
Plasma:
y = 0.978x + 0.040 (range tested: 1.80 to 28070 pg/mL)
Serum:
y = 0.963x + 0.074 (range tested: 1.96 to 27302 pg/mL)
Study 2
Lithium heparin plasma and serum samples covering the low end of the assay range
were used for the linearity determination. The low sample was a normal female
sample. The high sample was prepared by spiking with native human antigen.
Intermediate samples were prepared independently by using incrementally larger
proportions of the high sample mixed with the low sample for a total of eight sample
levels. The low sample was run in replicates of eight, and all other samples were run
in replicates of four. All samples were run on one UniCel DxI 800 Immunoassay
System per temperature, using one reagent lot and one calibrator lot at each of three
temperature conditions (18 °C, 24 °C, and 30 °C). Test results did not deviate from
linearity by more than 10%.

Representative results for weighted linear regression are shown below:
Plasma:
18°C: y = 1.058x – 0.074 (range tested: 1.25 to 94.86 pg/mL)
Serum:
30°C: y = 0.956x + 0.017 (range tested: 0.40 to 106.9 pg/mL)
These studies support the sponsor’s measuring range claim of 2.1 pg/mL to 27,027
pg/mL.
Hook Effect
The sponsor demonstrated that there was no high dose hook effect from the
concentration of the Access hsTnI S6 calibrator (~ 27,027 pg/mL) to 2,500,000
pg/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The sponsor’s traceability scheme was reviewed and found acceptable. The Access
hsTnI assay is traceable to a commercially available troponin method via value
transference of true patient sample results.
Sample stability
To evaluate the stability of TnI in patient samples, at least 30 serum and 30 lithium
heparin samples (ranging from 2 to 25,000 pg/mL) were tested using the Access
hsTnI assay on the UniCel DxI800 instrument fresh (baseline) and at various time
points after storage at room temperature (20-25°C), refrigerated (2-8°C), and frozen
(-20°C). The studies support the following sample handling claims in the labeling:
· 4 hours at room temperature (15 to 25°C)
· 48 hours refrigerated (2-8°C)
· 3 days frozen (-20°C or colder)
d. Detection limit:
Limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ)
studies were performed and analyzed following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-
A2.
To estimate the LoB, four zero analyte samples (Access hsTnI S0 calibrator material)
were measured in three runs with replicates of five using three reagent lots on each of
three UniCel DxI 800 Access Immunoassay Systems at three calibration temperatures
9

--- Page 10 ---
(18°C, 24°C, 30°C) and three run temperatures (18°C, 24°C, 30°C). The LoB was
calculated using a non-parametric approach. The sponsor claims that the LoB is 1.2
pg/mL.
To estimate the LoD, five native serum and five native lithium heparin low level
samples were measured in two runs with replicates of five over five days, using three
reagent lots and three UniCel DxI 800 Access Immunoassay Systems (one reagent lot
for each instrument) at three calibration temperatures (18°C, 24°C, 30°C) and three
run temperatures (18°C, 24°C, 30°C). The sponsor claims that the LoD is 2.1 pg/mL.
To estimate the LoQ, 13 native serum and 13 native lithium heparin samples were
measured in two runs with replicates of five over five days, using three reagent lots
and three UniCel DxI 800 Access Immunoassay Systems (one reagent lot for each
instrument) at three calibration temperatures (18°C, 24°C, 30°C) and three run
temperatures (18°C, 24°C, 30°C). The sponsor calculated the LoQ based on precision
profile modeling. The sponsor claims a LoQ of 2.1 pg/mL at 20% CV within-
laboratory imprecision, and a LoQ of 4.6 pg/mL at 10% CV within-laboratory
imprecision. Based on regression analysis of the LoQ precision profiles, the sponsor
also showed that the %CV at the 99th percentile upper reference limits was less than
10%. If a sample contains less than the LoQ for the assay, the UniCel DxI 800
instrument reports the result as less than that value, i.e. < 2.1 pg/mL.
These studies support the sponsor’s claimed measuring range of 2.1 pg/mL to 27,027
pg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous and exogenous interference was evaluated according to CLSI EP07-A2
by spiking lithium heparin and serum patient samples (~ 10 pg/mL and ~ 100 pg/mL
TnI) with possible interferents. Concentrations of potential interferents were chosen
according to recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2 or to be above therapeutic levels for
drugs or above the reference intervals for endogenous interferents. Each spiked
sample was tested in replicates of 12 on one UniCel DxI 800 instrument using three
reagent pack lots and one calibrator lot. Results were compared to control samples
without interferent. The sponsor considered a percent difference between test samples
and control samples of greater than ± 10% for samples containing more than 11.5
pg/mL TnI and greater than ± 2.3 pg/mL for samples containing equal or less than
11.5 pg/mL TnI to be significant interference.

In addition, the labeling includes the following limitations:
“Other potential interferences in the patient sample could be present and may cause
erroneous results in immunoassays. Some examples that have been documented in
literature include rheumatoid factor and fibrin. Carefully evaluate results if the sample is
suspected of having these types of interferences.”

“Endogenous alkaline phosphatase (ALP), exogenous ALP and proteins capable of
binding to ALP may cause interference. Elevated ALP levels are commonly observed in
patients with hepatobiliary disease and bone disease associated with increased
osteoblastic activity. Alkaline phosphatase levels above 400 U/L may cause false positive
results. In one study, a sample with cTnI concentration of approximately 8 pg/mL
demonstrated an increase of 4 pg/mL when spiked with 800 U/L of alkaline
phosphatase.”
“Access hsTnI should not be used for patients taking asfotase alfa (i.e. Strensiq).”
HAMA
The sponsor provided results demonstrating that their formulation reduces the effects of
HAMA interferents.
The labeling contains the following limitations:
“For assays employing antibodies, the possibility exists for interference by heterophile
antibodies in the patient sample. Patients who have been regularly exposed to animals or
have received immunotherapy or diagnostic procedures utilizing immunoglobulins or
immunoglobulin fragments may produce human anti-animal antibodies, e.g., HAMA, that
interfere with immunoassays. Additionally, other heterophile antibodies such as human
anti-goat antibodies may be present in patient samples.”
Troponin Autoantibodies
Troponin autoantibodies have been reported to be present in approximately 10-20% of
patients presenting to the ER and may lead to falsely low troponin assay results and delay
in treatment of acute coronary syndrome.1,2 The Access hsTnI assay was designed to
minimize interference from troponin autoantibodies and the sponsor conducted design
verification activities to assess this.

Cardiotoxicity, Clin Chem 2017, 63(1):30-32.

system, Heart 2010; 96(19):1518-1524.
Cross reactivity
To evaluate cross reactivity, the substances shown in the following table were added to
lithium heparin plasma and serum patient samples at two TnI concentrations (~ 10 and ~
100 pg/mL). Test results from samples spiked with the cross-reactant were compared to
test results from samples without cross-reactant added. Samples were measured on three
lots. The sponsor considered a percent difference between test samples and control
samples of greater than ± 10% for samples containing more than 11.5 pg/mL TnI and
12

--- Page 13 ---
greater than ± 2.3 pg/mL for samples containing equal or less than 11.5 pg/mL TnI to
show significant cross-reactivity. The sponsor did not observe significant cross-reactivity
for the following substances at the concentrations listed below:
Substance Concentration Added (ng/mL)
Actin 1,000
CK-MB 1,000
Myoglobin 1,000
Myosin 1,000
Cardiac troponin C 250
Skeletal troponin I 250
Tropomyosin 1,000
Cardiac Troponin T 125
f. Assay cut-off:
See section 4, Clinical cut-off, below.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison with the predicate device was not performed. Instead, accuracy
was assessed in a clinical study (see section 3 “clinical studies” below).
Thermal Method Comparison
The Access hsTnI/UniCel DxI 800 test system employs an algorithm to correct for
laboratory temperature fluctuations that could impact the accuracy of troponin test
results. A thermal method comparison study was completed to evaluate the impact of
temperature differences across the measuring range of the assay. At least 191 lithium
heparin patient samples and 182 serum patient samples (containing ~2.1 to ~20,000
pg/mL troponin) were tested and evaluated using three reagent pack lots on four
UniCel DxI 800 instruments at three calibration temperature conditions and at three
different run temperature conditions: 18°C, 24°C, and 30°C. A Passing-Bablok
regression analysis was performed comparing the concentrations from the three
different run temperatures of the samples within a given calibration temperature.
Results for a representative lot are shown below:

The sponsor concluded that operation of the instrument across the labeled operating
range of 18°C – 30°C does not impact analyte recovery for both lithium heparin
plasma and serum sample types and included the following limitation in the labeling:
“Ambient laboratory temperature should be maintained between 18°C and 30°C
(66.4°F and 86.0°F) while conducting patient sample testing. This assay employs an
algorithm to correct for laboratory temperature fluctuations that could impact the
accuracy of troponin test results. Up to 8% residual systematic bias may be observed
when comparing patient results obtained at 18°C and 30°C (64.4°F and 86.0°F).
The results are similar when the calibration temperatures are compared across
different run temperatures.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. The sponsor demonstrated the analytical and clinical performance of
lithium heparin plasma and serum for use with the Access hsTnI assay on the UniCel
DxI800 instrument.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
A clinical study was performed to evaluate the clinical performance of the device at
the different clinical cut-offs (see section 5 “Expected values/Reference range”
below). A multicenter prospective study conducted in 2010-2011 enrolled 1929
patients from Emergency Departments presenting with chest pain or equivalent
ischemic symptoms suggestive of Acute Coronary Syndromes. Final diagnoses were
adjudicated by an independent panel of expert physicians using criteria consistent
with the 2007 Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. Serial samples were
collected from patients within 9 hours of admission to the Emergency Department
(i.e., triage). The sample collection times were at time of admission (baseline), 1 to 3

Investigators and adjudicators were blinded to the proposed device’s results.
Adjudicators were also blinded to site diagnoses. All results presented below were
based on the adjudicated diagnoses. Lithium heparin and serum samples from 1854
patients were available for testing with the Access hsTnI assay on the DxI 800
Immunoassay System. Clinical performance was estimated at overall (male and

The following limitation is included in the labeling:
“Positive predictive values (PPV) demonstrated for female subjects using the
established female 99th percentile URL values were lower than the PPV values
obtained using the overall 99th percentile URL values. Using the lower female 99th
percentile URLs may result in a higher proportion of positive test results for females
that are non-MI. Taking into consideration the lower bound of the 95% CI, in the
worst-case scenario (serum drawn at 6-9 hours after presentation) up to 75% of
positive test results for females may be non-MI.”
b. Clinical specificity:
See clinical sensitivity above.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Please see section 5 “Expected values/Reference range” below. Three cut-offs for this
assay were determined based on the 99th percentile upper reference limit in apparently
healthy adults.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor conducted a multicenter prospective study to establish the 99th percentile
upper reference limit (URL) in a population of apparently health adults with no known
diseases of the cardiovascular system or other serious acute or chronic diseases or
infections. The sponsor evaluated 1088 lithium heparin samples and 1085 serum samples
from subjects enrolled at five geographically diverse locations. Both male and female
subjects were included in the reference range study to determine the 99th percentile URL
using a non-parametric empirical univariate distribution function. Results are as follows:
99th Percentile Upper Reference Limit
Population N in pg/mL (95% CI)
Plasma Serum
Females 593 14.9 (10.1 – 27.1) 13.6 (10.0 – 25.6)
Males 495 19.8 (15.9 – 38.4) 19.8 (15.4 – 44.8)
Overall (males and females combined) 1088 17.9 (14.7 – 27.1) 18.1 (14.3 – 25.6)
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
