L. Test Principle:
The Access hsTnI assay is a sequential two-step immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay.
Monoclonal anti cTnI antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase is added to a reaction
vessel along with a surfactant containing buffer and sample. After a short incubation,
paramagnetic particles coated with monoclonal anti cTnI antibody are added. The human
cTnI binds to the anti cTnI antibody on the solid phase, while the anti cTnI antibody
alkaline phosphatase conjugate reacts with different antigenic sites on the cTnI molecules.
After incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a
magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent
substrate is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a
luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of cTnI in the
sample. The amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a stored, multi-point
calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated precision in several studies following the recommendations in
CLSI EP5-A3.
Multiple temperature (run and calibration) within laboratory study: This study
evaluated precision of the proposed device under the following temperature
conditions:
Calibrating at 18°C and running samples at 18°C, 23°C and 28°C
Calibrating at 23°C and running samples at 18°C, 23°C and 28°C
Calibrating at 28°C and running samples at 18°C, 23°C and 28°C
In total, nine different calibration temperature/run temperature conditions were
evaluated for each sample.

--- Page 5 ---
For each set of temperature conditions, five serum and five lithium heparin plasma
samples with TnI concentrations of approximately 10, 20, 100, 5,000, and 20,000
pg/mL were used in the determination of imprecision. The low sample concentrations
(~10 and ~20 pg/mL) were chosen to represent patient samples with troponin levels
near the 99th percentile cutoffs. The 10 and 20 pg/mL samples were prepared by
pooling two to four individual patient samples with endogenous troponin
concentrations near the targeted range. The higher concentration samples were
prepared by spiking patient sample pools with natively sourced antigen.
Each sample was assayed in duplicate, in up to four runs per day, over at least 10
days for a total of 40 runs and 80 replicates for each sample at each of the nine
combinations of temperature conditions noted above. This was repeated using three
reagent lots and three instruments for each calibration/run temperature condition
(instrument and lot were confounded in this study). One calibrator lot was used for
the entire study.
The within-laboratory imprecision includes within-run, between-run, and between-
day variance components. The total %CV estimates include the within-laboratory
sources of variability (within-run, between-run, and between-day) as well as between-
lot and between-instrument variability. The following results from one set of
temperature conditions are representative of the results from this precision study:

External Reproducibility Study: An external reproducibility study was performed at
three sites as follows:
Four serum samples, four lithium heparin plasma samples and four quality control
materials were run in duplicate, two runs per day. Two of the serum and two of the
lithium heparin samples were native samples; the other two serum and lithium
heparin samples were spiked with natively sourced troponin antigen. The daily runs
were separated by a minimum of two hours. Calibration and run temperatures were
kept at room temperature (20-25 °C) for the duration of these studies. The study was
run at three external sites for five days. The instruments were calibrated prior to the
start of testing and the testing was performed in its entirety on one calibration at each
site. One reagent lot and one calibrator lot was used in the study. The results are
summarized below:

Field Precision Study: The sponsor performed a field effectiveness imprecision study
as follows:
The Access hsTnI assay and a panel of additional Access assays representing an
example of a hospital test menu was exercised on three Access 2 instruments over
three days. The ambient temperature of the laboratory, within which the instruments
were operated, was cycled to reflect the worst case thermal profile for Access
customers. The Access hsTnI assay was requested as part of a cardiac panel (hsTnI
and CKMB), as a STAT test, and individually. Three lithium heparin plasma and
three serum samples were prepared with concentrations across the measuring range of
the assay. The lowest concentration lithium heparin plasma sample and the lowest
concentration serum sample were prepared from pools of patient samples. The
remaining two lithium heparin plasma and two serum samples were prepared by
spiking patient sample pools with natively sourced antigen. Samples were assayed in

randomized singleton for a total of 15 replicates per sample across all temperature
conditions during a single day. Additionally, a series of other assays were randomly
executed throughout the study in order to mimic typical laboratory use of the
instrument. During the course of a day, the ambient temperature in which the study
was executed was cycled between 18°C and 28°C as described in the following table:
Time point Ambient Temperature

A single calibration curve was generated at 23 +/- 2 °C on each instrument for this
study. Differences in the number of data points in the table were due to experimental
design (automatic flex testing of high samples) and some replicates inadvertently not
tested or not yielding results. Representative results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Two studies were performed to determine the linearity of the Access hsTnI assay
following the recommendations in CLSI EP6-A.
The first study evaluated the low range of the assay. This study was done on one
Access 2 instrument per temperature, using one reagent lot and one calibrator lot at
each of the three temperatures evaluated (18°C, 23°C, and 28°C) so that a total of
three reagent pack lots were evaluated (one calibrated and run at 18°C, the second
calibrated and run at 23°C, and the third calibrated and run at 28°C). Samples were
prepared using lithium heparin plasma as well as serum. The low sample used was a
normal female lithium heparin and serum sample. The high sample was prepared by
spiking native human antigen into a lithium heparin and serum samples to a
concentration of approximately 100 pg/mL TnI. In addition to the high and low
troponin concentration samples, eight mixtures were tested in this study (including

samples around the cut-off for each sample type). These samples were prepared
independently by using incrementally larger proportions of the high sample mixed
with the low sample, in order to achieve troponin concentrations that covered the low
range of the assay. The low sample was run in replicates of eight, and all other
samples were run in replicates of four.
In the second study, lithium heparin plasma and serum samples covering the range of
the assay were evaluated. The low sample used was a normal female sample. The
high sample was prepared by spiking native human antigen into a lithium heparin and
a serum sample until a concentration at approximately the Access hsTnI S6
commercial calibrator was achieved. In addition to the high and low hsTnI
concentration samples, seven mixtures were tested in this study for each sample type.
These samples were prepared independently by using incrementally larger
proportions of the high sample diluted with the low sample, in order to achieve
troponin concentrations that covered the low end of the assay range. The low sample
was run in replicates of eight, and all other samples were run in replicates of four.
The maximum deviation from linearity for these studies was 2.66%. Representative
results for weighted linear regression are shown below:
Study one
Plasma:
y=0.987x+0.010 (range tested: 1.030 pg/mL to 84.66 pg.mL)
Serum:
y= 1.006x -0.006 (range tested: 0.977 pg/mL to 85.5 pg/mL)
Study two
Plasma:
y=0.976x + 0.17 (range tested: 0.701 pg/mL to 29,534 pg/mL)
Serum:
y=1.016x -0.008 (range tested: 0.465 pg/mL to 28,332 pg/mL)
These studies support the sponsor’s measuring range claim of 2.0 to 27,027 pg/mL.
Hook Effect
The sponsor demonstrated that there was no high dose hook effect from the
concentration of the Access hsTnI S6 calibrator (~ 27,027 pg/mL) to 2,500,000
pg/mL.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The manufacturer’s assay is traceable to a commercially available method via value
transference of true patient sample results. The manufacturer’s traceability process is
based on EN ISO 17511, and has been reviewed and found acceptable.
Sample stability
To evaluate the stability of TnI in patient samples, at least 30 serum and 30 lithium
heparin samples (ranging from 2 to 25,000 pg/mL) were tested using the Access
hsTnI assay on the Access 2 instrument fresh (baseline) and at various time points
after storage at room temperature (20-25°C), refrigerated (2-8°C), and frozen
(-20°C). The studies support the following sample handling claims in the labeling:
· 4 hours at room temperature (15 to 25°C)
· 48 hours refrigerated (2-8°C)
· 3 days frozen (-20°C or colder)
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) Test Protocol
Limit of Blank was determined for the Access hsTnI assay on the Access 2
Immunoassay System in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2. Four blank samples were
evaluated in replicates of 5 in one run per day for three days on three Access 2
instruments for a total of 180 measurements per instrument/reagent lot combination.
Three reagent lots were evaluated using one reagent lot at each of three temperatures
(18°C, 23°C, and 28°C). LoB was calculated non-parametrically for each lot and the
highest estimate was used. The sponsor determined the LoB to be 0.8 ng/mL.
A second LoB study was performed to confirm the insensitivity of the system to
different ambient temperature conditions. The study took 144 replicates of three
reagent lots measured on three separate instruments, performed under each of the
following conditions:
Calibrating at 18°C and running samples at 18°C, 23°C and 28°C
Calibrating at 23°C and running samples at 18°C, 23°C and 28°C
Calibrating at 28°C and running samples at 18°C, 23°C and 28°C
The LoB was calculated for each of these conditions using the same non-parametric
analysis as in the initial LoB determination. This study confirmed the results of the
original study.

--- Page 11 ---
Limit of Detection (LoD) Test Protocol
Limit of Detection was determined for the Access hsTnI assay on the Access 2
Immunoassay System in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2. Five lithium heparin and
five serum samples containing low levels of TnI were evaluated in replicates of five
in one run per day for five days on three instruments for a total of 50 replicates for
each sample on each instrument/reagent lot combination. Three reagent lots were
evaluated using one reagent lot at each of three temperatures (18°C, 23°C, and 28°C).
The Limit of Detection was determined as the concentration at which 95% of the
measurements would be greater than the LoB. LoD was calculated for each
temperature condition (each using a unique reagent lot). The LoD was determined by
the sponsor to be 2.0 pg/mL.
A second LoD study was performed to confirm the insensitivity of the system to
different ambient temperature conditions. 50 replicates of five serum and lithium
heparin samples were measured for each of the following conditions:
Calibrating at 18°C and running samples at 18°C, 23°C and 28°C
Calibrating at 23°C and running samples at 18°C, 23°C and 28°C
Calibrating at 28°C and running samples at 18°C, 23°C and 28°C
The study confirmed the results of the original study.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) Protocol
Native lithium heparin and native serum samples containing troponin I were
evaluated in replicates of five in two runs per day for five days on three instruments,
so that a total of 50 replicates for each sample on each instrument/reagent lot
combination were obtained. Three reagent lots were evaluated using one reagent lot at
each of three temperatures (18°C, 23°C, and 28°C).
A variance components model was used to estimate the within-run, between-day, and
within-laboratory (total) %CV for each sample on each instrument and reagent lot
combination. A precision profile was used to calculate the 20% CV LoQ value for
each instrument and reagent lot combination.
To confirm that the system was insensitive to temperature, a second LoQ study was
undertaken. 13 lithium heparin and thirteen serum samples containing low levels of
troponin I were evaluated in replicates of five in two runs per day for five days on
three instruments for a total of 50 replicates for each sample on each
instrument/reagent lot combination. The fifty replicates of these 13 serum and 13
lithium heparin samples were measured for each of the following conditions:
Calibrating at 18°C and running samples at 18°C, 23°C and 28°C
Calibrating at 23°C and running samples at 18°C, 23°C and 28°C
Calibrating at 28°C and running samples at 18°C, 23°C and 28°C

--- Page 12 ---
A variance components model was used to estimate the within-run, between-day,
between-run and within-laboratory (total) %CV for each sample on each instrument
and reagent lot combination. A precision profile was used to calculate the 10% CV
LoQ and the 20% CV LoQ value for each instrument and reagent lot combination.
These studies each indicated that the LoQ was equal to the LoD (2.0 pg/mL), and
support the sponsor’s claimed measuring range of 2.0 pg/mL to 27,027 pg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Potential interference due to endogenous and exogenous substances (listed in the
table below) was evaluated. The test protocol was designed following the
recommendations in CLSI EP7-A2. Serum and lithium heparin troponin samples at
low (~10 pg/mL) and high (~100 pg/mL) troponin concentrations were prepared by
spiking pooled patient samples with natively sourced human troponin antigen.
Known concentrations of potential interferents were added to these samples at
concentrations based on the recommendations in EP7-A2. Results from these spiked
samples were then evaluated against control samples. The study was run on one
instrument, using three reagent lots and one lot of calibrators. 12 replicates were
tested for each control sample and each spiked sample, and this was repeated across
three reagent lots. The mean concentration of the replicates was calculated for the
control patient sample and the spiked sample preparations for each lot. The variation
added by the interferent was calculated as a difference in concentration from the
control concentration.
The sponsor considered a percent difference between test samples and control
samples of greater than ± 10% for samples containing more than 11.5 pg/mL TnI and
greater than ± 2.3 pg/mL for samples containing equal or less than 11.5 pg/mL TnI to
be significant interference.
The following table describes the interferents evaluated and testing results:

In addition, the labeling includes the following limitations:
“Other potential interferences in the patient sample could be present and may cause
erroneous results in immunoassays. Some examples that have been documented in
literature include rheumatoid factor and fibrin. Carefully evaluate results if the sample
is suspected of having these types of interferences.”
“Endogenous alkaline phosphatase (ALP), exogenous ALP and proteins capable of
binding to ALP may cause interference. Elevated ALP levels are commonly observed
in patients with hepatobiliary disease and bone disease associated with increased
osteoblastic activity. Alkaline phosphatase levels above 400 U/L may cause false
positive results. In one study, a sample with cTnI concentration of approximately 8
pg/mL demonstrated an increase of 4 pg/mL when spiked with 800 U/L of alkaline
phosphatase.”
“Access hsTnI should not be used for patients taking asfotase alfa (i.e. Strensiq).”
HAMA
The sponsor provided results demonstrating that their formulation reduces the effects
of HAMA interferents.

The labeling contains the following limitations:
“For assays employing antibodies, the possibility exists for interference by
heterophile antibodies in the patient sample. Patients who have been regularly
exposed to animals or have received immunotherapy or diagnostic procedures
utilizing immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments may produce human anti-
animal antibodies, e.g., HAMA, that interfere with immunoassays. Additionally, other
heterophile antibodies such as human anti-goat antibodies may be present in patient
samples.”
Troponin Autoantibodies
Troponin autoantibodies have been reported to be present in approximately 10-20%
of patients presenting to the ER and may lead to falsely low troponin assay results
and delay in treatment of acute coronary syndrome.1,2 The Access hsTnI assay was
designed to minimize interference from troponin autoantibodies and the sponsor
conducted design verification activities to assess this.

Cross-Reactivity:
Potential cross-reactive substances were evaluated following the recommendations in
CLSI EP7-A2 using serum and lithium heparin samples targeted to a low (~10
pg/mL) and high concentration (~100 pg/mL) of troponin. These samples were
prepared by spiking pooled patient serum or plasma with natively sourced troponin
antigen. Test samples were prepared by spiking each lithium heparin and serum
sample with a potentially cross-reactive substance. A control sample without each
substance was also prepared. Test and control samples were analyzed in replicates of
12 and the average concentration of each sample was calculated separately for three
reagent lots.
For each substance tested, cross-reactivity was defined either as a difference in
concentration between the control and test sample greater than 10% (for samples
>11.5 pg/mL troponin), or by a change in concentration between diluent control and
test sample ≤2.30 pg/mL (for sample concentrations ≤ 11.5 pg/mL troponin).
The following substances did not show cross-reactivity as defined above at the

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison with the predicate device was not performed. Instead, accuracy
was assessed in a clinical study (see section 3, Clinical studies, below).
Thermal Method Comparison:
The Access 2 Immunoassay System requires a thermal algorithm for the Access
AccuTnI+3 Reagent. However, the sponsor claims that the candidate device is not
sensitive to ambient temperature conditions. To support this claim, a thermal method
comparison study was completed to demonstrate the impact of temperature
differences across the measuring range of the assay. A minimum of 192 patient
samples (each in both lithium heparin plasma and serum) across the measuring range
were tested using three reagent pack lots on four different Access 2 instruments at
three temperature conditions: 18°C, 23°C and 28°C (for both calibration and testing
for a total of 9 different temperature condition combinations). A Passing-Bablok
regression analysis was performed comparing the concentrations from the three
different run temperatures of the samples within a given calibration temperature.
Results from a representative lot are summarized below:

The sponsor concluded that operation of the instrument across the labeled operating
range of 18°C – 28°C does not impact analyte recovery for both lithium heparin
plasma and serum sample types.
The results summarized above are similar when the calibration temperatures are
compared across different run temperatures.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. The sponsor demonstrated the analytical and clinical performance of
lithium heparin plasma and serum for use with the Access hsTnI assay on the Access
2 instrument.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
A multicenter prospective study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy
of the Access hsTnI assay using the established 99th percentile URLs (see Section
4, Clinical cutoff). The study was designed to establish the clinical performance of
Access hsTnI as an aid in the diagnosis of MI.
A multicenter prospective study conducted in 2010-2011 enrolled 1929 patients from
Emergency Departments presenting with chest pain or equivalent ischemic symptoms
suggestive of Acute Coronary Syndromes. Lithium heparin and serum samples from
1851 patients were available for testing with the Access hsTnI assay on the Access 2
Immunoassay System.
True MI statuses of all subjects were adjudicated by an independent panel of expert
physicians using criteria consistent with the Universal Definition of Myocardial

Infarction. Adjudicators were blinded to the assay results and the attending
physicians’ diagnosis. All results presented below were based on the adjudicated
diagnoses. The MI incidence was 13% (238/1851). Serial samples were collected
from patients within 9 hours of admission to the Emergency Department (i.e.,
triage). The sample collection times were at time of admission (baseline), 1 to 3
hours, 3 to 6 hours, and 6 to 9 hours after admission to the Emergency Department.
Samples were tested at three independent clinical laboratories on Access 2 systems.
Testing was performed using serum and lithium heparin plasma samples. Study
results are shown in the tables below. Results are presented for different time
intervals between ED presentation and specimen collection: Clinical performance
was estimated at overall (male and female combined), male- and female-specific 99th
percentile upper reference limit (URL) cut-offs, calculated as described in Section 5,

The following limitation is included in the labeling:
“Positive predictive values (PPV) demonstrated for female subjects using the
established female 99th percentile URL values were lower than the PPV values
obtained using the overall 99th percentile URL values. Using the lower female 99th
percentile URLs may result in a higher proportion of positive test results for females
that are non-MI. Taking into consideration the lower bound of the 95% CI, in the
worst-case scenario (serum drawn at 6-9 hours after presentation) up to 78% of
positive test results for females may be non-MI.”

To establish the 99th percentile upper reference limit, lithium heparin plasma and serum
specimens were collected prospectively from apparently healthy individuals. To capture
an apparently healthy population, subjects were surveyed and excluded if they met any of
the following criteria, disease(s) of/or affecting the cardiovascular system, currently
taking a medication for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, other
serious chronic disease(s) (e.g., cancer, COPD, HIV, lupus, erythematosus, etc.), acute
bacterial or viral infection, or pregnancy. 1089 lithium heparin plasma samples and 1088
serum samples were collected from subjects enrolled at five geographically diverse
locations.
Both male and female subjects were included in the reference range study to determine
the 99th percentile URL using a non-parametric empirical, univariate distribution function
following CLSI Guidelines C28-A3c. Results are shown below:
