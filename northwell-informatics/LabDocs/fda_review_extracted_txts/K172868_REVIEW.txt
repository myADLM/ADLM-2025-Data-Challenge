L. Test Principle:
The determination of soluble antigen (CRP) concentration by turbidimetric methods involves
the reaction with specific antiserum (anti-CRP) to form insoluble complexes. When light is
passed through the suspension formed, a portion of the light is transmitted and focused onto a
photodiode by an optical lens system. The amount of transmitted light is indirectly
proportional to the specific protein concentration in the test sample. Concentrations are
automatically calculated by reference to a calibration curve stored within the instrument.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance: All results for analytical performance met the sponsor’s pre-
determined acceptance criteria for each study.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The studies were based on CLSI guideline EP05-A3, where four serum samples were
tested in duplicate per run, two runs per day, over 21 days, using one reagent lot over
three analyzers. The between-lot reproducibility was previously demonstrated in
K161982. The total SD and CV% calculation was based on the within-run, between-
run, and between-day data. The results are shown in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed following CLSI guideline EP06-A. The linearity of
this assay was confirmed using 14 serially diluted serum samples over the range of
2.70–316.03 mg/L. The results of weighted linear regression analysis are summarized
as follows:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i) Traceability:
The calibration of the assay is traceable to the international reference standard ERM-
DA474.
ii). Kit Stability:
Real-time stability - A study to establish shelf-life stability of the Optilite
CRP Kit is on-going. Currently available data supports that the reagent is stable
for five months from the date of manufacture when stored at recommended
temperature of 2–8°C.
Open-vial stability - The Optilite CRP Kit reagents can be stored opened at 2–
8°C for up to three months.
On-board stability - The Optilite CRP Kit reagents can be stored on-board the
Optilite analyser for at least 30 days.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity was determined in accordance with CLSI guideline EP17-
A2. The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by testing four native serum
samples run five times per day, over three days, using two reagent lots, to give a
total of 60 results per lot. The LoB was estimated for each lot as the 95%
percentile of the distribution.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by testing four serum samples run
five times per day, over three days, using two reagent lots to give a total of 60
results per lot. The LoD calculation followed a parametric analysis.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined by testing four serum samples
targeted to be close to the bottom of the measuring range, each tested five times per
day over three days using two reagent lots.
For LoB, LoD, and LoQ, the highest result obtained from the two lots tested was
taken as the final result (see below):
Detection Limit Concentration
LoB 1.35 mg/L
LoD 2.66 mg/L
LoQ 5.00 mg/L

e. Analytical specificity:
Interferences were assessed according to CLSI guideline EP07-A2 by testing serum
samples with CRP concentrations falling at approximately 9 mg/L, 60 mg/L and 150
mg/L. Each sample was spiked with interfering substances and tested in replicates of
three. Controls were prepared by spiking the same volume of the buffer without
interfering substances into the serum samples. Percentage interference was calculated
using the mean measurements of the test samples and the controls. A difference between
the results within ±10% was considered as absence of interference.
Endogenous Interference: The data demonstrated that the assay was not affected by
the levels of the following substances: hemoglobin (5 g/L), bilirubin (200 mg/L),
triglyceride (500 mg/dL), intralipid (250 mg/dL), and rheumatoid factor (2417 IU/mL).
Drug Interference: The data demonstrated that the assay was not affected by the 14
therapeutic drugs tested at the concentrations given below.

Acetylsalicylic Acid 3.63 mmol/L

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 193 serum samples spanning the measuring range were assayed in
singlicate by both the Optilite C-Reactive Protein and the Tina-Quant C-Reactive
Protein Gen. 3 kits. The samples included 83 normal donors and 110 clinical
samples. 80 samples (71 normal donors and 9 clinical samples) were excluded from
data analysis due to results reporting as lower than the bottom of the measuring range
for the Optilite C-Reactive Protein assay. A total of 113 samples were included in the
