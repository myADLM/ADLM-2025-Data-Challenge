3. CLSI M100-S27. Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing;
Twenty-Fourth Informational Supplement.
L. Test Principle:
The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are miniaturizations of the broth dilution susceptibility
test which have been dehydrated. Various antimicrobial agents are diluted in Mueller Hinton
broth supplemented with calcium and magnesium to concentrations bridging the range of
clinical interest. Breakpoint Combo panels use concentrations equivalent to the categorical
breakpoints of FDA and/or CLSI. After inoculation and rehydration with a standardized
suspension of organism and incubation of 35°C for a minimum of 16 hours, the minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test organism is determined by observing the lowest
antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three sites using 11 different strains of
Salmonella Typhi. Isolates were tested in triplicate over three days for a total of 297
data points. Inocula were prepared using both the turbidity and Prompt method and
4

results were read manually and automatically with the WalkAway and autoSCAN-4
instrument systems. The mode of MIC value was pre-determined and the
reproducibility was calculated based on the number of MIC values that fell within ±1
doubling dilution of the mode. The testing resulted in overall reproducibility of
greater than 95% for all inoculum preparation and reading methods.
The reproducibility results were acceptable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Inoculum Density Check. A spectrophotometric device, the MicroScan Turbidity
Meter) was used to ensure quality control of the turbidity inoculum method. The
turbidity inocula were prepared using the MicroScan Turbidity Meter with a reading
of 0.08 ± 0.02 (equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland barium sulfate turbidity standard). The
digital reading was recorded each day of use.
Data was also collected during the Reproducibility phase using the Prompt inoculum
preparation method.
Colony counts were performed weekly on the quality control strain E. coli ATCC
25922. Colony counts were also done once at each site for each reproducibility
isolate.
Purity Check. Purity check plates were performed on all isolates from each
inoculum preparation.
Growth Failure Rate. During the course of the study there were no growth failures
with the MicroScan or the frozen reference panel with Ciprofloxacin.
Quality Control Testing. The CLSI and FDA recommended QC organisms (E. coli
ATCC 25922 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853) were tested using all inoculation and
read methods against Ciprofloxacin at four sites (three external and one internal site).
Results obtained with the frozen reference panel and Test panel were compared to the
expected range of each strain. The results are summarized in Tables 2 and 3.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Results obtained with the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel with
Ciprofloxacin were compared to results obtained with the CLSI frozen broth
microdilution reference panel. Reference panels were prepared according to the CLSI
Document M7-A10 (Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for
Bacteria that Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard-Tenth Edition. Pennsylvania,
CLSI, 2015), using cation adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth. The reference panels were
read visually after 16-20 hours of incubation at 35 ± 1° C in a non-CO incubator.
2
The range of dilutions evaluated with the MicroScan panels was 0.004 – 8 µg/mL.
The frozen reference panel also contained those 12 dilutions of Ciprofloxacin.
Two inoculation methods were used: the Prompt Inoculation System and the turbidity
method. For the Prompt Inoculation System (the primary method), inocula were
prepared using the instructions of the manufacturer. For the turbidity method, inocula
were standardized using the MicroScan Turbidity Meter to approximate a 0.5
McFarland turbidity standard. Reference panels were inoculated using the turbidity
method.
Three read methods were evaluated: manual read, automated read using the
WalkAway and automated read using the autoScan-4. Reference panels were
manually read.
As agreed upon in pre-submission Q160981, an attempt was made to collect freshly
recovered clinical isolates but there were no incidences of fresh Salmonella Typhi
isolates due to rare occurrence of these infections in the US. Theredore, a total of 74
gram-negative challenge isolates were tested at three external study sites. Of the 74
Salmonella Typhi strains tested, 18 isolates were susceptible and 26 were resistant to
Ciprofloxacin by the reference method.
For the primary method, WalkAway instrument read and Prompt inoculation, the
Salmonella Typhi results from the Challenge study demonstrated an overall EA of
100% (74/74) and a CA of 94.6% (70/74). There were 4 minor discrepencies (5.4%)
and no major or very major discrenpencies. The overall performance is acceptable.
Table 4 below summarize the performance with Ciprofloxacin for Salmonella Typhi.
Data is shown for each inoculum preparation method (Prompt and turbidity) and for
each read method (WalkAway, autoSCAN-4 and manual read).

EA – Essential Agreement (+/- 2 dilutions) min – minor discrepancies
CA – Category Agreement maj – major discrepancies
EVAL – Evaluable isolates vmj – very major discrepancies
R or NS – Resistant or non-susceptible isolates
Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the result of the reference
method and that of the MicroScan panel within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of
the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on scale for both the MicroScan panel and
the reference method. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result
of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the MicroScan panel.
MIC Trend Analysis
Using the data provided by the sponsor in the diagonal table format recommended in
the AST Special Controls guidance document, an analysis was conducted for trending
in MIC values for each inoculation and reading method. This trending calculation
takes into account MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling
dilution lower or higher compared to the reference method irrespective whether the
device MIC values are on-scale or not. As summarized in Tables 5-6 below, a higher
trending was observed with Salmonella Typhi with both inoculation methods and all
reading methods

A higher MIC reading trend was observed in the overall performance of S. Typhi with
both inoculation methods (Prompt and Turbidity) and with all reading methods
(WalkAway, AutoScan and Manual) when compared to the CLSI broth microdilution
reference method, which raises concerns for potential major discrepancies. This
trending and the potential for occurrence of major discrepancies were addressed by
adding the following footnote to the labeling:
“Ciprofloxacin-S MIC values tended to be one dilution higher when compared to the
reference broth microdilution method for S. Typhi”.

Prompt Hold Study
An additional study was performed using 20 Salmonella Typhi at one site to
determine the agreement of results obtained with the Prompt inoculation method
using hold times of 0 hours and 4 hours prior to inoculation of the panels. The
following times and comparisons were made with each of the read methods
(WalkAway, autoSCAN-4 and manual).
Results of 4-hour hold vs. results of 0-hour hold
Results of 4-hour hold vs. results obtained with the frozen reference method
Results of 0-hour hold vs. results obtained with the frozen reference method
All tests showed overall acceptable essential agreement; category agreement was
>95.0% with all read methods. There were no major or very major errors. There was
only 1 minor error out of 20 (5% minor error rate)with the WalkAway and the manual
reading reading methods when compared to the frozen reference method.
Results were determined to be acceptable.
