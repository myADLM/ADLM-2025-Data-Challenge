K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI EP7-A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline – 2nd Edition
L. Test Principle:
DNA is extracted offline from whole blood specimens collected in K EDTA tubes. The user-
2
selected DNA extraction method must provide DNA of sufficient concentration. Automated
real-time PCR is then performed on the cobas z 480 analyzer. The Factor II and Factor V
mutations are detected simultaneously in the same real-time PCR reaction. The amplification
reactions generate a Factor II specific amplicon and Factor V specific amplicon in all
samples, and utilize four fluorescent-dye labeled oligonucleotide probes for detection of the
Factor II and Factor V genotypes. Depending upon the test order, results for one or both
mutations are reported for each DNA sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Lot-to-Lot Repeatability: The lot-to-lot repeatability of the cobasFactor II and Factor
V Test was evaluated by testing genomic DNA samples isolated from seven K EDTA
2
whole blood samples with three lots of the cobasFactor II and Factor V Test. The
study was conducted over five non-consecutive days with two operators, two cobas z
480 analyzers, one run per day per kit lot, and two replicates per run, for a total of 60
replicates of each sample. The cobasFactor II and Factor V Test results were
compared to the Factor II and Factor V genotype by bi-directional Sanger sequencing.
The overall agreement between cobasFactor II and Factor V Test results and nucleic
acid sequencing was 100% across all samples and reagent lots (one-sided, lower 95%
confidence limit 99.3%). The table below summarizes the study results by individual
lots and combined lots.

Clinical Reproducibility: A panel of nine specimens was tested at three sites, two
operators per site, with one instrument per site and three lots of reagent lots with one
lot per site. Each site had one operator which performed one run per day using one
sample preparation method over five non-consecutive days. Reproducibility was
assessed using a nine member panel as demonstrated in the table below: four
K EDTA whole blood samples, three contrived whole blood samples and two
2
extracted genomic (gDNA) samples diluted to 0.2 ng/µL. Below are tables which
summarize the overall agreement results of the reproducibility study for Factor II and
Factor V by overall genotype and testing site/sample preparation method.

testing with the cobas Factor II and Factor V test may be isolated from K EDTA whole
2
blood specimens after storage at 2–8°C for up to seven days, at 9–30°C for up to three
days. The performance of the cobas Factor II and Factor V test on whole blood samples
frozen and thawed up to three times was comparable to the performance on fresh, never
frozen samples.
Extracted Genomic DNA Stability Study: The stability of gDNA isolated from whole
blood for testing with the cobas Factor II and Factor V test was determined by isolating
gDNA from six K EDTA whole blood specimens using three commercially available
2
genomic DNA isolation kits, and testing the gDNA samples with the cobas Factor II and
Factor V test after storage at 2–8°C, -20°C and ≤ -70°C. All tests with the cobas Factor II
and Factor V test for all samples, DNA isolation methods, storage conditions and time
intervals yielded Factor II and Factor V genotype results in agreement with DNA
sequencing. Genomic DNA isolated from K EDTA whole blood for testing with the
2
cobas Factor II and Factor V test may be stored at 2–8°C for up to seven days or frozen at
-20°C to below -70°C for at least nine weeks. Genomic DNA may be frozen and thawed
up to three times.
Real-time and accelerated stability study: Three lots of the cobas Factor II and Factor V
test kit were subjected to real-time stability testing at 2–8°C, and accelerated stability
testing at 25°C and 37°C. The kit performance was assessed at each time point with the
kit function release test and by testing genomic DNA extracted from four whole blood
specimens at specified timepoints in the real-time study. The accelerated stability testing
at 25°C and 37°C is complete. The real-time stability testing at 2–8°C is in progress,
however real-time stability testing results through seven months from the date of
manufacture is complete. The 25°C and 37°C accelerated stability studies on all three
lots support a shelf life at 2–8°C of 18 months. The initial shelf life assignment for
the cobas Factor II and Factor V test, based on the 25°C and 37°C accelerated
stability studies is 15 months at 2–8°C. The 15-month shelf-life assignment will be
confirmed and extended with real-time stability study data.
Open Reagent Stability Study: The stability of the cobas Factor II and Factor V test,
after the reagents and controls have been used once, was determined by removing half
the volume from multiple vials of the kit reagents and controls, storing and recapped
vials at 2–8°C and testing them after approximately 31, 61 and 91 days of storage. At
each time interval, the previously opened reagent and control vials were testing with
the kit functional release test and by testing gDNA isolated from four K EDTA whole
2
blood specimens. The study was conducted with one lot of the cobas Factor II and
Factor V test. After opening and recapping, the reagents and controls were stable at
2–8°C for up to 90 days or the expiration date on the vials.
Activated Master Mix Stability Study: The stability of the activated Factor II and
Factor V (F2F5) master mix (MMX) was determined by preparing activated F2F5
MMX, and testing the activated F2F5 MMX after storage at 32°C for 0, 1, 2, 2.5, 4
and 4.5 hours. Each time interval was tested with the kit functional test and by testing
gDNA isolated from four K EDTA whole blood samples. The study was conducted
2
with three lots of the cobas Factor II and Factor V test. Activated F2F5 MMX may be
stored at room temperature for up to 4 hours.

d. Detection limit:
Analytical sensitivity - Lower Limit: To determine the minimum input of genomic
DNA necessary to yield correct Factor II and Factor V genotype results, genomic
DNA was isolated from three K EDTA whole blood samples (Factor II heterozygous,
2
Factor V heterozygous, Factor V homozygous mutant) and one cell line (Factor II
homozygous mutant), using three different commercial DNA isolation methods for
the whole blood samples, and one method for the cell line. Each genomic DNA
sample was tested with the cobasFactor II and Factor V Test at 10 concentrations:
undiluted (which varied between 6 and 38 ng/μL) and nine serial dilutions from 1.0 to
0.0001 ng/μL. Each dilution was tested with 24 replicates with each of two kit lots,
for a total of 48 replicates per concentration per genomic DNA sample. The undiluted
genomic DNA samples were tested with six replicates with each kit lot, for a total of
12 replicates per genomic DNA sample.
The rate of correct Factor II and Factor V genotype results across all four samples, all
three DNA isolation methods and both kit lots was 98% at 0.01 ng/μL and 100% at
all higher concentrations (see table below). The cobasFactor II and Factor V Test is
designed to yield Invalid results if the input DNA concentration is too low. There
were no incorrect genotype results in the study. The limit of detection is 0.01 ng/μL,
which is 10 times lower than the lowest recommended DNA input concentration. The
table below summaries the study results.

genomic DNA from a leukocyte depleted whole blood (LDWB) sample. The genomic
DNA samples at 300 ng/μL, 150 ng/μL and 75 ng/μL were tested with 24 replicates
with each of two kit lots, for a total of 48 replicates per concentration per genomic

DNA were tested with six replicates with each kit lot, for a total of 12 replicates per
genomic DNA sample. All samples at 300 ng/μL, 150 ng/μL and 75 ng/μL yielded
the correct Factor II and Factor V genotype results in all tests (see table below). The
LDWB samples without added cell line DNA yielded Invalid results, as expected; the

e. Analytical specificity:
Substances: Six K EDTA whole blood samples representing Factor II and Factor V
2
wild type and heterozygous genotypes were tested for potential interference by the
following substances: triglycerides, bilirubin, cholesterol and hemoglobin, K EDTA,
2
heparin, warfarin (Coumadin), rivaroxaban (Xarelto) and dabigatran etexilate
(Pradaxa). Triglycerides (37 mM), bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated, 342 μM),
and cholesterol (13 mM) did not interfere with the cobasFactor II and Factor V Test
when added to whole blood at the test concentrations recommended in CLSI
guideline, EP07-A2.Hemoglobin did not interfere with the cobasFactor II and Factor
V Test when added to whole blood at a concentration of 20 g/L. The anticoagulant
K EDTA did not interfere when it was tested at 5.7 mg/mL, which is approximately
2
three times the concentration of K EDTA in whole blood when the blood collection
2
tube was filled to capacity. Heparin (3000 U/L), warfarin (32.5 µmol/L), rivaroxaban
(1.5 µmol/L), and dabigatran etexilate (0.6 µmol/L) did not interfere with the cobas
Factor II and Factor V Test. Correct genotype results were obtained for all replicates
of all the gDNA samples.

For potential interference with extraction buffer and ethanol, these substances were
added to gDNA isolated from K EDTA whole blood. A commercial extraction buffer
2
containing guanidine hydrochloride, a common ingredient in commercial DNA
extraction buffers, interfered with the cobasFactor II and Factor V Test, causing
invalid results when it was present in genomic DNA samples at a concentration of
2.5% (v/v). Ethanol, a common ingredient in the wash buffers of commercial DNA
isolation methods, interfered with the cobasFactor II and Factor V Test when added
to genomic DNA samples to a concentration of 5% (v/v). For both substances,
observed interference caused invalid results.
Mutations: To determine the effect of known single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) close to the Factor V Leiden mutation (1691G>A) and the Factor II
(prothrombin) mutation (20210G>A), plasmid DNAs containing eight known SNPs
(20207A>C, 20209C>T, 20218A>G, 20221C>T, 1689G>A, 1690C>T, 1692A>C and
1696A>G) in the probe binding regions of the cobasFactor II and Factor V Test were
tested. The Factor II SNP plasmids and the Factor V SNP plasmids were wild type at
positions 20210 and 1691, respectively. Each SNP plasmid DNA was tested alone,
and in combination with wild type Factor II plasmid DNA, wild type Factor V
plasmid DNA, wild type Factor II and wild type Factor V plasmid DNAs, and with
genomic DNA from wild type whole blood.
None of the SNP plasmids caused false positive results for the Factor II
(prothrombin) or Factor V Leiden mutations, and none of the SNP plasmids interfered
with detection of the wild type Factor II or Factor V sequences. All four Factor II
SNP plasmids and three of four Factor V SNP plasmids were detected as wild type
Factor II or Factor V DNA, respectively. One Factor V SNP plasmid (1689G>A) was
not detected by the cobasFactor II and Factor V Test. If this SNP is present on both
alleles, the test result would be invalid.

One external site conducted testing with the cobas Factor II and Factor V test. One
commercial laboratory performed bi-directional Sanger sequencing. The 300 samples
were randomized and tested by two operators. All samples were tested for Factor II
and Factor V by both cobas Factor II and Factor V Test and Sanger sequencing. All
runs and tests were valid for the cobas test and no repeat tests were performed. A test
result was classified as correct for Factor II or Factor V if both the cobas test and
Sanger sequencing detected the same genotype.
The table below presents agreement between the cobas test and Sanger sequencing for
Factor II results. The Overall Percentage Agreement (OPA) between the two tests
was 100% with a two-sided 95% lower confidence bound (exact method) of 98.78%.
Both Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) and Negative Percent Agreement (NPA)
were 100% with lower confidence bounds of 97.59% for PPA and 97.55% for NPA.
The percent agreement of correct results for heterozygous and homozygous mutant
genotypes were both 100%.

DNA Extraction Method Study: Genomic DNA was isolated from 15 whole blood
samples using three commercially available DNA isolation methods according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, by two operators for three days, for a total of six DNA
isolations per sample with each DNA isolation method. Each isolated gDNA sample
was tested in triplicate with the cobas Factor II and Factor V Test. One hundred
percent of the results with the cobas Factor II and Factor V Test were in agreement
with the Factor II and Factor V genotype by bi-directional Sanger sequencing. One
gDNA sample was excluded from the results as it was rust colored and yielded
invalid results in all three tests. The table below summaries the results from the DNA

aOne of 90 DNA samples isolated with method A was rust-colored and generated three
invalid results. DNA samples with any appearance other than clear and colorless should not
be tested, as they may yield invalid or incorrect results.
b95% two-sided, confidence interval
cThe triplicate results from one sample isolated with method B were inconsistent: one correct,
one incorrect, one invalid. The sample eluate was re-tested in triplicate and all results were
correct upon testing.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Not applicable
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable.
