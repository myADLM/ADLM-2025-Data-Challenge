For Prescription Use Only
Limitations:
· Perform an alternative method of testing prior to reporting of results for the
following antibiotic/organism combination(s):
- Ceftazidime/Avibactam: Providencia rettgeri
· Although within Essential Agreement when compared to the reference method,
errors (major and/or very major) were observed due to the lack of intermediate
category. Testing should be repeated using an alternative testing/reference
method prior to reporting results for the following antibiotic/organism(s):
- Ceftazidime/Avibactam: Pseudomonas aeruginosa when the VITEK 2 MIC is
≥16μg/mL due to observed major errors (4.1%), with an adjusted categorical
major error rate of 1.2%.
4. Special instrument requirements:
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems using VITEK 2 Systems 9.01 software
I. Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each
VITEK 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium
is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials
combined with the nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized
concentration with 0.45% to 0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial
medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System will automatically dilute the bacterial
suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then the VITEK 2 will fill, seal
and place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling,
sealing and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the
card over a defined period of time (up to 24 hours for Streptococcus species). The analysis
program determines when a well demonstrates growth based on attenuation of light measured
by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration

or “MIC” values for the anti-microbial agent. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a
report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for
each antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-GN Ceftazidime/Avibactam has the following concentrations in the card:
0.06/4, 0.25/4, 1/4, 4/4, and 8/4µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy
in µg/mL). The Ceftazidime/Avibactam MIC result ranges for the VITEK 2 are:
· ≤ 0.12 – ≥ 16 µg/mL for Enterobacteriaceae
· ≤ 0.25 - ≥ 16 µg/mL for Pseudomonas aeruginosa

L. Test Principle:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection
using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems uses
visible light to directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells.
Transmittance optics is based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth
has begun. Every 15 minutes throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based
on the VITEK 2 card), light transmittance readings of each well measures organism growth
by the amount of light that is prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of
the incubation period, the MIC values and their associated interpretive category results for
each antimicrobial on the test card are displayed in an automatically generated report.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study for the VITEK 2 AST-GN card with Ceftazidime/Avibactam
was conducted at three external clinical sites using ten isolates of gram-negative
bacilli consistent with the Intended Use. Testing was performed on three separate
days and in triplicate for a total of 270 data points. The isolates tested in the
reproducibility study included one isolate each for Klebsiella pneumoniae
pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, two isolates each for Citrobacter freundii complex,
Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens. Inocula
were prepared using both the auto-dilution and manual dilution methods for testing in
the VITEK 2 System. Inocula were prepared by the manual dilution method only for
use with the VITEK 2 Compact. The mode MIC value was determined and the
reproducibility was calculated based on MIC values that fell within +/- one doubling
dilution from the mode MIC value. The majority of data points were on-scale and
within ± one doubling dilution agreement as compared to the mode MIC (Table 2).
Two data points were off-scale when tested by the VITEK 2 and the VITEK 2
Compact. The data was analyzed taking into consideration best case and worst case
scenarios as described in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document:
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems.
The reproducibility performance is shown in Table 2.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Inoculum Density Control
The DensiCHEK Plus was used to standardize the inoculum to a 0.5 McFarland
standard. The instrument was standardized daily with all results recorded at each site.
Calibration values were within the expected range.
Purity Check
A purity check of all organisms was performed on the dilution tube used to prepare
the VITEK 2 card inoculum. Only those cultures that were pure were evaluated in the
study.
Growth Failure Rate
There were ten isolates that failed to grow in the VITEK 2 card in the clinical study.
Complete test results were available for 980 isolates from a total of 990 clinical
isolates. The growth failure rate was 1.0% and was acceptable.
A challenge set of 93 isolates was evaluated at one site. All 93 challenge organisms
grew in the VITEK 2 GN card with Ceftazidime/Avibactam using both the auto-
dilution and manual dilution methods for the VITEK 2 and manual inoculation for the
VITEK 2 Compact System.
A total of 1073 VITEK 2 AST results were available.
Quality Control (QC) Testing
The FDA/CLSI recommended QC organisms (E. coli ATCC 25922, E. coli ATCC
35218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and K. pneumoniae pneumoniae
ATCC 700603) were tested using both the VITEK 2 card and the reference method at
each site. Both the automatic dilution and manual dilution methods were used for the
VITEK 2 and the manual dilution method was used for the VITEK 2 Compact.
As shown in Table 3, both the auto-dilution and the manual dilution methods for
VITEK 2 and the manual dilution for VITEK 2 Compact were within the expected
range >95% of the time.

The FDA/CLSI Ceftazidime/Avibactam expected ranges for E. coli ATCC 25922 and
E. coli ATCC 35218 are 0.06 – 0.5 and 0.03 – 0.12µg/mL respectively. However, the
VITEK 2 MIC reporting range is ≤0.12 – ≥16 µg/mL (MIC results: ≤0.12, 0.25, 0.5,
1, 2, 4, 8, ≥16 µg/mL). The VITEK 2 systems do not provide results lower than 0.12
µg/mL; therefore, all results for E. coli ATCC 35218 and the lower range value for E.
coli ATCC 25922 are off scale. The quality control test results were considered
acceptable for E. coli ATCC 25922 and E. coli ATCC 35218 when the MIC value of
≤0.12 µg/mL was obtained for these organisms by the VITEK 2 system.
bioMérieux includes the FDA/CLSI broth microdilution expected range in the
labeling when the VITEK 2 system range is not aligned with that of the FDA/CLSI
range. The additional information is acceptable.
In addition, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 is recommended to test against
ceftazidime alone to ensure the presence of the plasmid encoding beta-lactamase
when testing this beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination,
ceftazidime/avibactam. The acceptable result for ceftazidime alone is greater than
16µg/mL. The footnote below is added to the QC section of the Package Insert for
VITEK 2 AST-GN Ceftazidime/Avibactam:
K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 should be tested against Ceftazidime/Avibactam
and Ceftazidime alone to confirm the activity of Avibactam in the combination
and to ensure that the plasmid encoding the beta-lactamase has not been lost in
this strain. The acceptable range for Ceftazidime alone is greater than16 µg/mL.

0.25/4, 1/4, 4/4, and 8/4µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy
in µg/mL). However, the reporting range is ≤ 0.12 – ≥16 μg/mL for
Enterobacteriaceae and ≤ 0.25 – ≥16 μg/mL for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The
reference panel contained two-fold serial dilutions with a range of ≤ 0.0156 to ≥128
µg/mL. The testing conditions for the reference method consisted of the following:
· Medium – Mueller Hinton broth with appropriate dilutions of antimicrobial
solution added
· Inoculum – Direct colony suspension
· Incubation – 35°C ambient air incubator; 16-20 hours
All test inocula used for the evaluation of VITEK 2 AST-GN Ceftazidime/Avibactam
and the reference method were standardized using the DensiCHEK Plus instrument.
The cards were inoculated with each test organism by auto-dilution for reading by the
VITEK 2 System and by manual dilution for reading on the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2
Compact Systems. Reference broth microdilution panels were inoculated in
adherence with CLSI document, M07-A10.
A total of 990 clinical isolates were evaluated at three sites with VITEK 2 AST –
Gram Negative cards inoculated by automatic dilution and interpreted using the
VITEK 2 instrument. There were ten isolates that did not grow in the studies. The no
growth rate was 0.1% (10/990). Most isolates were recently isolated from clinical
specimen (885 isolates, 89.4%). The remainder were stock isolates (105 isolates,
10.6%).
A total of 93 challenge organisms (47 Enterobacteriaceae and 46 P. aeruginosa)
were evaluated at one site. The challenge set was tested with the auto-dilution and
manual dilution options of the VITEK 2 System and with the manual dilution method
on the VITEK 2 Compact System. Overall performance of the clinical and challenge
organisms by auto-dilution is shown in Table 4.1.

† The overall categorical major error rate for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa combined was 1.4% (14/998). Nine
(9) major errors were one dilution apart from the reference method and as such fall within essential agreement. Based on the essential
agreement, and the lack of an intermediate breakpoint for Ceftazidime/Avibactam, the adjusted categorical major error rate is 0.5%
(5/998).
‡EA – Essential Agreement (+/- 1 doubling dilution) Min – Minor discrepancies
CA – Category Agreement Maj – Major discrepancies
EVAL – Evaluable isolates Vmj – Very major discrepancies
R – Resistant isolates
Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the result of the reference method and that of VITEK 2
test card within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on scale for
both the VITEK 2 test card and the reference method. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result
of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the VITEK 2 test card.
The overall performance using the auto-dilution method for the VITEK 2 System
demonstrated an essential agreement of 94.5% and an overall category agreement of
98.7%. The major discrepancy rate was acceptable at 1.4%. However, due to the lack
of intermediate category, the maj discrepancy rate was adjusted and was described in a
footnote:
The overall categorical major error rate for Enterobacteriaceae and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa combined was 1.4% (14/998). Nine (9) major errors
were one dilution apart from the reference method and as such fall within

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Reporting range: ≤0.25/4 – ≥16/4 μg/mL)
When P. aeruginosa data was analyzed separately, it was observed that the major
discrepancy rate for this organism was 4.1% (7/169) and did not meet the acceptance
criterion. Due to the lack of “intermediate” interpretation category, adjusted major
discrepancy rate was calculated taking into consideration the MIC values were within
essential agreement compared to reference MIC. Of the seven maj discrepancies, five

were within essential agreement [i.e. VITEK 2: ≥16 (R), Reference: 8 (S)] which
would have been considered minor discrepancies if there was an “intermediate”
interpretative category for P. aeruginosa. The adjusted major discrepancy rate was
1.2% (2/169) which met the acceptance criterion.
The adjusted P. aeruginosa performance is noted in Table 4.2 below.

Five (5) P. aeruginosa isolates were within essential agreement when compared to the
reference method
The original P. aeruginosa performance with seven major discrepancies was mitigated
by adding a limitation to address the need for repeat testing P. aeruginosa by
alternative/reference methods when the VITEK 2 Systems MIC is ≥16μg/mL. The
limitation is noted below:
Although within Essential Agreement when compared to the reference method,
errors (major and/or very major) were observed due to the lack of intermediate
category. Testing should be repeated using an alternative testing/reference
method prior to reporting results for the following antibiotic/organism(s):
· Ceftazidime/Avibactam: Pseudomonas aeruginosa when the VITEK 2 MIC is
≥16μg/mL due to observed major discrepancies (4.1%), with an adjusted
categorical major error rate of 1.2%.”
For implementation of the repeat testing limitation, bioMerieux indicated that they will
issue a customer communication requesting VITEK 2 users to create a custom
BioART rule in the VITEK 2 System software. Implementation of an indication for
use BioART rule for a U.S. customer will prevent the user from generating a result
when using the AST-GN Ceftazidime/Avibactam test for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The indication for use and limitation BioART rule will be pre-defined in the VITEK 2
System software in the next software update.
MIC Trends:
The claimed Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae organisms were also
evaluated for trending. This trending calculation takes into account MIC values that
are determined to be ≤1 and ≥1 doubling dilutions compared to the reference method
irrespective whether the device MIC values are on-scale or not. The trending analysis
is shown in Table 4.3 below.

A trend towards higher MIC was observed with Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa
isolates when compared to the CLSI broth microdilution reference method. This
trending and the potential for occurrence of major discrepancies for
Ceftazidime/Avibactam when testing clinical and challenge isolate results with the
VITEK 2 GN Ceftazidime/Avibactam was addressed by adding the following footnote
to the performance table for Ceftazidime/Avibactam in the device labeling (Table 127:
Performance Characteristics for Gram-Negative Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing,
VITEK 2 Product Information Manual).
VITEK 2 Ceftazidime/Avibactam MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or
at least one doubling dilution higher when testing Enterobacteriaceae and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa compared to the reference broth micro-dilution.
Challenge Data – Auto and Manual Dilution:
The challenge set of 93 isolates (47 Enterobacteriaceae and 46 Pseudomonas
aeruginosa) was evaluated at one site. The challenge set was tested with both the auto-
dilution and manual dilution options of the VITEK 2 System and with the manual
dilution method on the VITEK 2 Compact System.
Overall performance is shown in Table 5.

test on both the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems was acceptable.
Enzyme Group Characterization/Resistance Markers Information
Enterobacteriaceae with beta-lactamases were included in the ceftazidime/avibactam
comparative studies. They were KPC (6), CTX-M (4), TEM (11), SHV (12) and
plasmid mediated AmpC (4). The Enterobacteriaceae were Klebsiella pneumoniae, E.
coli, and Enterobacter cloacae. The study showed susceptibility to
Ceftazidime/Avibactam with VITEK2 MIC values range from 0.5/4 to 2/4 µg/mL.
Additionally, seven P. aeruginosa with beta-lactamases AmpC variants PDC (7), KPC
(1), GES (1), VEB (1), and outer membrane porin loss OprD (7) were tested. Two
isolates demonstrated resistance of ≥16/4 µg/mL and five isolates showed
susceptibility ranging from 2/4 to 8/4 µg/mL. The following footnote was added to the
ceftazidime/avibactam labeling regarding other resistance markers and enzyme
characterization:
Ø Enzyme group characterization was not available for the following
organisms at the time of comparative testing, and therefore the performance
of the AST card with Ceftazidime/Avibactam is unknown:
Enterobacteriaceae (OXA, metallo-beta-lactamases); Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (metallo-beta-lactamases).
Ø Ceftazidime/Avibactam is not active against bacteria that produce metallo
beta-lactamase enzymes and may not have activity against Gram-negative
bacteria that overexpress efflux pumps or have porin mutations.
