2. Indication(s) for use:
The skyla Hi Hemoglobin A1c System, consisting of the skyla Hi Analyzer and skyla Hi
Hemoglobin A1c Reagent Kit is an in-vitro diagnostic test for quantitative measurement
of the percent concentration (%) of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c %) in venous and
finger-stick capillary whole blood.
The measurement of % HbA1c is used to monitor long-term glycemic control in persons
previously diagnosed with diabetes mellitus.
This system is intended for clinical laboratory and point-of-care use.
This test is not for screening or diagnosis of diabetes.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
·
This test is not for screening or diagnosis of diabetes or neonatal use
·
Use fresh whole blood only. Do not use plasma and serum.
·
When testing venous whole blood, test only samples collected in K3-EDTA
·
The test is not intended for judging day-to-day glucose control and should not be used
·
to replace daily home testing of urine or blood glucose.
This test should not be used for analyzing samples from patients with conditions
·
causing shortened red blood cell survival, such as hemolytic diseases, homozygous
sickle cell trait, pregnancy and significant acute or chronic blood loss
Hemoglobinopathies may interfere with glycated hemoglobin analysis. The results
·
from the skyla Hi Hemoglobin A1c show that there is no significant interference for
Hemoglobin C (≤ 36%), Hemoglobin D (≤ 42%), Hemoglobin E (≤ 26%),
Hemoglobin S (≤ 41%). High Hemoglobin F (> 11%) will result in lower than
expected HbA1c values. High HbA2 (>5.7%) will result in higher than expected
expected HbA1c values.
4. Special instrument requirements:

L. Test Principle:
The assay principle is based on immunoturbidimetric measurement of a monoclonal antibody
agglutination reaction. Through a latex reagent, all hemoglobin can nonspecifically adhere to
a latex sphere. Following addition of the HbA1c specific monoclonal antibody, the latex
sphere will produce agglutination reaction, and the agglutination causes increased scattering
of light, which is measured as an increase in absorbance at 650 nm. The HbA1c
concentration is then quantified using a calibration curve of absorbance versus HbA1c
concentration.

were three operators at each site, for a total of nine operators. At each site, the
samples were measured in duplicate two times a day twice a day for 20 days at three
sites. Within run (repeatability), between-run, between day, and total reproducibility
(SD and percent CVs) were calculated. Each site had 80 results for a total of 240
results per sample across all three sites.
Each POC site assessed one lot of skyla Hi Hemoglobin A1c Reagent Kit using one
skyla Hi HbA1c analyzer, for a total of three lots and three analyzers at three sites.
Three quality control (QC) samples and five human venous whole blood (WB)
samples (K3-EDTA) were tested.
The within-run, between-run, between-day and total precision were calculated (SD
and %CV), for each site and all three sites. The results are summarized below in

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated according to CLSI EP06-A. Test sample pools were prepared
by diluting test sample pools of human venous whole blood (WB) samples (K3-
EDTA) containing high (15%) and low (4.1%) concentrations of HbA1c to create
nine levels of test sample pools. The assigned value of each of the nine (9) levels was
determined by a clinical lab. Each test sample pool was tested in quadruplicate with
one reagent lot using the skyla Hi Hemoglobin A1c System, and then analyzed using
the best-fitting polynomial. The targeted assigned values of each level were measured
by a clinical lab. The deviation between polynomial fit and line fit results were
determined. The following concentrations of HbA1c were tested.
NGSP Units (% HbA1c)
No. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
%
HbA1c 4.1 6.4 7.9 9.4 10.8 12.0 13.0 14.1 15
Conc.
The linear regression results are in the table below:
NGSP Units (%HbA1c)
Regression Claimed
Slope Intercept Coefficient Measuring
(R2) Interval
0.9665 0.3506 0.9939 4-14% HbA1c
The linearity results support the sponsor’s claims that the assay is linear across the
reportable measuring interval of 4 to 14% HbA1c.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The skyla Hi Hemoglobin A1c Reagent Kit is traceable to the Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial Reference Method. The device is certified with the National
Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). The certification expires in one
year. See NGSP website for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) were determined in accordance
with CLSI EP17-A. The LoB and LoD values were determined by measuring 180 blank
measurements and 180 low-level HbA1c measurement. To determine LoB and LoD, 5
blank and 5 whole blood low level samples each were tested using 2 reagent lots and 1
instrument system. Testing was performed for 3 days at 4 replicates per day for a total of
60 measurements per reagent lot (120 measurements total per LoB and LoD). The LoB
and LoD results are listed below:

e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interferences
An interference study was performed using the skyla Hi Hemoglobin A1c System to
assess the effect of common endogenous interferents. The interference study was
conducted according to CLSI guideline EP07-A2. One lot of skyla Hi Hemoglobin A1c
Reagent Kit and 1 skyla Hi Analyzer was used in the study. The sample pool material
was K3-EDTA venous whole blood with a concentration of approximately 5-6 % HbA1c
and approximately 9-10% HbA1c. Two sample pools were prepared for each potential
endogenous interferent, with or without interferent (serving as the reference or control
sample). The spiked and control pools were mixed in different ratios to yield a dilution
series with varying concentrations of the interferent. Each sample was tested in triplicate
and the mean value was used for the assessment. The sponsor defined non-significant
interference ≤± 6% deviation compared to the result of the control pool. The table below

Cross-Reactivity with Hemoglobin Derivatives
A study was performed using the skyla Hi Hemoglobin A1c System to assess the effect
of hemoglobin derivatives on measurement of HbA1c. One lot of skyla Hi Hemoglobin
A1c Reagent Kit and one skyla Hi Analyzer was used in the study. The sample pool
material was K3-EDTA venous whole blood with a concentration of approximately 5-6
% HbA1c and approximately 9-10% HbA1c. Two sample pools were prepared for each
potential endogenous interferent, with or without interferent (serving as the reference or
control sample). The spiked and control pools were mixed in different ratios to yield a
dilution series with varying concentrations of the hemoglobin derivatives. Each sample
was tested in triplicate and the mean value was used for the assessment. The sponsor
defined non-significant interference ≤± 6% deviation compared to the result of the
reference pool. The table below summarizes the results of this study:

Hemoglobin Variant Interference
A study was performed using the skyla Hi Hemoglobin A1c Sytem to assess the effect
of common hemoglobin variants on the measurement of HbA1c. One lot of skyla Hi
Hemoglobin A1c Reagent Kit and one skyla Hi Analyzer was used in the study. 55
venous whole blood samples with known target values of HbA1c and variant
concentrations (assigned by IFCC and NGSP) were tested in duplicate. The venous
whole blood samples (concentrations ranging between 4.1 and 14.0% HbA1c) contained
known levels of hemoglobin variants A2, C, D, E, F and S. Between 4 and 11 samples
per hemoglobin variant were tested in duplicate using the skyla Hi Hemoglobin A1c
System for %HbA1c results. The sponsor defined non-significant interference ≤± 7%
deviation compared to the result of the assigned value. The table below summarizes the
results of this study:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was conducted at four point of care testing sites. Venous
K3-EDTA whole blood and capillary finger-stick blood samples were collected from
each patient (n=243 venous whole blood and n=243 capillary finger-stick samples)
and tested in singlicate using the skyla Hi Hemoglobin A1c System (five analyzers)
and compared to matched venous K3-EDTA venous whole blood measured using the
Bio-Rad VARIANT II Turbo System in a clinical laboratory. Each of the four point-
of-care sites included between three and five operators, for a total of 16 operators.
Between one to four reagent kit lots were used at each site for this study. The range of
HbA1c tested was 4.8 to 13.2% HbA1c. The best fit linear regression results are
listed in the tables below in NGSP Units (%HbA1c):

and collected using the glass capillary tube on the reagent pack. After application of the
sample to the reagent pack capillary, the operator places the reagent pack into the
analysis cartridge. The cartridge is then inserted into the instrument. There are no pre-
analytical steps needed after the blood sample is taken using the sample capillary.
5. Calibration:
The analyzer automatically reads in the lot-specific calibration data from the barcode
information printed on the analysis cartridge, eliminating the need for calibration by the
user
