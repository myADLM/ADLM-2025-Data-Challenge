Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose Test Systems for Over-the-Counter-Use: Guidance for
Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff. Issued: October 11, 2016.
CLSI EP07-A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline - Second
Edition (2005).
IEC 60601-1, Medical electrical equipment - Part 1: General requirements for basic safety
and essential performance.
L. Test Principle:
The system measures glucose amperometrically. The reaction of glucose oxidase and
potassium ferricyanide in the test strip with glucose in the sample produces an electrical
current which is proportional to the amount of glucose in the sample. The meter measures the
current and converts it to the corresponding glucose concentration, which is displayed on the
meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The only differences between the RIGHTEST Wiz and the RIGHTEST Wiz Plus Blood
Glucose Monitoring Systems are the names of the systems and meters and the addition of a
Bluetooth communication module to the RIGHTEST Wiz Plus meter. All performance
evaluations below were performed using the RIGHTEST Wiz Plus system to represent both
systems.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision studies were performed using venous whole blood samples of 5
glucose levels (30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250, 251-400 mg/dL). Samples were
tested ten times with each of three lots of single test strips with 10 meters for a total
of 300 tests per glucose concentration. Results are summarized below:

Intermediate (between run) precision was evaluated using five levels of glucose
control solutions, 3 test strip lots, and 10 meters. Each control solution level was
measured once a day for 10 days with each meter and test strip lot, for a total of 100
replicates per control solution level per test strip lot for a total of 300 replicates for
each glucose control level. Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was assessed with three lots of Blood Glucose Test Strip GS570. Each test
strip lot was tested with three Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems Wiz Plus
using blood samples spiked to 14 target analyte levels (18.6, 29.2, 62.8, 104.0, 160.5,
225.0, 277, 325.5, 365.5, 413, 449.5, 544, 569, 612.5 mg/dL). Each sample was
measured in triplicate with each Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM570
and measured in duplicate with a laboratory-based comparator method (YSI 2300
glucose analyzer). The evaluation yielded the following regression equations for the
three lots based on all samples:
Lot 1: y = 0.9922x + 1.1243, R2= 0.9996
Lot 2: y = 0.9927x + 1.2096, R2= 0.9996
Lot 3: y = 0.9936x + 1.1132, R2= 0.9996

Lots combined: y = 0.9921x + 1.4666, R2 = 0.9995
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 20-
600 mg/dL. The meter displays “Lo” with glucose values below 20mg/dL, and “HI”
with glucose values over 600 mg/dL. The “Lo” and “Hi” functions were validated and
demonstrated to function as intended.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System Wiz and Rightest Blood Glucose
Monitoring System Wiz Plus traceable to the NIST SRM 917c glucose reference
material.
Test Strip Stability
Test Strips are identical to the strip that were cleared in k170143. The claimed shelf
life stability and open vial stability is 24 months from manufacture when stored at 40-
86 °F (4-30 °C) and 10-90% relative humidity in k170143.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity in section M1b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference was evaluated at three glucose concentration intervals (60-100, 100-150,
and 250-300 mg/dL) by analyzing 26 potentially interfering exogenous and
endogenous substances. Average glucose values measured with the Rightest Blood
Glucose Monitoring System Wiz Plus in samples spiked with a potentially interfering
substance were compared with average values measured in control samples (without
potentially interfering substance) on the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System
Wiz Plus. The sponsor defined significant interference as bias greater than ±10% (vs
control condition). The compounds at the concentrations listed below were the
highest concentrations tested that did not demonstrate significant interference:

Based on the results, the sponsor includes the following in their test strip labeling:
- If you are taking high dose of vitamin C (blood concentration > 3 mg/dL), the
result from your meter may not be correct.
- If you have a condition that may cause your blood Bilirubin-conjugated level to
increase more than 10 mg/dL, such as liver disease or jaundice, then the results
from your meter may not be correct.
- If you have a condition that may cause your blood levels of uric acid to increase
more than 11.8 mg/dL, such as kidney disease or gout, then the results from
your meter may not be correct.

1. Sample Volume Study
To evaluate the minimum sample volume of the blood glucose test strips, a study was
performed using 3 lots of test strips, venous blood samples at 3 glucose concentrations
(50-65 mg/dL, 100-120 mg/dL and 200-250 mg/dL) and the following 9 sample volumes;
0.60µL, 0.65µL, 0.70 µL, 0.75 µL, 0.80 µL, 1.00 µL, 1.25 µL, 2.00 µL and 3.00 µL. Test
procedures were performed in 3 replicates, and results were compared to reference
method YSI 2300 Analyzer. The study results supported the claimed minimum sample
volume of 0.75 µL and that the sample volume detection feature functioned as intended.
2. Altitude Study
To evaluate the effects of altitude on system performance, three test strip lots were tested
with three meters using three venous blood samples with glucose concentration of 50-
75mg/dL, 80-120 mg/dL and 270-330 mg/dL. The samples were tested at 0, 3281, 6562
and 9843 feet above sea leavel. Results obtained were compared with those obtained with
an established laboratory reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The results demonstrate
acceptable bias relative to the reference method to support the claim in the labeling that
the system can be used at altitudes up to 10,000 ft. (3275 meters).
3. Hematocrit Study
To evaluate the effect of different hematocrit levels on system performance, 10 meters
were used to test venous blood with nine HCT levels of 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%,
45%, 50%, 55% and 60%. HCT levels where tested over five glucose concentrations of
30-50mg/dL, 51-110 mg/dL, 111-150 mg/dL, 151-250 mg/dL and 251-400 mg/dL.
Results of samples at each hematocrit level were compared to samples measured with an
established laboratory reference method (YSI) and support the claimed hematocrit range
of 20-60%.
4. Test System Operating Conditions
To evaluate the effect of different environmental operating coditions on the system, three
devices where tested at six different operating conditions. Three different temperatures (
10-11ºC, 25±2ºC and 39-40ºC) each at two different relative humidity levels (10% and
90%). The results of this study supported the sponsor’s claimed operating conditions of
50°F-104°F and a relative humidity range of 10% to 90%.
5. EMC Testing
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing
(EMC) had been performed and the device system was found compliant.
6. Infection Control Studies
The devices are intended for a single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed on the materials comprising the outer meter, including polycarbonate and
acrylonitirile butadiene styrene. The studies were conducted by an outside commercial
testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with
the chosen disinfectant, CaviWipes Disinfecting Towelettes (EPA registration number
46781-8). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that
12

there was no change in performance or external materials of the meter. The robustness
studies were designed to simulate cleaning and disinfection procedure twice a week for
five years for a total of 520 cycles. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for
the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
