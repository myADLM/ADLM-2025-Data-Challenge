I. Device Description:
The six systems in this submission, the VivaChek Ino Smart, the VivaChek Ino Sync, the
VivaChek Ino Sound, the VivaChek Ino Plus, the VivaChek Ino Sound Simple, and the
VivaChek Ino Sound Bright Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are intended to
quantitatively measure the glucose concentration in fresh capillary whole blood. The
glucose measurement is achieved by using the amperometric detection method. The test is
based on measurement of electrical current caused by the reaction of the glucose with the
reagents on the electrode of the test strip. The blood sample is pulled into the tip of the test
strip through capillary action. Glucose in the sample reacts with glucose enzyme and the
mediator. Electrons are generated, producing a current that is positive correlation to the
glucose concentration in the sample. After the reaction time, the glucose concentration in
the sample is displayed. The meter is calibrated to display plasma-like concentration results.
The same test strips, the VivaChek Ino Blood Glucose Test Strips (VGS01) are used with
each of the meters in this submission, the VivaChek Ino Smart (VGM04), VivaChek Ino
Sync (VGM05), VivaChek Ino Sound (VGM09), VivaChek Ino Plus (VGM22), VivaChek
Ino Sound Simple (VGM26), and VivaChek Ino Sound Bright (VGM27) Blood Glucose
Meters to measure the glucose level in fresh capillary whole blood. VivaChek Control
Solutions are aqueous solutions containing glucose and are available at three levels (level 1,
level 2 and level 3) and are compatible for use with each system.
All of the devices in this 510(k) submission employ the same device technology and have
the same intended use. The devices differ in minor design features and certain user
functions. For example, the VGM04, VGM05, VGM09, and VGM22 meter models contain
Bluetooth functionality for transferring glucose results to a compatible mobile device, and
the VGM09, VGM26, and VGM27 meter models contain a talking functionality. Other
4

--- Page 5 ---
features that differ between meters are minor features such as presence or absence of a
backlight, strip ejector port, or rechargeable batteries.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose Test Systems for Over-the-Counter Use, Guidance for
Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff. October 11, 2016.
L. Test Principle:
The VivaChek Ino Smart Blood Glucose Monitoring System, VivaChek Ino Sync Blood
Glucose Monitoring System, VivaChek Ino Sound Blood Glucose Monitoring System,
VivaChek Ino Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System, VivaChek Ino Sound Simple Blood
Glucose Monitoring System, and VivaChek Ino Sound Bright Blood Glucose Monitoring
System are systems for the quantitative detection of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood
from the fingertip. Amperometric technology is used for the detection of glucose from
testing the strip (with whole blood sample) on the meter. Reagent consisting of glucose
oxidase and mediator is deposited onto the reaction cell section of the test strip with printed
electrodes. When a drop of whole blood sample is applied to the reaction cell on the test
strip, glucose in the blood sample reacts in the presence of glucose oxidase and mediator,
and the reaction yields electrons. Thus, a current signal is produced from the reaction and
detected by the meter. The detected current signal is then calculated by the meter, and
glucose concentration reading is then displayed on the meter display.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Unless otherwise noted, the analytical studies detailed below were performed with the
VivaChek Ino Smart Blood Glucose Monitoring System. As the only differences between the
six meters in this submission are minor design features, as described above in Device
Description (Section I), the analytical studies performed with the VivaChek Ino Smart Blood
Glucose Monitoring System are representative of the performance for all devices in this
510(k) submission.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability (within-run precision):
The sponsor performed repeatability (within-day) precision studies using venous
whole blood adjusted to 5 different glucose concentration levels (30 to 50, 51 to 110,
111 to 150, 151 to 250, and 251 to 400 mg/dL). Each glucose concentration level was
analyzed in replicates of 10, with 3 test strip lots, and 10 meters, for a total of 300
tests per glucose level for each meter. Results are summarized below:

481.0, 541.6, 595.0 mg/dL. Each sample was measured in replicates of four using
each of three lots of test strips and the mean was used in the regression analysis. The
regression analysis results are summarized in the table below:
Lot Slope y-intercept R2
1 0.9983 0.0150 0.9986
2 0.9852 2.4035 0.9974
3 1.0052 -2.2806 0.9982
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 20
– 600 mg/dL. If a sample is less than 20 mg/dL glucose, the result is flagged by the
meter as LO. If a sample result exceeds 600 mg/dL glucose, the result is flagged by
the meter as HI. The LO and HI functions were validated and demonstrated to
function as intended.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The system is traceable to NIST SRM #917b glucose reference material. A method
comparison was performed using the candidate device and YSI 2300 as the reference
method. The meter provides plasma-equivalent results.
Test Strip Stability:
Test strip stability was assessed using accelerated and real time stability studies.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable. The labeling
includes claims that the VivaChek Ino Test Strips are stable for 4 months after
opening and 24 months unopened when stored between of 36ºF to 86ºF (2ºC-30ºC)
and 10-90% relative humidity.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range for the VivaChek Blood Glucose Monitoring System is 20 to
600 mg/dL supported by the linearity assay study above (M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
To assess potential interferences, the sponsor used venous whole blood samples
adjusted to 3 glucose concentration ranges: 50-70, 110-130, and 225-270 mg/dL.
Each of these samples was divided into a test pool and a control pool, with each of the
potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances added to the test pool.
The % difference between the test sample and the control sample was calculated
using mean of 10 replicates for each of the 3 strip lots tested. The compounds at the
concentrations listed below did not have significant interference (defined by the
sponsor as average bias between spiked and control sample glucose results within ±
8

User Performance Study:
To assess the performance of the VivaChek Ino Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems
in the hands of the intended users, the sponsor performed four independent studies
that each included a minimum of 350 lay users with the VivaChek Ino Smart
(VGM04), VivaChek Ino Sound (VGM09), VivaChek Ino Plus (VGM22), and
VivaChek Ino Sound Simple (VGM26) Blood Glucose Meters (see Section I Device
Description for a description of the minor differences between each meter). Each
study included lay users that were provided with the device labeling, collected their
own fingerstick sample, and obtained results on a VivaChek Ino meter. After the tests
were completed by the lay user, additional blood samples were collected from each
subject by a professional for testing with the comparator method, YSI 2300. There
were no significant differences demonstrated in performance between the four lay
user studies completed. As representative performance, the results from the most
complex system (e.g. presence of talking feature, bluetooth function, backlight, strip
ejector etc.), the VivaChek Ino Sound Blood Glucose Monitoring System (VGM09),
are summarized in the tables below:

Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The system is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger. The whole
blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
Calibration is automatic. There is no user input for coding.
6. Quality Control:
VivaChek Control Solutions are aqueous solutions containing glucose and are available
at three levels (level 1, level 2 and level 3). Instructions on how to order the control
solutions are included in the user manual. The control solution readings are not included
in the average of the patient results. An acceptable range for each control level is printed
on the test strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result
falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study:
To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the VivaChek Ino Blood Glucose Monitoring
System, venous blood samples with hematocrit levels of 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%,
45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, and 70% were tested at 5 glucose concentrations (50, 90,
130, 200, and 330 mg/dL). Each sample was tested in replicates of 10 test strips per strip
lot, with a total of 3 lots of testes strips tested. Results from the meter were compared to
results obtained using a laboratory-based comparator method (YSI 2300). The evaluation
of bias relative to the comparator method demonstrated acceptable performance to
support the claimed hematocrit range of 20-70%.

2. Altitude Study:
To evaluate the effect of altitude on the VivaChek Ino Blood Glucose Monitoring
System, meters were tested at sea level and 13,123 feet. The evaluation included 3 test
strip lots and the glucose range tested was 52 to 538 mg/dL. Results at each altitude were
compared to the comparator method, YSI 2300. Results demonstrated that altitudes up to
13,123 feet above sea level have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements.
3. Sample Volume Study:
The sponsor performed a study to support the claimed minimum sample volume for the
VivaChek Ino Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Venous whole blood samples were
tested at 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 µL at thee glucose levels (60, 110, and 230 mg/dL) as
established by the YSI 2300 comparator method. Each sample was tested in duplicate on
two meters using 3 test strip lots. Results support the claimed minimum sample volume
of 0.8µL. The sponsor provided validation studies demonstrating that with blood volumes
below 0.8 μL, the insufficient sample volume error message functioned as intended.
4. Operating Conditions Study:
The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous blood samples
with three glucose levels (60-70, 100-120, and 300-400 mg/dL). Temperatures ranging
from 41°F - 113°F (5-45°C) and relative humidity from 10% to 90% were tested. Meter
results were compared to the YSI 2300 comparator analyzer. Four temperature and
humidity combinations were tested including low temperature/low humidity, low
temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low humidity and high temperature/high
humidity. The results support the claims in the labeling that the system can be used in
conditions of 41°F - 113°F (5-45°C) with relative humidity of 10 to 90%.
5. Flex Studies:
Intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, testing with used test strips, drop/shock
testing, and vibration testing was completed. The testing performed demonstrated that the
VivaChek Ino Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are robust to intermittent sampling,
sample perturbation, drop/shock, and vibration, and that an error message is returned to
the user if a used test strip is inserted into the meter.
6. EMC Testing:
The sponsor provided appropriate documentation certifying that acceptable
electromagnetic testing (EMC) had been performed for each device in this 510(k)
submission and that they were compliant.
7. Infection Control Studies:
The six VivaChek Ino systems in this submission are intended for single-patient use only.
Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meters by
an outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis
B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Clorox Germicidal Wipes, 0.55% sodium
hypochlorite (EPA Registration # 67619-12). Robustness studies were also performed by
the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials
of the meter after 608 cleanings and disinfection cycles with the Clorox Germicidal
14

--- Page 15 ---
Wipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 5 years of single-patient use.
Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and
disinfection procedures.
8. Test Strip Lot Release Protocol:
The test strip lot release protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
