H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Refer to Indications for Use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The DRI Hydrocodone Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay for the qualitative and/or
semi-quantitative determination of the presence of hydrocodone and its metabolites in human
urine at a cutoff concentration of 300 ng/mL. The assay is intended to be used in laboratories and
provides a simple and rapid analytical screening procedure to detect hydrocodone and its
metabolites in human urine. The assay is designed for use with a number of clinical chemistry
analyzers.
The semi-quantitative mode is for the purpose of enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as liquid
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or permitting laboratories to establish
quality control procedures. The assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more
specific alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
chromatography/ mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or liquid chromatography/tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Performance characteristics provided in this submission were determined on the Indiko Plus
Analyzer.
I. Device Description:
The DRI Hydrocodone assay is supplied as a liquid ready-to-use homogeneous enzyme
immunoassay, comprised of two reagents (Reagent A and Reagent E) which are bottled separately
but sold together within the same kit.
Reagent A: Contains mouse monoclonal anti-Hydrocodone antibody, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P),
and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in Tris buffer with sodium azide as a preservative.
Reagent E: Contains Hydrocodone derivative labeled with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PDH) in Tris buffer with sodium azide as a preservative.

L. Test Principle:
The DRI Hydrocodone Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay. The assay uses specific
antibodies that can detect Hydrocodone and its metabolites. The assay is based on competition
between a drug labeled with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and free drug from
the urine sample, for a fixed amount of specific antibody binding sites. In the absence of free
drug from the sample, mouse monoclonal anti-hydrocodone antibody binds to the drug labeled
with G6PDH and causes a decrease in enzyme activity. In the presence of free drug, the free
drug occupies the antibody binding sites, allowing the drug bound G6PDH to interact with the
substrate, resulting in enzyme activity. This phenomenon creates a direct proportional
relationship between the drug concentration in urine and enzyme activity. The enzyme activity is
determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by measuring the conversion of nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed following CLSI EP5‐A3. Drug free urine samples were
spiked with hydrocodone at 0, 75, 150, 225, 300, 375, 450, 525 and 600 ng/mL, representing
0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175 and 200% of the device cutoff (300 ng/mL). Each level
sample was tested in duplicate per run, two runs per day for twenty consecutive days (total
n= 80/level/reagent lot) using 2 lots on one Indiko Plus analyzer in both qualitative and semi-
quantitative modes. The results of one representative lot are shown below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A drug recovery study in the semi-quantitative mode was conducted by spiking a
drug free urine pool with hydrocodone and using serial dilutions with a negative urine
pool to achieve concentrations ranging from 100 ng/mL to 1000ng/mL, and testing
each level on one lot of reagent, calibrators and controls. Each concentration was
tested in five replicates on the Indiko Plus analyzer. The mean of the five replicates
tested was defined as the observed drug concentration value. The percent recovery
range was defined as the range in observed percent recoveries amongst the five
replicates at each concentration. The results of are summarized below:

pH: Drug free urine specimens spiked with 225 or 375 ng/mL of hydrocodone were
adjusted to varying pH (between pH 4.0 and pH 10.0). Samples were tested in
replicates of five (n=5) in both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. No positive
or negative interference was observed at urine pH values ranging from 4.0 to 10.0 for
each test mode.
Specific Gravity: Urine with specific gravity spanning the range within 1.003–1.031
was spiked with 225 and 375 ng/mL of hydrocodone. Samples were tested in
replicates of five (n=5) in both qualitative and semi-quantitative. No positive or
negative interference was observed at urine specific gravity values ranging from
1.003 to 1.031 in either test mode.
Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration of 300 ng/mL hydrocodone is described in the precision section, M.1.a.
above.
2. Comparison studies:
