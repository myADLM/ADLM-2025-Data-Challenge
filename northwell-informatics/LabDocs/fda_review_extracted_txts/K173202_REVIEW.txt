CP3000 Coagulation Analyzer
I. Device Description:
CP3000 Coagulation Analyzer
The CP3000 is an automated blood coagulation instrument which performs tests for specific
parameters in citrated human plasma. The CP3000 system is capable of performing
chromogenic assays, which allows analysis for both direct hemostasis measurements and
calculated parameters. For this assay methodology, the analyzer employs two photometric
detection methods: light scattering and absorbance. The light scattering method uses light
emitting diodes at a wavelength of 660 nm, and the absorbance method uses a halogen lamp
with filters providing wavelengths at 405, 570, and 730 nm. The analyzer components
include the analyzer hardware and its controlling software (firmware), a personal computer
(PC) with its user interface, result calculations, and patient data management software. The
PC also provides the software to communicate with the host Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
Coagpia AT Reagent
Coagpia AT Reagent is intended for the quantitative determination of antithrombin (AT)
activity in human plasma on the CP3000 analyzer. R1 contains bovine Factor Xa, heparin
sodium salt (porcine), buffer, surfactant and preservative. R2 contains a protease substrate N-
acetyl-D-arginyl-glycyl-L-arginyl-p-nitroanilide, buffer, surfactant and preservative. Both
reagents are liquid and do not require any preparation prior to use.
Coagpia Calibrator
The Coagpia Calibrator is lyophilized human plasma and is suitable for the calibration of
the antithrombin activity assay using Coagpia AT Reagent on the CP3000 coagulation
analyzer.
Coagpia Control Set
The Coagpia Control Set is lyophilized human plasma supplied as two levels (Level 1 Control
and Level 2 Control) and is suitable for use with the antithrombin activity assay using
Coagpia AT Reagent on the CP3000 analyzer.

L. Test Principle:
Antithrombin concentration is determined by incubating plasma with an excess of bovine
Factor-Xa (FXa) in the presence of heparin. The heparin binds to and causes a
conformational change in the structure of antithrombin significantly increasing its inhibitory
activity. This results from the AT/heparin complex binding to FXa, forming an inactive
complex (AT/heparin/FXa). The chromogenic substrate specific for FXa is then added and
any residual FXa cleaves the substrate which results in a color change of the substrate. Since
the residual activity of FXa reflects the activity of antithrombin, the antithrombin activity of
a sample can be determined by colorimetric measurement of released p-nitroaniline (pNA) on
the CP3000 analyzer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The repeatability of the Coagpia Antithrombin (AT) Assay, Calibrator and Control
were evaluated on three CP3000 coagulation analyzers according to CLSI EP05-A3
guideline.

--- Page 9 ---
For the repeatability study, three lots of the Coagpia AT reagents were tested on three
instruments. For each lot of reagent, the same set of six levels of human citrated
plasma covering the AMR were tested. Each sample run, was tested in duplicate with
two runs per day for 20 non-consecutive days. Within-run, between-run, between-lot,
between-day, between-instrument and total precision were calculated. The pre-
defined acceptance criteria for within-run, between-run, between-lot, between-day,
and between-instrument were met.
Reproducibility:
A multi-site precision study was performed on the CP3000 analyzer at three sites.
Six-levels of citrated plasma samples covering the AMR were tested in three
replicates per run with two runs per day for five non-consecutive days. Three lots of
reagents was tested across three testing sites on three CP3000 analyzers, for a total of
N=270 replicates for each level tested. Within-run, between-run, between-lot,
between-day, within-site, between-site, and total precision were calculated. All
results met the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity
A linearity study was conducted with three lots of Coagpia AT Reagent on the
CP3000 analyzer. High antithrombin (AT) concentration plasma was diluted with AT
deficient plasma to create a total of 12 samples covering the concentration of the pre-
specified linearity range for AT. The linearity samples were tested with Coagpia AT
Assay in quadruplicate. For each sample, deviation between the linear regression
model (predicted value from 1st order regression) and the best fitting polynomial
regression model was calculated. Linearity was achieved through polynomial
regression. The results showed that the linearity of all three lots of Coagpia
Antithrombin reagent met the pre-determined design goal of 20–135%. The linear
range for the Coagpia AT assay was determined to be 14–140 %.
Reportable Range/Clinical Reportable Range
A reportable range study was conducted to determine the upper limit of the
measurable range of the assay. The Auto Dilution (auto-rerun as defined in the system

software) function was turned on for this study. High AT plasma (pooled plasma) was
diluted with AT deficient plasma to create the sample concentration required for this
evaluation. Twelve samples within 12 different dilution ratios were measured in
quadruplicate using three lots of Coagpia AT Reagent. Percent difference (Recovery)
to the theoretical value was calculated for each measurement result. The data
supported the design goal of 150%. Lower limit of 14% has been determined by the
result of lower limit of the linearity. Therefore, the reportable range for the Coagpia
Antithrombin assay is 14–150%.

Accelerated Stability for Reagents
Three lots of Coagpia AT reagents were used to determine the accelerated stability.
Reagents from each lot were kept in incubators at 31°C, 37°C and 45°C for the
accelerated stability. At the indicated time points (4, 9, 16, 22, and 27 days), the
Coagpia AT reagents were removed from the incubators and evaluated by testing four
citrated human plasma samples at AT concentrations of 30%, 80%, 100% and 150%
after each calibration. The results met the pre-defined acceptance criteria, and support
the shelf-life claim of 2 years at 2–8°C.
Real-time Stability for Reagents
Three lots of Coagpia AT reagents were used to determine real-time stability. The
reagents from each lot were kept at 2–8°C. At the indicated time points (0, 3, 7, 13,
19, 24, and 25 months), the Coagpia AT reagents were removed from the incubators
and evaluated by testing four citrated human plasma samples at AT concentrations of
30%, 80%, 100% and 150%. The real-time stability study has been completed up to 8
months for the Coagpia AT Reagent, and support a 7-month real-time stability claim.
Transportation Stability for Reagents
One lot of Coagpia AT reagent was used to evaluate transportation stability. The
reagents were stored for 5 days at 10–12°C and 5 days at 1.8–2.2°C to simulate
different shipping temperatures. After the incubation, reagents were stored at 2–8°C
at each time point. At the indicated time (0, 3, 7, 13, 19, 24, and 25 months), the
Coagpia AT reagents were removed from the incubators and evaluated by testing four
citrated human plasma samples at AT concentrations of 30%, 80%, 100% and 150%.
The real-time study has been completed up to 8 months for Coagpia AT Reagent. The
data supports 7 months of real-time stability for Coagpia AT reagents.
Real-time Stability and Transportation Stability for Coagpia Calibrator and Coagpia
Controls
Real-time stability testing and transportation testing for the Coagpia Calibrator and
Coagpia Controls were conducted in a similar manner to that of the Coagpia AT
reagents. The real-time stability study and transportation stability has been completed
up to 13 months for Coagpia Calibrator and Coagpia Controls. The data supports 7
months of real-time stability for Coagpia Calibrator and Coagpia Controls.
Sample Stability (at room temperature)
Sample stability study using Coagpia AT Reagent on CP3000 analyzer was
conducted for fresh plasma samples stored at room temperature. Forty-three fresh
plasma samples were tested in quadruplicate within an hour of specimen collection in
a vacuum blood collection tube. The remaining samples were recapped and stored at
room temperature (18–25ºC), and tested in quadruplicate at 2, 4, 6, 8, 24 and 26 hours
after collection. For each time point, results were compared to the respective baseline
(zero (0) hour) result. The data at each time point met the acceptance criteria. The
data support a citrated plasma sample stability claim of 4 hours at room temperature
for the Coagpia AT Reagent on the CP3000 analyzer.

Fresh/frozen Stability
To validate the fresh/frozen sample stability claim on the CP3000 analyzer with the
Coagpia AT reagent, 60 plasma samples covering the linear range for the
antithrombin assay were frozen in aliquots at -20°C and -80°C within 4 hours of
collection. Time points tested for the -20°C and -80°C samples included day 0
(baseline), 2 weeks, 3 weeks and day 0 (baseline), 4 months, 6 months and 7 months,
respectively. For each time point, samples were run in duplicate. The data support
that plasma samples stored at -20°C and -80°C are stable up to 2 weeks and 6 months,
respectively.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of blank (LoB) was determined using five analyte-free samples. Samples were
measured in quadruplicate using three lots of Coagpia AT Reagent on two CP3000
analyzers over four days, with one LoB test conducted per day. Results were
processed and analyzed following CLSI Guideline EP17-A2. The limit of blank was
determined to be 3%.
Limit of detection (LoD) was determined using five analyte-free samples and five
natural plasmas at concentrations near the lower limit of reportable range. These
samples were measured in quadruplicate using three lots of Coagpia AT Reagent on
two CP3000 analyzers over four days, with one run tested per day. Results were
processed and analyzed following CLSI Guideline EP17-A2. The limit of detection
was determined to be 5%.
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) of the Coagpia AT reagent was determined using five
citrated plasma samples with AT concentration at approximately 11%, 13%, 15%,
17% and 19%. These samples were tested with three lots of the Coagpia AT reagent
on the two CP3000 analyzers over four days, with one run tested per day. The pre-
defined total error goal was met for the LoQ study.
The results for LoB, LoD and LoQ are summarized below.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies at three clinical sites to compare the performance of the
Coagpia AT reagent on the CP3000 analyzer to the predicate device (HemosIL Liquid
Antithrombin on the Instrumentation Laboratories (IL) ACL TOP 700). Additional
plasma samples were obtained from three additional sites in order to achieve the
desired number of samples to span the clinical reportable range. A total of 482
samples were analyzed of which 116 were fresh and 366 were frozen samples. All
samples were collected in 3.2% sodium citrate anticoagulant and tested in singlet with
both methods (candidate and predicate). Patient sample demographics included 218
females, aged from neonate to 95 years old, and 186 males, aged from neonate to 83
years old. Of the 482 samples, 92 samples were pediatric samples.
Deming (orthogonal) regression and ordinary linear regression (OLR) were used to
determine Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r), slope and intercept along with their
95% CIs were provided. Bias was determined based on the Deming regression model.
The calculated bias along with its 95% CI were reported for the lower quartile, upper
quartile and medical decision points (MDP). All results were within the pre-defined
acceptance criteria.

b. Equivalence Studies
Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was conducted to demonstrate equivalence between fresh
and frozen citrated plasma samples. The study was conducted in one clinical site,
using one CP3000 analyzer, three reagent lots and one calibrator lot. Sixty fresh
samples covering the reportable range were measured on the CP3000 analyzer within
4 hours after blood collection. The frozen time points included 2 and 3 weeks of
storage with up to two freeze/thaw cycles at -20°C and 4 months of storage with up to
four freeze/thaw cycles at -80°C. Results were analyzed using Passing-Bablok
regression, Pearson correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman plots. The study results
demonstrated comparability between fresh and frozen samples and met the pre-
defined acceptance criteria for all applicatons.
Open tube vs. Closed tube sampling (CTS) mode
The purpose and scope of this study was to demonstrate the equivalence of the testing
results obtained from capped and uncapped blood collection tubes using CP3000 with
CTS mode. The assay was performed first on the capped tube then on the same tube,
uncapped. Sixty-four plasma samples covering the reportable range of the AT assay
on the CP3000 analyzer were used to conduct this study. Three CP3000 instruments
were used in this study. The results from the three CP3000 analyzers were compared.
The study results demonstrated comparability between the data sets.
Closed tube sampling (CTS) instrument vs. Non-CTS
The purpose and scope of this study was to demonstrate the equivalence of the test

results obtained using CP3000 instrument models CTS versus Non-CTS. One
hundred and twenty frozen plasma samples covering the reportable range of the AT
assay was used to conduct the study. Each sample was aliquoted into six sample cups.
The samples were measured in singlicate on CP3000 instruments (three CP3000 with
CTS and three CP3000 without CTS) over three days. The performance between the
two CP3000 analyzer models, CP3000 analyzer with the option of CTS capability and
CP3000 analyzer without CTS capability was determined to be equivalent.
