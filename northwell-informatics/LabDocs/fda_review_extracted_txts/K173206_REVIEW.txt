2. Indication(s) for use:
The SEKURE HbA1c assay is used to measure the percent concentration of hemoglobin
A1c (NGSP) or the HbA1c fraction mmol/mol (IFCC) in human venous whole blood and
hemolysate on the SK500 Clinical Chemistry System.
Measurement of hemoglobin A1c is used as an aid in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus,
as an aid in the identification of patients at risk for development of diabetes mellitus, and
for the monitoring of long-term blood glucose control in individuals with diabetes
mellitus.
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
• For prescription use only
• For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only
• This device has significant negative interference with fetal hemoglobin (HbF).
HbA1c results are invalid for patients with elevated amounts of HbF including
those with known Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin.
• The HbA1c assay should not be used to diagnose diabetes during pregnancy or
in the diagnosis of gestational diabetes. HbA1c reflects the average blood glucose
levels over the preceding 3 months (i.e., the average life span of a red blood cell)
and therefore may be falsely low during pregnancy or any other condition
associated with recent onset of hyperglycemia and/or decreased red blood cell
survival.
• Do not use for testing neonatal blood
• The HbA1c assay should not be used to diagnose or monitor diabetes in patients
with the following conditions:
- hemoglobinopathies, except as demonstrated to produce acceptable
performance (see PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS section of this
package insert)
- abnormal red blood cell turnover (e.g., anemias from hemolysis and iron
deficiency)
- malignancies, and severe chronic hepatic and renal disease
• In cases of rapidly evolving Type 1 diabetes, the increase of HbA1c values might
be delayed compared to the acute increase in glucose concentrations. In these
conditions, diabetes mellitus must be diagnosed based on plasma glucose
concentrations and/or the typical clinical symptoms.
• This test should not replace glucose testing for patients with Type 1 diabetes,
pediatric patients, or pregnant women.

--- Page 3 ---
• Glycated HbF is not detected by the assay as it does not contain the β-chain that
characterizes HbA1c. However, HbF is measured in the total Hb assay and as a
consequence, specimens containing elevated amounts of HbF may result in lower
than expected mmol/mol HbA1c values (IFCC) and %HbA1c values (NGSP).
• The HbA1c assay is susceptible to interference effects from conjugated bilirubin
at > 18 mg/dL (216 μmol/L) and unconjugated bilirubin at > 18 mg/dL (307.8
μmol/L).

L. Test Principle:
The SEKURE HbA1c assay consists of two separate concentration measurements obtained
during a single analysis: Total hemoglobin (THb) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). The
two concentrations are used to determine the percent HbA1c (NGSP units) or the
hemoglobin fraction in mmol/mol (IFCC units). The individual concentration values of
HbA1c and THb generated by the SEKURE HbA1c assay are used only for calculating the
percent HbA1c or HbA1c fraction, and must not be used individually for diagnostic
purposes.
The SEKURE HbA1c assay is calibrated using a multipoint calibration curve. The
calibration is performed using the Blank Solution, Calibrator 1 and Calibrator 2. The Blank
solution is used as a zero point calibrator, and contains peroxidase to eliminate noise
generated by the reagent. The Blank Solution, Calibrator 1 and Calibrator 2 are available
separately.
Pre-treatment: The anticoagulated whole blood sample is lysed using the HbA1c Pre-

treatment solution. The addition of the Pre-treatment solution to the whole blood sample
can occur automatically on board the SK500 or may be carried out manually before the
sample is placed on board. In the pre-treatment process, the erythrocytes are lysed and the
hemoglobin is transformed to methemoglobin by reaction with sodium nitrite.
Total Hemoglobin (THb): The hemoglobin is oxidized to stable methemoglobin azide by
the action of sodium nitrite and sodium azide and the concentration of the hemoglobin is
determined by bichromatic measurement at 505nm and 800nm.
Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c): The SEKURE HbA1c assay utilizes an enzymatic method
that specifically measures N-terminal fructosyl dipeptides of the β-chain of HbA1c. With
the addition of Reagent 1 to the sample, the glycosylated N- terminal dipeptide (fructosyl-
VH) of the β- chain of hemoglobin is released by the action of protease. Following addition
of Reagent 2 fructosyl peptideoxidase (FPOX) reacts with fructosyl-VH to produce
Hydrogen Peroxide (H O ). The Hydrogen Peroxide reacts with the coloring agent in the
2 2
presence of Peroxidase (POD) to develop color. The change in absorbance is measured to
calculate HbA1c concentration by bichromatic measurement at 660nm and 800nm.
Hemoglobin A1c Calculations: The final result may be expressed as either % HbA1c
(NGSP) or mmol/mol HbA1c (IFCC) and is automatically calculated by the system from
the HbA1c/THb ratio.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-Laboratory Precision (20-Day)
A 20-day precision study was conducted to evaluate the precision performance of the
SEKURE HbA1c assay based on guidance from the CLSI document EP05-A3,
Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods. The
within-lab study was conducted using 3 lots of SEKURE HbA1c reagent on 3 SK500
analyzers and 3 different lots of calibrators for both whole blood and hemolysate
applications. The whole blood assay was performed using BioRad Hemoglobin A1c
Controls (level 1 and 2 abbreviated below as QC1/QC2) and 4 levels of pooled
human K EDTA anticoagulated venous whole blood run in duplicate, twice a day for
2
twenty days. The hemolysate assay included Low and High Controls (abbreviated
below as QC1/QC2) as well as 4 levels of pooled human K EDTA anticoagulated
2
venous whole blood run in duplicate, twice a day for twenty days. Each lot of reagent
was run on each SK500 for a total of 9 analyzer/lot combinations.

high and low HbA1c K EDTA venous whole blood samples. Four replicates were
2
tested at each level. The mean observed %HbA1c value was determined for each
intermediate dilution and plotted versus the relative analyte concentration. The
following table summarizes the linear regression results obtained from one
representative lot generated using both NGSP (%HbA1c) and IFCC units (mmol/mol).
NGSP:
Slope Intercept R2 Concentration Range Tested
1.042 -0.325 0.9983 4.19 – 15.82 % HbA1c
IFCC:
Slope Intercept R2 Concentration Range Tested
1.041 -2.371 0.9976 22.17 – 149.23 mmol/mol HbA1c
The linearity study supports the claimed measuring range of 4.0 to 14.0 %HbA1c
(NGSP) or 20.02 to 129.34 mmol/mol HbA1c (IFCC).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The SEKURE HbA1c assay is traceable to the International Federation of Clinical
Chemistry (IFCC) reference calibrators. The SEKURE HbA1c assay is NGSP
certified. The NGSP certification expires in one year. See NGSP website for current
certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) units of mmol/mol are
calculated using the Master Equation NGSP (%) = 0.09148 x IFCC (mmol/mol) +
2.152. HbA1c results are provided to the customers using two different units: NGSP
equivalent units (%) and IFCC equivalent units (mmol/mol).
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined using CLSI
Guidance EP17-A2, Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory
Measurement Procedures. Testing was performed using 5 blank samples for LoB and
5 low concentration samples for LoD. The samples were analyzed in quadruplicate
using 2 lots of SEKURE HbA1c reagent on 2 SK500 analyzers. The detection limits
are summarized in the tables below:
Limit %HbA1c µmol/L A1c µmol/L tHb
Limit of Blank (LoB) 3.27 0.66 0.2
Limit of Detection (LoD) 3.32 0.75 0.5

e. Analytical specificity:
i.) An interference study was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2, Interference
Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline – Second Edition to assess
endogenous substances that could interfere with the SEKURE HbA1c assay. All
interferents were tested at % HbA1c concentrations of ~ 6.5 and 8.0% in replicates
of ten. Potential interferents were added individually to aliquots of a K EDTA
2
venous whole blood specimen pool. A control portion of the same matrix was
prepared and adjusted for volume with the same solvent used to prepare the
interferent stock solution. Significant interference was defined by the sponsor as
>5% deviation from the control (aliquot with no interfering substance). Results
demonstrated that no significant interference was observed with the following
substances up to the listed concentrations:

Edition using K EDTA venous whole blood samples known to contain common
2
hemoglobin variants (HbA2, HbS, HbC, HbE, HbD, and HbF). The variant samples
were obtained from several suppliers including NGSP, commercial vendors, and
hospital sites. The %HbA1c concentration was measured using the SEKURE HbA1c
assay on an SK500 analyzer and compared to results obtained with an FDA cleared
and NGSP certified method that has been demonstrated to be free from interference
by the respective hemoglobin variants (Architect c8000 for samples containing
HbA2, HbC, HbD, and HbS, Trinity Premier Hb9210 for samples containing HbE
and Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer HLC-723 G8 for samples
containing HbF). The numbers and concentrations of hemoglobin variants tested and
the range of % HbA1c concentrations in which they were tested are shown below.

iv. Hemoglobin Derivatives
A hemoglobin derivative study was performed using potential interferents tested at %
HbA1c concentrations of ~ 6.5 and 8.0% in replicates of ten. Potential interferents
were added individually to aliquots of a whole blood specimen pool. A control
portion of the same matrix was prepared and adjusted for volume with the same
solvent used to prepare the interferent stock solution. Significant interference was
defined by the sponsor as >5% deviation from the control (aliquot with no interfering
substance). Specificity was assessed by comparing test samples containing the
potential interferents listed below to reference samples. Results demonstrated that no
significant interference was observed with the following substances up to the listed
concentrations:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP09-A3,
Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples;
Approved Guideline – Third Edition. One hundred and thirty (130) human whole
blood and hemolysate samples in K EDTA with values spanning the assay range of
2
4.3 to 13.8% HbA1c were tested. Each sample was analyzed internally in replicates of
two, using two lots each of SEKURE HbA1c reagent on two SK500 analyzers over 5
operating days. The candidate device results were compared to those obtained from
testing at a secondary NGSP reference laboratory on the Tosoh G8 HPLC method.
The method comparison was performed using both the hemolysate and whole blood
application. The distribution of samples spanning the measuring interval for both whole
blood and hemolysate methods are as follows:

SEKURE HbA1c reagents on two SK500 analyzers. Matched venous blood
specimens were collected from 41 different donors in the control tube type (K
2
EDTA) and in sodium fluoride/K EDTA and K EDTA tube types. Each sample was
2 3
tested in 2 replicates using two lots of HbA1c reagents. The sample range tested was
5.03-13.69 % HbA1c.
Passing Bablok regression analysis data for one representative lot is provided below.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
HbA1c values above 6.5 %HbA1c (48 mmol/mol) meet the criteria for diagnosis of
diabetes mellitus. 4 Patients with HbA1c values in the range of 5.7 - 6.4 %HbA1c (39 -
47 mmol/mol) are at an increased risk for diabetes (pre-diabetes). 4 HbA1c levels below
5.7 % HbA1c (39 mmol/mol) are considered normal. 4
