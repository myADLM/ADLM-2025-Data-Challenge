When an adequate volume of test specimen is dispensed into the sample well of the cassette,
the test specimen migrates across the test strip. If the concentration of hHb in the specimen is
at or above 50 ng/mL, the T-line visibly appears as a burgundy line. The intensity of the T-
line may vary according to the concentration of the hHb in the sample. If the concentration of
hHb in the sample is below 50 ng/mL, a T-line does not visibly appear. The C-line is coated
with goat anti-mouse IgG antibody, which binds to the conjugated monoclonal antibody
regardless of whether hHb is present in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
All manufacturer’s predetermined performance acceptance criteria were met.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability was evaluated in a study by two trained laboratory professionals using
three Instant-view-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test kit lots.
Hemoglobin free fecal samples were collected and spiked with human whole blood
with known hemoglobin concentrations to achieve the following six fecal hemoglobin
concentrations: 0 ng/mL, 25 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 55 ng/mL, 60 ng/mL, and 500 ng/mL.
Fifty replicates were performed for each concentration level. The results of the
repeatability study are described in the table 1 below.

Reproducibility was conducted across three POC sites using three device lots (same
three lots at all sites), and three untrained users (one at each site) over five days. Hb-
free fecal samples were collected and spiked with human whole blood with known
hemoglobin concentrations to achieve the following six fecal hemoglobin
concentrations: 0 ng/mL, 25 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 55 ng/mL, 60 ng/mL, and 500 ng/mL.
Fourteen replicates were performed for each sample and concentration level. In
addition, Insure FIT FOBT Negative and Positive Controls (K101831) were tested
daily to ensure the validity of the candidate test results. The results of the
reproducibility study are described in the tables below.

prozone effects was evaluated using three test kit lots and two trained laboratory
personnel. Hb-free stool specimens spiked with human blood of known hemoglobin
concentrations so as to obtain fecal test samples with the following Hb
concentrations: 1,000 ng/ml (1 ug/ml), 2,000 ng/ml (2 ug/ml), 3,000 ng/ml (3 ug/ml),
4,000 ng/ml (4 ug/ml), 5,000ng/mL (5 ug/ml), 50,000 ng/mL (50 ug/ml), and 500,000
ng/mL (500 ug/ml). Twenty aliquots of each sample concentration were mixed with
extraction buffer in the specimen collection tubes and tested in a randomized order.
It was determined that the Instant-view-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test
is not susceptible to prozone/hook effect up to a hemoglobin concentration of 500,000
ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Internal Control
Procedural controls are included in the test device. A burgundy line in the control
region (C-line) is the internal procedural control and confirms sufficient specimen
volume and correct procedural technique.
External Controls
It is recommended that positive and negative controls be performed to verify proper
test performance. External controls are not provided with the test kit.
Stability Studies
Insure FIT FOBT Controls (K101831) were tested daily as part of each stability study
to validate expected performance of the test kit.
1. Test Kit Stability (Accelerated)
An accelerated stability study was performed by two trained laboratory personnel
with three test kit lots, two test kits per lot. Hb-free stool specimens were spiked
with human blood (of known hemoglobin concentration) to obtain fecal samples
containing six different hemoglobin concentrations: 0 ng/mL, 25 ng/mL, 50
ng/mL, 60 ng/mL, 72 ng/mL, and 500 ng/mL. Each test kit lot was stored at the
following temperatures: 20°C (68°F), 23°C (73.4°F), 35°C (95°F), and 60°C
(140°F). In this study, it was found that the Instant-view-plus Immunochemical
Fecal Occult Blood Test kit is stable for 24 months when stored at the following
temperatures, 8–23°C (46.4–73.4°F).
2. Test Kit Stability (Real-Time)
A real-time stability study was performed by two trained laboratory personnel
with three test kit lots. Hb-free stool specimens were spiked with human blood (of
known hemoglobin level) to obtain fecal test samples with the following Hb
concentrations: 0 ng/mL, 25 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 60 ng/mL, 72 ng/mL, and 500
7

--- Page 8 ---
ng/mL. Each test kit lot was stored at room temperature 20–23°C (68–73.4°F) for
up to 26 months. The results of the study determined that the Instant-view-plus
Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test kit is stable for 24 months at room
temperature.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Insure FIT FOBT Controls (K101831) were tested tested daily in each study to
validate the expected performance of the Instant-view-plus Immunochemical Fecal
Occult Blood Test kit.
Specificity to human hemoglobin variant
The ability of Instant-view-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test to detect
human hemoglobin variants was determined by testing stool samples spiked with
hemoglobin-A (HbA), hemoglobin-S (HbS) and hemoglobin-C (HbC) at seven
different concentrations of each variant. HbA-, HbS-, and HbC-spiked samples were
tested at 0 ng/mL, 40 ng/mL, 48 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 60 ng/mL, 72 ng/mL, and 500
ng/mL. For each hemoglobin variant, three aliquots of each of the seven
concentrations were mixed with detection buffer in Instant-view-plus
Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test collection bottles. Samples were tested in a
randomized order. The presence of HbA, HbS, and HbC were detected at
concentrations ≥ 48 ng/mL.
Cross-Reactivity
Cross-reactivity of the Instant-view-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test
with animal hemoglobin was evaluated by testing Hb-free stool specimens spiked
with known concentrations of human Hb to obtain fecal samples with seven different
Hb concentrations: 0 ng/mL, 40 ng/mL, 48 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 60 ng/mL, 72 ng/mL,
and 500 ng/mL. Five replicates of each concentration were then spiked with
hemoglobin from different animals to include bovine (2000 μg/mL), chicken (500
μg/mL), fish (100 μg/mL), horse (500 μg/mL), goat (500 μg/mL), rabbit (500 μg/mL),
pig (500 μg/mL), and sheep (100 μg/mL). All samples were tested in a randomized
order. Instant-view-plus™ Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test did not show
significant cross-reactivity with any of the animal hemoglobins at the concentration
tested.
Interfering Substances
Susceptibility of Instant-view-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test to
interference from peroxidase-rich fruits and vegetables was evaluated. In this study,
extracts from vegetables and fruitswere evaluated by testing five replicates of Hb-free
stool specimens spiked with known concentrations s of human Hb solution to obtain
fecal samples with seven different Hb concentrations: 0 ng/mL, 40 ng/mL, 48 ng/mL,
8

--- Page 9 ---
50 ng/mL, 60 ng/mL, 72 ng/mL, and 500 ng/mL. The five replicates were then spiked
with extracts from the following vegetables: broccoli, cantaloupe, cauliflower,
horseradish, parsnip, red radish, and turnip. All samples were mixed with detection
buffer in Instant-view-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test sample
collection bottles and tested in a randomized order. There was no significant
interference from the vegetable extracts tested at each Hb concentration.
Interfering Supplements
Susceptibility of Instant-view-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test to
interference from iron and sodium L-ascorbate was evaluated by testing Hb-free stool
specimen spiked with known concentrations of human Hb solution to obtain fecal
samples with seven different Hb concentrations: 0 ng/mL, 40 ng/mL, 48 ng/mL, 50
ng/mL, 60 ng/mL, 72 ng/mL, and 500 ng/mL. Three aliquot samples for each Hb
concentration, were spiked with iron (0.5% (w/v)) or sodium L-ascorbate (0.5%
(w/v)). All samples were mixed with detection buffer in Instant-view-plus
Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test sample collection bottles and tested in a
randomized order. Instant-view-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test did
not show significant interference from iron (0.5% (w/v)) or sodium L-ascorbate
(0.5% (w/v)).
Interference from Toilet Water
Susceptibility of Instant-view-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test to
interference from toilet water was evaluated by testing 40 replicates of Hb-free stool
specimen spiked with known concentrations of human Hb solution to obtain fecal
samples with seven different fecal Hb concentrations: 0 ng/mL, 40 ng/mL, 48 ng/mL,
50 ng/mL, 60 ng/mL, 72 ng/mL, and 500 ng/mL. Twenty replicates of each spiked
sample were collected both without contact with toilet water and after being
submerged in toilet water. All samples were mixed with detection buffer in Instant-
view-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test sample collection bottles and
tested in a randomized order. Instant-view-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood
Test did not show significant interference from samples collected in toilet water.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off value for the Instant-view-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood
(FOB) Test was verified against the predicate cutoff. Fecal test samples were
prepared by spiking stool samples with human blood of known hemoglobin
concentration, to obtain the following fecal hemoglobin concentrations: 0 ng/mL, 25
ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 48 ng/mL, 60 ng/mL, 72 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL. Twenty aliquots
of each of the seven concentrations of spiked stool test samples were tested in
randomized order. Testing was performed side-by-side with the predicate by
comparing the test results of the device with that of the predicate. The cut-off was
verified to 50 ng/mL (hemoglobin in fecal sample mixed with detection buffer).

(FOB) Test with the predicate test, Instant-View Fecal Occult Blood Rapid Test, was
conducted by testing 299 patient samples. The method comparison study was
performed at three POC sites with two untrained users at each site. The Insure FIT
FOBT Controls (K101831) were run prior to testing study samples. Statistical
analysis of site-wise test results as well as combined results showed that Instant-view-
plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Test results have acceptable overall
percent agreement as well as positive percent agreement and negative percent
agreement with the Instant-View Fecal Occult Blood Rapid Test.

In addition, a consumer study with over-the-counter untrained users was performed
by testing the Instant-view-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Test in
parallel to the predicate test, the INSTANT-VIEW Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Self-
Test. In this study, Hb-free stool specimens were spiked with hemoglobin to obtain
fecal samples with the following hemoglobin concentrations: 0 ng/mL, 25 ng/mL, 50
ng/mL, 60 ng/mL, and 500 ng/mL. The results of this study are shown in the table
below.

1. Specimen Collection Verification:
The purpose of this study was to verify that the applicator device for the Instant-
view-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test kit, consistently delivers the
specified amount of stool required for optimal test performance. The study was
conducted by five untrained users who each tested five positive and five negative
clinical samples. The amount of stool specimen collected using the applicator

device, did not show a significant difference between users. The average weight
of the stool specimens collected by the users was 0.94 mg. Results found that by
following the instructions for use in the labeling, an accurate amount of sample
can be obtained.
2. Sample Volume Study:
The sample test volume compatible with accurate and consistent performance of
the Instant-view-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test was demonstrated
in a study that evaluated three device lots tested with both a negative sample (25
ng/ml) and a positive sample (60 ng/ml) . One to five drops of each sample were
tested for each device lot.. In order for the sample volume to be considered
adequate for test performance, the control (C) line had to appear in less than 20
seconds and the test (T) line had to appear within one min for positive samples
(and be absent for negative samples). The sample volume study demonstrated that
for Instant-view-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test device, one drop
of sample consistently produced correct results within the specified timeframe.
