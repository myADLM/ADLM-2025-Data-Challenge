I. Device Description:
The CAMPYLOBACTER QUIK CHEK test uses antibodies to Campylobacter specific
antigen in human fecal samples. The device contains a reaction window with two vertical
lines of immobilized antibodies. The test line (“T”) contains antibodies against
Campylobacter specific antigen. The control line (“C”) contains anti-IgG antibodies. The
Conjugate consists of antibodies to a Campylobacter-specific antigen coupled to horseradish
peroxidase. The “T” reaction is examined visually for the appearance of a vertical blue line
on the “T” side of the Reaction Window. A blue line indicates a positive test. A positive “C”
reaction, indicated by a vertical blue line on the “C” side of the reaction window,
monitors/confirms that the sample and reagents were added correctly, the reagents were
active at the time of performing the assay, and that the sample migrated properly through the
membrane device. A positive “C” reaction also confirms the reactivity of the other reagents
associated with the assay.

from each laboratory were submitted to TECHLAB Inc. and compared. The results
were consistent among all three locations with100% reproducibility for all test panels.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The effect of specimen storage on antigen stability was evaluated for both fresh
samples and samples in transport media. For the analysis, a total of 20 fecal
specimens were tested with the CAMPYLOBACTER QUIK CHEK test. The fecal
specimens consisted 10 C. jejuni low positive fecal samples (1-2 times C95 for whole
organisms), 5 C. jejuni moderate positive fecal samples (2-3 times C95 for whole
organism), and 5 C. jejuni high positive fecal samples (4-5 times C95 for whole
organism). Both fresh samples and samples stored in Cary Blair and C&S transport
media were tested.
For fresh samples, samples were stored between 2°C and 8°C and tested at 24 hour
intervals for 120 hours. At the same time positive and negative controls were tested.
The following transport media were used for the study: Thermo Scientific Protocol
Cary Blair media and Meridian Bioscience Inc., Para-Pak C&S. As recommended in
the package insert, Cary Blair and C&S samples were stored between 20°C and 30°C.
Samples stored in transport media were tested at 24 hour intervals for 120 hours.
Positive samples remained positive throughout the study. Storage in transport media
did not affect the stability of the samples. Based on these results, the recommended
storage time for fresh samples is up to 120 hours between 2°C and 8°C, Cary Blair
transport media is up to 96 hours between 20°C and 30°C and C&S transport media is
up to 120 hours between 20°C-30°C based on the data and the package insert
recommendation.
Freeze/Thaw:
Freeze/Thaw stability for raw specimens was demonstrated for six freeze/thaw cycle
over a nine day period. A panel consisting of 20 masked raw stool samples were
prepared and tested in duplicates; three true negative, two high negative (1-2 times
belowC5 (whole organisms)), five low positives (1-2 times C95 (whole organisms)),
six moderate positives (2-3 times C95 (whole organisms)) and four high positives (4-
5 x LoD (whole organisms)) were tested in raw stool. Based on the data submitted,
none of the speciemns converted from positive-to-negative or negative-to-positive
after any of the freeze/thaw cycles. After six cycles freeze/thawing neither enhances
nor impairs the performance of the CAMPYLOBACTER QUIK CHEK test.

d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) for the CAMPYLOBACTER QUIK CHEK test was
determined visually using whole organisms of both C. jejuni and C. coli spiked into
unpreserved (raw stool) and preserved (Cary Blair and C&S media). The
concentrations were calculated in colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) and
their equivalent in CFU/test by factoring in the dilutions and the final volume used in
the assay. The LoD is the concentrations of organisms that yields a positive result
95% of the time and a negative result 5% of the time. See the LoDs in Table 2 listed
by organisms and by stool (unpreserved and preserved).

e. Analytical specificity:
The CAMPYLOBACTER QUIK CHEK test was evaluated for cross-reactivity with the
bacteria and viruses listed below. C. helveticus (strain 54661) was found to be
positive at 3.08 x 106 CFU/mL (4 x LoD of C. coli). C. lari (strain 23947) was found
to be positive at 3.08 x 106 CFU/mL (4 x LoD of C. coli). C. upsaliensis (strain
14913) was found to be positive at 1.54 x 106 CFU/mL (2 x LoD of C. coli). All other
strains were shown to not interfere with the performance of the CAMPYLOBACTER
QUIK CHEK test. Bacteria was spiked at concentration of >108 CFU/mL and viruses
at a range from 103.3 to 108.75 TCID units per 0.2 mL.

g. Prozone:
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that a high concentration of
Camplobacter (antigen) does not interfere with a positive reaction in the
CAMPYLOBACTER QUIK CHEK test. High samples were prepared by spiking a
negative fecal pool with 5 X 107 whole organisms of C. jejuni and 2.4 X 108 whole
organisms of C. coli. A total of 5 different dilutions of C. jejuni and C. coli whole
organisms, were prepared and tested. Testing was performed in triplicate according to
the Package Insert instructions. The results demonstrated that there was no overall
hook affect, and that elevated levels of whole organism did not affect the detection or
Campylobacter.

Prospective Study
The performance of the CAMPYLOBACTER QUIK CHEK test was evaluated at four
independent sites. The sensitivity and specificity for the CAMPYLOBACTER QUIK
CHEK device was compared directly to culture results at all three sites. Prospective
testing consisted of 1552 stool specimens tested in clinical microbiology laboratories
at the Medical College of Wisconsin, Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center,
TriCore Reference Laboratories and Techlab, Inc.
The ages of patients ranged from less than 1 year to 100 Years with, 15.7% of the
specimens coming from patients that were ≤ 18 years. Of the 1552 patients tested
38.7% were female and 61.3% were male. No difference in test performance was
observed based on patient age or gender.
