3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
· For prescription use only.
· Optimal results with the CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test are obtained with specimens
that are less than 96 hours old. If specimens are not assayed within this time period,
they may be frozen.
· The CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test was evaluated using only fresh fecal samples
and fecal samples stored in Cary Blair media or C&S media. The performance of
fecal samples stored in other transport media (e.g, formalin, polyvinyl alcohol) has
not been evaluated and therefore, should not be used.
· The CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test is qualitative. The intensity of the color should
not be interpreted quantitatively.
· No data exists on the effects of colonic washes, barium enemas, laxatives, or bowel
preparations on the performance of the CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test. All of these
procedures can result in extensive dilution or the presence of additives that may affect
test performance.

I. Device Description:
The CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK™ test is an enzyme immunoassay for the qualitative
detection of Campylobacter spp. in human fecal specimens. The CAMPYLOBACTER
CHEK test uses antibodies that recognize a Campylobacter-specific antigen. The
Microassay Plate in the kit contains immobilized capture monoclonal antibodies against a
Campylobacter-specific antigen. The Conjugate consists of polyclonal antibodies to a
Campylobacter-specific antigen conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. In the assay, an
aliquot of a diluted fecal specimen is transferred to a microassay well containing the
Conjugate. If the antigen is present in the specimen, it will bind to the Conjugate and to
the immobilized capture antibody during the incubation phase. Any unbound material is
removed during the washing steps. Following the addition of the Substrate, a color is
detected due to the enzyme-antibody-antigen complexes that formed in the presence of
antigen.
The assay kit contains the following:
1. Microassay Plate – 12 strips, each consisting of 8 wells coated with monoclonal
antibodies to a Campylobacter-specific antigen (stored with dessicant)
2. Conjugate (7 mL) – Antibodies to a Campylobacter-specific antigen coupled to
horseradish peroxidase in a buffered protein solution containing 0.05% ProClin® 300
3. Diluent (40 mL) – Buffered protein solution containing 0.05% ProClin® 300. The
Diluent is also to be used as the negative control solution
4. Positive Control (3.5 mL) – Recombinant Campylobacter-specific antigen in a
buffered protein solution containing 0.05% ProClin® 300
5. Stop Solution (7 mL) – 0.6 N sulfuric acid
6. Substrate (14 mL) – solution containing tetramethylbenzidine and peroxide
7. Wash Buffer Concentrate (50 mL) – 20X concentrate containing phosphate buffered
saline, detergent, and 0.2% thimerosal
8. Accessories: 100 Disposable plastic transfer pipettes
2 Plastic adhesive sheets
1 Wash Solution Label
50 Wooden Applicator sticks

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test was determined using an
eight member masked fecal specimen panel. The panel consisted of two negative, two
high negative (just below C5), two low positive (1-2x higher than C95), and two
moderate positive (2-3x higher than C95) specimens. Each fecal specimen was spiked
using known concentration of C. jejuni whole organism to achieve the desired level.
Testing was performed at two independent laboratories and on-site at TECHLAB,
Inc. The Specimens were tested twice a day in triplicate over a five day period by
multiple technicians at each site using two different kit lots. Positive and negative
controls were run with each sample panel of masked specimens. The result from each
laboratory were submitted to TECHLAB Inc. and compared. The results were
consistent among all three locations with 100% reproducibility for all test panels.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The effect of specimen storage on antigen stability was evaluated for both fresh
samples and samples in transport media. For the analysis, a total of 20 fecal
specimens were tested with the CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test. The fecal specimens
consisted of 10 C. jejuni low positive fecal samples (1-2x higher than C95), 5 C.
jejuni moderate positive fecal samples (2-3x higher than C95), and 5 C. jejuni high
positive fecal samples (4-5x higher than C95). Both fresh samples and samples stored
in Cary Blair and C&S transport media were tested.
For fresh samples, samples were stored between 2°C and 8°C and tested at 24 hour
intervals up to 168 hours. At the same time positive and negative controls were tested.
The following transport media were used for the study: Thermo Scientific Protocol
Cary Blair media and Meridian Bioscience Inc., Para-Pak C&S. As recommended in
the package insert, Cary Blair and C&S samples were stored between 20°C and 30°C.
Samples stored in transport media were tested at 24 hour intervals up to 168 hours.
Positive samples remained positive throughout the study. Storage in transport media
did not affect the stability of the samples. Based on these results, the recommended
storage time for fresh samples is up to 96 hours between 2°C and 8°C, Cary Blair
transport media is up to 96 hours between 20°C and 30°C and C&S transport media is
up to 96 hours between 20°C-30°C based on the data and the package insert
recommendation.
Freeze/Thaw:
Freeze/Thaw stability for raw specimens was demonstrated for six freeze/thaw cycles
over a 9 day period. A panel consisting of 20 masked raw stool samples were
prepared and tested in duplicate; three true negative, two high negative (1-2x below
C5), five low positives (1-2x higher than C95), six moderate positives (2-3x higher
than C95), and four high positives (4-5x higher than C95). All spiked samples yielded
positive results after the freeze/thaw cycles. Based on the data submitted, the freeze-
thaw cycle neither enhances nor impairs the performance of the CAMPYLOBACTER
CHEK test.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) for the CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test was determined
by spectrophotometry at both single (450 nm) and dual wavelength (450/620 nm)
using whole organisms of both C. jejuni and C. coli spiked into unpreserved (raw
stool) and preserved (Cary Blair and C&S media). The concentrations were calculated
in colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) and their equivalent in CFU/test by
factoring in the dilutions and the final volume used in the assay. The LoD is the
concentrations of organisms that yields a positive result 95% of the time and a
negative result 5% of the time. The LoDs that were determined using single
wavelength readings for both species were equivalent to those obtained using dual
wavelength readings. See Table 2 for LoDs determined at dual wavelength.

Cross-reactivity Study
The CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test was evaluated for cross-reactivity with the
bacteria and viruses listed below. C. helveticus and C. upsaliensis were found to be
cross-reactive at 2 times the LoD of C. coli (3.14 x 106 CFU/mL). In addition, C. lari
was found to be cross-reactive at 8 times the LoD of C. coli (1.26 x 107 CFU/mL). All
other strains were shown to not interfere with the performance of the
CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test. Bacteria was spiked at concentration of >108
CFU/mL and viruses at a range from 101.75 to 108.25 TCID units per 0.2 mL.

A positive result indicates that Campylobacter antigens were detected. A negative
result indicates that no Campylobacter antigens were detected, or that the antigen
levels are below what can be detected by the assay.
g. Prozone:
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that a high concentration of
Camplobacter (antigen) does not interfere with a positive reaction in the
CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test. High samples were prepared by spiking a negative
fecal pool with 5 X 107 whole organisms of C. jejuni and 2.4 X 108 whole organisms
of C. coli. A total of 5 different dilutions of C. jejuni and C. coli whole organisms,
were prepared and tested. Testing was performed in triplicate according to the
Package Insert instructions. The results demonstrated that there was no overall hook
affect, and that elevated levels of whole organism did not affect the detection of
Campylobacter.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Prospective Study
The performance of the CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test was evaluated at four
independent sites. The sensitivity and specificity for the CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK
device was compared directly to culture results that were obtained from three of the
sites. Prospective testing consisted of 1552 stool specimens tested in clinical
microbiology laboratories at the Medical College of Wisconsin, Penn State Milton S.
Hershey Medical Center, TriCore Reference Laboratories, and at TechLab, Inc. The
ages of patients ranged from less than 1 year to 100 Years with, 15.7% of the
specimens coming from patients that were ≤ 18 years. Of the 1552 patients tested
38.7% were female and 61.3% were male. No difference in test performance was
observed based on patient age or gender. The results of the study show that the
CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test exhibited a sensitivity of 91.4%, and a specificity of
99.1% with culture. The results are shown in Table 4.
All samples with discrepant results were tested using an FDA cleared EIA assay, an
FDA cleared molecular assay, in-house PCR testing (16s rRNA), and bidirectional
sequencing. Of the three false negative results, one sample was confirmed to be
negative using these additional tests.

positive with all follow-up testing, 2 were confirmed to be positive with commercial EIA, in-house
PCR, and bidirectional sequencing, and 4 were confirmed to be positive for C. upsaliensis by species
specific PCR and sequencing. Earlier analytical studies have shown that C. upsaliensis yields cross-
reactive results with the CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK.
**One of the three specimens that were culture positive and CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test
negative was confirmed to be negative with all tests.
Retrospective Study
Additional testing was performed on 30 retrospective positive specimens. The patient
ages ranged from less than 11 months to 74 years. All retrospective specimens were
