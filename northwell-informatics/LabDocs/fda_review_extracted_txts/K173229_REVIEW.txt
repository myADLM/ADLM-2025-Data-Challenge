The Preview Digital Pregnancy Test is a qualitative lateral-flow immunochromatographic
assay that consists of a single test strip encased in a plastic device housing, with an
absorbent tip. The device incorporates a digital readout of the test result which is displayed
on an LCD screen. The device is distributed in one pouch with a desiccant and the
instructions for use leaflet. The device can be used in both dip and midstream modes. The
device contains mouse monoclonal anti β-hCG antibody colloidal gold conjugate pre-dried
on a pad. Mouse monoclonal anti-α-hCG antibody (on the Test Line) and goat anti-mouse
IgG polyclonal antibody (on the Control Line) are coated and immobilized on the
nitrocellulose membrane.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Not applicable.
L. Test Principle:
The Preview Digital Pregnancy Test is lateral flow sandwich immunochromatographic assay.
During the test procedures, hCG in the urine specimen reacts with the mouse antiβ-hCG antibody-
colloidal gold conjugate to form a complex. By capillary action, the complex migrates along the
membrane to the α-hCG antibody line (T), and remains captured in the T line. As a result a
colored band develops in the T line, indicating a positive result. If there is no hCG in the urine, no
colored band develops in the test zone, indicating a negative result. A colored line will develop in
the control zone if sufficient sample volume has been applied to the test strip.
The Preview Digital Pregnancy Test device utilizes LED as a light source and light reflection
to determine the presence or absence of the colored test and control lines. The intended user
dips the absorbent tip into the urine for 10 seconds and the final reading is observed between
3 and 5 minutes by digital display of the results (“Yes+”, “No-” or “Invalid”) on the display
screen.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed using negative human urine samples spiked with
hCG (commercially available and traceable to the 4th WHO international standard) to
create samples with hCG concentrations of 0 mIU/mL, 5 mIU/mL, 12.5 mIU/mL, 15
mIU/mL, 18.75 mIU/mL, 25 mIU/mL, 50 mIU/mL, 100 mIU/mL and 1000 mIU/mL.
These samples were tested in replicates of 10, by three laboratory technicians, using
three lots of Preview Digital Pregnancy Test for five consecutive days. Testing was

A second precision study was conducted using hCG spiked urine samples containing
hCG at concentrations of 0 mIU/mL, 5 mIU/mL, 12.5 mIU/mL, 15 mIU/mL, 18.75
mIU/mL, 25 mIU/mL, 50 mIU/mL, and 100 mIU/mL. These samples were tested by
nine operators with three lots of Preview Digital Pregnancy Test. The results obtained
were similar to those in the first precision study conducted (shown above).

Standard 4th edition for hCG.
The stability testing protocol and acceptance criteria used to support the shelf life
were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims a 30 months shelf-life
when stored at 4-30℃ in the sealed foil pouch. Real time stability studies are on-
going.

package insert instructions in triplicates using 3 reagent lots and three operators. No
hCG hook effect was observed at hCG levels up to 500,000 mIU/mL.
Cross-Reactivity:
To evaluate cross-reactivity, negative and positive urine samples (0 mIU/mL,
5 mIU/mL and 25 mIU/mL) were spiked with various concentrations of glycoprotein
hormones LH, FSH, TSH and hCG β-core fragment. The results support that there
is no interference due to 500 mIU/mL LH, 1000 mIU/mL FSH, 1000 mIU/mL TSH
or 250,000 pmol/L hCG β-core fragment in either negative or positive urine samples.
pH interference study:
To evaluate potential interference from changes in urine pH, urine samples containing
0 mIU/mL, 5 mIU/mL, 25 mIU/mL and 100 mIU/mL hCG were tested at pH values
of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. The results indicated that changes in pH range of 4~9 do not
interfere with either positive or negative results from the device.
Specific Gravity interference study:
To evaluate potential interference from changes in specific gravity, urine samples
containing 0 mIU/mL, 5 mIU/mL, 25 mIU/mL and 100 mIU/mL hCG were tested
at specific gravity values ranging from 1.000, 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025, 1.030
and 1.035. The results indicated that changes in specific gravity do not interfere with
either positive or negative results from the device.

Lay user study
A lay user study was performed with 200 female subjects recruited from three study
sites, each with varying educational and occupational backgrounds. Each subject
tested her own urine sample using either mid-stream (100) or dip testing (100
samples) methods on the candidate device according to the package insert, and
provided a sample for professional testing using the subject device.
Summary of results is presented in the table below:

A second lay user study was performed by the same 200 female subjects, using
negative urine samples spiked with hCG near the device cutoff. The results from this
study were found to be acceptable.
Each lay person was given a questionnaire to assess the readability of the labeling.
The results of the questionnaire were found to be acceptable.

Kincaid analysis.
Pre-, Peri- and Post-Menopausal study
To evaluate the false positive rate of the Preview Digital Pregnancy Test in non-
pregnant females, 100 urine samples were collected from normal, non-pregnant
females in each of the following age ranges: 18-40 years of age (pre-menopausal), 41-
55 years of age (peri-menopausal), and >55 years of age (post-menopausal). All
samples were tested with three lots of Preview Digital Pregnancy Test. Half of the
samples from each group were tested by dip method, and half by mid-stream method.
No positive results were obtained from any of the samples tested, in either of the test
modes.
