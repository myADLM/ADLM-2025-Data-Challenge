K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle:
The Solana GBS Assay uses Helicase-Dependent Amplification with fluorescently-labeled
probes to detect a conserved region of the S. agalactiae thiolase atoB gene in culture medium
from vaginal/rectal swabs that are obtained from pregnant women.
Vaginal/rectal swab specimens are cultured for 18-24 hours in either Lim or Carrot broth,
after which a sample of the culture medium is transferred to a tube containing Process Buffer.
The tube is heated at 95°C for 5 minutes to lyse the target organisms, and an aliquot of the
lysate is used to rehydrate Reaction Tubes that contain reagents for the amplification and
detection of S. agalactiae target DNA and an internal Process Control. After rehydration, the
test operator loads the Reaction Tubes into the Solana instrument for automated incubation,
fluorescence detection and result interpretation. Results are reported on the instrument screen
as “GBS Positive,” “GBS Negative” or “Invalid” (due to Process Control failure) and may be
printed.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Analytical studies to characterize the performance of the Solana GBS Assay were
conducted using Lim or Carrot broth that was inoculated with clinical vaginal/rectal swab
matrix, incubated for 18-24 hours at 37°C, screened as GBS-negative using the Solana
GBS Assay, pooled and stored frozen at ≤-20°C. Samples for testing were prepared by
mixing an aliquot of the vaginal/rectal swab culture medium with enumerated stock
suspensions of S. agalactiae, Solana GBS Assay Process Buffer and other components
appropriate to the conditions under investigation.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility
The reproducibility of the Solana GBS Assay between laboratories was evaluated in a
study performed by two operators at each of three sites over a period of five non-
consecutive days. The Solana GBS Assay exhibited similar analytical sensitivity with
Lim and Carrot broth samples and therefore the Reproducibility Study was performed
with a panel of contrived positive and negative Lim broth samples as the
representative sample type (refer to Sections M(1)(d) and M(2)(b)). The positive
samples were prepared using two strains of GBS at three different target levels based
on the limit of detection of the assay. On each day, each operator tested three negative
samples and one or two replicates of each S. agalactiae positive panel member (3
sites x 2 operators x 5 days x 2-4 samples per target level per day = 90 replicates per
target level). The results of the study are summarized in Table 1.

In addition to testing the reproducibility panel members, on each day of the study, the
operators each tested three Positive and three Negative External Controls (3 sites x 2
operators x 3 replicates x 5 days = 90 replicates per control). The controls were
prepared using the Quidel Molecular GBS Control Set. In all cases the Positive and
Negative External Controls produced the expected results (90/90 = 100%).
The results of this study demonstrated acceptable reproducibility from site-to-site at
target levels close to the limit of detection (LoD) of the Solana GBS assay.
Repeatability
The within-laboratory repeatability of the Solana GBS Assay was evaluated by
testing a panel of contrived positive and negative Lim broth samples over a period of
15 non-consecutive days. The positive samples were prepared using two strains of
GBS at three different target levels. On each day, six negative samples and either two
or four replicates of each positive panel member were tested (15 days x 2 strains x 2-4
replicates per panel member = 90 replicates per target level). The results of the study
are summarized in Table 2.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Sample Stability
Studies were conducted to evaluate the stability of samples of vaginal/rectal swab
culture matrix prior to addition to the Process Buffer. Testing was performed using
Lim and Carrot broth vaginal/rectal swab culture matrix that was seeded with S.
agalactiae strain ATCC BAA-611 at 2X LoD (Section M(1)(d)). Enrichment
cultures in both Lim and Carrot broth were shown to be stable for up to 48 hours at
20-25°C or 7 days at 2-8°C. Following addition to Process Buffer, samples stored at
2-8°C were found to be stable for up to 72 hours prior to or after heat lysis.
Process Control
The Solana GBS Assay Process Buffer Tube contains a Process Control that is
designed to monitor sample processing and the presence of substances that are
inhibitory to DNA amplification, as well as reagent or instrument failure. Specimens
that are negative for S. agalactiae by the Solana GBS Assay and in which the Process
Control is also not detected are reported as “Invalid” and should be retested from the
processed sample. If an Invalid result is obtained upon retesting, another aliquot of

the same broth culture should be processed or a new enrichment culture should be
prepared.
External Controls
External Controls should be tested according to guidelines or requirements of local,
provincial and/or federal regulations or accreditation organizations. External Positive
and Negative Controls should be processed in the same manner as patient specimens
to monitor for substantial reagent or instrument failure.
Positive and Negative External Controls from the Quidel Molecular GBS Control Set
were tested on each day that patient specimens were evaluated during the prospective
Clinical Study described in Section M(3)(a). A total of 52 pairs of Positive and
Negative Controls were tested during the study, all of which (100%) produced the
expected results.
Additional Positive and Negative External Controls were also tested during the
Reproducibility and Repeatability Studies and in all cases produced the expected
results (refer to Section M(1)(a)).
d. Detection Limit:
Limit of Detection
The LoD of the Solana GBS Assay was determined for six strains of S. agalactiae
using contrived Lim broth-enriched vaginal/rectal samples that were seeded with S.
agalactiae cells at different concentrations. Initial testing was performed with a single
lot of Solana GBS Assay reagents. The preliminary LoD for each strain was defined
as the lowest concentration at which ≥19/20 replicates produced a positive result. The
preliminary LoD was confirmed by testing two additional lots of Solana GBS Assay
reagents at the estimated LoD target level. For the LoD for each strain to be
confirmed ≥19/20 replicates with each reagent lot had to produce positive results. The
results of the study are summarized in Table 3.
The highest LoD among the six strains of S. agalactiae tested was for strain ATCC
12403 at 2.6 x 106 CFU/mL. The LoD for this strain was shown to be the same in the
presence of contrived Lim and Carrot broth-enriched vaginal/rectal swab matrices,
demonstrating that the analytical sensitivity of the Solana GBS Assay is independent
of the type of broth culture medium used.

Inclusivity (Analytical Reactivity)
The inclusivity of the Solana GBS Assay was evaluated by testing 14 different strains
of S. agalactiae in addition to those included in the LoD Study (Table 4). Each strain
was tested in triplicate in Lim broth cultured vaginal/rectal swab matrix at the
claimed LoD target level (2.6 x 106 CFU/mL of culture medium). All the replicates of
each of strain produced positive results. These results are acceptable.

Bioinformatic Analysis
The inclusivity of the Solana GBS Assay primers and probes for the detection of GBS
was analyzed in silico using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST).
Overall, the region was shown to be highly conserved. One strain of S. agalactiae
was found to have a single mismatch near the middle of the reverse primer, although
this is not predicted to have an adverse effect of amplification/detection. These results
are acceptable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity Study
The analytical specificity of the Solana GBS Assay was evaluated by testing a panel

Bioinformatic Analysis
In silico analysis using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) was
performed to evaluate the potential for cross-reaction of the Solana GBS Assay
primers and probes with non-target organisms. No significant similarity was observed
between the Solana atoB amplicon, primers or probes and sequences from other
species. These results are acceptable.
Contamination Study
The potential for false-positive results with the Solana GBS Assay due to within run or
between run cross-contamination was evaluated by testing an alternating series of S.
agalactiae “high positive” and negative samples in successive instrument runs, in
addition to Positive and Negative External Controls. The high positive samples contained
S. agalactiae at a concentration of 1.8 x 108 CFU/mL of Lim broth vaginal/rectal matrix.
Negative samples comprised simulated throat swab matrix alone. The expected results
were obtained for all S. agalactiae positive and negative samples (50/50 each). Each of
the Positive and Negative External Controls also produced the expected results (10/10
each). These results are acceptable.
f. Assay cut-off:
The algorithm parameters for the Solana GBS Assay were established through
analysis of fluorescence amplification curves obtained from testing known GBS
positive and negative samples on the Solana Instrument. The cut-offs were chosen to

g. Assay interference:
Potentially Interfering Substances
The potential for interference with the Solana GBS Assay was evaluated with
endogenous and exogenous substances that may be present in vaginal/rectal swab
specimens (Table 6). Each substance was tested in triplicate in the presence and
absence of S. agalactiae at 2X LoD (5.2 x 106 CFU/mL) using samples prepared with
Lim broth-enriched vaginal/rectal matrix. No false positive, false negative or Invalid
test results were observed under any of the conditions tested. These results are
acceptable.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
The LoD of the Solana GBS Assay was initially established using samples prepared
with matrix derived from Lim broth vaginal/rectal swab cultures. The claimed LoD
was subsequently confirmed by testing samples prepared in matrix derived from
Carrot broth vaginal/rectal swab cultures. Refer to Section M(1)(d). Additional
studies also demonstrated that equivalent Solana GBS Assay results are obtained with
Lim and Carrot broth cultures that are incubated for 18 or 24 hours.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The performance of the Solana GBS Assay was evaluated in a prospective Clinical
Study that was performed at four (4) sites in the U.S. Vaginal/rectal swab specimens
were obtained from a total of 753 pregnant women at between 35 and 37 weeks of
gestation. The age of the subjects ranged from 15 to 44 years old. The specimens
were inoculated into either Lim broth (403) or Carrot broth (350) and incubated for
between 18 and 24 hours at 35°C after which the cultures were tested using the
Solana GBS Assay and the results were compared to those obtained from subculture
of the broth to blood agar, followed by Gram staining of suspected colonies of S.
agalactiae, catalase testing (S. agalactiae is catalase negative) and latex agglutination
using GBS-specific reagents. The results of the study are summarized in Table 7.
One specimen produced repeated Invalid results with the Solana assay and was
excluded from the analysis of performance.
