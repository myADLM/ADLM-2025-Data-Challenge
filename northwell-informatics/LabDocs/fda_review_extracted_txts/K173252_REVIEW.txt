I. Device Description:
This submission is for a single drug to be included in the gram negative “ID/AST” or “AST
only” panel. The ID portion of the ID/AST combination panel was not subject for review in
this submission.
The Phoenix AST method is a broth based microdilution test. The Phoenix panel is a sealed
and self-inoculating molded polystyrene tray, with 136 micro-wells containing dried
reagents. The ID/AST combination panel includes an ID side (51 wells) with dried substrates
for bacterial identification and an AST side (85 wells). The AST panel contains a wide range
of two-fold doubling dilution concentrations of antimicrobial agents and growth and
fluorescent controls at appropriate well locations. The AST panel does not include wells for
isolate identification.
The Phoenix System utilizes a redox indicator for the detection of organism growth in the
presence of an antimicrobial agent. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be
preliminarily identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in ID
broth, and equated to a 0.5 McFarland suspension using a nephelometer device. A further
dilution is made into AST broth (a cation-adjusted formulation of Mueller-Hinton broth
containing 0.010% Tween 80), to which the redox-buffered oxidation-reduction AST
indicator solution is added producing a blue color in the wells. The concentration of
organisms in the final AST broth suspension is approximately 5 X 105 CFU/mL.
The Phoenix AST Broth is poured into the inoculation port of the AST panel and the
inoculum flows into the panel, filling panel wells. Polyethylene caps are applied to seal the
inoculation ports. An air admittance port is located in the panel lid to ensure adequate oxygen
tension in the panel for the duration of the test. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and
loaded into the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System instrument where panels are
continuously incubated at 35˚C ± 1˚C.
Continuous measurements of changes to the indicator as well as bacterial turbidity are used
in the determination of bacterial growth. The instrument takes readings every 20 minutes.

--- Page 4 ---
Organisms growing in the presence of a given antimicrobial agent reduce the indicator
(changing it to a pink color). This signals organism growth and resistance to that
antimicrobial agent. Organisms killed or inhibited by the antimicrobial agent do not cause
reduction of the indicator and therefore do not produce a color change. The Phoenix
instrument reads and records the results of the antimicrobial tests contained in the panel and
interprets the reactions (based on the organism identification) to give a minimal inhibitory
concentration (MIC) value and category interpretations (susceptible, intermediate, resistant
or not susceptible). AST results are available within 4 to 16 hours. This is an autoread result;
no manual readings are possible with this system.
Additional comments concerning specific organism/antimicrobial combinations is provided
from the software-driven “EXPERT” system, using rules derived from CLSI documentation.

L. Test Principle:
The BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution method
that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection of
organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells containing serial
two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control wells” that contain no
antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing was conducted at three clinical trial sites. Testing was
performed using inocula prepared manually using the PhoenixSpec nephelometer and
the automated BD Phoenix AP instrument. The mode MIC value was determined and
the reproducibility was calculated based on MIC values falling within ± 1 dilution of
the mode MIC value.
Thirteen strains with known Ceftolozane/tazobactam modal MIC values were
provided to the testing sites by BD with isolate identification and expected MIC result

E. cloacae (2), E. coli (1), K. pneumoniae (2), and P. aeruginosa (5). Isolates were
tested in triplicate on three separate days as follows:
13 strains x 3 replicates x 3 sites x 3 days= 351 results
Because there were three off-scale results, reproducibility was calculated for best case
and worst case scenarios as described in the AST Special Controls Guidance. Results
of the inter-site and intra-site reproducibility studies were acceptable and
demonstrated best case and worst case results of greater than 95%. A summary of the

ATCC 25922, E. coli ATCC 35218, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, and P.
aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were performed each day of the challenge and clinical study
testing with the reference method and with the BD Phoenix Systems. The inocula
were standardized using both the Phoenix AP instrument and PhoenixSpec
Nephelometer (manual). A sufficient number of tests were performed and all quality
control results for the BD Phoenix fell within the acceptable ranges as per the FDA
drug label, demonstrating that the BD Phoenix System can consistently produce
quality control results in the recommended range for ceftazidime/avibactam. Results
demonstrate that acceptable results were achieved >95% of the time by both Phoenix
AP and manual inoculum preparation methods as shown in Table 3 below.

aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (0.25/4 to 1/4 μg/mL). A MIC value of ≤0.25/4 μg/mL was
used to indicate that the results for these three QC organisms were acceptable. The
footnote below is included in Table 1, Quality Control Organisms and Expected
Results of the Package Insert for Phoenix GN Panels (Section 3).
“The lowest dilution of the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System
ceftazidime/avibactam MIC range is ≤0.25/4 µg/mL. Obtaining this value was
considered as an indicator that the quality control test results were acceptable.”
In addition, special instruction is noted in FDA approved drug labeling and the most
recent CLSI M100 to ensure the β-lactamases production integrity of E. coli ATCC
35218 and K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603. The footnote below is also included in
Table 1:
“Refer to the current CLSI M100 table, “MIC: Quality Control Ranges (µg/mL)
for Nonfastidious Organisms (Unsupplemented Mueller-Hinton Medium [Cation-
Adjusted if Broth]” for additional information on maintaining the integrity of
these QC isolates.”
Growth Rate: Six isolates failed to grow during the clinical study. The overall growth
rate during the clinical studies was 99.5%.
Purity Check Plates: Purity check plates were inoculated from the standardized
organism suspensions for both the Phoenix and reference methods. Any isolate that
showed mixed growth on the purity check plate was considered noncompliant and not
included in result analysis.
Inoculum Density Control: The PhoenixSpec Nephelometer was used to prepare the
inocula for testing of the clinical, challenge, reproducibility and QC isolates. The
same inoculum suspension was used for both the Phoenix System and the reference
method testing. The BD Phoenix AP instrument was used to standardize the inocula
for challenge, QC, and reproducibility isolates. Validation data for both the
PhoenixSpec and the Phoenix AP instrument was provided and found to be
acceptable.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The accuracy of results obtained with the Phoenix System was determined by
comparison to the CLSI-recommended broth dilution method (reference method).
Reference panels were prepared according to CLSI M07-A10 guidelines. During the
comparative studies, the reference results were read after 16 to 18 hours of
incubation. Sites performed testing on Gram negative isolates using BD Phoenix and
reference panel formats as appropriate for gram negative organisms. Antimicrobial
agents in the test and reference panels had identical dilution ranges which were
appropriate for the interpretive breakpoints of the drug. Testing was performed using
at least two different production lots of Phoenix panels, AST broth and AST indicator
at each study site. A minimum of three different lots of the Phoenix panel were used
across all sites for the entire study. Phoenix and reference panels were inoculated
using the same organism suspension.
Growth in the Phoenix panels was determined from data recorded by the instrument.
Performance was analyzed using FDA breakpoints for ceftolozane/tazobactam, and
results were compared to results obtained by the broth microdilution reference
method based on the guidelines provided in the Class II Special Controls Guidance
Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems.
Clinical and Challenge:
A total of 1210 clinical isolates were tested at the three study sites and included both
fresh and stock isolates. Stock isolates comprised 11.6% of total isolates tested.
Clinical isolates tested included representatives of species listed in the FDA
pharmaceutical drug label and were tested using inocula prepared by the PhoenixSpec
nephelometer (manual method).
A total of 135 unique challenge isolates with expected results (expected MIC value of
each isolate was the mode after testing with the reference broth dilution multiple
times) were also supplied to the testing sites by the sponsor. Challenge isolates were
obtained from BD’s internal collection and from external laboratories. The challenge
isolates were randomized and divided equally among the testing sites. Results
obtained for Challenge isolates using the Phoenix System were compared to expected
MIC results. Identification and expected results were masked to the study sites. The
inocula for the challenge isolates were prepared using both the PhoenixSpec
Nephelometer (manual method) and the Phoenix AP (automated method).
The performance evaluation summary of essential and categorical agreement results
for clinical and challenge isolates with inocula prepared using the PhoenixSpec
nephelometer (manual method) is shown in Table 4.1 below.

Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the result of the reference method and that of
BD Phoenix within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are
on scale for both the BD Phoenix panel and the reference method. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the
interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the BD Phoenix result.
The phoenix ceftolozane/tazobactam performance met the acceptance criteria. For
Enterobacteriaceae, the EA and CA were at 96.5% and 96.8%, respectively. For
Pseudomonas aeruginosa the EA and CA were at 96.6% and 98.6%, respectively.
Because of similar performance, the combined Enterobacteriaceae + P. aeruginosa
performance was presented in the final labeling with the footnote below:
“Enterobacteriaceae (1034) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (145) were included
in the above combined performance, and performance was similar and acceptable
for both.”
However, a high very major (vmj) discrepancy rate (18.2%, 2/11) was observed with
E. coli when analyzed separately. The EA and CA observed for 277 E. coli during the
clinical study were at 98.6% and 98.9%, respectively. To address the observed vmj
discrepancy, two additional studies were conducted. In the first study, reference
method was tested in replicates on the two vmj E. coli isolates. In the second study, a
new set of 66 additional resistant E. coli isolates were tested by both the reference
method and the BD Phoenix panel. No vmj errors observed in these two studies. The
footnote below is included for the overall ceftolozane/tazobactam CA in the labeling:
“A very major (vmj) error rate of 18.2% (2/11) was observed with E. coli. EA
and CA for E. coli were > 98.5%. Reference method testing performed in
replicates on the two vmj error E. coli isolates showed no vmj errors. An
additional comparative study that included 66 resistant E. coli isolates showed no
vmj errors.”

A trend towards higher MIC was observed with claimed Enterobacteriaceae isolates
and P. aeruginosa when compared to the CLSI broth microdilution reference method.
This trending and the potential for occurrence of major discrepancies when testing
clinical and challenge isolate results with the Phoenix Ceftolozane/tazobactam was
addressed by adding the following footnote:

BD Phoenix Ceftolozane/Tazobactam MIC values tended to be in exact agreement
or at least one doubling dilution higher when testing Enterobacteriaceae or P.
aeruginosa compared to the reference broth micro-dilution.
Reportable Ranges:
Different reportable ranges for Ceftolozane/tazobactam were evaluated with acceptable
performance for the organimsm groups below:
≤0.25/4 - ≥32/4 µg/mL for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
≤0.5/4 - ≥32/4 µg/mL for Providencia stuartii
≤1/4 - ≥32/4 µg/mL for Proteus spp. other than Proteus mirabilis
Enzyme Group Characterization/Resistance Markers Information:
Third-two Enterobacteriaceae with beta-lactamases were included in the
ceftolozane/tazobactam comparative studies. They were AmpC (2), KPC (14), OXA (7),
CTX-M (8), TEM (10), and SHV (7). The Enterobacteriaceae included Enterobacter
cloacae, E. coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
The study indicated that in the presence of ESBL β-lactamase TEM, E. coli (7) were
susceptible to Ceftolozane/Tazobactam with MIC <2/4 µg/mL; K. pneumoniae (6)
demonstrated MIC values ranging from ≤0.25/4 to >32/4 µg/mL in the presence of β-
lactamase CTX-M, OXA, TEM, and/or SHV. For KPC, K. pneumoniae (8) had MIC
ranging from ≤0.25/4 to >32/4 µg/mL; however, Enterobacter cloacae (5) and K.
oxytoca (1) were susceptible with MIC <2/4 µg/mL.
In addition, seven metallo-beta-lactamase producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa were
tested and demonstrated resistance (≥32/4µg/mL) to Ceftolozane/tazobactam. The
following limitation was added to the Ceftolozane/tazobactam labeling regarding other
resistance markers and enzyme characterization:
“Enzyme group characterization was not available at the time of comparative
testing, and therefore the performance of the BD Phoenix
Ceftolozane/Tazobactam is unknown for the following: Pseudomonas aeruginosa
(chromosomal AmpC, loss of OprD, and up-regulation MexXY, MexAB);
Enterobacteriaceae (metallo-beta-lactamases).”
