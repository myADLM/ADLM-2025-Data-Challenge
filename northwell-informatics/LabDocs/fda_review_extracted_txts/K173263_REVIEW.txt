H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Xpert Carba-R Assay, performed on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems, is a
qualitative in vitro diagnostic test designed for the detection and differentiation of the
bla , bla , bla , bla , and bla gene sequences associated with carbapenem-
KPC NDM VIM OXA-48 IMP
non-susceptibility. The test utilizes automated real-time polymerase chain reaction
(PCR).
The Xpert Carba-R Assay is intended as an aid to infection control in the detection of
carbapenem-non-susceptible bacteria that colonize patients in healthcare settings. A
negative Xpert Carba-R Assay result does not preclude the presence of other resistance
mechanisms.
The Xpert Carba-R Assay is for use with the following sample types:
Pure Colonies
The assay is performed on carbapenem-non-susceptible pure colonies of
Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, when grown
on blood agar or MacConkey agar. For testing pure colonies, the Xpert Carba-R Assay
should be used in conjunction with other laboratory tests including phenotypic
antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
The identification of a bla , bla , or bla metallo-beta-lactamase gene (i.e., the
IMP NDM VIM
genes that encode the IMP, NDM, and VIM metallo-beta-lactamases, respectively) may
be used as an aid to clinicians in determining appropriate therapeutic strategies for
patients with known or suspected carbapenem-non- susceptible bacterial infections.
Rectal and Perirectal Swab Specimens
The assay is performed on rectal and perirectal swab specimens from patients at risk for
intestinal colonization with carbapenem-non-susceptible bacteria. Concomitant cultures
are necessary to recover organisms for epidemiological typing, antimicrobial susceptibility
testing, and for further confirmatory bacterial identification.
The Xpert Carba-R Assay, when performed on rectal and perirectal swab specimens, is not
2

--- Page 3 ---
intended to guide or monitor treatment for carbapenem-non-susceptible bacterial
infections or to determine infection from carbapenem-non-susceptible bacteria.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as the Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
The Xpert Carba-R Assay detects bla , bla , bla , bla , and bla from
KPC NDM VIM OXA-48 IMP
rectal and perirectal swab specimens and is not for bacterial identification or to report
susceptibility status.
The detection of assay targets by the Xpert Carba-R Assay does not indicate the presence
of viable organisms containing the resistance marker.
The Xpert Carba-R Assay is not a sub-typing tool and does not report variants of the
bla , bla , bla , bla , and bla genes.
KPC NDM VIM OXA-48 IMP
Antimicrobial agents, such as new beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations,
have varying activity against bacteria producing different types of beta-lactamases. Xpert
Carba-R Assay results showing the presence of bla , bla , and bla metallo-beta-
IMP VIM NDM
lactamase genes from pure colonies of the claimed organisms may be helpful in
determining a therapeutic strategy that includes beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor
combinations.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The Xpert Carba-R Assay uses PCR technology on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems,
which extract, amplify, and detect the target DNA.
I. Device Description:
The Xpert Carba-R Assay is an automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in
vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of the bla , bla , bla , bla , and
KPC NDM VIM OXA-48
bla gene sequences from pure colonies of target organisms, rectal swab specimens, and
IMP
perirectal swab specimens. The Xpert Carba-R Assay is intended as an aid for infection
control to monitor the spread of carbapenem-non-susceptible organisms in healthcare
settings. The assay is performed on Cepheid GeneXpert Instrument Systems (GeneXpert Dx,
GeneXpert Infinity-48, GeneXpert Infinity-48s, and GeneXpert Infinity-80 systems). The
GeneXpert Instrument Systems utilize single-use, disposable cartridges (Xpert Carba-R
cartridges) containing PCR reagents that allow for automated sample preparation,
amplification, and real-time detection of gene targets in approximately 50 minutes. A Sample
3

--- Page 4 ---
Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) have been incorporated into the
assay design to address key failure modes that could result in a false negative determination.
The GeneXpert Instrument Systems (GeneXpert Dx Systems and the GeneXpert Infinity
Systems) have 1 to 80 randomly accessible modules, depending upon the instrument, that are
each capable of performing separate sample processing and real-time PCR tests. Because the
cartridges are self-contained and specimens never come into contact with working parts of
the instrument modules, cross-contamination between samples is minimized.

L. Test Principle:
The Xpert Carba-R Assay cartridges contain reagents for the detection of bla , bla ,
KPC NDM
bla , bla , and bla gene sequences from perirectal swab specimens. Each swab is
VIM OXA-48 IMP
resuspended in 5 mL of Sample Reagent. The sample is vortexed then transferred (1.7 mL) to
the sample chamber of a disposable Xpert Carba-R Assay cartridge. The user initiates a test
from the system-user interface and places the cartridge into the GeneXpert instrument
platform, which performs hands-off real-time, multiplex PCR for the detection of target
sequences.
Results of the assay run are interpreted by the GeneXpert Instrument System software from
measured fluorescent signals and embedded calculation algorithms. The results are
automatically generated at the end of the process in a report that can be viewed and printed.
Basic users see test results reported as “red” highlighted for DETECTED results and
“green” highlighted for NOT DETECTED results. Additional results that can be reported
include: INVALID, ERROR, and NO RESULT.
Interpretation of Results
The Xpert Carba-R Assay provides test results for the IMP, VIM, NDM, KPC, and OXA-48
target DNA sequences. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control
(PCC) have been designed for the assay as internal controls to enable the GeneXpert
Instrument System to detect specific failure modes related to assay performance. The PCC is
considered to PASS if the fluorescence generated meets the validated acceptance criteria. If
the PCC fails for any of the IMP, VIM, NDM, KPC, and OXA-48 targets, or SPC target, a
probe check error is reported and the test will not continue. The assay also reports if the test
has an INVALID, ERROR or NO RESULT. Under these conditions, the test will need to be
repeated using a new sample and cartridge. Retest procedures are described in the Xpert
Carba-R package insert. An interpretation table for test results is shown in Table 1.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A multi-center reproducibility study of the Xpert Carba-R Assay was conducted using
samples suspended in perirectal matrix. An 11-member panel was tested that
included: 1) two different organisms for each of the five resistance genes detected by
the Xpert Carba-R Assay and 2) one negative sample for all five gene targets. Each
organism was spiked into a pooled negative perirectal matrix at low positive (~1X
LoD) and moderate positive levels (2-3X LoD). To measure site-to-site
reproducibility, the (11)-member panel was tested in replicates of four each day at
three (3) sites over a six day testing period with two operators per site. Three lots of

Xpert Carba-R Assay cartridges were used at each testing site. A total of 1584
samples suspended in perirectal matrix were evaluated, where 144 replicates for each
of the 11 different panel members were tested. In perirectal matrix, 99.4%
(1574/1584) of samples were successful and produced the expected result on the first
attempt. Four (4) ERROR cases, four (4) INVALID results, and two (2) NO RESULT
outcomes were reported. All ten samples yielded valid results upon repeat testing.

aResults with non-zero Ct values out of 144.
At ~1X LoD, the expected target was not detected in some samples (See Table 2
above). The lowest % total agreement, 92.4% (133/144), was observed with the low
positive VIM sample. All moderate positive samples (2-3X LoD) gave the expected
result. All negative samples were correctly identified as negative (144/144). Of the 76
external control samples run, 98.7% (75/76) gave a result on the first attempt that was
the expected result. Retest of the one indeterminate control sample was successful.
Agreement between sites, operators, and lots was evaluated using Fisher’s Exact test.
The data presented in Table 2 and Table 3 demonstrated an acceptable reproducibility
for the Xpert Carba-R Assay on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems.

External Controls
Commercially-available external controls can also be run in accordance with local,
state, and federal accrediting organizations, as applicable. For each day of the study,
an external negative control and two types of experimental positive controls were
tested. One external positive control consisted of E. coli cells containing a plasmid
with an insert carrying amplicon sequences from all five Xpert Carba-R target analyte
genes (Multivalent External Positive Control). The second external positive control
consisted of individual carbapenemase-producing bacteria, each harboring only one
of the Xpert Carba-R target carbapenemase genes. On each testing day, one negative
control, the five-gene construct positive control, and two of five individual bacterial
positive controls were tested. Of the 970 external control samples run, 99.2%
(962/970) gave a valid result on the first attempt. Retesting of the eight indeterminate
controls gave the expected results.

External controls include the following bacteria harboring target genes:
Multivalent External Positive Control—External positive control (inactivated
Escherichia coli carrying plasmid with KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP, and OXA-48
gene sequences)
Individual Positive Controls
· K. pneumoniae KPC (ATCC BAA-1705)
· K. pneumoniae NDM (ATCC BAA-2146)
· K. pneumoniae VIM (NCTC 13439)
· K. pneumoniae OXA-48 (NCTC 13442)
· Escherichia coli IMP (NCTC 13476)
External Negative Control—Inactivated E. coli containing a plasmid with no
resistance gene inserted.
Internal Control (IC) Reaction Analysis
Internal controls enable the system to detect specific failure modes that could
potentially result in an incorrect test result. Each Xpert Carba-R Assay includes a
Sample Processing Control (SPC) and Probe Check Control (PCC) pre-loaded in the
cartridge and provided with the assay.
Sample Processing Control (SPC)
The SPC contains Bacillus globigii that is included in each cartridge to verify
adequate processing of the sample. The SPC verifies that lysis of bacteria has
occurred if the organisms are present and verifies the effectiveness of each sample
preparation step—reaction tube filling, reaction components are present and
functioning, and monitoring for the presence of potential inhibitor(s) in the PCR
assay. Test results are reported as INVALID if the SPC fails to meet the valid
minimum or maximum Ct specification.
Probe Check control (PCC)
The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, real-time PCR tube filling in the cartridge,
probe integrity, and dye stability. The PCC is considered to PASS if the
fluorescence generated meets the validated acceptance criteria. If the PCC fails
for any of the IMP, VIM, NDM, KPC, and OXA-48 targets or SPC target, a probe
check error is reported and the test will not continue. If a probe check error is
reported, the test may be repeated using a new sample, new cartridge, and new
reagents.
Stability Studies
A number of studies were conducted to establish the specimen stability of perirectal
swabs with the Xpert Carba-R Assay. This study was performed to: 1) establish the
specimen stability for the perirectal swabs after specimen collection but prior to
transfer to the Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent and 2) establish the specimen stability
of perirectal swabs eluted into Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent.
11

--- Page 12 ---
Stability of Perirectal Swabs
In order to support a claim for the period of time that perirectal swabs could be
held before transfer to the Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent and further processing,
a mixture of five carbapenemase-producing bacteria (at approximately 3X LoD)
was spiked onto negative perirectal matrix swabs to create known positive
samples. Both positive and negative matrix swab samples were tested with the
Xpert Carba-R Assay after being stored for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days at 2°C, 8°C, 15°C
and 28°C. Four (4) replicate negative matrix swab samples and 14 replicate
positive matrix swab samples were tested per time point and temperature
condition; at the time of testing, swabs were then added to Xpert Carba-R Sample
Reagent. Eight replicate positive and negative matrix swab samples were tested at
time t=0.
Under the conditions of this study, negative specimens at all storage conditions
and temperatures tested were correctly identified using the Xpert Carba-R Assay.
For positive specimens, 229 of 232 replicates (with all five targets) were
DETECTED. Three samples had one target missed. When retested, 2 of the 3
samples yielded the expected result (one sample was not retested). The data
supports that perirectal swabs are stable when stored at 8°C –28°C for up to seven
(7) days from the time of collection prior to transfer to Xpert Carba-R Sample
Reagent to initiate testing with the Xpert Carba-R Assay.
Stability after Perirectal Swabs Resuspended in Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent
To establish a claim for the stability of perirectal swabs in the Xpert Carba-R
Sample Reagent, pooled negative perirectal swab matrix was spiked at
approximately 3X LoD with a mixture of five carbapenemase-producing bacteria
that harbored targets of the Xpert Carba-R Assay. Aliquots of the positive swab
matrix (with bacteria) in Sample Reagent were prepared to create positive
samples. Negative samples in the study consisted of aliquots of negative pooled
swab matrix containing Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent. Positive and negative
swab matrix samples were tested with the Xpert Carba-R Assay after being stored
for 1, 3, 5 and 7 days at 2°C, 8°C, 15°C, and 28°C. Four (4) replicate negative
matrix samples and 14 replicate positive matrix swab samples were tested per
time point and temperature condition. Positive and negative matrix swab
replicates were also tested at time t=0.
Under the conditions of this study, positive and negative specimens at all storage
conditions and temperatures tested were correctly reported using the Xpert Carba-
R Assay. The data supports that sample material from perirectal swabs are stable
in Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent for up to 5 days when stored at 2°C – 28°C
prior to testing with the Xpert Carba-R Assay.
Of the 655 runs in the stability study, four (4) runs (0.61%) produced
indeterminate GeneXpert results—(2) NO RESULT, (1) ERROR, and (1)
INVALID. Three runs were repeated yielding the expected Xpert Carba-R Assay
result. The one invalid run was not repeated.
12

--- Page 13 ---
The stability studies support the following storage conditions prior to testing with the
Xpert Carba-R Assay: 1) up to 5 days at 15°C- 28°C for perirectal swab specimens in
transport tubes before transfer to Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent and 2) up to 5 days
at 2°C-28°C for perirectal swab specimens in Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent.
d. Detection limit:
Using whole organisms seeded into perirectal matrix, a study was conducted to
determine the Limit of Detection (LoD) of the Xpert Carba-R Assay for
carbapenemase-producing organisms harboring the bla , bla , bla , bla ,
KPC NDM VIM OXA-48
and bla gene sequence targets. The LoD was defined as the lowest concentration
IMP
(reported as cells/swab and cells/mL in Sample Reagent) of sample that can be
reproducibly distinguished from negative samples with 95% confidence. Pre-screened
negative perirectal matrix was used to confirm that the Limit of Blank (LoB) was
zero. Two strains harboring each assay target were tested. Point estimates and two-
sided 95% confidence intervals for the analytical LoD (reported as CFU/swab) were
determined using probit regression analysis. The LoD estimate was verified by
preparing two independent dilutions of each bacterial culture to the point estimate
LoD value. Twenty measurements (10 from each dilution) were tested, and the study
was completed using at least two unique lots of Xpert Carba-R Assay reagents.
Of the 2,815 runs in the LoD study to estimate the LoD of various targets in perirectal
matrix (excluding the external controls), 33 runs (1.2%) provided indeterminate
GeneXpert results (4 NO RESULT, 8 ERROR, 21 INVALID). All 33 runs were
repeated yielding Carba-R valid results as expected. A total of 190 of 192 external
control runs provided valid GeneXpert results. Repeat testing yielded expected results
for the external controls.
All the data was collected with the GeneXpert Dx software version 4.4a on the
GeneXpert Dx GX-IV and GX-XVI instruments and with the Infinity Xpertise
software version 6.1 on the Infinity-80 instrument. Table 4 shows the estimated LoD
results by Probit Analysis for the test panel in perirectal matrix. The LoDs for assay
targets tested in perirectal swabs were similar to the results previously determined for
rectal swab (K160901).

e. Analytical specificity:
Using whole organisms seeded into perirectal matrix, the analytical specificity of the
Xpert Carba-R Assay was evaluated with a panel of 62 well-characterized
carbapenem-susceptible bacteria or bacteria with carbapenem non-susceptibility due
to genes or mechanisms other than the Xpert Carba-R target genes. Panel members
were resuspended in negative perirectal matrix. A set of 31 commensal/enteric
microorganisms was also evaluated in the study, as well as human genomic DNA.
Bacteria were seeded into negative matrix at >106 CFU/mL (Peptostreptococcus
anaerobius tested at 5 x 105 CFU/mL) in triplicate and tested with the Xpert Carba-R
Assay. Viruses were tested at > 1 x 105TCID /mL or greater than 2.5 x 107 RNA
50
copies/mL. Human cells were tested at 1 x1 05 cells/mL. For the Analytical
Specificity Study panel, please refer to Table 7 and Table 8 below.

Of the 94 potentially cross-reactive organisms and nucleic acid tested, including
organisms exhibiting antibiotic resistance mechanisms other than production of KPC,
NDM, VIM, IMP and OXA-48, none were detected with the Xpert Carba-R Assay.
Of the 283 tests in perirectal matrix, including controls, one (0.4%) run was
indeterminate (1 INVALID). The indeterminate run was successfully repeated and was
reported as NOT DETECTED for all five targets (KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP and OXA-
48) as expected. All external positive and negative controls were correctly reported as
expected.
All the data were collected on the GeneXpert Dx (GX-IV) instrument using the
GeneXpert Dx software version 4.4a.
f. Assay cut-off:
For IMP, VIM, NDM, KPC, and OXA-48 gene targets, the valid cycle threshold (Ct)
range was 3.0 to 38.0. For the SPC, the valid Ct range was set from 3.0 to 40.0. A Ct
value outside the valid range is reported as NOT DETECTED. The Ct cut-offs are
included as automatic calculations in the assay definition file (ADF) provided with
the Xpert Carba-R Assay. Assay cut-off values have not changed from those
described in K152614.
g. Interfering substances:
A study was conducted to assess the inhibitory effects of substances potentially
encountered in perirectal swab specimens on the performance of the Xpert Carba-R
Assay. Twenty-four substances were evaluated at “worst case scenario”
concentrations. Eight replicate positive samples were tested per substance. Negative
samples consisted of pooled negative perirectal swab matrix with/without the
interfering substance (not seeded with carbapenemase-producing organisms).
Controls consisted of positive and negative samples with no interfering substances
added. Positive samples were prepared from a mix of five carbapenemase-producing
organisms harboring KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP and OXA-48 gene sequences seeded
into pooled negative perirectal swab matrix to give concentrations that were 3X
analytical LoD (Table 9). The list of potentially interfering substances tested is shown
in Table 10.

Results showed that the majority of the substances tested at their potentially highest
concentration relative to the controls did not interfere with the Xpert Carba-R Assay.
Under the conditions of this study, 22 of the 24 potentially interfering substances
tested at their potentially highest concentration (0.25% w/v) did not interfere with the
Xpert Carba-R Assay. Inhibitory effects were observed with two substances, barium
sulfate and Pepto-Bismol, when tested at 0.25% w/v in perirectal swab matrix.
Interference with the Xpert Carba-R Assay may be observed with barium sulfate at >
0.1% w/v and Pepto-Bismol at > 0.025% w/v. Of the 468 tests (not including the
external controls), 22 tests provided indeterminate GeneXpert results (3 ERROR and
19 INVALID). All 22 indeterminate GeneXpert results were successfully repeated.
Each of the external controls gave the expected GeneXpert test result. All the data
were collected using the GeneXpert Dx software version 4.4a on the GeneXpert Dx
(GX-IV and GX-XVI) instruments.

Competitive Interference
To evaluate the potential competitive inhibitory effect of multiple carbapenemase-
producing organisms on the performance of the Xpert Carba-R Assay in perirectal
swab specimens, a study was performed by testing various combinations of
carbapenemase-producing organisms seeded at high and low concentrations into
natural matrix. High concentrations of organisms corresponded to ~1x106 CFU/mL
and low concentrations corresponded to 2X LoD. An inhibitory effect was observed
for two out of five targets (IMP and NDM) when a low concentration of each target
was present in combination with a high concentration of another assay target. No
inhibitory effect was observed for the VIM, KPC, and OXA-48 targets. Table 11
reports the number of target replicates that were detected in the competitive
interference study with perirectal swab matrix.

For those targets not detected at 2X LoD (6 or fewer replicates detected), an additional
study was performed where the low target concentration was increased to 4X LoD to
evaluate the competitive inhibitory effect. No inhibitory effect was observed for the two
targets (IMP and NDM) at 4X LoD in the presence of high concentrations of the other
targets for the Xpert Carba-R Assay.

h. Carry-over:
The purpose of the Carry-Over Study was to determine the carry-over rate of
contamination in negative samples due to the nucleic acid extraction and amplification
of high positive samples in the GeneXpert cartridge. In this study, a negative sample
was tested in a GeneXpert module immediately following the testing of a high titer
positive sample in the same GeneXpert module. The high positive sample was
composed of inactivated E. coli cells containing a plasmid with all five Xpert Carba-R
target analyte genes (KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP and OXA-48 targets) diluted in Sample
Reagent with perirectal swab matrix to a concentration of 1 x 106 CFU/mL. The
testing pattern was repeated 25 times on two GeneXpert modules for a total of 102
tests (25 high positive samples and 26 negative samples per module). For each day of
the study, an external negative control and two types of experimental positive controls
were tested as described previously. All 52 negative samples reported NOT
DETECTED results for all five Xpert Carba-R Assay targets as expected. All positive
samples correctly reported all Xpert Carba-R targets as DETECTED. Study results
indicated no evidence of sample or amplicon carry-over contamination in the
GeneXpert modules.

Prospective Study #1—MultiCenter Study
Performance characteristics of the Xpert Carba-R Assay were evaluated in a multi-
center study using perirectal swab specimens. The positive percent agreement (PPA)
and negative percent agreement (NPA) of the Xpert Carba-R Assay were evaluated
relative to a Composite Reference Method. Due to limited historical information on
the detection of carbapenem non-susceptible organisms harboring assay targets by
this method, which consisted of Reference Culture + PCR and Sequencing of the
amplification product, performance was reported as PPA and NPA instead of
sensitivity and specificity. Five geographically diverse sites were selected (across the
United States), and prospectively collected paired perirectal swab specimens were
collected from subjects who were hospitalized or in a long-term care facility. Highly
soiled perirectal swabs were excluded from the study. Contrived specimens were
included in the study due to the expected low prevalence for some Xpert Carba-R
25

Assay target genes.
For the Reference Culture, the second swab specimen was inoculated into 11 mL
MacConkey enrichment broth containing a 10 µg meropenem disk and incubated
overnight at 35°C. An aliquot of MacConkey broth culture was spread onto a
MacConkey agar plate, and a 10 µg meropenem disk was placed on the plate. After
an overnight incubation at 35°C, the zone of clearing was measured. If growth was
observed within a 28 mm zone (including the meropenem disk), species identification
of the organisms was performed after subculture of colonies to sheep blood agar.
Organism susceptibility status (susceptible, intermediate or resistant) to meropenem,
ertapenem and imipenem was determined using CLSI standard test methods (M07-
A9) and the interpretive criteria found in the FDA drug label and CLSI M100-S24.
Carbapenem non-susceptible organisms were then subcultured to sheep blood agar
(with a meropenem disk placed between the 1st and 2nd streak) and incubated
overnight at 35°C. Three to five well-isolated colonies of the same morphotype, as
described in CLSI M07-A9, were collected and sent for sequencing.
DNA from the carbapenem non-susceptible isolates was purified, quantified, and
amplified using primers specific to all 5 target genes that were validated and amplify
a larger region than the Xpert Carba-R primers. The production of the appropriate
sized amplification products was confirmed on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. If no bands
were shown on the Bioanalyzer for any of the five target genes, the isolate was not
sent for sequence analysis and the Reference Method result was considered negative
for the five target genes. PCR and sequencing was not performed for specimens
where there was no growth in the 28 mm zone, if the results of antimicrobial
susceptibility testing identified a susceptible isolate, or if organisms had intrinsic
resistance to all the carbapenems tested (e.g. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia).
A total of 963 prospective specimens were initially enrolled in the clinical study, of
which 947 were eligible for inclusion. From the 947 eligible specimens, 924 were
included in the final dataset. The ineligible/excluded specimens are described below:
· (10) excluded strain type based on testing design [Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia (8) and Pseudomonas putida (1), Pseudomonas stutzeri (1)]
· (10) Ineligible, soiled
· (6) invalid GX control
· (4) shipping delay
· (2) Ineligible, duplicate
· (2) patients had colostomy
· (1) Ineligible, consent
· (1) insufficient number of swabs collected
· (1) GX indeterminate not retested
· (1) Ineligible, sample type
· (1) GX 2 timed indeterminate
Performance of the Xpert Carba-R Assay was assessed separately for each type of

resistance marker target and compared to the Reference Culture + Sequencing result.
With the perirectal swab specimens, 98.9% (914/924) of specimens yielded a result
on the first run. Four (4) INVALID, (5) ERROR, and (1) NO RESULT were observed
in the first run, but yielded a valid result upon repeat testing.
In addition to the prospective study, well-characterized isolates carrying each assay
target were tested in a contrived study. Strains were re-suspended in negative
perirectal matrix before testing with the Xpert Carba-R Assay at 1X, 3X, and 10X
LoD concentrations. The following numbers of unique isolates were evaluated in the
study spanning multiple gram negative species (Table 12 and Table 13):

aN refers to the total numbers of specimens where an organism was identified. This number includes
samples that were PCR positive and PCR negative for the presence of assay targets. Acinetobacter
baumannii (1) was recovered but did not contain target sequences by the Reference Method or by the
Xpert Carba-R Assay.
bIn (1) Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate, multiple targets were detected by the Reference Method—
NDM/OXA-48; Both targets were also detected by the Xpert Carba-R Assay.
External controls for the Xpert Carba-R Assay consisted of one negative sample, one
sample positive for all (5) targets of the assay, and five different positive controls
each containing a single target of the assay. The negative control and five-target
positive controls were run on each day that study samples were tested, along with two
of the single-target positive controls (on a rotating basis). Study samples were not run
until correct results were obtained for each of the four controls. External control data
was compiled across all sites and overall QC results were acceptable.
Prospective Study #2—Single Site Study (high prevalence site)
The use of rectal swab specimens was previously cleared (K160901). Since only a
few organisms with assay targets were recovered in the prospective study with
perirectal swab specimens, a second study was conducted to examine the detection of
assay targets from both rectal and perirectal swab specimens from the same patient.
This study design was considered feasible as similar LoDs for assay targets were
reported for organisms tested in rectal and perirectal swab matrix. To demonstrate
equivalence between the perirectal swab specimens and rectal swab specimens, fresh
prospectively collected rectal and perirectal swab specimens were enrolled from the
same patient at one site. Paired swab sets were used to collect specimens from each
patient. One paired swab set was used to collect the perirectal swab specimen, and a
second paired swab set was used to collect the rectal swab specimen. The perirectal
swab specimen was collected first followed by the rectal swab specimen. One swab
from each set was used for Xpert Carba-R testing. The second swab from each set
was saved for culture and susceptibility testing when either (or both) the perirectal or
rectal swab specimen was positive for one or more targets by the Xpert Carba-R

Assay. No culture was performed if perirectal and rectal swab specimens were both
negative by the Xpert Carba-R Assay. If high agreement between the two specimen
types was not observed, the study protocol allowed for additional testing of the
specimens with discordant results and true positive specimens to show equivalent
performance of the Xpert Carba-R Assay with both specimen types in the context of
the Reference Culture + Sequencing Method. Because the PPA and NPA
performance was determined acceptable, this conditional testing was not needed to
help evaluate device performance.
A total of 207 specimens were enrolled in the clinical study. Of the 207 eligible
specimens, 201 specimens were included in the final dataset. Six swab specimens (4-
perirectal and 2-rectal swab specimens) were excluded due to indeterminate results
from the Xpert Carba-R Assay. The performance (PPA and NPA) of the Xpert Carba-
R Assay using perirectal swab specimens was determined relative to the results of the
Xpert Carba-R Assay using rectal swab specimens from the same patient (Table 16).
Relative to the Xpert Carba-R Assay rectal swab specimen result, the perirectal swab
specimens demonstrated a PPA and NPA of 94.7% (95%CI: 75.4-99.1) and 97.8%
(95%CI: 94.5-99.1), respectively.
