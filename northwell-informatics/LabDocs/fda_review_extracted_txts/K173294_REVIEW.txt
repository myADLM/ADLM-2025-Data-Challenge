dehydrogenase. The rate of increase in absorbance at 340 nm, due to the formation of
NADPH, is directly proportional to the magnesium concentration.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated according to the CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. Precision testing
included 2 levels of control materials (Serum Control Level 1 and 2) and 4 human
serum pools (A, B, C, D). Each sample was tested in 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per
day for 20 days for a total of 80 replicates per sample. The results from the precision
study are summarized in the table that follows:
Mean Within Run Total
Sample n
(mg/dL) SD %CV SD %CV
Control 1 80 1.75 0.019 1.1 0.025 1.4
Control 2 80 4.15 0.030 0.7 0.040 1.0
Pool A 80 0.62 0.019 3.0 0.021 3.4
Pool B 80 1.90 0.019 1.0 0.023 1.2
Pool C 80 5.06 0.039 0.8 0.047 0.9
Pool D 80 9.27 0.051 0.5 0.076 0.8
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated according to CLSI EP06 guideline. The linearity of the
Magnesium assay was evaluated by preparing a series of 12 sample pools with
analyte concentrations of 0.30, 0.49, 0.68, 1.07, 1.83, 3.35, 4.88, 6.40, 7.93, 9.45,
10.98, and 12.50 mg/dL. Samples were tested in four replicates with two reagent lots
on the ARCHITECT c8000 System. The linear regression results of a representative
sample set are as follows:
y = 1.04 x - 0.14, r = 1.00
The linearity study supports the claimed measuring range of 0.60 - 9.50 mg/dL.
Manual dilution study:
Three serum pools were prepared using human serum and magnesium chloride at to
achieve magnesium concentrations of 8, 15, and 25 mg/dL. Each sample was
evaluated without dilution (neat) and after 1:2 and 1:5 manual dilution. Dilutions
were prepared using 0.8% and 0.90% (NaCl) saline. These diluted samples were
tested at a minimum of seven replicates using one lot of reagent. All the results
obtained are within ±7.5% of the expected value. The results of the dilution study
support the sponsor’s labeling claims that samples with magnesium values exceeding
9.5 mg/dL may be diluted 1:2 or 1:5 using the manual dilution procedure.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The assigned values for Chemistry Multiconstituent Calibrator are traceable to NIST
SRM 956 reference material. The calibrator was previously cleared in k103403.
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit studies were carried out in accordance with the CLSI EP17-A2
guideline.
The limit of blank (LoB) was determined by running a blank sample in 10 replicates
per run and 2 runs per day for 3 days using 2 reagent lots on one ARCHITECT c8000
System. The 95 percentile rank order was assigned as the LoB.
The limit of detection (LoD) was determined by running four low level samples
which were tested in 10 replicates per run and 2 runs per day for 3 days using 2
reagent lots on one ARCHITECT c8000 System. LoD was calculated based on the
following formula: LoB (mean) + 1.65 SD (low sample).
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was determined by running four low level samples
which were tested in 10 replicates per run and 2 runs per day for 3 days using 2
reagent lots on one ARCHITECT c8000 System. LoQ was defined as the lowest
concentration that can be detected with an estimated total error of ≤ 15% or 0.3
mg/dL.
The results are summarized in the table below:
mg/dL
LoB 0.03
LoD 0.05
LoQ 0.05
The detection limit studies study supports the claimed measuring range of 0.60 - 9.50
mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was performed based on CLSI EP07-A2 guideline. Interference
effects were assessed by dose response and paired difference methods. Bias is defined
as the difference in the results between the control sample (without interference) and
the test sample (contains interferent) expressed in percent. Difference exceeding 7.5%
is considered significant interference by the sponsor.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was conducted in accordance with the CLSI EP09-A3
guideline. A total of 122 patient serum samples (111 native and 11 spiked serum
samples) with magnesium concentrations of 0.65 to 9.00 mg/dL were evaluated with
the magnesium assay (candidate device) versus the Roche Magnesium Gen.2 assay
(predicate device). Testing was performed for 5 working days in three replicates
using the magnesium assay and one replicate using the predicate device. The results
were calculated using the first replicate of the candidate versus the single replicate of
the predicate.

The results of the regression analysis are summarized in the table below:
N Concentration Range Tested Slope Intercept R
122 0.65– 9.00 mg/dL 0.95 -0.02 0.9979
b. Matrix comparison:
Results from serum glass tubes (the control) were compared to those from serum tube
with gel-separator, sodium heparin plasma tube (without gel separator), lithium
heparin plasma tube (without gel separator) and lithium heparin plasma tube with gel
separator. A total of 40 matched sample pairs were analyzed spanning the
measurement range of 0.60 to 9.50 mg/dL. All samples were tested in a minimum of
2 replicates using 1 reagent lot on the ARCHITECT c8000 System.
The following linear regression equation was obtained between the matrices
generated by testing various tube types vs. control tube (serum).
