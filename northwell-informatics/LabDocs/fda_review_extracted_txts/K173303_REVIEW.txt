H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Refer to Indications for Use
2. Indication(s) for use:
The INSTANT-VIEW plus Multi-Drug of Abuse Urine Test - Simple Cup (OTC Use)
device is a rapid, qualitative immunoassay device for the detection of one or more drugs
or metabolites at the designated cutoff concentrations in human urine. The device can
detect up to 13 drugs or their metabolites:
Analyte Calibrator Cutoff (ng/mL)
Amphetamines d-Amphetamine 1000
Barbiturates Secobarbital 200
Buprenorphine Buprenorphine 10
Benzodiazepines Oxazepam 300
Cocaine Benzoylecgonine 300
Methamphetamine d-Methamphetamine 1000
Methadone Methadone 300
Phencyclidine Phencyclidine 25
Tricyclic
Nortriptyline 1000
Antidepressants
Cannabinoids 11-nor-Δ9-THC-9-COOH 50
Methylenedioxy-
MDMA 500
methamphetamine
Morphine Morphine 2000
Oxycodone Oxycodone 300
These assays may yield positive results when barbiturates, benzodiazepines, or tricyclic
antidepressants are ingested at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly
recognized cutoff levels for barbiturates, benzodiazepines, or tricyclic antidepressants in
urine. The assays are not intended to distinguish between prescription use or abuse of
these drugs.
This device provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate
chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result.
Chromatography/mass spectrometry is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test
result, particularly when preliminary positive results are obtained.

I. Device Description:
The INSTANT-VIEW plus Multi-Drug of Abuse Urine Test - Simple Cup (OTC Use) and
INSTANT-VIEW plus Multi-Drug Urine Test - Simple Cup (Prescription Use) are one-step
lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays. The devices are identical except for the
intended use (one for over the counter use and one for prescription use). Each device consists
of any combination of one to thirteen individual test strips(s) for the analytes(s) being tested.
Each test strip in the device consists of 1) a conjugate pad containing colloidal gold coupled
with the anti-drug antibodies and 2) nitrocellulose membrane containing a test line (T line)
coated with the conjugated drug antigen and a control line (C line). The C line serves as an
internal quality control of the system and appears as a burgundy colored band during the test
regardless of the presence of the drug. The results may be read between 2 and 120 minutes.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced
L. Test Principle:
Each device employs lateral flow immunochromatographic technology and is based on the
principle of competitive binding. Drugs, if present in concentrations below the cutoff level,
will not saturate the binding sites of the antibody coated particles on the drug specific test
strips. The goat-anti-rabbit IgG antibody-coated particles will then be captured by
immobilized drug-specific conjugate. If the level of drug in the urine specimen is below the
cutoff concentration, the T line appears as a visible burgundy line. If the level of drug in the
urine specimen is above the cutoff, no T line develops.
The control line (C line) serves as an internal quality control. The control line should always
appear as a burgundy-colored band regardless of the presence of the drug, if enough sample
volume has been added to the test and if the sample has correctly migrated up the test strip.
Testing is based on the principle of a competitive immunochemical reaction between a
chemically labeled drug (drug-protein conjugate) and the drug or drug metabolites which
may be present in the urine sample competing for the limited antibody binding sites.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The two devices are identical except for the intended use (one for over the counter use and
one for prescription use) so only one type of device was used to collect the performance data
below.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Each analyte for the precision study was tested at the following concentrations:
Negative, -75%, -50%, -25%, cutoff, +25%, +50%, +75%, and +100% of the cutoff
for each analyte. The panels were blinded and randomized prior to testing. Testing
was performed using three lots of test strips and was performed by 10 operators over
ten non-consecutive days, and the results of this testing are summarized as follows for
each analyte.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device has internal process controls. A control line appears in the control region
confirming that sufficient sample volume has been applied to the test strip and that
the sample has migrated correctly on the test strip. Users are informed that the test is
invalid if the colored line does not appear in the control region. There are no external
controls supplied with the device.
Device stability has been evaluated through accelerated and real-time studies.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The
manufacturer claims that the devices are stable for two years (24 months) when stored
at 15–30º C.

d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity for this device was previously reviewed in k152122.
f. Assay cut-off:
For characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed
cutoff concentration, please refer to section M.1.a., above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The accuracy performance of this device to a comparator method was previously
reviewed in k152122.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
In order to evaluate the modified read time and cup, a lay user study was performed.
A total of four-hundred (400) participants were recruited. Each participant was
provided one (1) package insert, one (1) blind labeled test solution, and one (1) test
device. Test solutions were randomly assigned to participants, one for each. Every
participant performed testing using the device and only instructions provided in the
device labeling. Following testing, users completed a study questionnaire to assess
usability and user comprehension, and the results from this questionnaire were found
to be acceptable. Participants aged 18 and over, with diverse educational
backgrounds, were recruited. Results from the lay user testing are provided in the
below table:
