L. Test Principle:
Glucose: This test is based on the enzymatic reaction that occurs between glucose oxidase,
peroxidase and chromogen. Glucose is first oxidized to produce gluconic acid and hydrogen
peroxide in the presence of glucose oxidase. The hydrogen peroxide reacts with potassium
iodide chromogen in the presence of peroxidase. The extent to which the chromogen is
oxidized determines the color which is produced, ranging from green to brown.
Protein: This test is based on the protein-error-of-indicators reaction. At a constant pH, the
presence of protein causes a change in the color of the indicator to a cyan color.
pH: This test is based on a double indicator system which gives a broad range of colors covering
the entire urinary pH range. Colors range from orange to yellow and green to blue.
Specific Gravity: This test is based on the apparent pKa change of certain pretreated
polyelectrolytes in relation to ionic concentration. In the presence of an indicator, colors
range from deep blue-green in urine of low ionic concentration to green and yellow-green in
urine of increasing ionic concentration.
Blood: This test is based on the peroxidase-like activity of hemoglobin which catalyzes the
reaction of cumene-hydroperoxide and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine. The resulting color
ranges from orange to green to dark blue.
Nitrites: This test is based on the Griess reaction. Nitrite reacts with sulfanilamide, followed
by a diazo-coupling reaction to form a pink colored product.
The strip is scanned and analyzed using the mobile device running the app. The results are
then sent directly to the prescriber.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The sponsor did not describe any degree of traceability for the device.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor validated the Limit of Detection by testing spiked or diluted urine
samples with analyte concentrations just below, at, and above each cutoff for each
color block. For pH and specific gravity, the sponsor determined the detection limits
for the first two color blocks (i.e., 5.0 to 5.5 and 5.5 to 6.0 for pH and 1.000 to 1.005
and 1.005 to 1.010 for specific gravity). Each sample was tested in 6 replicates/per
reagents test strip lot, using 3 lot of test strips (n=18), and one Nexus 5 phone. The
Limit of Detection for each color block was defined as the lowest concentration at
which at least 55% of the samples were positive. The results are summarized below:
limits of detection are presented in the tables below:

e. Analytical specificity:
Urine samples (negative, low positive, high positive) were spiked with potential
interferents at low and high concentrations as recommended by CLSI-EP7. The spiked
samples were compared to a control sample without the interferents, and interference
was defined as a change in output of more than 1 color block between spiked and un-
spiked (control) samples. When interference was detected, further testing was conducted
to identify the concentration at which interference was not observed. Each sample was
tested using 2 lots of urine dip stick, 2 replicates per lot, using Nexus 5 phone.
The interferents and the highest concentrations tested are listed in the table below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The first study enrolled 429 subjects from two U.S. clinical sites. The number of
spiked samples did not exceed 15% for each analyte for all bins combined. Subjects
including males and females, all ethnicities, ranging from 18-80 years of age
participated in the study. LG Nexus 5 phones were used to perform the study.
Samples were analyzed comparing the results obtained by subject using the DIP | U.S.
device and results of aliquots of the same samples measured by a laboratory
professional using the predicate (ACON Mission U500 Urine Analyzer). Each sample
was tested once using the candidate device, three times on the ACON 500 analyzer,
and the most common result was used in the comparison. The results are summarized
in the tables below.

Usability:
Usability was evaluated in the 429 subjects who conducted the test for the first time –
using native urine samples. 417 subjects (representing 97% of the total study
participants) completed the test on their first try with no usability issues. Seven other
subjects encountered challenges in using the device and performing the test within the
designated 2-minute time frame. These subjects followed the Application Instructions
and asked to re-do the test using a new kit. Each of these seven subjects successfully
completed the test on their second try (increasing the number of subjects who were
able to successfully complete the test to 424, representing a 99% usability success
rate). Five subjects, representing 1% of the total study participants, failed to perform

strips up and down for 15, 30, 60, 90 and 110 seconds, respectively, after dipping. The
sponsor used positive and negative controls in the testing. Results of the negative control
showed no carry-over. The results using the positive control indicated that after holding
the stick in the up position for 30 seconds the pH measurements started to decrease. The
instructions for use, both in the App and in the user manual, clearly describe the proper
handling of the strip to prevent carry-over. The user is instructed to place the stick
immediately on the Color-Board without delay.
3. To validate the recommended dipping time and to evaluate the impact of different dipping
times on the test results, the sponsor conducted a study using negative and positive
controls. None of the results were impacted by dipping times ranging from 1- to 5-
seconds. The user is instructed to dip the strip in the urine for 1 second.
4. The sponsor conductedan assay time study in order to validate the recommended
timeframe (from dipping to scanning the strip) and to evaluate the impact of different
timeframes on the test results. The sponsor performed this study using negative and
positive controls. Through the app-based flow, the user is instructed to scan the stick
after 60 seconds have elapsed since dipping the stick. The sponsor tested time intervals
at 60, 75, 90, and 110 seconds. None of the results were significantly impacted by the
different timeframes evaluated.
5. Lighting study: The lighting study was done in a light chamber, simulating the five most
popular types of light sources – GLS, Fluorescent, CFL, halogen and LED. The sponsor
tested the effect of lighting using both the color sticks (five different printed stick
configurations that covered 27 possible values on the reportable range) and urine samples
(negative and positive urine samples), and tested them under 10 different lighting
conditions that included: CFL6000K, CFL T2, CFL2700K, LED 2700K, LED 6000K,
LED 6500K, Incandescent, Halogen, Fluorescent 2700K, Fluorescent 6000K. None of
the results were impacted by the different lighting conditions evaluated.
6. Boundary study: The sponsor performed a study to demonstrate the environmental
boundaries that would prevent accurate dipstick scanning by a lay user. If the distance is
too far or too close, if the angle is too acute or obtuse, or the light is too dark, the DIP |
U.S. algorithm will not permit the smartphone to capture an image. This study was
performed using positive and negative urine samples and different printed sticks designed
18

to mimic test strips with different test results. At all boundary conditions evaluated, the
test results were not significantly impacted.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
