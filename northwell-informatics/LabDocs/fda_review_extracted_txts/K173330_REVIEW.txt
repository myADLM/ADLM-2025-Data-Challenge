83 - Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Micronics PanNAT STEC Test is a qualitative, in vitro nucleic acid amplification-
based test intended for the simultaneous detection and identification of the stx1 and stx2
Shiga toxin genes and the O-antigen gene cluster of E. coli O157 (fcl). Testing is
performed in a unitized cartridge on the PanNAT System on soft to diarrheal unpreserved
or Cary-Blair preserved stool specimens from individuals with signs and symptoms of
gastrointestinal infection. The PanNAT STEC Test is intended for use in conjunction
with clinical presentation, laboratory findings and epidemiological risk factors, as an aid
in detection of specific Shiga-toxin expressing strains of E. coli (“STEC”) from patients
with diarrhea.
The results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or
other patient management decisions. Positive PanNAT STEC Test results do not rule out
the potential for coinfection with other pathogens that are not detected by this device and
may not be indicative of the sole or definitive cause of patient illness. Negative PanNAT
STEC Test results in the context of clinical illness compatible with gastroenteritis may be
due to infection by pathogens that are not detected by this test or non-infectious causes
such as ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or Crohn’s disease.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
The PanNAT STEC Test may exhibit reduced sensitivity and/or failure detection failure
with stx1d, stx2b, stx2f and stx2g. These subtypes of Shiga toxin are infrequently isolated
from human specimens.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The PanNAT STEC Test is indicated for use with the PanNAT System.

I. Device Description:
The PanNAT STEC Test is a cartridge-based real-time PCR-based assay for the detection of
the Shiga toxin genes stx1 and stx2 and the Escherichia coli O157-specific gene cluster, fcl.
The assay is performed on the PanNAT System which comprises an instrument and software
for automated sample processing, nucleic acid amplification and detection and result
interpretation. The PanNAT STEC Test is for use on preserved (Cary-Blair Transport
Medium) or unpreserved soft or diarrheal stool specimens from subjects with signs and
symptoms of gastrointestinal infection.
The PanNAT STEC Test kit contains components to process and analyze up to 25 specimens
and includes PanNAT Sample Transfer Packs (comprised of a swab, Sample Buffer Tube and
Adaptor Cap) and PanNAT STEC Test Cartridges.
To perform the PanNAT STEC Test, a swab is used to transfer part of the stool specimen to a
Sample Buffer Tube which is then fitted with an Adaptor Cap and attached to the inlet port of
a PanNAT STEC Test Cartridge. The cartridge-tube assembly is then inserted into the
PanNAT System for automated processing.
The PanNAT STEC Test cartridge contains all the components necessary to perform the
assay and includes separate reaction mixtures for each target analyte (stx1, stx2 and O157)
that are dried in different wells. Each reaction mixture also contains primers and a detector
probe for an endogenous human gene that is extracted from the sample and co-amplified with
the target analyte (if present). There are three reaction mixtures per target analyte. The first
three reaction mixtures (one per target) are rehydrated with the processed sample and
analyzed to report the presence or absence of the target nucleic acids. The remaining wells
are used as Positive and Negative Controls and receive none of the processed sample but
instead are rehydrated with buffer. Each of the control wells must produce the expected
results for the results from the test wells to be reported.
Detection of the amplification reactions occurs in real-time using quenched fluorescent
probes and results are reported automatically.

L. Test Principle:
The PanNAT STEC Test is performed on soft or diarrheal stool specimens from patients
suspected of gastrointestinal infection. The specimens may be preserved in Cary-Blair
transport medium or unpreserved. To perform the test, a swab is used to transfer an aliquot of
the stool specimen to a Sample Buffer Tube which is sealed with an Adaptor Cap and

inserted into the sample port of the PanNAT STEC Test cartridge. The cartridge is then
loaded into the PanNAT System for automated processing.
Each test cartridge contains all the reagents necessary for nucleic acid extraction,
amplification and detection for one sample. Processing of the sample within the cartridge is
fully automated and fluid movement occurs via pneumatic pressure. Following bacterial lysis
using chaotropic salts and detergent, DNA is captured on silica membranes and the eluate is
used to rehydrate the amplification reagents.
Each cartridge contains nine amplification wells, three per target gene, that contain dried
PCR reagents. Each well includes a pair of primers and a detector probe for an endogenous
human gene that acts as a Process Control for nucleic acid recovery and amplification. One
chamber corresponding to each target analyte (stx1, stx2 and O157) is rehydrated with the
extracted sample. The remaining chambers are rehydrated with buffer and serve as controls.
The three Positive Control wells contain recombinant plasmid DNA bearing the target region
for each of the target analytes as well as the Process Control. The three Negative Control
wells contain no target or Process Control DNA. The expected results must be obtained with
each Positive and Negative Control well for patient results to be reported. In addition, to
report a negative result for a target analyte, the Process Control must be detected in the
corresponding well, otherwise the result is reported as “Invalid.” The results are interpreted
automatically by the instrument and may be viewed on-screen, printed or exported via USB
(Universal Serial Bus) flash drive. A summary of the algorithm for result interpretation is
provided in Table 1.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the PanNAT STEC Test between sites was evaluated in a study
that was performed by two operators at each of three sites using a total of 13 PanNAT
Systems. Over multiple days, each operator tested 15 replicates of a blinded 9-
member panel of unpreserved stool samples containing different levels of the
PanNAT STEC Test target analytes (3 sites X 2 operators X 9 panel members X 15
replicates = 810 PanNAT STEC Test results; 90 per panel member). The panel
members used in the study are summarized in Table 2. A different lot of reagents was
used at each of the testing sites. A summary of the qualitative test results obtained
with each panel member, stratified by site/reagent lot is shown in Table 3 and an
analysis of cycle numbers for each of the target analytes and the Process Control is
provided in Table 4.

There was a total of 33/810 (4.1%) Invalid results during the study. In addition, run
errors occurred with 4/810 (0.5%) samples. Therefore, a total of 773 valid PanNAT
STEC Test results was included in the analysis of device reproducibility (Tables 3
and 4).
For each panel member, agreement with expected results was assessed collectively
for all three analytes. For panel members #1-7 and #9, agreement with the expected
results for all three analytes was ≥97.7%. For panel member #8, the Low Positive
sample for the stx1+/stx2+/O157+ E. coli O157 strain EDL933, the agreement at Sites
A and B was 93.3% (28/30) and 96.4% (27/28), respectively, whereas at Site C it was
76.7% (23/30). The seven (7) discordant results at Site C were investigated. Of these,
two (2) were due to failure to detect stx1 (stx1 agreement 28/30, 93.3%), four (4)
were due to failure to detect stx2 (stx2 agreement 26/30, 86.6%) and one (1) was due
to failure to detect O157 (O157 agreement 29/30, 96.7%). In each case, the sample

was correctly reported positive for the other two analytes and the observed
discordance in the composite results (for stx1, stx2 and O157 combined) was
therefore not due to a systematic failure for any single analyte. Overall, the
reproducibility of the PanNAT STEC Test was determined to be acceptable.

The PanNAT STEC Test demonstrated acceptable reproducibility across sites,
PanNAT Systems, operators, panel members and reagent lots.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Specimen Stability
The stability of preserved and unpreserved stool specimens for use with the PanNAT
STEC Test was evaluated analytically by testing contrived samples that were seeded
with an enumerated suspension of E. coli O157 strain EDL933 (stx1+/stx2+/fcl+) at
levels close the LoD of the assay. The samples were stored at 2-8°C and tested at
predefined intervals. Five assay replicates were tested at each time point. The results
of the study support the claimed stability of preserved and unpreserved stool
specimens at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
The results of additional testing that was performed to establish the stability of frozen,
unpreserved stool specimens are described in Section M(2)(b).
Process Control
The PanNAT STEC Test Process Control is comprised of an endogenous human gene
that is co-extracted from the stool specimen and co-amplified along with the with the

target analytes (if present). The Process Control is designed to monitor for the
adequacy of sample addition to the test cartridge as well as reagent and process
integrity.
Integrated Positive/Negative Controls
Each PanNAT STEC Test cartridge includes integrated amplification wells for
Positive and Negative Controls. These wells contain the primers and probes for
detection of stx1, stx2 and O157 target genes as well as the Process Control. In
addition, the Positive Control wells contain plasmid DNA that carries the target
sequences for each of the PanNAT STEC Test analytes; whereas the Negative
Control wells contain no target DNA for any of the target analytes. Each of the
Positive and Negative Control wells must produce the expected result in order for
sample results to be reported. If one or more of the control wells fails the test sample
is reported as “Invalid.” Refer to Table 1, above, for additional information regarding
the interpretation of PanNAT STEC Test results.
External Positive/Negative Controls
External Controls should be tested according to guidelines or requirements of local,
provincial and/or federal regulations or accreditation organizations.
Commercially prepared External Positive and Negative Controls were tested
throughout the prospective Clinical Study described in Section M(3)(a). The Positive
External Control comprised a standardized suspension of E. coli ATCC 43895 strain
EDL933 (5 x 106 CFU/mL) and a human cell line (4.8-9.6 x 105cells/mL). The
negative External Control comprised diluent containing the human cell line alone. A
total of 170 pairs of External Controls were tested over the course of the study. On
initial testing, 6/170 (3.5%) Positive Controls and 12/170 (7.1%) Negative Controls
produced Invalid results. Of the remainder, 162/164 (98.7%) Positive Controls and
158/158 (100%) Negative Controls produced the expected results.
As an alternative to commercially prepared controls, a strain of E. coli that is known
to harbor the genes targeted by the PanNAT STEC Test (e.g., ATCC 43895 strain
EDL933) may be used as a Positive Control. Another strain of E. coli that does not
carry any of the target genes (e.g., E. coli K12) may used as a Negative Control.
Clinical specimens that are known to be positive or negative for the PanNAT STEC
Test analytes may also be used as Positive and Negative External Controls,
respectively.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection
The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the PanNAT STEC Test was initially estimated
using seven Shiga toxin positive/negative strains of O157 and non-O157 E. coli that
were diluted preserved and unpreserved stool matrix at three different concentrations.
The estimated LoD for each strain was the lowest concentration at which all of three
replicates produced positive results. For two strains, the LoD was then confirmed by
12

--- Page 13 ---
testing additional replicates at the estimated LoD concentration. The LoD was defined
as the concentration at which ≥95% of replicates produced a positive result for both
strains. The results of the study are summarized in Tables 5 and 6 for unpreserved
and preserved stool specimens, respectively. The confirmed LoD with unpreserved
stool specimens was 1 x 106 CFU/mL and with preserved specimens in Cary-Blair
medium it was 5 x 105 CFU/mL (equivalent to 1.75 x 106 CFU/mL of raw, undiluted
stool).

2 1/3 assay replicates was reported as Invalid
3 1/20 assay replicates was reported as Incomplete
4 1/20 replicates was reported as Invalid
5 In the initial confirmation study with preserved specimens, both strains yielded <95% proportion positive. The
confirmation study was therefore repeated at a higher target level (5 x 105 vs 2.9 x 105 CFU/mL).
Inclusivity (Analytical Reactivity)
The inclusivity of the PanNAT STEC Test was evaluated by testing 24 well-
characterized strains of E. coli including seven strains of serogroup 0157 and 17
strains of Shiga toxin producing non-O157 serogroups (six of which non-typeable).
An O-antigen deficient laboratory strain of E. coli (K12) was included as a Negative
Control. Each strain was tested in triplicate in unpreserved stool matrix at a
concentration equivalent to 3X LoD (3 x 106 CFU/mL). The results of the study are
summarized in Table 7. Three strains failed to produce the expected results due to
mismatches in the target regions for the PanNAT STEC Test stx1/2 primers and/or
probes. A Limitation was therefore added to the device labeling to indicate that false
negative results may occur due to the presence of sequence variations in the regions
of the stx1 and stx2 genes targeted by the PanNAT STEC Test.

2 3/3 replicates were reported positive for stx1 but negative for stx2. Sequence analysis showed that the stx2 variant carried
by this strain most closely resembled stx2b which is not detected by the PanNAT STEC Test.
3 Sequence analysis showed the presence of mismatches in the stx1 target region with the PanNAT STEC Test detector
probe. Both TW07740 and TW07754 were initially characterized as subtype stx1c but further analysis suggested that they
more closely resemble strains of subtype stx1d which is detected with reduced sensitivity by the PanNAT STEC Test.
Bioinformatic Analysis
The inclusivity of the PanNAT STEC Test primers and probes for the stx1, stx2 and
fcl gene targets was analyzed in silico using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
(BLAST). The targeted regions these genes were generally well conserved, although
the potential for false-negative PanNAT STEC Test results due to sequence variation
in the stx1 and stx2 genes and with certain subtypes is noted as a Limitation in the
device labeling.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity Study
The analytical specificity of the PanNAT STEC Test was evaluated by testing a panel
of 49 organisms and viruses that may be found in stool specimens (Table 8). Testing
was performed in triplicate by spiking unpreserved stool with each potentially cross-
reactive species at ≥106 CFU or organisms/mL for bacteria, yeast and parasites and
≥105TCID /mL for viruses. Negative PanNAT STEC Test results were obtained

with all replicates for all the organisms and viruses tested except for a strain of
Shigella dysenteriae that carries the stxA gene, a closely related homologue of E. coli

potential for the PanNAT STEC Test to give positive results for Shiga toxin genes
with strains of Shigella or other Enterobacteriaceae is noted as a Limitation in the
device labeling.

Contamination Study
The potential for false-positive results with the PanNAT STEC Test due to run-to-run
contamination was evaluated by testing an alternating series of E. coli O157
(stx1+/stx2+/O157+) “high positive” (107 CFU/mL) and negative unprocessed stool
samples in successive runs on three PanNAT Systems. One negative sample was
reported as Invalid and not retested. The expected results were obtained for all the
remaining “high positive” (15/15; 100%) and negative samples (14/14; 100%). These
results are acceptable.
f. Assay cut-off:
The methodology for threshold calculation was optimized through analysis of >1800
contrived specimens and validated in the Clinical Studies described in Section
M(3)(a). Individual thresholds for each cartridge well and optical channel are
determined based on an analysis of the changes in fluorescence during the early
cycles of PCR amplification. A cycle number is then assigned where the rate of
fluorescence accumulation exceeds the applicable threshold for the well and optical
channel, and the accumulation of fluorescence is determined to be consistent with
amplification. The decision algorithm described in Table 1 is then applied to
determine the result status of the sample.
g. Assay interference:
Interfering Substances
The potential for interference with the PanNAT STEC Test was evaluated with 25
endogenous and exogenous substances that may be found in stool specimens (Table
9). The study was performed using two strains of Shiga toxin producing E. coli O157
(EDL931 and EDL933; both stx1+/stx2+/fcl+) at 1X and 3X LoD (1 x 106 and 3 x 106
CFU/mL) in unpreserved stool samples, as well as with unpreserved stool samples
that were negative for each of the target analytes.
False negative results were obtained in the presence of three substances at the
concentrations tested: 5% (v/v) Imodium AD, 10% (w/v) Gaviscon and 48 mg/mL
stearic acid. In each case, only 1/3 replicates under the test condition produced a
negative result and in two cases (with Imodium AD and stearic acid), the failures
were at the 1X LoD target level. No false positive results were observed under any of
the test conditions.
A total of 9 Invalid results were observed during the study in association with 8 of the
potentially interfering substances that were tested. Although none of the samples with
Invalid results was retested, there was no evidence of systemic failures with any
individual substance.
Overall, the results of the Interfering Substances Study are considered acceptable.

Microbial Interference
The potential for interference with the PanNAT STEC Test by organisms that may be
present in stool specimens was investigated using the same list of species that was
evaluated for potential cross-reactivity (refer to Section M(1)(e) and Table 8).
Testing was performed with each potentially interfering species in triplicate using
unpreserved stool specimens in the presence of E. coli O157 strain EDL933 (ATCC
43895; stx1+/stx2+/O157+) at 1X LoD (106 CFU/mL). The potentially interfering
species were tested at 106 CFU or organisms/mL for bacteria, yeast and parasites and
105 PFU/mL for viruses. No interference was observed with any of the
microorganisms or viruses tested, although the potential for false-positive results with
species of Shigella that carry the stxA gene homolog of stx1 is noted in the device
labeling.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
To support use of frozen, retrospective unpreserved specimens to establish clinical
performance and in analytical testing, a study was conducted to compare the results
obtained from testing of “fresh” and frozen stool samples at different target levels.
Fresh (never frozen) unpreserved stool was spiked with E. coli O157 strain EDL933
(stx1+/stx2+/O157+) at different target levels, aliquoted and either tested on the day of
preparation or after different periods of storage at -80°C. The results of the study are
presented in Table 10 and showed that freezing of specimens for up to 68 weeks at -
80°C had no effect on PanNAT STEC Test results. These results are acceptable.

Prospective Clinical Study
The performance of the PanNAT STEC Test was evaluated in a prospective Clinical
Study that was conducted at six sites in the U.S. using leftover de-identified stool
specimens obtained from subjects who presented with symptoms of acute diarrhea.
The specimens were either unpreserved (“fresh”) or preserved in Cary-Blair transport
medium. Each specimen was divided into three aliquots of ≥250µL each: #1: for
analysis with the PanNAT STEC Test (stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days); #2: for
testing by the comparator culture method (stored at 2-8°C for up to three days or

longer at -70°C); #3: for analysis in the event of discordant results between the
PanNAT STEC Test and the reference method.
The reference culture method comprised separate procedures for growth and detection
of Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC) and E. coli O157. For detection of STEC,
50µL of unpreserved or 175µL of preserved stool was inoculated into 5mL
MacConkey enrichment broth which was incubated at 37±2°C for 16-24 hours before
testing with an immunoassay for the presence of Shiga Toxin 1 (ST1) and Shiga
Toxin 2 (ST2) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For detection of E. coli
O157, an aliquot of the specimen was streaked onto a Sorbitol MacConkey agar plate
that was incubated at 36±2°C for 18-24 hours. Clear or beige colonies that were
presumptively identified as E. coli O157 were sub-cultured, serotyped by latex
agglutination and, if positive for the O157 antigen, their identity was confirmed by
biochemical analysis.
A total of 1331 specimens from unique subjects were initially enrolled in the
prospective Clinical Study. Of these, 30 (29 preserved and one (1) unpreserved) were
excluded from the analysis of performance due inadvertent data loss (21) or protocol
deviation (9). Of the remaining 1301, 99 (7.6%) initially produced Invalid PanNAT
STEC Test results. Per protocol, all 99 specimens were retested and 78/99 (78.8%)
produced valid results for a final Invalid rate of 1.6% (21/1301). Of the 1280
specimens with valid PanNAT STEC Test results, 1184 (92.5%) were preserved in
Cary-Blair Transport Medium, while 96 (7.5%) were unpreserved stool specimens.
The results from testing of prospectively collected stool specimens with the PanNAT
STEC Test in comparison to the reference method are shown in Tables 11, 12 and 13.

Analysis of Retrospective Specimens
Due to the low prevalence of the target analytes in the prospective Clinical Study,
additional testing was performed with retrospective (frozen), unpreserved stool
specimens that were characterized using a well validated PCR/bidirectional
sequencing assay to confirm the presence/absence of the stx1, stx2 and/or O157
targets. One hundred and fourteen (114) retrospective specimens were initially
enrolled in the study of which eight (8) were excluded from the analysis of
performance due to the absence of a result for the comparator PCR/bidirectional
sequencing method (7) or because previous enrollment (1). On initial testing, 8/106
(7.5%) retrospective specimens produced Invalid results with the PanNAT STEC
Test. Per protocol, all were retested and 5/8 (62.5%) produced valid results upon
repeat, for a final invalid rate of 2.8% (3/106). Therefore, a total of 103 retrospective
specimens produced evaluable results with both the comparator method and the
PanNAT STEC Test. The results of the study are summarized in Tables 14 and 15.

To supplement the prospective Clinical Study and analysis of retrospective
specimens, additional testing was also performed with 16 contrived (spiked)
unpreserved stool specimens, each of which was spiked with an enumerated stock of
a different strain of Shiga-toxin producing E. coli or E. coli O157:H7 to a final
concentration of 5 x 106 CFU/mL of stool (5X LoD). The contrived specimens were
frozen and tested at the clinical sites, interspersed with retrospective specimens
(above). No Invalid results were obtained with the contrived specimens (Invalid rate
0/16 = 0%). The results of the study are summarized in Tables 16 and 17.

Study conducted at six (6) sites in the US (Section M(3)(a)). The overall prevalence of
stx1, stx2 and E. coli O157 in stool specimens was 0.9%, 1.2% and 0.5%, respectively as
determined by the PanNAT assay and 0.3%, 0.5% and 0.4% respectively as determined
by the reference culture method. In Table 18, the prevalence of each analyte as
determined by the PanNAT assay is stratified by the age of the subjects.
