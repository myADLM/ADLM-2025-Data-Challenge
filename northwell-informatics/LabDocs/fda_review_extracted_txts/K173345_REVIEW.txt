L. Test Principle:
β-hydroxybutyrate (β-ketone) measurement is based on electrochemical biosensor
technology using the enzyme β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. The electrical current
resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured and correlated to β-ketone concentration
by the meter. The magnitude of electrical current resulting from this enzymatic reaction
is proportional to the amount of β-hydroxybutyrate present in the sample. The result is
displayed for the user on the mobile device using the ProCheck Mobile application.

(formerly named Smart Dongle Blood Gucose Monitoring System) was previously
reviewed and cleared in k162382.
Performance characteristics for the β-ketone measurement function are described below
using the iPod touch 5 with iOS 8 as a representative mobile device.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability:
Precision was evaluated using venous blood samples adjusted to three different b-
ketone concentrations (0.5, 2.9, and 5.0 mmol/L) and tested on ten TD-4140 Smart
Dongle Blood Glucose plus β-Ketone Monitoring meters and three lots of test strips.
Ten replicates were tested per meter per glucose concentration for a total of 300
results per ketone level. The results from all strip lots are summarized below:
Ketone Level Lot N Mean SD CV
(mmol/L) (mmol/L) (mmol/L) (%)
0.5 1 100 0.530 0.048 9.11
2 100 0.510 0.057 11.13
3 100 0.520 0.063 10.59
2.9 1 100 2.880 0.092 3.19

5.0 1 100 5.030 0.157 3.12
2 100 5.010 0.160 3.18
3 100 5.050 0.158 3.13
Intermediate Precision:
Intermediate precision was evaluated using three lots of test strips and ten TD-4140
Smart Dongle Blood Glucose plusβ-Ketone Monitoring meters. Two levels of ketone
control solutions were used (0.3-0.9 mmol/L and 2.0-4.0 mmol/L). For each level of
control, ten replicates were taken each day for ten days, so that 300 individual
measurements were generated per control level. The results from all strip lots are
summarized below:
Ketone Level Lot N Mean SD CV
(mmol/L) (mmol/L) (mmol/L) (%)
0.3-0.9 1 100 0.580 0.042 7.27

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity for ketones was evaluated using three lots of test strips and five TD-4140
Smart Dongle Blood Glucose plus β-Ketone Monitoring meters. Six (6) venous
samples were supplemented with β-ketone concentrations to the following β-ketone
concentrations: <0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 mmol/L. Linear regression analysis
for each lot compared to results obtained using β-Hydroxybutyrate LiquiColor using
Helios Zeta UV-Visible spectrophotometer resulted in the following:
Lot no. Linear regression Range
1 y = 0.9971x +0.0027; R2 = 0.9986 0.06-8.67 mmol/L
2 y = 1.0027x – 0.332; R2 = 0.998 0.06-8.67 mmol/L
3 y = 1.0034x + 0.104; R2 = 0.998 0.06-8.67 mmol/L
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed range of β-ketone of 0.1 - 8.0
mmol/L. The meter displays “Lo” when sample are below (<0.1 mmol/L) and “Hi”
when samples are greater than (0.8mmol/L). Testing was performed demonstrating
that these features function as intended.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The TD-4140 Smart Dongle Blood Glucose plus β-ketone Monitoring System and are
traceable to an in-house standard prepared from commercially available control
materials. β-Hydroxybutyrate LiquiColor assay on the Helios Zeta UV-Visible
spectro-photometer was used as the comparator method in the lay-user accuracy
study.
Ketone test strip stability
Stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable
to support a shelf life of 20 months and an open-vial use life of three months when
stored at a temperature ranging from 35.6 °F-86°F (2°C to 30°C) and between 10%-
85% relative humidity.
d. Detection limit:
Ketone measuring range is 0.1-8.0 mmol/L, these ranges are validated via the
linearity study. See section M.1.b.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed to evaluate exogenous and endogenous substances
using venous blood spiked to two β-Ketone levels of 1.0 and 3.0 mmol/L. The
samples were divided into 2 aliquots: control (with no added interferent) and test
samples (with added potential interferent). Each sample was measured by the β-
Hydroxybutyrate LiquiColor assay and four TD-4140 Smart Dongle Blood Glucose
plus β-Ketone Monitoring system. The sponsor defines no significant interference as
bias < ± 10% for the test compared to control samples. The following table lists the
concentrations of each substance at which no significant interference was detected:

Lay user Study:
To assess the ketone performance of the TD-4140 Smart Dongle Blood Glucose plus
b-ketone Monitoring System in the hands of the intended users the sponsor performed
a study with 120 lay user participants. Participants obtained and tested their own
fingerstick samples with the TD-4140 Smart Dongle Blood Glucose plus b-ketone
Monitoring System. b-Ketone results from the meter obtained by the lay user were
compared to the b-Hydroxybutyrate LiquiColor assay using Helios Zeta UV-Visible
spectrophotometer. The samples ranged from 0.1 to 6.7 mmol/L. Results of the
meter measurements relative to the comparator method are summarized below:

3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger. The whole
blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action therefore there are no
special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
Coding by the user is necessary for b-Ketone. A code strip is provided and the user is
instructed to calibrate every time a new vial of ketone test strips is begun by comparing
the code number on the ProCheck mobile app.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor provides 2 levels of b-Ketone Control Solutions, all sold separately. The
outer kit box labels state that controls are necessary but not included and must be
purchased separately.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Sample volume study:
A sample volume study was performed using venous whole blood samples. Three
samples were spiked to β-Ketone levels of 0.5, 2.0, and 4.0 mmol/L, as measured by the
β-Hydroxybutyrate LiquiColor method, to evaluate the effect of different sample volumes
(0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 mmol/L on the β-Ketone performance of the device. Three
lots of test strips and 5 meters were used. Results from these studies support the claimed
minimum sample volume 1.0 µL for β-Ketone. The meter displays an error message
(Err.45.), 2.9, 4.8 and 7.3 mmol/L, as measured by the b-Hydroxybutyrate LiquiColor
method. The samples were tested with 6 meters and the results were compared to the b-
Hydroxybutyrate LiquiColor method and the normal 40% hematocrit. The % biases
relative to the b-Hydroxybutyrate LiquiColor method were acceptable within the claimed
hematocrit range and support the claimed hematocrit range of 20 to 70%.
2. Test System Operating Conditions:
Operating temperature and humidity conditions were evaluated using a single lot of
ketone test strips and four meters with venous whole blood samples three b-Ketone levels
(0.5, 2.0, and 4.0 mmol/L) using the b-Hydroxybutyrate LiquiColor® as reference
method. The following temperature and humidity conditions were tested: 50°F
(10°C)/10% RH, 50°F (10°C)/85% RH, 104°F (40°C)/10%RH, and 104°F (40°C)/85%
11

--- Page 12 ---
RH. The results support the sponsor’s claimed operating temperature from 50°F to 104°F
(10°C - 40°C) and relative humidity range from 10-85%.
3. EMC Testing:
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing
(EMC) had been performed and the device system was found compliant.
4. Infection Control Studies:
The TD-4140 Smart Dongle Blood Glucose plus β-ketone Monitoring System meter is
intended for single-patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the
materials comprising the meters by an outside commercial laboratory (in the predicate
k162382) demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with Micro-
Kill Wipes (EPA Reg. No. 59894-10-37549). Robustness studies were performed by the
sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or in external materials
of the meters after 10,950 cleaning and disinfection cycles with Micro-Kill Wipes. The
robustness studies were designed to simulate 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was
reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable.
R. Conclusion:
