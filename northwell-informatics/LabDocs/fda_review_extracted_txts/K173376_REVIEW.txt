L. Test Principle:
The ASI Evolution system automates sample processing and measurement of RPR agglutination
tests for syphilis. The instrument automatically dispenses serum or plasma samples and ASI
Evolution carbon antigen reagent into micro-well plates. Reactions occur in plastic 48-well
plates.
The Analyzer automates the following stages of the RPR test:
• Fluid Handling: aspirating and dispensing fluid volumes between 2μL and 500μL
• Mixing: the plate carriers mix in a circular motion at two speeds (~400 rpm and ~100
rpm)
• Timing: the instrument will process the tests in a prescribed time allotment, with each
step timed appropriately
• Image Capture: the instrument’s camera will record images of each completed test
• Image processing: the software processes and stores data of the test result image

• Reporting: the software reports and records the numerical and qualitative results of each
test
The user must perform the following tasks:
• Loading sample tubes into the sample rack
• Loading the sample rack into the unit
• Refilling the prime bottle with D.I. Water
• Placing the reagent and diluent in their respective positions in the permanent rack
• Loading and unloading 48-well plates
The result is analyzed through an image processing algorithm from images taken with an internal
CCD camera. The camera first takes high quality images of each well in the microplates using
light reflectance. The image is then analyzed by software that has been developed with an optical
recognition feature that identifies each well boundary and ensures it is in the correct position,
then followed by a software algorithm that interprets the agglutination pattern to determine the
sample result. All images are stored on the hard drive and results are labeled reactive or non-
reactive.
Barcode labeled patient samples can be imported with the use of a hand-held barcode scanner.
The Analyzer is designed to process up to 192 samples (4 plates). A printout or file export is
provided after the results are determined. The reactive samples can be batched for determination
of titers using another protocol contained in the instrument software.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All analytical study data was captured as either reactive or non-reactive results. No RPR
titers were performed during the studies. Any data that is listed as expected result, for
titered samples, refers to simply a reactive result, not a titer.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision
Precision testing of the ASI RPR Test for syphilis run on the ASI Evolution instrument
was performed. A human serum panel consisting of 10 frozen samples spanning the
measuring range of the test was assayed on one reagent lot. One hundred ninety-two
aliquots of each same sample were placed in each well of four (4) 48-well plates (total of
40 plates). The four plates for each sample were run on the instrument at the same time.
The analyte titers of the samples used are described in table 3 below.

Reproducibility
Reproducibility testing was performed at each of three (3) US testing facilities using 3
lots of the ASI RPR Test for syphilis run on the ASI Evolution instrument. All 3 lots
were run at each site by each operator. A serum panel consisting of 7 samples spanning
the measuring range were assayed in 2 replicates per run, 6 runs per day over 5 days (2
reps x 6 runs x 5 days x 3 sites = 180 total data points per sample).

should be stored at 2-8°C.
· Plasma samples stored longer than five (5) days at 2-8° C should not be used
in the assay because of the potential for false reactive results.
Kit Stability:
The following are the stability claims for the ASI Automated RPR Test for Syphilis:
· Kit Stability was previously determined in the original submission for the
reagents (K851504)
· Additionaly studies demonstrated stability of the reagents on board the ASI
Evolution instrument for 8 hours.
Testing was conducted using four different samples:
· RPR nonreactive sample
· RPR reactive 1:2 tittered sample (low reactive)
· RPR reactive 1:16 tittered sample (moderate reactive)
· RPR reactive 1:64 tittered sample (high reactive)
Each sample was aliquoted to allow for two operators to run each sample in triplicate at
each time point.

For this study, reagent was placed on the instrument at the beginning of the day, from
storage at 2-8°C, and the sample panel was tested. The reagents were then left on the
instrument for 8 hours and the sample panel was then tested using the reagents stored
on the instrument. This process was repeated over 5 days, using the same reagent
bottles. At the end of each day the reagents were placed at 2-8°C. The testing results are
presented in table 8 below.

Fresh vs. Frozen Study:
Testing was performed to evaluate the performance of frozen samples, compared to
fresh sample. Twenty non reactive samples and 40 reactive samples were chosen and
each sample was split into two aliquots. One aliquot was stored at 2-8°C and the other
was frozen for 1 month. Fresh samples were tested within 5 days of storage and frozen
samples were tested after one month. All samples were allowed to reach room
temperature before testing. Results of the testing of fresh and frozen samples are shown
below.

Carryover:
This study was designed to test for potential carryover of sample when using the ASI
Evolution. Two samples were used, a highly reactive RPR (1:64) sample and
nonreactive sample. Twenty four (24) aliquots of each sample were prepared, with
enough volume to be tested 5 times. Testing was performed in one plate, alternating 24
aliquots of the highly reactive sample with 24 aliquots of the nonreactive sample. One
plate was run each day for five days, using one lot of reagents. No carryover was
observed during testing. Test results are shown below.

ASI Evolution, software version 1.0
O. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description
The ASI Evolution is an integrated digital particle analyzer designed to objectively
interpret certain slide agglutination tests manufactured by Arlington Scientific, Inc.
(ASI). The ASI Evolution fully automates the sample and reagent handling steps of the
test procedure. Qualitative and semi-quantitative tests are performed by laboratory
professionals who use the ASI Evolution to provide standardized test interpretation using
criteria that define reactive and nonreactive agglutination reactions.
The ASI Evolution employs a camera to create a highly sensitive and high-resolution

image of the agglutination immunoassay. This image is then analyzed by the proprietary
software algorithm to interpret the agglutination pattern.
2. Principle of Operation
The ASI RPR Test is a macroscopic nontreponemal flocculation test to be used for the
detection of reagin. The microparticulate carbon RPR antigen enhances the visual
discrimination between reactive and nonreactive results. The reagin-type antibody binds
with the antigen that is composed of a complex of cardiolipin, lecithin and cholesterol
particles with activated charcoal. The result of this antigen-antibody reaction is
macroscopic flocculation. This test kit is intended to be used in conjunction with the ASI
Evolution Automated Syphilis Analyzer.
3. Modes of Operation
The assay is fully automated.
4. Calibration
The firm included in their latest software build the ability to calibrate exposures per well
using a grey intensity target (on empty wells). Users can verify that the grey intensity
(shade) stays within the allowed range when the picture is taken.
