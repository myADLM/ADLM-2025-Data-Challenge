Throat swab specimen are collected using the Copan Liquid Amies Elution Swab (ESwab)
collection medium. The sample is mixed by shaking and 300ul of is added to the Xpert
Xpress Strep A cartridge using a disposable transfer pipette. Once the cartridge is loaded into
a GeneXpert Xpress module and the test is initiated by the operator, all the steps associated
with sample processing, PCR amplification/detection and result interpretation occur
automatically.
The Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert Xpress System that
automates sample preparation, DNA amplification and real-time detection in single-use,
disposable cartridges.
The Xpert Xpress Strep A test cartridge contains a pair of PCR primers and a hydrolysis
probe that enable detection of a conserved DNA sequence within the S. pyogenes genome.
The assay also incorporates a Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control
(PCC) to monitor the integrity of the reagents and process workflow.
The GeneXpert Xpress System, which uses the GeneXpert Xpress II and IV instruments,
performs separate sample preparation and real-time PCR and RT-PCR tests. Each module
contains a syringe pump drive for dispensing fluids, an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells, a
valve drive that rotates the cartridge valve body to address the different cartridge chambers
for sample movement, and a thermocycler unit for performing real-time PCR and RT-PCR
and detection.
The Xpert Xpress Strep A results are interpreted by the GeneXpert Xpress software from
measured fluorescent signals and are shown in the “Test Result” screen. The final result
report can be viewed on-screen and/or printed.
The single-use, multi-chambered fluidic cartridges are designed to complete sample

the Copan Liquid Amies Elution Swab (ESwab) Collection and Transport System. Upon
receipt in the testing laboratory, the ESwab tube is mixed by shaking and 300µL of the
transport medium is added to an Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay cartridge using a disposable
transfer pipette. The operator then initiates the test from the operator interface and loads the
cartridge into the GeneXpert instrument, after which all process steps are performed
automatically.
Once complete, the final result report can be viewed on-screen and/or printed. Results are
reported as Strep A DETECTED, Strep A NOT DETECTED, , INSTRUMENT ERROR or NO
RESULT-REPEAT TEST (If the result is NO RESULT-REPEAT TEST, then retest with a
new cartridge. If the retest is NO RESULT-REPEAT TEST, call Cepheid Technical
Support).). Instructions for retesting are provided for samples with indeterminate results.
The Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay has an Early Termination Feature whereby results for
samples that are strongly positive for S. pyogenes are reported prior to completion of the full
number of PCR cycles designated in the assay definition file.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Analytical studies for the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay were described in submission
K172126 that was cleared on September 25, 2017. All testing was performed using the
same assay in this submission. No changes have been made to the design of the Xpert
Xpress Strep A Assay since the 510(k) clearance of K172126. For this submission the
data from all analytical studies (except Reproducibility study) is identical to those
conducted in support of K172126 clearance. All analytical data was generated with
GeneXpert Dx software using the GeneXpert Dx (GX-IV and GX-XVI) instrument and
reanalyzed with GeneXpert Xpress software 5.0 The data re-analyzed with GeneXpert
Xpress software 5.0 provided identical results to those original analysis with GeneXpert
Dx software 4.7b.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A multi-center study was conducted at three sites with three operators at each site.
Each operator tested four-member panel comprised of positive samples with varying
concentrations of Streptoccoccus pyogenes ATCC BAA-946 at three target
concentrations levels and a negative sample (No Streptococcus pyogenes) in a liquid
Amies media containing simulated throat swab matrix (Table 2). Each operator tested
blinded panel twice per day over 5 testing days ( 3 operators x 2 times/day x 5 days x
3 sites=90 results). Three lots of Xpress Strep A Assay reagent were used in this
study but only two lots of reagents were used at each testing site. All sites used the
GeneXpert Xpress IV instrument. Samples were stored at 2-8°C until testing The data
was generated with Xpress software 4.7c and re-analyzed with GeneXpert Dx 5.0
software. The Reproducibility data re-analysis, with GeneXpert Dx 5.0 software
provided results identical to the original analysis, with GeneXpert Xpress software
4.7c. A summary of the reproducibility panel members is outlined in Table2.

The performance of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay was conducted at a total of nine
(9) clinical sites in the U.S. that were selected to be representative of the CLIA
Waived testing environment (including emergency departments, urgent care centers,
physician’s offices and a walk-in clinic). The GeneXpert Operators who performed
the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay at each site were non-laboratory healthcare
personnel, with no experience with either the Cepheid CW or moderately complex
assays.
Throat swab specimen were prospectively collected in Liquid Amies medium
(ESwab) from consented subjects presenting signs and symptoms of pharyngitis
following collection of standard of care (SOC) swab specimens. Specimen were
stored at 2-8°C until all testing was completed. The performance of the Xpert Xpress
Strep A Assay was determined relative to the reference culture. Xpert Xpress Strep A
Assay testing and the reference culture method were performed within 48 hours of
specimen collection. Isolated colonies that exhibited b-hemolysis were typed by latex
agglutination (Remel Streptex). Culture plates that did not exhibit b-hemolytic
colonies after 48 hours were recorded as negative for Group A Streptococcus. The
study was performed with the GeneXpert Xpress system (GeneXpert II and IV
instrument). The data was generated with GeneXpert Xpress software 4.7c and
reanalyzed with GeneXpert Xpress software 5.0.
A total of 666 specimens were collected from individual subjects initially enrolled in
this clinical study. Of the 666 specimen, 43 specimen were excluded because of: lack
of consent documents (10), previously enrolled subject (1), delay in shipment for
reference culture testing (27), indeterminate culture results (4), and incorrect
specimen type (1).Of the 623 eligible specimens, 4.7% (29/623) produced “NO
RESULT-REPEAT TEST” and 0.6% (4/623) produced an “INSTRUMENT
ERROR” with the Xpert Xpress Strep A test. Twenty eight out of twenty nine
samples with NO RESULT-REPEAT test were retested and twenty five samples
yielded valid results. Three out of four samples with INSTRUMENT ERROR were
retested and three samples have yielded valid results. A total of 618 specimens were
therefore included in the final evaluable data for analysis of performance. Specimens
were prospectively collected. The results were compared to culture and latex
agglutination for Strep A typing (Table 5).

Barcode scan or manual entry.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Throat swab samples are collected using the Copan Liquid Amies Elution Swab (ESwab)
and transported to the testing laboratory. The test operator briefly shakes the ESwab tube
containing the swab to elute the sample and adds 300µL of the transport medium to an
Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay cartridge using a transfer pipette. The operator then loads the
cartridge into the GeneXpert System and initiates the run from the operator interface.
6. Calibration:
No calibration by the operator is required.
7. Quality Control:
Refer to K172126 for information on internal and external controls.
