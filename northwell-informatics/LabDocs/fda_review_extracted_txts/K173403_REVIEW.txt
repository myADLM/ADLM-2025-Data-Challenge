H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The GEM Premier 5000 is a portable critical care system for use by health care
professionals to rapidly analyze heparinized whole blood samples at the point of health
care delivery in a clinical setting and in a central laboratory. The instrument provides
quantitative measurements of pH, pCO , pO , sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized
2 2
calcium, glucose, lactate, hematocrit, total bilirubin and CO-Oximetry (tHb, O Hb,
2
COHb, MetHb, HHb, sO *) parameters from arterial, venous or capillary heparinized
2
whole blood. These parameters, along with derived parameters, aid in the diagnosis of a
patient’s acid/base status, electrolyte and metabolite balance and oxygen delivery
capacity.
*sO = ratio between the concentration of oxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin plus
2
deoxyhemoglobin.
· pH, pCO , and pO measurements in whole blood are used in the diagnosis and
2 2
treatment of life-threatening acid-base disturbances.
· Electrolytes in the human body have multiple roles. Nearly all metabolic processes
depend on or vary with electrolytes:
· Sodium (Na+) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
aldosteronism, diabetes insipidus, adrenal hypertension, Addison’s disease,
dehydration, inappropriate antidiuretic secretion, or other diseases involving
electrolyte imbalance.
· Potassium (K+) measurements are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the diagnosis
and treatment of disease conditions characterized by low or high blood potassium
levels.
· Ionized calcium (Ca++) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
parathyroid disease, a variety of bone diseases, chronic renal disease and tetany.
· Chloride (Cl-) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of electrolyte
and metabolic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis and diabetic acidosis.
· Hematocrit (Hct) measurements in whole blood of the packed red cell volume of a

blood sample are used to distinguish normal from abnormal states, such as anemia
and erythrocytosis (an increase in the number of red cells).
· Glucose (Glu) measurement is used in the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of
carbohydrate metabolism disturbances including diabetes mellitus, neonatal
hypoglycemia, idiopathic hypoglycemia, and pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.
· Lactate (Lac) measurement is used:
o to evaluate the acid-base status of patients suspected of having lactic acidosis;
o to monitor tissue hypoxia and strenuous physical exertion;
o in the diagnosis of hyperlactatemia.
· Total Bilirubin (tBili) measurement is used to aid in assessing the risk of kernicterus
and hyperbilirubinemia in neonates.
· CO-Oximetry (tHb, COHb, MetHb, O Hb, HHb, and sO ) evaluates the ability of the
2 2
blood to carry oxygen by measuring total hemoglobin and determining the percentage
of functional and dysfunctional hemoglobin species.
· Total Hemoglobin (tHb): Total hemoglobin measurements are used to measure the
hemoglobin content of whole blood for the detection of anemia.
· COHb: Carboxyhemoglobin measurements are used to determine the
carboxyhemoglobin content of human blood as an aid in the diagnosis of carbon
monoxide poisoning.
· MetHb: Methemoglobin measurements are used to determine different conditions of
methemoglobinemia.
· HHb: Deoxyhemoglobin, as a fraction of total hemoglobin, is used in combination
with oxyhemoglobin to measure oxygen status.
· O Hb: Oxyhemoglobin, as a fraction of total hemoglobin, is used in combination with
2
deoxyhemoglobin to measure oxygen status.
· sO : Oxygen saturation, more specifically the ratio between the concentration of
2
oxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin plus deoxyhemoglobin, is used to measure
oxygen status.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only at point-of-care and central laboratory settings
4. Special instrument requirements:
GEM Premier 5000 analyzer
I. Device Description:
The GEM Premier 5000 system contains 2 key components: the GEM Premier 5000 analyzer
and the GEM Premier 5000 PAK (cartridge). The GEM Premier 5000 PAK contains
reagents, sensors, optical cell for Co-Ox and total bilirubin, sampler and waste bag. It enables
analysis of 75 to 600 samples per cartridge. There are 5 process control solutions (A, B, C, D
and E), 1 reference electrode solution and 1 lysing solution in each GEM Premier 5000 PAK.
The 5 process control solutions are utilized each day at different frequencies to confirm
sensor, CO-Ox and PAK performance.

L. Test Principle:
The electrolyte sensors (K+, and Cl‐) are polyvinyl chloride (PVC) based ion selective
electrodes consisting of an internal Ag/AgCl reference electrode and an internal electrolyte
layer. Their potentials are measured against the card reference electrode (Ag/Ag+). The
electrolyte sensors are based on the principle of ion selective electrodes; in which electrical
potential can be established across a membrane resulting from chemical selectivity of the
membrane to a specific ion. The electrical potential is proportional to the logarithm of the
analyte activity in the sample, and the concentration of the desired ions is calculated using
Nernst equation.
pCO2 is measured by potentiometry using a sensor on the GEM Premier 5000 PAK. The
result may be corrected for actual patient temperature if different than 37°C.
Hematocrit is measured by an electrical conductivity technique. The conductivity technique
is based on the principle that because plasma is more conductive than blood cells due to the
high resistance of the cell membranes, the resistivity of blood will increase as the
concentration of cells increases. This relationship is expressed by the Maxwell‐Fricke
equation: r = Rp x (1 + Hct/100)/(1‐Hct/100), where “r” is the blood resistivity, Rp is a
constant based on the plasma resistivity, and Hct is hematocrit. The electrode chamber
contains a miniature conductivity cell. By applying an alternating potential through the cell,
the resistance of the fluid in the cell can be determined by means of Ohm’s Law.
Total hemoglobin measurement is based on an optical absorbance measurement of the
sample. An in‐line optical cell is integrated in the flow path of the hemolyzed sample to
provide a measure of hemoglobin and its derivatives. The optical cell is a flow through
channel with two parallel plate optical windows separated by a well‐defined path length. The
chemical lysing of the sample is implemented to minimize the scattering effect of the blood
and to make the spectral measurement more reliable. The optical measurement hardware,
consisting of a white light‐emitting diode (LED) light source, a neon reference and a high
resolution spectrometer with a holographic diffraction grating and a charge‐coupled device

(CCD) array, are all contained in the analyzer. Only the optical cell is located in the
disposable cartridge (GEM PAK) and is aligned with the analyzer optics for spectral

A method comparison study for capillary whole blood was performed at an external
POC site with 6 POC operators and an internal laboratory with 3 POC operators. Two
capillary samples were collected via finger-stick from each patient/donor. One sample
