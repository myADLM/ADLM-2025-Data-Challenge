H. Intended Use:
1. Indications for Use
The MolecularMD MRDx BCR-ABL Test is an in vitro diagnostic test for the
quantitative detection of BCR-ABL1 transcripts (e13a2/b2a2 and/or e14a2/b3a2)
and the ABL1 endogenous control mRNA in peripheral blood specimens from
patients previously diagnosed with t(9:22) positive chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML). The ratio of BCR-ABL1 to ABL1 is calculated and reported on the WHO
International Scale. The test utilizes quantitative, real-time reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction performed on the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx
instrument.
The MolecularMD MRDx BCR-ABL Test is intended to measure BCR-ABL
mRNA transcript levels in patients diagnosed with t(9;22) positive CML during
monitoring of treatment with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs).
The device is also intended to be used in the serial monitoring for BCR-ABL
mRNA transcript levels as an aid in identifying CML patients in the chronic phase
being treated with nilotinib who may be candidates for treatment discontinuation
and for monitoring of treatment-free remission.
The test does not differentiate between e13a2 or e14a2 fusion transcripts and does
not monitor other rare fusion transcripts resulting from t(9;22). The test is not
intended for the diagnosis of CML.

L. Test Principle:
The MolecularMD MRDx® BCR-ABL Test is a quantitative, real-time polymerase
chain reaction test that provides quantitation of BCR-ABL1 (hereafter BCR-ABL)
transcript e13a2/b2a2 or e14a2/b3a2 and ABL1 (hereafter ABL) transcript levels in
RNA extracted from peripheral blood samples collected from CML patients.
Peripheral blood is collected in either EDTA or PAXgene tubes. Each collection tube
type requires a specified RNA extraction method and RNA input amount. The
detailed extraction protocol and RNA quantity requirements are provided in the
device package insert and instructions for use. Total RNA is extracted from
peripheral blood and serves as the template for RT-qPCR. The test is performed using
a one-step RT-qPCR protocol wherein the reverse transcription and quantitative, real-
time PCR reactions are performed in the same well. BCR-ABL and ABL amplicons
are generated and detected in real-time using TaqMan® MGB probes. For RNA
extracted from EDTA tubes, a total of 4 µg of RNA is required for each patient
sample:1 µg of extracted RNA is used in the MRDx test in each of 4 wells, 2 wells
for BCR-ABL and 2 wells for ABL. For RNA extracted from PAXgene tubes, total of
8 µg of RNA is required for each patient sample: 2 µg of extracted RNA is used in
the MRDx test in each of 4 wells, two2 wells for BCR-ABL quantitation and 2 wells
for ABL quantitation.
The MolecularMD MRDx BCR-ABL Test is performed on the Applied Biosystems
7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument. The instrument integrates a thermal cycler,
a fluorometer and application specific software. The instrument houses the thermal
cycler and the fluorometer, while the application software is installed on a computer
that is attached to the instrument. The ABI 7500 Fast Dx instrument software v1.4.1
6

--- Page 7 ---
calculates the BCR-ABL and ABL copy numbers using a standard curve generated
with calibrators on each individual plate.
Quantitation is achieved using RNA calibration standards and linear regression
analysis provided by the ABI 7500 Fast Dx PCR Instrument Software. BCR-ABL
transcript levels are measured in relation to the ABL transcript as an endogenous
reference. The data are exported as a CSV file for further analysis in the MRDx BCR-
ABL Test Software. The BCR-ABL/ABL ratio is calculated and converted to the
International Scale by the MRDx® BCR-ABL Test Software.
The BCR-ABL/ABL % IS for patient sample results is calculated using the
conversion factor for the MRDx BCR-ABL Test in addition to validating each MRDx
BCR-ABL Test result against the run acceptance criteria and sample acceptance
criteria.
Calibrators are analyzed for both BCR-ABL and ABL in every run simultaneously
with patient samples. RNA controls provided at MMR (MR3.0) and MR4.5 allow for
on-plate verification of test accuracy and reproducibility over this critical transcript
range. The integrated conversion factor provides test results on the International Scale
(IS) harmonized to the WHO.
Interpretation of Results:
Test results are reported in both IS scale and the corresponding molecular response
(MR) value. The BCR-ABL/ABL ratio percent IS result and MR value is calculated
by the MRDx BCR-ABL Test Software using the following equations.
MR Values with the corresponding IS values are show in the table below:

1. Analytical performance:
a) Precision-Repeatability:
Contrived patient samples targeting MR3.0, MR4.0, and MR4.5 for e13a2 and
e14a2 BCR-ABL transcripts were created using CML patient RNA and non-
diseased subject RNA extracted from both PAXgene Blood RNA tubes and
EDTA blood collection tubes. The MR3.0, MR4.0, and MR4.5 RNA samples
were each tested in 17 replicates on individual MRDx BCR-ABL Test plates.
For EDTA Blood RNA, all levels for both transcripts passed the acceptance
criteria of ≤ 0.25 SD log . The highest standard deviation was observed for
10
the e14a2 BCR-ABL transcript at MR4.5 (SD = 0.087).
For PAXgene Blood RNA, all levels for both transcripts passed the
acceptance criteria (SD ≤ 0.25 SD log ). The highest standard deviation was
10
observed for the e14a2 BCR-ABL transcript at MR4.5 (SD=0.10).
The repeatability results are shown in Table 3A below.

b) Precision -Assay Controls
To evaluate the precision of the RNA controls, six lots of the RNA controls
were tested with twenty replicates per lot. The acceptance criteria were that
the accuracy (Mean MR) is within ± 0.25 of target MR value, and the
precision (SD) are less than 0.125 for MMR and less than 0.25 for MR4.5
across all six lots. The RNA control precision data are shown in Table 3B
above. All acceptance criteria were met, supporting the precision conclusion
of the assay RNA controls.
c) Precision -Reproducibility
i. Reproducibility – EDTA tube
Two (2) series of samples were created with blood drawn into EDTA
tubes by separately diluting pooled e13a2 and pooled e14a2 high positive
CML patient samples into blood from non-diseased subjects. Five (5)
levels were created with targeted BCR-ABL/ABL % IS ratios from 10 %
IS to 0.0032 % IS (MR1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 4.5). Three (3) testing sites
with 2 instruments and 2 operators were used. Each day at each site, each
operator ran 2 plates, 1 on each instrument. Each plate had 1 replicate of
the e13a2 five-member panel and one replicate of the e14a2 five-member
panel. For each of 2 lots, 5 runs were performed. A total of 15
measurements were made per instrument, per operator. A total of 60
replicates (15 measurements per instrument per site x 2 instruments x 2
operators=60) were run at each site for each BCR-ABL transcript type.

The acceptance criteria were that the total precision expressed in SD of the
MR value for each sample across sites, lots, instruments, operators, and
days must be less than 0.25. The acceptance criteria were met, with the
highest SD of 0.14 observed with e14a2 transcript at MR4.5. The data
support the conclusion that the assay with EDTA collection tube is
reproducible across MR1.0-MR4.5 levels. The results are shown in Table

ii. Reproducibility - PAXgene tube
For PAXgene Blood RNA tubes, 2 precision panels (1 each for e13a2
and e14a2e transcript) were created using pooled high positive CML
patient samples diluted non-diseased (BCR-ABL negative) samples.
Five (5) levels were created for each panel with targeted BCR-
ABL/ABL % IS ratios ranging from 10% IS to 0.0032% IS (MR1.0, 2.0,
3.0, 4.0 and 4.5).
Reproducibility was evaluated at 1 testing site with 3 operators and 1
instrument per operator. Precision panel samples were extracted with 3
extraction reagent lots and evaluated using 3 MRDx BCR-ABL Test kit
lots over 5 non-consecutive days for a total of 15 replicates. A total of 90
replicates were generated for each panel member for each BCR-ABL

transcript type. The acceptance criteria were that the total within-
laboratory precision expressed in SD (MR value) for each must be less
than 0.25. The reproducibility acceptance criteria were met for all the
variables tested, with the highest variability was observed with e14a2
transcript at MR4.5 level (Total SD =0.24). The results (summarized in

d) Linearity/Reportable range:
Linearity was estimated by testing 2 dilution series (1 for e13a2 and 1 for
e14a2 transcript) for each blood collection tube type (the EDTA and PAXgene
tube). Each dilution series had 10 BCR-ABL target levels and 5 replicates at
each level to evaluate the assay linearity across the target range from 15% IS
to 0.0010% IS (MR0.8 to MR5.0).
The linear regression analyses were performed for first, second and third order
polynomials Per CLSI EP6-A. The data was considered linear if the non-linear
coefficients from the second and third order polynomials were insignificant (p
> 0.05). When significant non-linear coefficients were observed, the Degree
of Nonlinearity was calculated per CLSI EP6-A. The linear regression curves
for both transcripts in the two collection tube types are shown in Figure 1A
and 1B below. The estimated regression intercepts and slopes from the linear
model are shown in Table 7.
Transcript e13a2 was linear from MR 0.93 to MR 5.1 with a maximum SD of
0.22 using EDTA tubes and was linear from MR 0.78 to MR 4.8 with a
maximum SD of 0.13 using PAXgene tubes. Transcript e14a2 was linear from
MR 0.99 to MR 5.0 with a maximum SD of 0.26 using EDTA tubes and was
linear from MR 0.93 to MR 4.9 with a maximum SD of 0.31 using PAXgene
tubes. The data support the assay’s linearity across the indicated detection
range.

The lower and upper limits of linearity for BCR-ABL/ABL % IS and MR
values for each tube type and BCR-ABL transcript were shown in Table 8
below. The linear range was truncated by the LoQ to determine assay range.
The data support the conclusion that the assay linearity across the reportable

e) Detection Limit:
i. Limit of Blank (LoB):
The LoB was determined by testing 30 BCR-ABL negative samples.
Samples were tested in duplicate using 3 assay kit lots for a total of 180
replicates. Out of the 180 measurements, 177 had no measurable BCR-
ABL values. Three (1.7%) had measurements well below the LoD of the
test which were reported as undetected.
ii. Limit of Detection (LoD):
The LoD was determined using 6 CML patient specimens (3 specimens
each for e13a2 and e14a2 transcripts). RNA of each sample was extracted
with both PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes and EDTA blood collection tubes
and serial diluted into RNA extracted from non-diseased subject blood to
create five level panels. Sufficient RNA for each panel was made to allow
for the testing of 60 total replicates (20 replicates x 3 lots) of each level in
the panel. There were 1725 and 1595 valid EDTA and PAXgene samples
tested respectively.
The LoD was calculated using the parametric analysis as described in CLSI
EP17-A2. Using EDTA blood collection tubes, the LoDs were estimated to
be 0.00019% IS (MR5.7) for e13a2 and 0.00029% IS (MR5.5) for e14a2.
Using PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes, the LoDs were estimated to be
0.00039% IS (MR5.4) for e13a2 and 0.00029% IS (MR 5.5) for e14a2.
The final LoD was determined to be 0.00029% IS (MR5.5) for EDTA
blood collection tubes and 0.00039% IS (MR5.4) for PAXgene Blood RNA
Tubes for both transcripts.
iii. Limit of Quantification (LoQ):
The same samples in the LoD study were used to establish LoQ. The
average and standard deviation for the BCR-ABL/ABL % IS values and
MR values were calculated for the replicates for each level for both
extraction methods, BCR-ABL transcripts, and all 3 lots. The log bias

was calculated by subtracting the average measured BCR-ABL/ABL % IS
log for each level from the BCR-ABL/ABL % IS log nominal value.

The Total Error (TE) was calculated using the following equation:
Total Error = |Bias|+ 2 x SD.
The results were evaluated against the acceptance criteria of Total Error≤
0.5 log
10.
The LoQ for EDTA blood collection tubes was 0.0016% IS (MR4.8).
The LoQ for PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes was 0.0025% IS (MR4.6).
The MRDx BCR-ABL Test Software limits the LoQ and quantitated results
to 0.0032% IS (MR4.5) for both blood tube types.
f) Analytical specificity:
i. Interfering Substances:
For endogenous blood substance interference testing, CML samples at
2 levels (MR3.0 and MR4.5) extracted from both EDTA and PAXgene
collection tubes were spiked with all the following test substances:
· Hemoglobin 2 mg/mL
· Bilirubin 342 µmol/L
· Triglycerides 288 mg/dL
When compared to test results from samples spiked with matrix control
(i.e., cleared serum and water), no clinically significant difference was
observed from the samples spiked with the potential interference
substances, although reduced RNA yield during extraction was observed
in some samples. The largest difference between the endogenous
substance spike and the matrix control spike for PAXgene Blood RNA
Tubes was -0.080log (95% CI: -0.32 to 0.16) at MR4.5. The largest
10
difference between the exogenous substance spiked group and the matrix
control group for EDTA blood collection tubes was 0.060 log (95% CI:
10
-0.042 to 0.16) at MR4.5.
For exogenous interference testing, extraction kit reagents used in the
RNA extraction processes for PAXgene Blood RNA tubes and EDTA
blood collection tubes were examined to determine if any interference
from the blood tubes and RNA extraction processes were observed with
the MRDx BCR-ABL Test. Ten replicates of the MR3.0 and MR4.5 RNA
controls were spiked and tested together with ten replicates of the MR3.0
and MR4.5 RNA Controls spiked with water as a matrix control sample.
No clinically significant difference from the matrix control samples was
observed. The largest difference between the exogenous substance spiked
group and the matrix control group for PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes was
0.040log (95% CI: -0.010 to 0.090) at MR3.0. The largest difference
10
between the exogenous substance spiked group and the matrix control
group for EDTA blood collection tubes was 0.010 log (95% CI: -0.022
10
to 0.22) at MR4.5.
15

--- Page 16 ---
The data support the conclusion that none of the potential interferants
evaluated had any significant interference with the assay.
ii. Primer Specificity:
RNA from 6 CML patient samples (3 samples each for the e13a2 and
e14a2 transcript) were extracted and used as template for the MRDx BCR-
ABL Test. The resulting PCR products for both BCR-ABL and ABL were
sub-cloned into a cloning vector and ten10 colonies were sequenced. The
sequencing results were used to create a consensus sequence to compare to
the established Genbank sequence for ABL and both BCR-ABL
transcripts. The results matched the Genbank sequence with agreement
across all bases demonstrating that the MRDx primers and probes
amplified the intended targets for all samples tested.
Cross reactivity was further accessed by testing ABL2 in vitro transcribed
RNA and RNA from an e19a2 positive cell line as template. No cross
reactivity was observed with the ABL2 IVT RNA. As expected, cross
reactivity was present for the e19a2 BCR-ABL transcript as it contained
the binding sites for the primers and probe in BCR exon 13 and ABL exon
2. The cross reactivity of the MRDx BCR-ABL Test with the e19a2 BCR-
ABL transcript was mitigated by a precaution statement in the labeling
that the test is only indicated for use with CML patients diagnosed with
the e13a2 and/or e14a2 BCR-ABL transcript and should not be used with
samples expressing other atypical fusion transcripts.
iii. Specimen Carryover Contamination:
The carryover contamination study was performed by testing high positive
samples (near MR1.0) alternately juxtaposed with negative samples in
both extraction rack setup as well as MRDx plate setup for both PAXgene
Blood RNA Tubes and EDTA blood collection tubes.
The incidence of cross-contamination with PAXgene Blood RNA tubes of
samples was determined using 30 replicates across 5 extraction racks and
5 MRDx BCR-ABL Test plates. The incidence of cross-contamination
with EDTA blood collection tubes was determined using the Maxwell
CSC RNA Blood Kit with 40 replicates across 5 extraction racks and 5
MRDx BCR-ABL test plates.
No negative samples for either extraction method had a BCR-ABL/ABL
% IS value that was detectable above the LoD of the assay. The data
support the conclusion that the test generates no significant carryover
between wells on the plate.
g) Traceability:
16

--- Page 17 ---
The assay calibrators are traceable to the First (1st) WHO International
Genetic Reference Panel based on the method described in the 1st WHO
International Genetic Reference Panel for quantitation of BCR-ABL
translocation by RQ-PCR, Instruction for Use. On 5 different days, a different
WHO primary panel comprised of four levels (A-D) of freeze-dried materials
was reconstituted and extracted following the assay protocol. The
reconstituted/extracted WHO reference samples (200 ng RNA input/well) and
the MolecularMD WHO BCR-ABL Reference Panel Secondary Standards (1
µg RNA input/well) were tested using the MRDx BCR-ABL Test over 20
days for each of three MRDx BCR-ABL Test kit lots.
Deming Regression analysis were performed between the expected and
observed MR values for each lot. The conversion factor was calculated for
each lot individually and was 1.1 for all three lots (A, B and C), showing the
consistency of conversion factor across multiple lots. Data from all three lots
showed high traceability to WHO reference standards (see Figure 2 and Table
10 below), supporting the conclusion that the assay calibrators traceability to
the WHO reference panel has been established.

h) Stability:
i. Kit Real-Time Stability:
The real-time stability of the MRDx BCR-ABL Test was evaluated at
two storage temperatures (-30 to -15°C and -80 to -65°C) at periodic
intervals with three lots. Six kits from each lot for each time point were
tested using the final product release testing procedure. After use, the

--- Page 18 ---
kits were frozen, thawed, and refrozen without testing to achieve an
additional freeze/thaw cycle (Cycle 2). These six kits were then open-
vial tested at one month (Test 2 and Cycle 3), and two months (Test 3
and Cycle 4) post-reconstitution using the WHO BCR-ABL Reference
Panel Secondary Standards to ensure the kits were stable for three kit
uses with three freeze/thaw cycles with 2 month stability. Kits were
stored at -30 to -15°C after initial use for open-vial stability, regardless
the original storage condition.
For each time point, the MRDx kit was tested for performance of the
calibration curve criteria, the control results, and the WHO secondary
standards. Passing test results data exist for at least 16 months for 3 lots
of MRDx BCR-ABL Test stored at the two separate temperatures.
The data support a shelf life of 15 months at both storage temperatures
(-80 to -65°C and -30 to -15°C) and an open vial stability of 3 freeze-
thaw cycles and up to two 2 months following initial use.
ii. Kit In-Use Stability (Freeze-thaw):
This study is to demonstrate the MRDx BCR-ABL Test kit stability
during PCR plate preparation and the post-plate-assembly PCR reaction
at 2 to 8˚C before evaluation on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx instrument.
Both standard and extreme conditions were tested. The standard
condition used a newly opened kit immediately after thawing to setup a
PCR plate. The PCR plate was processed immediately after setup on
the ABI 7500 Fast Dx instrument. The extreme condition used a kit that
was thawed and refrozen twice to simulate the third use of the kit. After
the reagents were thawed, components were stored at 2 to 8˚C for 8
hours, and then the PCR plate was assembled and placed at 2 to 8˚C for
1.5 hours before evaluation on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx instrument. Two
(2) kits were run for each condition on each of 2 days with 2 sets of
calibration curves, RNA controls, and samples (total n=8 per
condition).
The acceptance criteria were that the mean of the test samples was ± 0.5
MR of the control. The acceptance criteria were met for both standard
and extreme conditions. The differences between the standard condition
and the extreme condition were less than 0.25 log for all levels of
10
samples tested. The largest difference observed between conditions was
-0.063 (95% CI: -0.24 to 0.12) for the MR4.5 sample. These results
support the stability conclusion that after 2 freeze-thaw cycles, the
18

--- Page 19 ---
reagent is stable at 2 to 8°C for up to eight hours before PCR reagent
assembly and up to 1.5 hours after PCR plate assembly.
iii. Kit Shipping Stability:
In this study, the MRDx BCR-ABL Test kits were evaluated with
multiple types of containers and shipping conditions. The mock
shipping conditions included both stress temperatures and extended
duration. The shipping conditions evaluated the minimum and
maximum payload. Maximum load was the worst case regarding the
amount of dry ice per shipping condition. The testing conditions were
executed sequentially as follows:
· 22°C ± 3°C for 4 hours
· 35°C ± 3°C for 6 hours
· 30°C ± 3°C for 56 hours
· 35°C ± 3°C for 6 hours
The results of this study demonstrated that the Polar Tech TC229 (P/N
049-0128) and BioFreeze 22L-133Hr (P/N 049-0129) shipping
containers can maintain an internal temperature below -65°C for all
load conditions during a 72-hour temperature stress test that simulated
typical shipping conditions, and the MRDx BCR-ABL Test kits
remained at their recommended storage conditions of -80 to -65 °C.
Functional testing using samples at MR3.0-MR4.5 also showed that the
kits performance after shipping stress met equivalency acceptance
criteria when compared to unstressed control kits. These results support
the conclusion that the assay kit is stable following shipment of up to
72 hours on dry ice.
iv. Specimen Stability:
For PAXgene Blood RNA Tube, samples at three levels (MR3.0,
MR4.0, and MR4.5) were created, stored at 2 to 8°C and tested in
quadruplicate at 0, 24, 48, and 60 hours. An additional series of
samples was created, stored at -30 to -15°C, and tested in quadruplicate
at 0, 14, 28, and 30 days. For EDTA collection tube, 17 CML patient
specimens covering the clinical decision range were collected and
stored at 2 to 8°C and tested in quadruplicate at 0, 24, 48, and 60 hours.
All tested samples passed the acceptance criteria of < 0.25 log
10
difference compared to the mean BCR-ABL/ABL IS log ratio results
10
at the T0.
These results support the following stability conclusion:
· Specimens collected in PAXgene Blood RNA Tube are stable for
at least 48 hours at 2 to 8˚C and at least 28 days at -30 to -15°C.
· Specimens collected in EDTA blood tubes are stable for at least
48 hours at 2 to 8°C.

2. Method Comparison Study:
The accuracy of detecting BCR-ABL transcript levels by MRDx assay was
further evaluated by comparing to a second reference method, a validated BCR-
ABL reverse transcription droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay. The study analyzed
a total of 217 samples of blood from CML patients ranging from 10% BCR-
ABL/ABL IS (MR1) to 0.001% BCR-ABL/ABL IS (MR5.0) drawn into
PAXgene Blood RNA tubes and extracted using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit as
well as samples drawn into EDTA blood collection tubes and extracted using the
Maxwell CSC RNA Blood Purification Kit with the Maxwell CSC instrument. A
total of 119 evaluable EDTA samples and 98 evaluable PAXgene samples were
tested with both tests.
A Deming regression was applied and 95% confidence intervals of the slope and
y-intercept were calculated. The predicted systematic difference between the two
methods was calculated at the clinical decision points for treatment-free remission
monitoring (MR3.0, MR4.0, and MR4.5) with 95% confidence intervals. High
concordance between MRDx test results and the reference ddPCR test results
were observed for both EDTA and PAXgene tube types (see Figure 3, Table 11
and Table 12 below), supporting the detection accuracy of the device.

3. Clinical Performance:
To support the indications for use, 2 clinical studies were conducted to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the device in identifying patients with chronic
phase (CP) CML eligible for nilotinib (TASIGNA®) treatment discontinuation
and continuous monitoring of patients off treatment for potential loss of
remission.
Study 1: Treatment discontinuation in newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP
patients who have achieved a sustained molecular response (MR4.5)
The ENESTfreedom (Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in clinical Trials-
freedom) study (NCT01784068) is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm study,
where 215 adult patients with Ph+ CML-CP treated with nilotinib in first-line for
≥ 2 years who achieved MR4.5 as measured with the MolecularMD MRDx™
BCR-ABL Test were enrolled to continue nilotinib treatment for an additional 52
weeks (nilotinib consolidation phase).
Of the 215 patients, 190 patients (88.4%) entered the “Treatment-free Remission”
(TFR) phase after achieving a sustained molecular response (MR4.5) during the
consolidation phase, defined by the following criteria:
• The 4 last quarterly assessments (taken every 12 weeks) were at
least MR4 (BCR-ABL/ABL
≤ 0.01% IS), and maintained for 1 year
• The last assessment being MR4.5 (BCR-ABL/ABL ≤ 0.0032% IS)
• No more than two assessments falling between MR4 and MR4.5
(0.0032% IS < BCR-ABL/ABL ≤ 0.01% IS).
The median age of patients who entered the TFR phase was 55 years, 49.5% were
females, and 21.1% of the patients were ≥ 65 years of age. BCR-ABL levels were
monitored every 4 weeks during the first 48 weeks of the TFR phase. Monitoring
frequency was intensified to every 2 weeks upon the loss of MR4.0. Biweekly
monitoring ended at one of the following time points:
• Loss of MMR requiring patient to re-initiate nilotinib treatment
• When the BCR-ABL levels returned to a range between MR4.0
and MR4.5
• When the BCR-ABL levels remained lower than MMR for 4
consecutive measurements (8 weeks from initial loss of MR4.0).

--- Page 22 ---
Any patient with loss of MMR during the TFR phase re-initiated nilotinib
treatment at 300 mg twice daily or at a reduced dose level of 400 mg once daily if
required from the perspective of tolerance, within 5 weeks after the collection
date of the blood sample demonstrating loss of MMR. Patients who required re-
initiation of nilotinib treatment were monitored for BCR-ABL levels every 4
weeks for the first 24 weeks and then every 12 weeks thereafter in patients who
regained MMR.
Efficacy was based on the 96-week analysis data cut-off date, by which time, 91
patients (47.9%) discontinued from the TFR phase due to loss of MMR, and 1
(0.5%), 1 (0.5%), 1 (0.5%) and 3 patients (1.6%) due to death from unknown
cause, physician decision, lost to follow-up and subject decision, respectively.
Among the 91 patients who discontinued the TFR phase due to loss of MMR, 88
patients restarted nilotinib treatment and 3 patients permanently discontinued
from the study.
By the 96-week data cut-off, of the 88 patients who restarted treatment due to loss
of MMR in the TFR phase, 87 patients (98.9%) patients regained MMR (one
patient discontinued study permanently due to subject decision after 7.1 weeks of
retreatment without regaining MMR) and 81 patients (92.0%) regained MR4.5 by
the time of the cut-off date. The cumulative rate of MMR and MR4.5 regained at
24 weeks since treatment re initiation was 97.7% (86/88 patients) and 86.4%
(76/88 patients), respectively. The efficacy results for ENESTfreedom study are
summarized in Table 13.

reason, loss of MMR, death due to any cause, progression to AP/BC up to the end
of TFR phase, or re-initiation of treatment due to any cause in the study) by the
96-week cut-off date. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of treatment-free survival for is

By the time of the 96-week data cut-off date, one single patient lost MMR at week 120, at
the time when only 8 patients were considered at risk. This explains the artificial drop at the
end of the curve.
Study 2: Treatment discontinuation in Ph+ CML-CP patients who have
achieved a sustained molecular response (MR4.5) on nilotinib following prior
imatinib therapy
The ENESTop (Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in clinical Trials-STop)
study (NCT01698905) is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm study, where 163
adult patients with Ph+ CML-CP taking tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for ≥ 3
years (imatinib as initial TKI therapy for more than 4 weeks without documented
MR4.5 on imatinib at the time of switch to nilotinib, then switched to nilotinib for
at least 2 years), and who achieved MR4.5 on nilotinib treatment as measured
with the MolecularMD MRDx™ BCR-ABL Test were enrolled to continue
nilotinib treatment for an additional 52 weeks (nilotinib consolidation phase). Of
the 163 patients, 126 patients (77.3%) entered the TFR phase after achieving a
sustained molecular response (MR4.5) during the consolidation phase, defined by
the following criterion:
• The 4 last quarterly assessments (taken every 12 weeks) showed no
confirmed loss of MR4.5 (BCR-ABL/ABL ≤ 0.0032% IS) during 1
year.
The median age of patients who entered the TFR phase was 56 years, 55.6% were
females, and 27.8% of the patients were ≥ 65 years of age. The median actual
dose intensity during the 52-week nilotinib consolidation phase was 771.8 mg/day
23

--- Page 24 ---
with 52.4%, 29.4%, 0.8%, 16.7% and 0.8% of patients receiving a daily nilotinib
dose of 800 mg, 600 mg, 450mg, 400mg and 300mg just before entry into the
TFR phase, respectively.
Patients who entered the TFR phase but experienced two consecutive
measurements of BCR-ABL/ABL > 0.01% IS were considered having a
confirmed loss of MR4.0, triggering re-initiation of nilotinib treatment. Patients
with loss of MMR in the TFR phase immediately restarted nilotinib treatment
without confirmation. All patients who restarted nilotinib therapy had BCR-ABL
transcript levels monitored every 4 weeks for the first 24 weeks, then once every
12 weeks.
Efficacy was based on the 96-week analysis data cut-off date, by which time, 61
patients (48.4%) had discontinued from the TFR phase: 58 patients (46.0%) due
to loss of MMR or confirm loss of MR4.0, 2 patients (1.6%) due to
subject/guardian decision and one patient (0.8%) due to pregnancy. Among the 58
patients who discontinued from the TFR phase due to confirmed loss of MR4.0 or
loss of MMR, 56 patients restarted nilotinib therapy and 2 patients permanently
discontinued from the study.
By the 96-week data cut-off, of the 56 patients who restarted nilotinib treatment
due to confirmed loss of MR4.0 or loss of MMR in the TFR phase, 52 patients
(92.9%) regained MR4.0 and MR4.5; 4 patients (7.1%) did not regain MR4.0 by
the time of the cut-off date. The cumulative rate of MR4 and MR4.5 regained by
48-weeks since treatment re-initiation, was 92.9% (52/56 patients) and 91.1%
(51/56 patients), respectively. The efficacy results for ENESTop study are
summarized in Table 14.

P. Other Supportive Performance Characteristics Data
1. PAXgene-EDTA Tube Equivalency:
A blood matrix equivalency study using 100 CML patient paired blood samples
was conducted to demonstrate that MRDx BCR-ABL Test results from RNA
samples extracted from PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes are the same as from EDTA
blood collection tubes. At least 4 PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes and two 6 mL
EDTA blood collection tubes were collected for each subject. RNA was extracted
from the PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit. RNA
from the EDTA blood collection tubes was extracted using the Maxwell CSC
Blood RNA Kit according to the device’s Instructions For Use.
For all paired samples that were above the LoQ of the test, a Deming regression
was applied and 95% confidence intervals of the slope and y-intercept were
calculated. The predicted systematic difference between the two methods was
calculated at the clinical decision points (MR3.0, MR4.0, and MR4.5) with 95%
confidence intervals. The data demonstrated that no clinically significant bias at
the clinical decision points was observed in the MR values from MRDx assay
results between the two blood collection tube types. Results are shown in Table
15 and Table 16 below.

2. CTA-IVD MRDx Equivalency
During the early stage of consolidation phase for the 2 clinical studies described
above in Section M.3, a prototype (CTA) of the MRDx assay was used. Samples
at later stage of the consolidation phase and all samples in TFR phase of the
studies were tested using the final (IVD) version of the MRDx assay.
To demonstrate equivalency between the prototype CTA and IVD MRDx test,
over 100 paired CML specimens across the assay reportable (MR) range were
tested using both CTA and IVD MRDx assays. This study was performed for both
EDTA and PAXgene collection tubes. Deming regression analysis demonstrated a
high concordance between the CTA and IVD MRDx test results for both
collection tube types across the assay reportable range (shown in Figure 6, Table
17 and Table 18 below), supporting the conclusion that the CTA and IVD version
of the MRDx tests are equivalent.
