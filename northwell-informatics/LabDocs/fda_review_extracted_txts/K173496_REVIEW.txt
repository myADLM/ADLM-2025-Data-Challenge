D. Type of Test: Enzyme Immunoassay
E. Applicant: Quidel Corporation
F. Proprietary and Established Names: Sofia 2 Lyme FIA and Sofia Lyme Control Set
G. Regulatory Information:
1. Regulation section: 21 CFR 866.3830; Treponema pallidum treponemal test reagents
2. Classification: Class II
3. Product code: LSR; Reagent, Borrelia Serological Reagent
QCH; Serologic controls for microbiology assays
4. Panel: Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Sofia 2 Lyme FIA:
The Sofia 2 Lyme FIA employs immunofluorescence for the rapid differential detection
of human IgM and IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi from finger-stick whole blood
specimens from patients suspected of B. burgdorferi infection of at least 2 weeks’
duration. The Sofia 2 Lyme FIA is intended for use as an aid in diagnosis of Lyme
disease. A negative result does not preclude infection with B. burgdorferi. Positive results
must be confirmed by testing with a corresponding second-tier B. burgdorferi Western
blot assay. Test results are to be used in conjunction with information obtained from the
patient’s clinical evaluation and other diagnostic procedures. The assay is to be
performed on the Sofia 2 instrument. Professional guidelines should be consulted
regarding testing and treatment for Lyme disease when acute B. burgdorferi infection is
suspected.
Sofia Lyme Control Set:
The Sofia Lyme Control Set is intended for use as assayed quality control materials to
verify the performance of the Sofia Lyme FIA and Sofia 2 Lyme FIA test system.

4. Special instrument requirements: Sofia 2
I. Device Description: The Sofia 2 Lyme FIA is an immunofluorescence-based, lateral flow
assay for detection of IgM and/or IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in patient
specimens. Reagents for the assay are ready-to-use and provided in the kit.
The assay uses a bidirectional test strip format to detect both IgM and IgG antibodies to B.
burgdorferi. One side of the test strip detects IgM antibodies to B. burgdorferi and the other
side of the test strip detects IgG antibodies to B. burgdorferi.
To perform the test, the patient finger-stick whole blood specimen is obtained with the
provided Capillary Tube (a.k.a. whole blood separator device). The Capillary Tube stands or
is held vertically to allow the blood to drain. This device separates the red blood cells from
the whole blood specimen using a gravimetric flow through a sample pad coated with rabbit
anti-human red blood cell (RBC) antibodies. The user dispenses all of the Reagent Solution
into the Reagent Tube and inserts the Capillary Tube into the Reagent Tube and shakes the
tube vigorously. Two drops of diluted sample are dispensed into the round sample well
located near the center of the Test Cassette.
The Test Cassette is loaded into Sofia 2 for an automatically defined development time
(Walk Away Mode) or pre-incubated on the bench top prior to loading into Sofia 2 (Read
Now Mode). Sofia 2 scans the test strip, analyzes the fluorescent signal, and then displays
two (2) test results: IgM and IgG.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Note: Due to the inability to collect a finger-stick whole blood sample for certain studies, the
performance characteristics are based on a combination of studies performed with either
Sofia Lyme FIA or Sofia 2 Lyme FIA on either Sofia or Sofia 2 instruments which are
equivalent. The sponsor has also established matrix equivalency between whole blood and
serum/plasma to be able to use the data generated on Sofia instrument.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision: The precision of the Sofia Lyme FIA with Sofia 2 was evaluated at one
Quidel site utilizing 2 operators and 2 Sofia 2 instruments. Contrived samples were
prepared at levels that ranged from negative to moderate positive for both IgM and IgG.

Normal Population Study: To determine the analytical specificity of the Sofia Lyme
FIA with Sofia 2, 200 seemingly healthy individuals with no known history of physician-
diagnosed Lyme disease were evaluated. Half of the samples (100) were collected from a
non-endemic Lyme region while the other half of the samples (100) were collected from
an endemic Lyme region of the United States. Samples were tested on Sofia Lyme FIA
and the predicate Lyme IgM and IgG assays.

Cross-Reactivity: The cross-reactivity of the Sofia Lyme FIA with Sofia was evaluated
with 17 disease state sample types that have the potential to interfere with the Sofia Lyme
FIA assay. Samples were characterized and obtained from commercial vendors and did
not include any first or second tier Lyme testing results.

f. Assay cut-off:
The Assay Cutoff Study was performed to determine and confirm the two separate assay
cutoff limits for the Sofia 2 Lyme FIA. One cutoff limit was established for Lyme IgG
and one cutoff limit was established for Lyme IgM. The general procedure was to test
matched finger-stick whole blood, serum and plasma samples with the aim of setting the
whole blood assay cutoff so that the clinical performance, percent positive agreement
(PPA) and the percent negative agreement (NPA), of the whole blood assay is statistically
similar to the FDA cleared serum and plasma assay. After the cutoffs were established,
the values were validated as part of the clinical trial as well as other analytical studies.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Prospective Study: A prospective study with Sofia 2 Lyme FIA with Sofia 2 was
performed using matched blood specimens (finger-stick and serum/plasma) samples
collected from 327 subjects suspected of and exhibiting symptoms of Lyme disease
across 11 sites located in Lyme endemic regions throughout the United States. Sofia 2
Lyme FIA finger-stick whole blood testing was performed immediately at each of the 11
clinical sites by CLIA Waived operators. The predicate Lyme IgM and IgG assays and
western blot Lyme IgM and IgG assays were performed at central reference laboratories
that were different from the Sofia 2 testing sites. Out of 327 samples tested, three (3)
invalid Sofia 2 test results were obtained, therefore 324 evaluable subjects were included
in the analysis. First tier results for Sofia 2 Lyme FIA and the predicate assays are shown
in the following two Tables.

Second-Tier Testing: As recommended by CDC guidelines, second tier Western blot
testing was performed on all positive (and equivocal with the predicate assay) samples
when tested by either Sofia 2 or the predicate. The percent agreement between Sofia 2
and the predicate Lyme test are shown in the following two Tables.

b. Matrix comparison:
The Sofia 2 Lyme FIA is to be used only with a finger-stick whole blood sample. The
finger-stick whole blood matrix on the Sofia 2 Lyme FIA was demonstrated to be
equivalent to the serum/plasma matrix on the Sofia Lyme FIA. A field study was
conducted using matched finger-stick whole blood, serum and plasma. The results are
summarized below and show performance is equivalent between the different sample
types.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Clinical/Diagnostic Sensitivity Study: To assess the sensitivity of the Sofia Lyme FIA
with Sofia, 95 well-characterized clinically or culture confirmed Lyme disease serum
samples were tested on Sofia Lyme and compared to the predicate IgM and IgG assays.
The samples were blinded and tested on both Sofia Lyme FIA and the predicate Lyme
IgM and Lyme IgG tests. The Sofia results are compared to those obtained with predicate
Lyme IgM and IgG assays. Results for IgM and IgG are shown below.

CDC Panel Results: A blinded serum panel consisting of 280 samples was obtained
from the CDC and was evaluated internally using the Sofia Lyme FIA with Sofia. The
Lyme disease samples are from physician-diagnosed patients with various stages of the
disease. Early Lyme EM positive samples were collected days to weeks after disease
onset. Late Lyme samples were collected months to years post disease onset. Samples
from control individuals include sera from patients with lookalike or cross-reactive
diseases/syndromes (syphilis, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, mononucleosis, multiple
sclerosis and severe periodontitis) and from healthy controls that are from individuals
