H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Simplexa Bordetella Direct MOL2750
The DiaSorin Simplexa Bordetella Direct MOL2750 assay is an in vitro diagnostic test
intended for use on the LIAISON MDX instrument for the qualitative detection and
differentiation of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis nucleic acids from frozen
nasopharyngeal (NPS) specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of Bordetella
infection of the respiratory tract.
The Simplexa Bordetella Direct MOL2750 assay is performed on the LIAISON MDX
instrument and utilizes real-time PCR amplification to detect B. pertussis by targeting the
IS481 insertional element of the B. pertussis genome and to detect B. parapertussis by
targeting the IS1001 insertional element of the B. parapertussis genome. The IS481
insertional element can also be present in B. holmesii and B. bronchiseptica. Specimens
collected from patients with respiratory infection caused by B. pertussis, B. holmesii or B.
bronchiseptica may yield positive test results in IS481 assays. B. holmesii infection may
cause clinical illness similar to B. pertussis, and mixed outbreaks involving both B. pertussis
and B. holmesii infection have been reported. Additional testing should be performed if
necessary to differentiate B. holmesii and B. pertussis. B. bronchiseptica is a rare cause of
infection in humans. When clinical factors suggest that B. pertussis may not be the cause of
respiratory infection, other clinically appropriate investigation(s) should be carried out in
accordance with published guidelines.
Negative results for the Simplexa Bordetella Direct MOL2750 assay do not preclude
Bordetella infection and positive results do not rule out co-infection with other respiratory
pathogens. Results from the Simplexa Bordetella Direct assay MOL2750 should be used with
other clinical findings and epidemiological information as an aid in diagnosis of Bordetella
infection. Test results should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient
management decisions.
Simplexa Bordetella Positive Control Pack MOL2760
The Simplexa Bordetella Positive Control Pack MOL2760 is intended to be used as a control
with the Simplexa Bordetella Direct kit. This control is not intended for use with other assays
or systems.

I. Device Description:
The device is a real time PCR assay that enables the direct amplification, detection and
differentiation of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis DNA from unprocessed
nasopharyngeal swabs without nucleic acid extraction. The system consists of the Simplexa
Bordetella Direct assay, the Liaison MDX (with Liaison MDX Studio Software), the Direct
Amplification Disc and associated accessories. Primers and fluorescent probes are used
together to amplify and detect Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis and internal
control targets. Insertion sequences IS481 and IS1001 are targeted to identify Bordetella
pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis DNA respectively in the specimen. An internal
control is used to detect PCR failure and/or inhibition. IS481 is also found in Bordetella
holmseii which can cause clinical symptoms similar to Bordetella pertussis. Additional
testing should be performed if necessary to differentiate between Bordetella holmesii and
Bordetella pertussis.

L. Test Principle:
The Simplexa Bordetella Direct assay system is a real-time PCR assay that enables the direct
amplification, detection and differentiation of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella
parapertussis DNA from unprocessed nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) without nucleic acid
extraction. The system consists of the Simplexa Bordetella Direct assay, the LIAISON MDX

between the runs. A panel of six parameters was assembled to complete this testing
which consisted of a positive control, a negative NPS in UTM, and four contrived
samples of analyte spiked into a negative matrix. The spiked samples included a low and
medium level of detection for both Bordetella species. Ninety replicates (3 replicates x 2
runs x 5 days x 3 sites) were tested for each sample panel member. The control sets,
positive control and negative UTM, were tested twice a day per instrument. The results
for the inter-operator, Intra-operator, Inter-site, and Intra-site reproducibility studies show
that the total percent coefficient of variation of ≤ 6.4%.

Precision Study
Positive Control Inter-lot Precision Study:
Three positive controls are 10 aliquots per kit at 100 µL of inactivated Bordetella bacteria.
Multiple lots were used to evaluate inter-lot reproducibility by performing 6 runs across
three consecutive days with two runs per day by a single operator (. Each run included at
least two replicates per positive control lot. A total of 37 runs were performed on four
instruments. The results of this study provided 100% qualitative reproducibility. The inter-
lot coefficient of variance is ≤ 4.2 %. The Simplexa Bordetella Positive Control Pack
(MOL2760) may be used as an external control for QC testing, training or proficiency
testing. Each laboratory should establish its own QC ranges and frequency of QC testing
based on applicable local laws, regulations, and good laboratory practice. Typical Ct values
for the positive control range between 21 to 26. Detection of the Simplexa DNA internal

Inter-lot Precision Studies:
The Simplexa Bordetella Direct assays was evaluated for lot-to-lot variability of the
Simplexa Bordetella Direct Reaction Mix. Three lots of Reaction Mix were used to test
six sample panel members, specifically a positive control, a negative NPS pooled UTM,
and four contrived positive samples in negative matrix. The contrived samples were low
and medium positive B. pertussis (strain A639) and low and medium positive B.
parapertussis (strain A747). Each sample panel member was tested in duplicate with
each Reaction mix for two runs per day for three non-consecutive days. In addition, a
total of twelve sets of daily external controls were tested across four instruments during
the study. A summary table of results is presented below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable because the Simplexa Bordetella Direct assay is qualitative.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The negative control for this device/assay is a non-templated control NPS sample and is
not included in the kit. The Positive Control (MOL2761), which is the only component of
the Simplexa Bordetella Positive Control Pack (MOL2760), shelf life was determined to
be 12 months. Testing was conducted every 3 months past date of manufacture up to 12
months and one-month past expiration dating (OMPE). The same testing strategy was
employed for the Simplexa Bordetella Reaction Mix (MOL2750) and all data supported
12-month stability for these reagents.
d. Limit of detection:
The LoD for the Simplexa Bordetella Direct assay was determined on two B. pertussis
strains (A639 and BAA-589) and two B. parapertussis strains (A747 and E595). Samples
were prepared using quantified stocks serially diluted into native negative
nasopharyngeal swab matrix in Universal Transport Media (UTM). The LoD was defined
as the lowest concentration at which 95% of replicates were positive for the respective
species of Bordetella. For each strain, eight different concentrations of bacteria were
spiked into UTM. Each concentration was tested in at least 32 replicates in a total of 201
runs over 17 non-consecutive days. A summary of the results for each species evaluated
is provided in Table 7 below:

The results of the LoD experiments showed that the LoD of the Simplexa Bordetella
Direct assay for detection of B. pertussis is 14.7 and 20.9 CFU/mL for strains A639 and
BAA-589, respectively. The LoD for B. parapertussis was is 347.3 and 239.0 CFU/mL
for strains A747 and E595, respectively.
e. Analytical Reactivity/Inclusivity:
The Simplexa Bordetella Direct assay was evaluated for analytical reactivity to 18
Bordetella strains (12 B. pertussis and 6 B. parapertussis) not tested in the LoD study.
Samples were prepared by spiking each strain into negative NPS matrix at 2x LoD. All
18 strains were detected as positive for B. pertussis at or below 80 CFU/mL and for B.
parapertussis at or below 590 CFU/mL. In silico BLAST analysis demonstrated that the
assay should detect at least 294 additional B. pertussis strains and 5 additional B.
parapertussis strains.

f. Analytical Specificity:
Cross-Reactivity:
The Simplex Bordetella Direct was evaluated for potential cross reactivity with
organisms that are closely related, cause similar clinical symptoms, or are present as
normal flora in the nasopharynx. Microorganisms listed in Table 9 below were spiked at
high concentrations into negative samples. Ninety-seven samples were tested with no
cross-reactivity except for Bordetella holmesii which is expected to cross react since this
species of Bordetella has the IS481 element present in Bordetella pertussis.

Interfering Substances:
Sixteen potentially interfering endogenous and exogenous substances were evaluated for
potential interference with the Simplexa Bordetella Direct assay. The substances tested
were Albuterol sulfate, Ampicillin powder, Azithromycin powder, Beclomethasone
dipropionate, Blood, Chloraseptic sore throat spray, Ciprofloxacin, Erythromycin,
Flonase Nasal Spray, Mucin, Mupirocin, Rifampicin, Robitussin DM, Saline Nasal spray,
Sudafed PE, and Zicam spray. Each substance was evaluated in contrived samples that
contained Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis at low positive
concentrations (approximately 1-2 x LoD) and moderate positive concentrations
(approximately 2-4 x LoD). Results of the study demonstrated that there was no evidence
of interference caused by the substances at the concentrations listed, both high and low
concentrations.
Competitive Interference:
The Simplexa Bordetella Direct assay was evaluated for competitive interference by
testing whether the presence of a clinically relevant high concentration of either B.
pertussis or B. parapertussis could affect detection of the other targeted Bordetella
species when present at a low level. A low positive sample was contrived for each target
by spiking B. pertussis or B. parapertussis separately (at approximately 2x LoD) into
nasopharyngeal swab matrix in universal transport media (UTM) and a baseline Ct value
was determined for each sample. High concentrations of the other Bordetella strain were
then spiked into the low-level sample and tested. No competitive interference was
observed. The results as shown in Table 10 below showed that a low level of B. pertussis
was detected in the presence of a high level of B. parapertussis; similarly a low level of
B. parapertussis was detected in the presence of a high level of B. pertussis.

g. Carry-Over/Cross-contamination Study:
The Simplexa Bordetella Direct assay was evaluated for the presence of contamination
due to carry over in known negative specimens by alternating high positive samples with
negative samples. No evidence of carry-over contamination was observed.
h. Assay cut-off:
The Simplex Bordetella Direct Ct cut-off for Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella
parapertussis detection was determined during feasibility and verification studies. The
preliminary Ct cut-off for IS481 target (Bordetella pertussis) and IS1001 target
(Bordetella parapertussis) for analysis was set at 40 cycles. However, during verification,
all studies were performed to 45 cycles for informational use. When verification data
were evaluated, limit of detection (LoD) and clinical agreement results confirmed the
setting of the Ct cut-off for both IS481 and IS1001 at 40 cycles. The verification LoD
study detected all Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis LoD concentration
replicates prior to cycle 40. In addition, the verification clinical agreement study detected
all Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis positive clinical samples prior to
cycle 40.
Based on the results of verification studies, the final Ct cut-off was established at 40
cycles for both IS481 (Bordetella pertussis) and IS1001 (Bordetella parapertussis)
targets. Furthermore, the PCR cycling protocol was finalized at 40 cycles. The target Ct
cut-offs and cycling protocol are stored in the Simplexa Bordetella Direct assay
definition.

a. Matrix comparison:
The Simplexa Bordetella Direct assay was evaluated for performance with five different
collection and transport media types. The study also evaluated sample stability following
multiple freeze-thaw cycles as well as extended storage in refrigerated and frozen states.
The study was performed using eight LIAISON MDX instruments, and a single lot of
Positive Control across 18 non-consecutive days. A total of 336 experimental runs were
performed by four operators. Of these 336 runs, 194 were with contrived samples and
142 were for daily controls.
For this study, all samples were contrived in one of the following types of transport
media: Copan Universal Transport Media (UTM; also known as Universal Viral
Transport (BD UVT)), Remel M4, Remel M4RT, Remel M5 and Remel M6. For each
media type, 42 samples were contrived at various concentrations from 2x LoD up to 50x
LoD, for Bordetella pertussis and/or Bordetella parapertussis.
Results from the study demonstrated that Bordetella pertussis and/or Bordetella
parapertussis were detected appropriately in each sample, in each collection and
transport media type at each time point. There was no difference in the detectability of
the samples between the media types. Detection of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella
parapertussis in samples prepared at 2x LoD was confirmed in all five collection and
transport media types and across all storage conditions tested.
Fresh vs. Frozen
The Simplexa Bordetella Direct assay was evaluated for performance with five different
collection and transport media types. Multiple freeze thaw cycles, as well as extended
storage in refrigerated and frozen states, were evaluated for their performance on the
assay. The types of media examined include: Copan Universal Transport Media, Remel
M4, Remel M4RT, Remel M5, and Remel M6. For each media type 42 samples were
contrived at various concentrations from 2x LoD up to 50x LoD for both B. pertussis and
B. parapertussis. Samples were tested immediately following preparation, fresh,
subjected to refrigeration for up to seven days followed by storage at -70°C for at least 30
days and then freeze-thawed four times. The results of this study showed no statistically
significant effect due to the storage conditions and/or sample collection and transport
media based on the two sided 95% confidence interval of the percent detection observed.
Liquid Amies media was also evaluated on the Simplexa Bordetella Direct assay. This
study examined multiple freeze-thaw cycles as well as extended storage in refrigerated
and frozen states. Samples were contrived with Copan Universal Transport Media or
liquid Amies medium spiked with various concentrations from 2x LoD up to 50x LoD for
both B. pertussis and B. parapertussis. A total of 136 experimental runs were performed
by four operators over seven non-consecutive days. Samples were tested immediately
following preparation, fresh, subjected to refrigeration for up to 7 days followed by
storage at -70°C for at least 30 days and then freeze-thawed four times. The overall
results of this study indicate a slightly increased average Ct value for samples in liquid
Amies medium compared to samples in UTM; however, among the samples in Amies
medium there was no effect due to the storage conditions.

3. Clinical studies:
Prospective Study:
A total of one thousand one hundred thirteen (1,113) unique prospectively collected
frozen nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained from female and male patients
having signs and symptoms of Bordetella pertussis or Bordetella parapertussis from six
(6) clinical sites. The Simplexa test was performed at each of the clinical sites while the
comparator was performed at one central laboratory. All samples were tested within 72
hours of collection. The performance of the assay was compared to a composite reference
method consisting of two well-characterized real-time PCR assays (for each bacterial
pathogen) followed by confirmation of positive PCR amplification products with bi-
directional sequencing. Samples were characterized as negative if both comparator PCR
assays were negative.
B. pertussis Sequencing Assay 1
The assay targets the IS481 repeat element, nucleotides 740 to 1,050 of GeneBank
sequence ID AB473880. AB473880 is 1,055 base pairs. The Bordetella pertussis
Sequencing Assay 1 region is upstream from the IS481 region targeted by the Simplexa
Bordetella Direct assay. There is no detection region overlap between Bordetella
pertussis Sequence Assay 1 and the Simplexa Bordetella Direct assay.
B. parapertussis Sequencing Assay 1
The assay targets the IS1001 repeat element, nucleotides 834 to 1,145 of GeneBank
sequence ID JX013521. JX013521 is 1,190 base pairs. The probe and primers utilized by
the comparator method assay for IS1001 do not overlap with the Simplexa Bordetella
Direct assay.
B. pertussis Sequencing Assay 2
The assay targets the IS481 repeat element, nucleotides 224 to 542 of GeneBank
sequence ID AB473880. AB473880 is 1,055 base pairs. Bordetella pertussis Sequencing
Assay 2 region is upstream from the region targeted by the Simplexa Bordetella Direct
assay. There is no detection region overlap between Bordetella pertussis Sequencing
Assay 2 and the Simplexa Bordetella Direct assay.
B. parapertussis Sequencing Assay 2
The assay targets the IS1001 repeat element, nucleotides 377 to 679 of GeneBank
sequence ID JX013521. JX013521 is 1,190 base pairs. Bordetella parapertussis
Sequencing Assay 2 region is downstream from the region targeted by the Simplexa
Bordetella Direct assay. There is no detection region overlap between BPP Sequence
Assay 2 and Simplexa Bordetella Direct assay.
18

Discrepant analysis was performed for B. pertussis samples using a FDA cleared NAAT.
The invalid rate for the prospective clinical study using Simplexa Bordetella Direct was
1.73% (30/1740 runs).
Contrived Specimen Study:
For B. parapertussis, 56 contrived specimens were evaluated at clinical study sites.
Specimens were prepared at various concentrations across the clinical range of the assay
(2-50 x LoD). Results are shown in Table 13.
The tables below show the agreement of Simplexa Bordetella Direct versus Bi-directional
Sequencing.

3. Specimen Identification:
The QR barcode card contains a digital representation of all the assay parameters
required to load the assay definition onto the system. It also contains lot specific
information. The Assay Definition information is scanned into the software by using the
card or by importing the Assay Definition file into the database. Valid assay definition
files may be pre-loaded into the database or loaded at the time of installation by DiaSorin
Molecular Customer Service personnel.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Nasopharyngeal swab specimens are used to collect a nasopharyngeal sample which is
then placed in transport media (list the claimed transport media here). Samples are loaded
on the DAD consumable and run on the LIAISON MDX machine.
5. Calibration:
The assay does not require calibration. The assay contains an internal control for PCR
function. DiaSorin Molecular offers optional external QC materials that are intended for
use with the assay. Controls are packaged in single use aliquots and stored frozen, once
thawed the controls are stable for 30 minutes at laboratory temperature.
6. Quality Control:
The Simplexa Bordetella Direct assay, primers and fluorescent probe s are used together
to amplify and detect B. pertussis and B. parapertussis and internal control targets.
Insertion sequences IS481 and IS1001 are targeted to identify B. pertussis and B.
parapertussis, respectively, in the specimen. An internal control is used to detect PCR
failure and/or inhibition.
