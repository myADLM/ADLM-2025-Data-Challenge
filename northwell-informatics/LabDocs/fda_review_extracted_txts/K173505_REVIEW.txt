L. Test Principle:
The system measures the amount of sugar (glucose) in whole blood. The glucose
testing is based on the measurement of electrical current generated by the reaction of
glucose with the reagent of the strip. The meter measures the current, calculates the
blood glucose level, and displays the result. The strength of the current produced by the
reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the blood sample.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed using venous whole blood samples spiked to 11
target analyte levels (10, 26, 65, 99, 148, 160, 249, 354, 439, 552, and 621 mg/dL).
Each sample was measured in replicates of 15 with 3 test strip lots and 5 meters and
the values compared to a laboratory-based comparator method (YSI 2300 glucose
analyzer).
The evaluation yielded the following regression equations for the three lots based on
all samples:
Lot 1 y = 1.0080x – 0.9462, R2= 0.9993
Lot 2 y = 1.0085x – 0.663, R2= 0.9992
Lot 3 y = 1.0064x – 0.6586, R2= 0.9986
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 20-
600 mg/dL. The meter displays “Low” with glucose values below 20 mg/dL, and
“High” with glucose values over 600 mg/dL. The “Low” and “High” functions were
validated and demonstrated to function as intended.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The FORA GTel Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to the NIST SRM
917c glucose reference material.
Test Strip Stability
Test strip stability has been evaluated through accelerated and real-time open vial and
closed vial studies. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The manufacturer labeled claims for shelf life stability and open vial
stability of 24 months when stored at 35.6- 86°F (2-30˚C) and 10% to 90% relative
humidity.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range for the FORA GTel Blood Glucose Monitoring System is 20-
600 mg/dL. See the linearity studies (section M.1.b.) above.

e. Analytical specificity:
Potential interfering substances were evaluated at three glucose concentration
intervals (61, 119, and 264 mg/dL) by analyzing 39 potentially interfering exogenous
and endogenous substances. Glucose values measured with the FORA GTel Blood
Glucose Monitoring System in venous samples were spiked with a potentially
interfering substance and results compared with values measured in control samples
(without potentially interfering substance) on the FORA GTel Blood Glucose
Monitoring System. The sponsor defined significant interference as bias greater than
±10% (versus control condition). The compounds at the concentrations listed below
were the highest concentrations tested that did not demonstrate significant
interference:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
User Performance Study:
To assess the performance of the FORA GTel Blood Glucose Monitoring System in
the hands of lay users, the sponsor performed a study with 350 lay user participants
who collected and tested their own fingertip capillary blood samples. Participants
were from two private general medicine clinics and one outpatient research center
specializing in diabetes and endocrinology. The glucose concentrations in the samples
ranged from 52-390 mg/dL as measured by the laboratory reference method (YSI
2300). Results were analyzed by comparing blood glucose results obtained from the
FORA GTel Blood meter by the lay user against the YSI 2300 laboratory reference
value obtained by healthcare professionals. Results are summarized in the tables
below:
Within Within Within Within
+ 5 % + 10 % + 15 % + 20 %

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Sample Volume Study
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate the minimal sample volume requirement for the
FORA GTel Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems using blood samples at volumes of 0.30 µL,
0.40 µL, 0.50 µL, 0.60 µL, 0.70 µL, and 0.80 µL. Five blood glucose meters were used in
this assessment and three lots of test strips to evaluate venous blood altered to glucose
concentrations of60, 112 mg/dL, and 222 mg/dL. This testing supported the claimed
minimum sample volume of 0.50 µL for this device and that the sample detection feature
functioned as intended when the sample volume was <0.50 µL.
2. Altitude Study
To evaluate the effects of altitude, one test strip lot was tested with 4 meters using venous
blood altered to glucose concentrations of 55, 106, 158, 257, 388, 476, and 592 mg/dL. The
samples were tested at various levels of pO2 levels in a glove box to simulate equivalent
altitudes from sea level to 15,000 feet above sea level. Results obtained were compared with
those obtained with a laboratory-based comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The results
demonstrate acceptable bias relative to the comparator method to support the claim in the
labeling that the meter can be used at altitudes up to 10,742 ft.
3. Hematocrit Study
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using venous whole blood. FORA
GTel Blood Glucose Monitoring System was tested with venous blood altered to glucose
concentration of 46.5, 102.5, 142.5, 233, and 372 mg/dL and thirteen hematocrit levels (10,
15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65 and 70%). Each sample was measured on ten meters
for each of three test strip lots and in replicates of four for each of the three test strips with an
established a laboratory-based comparator method (YSI 2300). Results of samples at each
hematocrit level were compared to samples measured with an established a laboratory-based
comparator method (YSI 2300) and support the claimed hematocrit range of 20-60%.
4. Test System Operating Conditions
Four FORA GTel meters were used to test venous whole blood samples with three lots of
blood glucose test strips. Five test conditions were used in this study: 6 °C/ 10% RH, 6 °C/
90% RH, 25 °C/ 60% RH, 47 °C/ 10% RH, 47 °C/ 90% RH. The protocol and acceptance
criteria for this test were found to be acceptable. The results supported the sponsor’s claimed
operating conditions of 46.4 °F-113 °F (8 °C– 45 °C ) and a relative humidity range of 10%
to 90%.
11

--- Page 12 ---
5. Readability Assessment
The readability of the labeling (user manual and test strip insert) using Flesch-Kincaid’s
analysis were found to be written not higher than 8th grade level.
6. EMC Testing
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing
(EMC) has been performed and the System was found to be compliant.
7. Infection Control and Robustness Studies
The FORA GTel is intended for a single-patient only. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing laboratory
demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant,
MicroKill+ Disinfectant Wipes (EPA registration #598940-10-37549). Robustness studies
were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance
or external materials of the meter after 260 cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to
simulate 5 years of single-patient use. The subject device abeling was reviewed for
l
adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
