3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
The following information is included as a limitation in labeling:
· The ability of the BD Phoenix AST system to detect resistance to
meropenem/vaborbactam in the following species is unknown because resistant
strains were not available or insufficient at the time of comparative testing: C.
freundii, C. koseri, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. oxytoca, M. morganii, P.
mirabilis, P. stuartii, and S. marcescens.
· Due to a small number of Enterobacteriaceae on-scale isolates available for
comparative testing, there is limited data regarding performance of the BD
Phoenix Gram-negative for meropenem/vaborbactam particularly around the
breakpoints. Therefore, though rare, isolates with MIC values of 4/8, 8/8 and 16/8
μg/mL should be confirmed with an alternate method.
4. Special instrument requirements:
BD Phoenix Instrument and software (V5.83A or higher)
PhoenixSpec Nephelometer
BD Phoenix AP instrument
I. Device Description:
This submission is for a single drug in the gram negative ID/AST or AST only panel. The ID
portion of the ID/AST combination panel was not subject for review in this submission.
The Phoenix AST method is a broth based microdilution test. The Phoenix panel is a sealed
and self-inoculating molded polystyrene tray, with 136 micro-wells containing dried
reagents. The ID/AST combination panel includes an ID side (51 wells) with dried substrates
for bacterial identification and an AST side (85 wells). The AST panel contains a wide range
of two-fold doubling dilution concentrations of antimicrobial agents and growth and
fluorescent controls at appropriate well locations. The AST panel does not include wells for
isolate identification.
The Phoenix System utilizes a redox indicator for the detection of organism growth in the
presence of an antimicrobial agent. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be
preliminarily identified as Gram-positive or Gram-negative. Colonies are then suspended in
ID broth, and equated to a 0.5 McFarland suspension using a nephelometer device. A further
dilution is made into AST broth (a cation-adjusted formulation of Mueller-Hinton broth
containing 0.010% Tween 80), to which the redox-buffered oxidation-reduction AST
indicator solution is added producing a blue color in the wells. The concentration of
organisms in the final AST broth suspension is approximately 5 X 105 CFU/mL.
3

--- Page 4 ---
The Phoenix AST Broth is poured into the inoculation port of the AST panel and the
inoculum flows into the panel, filling panel wells. Polyethylene caps are applied to seal the
inoculation ports. An air admittance port is located in the panel lid to ensure adequate oxygen
tension in the panel for the duration of the test. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and
loaded into the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System instrument where panels are
continuously incubated at 35o C ± 1o C.
Continuous measurements of changes to the indicator as well as bacterial turbidity are used
in the determination of bacterial growth. The instrument takes readings every 20 minutes.
Organisms growing in the presence of a given antimicrobial agent reduce the indicator
(changing it to a pink color). This signals organism growth and resistance to that
antimicrobial agent. Organisms killed or inhibited by the antimicrobial agent do not cause
reduction of the indicator and therefore do not produce a color change. The Phoenix
instrument reads and records the results of the antimicrobial tests contained in the panel and
interprets the reactions (based on the organism identification) to give a minimal inhibitory
concentration (MIC) value and category interpretations (susceptible, intermediate, resistant
or not susceptible). AST results are available within 4 to 16 hours. This is an autoread result;
no manual readings are possible with this system.
Additional comments concerning specific organism/antimicrobial combinations is provided
from the software-driven “EXPERT” system, using rules derived from CLSI documentation.

two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control wells” that contain no
antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was performed at three clinical sites using 15 isolates of non-
fastidious Gram negative organisms. The isolates were tested at each site in triplicate
over three different days using both inoculation methods (i.e., manual, BD Phoenix
AP) resulting in 405 data points (15 strains x 3 replicates x 3 sites x 3 days= 405).
The isolates tested in the reproducibility study included C. koseri (1), E. cloacae (4),
E. coli (1), K. pneumoniae (4), and P. aeruginosa (5). The mode MIC value was pre-
determined and the reproducibility was calculated based on MIC values falling within
±1 dilution of the mode MIC value. There was one “off-scale” MIC result when
inocula were prepared manually and three “off-scale” results when inocula were
prepared using the BD Phoenix AP. The best and worst case reproducibility was
calculated as described in the AST Special Controls Guidance document. The
reproducibility results were acceptable as shown in Table 2.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality Control Testing:
The QC isolates recommended by both FDA and CLSI, E.coli ATCC 25922, E. coli
ATCC 35218, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, K. pneumoniae ATCC BAA 1705, and
P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were tested a sufficient number of times (i.e., at least
20/site) at each of three testing sites. They were tested using both manual and
Phoenix AP inoculation methods and read by the BD Phoenix instrument. The results
are summarized in Table 3. Greater than 95% of the results was obtained for each
inoculation method and were acceptable.

The expected range for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 is 0.125/8 – 1/8 µg/mL and all
results were acceptable. However, the Phoenix MIC reporting range is 0.125/8 to 32/8
µg/mL and does not provide results lower than 0.125/8 µg/mL to cover the expected
range for E. coli ATCC 25922 (0.008/8-0.06/8), E. coli ATCC 35218 (0.008/8-
0.06/8), K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (0.015/8-0.06/8), and K. pneumoniae ATCC
BAA-1705 (0.015/8-0.06/8). A MIC value of ≤0.125/8 µg/mL indicated that the
results for these four QC organisms were acceptable.

of the BD Phoenix meropenem/vaborbactam package insert.
· “The lowest dilution of the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System
meropenem/vaborbactam MIC range is ≤0.125/8 µg/mL. Obtaining this value was
considered as an indicator that the quality control test results were acceptable.”
Inoculum Density Check:
The BD PhoenixSpec Nephelometer was used to prepare the inocula for testing of the
clinical, challenge, reproducibility, and QC isolates. The same inoculum suspension
was used for both the Phoenix System and the reference method testing. The BD
Phoenix AP instrument was used to standardize the inocula for challenge, QC, and
reproducibility isolates. Validation data for both the PhoenixSpec and the Phoenix AP
instrument was provided and found to be acceptable.

Results obtained with the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System - GN
Meropenem-vaborbactam (0.125/8-32/8 µg/mL) panel were compared to results
obtained with the CLSI frozen broth microdilution reference panel. Reference panels
were prepared according to CLSI M07-A10 guidelines. The range of dilutions
evaluated with the panels was the same as the BD Meropenem/vaborbactam panel.
The BD Phoenix Spec Nephelometer, the primary inoculation method, was used to
obtain a 0.50 – 0.60 McFarland for all challenge, clinical, QC, and reproducibility
isolates. The BD Phoenix AP instrument, the secondary inoculation method, was used
to test challenge, QC, and reproducibility isolates. It is designed to standardize the ID
broth inoculum equivalent to the BD Phoenix Spec Nephelometer, add the preset
amount of AST indicator broth to the AST broth tube, and transfer the required
aliquot of ID broth inoculum to AST broth tubes.
Clinical:
Clinical testing was conducted at three sites using 900 fresh and 114 stock
Enterobacteriaceae organisms for a cumulative of 1014 isolates. These consisted of
C. freundii (37 isolates), C. koseri (42), Citrobacter species (22), E. aerogenes (61),
E. cloacae (81), Enterobacter species (5), E. coli (283), K. oxytoca (57), K.
pneumoniae (171), M. morganii (40), P. mirabilis (87), Providencia species (28), P.
stuartii (27), S. marcescens (66), and Serratia species (7). Of the clinical isolates, one
isolate was resistant to meropenem/vaborbactam by the reference method.
Challenge:
Additional stock challenge isolates were tested at each study site. These isolates
consisted of organisms with known resistance mechanisms (e.g., isolates obtained
from FDA/CDC AR bank) to challenge the ability of AST system to correctly
identify the susceptibility category. Challenge testing was conducted using 127
Enterobacteriaceae organisms including C. freundii (16 isolates), C. koseri (2), E.
aerogenes (3), E. cloacae (27), E. coli (33), K. oxytoca (10), K. pneumoniae (31), P.
mirabilis (3), and S. marcescens (2). Of these 127 challenge isolates, 9 were resistant
to meropenem/vaborbactam by the reference method.
A total of 10 resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae were evaluated. No resistant
strains of the following species were evaluated: C. freundii, C. koseri, E. aerogenes,
E. coli, K. oxytoca, M. morganii, P. mirabilis, P. stuartii, and S. marcescens. Only
one isolate of E. cloacae was resistant. As a result, the sponsor included the following
limitation in the device labeling:
The ability of the BD Phoenix AST system to detect resistance to
meropenem/vaborbactam in the following species is unknown because resistant
strains were not available or insufficient at the time of comparative testing: C.
freundii, C. koseri, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. oxytoca, M. morganii, P.
mirabilis, P. stuartii, and S. marcescens.

Results for clinical and challenge isolates were evaluated separately and combined.

CA - Category Agreement vmj - very major discrepancies
R - resistant isolates min – minor discrepancies
Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the result of the reference method and that of
BD Phoenix within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are
on scale for both the BD Phoenix panel and the reference method. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the
interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the BD Phoenix result.
The Phoenix meropenem/vaborbactam performance met the acceptance criteria for
Enterobacteriaceae with overall EA an CA greater than 90%. However, given that the
low combined evaluable EA% (57.7%) and the limited number of isolates with results
around the breakpoints for analysis, the following limitation was included in the labeling
to address the potential for misreporting the MIC particularly around the breakpoints:
Due to a small number of Enterobacteriaceae on-scale isolates available for
comparative testing, there is limited data regarding performance of the BD Phoenix
Gram-negative for meropenem/vaborbactam particularly around the breakpoints.
Therefore, though rare, isolates with MIC values of 4/8, 8/8 and 16/8 μg/mL should
be confirmed with an alternate method.
All Enterobacteriaceae isolates were tested using a panel with the dilution range of
0.125/8- 32/8 µg/mL P. mirabilis and Providentia species isolates were tested using this
dilution range but showed low %EA and the sponsor submitted only truncated data and
requested that the reportable range be truncated to 0.5/8 – 32/8 µg/mL for P. mirabilis and
to 2/8 – 32/8 µg/mL for Providencia species. The EA and CA that were calculated were
based on these truncated ranges and incorporated into the overall EA and CA. Results for
organisms of these species will be reported based on this truncated range.
Trending
The performance of this device was evaluated for trending. There were only 55 results that
were “evaluable” for trending compared to the reference MIC. The results show 25 MICs
were below the reference (shift to the left), 8 were exact, and 22 were above (shift to the
right). There was <30% (i.e., -5.45%) difference observed between lower versus greater
and therefore, this is not considered indicative of a trend when comparing the device to the

coli, K. oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis.
The study indicated that susceptibility to meropenem/vaborbactam can be variable with
respect to beta lactamase type. For isolates where beta-lactamase type was known, eight

K. pneumoniae isolates demonstrated meropenem/vaborbactam resistance (>32/8 µg/mL)
in the presence of AmpC, KPC, OXA, CTX-M, TEM, and/or SHV. However, twelve K.
pneumoniae isolates showed susceptibility to meropenem/vaborbactam in the presence of
KPC, OXA, CTX-M, TEM, and/or SHV.
The following limitation was added to the labeling regarding other resistance markers and
enzyme characterization:
Enzyme group characterization was not available for some resistance
mechanisms at the time of comparative testing, and therefore the performance of
the BD Phoenix meropenem/vaborbactam is unknown for Enterobacteriaceae
isolates in the presence SME, CMY, and ACT.
