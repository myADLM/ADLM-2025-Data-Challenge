5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the
device and its components, and the results of the analysis.
A formal risk assessment was performed for the elimination of bleach tubes from the
cartridge and impact on the T2Candida 1.1 Panel. The risk assessment performed utilized
the T2Candida and T2Dx risk and hazard documentation including failure modes effects
analyses (FMEAs), risk management reports and hazard assessment in order to review all
content associated with the removal of the bleach tubes and cleanup step of the T2Dx
system workflow. The risk analysis identified the following risks.
1. Potential increase in false positive results due to contamination carryover of Candida spp.
Amplicon external to the instrument from operator handling of consumables (touch-and-
go contamination).
2. Potential for incorrect operation of the instrument due to software changes to modify the
T2Candida on-instrument assay workflow.
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities
required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.
The studies below were performed to demonstrate risk mitigation.
Carryover and Cross-contamination study
A carryover and cross-contamination study was conducted. Human whole blood pooled from
healthy donors was triple-spiked with either 100 CFU/mL or 1000 CFU/mL of C.albicans, C.
parapsiolosis and C.glabrata (APG) or C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and C. krusei (TPK).
There were 49 APG (37 samples at 100 CFU/mL and 12 samples at 1000 CFU/mL) and 48
TPK (36 samples at 100 CFU/mL and 12 samples at 1000 CFU/mL) included in the study.
One-hundred twenty nine (129) negative human whole blood samples were tested alongside
the spiked, positive samples. Samples were loaded such that the Negative Samples and
Positive APG or TPK samples were positioned in adjacent, alternating drawers. Two
T2Candida 1.1 Panel cartridge lots and two reagent tray packs were and two T2Dx
instruments were used in this study. Results were compared with the original data submitted
to FDA (DEN140019) (Table 1). For all channels specificty was found to be >99%. These
results support the risk assessment that removal of the bleach tubes results in similar assay
specitificy as reported for the original cleared test.

Cartridge Stability study
The T2Candida Panel cartridge was originally approved for use up to 8 months. However,
decreased cartridge stability was identified by the sponsor and was attributed to corrosion of
in-cartridge reagents, including those involved in PCR amplification. Thus, it was determined
that bleach tubes, which only serve as a precautionary element of post-testing
decontamination, should be removed from the cartridge. To assess the stability of the
cartridge without bleach tubes, a real-time cartridge stability study was performed that
measured T2MR signal at baseline (T=0), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 months post-initiation. The
study is also planned to continue to assess stability at 13 months post-initiation. Three (3)
T2Candida 1.1 cartridge validation lots were tested during the course of the study, with two
(2) lots stored at room temperature (15ºC-30ºC) and one lot stored in a controlled incubator at
30ºC. For each cartridge lot and time point eight (8) QCheck APG Positive External Controls
and eight (8) T2Dx QCheck Negative External Control were evaluated. Cartridges were
tested on multiple T2Dx instruments throughout the study. Stability acceptance criteria were
as follows: For each time point tested for each lot, the A/T, P, and K/G channels of the
T2Candida QCheck APG Positive control must be i) valid results with all channels POSITIVE
and; ii) within a 45% negative drift in the differenceof mean T2MR values at T=0 baseline.
Similiarly, all channels must be NEGATIVE (except for the Interal Control (IC)) for the T2Dx
QCheck Negative control. Further, the IC channel of the T2Dx QCheck Negatives must also
be within a 45% negative drift in the difference of mean T2MR values at T=0 baseline. The
A/T, P, and K/G baseline levels in the T2Dx QCheck Negatives were also verified to be within
a 45% positive drift in the difference of mean T2MR values determined at T=0. At present, all
stability time points for the 3 catridge lots have passed all acceptance criteria out to 9 months,
establishing stability for 8 months (Table 2). These results are acceptable.

Software Modifications
Elimination of the the bleach steps required modifications to the T2Dx software v. 1.0.0.1031.
The set of commands which executed the bleach transfer from the bleach tubes to all spent
reaction wells in the cartridge assembly were eliminated for the T2Candida 1.1 Panel. The
removed software commands do not interact with other steps in the workflow and are
executed after results are reported; therefore, results reporting are not affected. All
modifications are classified as low risk. These changes are acceptable.
Additionally, software updates have been made to the T2Dx platform that enhance the
reliability of the platlform and to integrate T2Bacteria Panel Assay Definition Files into the
overall menu. Included in these changes are modifications to results reporting. The original
T2Candida Panel did not distinguish a potential assay error form an instrument error – all
errors that led to no results reported were classified as “Invalid”. In the updated version (v.
1.5.2.XXX), potential assay errors due to low IC signal are returned as “Invalid” while other
potential failures are reported as “Results Not Reported”. These changes are acceptable.
