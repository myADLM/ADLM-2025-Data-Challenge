L. Test Principle:
The measurement of amino acids, succinylacetone, free carnitine, acylcarnitines, nucleosides,
and lysophopholipids with the NeoBase 2 assay involves extraction of dried blood spots from
newborns with a solution containing stable-isotope labeled internal standards and analysis
using a tandem mass spectrometry (MSMS) system. The response of each analyte relative to
their corresponding stable-isotope labeled internal standard is proportional to the analyte
concentration.
In the NeoBase 2 Non-derivatized MSMS Kit, data is acquired in the Multiple Reaction
Monitoring (MRM) mode. During this acquisition, a collisionally induced product of each
analyte is measured for a set time period. Data acquisition and processing is performed by the
software package included with the system.The triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer that is
used for these measurements is a computer-controlled device that separates and quantitates
ions based on their mass to charge (m/z) ratio. The extracted sample is delivered to the ion
source of the mass spectrometer by the liquid chromatography (LC) system consisting of the
autosampler, micro pump(s) and solvent vacuum degasser. What is reported in the MSMS
MRM spectrum is the m/z value of the precursor ions that generated a desired product.

amino acids, carnitines, nucleosides and lysophospholipids by adding extraction working
solution (EWS) containing NeoBase 2 Extraction Solution and NeoBase 2 Internal Standards
to the sample during the incubation step. However, for the extraction and measurement of
SA, the compound needs to be derivatized. This takes place simultaneously with the
extraction of other analytes by addition of an aliquot of the NeoBase 2 Succinylacetone
Assay Solution to the EWS.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three precision studies were conducted using dried blood spot punches following the
recommendations in the CLSI guideline EP05-A3. The repeatability and within-
laboratory variation for NeoBase 2 Non-derivatized MSMS kit were based on 80
determinations: 40 plates measured over 20 working days, each plate with 2 replicates
per sample. The samples were measured with the TQD MSMS system. Between-lot
variation is based on 75 determinations: 15 plates measured over five working days
using three kit lots, each plate having 5 replicates per sample. One TQD was used.
Between-instrument variation was based on 50 determinations. 10 plates were
measured with two TQDs over 5 working days, each plate having 5 replicates per
sample. The results are summarized below:

The reproducibility of the NeoBase2 Non-derivatized MSMS assay was determined
in an additional study on the TQD MSMS Screening System across 2 external sites
and one internal site. The reproducibility is based on 75 determinations: in each
laboratory 5 plates were measured over 5 working days using one kit lot and each
plate having 5 replicates per sample. The results are summarized below:

compared to alternative methods. Therefore, it is important that each laboratory
establishes its own reference range and cut-off values with the NeoBase 2 Non-
derivatized MSMS assay.”
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
NeoBase 2 Non-derivatized MSMS kit is traceable to NIST standards and has been
anchored to the non-labeled reference compounds, which are the primary calibrators
of the kit. The concentration of labelled secondary calibrators is assigned against the
primary calibrators.
d. Detection limit:
15 serially diluted dried blood spots samples in a blood matrix spiked with internal
standards were used for the analytical sensitivity study. Extracted samples were
pipetted onto the plates in 6 replicates of each, from the lowest dilution level to the
highest dilution level.
At the below listed concentrations the sponsor claims that they meet an imprecision
critera of CV less than or equal to 20%.

e. Analytical specificity:
Dried blood spot samples representing two different analyte concentrations were
tested in an interference study. The substances tested for interference included
endogenous substances and possible sample contaminants. The effect of 25
substances was assessed by the paired-difference method at two analyte concentration
levels (both normal and abnormal) with the NeoBase 2 Non-derivatized MSMS kit.
Additionally, 9 substances that are abundant in the DBS sample matrix and have
potential for unspecific effects on the test results were studied. Results confirmed that
11 of the 25 substances caused a significant change in the test result. These 11
compounds were further evaluated by dose-response testing.
At the following concentrations, the bias between the test and control samples did not
exceed 15% with overall 95% confidence. The sponsor claims that the following
substances were found not to interfere with the assay at the concentration indicated.

For the stubstances that did interfere with the assay, the following was added to the
package insert of the device:
Sarcosine: Amino acid derivative Sarcosine was found to interfere with the assay by
increasing the measured Ala concentration. Sarcosine concentrations above 62.5
µmol/L may cause a false positive screening result. Sarcosine concentration in plasma
ranges from 0–625 μmol/L in newborns aged 0–1 months. However, Sarcosine does
not exist in healthy newborns; it is only found at detectable amount when a newborn
is affected by hypersarcosinemia. Therefore, Sarcosine is unlikely to interfere with
Ala in routine testing.
Creatine: Non-essential amino acid Creatine was found to interfere with the assay by
increasing the measured Ala and Leu concentrations. Creatine concentrations above
1500 µmol/L with Ala or above 4500 µmol/L with Leu may cause a false positive
screening result. The normal expected Creatine level in newborns aged 0–1 months is
107–640 μmol/L. Therefore, Creatine is unlikely to interfere with Ala and Leu in
routine testing.
Verapamil metabolite D617: D617 is a metabolite of calcium channel blocker
Verapamil. D617 was found to interfere with the assay by increasing the measured
Asa concentration. D617 concentrations from 0.97 µmol/L may cause a false positive
screening result on Asa. Therapeutic concentration range in plasma for Verapamil is
0.11–1.32 µmol/L. D617 has been found to present appr. 20% of the given oral dose
excreted in to urine, i.e. the D617 level is very unlikely to exceed the concentration of
0.97 µmol/L in whole blood. Therefore, Verapamil metabolite D617 is unlikely to
interfere with Asa in routine testing. Nevertheless, newborns given Verapamil or
exposed to the compound during pregnancy or breastfeeding could screen positive for
Asa.
L-Lysine: L-Lysine was found to interfere with the assay by increasing the measured
Gln and Glu concentrations. L-Lysine is an essential amino acid and is isobaric to
NeoBase 2 analyte Gln. NeoBase 2 assay cannot separate the compounds, and the
result of Gln is a sum of Gln and L-Lysine (Gln\Lys). The reference plasma level of
L-Lysine, Gln and Glu in newborns aged 0–1 months are 92–325 μmol/L, 376–709
μmol/L and 62–620 μmol/L, respectively. L-Lysine may cause a false positive
screening result to Gln. The proposed cut-off area measured with NeoBase 2 assay for
Gln is generally high (e.g. 99.0% percentile, 1120 µmol/L). An additional 730
µmol/L dose of L-Lysine would be needed to raise the Gln concentration from
endogenous level (465 µmol/L) to the cut-off area (1100 µmol/L). For Glu, L-Lysine
concentrations from 355 µmol/L may cause a false positive screening result. Since the
whole blood used in the interference samples contains also endogenous L-Lysine, the
sum of spiked and endogenous L-Lysine levels are in the upper part of newborn
physiological L-Lysine range. In hyperlysinemia, the concentration of L-Lysine in
blood plasma is relatively high. Plasma L-Lysine levels have been reported to exceed
600 µmol/L and can reach up to 2000 µmol/L. When blood specimen is taken from a
26

--- Page 27 ---
newborn with such a condition, L-Lysine may cause false positive screening results to
Gln and/or Glu.
L-Glutamic acid: Non-essential amino acid and NeoBase 2 analyte L-Glutamic acid
(Glu) was found to interfere with the assay by increasing the measured Met
concentration. Glu concentrations above 2250 µmol/L may cause a false positive
screening result on Met. The reference plasma level of Glu in newborns aged 0–1
months is 62–620 μmol/L. Therefore, Glu is very unlikely to interfere with Met in
routine testing.
L-Asparagine: Non-essential amino acid L-Asparagine was found to interfere with the
assay by increasing the measured Orn concentration. L-Asparagine concentrations
above 375 µmol/L may cause a false positive screening result on Orn. The reference
plasma level of L-Asparagine in newborns aged 0–1 months is 29–132 μmol/L.
Therefore L-Asparagine is unlikely to interfere with Orn in routine testing.
L-Ornithine (Orn): NeoBase 2 analyte L-Ornithine (Orn) was found to interfere with
the assay by increasing the measured Pro concentration. The interference is caused by
mass transition overlap between a fragment of Orn formed in the ion source and Pro.
Orn concentrations above 188 µmol/L may cause a false positive screening result on
Pro. The proposed cut-off area measured with NeoBase 2 assay for Pro is above 200
µmol/L (e.g. 99.0% percentile, 235 µmol/L). An additional 638 µmol/L dose of Orn
would be needed to raise the Pro concentration from endogenous level (155 µmol/L)
to the cut-off area (240 µmol/L). The proposed normal population for Orn measured
with NeoBase 2 assay (e.g. 99% percentiles range between 152–194 µmol/L) is on
much lower concentration level than the needed additional dose. It is unlike that Orn
interferes with Pro in routine testing.
L-Methionine sulfone: Amino acid derivative L-Methionine sulfone was found to
interfere with the assay by increasing the measured Tyr concentration. L-Methionine
sulfone concentrations above 15.6 µmol/L may cause a false positive screening result
on Tyr. No reference concentration in newborns was found for methionine sulfone.
However, because methionine sulfone is an oxidation product of methionine
sulfoxide, and methionine sulfoxide is a product of methionine (Met), the highest
concentration of methionine sulfone should not exceed the normal level of Met in
infants aged 0–1 year (10–60 μmol/L). L-Methionine sulfone dose of 62.5 µmol/L
increased the endogenous Tyr concentration (53 μmol/L) to 76 μmol/L. Since the
proposed cut-off area measured with NeoBase 2 assay for Tyr is higher (e.g. 99.0%
percentile, 188 µmol/L), L-Methionine sulfone is unlikely to interfere routine testing.
Lidocaine: Lidocaine was found to interfere with the assay by decreasing the
measured C4 concentration. Lidocaine concentrations above 25.6 µmol/L may cause
a false negative screening result on C4. Lidocaine is a drug used to e.g. numb tissues.
If disinfectant pads containing lidocaine are used to wipe off the heels of newborns in
specimen collection, there is potential for lidocaine to be carried into the specimen.
However, the residual amount of this compound present after skin preparation should
27

--- Page 28 ---
only be a fraction of the effective interfering level and the less likely to interfere.
Therapeutic concentration range in plasma for Lidocaine is 5.1–25.6 µmol/L.
Concentrations above 25.6 µmol/L are reported as toxic. Therefore, Lidocaine is
unlikely to interfere routine testing.
Albumin: High albumin concentrations were found to interfere with the assay. When
total albumin is above 3.16 g/dL, the interference caused an increase in the measured
ADO concentrations. The reference range for albumin in infant plasma/serum aged 0–
12 months is 2.8–4.7 g/dL corresponding to albumin concentration of 1.4–2.4 g/dL in
whole blood.
Intralipid (Triglyceride): High intralipid concentrations were found to interfere with
the assay. When total triglycerides are above 0.82 g/dL, the interference caused an
increase in the measured Glu concentration. When more than 0.10 g/dL of intralipid
was added to blood containing 0.07 g/dL of endogenous triglycerides (i.e. tested total
triglycerides above 0.17 g/dL) the interference caused an increase in the measured
C24:0-LPC concentration. The reference range for triglycerides in newborns aged 0–
7 days has been reported to be from 0.02 to 0.18 g/dL in serum corresponding to
triglyceride concentration in whole blood of 0.01 to 0.09 g/dL.
Chlorhexidine digluconate: Chlorhexidine digluconate was found to interfere with the
assay by increasing the measured C24:0-LPC and C26:0-LPC concentrations.
Chlorhexidine digluconate is a cationic broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent belonging
to the bis(biguanide) family. Its mechanism of action involves destabilization of the
outer bacterial membrane. Chlorhexidine digluconate amounts above 0.03% may
cause false positive screening results on C24:0-LPC and C26:0-LPC. If disinfectant
pads containing chlorhexidine digluconate are used to wipe off the heels of newborns
in preparation for sample collection, there is potential for chlorhexidine digluconate
to be carried into the sample. It can be estimated that in the worst case, 1 µL of the
3% skin disinfection solution might contaminate a 75 µL blood droplet, which
corresponds to an amount of 0.04% Chlorhexidine digluconate in the sample.
Therefore, it is unlikely that Chlorhexidine digluconate will interfere with C24:0-LPC
and C26:0-LPC in routine testing.
Hemoglobin: High hemoglobin concentrations were found to interfere with the assay.
Total hemoglobin above 21.7 g/dL caused a decrease in the measured C24:0-LPC by
19% and in the measured C26:0-LPC by 28%. Total hemoglobin above 20.4 g/dL
caused an elevation in the measured ADO by 20%.
The effect of hematocrit on Arg was evaluated. Hematocrit values below 43%
increased Arg results by 20%, and hematocrit values above 63% decreased Arg
results by 30%. Although interference by hemoglobin and hematocrit was observed
with concentrations within the newborn reference ranges (12.0–22.0 g/dL for
hemoglobin, 35–65% for hematocrit), it is concluded based on the external study
results that the interferences are not pronounced enough to impair the separation of
the affected and un-affected cases. Interference by hemoglobin could cause false
28

--- Page 29 ---
negative screening results only if C24:0-LPC would be used as the sole marker for X-
ALD. C24:0-LPC should always be used together with the primary marker C26:0-
LPC.
Benzocaine: Disinfectants such as alcohol swabs with a topical anesthetic benzocaine
should not be used to wipe off the heel of a newborn. Benzocaine and Phe are isomers
having the same mass to charge ratio of 166.1. Therefore, benzocaine may cause
falsely elevated Phe concentration and a false positive phenylketonuria (PKU)
screening result.
C5 isomer pivalylcarnitine: Pivalic acid may cause false positive screening result for
Isovaleric acidemia (IVA), whose marker is acylcarnitine C5. Pivalic acid can be
liberated from a prodrug containing esterified pivalic acid (such as pivalic-ester
containing antibiotics, corticosteroids or other pharmaceuticals) administered to
mothers or newborns. Pivalic acid is further metabolized to pivalylcarnitine which is
an isomer of C5, and therefore pivalic acid can cause falsely elevated C5 results.
Falsely elevated C5 concentrations have been reported in newborns due to
pivalylcarnitine interference. Administration of pivalic acid containing prodrugs can
lead to carnitine depletion. In addition, falsely elevated C5 concentrations have been
connected to cases where pivalylcarnitine originated from neopentanoate esters
present in nipple-fissure unguent used by the breastfeeding mothers.
C8 isomer valproylcarnitine: Medication valproic acid administered to mothers or
newborns may interfere with the screening of Medium-chain acyl-CoA
dehydrogenase deficiency (MCAD) or Medium-chain ketoacyl-CoA thiolase
deficiency (MCKAT), whose diagnostic marker is acylcarnitine C8. Valproic acid is
metabolized to valproylcarnitine, which is isomer of C8, and can cause falsely
elevated C8 concentration. False positive MCAD results have been measured in
newborns due to valproylcarnitine interference.
C3DC\C4OH, C4DC\C5OH and C5DC\C6OH: Analytes in the pairs C3DC\C4OH;
C4DC\C5OH; and C5DC\C6OH; are all natural acylcarnitines that can be present in
dried blood spots and cannot be separated in the NeoBase 2 assay due to mass
transition overlap. The mass to charge ratios of the precursor ions are 248 (for C3DC,
C4OH), 262 (for C4DC, C5OH), and 276 (for C5DC, C6OH) and they all have the
same identifying product ion (m/z 85). As a result, the NeoBase 2 Non-derivatized
MSMS kit reports the results for these analytes in the pair together as a sum, which is
very much the same as the case for Leu\Ile\Hydroxyproline, and Gln\Lys. Because of
this overlap, the results for these analytes should be reported as the cumulative
concentration of the two analytes in the pair.
C16:1OH\C17: C16:1OH is a marker among other hydroxylated long chain
acylcarnitines for Long-chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency
(LCHAD) and Trifunctional protein deficiency (TFP). Heptadecanoylcarnitine (C17)
has been identified as a marker specific for Propionic acidemia (PROP) and
Methylmalonic acidemia (MUT). C17 and C16:1OH are isomers, having the same
29

--- Page 30 ---
mass to charge ratio of m/z 414, and are always measured in NeoBase 2 assay as a
sum of both analytes. In screening of LCHAD, TFP, PROP and MUT, the cumulative
sum concentration of C16:1OH and C17 increases. It is recommended to confirm
positive screening result with 2nd tier analysis, which is capable of separating
C16:1OH and C17 and identify specifically the disorder.
C26:0-LPC: Elevated C26:0-LPC concentrations have been measured in newborn
blood spots and post-natal blood specimens taken from children diagnosed by Aicardi
Goutières Syndrome (AGS) leading to false positive results in first tier X-ALD
screening.
Interference from M+2 Isotopic Peaks: The analytes and internal standards measured
in NeoBase 2 assay not only produce an M peak (the monoisotopic peak that is used
in the measurement), but also M+1, M+2, and M+3 peaks. These additional M+n
peaks are due to the naturally occurring heavier stable isotopes such as 13C, 15N or
18O. In tandem mass spectra of complex samples where many analytes are analyzed
simultaneously (as is the case of the NeoBase 2 assay) the M+n peaks of one
compound have the potential to overlap with the peaks generated by other compounds
of neighbouring m/z and cause falsely elevated peaks. Potential M+2 peak
interferences are as follows: M+2 peak of C5 overlaps with C3DC\C4OH; M+2 peak
of C6 overlaps with C4DC\C5OH; and M+2 peak of C8 overlaps with C6DC.
However, the effect is only significant when C5, C6, and C8 are present in high
concentrations. At the endogenous concentrations the risk for false positive result
with C3DC\C4OH, C4DC\C5OH and C6DC is negligible. When elevated level of C5,
which is a marker for Isovaleric acidemia (IVA) and 2-Methylbutyrylglycinuria
(2MBG), is observed, concentration of C3DC\C4OH must be evaluated. When
elevated level of C6, which is a marker for Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase
deficiency (MCAD), is observed, concentration of C4DC\C5OH must be evaluated.
When elevated level of C8, which is a marker for MCAD and Medium-chain
ketoacyl-CoA thiolase deficiency (MCKAT), is observed, concentration of C6DC
must be evaluated. Conversely, when elevations are detected on C3DC\C4OH;
C4DC\C5OH; or C6DC, it is recommended to evaluate the concentrations of C5, C6,
and C8 to ensure these observations are not due to the M+2 effect described here.
Plasticizers: Plasticizers or other additives may leach from the plastic material used in
the sample preparation, storage packages and medical equipment and interfere with
the newborn screening results. For example, slip agent Oleamide (m/z 282) is known
to interfere with C5DC IS having the same mass to charge ratio. Elevated C5DC IS
intensity falsely decreases acylcarnitine C5DC analyte concentration and may cause
false negative screening result on C5DC, which is a marker for Glutaric acidemia
type I (GAI). Similarly, a common anti-static agent Lauric acid diethanolamide
(LDEA, m/z 288) has been found to interfere with acylcarnitine C8 having the same
mass to charge ratio. LDEA can lead to false positive C8 result, which is a marker for
disorders Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCAD) and Medium-
chain ketoacyl-CoA thiolase deficiency (MCKAT) disorder. In addition, falsely
elevated C8 levels in two neonates treated with extracorporeal membrane
30

--- Page 31 ---
oxygenation (ECMO) has been identified. The C8 interference was traced to PVC
tubing used in ECMO and a plasticizer Di-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) used
commonly in the manufacturing of PVC. Interference originated from a DEHP
metabolite, 2-Ethylhexanoic acid, which was further metabolized in the exposed
neonates to a C8 isomer, 2-ethylhexacosanoylcarnitine, can lead to false positive C8
test result. In the other neonate sample, also falsely elevated acylcarnitine C6DC
concentration was detected. Interference was likely because of another plasticizer, di-
(2-ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA) metabolite adipic acid, which was metabolized to
C6DC. If DEHA is metabolized to C6DC, which is a marker for 3-Hydroxy-3-
methylglutaric acidemia (HMG), the false positive C6DC test result may occur. The
NeoBase 2 assay is validated with the specific microplates and plate covers provided
with the kit and any other items should not be used to avoid plasticizer or other
additive contamination.
Carryover:
The carry-over evaluation for the NeoBase2 Non-derivatized MSMS kit was
conducted by analyzing two plates using two TQD MSMS Screening Systems. Three
low sample replicates were measured immediately after having measured a high
sample replicate and the sample sequence was repeated twelve times during one run.
No functionally significant carry-over effect was observed with any of the analytes.
Drift:
The drift study was performed using several sample types at different concentration
levels to indicate possible drift. Neo Multilevel DBS samples, L1, L3 and L6 were
selected to demonstrate the drift at endogenous concentrations, near cut-off
concentrations and concentrations representing the upper part of the measuring range,
respectively. In addition, the drift of the available control materials, NeoBase2
Controls Low (LC) and High (HC), and publicly available QA controls were included
as samples in the study.
The drift study for the kit was completed via the analysis of 10 plates using several
sample types at different concentration levels (from endogenous area to the upper part
of the measuring range) to indicate possible drift. The results demonstrate that there is
no drift for 35 hours continuous run time with the TQD, which is the maximum
continuous run time when the autosampler is fully loaded. The fully prepared and
sealed assay plate can be stored in the MSMS system autosampler at ambient
temperature for 31 hours before the assay run starts.

4. Clinical cut-off:
The labeling for this device contains the following statement about cut-offs:
The determination of presumptive positives for metabolic disorders in newborn is based on
the use of a cut-off value, which distinguishes between presumptive negative and
presumptive positive values.
Please note that the values mentioned in this section should only be used as a guideline,
and each laboratory shall establish its own reference range and cut-off-values.
NOTE: Do not use a cut-off value that is based on data collected at another site or using
any other product than the 3044-001U NeoBase 2 Non-derivatized MSMS kit.
