in human blood. A relatively small drop of blood (minimum volume of 0.75 μL) is placed on
the disposable test strip coated with glucose oxidase which interacts with the meter. Within 5
seconds after testing, the blood glucose level is indicated on the meter’s digital display
screen.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The only differences between the four devices in this submission are the names and the
presence and absence of Bluetooth functionality. Therefore, the performance studies below
were conducted using the Rightest/GE Meter Max Plus as a representative meter.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run (Repeatability)
The sponsor performed repeatability precision studies using venous whole blood samples
adjusted to five glucose levels (30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250, 251-400 mg/dL).
Each glucose concentration levels was analyzed in replicates of 10 with three test strip
lots and on 30 meters (10 meters per test strip lot) for a total of 300 tests per each glucose
level. Results are summarized below:

duplicate sample measurements using the comparator method (YSI 2300 Analyzer).
The following are the results from the regression analysis:
Lot Slope y-intercept R2
1 0.9838 1.4412 0.9996
2 0.9827 1.052 0.9995
3 0.9832 1.5748 0.9996
3 Lots Combined 0.9833 1.3229 0.9996
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 10
to 600 mg/dL for this device. The meter displays “LO” with glucose values below 10
mg/dL and “HI” with glucose values over 600 mg/dL. The LO and HI functions were
validated and were demonstrated to function as intended.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The system is traceable to the certified glucose reference material NIST SRM 917b.
Test Strip Stability
Stability protocols and acceptance criteria for the Rightest/GE Test Strips Max were
reviewed and found to be acceptable to support closed-vial stability of 26 months and
open-vial stability of 4 months when test strips are stored at 39 to 86 ℉ (4 to 30℃),
10-90% relative humidity. The labeling instructs the users not to freeze the test strips.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 10-600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity study
(M.1.b above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by spiking 31 exogenous substances, endogenous
substances into venous whole blood with three glucose levels (50-70, 110-130, and
225-270 mg/dL) as measured on the YSI 2300 Analyzer. Interfering substances were
tested at each glucose level in replicates of 10 using three test strip lots and three
meters. The difference between the test sample (with interferent) as measured on the
meter and the control sample (without interferent) as measured on the meter were
calculated. The sponsor defined no significant interference as ≤ 10% between test
and control mean. The highest tested concentration of each substance tested with no
significant interference are summarized in the following table:

User Performance Study
To assess device accuracy in the hands of the intended users, the sponsor conducted a
user evaluation study involving 357 lay user participants who collected and tested
samples from their own fingertip, palm, and forearm. Results were analyzed by
comparing blood glucose results obtained by the lay users with the Rightest/GE
Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max/Max Plus against results obtained using a
laboratory comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer). Glucose concentrations in the
samples ranged from approximately 51.3 to 471 mg/dL as measured by the laboratory
reference method. Results are summarized in the tables below:

to repeat the test. If problems continue, the user is cautioned not to use the meter and to
contact the distributor.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study:
To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the Rightest/GE Blood Glucose Monitoring
System Max/Max Plus, venous blood samples were adjusted to hematocrit levels of 10%,
15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65% and 70%. Each
hematocrit level was tested at five glucose concentration intervals (30-50 mg/dL, 50-110
mg/dL, 111-150 mg/dL, 151-250 mg/dL, and 251-400 mg/dL). Results from the meter
were compared to results obtained using a laboratory-based comparator measurement
(YSI 2300 analyzer). The results support the labeled hematocrit claim of 10-70%.
2. Altitude Testing:
To evaluate the effect of altitude on the Rightest/GE Blood Glucose Monitoring System
Max/Max Plus, meters were tested at 0 ft (m), 3280 ft (1000 m), 6561 ft (2000 m), and
10,745 ft (3275 m) above sea level. Venous blood samples from 5 healthy volunteers
were each prepared at three glucose concentration levels (50-75 mg/dL, 80-120 mg dL,
and 270-330 mg/dL) and tested at each altitude. Results were compared to results
obtained using a laboratory-based comparator measurement (YSI 2300 analyzer) and
demonstrated that altitudes from 0 up to 10,745 ft (3275 m) above sea level have no
significant effect on blood glucose measurements.

Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated using venous blood
samples at 2 glucose concentration ranges, (60-100 mg/dL and150-300 mg/dL) to
evaluate temperatures ranging from 6oC (42.8 oF) to (111.2 oF) and relative humidity
from 10% to 90%. Six temperature and humidity combinations were tested including low
temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low
humidity, and high temperature/high humidity. The results support the sponsor’s claimed
operating conditions in the labeling that the system can be used in conditions of 43-111℉
(6-44℃) and relative humidity from 10-90%.
4. Infection Control and Robustness Studies:
The Rightest/GE Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max/Max Plus are intended for
single-patient use. Disinfection efficacy testing on the surface materials of the meter
demonstrated complete inactivation of duck hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen
disinfectant, CaviWipes Disinfecting Towelettes (EPA Registration Number 46781-8).
Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no
change in performance or in the external materials of the meter after 520 cleaning and
disinfection cycles designed to simulate 5 years of single-patient use for the Rightest/GE
Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max/Max Plus. Labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
5. Sample Volume Study:
To verify the minimum sample volume claim, venous whole blood samples with nine
volumes (0.60, 0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80, 1.00, 1.25, 2.00, and 3.00 µL) were tested. Sample
concentrations included three glucose levels (50-75 mg/dL, 80-120 mg/dL, and 270-330
mg/dL) and were tested at each volume. Values obtained with the candidate device were
compared to values obtained using a laboratory-based comparator method (YSI 2300
analyzer). Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.75 μL. The meter
displays and error message when insufficient sample volume is applied to the test strip.
The sponsor provided validation studies demonstrating that this error feature functions as
intended.
6. Used Strip Error Functionality Test:
A study was performed demonstrating that the Rightest/GE Blood Glucose Monitoring
System Max/Max Plus displays an error rather than a measurement result when a used
strip is inserted for testing.
7. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and Electrical Safety:
The sponsor provided appropriate documentation certifying that electromagnetic (EMC)
testing was performed and the systems were found to be compliant.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable.
