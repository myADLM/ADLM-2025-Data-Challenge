M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-Run Precision
The sponsor performed repeatability (within-day) precision studies using venous whole
blood samples adjusted to four different glucose concentration levels (51 to 110, 111 to
150, 151 to 250, and 251 to 350 mg/dL). Each glucose concentration level was analyzed
in replicates of 10, with 3 test strip lots and 10 meters, for a total of 100 replicates per
glucose level per test strip lot (for a total of 300 tests per each glucose level). Results are
summarized below:

Intermediate Precision
Intermediate (day-to-day) precision was evaluated using four levels of glucose control
solution (50-100 mg/dL, 111-150 mg/dL, 151-250 mg/dL, and 251-400 mg/dL). Each
control level was analyzed on 10 meters using 3 lots of test strips each day for a total of
10 days, giving a total of 100 measurements per lot for a total of 300 measurements for
each glucose level. Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed using venous whole blood samples. Twelve samples with
the following glucose concentrations were prepared: 40, 48, 74, 151, 204, 261, 361, 419, 473,
522, 553, and 630 md/dL (as established using a laboratory comparator method YSI 2300).
Testing was conducted in quadruplicate on three meters using three test strip lots (n=12
tests per glucose concentration). The evaluation yielded the following regression results:
Strip Lot Slope Y-Intercept 2
R
1 1.05 4.03 0.999
2 1.01 0.13 0.999
3 1.04 4.1 0.999
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of 50
to 600 mg/dL. If a sample is less than 50 mg/dL glucose, the result is flagged by the
meter as LO. If a sample result exceeds 600 mg/dL glucose, the result is flagged by the
meter as HI. The LO and HI functions were validated and demonstrated to function as
intended.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The system is traceable to the NIST SRM #917c glucose reference material.
Open and Closed Vial Stability:
Test strip stability was assessed using accelerated and real-time stability studies. Testing
protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The labeling
includes claims that the Confidence Test Strips are stable for 6 months after opening and
12 months unopened when stored between 41-104ºF (5-40ºC) and 10-85% relative
humidity.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range for the Confidence Blood Glucose Monitoring System is 50-600
mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity study (M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by spiking endogenous and exogenous substances
into venous whole blood. Twenty-eight substances were tested at three glucose levels
(50-70, 110-130, and 225-270 mg/dL) in replicates of 10 on each of 3 strip lots per
glucose levels yielding thirty replicates per glucose level. Results of spiked samples with
potential interferent were compared to samples with zero potential interferent by
measurement on the Confidence meter. The compounds at the concentrations listed below
did not have significant interference (defined by the sponsor as average bias between
spiked and control sample glucose results withitn ± 10% with glucose >100 mg/dL and
within 10 mg/dL with glucose <100 mg/dL). The highest concentraitons at which no
significant interference was observed are presented in the following table:

User Performance Study
To assess the performance of the Confidence Glucose Monitoring System in the hands of
the intended users, the sponsor performed a study with 187 lay user participants who
collected and tested samples from their own fingertip. Results were analyzed by
comparing blood glucose results obtained by the lay users with the Confidence Glucose
Monitoring System against results obtained using a laboratory comparator method (YSI
2300 analyzer). Glucose concentrations in the samples ranged from approximately 60 to
480 mg/dL as measured by the laboratory comparator method. Results are summarized in
the tables below:
For glucose concentrations <75 mg/dL
Within 5 mg/dL Within 10 mg/dL Within 15 mg/dL
78% (14/18) 100% (18/18) 100% (18/18)
For glucose concentrations >75 mg/dL

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Sample Volume Study:
To verify the test strip minimum sample volume requirement, fresh venous blood with
five volumes (0.6, 0.7, 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5 uL) were tested. Sample concentrations included
four glucose concentrations (56, 121, 194, and 302 mg/dL), established using a laboratory
comparator method YSI 2300 analyzer, were tested at each volume. Values obtained with
the candidate device were compared to values obtained using a laboratory-based
comparator method. Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of 1.2 μL. The
sponsor provided validation studies demonstrating that with blood volumes below 1.2 μL,
the insufficient sample volume error message functioned as intended.
2. Hematocrit Study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using venous whole blood
samples with hematocrit levels of 25-60% (25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55 and 60%) at four
levels of glucose (50 – 100, 111-150, 151-250, and 251-400 md/dL). Each sample was
tested in replicates of ten using two meters and three test strip lots. Results from the meter
were compared to results obtained using a laboratory-based comparator measurement (YSI
2300 analyzer). The evaluation of bias and percent bias relative to values obtained on the YSI
2300 analyzer demonstrate acceptable performance across the claimed hematocrit range of
30-55%.
3. Altitude Study:
The effect of altitude was evaluated using blood samples spiked to four glucose levels
(50-110, 111-150, 151-250, and 251-400 mg/dL). The samples were tested at 340 –
10,010 feet above sea level. Results obtained were compared with those obtained with the
comparator method (YSI 2300). The results demonstrate acceptable bias to the
comparator to support the claims in the labeling at altitudes up to 10,000 feet have no
significant effect on blood glucose measurements from the Confidence Blood Glucose
Monitoring System.
4. Operating Conditions:
The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous blood samples with
three glucose levels (50-110, 111-150, 151-300). Temperatures ranging from 41°F - 104°F
(5-40°C) and relative humidity from 10% to 85% were tested. Meter results were compared
11

--- Page 12 ---
to the YSI 2300 comparator analyzer. Four temperature and humidity combinations were
tested including low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high
temperature/low humidity and high temperature/high humidity. The results support the
claims in the labeling that the system can be used in conditions of 43°F - 104°F (5-40°C)
with relative humidity of 10 to 85%.
5. Infection Control and Robustness Studies:
The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies
were performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing
laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the
chosen disinfectant, EPA Certified Germicidal Disposable Cloth (PDI® SUPER SANI-
CLOTH®), EPA Reg. No.: 9480-4 (PN1000617). Robustness studies were also
performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or
external materials of the meter after 200 cleaning and disinfection cycles. The robustness
studies support 3 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
6. EMC Testing:
The sponsor provided appropriate documentation certifying that electromagnetic (EMC)
testing was performed and the Confidence Blood Glucose Monitoring System was found to
be compliant.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
