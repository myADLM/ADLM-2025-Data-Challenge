H. Intended Use:
1. Intended Use:
LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay uses chemiluminescence immunoassay
(CLIA) technology for the in vitro quantitative determination of Procalcitonin in
human serum and lithium heparin plasma specimens. Used in conjunction with
other laboratory findings and clinical assessments, LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II
GEN is intended for use as follows:
• to aid in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of ICU
admission for progression to severe sepsis and septic shock,
• to aid in assessing the cumulative 28-day risk of all-cause mortality for
patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock in the ICU or when
obtained in the emergency department or other medical wards prior to ICU
admission, using a change in PCT level over time.
• to aid in decision making on antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected
or confirmed lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) defined as
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute bronchitis, and acute
exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) – in an
inpatient setting or an emergency department,
• to aid in decision making on antibiotic discontinuation for patients with
suspected or confirmed sepsis.
The LIAISON Control BRAHMS PCT (level 1 and level 2) are intended for use as
assayed quality control samples to monitor the performance and reliability of the
LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay. The performance characteristics of
LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN controls have not been established with any
other assay or instrument platform different from the LIAISON Analyzer.
The LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN calibration verifiers (four levels) are
assayed quality control materials intended in the quantitative verification of
calibration and reportable range of the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay.
The performance characteristics of LIAISON BRAHMS PCT® II GEN calibration
verifiers have not been established in connection with any other assay or instrument
platforms different from the LIAISON Analyzer.

2. Indications for use(s):
Same as Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For in vitro diagnostic use only
For prescription use only
4. Warnings and Precautions:
• LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN ASSAY is not indicated to be used as a
stand-alone diagnostic assay and should be used in conjunction with clinical
signs and symptoms of infection and other diagnostic evidence.
• Decisions regarding antibiotic therapy should NOT be based solely on
procalcitonin concentrations.
• PCT results should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical status
of the patient and other laboratory results. Changes in PCT levels for the
prediction of mortality, and overall mortality, are strongly dependent on
many factors, including pre-existing patient risk factors and clinical course.
• The need to continue ICU care at Day 4 and other covariates (e.g., age and
SOFA score) are also significant predictors of 28-day cumulative mortality
risk.
• Certain patient characteristics, such as severity of renal failure or
insufficiency, may influence procalcitonin values and should be considered
as potentially confounding clinical factors when interpreting PCT values.
• Increased PCT levels may be observed in severe illness such as polytrauma,
burns, major surgery, prolonged or cardiogenic shock.
• PCT levels may not be elevated in patients infected by certain atypical
pathogens, such as Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
• The safety and performance of PCT-guided therapy for individuals younger
than age 17 years, pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals or
those on immunomodulatory agents, was not formally analyzed in the
supportive clinical trials.
5. Special instrument requirements:
The submission demonstrates performance on the LIAISON Analyzer (Model
15970).
I. Device Description:
The method for the quantitative determination of PCT is a sandwich chemiluminescence
immunoassay. A specific monoclonal antibody is coated on the magnetic particles (solid
phase); another monoclonal antibody (specific for a different epitope of the procalcitonin
3

--- Page 4 ---
molecule) is linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antibody conjugate). During the
first incubation, PCT present in calibrators, samples or controls binds to the antibody
conjugate. Then the solid phase is added to the reaction. A sandwich is formed only in the
presence of PCT molecules that bridge both antibodies. After the second incubation, the
unbound material is removed with a wash cycle.
Subsequently, the starter reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is thus
induced. The light signal, and hence the amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate, is
measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is indicative of PCT
concentration present in calibrators, samples or controls.
1. Reagents:
LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN is an in vitro diagnostic device consisting of two
reagents provided in individual compartments within a plastic container called the
Reagent Integral and two additional components provided in glass vials, separately

M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision:
A twenty-day precision study was performed internally at DiaSorin Inc. A panel
comprised of ten (10) frozen serum samples spanning the assay range was prepared by
DiaSorin. One (1) lot of LIAISON Control BRAHMS PCT II GEN (2 levels) and one
(1) lot of LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN verifiers (4 levels) were also tested in the
study. Studies were performed in accordance with CLSI guideline EP5-A3,
“Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods”.
The precision panel samples, kit controls and verifiers were tested on two (2) lots of
LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN in two (2) replicates per run, two (2) runs per day
for 20 operating days on one (1) LIAISON Analyzer with multiple operators.
Analysis of the total level of precision across lots demonstrated by the LIAISON
BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay for the kit controls ranged from 6.1 – 6.5%, the verifiers
(CVA-D) ranged from 5.5 – 8.7%, and the serum sample set ranged from 5.5 17.1%.

c. Linearity/Assay Reportable Range:
Linearity:
Linearity of the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay was assessed according to
CLSI guideline EP6-A, “Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement
Procedures”. The linearity was performed on one (1) LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II
GEN assay lot using a high patient-specimen pool (above 250 ng/mL) of each sample
type (serum, lithium heparin plasma). Samples were spiked with PCT or used neat to
achieve a level slightly above the upper end of the assay’s measuring range of 100
ng/mL. The samples were then diluted into 13 evenly spaced intervals to reach the
minimum doses below the lower limit of reading range (0.05 ng/mL – LoQ). Dilutions
were performed in LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN Control Diluent. Each sample
was tested in three (3) replicates in random sequence. The results were analyzed by %

LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN Calibration Verifiers:
LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN Verifiers are assayed quality control
materials intended for the quantitative verification of calibration and reportable
range of the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay.
The four levels of calibration verifiers (A-D) are intended to span the assay
range of the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay. The target concentrations
for each lot of calibration verifiers are assigned at DiaSorin by testing several
replicates of each concentration in multiple runs, on multiple instruments using
multiple lots of LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay integrals and controls.
Concentrations and ranges assigned by DiaSorin to each Calibration Verifier are
provided on a Certificate of Analysis.

iii. Stability:
Reagent Stability: Real-Time Shelf Life:
In the real-time, shelf-life stability study, the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN
was stored at 2–8°C at predetermined intervals. The stored assay was tested at
time point 0 (at manufacture), 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 19, 21, 24, 25 and 26
months (up to the planned shelf life plus one month) using three (3) assay lots.
The LIAISON Control BRAHMS PCT II GEN and QC panel samples were
tested in singlicate. The average recovery value was calculated as percent
recovery compared to the assigned PCT values.
Testing demonstrated that the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay reagents
are stable for 24 months at 2–8°C based on real-time stability data.
Calibration Stability Testing:
Calibrator stability for the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay was
evaluated using QC panel samples and kit controls tested in singlicate. The
opened Reagent Integrals were evaluated at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 weeks.
Results were generated using the initial (time zero) assay calibration.
Testing demonstrated that the calibration of the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II
GEN is stable for at least 8 weeks when the integral is properly stored on-board
the analyzer.
Stability of Reconstituted Calibrators – Freeze/Thaw Cycles:
A study was performed to assess stability of the reconstituted LIAISON
BRAHMS PCT II GEN calibrators by simulating normal condition of use as
specified in the Instructions for Use (i.e. repeated freeze-thaw between
successive tests). Reconstituted calibrators were pooled, then frozen and tested
after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 freeze/thaw cycles. After each freeze/thaw cycle the frozen
calibrators were used to calibrate the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay.
The time zero assay was calibrated with freshly reconstituted (unfrozen)
calibrators. At each test point kit controls and QC panel samples were tested in
duplicate and doses calculated.
The resulting data supports that after reconstitution; calibrators of the LIAISON
BRAHMS PCT II GEN can be frozen and thawed up to 4 times. In the
Instructions for Use a maximum of three freeze-thaw cycles for calibrators will
be allowed, corresponding to four calibrations (maximum number of
calibrations allowed with the volume/vial available after reconstitution).
Stability of Reconstituted Calibrators – Frozen Storage:
15

--- Page 16 ---
A study was performed to assess stability of the reconstituted LIAISON
BRAHMS PCT II GEN calibrators by simulating normal condition of use as
specified in the Instructions for Use (i.e. stored frozen between two successive
tests). Calibrators of both levels were opened at time zero, reconstituted, pooled,
and divided into aliquots in order to cover the whole study. One (1) aliquot was
used for testing at time zero, the other aliquots were frozen and tested after 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 weeks. At each test point, the LIAISON
PCT II GEN Reagent Integral was calibrated using a frozen calibrator aliquot.
QC panel samples and freshly opened kit controls were run and doses
calculated.
The resulting data supports the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay
package-insert claim of calibration is stable when stored frozen for 12 weeks.
In Use Reagent Integral – Open/On Board Stability:
Reagent on-board stability for the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay was
assessed by simulating normal condition of use as specified in the Instructions
for Use (i.e. storage on board the analyzers between two successive tests). Test
was calibrated; kit controls and QC panel samples were tested. The Reagent
Integrals were then stored on board the analyzer in the reagent bay area. Kit
performance using the opened Reagent Integrals was evaluated weekly through
13 weeks. Results were generated using the initial (time zero) assay calibration.
The resulting data support the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay package-
insert claim of that the Reagent Integral is stable for at least 12 weeks when
stored open/on board analyzer.
Kit Control Long Term Stability:
The long-term stability of the LIAISON Control BRAHMS PCT II GEN was
assessed with three (3) lots of LIAISON Control BRAHMS PCT II GEN stored
at 2-8°C with three (3) lots of LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assays. Kit
Controls were tested opened at each time point with a freshly opened and
calibrated Reagent Integral. Tests were performed with a fixed frequency for the
entire period through 25 months to guarantee adequate confidence and in order
to have data supporting the assignment of a 24 month expiration date.
The resulting data supports the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay
package-insert claim that the LIAISON Control BRAHMS PCT II GEN is
stable for 24 months when stored 2-8oC.
Stability of Reconstituted Kit Controls – Freeze/Thaw Cycles:
A study was performed to assess stability of the reconstituted LIAISON Control
16

--- Page 17 ---
BRAHMS PCT II GEN by simulating normal condition of use as specified in
the Instructions for Use (i.e. repeated freeze-thaw between two successive tests).
Reconstituted controls were pooled, then frozen and tested after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, and 8 freeze/thaw cycles.
The resulting data supports that the LIAISON Control BRAHMS PCT II GEN
can be thawed up to 7 times.
Stability of Reconstituted Controls – Frozen Storage
A study was performed to assess stability of the reconstituted LIAISON Control
BRAHMS PCT II GEN by simulating normal condition of use as specified in
the Instructions for Use (i.e. stored frozen between two successive tests).
Controls were opened at time zero, reconstituted, pooled, and divided into
aliquots in order to cover the whole study. One aliquot was used for testing at
time zero, the other aliquots were frozen and tested after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12,13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 weeks.
The resulting data demonstrated that the LIAISON Control BRAHMS PCT II
GEN is stable for at least 18 weeks when stored frozen after reconstitution. In
the Instructions for Use a maximum of 8 weeks storage will be reported for
reconstituted Controls when stored frozen.
Diluent Open Stability:
A study was performed to assess stability of the opened diluent vials by
simulating normal condition of use as specified in the Instructions for Use (i.e.
in the refrigerator between two successive tests) in order to estimate the time
within which it can be used as a diluent for controls and as a diluent for out of
range samples. Three (3) lots of diluent were opened and tested at time zero and
then stored at 2-8°C. At 3 and 5 months the diluent was used for the
reconstitution of the kit controls. Reconstituted controls at each time point were
tested on a freshly opened integral in parallel with controls reconstituted with a
freshly open diluent (Reference Condition).
The resulting data demonstrates that the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN
diluent provided with the LIASON Control BRAHMS PCT II Gen is stable for
at least 3 months after opening, when properly stored at 2-8oC. In the
Instructions for Use, a maximum of 3 months storage will be reported for open
diluent.
iv. Reference Interval (Expected values/Reference Range):
To establish the reference interval of normal population for LIAISON
BRAHMS PCT II GEN Assay, serum samples from 120 apparently healthy

g. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ):
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay was
determined according to CLSI guideline EP17-A2, “Protocol for Determination of
Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation”. The LoQ was calculated based on
intermediate precision according to CLSI EP17-A2. The LoQ was determined as the
lowest concentration of analyte that can be quantified with an intermediate precision
of no more than 20%.
Nine (9) samples (4 of which were used in the LoD determination) with the remaining
samples were set slightly below the LoB mean detection level and slightly above the
estimated LoQ (used for LoQ calculations). Each of the samples were tested on two
(2) LIAISON instruments with two (2) reagent kit lots by two (2) technicians, testing
samples over four (4) runs and three (3) days, three (3) replicates per sample per run,
twelve (12) results per sample to define LoQ. A third lot was tested to verify the LoQ
result.
The LoQ was determined to be 0.04 ng/mL. The LoQ claim for the LIAISON
BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay is 0.05 ng/mL.
The Limit of Quantitation LOQ expressed as dose with %Bias < 5%, %CV < 15% and
%Total error < 30% is 0.05 ng/mL.

mouse antibody) may interfere with LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN results.
HAMA and RF (Rheumatoid Factor) interference was assessed by testing one sample
obtained by a pool of two high HAMA samples (mean HAMA level 658 ng/mL) and
one sample at high RF level (2,800 IU/mL) plus LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II Gen
Diluent (serum PCT free). A suitable HAMA/RF serum sample was spiked with PCT
analyte at multiple concentrations covering the clinically relevant range and was tested
in 26 replicates.
There was no HAMA/RF interference observed for PCT analyte with the presence of
HAMA at 658 ng/mL and RF at 2,800 IU/mL.
j. High-Dose Hook Effect:
There is no high-dose hook effect at PCT concentrations up to 2,000 ng/mL PCT.
k. Spike and Recovery Effects:
A spike and recovery study was performed by using four (4) samples at low analyte
concentrations spiked with known amount PCT levels to reach four concentrations
(0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 2 ng/mL) and assayed. Percent recoveries were determined between
obtained and expected concentrations.
% Recovery for each spiked sample was between 90-110%.
l. Analyte Carry-over:
A study was performed to access the carry-over of the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II
Gen assay by testing a series of alternating high, low and negative samples. Carryover
testing was performed with a set of three (3) spiked samples. The set consisted of a
sample with no PCT, a low PCT level (0.1ng/mL) and a high PCT level sample (4000
ng/mL).
No carry over observed was observed in the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay.
m. Drift Effect:
The drift effect is defined as the change in measurement value over time due to
factors other than the concentration of the analyte which can be caused by delays in
performing test steps such as dispensing of samples or one or more reagents with
consequent different reaction times was assessed with the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT
II GEN assay.
Six (6) samples and/or controls distributed across the measuring range of the assay (2
low, 2 middle, 2 high, or 2 near the medical decision level) were analyzed in six (6)
replicates in each of two (2) runs for a total of 12 runs.
24

--- Page 25 ---
Results demonstrated no observed drift effect in the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II
GEN assay.
a. Assay Cut-off:
28-day mortality:
• ΔPCT ≤ 80%
A decrease in the PCT levels below or equal to 80% defines a positive ΔPCT
test result representing a higher risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients
diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock.
• ΔPCT > 80%
A decrease in the PCT levels of more than 80% defines a negative ΔPCT test
result representing a lower risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients
diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock.
NOTE: The combination of the first PCT level (≤ 2.0 ng/mL or > 2.0 ng/mL) at initial
diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock with the patient’s clinical course and the
change in PCT level over time until Day 4 provides important additional information
about the mortality risk.
Progression Risk:
• PCT > 2 μg/L
A PCT level above 2.0μg/L on the first day of ICU admission is associated
with a high risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.
• PCT < 0.5 μg/L
A PCT level below 0.5μg/L on the first day of ICU admission is associated
with a low risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.
LRTI Antibiotic Decision Making:
• PCT < 0.10 ng/mL
Antibiotic therapy strongly discouraged.
• PCT 0.10-0.25 ng/mL
Antibiotic therapy discouraged.
• PCT 0.26-0.50 ng/mL
Antibiotic therapy encouraged.
• PCT >0.50 ng/mL
Antibiotic therapy strongly encouraged.
Sepsis Antibiotic Discontinuation:
• ΔPCT > 80%
25

--- Page 26 ---
Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued
• PCT ≤ 0.50 ng/mL
Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued
Recommendations for Laboratory Reports for Initiation and Discontinuation:
The Change in Procalcitonin Calculator is available at www.BRAHMS-PCT-
Calculator.com. The Change in Procalcitonin Calculator can be used to determine
ΔPCT results. It is suggested to report the numerical PCT values (individual or
paired). For paired PCT values the report should also indicate if the ΔPCT (%) was ≤
80% or > 80%. The laboratory report should include a reference or a link to the
package insert for a guided interpretation of the test results.
n. Specimen Stability:
Sample Stability at 2-8oC:
A study was performed to evaluate LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay’s ability
to generate analogous results when using fresh and stored samples. Five (5) samples at
different analyte levels, four of them at the clinical decision points (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 2
ng/mL) and one near the assay range (around 70 ng/mL) were evaluated for the effect
of storage at 2-8°C. Each sample was divided into aliquots, one (1) aliquot was tested
in duplicate fresh, and the rest of the aliquots were stored at 2-8°C. The aliquots were
tested at their specified time points in duplicate after 24 and 25 hours at 2-
8°C.Recovery compared to the reference value was calculated as either deviation (in
ng/mL) or as percent recovery
Studies demonstrated that serum samples and Lithium Heparin Plasma specimens are
stable for 24 hours at 2-8°C.
Sample Stability at 15-25oC:
A study was performed to evaluate LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay’s ability
to generate analogous results when using fresh and stored samples. Five (5) samples at
different analyte levels, four (4) of them at the clinical decision points (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 2
ng/mL) and one (1) along the assay range (around 70 ng/mL) were used. Each sample
was divided into aliquots, one (1) aliquot was tested in duplicate fresh, and the rest of
the aliquots were stored at room temperature. The aliquots were tested at their
specified time points in duplicate. Each sample was tested fresh and after 24 and 25
hours at 2-8°C. Recovery compared to the reference value was calculated as either
deviation (in ng/mL) or as percent recovery.
Studies demonstrated that serum samples and Lithium Heparin Plasma specimens are
stable for 24 hours at room temperature.
Sample Stability at -20oC:
26

--- Page 27 ---
A study was performed to evaluate LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay’s ability
to generate analogous results when using fresh and stored samples. Sixty-five samples
for each matrix (serum and lithium heparin) were tested. Samples were spiked with
recombinant procalcitonin in order to contrive samples with analyte levels close to the
cut off(s). Each sample was divided into six (6) aliquots and were tested fresh and
after storage at -20°C or below for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 months. The aliquots were tested at
their specified time points in triplicate. Recovery compared to the reference value was
calculated as either deviation (in ng/mL) or as percent recovery
Studies demonstrated that serum samples and Lithium Heparin Plasma specimens are
stable for three months at −20°C.
Additional sample stability studies were performed on the MOSES clinical samples as
described in DEN150009.
Sample Stability (Freeze/Thaw Cycles) Study:
Sample Stability (Freeze/Thaw Cycles) was assessed by comparing the measurement
of six (6) PCT samples distributed across the assay range, with four (4) samples close
to the medical decision points (0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 2 ng/mL). Each fresh sample was
divided into four (4) aliquots, frozen and subjected to six (6) freeze/thaw cycles and
was tested in duplicate.
Recovery compared to the reference value was calculated as either deviation (in
ng/mL) or as percent recovery
Studies demonstrated that samples are stable through five (5) freeze/thaw cycles.
o. Matrix Equivalence Study:
Lithium-Heparin Plasma-Versus-Serum Comparison:
The effect on quantitation of PCT in the presence of lithium-heparin anticoagulant was
determined by comparing values obtained from human samples drawn into Serum and
Li-Heparin plasma primary tubes. Forty Serum/Li-Heparin plasma matched patient
samples were collected spanning the full assay measuring range. Spiked or diluted
samples were used in order to span the assay range. Paired samples were tested in
triplicate in the same run using one (1) reagent lot and one (1) analyzer in order to
exclude the effects of other variables on the results. Potential effects were assessed by
Passing/Bablok regression analysis.
The results show no statistically significant difference between the Serum/Li-Heparin
samples, thus supporting the package-insert claim that Li-Heparin plasma is an
acceptable sample type for use with the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay.
27

--- Page 28 ---
2. Method Comparison:
A quantitative method comparison study was performed on 349 serum samples and 20
lithium heparin plasma samples for a total of 369 samples following CLSI EP09-A2.
Of the 369 samples, one hundred four (104) samples were not included in the analysis
because they read <0.05 ng/mL which is below the reading range of either or both
assays and one (1) sample read > 100 ng/mL on the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN
assay and therefore was also removed from the analysis. The PCT sample results
ranged from 0.05 ng/mL to 131 ng/mL.
Results for the VIDAS BRAHMS PCT assay and the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II
GEN assay were plotted. Passing Bablok and Weighted Deming regression analyses
including slope and intercept with 95% CI were calculated for all 264 samples that
read across the measuring range of the assays. The results are summarized in the
following graphs and tables.
Passing and Bablok Regression Results (n=264):
Passing and Bablok regression analysis was applied to the results across the range of the
LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay yielding agreement of y = 1.03x + 0.06. The 95%
confidence intervals for the slope were 1.01 to 1.05 and the 95% confidence intervals for the
intercept 0.04 to 0.07 ng/mL.

Weighted Deming Results (n=264): Weighted Deming analysis was applied to the results
across the range of the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay yielding agreement of y =
1.07x + 0.03. The 95% confidence intervals for the slope were 1.03 to 1.11 and the 95%
confidence intervals for the intercept 0.02 to 0.05 ng/mL.

A qualitative method comparison study was also performed on the 369 samples
mentioned above. The samples were tested on the LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN
assay at two (2) laboratories and internally at DiaSorin. The samples were tested by
the VIDAS BRAHMS PCT assay at an external reference laboratory. Results for the

2. Specimen Identification:
A barcode reader reads the barcodes on each tube for positive identification.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
See Sample Stability (M.1.k) above.
5. Calibration:
LIAISON BRAHMS PCT II GEN assay generates a continuous response (relative light
units, RLU) which is used in sample grading to provide a reportable quantitative result.
Sample grading is based on the use of a calibration curve referenced to an ‘In-house’
Recombinant Human PCT standard preparation and controlled by the use of two
lyophilized calibrators (Calibrator A and Calibrator B) provided in the kit together with
the Reagent Integral.
The calibrators are assayed by the user to transform the kit lot specific Master Curve into
a Working Curve. The Master Curves are stored on the LIAISON Analyzer and
specifically matched to the kit in use via the instructions encoded in the bar codes printed
on the Reagent Integral label. Each Master Curve is generated by a mathematical
elaboration of the data resulting from multiple testing (at least ten runs) of an internal
Reference Calibration Curve. During user calibration, the Calibrator results are used to
create a Working Curve by mathematical adjustment of the Master Curve. The Working
Curve is then used to calculate sample results.
The analyzer is calibrated in triplicate whenever at least one of the following conditions
occurs (see LIAISON Analyzer Operator’s manual):
• A new lot of Reagent Integral or a new lot of Starter Kit is used.
• The previous calibration was performed more than eight weeks before.
• The analyzer has been serviced.
• Control values lie outside the expected ranges.
6. Quality Control:
See “Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (controls, calibrators, or methods)” Section
(M.1.d) above.
