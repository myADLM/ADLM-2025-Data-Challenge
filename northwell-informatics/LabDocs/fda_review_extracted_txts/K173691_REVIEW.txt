H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Sofia Lyme FIA employs immunofluorescence for the rapid differential detection of
human IgM and IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi from serum and plasma
specimens from patients suspected of B. burgdorferi infection. This qualitative test is
intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of Lyme disease. A negative result does not
preclude infection with B. burgdorferi. All positive results for IgM and/or IgG should be
further tested by a corresponding second-tier western blot assay. Test results are to be
used in conjunction with information obtained from the patient’s clinical evaluation and
other diagnostic procedures.
The Sofia Lyme FIA may be used with Sofia or Sofia 2.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use(s)
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Not Applicable (N/A)
4. Special instrument requirements:
Sofia 2 Instrument
I. Device Description:
The Sofia Lyme FIA is an immunofluorescence-based, lateral flow assay for detection of
IgM and/or IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in patient specimens. Reagents for the
assay are ready-to-use and provided in the kit.
The assay uses a bidirectional test strip format to detect both IgM and IgG antibodies to B.
burgdorferi. One side of the test strip detects IgM antibodies to B. burgdorferi and the other
side of the test strip detects IgG antibodies to B. burgdorferi.
To perform the test, a patient serum or plasma specimen is obtained and added to a pre-filled
vial containing the Lyme running buffer. The diluted sample is then pipetted into the round
sample port in the center of the Test Cassette.
The Test Cassette is loaded into Sofia 2 in either the READ NOW Mode or WALK AWAY
Mode. In READ NOW Mode, the user allows the cassette to develop on the countertop for
10 minutes. In WALK AWAY Mode, the user immediately after adding the specimen to the
2

--- Page 3 ---
cassette, the cassette is inserted into Sofia 2. Sofia 2 will analyze the test strip at 3, 5, 8, and
10 minutes until both IgM and IgG positive results are received. This feature allows for
earlier read times.
Each Sofia Lyme FIA kit will contain one Positive and one Negative Control—each provided
in separate dropper bottles. The Positive QC control is formulated with patient Lyme IgM
and IgG positive plasma diluted into 1X PBS, and 0.3% Microcide is added to the solution as
an antimicrobial. The Negative QC control is formulated with patient negative serum diluted
into 1X PBS and 0.3% Microcide is added to the solution as an antimicrobial. External
Controls will be tested by adding 2 drops to the test cassette.

b. Method comparison with original Sofia
The performance of Sofia Lyme FIA when used with Sofia vs. Sofia 2 was compared
using a panel of plasma samples at one Quidel site. Panel members were prepared so
that a broad range of negative and positive samples were evenly distributed across the
dynamic range of the assay, including negative and high negative samples and low,
moderate, and high positive samples. The Sofia vs. Sofia 2 comparison results for
IgM and IgG are shown below in Tables 11 and 12 respectively.
