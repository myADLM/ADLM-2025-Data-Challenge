L. Test Principle:
Anti-tryptase, covalently coupled to ImmunoCAP, reacts with tryptase in the patient sample.
After washing, enzyme labeled antibodies against tryptase are added to form a complex.
After incubation, unbound enzyme-anti-tryptase is washed away and the bound complex is
then incubated with a developing agent. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence of the
eluate is measured. The higher the response value, the more tryptase is present in the sample.
To evaluate the test results, the responses of the patient samples are transformed into
concentrations with the use of a calibration curve.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
There is no internal standard for tryptase. ImmunoCAP Tryptase calibrators and
ImmunoCAP Tryptase Curve Control is prepared from recombinant tryptase protein.
The recombinant tryptase is expressed in Sf9 insect cells infected with recombinant
baculovirus coding for mast-cell tryptase. The original reference standard was
produced in-house. New in-house reference standard is produced from the stock
solutions approximately every 3rd year. Each subsequent lot is standardized against
the original reference standard.
Stability
Calibrator stability: Calibrator stability was evaluated using three different lots. For
the calibrator strip, one lot of ImmunoCAP Tryptase Calibrator strip was first
transport simulated and then stored at 32ºC for 28 days to evaluate on-board reagent
stability. Following this, time zero measurement with two additional calibroator lots
were performed. All three calibrator lots were stored at 2°–8°C. The three lots were
tested at five different test occasions up to 25 months. The results support an on-
board stability claim of 28 days and a real-time stability claim of 25 months when
calibrators are stored at 2–8ºC.
Conjugate Stability: To simulate transport stability, one lot of ImmunoCAP Tryptase
Conjugate 50 was stored at 32ºC for one week. During this time the conjugates were
moved to 2–8ºC twice for 18–24 hours and moved once to −20ºC for 2–3 hours.
Following transport simulation, the conjugate was left on board for 4 days at 2–8ºC,
and were recapped every night. After the initial time zero measurements, all three lots
were stored at 2–8ºC and stability was measured at four additional time points up to
25 months. The results support an onboard stability claim of four days when stored on
the Phadia 250, and real-time stability claim of 25 months when stored at 2-8ºC.
d. Detection limit:
The LoB was determined using five tryptase free serum sample. Samples were tested
in replicates of four, in three separate runs, during three days, with two different lots
of reagents (ImmunoCAP Tryptase Conjugate, ImmunoCAP, Tryptase Calibrators
and ImmunoCAP Tryptase Anti-Tryptase) for a total 60 blank determinations. The
LoB was estimated from Relative Units (RU) as the maximum value for reagent lot-
specific LoB estimates. The LoB was determined to be less than 1 µg/L.
The LoD was determined by measuring five low positive samples ranging from LoB
to 5x LoB. Also, the lowest tryptase calibrator (1 µg/L) was assayed as a sample.
Each sample was assayed in replicates of four, in three separate runs, for three days,
with two different lots of reagents (ImmunoCAP Tryptase Conjugate, ImmunoCAP
Tryptase Calibrators and ImmunoCAP Tryptase Anti-Tryptase) for a total of 60 low
8

--- Page 9 ---
positive determinations. Calculation of LoD was made on Response Units (RU)
because no tryptase concentrations are calculated below the lowest calibrator. The
LoD was determined to be less than 1 µg/L (1µg/L is the lowest calibrator in the kit).
The data is presented in the table below:

e. Analytical specificity:
Studies were performed in alignment with CLSI EP07-A2: Interference Testing in
Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline ‐ Second Edition. Three serum samples with
different concentrations of tryptase; approximately 4 μg/L, 18 μg/L and 140 μg/L
were used. Serum samples were spiked with five different concentrations of
potentially interfering substances. Bilirubin F (up to 19.4 mg/dl), Bilirubin C (up to
20.3 mg/dl), Hemoglobin (up to 490 mg/dl), Chyle (up to 7160 FTU), Rheumatoid
Factor (up to 500 IU/ml), and Heparin (up to 75 U/ml) were used to spike serum
samples. For reference, the serum samples were diluted with the same volume of
buffer solution (unspiked). For Heparin, the untreated serum samples were used as
reference (unspiked). The samples were analyzed in 3 replicates in one assay run. No
significant interference at the tested levels was observed.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off of 20 μg/L of tryptase is internationally recognized and is designated by
the World Health Organization (WHO) as a minor criterion in the diagnosis of
systemic mastocytosis. The WHO classification for systemic mastocytosis is
described in the “WHO classification of tumours of haematopoietic and lymphoid
tissues” published in 2008.
g. Hook-effect:
Hook effect was evaluated by comparing the response of a serum sample with a
tryptase concentration of 2000 μg/L with the response of the highest calibrator, which
is at concentration of 200 μg/L, and ensuring that the response level of the high
sample was clearly above the highest calibrator. The hook sample and the highest
calibrator were assayed in 24 replicates respectively in one assay run in the Phadia
100 and 250 instruments. No hook effect was observed.

Comparison between the updated ImmunoCAP Tryptase and predicate ImmunoCAP
Tryptase (K103039) was performed with 275 serum samples with tryptase levels
across the analytical measuring range of the the device. Passing-Bablock regression
analysis and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the intercept and slope were estimated

b. Instrument comparison between Phadia 100 and Phadia 250:
Conformity between the Phadia 250 and Phadia 100 instruments for the updated
ImmunoCAP Tryptase using 69 serum samples with tryptase concentrations covering
the measuring range. Samples were assayed in one replicate in two assay runs on
three different Phadia 100 and three different Phadia 250 instruments, for six
runs/instrument system. Passing-Bablok regression analysis was used to evaluate the
bias between tryptase measurements from both instruments. The results are presented
in the table below:

c. Matrix comparison:
Twenty-five patient samples containing different levels of tryptase ranging from
approximately 4 –190 μg/L, were used in the study. The matrices compared were:
serum, EDTA plasma, lithium heparin plasma and sodium heparin plasma. All
samples matrices from each patient were tested in replicates of two in one assay run.
Passing-Bablok regression analysis was used to analyze data. The results are
presented in the table below:

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
Clinical performance of the ImmunoCAP Tryptase assay was evaluated at two
independent sites:
Site 1:
The study was performed with samples collected from 84 patients with a suspicion of
mastocytosis. 77 subjects were adults ( >22 years of age) and 7 subjects were
pediatric patients (<22 years of age). All patients were referred to the site due to a
suspicion of mastocytosis and other mast cell-related diseases on the basis of clinical
symptoms attributable to mast cell activation (MCA) including anaphylaxis. Patients
were classified with and without the WHO recommended fourth minor criterion of
tryptase levels persistently exceeding 20 μg/L.

Site 2:
The study was performed with samples from 54 patients with a suspicion of
mastocytosis. 42 subjects were adults (≥ 22 years of age) and 12 were pediatric patients
(< 22 years of age). All cases were consecutively referred due to the suspicion of
mastocytosis or mast cell activation syndrome based primarily on clinical symptoms
attributed to MCA, including anaphylaxis, a characteristic skin lesion or lesional skin
biopsy, a bone marrow biopsy or an elevated baseline serum tryptase level. Patients were
classified with and without the WHO recommended fourth minor criterion of tryptase
levels persistently exceeding 20 μg/L.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Serum samples from 163 healthy individuals between 1–68 years of age were analyzed in
duplicates on both the Phaida 100 and Phadia 250 instruments. Of these 70 were males
0–68 years of age (median age 29), and 93 were females 1-–68 years of age (median age
40). Pediatric samples (below the age of 22) comprised 68 individuals in the test
population, with an age range of 1–17 years (M=29 and F=39). The results are presented
in the table below:
