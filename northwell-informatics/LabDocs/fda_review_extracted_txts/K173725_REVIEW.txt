fully automated NeuMoDx 288 Molecular System, utilizes real-time PCR for the
amplification of GBS DNA where fluorogenic target-specific TaqMan probes allow for the
detection of the amplified GBS DNA.
The test system uses a combination of heat, lytic enzyme and extraction reagents to perform
cell lysis, DNA extraction and removal of inhibitors. No operator intervention is necessary
once the specimen is loaded onto the NeuMoDx System. After the test is processed, a
determination of the presence/absence of GBS DNA in the specimen is automatically made
based on the amplification status of GBS and SPC1 using pre-established cut-off criteria. A
list of reagents and consumables, including other equipment/materials required, is shown in
the package insert.

L. Test Principle:
Samples are fully processed on the NeuMoDx System using the NeuMoDx GBS Test Strip
reagents. After incubation of inoculated selective broth for 18-24 hours at 37 °C in ambient
air or 5% CO , an aliquot of the enriched Lim broth culture is mixed with lysis buffer to
2
begin lysis of the sample. The NeuMoDx System automatically extracts the target nucleic
acid and amplifies a section of the pcsB gene sequence of the GBS chromosome, if present.
Briefly, the released nucleic acids are captured by magnetic affinity microspheres. The
microspheres, with the bound nucleic acids, are loaded into the NeuMoDx Cartridge where
the unbound, non-DNA components are removed with NeuMoDx WASH Solution. The
bound DNA is eluted using NeuMoDx RELEASE Solution. The NeuMoDx System then uses
the released DNA to rehydrate dried assay reagents containing all the elements necessary for
amplification of the GBS-specific target. The dried PCR reagents also contain the
components required to amplify a section of the SPC1 sequence to enable simultaneous
amplification and detection of both target and control DNA sequences. After reconstitution
of the dried PCR reagents, the NeuMoDx System dispenses the prepared PCR-ready mixture
into one PCR chamber (per specimen) of the NeuMoDx Cartridge. Amplification and
detection of the control and target DNA sequences occur in PCR chamber. The chamber and
the cartridge are designed to contain the amplicon following real-time-PCR to reduce
contamination risk post-amplification. The NeuMoDx System monitors the fluorescent signal
emitted by the TaqMan probes at the end of each amplification cycle and presents the test
result. When amplification is complete, the NeuMoDx System analyzes the data and reports a
final result (POSITIVE / NEGATIVE / INDETERMINATE / UNRESOLVED). No operator
intervention is necessary once the specimen is loaded onto the NeuMoDx System.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision Study
A Precision Study was conducted to evaluate the within-site variability over 12 days
with three different NeuMoDx 288 Molecular instruments, two operators, and two
lots of reagents. Two runs per day were conducted on each instrument where panel
members were tested in triplicate. One GBS strain was used to prepare panel
members, which included a true negative, low negative (>100 fold dilution of 1X
LoD), moderate negative (>10 fold dilution of 1X LoD), low positive (1-2X LoD),
and moderate positive (3-4X LoD) sample. Panel members were prepared in pooled,
negative clinical remnant Lim broth specimens. For each run performed, a positive
and negative external control were processed in addition to the panel samples. A total
of 72 runs and 1224 tests were performed for the study (including the external
controls). The percent agreement with the expected result for low positive, moderate
positive, and true negative samples was >95%. As shown in Table 1, the positive
rates for the low negative and moderate negative samples were reported as 1.4% and
17.6%, respectively. Table 2 is a summary of the coefficient of variance (%CV) and
standard deviation (SD) for Ct values. All values met acceptance criteria for the
study.

Reproducibility Study
The reproducibility of the NeuMoDx GBS Assay was evaluated by testing the assay
on three NeuMoDx 288 Molecular instruments with one operator at each of the three
sites (one internal, two-external sites) for five days. A blinded reproducibility panel
was prepared from one GBS strain in negative clinical Lim broth matrix and tested in
replicates of five at different concentrations. A true negative sample was also
included as a panel member. Across three sites, a total of 75 replicates were tested per
panel member with the NeuMoDx GBS Assay. The overall percent agreement with
the expected result (i.e. negative for true negative and positive for moderate positive
and low positive samples) was >95% for GBS samples tested at low positive and
moderate positive concentrations. The true negatives yielded expected results 100%
of the time. A total of (4) Indeterminates were observed for an initial rate of 1.3%.
Two samples yielded a valid result upon repeat testing. The remaining two samples
yielded an Indeterminate result a second time before a valid result was obtained for
the two samples. No Unresolved samples were reported in this study. The results
from the site-to-site Reproducibility Study for the NeuMoDx GBS Assay are
presented in Table 3 below. Also as part of this study, there were 30 sets of GBS
external control samples tested. All controls were valid and produced the expected
results.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls
For the studies conducted, the positive external control was prepared from
AcroMetrix’s GBS Positive Control added to commercially sourced Lim broth at a
concentration determined to yield an average Ct value of between 27 – 29. Lim broth
was used for the negative external control.
A total of 65 external positive/negative control tests were processed on the NeuMoDx
System during the GBS clinical study. Only one Indeterminate was reported, which
when repeated, gave a valid correct result. One positive/negative set was excluded
due to the use of expired consumables. All remaining external controls gave the
expected results.
Reagent Stability
Stability studies were performed to assess the in-use stability of reagents and the
shelf-life of the packaged NeuMoDx GBS test strips and Lysis Buffer 4.
• In Use Stability
Wash solution, release solution, GBS Test Strips, and extraction plates were
stored (~236 days) according to real-time stability study protocol and tested at
various time points (Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, and Day 32) at different
temperatures (-20°C, ambient temperature, or 28°C). Overall testing was
performed with two lots of reagents, 3 primary storage conditions, and 4 time
points where 624 samples in total were tested in the study. At time 0 (after ~236
day storage), reagents stored under the primary conditions of -20°C, ambient
temperature, and 28°C over 6 months exhibited a GBS positivity rate of 100%,
98.7%, and 100%, respectively, for positive samples. After removing from their
primary storage conditions and aged under the simulated in-use condition for 32
days, the GBS positive rate for positive samples from all groups was 100%. All
negative samples generated the expected results at time 0 and after 32 days. Only
three Indeterminates were generated during the course of the study.
A similar study with conducted with Lysis Buffer 4. The goal was to determine
the in-use shelf life of Lysis Buffer 4 which had been aged for 6 months (time
points 15, 22, 29 days tested). Overall, these results showed each storage
temperature group after 29 days in-use storage had GBS positive detection rates
of 100% with no difference in positive detection rate between time 0 and 29 day.
One Unresolved result was reported during the study. The in-use stability of Lysis
Buffer 4 met the acceptance criteria as reported by NeuMoDx for the test system.

--- Page 9 ---
• Real-Time Shelf Life
Wash solution, release solution, GBS Test Strips, and extraction plates were
stored (~236 days) according to real-time stability study protocol. Briefly, 27
Positive Samples, and 3 Negative Samples were processed using the
aforementioned GBS reagents stored either at -20°C, ambient temperature, or
28°C. The -20°C set served as the t=0 control and was the standard against which
the ambient temperature set and 28°C set were compared. Ninety samples per
storage condition were tested with 270 samples in total across all 3 storage
conditions. The GBS positive samples contained GBS at 1000 CFU/ml in Lim
broth, while the negative samples consisted of commercial Lim broth. Three
Indeterminate results were reported. The results showed a 100% GBS positive
rate for the -20°C and 28°C storage condition. At ambient temperature, a 98.7%
positive rate was reported with one false negative. This met the acceptance
criteria as reported by NeuMoDx. These reagents were determined to have a
minimum 7 month stability for the NeuMoDx 288 Molecular System. In a
separate study, Lysis Buffer 4 was determined to have a minimum 6-month
stability for GBS DNA extractions (only one Unresolved reported at -20°C as
reported by NeuMoDx for the test system).
• On-Board Specimen Stability
A Specimen Stability Study was performed to provide evidence for the stability of
the enriched Lim broth specimens once on-board the instrument. A set of 23 GBS
positive and 23 negative clinical samples with different collection dates was
tested, then left on the worktable for 24 hours before re-testing with the
NeuMoDx GBS Assay. All 23 GBS negative samples gave negative results at
both t=0 and t=24 time points, resulting in 100% concordance between the two
testing time points for GBS negative samples. At t=0, all 23 GBS positive
samples gave positive results. However, at t=24 time point, one GBS positive
sample returned a negative result (22/23 positive). According to NeuMoDx, the
reference laboratory confirmed the one sample had high Ct value (C > 33)
t
compared to other samples and no growth in culture.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection Determination
A Limit of Detection (LoD) study was performed to evaluate the analytical sensitivity
of the NeuMoDx GBS Assay using one representative strain of GBS (ATCC BAA-
611, Serotype V). Preliminary LoD concentrations were determined by diluting the
strain to five levels in five independent clinical negative pools. For each
concentration level, 60 replicates were tested across two instruments. A unique lot of
NeuMoDx GBS Test Strips, extraction plates, and Lysis Buffer was tested on each
system. The LoD was determined to be 500 CFU/ml (Table 4).

(35/60) (53/60) (60/60) (60/60)
Analytical Reactivity
The analytical reactivity (inclusivity) of the NeuMoDx GBS Assay was evaluated
with a panel of 12 GBS strains covering 10 serotypes (Ia, Ib, II, III, Ic, IV, VI, VII,
VIII, IX), as well as one non-hemolytic and one clinical strain. Out of the twelve
strains, two GBS strains (serotypes Ia and Ib) did not yield a 100% detection rate at 1-
2X LoD (800 CFU/ml). Sample GBS strain concentrations for these two strains were
increased until all replicates were positive. Serotype Ia and Ib strains achieved 100%
positivity at 1500 CFU/ml and 1000 CFU/ml, respectively.
e. Analytical specificity (Cross-Reactivity):
A study was conducted with the NeuMoDx GBS Assay to determine the cross-
reactivity of 136 microorganisms (or nucleic acid) representing various non-GBS
groups of Streptococci, along with other bacteria, parasites, fungi, and viruses
normally common to the urogenital and digestive tract. Bacteria and yeasts were
tested at > 106 CFU/ml. Viruses and parasites were tested at the highest available
concentration. To simplify testing, pools were prepared with 5-6 organisms in
triplicate and spiked into negative GBS clinical matrix before testing with the
NeuMoDx GBS Assay. A total of 30 pools were evaluated that included a total of 116
bacteria, 12 viruses, and 7 fungi.
All pools showed negative results, except for Pool 1 and Pool 17. One (out of three
replicates) was positive for GBS in each pool. Therefore, organisms from these two
pools were tested in triplicate individually in negative GBS clinical matrix—
Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguinis,
Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Individually, none of the
organisms generated a positive result on the NeuMoDx GBS Assay. See Table 5 for a
list of organisms tested during the Cross-Reactivity Study.

f. Interfering Studies:
Microbial Interference
The impact of non-target organisms on the detection of GBS by the NeuMoDx GBS
Assay was assessed in a separate study. One strain of GBS (1200 CFU/ml, which is
2-3X LoD) was spiked into each pool of non-target organisms previously evaluated
during the Cross-Reactivity Study and prepared negative clinical Lim broth matrix.
Each pool was tested in triplicate. Only one replicate of Pool 17 gave a negative
result. Three new samples of Pool 17 were tested in the presence of GBS to confirm
results of initial testing. All 3 samples returned positive results after re-testing. The
results of the study suggest that the NeuMoDx GBS Assay can detect GBS in the
presence of high levels of non-target organisms associated with vaginal/rectal swab
specimens.
Interfering Substances (Endogenous/Exogenous Substances)
This study was conducted to evaluate the potential interference of a panel of 26
endogenous and exogenous substances with the NeuMoDx GBS Assay (Table 6).
Potentially interfering substances were added to pooled clinical negative Lim broth
samples containing either 1200 CFU/ml (2-3X LoD) or 4000 CFU/ml (8X LoD) of
GBS. Six samples yielded an Indeterminate result, but upon re-testing, produced valid
results. No interference with the detection of GBS was observed with the panel of
endogenous/exogenous substances. Results of the Interference Study are acceptable.

g. Carry-Over/Cross-Contamination
A Carry-Over and Cross Contamination Study for the NeuMoDx GBS Assay was
conducted to verify that no cross-contamination occurs on the test system with
alternating GBS positive (n=53) and negative samples (n=52), as well as across
multiple runs. Samples were tested in an alternating pattern with high positive
samples (1 x 107 CFU/ml) and negative samples. In the checkerboard-design test,
both the Indeterminate and Unresolved rates were determined to be 0.95% (1/105). A
full run of high positive GBS samples (n=104) followed by a negative run (n=104)
were tested to assess the across-run cross contamination. In the second study, (2)
Indeterminates were generated to yield a 0.96% Indeterminate rate. No Unresolved
results were reported in the second study. No carry-over/cross-contamination was
observed in both studies. The overall percent agreement was 100% for valid positive
and negative samples.
h. Assay cut-off:
NeuMoDx stated that the assay settings were chosen based on an in-house study to
maximize the sensitivity and specificity of the NeuMoDx GBS Assay, which was
subsequently used in the clinical evaluation of 1193 clinical specimens at 3-sites. In
addition, the assay cut-offs were verified using 2 instruments and a set of 30 clinical
negative Lim broth samples and 30 positive samples (clinical negative Lim broth
spiked with GBS cells at/near the LoD). All samples were valid and generated the
expected results. The cut-off values for a positive result for both the internal process
control and GBS were set as follows (Table 7):

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
NeuMoDx conducted a prospective multi-center study at three geographically diverse
sites. Vaginal/rectal swab specimens were collected from pregnant women at 35-37
weeks gestation for routine standard of care screening purposes. Vaginal/rectal
specimen swabs were cultured in Lim broth from 18-24 hrs at 35-37°C according to
established CDC guidelines. Residual de-identified Lim broth cultures were used for
testing with the NeuMoDx GBS Assay. Of the total 1250 specimens enrolled and
tested during the study, (57) were shown to be non-compliant for the following
reasons:
• (48)-Protocol deviation: Lim broth samples were frozen
• (9)-No reference culture result (equivocal culture)
A total of 1193 specimens were compliant and provided valid results for evaluation
from the three participating sites.
For the Reference Culture Method, Lim broth cultures were subcultured to non-
selective blood agar for up to 48 hours and inspected for organisms suggestive of
GBS. Suspected colonies were gram stained and the Gram-positive cocci colonies
were tested for catalase production. Gram positive cocci, catalase negative colonies
were further characterized using streptococcal grouping latex agglutination to
determine the presence of GBS.
The NeuMoDx GBS Assay was performed according to the package insert. The
overall initial invalid rates (Indeterminate and Unresolved) was 0.8% (11/1314) for
the clinical study. The final non-reportable result rate was 0% for the NeuMoDx GBS
Assay, as all samples yielded valid results upon re-testing. Results of the NeuMoDx
GBS Assay were compared to a Reference Culture Method as shown in Table 8. Site
specific performance is shown in Table 9.
