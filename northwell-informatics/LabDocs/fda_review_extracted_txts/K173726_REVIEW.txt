L. Test Principle:
The allergen of interest, covalently coupled to ImmunoCAP solid phase, reacts with the
specific IgE in the patient sample. After washing away nonspecific IgE, enzyme-labeled
antibodies against IgE are added to form a complex. After incubation, unbound enzyme-anti-
IgE is washed away and the bound complex is then incubated with a developing agent. After
stopping the reaction, the fluorescence of the eluate is measured. The higher the response
value, the more specific IgE is present in the specimen. To evaluate the test results, the
responses for the patient samples are transformed to concentrations with the use of a
calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All results presented below met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i) Within-laboratory imprecision:
Imprecision of the allergen component f447, rAra h 6, Peanut was evaluated by
using five positive plasma samples, with the following concentrations of antigen-
specific IgE: 0.13, 1.08, 17.93 and 51.06 kU /L. Each sample was tested in 4
A
replicates in one assay run per day for a total of 20 operating days (a total of 80
replicates per sample). The assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP
Specific IgE Directions for Use using a Phadia 250. Between-day and within-run
coefficients of variance (%CV) were calculated for each sample separately. Results
are shown in the table below:

ii) Lot-to-lot imprecision:
Three different ImmunoCAP Allergen Component lots were tested using four
positive plasma samples and one negative plasma sample (< 0.1 kU /L). For each
A
lot, the samples were tested in 12 replicates in one assay run. Each lot represented
a different preparation of the allergen from routine production. The assay was
performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use, using
the Phadia 250 instrument. Mean concentration values, %CV and concentration
quotients (lowest mean concentration/ highest mean concentration between lots)
were calculated for the positive samples and are presented in the table below:

12 replicates and diluted samples were tested in four replicates in one assay run. The
assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use
using the Phadia 250 instrument using one lot of ImmunoCAP Allergen Component.
The range of the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE is LoD to 100 kU /L.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i) Traceability:
The IgE calibrators are traceable (via an unbroken chain of calibrations) to the 2nd
International Reference Preparation (IRP) 75/502 or the equivalent 3rd International
Standard 11/234 of Human Serum Immunoglobulin E from World Health
Organization (WHO).
ii) Kit Stability:
Real-time and accelerated stability:
Both an ongoing real-time stability study and an accelerated stability study were
performed in accordance with CLSI EP25-A using three lots of ImmunoCAP
Allergen f447, rAra h 6 (Peanut). The accelerated stability data support the
manufacturer’s claim of 24 month unopened shelf-life stability. The real-time
stability study supports six month unopened shelf-life stability and is ongoing.
The studies to determine the stability of the calibration curve, real-time, and on-
board stability of ImmunoCAP Specific IgE calibrator are described in K100999.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined on the
Phadia 250 in alignment with CLSI guideline EP17-A2 using two lots of reagents. The
LoB was based on determinations of five blank samples in three runs with five
replicates per run and was estimated as the 95% percentile of the distribution.
LoD was calculated according to the equation: LoD = LoB + cß • SD where SD ,
LoD LoD
is the pooled SD for each of five low positive samples measured in 15 replicates.
Results from maximum LoD of the two lots were used in the calculation of LoQ. The
precision profile provided supports the LoQ claim of 0.1 kU /L at ≤15% CV.

e. Analytical specificity:
i) Inhibition studies:
Immunological specificity of the allergen component was verified through
competitive inhibition. The studies were planned in accordance with CLSI I/LA20-
A3. The specific IgE concentration for the positive sample is shown in the table
below:
ImmunoCAP Allergen

Component A
f447, rAra h 6 (Peanut) 2.8
The f447, rAra h 6 Peanut allergen solution (inhibitor) was serially diluted with
buffer to show an overall dose dependent inhibition. The following unrelated
inhibitors rFel d 2, Cat, rHev b 6.02, Latex and rVes v 5, Common wasp and
related inhibitor rAra h 9 Peanut were tested at a dose that is ten-fold or higher
than the f447, rAra h 6 Peanut concentration that yielded >50% inhibition. Equal
volumes of the positive sample and varying serial dilutions of f447, rAra h 6 Peanut
were premixed. The mixture was incubated in a sample tube at room temperature
for two hours before being analyzed with ImmunoCAP Allergen f447 on the Phadia
250 according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use. The testing
was performed in duplicate in one assay run. Mean values were calculated.
The inhibition test was evaluated with inhibition values in %, calculated according
to the formula below:
æ ær -böö
ç ç1-ç ÷÷ ÷´100=i%
è èt -bøø
r = response [RU]
b = background response (100% inhibition) [RU]
t = total response (0% inhibition) [RU]
i = inhibition
Any negative inhibition %-values are shown as 0% inhibition.
The results of the inhibition with the allergen solution (inhibitor) and the unrelated
and related inhibitors indicate that the new ImmunoCAP Allergen Component f447,
rAra h 6, Peanut contains the immunologically relevant allergen as shown below:
The inhibition study showed that >50% inhibition was achieved with the inhibitor
(rAra h 6 allergen) at a final inhibitor concentration of 0.93 mg/mL. The inhibition

studies using four unrelated inhibitors, including three from unrelated groups (rFel
d 2, Cat; rHev b 6.02, Latex and rVes v 5, Common wasp) and one related inhibitor
from the same allergen group (r Ara h 9, Peanut f427) did not show any significant
inhibition. The inhibition studies indicate that the ImmunoCAP Allergen f447, rAra
h 6 Peanut solid phase contains the immunologically relevant allergen.
ii) Interference:
a) Endogenous Substance Interference:
Interference from icteric, hemolytic or lipemic samples was tested using
Bilirubin C [final concentration (fc) 19.8 mg/dL], Bilirubin F (19.1 mg/dL),
Hemoglobin (510 mg/dL), Chyle (1,660 FTU-Formazine Turbidity Units) and
Rheumatoid Factor (450 IU/mL). Interferents were spiked into two positive
samples and one negative sample and analyzed in four replicates in one assay
run using the Phadia 250. The results demonstrate that icteric, hemolytic or
lipemic samples do not adversely affect the results in ImmunoCAP Specific
IgE.
b) Exogenous Substance Interference:
Two literature references were provided supporting that commonly prescribed
allergy medications do not interfere with ImmunoCAP Specific IgE. The
references included (i) Robert G. Hamilton, Accuracy of US Food and Drug
Administration-cleared IgE antibody assays in the presence of anti-IgE
(omalizumab), J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2006; 759-766, and (ii) Linda Cox et.
al., Pearls and pitfalls of allergy diagnostic testing: report from the American

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical sensitivity and specificity:
The performance of the allergen component f447, rAra h 6, Peanut was compared to a
clinical diagnosis of allergy. The objectives of this study were: (i) to show the linkage
between specific IgE antibodies to ImmunoCAP Allergen Component and the
corresponding extract based ImmunoCAP Allergen, using clinical samples, and (ii) to

--- Page 9 ---
demonstrate that samples from healthy, non-atopic donors with no reported clinical
reaction to the allergen have undetectable or very low levels of specific IgE to the
individual ImmunoCAP Allergen Component. Thirty four clinical serum samples from
individuals with a clinical history of allergy-like symptoms upon exposure to the
allergen, as diagnosed by a physician, were used in the study. Information about
clinical symptoms and manifestations was available for all clinical samples. Non-atopic
samples (<0.35 kU /L) from 100 healthy non-atopic donors were also tested. Clinical

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected value is negative (< 0.35 kU /L) for a specific allergen in a non-atopic
A
person. The manufacturer recommends a cut-off at 0.35 kU /L. Each laboratory should
A
establish its own expected range of values.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable.
