1. Intended use:
The Optilite Freelite Mx Kappa Free Kit is intended for the quantitative in vitro
measurement of Kappa free light chains in serum and urine using the Binding Site
Optilite analyzer. Measurement of free light chains aids in the diagnosis and monitoring
of multiple myeloma, lymphocytic neoplasms, Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia, AL
amyloidosis, light chain deposition disease and connective tissue diseases such as
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical
findings.
The Optilite Freelite Mx Lambda Free Kit is intended for the quantitative in vitro
measurement of Lambda free light chains in serum and urine using the Binding Site
Optilite analyzer. Measurement of free light chains aids in the diagnosis and monitoring
of multiple myeloma, lymphocytic neoplasms, Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia, AL
amyloidosis, light chain deposition disease and connective tissue diseases such as
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical
findings.
2. Indication for use:
Same as intended use.
3. Special conditions for use statement:
For prescription use only.
Warning: The kappa free light chain results for a given specimen determined with assays
from different manufacturers or on different systems can vary due to differences in assay
methods and reagent specificity. The results reported by the laboratory to the physician
must include the identity of the kappa free light chain assay used. Values obtained with
different assays or systems cannot be used interchangeably. If, in the course of serially
monitoring a patient, the assay or system used for determining kappa free light chain levels
is changed, additional sequential testing should be carried out. Prior to changing assay or
system, the laboratory MUST confirm baseline values for patients being serially monitored.

Clinical Laboratory; Approved Guideline – Third Edition (formerly CLSI C28-A3c)
L. Test Principle:
Evaluating the concentration of a soluble antigen (e.g. Kappa free light chains) by
turbidimetry involves the addition of the test sample to a solution containing the appropriate
antibody in a reaction vessel or cuvette. A beam of light is passed through the cuvette and, as
the antigen-antibody reaction proceeds, the light passing through the cuvette is scattered
increasingly as insoluble immune complexes are formed. Light scatter is monitored by
measuring the decrease in intensity of the incident beam of light. The antibody in the cuvette
is in excess so the amount of immune complex formed is proportional to the antigen
concentration. A series of calibrators of known antigen concentration are assayed initially to
produce a calibration curve of measured light scatter versus antigen concentration. Samples of
unknown antigen concentration can then be assayed and the results read from the calibration
curve.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance: All results presented below met the manufacturer’s pre-
determined acceptance criteria.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Kappa: The within-run, between-run, between-day and between-instrument precision
were determined by testing four urine sample pools over 21 days with two runs per
day using one reagent lot on three analyzers. Results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed following CLSI EP6-A. The linearity of the Kappa
Free and Lambda Free assays was confirmed using serially diluted urine samples to
cover the standard measuring ranges of 2.9–127mg/L (Kappa) and 5.2–139mg/L
(Lambda) respectively. The results demonstrated that the kappa free and lambda free
assays are linear over the ranges of 2.383–142.687mg/L (Kappa) and 3.87–
160.02mg/L (Lambda) with deviation from linearity ≤ 10%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: Internally produced master calibrator
Stability: On board, open vial and real time stability was evaluated in K150658.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity was determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A and was
carried out using both serum and urine matrices. The Limit of Blank (LoB) was based
on 60 determinations of blank samples (analyte depleted serum and urine at a low
analyte concentration) and was estimated at the 95th percentile of the distribution.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was calculated from the LoB and the combined SD of
the five Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) samples. The LoQ was calculated from five
independent samples (serum samples: samples were diluted with analyte depleted
serum; urine samples: in house urine samples at low analyte concentration were
pooled with an in house urine with a higher analyte concentration) to achieve a
concentration close to the bottom of the measuring range) tested twelve times over
five days. The tabulated summary of results is shown below.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
Interferences were assessed according to CLSI EP7-A2 by testing a single urine
sample for the Kappa Free assay and the Lambda Free assay. Samples were prepared
with an analyte concentration around the reference limit of each assay. Each sample
was made up using urine from a healthy adult donor and urine from a kappa or lambda
myeloma patient. Samples containing interferents were compared to matched control
samples which contained no interferent. The mean results from the spiked samples
must be within 10% of the mean of the control samples.
