I. Device Description:
The BreathID Hp System is a non-invasive breath test system for detecting the presence of
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). The system consists of the BreathID Hp device which is an
electro-optical medical device with embedded software that measures and computes the
changes in ratio between 13CO and 12CO concentrations in the patient’s exhalation, and the
2 2
IDkit Hp One test kit.
2

--- Page 3 ---
The IDkit Hp One kit consists of:
· One IDcircuit nasal cannula
· One 75mg 13C-urea tablet
· One 4.3g package of powdered Citrica (citric acid)
· One drinking straw
· Package Insert (Instructions for Use)
The BreathID Hp System continually measures and computes the ratio between 13CO and
2
12CO in the patient’s exhaled breath collected using a nasal cannula before and after the
2
ingestion of 13C-urea. The change in the 13CO / 12CO ratio before and after ingestion of 13C-
2 2
urea is used to compute the Delta over Baseline (DOB).
The 13C measurement method for the BreathID Hp system is based on Molecular Correlation
Spectroscopy (MCS) technology. MCS technology is based on the concept of optical
absorption of specific radiation emitted from CO discharge lamps.

L. Test Principle:
The Exalenz BreathID Hp System is a non-invasive diagnostic test that analyzes a breath
sample before and after ingestion of 13C- urea; it is used to identify those patients with H.
pylori infection. The Exalenz BreathID Hp System breath test is performed as follows: a 75
mg 13C-urea tablet and 4.3 g Citrica Powder are dissolved in water, and the resulting solution
is ingested by the patient. The Citrica creates an acidic environment in the stomach and
delays the transfer of the ingested solution to the duodenum. These two characteristics
facilitate the decomposition of the urea by H. pylori, if present. In the presence of gastric H.
pylori urease, 13C-urea is decomposed to 13CO and NH according to the following equation:
2 3
H. pylori urease
2 13C-urea + 2 H O à 2 13CO + 2 NH
2 2 3
In H. pylori infected patients, H. pylori urease cleaves the urea immediately after the 13C-
urea solution is ingested. The resulting 13CO is rapidly absorbed into the blood and then
2
exhaled in the breath. The BreathID Hp System measures and computes the ratio between
13CO and 12CO in the patient’s exhaled breath before and after the ingestion of 13C-
2 2
urea. The change in the 13CO / 12CO ratio before and after ingestion of 13C-urea is used
2 2
to compute the Delta over Baseline (DOB). In H. pylori-negative patients, 13C-urea is not
converted to 13CO in the stomach because there are no human enzymes that metabolize
2
urea in the stomach.
The test begins with the collection of a baseline breath sample prior to ingestion of the 13C-
urea test solution. The patient breathes normally while the BreathID Hp System collects

samples through the IDcircuit nasal cannula. The IDcircuit extracts moisture and patient
secretions from the breath samples to provide accurate CO readings, and the device
2
measures the 13CO / 12CO ratio of the baseline measurement. The patient then ingests the
2 2
13C -urea test drink. While the patient continues to breathe normally, the BreathID Hp
System continually and non-invasively samples the patient’s breath via the cannula and
measures the changes in the 13CO / 12CO ratio versus the baseline sample. These changes
2 2
are displayed as a graph on the display screen while the test continues. The graph shows
multiple points that allow the physician to identify the change in the DOB of the 13CO /
2
12CO ratio in response to the administered 13C-urea. Once the BreathID Hp System has
2
collected enough data to determine whether or not the graph passes the assay cut-off
threshold unambiguously, it automatically ends the test and prints out the results.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
See K011668 for clinical sensitivity determined in an adult population.
b. Clinical specificity:
See K011668 for clinical specificity determined in an adult population.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The clinical sensitivity and specificity of the BreathID Hp System for pre- and post-
therapy H. pylori diagnosis was previously established in a clinical study with adult
patients in comparison to esophagogastroduodenoscopy biopsy testing (K011668).
No major changes to instrumentation, software, assay cut-off, drug formulation, or
drug dosing were made for use in the pediatric population. Therefore, the BreathID
Hp System test was evaluated in a limited number of pediatric subject with the
primary goal of evaluating safety in this population. Supported by existing clinical
performance in the adult population, device performance was assessed in a limited
clinical study in a pediatric population as described below.
Pediatric population study:
A multi-center, non-randomized, open label study was conducted with the primary
goal of evaluating the safety of the standard dose of the 13C-urea and citric acid
solution in a pediatric population, and a secondary goal of evaluating performance of
the BreathID Hp System compared to stool antigen testing in this population using
IDkit Hp One kit breath collection and the same 5 DOB diagnostic cutoff. The study
tested the 13C-urea drug using the BreathID Hp System in symptomatic children ages
3-17 who were suspected of H. pylori infection and who were scheduled to undergo
both a breath test and an FDA cleared H. pylori stool antigen test. The study was not
powered to assess effectiveness in pediatric subjects, and the standard reference
method (i.e., composite results based on samples from endoscopy) was not used as
the comparator.
The study was conducted at six geographically diverse clinical sites of differing sizes
and experience levels in the US and Israel. Local site personnel were trained on
6

administering the breath test. FDA cleared H. pylori stool antigen testing was
analyzed at a central laboratory. All adverse events associated with the breath test
were recorded.
A total of 54 subjects were screened for study enrollment, and one subject was
excluded prior to participating in any study related procedure. Fifty-three subjects
were enrolled and were followed for the safety assessment. Forty-one of the enrolled
subjects completed the full study protocol requirements and provided evaluable
results for both the BreathID Hp System and the stool antigen test. Of the total
enrolled subjects, 57% (30/53) were female, 43% (23/53) were male, and 77%
(41/53) were less than 12 years old.
Results
Among the 53 pediatric subjects followed for the safety assessment, one adverse
event of vomiting was experienced by one subject (1.89%) and resolved on the same
day. No reportable major safety concerns were observed due to adverse events during
the study.
For the 41 subjects with evaluable test results, the positive percent agreement (PPA)
between the BreathID Hp System and the stool antigen test was 93.3% (14/15) [95%
CI: 70.19, 98.82], and the negative percent agreement (NPA) was 100% (26/26) [95%
CI: 87.1, 100]. See Table 1.

3. Specimen Identification:
Specimens IDs are entered manually.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimens for the BreathID Hp System consist of breath acquired through a nasal
cannula.
5. Calibration:
Calibration is performed by the instrument by diluting pre-dose patient breath or
operator breath into five different concentrations within an absolute maximum
concentration range. The device uses these five concentrations to determine the
systematic error of the system and to ensure that the estimated systematic error is below
a specified value. If the systematic error is not below the specified value, the device
prompts the user to contact the manufacturer for repair or replacement.
6. Quality Control:
To ensure correct functioning of the BreathID Hp System in the field, a self test is
required every 25 breath tests. BreathID Hp System will automatically perform a self
test after 25 tests are completed, during the baseline measurement phase of the next
patient test. This procedure confirms that the BreathID Hp System is functional and is
