I. Device Description:
The BreathID Hp Lab System is a non-invasive breath test system for detecting the presence
of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). The system consists of the BreathID Hp device which is
an electro-optical medical device with embedded software that measures and computes the
changes in ratio between 13CO and 12CO concentrations in the patient’s exhalation, an Auto
2 2
Sampler, a Lab Application, and the IDkit Hp Two test kit.

--- Page 3 ---
The IDkit Hp Two kit consists of:
· Two Breath Sample Bags (Baseline and Post Ingestion) with bar code labels
· One large Sample Transport Bag
· One 75mg 13C-urea tablet
· One 4.3g package of powdered Citrica (citric acid)
· One drinking straw
· Package Insert (Instructions for Use)
· Quick User Guide
The BreathID Hp Lab System measures and computes the ratio between 13CO and 12CO in
2 2
the patient’s exhaled breath before and after the ingestion of 13C-urea. The change in the
13CO / 12CO ratio before and after ingestion of 13C-urea is used to compute the Delta over
2 2
Baseline (DOB).
The 13C measurement method for the BreathID Hp Lab system uses Molecular Correlation
Spectroscopy (MCS) technology. MCS technology is based on the concept of optical
absorption of specific radiation emitted from CO discharge lamps.

L. Test Principle:
The Exalenz BreathID Hp Lab System is a non-invasive diagnostic test that analyzes a breath
sample before and after ingestion of 13C- urea; it is used to identify those patients with H.
pylori infection. The Exalenz BreathID Hp Lab System breath test is performed as follows: a
75 mg 13C-urea tablet and 4.3 g Citrica Powder are dissolved in water, and the resulting
solution is ingested by the patient. The Citrica creates an acidic environment in the stomach
and delays the transfer of the ingested solution to the duodenum. These two characteristics
facilitate the decomposition of the urea by H. pylori, if present. In the presence of gastric H.
pylori urease, 13C-urea is decomposed to 13CO and NH according to the following equation:
2 3
H. pylori urease
2 13C-urea + 2 H O à 2 13CO + 2 NH
2 2 3
In H. pylori infected patients, H. pylori urease cleaves the urea immediately after the 13C-
urea solution is ingested. The resulting 13CO is rapidly absorbed into the blood and then
2
exhaled in the breath. The BreathID Hp Lab System measures and computes the ratio
between 13CO and 12CO in the patient’s exhaled breath before and after the ingestion of
2 2
13C-urea. The change in the 13CO / 12CO ratio before and after ingestion of 13C-urea is
2 2
used to compute the Delta over Baseline (DOB). In H. pylori-negative patients, 13C-urea
is not converted to 13CO in the stomach because there are no human enzymes that

metabolize urea in the stomach.
The BreathID Hp Lab System consists of the BreathID Hp Device, an Auto Sampler, the
computer based BreathID Hp Lab application with a Work Station, and the IDkit:Hp Two
test kit. The system enables sample collection into breath sample bags, instead of using a
nasal cannula. Breath sample bag collection enables off site and deferred testing. The
BreathID Hp Lab System with the IDkit:Hp Two test kit enables testing of multiple breath
sample bags sequentially using the Auto Sampler. A maximum of ten pairs of bags
(Baseline and Post Ingestion) can be attached to the Auto Sampler in 20 ports, for
measurement on the BreathID Hp Device. The Lab Application controls the automated
process and presents the results.
Patients first fill a Baseline Breath Sample Bag prior to ingestion of the 13C-urea test
solution, and then fill a Post-Ingestion Breath Sample Bag 15 minutes after ingestion. The
bags are color-coded to reduce the risk of mixing-up the patient samples collected before
and after consuming the test drink. One DOB measurement detecting the change in the
13CO /12CO ratio is sufficient since the Post-Ingestion Breath Sample Bag contains breath
2 2
collected 15 minutes after consumption of the test drink. Immediately following the
conclusion of the test, the system prints a summary of the test results.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
See K162150 (section M3a) for clinical sensitivity determined in an adult population.
b. Clinical specificity:
See K162150 (section M3a) for clinical specificity determined in an adult population.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The clinical sensitivity and specificity of the BreathID Hp Lab System for pre- and
post-therapy H. pylori diagnosis was previously established in a clinical study with
adult patients in comparison to esophagogastroduodenoscopy biopsy testing
(K162150). No major changes to instrumentation, software, assay cut-off, drug
formulation, or drug dosing were made for use in the pediatric population. Therefore,
the BreathID Hp Lab System test was evaluated in a limited number of pediatric
subject with the primary goal of evaluating safety in this population. Supported by
existing clinical performance in the adult population, device performance was
assessed in a limited clinical study in a pediatric population as described below.
Pediatric population study:
A multi-center, non-randomized, open label study was conducted with the primary
goal of evaluating the safety of the standard dose of the 13C-urea and citric acid
solution in a pediatric population, and a secondary goal of evaluating performance of
the BreathID Hp Lab System compared to stool antigen testing in this population
using IDkit Hp Two kit breath collection and the same 5 DOB diagnostic cutoff. The
study tested the 13C-urea drug using the BreathID Hp Lab System in symptomatic
children ages 3-17 who were suspected of H. pylori infection and who were
scheduled to undergo both a breath test and an FDA cleared H. pylori stool antigen

test. The study was not powered to assess effectiveness in pediatric subjects, and the
standard reference method (i.e., composite results based on samples from endoscopy)
was not used as the comparator.
The study was conducted at six geographically diverse clinical sites of differing sizes
representing clinical laboratory as well as point of care settings in the US and Israel.
Local site personnel were trained on administering the breath test. To represent point
of care and clinical laboratory settings, the bagged sample analysis was performed
either on site or at a central laboratory using a BreathID Hp Lab System. FDA cleared
H. pylori stool antigen testing was analyzed at a central laboratory. All adverse events
associated with the breath test were recorded.
A total of 54 subjects were screened for study enrollment, and one subject was
excluded prior to participating in any study related procedure. Fifty-three subjects
were enrolled and were followed for the safety assessment. Forty-two subjects
completed the full study protocol requirements and provided evaluable results for
both the BreathID Hp Lab System and the stool antigen test. Of the total enrolled
subjects, 57% (30/53) were female, 43% (23/53) were male, and 77% (41/53) were
less than 12 years old.
Results
Among the 53 pediatric subjects followed for the safety assessment, one adverse
event of vomiting was experienced by one subject (1.89%) and resolved on the same
day. No reportable major safety concerns were observed due to adverse events during
the study.
For the 42 subjects with evaluable test results, the positive percent agreement (PPA)
between the BreathID Hp Lab System and the stool antigen test was 93.3% (14/15)
[95% CI: 70.19, 98.82], and the negative percent agreement (NPA) was 100% (27/27)
[95% CI: 87.55, 100]. See Table 1.

5. Calibration:
Calibration is performed by the instrument using five gas samples of known
concentration and isotope ratio to adjust the absorption cell calibration curves. Calibration
is intended to attain identical isotope ratios over the collection range of CO concentrations
2
to ensure accurate readings in both negative and positive samples. The device uses these
five concentrations to determine the systematic error of the system and to ensure that the
estimated systematic error is below a specified value. If the systematic error is not below
the specified value, the device prompts the user to contact Exalenz for repair or
replacement.
6. Quality Control:
To ensure correct functioning of the system, the BreathID Hp Lab System will
automatically perform a self test using an internal SystemTest cartridge after 75 tests are
completed. This procedure confirms that the system is functional and is performing
within specifications.
