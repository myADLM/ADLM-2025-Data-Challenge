Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000 are identical instruments except for sample throughput. The Phadia
2500 consists of 1 process module (2 process lines), whereas Phadia 5000 consists of 2 process
modules (2x2 process lines). Instrument operation is handled by onboard Instrument Software
(ISW). Data output is administered by Information Data Manager (IDM). All steps of an assay
are performed within a single process line. Thus, study protocols used for Phadia 2500 are also
valid for Phadia 5000.

L. Test Principle:
EliA tests are fluorescence immunoassays for the detection and measurement of human
antibodies based on EliA solid-phase components, which contain specific antigens for the
antibodies to be measured. EliA uses a modular reagent system. The test specific, method
specific, and general reagents are packaged and purchased as separate units.
EliA ANCA/GBM: Polystyrene EliA wells are coated with the respective target antigens: human

PR3, human MPO, or human recombinant collagen IVα3 (the glomerular basement membrane
[GBM] antigen). Together, this grouping of autoantigenic targets comprise the ANCA/GBM. If
present in the patient's specimen, autoantibodies to these proteins bind to the specific antigen.
After washing away unbound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgG
antibodies (EliA IgG Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After
incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is incubated with a
fluorogenic development solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction
mixture is measured. The higher the response value, the more autoantigen-specific IgG is present
in the specimen. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is compared directly to
the response for calibrators.
Phadia 2500/5000: The Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000 instruments are automated platforms for
EliA test procedures from sample and reagent handling up to processing of results.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
All results presented below met the Manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria
for all analytical performance studies.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor modeled Precision studies based on CLSI EP05-A3.
To determine the precision of the assay, variability was assessed in a study with a
total of four replicates/sample × three instruments × seven days × one run/day for a
total of 84 datapoints per sample, with a calibration curve for each run. For each
assay (PR3S, MPOS, GBM), five samples were tested: one negative, two in the
equivocal range for each analyte, and two positive specimens. Calibration on day 1
was applied to all data to model normal operations.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
EliA IgG calibration method and traceablity was previously reviewed in K140225.
Stability was previously reviewed in K140225.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor modeled Detection Capability studies based on CLSI EP17-A.
One negative serum sample and five serum samples with low antibody concentration
were tested in twelve replicates in each of six runs on different days (12 replicates × one
run/day × six days = 72 data points per sample). For Phadia 2500/5000, each sample was
tested in a total of six runs on one Phadia 2500/5000 instrument. The results are

LoB were calculated by non-parametric method; LoD were calculated by parametric
method, based on non-parametric LoB; because bias could not be reliably estimated,
LoQ was calculated by precision target, based on a target precision value of 20%.
e. Analytical specificity:
The effect of endogenous and exogenous interferences was reviewed in K140225.
f. Assay cut-off:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor modeled Method Comparison studies based on CLSI EP09-A3.
Positive and Negative Percent Agreement values were calculated for each analyte, for
each of three Phadia 2500/5000 instrument in comparison to a single Phadia 250
instrument.
One hundred three (103) PR3, 107 MPO, and 100 GBM samples were run in
singlicate on three Phadia 2500/5000 instruments and one Phadia 250 for comparison.
Comparisons for each Phadia 2500/5000 instrument against the Phadia 250 predicate
instrument by Passing-Bablok linear regression method is depicted in the table, with
95% confidence intervals.

Per FDA Guidance, “Statistical Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies
Evaluating Diagnostic Tests”, the equivocal zone of the ANCA/GBM assays makes it
appropriate to employ the recommendations in that guidance – for equivocal values to
be calculated in one set of agreement measures (positive percent agreement [PPA]
and negative percent agreement [NPA]) included with positive results.
