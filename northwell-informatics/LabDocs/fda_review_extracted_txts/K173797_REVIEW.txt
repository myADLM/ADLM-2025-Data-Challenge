Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer System
I. Device Description:
The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer System is designed to be a used in clinical laboratory
settings. It consists of the analyzer, sensor cartridges, calibrator packs, auto-cartridge quality
control packs (internal controls), ampuled quality control materials (external controls) and
thermal paper for an onboard printer. Specimens may be identified by scanning a barcode or
by manually entering the information via the touchscreen.
The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer has slots to accommodate two sensor cartridges
(Primary and Auxiliary). The analyzer will determine the configuration of the system by
detecting which sensor cards are installed. The reporting of CO-Oximeter parameters (or not
reporting them) will also be determined by the selection of the Sensor Cards, for which there
are two options:
· Primary Sensor Card 1 reports the following analytes: pO , pCO , pH, Hct, tHb, Na,
2 2
Cl, K, iCa, iMg, Glu, SO , O Hb, COHb, MetHb, HHb, tBil, HbF

L. Test Principle:
pH: pH is measured using a hydrogen ion selective glass membrane. One side of the glass
is in contact with a solution of constant pH. The other side is in contact with a solution of
unknown pH. A change in potential develops which is proportional to the pH difference of
these solutions. This change in potential is measured against a reference electrode of constant
potential. The magnitude of the potential difference is a measure of the pH of the unknown
sample.
pCO pCO is measured with a modified pH sensor. Carbon dioxide in the sample makes
2: 2
contact with a gas permeable membrane mounted on a combination measuring/ reference
electrode. CO diffuses across the membrane into a thin layer of electrolyte solution in
2
response to partial pressure difference. This solution then becomes equilibrated with the
external gas pressure. CO in the solution becomes hydrated producing carbonic acid, which
2
results in a change in hydrogen ion activity, according to the equation:
CO + H O <=> H CO <=> H+ + [HCO –]
2 2 2 3 3
The electrolyte solution behind the membrane is in contact with a glass hydrogen ion
selective sensor. The change in hydrogen ion activity in the electrolyte solution produces a
potential which is measured against the internal filling solution. This change in potential is
measured against the constant potential of the reference electrode half cell and is
logarithmically related to the pCO of the unknown sample.
2
pO pO is measured amperometrically by the generation of a current at the sensor surface.
2: 2
As oxygen diffuses through a gas permeable membrane, the oxygen molecules are reduced at
the cathode, consuming 4 electrons for every molecule of oxygen reduced. This flow of
electrons is then measured by the sensor and is directly proportional to the partial pressure of
oxygen in the sample.

Day-to-day imprecision using whole blood
To simulate total day-to-day precision for whole blood, triplicate analyses were
performed on a single whole blood sample in ten separate runs during a single day.
Samples were delivered to the instrument from syringe or capillary tubes. The
systems were recalibrated before each triplicate run. The results from one
representative analyzer are summarized in the tables below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed using lithium heparin whole blood samples. Some
samples were altered to provide a total ten or eleven analyte concentrations
throughout the analytical measurement range. Each blood level was analyzed in
triplicate on each of the three Stat Profile Prime CCS analyzers and on the Stat Profile
pHOx Ultra analyzer. The pHOx Ultra analyzers were used to establish the target
value of each blood level for each parameter. Results of the linear regression analysis
for one representative analyzer are shown below.

Traceability:

e. Analytical specificity:
An interference testing study was performed using whole blood collected in lithium
heparin vacutainers. The possible interfering substances were tested at two analyte
concentrations. Samples were divided to create two separate pools of blood, one for
control samples and the other for test samples that were spiked with potential
interferent substance. The control and test samples were measured on the same
analyzers in replicates of eight. The sponsor defined significant interference as a
difference between test and control samples of > ±0.020 for pH and > ±10% for pCO
2
and pO .

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were conducted by testing lithium heparinized arterial
and venous whole blood specimens in singlet on the three Stat Profile Prime Plus
analyzers and two pHOx Ultra analyzers. In order to evaluate the claimed measuring
range, some venous whole blood specimens were tonometered, spiked or diluted to
achieve the desired concentrations. The singlet result from each test analyzer was
compared to the average of the results from each comparative method. Linear
regression analysis of one representative analyzer is shown below.

calibrate the Blood Gas, Electrolyte, Metabolite and CO-Ox sensors contained in the
analyzer. Calibrations are initiated by the analyzer automatically but can also be started
manually if necessary.
After startup, the analyzer performs a CO-Ox Light Initialization sequence and, once
complete, initiates a System Calibration and an Air Detector Calibration sequence. The
System Calibration performs a 2-point calibration of the Blood Gas, Electrolyte, and
Metabolite sensors, and a 1-point optical calibration of the CO-Oximeter module. The Air
Detector Calibration sequence calibrates the internal air detectors that position fluids in
the analyzer correctly.
· 2-point calibrations are repeated every 2 hours to ensure the analyzer continues to
perform optimally.
· A 1-point calibration is performed with every sample analysis.
· During the first System Calibration to occur after midnight each day, the analyzer
also performs a CO-Ox Light Initialization sequence and an Air Detector
Calibration.
A System Calibration or Air Detector Calibration can be initiated manually, if needed.
Manual calibrations may be necessary after certain maintenance functions or in response
to unexpected error conditions.
