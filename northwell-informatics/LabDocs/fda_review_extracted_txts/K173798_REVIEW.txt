targets. Well conserved regions of the HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA polymerase genes are targeted to
identify HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA respectively in the specimen. An internal control is used to
detect PCR failure and/or inhibition. The principle of the assay and procedural steps are
described below:
Specimen Collection
Acceptable specimen type is swab samples collected from herpetic cutaneous and
mucocutaneous lesions and stored in BD UVT, Remel M4, Remel M4RT, Remel M5, Remel M6
or UTM transport media. Follow the manufacturer’s package inserts for collection media and
acceptable swab types. Do not use calcium alginate swabs, as they may contain substances that
inhibit PCR testing. Specimens should be transported on ice and stored at 2 to 8 °C for up to 7
days post collection. If there is a greater than 7 days delay before processing of the specimen,
store specimen at -70 °C.
Real-time PCR Instrument Setup
Refer to the LIAISON MDX Operator Manual for details on how to configure the LIAISON
MDX Studio Software to add an assay definition, set up and analyze runs on the LIAISON
MDX.
Direct Amplification Disc Loading and Real-Time PCR Amplification
1. Select samples that need to be tested.
2. Thaw Reaction Mix vials at room temperature (approximate range 18 to 25 °C). Thaw
one Reaction Mix vial for each sample or control to be tested.
3. Scan the barcode on the Simplexa HSV 1 & 2 Direct Reaction Mix vial or barcode card.
4. Scan the disc barcode on the Direct Amplification Disc (DAD).
5. Scan or type in each sample identifier.
6. For one wedge at a time, peel the adhesive foil back to expose the Reaction (R) and
Sample (SAMPLE) wells without completely removing the adhesive foil cover (Figure 1
& 2). Avoid touching the underside of the foil that will be in contact with the wells and
disc surface.
7. Ensure that the Reaction Mix is completely thawed. Briefly spin down the tubes as
needed. (Do not vortex the Reaction Mix).
8. Use the fixed volume pipette to transfer 50 µL of the Reaction Mix into Reaction (R)
well.
9. Use the fixed volume pipette to transfer 50 µL of sample or control; pipette sample or
control into Sample well (SAMPLE).
10. Cover the wedge sealing the wells with the peeled adhesive foil, pressing down firmly
near the edge of the wedge. If the original foil is torn do not load the wells in the wedge.
Instead load another wedge.
11. Tear off the tab portion of the foil cover along the perforation.
12. Repeat steps 6 to 11 for the next sample(s).
13. Load the sealed DAD into the LIAISON MDX and start the run.

Quality Control
SimplexaTM HSV 1 & 2 Positive Control Pack (MOL2160) may be used as an external control
for QC testing, training or proficiency testing. Each laboratory should establish its own Quality
Control ranges and frequency of QC testing based on applicable local laws, regulations and
standard good laboratory practice. Refer to the SimplexaTM HSV 1 & 2 Positive Control
(IFUC.US.MOL2160) for instructions on testing the positive control.

2 Detection of the Simplexa DNA Internal Control (DNA IC) is not required for a valid result
when HSV is detected.
Interpretation of Results
Upon completion of the run, the software automatically calculates and displays results.
For each accession ID (Sample ID) entered, the software displays a result (“Detected”,
“Not Detected”, “Invalid” or “EC500”, EC505 and EC515) for HSV-1 and HSV-2.
a. “Detected” result points to the presence of HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 DNA in the
patient sample.
b. “Not Detected” result points to the absence of HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 DNA in the
patient sample.
c. “Invalid” result points to the inability to determine presence or absence of HSV-1
and/or HSV-2 DNA in the patient sample. This result may be due to 1) DNA
Internal Control (DNA IC) failure, or 2) failure to detect sufficient specimen. The
sample needs to be re-tested. See “Invalid Results” section below.
d. “EC500” Data processing error due to noise, weak or late amplification in the
signal. Repeat the sample. If the problem persists, contact Technical Service.

e. “EC505” Insufficient information to determine whether amplification was
present. If the problem persists, contact Technical Service.
f. “EC515” Internal control amplification is not within specification. Result is
invalid, repeat the sample. If the problem persists, contact Technical Service.
Invalid Results
In case of an “Invalid” result, re-test the sample with a new Reaction Mix vial from the same kit
or a new kit. If the problem is unresolved, contact DiaSorin Molecular Technical Services
department.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility studies were not conducted again for the purposes of this submission
and the results from original submission K150962 are shown below.
Reproducibility for the Simplexa HSV 1 & 2 Direct assay was evaluated. Three
investigative sites assessed the device's inter-site, inter-day and inter/intra-assay
reproducibility. Each of the laboratories tested the positive control and a panel of
five contrived sample pools including a low (approximately 1-2 times LoD) and
medium positive (approximately 2-4 times LoD) for each analyte and a high
negative. The high negative sample contained a small amount of HSV-1 and HSV-2,
and it was designed to be negative approximately 95% of the time. The assays were
performed in triplicate on 5 different days. Each site had 2 operators; each operator
assayed the entire sample panel and positive control once per day, for a total of 2
sets of data per day.

Cross-Reactivity (Analytical Specificity)
The Simplexa HSV 1 & 2 Direct assay’s analytical specificity was evaluated by
testing the ability to exclusively identify HSV-1 and HSV-2 viruses with no cross-
reactivity to organisms that are closely related, or cause similar clinical symptoms or
may be present on cutaneous or mucocutaneous swabs. A total of 71 potential cross-
reactants were spiked into negative cutaneous and mucocutaneous swab matrix and
assayed in triplicate. No cross-reactivity was observed.

Competitive Interference
Competitive interference was studied to evaluate the effects of clinically relevant co-infections
with each of the analytes detected by the Simplexa HSV 1 & 2 Direct assay. The study assessed
whether a high concentration of one virus in the sample could potentially affect the Simplexa
HSV 1 & 2 Direct assay performance for another target present at low levels. A low sample was
contrived at approximately 4 times LoD for each target (HSV-1 McIntryre strain and HSV-2 G
strain), and a baseline Ct was determined for each sample. Each potential concomitant infecting
virus was spiked into the low level sample and assayed in triplicate. Baseline sample results are

Inhibition By Other Microorganisms
The Simplexa HSV 1 & 2 Direct assay was evaluated by testing the ability to identify HSV-1
and HSV-2 viruses when other potentially inhibitory organisms are present. The panel of 71
potentially inhibitory organisms was individually spiked into a pool with a low concentration
(approximately 4 times LoD) of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in cutaneous and mucocutaneous swab
matrix. Each microorganism sample was initially tested in triplicate and if any one of the
replicates was “Not Detected” for either the HSV-1 or the HSV-2 targets then five additional
replicates would be tested to confirm if any inhibition was caused by the microorganism. If the
majority of replicates (>4/8) were “Not Detected” then an inhibitory effect would be determined.
None of the microorganisms caused >4/8 of the replicates to be “Not Detected”. In silico NCBI
BLAST analysis was performed for 7 potential inhibitory organisms.

Prospective Study 1 – Cutaneous and Mucocutaneous Swab Sample Type
K150962
A total of 718 cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesion swab samples were prospectively
collected May 28, 2014 through December 4, 2014 from patients with signs and
symptoms of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection from 6 geographically diverse
locations. Of the 718 samples collected, 9 samples were removed from the analysis
because they were either not tested or had invalid results on the 3 assays (Simplexa
HSV 1 & 2 Direct, culture, or bi-directional sequencing). Of the 709 remaining
samples, 13 samples were removed from the analysis because they were not tested on
the tests included in the composite comparator method sufficient to generate a final
comparator result. A total of 696 samples were used for the analysis. Samples were
17

--- Page 18 ---
tested on Simplexa HSV 1 & 2 Direct at the collection sites, culture samples were
sent to a central lab, and the sequencing samples were sent to DiaSorin Molecular. All
samples were either tested fresh or frozen within 72 hours of sample collection.
Aliquots were made from each sample; 1 aliquot was tested on Simplexa HSV 1 & 2
Direct at the collection site, and the remainder was sent to DiaSorin Molecular. One
aliquot was sent for culture testing at an external site, 1 aliquot was used for bi-
directional sequencing, and the last aliquot was held as a retain. Any sample that was
not collected and frozen within 72 hours was disqualified.
The testing included 332 total runs with 638 evaluable controls, and 5 invalid control
pairs. There were 718 patient samples of which 2 were not evaluable due to internal
control failure, 5 not evaluable due to invalid runs, 1 was not evaluable due to wrong
sample type, 1 not evaluable due to testing on a commercial instrument, 5 Insufficient
Volume Errors, 3 not evaluable because of daily control issues, and 5 non-enrollable
patient samples not meeting acceptance criteria (tested >72hrs post collection).
Prospective Study 2 – Cutaneous and Mucocutaneous Swab Sample Type
K173798
A total of 514 cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesion swab samples were prospectively
collected July 24, 2017 through October 11, 2017. These samples were collected from
patients with signs and symptoms of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection from 4
geographically diverse sites. Of the 514 samples, 511 samples were evaluable on
Simplexa HSV 1 & 2 Direct, 512 were evaluable by the culture method, and 510 were
evaluable by the bi-directional sequencing method. Samples were tested on Simplexa
HSV 1 & 2 Direct at the collection sites, culture samples were sent to a central lab,
and the sequencing samples were sent to DiaSorin Molecular. All samples were either
tested fresh or frozen within 72 hours of sample collection. Aliquots were made from
each sample; 1 aliquot was tested on Simplexa HSV 1 & 2 Direct at the collection
site, and the remainder was sent to DiaSorin Molecular. One aliquot was sent for
culture testing at an external site, 1 aliquot was used for bi-directional sequencing,
and the last aliquot was held as a retain. Any sample that was not collected and frozen
within 72 hours was disqualified.
The testing included 153 total Runs with 250 evaluable controls, and 3 invalid control
pairs. There were 514 patient samples of which 2 were not evaluable due to EC505
codes from both the HSV-1 (FAM) & HSV-2 (CFR610) channel, 2 Insufficient
Volume errors, 18 samples not evaluable because of daily control issues (7 samples
were non-evaluable due to invalid PC control runs and 11 samples were non-
evaluable due to no daily control runs) and 1 was a non-enrollable patient sample that
did not meet the acceptance criteria (tested >72hrs post collection).
Retrospective Study – Cutaneous and Mucocutaneous Swab Sample Type
A total of 174 Cutaneous HSV-1 swabs, 174 Mucocutaneous HSV-2 swabs and 17
samples from unknown locations, were retrospectively collected June 6, 2011 to May
17, 2014 and February 21, 2017 through July 17, 2017. All samples were tested using
the composite comparator method.

[Table 1 on page 18]
The testing included 153 total Runs with 250 evaluable controls, and 3 invalid control
pairs. There were 514 patient samples of which 2 were not evaluable due to EC505
codes from both the HSV-1 (FAM) & HSV-2 (CFR610) channel, 2 Insufficient
Volume errors, 18 samples not evaluable because of daily control issues (7 samples
were non-evaluable due to invalid PC control runs and 11 samples were non-
evaluable due to no daily control runs) and 1 was a non-enrollable patient sample that
did not meet the acceptance criteria (tested >72hrs post collection).

The clinical performance of the Simplexa HSV 1 & 2 Direct assay was evaluated by
comparing the positive and negative percent agreement to a composite comparator
algorithm consisting of culture, bi-directional sequencing and a FDA cleared NAAT.
All samples yielding a positive result by either sequencing or culture were tested on
an FDA cleared NAAT and a 2 out of 3 rule was used to determine the final
composite results. All sites collected and tested the swab samples on the Simplexa
HSV-1 and HSV-2 Direct and sent samples to a central lab for culture testing. For
culture, each sample was tested for HSV- 2 first, and if positive for HSV-2, no further
testing was performed. Samples that were HSV-2 culture negative were further tested
for HSV-1 culture positivity. Dual positives could not be identified in the culture
assay.
The available retained samples were sent to DiaSorin Molecular and tested in a
validated bi-directional sequencing assay. Results for Simplexa HSV 1 & 2 Direct
compared to the composite comparator algorithm are presented in the tables that
follow when combined with the data from the second sample set.
