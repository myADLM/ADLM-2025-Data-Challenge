L. Test Principle:
CRP Vario is a latex immunoassay designed to quantitatively measure blood CRP levels in
serum and plasma. When an antigen-antibody reaction occurs between CRP in a sample
and anti CRP antibody, which has been adsorbed to latex particles, agglutination results.
This agglutination is detected as an absorbance change, with the rate of change being
proportional to the quantity of CRP in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision performance of the device was evaluated over 20 days by assaying
eight CRP concentrations (levels). Levels 1 – 4 were native patient serum samples
targeted near the medical decision point of 1 mg/L and were diluted using either
synthetic serum or low native patient serum samples. Level 5 was a control
material and levels 6 - 8 were serum samples spiked with CRP. The target
concentrations for each level are listed below:
CRP Vario
Sample Sample Matrix
Concentration (mg/L)
Level 1 Serum 0.40
Level 2 Serum 0.60
Level 3 Serum 1.0
Level 4 Serum 2.0
Level 5 CRP High Sensitivity Control 0.5
Level 6 Serum 4.00
Level 7 Serum 6.00
Level 8 Serum 8.00
The samples were tested in 2 replicates, 2 times per day, for a total of 20 testing
days, using one analyzer and one lot of reagents.
The mean concentration value, within-run SD and percent coefficient of variation
(%CV), between-run SD and %CV, and between-day SD and %CV were calculated
for each sample. The within-laboratory (total) SD and %CV were estimated using

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed following the recommendations in CLSI EP06-A.
A high serum pool with a CRP concentration of 11.88 mg/L (measured with a
different CRP method which allows measurement above 10.00 mg/L) was prepared
by spiking patient serum pool with CRP. A low serum pool with a CRP
concentration of 0.10 mg/L was prepared by diluting patient serum with saline. The
low and high serum pools were then combined in varying proportions to create ten
samples (Levels 1 – 10) covering the analytical measuring interval (AMI) of 0.30
mg/L to 10.00 mg/L. Each sample was tested in replicates of 8 and the difference in
recovery between the expected concentration and the measured concentration at
each level did not exceed more than 4%.
Linear regression analysis produced a slope of 1.006, an intercept of -0.020 and an r
value of 0.9998.
The sponsor concluded that the results of the linearity study supported the claimed
measuring interval of 0.3 to 10.0 mg/L.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Assay traceability to CRM 472 (which is traceable to CRM470) is claimed.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor performed Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit
of Quantitation (LoQ) studies following the recommendation in CLSI EP17-A2.
The studies were conducted using two reagent lots, with each lot evaluated
separately for each parameter.
For each reagent lot, the LoB was estimated using a non-parametric option
described in the guideline using samples with no analyte. The maximum LoB
estimate was 0.02 mg/L.
The LoD was estimated following the parametric option described in the guideline
using low-analyte serum samples. The maximum LoD estimate was 0.04 mg/L.
LoQ studies were performed by analyzing eight low concentration serum samples.
The precision profile approach described in the guideline was used to estimate the
LoQ. The LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration that can meet a 20% CV
and the maxium LoQ estimate was 0.07 mg/L. The claimed LoQ in the package
insert is 0.30 mg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Common endogenous substances were evaluated for potential interference with the
candidate assay. The effect of these interferents was confirmed by dose-response
testing at varying concentrations of the interfering substance.
The control and test samples were tested in a minimum of eight replicates, using
one instrument and one lot of each reagents.
Potential interferents were evaluated at the concentrations listed below. For each
analyte, the difference (mg/dL) and the percent difference were calculated between
each test sample and the corresponding control sample using the following
equations:
Difference = Test sample mean concentration - Control sample mean concentration
% difference = (difference/control sample mean concentration) x 100
At the concentrations tested, the maxium observed % difference was ≤ ± 10 %. The
data provided supports the sponsor’s claims that no interference was seen at the
concentrations tested below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method Comparison
The sponsor performed a method comparison study comparing results from the
candidate method on the ARCHITECTc8000 System to the predicate assay.
One lot of CRP Vario reagents were evaluated in this study.
One hundred and fifteen (115) serum patient samples with concentrations spanning
the measuring interval (0.3 - 10.0 mg/L) were tested in singlicate on the candidate
method and predicate method. The study was performed on three testing days.
A Passing-Bablok linear regression was performed, resulting in a slope of 1.019, an
intercept of 0.061 and a correlation coefficient (r-value) of 0.996.
b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor conducted a study to evaluate the performance of different sample
7

--- Page 8 ---
collection tubes for serum and plasma when compared with serum from a plastic
tube without gel. For each tube type, a total of 40 native samples spanning the
measuring range were evaluated.
The data was collected using 1 instrument, and 1 lot of reagent. A Passing-Bablok
linear regression analysis was performed using the first replicate of the test matrix
(i.e., the different sample collection tubes for serum and plasma) and the mean of
the first 2 replicates of the comparator matrix (i.e., serum from a plastic tube
without gel).
Linear regression analysis produced the following:
