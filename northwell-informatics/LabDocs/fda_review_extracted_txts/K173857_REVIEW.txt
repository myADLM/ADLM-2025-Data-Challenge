L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys Tacrolimus assay uses the principle of electrochemiluminescence for detection
and measurement. Before testing with the Elecsys Tacrolimus assay, the specimen,
calibrators and controls are pretreated with the Elecsys ISD Pretreatment Reagent. The
reagent lyses the cells, extracts Tacrolimus and precipitates blood proteins. The pretreated
samples are centrifuged, and an aliquot of the resulting supernatant containing tacrolimus is
then assayed using the Elecsys Tacrolimus reagent.
The Elecsys Tacrolimus is a competitive immunoassay.
· 1st incubation: 35 μL of pretreated sample is incubated with a tacrolimus-specific
biotinylated antibody and a ruthenium complex-labelled tacrolimus-derivative. If
there is no tacrolimus in the sample, the labelled antibody binding site is occupied
only with ruthenium complex-labelled tacrolimus-derivative. As the concentration of
tacrolimus in the sample increases, the labelled antibody binding site is occupied in
part with sample tacrolimus and in part with ruthenium complex labelled tacrolimus-
derivative, thus the amount of antibody bound ruthenium complex labelled
tacrolimus-derivative is inversely proportional to the quantity of tacrolimus in the
plasma specimen.
· 2nd incubation: After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles the entire
complex becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin. ·

The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are
magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Application of a voltage to
the electrode then induces electrochemiluminescent emission which is measured by a
photomultiplier.
· Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument-specifically
generated by 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Internal Precision Study
An internal precision study was conducted using the CLSI guideline document EP05-
A2 as a guide. Four pooled patient whole blood samples and single-donor spiked
human whole blood samples (Human Sample Pool or HSP) and three controls
(PreciControl ISD Level 1, 2 and 3) were measured using one lot of reagent. Each
sample was tested in single determination in four separate aliquots (divided in two
runs per day) for 21 operating days, and samples were randomized for each run. A
separate extraction was performed with the ISD Sample Pretreatment reagent for each
sample measurement.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the tacrolimus assay was assessed on the cobas e 411 analyzer. Three
dilution series were prepared from three different spiked human whole blood samples.
Each dilution series included 22 dilutions and included concentrations between 0.5 to
32.5 ng/mL. Each sample was measured 4-fold within one run and the measured
concentrations were plotted against the expected sample concentration. A separate
extraction was performed with the ISD Sample Pretreatment reagent for each sample.
The linearity data was determined in accordance with CLSI EP6-A. The results from
a representative dilution series are as follows:
y=1.0942x-0.1099; r2=0.9980
The sponsor’s claimed measuring range is 0.75 to 30 ng/mL.
Recovery
The recovery of the tacrolimus assay was evaluated using pooled human whole blood
(drug free) and patient samples.
Drug-free human whole blood pools were spiked with known concentrations of
tacrolimus. The patient derived samples (from patients taking tacrolimus) were
measured prior spiking, to determine the endogenous concentration. Each of these
aliquots was spiked with a defined concentration of analyte (5 ng/mL, 10 ng/mL, 15
ng/mL and 20 ng/mL) to obtain at least four different spiking levels for each patient
sample (five total samples). Each level was spiked independently to produce 5
replicates. For each measurement, a separate extraction was performed with the ISD

Dilution Study
A dilution study was performed to validate the manual dilution protocol
recommended by the manufacturer in the package insert (1:3 dilution on samples with
results > 30.0 ng/mL). The labeling specifies that samples must be diluted manually
prior to pretreatment.
Three pooled human whole blood samples were spiked separately with a known
concentration of tacrolimus. These samples were used to prepare a dilution series of
nine respective dilutions. Each sample was measured in duplicate. These samples
were diluted with the Elecsys Diluent Universal prior to the manual pre-treatment
procedure. A separate extraction was performed with the ISD Sample Pretreatment
reagent for each sample measurement. The percent recoveries were calculated
between the expected and the measured concentration, and ranged from 91.4% to
117%., tc. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or

Traceability:
Elecsys Tacrolimus is traceable to gravimetrically prepared tacrolimus reference
material (USP), confirmed by LC-MS/MS.
Real-time stability studies were conducted on the Roche Tacrolimus CalSet test
material to support the sponsor’s storage claim for 15 months at 4°C.
The sponsor conducted sample stability studies to support the following claims:
· 5 days at 15-25°C
· 7 days at -20°C or lower for up to 3 months. Specimens should only be frozen
once.
· Pretreated samples can be stored in closed tubes up to 4 hours at 20-25°C.
Pretreated samples should be analyzed/measured within 30 minutes after
opening the vials and loading the samples on the system.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB)
LoB of the Elecsys Tacrolimus assay has been determined according to CLSI EP17-
A2. The Limit of Blank was determined as the 95th percentile of the measurement of
blank samples. The distribution of values for five analyte-free whole blood samples
was determined with one reagent lot on two cobas e 411 analyzers with six runs
distributed over a period of 5 days. The sample was measured in one-fold
determination in each run. In summary, 30 measuring points were collected per
instrument, for a total of 60 measured values. The LoB was determined to be 0.078
ng/mL.
Limit of Detection (LoD):
The distribution of values for five spiked human whole blood samples with low
analyte has been determined with one reagent lot on two cobas e 411 analyzers with
six runs distributed over a period of 5 days. Samples were measured in one-fold
determination in each run. 30 measuring points were collected per instrument, for a
total of 60 measured values. The sum of standard deviations (SD total) of the five
samples was calculated. The LoD was determined according to the following EP17-
A2 calculation:
LoD = LoB + 1.653 x SD total (of low analyte samples)
A separate extraction was performed with the ISD Sample Pretreatment reagent for
each sample measurement. LoD was determined to be 0.2209 ng/mL.

Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
LoQ of the Elecsys Tacrolimus assay has been determined according to CLSI EP17-
A2. The LoQ was determined as the lowest concentration of analyte that can be
quantified with a total error of ≤25%. Testing was conducted using three reagent lots
on two cobas e 411 analyzers with six runs distributed over six days. A separate
extraction was performed with the ISD Sample Pretreatment reagent for each sample
measurement. 84 measuring points were collected per instrument, for a total of 168
measured values per lot.
Reagent lot LoQ (ng/mL)
1 0.629
2 0.597
3 0.580
The results support the sponsor’s claimed LoQ of 0.75 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical Specificity/Cross Reactivity
Potential cross-reacting compounds were spiked into two human whole blood
samples. For metabolites I – IV, the spiked samples were evaluated at four
concentrations. A separate extraction was performed with the ISD Sample
Pretreatment reagent for each sample measurement. For metabolites V- VIII, the
spiked samples were evaluated at two concentrations. The percent cross reactivity
was calculated using the following equation:
% of cross reactivity = 100 * [(measured result from sample with spiked analyte -
measured result from unspiked sample)/spiked concentration of cross-reactant]

Endogenous Interferences
Low and high tacrolimus-containing whole blood samples (approximately 3 ng/mL
and 10 ng/mL tacrolimus, respectively) were divided into two aliquots each. One
aliquot was spiked with the interfering substance up to a concentration given in the
table below, while the other was spiked with diluent to serve as a spike volume
control. Each sample was tested in 10 replicates. The recovery for each sample was
calculated based on the difference between the interferent-spiked and control-spiked
results. The sponsor claims that no significant interference was observed based on the
following specifications:
· LoQ to 3 ng/mL must be ≤ ± 0.3 ng/mL recovery to reference

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The following is stated in the package insert:
No firm therapeutic range exists for tacrolimus in whole blood. The complexity of the
clinical state, individual differences in sensitivity to immunosuppressive and nephrotoxic
effects of tacrolimus, coadministration of other immunosuppressants, type of transplant,
time post-transplant, and a number of other factors contribute to different requirements
for optimal blood levels of tacrolimus. Individual tacrolimus values cannot be used as the
sole indicator for making changes in the treatment regimen. Each patient should be
thoroughly evaluated clinically before treatment adjustments are made, and each assay
user must establish his or her ranges based on clinical experience. Values obtained with
different assay methods cannot be used interchangeably due to differences in assay
methods and cross-reactivity with metabolites, nor should correction factors be applied.
Therefore, consistent use of one assay for individual patients is recommended. These
ranges will vary according to the commercial in vitro diagnostic test used. Ranges must
be established for each commercial test used.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
