L. Test Principle:
The BD BACTEC Peds Plus /F medium is an enriched soybean- casein digest broth, with
each vial containing 40 mL of broth. Sodium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) is added to the
medium as an anticoagulant that inhibits bacteriocidal activities in the blood. The
concentration of SPS has been adjusted to accommodate the low blood volumes of 0.5- 5.0
mL per vial.
Each BD BACTEC Peds Plus/F culture vial contains a chemical sensor in a silicon rubber
base that can detect increases in CO produced by the growth of microorganisms. Low
2
volume (0.5- 5 mL) of blood is inoculated into the BD BACTEC Peds Plus/F blood culture
vial, which is inserted into the BD BACTEC Fluorescent Series instrument for incubation,
agitation and periodic measurement. When microorganisms are present in the blood sample,
they metabolize nutrients in the culture medium, releasing CO into the medium. A dye in the
2
sensor reacts with the CO , modulating the amount of light that is absorbed by the fluorescent
2
material in the sensor. The instrument’s photo detectors monitor the sensor every 10 minutes
and measure the level of fluorescence, which is proportional to the amount of CO present in
2
the vial. Positivity of a vial is determined by algorithms resident in the instrument rack’s
microprocessor. The algorithms use the rate of CO production as well as the absolute
2
increase in CO to interpret the data.

d. Detection limit:
Microbial Detection Limit (MDL)
The microbial detection limit study was conducted to assess the capability of the
culture media to detect low level of organisms (expected target level of 0-1 and 1-10
CFU/vial) when present in blood. The study included 15 organisms (12 bacteria and
3 yeast strains) tested with 3.0 mL of blood, at challenging target inoculum levels of
0-1 and 1-10 CFU/vial across three lots with BACTEC FX and BACTEC 9240
instruments:
15 strains x 1 blood volume (3.0 mL) x 2 inoculum levels x 3 lots x 2 instruments =
180 paired sets
For statistical analysis, 95% two-sided bootstrap confidence intervals for differences
were used. The results were stratified by organism and are shown in Table 3.1 below.

Performance of the BD BACTEC Peds Plus/F (plastic) blood culture vials was evaluated
in seeded internal analytical studies to demonstrate equivalent performance to the
comparator device, the BD BACTEC Peds Plus/F (glass) blood culture vials. The
comparisons were made using the following parameters: Time to detection, percent
recovery, false negative rate, and antimicrobial neutralization capability. For statistical
analysis, 95% two-sided bootstrap confidence intervals for differences were used.
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Instrument Time to Detection (TTD) study
The TTD (in hours) was recorded as part of the combined Percent Recovery and the
Microbial Detection Limit (MDL) studies. MDL studies were conducted using the
BD BACTEC FX and 9240 instruments at challenging inoculum levels 0- 1 and 1- 10
CFU per vial. The Percent Recovery study represented by the standard inoculum of
10 to 100 CFU per vial across four instruments (9050, 9240, FX, and FX40). Studies
were conucted with 3.0 mL of blood over three media lots.

The TTD study demonstrated that the modified plastic device performed equivalently
compared to the comparator glass device when stratified by target inoculum level,
organisms or lot numbers. It was observed that the median TTD for the modified
plastic vial and the predicate glass was 17.07 and 17.52 hours respectively. The
median difference was -0.50 hours (95% CI -0.50, -0.33), favoring the plastic vial by
approximately 30 minutes as noted in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 above.
Percent Recovery (Detection) Study
The percent recovery (detection) was evaluated in a study of 492 paired sets (41
strains x 3 lots x 4 instruments= 492) at the standard inoculum level of 10 to 100
CFU/vial on four instruments across three lots with 3.0 mL of blood using a diverse
set of 41 strains that are commonly isolated from blood. The strains tested is listed in
Table 4.2 above.
At standard inoculum level of 10-100 CFU/mL, the detection rate was 100% for both
predicate glass and modified plastic devices. Difference in percent recovery was 0%.
95% CI is calculated using a score method for correlated proportion, shown in Table
5.1 for overall performance and in Table 5.2 stratified by lots.

The study demonstrated that the modified plastic device performed equivalently when
compared to the comparator glass device. The detection rate was 100% for organisms
listed in Table 4.2 at standard inoculum level of 10-100 CFU/vial with 3.0 mL of
blood for both the comparator glass and the plastic vials.
Haemophilus spp. Detection Re-calculation
There were four Haemophilus spp. tested in the percent recovery (detection) study
with 3.0 mL of blood at the inoculum level of 10-100 CFU/vial. The detection rate
was 100% (Table 5.1 above) due to the increased blood volume of 3.0 mL in this
study.
The Haemophilus spp. detection rate was evaluated originally (K151866) for three

target inoculum levels (0-1, 1-10, and 10-100) at 0.5 mL blood with the detection rate
range of 8% - 40%. When stratified, the dataset of standard inoculum level 10- 100
CFU/vial with 0.5 and 5.0 mL blood was re-calculated and presented separately in the
current submission.
There were a total of 96 paired sets (4 strains x 2 blood vol. x 3 lots x 4 instruments
=96) in this re-calculation. The detection rate was 69% (33/48) and 100% (48/48) for
0.5 mL blood and 5.0 mL blood respectively. The detection rate is updated and
presented separately according to blood volume at inoculum level of 10- 100
CFU/vial:
The Haemophilus species detection rates were 69% with 0.5 mL blood, and 100%
with 5.0 mL
False Negative Rates (Instrument-negative, subculture-positive)
A false negative was defined as a vial that was instrument-negative at the end of
protocol (120 hours) yet contains viable organisms by subcultured onto appropriate
culture media. The data for this study was generated from the Instrument Time to
Detection, Percent Recovery, and Microbial Detection Limit studies.
A total of 110 instrument negative vials were sub-cultured at the end of protocol; 53
glass and 57 plastic vials. All subcultures were negative. There were no false
negatives observed in either the glass or plastic device.
False Positive Rate ((Instrument-positive, subculture-negative)
A false positive was defined as instrument positive but subculture negative. False
positivity of the BACTEC Peds Plus/F plastic vial was assessed with 0.5, 3, and 5 mL
fresh human blood in the previous submission (K151866). No instrument false
positive signals were detected in the evaluation.
The plastic device performed equivalently when compared to the glass device in the
false positive study.
BD BACTEC Instrument Compatibility
The BACTEC instrument compatibility study was evaluated from the MDL and
Percent Recovery studies (180+492= 672 paired sets) across four fluorescent series
instruments: BD BACTEC FX, FX40, 9240, and 9050. The study included target
inoculum levels of 0-1, 1-10, and 10-100 CFU/mL with 3.0 mL of blood. All four
instruments were tested for standard inoculum level of 10-100 CFU/vial; FX and
9240 were tested for inoculum levels of 0-1, 1-10 CFU/mL. Of the 672 paired sets,
596 sets recovered organisms in both the comparator glass and plastic vials. The
BACTEC instrument compatibility study is shown in Tables 6.1 and 6.2.

Antimicrobial Neutralization Capability
The Antimicrobail Neutralization Capability is to support the removal of the current
limitation listed in the BACTEC Peds Plus/F Culture Vials (plastic) package insert,
“Based on the neutralization study with Candida albicans and fluconazole, the media
showed some degree of neutralization; however the results were inconclusive. The
adequacy of antifungal neutralization by resins in the BD BACTEC Peds Plus/F vial
(plastic) in unknown.”
In the antimicrobial neutralization study, fluconazole was evaluated at 1.0 and 2.0
µg/mL with two susceptible strains of Candida albicans (expected fluconazole MIC:
0.5 µg/mL) at target inoculum of 10- 100 CFU/vial with 3.0 mL of blood in the Peds
Plus/F Culture Vials Soybean-Casein Digest Broth with Resins. Each paired set was
tested in triplicates for each strain at each fluconazole concentration:
2 strains x 2 test concentration x 3 (triplicates) = 12 paired-sets
One set of non-resin vials (BACTEC Standard/10 Aerobic/F) with and without
fluconazole were tested as controls for each strain at each fluconazole concentration.
The non-resin vial with fluconazole served as negative (no growth) and the non-resin
vial without fluconazole served as positive (growth) controls. The results are shown
in Table 7.

The study demonstrated that resins in the Peds Plus/F media adequately neutralize
fluconazole when testing Candida albicans at 10- 100 CFU/vial with 3.0 mL of
blood. It upports the removal of the limitation. The following information specific for
the antifungal agent/yeast combination is included in the Antimicrobial Activity
section under limitation of the product labeling:
“Studies have demonstrated that the resins present in this medium adequately
neutralize the antifungal agent fluconazole with Candida albicans. However, other
antifungal agents/yeast combination have not been tested/evaluated.”
b. Matrix comparison:
In seeded analytical studies, the performance of BD BACTEC Peds Plus/F culture
medium in plastic vial was compared to that in glass vial, with 3.0 mL of blood, 32
common blood bloodstream bacteria and three yeast species across four fluorescent
series instruments (BACTEC FX, FX40, BACTEC 9240, and BACTEC 9050).
