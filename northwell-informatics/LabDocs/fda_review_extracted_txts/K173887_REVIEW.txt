K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
N/A
L. Test Principle:
The cobas CT/NG assay is based on fully automated sample preparation (nucleic acid
extraction and purification) followed by PCR amplification and detection. The cobas
6800/8800 Systems consist of the sample supply module, the transfer module, the processing
module, and the analytic module. Automated data management is performed by the cobas
6800/8800 software which assigns test results for all tests as positive, negative, or invalid.
Results can be reviewed directly on the system screen, exported, or printed as a report.
Nucleic acid from patient samples and internal control DNA (DNA-IC), added into the
specimens to monitor for inhibition of nucleic acid isolation and amplification, is
simultaneously extracted. In summary, bacterial nucleic acid is released by addition of
proteinase and lysis reagent to the sample. The released nucleic acid binds to the silica surface
of added magnetic glass particles. Unbound substances and impurities, such as denatured
protein, cellular debris and potential PCR inhibitors are removed with subsequent wash steps
and purified nucleic acid is eluted from the magnetic glass particles with elution buffer at
elevated temperature.
Selective amplification of target nucleic acid from the sample is achieved by the use of target-
specific forward and reverse primers selected from highly conserved plasmid and genomic
regions of CT and NG. A region on the CT cryptic plasmid and the ompA gene (dual target)
and two conserved sequences of the NG DR-9 region are amplified. Selective amplification of
DNA-IC is achieved by the use of sequence-specific forward and reverse primers which have
no homology with either the CT or NG target regions. A thermostable DNA polymerase
enzyme is used for PCR amplification. The target and DNA-IC sequences are amplified
simultaneously utilizing a universal PCR amplification profile with predefined temperature
steps and number of cycles. The master mix includes deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP)
instead of deoxythimidine triphosphate (dTTP), which is incorporated into the newly
synthesized DNA (amplicon). Any contaminating amplicons from previous PCR runs are
eliminated by the AmpErase enzyme, which is included in the PCR master mix, during the
first thermal cycling step. However, newly formed amplicons are not eliminated since the
AmpErase enzyme is inactivated once exposed to temperatures above 55°C.
The cobas CT/NG master mix contains two detection probes specific for the CT target
sequences, two detection probes specific for the NG target sequences and one for the DNA-
IC. The probes are labeled with target specific fluorescent reporter dyes allowing
simultaneous detection of CT targets, NG targets, and DNA-IC in three different channels.
When not bound to the target sequence, the fluorescent signal of the intact probes is
suppressed by a quencher dye. During the PCR amplification step, hybridization of the probes
to the specific single-stranded DNA template results in cleavage of the probe by the 5' to 3'
exonuclease activity of the DNA polymerase resulting in separation of the reporter and
quencher dyes and the generation of a fluorescent signal. With each PCR cycle, increasing
amounts of cleaved probes are generated and the cumulative signal of the reporter dye
increases concomitantly. Real-time detection and discrimination of PCR products is
6

accomplished by measuring the fluorescence of the released reporter dyes for the CT and NG
targets and DNA-IC, respectively.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision:
Precision of the cobas CT/NG assay was examined in-house using a panel composed of
CT and NG cultures diluted into the following backgrounds: 1. negative endocervical
swab specimen matrix collected in cobas PCR Media, 2. negative urine matrix mixed with
cobas PCR Media, and 3. negative cervical specimen matrix collected in PreservCyt
Solution. Endocervical swabs were intended to represent both swab specimen types
(endocervical and vaginal) collected in cobas PCR Media. Four levels of each analyte
were tested using CT serovar D and NG strain 2948 (ATCC 19424) as the target
organisms.
The precision panel for each of the three matrices contained one negative panel member
and panel members with high negative, low positive, and moderate positive concentrations
of CT and NG, corresponding to ≤0.3X LoD, ~1X LoD, and ~3X LoD, for each panel
matrix. Upon repeated measure, specimens with concentrations of 1X LoD are expected to
yield positive results ≥95% of the time and specimens with concentrations of 3X LoD are
expected to yield positive results ≥99% of the time. Testing was performed over 12 non-
consecutive days with three lots of cobas CT/NG reagents and two runs per day using two
instruments for a total of 24 runs. A total of 72 replicates were tested for each panel
member.
Study results demonstrated the expected percent agreement for all panel members. All
negative panel members tested negative throughout the study. Analysis of standard
deviation and percent coefficient of variation (CV) of the Ct values from valid tests
performed on positive panel members yielded overall CV (%) ranges from 1.59% to
4.05% for CT and from 1.17% to 3.55% for NG. Detailed results for this study are
presented in the Tables 1-3 below.

Reproducibility:
A Reproducibility Study was performed across different sites, lots, operators/batches, and
days, for cobas CT/NG using three panels of pooled negative or contrived specimens
prepared from swabs and urine in cobas PCR Media and cervical specimens in PreservCyt
Solution. Testing was performed at one in-house and two external sites. One panel
consisted of the three sample matrices, with six concentrations per matrix, and three
replicates per concentration for a total of 54-samples in one panel. Concentrations utilized
were as follows, with positive panel members prepared by spiking CT serovar D and/or
NG 19424 into the CT/NG-negative background:

5 ~ 3.0 × LoD ~ 1.0 × LoD
6 ~ 1.0 × LoD ~ 3.0 × LoD
CT = Chlamydia trachomatis; LoD = limit of detection; NG = Neisseria gonorrhoeae
A batch was comprised of one 54-sample panel and two controls (one positive control and
one negative control). Two operators at each site tested one batch each per day with each
lot. Two valid batches had to be completed within a 24-hour period. Each site received
two of the three reagent lots and performed 6 days of testing per reagent lot for a total of
9

12 days of testing. For each combination of concentrations noted, a total of 216 replicates
were tested in each specimen type (urine, swab, and PreservCyt) for a total of 3,888 tests
performed, with only two failed tests each from PreservCyt.
No false positive results for either CT or NG were observed in any of the three matrices;
thus the negative percent agreement was 100% for both analytes. For panel members with
concentrations at or near the limit of detection (e.g., 1x LoD) of the test, the lower limit of
the 2-sided 95% CI of the percentage of correct test results was at least 97.4% for CT and
95.3% for NG.
For panel members with concentrations 3-times above the limit of detection (e.g., 3x LoD)
of the test, the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the percentage of correct test results
was 98.3% for both CT and NG.

*assessed based on valid test results
For each positive panel member, precision was evaluated by sample type in terms of lot,
site, day, operator/batch within site, lot and day, and within-batch components on the
corresponding analyte cycle threshold (Ct) values of cobas CT/NG.
Chlamydia trachomatis results:
The range of the total coefficient of variation, among positive panel members, was from
0.9% to 3.2%. The maximum total coefficient of variation was observed in the high
negative panel members (0.3x LoD CT, 0.3x LoD NG) and most of that variability (98.6%
for urine, 100% for swab and 81.7% for cervical) was explained by random error.
Detailed results from testing are presented in the Tables 5-8 as follows:

Neisseria gonorrhoeae results:
The range of the total coefficient of variation, among positive panel members, was from
1.0% to 3.1%. The maximum total coefficient of variation was observed in the lowest
concentration of positive panel members (0.3x LoD CT, 0.3x LoD NG) and most of that
variability (98.7% for urine, 98.1% for swab and 85.3% for cervical) was explained by
random error (within-batch).
Detailed results from testing are presented in Tables 9-12.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls:
External controls are provided in the cobas CT/NG Positive Control Kit and the cobas
Buffer Negative Control Kit, and are required to be included in each run. Validation of
results is performed automatically by the cobas 6800/8800 software based on negative and
positive control performance. Invalid batches require repeat testing of the entire batch. The
CT/NG Positive Control contains non-infectious DNA plasmids of both CT and NG
sequences and is used as a run control to monitor target amplification and detection. The
cobas Buffer Negative Control Kit contains buffer with no nucleic acid.
In addition, a DNA Internal Control is introduced into each specimen during sample
processing and monitors specimens for substances that may interfere with nucleic acid
isolation and PCR amplification. The DNA Internal Control contains a non-CT/NG related
DNA construct containing primer and probe specific sequence regions.
Specimen Stability:
Specimen stability during storage was evaluated for the following four specimen types:
• Endocervical swabs collected in cobas PCR media
• Vaginal swabs collected in cobas PCR media
• Urine stabilized by cobas PCR media
• Cervical specimens collected in PreservCyt Solution (primary and secondary containers)

Samples were prepared for each specimen matrix by combining prescreened negative
individual specimens to generate ten unique pools. Five pools of each specimen type were
used as CT/NG negative samples and five pools were used to prepare CT/NG positive
samples. Positive samples were prepared by spiking individual CT and NG positive
specimens into the negative samples to approximately 3 X LoD. Testing was performed
on the day of sample preparation and at several time points during the storage time period.
Study results demonstrated that positive samples remained positive for a minimum of 12
months when stored at both 2-8°C and 32°C. Matrix-only samples yielded the expected
negative results for the same storage conditions. PreservCyt samples transferred to
secondary containers demonstrated stability for up to 31 days when stored at both 2-8°C
and 32°C.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical sensitivity (Limit of Detection or LoD) of the cobas CT/NG Test for use on the
cobas 6800/8800 Systems was determined by analyzing a dilution series of quantified
cultures of Chlamydia trachomatis (serovars D and I) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates
2948 (ATCC 19424) and 891. CT and NG cultures were diluted into a matrix of pooled
negative specimens for each specimen type:
• Endocervical swabs collected in cobas PCR media
• Vaginal swabs collected in cobas PCR media
• Urine stabilized by cobas PCR media
• Cervical specimens collected in PreservCyt Solution
CT serovars and NG strains were tested at five concentration levels across three reagent
lots, with 21-30 replicates for each positive level per reagent lot. The claimed LoD as
established by the 95% Hit Rate Analysis represents the lowest concentration level which
was detected in ≥ 95% of tested replicates and for which all higher concentration levels
also had ≥95% detection. The LoD for CT serovars D and I and NG strains 2948 and 891
for each matrix are as follows:

Inclusivity:
Inclusivity and verification of the LoD were performed for 13 additional CT serovars, the
Swedish new variant strain (nvCT) and an additional 43 independently isolated strains of
NG using one lot of reagents. Testing was performed using CT and NG cultures diluted
into negative background prepared for each specimen type by pooling pre-screened
specimens negative for both CT and NG. Specimen types evaluated were: 1. vaginal swab
specimens collected in cobas PCR media (intended to represent both endocervical and
vaginal swab specimens), 2. urine mixed with cobas PCR media, and 3. cervical
specimens collected in PreservCyt Solution. CT serovars and NG strains were spiked to
concentrations that were near the highest LoD levels determined in the Limit of Detection
study, and were tested concurrently when feasible. Twenty replicates were tested for each
strain in each specimen type. Additional dilution levels and replicates were tested for
those strains which did not demonstrate a ≥95% hit rate for the previously established
LoDs. Results are shown in the Tables 14 and 15 below. For NG, all strains with the same
LoD and hit rate for a given specimen type are presented as a group, shown in Table 15 in
the columns labeled “Numbers of NG Strains.”

other phylogenetically unrelated organisms, were tested with the cobas CT/NG assay to
assess analytical specificity/cross-reactivity (see Table 17). Samples were spiked at
concentrations of approximately 1 x 106 units/mL for bacteria and approximately 1 x 105
units/mL1 for viruses into negative background prepared for each specimen type by
pooling pre-screened specimens negative for both CT and NG. Specimen types evaluated
were: 1. vaginal swab specimens collected in cobas PCR media (intended to represent
both endocervical and vaginal swab specimens), 2. urine mixed with cobas PCR media,
and 3. cervical specimens collected in PreservCyt Solution. Testing was performed with
each potential interfering organism alone as well as with each organism mixed with CT
and NG cultures at approximately 3x LoD. Results indicated that none of these organisms
interfered with the detection of CT and NG or produced false positive results in the
CT/NG negative matrices.

analytical studies, as evidenced by a clear distinction between positive results and negative
results/the end of the PCR profile. Analytical studies were included in this assessement to
enrich the dataset with results from samples with a low target concentration. Stability and
interference studies data were not included in this analysis, since those studies are
designed to stress the system thereby potentially producing invalid results.
Assessed for these studies as described, the difference between the latest Ct value in
positive specimens and assay cut-off was 5.5 cycles for CT and 3.5 cycles for NG. For
specimens from the clinical study only, broken out to assess performance in a typical
patient population, the difference between the latest Ct value in positive specimens and
assay cut-off was 7.8 cycles for CT and 3.5 cycles for NG (shown below). The following
graphs illustrate the distribution of Ct values from the clinical study.
g. Contamination:
Sample-to-sample and run-to-run cross-contamination studies were performed to evaluate
potential cross contamination on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems using the cobas CT/NG
assay. Contrived sample backgrounds consisting of clean media with HCT-15 cells were
used to represent swab samples collected in cobas PCR media (endocervical and vaginal
swabs) and cervical specimens collected in PreservCyt Solution. Pooled CT/NG negative
urine specimens were included in the study. Positive samples were prepared by co-spiking
a portion of the negative samples with CT and NG cultures to a concentration that
generated a Ct value ~20 cycles representing the Ct value lower than that observed in 95%
of positive results in the intended use population. Three runs consisting of a checkerboard
pattern of positive CT and NG samples alternating with negative samples were performed,
followed by a full run of CT/NG negative samples to assess run-to-run contamination.
Two CT/NG negative urine samples out of 144 total negative samples tested positive for
both CT and NG within one of the checkerboard runs (2/144, 1.4%). The total sample-to-
sample cross-contamination rate of cobas CT/NG for all sample types for the three
checkerboard runs was determined to be 0.5% (2/432). Run-to-run cross-contamination
was not observed (0/282).
h. Competitive Inhibition Studies:
To assess competitive inhibition between CT and NG, contrived specimens were tested
with low and moderate concentrations of one target mixed with very high concentrations
29

--- Page 30 ---
of the opposite target. Low and moderate concentrations were defined as ~1x LoD and
~3x LoD, respectively, and high concentrations were defined as generating a Ct value that
was lower than the value observed in 95% of CT and NG positive specimens. Positive test
samples were prepared by spiking CT serovar D and NG strain 2948 cultures into negative
background matrix prepared for each specimen type by pooling pre-screened specimens
negative for both CT and NG. Specimen types evaluated were: 1. vaginal swab collected
in cobas PCR media (intended to represent both endocervical and vaginal swab samples),
2. urine mixed with cobas PCR media, and 3. cervical specimens collected in PreservCyt
Solution. Five replicates of each panel member were tested. Additional samples were
prepared for the vaginal swab matrix containing CT at a high concentration and NG at 0.4
CFU/ml, 0.65 CFU/ml, and 1.95 CFU/ml. These concentrations of NG represent LoD as
determined by the observed 95% hit rate, the upper limit for the Probit estimate of the
LoD, and 3X of the upper limit for the Probit estimate of the LoD, respectively.
Results indicate that CT was detected at or above the LoD in all specimen types even
when NG was present at a high concentration. When CT was present at high
concentrations, NG was detected in 100% of specimens (all types) at moderate levels
(~3X LoD), and for cervical and urine specimens NG was also detected in 100% of
specimens at low levels (~1X LoD). For vaginal swab specimens, when CT was present at
high concentrations, NG was detected in 35% (7 of 20) of replicates at 0.4 CFU/ml, 60%
(12 of 20) of replicates at 0.65 CFU/ml, and 100% (20 of 20) of replicates at 1.95 CFU/ml.
A limitation is included in the package insert describing the identified competitive
inhibition.
i. Interferences:
Testing of Exogenous Substances:
Performance of the cobas CT/NG assay for use on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems was
evaluated in the presence of potentially interfering exogenous substances including
over-the counter products and prescription drugs that may be present in urogenital
specimens. Specimen types evaluated were: 1. vaginal swabs collected in cobas PCR
media (intended to represent both endocervical and vaginal swab samples), 2. urine
mixed with cobas PCR media, and 3. cervical specimens collected in PreservCyt
Solution. Testing was performed using negative background matrix prepared for each
specimen type by pooling pre-screened specimens negative for both CT and NG. The
negative matrices were spiked with potential interferents at levels expected from normal
patient usage. Interferents were tested in CT/NG negative specimen pools as well as in
specimen pools co-spiked with serovars D or I of Chlamydia trachomatis and strains
2948 or 891 of Neisseria gonorrhoeae at ~3x LoD.
Five replicates of each sample for each specimen type were tested with the potential
interfents, except for RepHresh Odor Eliminating Vaginal Gel And RepHresh Clean
Balance Gel for which two replicates each were tested to verify interference observed with
Replens, a product with similar formulation. In addition, one sample for each specimen type
was tested without the addition of potentially interfering products.

Results of the study demonstrate that 14 of the 18 exogenous substances tested did not
interfere with the performance of the assay for detection of CT and NG. Metronidazole
Vaginal Gel, RepHresh Odor Eliminating Vaginal Gel, RepHresh Clean Balance Gel and
Replens Vaginal Moisturizer showed interference leading to false negative and invalid
results in urogenital specimens at levels that may be present in patient specimens.
Limitations are included in the package insert describing assay interference.

Testing of Endogenous Substances:
Performance of cobas CT/NG was evaluated in the presence of potentially-interfering
endogenous substances including whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC), and mucus. Sample types included in the study were: 1. endocervical swabs
collected in cobas PR media (intended to represent both endocervical and vaginal swab
samples), 2. urine mixed with cobas PCR media, and 3. cervical specimens collected in
PreservCyt Solution. Interferents were tested in CT/NG negative specimen pools as well as
in specimen pools spiked with serovars D or I of Chlamydia trachomatis and strains 2948
or 891 of Neisseria gonorrhoeae at ~ 3x LoD. The endogenous substances were introduced
to the negative and positive samples at levels that may be present in typical clinical
specimens. Five replicates of each sample for each specimen type were tested with each
potentially interfering substance, and one sample for each specimen type was tested
without the addition of the potentially interfering substance.

Mucus at a concentration of approximately 1% (w/v) caused false negative results for NG
in endocervical samples. Whole blood caused interference at 10% (v/v) in CT/NG negative
and positive urine samples and in CT/NG positive PreservCyt samples.
Limitations are included in the package insert describing endogenous substances that
demonstrated interference with cobas CT/NG. A summary of endogenous substances

The clinical performance of cobas CT/NG was established in a multi-site, prospective
collection study by comparing the results to a Patient Infected Status (PIS) that used a
combination of FDA-cleared NAATs for urogenital specimens in each patient. Female and
male urogenital specimens were collected at nine geographically diverse sites in the US,
which included family planning and obstetrics/gynecology (OB/GYN) clinics and sexually
transmitted disease clinics. The testing was performed at four laboratory testing sites
(three external and one internal).

Prospectively enrolled female subjects provided the following urogenital specimens: first-
void urine, three vaginal swabs, one endocervical swab in cobas PCR Media, and one
cervical sample in PreservCyt Solution. If the female was in the clinician-collected vaginal
swab arm of the study, two of the vaginal swabs were placed in the respective
manufacturers’ collection device and one in cobas PCR Media. If the female subject was
in the self-collected vaginal swab arm of the study, then one vaginal swab was self-
collected first and placed into cobas PCR Media and then followed by the two clinician-
collected vaginal swabs placed in the two respective manufacturers’ collection devices.
Prospectively enrolled male subjects provided a urine specimen that was aliquoted into the
respective manufacturers’ collection device and cobas PCR Media.
Subjects were classified as symptomatic if they self-reported symptoms indicative of a CT
or NG infection, as listed below. Subjects were classified as asymptomatic if they did not
report any of these symptoms.
· Dysuria (pain during urination)
· Coital pain, difficulty or bleeding
· Pelvic pain
· Abnormal vaginal discharge
· Pelvic, uterine or ovarian pain
· Urethral discharge
· Testicular pain
· Scrotal pain or swelling
Specimens were tested for CT and NG using cobas CT/NG and FDA-cleared
commercially available NAATs. All tests were run according to the respective
manufacturers’ Instructions For Use.
The clinical performance of cobas CT/NG was evaluated by comparing the results from
collected specimen types to a pre-specified PIS (Patient Infected Status) algorithm as
determined by the combined results from two FDA-cleared NAATs for females and three
FDA-cleared NAATs for males. The PIS algorithms for Female and Male subjects are
shown in the Tables 20 and 21.
Archived prospectively collected female urine, cervical specimens in PreservCyt, and
endocervical swabs were obtained for the clinical study for cobas CT/NG v2 test on the
cobas 4800 System. The PIS of these specimens were already determined during the
clinical study for cobas CT/NG v2 test on the cobas 4800 System. NG PIS infected female
subjects who had specimens with adequate volume for NG testing with cobas CT/NG
assay were included in the current study. In addition, a random subset of specimens from
NG PIS non-infected females was also included. Stability of archived specimens was
evaluated. Some archived specimens were not tested due to volume limitation, therefore,
in addition, Ct value distributions from the original study for archived tested specimens
and specimens not tested due to volume limitations were reviewed. This analysis
supported that the use of the archived specimens will provide an unbiased estimation of
33

a One or more positives in each NAAT (NAAT1 and NAAT2) designates the PIS as Infected. Any other
combination of results defines the PIS as Not Infected.
b In the scenario where one or more of the sample types are invalid, the remaining sample types with valid results
from NAAT1 and NAAT2 must have concordant positive or concordant negative results to determine the PIS as
Infected or Not Infected, respectively. For all other cases where one or more of the sample types are invalid, the
PIS is indeterminate.

Primary objectives for the study included the evaluation of the sensitivity (SENS),
specificity (SPEC), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV)

of cobas CT/NG for the detection of CT or NG using the PIS as the composite reference
method and evaluated by gender, sample type, and symptom status. Predictive values were
calculated based on overall sensitivity and specificity (with all data combined for males
and females) for a range of hypothetical prevalence values.
Of the 5,197 subjects prospectively enrolled, 5,105 were eligible for inclusion. Of the
5,105 eligible subjects contributing prospective specimens, 5,053 (99.0%) (3,860 females
and 1,193 males) were evaluable and were included in the data analyses. A total of 52
subjects (1.0%) were classified as non-evaluable and excluded from all statistical analyses
because of deviations rendering samples non-evaluable, indeterminate PIS, or invalid
cobas CT/NG results after initial testing and/or retesting. In addition, a total of 371
archived urogenital samples (urine, cervical specimens in PreservCyt, and endocervical
swabs) prospectively collected from 295 female subjects were tested in this clinical study.
Of the 17,169 fresh prospective samples tested in this study (including 281 samples that
required repeat testing), 19 samples exhibited invalid results on the first run (invalid rate of
0.11% (95% CI: 0.07%; 0.17%)). Upon repeat testing, 3 samples exhibited valid results.
Clinical Study Results for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT)
Tables 22 and 23 summarize the results from symptomatic and asymptomatic female and
male subjects designated as infected or non-infected with CT according to the PIS
algorithm. A total of 271 females and 118 males were infected with CT. Symptoms were
reported in 45.8% (124/271) of infected and 36.7% (1318/3589) of non-infected women.
Similarly, symptoms were reported in 53.4% (63/118) of infected and 22.5% (242/1074)
of non-infected men.

Note: In the scenario where one or more of the sample types are invalid/not available, for female subjects, the
remaining sample types with valid results from NAAT1 and NAAT2 must have concordant positive or concordant
negative results to determine the PIS as Infected or Non-Infected, respectively. For all other cases where one or

Clinical Study Results for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG)
Tables 25 and 26 summarize the results from symptomatic and asymptomatic female and
male subjects designated as infected or non-infected with NG according to the PIS
algorithm. A total of 57 females and 87 males were infected with NG. Symptoms were
reported in 45.6% (26/57) of infected and 37.2% (1416/3803) of non-infected females.
Symptoms were reported in 94.3% (82/87) of infected and 20.2% (223/1105) of non-
infected males.

a NAAT1, NAAT2, and NAAT3 = FDA-cleared CT/NG Assays
b Symp = symptomatic, Asymp = asymptomatic.
*One subject was missing symptom status and is not included in this table.
Note: If at least 2 out of the 3 test results, for male subjects, are concordant positive or negative then the PIS can
be considered as infected or non-infected, respectively. If one test result is invalid/not available (NA) and the other
two test results are discordant then the PIS is indeterminate. If 2 or 3 test results are invalid/not available, then the
PIS is indeterminate.
Note: Male subjects with designated patient infection status (Infected or Non-Infected) and final valid
cobas CT/NG test results are considered evaluable and included in this summary table.
Note: + denotes Positive, - denotes Negative, NA denotes Not Available.
Note: UR = urine.
Note: cobas Invalid are the sum of instrument amplification/detection errors and samples excluded due to protocol
deviations.
Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of cobas CT/NG for NG as defined by PIS
are presented by gender, sample type, and symptom status in Table 27 (prospective and
archived prospectively collected specimens).

negative results to determine the PIS as Infected or Non-Infected, respectively. For all other cases where one or
more of the sample types are invalid/ not available, the PIS is indeterminate.
Note: If at least 2 out of the 3 test results, for male subjects, are concordant positive or negative then the PIS can be
considered as Infected or Non-Infected, respectively. If one test result is invalid/not available and the other two test
results are discordant then the PIS is indeterminate. If 2 or 3 test results are invalid/not available, then the PIS is
indeterminate.
Note: Subjects with designated patient infection status (Infected or Non-Infected) and final valid cobas CT/NG test
results are considered evaluable and included in this summary table. An evaluable subject may not have all available
sample types or valid test results.
Note: Archived prospectively collected specimens were from COB-CTNG-282 study and included female PIS
positive subjects that have available sample with adequate volume for testing.
Note: CI = confidence interval, PREV = prevalence, SENS = sensitivity, SPEC = specificity, PPV = positive
predictive value, NPV = negative predictive value.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The prevalence of CT and NG in patient populations depends on a variety of factors including
age, gender, the presence of symptoms, clinic type, and test method. The positivity rate of CT
observed with cobas CT/NG during this multi-site clinical study was 7.2% overall. The
overall positivity rate of NG observed with cobas CT/NG for the prospective and archived
prospectively collected samples was 2.7%.
The following two tables illustrate hypothetical positive and negative predictive values for the
detection of CT and NG with cobas CT/NG for potential prevalence of 1 to 50%. The overall
sensitivity and specificity used for these calculations were derived from the clinical study
results for all specimen types and females and males combined (prospective specimens only).

Note: PPV = Positive predictive value, NPV = Negative predictive value.
a The overall sensitivity and specificity were estimated by comparing the cobas CT/NG Test results to
patient infected status across all sample types in both female and male subjects.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimens are collected using the appropriate ancillary kits (cobas PCR Media Dual Swab
Sample Kit, cobas PCR Media Uni Swab Sample Kit, or cobas PCR Urine Sample Kit) or
PreservCyt Solution as per defined instructions. Swab specimens containing a single swab
in the cobas PCR Media tube can be directly processed on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems,
or the swab may be removed prior to loading onto the instrument. Urine specimens must
show a liquid level between two black indicator lines on the cobas PCR Media tube to
proceed to testing. Cervical specimens in PreservCyt Solution are to be aliquoted into
barcoded cobas PCR Secondary tubes for processing. Only racks of uncapped tubes may
be loaded into the Sample Supply Module of the cobas 6800/8800 Systems for testing.
Specimen processing is fully automated.
