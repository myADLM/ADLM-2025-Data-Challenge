H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Granada Medium is a selective and differential agar which is intended for the qualitative
detection of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) from LIM Broth enrichment cultures of
vaginal/rectal swabs from antepartum women following 18-24 hours of incubation.
Recovery of orange colored colonies on Granada Medium is a positive result for
presence of β-hemolytic GBS. Results can be interpreted after18-24 hours of anaerobic
incubation. Due to the properties of Granada Medium, white colonies recovered on
Granada Medium must undergo additional testing to confirm absence of GBS.
Subculture of GBS colonies must be performed for conducting susceptibility testing as
recommended for penicillin allergic women. A lack of growth or the absence of orange
colonies on Granada Medium does not preclude the presence of GBS. Granada Medium
is not intended to diagnose infection, or to guide or monitor treatment for infections.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as the Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription Use only
White colonies on Granada Medium after 18-24 hours incubation are considered
presumptive negative for GBS and must be confirmed by additional testing to rule-out
presence of weakly β-hemolytic or non-hemolytic GBS.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
Granada Medium is a selective and differential medium used for the detection of
Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae, GBS) colonization in pregnant women by testing
LIM Broth enriched cultures of vaginal/rectal swabs. Color development (light orange to
dark orange color) is a unique characteristic of β-hemolytic GBS strains resulting from
colored pigment production in the presence of substrates such as starch, peptone, serum, and
folate pathway inhibitors. Non-hemolytic GBS cannot be detected by color production, but
can be recovered from Granada Medium by evaluating white colonies growing on the
medium. Growth of microorganisms belonging to other species is either inhibited, or if there
is growth, the colonies do not produce the expected color reaction.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Not Applicable
L. Test Principle:
Granada Medium is a selective, differential medium for the detection of GBS. The ability to
detect β-hemolytic GBS is based on the presence of selective agents that suppress growth of
organisms other than GBS, and the presence of components necessary for pigment
production (color development) that allow the detection of β-hemolytic GBS. Granada
Medium also supports the growth of non-hemolytic GBS, which are identified by additional
testing of white colonies growing on the culture medium. After vaginal/rectal swabs from
antepartum women are enriched in LIM Broth, an aliquot of culture is inoculated directly
onto Granada Medium and incubated anaerobically at 35°C for 18-24 hours. Plates are
examined after incubation for the development of light orange to dark orange colored
colonies. Plates with no growth, or where testing of white colonies ruled-out the presence of
GBS, are considered negative.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated at three sites using an 11-member panel, which
included 5 hemolytic GBS strains, 1 non-hemolytic GBS strain, and 5 non-GBS
strains (as the negative controls). At each site, panel members were tested in
duplicate on Granada Medium each day for five days—GBS strains (near 103
CFU/ml) and non-targets strains (107 CFU/ml) resulting in 660 total test results.

To evaluate the performance of Granada Medium after an overnight enrichment in
LIM Broth, LIM Broth was spiked with two β-hemolytic ATCC strains of Group B
Streptococci (Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 12386 and Streptococcus agalactiae
ATCC 12403) prepared in GBS-negative vaginal/rectal specimen matrix at 10-fold
decreasing concentrations. After overnight enrichment, the LIM Broth culture was
subcultured to Granada Medium and evaluated for color reaction. The lowest GBS
concentration (previously spiked in LIM Broth and incubated overnight) yielding
expected results on Granada Medium was then confirmed with five replicate
dilutions of the lowest concentration. Following overnight enrichment in LIM Broth,
Granada Medium was able to recover both GBS strains originally spiked at
approximately 4.5 CFU (1 - 9 CFU). Blood agar plates were used to determine the
concentrations of organisms present in each dilution.
Analytical Reactivity
A study was conducted to demonstrate the sensitivity of Granada Medium in
detecting various GBS strains at a concentration of 102 CFU/ml. A 100 µl aliquot of
bacterial suspension prepared in saline was plated onto Granada Medium. The study
included 54 ATCC reference and clinical GBS strains representing seven of the nine
different serotypes; forty-eight strains were hemolytic and six were non-hemolytic.
Plates were read at 24 hours of incubation for colony counts and orange color
development (indicative of β-hemolytic GBS). The inclusivity panel and the
observed colony color on Granada Medium are shown in Table 2.

demonstrated that Granada Medium was able to grow all non-hemolytic GBS strains
tested at the LoD (102 CFU/ml).
Incubation Study
An Incubation Study was conducted to determine the effect of various incubation
times on the performance of Granada Medium when tested with ten GBS strains
(hemolytic and non-hemolytic) at 102 CFU/ml. A 100 µl aliquot of bacterial
suspension prepared in saline was plated onto Granada Medium. The recovery of
organisms and development of characteristic color on Granada plates were evaluated
every 2 hours from 18-48 hours. At the earliest time point (18 hours), all β-hemolytic
organisms produced an orange color reaction. The one non-hemolytic strain tested
showed white colonies at each incubation time from 18-48 hours. The earliest
incubation time for positive detection of GBS by color development was set at 18
hours. The incubation range for Granada medium was reported as 18-24 hours.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-Reactivity Study
In order to evaluate the performance of Granada Medium with microorganisms
potentially encountered in vaginal/rectal swabs or related to GBS, a Cross-Reactivity
Study was completed with 69 non-target organisms (gram negative bacteria, gram
positive bacteria, and yeast). Using a 10 µl loop, non-target organisms were streaked
onto Granada Medium from a 108 CFU/ml suspension of cells. Results showed that
all 69 organisms from the cross-reactivity panel produced a negative result with
Granada Medium (no growth or non-orange colonies). A total of 35 organisms
(50.7%) were recovered on Granada Medium after 24 hours incubation. The cross-
reactivity panel is shown in Table 3.

Cross-Reactivity from LIM Broth Enrichment
In a separate study, eighty-four organisms that are phylogenetically-related to Group
B Streptococci or potentially encountered in a vaginal-rectal swab were tested on
Granada Medium following overnight enrichment in LIM Broth. 1.5x106 CFU of
each organism was inoculated into a LIM Broth tube. After 24 hours incubation,
each LIM Broth culture tube was subcultured to a Granada Medium plate using a 10
μl loop and evaluated for growth and color reaction after 24 hours of anaerobic
incubation. All organisms tested were considered to produce no cross reaction.
Organisms tested either produced a negative color reaction (39/84, 46.4%) or were
not recovered (45/84, 53.6%) on Granada Medium after LIM Broth enrichment.
Interference Study
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of potentially interfering
substances commonly found in vaginal/rectal swab specimens on the detection of six
hemolytic GBS strains. Twenty-one substances (Table 4) were tested at
physiologically or biologically relevant concentrations and mixed with bacterial
suspensions in GBS-negative specimen matrix. A 30 µl aliquot of GBS suspension
(9-90 CFU) was inoculated into LIM Broth and incubated at 35°C. After overnight
incubation, a 10 µl aliquot of LIM Broth culture was inoculated onto Granada
Medium. Growth and development of color were evaluated after 18 hours and 24
hours incubation on Granada Medium. No interference on Granada Medium was
observed for any substance (at the highest clinically relevant concentration) when
GBS was prepared in negative specimen matrix and enriched in LIM Broth in the
presence of potentially interfering substances.

Microbial Interference Study
A Microbial Interference Study was conducted to demonstrate that high levels of
non-target organism would not suppress color development and recovery of GBS
(Streptococcus agalactiae, ATCC 12386 and Streptococcus agalactiae, ATCC
12403). Organisms that were recovered from Granada Medium in the Cross-
Reactivity Studies were tested in the Microbial Interference Study. Non-target
organisms at a concentration of 3 x108 CFU/ml were mixed 1:1 with 1.5 x104
CFU/ml of target organism and streaked for isolation onto Granada Medium with a
10 µl loop. If the target organism was not recovered, the concentration of the non-
target organism was lowered 10-fold until the target organism was recovered. A total
of 51 non-target organism strains were included in the study.
At 24 hours, both GBS strains gave expected results (orange colonies of the
appropriate size) in the presence of 42 non-target organisms in the Microbial
Interference Study. However, GBS in the presence of the following 10 non-target
organisms produced unexpected results: Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212),
Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 51299), Enterococcus avium (ATCC 14025),
Enterococcus gallinarium (ATCC 49573), Enterococcus saccharolyticus (ATCC
43076), Lactococcus lactis (ATCC 19435), Morganella morganii (ATCC 25830),
Proteus mirabilis (ATCC 43071), Serratia marcescens (ATCC 13880), and Vibrio
parahaemolyticus (ATCC 17802). In the presence of 1.5x108 CFU/ml of
Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), both strains of GBS were not recovered on
Granada Medium; however, when Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) was
reduced to 1.5x107 CFU/ml, GBS strain ATCC 12403 was recovered (a further
reduction to 1.5x106 CFU/ml allowed for the recovery of GBS strain ATCC 12386).

Microbial Interference Study, it was observed that the colony size of one or both
GBS was affected when the non-target organism was tested at 1.5x108 CFU/ml.
When these non-target organisms were inoculated onto Granada Medium at 1.5x107
CFU/ml in the presence of GBS, it was reported that GBS colony size was larger and
more clearly visible in the mixed culture. Also, in the presence of 1.5x108 CFU/ml
Vibrio parahaemolyticus, GBS colonies appeared as light orange colonies. The
expected color (dark orange) was observed when the Vibrio parahaemolyticus
concentration was reduced to 1.5x107 CFU/ml. Inhibition of growth and changes in
colony size/color with these specific non-target organisms are noted as Limitations
in the product labeling.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Granada Medium was evaluated at four clinical sites. A total of 884 vaginal/rectal
swabs from pregnant women were prospectively collected and inoculated per
protocol into LIM broth, followed by subculture onto Granada Medium. Due to
protocol deviations (enrollment criteria not met), 108 specimens were excluded from
the study, leaving 776 swab specimens for evaluating GBS detection by Granada
Medium. An additional 5 samples were excluded due to improper storage (time of
set-up) as specified by the clinical study protocol. In total, 771 protocol compliant
specimens were included in the final performance calculations.
To evaluate performance of Granada Medium, LIM Broth enriched cultures
(vaginal/rectal swabs inoculated and incubated in LIM Broth overnight) were
subcultued onto Granada Medium plates and streaked for isolation. Granada plates
were incubated under anaerobic atmosphere for 18-24 hours at 35-37°C. For the
Reference Culture Method, vaginal/rectal specimens were tested by inoculating LIM
Broth with 30 µl of specimen from the transport swab system and incubating for 24
hours at 35-37°C. LIM Broth cultures were subcultured to Tryptic Soy Agar with 5%
Sheep Blood, and all colonies with characteristic appearance suggestive of GBS
11

were screened to confirm the presence of GBS (both hemolytic and non-hemolytic
strains) using established laboratory methods: gram stain, catalase, latex
agglutination.
Results of Granada Medium from 18-24 hours incubation were compared to the
Reference Culture Method. Growth and color development on Granada Medium
were observed after 18-24 hours. Growth of orange colonies was representative of a
positive result for the presence of GBS. White colonies growing on the media were
subject to biochemical testing to identify non-hemolytic GBS. Tables 5-7 below
show the clinical performance data for Granada Medium vs the Reference Culture
Method (all sites). Performance (sensitivity and specificity) of Granada Medium was
calculated based on color development and the recovery of GBS from the medium
and compared to the recovery of β-hemolytic GBS and total GBS strains by the
Reference Culture Method.
All isolates with discrepant results were frozen in CryoSavers with Brucella Broth
and returned to Hardy Diagnostics for testing. The identity of each isolate was
confirmed (β-hemolytic GBS, non-hemolytic GBS, or non-GBS isolate). Once the
identity was confirmed, positive organisms (β-hemolytic GBS or non-hemolytic
GBS) were tested in donated GBS negative-vaginal/rectal matrix for their recovery
from the LIM Broth Culture Reference Method and color development on Granada
Medium.

1There were 12 False Positives observed after 18 to 24 hours of incubation. All isolates were re-
tested and confirmed by the discrepant analysis protocol above. Ten isolates recovered from
Granada Medium were confirmed to be β-hemolytic GBS. Two isolates were recorded as pale
orange on Granada Medium by the clinical site, but were not identified as GBS. During discrepant
analysis, both isolates were confirmed to be Streptococcus salivarius subsp. salivarius. Upon

additional analysis, one Streptococcus salivarius subs. salivarious isolate exhibited yellow colonies
on Granada Medium and the other isolate grew as pale orange colonies on Granada Medium.
2There were 9 False Negatives observed after 18 to 24 hours of incubation. All isolates were re-
tested and confirmed by the discrepant analysis protocol above. Of these nine GBS isolates
recovered by the Reference Method, three were β-hemolytic and six were non-hemolytic. For the β-
hemolytic GBS isolates identified by the Reference Method and evaluated by discordant analysis,
all three isolates grew as orange colonies on Granada Medium, where originally the colony color
was observed as white at the clinical site. Samples where the six non-hemolytic Group B
Streptococci were identified by the Reference Method showed white colonies on Granada Medium
as expected (no discordant analysis was performed for these isolates).

1Considering that non-hemolytic GBS cannot be detected by the medium’s color change and
require additional identification, there were six specimens that were found to contain non-
hemolytic GBS strains upon subculture and identification by the Reference Method. If these
specimens are included as negatives, then the overall sensitivity and specificity values observed
when comparing the recovery of β-hemolytic GBS by the LIM Reference Method to the Granada
Medium color development can also be evaluated.

c Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not Applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not Applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The overall prevalence of GBS (both hemolytic and non-hemolytic strains) by the
Reference Culture Method was 21.1% (163/771).
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10
