H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Dimension Hemoglobin A1c assay is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative
determination of %HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP) and mmol/mol HbA1c (IFCC) in human
anticoagulated venous whole blood for use on the Dimension clinical chemistry system.
Measurement of Hemoglobin A1c is used as an aid in diagnosis of diabetes and
monitoring of long-term blood glucose control in patients with diabetes mellitus and as
an aid in the identification of patients at risk for developing diabetes mellitus.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s)
The Dimension Hemoglobin A1c assay has significant interference with fetal hemoglobin
(HbF). Samples containing HbF may produce a negative bias (lower than actual results)
with the Dimension Hemoglobin A1c assay. Hemoglobin A1c results are invalid for
patients with abnormal amounts of HbF, including those with known Hereditary
Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin. For additional information on the interference of the
HbF variant, refer to Interfering Substances.
For prescription use only
The Dimension Hemoglobin A1C Assay is designed only for accurate and precise
measurement of mmol/mol HbA1c (IFCC) and % HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP). The individual
results for total Hb and HbA1c concentration are not reported.
The Dimension A1C assay should not be used to diagnose diabetes during pregnancy.
Hemoglobin A1c reflects the average blood glucose levels over the preceding 3 months
(the average life span of a red blood cell) and therefore may be falsely low during
pregnancy or any other condition associated with recent onset of hyperglycemia and/or
decreased red blood cell survival.
The Dimension A1C assay should not be used to diagnose or monitor diabetes in patients
with the following conditions: hemoglobinopathies except as demonstrated to produce
acceptable performance (such as, sickle cell trait), abnormal red blood cell turnover (such
as, anemias from hemolysis and iron deficiency), malignancies, and severe chronic
hepatic and renal disease.
In cases of rapidly evolving Type 1 diabetes, the increase of HbA1c values might be
delayed compared to the acute increase in glucose concentrations. In these conditions,
diabetes mellitus must be diagnosed based on plasma glucose concentrations and/or the
typical clinical symptoms.
This test should not replace glucose testing for patients with Type 1 diabetes, pediatric
patients or pregnant women.
Any cause of shortened red blood cell survival (for example, hemolytic anemia or other
2

--- Page 3 ---
hemolytic diseases, pregnancy, or recent significant blood loss) will reduce the exposure
of red blood cells to glucose with a consequent decrease in A1c values, Results of HbA1c
are not reliable in patients with chronic blood loss and consequent variable erythrocyte
lifespan
4. Special instrument requirements
Performance data below was collected on the Dimension RxL Clinical Chemistry
System.
I. Device Description:
The Dimension Hemoglobin A1c assay consists of three reagents packaged in Dimension
Flex cartridges, that contain the antibody, buffers and reagents, are used with the Dimension
RxL instrument. The HbA1c measurement is based on a turbidimetric inhibition
immunoassay principle, and the measurement of total hemoglobin is based on a modification
of the alkaline hematin reaction. Using the values obtained for each of these two analytes, the
relative proportion of the total hemoglobin that is glycated is calculated and reported.

L. Test Principle:
HbA1c determination is based on the turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay (TINIA) for
hemolyzed whole blood. Glycohemoglobin in the sample reacts with anti-HbA1c to form
soluble antigen-antibody complexes. Polyhaptens react with excess anti-HbA1c to form an
insoluble antibody-polyhapten complex which can be measured turbidimetrically. This
method uses tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB) as the detergent in the
hemolyzing reagent. Sample pretreatment to remove labile HbA1c is not necessary. The
instrument calculates the %HbA1c from the HbA1c/Hb ratio according to a user selected
protocol and the percentage of HbA1c is displayed as the % HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Samples consisted of two (2) commercial quality controls (BioRad QC) and four (4)
venous whole blood patient pools in K2-EDTA with target values of 5.0%, 6.5%,

NGSP (%HbA1c) 0.9719 0.3264 0.9986
IFCC (mmol/mol) 0.9774 2.1431 0.9976
The linearity results support the claimed reportable measuring range of 3.8-14.0 %
HbA1c (18 to 130 mmol/mol).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Hemoglobin A1C assay on the Dimension RxL system is certified with the
National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). See NGSP website for
current certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) units of mmol/mol are
calculated using the Master Equation NGSP (%) = 0.09148 x IFCC (mmol/mol) +
2.152. HbA1c results are provided to the customers using two different units: NGSP
equivalent units (%) and IFCC equivalent units (mmol/mol).
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) testing was conducted in
accordance with CLSI EP17-A2, Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical
Laboratory Measurement Procedures. LoB and LoD were determined for HbA1c (%),
total hemoglobin (tHb) (g/dL) and HbA1c (g/dL).
LoB testing was performed over three testing days by one operator using one
instrument and two kit lots. One calibration was performed for each kit lot (total of
two). On each testing day, five replicate measurements were taken for each of five
blank samples for a total of 75 replicates for each kit lot.
LoD testing was performed over three testing days by one operator using one
instrument and two kit lots. One calibration was performed for each kit lot (total of
two). On each testing day, four replicate measurements were taken for each of five (5)
low level patient samples for a total of 75 total replicates for each kit lot.

iii. Cross Reactivity with Hemoglobin Derivatives
Testing to evaluate potential interference of hemoglobin derivatives on the
Dimension Hemoglobin A1c Assay was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2,
Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline – Second
Edition.
The effect of each hemoglobin derivative was evaluated using a paired difference
analysis that compared HbA1c values between control samples (Anticoagulated
K2-EDTA venous whole blood) and test samples (Anticoagulated K2-EDTA
venous whole blood spiked with the derivative being tested). Four replicates were

performance, the sponsor evaluated the assay’s HbA1c recovery of venous whole
blood K2-EDTA patient samples with known HbA1c, HbA1a, HbA1b, and HbA0
concentrations. The highest concentrations tested with no interference were 2.2,
1.0, and 84.1% for HbA1a, HbA1b, and HbA0, respectively. The data support the
sponsor’s claim that HbA0, HbA1a, and HbA1b do not interfere with assay
results.
iv. Hemoglobin Variants
Interference testing to determine the effect of hemoglobin variants on the Dimension
Hemoglobin A1c Assay was performed in accordance with CLSI EP07-A2,
Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline – Second Edition.
Anticoagulated (K2-EDTA) human venous whole blood samples with known
concentrations of hemoglobin variant were obtained from several commercial
sources. The effect of each hemoglobin variant on assay performance was evaluated
by analyzing these samples and comparing the %HbA1c values obtained by using
the candidate assay on the Dimension RxL system to comparator %HbA1c values
obtained on the Trinity Biotech Ultra 2 (HbC, HbD, HbE, HbS, HbA2), Tosoh HLC-
723G8 (HbA2, HbF), and Bio-Rad Variant II Turbo (HbC). Four replicates were
tested for each sample. Results are shown below:
