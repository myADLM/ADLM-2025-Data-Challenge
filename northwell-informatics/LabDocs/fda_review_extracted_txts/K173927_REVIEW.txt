H. Intended Use/ Indications for Use:
1. Intended Use/ Indications for Use:
Immunoassay for the in vitro quantitative determination of PCT (procalcitonin) in human
serum and plasma (K2 –EDTA, K3-EDTA and Li-Heparin).
The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on Elecsys and
cobas e immunoassay analyzers.
Used in conjunction with other laboratory findings and clinical assessments, Elecsys
BRAHMS PCT is intended for use as follows:
· to aid in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of ICU
admission for progression to severe sepsis and septic shock,
· to determine the change in PCT level over time as an aid in assessing the cumulative
28-day risk of all-cause mortality for patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic
shock in the ICU or when obtained in the emergency department or other medical
wards prior to ICU admission,
· to aid in decision making on antibiotic therapy, for inpatients or patients in the
emergency department with suspected or confirmed lower respiratory tract infections
(LRTI) – defined as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute bronchitis, and
acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD),
· to aid in decision making on antibiotic discontinuation for patients with suspected or
confirmed sepsis.
2. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
Warnings and Precautions:
The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay should not be used as a sole basis for diagnosis for
determining the risk of 28 day all-cause mortality. Changes in PCT should always be
interpreted in the context of the clinical status of the patient and other laboratory results.
There is no uniformly recognized interpretation of the change in PCT levels for the
prediction of mortality, and overall mortality is strongly dependent on many factors,
including pre-existing patient risk factors and clinical course. The need for continued ICU
care at Day 4 and other covariates (e.g., age, sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA
score) are also significant predictors of 28-day cumulative mortality risk. Validation of the
Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay as an aid in predicting mortality was performed in a study
population with an overall 28-day mortality of 22%.

Total assay duration: 18 minutes.
· 1st incubation: Antigen in the sample (30 μL), a biotinylated monoclonal PCT-specific
antibody, and a monoclonal PCT-specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium complex*) react
to form a sandwich complex.
· 2nd incubation: After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex becomes
bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin.
· The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are
magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then
removed. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission
which is measured by a photomultiplier.
· Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument specific, generated by 2-
point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Reproducibility/Precision:
The repeatability and intermediate precision studies of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay were
conducted using the cobas e 411 analyzer. Studies were performed in accordance with CLSI
guideline EP5-A3, “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement
Methods”. One reagent lot was evaluated.
The precision study was conducted using the study design of 21 days x 2 runs per day x 2
replicates per sample. One (1) instrument was used for the study and calibration was performed
according to the Instructions for Use. Aliquots of sixteen (16) human serum samples and two
(2) QC samples (PC PCT 1 and PC PCT 2) distributed over the measuring range were assayed
in duplicate and randomized order on the cobas e 411 analyzer using one lot of reagent.

Exogenous Interference:
Fifteen pharmaceutical compounds were spiked into two human serum sample pools of
different PCT concentrations. Each serum sample was evaluated both with and without the
potential interference substances and tested with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay on the
Elecsys 2010 analyzer.
The following substances evaluated with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay were found not to
affect the test performance at concentrations reasonably and consistently found in clinical
situations.

See K160729 for study design and data.
There was no HAMA interference observed.
i. High-Dose Hook Effect:
There was no observed high-dose hook effect at PCT concentrations up to 1,000 ng/mL PCT.
j. Assay Cut-off:
28-day mortality:
· ΔPCT ≤ 80%
A decrease in the PCT levels below or equal to 80% defines a positive ΔPCT test
result representing a higher risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients diagnosed
with severe sepsis or septic shock.
· ΔPCT > 80%
A decrease in the PCT levels of more than 80% defines a negative ΔPCT test result
representing a lower risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients diagnosed with
severe sepsis or septic shock.
NOTE: The combination of the first PCT level (≤ 2.0 ng/mL or > 2.0 ng/mL) at initial
diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock with the patient’s clinical course and the change in
PCT level over time until Day 4 provides important additional information about the mortality
risk.
Progression Risk:
· PCT > 2 μg/L
A PCT level above 2.0 μg/L on the first day of ICU admission is associated with a high
risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.
· PCT < 0.5 μg/L
A PCT level below 0.5 μg/L on the first day of ICU admission is associated with a low

LRTI Antibiotic Decision Making:
· PCT < 0.10 ng/mL
Antibiotic therapy strongly discouraged.
· PCT 0.10-0.25 ng/mL
Antibiotic therapy discouraged.
· PCT 0.26-0.50 ng/mL
Antibiotic therapy encouraged.
· PCT >0.50 ng/mL
Antibiotic therapy strongly encouraged.
Sepsis Antibiotic Discontinuation:
· ΔPCT > 80%
Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued
· PCT ≤ 0.50 ng/mL
Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued
Recommendations for Laboratory Reports for Initiation and Discontinuation:
The Change in Procalcitonin Calculator is available at http://www.brahms-pct-calculator.com.
The Change in Procalcitonin Calculator can be used to determine ΔPCT results. It is
suggested to report the numerical PCT values (individual or paired). For paired PCT values the
report should also indicate if the ΔPCT(%) was ≤ 80% or > 80%. The laboratory report should
include a reference or a link to the package insert for a guided interpretation of the test results.
k. Specimen Stability:
Refer to K160729 for stability data.
l. Sample Matrix Comparison:
See K160729 for study design and data.
SST is an acceptable sample type for use with the Elecsys PCT assay
Li-Heparin plasma is an acceptable sample type for use with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay
K2-EDTA plasma is an acceptable sample type for use with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay.
K3-EDTA plasma is an acceptable sample type for use with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay.
2. Clinical Studies:
13

--- Page 14 ---
The clinical performance of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was establishing with multicenter
testing of retrospective specimens available as frozen samples from adult patients (i.e., >18 years
of age) diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock who were enrolled in the BRAHMS MOSES
study from the Intensive Care Unit, the emergency department, other wards or directly from out of
hospital and subsequently admitted to the ICU.
The clinical concordance analysis in this report was performed with all available valid test results
obtained in the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT clinical performance study. The line listings of the Elecsys
BRAHMS PCT clinical performance study were included in K160729.
The clinical concordance analysis of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT clinical performance study
shows more than 97% total agreement between the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT and the BRAHMS
PCT sensitive Kryptor (predicate device) at the medical decision points 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 2.0
ng/mL. The regression slopes are within +/- 10% of identity in Passing-Bablok and Weighted
Deming Analysis. This demonstrates equivalence to the predicate device.
