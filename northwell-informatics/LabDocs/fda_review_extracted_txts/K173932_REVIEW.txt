SPECIAL 510(K): DEVICE MODIFICATION
OIR DECISION SUMMARY
510(k) Number: K173932
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the applicant’s own class
II or class I devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:
1. The name and 510(k) number of the applicant’s previously cleared device. (For a preamendments
device, a statement to this effect has been provided.)
2. Applicant’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as
described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes
instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials
(labeling changes are permitted as long as they do not affect the intended use).
3. Description of the device MODIFICATION(S):
This change was for a modification of the Alere i Influenza A & B, Alere i Strep A, Alere i RSV,
and Alere i Influenza A & B 2 algorithm was made to mitigate issues with false invalid results due
to baselines that are lower than allowed by the algorithm and incorrectly identified as Empty Tube
Values. The Norm Window baseline minimum setting was changed from 1.0 mV/s to 0.1 mV/s
for each of the assays identified above. This is an algorithm update only, there have been no
changes made to the chemistry of the assays.
The only impact of this change is related to invalid results, the threshold for positive and
negative results has not changed and there is no change to assay performance. There are no
changes to the user interface and no changes to product labeling are required. The Intended
Use of Alere i Influenza A & B, Alere i Strep A, Alere i RSV, and Alere i Influenza A
& B 2 as described in the 510k cleared labeling, has not changed because of this
modification. The modification does not alter the fundamental technology of the Alere i
Influenza A & B, Alere i Strep A, Alere i RSV, and Alere i Influenza A & B 2 assays
or the Alere i Instrument.
The unmodified and modified devices are identical in assay formulation and there has been
no change in the test procedure. The only changes are to the software as described above.
4. The FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not
changed.
5. Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to applicant’s legally marketed predicate
device including labeling, intended use, physical characteristics, and assay information:

Parameter Alere™ i Influenza A & B Alere™ i Influenza A & B

Intended Use The Alere™ i Influenza A & B assay Same
performed on the Alere™ i Instrument is a
rapid molecular in vitro diagnostic test
utilizing an isothermal nucleic acid
amplification technology for the qualitative
detection and discrimination of
influenza A and B viral RNA in nasal swabs
and nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs eluted
in viral transport media from patients with
signs and symptoms of respiratory
infection. It is intended for use as an aid
in the differential diagnosis of influenza A
and B viral infections in humans in
conjunction with clinical and
epidemiological risk factors. The assay is
not intended to detect the presence of
influenza C virus.
Negative results do not preclude influenza
virus infection and should not be used as
the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or
other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A
were established during the 2012-2013
and the 2014- 2015 influenza seasons when
influenza A/H3 and A/H1N1 pandemic were
the predominant influenza A viruses in
circulation. When other influenza A
viruses are emerging, performance
characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is
suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria
recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with
appropriate infection control precautions
for novel virulent Influenza viruses and
sent to state or local health department for
testing. Viral culture should not be
attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+
facility is available to receive and culture
specimens.

Alere i Influenza A&B
The Alere i Influenza A & B package insert will have the following footnote to the table for the
original cross-reactivity study to reflect subsequent additional cross-reactivity information—
*Some cross-reactivity was observed for Proteus vulgaris at concentrations greater than 7 x108,
Moraxella catarrhalis at concentrations greater than 2x109, and Serratia marcescens at
concentrations greater than 3 x109.
Alere i Influenza A&B 2
The Alere i package inserts will be updated to reflect the intended designation for room
temperature storage. It will now state 15-30°C for room temperature (previously this was defined
as 18-22°C).
6. A Design Control Activities Summary:
A risk assessment of the modified Alere i Instrument software was conducted and documented
according to the firm’s Quality System reqirements. This assessment included a standard Failure
Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). Base on this risk assessment, the modification made to the
software embedded on the Alere i Instrument does not affect the assay procedure and the change
is not expected to impact the performance of the test or its safety and effectiveness. Certain
validation studies were conducted to confirm that the assay performance was not negatively
impacted by the software modification. The following aspects of the system were analyzed:
· Test workflows were verified to ensure they reflect the proper settings and configuration.
· Regression testing was performed to verify that the changes to Baseline values did not
impact the core software.
· Code review was performed
· To ensure that changing the baseline did not affect previously collected data used to
support regulatory submissions, and thus product claims, CSV and/or JSON files from
verification and validations studies that were used to support product claims for each
assay were re-analyzed. Each CSV and/or JSON file was processed by the on-board
instrument algorithm via the software unit test framework. As an output of the on-
board analysis, a summary of the results was generated.
The firm provided a summary of the results from these software validation studies.

7. Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary or Statement and the Indications for
Use Enclosure.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the
indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the
applicant’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between
the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has
not changed. The applicant has provided the design control information as specified in The New
510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent
to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
