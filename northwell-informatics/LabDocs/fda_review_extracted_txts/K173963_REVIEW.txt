--- Page 2 ---
intended to be used in laboratories and provides a simple and rapid analytical screening
procedure to detect benzodiazepines in human urine. The assay is designed for use with a
number of clinical chemistry analyzers. This assay is calibrated against Oxazepam. This
product is intended to be used by trained professionals only.
The semi-quantitative mode is for the purpose of enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as
Liquid Chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC- MS/MS) or permitting
laboratories to establish quality control procedures.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative
chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
chromatography/ mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid chromatography/tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.
Clinical and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result,
particularly when preliminary results are used. For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Performance data was obtained using the Beckman AU680 clinical chemistry analyzer.
I. Device Description:
The assay consists of reagents (A and E):
Reagent A: Contains sheep polyclonal anti-benzodiazepine antibodies, glucose-6-
phosphate (G6P) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in Tris buffer with

L. Test Principle:
The DRI Benzodiazepine Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay with liquid ready-
to-use reagents. The assay uses a specific antibody which can detect benzodiazepines and
their metabolites in urine. The assay is based on the competition of an enzyme glucose- 6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) labeled drug and the drug from the urine sample for a
3

fixed amount of specific antibody binding sites. In the absence of free drug from the sample,
the enzyme-labeled drug is bound by the specific antibody and the enzyme activity is
inhibited. This phenomenon creates a relationship between drug concentration in urine and
the enzyme activity. The enzyme G6PDH activity is determined spectrophotometrically at
340 nm by measuring its ability to convert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to
NADH.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated using CLSI Guideline EP05-A3 as a guideline, at one site
with one analyzer, two operators, and two lots each of reagents, calibrators and
controls. Testing was carried out for 20 days with two runs per day, at least two hours
apart and two replicates per run in both Qualitative and Semi-quantitative modes,
giving a total of 80 determinants (n = 80). Drug-free negative urine was spiked with
oxazepam to final concentrations of -100%, -75%, -50%, -25%, below cutoff and
+25%, +50%, +75% and +100%, above cutoff, and the concentrations were
confirmed by LC-MS/MS. Results are summarized below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The primary calibrators are traceable to the oxazepam drug purchased
from a commercial source which is established at 98% purity. The concentration of
the primary calibrator stocks is confirmed by LC-MS/MS from three independent
laboratories.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-Reactivity Of Benzodiazepine Compounds and Metabolites
The cross reactivity of benzodiazepine compounds and their metabolites was
evaluated by adding known amounts of each compound to drug-free negative urine.
The specificity (cross-reactivity) study was performed using one lot of reagents,
calibrators and controls in both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. Percent
cross-reactivity was calculated as (Cut-off concentration / Lowest concentration of
cross reactant that gives a positive result) x 100. Results are summarized below:

Interference from structurally unrelated compounds was evaluated by spiking these
compounds into urine samples containing near cutoff negative (150 ng/mL) and near
cutoff positive (250 ng/mL) concentrations of oxazepam. The compounds listed in
the table below did not cause any positive or negative interference at the
concentrations shown:

Interference Testing of Endogenous Compounds
Potential interference from endogenous compounds was evaluated by spiking these
compounds into urine samples containing near cutoff negative (150 ng/mL) and near
cutoff positive (250 ng/mL) concentrations of oxazepam. The compounds or
conditions listed in the table below did not cause any positive or negative
interference, either in the qualitative or semi-quantative modes, at the concentrations
shown in the table below:

Interference Testing of Specific Gravity and pH:
Interference from specific gravity and pH was evaluated by adjusting the specific
gravity and pH of samples with near cutoff negative (150 ng/mL) and near cutoff
positive (250 ng/mL) concentrations of oxazepam. The following specific gravity or
pH levels did not cause any positive or negative interference:
Specific gravity of 1.004, 1.005, 1.007, 1.010, 1.011, 1.013, 1.019, 1.023, 1.025,
1.029.

f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration is described in the precision section, M.1.a. above.
2. Comparison studies:
A method comparison study was performed in accordance with CLSI Guideline
EP09-A3. One hundred and six patient urine samples were analyzed by the DRI
Benzodiazepine Assay in both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes and the
results were compared to LC-MS/MS. The results were the same for the qualitative
and semi-quantitative modes and are summarized below.
