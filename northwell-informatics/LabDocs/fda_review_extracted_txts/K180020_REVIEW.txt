E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The HemoScreen is a point-of-care (POC), automated hematology analyzer that provides
results for CBC parameters and a 5-part leukocyte differential, in capillary and venous
whole blood samples. The HemoScreen system is a tabletop device and is comprised of
the following components: HemoScreen reader (analyzer), software, cartridge preloaded
with reagents, sampler, on-board internal quality control, and external liquid quality
controls. The cartridge module comprises reagent compartments, a microfluidic chip and
a translucent measurement portion. The reagents in the cartridge enable visoelastic
focusing, lysis of red blood cells and white blood cell (WBC) staining. In addition to the
cartridge, the system includes a disposable sampler, which is used to collect the blood
sample and then transfer it to the cartridge.
2. Principles of Operation:
The HemoScreen analyzer includes several modules (optical, mechanical, and electrical
modules), a processor and controller that work together to measure blood samples that
have been prepared inside disposable cartridges. The blood sample is collected with an
additional disposable unit called a sampler. Once filled, the sampler is inserted into the
cartridge in a single action, whereupon the cartridge is inserted into the reader for
automatic sample preparation/staining and measurement. The cartridge is supplied
preloaded with all required reagents.

--- Page 2 ---
Once the cartridge is inserted into the reader, blood is expelled from the capillaries into
the reagent compartments. The reader then mixes the blood sample with the reagents by
alternately pressing compressible portions of the cartridge, eventually causing the
suspension of cells to flow into the microfluidic chamber. Cells flowing in the
microfluidic chamber focus into a single-cell plane due to viscoelastic focusing. The
reader then captures images of the focused cells and analyzes them in real time using
machine vision algorithms. The reader interfaces with the cartridge mechanically and
optically, and has no direct contact with the fluid inside the cartridge. When analysis is
complete, the results are displayed to the user on the reader's touch screen.
Leukocytes are classified based on their staining properties and morphology, whereas
absolute counts are obtained by counting the cells contained in a chamber of predetermined
volume. Test results are obtained within six minutes and the results are saved.

Method comparison studies were performed at three point-of-care (POC) sites (2 sites
in the U.S. and one site in Israel) with 495 residual venous blood specimens collected
in standard K2EDTA tubes. The studies included normal and pathological samples to
assess the HemoScreen performance across the analytical measurement ranges
(AMRs) as well as at medical decision points. The pathological samples included
conditions: acute inflammation, bacterial and viral infections, aplastic anemia, acute
and chronic leukemias (lymphocytic or myelocytic), multiple myeloma (plasma cell
leukemia), microcytic anemia, normocytic anemia, macrocytic anemia,
hemoglobinopathies, thalassemia, iron and folate deficiencies. The samples were
represented by an age range of 4–92 years old, and the study population included 277
males (56%) and 218 females (44%). Each blood sample was analyzed in duplicate
on the Hemoscreen and Sysmex XN-10, but only the first replicateHemoscreen
results was used for all data analyses.
Bias was determined based on the results of the Deming regression model. For the
regression analysis, the 95% confidence intervals (CI) and predicted bias/difference
for each parameter was determined by sites and all sites combined. All results were
within the pre-defined acceptance criteria with the exception of the basophil
parameters.

For the comparison of the HemoScreen to the Sysmex XN-10, the range of results
was limited to 0.00–2.24; therefore, an additional method comparison study was
conducted to evaluate the WBC differential parameters with elevated basophils.This
study was conducted at one site with 95 whole blood samples (2–88 years of age, 39
females and 56 males) comparing the HemoScreen to manual light microscopy (400
cells per blood film) for basophil percentages.The WBC differential absolute counts
were compared to the Sysmex XN-10. Deming linear regression analysis was used to
calculate the correlation coefficient, slope and intercept along with the 95% CI. The
results met the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

Flagging studies
The WBC flagging rate for HemoScreen was compared to the WBC differential
results displayed by the Sysmex XN and CellaVision for 460 samples. Three blood
film slides were prepared for each sample for measurement on the CellaVision (2
slides/200 cells counted per slide for a total of 400 cells). Competent operators trained
to use the CellaVision performed the differentials, and the results were verified by
these operators. Two types of abnormalities were evaluated: (1) distributional
abnormal samples, which are samples where the quantity of at least one of the
parameters resides outside of the normal concentrations, and (2) morphological
abnormal samples, which are samples that contain atypical forms of the normal cell
types contained in ordinary blood samples.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability-Whole blood
Two short term precision studies were conducted across three sites (one internal site
and 2 POC sites) with POC operators to assess within-run precision (repeatability) in
accordance with the CLSI EP05-A3 approved guideline. Sixty-five K2EDTA whole
blood samples that spanned the analytical measuring range and medical decision
levels were assayed 15 times and for all 20 parameters. All results met the pre-
defined acceptance criteria.
Reproducibility-Whole blood
The study was conducted at three sites, over five days with five replicates per run
using a 3-level control set comprising low, normal and high levels of measurands.
The data generated from this assessment was used to calculate, between-day and
between-run precision, between-laboratory precision (includes variability of different
systems and operators), and reproducibility (total precision). For each reported
parameter and for each level of control tested, the mean, SD and %CV of the various

c. Linearity:
Linearity was defined for WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT and PLT using 6 venous whole
blood samples. These samples were contrived to create the test panels for WBC,
RBC, HGB, HCT, and PLT to cover the specified ranges. Seven concentrations were
used for RBC/HGB and HCT, 10 concentrations were used for PLT, and 14
concentrations were used for WBC. Each concentration level was tested in duplicate
on each of the two HemoScreen analyzers.
Regression analysis was used to assess linearity for first order model (e.g. linear), and
weighted polynomial regression was used to assess linearity for second and third
order models (e.g, quadratic and cubic). PLT achieved linearity with a first order
model while for all other parameters linearity was achieved through polynomial
regression.

d. Carryover:
Not applicable
e. Interfering Substances:
The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of various potential interfering
substances and blood constituents on HemoScreen clinical and analytical
performance. The scope of the potential interferents included lipemia, high bilirubin,
high WBC, high PLT, and NRBCs.
There was no significant bilirubin interference up to a concentration 50 mg/dL for the
following parameters: WBC, HGB, RBC, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, and RDW. For
PLT and MPV, there was no significant bilirubin interference up to a concentration of
30 mg/dL.
When blood samples with high triglycerides (319-729 mg/dL) were tested, it was
confirmed that all parameters met the claims. There was no significant interference
detected when evaluated at this concentration.
For high white blood cell (up to 317 x103/μL) and platelet (up to 2,045 x103/μL)
concentrations, no significant bias was observed in any of the evaluated parameters
and no significant NRBC interference was noted.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Limits of Detection, Blank, and Quantitation (LoD, LoB, and LoQ)
Limit of blank was determined using five plasma depleted residual normal venous
blood samples. Each of the five plasma samples were assayed six times on two
HemoScreen devices for a total of 60 measurements per parameter, using three
cartridge and sampler lots. The study results are provided in the following table.
Parameter LoB
WBC 0.0 x 103/μL
RBC 0.0 x 106/µL
HGB 0.0 g/dL
HCT 0.0%
PLT 0.0 x 103/μL
To determine the LoD and LoQ for WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT and PLT, five low level
samples were derived from native whole blood. Each of the prepared samples was
assayed six times on each of the two HemoScreen devices for a total of 60
measurements. The results of the LoD and LoQ are provided in the table below.

b. Capillary and venous whole blood comparison studies
This study was conducted to demonstrate comparability between capillary and venous
blood from the same subject tested on the HemoScreen. This study was performed
using 75 paired normal and abnormal whole blood samples that included clinical
decision points for WBC, HGB, and PLT from three clinical sites. Blood was drawn
twice from each donor, once via venipuncture (venous) and once via fingerstick
(capillary). For all samples, results from the HemoScreen were comparable for
capillary and venous blood. The venous whole blood sample results were compared
to the corresponding results of the capillary samples for the same donor. All results
met the pre-defined acceptance criteria.
c. Reference Intervals
Adult reference range
The normal adult reference interval for all parameters reported by the HemoScreen
analyzer was established by analyzing venous whole blood samples collected in
K2EDTA from a total population of 243 healthy individuals (N=120 males, N=123
females) collected at one site. Results were established by calculating the non-
parametric 95% confidence interval (2.5th to 97.5th percentiles). The calculated
normal reference ranges are listed below.

d. Sample Stability
Sample stability was determined for 18 freshly collected venous normal and abnormal
blood samples. The venous blood samples were collected into K2EDTA tubes. The
samples were subsequently kept at room temperature (20–25°C) and were analyzed
again, in duplicate at the following time points: 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours and
8 hours. For each time point, results were compared to the respective baseline results.
The data at each time point met the acceptance criteria. The data support a sample
stability claim of 7 hours at room temperature.
e. Shipping and shelf life stability
The objective of this combined study was to evaluate the reagent cartridges and
samplers (the system’s disposable components). The packaging/shipping integrity,
and shelf life claims of HemoScreen reagent cartridges along with the potential
environmental effects that could be encountered during shipment under routine
storage conditions (room temperature) were assessed.
Three cartridge lots were used for the environmental testing and for the shelf life
testing (3.5 months,6.5 months and 7 months):There was no significant effect on
HemoScreen performance when comparing 3.5 month, 6.5 month and 7 month aged
cartridges to newly produced cartridges. The results from all evaluations performed
during this study met the predefinedacceptance criteria. The data support a stability
claim for 6.5 month for the system’s disposable components.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809.10.
