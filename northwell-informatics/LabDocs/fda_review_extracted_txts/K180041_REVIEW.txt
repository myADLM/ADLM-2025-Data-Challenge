The BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) is indicated as an aid in the diagnosis of
specific agents of gastrointestinal illness and results are meant to be used in conjunction with
other clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological data. Positive results do not rule out co-
infection with organisms not included in the BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP).
The agent detected may not be the cause of patient illness. Negative results in the setting of
clinical illness compatible with gastroenteritis may be due to infection by pathogens that are
not detected by this test or non-infectious causes such as ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel
syndrome, or Crohn's disease.
Concomitant culture is necessary for organism recovery and further typing of bacterial agents.
This device is not intended to monitor or guide treatment for C. difficile infection.
Due to the small number of positive specimens collected for certain organisms during the
prospective clinical study, performance characteristics for Campylobacter spp., E. coli O157,
Shigella/EIEC, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Adenovirus 40/41 were established primarily with
retrospective clinical specimens.
Performance characteristics for Entamoeba histolytica, and Vibrio spp. (V. parahaemolyticus,
V. vulnificus, and Vibrio cholerae) were established primarily using contrived clinical
specimens.
Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use.
1. Special conditions for use statement(s):

a. Reproducibility:
A study was performed to assess the Reproducibility of the BioCode Gastrointestinal
Pathogen Panel (GPP) on the BioCode MDx 3000. This study was designed to assess intra-
assay (within run), inter-assay (run-to-run), day-to-day and site-to-site reproducibility. One
lot of reagents was assayed at 3 sites by 2 operators on 1 instrument per site for 5 days
(total of 10 runs per site; 90 replicates total).
The reproducibility panel consisted of 7 contrived samples (sample 7 was a negative
control) extracted in triplicate and each assayed in singlet. The samples consisted of
combinations of 12 representative targets at 1.5x LoD (Low) and 3x LoD (Medium).
Reproducibility for each analyte and panel member was > 99%. Results from the study
are shown in Table 2.

unpreserved stool specimens to assess fresh vs frozen specimen stability. Specimens were
contrived and tested initially as fresh as well as after ≥ 2 freeze thaw cycles. Samples
were tested at low positive (1X - 1.5X LoD) spiked into 7 negative stool samples. Cary-
Blair specimens were not subjected to frozen storage during the clinical study, therefore
they were not tested. Results for the study are presented in Table 3 with mean
fluorescence intensities listed in Table 4 along with the normalized values. Typical raw
signal for positive values are greater than 18,000 mean fluorescence intensity units.
Frozen samples displayed stability throughout the length of the study as exemplified by
changes in mean fluorescent intensity of less than 20%.

One parasite (C. parvum), one virus (Rotavirus A), one gram-positive bacterium (C.
difficile), and one gram-negative bacterium (STEC) were used as representative panel
analyte constituents for this study. Spiked and clinical samples were tested at ~3X LoD
with two organisms in each sample.
Concentrated organism stocks were serially diluted in Cary-Blair and combined with
prescreened negative stool and each condition was assayed with 3 replicates at each time
point. Samples displayed acceptable stability under the all conditions listed above.
d. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable because the BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) is qualitative.

f. Limit of detection:
A study was performed to assess the performance of the BioCode Gastrointestinal
Pathogen Panel (GPP) at the Limit of Detection (LoD) for both unpreserved Stool and
Cary- Blair specimens. In this study the GI Panel was tested with quantified stocks of
bacteria, virus or parasites. For initial screening, four replicates of each concentration in
negative stool and Cary-Blair were extracted on the easyMag System and tested in singlet
with the BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) to estimate LoD. The LoD was
confirmed by extracting 20 replicates of each sample type and testing each in singlet for a
total of 20 replicates at or near the presumptive LoD. LoD for each stock was defined as
the lowest concentration with ≥95% detection of 20 replicates (19 out of 20) and was
determined separately for unpreserved stool and Cary-Blair preserved stool. Results for
LoD testing are shown in Table 7 below.

at 3X LoD, if applicable, were tested at higher concentrations. Due to a lack of titered
specimens, Adenovirus 40/41 clinical samples and Cryptosporidium DNA from the
Cryptosporidium reference unit were used (Public Health England). Norovirus GI and GII
genotypes and the Rotavirus vaccine strain were tested by the CDC. All of the organisms were
detected at the concentrations indicated. The strains evaluated are shown in Tables 8-21

h. Analytical Cross-reactivity:
A study was performed to verify that the BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel
(GPP) does not detect DNA or RNA from organisms commonly found in stool
specimens or from organisms that can cause similar clinical symptoms. In addition, on-
panel organisms were tested at high concentrations to insure there is no cross-reactivity
with other panel targets. This study tested a panel of titered stocks and genomic DNA
extracts for relevant organisms. Organisms that were not available for wet testing were
analyzed in silico comparing the whole organism sequence against all primers to assess
potential for cross reactivity. Analysis was conducted using BlastN and Primer Blast
programs. Results from evaluation of cross-reactivity are shown in Tables 21-25.
Cross-reactivity was not observed with microorganisms tested in this study except for the

following:
Y. enterocolitica: Wet testing and in silico sequence analysis indicate a potential for
cross-reactivity with Y. bercovieri, Y. frederiksenii, Y. intermedia and Y. mollaretii near
the established LoD for Y. enterocolitica (~1.5 x 103 CFU/mL). Y. rohdei was also
detected when present at high levels (>6.8 x 104 CFU/mL). These species are in the Y.
enterocolitica group and are suspected human pathogens.
Shiga toxin: Shiga toxin (stx), that is identical to stx1 of STEC is found in Shigella
dysenteriae; therefore, a BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) GI Panel
report with positive test results for Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) and
Shigella/Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) in the same sample may indicate the presence of
Shigella dysenteriae since the genetic relatedness of these two pathogens indicate they
could constitute a single species but they are maintained as separately named entities
for the purposes of epidemiology and clinical medicine.
Rotavirus: Wet testing has demonstrated that the GPP assay will detect recombinant
viruses included in Rotavirus vaccines.
Cryptosporidium: Wet testing demonstrated cross reactivity with C. cuniculus and C.
meleagridis .
E. histolytica: Wet testing with a gene fragment construct and in silico sequence
analysis do not predict cross reactivity with the closely related E. dispar.
The following tables (Table 22, Table 23, and table 24) present a listing of organisms for
which there was no observed cross-reactivity:

Each member of the interfering substance panel was added to prescreened negative stool
sample spiked with representative members of the BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel
(GPP) at 3X LoD and a negative matrix only pre screened negative stool. One parasite (C.
parvum), one virus (Rotavirus A), one gram positive bacterium (C. difficile), and one gram
negative bacterium (STEC) was used as representative analytes for this study. Each sample
was tested with and without potentially interfering substances. Each sample was extracted in
triplicate tested in singlet with the GI Panel on the BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel
(GPP).
Concentrations were determined by reviewing 510(k) summary results of previous GI panel
clinical trials and CLSl-EP1-A2. None of the substances listed above returned interfering
results at the concentrations tested.
Microbial Inhibition:
The accuracy of the BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) in the presence of
potentially inhibiting microorganisms was assessed in the following study. The interfering
organisms tested were Bacteroides fragilis (1 x 106 CFU/mL), Blastocystis hominis (1 x 105
CFU/mL), Candida albicans (1 x 105 CFU/mL), Clostridium difficile non-toxigenic (1 x 106
CFU/mL), Enterococcus faecalis (1 x 106 CFU/mL), Escherichia coli non-pathogenic (1 x
106 CFU/mL), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 x 106 CFU/mL), and Saccharomyces boulardi (1
x 105 CFU/mL).Each member of the interfering microorganism panel was added to
prescreened negative stool sample spiked with representative members of the BioCode
Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) GI Pathogen Panel at 3X LoD and a negative matrix
only pre screened negative stool. One parasite (C. parvum), one virus (Rotavirus A), one
gram positive bacterium (C. difficile), and one gram negative bacterium (STEC) was used as
representatives for this study. Each sample was tested with and without potentially

Competitive Interference:
A study was performed to evaluate the potential for inhibition in samples with mixed
infectious agents. Prescreen negative stool was spiked with one target at high concentration
(≥106 CFU/mL for bacteria and ≥105 units/mL for viruses or parasites) and two targets at low
concentration (≤ 3 LoD). Common co-infections were determined by reviewing results of
previous GI Panel clinical trials from 510k summaries, publications/posters and internal
clinical sample testing. Each sample was extracted in triplicate on the easyMAG and each
extraction tested in singlet with the BioCode GPP on the BioCode MDx 3000 system. No

3. Clinical studies:
A total of 1558 leftover, de-identified samples were prospectively collected from
patients who underwent stool sample collection for clinical indications of diarrhea
caused by gastrointestinal infection at four (4) investigational sites, with each
collecting approximately 400 samples. In addition testing was performed on archived
known positives and contrived specimens to further augment the sample numbers.
Each raw stool specimen was de-identified at the site and the de-identified leftover
sample was divided into aliquots and either tested freshly on the BioCode
Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) at the site, or frozen and tested at a later date at
the site. Each stool specimen in Cary-Blair was similarly de-identified at the site and
the de-identified leftover sample aliquoted into 4 aliquots and tested freshly on the
BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) at the site. All prospectively collected
samples had age, sex, and therapy status collected by the site. Enrollment of samples
covered multiple calendar seasons beginning January 2015 and ending in August 2017.
During the prospective clinical study 2.6% (41/1558) of samples were invalid for lack
of RNA-IC signal on initial testing. The invalid rate after repeat testing was
approximately 0.2% (3/1558). The results of the clinical study are presented in the
tables below.
The performance for C. difficile for frozen specimens was not equivalent to the
predicate device. Therefore, samples suspected of C. difficile presence should only be
tested fresh. The assay software requires selection of sample type (fresh or frozen) and
results for C. difficile are reported only for fresh specimens.

Testing of inoculated Cary-Blair specimens from previously frozen prospective specimens
To supplement the number of prospective Cary-Blair specimens, 400 unpreserved stool
samples from sites 1 and 2 were thawed and inoculated into Cary-Blair. Three were
removed from the study for improper storage prior to testing. Two were invalid for RNA
IC failure in the unpreserved stool. The following table summarizes the performance of
BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) for these inoculated Cary-Blair specimens
with performance calculated based on a comparison to reference/comparator methods.

sequencing; none confirmed as positive.
Testing of Pre-selected Archived Specimens (Category III)
Several analytes were not encountered or had low prevalence in the clinical study. To
supplement the results of the prospective clinical study, 260 preselected archived
specimens were assayed. These were archived clinical specimens that were previously
tested positive by different methods. Prior to testing with the Applied BioCode
Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP), the presence of the expected analyte was verified
in each specimen using analyte-specific PCR followed by bi-directional sequencing
performed at Applied BioCode, Inc. The specimens were randomized with negative
specimens, such that the users performing the BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel
(GPP) were blinded to the expected test result. A summary of results of the BioCode
Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) testing are presented in the tables below.

Testing of Contrived Specimens (Category IV)
For some analytes both prospective and archived testing were insufficient to establish
performance. To supplement the prospective and archived data, contrived specimens
were assayed. The contrived specimens were positive for Giardia, E. histolytica,
Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Vibrio spp. These contrived
clinical specimens were prepared using individual clinical specimens that had

Clinical Specificity – Microbial Detection in Asymptomatic Volunteers
In order to investigate baseline levels for each analyte included in the BioCode
Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) in individuals who are not exhibiting signs and
symptoms of infectious gastroenteritis, 125 clinical stool samples were collected from
healthy asymptomatic donors. These are defined as donors not exhibiting signs and
symptoms, or on antibiotics (for symptoms) during the previous 30 days. Asymptomatic
donors from two sites and various age groups were included in this study and the
demographic information for the donors is shown in the table below. PCR inhibition, as
determined by results of the assay internal control (bacteriophage MS2), was observed for
one sample (0.8%). After re-running this sample in accordance with the package insert
instructions for use, inhibition was still observed, so no result was reported. Therefore,
the final data analysis was conducted on 124 of 125 samples collected for this study. A
total of 26 samples were positive. The results are summarized in the tables below.

5. Calibration: Optical calibration of the MDx 3000 is performed twice a year by Applied
BioCode. No calibration kit is available.
6. Quality Control:
Each laboratory should establish its own Quality Control ranges and frequency of QC
testing based on applicable local laws, regulations and good laboratory practices. The
BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) uses an internal control
(bacteriophage MS2) which is added to each sample during pre- treatment. The
internal control monitors the efficiency of the extraction, reverse transcription,
amplification and detection stages of the assay. Positive results may be reported in the
absence of RNA IC detection. The BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP)
software will suppress negative results for any wells with invalid RNA IC results.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not applicable.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
R. Conclusion:
Samples suspected of C. difficile presence should only be tested fresh. The instrument
software has been updated to select for fresh or frozen samples and omit results of C.
difficile.
The submitted information in this premarket notification is sufficient to support a substantial
equivalence decision for the BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP).
