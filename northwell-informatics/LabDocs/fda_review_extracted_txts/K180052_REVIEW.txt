Microorganism recovery (viability) study:
The performance characteristics of UriSwab were determined using organism recovery
(i.e., viability) studies. The bacteria and fungi listed in Table 1 below were evaluated in
this study. The organisms evaluated are representatives from bacterial species that are
usually associated with urinary tract infections. Inoculation and organism recovery
studies were conducted based on the general principles outlined in the Clinical
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M40-A2 document.
To perform viability studies, organisms were diluted from 1.5 x 108 colony forming units
per milliliter (CFU/mL) (equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard) down into filtered
synthetic urine to a final concentration of 1.5 x 104, 1.5 x 103, and 1.5x102 CFU/mL.
UriSwab was inoculated by submerging the sponge applicator for 5 seconds in each
dilution. For each organism, 45 devices were inoculated and microorganism viability was
determined by quantitative culture to determine viable count (CFU/mL). At time zero, 9
devices were centrifuged immediately after inoculating UriSwab. All remaining devices
were either held at refrigerated temperature (2-8ºC) or room temperature (20-25ºC) and
organism viability was assessed at 24 and 48-hr post-storge. For each holding
temperature and time point evaluated, urine was eluted from 9 devices by centrifugation
and plated in triplicate to determine the CFU/mL. Plate counts represent the average of
three plates. Results are shown in Table 1 below and demonstrate less than 1 log
10
increase or reduction for all organisms tested. This is acceptable.

Microorganism release study (Centrifugation and Manual release methods):
A limited study was performed to evaluate the ability of the UriSwab sponge to
successfully release absorbed microorganisms by centrifugation and manual release
methods. The organisms listed in Table 2 below were evaluated in this study. These
studies were performed as described in “Microorganism recovery (viability) study”,
with the following modifications: Within two minutes of UriSwab inoculation, urine was
eluted either by centrifugation at 104Xg for 3 seconds or manual extraction, which entails
shaking the device down three times using quick, sharp, downward wrist motions. Eluent
was removed and spread in triplicate on the appropriate agar. A time-zero control
(representing spiked urine) was also plated in triplicate. Microorganism release was
evaluated by calculating the log value of microorganism concentration in the UriSwab
10
eluent obtained by centrifiguation and manual release methods versus the zero-time
control. Results are shown in Table 2 and demonstrate no difference in organism release

Fill volume study: A fill volume study was performed to demonstrate that underfilling of
UriSwab does not negatively affect viability of urine flora. In order to test the worst-case-
scenario, UriSwab Shelf-life results were analyzed and the three organisms with the
highest log reduction were chosen for this study and are listed in Table 3.
Microorganisms were diluted from 1.5 x 108 CFU/mL (equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland
standard) down into filtered synthetic urine to a final concentration of 1.5 x 105, 1.5 x
104, and 1.5x103 CFU/mL. A smaller volume (10 uL) of eluent was plated to allow plate
counts to fall in the countable range. UriSwab was inoculated by submerging the sponge
applicator for 5 seconds in tubes that contained 300 uL of each dilution. For each
organism, 18 devices were inoculated and organism recovery was evaluated for nine
devices at time zero and nine devices 48 hours post-storage at 20-24ºC. Microorganisms
were eluted by centrifugation and 10 uL of elute was plated in triplicate for each
inoculated device. Plate counts represent an average of three plates. The log reduction of
these organisms was less than 1 log at 48 hours. These results are acceptable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Shelf life: UriSwab shelf life is up to 24 months after the date of manufacture for use to
collect and store urine samples at 2-25ºC. To substantiate this claim, shelf life stability
testing was performed on three lots of UriSwab mini-size tubes stored at temperatures of
4+2ºC or 30+2ºC for up to 24 months. For each lot, tests were conducted at T=1, 12, and
24 months after date of production. The organisms included in this study can be found in
Table1, section “Recovery of Urine Culture Organisms in UriSwab”. For each organism
and each post-production time point, 45 devices were inoculated and microorganism
viability was determined by quantitative culture to determine colony forming units per
mL. As a time-zero control, 9 devices were centrifuged immediately after inoculating
UriSwab. All remaining devices were either held at refrigerated temperature (2-8ºC) or
room temperature (20-25ºC) and organism viability was assessed at 24 and 48-hr post-
storge. For each holding temperature and time point, urine was eluted from 9 devices by
centrifugation and plated in triplicate to determine the CFU/mL. Plate counts represent
the average of three plates. Results (not shown) demonstrate less than 1 log increase or
10
reduction for all organisms tested. This is acceptable.
Sterlization: UriSwab tubes are sterilized using Gamma irradiation, with the dosage set
at 25 kGy. Sterilization is validated following ISO 11137-1:2006, and ISO 11137-2
(2013), Sterilization of Health Care Products Radiation guidelines.

Method comparison is not applicable for a bacterial transport medium. The device itself
does not provide a result that can be used in making a clinical decision. Bench testing
studies were done to determine the ability of the UriSwab - Urine Collection, Transport
and Preservation System to maintain viability of microorganisms commonly found as the
etiological agents of urinary tract infections. The analytical studies showed recovery of
representative bacteria from filtered synthetic urine that are within the acceptance criteria
recommended in CLSI-M40-A2 (See section M.1. above).

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
