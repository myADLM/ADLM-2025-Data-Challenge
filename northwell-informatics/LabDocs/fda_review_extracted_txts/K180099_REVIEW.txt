L. Test Principle:
The determination of soluble antigen (CRP) concentration by turbidimetric methods involves
the reaction with specific antiserum (anti-CRP) to form insoluble complexes. When light is
passed through the suspension formed a portion of the light is transmitted and focused onto a
photodiode by an optical lens system. The amount of transmitted light is indirectly
proportional to the specific protein concentration in the test sample. Concentrations are
automatically calculated by reference to a calibration curve stored within the instrument.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision studies were performed following the recommendations in the CLSI
EP05-A3 guideline. The precision samples consisted of 5 serum samples at the
following concentrations: 0.863 mg/L, 1.65 mg/L, 3.02 mg/L, 5.06 mg/L and 8.54
mg/L. The samples were run in duplicate with 2 runs per day, using one instruments
and one reagent batch, over the course of 20 days. The results from a representative lot
are summarized in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were performed following the recommendations in the CLSI EP06-
A guideline. A high pool was prepared using a serum sample with high CRP activity.
The low pool was pooled normal serum. The high and low pools were inter-diluted to
achieve concentrations spanning 10% beyond the limits of the claimed measuring
range (0.44 mg/L to 12.16 mg/L). The results were analyzed using weighted linear
regression analysis and the results showed that the deviation from linearity did not
exceed 10%.
The linearity studies support the claimed measuring range of 0.5 to 10 mg/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The assay is traceable to ERM-DA474, which is traceable to CRM 470.
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit studies were performed following the recommendations in the CLSI
EP17-A2 guideline.
Limit of blank (LoB): The LoB was carried out using 4 depleted serum pools and 3
reagent lots using 1 instrument. Samples were run five times each per day, over 3
days to give a total of 60 replicates per reagent lot. For each reagent lot, the LoB
results were ranked from lowest to highest concentration, and the LoB was estimated
to be the result equivalent to the concentration at the 95th percentile.
Limit of detection (LoD): 4 serum sample pools were used to calculate the LoD using
3 reagent lots and 1 instrument. Samples were run five times each per day, over 3
days on each reagent lot. The LoD was calculated for each reagent lot using the
parametric approach described in the guideline.
Limit of quantitation (LoQ): 4 serum sample pools were used to calculate the LoQ
using 3 reagent lots and 1 instrument. Samples were run five times each per day, over
3 days on each reagent lot. The LoQ was determined using the lowest concentration
that met the defined performance goals of imprecision (%CV) <20%.

Based on the results of the studies, the sponsor claims the following detection limits:
LoB LoD LoQ
0.15 mg/L 0.17 mg/L 0.5 mg/L
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed following the recommendations in the CLSI
EP07-A2 guideline. 4 pool levels of serum samples (with CRP concentrations around
1, 2, 3 and 5 mg/L) were used. Each sample was spiked with interfering substances
and tested. Samples were tested in replicates of twenty at three analyte concentrations
using a single lot of reagents. The results of the spiked samples were compared to the
results of the non-spiked samples. At the following concentrations, the percentage
difference between the results of the spiked samples compared to the results of the
non-spiked samples was less that ±10%.

The sponsor includes the following information in the package insert.
“Turbidimetric assays are not suitable for measurement of highly lipaemic or
haemolysed samples or samples containing high levels of circulating immune
complexes (CICs) due to the unpredictable degree of non-specific scatter these
sample types may generate. Unexpected results should be confirmed using an
alternative assay method.”

CRP prozone study:
A study was performed to verify the CRP prozone performance on the Optilite
analyzer. 28 samples with CRP concentrations ranging from 0.8, to 1161.6 mg/L
were evaluated. The study demonstrated that up to 829.3 mg/L the results were
reported as above the measuring range and flagged as being out of the measuring
range (>10 mg/L). However, due to antigen excess, samples with CRP concentrations
above 893 mg/L will be reported erroneously low with a prozone flag. For example,
a sample with a CRP concentration of 1161 mg/L is reported as 91.3 mg/L with a
prozone flag.
The sponsor includes the following limitations in the labeling regarding the prozone
effect:
“The reportable range of this assay is approximately 0.5 – 10mg/L, depending on lot-
specific calibrator values. Any result obtained above this range must be considered
invalid and the sample should be re-tested using a conventional CRP assay. For
example, in a study samples between 893mg/L and 1161 mg/L returned falsely low
concentrations (99.46 mg/L and 91.32 mg/L), however antigen excess was correctly
detected by the analyser and results were accompanied by a “High activity” flag in all
cases”
“Potential occurrences of antigen excess cannot be completely excluded. Samples
detected as being in excess are flagged as "High activity" and are automatically re-
measured at a higher sample dilution to confirm antigen excess. Any sample with a
concentration above 10 mg/L should be considered invalid and re-tested with a
conventional CRP assay.”
