I. Device Description:
The Stat Profile® Prime Plus Analyzer System is designed to be used in a clinical laboratory
setting. It consists of the analyzer, sensor cartridges, calibrator packs, auto-cartridge quality
control packs (internal controls), ampuled quality control materials (external controls) and
thermal paper for an onboard printer. Specimens are identified by scanning a barcode or by
manually entering the information via the touchscreen.
The Stat Profile® Prime Plus Analyzer has slots to accommodate two sensor cartridges
(primary and auxiliary). The analyzer will determine the configuration of the system by
detecting which sensor cards are installed. The reporting of CO-Oximeter parameters (or not
reporting them) will also be determined by the selection of the Sensor Cards, for which there
are two options:
· Primary Sensor Card 1 reports the following analytes: pO , pCO , pH, Hct, tHb,
2 2
Na, Cl, K, iCa, iMg, Glu, SO , O Hb, COHb, MetHb, HHb, and tBil

L. Test Principle:
Hematocrit is obtained by measuring electrical resistance of the blood sample. Two standard
solutions are used to calibrate the hematocrit sensor and to obtain the slope. The analyzer
then measures the electrical resistance of the blood sample to obtain the hematocrit value.
The Prime Plus CO-Oximeter subsystem is used to measure the hemoglobin parameters of
whole blood such as total hemoglobin (tHb), carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), deoxyhemoglobin
(HHb), oxyhemoglobin (O Hb), methemoglobin and (MetHb) using chemometrics applied to
2
optical absorbance. Whole blood is drawn into a cuvette via a peristaltic pump. The analyzer
then measures the light transmittance through the sample over a plurality of wavelengths in
the 422 to 695 nm spectral region. This output signal is processed using a computational
mapping function technique to determine the concentration of tHb, COHb, O Hb, MetHb,
2
and HHb. Oxygen saturation (SO ) represents the percent of hemoglobin bound to oxygen,
2
expressed as a fraction of the amount of hemoglobin capable of binding to oxygen.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Profile pHOx Ultra analyzer. The pHOx Ultra analyzer was used to establish the
target value of each blood level for each parameter. Results of the linear regression
analysis for one representative analyzer are shown below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The traceability for Hct, SO , tHb, O Hb, COHb, MetHb, and HHb is as follows:
2 2
Hct: Measurements were performed by the microhematocrit method which calls for
whole blood to be centrifuged and the percentage of packed red cells calculated.
Results from the reference method were compared to measurements from a Nova
analyzer. A least squares regression analysis of the data was performed.
Oxygen Saturation SO = 100%: The oxygen saturation percentage (SO %)
2 2
traceability is established through FO Hb and FHHb using the following equation:
2
SO % = FO Hb/(FO Hb+FHHb)
2 2 2
Total Hemoglobin: Traceability of total hemoglobin was established using the
benchmark cyanmethhemoglobin method (see NCCLS Document H15-A3: Reference
and Selected Procedures for the Quantitative Determination of Hemoglobin in Whole
Blood; Approved Standard). Absorbance readings from a spectrophotometer at 530
nm are used as reference samples and are compared to absorbance readings from
Nova instruments.
O Hb: The primary working standard is a non-smoker whole blood sample, having
2
ctHb in the normal range, which is tonometered with 5% CO , 95% O , traceable to
2 2
NIST SRM gases. This blood sample is then used in calibration of the CO-Oximeter.
COHb – Normal Value: The primary working standard is a mixture of certified gas
having 8.00% CO with the balance N2 (3000 ppm propane). A known aliquot of
whole blood is mixed with a known volume of gas mixture to produce a secondary
standard. Validation of the mixing is performed using a calibrated Siemens
Radiometer ABL800 Flex analyzer. The secondary whole blood standard is then used
to calibrate the CO-Oximeter.

MetHb: Traceability of methemoglobin was established using the
cyanmethhemoglobin method. THb is converted to MetHb by potassium ferric
cyanide and then further to cyanmethemoglobin by potassium cyanide. The
calibration is established by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 630 nm on a
spectrophotometer.
HHb: The primary working standard used is a non-smoker whole blood sample. The
blood sample is treated with dithiionite to remove oxygen. This sample is then used to
calibrate the CO-Oximeter.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate the limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection
(LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) for tHb, O Hb, COHb, MetHb and HHb using
2
altered whole blood samples. Study samples were prepared from heparinized venous
whole blood samples. CO-Oximetry blank and low level samples were prepared using
a tonometer to control the gas content in the blood samples. A sodium hydrosulfite
spiking solution was also used to scavenge the residual oxygen for the blank O Hb
2
samples. All prepared samples were analyzed on the reference analyzer to obtain the
target values. Calculated Total Error is less than the accuracy goal for Total Error, so
the LoQ = LoD. Results were as follows:

The performance at the lower end of the measuring range for SO andHct is

supported by the linearity studies in section M.1.b.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference testing study was performed using whole blood collected in lithium
heparin vacutainers. The possible interfering substances were tested at two analyte
concentrations. Samples were divided to create two separate pools of blood, one for
control samples and the other for test samples that were spiked with potential
interferent substance. The control and test samples were measured on the same
analyzers in replicates of eight. If interference was identified, a dose response study
was performed to determine the concentration where the interfering substance may
alter results. For all analytes, the sponsor defined interference as a specified % bias
from the test concentration as shown in the following table.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were conducted by testing lithium heparinized arterial
and venous whole blood specimens in singlet on the three Stat Profile® Prime Plus
analyzers and two pHOx Ultra analyzers (predicate device). In order to evaluate the
claimed measuring range, some venous whole blood specimens were tonometered,
spiked or diluted to achieve the desired concentrations. The singlet result from each
test analyzer was compared to the average of the results from each comparative
method. Linear regression analysis of one representative analyzer is shown below.
