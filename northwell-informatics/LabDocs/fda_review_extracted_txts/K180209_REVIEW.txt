L. Test Principle:
Diazyme’s 1,5-AG assay uses the enzyme pyranose oxidase (PROD) to oxidize the 2nd
position hydroxyl group of 1,5-AG and to detect the generated hydrogen peroxide by
colorimetry using peroxidase (POD). To eliminate reactive glucose in sample, it is pretreated
by enzymatic reactions using hexokinase and pyruvate kinase (PK). Hexokinase uses
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to convert glucose into non-reactive glucose-6-phosphate (G-
6-P), generating adenosine diphosphate (ADP). The reaction is driven to completion with
PK, as ADP is phosphorylated to ATP during the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)
into pyruvate.

Precision studies were performed using six serum samples containing the following
concentrations of 1,5-AG: 3.1, 5.7, 11.6, 23.2, 61.8 and 97.3 ug/mL. Two levels of
quality control (QC) material (3.6 and 12.3 ug/mL) and one level of calibrator
solution (21.1 ug/mL) were also tested. Samples were tested in duplicate using three
reagent lots over 20 days with two runs per day (20x2x2 design). Samples were
analyzed using the Diazyme 1,5-AG Assay run on a Beckman AU680 analyzer. The
results of data analysis of the combined three lots (n=240) are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using high and low 1,5-AG serum pools that were mixed to
create the following eleven samples containing 1,5-AG concentrations spanning the
measuring range: 0.2, 10.9, 22.1, 34.4, 45.3, 58.5, 68.6, 81.1, 92.7, 103.2, and 116.7
ug/mL 1,5-AG. Samples were measured in triplicate using one lot of reagent on a
Beckman AU860 analyzer. The results of the linear regression analysis are
summarized below:
y = 1.0014x – 0.8351, R2 = 0.9998
The results of the linearity study support the claimed measuring range of 0.5 to 110
ug/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Diazyme 1,5-AG Assay is traceable to an internal standard manufactured using
highly purified 1,5-AG, referred to as the Master Calibrator. The Master Calibrator
was prepared by spiking the appropriate amount of pure 1,5-AG into a phosphate
buffer solution. The Master Calibrator was subsequently value assigned.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) study was performed with five serum samples, which were
dialyzed to removed endogenous 1,5-AG, and two reagent lots. The samples were

tested in quadruplicate over three days (n=60 samples per reagent lot). The LoB was
determined to be 0.3 ug/mL.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) study was performed with five serum samples that
were prepared by diluting native serum samples with serum that was dialyzed to
removed endogenous 1,5-AG, with two reagent lots. Samples were tested in
quadruplicate over three days (n=60 samples per reagent lot). The LoD was
calculated as the LoB + (1.653 * SD of LoD samples). The LoD was determined to be
0.45 ug/mL.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) study was performed using five serum samples
ranging from approximately 1 to 16 times the claimed LoB. Samples were either
native serum or serum diluted with dialyzed serum to obtain the relevant 1,5-AG
concentrations. The diluted serum samples were then tested in 8 replicates per day
over 5 days using two lots of reagents. The sponsor defines LoQ as the lowest
concentration which meets an imprecision (%CV) of <20%. The LoQ was determined
to be 0.6 ug/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were conducted with serum samples adjusted to three levels of
1,5-AG (approximately 5.0, 23.0, and 50 ug/mL). Each sample was divided into a test
pool and a control pool, and potentially interfering substances were added to the test
pool. Test pool samples with various concentrations of substances were compared to
non-spiked controls. The sponsor defines significant interference as greater than
±10% bias between the test and control samples measured using the Diazyme 1,5-AG
Assay on a Beckman AU680 analyzer. The following substances were tested up to the
levels indicated and demonstrated no significant interference:
Substance Highest concentration of substance
tested that did not demonstrate
significant interference (mg/dL)
Bilirubin 5
Conjugated Bilirubin 5
Hemoglobin 125
Triglycerides 1000
Ascorbic Acid 37.5
Glucose 1000
Maltose 500
Uric Acid 20
Creatinine 10
Urea 20
Based on the testing completed, the sponsor has included the following limitation in
the labeling:
WARNING: Significant negative bias (>10%) was observed at bilirubin levels

3. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was conducted by comparing the results from the 1,5-
AG Assay to the to the predicate method (GlycoMark 1,5-AG, K031604) on a
Beckman AU680 analyzer. Serum samples ranging in 1,5-AG concentration from 1.7
to 36.2 ug/mL were collected from 91 diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. In order to
obtain sufficient samples in the high 1,5-AG concentration range, 11 additional
samples were spiked to obtain concentrations between 39.0 and 103.7 ug/mL 1,5-AG.
Samples were tested in singlet. The results of linear regression analysis are as
follows:
y = 1.0164x – 0.2042; R2 = 0.9995
b. Matrix comparison:
To evaluate anticoagulant effects, paired serum/K EDTA plasma and serum/Lithium
2
Heparin plasma samples were tested on the Beckman AU680 analyzer with the
Diazyme 1,5-AG Assay. Fifty-two serum vs. K EDTA plasma and 52 serum vs.
2
Lithium Heparin plasma paired sample sets were evaluated. The results of the linear
regression analysis are presented below:
Tube Type Regression R2 Test range ug/mL
Lithium-heparin y = 1.0059x + 0.0465 0.997 0.8 - 109
plasma vs serum
K EDTA plasma y = 1.0071x – 0.6457 0.994 1.7 - 105.6
2
vs serum
The study data supports the sponsor’s claim that the Diazyme 1,5-AG Assay is
suitable for use with human specimens consisting of serum, K EDTA plasma, and
2
Lithium Heparin plasma.

6. Expected values/Reference range:
To establish the reference interval of 1,5-AG for a normal population, serum samples
from 280 apparently healthy adults, 140 males and 140 females, were tested using the
Diazyme 1,5-AG Assay on the Beckman AU680 analyzer. Using non-parametric 5th-
95th percentiles, the reference interval was established to be from 8.19 to 32.19 ug/mL
for males and 6.00 to 29.10 ug/mL for females.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
