Device Intended Use:
The Cepheid Xpert® Xpress Flu/RSV Assay, performed on the GeneXpert® Xpress System, is
an automated, multiplex real-time, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
assay intended for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A,
influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) viral RNA. The Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV
Assay uses nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and nasal swab (NS) specimens collected from patients
with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay is
intended as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infections in
conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus and should not be used as the sole basis for
treatment or other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2016-2017 influenza
season when influenza A/H3N2 and A/HINI pandemic were the predominant influenza A
viruses in circulation. When other novel influenza A viruses are emerging, performance
characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza
viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture should not be
attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.
Ancillary Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimen Collection Kit for Viruses
The Xpert® Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve, and
transport nasopharyngeal swab specimens and to preserve and transport nasal aspirate/wash
specimens containing viruses from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection
prior to analysis with the Xpert Flu Assay or the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay.
The Xpert® Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve, and

4. Special instrument requirements:
Gene Xpert Xpress System
I. Device Description:
This assay uses nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients with signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection. Viral nucleic acid is extracted from the sample and the
influenza A, influenza B, and/or RSV viral RNA is amplified and detected through real-time
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Detection and differentiation of
influenza A, influenza B, and RSV is reported to the user. The user also has the ability to
choose to run the assay for Flu A and B only or RSV only. If the user chooses one of these
options the assay proceeds as normal, but only the selected assay results are reported.
The assay uses single use disposable cartridge that has a separate section for specimen loading.
The cartridge also contains all PCR reagents and it is where the PCR reaction takes place. The
GeneXpert Xpress System performs all assay steps from clinical sample to reporting assay
results automatically. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC)
are also included in the cartridge. The SPC is present to control for adequate processing of the
target viruses and to monitor for the presence of inhibitors in the PCR reaction. The Probe
Check Control (PCC) verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe
integrity, and dye stability.
The GeneXpert Xpress System, comprised of the GeneXpert Dx System GX-II, which has two
modules capable of performing separate sample preparation, real-time PCR, and RT-PCR tests,
or the GX-IV which has four modules. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing
fluids (i.e., the syringe drive activates the plunger that works in concert with the rotary valve in
the cartridge to move fluids between chambers), an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells, and a
proprietary thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and RT-PCR and detection.
Turnaround time for analysis of a sample is approximately 30 minutes or less. The assay
results are automatically generated at the end of the process and provided in a report that can
be viewed and printed.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
A portion of the analytical studies were conducted for and described in submission K163221.
All testing was performed using the same assay, Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay, no changes to
the assay were made since the 510(k) clearance of K163221. Previous studies were conducted
with the GeneXpert Dx System using GeneXpert Xpress Software v4.6a. For the current
submission the data from all analytical studies (except LoD and Swab Equivalency Study)
were re-analyzed with the new software, GeneXpert Xpress Software version 5.0, on the Gene
Xpert Xpress System instruments GX-II and GX-IV. No changes were detected in the
analytical study data analyses conducted with the new software version used with the Xpert
Xpress Flu/RSV Assay and Gene Xpert Xpress Sytem described in this submission.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision
Please refer to the Decision Summary for submissions K163221.
Reproducibility
A multi-center study was conducted at 3 sites with 3 operators at each site. Each operator
tested a 7-member blinded panel 2 times per day over 5 testing days. One lot of Xpert
Xpress Flu/RSV Assay reagents was used for this study. All sites used the GeneXpert
Xpress IV Instrument System using the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV ADF (assay definition file)
v3. Re-analysis of the data was performed using the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV ADF v4, no
changes to the test results were observed after analysis with the new ADF version.
The ADF was modified to address occasional signal loss detection errors and noisy
amplification curves observed by users of the Xpert Xpress suite of assays offered by
Cepheid. These changes are documented in a separate 510(k) submission K181289.

All negative samples produced a negative result (90/90).
All moderate positive samples produced a positive result [Flu A (90/90) Flu B (90/90)
and RSV (90/90)].
The low positive samples were prepared to target a concentration close the limit of
detection (LoD) for both sample types. However, this resulted in the low positive
samples having a titer lower than the LoD for the NP swab matrix. Overall, 91.0%
(81/89) of the Flu A low positive samples, 93.3% (84/90) of the Flu B low positive
samples and 91.0% (82/90) of the low RSV samples were classified as positive for the
corresponding target. Based on the virus titer used and the LoD for the different
sample types, the 91% and 93% positive results for the low positive samples are
acceptable.
The reproducibility data was also analyzed based on the Ct data for each reaction.
Total standard deviation for all targets was calculated as well as differences between
site, between day, between operator and witin-assay. Variation did not exceed more
than half the total standard deviation demonstrating high reproducibility of the assay.

d. Detection limit:
Studies were performed to determine the analytical limit of detection (LoD) of the Xpert
Xpress Flu/RSV Assay with two lots of reagents across three testing days. Testing was
performed using the GeneXpert Xpress System using the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV ADF v3.
Re-analysis of the data was performed using the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV ADF v4, no
changes resulted from the new ADF version. The higher LoD observed per strain and per
lot was selected for verification. Verification of the estimated LoD claim was performed
on one reagent lot across a minimum of three testing days. LoD was established using
two influenza A H3N2 strains, two influenza A 2009 H1N1 strains, two influenza B
strains, two RSV A strains and two RSV B strains. Viruses were diluted into negative
pooled NP swab and NS clinical matrices for testing. The LoD is defined as the lowest
concentration (tissue culture infective dose, TCID50/mL) per sample that can be
reproducibly distinguished from negative samples 95% of the time or the lowest
concentration at which 19 of 20 replicates were positive. Each strain was tested in
replicates of 20 per concentration of virus in each matrix, in NP swab and NS clinical
matrix. The LoD point values for each strain tested are summarized in Tables below.

N/A
b. Matrix comparison:
Equivalency study for NP swab clinical matrix and simulated matrix was described in
K162331. This study was repeated for the NS clinical matrix to show equivalency between
the nasal swab specimen and simulated matrix.
Simulated matrix consisted of 2.5% (w/v) porcine mucin, 1% (v/v) human whole blood in
0.85% sodium chloride (NaCl) formulated in 1x PBS solution with 15% glycerol, which
was then diluted in UTM to a final concentration of 16.7%. The NS clinical matrix was
created by pooling negative NS clinical matrix, then aliquoting the pooled matrix and
spiking it with the appropriate virus. This study was performed by spiking the NS clinical
matrix and simulated matrix with influenza strains and RSV at four different concentrations
relative to the assay LoD: low positives (2X LoD), medium positives (5X LoD), and high
positives (10X and 100X LoD). The virus strains used and their concentration are shown in
the table below.

A total of 3576 specimens were enrolled in this clinical study, the number of specimens
included in analysis differ for Flu A/B and RSV because two different comparator methods
were used for these analytes. Specimens were collected from October 2016 through March
2017. Each patient provided either a nasal swab (NS) or a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab
specimen. For nasal swab specimens, one swab was used to swab both nostrils, only one
nostril was swabbed for the NP swab specimen. Specimens were prospectively collected
fresh and tested as soon as possible after collection and within 24 hours. All samples were
tested with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV assay and an FDA cleared NAAT assay for Flu A/B
and RSV.
There were 3545 specimens tested with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV assay. There were 67
initially indeterminate Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV results (38 NO RESULT and 29
INSTRUMENT ERROR), 58 of those were re-tested to yield 53 valid results from repeat
testing and 14 results remained indeterminate. The initial intdeterminate rate was 1.9%
(67/3545), 95%CI: (1.5%-2.4%). After re-testing the final indeterminate rate was 0.4%
(14/3545), 95%CI: (0.2%-0.7%)
For Flu A/B a total of 311 samples were excluded for the following reasons; 234
unresolved comparator result, 1 not tested with comparator, 6 with invalid comparator
assay controls, 17 specimens frozen, 14 shipping problem, 9 incorrect specimen collection,
8 not tested with GX system, 14 indeterminate Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV result, 4 run on
incorrect assay, and 4 not tested within protocol specified time period.
There were 3265specimens evaluated for Flu A and Flu B (1598 NS specimens and 1667
NP specimens); 54.8% from female subjects and 45.2% from male subjects).
For RSV, a total of 473 samples were excluded for the following reasons; 415 unresolved
comparator result, 5 not tested with comparator, 14 shipping problem, 9 incorrect specimen
collection, 8 not tested with GX system, 14 indeterminate Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV result, 4
run on incorrect assay, and 4 not tested within protocol specified time period.
The total number of eligible samples with valid RSV results was 3103 (1543 NS and 1560
NP swab); 55.1% from female subjects and 44.9% from male subjects.

5. Software Description
The GeneXpert Xpress (II and IV) Instrument Systems are provided with a computer,
preloaded with software for running tests and viewing results. Each instrument contains
random access, closed-system, computer-based software and embedded firmware which
run dedicated microprocessor-controlled modules to integrate sample preparation,
amplification and real-time detection in a single system. The GeneXpert Xpress software
differs from the GeneXpert Dx software in its user interface which is simplified for use in
CLIA waived environments.
The GeneXpert Instrument Systems are provided with a computer, preloaded with software
for running tests and viewing results. Each instrument (Dx and Infinity) contains random
access, closed-system, computer-based software and embedded firmware which run
dedicated microprocessor-controlled modules to integrate sample preparation,
amplification and real-time detection in a single system.
The GeneXpert Infinity modules contain extra robotic features for cartridge handling. The
Xpertise software utilized by the Infinity Systems is the user interface and provides the
ordering of tests as well as automates loading and unloading of cartridges into GeneXpert
modules within the system. The Xpertise user interface builds upon the existing core
software functionality for handling GeneXpert modules for cartridge fluidics control,
temperature control, optics control, and data analysis by the addition of automation
handling for the robotic arm.
6. Specimen Identification
Specimens are manually loaded into the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay cartridge by the user.
The user can then either scan or type the sample and patient ID into the system. Prior to
placing the cartridge into the GeneXpert Instrument System, the barcode on the Xpert
Xpress Flu/RSV Assay cartridge is scanned. The information contained in the assay
barcode is utilized by the software to run the appropriate assay definition file (ADF). If an
assay is being run that does not already exist in the GeneXpert database, the user must
import the ADF before starting the test.
7. Calibration
Not required by user.

8. Quality Control
Sample Processing Control
The sample processing control (SPC) is a non-infectious armored RNA pseudovirus that is
included in each cartridge to verify that adequate processing of the sample has occurred.
The SPC verifies that nucleic acids have been released from the target viruses if the
organism is present and detects specimen-associated PCR and RT-PCR inhibitors. The SPC
should be POSITIVE in a sample that is negative for influenza A, influenza , or for RSV
target analytes, and can be NEGATIVE or POSITIVE in a sample containing detectable
levels of one or all three of the target analytes.
Probe Check Control
Before the start of the amplification process, the GeneXpert Instrument Systems measures
the fluorescence signal from the probes to monitor bead rehydration, reaction tube filling,
probe integrity, and dye stability. All assay reagents must be present and intact for the PCC
to pass the validated acceptance criteria. If any of the PCC conditions fail, the result is
reported as an ERROR and the test must be repeated using a new assay cartridge.
