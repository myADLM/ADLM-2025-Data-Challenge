3. Product code: LSR; Reagent, Borrelia Serological Reagent
4. Panel: Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s): The Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA
Test Kit is intended as a qualitative presumptive (first-step) test for the detection of IgG
and IgM antibodies to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto in human serum from symptomatic
patients or people suspected of infection. Positive and equivocal results must be
supplemented by testing with a second-step Western blot assay.
2. Indication(s) for use: Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements: N/A
I. Device Description: The Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM test
consists of antigenic proteins specific for B. burgdorferi (sensu stricto) which are either
purified or cloned and expressed in the surrogate host E.coli. The individual antigens are
transferred to polystyrene 96 well microtiter plates.

--- Page 2 ---
During the test procedure, antibodies to B. burgdorferi (sensu stricto) if present in the human
serum sample will bind to the antigens coated onto the wells forming antigen-antibody
complexes. Excess antibodies are removed by washing. A conjugate of goat anti-human
IgG/IgM antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase are then added, which binds to
the antigen-antibody complexes. Excess conjugate is removed by washing. This is followed
by the addition of a chromogenic substrate, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). If specific
antibodies to the antigen are present in the patients’ serum, a blue color will develop. The
enzymatic reaction is then stopped with a stopping solution causing the contents of the well
to turn yellow. The wells are read photometrically with a microplate reader at 450nm.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision: To determine the precision of the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia
burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA Test, a within-lab precision study was conducted. A
precision panel consisting of a negative sample, a high negative sample, a low
positive sample, and a moderate positive sample, along with the kit controls, was
tested in-house. The sample panel was masked and randomized. Each of the panel
members was tested in duplicate, twice per day, for 12 days. The results are
summarized in the following table.

the kit controls, was tested at three different sites. The sample panel was masked and
randomized. Each of the panel members was tested in triplicate, twice per day, for
five days. The Within-Run, Between-Run, Between-Days, and Between-Sites

Interfering Substances: The effect of potential interfering substances on samples
using the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA Test was
evaluated. Three samples, a negative, a low positive, and a moderate positive were
spiked with high levels of interferants and were tested along with serum without
spiked interferants. The recommended concentrations from the guideline
“Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry EP7-A2” from the Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute were used. The tested substances did not affect the
performance of the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA
Test.

Bilirubin 342 µmol/L None detected
Cholesterol 13 mmol/L None detected
Hemoglobin 2 g/L None detected
Triglycerides 37 mmol/L None detected
f. Assay cut-off:
Determination of the Assay Cut-off: The cut-off was determined by testing a total
of 200 normal sera which consisted of 100 sera from an endemic region of Lyme
disease and 100 sera from a non-endemic region. The mean plus two standard
deviations was used to determine the assay cut-off. After the cut-off was determined
125 characterized Lyme disease samples were tested. An ROC analysis was then
generated with the 325 samples (200 normal and 125 characterized samples) to verify
the chosen cut-off. The analysis confirmed that the assay cut-off provided an optimal
level of sensitivity and specificity.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Comparison with Predicate Device: Comparison studies were conducted at three
sites (one internal and two external reference laboratories) using prospective
samples submitted for Lyme serology testing. Five hundred and twenty (520) serum
samples were tested on both the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi
IgG/IgM ELISA Test and on the predicate B. burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA Test. The
results are summarized in the following table.
