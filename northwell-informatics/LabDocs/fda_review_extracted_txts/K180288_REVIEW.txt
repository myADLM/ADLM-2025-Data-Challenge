SPECIAL 510(K): DEVICE MODIFICATION
OIR DECISION SUMMARY
510(k) Number: _K180288___
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the applicant’s own class
II device requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:
1. The name and 510(k) number of the applicant’s previously cleared device.
510(k) Device Name
Clearance Date Primary Reason for 510(k) Submission
Number
K031899 QuickVue Influenza 9/11/2003 Initial 510(k) – the data used for this submission was primarily from the
A+B Test clinical and analytical QuickVue Influenza (A/B) test studies (reference
K991633). The primary difference between the two assays is that
QuickVue Influenza A+B Test provides separate results for influenza A
and influenza B. Whereas, QuickVue Influenza (A/B) test only
provides one positive result which could be influenza A or B.
Specimen types: nasal swab, nasal wash, nasal aspirate.
K053146 QuickVue Influenza 12/14/2005 This 510(k) included a clinical study performed with QuickVue
A+B Test Influenza A+B Test. Clinical data for nasal swab, nasopharyngeal
swab, and frozen nasal wash specimens was submitted.
K092698 QuickVue Influenza 9/15/2009 Provided analytical reactivity data for A/California/04/2009 (A 2009
A+B Test H1N1 Virus)
K131619 QuickVue Influenza 6/28/2013 Provided analytical reactivity data for the A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9
A+B Test Virus)
2. Applicant’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as
described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed instructions for use.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S) in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the
FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.
1) QuickVue Influenza A+B Test was originally developed and manufactured using standard
manual lateral flow techniques. This manual manufacturing process can result in quality
lateral flow immunoassays, but can yield product with a high degree of variability due to
the process parameters not being under tight control.
Quidel embarked on improving product consistency and performance by focusing on
improving the way components were processed through automation, using a proprietary
process called Web manufacturing. Web manufacturing is a continuous process that holds
critical processing steps in tight control. The Web system ensures that every foot of
product on the reel is exposed to conditions within specification limits. Any product that
fails to meet product specifications are marked and removed from the lot prior to further
processing. The better control of the manufacturing process parameters via the

implementation of the Web system led to significant improvements in product
performance.
2) The product instructions for use (package insert) was updated to add the new clinical
performance data generated using the modified QuickVue Influenza A+B Test (see
Section 6 below) and to remove the old clinical performance data generated using the
QuickVue Influenza A+B Test as previously FDA-cleared in K031899 and K053146.
3) The product instructions for use (package insert) was updated to remove nasal aspirate and
nasal wash specimens from the list of claimed upper respiratory specimen types, and to
add the relevant up to date FDA recommended warning and limitation statements

5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the
device and its components, and the results of the analysis.
The Risk Assessment process used was based on an internal Quidel Risk Management
Procedure (QIN002), which follows the requirements in ISO 14971.
Using this procedure, the primary failures/risks associated with transferring QuickVue
Influenza A+B to the Web manufacturing process, as well as the process controls were
analyzed.
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities
required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.
Based on the Risk Analysis, Quidel followed its established internal procedures when
developing, validating, and transferring QuickVue Influenza A+B to the Web manufacturing
process . Several component level validations were completed. The primary validation
encompassed testing multiple lots of components to demonstrate that the process controls
were effective and that the entire product when manufactured on Web equipment met the
manufacturing specifications.
In addition to this validation, a Stability Study was conducted that gathered both real-time and
accelerated data.
Furthermore, Quidel conducted a new prospective clinical study using the modified devices to
demonstrate that the performance of the modified QuickVue Influenza A+B Test meets the
Class II performance special control specified in 21 CFR 866.3328. (See Section 6 below).

6. Clinical Performance
The clinical performance of the modified device was evaluated in a prospective multi-center
field clinical study during two distinct influenza seasons in the United States, February through
May 2017 and October 2017 through January 2018. Performance for influenza A was
established when influenza A/H3 and A/H1pdm09 were the predominant influenza A viruses
in circulation in the United States.
In this prospective clinical study, the performance of the modified QuickVue Influenza A+B Test
was compared to an FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay. This study was conducted
at five (5) clinical sites in the USA which represent CLIA waived testing environments comprised
of Urgent Care, Pediatric, and General Practice offices. A total of forty-eight (48) operators from
the five intended user sites participated in the study.
Two (2) nasal or two (2) nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from each of the 1183
patients enrolled in the study. All clinical samples were collected from symptomatic patients
meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Thirty-nine percent (39%) of the patients tested were
<5 years of age, forty-one percent (41%) 5-<18 years of age, and twenty percent (20%) ≥18 years
of age. Forty-eight percent (48%) were male and fifty-two percent (52%) were female.
On-site testing of one nasal swab or nasopharyngeal swab specimen in the QuickVue
Influenza A+B Test was performed by CLIA waived test operators within one (1) hour of
specimen collection. This swab specimen was incubated for one (1) minute with the
Extraction Reagent Solution before addition of the dipstick. The other swab specimen was
placed in viral transport media and stored at 2°C to 8°C prior to testing with the FDA-cleared
influenza molecular assay.
Out of the 1183 nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens tested, there were no invalid
QuickVue Influenza A+B Test results, but there were five (5) invalid comparator test results;
therefore, 1178 evaluable specimens, including 924 nasopharyngeal swab specimen and 254
nasal swab specimens, were included in the performance analysis below.

7. Conclusion
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the
indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the applicant’s
description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified
and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed.
The applicant has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k)
Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the
predicate device.
