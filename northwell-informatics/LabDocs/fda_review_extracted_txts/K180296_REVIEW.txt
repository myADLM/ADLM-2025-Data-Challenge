identifying patients who may be at risk for developing diabetes. The measurement of %
HbA1c is recommended as a marker of long-term metabolic control in persons with
diabetes mellitus.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
For in vitro diagnostic use.
This device has significant negative interference with fetal hemoglobin (HbF). HbA1c
results are invalid for patients with abnormal amounts of HbF including those with
known Heredity Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin.
This test should not be used to diagnose:
· Diabetes during pregnancy
· Patients with an elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF > 10%) such as hereditary
persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH)
· Patients with a hemoglobinopathy but normal red cell turnover (e.g. sickle cell
trait)
· Patients with abnormal red cell turnover (e.g. anemias from hemolysis and iron
deficiency)
· Patients with iron deficiency and hemolytic anemia, various hemoglobinopathies,
thalassemias, hereditary spherocytosis, malignancies, and severe chronic hepatic
and renal disease
· Patients that have received a blood transfusion within the past 3 weeks
· Patients that have received cancer chemotherapy within the past 3 weeks
In cases of rapidly evolving type 1 diabetes the increase of HbA1c values might be
delayed compared to the acute increase in glucose concentrations. In these conditions
diabetes mellitus must be diagnosed based on plasma glucose concentration and/or the
typical clinical symptoms.
HbA1c testing should not replace glucose testing for type 1diabetes, in pediatric patients
and in pregnant women.
Coagulated or hemolyzed samples cannot be used with Afinion HbA1c Dx. Samples with
> 14% hemolysis (2000 mg/dL) may return an information code.
If the sample has a hemoglobin value below 6 g/dL or above 20 g/dL, no test result will
be reported and an information code will be displayed.

L. Test Principle:
A blood sample is collected with the integrated sampling device, which is then inserted into
the Alere HbA1c Dx test cartridge. The cartridge/sampling device combination is then placed
into the cartridge chamber of the Alere Afinion AS100 Analyzer. The sample is
automatically diluted and mixed with a solution that releases hemoglobin from the
erythrocytes. After the hemoglobin is precipitated, the sample mixture is transferred to a blue
boronic acid conjugate which binds to the cis-diols of glycated hemoglobin. This reaction
mixture is soaked through a filter membrane and all precipitated hemoglobin, conjugate-
bound and unbound (i.e. glycated and nonglycated hemoglobin) remains on the membrane.
Excess conjugate is removed with a washing reagent. The analyzer measures the reflectance
of the precipitate on the membrane as blue (glycated hemoglobin) and red (total hemoglobin)
color intensities. The analyzer calculates a ratio proportional to the percentage of HbA1c in
the sample and displays as the % HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP).

Capillary blood (fingerstick) precision:
Capillary blood (fingerstick) precision estimates are based on a combination of three
separate studies as described below:
i. Capillary blood (fingerstick) precision estimates for repeatability and
between-lot were calculated from measurements obtained during the method
comparison study. Ten intended use operators analyzed duplicate fingerstick
samples from 170 subjects with three reagent lots in total (two lots per site) on
five Afinion AS100 analyzers at three sites. The samples were grouped into
four %HbA1c concentration intervals (4.00-5.99, 6.00-6.99, 7.00-9.99, 10.00-
15.00) and analyzed according to CLSI guideline EP05-A3. Results are
presented in the table below:

ii. To capture repeatability, between-instrument, and between-operator precision
estimates, an external study was performed at three point-of-care moderate
complexity laboratory sites in the US. Samples in four %HbA1c concentration
intervals (4.00-5.99, 6.00-6.99, 7.00-9.99, 10.00-15.00) from five or six
subjects per interval were analyzed by three operators per site using two
Afinion AS100 analyzers. Six fingerstick samples (two fingerstick samples
from each subject were collected and measured per operator) were analyzed
for a total of 30 or 36 measurements (M) per sample level at each site (n=90
or n=96 measurements across sites). The results from all sites combined are

*This estimate of the Total %CV for High HbA1c (≥ 10%) is based on the within run component
of variance estimated in the Fingerstick Precision Study since the precision study has a larger
sample size than the Fingerstick Accuracy Precision Study.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was previously established for the range of 4.00 – 15.00 % HbA1c
(DCCT/NGSP) in k050574.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Afinion HbA1c Dx assay is certified with the National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP). The NGSP certification expires in one year. See
NGSP website for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org. Traceability is
verified annually through the IFCC Whole Blood Monitoring Program.
Test results are calculated in mmol/mol (IFCC). HbA1c values are further reported
according to the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP)
recommendations at DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial) level. The
IFCC Master Equation for the relationship between the IFCC-Reference Method
(RM) and the NGSP-Designated Comparison Method (DCM) is used for conversion
of the test results:
NGSP-HbA1c (%) = DCCT-HbA1c (%) = 0.09148 x IFCC-HbA1c (mmol/mol) +
2.152
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Quantification was previously established as 4.0% HbA1c in k050574.
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Exogenous and endogenous interference
Interference from 20 drug substances and six endogenous compounds was
evaluated using K -EDTA venous whole blood samples with low (~6.5%) and
2
high (≥ 8.5%) HbA1c levels. Test samples were prepared by spiking each drug or
endogenous substance into the low and high samples and comparing to control

concentration. The results support the sponsor’s claim that hemolysis up to 13.8%
does not interfere with their device. The labeling states that “hemolyzed samples
with > 14% hemolysis (2000 mg/dL) may return an information code.”.
ii. Cross reactivity with Hemoglobin Derivatives
Potential cross reactivity with acetylated hemoglobin, carbamylated hemoglobin,
labile HbA1c, and glycated albumin was evaluated. Two K -EDTA venous whole
2
blood samples at 6.5% and ~8.5% HbA1c were spiked with the potential
interferent (6.0 mg/mL acetylated hemoglobin, 14.1 mg/mL carbamylated
hemoglobin, 12.4 mg/mL labile HbA1c, 7.7 mg/mL glycated albumin). Ten
replicates of test and control samples were analyzed. The sponsor defined
significant interference as greater than or equal to 7% difference from the
expected concentration. The testing results support the sponsor’s claim in the
labeling that there is no cross reactivity with acetylated hemoglobin (4.6 mg/mL),
carbamylated hemoglobin (13.8 mg/mL), labile HbA1c (11.4 mg/mL), or glycated
albumin (7.7 mg/mL).
Potential cross reactivity from HbA0, HbA1a and HbA1b was evaluated using
100 samples. Two HbA1c concentrations of pooled K -EDTA venous whole
2
blood samples at 6.0% and 9.0% HbA1c (range 4.3% to 13.93% HbA1c)
containing HbA0 (82% to 95%), HbA1a (0.4% to 1.4%) and HbA1b (0.4% to
2.3%) were tested in singlicate using an Afinion AS100 analyzer and compared to
measurements made using a NGSP comparator method (Tosoh G8 HPLC). The
sponsor defined significant interference as greater than or equal to 7% difference
from the expected concentration. The testing results support the sponsor’s claim
in the labeling that there is no cross reactivity with HbA0 (up to 95%), HbA1a (up
to 1.4%), and HbA1b (up to 2.3%).
iii) Hemoglobin Variant Interference
For the hemoglobin variant interference study was performed using a total of 221
K -EDTA venous whole blood samples known to contain common hemoglobin
2
variants (HbA2, HbS, HbC, HbE, HbD, and HbF). Results obtained by a FDA
cleared method that has been demonstrated to be free from the hemoglobin
interference being tested (Premier Hb9210 for HbA2, HbAS, HbE, and Tosoh
Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer HLC-723 G8 for HbF). The sponsor’s
definition of non-significant interference is ≤7% mean relative deviation between
the Afinion HbA1c Dx result and the NGSP comparator method.

HbD -2.2 % (-4.1% to 0%) -2.9 % (-5.9% to 0%)
10.4% HbF is the highest HbF concentration where no
HbF significant interference is observed with significant
interference defined as > ±7%.
The testing results show there is no significant interference for Hemoglobin A2 (≥
5.7%), Hemoglobin S (≥ 42%), Hemoglobin C (≥ 36%), Hemoglobin E (≥ 26%),
and Hemoglobin D (≥ 42%).
The package insert labeling states:
No significant interference for Hemoglobin A2, Hemoglobin C, Hemoglobin
D, Hemoglobin E, and Hemoglobin S up to the levels stated.
The results show that there is significant interference due to the presence of
HbF at a HbF concentration of > 10.4%. The device labeling contains the
following prominent boxed warning:
“This device has significant negative interference with fetal hemoglobin
(HbF). HbA1c results are invalid for patients with abnormal amounts of
HbF including those with known Heredity Persistence of Fetal
Hemoglobin. Refer to the Analytical specificity and Limitations sections
in this package insert for details.”

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was conducted using 120 capillary (fingerstick) whole
blood samples and matched K -EDTA venous whole blood samples ranging from 4.6
2
to 11.4 % HbA1c. All samples were tested with two Afinion HbA1c Dx reagent lots
at three moderate complexity point-of-care laboratories. The distribution of samples
spanned a concentration around the clinical decision points as follows:
Hemoglobin A1c level Number of samples Percent of samples
4 – 5% 5 4.2%
5.1 – 6% 15 12.5%
6.1 – 6.5% 30 25.0%

8.1 – 9% 10 8.3%
9.1 – 15% 10 8.3%
Total samples 120 100%
Singlicate capillary and venous whole blood results from the Afinion HbA1c Dx test
system were compared to average results from matched K -EDTA venous whole
2
blood samples tested in duplicate using a NGSP comparator method (Tosoh G8
HPLC).
Deming (weighted) and Passing-Bablok regression analyses were performed for the
Afinion HbA1c Dx assay versus the comparator method.
