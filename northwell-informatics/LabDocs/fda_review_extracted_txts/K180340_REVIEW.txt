2. Indication(s) for use:
The Stat Profile® Prime Plus Analyzer System is indicated for use by healthcare
professionals in clinical laboratory settings for quantitative determination of glucose,
creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen in heparinized arterial and venous whole blood.
Glucose measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of carbohydrate
metabolism disturbances including diabetes mellitus, neonatal hypoglycemia, and
idiopathic hypoglycemia, and of pancreatic islet cell tumor.
Creatinine measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of certain renal
conditions and for monitoring adequacy of dialysis.
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
certain renal and metabolic diseases.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Not for point-of-care use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Stat Profile® Prime Plus Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The Stat Profile® Prime Plus Analyzer System consists of the analyzer, sensor cartridges,
calibrator packs, auto-cartridge quality control packs (internal controls), ampuled quality
control materials (external controls) and thermal paper for an onboard printer. Optionally, it
provides for reading of barcode labels (such as operator badges and data sheets).
The Stat Profile® Prime Plus Analyzer has slots to accommodate two sensor cartridges
(Primary and Auxiliary). The analyzer will determine the configuration of the system by
detecting which sensor cards are installed. The reporting of CO-Oximeter parameters (or not
reporting them) will also be determined by the selection of the Sensor Cards:
Primary Sensor Card Port: There are two options for the primary sensor card:
· Primary Sensor Card 1 shall enable and report glucose in addition to other select analytes.
· Primary Sensor Card 2 shall enable and report glucose in addition to other select analytes.
Auxiliary Sensor Card Port:
The reporting of Creatinine and BUN parameters (or not reporting them) is determined by the
selection of the Auxiliary Sensor Card:
· Auxiliary Sensor Card 1 enables Creatinine and BUN parameters
· Auxiliary Sensor Card 2 is a “dummy” sensor card, and will not report any parameters.

L. Test Principle:
Glucose: Glucose measurement is based on the level of H O produced during the enzymatic
2 2
reaction between glucose and oxygen molecules in the presence of the glucose oxidase
enzyme. At a constant potential of 0.70 volts, electroactive H O is oxidized at the surface of
2 2
the platinum anode. The current generated by the flow of electrons at the surface of the
platinum electrode is proportional to the glucose concentration of the sample.
BUN: The Prime Plus Analyzer uses urease, which has been chemically bonded to a
membrane, to catalyze the conversion of urea present in the sample to ammonia and CO . At
2
the pH of the sample, ammonia converts predominantly to the ammonium ion. An
ammonium ion selective electrode is used to detect the ammonium formed by the above
reactions. This measurement is then related to the concentration of urea present in the
original sample via the Nernst equation.
Creatinine: The Prime Plus Creatinine sensor uses 3 enzymes. These 3 enzymes catalyze the
conversion of Creatinine, ultimately forming formaldehyde, glycine, and hydrogen peroxide.
At a constant potential of 0.70 volts, electroactive H O is oxidized at the surface of the
2 2
platinum anode. The current generated by the flow of electrons at the surface of the platinum
electrode is proportional to the Creatinine concentration of the sample.

Run-to-Run imprecision using whole blood samples:
To assess run-to-run precision using whole blood, triplicate analyses were performed
on a single whole blood sample in ten separate runs during a single day. The systems
were recalibrated before each triplicate run. Samples were analyzed on three
analyzers. Representative summary results from one analyzer for the three analyte
test systems are shown below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies on the Stat Profile® Prime Plus analyzer were conducted to establish
and verify the analytical measurement range for each test system. The studies were
performed on three analyzers using Li-heparinized venous whole blood for Glucose,
BUN and creatinine. Low and high concentration pools were mixed and serial
dilution samples (N=10 or 11) were prepared and tested in triplicate. The results
from each candidate analyzer for each parameter were compared to the average
duplicate results from the comparative method on the Stat Profile pHOx Ultra
analyzer. All three analyzers yielded similar results. The results of the least squares
linear regression analysis from one representative analyzer are summarized below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The traceability of the parameters measured by Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer are
traceable to NIST reference standards. These are listed below:
Creatinine Test: It is traceable to NIST SRM 967a creatinine.
BUN Test: It is traceable to NIST SRM 912a urea.
Glucose Test: It is traceable to NIST SRM 917a D-glucose.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate the limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection
(LoD) and limit of quantification (LoQ) for glucose, BUN and creatinine using
altered whole blood samples. Study samples were prepared from heparinized venous
whole blood samples. All prepared samples were measured on the reference analyzer
to confirm target values.

e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was performed using whole blood collected in lithium heparin
vacutainers. The potential interfering substances were tested at two analyte
concentrations. If interference was identified, then a dose response study was
performed to determine the concentration where the interfering substance may alter
the results.
The sponsor defined interference as a specified bias or %bias from the test
concentration as shown in the following table.
Analyte Interference Bias Specification

BUN ± 10.0 %

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A minimum of 200 lithium heparinized arterial and venous whole blood specimens
from hospital patients were analyzed in syringe format in singlet on three Stat
Profile® Prime Plus analyzers and two pHOx Ultra analyzers for each parameter. In
order to cover the hard to find sample range, venous whole blood specimens from
consenting donors were spiked or diluted to cover the analytical measurement ranges
for all three analytes, glucose, BUN and creatinine. The singlet result from each test
analyzer was compared to the average of the results from each comparative method.
Representative summary result from one analyzer for the three analyte tests are listed
in the below table.
