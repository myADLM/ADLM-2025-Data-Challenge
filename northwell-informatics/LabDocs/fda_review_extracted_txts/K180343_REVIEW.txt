K180343/S003 - Page 2 of 12

--- Page 3 ---
The LensHooke X1 and X1 PRO Semen Quality Analyzer integrates optical design and image
analysis, combined with an artificial intelligence image processing method, to fully automate the
analysis of semen quality, including semen pH, sperm concentration, sperm morphology and
motility. The images are captured and recorded by cameras and with image processing methods,
the locations of sperm are detected. The sperm concentration is analyzed by the sperm unit
density; the sperm motility is calculated by tracing sperm trajectories, and the sperm morphology
is calculated by comparing head and tail percentage. The chromatographic image of pH is
captured through a camera and with image saturation and brightness analysis, the level of pH is
determined.

A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability
A precision study was carried out over the course of one day by three operators using three
analyzer/cassette lot combinations. Due to the limited stability of semen samples, each “day”
in the statistical analysis represents different times of day (e.g. every 4 hours = 1 “day”).
Measurements were separated into five separate 4-hour time periods or “days”. The study
included two replicates per run, and two runs every 4 hours, five times/day (3
operator/analyzer/cassette lot combinations × 2 replicates × 2 runs × 5 “days”) for a total of
60 replicates per sperm concentration/sperm motility/sperm morphology level. Seven semen
samples with the following combinations of sperm concentration, motility, and morphology
levels were evaluated:
Conc. M/mL Motility % Morphology %
Low Sample 1/ 5-10 Sample 2/ <2 Sample 2/ <2
Middle Sample 2/ 50-100 Sample 4/ 30-50 Sample 6/ 3-8
High Sample 3/ 200-300 Sample 5/ 51-80 Sample 7/ 9-20

Every 4-hour run = one testing day
A separate repeatability study was conducted to evaluate the precision of the pH parameter
on the LensHooke device. The test was performed in one day at one site using three lots of
test cassettes and two LensHooke analyzers. Semen samples were prepared at six pH values
spread across the measuring range: 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.2, 7.8, and 8.0, verified by pH meter
(reference). Each sample was tested in 10 replicates for each of three lots on two LensHooke
analyzers. Results for pH met the predefined acceptance criteria.
Reproducibility
To evaluate the reproducibility performance of the LensHooke X1 Semen Quality Analyzer,
a precision study was conducted using a total of three cassette lots and three analyzers at
three point-of-care (POC) sites in Taiwan representative of POC sites in the U.S., including
POC operator equivalency (i.e. job title/position, education, experience, training). Three
levels of control solution (prepared latex beads concentration and pH levels (Low, Normal,
and High)) were tested in five replicates once per day for five days by one operator on one
analyzer using one cassette lot at each site as illustrated in the table below:

(106/mL) sample
Level
Low 0 6.2 5 5
Normal 19 ̶ 31 7.0 5 5
High 43 ̶ 58 7.8 5 5
For concentration and pH parameters and for each level of control tested, the mean, SD and
%CV of the various components of precision were calculated along with the %CV for
repeatability and reproducibility (total precision). The data were analyzed using two-way
nested ANOVA analysis. All results met the predefined acceptance criteria.

2. Linearity:
Linearity for sperm concentration and semen pH was evaluated using one analyzer and three
cassette lots. Semen samples were prepared at nine sperm concentrations ranging from 2–400
× 106/mL. Testing was performed in three replicates per lot per concentration level. The
linearity study for pH was performed using two analyzers and three cassette lots. Semen
samples were taken from volunteers and prepared using sodium phosphate monobasic and
sodium phosphate dibasic to create 13 pH intervals ranging from 5.8–8.2. Testing was
performed in three replicates per lot per pH level.
The mean and SD of results were calculated. Regression analysis was used to verify the
linear range and the polynomial method was employed to evaluate non-linearity. Sperm
concentration was demonstrated to be linear from 2–350 × 106/mL. Semen pH was
demonstrated to be linear from 5.8–8.2.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The potential interference of various substances on LensHooke X1 results were evaluated by
using two sperm concentration levels (50 ̶ 100 M/mL and 100 ̶ 200 M/mL). The following 11
interfering substances were tested in the study: vitamin B, testosterone, yeast, E. Coli, RBC,
WBC, urine, saliva, agglutination of semen sample, D-norgestrel, and β-estradiol. Samples
were tested in five replicates on one analyzer using three lots of test cassettes. Results were
compared to the SQA-V Analyzer. Study results showed that all tested interfering substances
met the acceptance criteria and no significant interference was caused by the tested
substances.
4. Accuracy (Instrument):
Method Comparison
A user performance study was conducted to determine test performance of the LensHooke X1
Semen Quality Analyzer when used by unassisted lay users following the instructions in the
package insert. The study was performed at three evaluation sites, including one internal site.
A total of 100 lay user participants, including 83 males and 17 females, ranging in age from
21-60 years were included in the study.
The study was conducted in two ways: 1) Performance of male lay users providing and
testing their own semen specimen; 2) Performance of lay users recruited to test semen
specimens provided by a subset of test subjects. Following collection of the specimen by the

Semen Quality Analyzer. After recording the results, a point-of-care (POC) professional at
the study site performed semen analysis on the layperson’s sample using the LensHooke X1
and the predicate/reference device, the SQA-V. Semen specimens spanning the analytical
measuring range of 2 ̶ 350 × 106/mL were analyzed during the study. Results from the user
performance study were compared and analyzed as follows: Layperson results vs. REF
results, POC results vs. REF results, and Layperson results vs. POC results.

Validation of pH
POC personnel performed the pH study by testing the semen samples used in the method
comparison with pH test strips. Results were obtained by visual comparison to the pH color
card. The pH strip covered the range of 5.0 to 8.5 with 0.5 intervals. The pH results obtained
visually using the pH strip were compared to the pH results obtained from the LensHooke X1
and X1 PRO during the method comparison/user study. All results met the predefined
acceptance criteria.

B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
Detection Limits (LoB/LoD/LoQ)
A study was conducted to determine the detection limits of the LensHooke X1 Semen Quality
Analyzer. Semen samples were taken from volunteers and two interval ranges were prepared:
sperm-free seminal plasma and low concentration seminal plasma. Semen was centrifuged to
obtain sperm-free seminal plasma to a concentration of ~0 M/mL (blank sample) as verified by
manual microscope. Low concentration seminal plasma was prepared by diluting semen to a
concentration of ~2 ̶ 8 M/mL as verified by manual microscope. Blank and low-level samples
were divided into four aliquots and tested in five replicates once a day for three days, using two
lots of test cassettes and two analyzers. Results were calculated, and the detection limits were
determined to be:
Limit of Blank (LoB) = 0 M/mL
Limit of Detection (LoD) = 1.8 M/mL
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) = 7.2 M/mL
Sample Volume
A specimen volume study was performed to determine the minimum sample volume at which
consistent and accurate results would be obtained on the LensHooke analyzer. Semen samples at
low and high concentrations were used to evaluate sample volumes at 35, 40 and 45 µL. Testing
was performed in five replicates, using three lots of test cassettes and results were compared to
the reference method SQA-V analyzer. Success was determined by calculating the bias of
specimen volume effect on concentration, motility, and morphology results. Study results
demonstrated that measurements were consistent irrespective of specimen volume when
specimen volume is 35 ̶ 45 μL. The minimum sample volume for testing semen parameters on
the LensHooke analyzer was determined to be 35 μL.
To determine the minimum sample volume for pH testing, a semen sample with pH value of 7.8
was used to evaluate samples at 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 μL. Testing was performed in three
replicates, using three lots of test cassettes on two LensHooke analyzers for a total six replicates
per sample volume. Results were compared to the pH meter (reference). Success was determined

by calculating the bias of specimen volume effect on pH results. Study results demonstrated that
measurements were consistent irrespective of specimen volume when specimen volume is 30 ̶ 80
μL. The minimum sample volume for testing pH on the LensHooke analyzer was determined to
be 30 μL.
Cassette Stability
A stability study was conducted to determine the shelf-life of the LensHooke Semen Test
Cassette in real-time ( at 2°C and 25°C) and under accelerated conditions (at 40°C). Three semen
samples with varying sperm concentrations (<2 M/mL, 20 ̶ 50 M/mL, 51 ̶ 100 M/mL) and pH
levels (6.2, 7.2, 7.8) were tested in three replicates using one analyzer and three lots of test
cassettes. All results were compared against the reference method SQA-V Analyzer. Study
results demonstrated test cassette strip performance for 8 months under accelerated (40°C)
conditions, equivalent to a 2-year shelf-life at room temperature, and 24 months under real-time
conditions (2°C and 25°C). Results support the 2 year shelf-life claim at refrigerated and room
temperature conditions.
Cleaning, Disinfection and Robustness
The cleaning and disinfection study was performed to evaluate the robustness of the LensHooke
X1 PRO analyzer using CaviWipes disinfecting towelettes. Two wipe cycles were used per test
process following the instructions: one wipe for cleaning and one wipe for disinfection.
Accuracy of the LensHooke X1 PRO device was assessed before cleaning/disinfecting and after
simulated use cleaning/disinfecting conditions for the 3-year lifetime of the meter. Simulated use
is estimated to be 10,950 times (10 times per day × 365 days × 3 years). Study results supported
the 3-year lifetime claim.
Virucidal Efficacy
A disinfection efficacy validation study was performed to evaluate the disinfectant used to clean
and disinfect the exterior surface of the LensHooke device against duck Hepatitis B Virus
(dHBV). The study was performed using CaviWipes disinfecting towelettes on different material
types of the LensHooke devices, including PC, Silicone, PE and ABS+PC. Clinical serum
(DHBsAG) was evaluated for virus recovery control, neutralizer effectiveness/viral interference
control, cytotoxicity control, cell viability control, and virus stock titer control.
The disinfection efficacy study results demonstrated that CaviWipes disinfecting towelettes was
effective in removing duck Hepatitis B Virus from the subject devices, supporting the virucidal
and disinfection procedure.
