Configuration of the AssureTech Panel Dip Tests and the AssureTech Quick Cup Tests
can consist of any combination of the above listed drug analytes.
The test may yield positive results for the prescription drugs Buprenorphine,
Nortriptyline, Oxazepam, Secobarbital, Propoxyphene and Oxycodone when taken at or
above prescribed doses. It is not intended to distinguish between prescription use or abuse
of these drugs. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with
any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive. The test
provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical method must
be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS or LC/MS is the preferred
confirmatory method.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For over-the-counter use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable; this is a visually read single use device.
I. Device Description:
The AssureTech Panel Dip Tests and AssureTech Quick Cup Tests are
immunochromatographic assays that use a lateral flow system for the qualitative
detection of Amphetamine, Oxazepam, Cocaine, Marijuana, Methamphetamine,
Morphine, Oxycodone, Secobarbital, Buprenorphine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine,
Phencyclidine, Methadone, EDDP, Nortriptyline, and Propoxyphene (target analytes) in
human urine. The tests are the first step in a two-step process. The test strips used in the
AssureTech Panel Dip Tests and AssureTech Quick Cup Tests are identical.
The AssureTech Panel Dip Tests comprise two items, a urine collection cup and the dip
card with a plastic casing as the lateral flow device. The AssureTech Quick Cup Tests
comprise a urine collection cup and a quick cup test with a lateral flow device that will
start when the cap is screwed onto cup. Each test device is sealed with a desiccant in an
aluminum pouch.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The AssureTech Panel Dip Tests and AssureTech Quick Cup Tests are rapid tests for the
qualitative detection of Amphetamine, Oxazepam, Cocaine, Marijuana, Methamphetamine,
Morphine, Oxycodone, Secobarbital, Buprenorphine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine,
Phencyclidine, Methadone, EDDP, Nortriptyline and Propoxyphene in urine samples. The
tests are lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays. During testing, a urine specimen
migrates upward by capillary action. If a target drug present in the urine specimen is below
the cut-off concentration, it will not saturate the binding sites of its specific monoclonal
mouse antibody coated on gold particles. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured
by immobilized drug-conjugate in the test line region and a visible colored line will show up
in the test line region. The colored line will not form in the test line region if the target drug
level exceeds its cutoff-concentration because it will saturate all the binding sites of the
antibody coated on the particles. A band should form in the control region of the devices
(coated with anti-mouse antibodies) regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the
sample to indicate that the tests have been performed properly.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of -100% cut-off, -
75% cut-off, -50% cut-off, -25% cut-off, cut-off, +25% cut-off, +50% cut-off, +75% cut-
off and +100% cut-off. The samples used in the precision studies were prepared by
spiking drug into negative urine samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by
LC/MS. All sample aliquots were blindly labeled by the person who prepared the samples
and who did not take part in the sample testing. For each concentration, tests were
performed two runs per day for 25 days per device in a randomized order. The results
obtained are summarized in the following tables for 2-ethylidene-1, 5-dimethyl, 3-
diphenylpyrolidine (EDDP), Nortriptyline (TCA), and Propoxyphene (PPX). The
precision data for the remaining drugs of abuse devices were reported in k153465,
k151211, k152025, k161044, and k170049.

Specificity:
To test specificity, drug metabolites and other components that are likely to interfere in
urine samples were tested using three lots of each device. For each target drug, drug
metabolites and other related compounds were added to drug-free urine at different
concentration levels, and the lowest concentration that resulted in a positive result was
determined. The cross-reactivity result for each compound is listed below for EDDP,
Nortriptyline, and Propoxyphene. The data for the remaining drugs of abuse devices
were reported in k153465, k151211, k152025, k161044, and k170049. There were no
differences in cross-reactivity observed for the AssureTech Panel Dip Tests and

Effect of Urine Specific Gravity and Urine pH:
To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine pH, urine samples with 1.000
to 1.035 specific gravity or urine samples with pH 4 to 9 (tested in increments of 1 pH
unit) were spiked with target drugs at 25% below and 25% above cut-off levels. These
samples were tested using three lots of each device. For all devices, results were all
positive for samples at 25% above cut-off and all negative for samples at 25% below cut-
off. There were no differences in performance observed for the AssureTech Panel Dip
Tests and AssureTech Quick Cup Tests.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies for the AssureTech Panel Dip Tests and the AssureTech
Quick Cup Tests were performed with three laboratory assistants for each device.
Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered clinical samples for each drug
per device. The samples were blind labeled and compared to LC/MS results. The
results from each of the three operators for each format are presented in the tables
below for EDDP, Nortriptyline, and Propoxyphene. The data for the remaining drugs
of abuse were reported in k153465, k151211, k152025, k161044, and k170049.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Lay-user Study
A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 310 lay persons using
each device (AssureTech Panel Dip Tests and AssureTech Quick Cup Tests). The lay
users had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 18 to
> 50 years. Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations; negative, +/-
75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of the cutoff by spiking drugs into drug-free pooled urine
specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by LC/MS. Each sample
was aliquoted into individual containers and blind-labeled. Each participant was
provided with the package insert, 1 blind labeled sample and a device. Each device
containing test strips for all 15 drug analytes was tested. Results were similar between the
AssureTech Panel Dip Tests and AssureTech Quick Cup Tests, and representative results
are provided for the AssureTech Panel Dip Tests in the table below.
