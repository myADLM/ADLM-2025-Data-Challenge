L. Test Principle:
The inui In-Home Urine Analysis Test System detects urine analytes based on colorimetry. A
color reaction occurs on the chemical test pads, based on the concentration of chemicals
present in the urine sample. The color reaction is captured as an image using the mobile
device camera and read using the mobile application on the display screen of the mobile
device. The results are reported as specified by the measurement range for each test.
Protein: This test is based on the protein error-of-indicator principle that produces a color
change.
Glucose: This test is based on a double sequential enzyme reaction.
Leukocytes: This test is based on the action of esterase present in leukocytes, which catalyzes
the hydrolysis of an indoxyl ester derivative. The indoxyl ester liberated reacts with a
diazonium salt to produce a color change.
Nitrites: This test depends on the conversion of nitrate to nitrite by the action of Gram-
negative bacteria in the urine.

Ketones: This test is based on the reaction of acetoacetic acid with sodium nitroprusside in a
strongly basic medium to produce a color change.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated with two studies; each study used three spiked urine
solutions made from a pool of negative urine samples.
The first study determined the agreement between measurements using 3 phones and
3 paddle lot combinations with a single operator under one lighting condition with
testing performed in one day. The study used 40 replicates resulting in N=120 per
test level for the three controls solutions (P1 negative, P2 low positive and P3 high
positive). Results for each control level for each analyte are summarized in the table
below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Five different lighting conditions representing incandescent (INC), compact
fluorescent (CFL), LED, daylight (D65) and halogen (HAL) were used to determine
the linearity and limit of detection for each analyte. Measurements were made using
three phones, three paddle lots, three operators, and three replicates = N of 45 for
each solution. Some solutions had less than 45 replicates because no test result was
generated or the samples were depleted. Contrived samples were generated using a
negative fresh urine sample spiked with commercially available reagents to obtain the
target range of concentrations. For each analyte, the cutoff levels were defined as
concentrations where at least 50% of results belonged to the next corresponding level.
The results are provided in the tables below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The device is not traceable to a standard or method.
d. Detection limit:
See Section M.1.b. for evaluation of the detection limit.
e. Analytical specificity:
Three solutions were used for interference study prepared from a natural pool of
negative urine samples obtained from urine donors. The solution “Neg Ctrl” is a
pooled human negative urine for all analytes. The solution “Pos 1” is low positive
urine for Leukocyte (2 U/mL), Nitrite (0.1 mg/L), and Glucose (260 mg/dL)
concentrations. The solution “Pos 2” is a low to moderate positive urine solution for
Protein (100 mg/dL) and Ketone (40 mg/dL) concentrations.
To determine whether a substance is potentially interfering, high concentration of the
substance was spiked in the positive (Pos 1 and Pos 2) and negative controls (Neg
Ctl). A substance is considered an interferent if there was a result ± 1 level from the
expected result/control. Concentrations of the potentially interfering substances that
did not produce a change in both the negative and positive pools are shown in the
table below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Two method comparison studies were performed. Method comparison study 1 was
performed to evaluated glucose, nitrite and ketones and method comparison study 2 was
performed to evaluated protein and leukocytes. Both studies were conducted using
subjects at two clinical sites. The agreement with the predicate device was evaluated
with results obtained by lay users testing the inui Device (proposed device) with urine
samples compared with results generated using the Siemens Multistix 10SG (predicate
device) test strips tested and visually read by professional users. De-identified urine
samples were collected from various geographic locations in the US. 338 samples were
tested for method comparison study-1 and 177samples were tested for method
comparison study-2 (<3.0% of the total samples were contrived). Subjects were asked to
test two clinical samples, their own urine sample and one provided to them from the
collected pool of de-identified urine samples. The urine samples were randomized and
blinded to both the lay users and professionals testing the samples. To adequately cover
the positive ranges across all analyte levels, contrived specimens were included in the
study. The data from each site was combined and are presented in the tables below
showing the percent exact agreement and the percent agreement within ±1 color block.

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes X or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes X or No ________
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes X or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with these devices. Samples are applied
directly to the urinalysis strips as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The device is intended to be used with a freshly collected urine sample. The App
instructs the user to image the test strip (to obtain a test result) no more than two minutes
after sample application.
5. Calibration:
The inui In-Home Urine Analysis Device paddle is affixed with a quick response code
(QR). The QR code is a unique ID that will contain information including the paddle
expiration and lot number. The QR code has a built-in quality control system to reject
the paddle if it has been used previously on the same phone.
6. Quality Control:
The reference color bar (RCB) on the label serves as an internal control for color
correction of each captured image to account for the different ambient conditions.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Studies were performed to validate insensitivity of the inui In-Home Analysis Test System to
varying environmental and user conditions.
15

--- Page 16 ---
1. Lighting effect: The performance of the device in different lighting conditions and
illuminance was evaluated. The sponsor concluded having the phone flashlight or torch
light on allows the app algorithm to remove light variability. The labeling indicates that
testing should be conducted under normal household lighting conditions (i.e.
incandescent, CFL, LED or halogen). The App warns the user if there is improper
lighting conditions or the lighting conditions are not optimal.
2. Height and Angle study: image capture height, angle and alignment was evaluated to
determine optimum range to capture the CTP paddle image. The optimal height and angle
is incorporated in the app to give real time feedback to the user holding the phone. The
App detects the height and angle of the strip or if the strip is misaligned and will warn the
user with real time feedback.
3. Battery Life and Torch Light Intensity study: The sponsor evaluated whether the
flashlight or torch light intensity correlates with the battery life and the phones ability to
capture the CTP test paddle image. The study concluded that torch light intensity is not
dependent on battery life.
4. Paddle Air Exposure study: The effect of air exposure on the chemical test pads on the
paddle was evaluated. The study concluded the prolonged exposure (>15 minutes) to air
can reduce activity of the CTP. The package insert states under “Precautions”:
Conducting the test is very time sensitive. Please read all directions and follow all steps
as instructed. Do NOT open pouch until instructed to by the app.
5. Paddle Dip time study: The paddle dip time was evaluated at 1, 3, 7 and 10 seconds using
3 contrived urine solutions. There were 10 replicates for each of the 5 dip times. No
differences were observed between dip times and the analyte concentrations reported.
The package insert recommends under “Precautions”: Do not dip paddle in urine for
more than 1 second.
6. Single or Double Dip study: This study evaluated the effect of double dipping a paddle
into a urine sample. A double dip consisted of submerging the test paddles into contrived
urine solutions for one second, removing the paddles from the solution for another second
and finally submerging the paddles into the solution for a second time for an additional
second. The timer on the app was then initiated after the second submersion was
completed. No changes were observed between single dipping and double dipping of
paddles in regards to app results however the recommendation in the package insert
states: Do not use test paddle more than once.
7. Urine Temperature Variation study: The effect of urine temperature variation on analytes
was evaluated. Samples were tested at both 25°C and 35°C. Under both temperature
conditions ( 25 °C and 35 °C) all 5 analytes tested 100% concordance with the expected
results.

Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
