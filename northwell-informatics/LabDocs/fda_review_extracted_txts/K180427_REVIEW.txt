ng/mL. The assay is intended for use in laboratories with automated clinical
chemistry analyzers. This in vitro diagnostic device is for prescription use only.
The ARK Fentanyl Assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A
more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a
confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS)
or Liquid Chromatography/tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional
judgment should be exercised with any drug test result, particularly when the
preliminary test result is positive.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Performance data was collected on the Beckman Coulter AU680 analyzer.
I. Device Description:
The ARK Fentanyl Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay used for the
detection of fentanyl in human urine. The ARK Fentanyl Assay consists of
reagents R1 rabbit anti-fentanyl polyclonal antibody with substrate and R2
fentanyl derivative labeled with bacterial recombinant G6PDH enzyme. The ARK
Fentanyl Assay test system includes separately provided kits for the ARK Fentanyl
Assay, ARK Fentanyl Calibrator and ARK Fentanyl Control.

L. Test Principle:
The ARK Fentanyl Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay technique used
for the analysis of fentanyl in human urine. The assay is based on competition
between fentanyl in the patient specimen and fentanyl labeled with recombinant
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (rG6PDH) for antibody binding sites. As the
latter binds antibody, enzyme activity decreases. In the presence of fentany from

the patient specimen, enzyme activity increases and is proportional to the fentanyl
concentration. Active enzyme converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)
to NADH in the presence of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), resulting in an
absorbance change that is measured spectrophotometrically.

e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor evaluated the cross-reactivity of the following metabolites and
structural analogs of Fentanyl by spiking them into drug-free, negative
human urine to determine the minimum concentration that would give a
positive result approximately equivalent to the 1.0 ng/mL fentanyl cutoff.
These concentrations were used to determine the percent cross-reactivity
according to the formula:
Percent cross-reactivity = (Cutoff concentration / lowest concentration of
cross-reactant causing a positive result) x 100
