2. Indication(s) for use:
The Stat Profile® Prime Plus Analyzer System is intended for use by healthcare
professionals in clinical laboratory settings for the quantitative determination of sodium,
potassium, chloride, ionized calcium, and ionized magnesium in heparinized arterial and
venous whole blood.
Sodium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of aldosteronism, diabetes
insipidus, adrenal hypertension, Addison’s disease, dehydration, or diseases involving
electrolyte imbalance.
Potassium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of disease conditions
characterized by low or high potassium levels.
Chloride measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of electrolyte and
metabolic disorders such as cystic fibrosis and diabetic acidosis.
Ionized calcium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of parathyroid
disease, a variety of bone diseases, chronic renal disease and tetany (intermittent
muscular contractions or spasms).
Ionized magnesium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
hypomagnesemia (abnormally low levels of magnesium) and hypermagnesemia
(abnormally high levels of magnesium).
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Not for point of care use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Stat Profile® Prime Plus Analyzer System
I. Device Description:
The Stat Profile® Prime Plus Analyzer System is designed to be used in a clinical laboratory
setting. It consists of the analyzer, sensor cartridges, calibrator packs, auto-cartridge quality
control packs (internal controls), ampuled quality control materials (external controls) and
thermal paper for an onboard printer. Specimens are identified by scanning a barcode or by
manually entering the information via the touchscreen.
The Stat Profile® Prime Plus Analyzer has slots to accommodate two sensor cartridges
(primary and auxiliary). The analyzer will determine the configuration of the system by
detecting which sensor cards are installed. The reporting of CO-Oximeter parameters (or not
reporting them) will also be determined by the selection of the Sensor Cards, for which there
are two options:

L. Test Principle:
The sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium and ionized magnesium parameters are
measured by an ion-selective electrode (ISE) that selectively measures the activity of ionic
species. When the ISE is contacted with a sample, a potential is developed. The potential is
proportional to the logarithm of the ionic activity and is measured versus a reference
electrode, as described by the Nernst equation.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run and between-analyzer precision was evaluated by analyzing quality
control (QC) materials and whole blood samples in replicates of 20 on each of three
analyzers.

Run-to-run precision using whole blood
Estimates of the run-to-run precision were determined for the Stat Profile®
Prime Plus analyzers for whole bloods that were sampled from a syringe. A ten day
study was simulated by running samples followed by running a calibration and
repeating the process ten times. All three analyzers yielded similar results. The
results from one representative analyzer are summarized in the tables below. Note:
the samples below were selected to evaluate a specific parameter over a specific

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor performed a linearity study to evaluate the claimed analytical
measurement range (AMR) for the sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium,
and ionized magnesium assays on the Stat Profile Prime® Plus Analyzer. The
evaluation of the linear range included lower and upper limits of the AMR and
various medical decision limits.
Low and high concentration pools were prepared from the whole bloods for each
parameter. Nine to eleven different concentrations spanning the analytical range
were made per analyte from these pools using serial dilutions. Each blood level was
analyzed in triplicate in random order on three test analyzers and on the pHOx Ultra
reference analyzer. The pHOx Ultra analyzers were used to establish the target value
of each blood level for each parameter. All three analyzers yielded similar results.
The results of the least squares linear regression analysis from one representative
analyzer are summarized below.

The sodium standards and reagents are traceable to NIST SRM 2201.
The potassium standards and reagents are traceable to NIST SRM 2202.

d. Detection limit:
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate the limit of blank (LoB), limit of

heparinized venous whole blood samples. Varying amounts of sodium citrate were
added to some samples to bind the iCa and iMg and create blank samples and low
level samples. All prepared samples were analyzed on the reference analyzer to
obtain the target values.
Results for ionized calcium and ionized magnesium were as follows:

The performance at the lower end of the measuring range for sodium, potassium, and
chloride is supported by the linearity studies in section M.1.b.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed a specificity study using whole blood collected in lithium
heparin vacutainers. Samples were divided to create two separate pools of blood, one
for control samples and the other for test samples. The potential interferents were
tested at two analyte concentrations. For all analytes, the sponsor defined
interference as > ± 10% bias from the test concentration. If interference was
identified, a dose response study was performed to determine the concentration
where the interfering substance may alter results.
The sponsor determined that the following substances did not cause interference at
the concentrations listed below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were conducted by testing lithium heparinized arterial
and venous whole blood specimens in singlet on the three Stat Profile® Prime Plus
analyzers and two pHOx Ultra analyzers (predicate device). In order to evaluate the
claimed measuring range, some venous whole blood specimens were tonometered,
spiked or diluted to achieve the desired concentrations. The singlet result from each
test analyzer was compared to the average of the results from each comparative
method. Linear regression analysis of one representative analyzer is shown below.

Reference range for ionized magnesium was determined from reference ranges
established in a dozen or so reporting institutions that have been working with Nova
analyzers. The extremes of the reference ranges in these institutions were 0.43 - 0.57 to
0.46 - 0.62, with most being 0.45 - 0.60 mmol/L.
Ionized Magnesium: 0.45 – 0.60 mmol/L
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
