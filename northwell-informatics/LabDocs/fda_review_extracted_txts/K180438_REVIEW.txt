The sponsor provided the following justification for this modification:
Estimates of performance for Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Tests (RIDTs) as assessed
from prospective clinical studies are subject to numerous sources of variability that are
difficult to understand or control. The heterogeneity that is seen across RIDT clinical
studies justifies a statistical analytical approach that accounts for additional variability
over the basic binomial model, which assumes that all clinical studies and sites have the
same performance. Literature supported examples of some of the potential sources of
variability leading to the heterogeneity include:
· Variation in circulating influenza strains from within and across seasons since it is
known that immunoassays have varying affinity to different strains.
· Age of subjects with younger subjects demonstrating higher assay sensitivity.
· Nostril-to-nostril variance in viral load, within the same subject, as it has been
shown that there are significant differences in viral load from one nostril when
compared to the other.
· Swab-to-swab variability, since it is difficult to ensure identical quality when
multiple swabs are collected, especially when patients may be less cooperative on
the second swab.
· Technician-to-technician variability in the way the specimen is collected.
· Variability in time from onset of symptoms to diagnostic testing.
· Positive vaccination status which has been demonstrated to result in reduced viral
loads in patients with acute influenza infection, with further variation caused by
differences in vaccine effectiveness from season to season.
Provided literature in this submission supports the widely acknowledged observation
that RIDT studies are subjected to substantial variability which supports the application
of statistical methods that are designed to account for this variability.

Features
CLIA Waived Kit (K112277) CLIA Waived Kit (K180438)
Intended Use The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B is Unchanged
a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the direct and
qualitative detection of influenza A and B viral
nucleoprotein antigens from nasal and nasopharyngeal
swabs of symptomatic patients.
The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B
(also referred to as the BD Veritor System and BD Veritor
System Flu A+B) is a differentiated test, such that
influenza A viral antigens can be distinguished from
influenza B viral antigens from a single processed sample
using a single device. The test is to be used as an aid in the
diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections. A negative
test is presumptive and it is recommended that these results
be confirmed by viral culture or an FDA-cleared influenza
A and B molecular assay. Outside the U.S., a negative test
is presumptive and it is recommended that these results be
confirmed by viral culture or a molecular assay cleared for
diagnostic use in the country of use. FDA has not cleared
this device for use outside of the U.S. Negative test results
do not preclude influenza viral infection and should not be
used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient
management decisions. The test is not intended to detect
influenza C antigens.
Performance characteristics for influenza A and B were
established during January through March of 2011 when
influenza viruses A/2009 H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria
lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage were the predominant
influenza viruses in circulation according to the Morbidity
and Mortality Weekly Report from the CDC entitled
“Update: Influenza Activity—United States, 2010-2011
Season, and Composition of the 2011-2012 Influenza
Vaccine.” Performance characteristics may vary against
other emerging influenza viruses.
If infection with a novel influenza virus is suspected based
on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria
recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control
precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to
the state or local health department for testing. Virus
culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL
3+ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the
device and its components, and the results of the analysis.
BD’s Risk Assessment process is based on a BD Product Risk Management procedure which
meets the requirement for risk management as set forth in ISO 14971:2007 and EN ISO
14971:2012. Using this procedure, the following are estimated:
§ the hazard,
§ the adverse effect (harm to patient),
§ the potential causes of the hazard,
§ any existing control measure
§ the probability of hazard severity and
§ the probability of occurrence
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities
required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.

Based on a resulting calculated risk index, risk control measures are identified, required
verification and validation activities are determined, and verification of the effectiveness of
risk control measures is determined.
1) The inclusion of the additional performance table in the Clinical Performance section of
the BD Veritor System Flu A+ B (CLIA-Waived kit) product package insert (PI) does
not create any new product risks. There has been no change in the product formulation.
The change is exclusively a labeling change, specifically the addition of a table
presenting combined data from both U.S. and Japanese clinical study sites and the
resulting sensitivity and specificity calculations. The current performance observed by
customers will not change as there is no change to the design or production process for
this product. Therefore, because the addition of a new performance table does not impact
the risk associated with the device, the current risk assessment table will not change.
A change control will be initiated to document this activity in the design history file and
to route the new PI for approval. Modifications to the product package insert will be
implemented in accordance to BD Change Control Procedure BDDSQP0402.
2) The risk assessment identified the need to confirm the Veritor Plus Analyzer’s ability to
produce assay results equivalent to those obtained with the Veritor Reader in either
“Analyze Now” or “Walk Away” workflow mode. The identified studies were
performed according to appropriate design control procedures to assess the addition of
the Veritor Plus Analyzer in either mode as an interpretation instrument for the Veritor
System Flu A + B CLIA-Waived assay product. The results of testing did not identify
new issues of safety and effectiveness.
At the BD Diagnostics Systems research and development (R&D) center in San Diego,
CA, BD staff performed studies testing both analytical and clinical samples to confirm
that the performance of the Veritor Plus Analyzer is equivalent to the Veritor Reader
when used in both “Read Now” and “Walk-Away” modes.
BD R&D staff tested the following analytical samples
· Samples with true zero values (no analyte)
· High negative and low positive samples (near cut-off samples)
The data collected testing the analytical samples demonstrated that the average numerical
values and percentage positivity for Veritor Plus Analyzers when used in both “Read
Now” and “Walk-Away” workflow modes are equivalent to Veritor Readers.
BD R&D staff also tested the following clinical samples:
· 102 Flu A-/B- samples
· 52 Flu A+ samples
· 52 Flu B+ samples

--- Page 8 ---
The data collected with clinical samples also indicate that assay results obtained using
Veritor Plus Analyzers (in both “Read Now” and “Walk-Away” workflow modes) are
equivalent to Veritor Readers.
The risk assessment also identified the need to confirm that the addition of the bar code
scanning functions of InfoScan and InfoSync modules, and any associated screen
displays, alerts and error messages had no effect on safety or effectiveness when the
Veritor Plus Analyzer was used with the Veritor CLIA-waived Flu A + B Assay.
Software verification activities were performed and all testing criteria were met to
confirm that changes and additions made to firmware to add new functionality had no
impact on the ability of the instrument to generate a correct assay result. Cybersecurity
risks and vulnerabilities associated with the use of the InfoSync module were assessed
and BD procedures and controls were verified as acceptable to protect user and patient
data.
6. Conclusion
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the
indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modifications. In addition, the
applicant’s description of the particular modifications and the comparative information between the
modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not
changed. The applicant has provided the design control information as specified in The New
510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent
to the predicate device.
