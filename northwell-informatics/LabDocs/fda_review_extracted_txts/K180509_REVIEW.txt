L. Test Principle:
The Quo-Test A1c System uses a boronic acid–fluorophore conjugate as the active
ingredient for the detection of A1c in a blood sample and the Quo-Test Analyzer uses
two measurements of fluorescence to calculate the percentage A1c in the sample. The
first measurement is used to calculate the total concentration of hemoglobin in the
sample. When the operator places a test cartridge into the analyzer, the dried reagent is
automatically added to the assay buffer and re-suspended. The analyzer then measures

the baseline level of fluorescence in the assay buffer. Following this the analyzer then
automatically adds the blood sample and the fluorescence is measured immediately.
The decrease in measured fluorescence between pre-and post-blood addition is a
function of the concentration of the total hemoglobin in the sample.
The second fluorescence measurement is used to calculate the amount of A1c in the
sample. The analyzer measures the fluorescence over a 180 second period. As the
boronic acid–fluorophore conjugate binds to the A1c in the sample, the fluorescence is
quenched due to the proximity of the hemoglobin protein with the fluorophore. This
gradual quenching of the fluorescence is a function of the concentration of A1c in the
sample. An algorithm then uses the two measurements to calculate the percentage A1c
in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
An internal precision study for the Quo-Test A1c System was performed based on
CLSI EP05-A3 using three K EDTA venous whole blood samples (~5 %, ~8%, and
2
~10% HbA1c) and two controls (normal, ~6.75%, and abnormal, ~11%). Samples
were analyzed using three Quo-Test Analyzers and three lots of Quo-Test A1c Test
Kit reagents. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate in two runs per day for 20 days.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the Quo-Test A1c System was evaluated based on CLSI EP06-A. K -
2
EDTA venous whole blood samples with a high level (15.2%) and a low-level (4.8%)
HbA1c were mixed in different proportions to generate a series of 11 concentrations
that were each measured in replicates of five. Linear regression analysis of measured
values versus expected values was conducted for each of three cartridge lots. The
results of this analysis are shown below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Quo-Test A1c System reports values in % hemoglobin A1c traceable to the IFCC
reference method and traceable to DCCT/NGSP by calculation. The Quo-Test A1c
System is certified with the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program
(NGSP). The certification expires in one year. See the NGSP website for current
certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
d. Detection limit:
The claimed measuring range of 4.0 to 15% for the Quo-Test A1c System is based on
linearity; see section M.1.b.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed to assess common or known endogenous and
exogenous substances that could interfere with the Quo-Test A1c System. The
interfering substances were evaluated in three venous whole blood K EDTA samples
2
with ~5%, ~7.5%, and ~10.3% HbA1c. Test samples were prepared by spiking each
potential interferent listed below at a single dose into each HbA1c sample. Test
samples were assayed in replicates of five and the mean concentration for each test
sample was compared to the mean concentration of five replicates of the control
sample. The sponsor defined significant interference as greater than or equal to 6%
relative deviation between the test and control sample.
The highest concentration of endogenous substances tested that show non-significant
interference are summarized in the table below:

No significant interference, defined as greater than or equal to 6% relative deviation
between the test and control sample, was observed with carbamylated hemoglobin (up
to 12.9%) o labile glycated hemoglobin.
Hemoglobin variant interference
Hemoglobin variant testing was conducted to determine if there is significant
interference with the major hemoglobin variants and the Quo-Test A1c System. The
study was performed using a total of 32 whole blood samples with the variants
evaluated as follows:
Hemoglobin Number of Hemoglobin Variant
%HbA1c Range
Variant Samples Range (%)
HbA2 4 4.4-5.7 5-7.4
HbC 4 32-34 5.0-11.6
HbD 4 40-41 5.0-9.0
HbE 4 20-26 5.9-9.2
HbF 8 3.2-11 6.5-8.1
HbJ 4 50-51 4.6-11.0
HbS 4 36-40 5.2-10.8
HbA1c test results obtained with the Quo-Test A1c System were compared to HbA1c
values assigned to each sample by an FDA-cleared device free of interference with
the respective hemoglobin variant. The sponsor calculated the bias between the
candidate test result and the assigned value for each sample and defined no significant
interference as ≤ ±6% average deviation from the assigned value for all samples
containing the same hemoglobin variant.
Testing results indicate that there is no significant interference for HbS (≤ 40%), HbC
(≤ 34%), HbD (≤ 41%), HbJ (≤ 51%), and HbA2 (≤ 5.7%). Samples containing high
amounts of HbF (> 11%) may result in lower than expected % HbA1c values. HbE
concentrations > 20% interfere with this device.

The labeling contains the following information regarding hemoglobin variant
interference:
For samples containing the hemoglobin variant HbAE at concentrations >20 %, a
positive bias interference of up to 9.2% has been observed, HbA1c values could be
falsely elevated by up to 0.51% HbA1c.
The Quo-Test A1c System was found to be unaffected by labile glycated hemoglobin,
carbamylated hemoglobin and the following hemoglobin variants:
HbAS (≤ 40 % S), HbAC (≤ 34 % C), HbAD (≤ 41 % D), HbAJ (≤ 51 % J), ß-
thalassemia (≤ 5.7 % A2) and elevated fetal hemoglobin (≤ 11 % F). In samples with
HbF above 11% an increasing negative bias is observed: HbA1c values could be
lower than expected. In samples with HbAE concentrations > 20% interference with
this device; HbA1c values could be falsely elevated.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The labeling states the following for those previously diagnosed with diabetes:
A reasonable A1C goal for many nonpregnant adults is 7% (53 mmol/mol). Providers
might reasonably suggest more stringent A1C goals (such as 6.5% [48 mmol/mol]) for
selected individual patients if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or
other adverse effects of treatment (i.e. polypharmacy). Appropriate patients might include
those with short duration of diabetes, type 2 diabetes treated with lifestyle or metformin
only, long life expectancy, or no significant cardiovascular disease. Less stringent A1C
goals (such as 8% [64 mmol/mol]) may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe
hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced microvascular or macrovascular
complications, extensive comorbid conditions, or long-standing diabetes in whom the
goal is difficult to achieve despite diabetes self-management education, appropriate
glucose monitoring, and effective doses of multiple glucose-lowering agents including
insulin(1).

To collect venous whole blood using the blood collector, the blood must first be
transferred onto a clean, non-metallic and non-absorbant surface. The blood collector
should not be placed directly into the blood collection tube. The cartridge containing the
blood collector is then placed into the receptacle in the analyzer and when the door is
closed, the analyzer starts the test.
5. Calibration:
The Quo-Test A1c Analyzer is factory calibrated and is not adjustable by the user.

6. Quality Control:
The Quo-Test A1c System should be used with the Quo-Test A1c Control Kit that is
available for purchase separately. The Quo-Test A1c Control Kit is a two-level,
lyophilized control consisting of human blood, preservatives and stabilizers, one level in
the region of a normal patient response (4 - 7% A1c) and one level in the region of an
abnormally high patient sample (~10% A1c). A dropper bottle containing distilled water
to reconstitute the controls is also provided. Users are directed to perform control testing
with each new lot of test cartridges, with each new shipment of test cartridges, and if
there is a concern that the result may be incorrect.
