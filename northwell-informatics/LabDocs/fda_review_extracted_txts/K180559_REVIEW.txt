L. Test Principle:
The HSV 1&2 ELITe MGB Assay system is comprised of three major processes:
(1) automated preparation of unprocessed sample to extract nucleic acids from primary swab
specimens using the ELITe InGenius SP 200 Extraction Cartridge,
(2) PCR amplification of target DNA sequences using HSV-1 and HSV-2 specific primers,
(3) real-time detection of fluorescent-labeled HSV-1 and HSV-2 specific oligonucleotide
detection probes.
An Internal Control (IC), containing unrelated randomized DNA sequence, is added to all
samples prior to extraction and monitors the integrity of the reagents, equipment function,
and the presence of inhibitors in the samples. A positive signal in the Internal Control
channel in the absence of HSV DNA indicates that the PCR has not been inhibited.
The amplification reagents, Positive Control and Internal Control are packaged as part of the
HSV 1&2 ELITe MGB Assay.

and the data support a shelf-life claim of 10 months for the HSV 1&2 ELITe MGB
Assay. A reagent freeze thaw stability study was conducted with 3 reagent lots and
demonstrated that the HSV 1&2 ELITe MGB Assay is stable when subjected to 8
freeze-thaw cycles.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) of the HSV 1&2 ELITe MGB Assay was determined
using 4 HSV strains (two for each target). Quantitated viral strains were obtained and
serially diluted into HSV negative pooled human oral cheek matrix in UTM. All
dilutions were tested, and the LoD was determined using Probit (Logit) Data Analysis
software (Analyse-it for Microsoft Excel v4.80.2, Logistic Function model). LoD for
each strain represents the lowest viral titer in TCID /mL at which a positive result
50
can be detected at > 95% confidence. The LoD for each strain was then verified by
testing 20 replicates. The results are presented in the following table.

A swab elution efficiency study was also performed by using the same HSV negative
pooled human cheek swab matrix and the HSV-1 MacIntyre strain used to verify the
LoB. This study showed 100% elution efficiency from the Copan regular flocked
swab compared with the same volume of material directly spiked into UTM.
e. Analytical Reactivity:
The analytical reactivity (Inclusivity) of the HSV 1&2 ELITe MGB Assay was tested
on 44 well characterized commercially available HSV-1 and HSV-2 isolates. All
strains were tested with the HSV 1&2 ELITE MGB Assay as spiked samples in UTM
prepared at close to LoD (3xLOD) level. For HSV-1 and HSV-2 viral isolates not
detected (negative) at 3×LoD concentrations, 2× incremental concentrations were
tested, the lowest detectable level was determined, and the final test concentration
was reported. All tested HSV-1 and HSV-2 isolates were detected by the HSV 1&2
ELITe MGB Assay at concentrations of 16.2 – 354 TCID50/mL.

Microbial Interference
The microbial interference was evaluated in the presence of either HSV-1 or HSV-2
spiked at 3×LoD in UTM and the 49 organisms indicated in the cross reactivity
section above. Each microorganism was tested either at 1×106 CFU/mL or higher for
bacterial isolates, or at 1×105 TCID50/mL or higher for viruses. None of the non-
target organisms that are reasonably expected to be found in cutaneous and
mucocutaneous swab samples interfered with the detection of HSV-1 or HSV-2
species. The only exception is that amplification of HSV-1 is completely inhibited in
the presence of HSV-2 titers of 1×103 or higher. This observed HSV-2 interference is
reported as a limitation in the device package insert.
Competitive Interference
Competitive interference was studied to evaluate the effects of possible clinically
relevant co-infection with both HSV-1 and HSV-2 using HSV 1&2 ELITe MGB
Assay.
The study assessed whether a high concentration of one virus in the sample could
potentially affect the HSV 1&2 ELITe MGB Assay performance for another target
present at low levels. A low positive sample was contrived at approximately 3×LoD
for each target (HSV-1 McIntryre strain and HSV-2 MS strain), and a baseline Ct was
determined for each sample. Each potential concomitant infecting virus was spiked
into the low level sample and assayed in triplicate.
Competitive interference of HSV-1 with HSV-2 was observed at HSV-2 titers of
1×103, 1×104, 1×105 TCID /mL. This observed interference information is included
50
as a limitation in the device package insert.
No competitive interference of HSV-2 with HSV-1 at the levels tested was observed.
The results of the testing are shown in the table below.

composite reference method (FDA-cleared real-time PCR assay combined with PCR
amplification and bi-directional sequencing). Both targets in clinical samples were
detected up to cycle 45. Therefore C of 45 was established as a diagnostic assay cut-
T
off for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 targets.
h. Sample stability studies:
This study assessed both sample stability and sample freeze-thaw stability. The
samples for the stability evaluation were prepared by spiking both the HSV-1 and
HSV-2 vendor quantitated viral stocks (HSV-1 MacIntyre strain and HSV-2 MS
strain) in UTM, M4, M4RT, M5 and M6 media.
Each stability sample set consisted of:
• 5 replicates spiked at 3×LoD,
• 5 replicates spiked at 1×103 TCID50/mL, and
• 5 replicates spiked at 1×105 TCID50/mL (15 replicates total for each sample
set).
The stability of each sample set was assessed by sample incubation at +4°C for 1
week. All HSV-1 and HSV-2 samples were confirmed to be stable in UTM, M4,
M4RT, M5 and M6 media for 1 week at +4°C.
The storage conditions were also validated by re-testing previously analyzed clinical
samples that were stored in a -80°C freezer (≤ -70°C) for minimum of 4 months.
Sample concentrations covered HSV clinical range. Ten HSV-1 or HSV-2 positive
samples were tested for each media (except M6 for which only 7 HSV-positive
samples were available). Positivity of all samples was confirmed after 4 month
storage in a -80°C freezer (≤ -70°C).
A freeze thaw study was performed using 5 sample sets prepared as in the above
using UTM, M4, M4RT, M5 and M6 media. All samples were subjected to 3 freeze-
thaw cycles. All the samples were tested with the HSV 1&2 ELITe MGB Assay on
the ELITe InGenius. The data obtained show that HSV-1 and HSV-2 viruses are
stable after 3 freeze-thaw cycles in UTM, M4, M4RT, M5 and M6 media.
i. Carryover contamination:
The sample-to-sample carry-over from positive samples into the negative samples for
the HSV 1&2 ELITe MGB Assay was studied by performing 5 integrated
checkerboard runs; HSV-1 high positive at 2.5×107 TCID /mL concentration and
50
negative samples (UTM) interspersed, which were compared to the overall
background noise from 2 negative sample runs. All 5 checkerboard runs and 2
complete negative runs were performed by 1 operator. The high positive sample
concentration in this study exceeded 95% of the concentration levels obtained from
samples of infected patients in the study. No carry-over and cross contamination was

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not Applicable
b. Matrix comparison:
Because all analytical studies were conducted in the UTM and clinical studies were
conducted using UTM, M4, M4RT, M5 and M6 media, a the matrix comparison
study was performed. The matrix comparison study was conducted using contrived
sample panel made by spiking HSV-1 or HSV-2 quantitated viral organisms into each
of the recommended media: UTM, M4, M4RT, M5 and M6. Each sample set
consisted of 3 replicates spiked at 3×LoD, 3 replicates spiked at 1×103 TCID50/mL,
and 3 replicates spiked at 1×105 TCID50/mL (9 replicates total for each sample set).
Each sample was processed on the InGenius using the HSV 1&2 ELITe MGB Assay.
All replicates in all media were detected and shown comparable results. All tested
media showed comparable performance as shown in the table below.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
To evaluate the clinical performance of the HSV 1&2 ELITe MGB Assay, device
performance was compared to a composite reference method. It consisted of an FDA
cleared assay and a validated HSV 1&2 PCR followed by bi-directional sequencing
of gel electrophoresis-positive samples). Validated HSV 1&2 PCR targeted genomic
regions distinct from the HSV 1&2 ELITe MGB Assay. A positive result by the
composite reference method is defined as a positive by the FDA cleared PCR or the
validated sequencing. Two negative results are needed to confirm a negative)
A total of 1,174 left-over prospectively collected archived swab samples from
cutaneous (546) and mucocutaneous (628) lesions from symptomatic patients were
collected and evaluated in the study.
The samples were tested with HSV 1&2 ELITe MGB Assay and the Composite
Reference Method. Out of the 1,174 tested samples, 2 samples were found invalid by
the ELITe MGB Assay and were excluded from the performance analysis tables.
Out of the 1172 remaining samples 1 additional invalid sample result for HSV1 and 2
additional invalid sample results for HSV2 by the composite reference method were
removed from the performance analysis tables. Therefore for HSV1, 1171 samples
analyzed and for HSV2 1170 samples were analyzed.

Contrived Sample Study:
Due to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient HSV-2 positive oral samples, testing for
HSV-2 was supplemented by using a contrived panel. The panel consisted of 75
individual negative cheek swab samples collected in Universal Transport Media
(UTM) and spiked with HSV-2 at concentrations of 3×LoD, 8×LoD, 40×LoD,
200×LoD and 1000×LoD (10 of each), 10 HSV-1 Positive samples spiked at 10×LoD
and 15 HSV-1/HSV-2 Negative Oral Samples
All panel members were randomized, blinded to the tester and tested with HSV 1&2
ELITe MGB Assay on the ELITe InGenius instrument according to the clinical study
protocol.
The HSV-2 Oral Contrived Panel Study revealed that 49 out of 50 oral HSV-2
contrived samples were positive using HSV 1&2 ELITe MGB Assay (98%
detection). All 10 HSV-1 Positive samples confirmed 100% positivity.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not Applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The observed expected values for HSV-1 and HSV-2 in the study population using the
HSV 1&2 ELITe MGB Assay were calculated and are presented for the combined
sample set stratified by age group, gender and by lesion source in the tables below. A
total of 6 dual positives for HSV1 and HSV2 were detected by the ELITe MGB Assay
