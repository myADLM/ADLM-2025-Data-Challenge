L. Test Principle:
The BioPlex 2200 25-OH Vitamin D assay is a multiplex flow competitive immunoassay for
the quantitative determination of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in human serum.
A population of dyed paramagnetic beads is coated with anti-25-OH Vitamin D antibody.
The BioPlex 2200 System combines an aliquot of patient sample with the Vitamin D release
buffer to dissociate the 25-OH Vitamin D from its binding protein. After the first incubation,
the bead reagent is added to the reaction vessel and incubated at 37°C. After the second
incubation, the BioPlex 2200 system adds the 25-OH Vitamin D-Biotin conjugate 1. The
excess conjugate 1 is removed during a wash cycle and the streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SA-
PE) conjugate 2 is added. The excess conjugate 2 is removed during a wash cycle, and the
beads are re-suspended in wash buffer. The bead mixture then passes through the detector.
The detected fluorescence of the SA-PE in relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) is inversely
proportional to the concentration of 25-OH Vitamin D in the sample. Two additional dyed
beads, an internal standard bead (ISB) and a serum verification bead (SVB), are present in
each reaction mixture to verify detector response and the addition of serum to the reaction
vessel.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the BioPlex 2200 25-OH Vitamin D assay was evaluated according
to CLSI EP05-A3 guideline. Serum samples with low, medium, and high levels (6
total) of 25-OH Vitamin D and two levels of serum controls were assayed in duplicate
per run with 2 runs per day for 20 days (N=80) on one reagent lot.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was conducted according to CLSI EP06-A guideline. A high 25-OH
Vitamin D level sample was diluted with a low level sample of 25-OH Vitamin D to
create 11 level samples with approximate concentrations of 5, 15, 32, 50, 70, 92, 108,
127, 142, 158, 175 ng/mL. Samples were evaluated in replicates of four on a single
analyzer using BioPlex 2200 25-OH Vitamin D kit. The mean value of the observed
results were plotted against the expected values. The results of the regression analysis
are shown below:
Slope Intercept r2 Sample range tested
1.0002 -0.0143 0.9956 5.4-166.5 ng/mL
The results of the linearity study support the sponsor claimed that the candidate assay
is linear from 7 to 160 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The BioPlex 2200 25-OH Vitamin D Assay was originally cleared under 510(k)
k141114. Bio-Rad has modified the assay by standardizing the cleared vitamin D
assay in accordance with the Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP). The VDSP
is an international collaborative effort to standardize the laboratory measurement of
serum 25-OH vitamin D. Please refer to
http://ods.od.nih.gov/Research/VitaminD.aspx for more information on the VDSP
program.
The BioPlex 2200 25-OH Vitamin D assay is standardized (calibrated) using internal
standards which are traceable to CDC and Ghent University’s ID-LC/ MS/MS
25(OH) vitamin D Reference Method Procedure (RMP) that is traceable to the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material
(SRM) 2972.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and the limit of quantitation (LoQ)
were determined following CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
LoB: LoB was performed by testing 5 blank samples using 2 BioPlex 25-OH Vitamin
reagent lots on 1 instrument in 4 replicates per day for 5 days yielding 100 data points
per reagent lot. LoB was calculated using a non-parametric statistical analysis at 95th
percentile.

Slope	Intercept	r2	Sample range tested
1.0002	-0.0143	0.9956	5.4-166.5 ng/mL

--- Page 7 ---
LoD: Six low level natural human serum samples were tested with two BioPlex 25-
OH Vitamin D reagent lots on one instrument in 10 replicates per day for five days
yielding 50 data points per sample per reagent lot. The LoD was determined to be
using the following equation: LoD=LoB + C X SD .
p LoD
LoQ: The LoQ was determined using the same six low level samples used for the
LoD. The mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation for each sample were
calculated. LoQ was defined as the lowest value with a precision ≤ 20% CV.
The results of the LoB, LoD, and LoQ are summarized below:
LoB ng/mL LoD ng/mL LoQ ng/mL
5.4 7.0 7.0
The sponsor claimed that the candidate assay has a measuring range from 7.0 to 160
ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were conducted to measure the effects of endogenous serum
components and exogenous molecules on the 25-OH Vitamin D assay, following
CLSI EP07-A2 guideline.
Two sample pools were prepared to achieve a low (10-20 ng/mL) and medium (30-50
ng/mL) concentration of 25-OH Vitamin D. The samples were spiked with the
interfering substances.
Biotin interference was tested in 3 samples with low (20-25 ng/mL), medium (50-60
ng/mL) and high (110-130 ng/mL) Vitamin D concentrations. Samples were spiked
with 3 biotin concentrations of 1200, 2000, 3600 ng/mL. No significant interference
was observed up to 3600 ng/mL biotin level.
Substances are considered interfering if their presence in a sample results in more
than ± 10% deviation in quantitation relative to the value determined in the absence
of the substance. The substances and the highest levels tested are shown in the table
below:

EDTA 800 mg/dL
The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling:
“Hemoglobin > 150 mg/dL may interfere and cause increased Vitamin D results. Do
not use visibly hemolyzed samples.”
Cross-Reactivity:
The study was conducted using 2 serum pools at 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations
of 31.5 ng/mL and 43.2 ng/mL. Nine cross reactants at levels listed below were
spiked into the serum pools. The spiked and non-spiked samples were then evaluated
in replicates of five using 2 reagent sets to calculate the cross reactivity using the
following formula:
% cross reactivity = [(mean recovery of test samples in ng/mL) – (mean recovery of
control sample in ng/mL) / (concentration of cross reactant in ng/mL)] * 100
The results of the cross-reactivity study are shown below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed to compare the candidate device BioPlex
2200 25-OH Vitamin D to the predicate device. A total of 184 human serum samples
with 25-OH Vitamin D values ranging from 9.1 ng/mL to 122.8 ng/mL were analyzed
in singlicate using one reagent lot of the candidate and predicate device. Less of 10%
of the samples were contrived. Deming regression was used for the regression
analysis and the results are summarized below:
Slope Intercept Correlation Sample Range
N
(95% CI) (95% CI) Coefficient (r) Tested (ng/mL)
1.048 -0.885
184 0.987 9.1 - 122.8
(1.009 - 1.088) (-2.211 - 0.441)
Method comparison to reference method:
An additional method comparison study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy
between the candidate device and the Reference Method Procedure (RMP), University
of Ghent’s ID-LC/MS/MS method.
A total of 119 native single donor patient serum samples (reference sample set
provided by the Vitamin D Standardization and Certification Program with assigned
values by the RMP at CDC, independent from the samples used for standardization)
were tested with one replicate on the BioPlex 2200 25-OH Vitamin D kit. Results of
the Deming regression analysis are summarized in the table below:
Slope Intercept Correlation Sample Range
N
(95% CI) (95% CI) Coefficient (r) Tested (ng/mL)

119 0.949 7.4 - 153.2
(0.913 - 1.073) (-2.705 - 1.155)
The method comparison against the RMP supports accuracy at the upper end of the
claimed measuring range of the device (up to 160 ng/mL).
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable, only serum samples are recommended for use with this assay.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The study was conducted following CLSI EP28-A3c guideline. Two hundred and eighty-
eight (288) samples from apparently healthy donors including 161 males ranging in age
from 21 to 79 and 127 females ranging in age from 21 to 66 were collected from three
regions (Northern, Central, and Southern) in the US . The 288 samples from apparently
healthy donors met the following inclusion/exclusion criteria as follows:
· Age from 21 to 90
· Roughly 50% female and 50% male
· 20% from Northern, 20% from Central and 60% from Southern region
· 40% collected in spring, 30% in summer and 30% in winter
· Study included at least 30% African Americans and 30% Caucasians
· 90% not taking Vitamin D supplements and <30% of those taking Vitamin D
supplements at or more than 1000 IU, but less than 2000 IU
· Normal TSH, PTH, and total calcium
· No family history of parathyroid or calcium regulatory disease.
· In addition, no personal history of kidney disease, GI disease, liver disease, and
no bariatric surgery.
Samples were tested with the BioPlex 25-OH Vitamin D kit in singlicate. The observed
median, mean, and range between 2.5th to 97.5th percentile are summarized below:
N Mean Median 2.5th – 97.5th percentile
288 31.9 ng/mL 29.2 ng/mL 14.0 – 76.3 ng/mL
