pH. Separation also occurs according to the electrolyte pH and electroosmotic flow. The
hemoglobins, separated in silica capillaries, are directly detected at an absorbance
wavelength of 415 nm. The hemoglobin (Hb) fractions are separated by absorbance
spectrophotometry. The hemoglobins are reported in % units along with an electrophoresis
scan. The resulting electrophoregrams are evaluated visually for pattern abnormalities. Direct
detection provides accurate relative quantification of individual hemoglobin fractions: A, F,
A2, S, C, D, and E. By using alkaline pH buffer, normal and abnormal (or variant)
hemoglobins are detected.

Note: All results below met the manufacturer’s pre-specified acceptance criteria.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the CAPI 3 Hemoglobin assay was evaluated according to CLSI
guideline EP05-A3.
Repeatability
Five control materials with different levels of hemoglobin variants were run using the
CAPI 3 HEMOGLOBIN(E) procedure performed with one CAPILLARYS 3 TERA
instrument and one lot of the CAPI 3 HEMOGLOBIN(E) kit. Each sample was
analyzed in duplicate on 12 capillaries per run, two runs per day over 20 days
yielding a total of 960 results per sample. The results are expressed as coefficient of
variation (%CV).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed per CLSI EP06-A: Evaluation of Quantitative
Measuring Procedures; A Statistical Approach. Mixtures of two different blood
samples were mixed at different proportions and tested in triplicate and analyzed
using the CAPI 3 HEMOGLOBIN(E) procedure on the CAPILLARYS 3 instrument.
The tests were determined to be linear within the reportable ranges studied for each of
the following hemoglobins fractions: Hb A (1.0−97.3%), HbS (1.1−89.7%), HbA2
(0.2−9.1%), HbF (0.5−83.1%), HbC (0.3−82%), Hb D (1.1−43.5%), Hb E
(0.3−86.9%).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Reagent Stability: The CAPI 3 HEMOGLOBIN(E) reagents used with the
CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument are the same reagents that were presented in the
predicate device, CAPILLARYS HEMOGLOBIN(E) kit using the CAPILLARYS 2
FLEX PIERCING instrument (K112550). The reagent bottles are the same with the
exception the CAPI 3 HEMOGLOBIN(E) kit and the CAPI 3 WASH SOLUTION
contain an RFID tag on the bottle(s).
Sample Stability:
Storage at refrigerated temperatures: Eleven whole blood samples with different
hemoglobin fractions (Hb A, Hb A2, Hb F, Hb S, Hb C and Hb E) were analyzed
upon receipt and after one week of storage at 2–8°C with the CAPI 3
HEMOGLOBIN(E) on the CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument. The results obtained
met the acceptance criteria. Sample stability for the CAPI 3 HEMOGLOBIN(E) kit
on the CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument was determined to be 7 days at 2–8°C.
Storage at frozen temperatures: Thirteen whole blood samples with different
hemoglobin fractions (Hb A, Hb A2, Hb F, Hb S, Hb Cand Hb D) were analyzed
upon receipt and after 3 months of storage at−70 or −80°C, with the CAPI 3
HEMOGLOBIN(E) assay performed with the CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument.
The results obtained met the acceptance criteria. Sample stability for the CAPI 3
HEMOGLOBIN(E) kit on the CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument was determined to
be 3 months at −70 or −80°C.

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation was
performed per CLSI EP17-A2 guideline, Evaluation of Detection Capability for
Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline – Second
Edition.
LoB: Two lots of the CAPI 3 HEMOGLOBIN(E) kit were used to detect the
percentages of the fraction in the designated hemoglobin position. Five blood samples
(B1–B5) were analyzed. For each lot of CAPI 3 HEMOGLOBIN(E) kit, each of the
five samples was analyzed on 3 days with four replicates per day using one
CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument in order to obtain 60 data points per lot.
LoD: Two lots of the CAPI 3 HEMOGLOBIN(E) kit were used to detect the
percentages of the fraction in the designated hemoglobin position. Five blood samples
were analyzed. For each lot of CAPI 3 HEMOGLOBIN(E) kit, each of the five
samples was analyzed on 3 days with four replicates per day using one
CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument in order to obtain 60 data points per lot. The LoD
was determined using the sample from which the hemoglobin fraction is always
detected.
LoQ: The LoQ was determined using precision profile approach. The LoQ is
determined on four fractions representing the four intervals of migration of the Hb
fractions of interest: the C/A2/E mobility interval using Hb A2 as the target analyte
representing HbA2, Hb C and Hb E fractions; the D/S mobility interval using Hb S as
the target analyte representing Hb S and Hb D fractions; Hb F and Hb A. Four
different blood samples were tested with two lots of the CAPI 3 HEMOGLOBIN(E)
kit performed on three CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instruments. Testing was performed
for 5 days, two runs per day. Within each run, each sample was analyzed three times
in order to obtain 90 data points per sample and 360 data points per lot.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were conducted following CLSI EP07-A2, Interference Testing
in Clinical Chemistry, using six samples (normal Hb A2 level, increased Hb A2 level
Hb S, HbC, HbD, HbE). Each sample was analyzed three times.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device: The method comparison was conducted at
two sites which was found to be acceptable given that the CAPILLARYS 3 TERA
instrument has been evaluated in a previous clearance (K161928). At site 1, a total of
153 samples including three controls were analyzed. At site 2, a total of 151 samples
including one control were analyzed. Regression analysis was not performed for the
Hb D fraction in site 2 due to insufficient data.
