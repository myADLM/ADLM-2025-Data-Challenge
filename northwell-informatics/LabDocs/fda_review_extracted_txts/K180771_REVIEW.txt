L. Test Principle:
The ACRO HCG Pregnancy Rapid Test is a lateral flow sandwich immunochromatographic
assay. The device utilizes a combination of antibodies to hCG: one labeled with a
chromophore dye that is impregnated into the sample pad and the second, which is printed as a
line onto the test zone of the test strip. The device also has a second antibody printed onto the
test zone of the test strip that serves as a procedural control to indicate that a sufficient volume
of urine migrated up the test strip during sample testing. During the procedure, the absorbent
end of the device is immersed into a urine sample. The specimen migrates via capillary action
along the membrane to react with the antibody-dye conjugate, and hCG within the sample
forms a complex with the antibody-dye conjugate. The hCG-antibody-dye conjugate complex
continues to migrate along the membrane to the test region, where it is captured on the test
line by a second anti-hCG antibody, and excess anti-hCG antibody-dye conjugate (without
bound hCG) migrates to the control line where it is captured by antibodies to the anti-hCG
antibody. A visible control line indicates that the sample successfully migrated into the test
zone. A specimen with hCG below the cutoff should produce no test line in the test zone
(demarcated a “T” on the device), and one control line in the test zone (demarcated as “C” on

the device). A specimen with hCG above the cutoff should produce both a test line and a
control line in the test zone. An invalid result produces either no lines on the device (i.e. no
test or control lines) or one test line in the test zone (i.e. a test line but no control line).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed using hCG negative human urine samples spiked
with hCG (traceable to the WHO 4th international standard) to create samples with
hCG concentrations of 0 mIU/mL, 12.5 mIU/mL, 20 mIU/mL, 25 mIU/mL, 40
mIU/mL and 100 mIU/mL. These samples were tested by laboratory professionals to
evaluate within run, between run and between operator precision. Six operators,
using three lots of ACRO HCG Pregnancy Rapid Test for five consecutive days
performed the testing. Testing was performed in-house by dip mode method, and the
results are summarized in the table below. Precision performance in mid-stream
mode was previously reviewed in k172512.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity is not applicable since this is a qualitative test.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The test is calibrated against reference material traceable to WHO 4th International
Standard for hCG.
The stability testing protocol and acceptance criteria used to support the shelf life
were reviewed and found to be acceptable in the predicate k172512.

d. Detection limit:
See section M.1.a., above.
e. Analytical specificity:
To evaluate the potential for interference by certain endogenous or exogenous
compounds, each potentially interfering substance was prepared by spiking the
substance to the desired concentration into an hCG negative specimen and a positive
specimen containing 25 mIU/mL hCG. Each sample was tested in three replicates
using 3 lots of the candidate device. No interference was observed from the
endogenous or exogenous compounds tested at the concentrations noted in the table
below, for either negative or positive hCG urine samples, when tested using the
candidate device in the dip mode. Analytical specificity was demonstrated for the
mid-stream mode in k172512.

To determine if the ACRO HCG Pregnancy Rapid Test has a hook effect due to high
levels of hCG, hCG negative urine samples were spiked with varying hCG
concentrations 10 IU/mL, 100 IU/mL, 500 IU/mL, 1000IU/mL). These samples were
evaluated in dip mode with 3 lots of ACRO HCG Pregnancy Rapid Test device in

triplicates per sample. No hCG hook effect was observed at hCG levels up to 1,000
IU/mL. Absence of hook was demonstrated for the mid-stream mode in k172512.
Effects of hCG β-core fragment:
To evaluate the effect of hCG β-core fragment, an hCG negative urine sample and a
urine sample with 25 mIU/ml hCG were spiked with hCG β-core fragment to yield
samples with concentrations of 100 pmol/L, 150 pmol/L, 200 pmol/L, 250 pmol/L,
300 pmol/L, 500 pmol/L, 5,000 pmol/L, 50,000 pmol/L and 500,000 pmol/L. These
samples were tested in dip mode using six lots of the candidate device in triplicates
per lot in dip mode format. Positive results were observed with hCG β-core fragment
concentrations greater than 200 pmol/L. No hook effect was observed at
concentrations of hCG β-core fragment up to 500000 pmol/L.
Cross-Reactivity:
To evaluate cross-reactivity for the candidate device in dip mode, hCG negative and
hCG positive urine samples (25 mIU/mL hCG) were spiked with various
concentrations of glycoprotein hormones LH, hFSH, TSH. These samples were
evaluated with 3 lots of ACRO HCG Pregnancy Rapid Test device in three replicates
per sample. The results demonstrate that there is no interference at 500 mIU/mL LH,
1000 mIU/mL hFSH, 1000 mIU/mL TSH in either negative or positive urine
samples. Cross-reactivity performance was demonstrated for the mid-stream mode in
k172512.
pH interference study:
To evaluate potential interference for the candidate device in dip mode from changes
in urine pH, urine samples containing 0 mIU/mL, and 25 mIU/mL hCG were tested at
pH values of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 in duplicates. The results indicated that changes in pH
range of 4~9 do not interfere with either positive or negative results from the device.
Performance across various pH values was demonstrated for the mid-stream mode in
k172512.
Specific Gravity interference study:
To evaluate potential interference from changes in specific gravity for the candidate
device in dip mode, urine samples containing 0 mIU/mL and 25 mIU/mL of hCG
were tested in duplicates using one lot of ACRO HCG Pregnancy Rapid Test, at
specific gravity values ranging from 1.010, 1.022, 1.030, 1.027, 1.028, 1.008,
1.026,1.021,1.008, 1.013,1.016, 1.018, 1.014 and 1.015. The results indicated that
changes in specific gravity do not interfere with either positive or negative results
from the device. Performance across various specific gravity values was
demonstrated for the mid-stream mode in k172512.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A lay user study was performed with 175 lay users including 113 pregnant and 62
non-pregnant female subjects. Each subject tested her own urine sample using dip
mode testing method on the candidate device following instructions on the package
insert. The same sample was tested by a professional using the same lay user samples,
who performed testing on the candidate device and on the predicate device in dip
mode testing method. Lay user performance was demonstrated for the mid-stream
mode in k172512.
