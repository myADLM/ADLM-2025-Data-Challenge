L. Test Principle:
The microINR System is a handheld in vitro diagnostic medical device that uses microfluidic
technology with machine vision detection to measure the PT from a fresh capillary whole
blood sample. The fresh capillary whole blood sample is applied to the microINR Chip for
testing. The microINR Chip is inserted into the meter. Two microcapillary channels in the
microINR Chip are filled with the blood sample by capillary action. The microINR Chip
contains a preparation of human recombinant tissue factor, synthetic phospholipids and
stabilizers. The microINR Meter measures the INR based on an algorithm carried out in the
microINR Chip and displays the INR on the screen.

Repeatability: The repeatability study was performed at three clinical sites, testing
capillary samples from 68 normal subjects and 201 patients on warfarin therapy. A
total of four microINR Chip lots and six microINR Meters were included in the study.
Two capillary samples (two fingersticks) were collected from each subject by the
same operator using the same microINR Meter and the same microINR Chip lot,
resulting into a total of 269 paired tests. Data analysis was carried out by site, all sites
combined and by clinically relevant ranges. All test results met the pre-defined
acceptance criteria. The Table below summarizes the repeatability study results.

For meter-to-meter variability, three microINR Meters, one operator and one microINR
Chip lot were included. The operator sequentially performed two replicates from each
sample per microINR Meter using one chip lot. Six measurements per blood sample were
carried out (two per microINR Meter).
For chip lot-to-lot variability, three chip lots, one operator and one microINR meter were
included. The operator sequentially performed two replicates from each sample per chip
lot using one microINR meter. Six measurements were carried out (two for each
microINR Chip lot).
For operator-to-operator variability, three operators, one microINR Chip lot and one
microINR Meter were included. Each operator sequentially performed two replicates
from each sample using the same microINR Meter and microINR Chip lot. Six
measurements per blood sample were carried out (two per operator).
Run-to-run variability was also calculated. Considering that two replicates from the
same sample were taken for each variability study (operator, microINR Chip lot,
microINR Meter) and assuming that each replicate is considered one run, the above
three designs permitted evaluation of run-to-run variability.

Device Reproducibility Study: The objective of this study was to estimate the device
reproducibility imprecision of the microINR System following CLSI EP05-A3. This
study was performed using two different plasma samples: low abnormal INR level
(HemosIL Low Abnormal Control Assayed, IL, K021022) and high abnormal INR
level (HemosIL High Abnormal Control Assayed, IL, K021024). INR was determined
in both plasma samples by each device over the course of five days, with two runs per
day and three replicates per run (3 devices x 5 days x 2 runs x 3 replicates). Each
device included one different microINR Meter, once microINR Chip lot and a
different operator. All results met the pre-defined acceptance criteria. A summarized

Sample Reproducibility: The objective of this study was to estimate the sample
reproducibility imprecision of the microINR System. This study was performed at
three external sites where each site was performed by three operators with three
different Chip lots and three microINR Meters. Fresh venous whole blood samples
were collected from 10 normal subjects and 18 patients on warfarin therapy. The
hematocrit level of samples was measured by the Mission Plus Hb Hemoglobin
Testing System (Acon Laboratories, K122553) and the INR value was determined by
the predicate device in order to classify the samples in the required INR ranges. Each
operator sequentially performed two INR measurements from the same venous whole
blood sample. The three operators at each site performed testing with three different
microINR Meter/microINR Chip lot combinations. Because the study was conducted
at three sites, sample intermediate precision analysis was analyzed site by site. All test
results met the pre-defined acceptance criteria. A summarized table of the sample

International Reference Preparation. Separate microINR Chip lots manufactured by
iLine Microsystems have been calibrated using the rTF/09 (WHO 4th International
Standard Thromboplastin, Human, Recombinant, Plain) and the rTF/16 (WHO 5th
International Standard Thromboplastin, Human, Recombinant, Plain).
ii. Test Strip Stability: microINR Chip stability studies were conducted in accordance
to CLSI EP25-A.
a. Real Time Stability: The stability of 15 months shelf-life was established by
storing three microINR Chip lots at 25ºC (77ºF) (60% Relative Humidity (RH))
and testing after a storage time of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months using fresh
venous whole blood samples.
b. In-Use Stability: In-use stability was tested to demonstrate that the microINR
Chips can be kept outside the pouch before measurement for up to 6 hours when
directly exposed to 35°C (95ºF), 80% RH. It was assessed by exposing the chips
out of their pouches to 35ºC (95ºF), 80% RH storage for 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 hours
and testing using fresh venous whole blood samples.
a. Transport Stability: microINR Chips and its package were validated by a
transport stability study. microINR Chips were tested after a stress study of one
shipping unit containing 80 boxes of 25 units of microINR Chips each. Package
evaluation was assessed and the performance of the microINR Chips was tested
using fresh venous whole blood samples.
d. Detection limit:
Factor sensitivities were calculated according to CLSI guideline H47-A2. The
sensitivity to factors II, V, VII and X of the microINR System was performed by
mixing varying amounts of factor II, V, VII and X deficient plasma, pooled normal
plasma and red blood cells to final factor concentrations between 100% and 0%
(100%, 75%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 25%, 10% and 0%). These samples were then tested
using four microINR Chip lots and 20 microINR Meters. Twenty-seven
measurements were performed per coagulation factor and dilution level. The
sensitivity of the microINR System to factors II, V, VII and X was estimated to be
28%, 41%, 37% and 45%, respectively.
e. Analytical specificity:
For the interference studies, fresh venous whole blood samples from four subjects in
the following ranges were tested: INR<2 (normal subject), 2≤INR<3.5, 3.5≤INR<4.5
and INR ≥ 4.5. After sample collection (as per CLSI H21-A5), hematocrit levels of
the patients were measured, and the INR value was determined by the predicate
device in order to classify the sample in the appropriate INR range. Samples were
separated into aliquots to test four concentrations of each interferent. Each of the
samples were spiked with the interferent to the final target concentrations and one
10

sample aliquot was spiked with each solvent as a control. Two meters were utilized
for the control microINR Chips and five microINR meters were utilized for each
interferent concentrations were tested. The interference study results demonstrate that
the following interferents do not interfere with test results up to the following
concentrations:

Hematocrit: Two separate studies were conducted to demonstrate that hematocrit
between 25% and 55% values did not interfere with the microINR System for INR
determinations.
· Study 1: The hematocrit effect on the microINR System was evaluated by
performing a retrospective analysis of hematocrit and INR results
collected from database at iLine Microsystems. A total of 2199 clinical
samples were assessed, where 1910 were from patients on warfarin
therapy and 289 normal subjects and the following hematocrit ranges were
assessed: <25%, 25–30%, 30–35%, 35–40%, 40–45%, 45–50%, 50–55%,
and >55%. Venous whole blood samples were collected and tested with
the 26 microINR meters and 24 microINR Chip lots. In addition, six
contrived samples were used to create samples with hematocrit <25% and
between 25–30% from venous whole blood samples (four patients on

warfarin therapy and two normal subjects). To achieve the desired
hematocrit values, supernatant plasma obtained by centrifugation was
added to the samples. Results demonstrated that the microINR System is
unaffected by hematocrits within the claimed hematocrit range of 25–55%.
· Study 2: The hematocrit effect on the microINR System was also
evaluated by analyzing the data obtained from the method comparison
study which was performed at three clinical sites. The study was
conducted with one lot of microINR Chips on the microINR Meter using
venous whole blood samples from a total of 275 subjects, including 68
normal subjects and 207 patients on warfarin therapy. The following
hematocrit values were assessed: <25%, 25–30%, 30–35%, 35–40%, 40–
45%, 45–50%, and 50–55%. Results demonstrated that the microINR Chip
is unaffected by hematocrits within the claimed hematocrit range of 25–
55%.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method Comparison Study: The method comparison study was performed at three
U.S. clinical sites, where a total of 273 subjects (normal subjects and patients on
warfarin therapy), 18 years of age and older were enrolled. The method comparison
study was conducted with four lots of microINR Chips and five microINR Meters.
Three sequential fingerstick samples were obtained by healthcare professionals for
INR determinations on the microINR System and CoaguChek XS System (predicate
device). In addition, a venipuncture was performed for INR determinations on the
reference method (ACL TOP 500 with HemosIL RecombiPlasTin) and for the
hematocrit assessment. Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed to assess
the accuracy of the microINR against both methods, the predicate device and the
reference laboratory. All results met the pre-defined acceptance criteria. Table 1
summarizes the study results by individual sites and all sites combined between the
microINR System and CoaguChek XS System. Table 2 summarizes the study results
by individual sites and all sites combined between the microINR System and
reference laboratory method (ACL TOP 500 with HemosIL RecombiPlasTin).

performance studies, a matrix comparison study was conducted in order to validate
the results obtained regardless of the type of sample analyzed. INR results from
capillary whole blood and venous whole blood samples from the same patients on
warfarin therapy and normal subjects were compared using a Deming Regression.
Matrix comparability was assessed with 50 normal subjects and 157 patients on
warfarin therapy. The following table summarizes the comparability amongst

this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
14

--- Page 15 ---
The microINR Chip contains information about the test method, lot number and expiry
date. The date and INR result are recorded by the microINR Meter.
The microINR Meter also has an optional patient identification functionality, where the
end user can manually enter information.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The microINR chip is intended for single-use only. One the microINR chip is inserted
into the device, a drop of fresh capillary whole blood sample collected by fingerstick is
manually applied to the chip and analyzed by the microINR meter. The microINR chip is
to be discarded after use.
5. Calibration:
microINR chips are calibrated according to CLSI H54-A. Each lot of microINR chips is
calibrated to a reference lot of human recombinant thromboplastin traced to the
International Reference Thromboplastin of the World Health Organization.
The calibration parameters (International Sensitivity Index and Mean Normal
Prothrombin Time) are encoded in the printed datamatrix of each microINR Chip along
with information related to the expiration date. Every test is automatically and
individually calibrated.
6. Quality Control:
Functional QC and On-Board QC: The microINR System provides both meter functional
QC and on-board QCs. First, the microINR Meter’s performance is automatically
checked for electronic components, correct power battery level and environmental
temperature conditions. Then, on-board controls provide a QC check for each individual
microINR Chip used with the microINR Meter. The microINR System is designed to
detect errors prior to and during the test in order to prevent inaccurate INR results
through a multi-level strategy:
· Level 1: Pre-test QC is based on machine vision system (MVS) analysis of the
capture of the whole microINR Chip. Level 1 QC tasks check for defects in the
microINR Chip and microINR Meter characteristics by several pattern
recognition criteria prior to applying the sample. Specifically, system integrity,
chip insertion, datamatrix reading and luminosity are checked.
· Level 2: Test QC. After sample detection, the captured images are analyzed and
evaluated by the MVS. This process detects environmental degradation,
manufacturing defects, microINR Meter detection system problems and problems
related to sample quality. Specifically, these QC tasks consist of reaction kinetics
analysis, blob analysis and sample quality analysis.
15

--- Page 16 ---
· Level 3: Parallel control channel provides INR results in a near normal INR range
when the microINR Chip is used under intended use conditions. This process
detects environmental microINR chip degradation, unacceptable test temperature
and contaminated and contraindicated sample type use.
External Liquid QC: In addition to functional QC and on-board QCs, the microINR
System offers optional external liquid QC materials, microINR Control Levels A and B.
Each microINR Control is provided in glass vials with lyophilized human citrated plasma
in the therapeutic range (relative to the medical decision points of 2.0 or 3.0 INR)
together with plastic unit-dose containers containing a calcium chloride solution. Every
microINR Control (either Level A or Level B) purchased contains:
· Five vials of 2 mL lyophilized human abnormal plasma with buffers, stabilizers
and preservatives
· Five unit-dose containers of 2 mL calcium solution with calcium chloride
dissolved in distilled water
· Five capillary droppers
· One set of instructions for use
External Liquid QC – Value Assignment: Target assignment is performed for each
microINR Control lot. When there is a change in the lot of any of these two components a
new target assignment is performed. Target assignment is performed by one operator,
using three microINR Meters and one microINR Chip lot for several runs over a
minimum of 5 days. Two runs per day and three INR determinations from one vial per
run are performed (5 days x 2 runs/day x 3 determinations/run). At least a total of 10 vials
of reconstituted microINR Control are required per INR level (5 days x 2 runs/day x 1
vial/run).
External Liquid QC – Precision (Repeatability and Reproducibility): This study was
performed back on CLSI EP05-A3. Four lots of microINR Controls of each Level (A and
B) were assessed, each by one operator, using three different microINR Meters and a
different microINR Chip lot. Each lot was conducted over a minimum of 5 days where
two runs per day and three INR determinations from one vial per run were performed (5
days x 2 runs/day x 3 determinations/run). Variance components were determined by a
three-way nested ANOVA. Preparations of controls and INR determinations were
performed as per the indications for use of the microINR Controls. All test results met the
pre-defined acceptance criteria. The Table below presents the summarized results for
both microINR Control Level A and microINR Control Level B.

External Liquid QC – In-Use Stability: This study was conducted as per CLSI EP25-A
where one microINR Control lot per Level (A and B) were assessed. A total of 20 vials of
microINR Controls were tested each (A and B) on five microINR Meters using one
microINR Chip lot on all timepoints (t0–t5). One INR determination was performed per
microINR Meter and microINR Control vial. Study results demonstrated that the in-use
stability of the microINR Controls is 14 minutes at room temperature (15–25°C).
External Liquid QC – Accelerated Stability Study: This study was conducted as per CLSI
EP25-A where microINR Controls from one lot per Level (A and B) were stored at 24.0
°C ± 1.1 °C (75.2 °F ± 34.0 °F). A total of 10 vials of microINR Controls were tested
each on 10 microINR Meters using one microINR Chip lot on day 0, 23, 45, 68, 91 and
106 days. One INR determinations was performed per microINR Meter and vial. The
data projected by the accelerated study estimate a preliminary stability of the microINR
Controls is of 14 months stored at refrigerated conditions of 2–8°C (35.6–46.4 °F). Upon
market release, the expiration dating will be 12 months.
