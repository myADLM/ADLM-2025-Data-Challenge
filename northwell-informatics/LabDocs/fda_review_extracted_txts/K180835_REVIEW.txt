L. Test Principle:
The enzyme, acyl amidohydrolase, cleaves the amide bond of the acetaminophen molecule,
leaving p-aminophenol and acetate. The p-aminophenol is coupled with 2,5-dimethylphenol
in the presence of manganese ions to form a colored compound, 4-(4-iminophenol)-2,5-
dimethylcyclohexadiene-1-one. The increased absorbance at 605 nm due to the formation of
4-(4-iminophenol)-2,5-dimethylcyclohexadiene-1-one is directly proportional to the
concentration of acetaminophen in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
All performance studies were conducted with the Roche Hitachi 717 clinical chemistry
analyzer.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was conducted in a study using three lots of SEKURE Acetaminophen L3K
reagent and two lots of calibrator. Nine samples from 100 to 2700 µmol/L
acetaminophen were prepared. A high concentration stock was prepared from a stock
acetaminophen standard of USP acetaminophen in pooled acetaminophen-free human
serum. The high concentration stock was then diluted with an acetaminophen free
sample to generate seven linearity samples. Expected concentrations were calculated
based on the known value of the USP standard material values and the dilution
factors. Samples were analyzed in quadruplicate. The mean and deviation of the

The linearity data met acceptance criteria and support a measuring range from 115 to

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The SEKURE Acetaminophen Calibrator is traceable to USP grade reference
acetaminophen material. Stability protocol and results are reviewed and found
acceptable. Stability testing supports a shelf life of 12 months.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB): LoB was evaluated according to CLSI EP17-A2 using three
lots of SEKURE Acetaminophen L3K reagent on the Hitachi 717. Five blank samples
were assayed over three operating days for a total of 60 replicates per sample. For
each reagent lot, the LoB results were ranked from lowest to highest concentration,
and the LoB was estimated to be the result equivalent to the concentration at the 95th
percentile. The LoB was determined to be 1.0 µmol/L.
Limit of Detection (LoD): Five low level samples were evaluated using three lots of
reagents over three operating days for a total of 60 replicates per sample. The LoD
was calculated for each reagent lot by LoD = LoB + C SD . This study yielded a LoD
p L
of 2.4 µmol/L.
Limit of quantitation (LoQ): A set of six low-level samples was measured using three
lots of reagents over five runs across three operating days for a total of 40 replicates
per sample. The LoQ was calculated based on % total error is <25%. The LoQ was
determined to be 8 µmol/L.

e. Analytical specificity:
i. Interference from endogenous substances/cross reactants
Interference studies were performed in accordance to CLSI EP07-A2. Four
acetaminophen serum pools prepared from USP acetaminophen dissolved in patient
serum pool (33 μmol/L, 100μmol/L, 199 μmol/L and 900 µmol/L) were evaluated.
Testing was conducted using three lots of Acetaminophen reagent and two lots of
calibrator on the Hitachi 717. The potential interferents were added individually to
aliquots of the serum specimen pools. Control samples contained corresponding
concentrations of acetaminophen without potential interferents. Significant
interference was evaluated using a significance criterion of greater than ±10% or 8
μmol/L from control. The highest concentrations of each substance that did not show
significant interference with each acetaminophen concentration tested are shown in

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison test was conducted on the Roche Hitachi 717 analyzer using
three lots of SEKURE Acetaminophen L3K reagent, as compared to one lot of the
predicate Acetaminophen L3K reagent. 105 samples were tested in singlicate. The
samples tested ranged from 116 to 2447 μmol/L (17.5 -369.4 μg/mL). Deming
regression analysis resulted in a slope of 0.974, a y-intercept of 4.7 μmol/L, and a
correlation coefficient of 0.9999. Passing-Bablok regression analysis resulted in a
slope of 0.975, a y-intercept of 2.3 μmol/L, and a correlation coefficient of 0.9999.
b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison studies were performed for Serum (with gel in plastic, SST),
EDTA, Lithium heparin (with gel in plastic, PST), Lithium heparin (without gel in
plastic), Lithium heparin (Barricor tube), Sodium heparin (without gel in plastic) vs
serum (without gel in plastic). A set of fifty matched sample sets were tested and
percent recovery was determined. All percent recoveries were within ± 10%.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Reference range were cited from the following literatures: Tietz Textbook of Clinical
Chemistry, Second Edition, pp 1168, 2212, W.B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia
(1994)
Therapeutic concentration: 10-30 μg/mL (66-199 μmol/L)
Toxic concentration: > 200 μg/mL (1324 μmol/L)
These values are suggested guidelines. It is recommended that each laboratory establish
its own expected range.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
