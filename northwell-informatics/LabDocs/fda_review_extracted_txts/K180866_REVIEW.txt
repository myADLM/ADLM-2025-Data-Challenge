L. Test Principle:
The glucose measurement of the CareSens S Fit system is based on an electrochemical
biosensor technology. The glucose level in the whole blood sample is oxidized by the
enzyme glucose oxidase and the resulting electrical current generated from the enzymatic
reaction is measured and converted to a glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude
of the current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample. The resulting
glucose result is displayed by the meter for the user.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed using eleven venous whole blood samples with the
following glucose concentrations (as measured by the comparator method YSI 2300):
37.4 , 46.1, 109, 181, 245, 316, 378, 448, 519, 584, and 649 mg/dL (as established
using a laboratory comparator method YSI 2300). Each level was measured in
replicates of 15 using three test strip lots and the values from the CareSens S Fit
meter were compared with those obtained from the YSI 2300. The evaluation yielded
the following regression equations:
Strip Lot Slope Y-Intercept R2
1 0.953 -0.432 1
2 0.954 -0.747 0.999
3 0.948 1.817 1.000
Combined 0.952 0.219 1.000
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of
40 - 600 mg/dL. If a sample result is less than 40 mg/dL glucose, the result is flagged
by the meter as “Lo”. If a sample result exceeds 600 mg/dL glucose, the result is
flagged by the meter as “Hi”. The “Lo” and “Hi” functions were validated by the
sponsor and were demonstrated to function as intended.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The CareSens S Fit Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to NIST-965B
glucose reference material. The method comparison study (section M.3.c below) was
performed with the candidate device and the YSI 2300 analyzer as the comparator
method.

Test Strip Stability
Stability of CareSens S Blood Glucose Test Strips were assessed using real time and
accelerated testing. Protocols and acceptance criteria for were reviewed and found to
be acceptable. The sponsor claims shelf life stability of 2.2 years and open-vial
stability of 5 months when stored at the recommended storage conditions of 34°F-
86°F (1-30°C) and 20-80% relative humidity (RH).
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range, verified by the linearity study (Section M.1.b.) is 40-600
mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by spiking endogenous and exogenous
substances into venous whole blood at 3 glucose levels (50-70, 110-130, and 225-270
mg/dL). The CareSens S Fit meter results obtained from samples containing potential
interfering substances were compared to meter results obtained with samples
containing no added potential interferent. Samples were tested at each glucose level
using 3 test strip lots in replicates of 10. The highest concentration of each substance
tested with no significant interference (as defined by the sponsor as bias ≤10 mg/dL
for glucose <75 mg/dL or ≤10% or glucose ≥75 mg/dL) is summarized in the
following table:

Lay-User Study
To assess the performance of the CareSens S Fit Blood Glucose Monitoring System
in the hands of the intended user, the sponsor performed a lay-user evaluation study
with 376 lay user participants who collected and tested samples from their own
fingertips using only the device labeling as instructions. Results were analyzed by
comparing the blood glucose results obtained using the CareSens S Fit System to
results obtained with a laboratory comparator method (YSI 2300). Glucose
concentrations in study ranged from 55.6 to 441.5 mg/dL as measured by YSI 2300.
The results relative to YSI values are summarized below:

Accuracy of CareSens S Fit BGMS vs. YSI2300 at Extreme Glucose Values
To assess the performance of the system with extreme glucose concentrations (<80
mg/dL and >250 mg/dL) the sponsor altered capillary blood samples, by spiking or
allowing samples to glycolyze, to achieve glucose concentrations below 80 mg/dL
(42.6 to 77.1 mg/dL, as measured by YSI 2300) and above 250 mg/dL (253.3 to 567.5
mg/dL, as measured by YSI 2300). Results were analyzed by comparing the blood
glucose results obtained on the CareSens S Fit BGMS against YSI 2300 results. The
data is summarized below:

5. Calibration:
No user calibration is required.
6. Quality Control:
CareSens S Control Solutions are for use with the CareSens S Fit Blood Glucose Meter
and CareSens S Fit Blood Glucose Test Strips to check that the meter and the test strips
are working together properly and that the test is performing correctly. Two control
solution levels (1 and 2) are available. Control solutions must be purchased separately
from the system. The control solution readings are not included in the average of the
patient results when the measurements are performed in the “Control Solution Test
Mode”. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label.
The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered in the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the CareSens S Fit Blood
Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using venous whole blood samples with 20%,
25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, and 60% hematocrit at glucose levels of 30-5,
51-110, 111-150, 151-250, and 251-400 mg/dL. Measurements were taken with 10
glucose meters and 3 test strip lots and values compared with those obtained from the
comparator method, YSI-2300. The study results support the claimed hematocrit range
of 20-60%.
2. Operating Conditions Study:
The sponsor performed operating condition studies using venous whole blood samples
with three glucose levels (40-65, 00-150, 200-300 mg/dL) to evaluate temperatures
ranging from 50°F - 104°F (10-40°C) and relative humidity from 10% to 90%. Meter
results were compare to the YSI 2300 comparator method. Four temperature and
humidity combinations were tested including low temperature/low humidity, low
temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low humidity and high temperature/high
humidity. The results support the claims in the labeling that the system can be used in
conditions of 50°F - 104°F (10-40°C) with relative humidity of 10 to 90%.
3. Altitude Tests:
Three sets of venous blood samples were adjusted to 3 blood glucose levels: 50-65, 100-
120, and 200-250 mg/dL. Each sample was measured using YSI 2300 as well as 10
CareSens S Fit BGMS meters using 3 test strip lots under simulated altitude conditions in
an adjustable barometric pressure chamber. Three simulated conditions were tested: 0 m
(Sea Level, 760 mm Hg), 1524 m (5,000 ft, 632 mm Hg), 3048 m (10,000 ft, 522 mm
Hg). The results support the labeling claims that altitudes up to 10,000 feet have no
significant effect on performance of the CareSens S Fit System.

4. Short Sample Detection
Three venous blood samples were prepared at three glucose range intervals (50-65
mg/dL, 100-120 mg/dL, and 200-250 mg/dL). Meter results were compared against
duplicate YSI 2300 measurements. Results support the claimed minimum sample
volume of 0.5 μL. The sponsor provided validation studies demonstrating that with blood
volumes below 0.5 μL, the insufficient sample volume error message functioned as
intended.
5. Sample Perturbation Study
To evaluate system performance when sample is perturbed during testing, test strips were
disturbed by bending, flicking, and flicking the meter during measurement. Venous
blood samples were prepared at three glucose range intervals (63.3 mg/dL, 118.3 mg/dL,
and 241.5 mg/dL per YSI2300). Meter results were compared against YSI 2300
measurements. Results demonstrated that meter measurement was insensitive to sample
perturbation of the test strip or meter during sample measurement.
6. Intermittent Sampling
To evaluate system performance during intermittent sampling, venous whole blood
samples were prepared at three glucose range intervals (50-65 mg/dL, 100-120 mg/dL,
and 200-250 mg/dL). Samples were applied to the test strip intermittently (i.e., within 1
second or over a period a several seconds). The results demonstrated that, when the full
sample was applied within one second, a valid test results was generated, whereas
intermittent sampling beyond one second generated an error message on the meter. Thus,
the system was validated to be robust to intermittent sampling, and the error code
functioned as intended to prevent erroneous results.
7. Testing with Used Test Strips
A study was performed to demonstrate that the system is capable of detecting when a test
strip had previously been measured or if sample was applied to a test strip prior to
insertion in the meter. The meter correctly displayed the “Er 1” message whenever a
used test strip was inserted.
8. Device Stress Testing:
To assess insensitivity of the CareSens S Fit Blood Glucose meter to extreme physical
stresses that may be encountered in the intended use environment by performing various
tests such as drop testing, vibration testing, temperature and humidity exposure limit
testing Results demonstrated that the meter is insensitive to certain stresses that may be
encountered during use.
9. Cleaning and Disinfection Validation:
The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies
were performed on the external materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial
testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with
the chosen disinfectant, Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes (EPA Registration
#67619-12). A robustness study was also conducted by the sponsor demonstrating that
there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter after 260
13

cleaning and disinfection cycles using the Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes.
The robustness studies were designed to simulate 5 years of single-patient device use.
Each cycle consisted of 3 horizontal and 3 vertical cleaning passes across the front, sides,
and back of the meter. After one minute, the entire meter is wiped with a dry cloth and
the process is repeated using a second disinfectant wipe and a second dry cloth. One pass
was defined as a back and forth motion. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions
for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
