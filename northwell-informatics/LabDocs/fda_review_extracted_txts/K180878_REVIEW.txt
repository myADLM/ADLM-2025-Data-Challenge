VENTURE Rapid Marijuana Test Cassette for Rx Use is a rapid lateral flow
immunoassay for the qualitative detection of d-Amphetamine, Oxazepam,
Benzoylecgonine, d-Methamphetamine, Morphine and Delta-9-THC-COOH
in human urine. The test cut-off concentrations and the compounds the tests are
calibrated to are as follows:
Drug Identifier Cut-off Level
Amphetamine(AMP) 1000ng/mL
Oxazepam 300 ng/mL
Cocaine(COC) 300 ng/mL
Marijuana(THC) 50 ng/mL
Methamphetamine(MET) 1000 ng/mL
Morphine 300 ng/mL
The cassette test may be configured as single drug test in any drug analytes listed in
the table. The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative
chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry is the preferred confirmatory method.
Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug
of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. The test is intended for prescription use.

Rapid Oxazepam Test Cassette for Rx Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid Cocaine Test
Cassette for Rx Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid Methamphetamine Test Cassette for Rx
Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid Morphine Test Cassette for Rx Use, BIO-VENTURE

Cassette for OTC Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid Cocaine Test Cassette for OTC Use,
BIO-VENTURE Rapid Methamphetamine Test Cassette for OTC Use, BIO-
VENTURE Rapid Morphine Test Cassette for OTC Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid
Marijuana Test Cassette for OTC Use differ in intended use (prescription use or over
the counter use), but share the same test cassette, with each cassette housing only one of
6 different drug test strips (for the qualitative detection of d-Methamphetamine,
Morphine, 11-Nor-△9-Tetrahydrocannabinol-9-COOH, d-Amphetamine, Cocaine or
Oxazepam in human urine).
The BIO-VENTURE test cassettes (noted in the above paragraph) are
immunochromatographic assays that use a lateral flow system for the qualitative
detection of d-Methamphetamine, Morphine, 11-Nor-△9-Tetrahydrocannabinol-9-
COOH, d-Amphetamine, Cocaine and Oxazepam in human urine. The tests are
available in single drug test cassette formats. BIO-VENTURE test cassettes are coated
with mouse monoclonal antibodies, each raised against specific drug analytes
(deposited on the test line), and a anti-IgG polyclonal antibody (deposited on the
control line). The cassettes are provided in individual aluminum foil bags.

Cassette for OTC Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid Cocaine Test Cassette for OTC Use,
BIO-VENTURE Rapid Methamphetamine Test Cassette for OTC Use, BIO-
VENTURE Rapid Morphine Test Cassette for OTC Use, and BIO-VENTURE Rapid
Marijuana Test Cassette for OTC Use are rapid tests for the qualitative detection of
Methamphetamine, Morphine, 11-Nor-△9-Tetrahydrocannabinol-9-COOH, d-
Amphetamine, Benzoylecgonine and Oxazepam in urine samples. The tests are lateral
flow chromatographic immunoassays. During testing, a urine specimen migrates across
the test strip by capillary action. If target drugs present in the urine specimen are below
the cut-off concentration, they will not saturate the binding sites of specific anti-target
drug monoclonal mouse antibodies coated on gold-conjugated nanoparticles, allowing
the antibody-coated nanoparticles to be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate on the
test line, and a visible colored line will show up in the test line region. The colored line
in the test line region will not form if the target drug level exceeds its cutoff
concentration because it will saturate all the binding sites of the antibody-coated
nanoparticles, thus competing for binding to the test line region.
A band should form in the control region of the devices regardless of the presence of
drug or metabolite in the sample to indicate that sample has migrated past the test and
control line regions.

Cross-reactivity:
Cross-reactivity was evaluated by spiking in potential cross-reactants and
titrating down to find the lowest concentration of cross-reactant that produced a
positive result with the assays. The percent cross-reactivity was calculated as:
(cutoff concentration / lowest concentration causing a positive result) x 100

Interferences:
Interference was evaluated by spiking the potential interferents below into urine
samples at ± 25% of the cut-off for the AMP, COC, BNZ, MET, MOP, and
THC assays.
All potential interferents were tested at a concentration of 100 µg/mL except for
THC which was tested at 10 µg/mL and 1% Ethanol. There were no deviations
from the expected results for any of the the three formats.

The effect of pH was evaluated by preparing samples at ± 25% of the cutoff for
the MET, MOR, THC, AMP, COC, and OXAZ assays and adjusting the pH to
4.00 to 9.00, in increments of 1 pH unit. There were no deviations from the
expected results.

f. Assay cut-off:
For characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed
cutoff concentration, please refer to section M.1.a., above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The BIO-VENTURE Rapid Amphetamine Test Cassette for OTC Use, BIO-
VENTURE Rapid Oxazepam Test Cassette for OTC Use, BIO-VENTURE
Rapid Cocaine Test Cassette for OTC Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid
Methamphetamine Test Cassette for OTC Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid
Morphine Test Cassette for OTC Use, and BIO-VENTURE Rapid Marijuana
Test Cassette for OTC Use are identical physical devices to the BIO-VENTURE
Rapid Amphetamine Test Cassette for Rx Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid
Oxazepam Test Cassette for Rx Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid Cocaine Test
Cassette for Rx Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid Methamphetamine Test Cassette
for Rx Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid Morphine Test Cassette for Rx Use, BIO-

labeling appropriate for OTC users. Method comparison testing was conducted
using the The BIO-VENTURE Rapid Amphetamine Test Cassette for OTC Use,
BIO-VENTURE Rapid Oxazepam Test Cassette for OTC Use, BIO-VENTURE
Rapid Cocaine Test Cassette for OTC Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid
Methamphetamine Test Cassette for OTC Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid

Test Cassette for OTC Use devices, but represents expected performance from
both the Rx and OTC devices.
Method comparison studies for the BIO-VENTURE Rapid Single Drug Test
Cassettes for Amphetamine, Oxazepam, Cocaine and Cocaine metabolites,
Marijuana, Methamphetamine, Morphine were performed in-house with three
laboratory assistants for each device. Operators ran unaltered clinical samples;
87 samples for amphetamine, 80 samples for cocaine, 80 samples for
Oxazepam, 81 samples for Methamphetamine, 81 samples for Morphine and 82
samples for Marijuana. The samples were blind-labeled and compared to results
obtained by GC/MS. The results are presented in the tables below:

VENTURE Rapid Marijuana Test Cassette for OTC Use devices with 840 lay
persons with diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranging in
age from 20 to <50 years. Urine samples were prepared at the following
concentrations; negative, +/-75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of the cutoff by spiking
drug(s) into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the
samples were confirmed by GC/MS, and the results provided below are from
each lay user, who tested only one device at one test concentration. Lay-users
were also given surveys on the ease of understanding the package insert
instructions (Flesch-Kincaid reading analysis revealed a reading Grade Level of
7 for the device labeling). All lay users indicated that the device instructions
could be easily followed.
