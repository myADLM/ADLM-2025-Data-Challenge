H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Refer to Indication for Use
2. Indication(s) for use:
BIO-VENTURE Rapid Multi-Drug Test Easy Cup for OTC Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid
Multi-Drug Test Split Key Cup for OTC Use is a rapid lateral flow immunoassay for the
qualitative detection of d-Amphetamine, Oxazepam, Benzoylecgonine, d-
Methamphetamine, Morphine and Delta-9-THC-COOH in human urine. The test cut-off
concentrations and the compounds the tests are calibrated to are as follows:
Test Calibrators Cut-off Level
Amphetamine (AMP) d-Amphetamine 1000ng/ml
Oxazepam Oxazepam 300ng/ml
Cocaine (COC Benzoylecgonine 300ng/ml
Methamphetamine (MET) d-Methamphetamine 1000ng/ml
Morphine(MOP) Morphine 300ng/ml
Marijuana(THC) Delta-9-THC- 50ng/ml
COOH
Easy cup test and Split key cup test may be configured as single drug tests or multiple
drug tests in any combination of the drug analytes listed in the table above up to a
maximum of 6 analytes.
The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry is the preferred confirmatory method.
Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of
abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. The test is intended for over the counter use.

Multi-Drug Test Split Key Cup for OTC Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid Multi-Drug Test
Easy Cup for Rx Use, and BIO-VENTURE Rapid Multi-Drug Test Split Key Cup for Rx
Use are immunochromatographic assays that use a lateral flow system for the qualitative
detection of d-Amphetamine, Oxazepam, Benzoylecgonine, d-Methamphetamine,
Morphine and 11-Nor-△9-Tetrahydrocannabinol-9- COOH (target analytes) in human
urine. The BIO-VENTURE Rapid Multi-Drug Test Easy Cup for OTC Use and BIO-
VENTURE Rapid Multi-Drug Test Easy Cup for Rx Use devices consist of a cup that
may be configured as single drug tests or multiple drug tests in any combination of the
drug analytes up to a maximum of 6 analytes , and the BIO-VENTURE Rapid Multi-
Drug Test Split Key Cup for OTC Use and the BIO-VENTURE Rapid Multi-Drug Test
Split Key Cup for Rx Use devices consist of a split key cup that may be configured as a
single drug test or multiple drug tests in any combination of the drug analytes up to 6
total. The tests are the first step in a two-step process. The second step is to send the
sample for laboratory testing if preliminary positive results are obtained.

L. Test Principle:
BIO-VENTURE Rapid Multi-Drug Test Easy Cup for OTC Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid
Multi-Drug Test Split Key Cup for OTC Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid Multi-Drug Test Easy
Cup for Rx Use and BIO-VENTURE Rapid Multi-Drug Test Split Key Cup for Rx Use are
rapid tests for the qualitative detection of d-Amphetamine, Benzoylecgonine, Oxazepam,
Methamphetamine, Morphine, and 11-Nor-△9-Tetrahydrocannabinol-9-COOH in urine
samples. The tests are lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays. During testing, a urine
specimen migrates upward by capillary action. If target drugs present in the urine specimen
are below the cut-off concentration, it will not saturate the binding sites of its specific

monoclonal mouse antibody coated on the particles. The antibody-coated particles will then
be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the test
line region. The colored line will not form in the test line region if the target drug level
exceeds its cutoff concentration because it will saturate all the binding sites of the antibody
coated on the particles.
A band should form in the control region of the devices regardless of the presence of drug or
metabolite in the sample to indicate that the tests have been performed properly.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The BIO-VENTURE Rapid Multi-Drug Test Easy Cup for OTC Use and BIO-
VENTURE Rapid Multi-Drug Test Easy Cup for Rx Use Use are identical physical
devices but the BIO-VENTURE Rapid Multi-Drug Test Easy Cup for OTC Use has
different labeling appropriate for OTC users. Similarly, the BIO-VENTURE Rapid
Multi-drug Test Split Key Cup for OTC Use and the BIO-VENTURE Rapid Multi-
drug Test Split Key Cup for Rx Use are identical physical devices but the BIO-
VENTURE Rapid Multi-drug Test Split Key Cup for OTC Use has different labeling
appropriate for OTC users.The precision testing is from one BIO-VENTURE Rapid
Multi-Drug Test Easy Cup device and one BIO-VENTURE Rapid Multi-drug Test
Split Key Cup but represents expected performance from both the Rx and OTC
devices.
Precision was evaluated by analyzing spiked urine samples at concentrations of -
100%, -75%, -50%, -25%, cutoff, +25%, +50%, +75%, and +100%. Three lots were
evaluated and the results were read by six operators. Results were as follows:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. These devices are intended for qualitative use only.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device has internal process controls. A control line appears in the control region
confirming that sufficient sample volume has been applied to the test strip and that
the sample has migrated correctly on the test strip. Users are informed that the test is
invalid if the colored line does not appear in the control region. There are no external
controls supplied with the device.
The sponsor claims that the devices are stable at 2-30 °C for 24 months based on a
real time stability studyat room temperature.

Cross-reactivity
Cross-reactivity was evaluated by spiking in potential cross-reactants and titrating
potential cross-reactants to find the lowest concentration of cross-reactant that
produced a positive result with each device. The percent cross-reactivity was
calculated as:
(cutoff concentration / lowest concentration causing a positive result) x 100

Interference was evaluated by spiking the potential interferents below into urine
samples having test drug analytes at ± 25% of the cutoff for each assay.
All potential interferents were tested at a concentration of 100 µg/mL, except for
Ethanol which was tested at a final concentration of 1%. There were no deviations
from the expected results for any of the devices.

Endogenous Interferents:
The effect of pH was evaluated by preparing samples with test drug analytes at ± 25%
of the cutoff for all devices and adjusting the pH to 4.00 to 9.00, in increments of 1
pH unit. There were no deviations from the expected results.
The effect of specific gravity was evaluated by preparing samples with test drug
analytes at ± 25% of the cutoff for all devices and adjusting the specific gravity from
1.002 – 1.033. There were no deviations from the expected results.

f. Assay cut-off:
For characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed
cutoff concentration, please refer to section M.1.a., above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The BIO-VENTURE Rapid Multi-Drug Test Easy Cup for OTC Use and BIO-
VENTURE Rapid Multi-Drug Test Easy Cup for Rx Use Use are identical physical
devices but the BIO-VENTURE Rapid Multi-Drug Test Easy Cup for OTC Use has
different labeling appropriate for OTC users. Similarly, the BIO-VENTURE Rapid
Multi-drug Test Split Key Cup for OTC Use and the BIO-VENTURE Rapid Multi-
drug Test Split Key Cup for Rx Use are identical physical devices but the BIO-
VENTURE Rapid Multi-drug Test Split Key Cup for OTC Use has different labeling
appropriate for OTC users.The method comparision testing is from one BIO-
VENTURE Rapid Multi-Drug Test Easy Cup device and one BIO-VENTURE Rapid
Multi-drug Test Split Key Cup but represents expected performance from both the Rx
and OTC devices.
Unaltered, remnant clinical samples were obtained to test amphetamines, cocaine and
oxazepam, morphine and THC. Three operators tested each sample, and each sample
was also tested by GC-MS for comparision.

Lay user studies
A lay user study was performed by 140 lay persons for each format for the BIO-
VENTURE Rapid Multi-Drug Test Easy Cup for OTC Use and the BIO-VENTURE
Rapid Multi-Drug Test Split Key Cup for OTC Use (280 lay persons total). The lay
users had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from
20 to > 50 years. Urine samples were prepared with test drug analytes at the following
concentrations; negative, +/-75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of the cutoff by spiking drug(s)
into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were
confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers and
blind-labeled. Each participant was provided with the package insert, 1 blind labeled
sample and a device.
