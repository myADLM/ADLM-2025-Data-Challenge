H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
ETEST is a quantitative technique for determination of antimicrobial susceptibility of
non-fastidious Gram-negative and Gram-positive aerobic bacteria such as
Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus species and
fastidious bacteria, such as anaerobes, N. gonorrhoeae, S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus and
Haemophilus species. The system comprises a predefined antibiotic gradient which is
used to determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), in µg/mL, of different
antimicrobial agents against microorganisms as tested on agar media using overnight
incubation.
Telavancin has been shown to be active against the Gram positive aerobic
microorganisms listed below according to the FDA label for this antimicrobial agent.
Active both in vitro and in clinical infections:
Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant isolates)
Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only)
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as the Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
Limitations:
· Due to the lack of an intermediate category and the observed trending for Telavancin, testing of
S. aureus and E. faecalis have resulted in major discrepancies for isolates that are otherwise
within essential agreement with the reference method. If critical to patient care, testing should be
repeated using an alternative testing/reference method prior to reporting results for S. aureus
when the ETEST TLA MIC is 0.25 µg/mL and 0.5 µg/mL for E. faecalis.
4. Special instrument requirements:
N/A
I. Device Description:
ETEST consists of a thin, inert and non-porous plastic strip 5mm wide and 60 mm long. One
side of the strip carries a three letter code designating the identity of the antibiotic and is
calibrated with MIC values in terms of µg/mL. On the reverse, a predefined exponential
gradient of the dried and stabilized antibiotic covers a continuous concentration range across

36, No. 1, January 2016.
L. Test Principle:
The ETEST consists of a thin, inert, nonporous plastic strip that is used to determine the
antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria. One side of the strip carries the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) reading scale expressed in µg/mL. The other side of the strip contains a
predefined continuous gradient of antibiotic concentrations.
When the strip is applied to an inoculated agar surface, the preformed antibiotic gradient
immediately transfers into the agar matrix, then forming a stable, continuous and exponential
gradient of antibiotic concentrations directly underneath the strip. Bacteria growth becomes
visible during incubation, and a symmetrical inhibition ellipse centered along the strip
appears. After incubation, the MIC value is read from the scale in terms of µg/mL at
complete inhibition of bacterial growth, where the pointed end of the ellipse intersects the
strip. Since ETEST generates MIC values which fall between two-fold dilutions for
interpretation, the MIC value read must be recorded to the next two-fold dilution.
The MIC gradient on ETEST Telavancin ranges from 0.002 to 32 µg/mL.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three external sites using 10 isolates of
Gram positive organisms that were consistent with the intended use. Testing was
performed on three separate days and in triplicate for a total of 270 data points among
the sites. The isolates tested included five S. aureus and five E. faecalis isolates.
The mode MIC was determined and the reproducibility was calculated based on MIC
values that fell within ± one doubling dilution from the mode MIC value. All results
were on-scale and within ± 1 doubling dilution of the mode MIC value for telavancin.
The overall reproducibility was 100.0%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Inoculum Density Check. Inoculum density checks were performed for all quality
control and reproducibility organism suspensions and for 10% of the suspensions
prepared for susceptibility testing of the fresh clinical isolates. The mean inoculum
density was acceptable at 4.40 X 105 CFU/mL.
Purity Check. All clinical, challenge and reproducibility test suspensions were
subcultured to assure purity.
Growth or Device Failure. There were no growth or device failures during the
course of the study.
Quality Control Testing. Organisms recommended by both FDA and the CLSI
were tested with telavancin at three sites. The QC organisms tested included S. aureus
ATCC 29213 and E. faecalis ATCC 29212. These QC strains were tested a minimum
of 20 times per site by both the ETEST and the reference method. The results
demonstrate that the telavancin ETEST can produce quality control results in the
recommended range > 95% of the time. See Table 2 below for a summary of the QC
results.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Results obtained with ETEST telavancin were compared to results obtained with the
CLSI broth microdilution reference panel. The CLSI panel was prepared and
interpreted in accordance with the CLSI Standard: CLSI Document M07-A10,
Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria that Grow
Aerobically; Approved Standard – Tenth Edition, Vol. 35, No. 2; January 2015. The
testing conditions for the reference method consisted of the following:
· Medium – Cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton Broth with appropriate dilutions of
antimicrobial solution added
· Inoculum – Direct colony suspension to achieve a turbidity equivalent to a 0.5
McFarland standard
· Incubation 35 °C in ambient air; 16-20 hours for all organisms
Clinical testing was performed at three sites using a total of 561 clinical isolates (31
vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis isolates, 228 vancomycin-susceptible E. faecalis
isolates, and 302 S. aureus isolates). Of the clinical isolates, 462 were fresh isolates
(82.4%) and 99 were stock isolates (17.6%). Clinical isolates were tested using both
ETEST and the reference method.
A total of 104 challenge isolates were also tested by ETEST and the reference method
(seven vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis isolates, 23 vancomycin-susceptible E.
faecalis isolates, and 74 S. aureus isolates). Testing of challenge isolates was
conducted at a single site.
Combined clinical and challenge isolates (665 including vancomycin-resistant E.
faecalis) included: 38 vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis isolates, 251 vancomycin-
susceptible E. faecalis isolates, and 376 S. aureus isolates. Of the 376 S. aureus
isolates tested, 181 isolates were methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and 189 were
methicillin-susceptible. Of the 376 S. aureus isolates tested, the methicillin-resistance
status was unavailable at the time of testing for 6 isolates.
For S. aureus, the combined results from clinical and challenge testing demonstrated
a combined EA of 98.4% and CA of 97.9% (Table 3). Eight major errors were
identified resulting in an overall major error rate of 2.2%. There were no very major
errors. Results were acceptable.
For vancomycin-susceptible E. faecalis, the combined results from clinical and
challenge testing demonstrated a combined EA of 91.6% and CA of 97.6% (Table 3).
7

--- Page 8 ---
Six major errors were identified resulting in an overall major error rate of 2.4%.
There were no very major errors. Results were acceptable. The 31 vancomycin-
resistant E. faecalis isolates that were tested were also identified as non-susceptible to
telavancin by the ETEST. This organism is not an indication for telavancin, however,
they were included in the study to evaluate the ability of the ETEST to evaluate
resistance.
The overall EA and CA of the Telavancin ETEST was acceptable. However, given
the lack of an intermediate interpretive criteria breakpoint and the observed trending
(see below) towards higher MIC value by ETEST compared to the reference method,
the following limitation was included in the labeling to instruct users to retest using
an alternative method for S. aureus isolates that result with an MIC of 0.25 µg/mL
and 0.5 µg/mL for E. faecalis.
Due to the lack of an intermediate category and the observed trending for
Telavancin, testing of S. aureus and E. faecalis have resulted in major
discrepancies for isolates that are otherwise within essential agreement with the
reference method. If critical to patient care, testing should be repeated using an
alternative testing/reference method prior to reporting results for S. aureus when
the ETEST® TLA MIC is 0.25 µg/mL and 0.5 µg/mL for E. faecalis.

Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when the result of the reference method and that of ETEST Telavancin are
within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on scale
for both ETEST Telavancin and the reference method. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the
interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of ETEST Telavancin.
MIC Trending
An analysis was conducted to evaluate trending in MIC values. Trending was
observed (Table 4) for each species tested for both S. aureus and E. faecalis tending
to be in exact agreement or higher when compared to the reference method. The
difference between higher and lower dilutions for E. faecalis was 72.11% and 63.83%
for S. aureus. The following footnotes were included in the labeling to indicate this
trending:
ETEST Telavancin MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or one doubling
dilution higher when testing Staphylococcus aureus compared to the reference
broth microdilution method.
ETEST Telavancin MIC values tended to be one doubling dilution higher when
testing Enterococcus faecalis compared to the reference broth microdilution
method.
