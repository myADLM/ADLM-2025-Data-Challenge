H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use:
The Fecal Extraction Device is a single use tube containing extraction buffer intended for
sampling and extracting human stool specimens and subsequent analysis with the
QUANTA Flash Calprotectin assay.
2. Indication for use:
Same as intended use

system. The QUANTA Flash Calprotectin IVD is for use with the BIO-FLASH
chemiluminescence detection instrument.
I. Device Description:
The optional Fecal Extraction Device (FED) acquires the amount of stool necessary to
perform the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin assay directly from the primary specimen
container instead of weighing the sample.
The device consists of a tube containing 2.8 mL of extraction buffer, and a stick shaped with
seven grooves for collecting the sample. The upper end of the device is made up of two parts
which can be removed with two separate rotations: the white screw cap (connected to the
plastic stick with grooves) is removed by twisting counter-clockwise. The red lower part (for
retaining the excess material) is removed by twisting clockwise. Once having completed the
extraction procedure, remove both the white and red upper parts. The tube containing the
extracted sample can be placed directly into the BIO-FLASH instrument sample rack.

L. Test Principle:
The optional FED collects the amount of stool used to perform the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin
assay directly from a primary specimen container instead of manually weighing the sample. The
FED also contains buffer for extraction of the sample. Following extraction with the FED, the
sample can be used for the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin assay procedure, per K170993.
The principle of the assay is chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay, a variation of solid
phase immunoassay. The QUANTA Flash Calprotectin assay is designed to run on the BIO-
FLASH instrument, which automatically processes the samples, runs the assay and reports the
results.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
All parameters met the manufacturer’s pre-established acceptance criteria.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
FED Validation
The manufacturer performed a study evaluating the reproducibility of sample
collection by the FED probe. Five stool specimens ranging from 2‒5 on the Bristol
Stool Form Scale (BSFS) were sampled by three operators with five replicates per
sample per operator. Samples on the FED were weighed against the empty weight of
the FED. Results of the study are summarized below:

Assay Precision
The sponsor performed a precision study, based on CLSI EP05-A3.
To study precision, eight stool samples representing the span of the analytical
measuring range (AMR) were extracted using the FED and tested once per day × five
replicates × five days × three operators, for a total of 75 measurements per sample.
Each FED extraction was performed daily by each operator independently. The
results of this study are summarized below:

The manufacturer has included a statement in the labeling alerting users that the assay
may have greater imprecision when used with the FED, as compared to the predicate
manual weighing method.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Assay linearity was evaluated in K170993.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Sample Stability
Sample stability was evaluated using seven stool samples selected to span the AMR,
with particular attention to the equivocal range (Eq): 50‒120 mg/kg fCal. Samples
were extracted using the FED and tested in duplicate with the QUANTA Flash fCal
assay for up to 73 hours stored at room temperature, up to 21 days stored at 2–8° C,
and after up to five cycles of freeze-thaw. All results met the manufacturers pre-
specified acceptance criteria.These results support the manufacturer’s
recommendation for sample storage up to 72 hours at room temperature, up to 14
days at 2–8° C, and up to four freeze-thaw cycles.

FED Shelf-Life Stability
Real-time stability was evaluated to determine shelf-life for the FED. pH values for
the extraction buffer in the device were assessed on three lots every 3‒6 months for a
total of 24‒26 months. pH values varied less than 5% within the timespan of the
study.
The stability of the FED was evaluated using fCal assay values as a performance
output. Fifteen stool samples selected to span the AMR were extracted using the FED
from two lots at expiration date, and one newly produced FED lot for comparison.
From these extracted samples, fCal values were tested with the QUANTA Flash fCal
assay. These results support the manufacturer’s recommendation for FED expiration
date up to two years.
FED Stability: Room Temperature Storage
Three independent lots of FED were evaluated for room temperature stability. Six
stool samples, selected to span the AMR, were extracted using FED devices stored at
room temperature for up to 73 hours, as compared to FED devices stored at 2–8° C
during this interval. From these extracted samples, fCal values were tested with the
QUANTA Flash fCal assay. These results support the manufacturer’s
recommendation for FED storage at room temperature up to 72 hours.
d. Detection limit:
Assay detection capabilities was evaluated in K170993.
e. Analytical specificity:
Assay analytical specificity was evaluated in K170993.
f. Assay cut-off:
Assay cutoff was evaluated in K170993.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Ninety-seven (97) human stool samples selected to represent the span of the AMR
were extracted by the FED as well as by the manual weighing method of the predicate
device. Samples from both processing methods were tested in singlicate by the
QUANTA Flash fCal assay. Linear regression by Passing-Bablok is summarized
below:

R2 0.975
Qualitative agreement measures derived from the FED were compared to the manual
weighing method to evaluate the comparative performance of the FED. Per FDA
Guidance, “Statistical Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating
Diagnostic Tests”, the positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent
agreement (NPA) were calculated with equivocal results considered positive as well
as negative.
