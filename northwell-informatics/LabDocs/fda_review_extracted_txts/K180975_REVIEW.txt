to paramagnetic beads, which are stored in the reagent cartridge lyophilized. When the assay
cartridge is ready to be used for the first time, a buffer solution is added to the tube
containing the beads, and the beads are re-suspended with the buffer. The reagent cartridge is
then loaded onto the BIO-FLASH instrument. A patient serum sample is diluted 1:17 by the
instrument in a disposable plastic cuvette. An aliquot of the diluted patient serum, HMGCR-
coupled beads, and assay buffer are combined into a second cuvette, and mixed. This cuvette
is incubated at 37°C. The beads are then magnetized and washed several times. Isoluminol
conjugated anti-human IgG antibody is then added to the cuvette, and incubated at 37°C.
Again, the beads are magnetized and washed repeatedly. The isoluminol conjugate produces
a luminescent reaction when “Trigger” reagents are added to the cuvette. The light produced
from this reaction is measured as Relative Light Units (RLU) by the BIO-FLASH optical
system. RLU values are proportional to the amount of bound isoluminol conjugate, which in
turn is proportional to the amount of anti-HMGCR antibodies bound to the antigen on the
beads. The QUANTA Flash HMGCR assay utilizes a predefined lot specific Master Curve
that is uploaded into the instrument through the reagent cartridge barcode. Based on the
results obtained by running two calibrators, an instrument specific Working Curve is created,
which is used by the software to calculate chemiluminescent units (CU) from the RLU value
obtained for each sample.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity: The analytical measuring range (AMR) of the assay is defined by the
lowest and highest points on the master curve, e.g., 1.5–550 CU. The linearity across
this range was evaluated by a study according to CLSI EP6-A. The linearity was
evaluated using four human serum samples with various anti-HMGCR antibody
concentrations which were combined with another human serum sample containing
low levels of anti-HMGCR antibodies in 10% increments (from 0% to 90% of low
sample) to obtain values that cover the entire AMR. Each dilution was tested in
duplicate. Percentage recovery of obtained mean results was calculated compared to
the expected results. Results were analyzed by performing linear regression analysis
and identifying the best fitting polynomial. For all samples, it was found that the best
fitting polynomial is linear, except for sample 3, where the best fitting polynomial
was a second order polynomial. The deviation from linearity between the linear
regression and the second order polynomial met the acceptance criteria. The linear
regression analysis was performed using the samples falling within the master curve
and the results of samples within AMR are summarized as follows:
Test Range Slope Y-intercept % Recovery

Auto-rerun: To validate the auto-rerun function with 1:20 dilutions, three high
positive specimens with anti-HMGCR antibody concentrations above assay
measuring range were run with the auto-rerun function enabled on the BIO-FLASH.
The same set of samples prepared manually with a 1:20 fold dilution were used as
reference values and tested with the concentration of 702.0, 1056.0 and 1272.0 CU,
respectively. The percent (%) recovery values for results obtained with the auto-rerun
results compared to the results obtained with the manual dilution were between 100%
and 105.7%.
Hook effect: Two high positive samples with anti-HMGCR antibody concentrations
above the assay measuring range (5193.6 CU and 744.0 CU) were tested to assess for
a potential hook effect. No hook effect was observed up to 5193.6 CU.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: There is no international reference material for anti-HMGCR antibodies
that allows for the standardization of anti-HMGCR antibodies detection assays.
Calibrator and Control values are directly traceable to in-house Standards that are
used to create the Master Curves for the QUANTA Flash HMGCR assay.
Value assignment: The QUANTA Flash HMGCR Calibrators and Controls are
manufactured by diluting human serum that contains a high concentration of anti-
HMGCR antibodies with a stabilizer and preservative solution. The human serum is
obtained from commercial sources and it is tested for markers of infectious
substances. Upon completion of the manufacturing process, the Calibrators and
Controls are tested on at least two instruments, with at least two lots of reagent
cartridge, and in replicates of five to obtain a minimum of 10 data points to determine
final value assignment.

QUANTA Flash HMGCR Controls
Negative control 10 8–12
Positive control 50 40–60
Stability:
Kit stability (unopened): Kit stability studies were performed. Accelerated stability
study was performed for three weeks at 37°C using three lots and six samples run in
duplicate at the following concentrations: 10.6 CU, 19.4 CU, 49.3 CU, 62.7 CU,
139.0 CU, and 317.2 CU. The accelerated stability study supports a claim for a 12-
month shelf life. Real-time stability study has been performed at six-month intervals
on the QUANTA Flash HMGCR reagents, to verify the 12-month expiration date
assigned based on the accelerated stability study. A negative sample (Negative
Control), a low positive sample (Positive Control) and a high positive patient sample
were tested in replicates of six (replicates of nine at time zero). At the time of the
submission, results were available up to 12 months for the Reagent Cartridge. The
results of the real-time stability study performed to date support a claim of 12 months
stability for unopened reagent cartridge.
On-board (In-use) stability: On-board stability study was performed for the reagent
cartridge:
Two lots of cartridges were tested with four serum specimens (with different
reactivity levels) along with the Negative and Positive Controls. The specimens were
tested periodically up to 61 days. Percent recoveries were calculated compared to the

day zero average values, and linear regression analysis was performed by plotting %
recovery against the number of days.
The results support on-board stability claim of 60 days.
Sample stability: The study was performed with four samples (negative, around the
cut-off, moderate positive and high positive samples) for 14 days while stored at 2–
8°C, and up to 48 hours while stored at room temperature (RT). In addition, the
samples were tested for stability for three repeated freeze/thaw cycles. The results
support sample stability for 48 hours of storage at RT, for 14 days of storage at 2–
8°C, and for three freeze/thaw cycles when samples are stored at or below -20°C.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying four blank samples in five
replicates per sample over three days with two reagent lots. Sixty data points were
generated for each lot. LoB was calculated as the 95th percentile using the parametric
method for one lot, and non-parametric method for the other lot, as the dataset
showed non-normal distribution. The LoB was determined to be 0.0 CU for each lot.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by assaying four low level samples
prepared by mixing human serum samples with high and low levels of anti-HGMCR
antibodies. Each sample was tested in five replicates over three days with two reagent
lots. LoD was calculated as the LoB + 1.652 x SD (standard deviation) of the
replicates for the low level samples. The LoD of the QUANTA Flash HMGCR assay
was determined to be 0.2 CU, which is below the AMR of the assay.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined by assaying four low level samples
prepared by mixing human serum samples with high and low levels of anti-HGMCR
antibodies that were run in five replicates over three days with two reagent lots. There
were 30 data points per sample. The LoQ of the QUANTA Flash HMGCR assay was
determined to be 1.5 CU, which has been set as the lower limit of the analytical
measuring range.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interference: Four human serum specimens, one high positive (257.4
CU), one moderately positive (125.2 CU), one around the cutoff (18.0 CU) and one
negative sample (7.4 CU) were tested. Interfering substances were spiked into every
specimen in 10% of total specimen volume at the following concentrations: bilirubin
(1 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml, 0.25 mg/ml); hemoglobin (2mg/ml, 1mg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml);
triglycerides (1000 mg/dl, 500 mg/dl, 250 mg/dl); cholesterol (332.5 mg/dl, 166.25
mg/dl, 83.125 mg/dl); human IgG (70 mg/dl, 35 mg/dl, 17.5 mg/dl); Rheumatoid
Factor IgM (153.4 IU/ml, 76.7 IU/ml, 38.35 IU/mL). The resulting samples were
tested in triplicates with the QUANTA Flash HMGCR assay. Recovery of the unit
values was calculated compared to control samples spiked with the same volume of
9

diluents only. No interferences were detected with the aforementioned interferents at
the tested concentrations.
Exogenous Interference: Four human serum specimens, one moderately positive (99.5
CU), one low positive (42.6 CU), one around the cutoff (24.1 CU), and one negative
sample (9.8 CU) were tested. Interfering substances were spiked into every specimen
in 10% of total specimen volume at the following concentrations: atorvastatin (600
mg/ml); PQQ (24 µg/mL); simvastatin (600 ng/ml); methylprednisolone (36 µg/mL);
coenzyme Q (0.72 mg/ml). The resulting samples were assessed in triplicates with the
QUANTA Flash HMGCR assay. Recovery of the unit values was calculated
compared to control samples spiked with the same volume of diluents only. No
interferences were detected with the aforementioned interferents at the tested
concentrations.
f. Assay cut-off:
The QUANTA HMGCR cut-off was determined by testing a set of samples from a
reference population of 157 subjects [23 apparently healthy donors, 22 infectious
disease controls (HBV, HCV, syphilis), 18 scleroderma controls, 20 systemic lupus
erythematosus controls, 48 end stage renal disease controls, 14 false positive cohort
(high reactivity samples) and 12 diagnosed idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM)
patient specimens]. The cut-off was established as 20 CU (30,000 RLU) based on the
99th percentile of the results obtained.
Positive Negative
QUANTA Flash HMGCR ≥ 20 CU < 20 CU
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Despite the fact that the two assays aid in the diagnosis of IIM, there is no apparent
overlap between the two types of autoantibodies in IIM diagnosed subjects.
Consequently, a method comparison study between the QUANTA Flash HMGCR
and the QUANTA Flash Jo-1 is not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Clinical Specificity:
A total of 723 characterized samples, none of which were used for establishing the
reference range, were included in the clinical validation for the QUANTA Flash

were analyzed using the QUANTA Flash HMGCR on a panel of 100 apparently healthy
blood donors (50 females/50 males, ages 17 to 57 years, with an average and median age
of 34 years). With a cut-off of 20 CU, all samples were negative with the QUANTA
Flash HMGCR. The mean concentration was < 1.8 CU, and the values ranged from <1.5
to 8.0 CU.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
