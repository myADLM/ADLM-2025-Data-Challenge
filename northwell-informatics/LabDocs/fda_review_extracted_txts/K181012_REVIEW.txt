L. Test Principle:
The BÜHLMANN fCAL ELISA is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
performed using patient stool samples collected without preservatives and contains a
microtiter plate coated with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) for calprotectin. Extracted patient
stool samples, calibrators, and controls are incubated in the wells. After the washing step, a
monoclonal detection antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) binds to the
calprotectin molecules bound to the antibody coated onto the plate. After incubation and a
further washing step, Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) is added as a substrate (blue color
formation) followed by a stopping reaction (change to yellow color). The absorption of
calibrators, controls, and samples are measured at 450 nm. The intensity of the color is
proportional to the amount of conjugate bound, and thus to the amount of captured
calprotectin. The concentration of calprotectin in the extracted sample is interpreted from a
standard curve generated from the five calibrators and converted to μg of calprotectin per g of
stool using a conversion factor supplied in the package insert. Samples determined to have <
80 μg/g are interpreted as normal, while samples determined to have 80 – 160 μg/g fall into a
gray zone that should be repeated within four to six weeks, and samples determined to have >
160 μg/g are interpreted as elevated.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance: All results presented below met the manufacturer’s pre-
determined acceptance criteria.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision: Seven extracted stool samples of various concentrations of calprotectin
were tested for 10 days with two runs per day in four replicates per run, for a total of
80 fCAL ELISA test results per sample. The mean fCAL ELISA test result was
computed and the within-run, between-run, between-day, and total standard
deviations (SD) and associated coefficients of variation (%CV) were estimated.

Reproducibility: To evaluate between-operator imprecision and between-site
reproducibility, five extracted stool samples at various concentrations of calprotectin
were tested for five days with two runs per day in four replicates per run at three sites
by two operators, allowing for a total of 240 fCAL ELISA test results per sample. The
mean fCAL ELISA test result was computed and the within-run, between-run,
between-day, between-operator, between-site, and total standard deviations (SD) and
associated coefficients of variation (%CV) were calculated.

international (SI) units cannot be established. The BÜHLMANN fCAL ELISA is
traceable to an internal standard generated from pooled human serum. The value of
the internal standard was initially assigned using a primary standard material made
from recombinant calprotectin. The final value of the internal standard value was
established over multiple runs and reagent lots of the BÜHLMANN fCAL ELISA.
Stability:
Real-time reagent stability: Three reagent lots and three stool extracts (one below 80
μg/g, one between 80 μg/g and 160 μg/g, and one above 160 μg/g) were used to
establish reagent stability. Reagents were stored at 2–8°C throughout the study. Stool
extracts were stored in accordance with the instructions for use. The results of the
study support the claim that BÜHLMANN fCAL ELISA reagents are stable for 24
months at 2–8°C.
Transport stability: Two reagent lots, two stool samples, and two levels of control
material were used. Reagents were stored at 28°C and 37°C to mimic temperature
conditions that may be experienced during shipping. Reagent/sample/control
combinations were tested in duplicates at baseline, and at seven days, 14 days, and 21
days post-baseline. The results of the study support the claim that BÜHLMANN
fCAL ELISA reagents are stable for 21 days at 28°C and five days at 37°C.
Open vial stability: Four reagent lots, four stool samples, and two levels of control
material were used. Reagents were opened and reconstituted prior to testing at
baseline, and stored at 2–8°C for use at two months and six months after the baseline
time point. The results of the study support the claim that BÜHLMANN fCAL
ELISA is stable for six months in open kit/in-use.
Analyte stability: Analyte stability was evaluated under the following storage
conditions of:
• raw stool specimens at 2–8°C
• stool extracts at -20°C and 2–8°C
• stool extracts post freeze/thaw cycles
The demonstrated stability duration is three days at 2–8°C for raw stool specimen,
three years at -20°C for stool extract, seven days at 2–8°C for stool extract, and three
freeze (-20°C) /thaw (room temperature) cycles.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB)
Four blank samples (incubation buffer spiked with extraction buffer) were tested over
a three-day period using two reagent lots, with five test determinations obtained from
each sample on each day using each reagent lot. The study design generated a total of
60 test determinations with each reagent lot and the LoB was estimated as the 95th
percentile of the distribution of test results using a non-parametric method. The LoB

--- Page 10 ---
value was determined to be 8.3 μg/g.
Limit of Detection (LoD)
Four specimen extracts with low levels of calprotectin, i.e., samples with
concentrations between one and five times of the estimated LoB, were tested over a
three-day period using two reagent lots, with five test determinations obtained from
each extract on each day using each reagent lot and the pooled standard deviation
(SDL) was computed as the weighted average of the standard deviations across the
four samples. The LoD for each reagent lot was then computed using the formula
LoD = LoB + Cp x SDL, where Cp is the 95th percentile of the standard normal
distribution, corrected for the use of the observed sample standard deviations. The
LoD value was determined to be 12.6 μg/g.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
Each extract of four specimen extracts was tested over a three-day period using two
reagent lots with five test determinations obtained from each extract on each day
using each reagent lot. The mean test result and associated coefficient of variation
(%CV) were computed for each specimen extract as tested with each reagent lot. The
LoQ value was determined to be 30.0 μg/g.
e. Analytical specificity:
A total of 19 potential interferents were investigated in this study, including six
microorganisms and 13 chemical interferents (e.g., oral pharmaceuticals and
nutritional supplements) with four samples with calprotectin concentrations at: near
30.0 μg/g, 100.0 μg/g, 200.0 μg/g, and 500.0 μg/g.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity/clinical specificity:
The study subject population consisted of 478 subjects including 415 adults (above
age 21) and 63 pediatric (age between 4 and 21) patients. Per standard clinical
practice, all patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of IBS or IBD,
including patients previously diagnosed with IBD and referred for endoscopic
investigation due to a suspected flare or routine exam, were enrolled and referred for
endoscopy. Each eligible study subject provided one stool sample for analysis using
the fCAL ELISA at least one day prior to any scheduled endoscopy procedure or no
more than three days after an endoscopy procedure. The final clinical diagnosis of
IBD, IBS, or other GI disorder was determined by the clinical investigator based on

the results of the endoscopy as well as other clinical findings, e.g. histology and
Rome III criteria. The final diagnoses of the subjects were as follows: 135 IBD (102
adult and 33 pediatric), 130 IBS (102 adult and 28 pediatric), and 72 other
gastrointestinal disorders other than IBD or IBS (70 adults and 2 pediatric). Thirteen
clinical sites in the U.S. enrolled and determined the final clinical diagnoses. The
fecal samples were tested with the BÜHLMANN fCAL ELISA in three clinical
laboratories.
