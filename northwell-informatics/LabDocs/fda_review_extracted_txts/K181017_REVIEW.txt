L. Test Principle:
The Free Testosterone AccuBind ELISA test system uses a competitive enzyme
immunoassay technology. The essential reagent includes an immobilized antibody, enzyme-
antigen conjugate and a native antigen. Upon mixing the immobilized antibody, enzyme-
antigen conjugate and a serum containing the free native antigen, a competitive reaction
results between the native free antigen and the enzyme-antigen conjugate for a limited
number of insolubilized binding sites. After equilibrium is attained, the antibody-coated
fraction is separated from unbound antigen by decantation or aspiration. By utilizing several
different serum references of known antigen concentration, a dose response curve can be
generated from which the antigen concentration of an unknown sample can be ascertained.
The serum calibrators are prepared in human serum matrix. The enzyme-antigen conjugate is
labelled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and the substrate reagent contains
tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), a blue color is produced. The reaction is stopped with addition
of an acid and a yellow color is developed. The plate is read in a microtiter plate reader at
450nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A study was performed by testing three levels of human serum pools and three levels
of control material using three reagent lots. The samples were tested in duplicate, two
times a day for a period of 20 days for a total of 80 measurements per sample. Each
of the three lots of reagents produced similar precision results. The precision results
from one representative lot are summarized in the table below:
Within-Run Total
Sample Mean (pg/mL) SD %CV SD %CV
Control 1 2.51 0.09 3.7% 0.20 7.8%
Control 2 10.98 0.40 3.6% 0.96 8.7%
Control 3 22.72 0.83 3.6% 2.18 9.6%
Serum 1 0.98 0.06 5.9% 0.12 12.4%
Serum 2 4.53 0.26 5.7% 0.36 8.0%
Serum 3 53.62 4.24 7.9% 4.32 8.1%
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A study was performed to evaluate the linearity of the Free Testosterone AccuBind
ELISA Test System. Test samples were prepared by performing serial dilutions of a
high human serum free testosterone pool with a low human serum free testosterone
pool. The ten free testosterone concentrations tested were as follows: 0.11, 6.58,
13.05, 19.52, 25.99, 32.46, 45.40, 51.87, 58.34, and 64.81 pg/mL.

The samples were tested in replicates of 4. The following linearity regression
equation was obtained:
y= 1.0149x – 0.6028, R2=0.9888
The results of the linearity study support a measuring range of 0.11 - 60 pg/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The test system is traceable to a certified reference material, Cerrlian testosterone, T-
037.
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP17 guideline.
A limit of blank (LoB) study was performed using three different blank samples that
were measured using 3 reagent lots over 6 days to yield 144 measurements. The LoB
was determined nonparametrically using the following equation:
[N (p/100)+0.5]=result at position [0.95*N =0.5]=P(1-α). The LoB was determined
B B
to be largest result of the 3 reagent lots, 0.0295 pg/mL.
The limit of detection (LoD) study was performed by obtaining 10 measurements of
10 low-level samples across 3 different reagent lots and 2 analyzers. LoD was
calculated using the following equation: LoD=LoB + Cv x SDs. The LoD was
determined to be 0.0519 pg/mL.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ): The test results from the LoD study were used to
calculate total error. The goal for the total error was set as 0.05 pg/mL. The TE was
lower than 0.05 pg/mL, therefore the sponsor claims that the LoQ is equal to the LoD,
0.0519 pg/mL.
Limit of Blank Limit of Detection Limit of Quantitation
0.0295 pg/mL 0.0519 pg/mL 0.0519 pg/mL
The sponsor’s claimed measuring range is 0.11 - 60 pg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
An interference study was performed following CLSI EP07-A2 guideline. Aliquots
from pools of human serum with a free testosterone concentration of 7.916 pg/mL and
38.5 pg/mL were spiked with potentially interfering substances at one or more
concentrations. The sponsor defines significant interference as > 10% bias.

evaluate whether various analytes or substances cross-react with the quantitation of
free testosterone using the device. Aliquots from a pool of human serum with a free
testosterone concentration of 7.408 pg/mL were spiked with substances at the
concentrations listed in the table below. Cross-reactivity was determined using the
following equation: (observed value - unspiked value)/ concentration of cross-
reactant x 100%. The sponsor defines significant cross-reactivity as > 10% difference.
