H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Solana Bordetella Complete Assay is an in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative
detection of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis nucleic acids isolated from
nasopharyngeal swab specimens obtained from patients suspected of having respiratory
tract infection attributable to Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis.
The Solana Bordetella Complete Assay is an HDA-based duplex assay that targets the
IS481 and IS1001 sequence of Bordetella pertussis (BP) and Bordetella parapertussis
(BPP) genomes, respectively. The IS481 sequence may also be found in strains of other
organisms (i.e., B. holmesii and B. bronchiseptica). The IS1001 sequence may also be
found in strains of other organisms (i.e., B. bronchiseptica). B. holmesii infection may
cause clinical illness similar to B. pertussis, and mixed outbreaks involving both B.
pertussis and B. holmesii infection have been reported. Additional testing should be
performed if necessary to differentiate B. holmesii and B. pertussis. B. bronchiseptica is a
rare cause of infection in humans. When clinical factors suggest that B. pertussis or B.
parapertussis may not be the cause of respiratory infection, other clinically appropriate
investigation(s) should be carried out in accordance with published guidelines.
Negative results for the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay do not preclude B. pertussis
or B. parapertussis infection and positive results do not rule out co-infection with other
respiratory pathogens. Results from the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay should be
used in conjunction with information obtained during the patient's clinical evaluation as
an aid in diagnosis of B. pertussis and or B. parapertussis infection and should not be
used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.

I. Device Description:
The Solana Bordetella Complete Assay amplifies, detects and differentiates DNA of Bordetella
pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis from nasopharyngeal swabs.
The assay consists of two major steps: 1) specimen preparation, and 2) amplification and
detection of target sequences specific to B. pertussis and B. parapertussis using isothermal
Helicase-Dependent Amplification (HDA) in the presence of target-specific fluorescence probes.
A patient nasopharyngeal swab specimen in transport media is transferred to a Process Buffer
Tube, subjected to heat treatment at 95°C for 5 minutes and mixed. The processed sample is
transferred to a Reaction Tube. The Reaction Tube contains lyophilized HDA reagents, dNTPs,
primers and probes. Once rehydrated with the processed sample, the Reaction Tube is placed in
Solana for amplification and detection of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis-specific target
sequences. In Solana, the target sequences are amplified by B. pertussis and B. parapertussis
specific primers and detected by B. pertussis and B. parapertussis-specific fluorescence probes,
respectively. A process control (PRC) is included in the Process Buffer Tube to monitor sample
processing, inhibitory substances in clinical samples, reagent failure or device failure. The PRC
target is amplified by specific primers and detected by a PRC specific fluorescence probe.
The two target probes and PRC probe are labeled with a quencher on one end and a fluorophore
on the other end. In addition, the two target probes and PRC probe have one or more bases that
are comprised of ribonucleic acid. Upon annealing to B. pertussis and B. parapertussis or PRC
amplicons, the fluorescence probes are cleaved by RNaseH2 and the fluorescence signal
increases due to physical separation of fluorophore from quencher. Solana measures and
interprets the fluorescent signal, using on-board method-specific algorithms. Solana then reports
the test results to the user on its display screen, and it can print out the results via an attached
printer.

A repeatability study was conducted using a panel of 30 contrived samples with
two (2) subsets of 15 samples, where operator 1 tested samples 1-15 and operator 2
tested samples 16-30. Each subset was manufactured as negative samples (n=3),
high negative samples containing BP and BPP (n=3; C – C concentration per
20 80
target), low positive samples containing BP or BPP (n=3; near the assay limit of
detection), and moderate positive samples containing BP and BPP (n=3; 2x LoD

A multi-center reproducibility study was conducted using two different four-sample
panel sets each consisting of three levels of combined B. pertussis (BP) and B.
parapertussis (BPP) (two (2) strains of each organism) contrived samples and a
negative contrived sample. Set 1 consisted of BP A639 and BPP A747, Set 2
consisted of BP E431 and BPP E838. Samples were diluted in negative nasal matrix
(UTM) to 2x LoD for moderate positive, 1x LoD for low positive and diluted to
concentrations below the LoD (i.e., C to C ) for high negative samples. Negative

nasal matrix without spiked organism was used for the negative sample. Positive and
negative controls were run in triplicate along with the panels.
Panels and controls were tested over five days at three testing sites by two (2)
operators per instrument for five (5) days with each sample tested in three (3)
replicates, for a total of 45 results per level for each organism strain (2 operators x 5
days x 3 sites x 3 replicates). Results are shown in Table 5 below.

The specimens were stored at three different storage conditions—≤ -70°C, 2°C to
8°C, 25°C ± 3°C. Testing indicated that specimens can be stored before processing at
2° to 8°C for up to 97 hours, up to 49 hours at 25°C, or up to 5-months at ≤ -70°C.
No significant difference in assay performance was seen between the four different
types of viral transport media, saline (0.85%), Tris EDTA, Molecular Grade Water, or
Amies.
Processed Specimen Stability
Contrived samples were prepared in negative nasal matrix with organism
concetnrations of 2x LOD for BP (Strain A639, 2050 CFU/mL) and 2x LOD for BPP
(Strain E838, 11066 CFU/mL). The stability of samples in Process Buffer at 2°C to
8°C and at 25°C ± 3°C before and after heat lysis was evaluated in this study. Three
(3) replicates were processed and tested before heat lysis and after heat lysis
conditions according to the instructions for use. The condition, before or after
heating, and testing time points for the corresponding samples in Process Buffer kept
at the evaluated temperatures are listed in Table 6 below.

Results from the study demonstrated that BP- and BPP-positive samples in Process
Buffer generated the expected positive results after storage at at 2°C to 8°C for 97
hours and at 25°C ± 3°C for 49 hours both before and after undergoing heat lysis.
Controls
Process Control
The process control is used to monitor sample processing, to detect HDA
inhibitory specimens, to confirm the integrity of assay reagents and the operation
of the Solana instrument. The process control is included in the Process Buffer
tube used for each specimen.
External Controls
Controls (Quidel Molecular Bordetella Control Set, which contains positive and
negative controls and serves as an external processing control) were run on the
Solana Bordetella Complete Assay each day of testing during the clinical study. A
total of 117 positive controls (BP-positive and BPP-positive) and 117 negative
controls (BP- and BPP-negative) were evaluated across five (5) clinical test sites.

All controls produced the expected results.
These controls are described as follows:
· The Quidel Molecular Bordetella external positive control may be treated
as a patient specimen. The control should be sampled and tested as if it
were a patient specimen and processed as described above in the Assay
Procedure. The external positive control is intended to monitor substantial
reagent and instrument failure.
· The Quidel Molecular Bordetella external negative control may be treated
as a patient specimen. The control should be sampled and tested as if it
were a patient specimen and processed as described above in the Assay
Procedure. The external negative control is used to detect reagent or
environmental contamination (or carry-over) by B. pertussis and B.
parapertussis DNA or amplicon.
It is recommended that the reactivity of each new lot and each new shipment of the
Solana Bordetella Complete Assay be verified on receipt and before use using the
Quidel Molecular Bordetella Control Set External control tests should be performed
thereafter in accordance with appropriate federal, state and local guidelines. The
Solana Bordetella Complete Assay should not be used in patient testing if the external
controls do not produce the correct results.
d. Limit of Detection
The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection or LoD) of the Solana Bordetella
Complete Assay was determined using quantified (CFU/mL) cultures of two (2) BP
strains (A639 and E431) and two (2) BPP strains (A747 and E838) serially diluted in
a negative nasal matrix. Results are presented in Table 7.

e. Inclusivity
The reactivity of the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay was evaluated against an
additional eight (8) Bordetella pertussis (BP) and eight (8) Bordetella parapertussis
(BPP) strains that were not used for LOD determination. The testing was performed
at 1x LOD (1025 CFU/mL and 5533 CFU/mL, respectively) level of the assay. All
additional sixteen (16) strains were detected in the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay
(Table 8).

To supplement inclusivity testing for each Solana Bordetella Complete assay target,
in-silico analysis was performed as an additional evaluation of Solana Bordetella BP
and BPP amplicon sequence for the predicted detection of microorganism strains.
f. Analytical Specificity:
Cross-Reactivity
Based on in-silico analysis, B. holmesii and B. bronchiseptica genomes are expected
to share complete or nearly complete sequence identity with the BP amplicon because
both contain the IS481 sequence. Therefore, these organisms are expected to cross-
react with the Solana Bordetella Assay. Other microorganisms are not expected to
cause cross-reactivity because their sequence alignment with the BP amplicon shows
multiple mismatches in the primer and probe binding regions. It is also be noted that

no Bordetella parapertussis sequences were retrieved from the blastn search,
suggesting that there is little to no sequence identity shared between B. parapertussis
and the BP amplicon. Therefore, the BP primers are not expected to amplify any BPP
sequences.
Furthermore, based on in-silico analysis, the B. bronchiseptica genome is expected to
share complete or nearly complete sequence identity with the BPP amplicon because
it contains the IS1001 sequence. Therefore, it is expected to cross-react with the
Solana Bordetella Assay. Other microorganisms are not expected to cause cross-
reactivity because their sequence alignment with the BPP amplicon shows multiple
mismatches in the primer and probe binding regions, which are not likely to promote
BPP primer or probe binding. It is also be noted that no Bordetella pertussis
sequences were retrieved from the blastn search, suggesting that there is little to no
sequence identity shared between BP and the BPP amplicon. Therefore, the BPP
primers are not expected to amplify any BP sequences.
A study was performed to determine if eighty-three (83) microorganisms or viruses
likely to be present in nasopharyngeal swabs cross-react with the Solana Bordetella
Complete Assay. The microorganisms (Table 9, 10, 11) were tested above clinically
relevant levels (bacteria/yeast ≥ 1x106 CFU/mL, viruses 1x105TCID50/mL).
Five (5) non-BP organism strains tested positive for BP for all three (3) replicates.
The five organisms include 4 of 4 Bordetella holmesii strains (ZeptoMetrix F061,
ATCC 51541, ATCC 700053, and ATCC 700052) and 1 of 8 Bordetella
bronchiseptica strains (ATCC 4617). Cross-reactivity with these organisms is
expected due to the presence of the BP target sequence, IS481, in the genomes of
these organisms.
None of the potentially cross-reactive organisms tested positive for BPP.
High levels of BP did not generate any BPP-positive results, and high levels of
BPP did not generate any BP-positive results demonstrating no cross-reactivity
between the two organism targets.

Microbial Interference
A study was performed to determine if eighty-three (83) microorganisms or viruses
likely to be present in nasopharyngeal specimens interfere with detection of the
Bordetella pertussis (BP) or Bordetella parapertussis (BPP) with the Solana
Bordetella Complete Assay. Samples were prepared with one BP strain (A639) and
one BPP strain (E838) at 2x LoD (2050 CFU/mL and 11066 CFU/mL,
respectively) combined with each potentially interfering microorganism. The
potentially interfering microorganisms (Table 9, 10, 11) were tested above
clinically relevant levels (bacteria/yeast ≥ 1x106 CFU/mL, viruses 1x105
TCID50/mL).
None (0) of the organisms or viruses tested above interfered with the performance
of the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay for detection of BP or BPP.
High levels of BP A639 did not cause interference with BPP E838 detection, and
high levels of BPP E838 did not cause interference with BP A639 detection.
Interfering Substances
The performance of Solana Bordetella Complete Assay was evaluated with sixteen
(16) potentially interfering substances that may be present in nasopharygeal
specimens collected to test for Bordetella pertussis (BP) and Bordetella
parapertussis (BPP) infection. The substances listed in Table 12 were diluted in
negative nasal matrix and tested in the absence or presence of 2x LOD BP (Strain
A639 2050 CFU/mL) and 2x LOD BPP (Strain E838 11066 CFU/mL) in the
Solana Bordetella Complete Assay.

results for 3 of 3 replicates. Based on these results, the 16 substances tested in this
study are considered to not interfere with the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay.
g. Carry-over/Cross-contamination
A study was conducted to evaluated the potential for carry-over or cross-contamination
for the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay. For the study two (2) samples were prepared:
a Bordetella pertussis (BP) positive sample and a BP negative sample. The positive
sample was prepared by adding cells of one BP strain with a known titer to negative nasal
matrix at the concentration of 1.0 x 106 CFU/mL. The negative nasal matrix served as the
BP negative sample. In each experiment, the positive samples were alternated with the
negative samples and tested using Solana Bordetella Complete Assay to assess the risk of
cross contamination. In total, two (2) operators tested a total of 30 positive and 30

negative samples over a total of five (5) runs. All positive BP samples tested positive and
all negative BP samples tested negative. No evidence of carry-over/cross contamination
was observed with the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay when performed in accordance
with the package insert.
h. Fresh versus frozen study
A study was performed to demonstrate equivalency between fresh and frozen
specimens. Two (2) BP strains (A639 394 and E431) and two (2) BPP strains (A747
and E838) were serially diluted in a negative nasal matrix at varying concentrations
above and below the assay LOD. The dilutions were tested fresh and then after
freezing at -70°C. The dilutions demonstrating at least 95% detection (≥19 of 20)
were thawed and re-tested. For all four (4) organism strains tested, the fresh and
frozen results matched at LOD concentrations indicating equivalence between fresh
and frozen samples when tested with the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay.
i. Assay cut-off:
The preliminary baseline, cut-off, and threshold settings were determined for the
Solana Bordetella Complete Assay on the Solana instrument during development.
The settings were based on the analysis of negative clinical specimens (these
specimens were not part of the clinical study), as well as analysis of contrived
specimens for the Limit of Detection Study. The baseline, threshold, and cut-off
settings were established and used during the clinical trial.

3. Clinical studies:
A multi-center study was conducted to evaluate the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay
using nasopharyngeal swab specimens obtained from patients suspected of having
respiratory tract infection attributable to Bordetella pertussis or Bordetella parapertussis.
The study was performed from October, 2017 to January, 2018 at one (1) internal and
four (4) external sites in the United States. Specimens were collected using either Copan
NP flocked swab or rayon swab at the various test sites, and both swab types were used
for each site’s test of record Bordetella testing. The study collected seven hundred forty-
18

one (741) fresh specimens at four (4) sites, and two hundred thirty-three (233) frozen
archival specimens at four (4) sites.
Specimen collection followed the FDA guidance entitled “Guidance on Informed
Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that
are Not Individually Identifiable”. The gender and age demographics for each category
are listed below.

Testing with contiguous fresh nasopharyngeal swabs on the Solana device was performed
at four (4) laboratories. Specimens were eluted into the following sample buffers during
the clinical studies: Remel M6 (n=236 or 31.8%), UTM (n=226 or 30.5%), Tris EDTA
(n=175 or 23.6%), and Molecular Grade Water (n=104 or 14.0%). An aliquot from each
buffer was frozen and shipped on dry ice to the central laboratory for testing with
comparator reference assays.
Clinical performance was based on comparison of the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay
results to those obtained by a composite reference method that included two (2)
manufacturer validated, IS481-targeted real-time PCR assays and bi-directional
sequencing. The PCR assay protocols included 37 amplification cycles.
a. Prospective clinical study
Seven hundred forty-one (741) fresh nasopharyngeal swab specimens, obtained
from female and male patients suspected of having respiratory tract infection
attributable to Bordetella pertussis or Bordetella parapertussis, were prospectively
collected and transported to each laboratory for testing with the Solana Bordetella
Complete Assay. Four (4) specimens (0.5%) were invalid (in both the initial and
repeat test) and have been removed from further analysis. The tables below present
the data for the remaining seven hundred thirty-seven (737) specimens.

b. Retrospective Clinical Study, Archived Specimens
Two hundred thirty-three (233) selected frozen archival specimens were collected
at four (4) sites. The frozen archival nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained
from female and male patients previously tested for the presence of Bordetella
pertussis or Bordetella parapertussis. The specimens were tested with the Solana
Bordetella Complete Assay and the Composite Reference Method. Archival
specimens were eluted into the following sample buffers: Amies (eSwab) (n=17 or
7.3%), UTM (n=102 or 43.8%), Remel M6 (n=48 or 20.6%), 0.85% Saline (n=10
or 4.3%) and Molecular Grade Water (n=56 or 24.0%). An aliquot from each
specimen was re-frozen and shipped on dry ice to the central laboratory for testing
with comparator assays. The testing with the comparator assays was performed
concurrently and in a blinded fashion. The tables below present the data for the
specimens.
