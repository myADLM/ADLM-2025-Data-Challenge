2. Indications for Use:
The StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter System is intended for point-of-care, in vitro
diagnostic, multiple-patient use for the quantitative determination of glucose in capillary
finger stick, venous whole blood, arterial whole blood, neonate arterial whole blood and
neonate heel stick specimens throughout all hospital and all professional healthcare
settings including patients receiving intensive medical intervention/therapy.
The system should only be used with single-use, auto-disabling lancing devices when
performing a capillary finger stick or neonate heel stick. It is not intended for use with
neonate cord blood specimens. It is not intended for the screening or diagnosis of
diabetes mellitus but is indicated for use in determining dysglycemia.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
- For prescription use only
- For in vitro diagnostic use only
- The system has not been evaluated for use with neonate venous blood.
- Temperature and humidity extremes - Test results may be inaccurate when test
strips are stored outside of the storage and handling conditions.
- Altitudes above 15,000 feet (4500 meters) above sea level have not been evaluated.
- Specimens - Only fresh whole blood or whole blood collected in lithium heparin
collection devices should be used for arterial and venous specimens.
- Fluoride, EDTA, Sodium, and Ammonium blood collection devices should not be
used.
- Use only whole blood. Do not use serum or plasma.
- Should only be used with single-use, auto-disabling lancing devices
- Caution should be exercised when testing capillary whole blood due to potential
pre-analytical variability in capillary specimen collection.
- A capillary whole blood specimen relies upon an adequate, non-compromised
capillary blood flow. The healthcare provider must be aware that a capillary whole
blood specimen glucose result may not always be the same as an arterial or a
venous whole blood glucose result, especially when the patient’s condition is
rapidly changing.
- If a capillary whole blood glucose result is not consistent with a patient’s clinical
signs and symptoms, glucose testing should be repeated with either an arterial or
venous specimen on the StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter System.

L. Test Principle:
The Nova StatStrip Hospital Meter System is based on electrochemical biosensor technology
and the principle of capillary action. The system quantitatively measures blood glucose levels
using glucose oxidase enzyme chemistry. The electrons generated during this reaction are
transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a
readout displayed on the meter.

Performance for venous and arterial, neonatal heelsticks and neonatal arterial samples
from patients throughout the hospital was established in k132121.
In this submission, additional comparison studies were performed using fingerstick
capillary samples at three hospital sites as follows:
Study 1
For Study 1, 568 capillary whole blood fingerstick specimens were obtained from
patients within three different critical care units including the cardiovascular intensive
care unit (CVICU), medical intensive care unit (MICU), and the operating room
(OR). This study included 80 unique patient conditions receiving a total of 3,785
medications representing 17 parent drug classes. All testing with the StatStrip Blood
Glucose Hospital Meter (StatStrip Meter) was performed by CLIA waived operators
(non-laboratory personnel, typically nursing staff) within each of these three critical
care settings. Capillary whole blood glucose results on the StatStrip Meter were
compared to matched arterial or venous plasma results obtained on a comparator
method, the Roche Cobas Modular P800 Hexokinase System, located in a central
laboratory. The glucose ranges of the samples, according to the comparator method,
ranged from 74 mg/dL to 379 mg/dL glucose. The results from the capillary
fingerstick samples obtained from the StatStrip Hospital Meter compared to the
results from the comparator method are summarized below:

Study 2
Over 16,000 paired critical care capillary glucose specimens were retrospectively
identified and met the following criteria:
Within critical care departments, a capillary fingerstick specimen, and a
venous/arterial glucose result were measured at the bedside by a CLIA Waived
operator using the BGMS.
Subsequently a plasma glucose test was performed on the same subject on the
central laboratory hexokinase method within 15 minutes.

5. Calibration:
The meter does not require the user to input a test strip code or perform any other
calibration.
6. Quality Control:
Three levels of aqueous ready to use glucose control solutions are available with this
system (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3). Control solution testing can be performed by
pushing the QC key, entering (or scanning) the test strip lot number. Recommendations
on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for
each control level is printed on the vial label of the control being used.

materials of the modified StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter after 10,950 cleaning and
disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting wipe)
using the Clorox Germicidal Wipes to simulate 3 years of device use. Labeling was
reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

7) Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Devices Panel:
A FDA meeting of the Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Panel was held on
March 30th, 3018, to discuss the benefits and risks of measuring capillary blood using
blood glucose meters in patients receiving intensive medical intervention/therapy. The
data from the 2 studies above using the Nova StatStrip meter were part of the data
presented to the panel. The panel concluded that with respect to the performance data
generated in the studies presented during the panel, the benefits outweigh the risk in this
patient population receiving intensive medical intervention/therapy.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirement of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
