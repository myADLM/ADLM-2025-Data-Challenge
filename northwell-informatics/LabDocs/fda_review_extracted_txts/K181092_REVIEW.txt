H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
CHROMID CARBA agar is a selective and differential chromogenic medium that is
intended for the qualitative detection and presumptive identification of carbapenemase-
producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in rectal swab specimens from
patients at risk of colonization. CHROMID CARBA agar is intended as an aid in the
detection, identification of colonization and control of these bacteria in a healthcare
setting.
Rectal swabs are inoculated directly onto CHROMID CARBA agar without enrichment
and results can be interpreted after incubation for 18-24 hours. Presumptive
carbapenemase-producing colonies of E. coli appear pink to burgundy and those of K.
pneumoniae appear blue-green or blue-grey.
Other organisms besides carbapenemase-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae can also
grow on CHROMID CARBA agar with colonies that appear pink to burgundy or blue-
green to blue-grey. Sub-culture to non-selective medium is required to confirm organism
identity, for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, confirmation of carbapenemase
production and epidemiological typing.
A lack of growth or the absence of pink to burgundy or blue-green to blue-grey colonies
does not preclude the carriage of carbapenemase producing organisms.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
A lack of growth or the absence of pink-burgundy or blue-green/blue-grey colonies does
not preclude the carriage of carbapenemase producing organisms.
Based on analytical studies, high concentrations (≥108 CFU/mL) of carbapenemase-
producing E. cloacae, M. morganii and P. aeruginosa may inhibit or mask the growth of
low levels of carbapenemase-producing E. coli. In addition, high concentrations (≥108
CFU/mL) of carbapenemase-producing E. coli and M. morganii may inhibit or mask the
growth of low levels of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae.
Additional testing by an alternative method (e.g., enrichment broth culture) is
required if a negative result is obtained with CHROMID CARBA agar and carriage
of carbapenemase-producing E. coli or K. pneumoniae is suspected.
Performance of CHROMID CARBA agar was established for carbapenemase-producing
E. coli and K. pneumoniae that carry K. pneumoniae Carbapenemase (KPC).
2

--- Page 3 ---
Performance with Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) other than E.
coli and K. pneumoniae and other types of carbapenemase enzyme has not been
established.
Organisms producing the following non-KPC carbapenemase enzymes may grow
and produce pink to burgundy or blue-green to blue-grey pigmented colonies after
18 to 24 hours on CHROMID CARBA agar: IMP, NDM, OXA-48, SME and VIM.
Some carbapenem non-susceptible organisms that do not produce carbapenemase but
which exhibit other resistance mechanisms may grow on CHROMID CARBA agar and
produce blue-green to blue-grey or pink to burgundy pigmented colonies after 18 to 24
hours.
Sub-culture to non-selective medium is required to for organism identification,
antimicrobial susceptibility testing and confirmation of carbapenemase production.
4. Special instrument requirements:
None
I. Device Description:
CHROMID CARBA agar is a selective and differential culture medium that contains a
combination of antimicrobial agents and chromogenic substrates. The medium is intended for
use in screening of rectal swab specimens for the presence of carbapenemase-producing E.
coli and K. pneumoniae. Presumptive carbapenemase-producing colonies of E. coli appear
pink-burgundy whereas those of K. pneumoniae appear blue-green/blue-grey.
All isolates must be sub-cultured for identification, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and
confirmation of carbapenemase production, as well as epidemiological typing (if required).

L. Test Principle:
CHROMID CARBA agar consists of nutritive medium containing peptones and a mixture of
antimicrobial agents that select for growth of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae
(CPE), and chromogenic substrates that enable presumptive identification of the most
common carbapenemase-producing species. Colonies of carbapenemase-producing E. coli
appear pink-burgundy due to the production of b-glucuronidase or b-galactosidase, while
colonies of K. pneumoniae produce b-glucosidase and appear blue-green/blue-grey. The
performance of CHROMID CARBA agar was established with strains of E coli and K.
pneumoniae that produce K. pneumoniae Carbapenemase (KPC). Performance with other
species or other types of carbapenemase has not been evaluated.
Testing is performed by direct inoculation of a rectal swab onto the surface of culture
medium. The plates are incubated for 18-24 hours at 35±2°C in an aerobic atmosphere. All
presumptive isolates of carbapenemase-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae must be sub-
cultured for identification, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and confirmation of
carbapenemase production according to established methods.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of results obtained with CHROMID CARBA agar was evaluated in a
study conducted at three sites using blinded panels of samples comprised of 10 confirmed
KPC-positive, carbapenem non-susceptible strains of E. coli (4) and K. pneumoniae (6).
The samples were prepared in saline at approximately the Limit of Detection (LoD)
(Section M(1)(d)) and tested in triplicate on each of five days. Testing of bacterial
suspensions in saline was deemed acceptable because the LoD was shown to be similar
with organisms suspended in saline and rectal swab matrix (Section M(2)(b)). On each
day at each site, one operator prepared three independent suspensions of each strain and
used these to inoculate duplicate CHROMID CARBA agar plates (50µL per plate) that
were then incubated for 24 hours and read independently by two different operators (3
sites x 5 days x 3 suspensions x 1 plate x 2 operators = 90 results per strain). A summary
of the results of the study is presented in Table 1. The day-to-day, site-to-site, operator-
to-operator and overall reproducibility of the CHROMID CARBA agar was determined
to be acceptable.

Quality Control
Quality Control (QC) testing must be performed in accordance with applicable local,
state and/or federal regulations or accreditation requirements and the testing
laboratory’s internal procedures. Recommended strains for use as Positive and
Negative External Controls are included in the device labeling.
QC was performed on each day of testing during the Clinical Studies (Prospective,
Contrived and Challenge) described in Section M(3)(a) by preparing a 1:100 dilution
of a 0.5 McFarland suspension of each recommended QC strain, streaking for
isolation using a 10µL loop and incubating for 18-24 hours at 35±2°C. A summary of
the results from QC testing at the four external sites involved in the Clinical Studies is
shown in Table 2.

Reagent Stability
CHROMID CARBA agar should be stored at 2-8°C until the expiration date shown
on the outer packaging.
Specimen Stability
Rectal swab specimens should be collected using the Copan Liquid Amies Elution
(Eswab) Collection and Transport System (K061301), or equivalent, and may be
stored for up to 24 hours at 2-8°C prior to culture on CHROMID CARBA agar.
Performance with other specimen collection and transport devices has not been
demonstrated.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection
The analytical sensitivity of CHROMID CARBA agar was determined for one strain
each of KPC-producing E. coli (ATCC BAA-2340) and K. pneumoniae (ATCC
BAA-1705). To estimate the Limit of Detection (LoD), a standardized 0.5 McFarland
suspension of each strain was prepared and diluted in simulated rectal swab matrix
(stool in saline solution) prior to plating on CHROMID CARBA agar (50µL per
plate). Trypticase Soy Agar (TSA) was also inoculated in parallel as a growth control.
All the plates were incubated for 18-24 hours at 35±2°C and the LoD was estimated
as the lowest concentration at which ≥10 CFU exhibiting the expected colony color
were obtained on each CHROMID CARBA agar plate. The estimated LoD for each
strain was 1.5 x 103 CFU/mL and this value was confirmed by observation of
appropriate colony counts on three additional plates that were inoculated at the LoD
target level.
Analytical Reactivity/Inclusivity
A study was performed using a panel of well-characterized isolates to evaluate the
ability of CHROMID CARBA agar to recover carbapenemase-producing strains of E.
coli and K. pneumoniae. Strains were characterized as carbapenemase producing
based the presence of bla and non-susceptibility to at least one carbapenem
KPC
(ertapenem, imipenem or meropenem). Included in the panel were strains with known
bla variants: KPC-2 (7), KPC-3 (3), KPC-4 (1).

on CHROMID CARBA agar with the expected pink-burgundy colony color and all
were carbapenem non-susceptible. Of the two strains that failed to grow, one (KPC-4)
had an MIC in the susceptible range for ertapenem and was intermediate for
imipenem and meropenem, and the other was susceptible to all three carbapenems
and its failure to grow on CHROMID CARBA agar was therefore expected.
All (100%) of 41 bla -positive, carbapenem non-susceptible strains of K.
KPC
pneumoniae grew on CHROMID CARBA agar with the expected blue-green/blue-
grey colony color.
These results are acceptable. The absence of data to demonstrate reliable detection of
carbapenemase-producing strains of E. coli and K. pneumoniae that carry other types
of carbapenemase enzyme besides KPC is noted in the Intended Use and as a
Limitation in the device labeling.
Incubation Time
A study was performed to evaluate the effect of incubation time on the ability to
recover KPC carbapenemase-producing strains of E. coli and K. pneumoniae on
CHROMID CARBA agar. Ten bla -positive, carbapenemase non-susceptible
KPC
strains were included in the study (four (4) E. coli and six (6) K. pneumoniae). Each
strain was diluted in saline to 4.5 x 103 CFU/mL (3X LoD) and inoculated onto
CHROMID CARBA agar (50µL per plate). The plates were incubated aerobically at
35±2°C. Colonies were counted and their color noted after 16 hours and every two (2)
hours thereafter up to 28 hours. Colony counts remained stable over the course of the
study and each of the strains exhibited their characteristic colony color. The results of
this study support the ability to recover carbapenemase-producing E. coli and K.
pneumoniae on CHROMID CARBA agar after incubation for 18-24 hours as
stipulated in the device labeling.
e. Analytical specificity:
A study was performed to evaluate the analytical specificity of CHROMID CARBA
agar for carbapenemase-producing strains of E. coli and K. pneumoniae by
inoculating the medium with high concentrations of target and non-target organisms
that may be present in stool specimens. Included in the study were CPE other than E.
coli and K. pneumoniae as well as strains of these two species that produce other
carbapenemases besides KPC type enzyme. Fifty microliters of a 0.5 McFarland
suspension of each non-target organism (approximately 1-2 x 108 CFU/mL for
bacteria and 1-5 x 106 CFU/mL for yeast) was used to inoculate each plate of
CHROMID CARBA agar. The plates were incubated for 18-24 hours at 35±2°C in
aerobic conditions after which the presence/absence of growth was recorded together
with the characteristics of any colonies present. A list of the organisms tested and the
associated results is shown in Table 3.

Of the 59 organisms tested, 20 grew of CHROMID CARBA agar after 18-24 hours.
Of these, four (4) non-lactose fermenting species (A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, P.
putida and S. maltophilia) exhibited colorless colonies that could readily be
distinguished from the characteristic pink-burgundy and blue-green/blue-grey
colonies of carbapenemase-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Three (3) of these
strains were known to harbor a carbapenem resistance marker (bla or bla ).

The remaining 16 organisms that grew on CHROMID CARBA agar included three
(3) strains of E. coli (pink-burgundy colonies) and four (4) strains of K. pneumoniae
(blue-green/blue-grey colonies), all of which carried a carbapenemase resistance
marker other than bla (bla , bla , bla or bla ) and were

phenotypically carbapenem non-susceptible. In addition, there were nine (9) other
strains of Enterobacteriaceae (C. freundii (3), M. morganii (2), K. aerogenes [E.
aerogenes] (1), E. cloacae (1), P. rettgerii (1) and S. marcescens (1)) that exhibited
blue-green/blue-grey colonies and which carried a carbapenemase gene (bla ,
KPC
bla or bla ), eight (8) of which were non-susceptible to carbapenems.
NDM SME
The results of the Analytical Specificity Study demonstrate that E. coli and K.
pneumoniae with carbapenemases other than KPC-type carbapenemase may exhibit
pink-burgundy or blue-green/blue-grey colonies on CHROMID CARBA agar,
although performance with such isolates has not been established. Similarly, CPE
other than E. coli and K. pneumoniae may also grow on CHROMID CARBA agar

Microbial Interference
A study was conducted to evaluate the ability to recover the targeted carbapenemase-
producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae in the presence of other carbapenem susceptible
and non-susceptible organisms. Testing was performed by plating four (4)
representative KPC-producing target organisms at low levels (3X LoD) in the
presence of 104-108CFU/mLof seven (7) carbapenem non-susceptible competitor
organisms that exhibited different resistance mechanisms. In addition, one (1)
carbapenem susceptible strain of K. pneumoniae was also included as a competitor
and each competitor strain was also inoculated onto CHROMID CARBA agar in the
absence of the target species in order evaluate its growth characteristics.
As observed in the Analytical Specificity Study (Section M(1)(e)), both
carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter cloacae and Providencia rettgeri exhibited
blue-green colonies on CHROMID CARBA agar, while carbapenemase-producing
M. morganii and P. aeruginosa produced blue and colorless colonies, respectively. In
all cases, when the competitive species was present at <108 CFU/mL, colonies of the
target organisms grew with the characteristic color (either pink-burgundy for E. coli
or blue-green/blue-grey for K. pneumoniae). However, when the competitive species
were present at 108 CFU/mL, in some cases, characteristic colonies of the target
organisms were not observed, either due to no growth or the inability to discern the
characteristic colored colonies of the target species from colonies of the competing
organism (i.e., masking) (Table 4). The potential for high concentrations of
carbapenemase-producing non-target organisms to interfere with recovery of
carbapenemase-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae is noted as a Limitation in the
device labeling.

Interfering Substances
In addition to investigating the potential for microbial interference, a study was also
conducted to evaluate the potential for interference with growth on CHROMID
CARBA agar from endogenous and exogenous substances that may be present in
rectal swab specimens. Testing was performed with each substance in the presence of
two (2) representative carbapenemase-producing target organisms: E. coli strain
ATCC BAA-2340 and K. pneumoniae ATCC BAA-1705 (both bla -positive). Each
KPC
target organism was tested at the LoD target level (1.5 x 103 CFU/mL) in the presence
of 22 potentially interfering substances at the highest concentration likely to be
encountered in a clinical specimen. The number of colonies of characteristic
appearance obtained on CHROMID CARBA agar was compared to the number
obtained on MacConkey agar that was inoculated in parallel. For there to be no
evidence of interference, the number of colonies present on the CHROMID CARBA
agar after incubation for 18-24 hours had to equal or exceed the number observed on
the MacConkey agar. No interference on CHROMID CARBA agar was observed in
the presence of any of the substances tested (Table 5). These results are acceptable.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
A study was conducted to compare the analytical sensitivity of CHROMID CARBA
agar for the recovery of carbapenemase-producing strains of E. coli and K.
pneumoniae from simulated rectal swab matrix (stool diluted in saline) and saline
solution alone. Testing was performed by diluting standardized suspensions of E. coli
ATCC BAA-2340 and K. pneumoniae ATCC BAA-1705 (both bla -positive) in the
KPC
appropriate matrix to different concentrations close to the claimed LoD of
CHROMID CARBA agar. Each suspension was used to inoculate multiple
CHROMID CARBA agar plates that were incubated for 18-24 hours at 35±2°C, after
which colonies exhibiting the characteristic pink-burgundy of E. coli or blue-
green/blue-grey of K. pneumoniae were counted. The mean colony count was
calculated using data form all inoculated plates. Similar colony counts were obtained
with suspensions prepared in saline or simulated rectal swab matrix (Table 6). Use of
organisms diluted in saline for selected Analytical Studies was therefore deemed
acceptable.

Study that was performed at three sites (two US and one ex-US). Recovery of
presumptive carbapenemase-producing colonies of E. coli and K. pneumoniae from
rectal swabs on CHROMID CARBA agar was compared to enrichment broth
Reference Culture, followed by subculture to MacConkey agar and phenotypic and
genetic characterization of isolated lactose fermenting colonies. Isolates of E. coli and
K. pneumoniae obtained by the Reference Culture method and on CHROMID
CARBA agar were identified biochemically and tested for susceptibility to
ertapenem, imipenem and meropenem using an FDA-cleared method. In addition,
each isolate was also evaluated for carbapenem susceptibility using an FDA-cleared
Carba NP test 1 and for the presence of carbapenemase resistance markers (bla ,
IMP
bla , bla , bla and bla ) using a validated multiplex PCR assay. Isolates
KPC NDM OXA-48 VIM
were defined as carbapenemase-producing using the composite algorithm depicted in
Table 7.

A total of 1099 residual rectal swab specimens from unique individuals that were
leftover following standard of care testing were initially enrolled in the study. All the
specimens were collected using ESwabs (flocked swab in liquid Amies transport
medium). Three hundred and ninety (390) specimens were excluded from the analysis
of performance for the following reasons: Quality Control failure with either the
Reference Culture (318) or both the Reference Culture and the CHROMID CARBA
agar (25); missing data (42); delay in data entry resulting in questionable data
reliability (5). Isolates from a total of 709 rectal swabs specimens were therefore
included in the analysis of performance. The results of the Prospective Clinical Study
are summarized in Tables 8 (a) & (b) and 9.
Reference Culture yielded no Carbapenemase Status positive strains of E. coli over
the course of the study, precluding estimation of Positive Percent Agreement (PPA),

although the Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) was 99.7% (95% confidence
interval: 99.0-99.9%).
For Carbapenemase Status-positive K. pneumoniae, PPA was 84.3% (95% CI 72.0-
91.8%) and NPA was 97.7% (95% CI 96.3-98.6%). All the specimens from which
Carbapenemase Status-positive K. pneumoniae was recovered by Reference Culture
were obtained from the ex-US clinical site (Table 9). Each of the strains of K.
pneumoniae that was recovered by Reference Culture but which failed to grow when
the rectal swabs were inoculated directly on CHROMID CARBA agar during the
prospective study was shown to grow with the characteristic blue-green/blue-grey
colony color when tested analytically in stool matrix at the LoD target level (Section
M(1)(d)). Failure to recover these strains on CHROMID CARBA agar directly from
rectal swabs in the prospective study may have been due to their presence at levels
below the LoD of the device. A lack of growth on CHROMID CARBA agar or the
absence of pink to burgundy or blue-green to blue-grey colonies does not preclude the
carriage of carbapenemase producing organisms. This is noted in the device labeling.

Because of the anticipated low prevalence of Carbapenemase Status-positive
specimens in the Prospective Clinical Study, additional testing was also performed
with contrived specimens. These were prepared by spiking simulated rectal swab
matrix (stool diluted in saline) with isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and other
Enterobacteriaceae of known Carbapenemase Status as defined using the algorithm
depicted in Table 7. A summary of the isolates tested is shown in Table 10. Each
contrived specimen was spiked with a unique bacterial strain at a concentration
equivalent to 1-10X the analytical LoD of the CHROMID CARBA agar (Section
M(1)(d)). Testing was performed in a blinded fashion at four different sites. A
summary of the results obtained on CHROMID CARBA agar in comparison to the
expected organism identity and Carbapenemase Status is provided in Tables 11 (a) &
(b).
