I. Device Description:
The Panther Fusion GBS Assay is a single use real-time PCR test for the qualitative detection
of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) DNA from a vaginal/rectal swab specimen following 18-24
hours incubation in selective enrichment broth culture (Lim Broth and Carrot Broth). The
Panther Fusion GBS Assay involves the following steps: Sample lysis, nucleic acid capture
and elution, and multiplex real-time-PCR where analytes (when present) are simultaneously
amplified, detected and differentiated. Nucleic acid capture and elution takes place in a single
tube. The eluate is transferred to a reaction tube containing the assay reagents. Real-time
PCR is then performed for the eluted nucleic acid on the Panther Fusion system.

L. Test Principle:
The Panther Fusion GBS Assay is a single use real-time PCR test. The assay is performed on
the automated Panther Fusion system which includes DNA extraction, target amplification
and detection of targets from enrichment broth. The PCR reagents are packaged as ready to
use lyophilized reagents in cartridges that can be loaded onto the Panther Fusion system.
Sample Collection and Enrichment: Prior to testing on the Panther Fusion system, enriched
specimens are transferred to a tube containing specimen transport media that lyses the cells,
releases target nucleic acids, and protects them from degradation during storage.
Nucleic Acid Capture and Elution: Magnetic particles contained in Panther Fusion Capture
Reagent mediate the nucleic acid capture by hybridizing to total nucleic acid in the test
specimen. The capture nucleic acids are then separated from residual specimen matrix in a
magnetic field by a series of wash steps with a mild detergent. The captured nucleic acid is
then eluted from the magnetic particles with a Panther Fusion Elution Buffer.
Elution Transfer and PCR: Eluted nucleic acid is transferred to a Panther Fusion Reaction
tube containing reconstituted mastermix. PCR-based target amplification subsequently
occurs with target-specific forward and reverse primers, generating a fluorescence signal.
Each PCR test includes two sets of primers and probes for the amplification and detection of
GBS DNA target sequences. An Internal Control (IC), which serves as a control for
monitoring the entire testing process including DNA extraction, amplification and detection
is included in each test. Positive and negative run controls are also provided as part of the
assay kit.
The Panther Fusion system is configured to require that assay controls run at an
administrator-specified interval up to 30 days. Software on the Panther Fusion system alerts
the operator when assay controls are required and does not start new tests until the assay
controls are loaded and have started processing. During processing, criteria for acceptance of
the assay controls are automatically verified by the Panther Fusion system. If any one of the
assay controls fails the validity checks, the Panther Fusion system automatically invalidates
the affected samples and requires a new set of assay controls be tested prior to starting any
new samples.
Results Interpretation: The Panther Fusion GBS Software computes a cycle threshold
result (Ct) to qualitatively determine the presence of the analyte and compares the
fluorescence signal to a predetermined cut-off to produce a qualitative result for the presence
or absence of the analytes. The analyte targets and corresponding fluorescent channels used
in the Panther Fusion GBS Assay are summarized in Table 2 below.

Target amplification takes place on the Panther Fusion thermocycler with concurrent real-
time fluorescent detection. The results are displayed on the screen at the end of the assay,
which can be printed, transferred, and stored by the end user (Table 3).

Precision Study
A Precision Study was conducted with a seven-member panel to evaluate the within-
site variability over 12 days with three different reagent lots on one Panther Fusion
system. Panel members were tested in triplicate on five separate runs per day. Three
different GBS strains (serotype III, serotype V, and a non-hemolytic) were used to
prepare panel members, which included true negative, low positive (1-2X LoD), and
moderate positive (3X LoD) samples. Panel members were prepared in Lim Broth
matrix spiked with GBS. For each run, a positive and negative external control were
processed in addition to the panel samples. A total of 1260 samples were prepared for
the study, where 180 samples per panel member were tested. The percent agreement
with the expected result for each low positive, moderate positive, and true negative
panel member was >95% as shown in Table 4. Table 5 shows a summary of the
coefficient of variation (%CV) and standard deviation (SD) for Ct values. All values
met the acceptance criteria for the study.

Reproducibility
The reproducibility of the Panther Fusion GBS Assay was evaluated by testing the
assay on three Panther Fusion instruments with two operators at each of the three
external sites for five days. Testing was performed using one lot of assay reagents and
six operators (two at each site). A blinded reproducibility panel was prepared similar
to the Precision Study panel. Across three sites, a total of 90 replicates were tested per
panel member with the Panther Fusion GBS Assay. The percent agreement with the
expected result was >95% for GBS samples tested at low positive and moderate
positive concentrations. The true negatives yielded the expected results 100% of the
time. A total of thirty positive and negative controls also yielded the expected result.
Twelve invalid samples occurred as a result of a hardware failure. All of the invalid
samples were re-tested per the labeled instructions and produced valid results. The
results from the site-to-site Reproducibility Study for the Panther Fusion GBS Assay
are presented in Table 6 below.

Shipping Stability
One lot of reagents and controls for the Panther Fusion GBS Assay were tested with
three panel members in this study. Two positive panels members consisted of sip or
cfb plasmid diluted in Specimen Transport Medium, and the negative panel member
consisted of Specimen Transport Medium alone. Shipping stability was evaluated by
exposing reagents and controls to five cycles of temperature variation for up to 280
hours. Each cycle consisted of eight hours of exposure to extremely low temperatures
(< -40 °C) followed by eight hours of exposure to high temperatures (55°C) these
exposure phases were interspersed with storage at room temperature for 16 hours.
The performance of reagents and controls under controlled ambient shipping
conditions (15°C to 30°C) was also assessed as reference. Reagents performances
was evaluated at the end of each cycle by functional testing triplicates of the three-
member panel (two positives and one negative). At each timepoint and for each
shipping condition tested, all samples gave expected results demonstrating the
stability of Panther Fusion GBS Assay reagents and controls at room temperature and
extreme shipping conditions for up to 288 hours.

A study was conducted to establish stability for samples after collection, enrichment
in selective broth (Lim Broth and Carrot Broth), and dilution in Specimen Transport
Medium for Panther Fusion processing.
· Swab Sample Stability
The Swab Sample Stability Study was conducted with samples in Amies transport
medium at 15°C and 30°C for up to 48 hours. To simulate vaginal/rectal swab
specimen collection and transportation conditions from patients to testing lab,
Amies was spiked with GBS serotype III at different concentrations: 10X LoD,
3X LoD and 50 CFU/swab. Amies samples were stored at room temperature
(15°C and 30°C) and tested at baseline (T=0) and at different time points for up to
48 hours with six hours interval between the time points. At each storage time
point, Amies samples were enriched either in Lim Broth or in Carrot Broth for 18-
24 hours and then processed for the Panther Fusion GBS Assay. Eight samples
were tested for each time point and storage condition. For all time points tested up
to 48 hours of storage at 15°C and 30°C, 100% of the swabs spiked with GBS
serotype III at 50 CFU/Swab, 3X LoD and 10X LoD gave GBS positive results
when tested with the Panther Fusion GBS Assay.
· Enriched Sample Stability
The Enriched Sample Stability Study was conducted with samples enriched in
Lim Broth or Carrot Broth at 2°C and 8°C for up to five days, and at 15°C and
30°C for up to 24 hours. Clinical negative Amies medium was use to represent the
swab sample. Amies medium was spiked with GBS serotype III at 3X LoD and
used to inoculate fresh Lim Broth and Carrot Broth. Cultures were incubated at
35-37°C for 18-24 hours. Separate enrichment broth aliquots were prepared for
each time point. Enriched samples where then stored under the following storage
conditions:
- Room temperature (15°C and 30°C) for up to 24 hours
- Refrigerated temperature (2°C and 8°C) for up to five days
For enriched cultures stored at room temperature, the test was performed at 0, 6,
12 and 24 hours of storage. For enriched cultures stored at refrigerated
temperature, the test was performed at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 days of storage. At each
storage time point, samples were processed and tested on the Panther Fusion GBS
Assay. Eight samples were tested for each time point and storage condition. After
24 hours of storage at room temperatures (15°C and 30°C), 100% of the enriched
samples gave GBS positive results when tested with the Panther Fusion GBS
Assay. After five days of storage at refrigerated temperatures (2°C and 8°C),
100% of the enriched samples gave GBS positive result when tested with the
Panther Fusion GBS Assay.
· Processed Sample Stability
The Processed Sample Stability Study was conducted with enriched samples
transferred in Specimen Transport Medium and kept at 2°C and 8°C for up to five
10

--- Page 11 ---
days, as well as 15°C and 30°C for up to 72 hours. Enrichment broths inoculated
with GBS serotype III at 3X LoD and 10X LoD were stored for five days at 8°C.
After five days of storage for the enriched culture, a processed sample was
prepared by adding an aliquot of each enrichment broth in an Aptima Transfer
Tube containing Specimen Transport Medium. Samples were then stored under
the following conditions:
- Room temperature (15°C and 30°C) for up to 72 hours
- Refrigerated temperature (2°C and 8°C) for up to five days
Eight samples were tested for each time point and storage condition. After 72
hours of storage at room temperatures (15°C and 30°C), 100% of the processed
samples gave GBS positive results when tested with the Panther Fusion GBS
Assay. After five days of storage at refrigerated temperatures (2°C and 8°C), 100%
of the processed samples gave GBS positive result after processing with the Panther
Fusion GBS Assay.
Stability claims for samples to be tested with the Panther Fusion GBS Assay are as
follows:
- Swab samples are stable up to 48 hours at room temperature (15-30°C)
- Enriched sample in Lim Broth or in Carrot Broth are stable for up to 24 hours at
room temperature (15-30°C) and for up to five days at refrigerated temperature
(2-8°C).
- The processed samples (enriched culture in Specimen Transport Medium) are
stable for up to 72 hours at room temperature (15-30°C) and for up to five days
at refrigerated temperature.
d. Detection limit
LoD and Analytical Sensitivity
The LoD of the Panther Fusion GBS Assay for multiple GBS strains was determined
by testing serial dilutions of 11 GBS serotypes ( Ia, Ib, Ic, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII,
and IX) and one non-hemolytic (NH) isolate in negative clinical Lim Broth matrix.
Thirty replicates were tested with each of three reagent lots for a combined total of 90
replicates per serotype and dilution. Probit analysis was performed for each reagent
lot with the reported 95% LoD based upon the worst estimate, as shown in Table 8.
Serotype specific LoD estimates were confirmed by testing an additional 20 replicates
with one reagent lot.

Broth Equivalence Study
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate equivalence between Lim and Carrot
enrichment broths with the Panther Fusion GBS Assay. Three GBS strains (serotype
III, serotype V, and a non-hemolytic) were serially diluted in clinical negative
matrices of Lim Broth or Carrot Broth to their respective concentrations (at 0.5X, 2X
and 5X LoD) based on data obtained during the LoD study. For each type of broth, 30
replicates per strain and concentration as well as 30 replicates of negative matrix were
processed. Testing was performed with one reagent lot and one Panther Fusion
system. All five attempted runs were valid and the internal control (IC) was detected
in each of the 1785 reactions, resulting in respectively a 0% invalid run rate and a 0%
internal control invalid rate.
Positivity results for Lim Broth and Carrot Broth are summarized in Table 9. The
Panther Fusion GBS Assay demonstrated equivalent performance between Lim Broth
and Carrot Broth at 2X LoD and 5X LoD concentrations. Sample concentrations
below the assay LoD were tested to ensure that the panel concentrations challenged
the assay. Enriched specimens are expected to contain target concentrations above the
Panther Fusion GBS Assay LoD.

Cross-Reactivity and Microbial Interference
A study was conducted with the Panther Fusion GBS Assay to determine the cross-
reactivity of 110 microorganisms (or nucleic acid) representing various non-GBS
groups of Streptococci, along with other bacteria, protozoa/parasites, yeast/fungi, and
viruses common to the urogenital and digestive tract (Table 10). Bacteria and yeast
were tested at > 106 CFU/ml. Viruses were tested at the at 1x 105 PFU/ml, except
where noted. To simplify testing, various pools were prepared with five organisms
spiked into negative Lim Broth clinical matrix. Organisms were tested in triplicate
both with and without GBS (spiked at a concentration 3X the established LoD). None
of the tested microorganisms were reported as cross-reactive or interfering with the
Panther Fusion GBS Assay.

g. Carry-over/Cross Contamination
A Carry-Over and Cross Contamination Study for the Panther Fusion GBS Assay was
conducted to verify that no cross-contamination occurs on the test system. Samples
were tested with high positive samples (1 x 106 CFU/ml) and negative samples. Five
runs of 60 reactions with alternating high positive (n=30) and negative (n=30)
samples were processed on two Panther Fusion systems. A total of 7 runs were
performed per instrument (14 total). All samples tested during the study gave the
expected results. No carry-over/cross-contamination was observed.
h. Assay cut-off:
The RFU range threshold and Ct threshold results processing parameters were
defined based upon the analysis of data generated during the development of the GBS
assay. Data from 81 runs consisting of a mix of analytical and pre-clinical panels
were used in the analysis. Samples with a GBS (FAM) Ct value less than the FAM Ct
threshold of 40 are reported as GBS positive. Samples with a GBS (FAM) Ct value
greater than the FAM Ct threshold of 40 and an IC (RED677) Ct value greater than
the RED677 Ct threshold of 38 are reported as invalid.

A prospective multicenter study was conducted at three geographically diverse sites
using left-over enriched culture samples (Lim Broth and Carrot Broth) from
vaginal/rectal swab specimens collected from antepartum women undergoing routine
GBS screening. Vaginal/rectal specimen swabs were cultured in Lim Broth or Carrot
Broth from 18-24 hrs. Of the total 959 specimens enrolled and tested during the

study, 12 Carrot Broth samples were removed from analysis as these did not meet
the inclusion criteria (incubation time of enrichment exceeded 24 hrs).
A total of 947 specimens were compliant and provided valid results for evaluation
from the three participating sites. Samples were tested with both the Reference
Culture Method and the Panther Fusion GBS Assay to determine the clinical
sensitivity and specificity. The Panther Fusion GBS Assay was performed according
to the package insert. Ten invalids were observed (six hardware failures and four IC
failures). All re-tests yielded a valid result. The study results are shown in Table 12
below.
For all samples enriched in Lim Broth and those samples enriched in Carrot Broth
for which no color change was observed, per the CDC algorithm, one blood agar
plate (BAP) was inoculated for reference method testing. BAPs were incubated for
up to 48 hours and inspected for organisms suggestive of GBS. The presence of GBS
after incubation on BAP was confirmed by Gram staining, latex agglutination, and
catalase tests. Carrot Broth cultures that changed to the expected color (indicative of
GBS) were reported as GBS positive samples and not subcultured.
