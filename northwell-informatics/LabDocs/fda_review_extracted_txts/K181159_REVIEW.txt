The assay provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific alternative
chemical method (e.g., gas or liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry) must be
used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly
when the preliminary test result is positive.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
For in vitro diagnostic use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Beckman Coulter AU680 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The LZI Fentanyl Enzyme Immunoassay is a kit comprised of two reagents, R1 and R2,
which are bottled separately but sold together within the kit.
The R1 solution contains mouse monoclonal anti-norfentanyl antibody, glucose-6-phosphate
(G6P) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), stabilizers, and sodium azide (0.09 %) as a
preservative. The R2 solution contains glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) labeled
with norfentanyl in buffer with sodium azide (0.09 %) as a preservative.

L. Test Principle:
The LZI Fentanyl Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay with
ready-to-use liquid reagents. It detects and is calibrated against norfentanyl, the major
metabolite of fentanyl in human urine. The assay is based on competition between drug in the
sample and drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for
a fixed amount of antibody in the reagent. In the absence of drug in the sample, norfentanyl-
labeled G6PDH conjugate is bound to antibody, and the enzyme activity is inhibited. When
free norfentanyl is present in the sample, it competes with norfentanyl-labeled G6PDH for
antibody binding, allowing for maximal enzyme activity. Thus G6PDH activity is
proportional to the amount of free fentanyl in the sample. Active G6PDH converts
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that
can be measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor conducted a qualitative precision study on one Beckman Coulter AU680
analyzer using samples containing norfentanyl. Samples were prepared by spiking
pooled negative human urine with norfentanyl to concentrations of ±25%, ±50%,
±75%, and ±100% of the cutoff. All concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS

Citric Acid (800 mg/dL) and Potassium Chloride (6000 mg/dL) were evaluated by
spiking these compounds into processed negative urine containing norfentanyl at +
50% and -50% of the 5 ng/mL cutoff (2.5 ng/mL and 7.5 ng/mL). The sponsor stated
that no significant interference was observed.

interferent into processed negative urine containing norfentanyl at +25% and -25% of
the 5 ng/mL cutoff (3.75 ng/mL and 6.25 ng/mL). The labeling contains the following
limitation:
Boric acid at 1% w/v may cause false negative results. Boric acid is not
recommended as a preservative for urine.

* This sample contained levels of fentanyl that contributed to the false positive result.
The sponsor provided additional information for FDA review that supports the
clinical validity of a 5 ng/mL norfentanyl cutoff. Over 7,000 de-identified urine
samples, originating from patients presenting at various hospital clinics, substance
abuse clinics, and emergency departments were evaluated for the presence of fentanyl
and norfentanyl using an LC/MS method. Approximately 600 samples contained
amounts of either fentanyl or norfentanyl above the LC/MS method detection limit.
Assuming a 1 ng/mL fentanyl cutoff (previously cleared in k161216), 89.1% of these
samples would have been determined to be positive for fentanyl. Assuming a 5 ng/mL
norfentanyl cutoff, 93.6% of these samples would have been determined to be
positive for norfentanyl. 9.0% of these samples were not above the 1 ng/mL fentanyl
cutoff, but were above the 5 ng/mL norfentanyl cutoff. 4.5% of these samples were
above the 1 ng/mL fentanyl cutoff, but were not above the 5 ng/mL norfentanyl
cutoff. Therefore, the sponsor provided sufficient information to support that a 5
ng/mL norfentanyl cutoff demonstrates similar positivity and negativity rates to the 1
ng/mL fentanyl cutoff.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. This assay is intended to be used with urine samples only.
