L. Test Principle:
The Synermed ISE reagents measures sodium, potassium, and chloride using ion selective
electrode technology. Ion-selective electrodes (ISE) for sodium, potassium, and chloride
utilize membranes selective to each of these ions. An electrical potential (voltage) is
developed across the membranes between the reference and measuring electrodes in
accordance with the Nernst equation. The voltage is compared to previously determined
calibrator voltages and converted into ion concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A2 guideline. Five
levels of serum pools were tested in two replicates per run, two runs per day for 20
days (N=80). The results of the precision studies are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity studies were performed following the CLSI EP06-A guideline. For the
three electrolytes, nine to eleven equally spaced concentrations covering the
measurement range were prepared by mixing high and low concentration samples.
Four replicates were measured for each sample. The observed values were plotted
against the expected values and linear regression analysis was performed. The
summary results are provided in the table below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The Synermed ISE method on the IR-1200 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer
is correlated to the same assay on the Hitachi 717 analyzer.
d. Detection limit:
Reportable ranges were determined based on the linearity studies (see above, M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A2 guideline to
determine the effects from potential interferents on the ISE assays. Various
concentrations of interferents were spiked into two levels (low and high) of each
analyte in serum. Testing was performed in four replicates per level using one reagent
lot on one instrument. The sponsor states that interference is considered to be non-
significant if the bias between the tested and control samples are within 10% for Na+,
K+ and Cl-, respectively.
The results of the interference study for serum samples are summarized below:
Highest concentration tested that did not

Unconjugated Bilirubin 342 µmol/L
Conjugated Bilirubin 342 µmol/L

The sponsor includes the following limitation in the labeling: Hemolysis is a known
contributing factor to abnormally high potassium levels therefore potassium should
not be tested in hemolyzed samples.

Method comparison studies were performed by testing patient samples in singlet on
one candidate device and the results were compared to those obtained on the
predicate device (Sodium, Potassium and Chloride ISE methodologies on the Hitachi
717 Analyzer). Among the samples tested for each analyte, 10% of the samples were
spiked or diluted to fully span the claimed measuring range of each analyte. The
ordinary linear regression analyses for the three electrolytes are summarized below:
