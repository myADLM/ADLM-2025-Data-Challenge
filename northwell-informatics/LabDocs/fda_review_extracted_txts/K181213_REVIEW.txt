ADVIA Centaur CMV lgG
The ADVIA Centaur CMV IgG (CMV IgG) assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the
qualitative detection of IgG antibodies to cytomegalovirus (CMV) in human pediatric and
adult serum and plasma (dipotassium EDTA, lithium heparin) using the ADVIA Centaur
XP system. This assay is used to determine CMV IgG serological status and as an aid in
the diagnosis of CMV infection in individuals for whom a CMV IgG test was ordered,
including pregnant women.

The ADVIA Centaur CMV IgG (CMV IgG) Quality Control material is for in vitro
diagnostic use for monitoring the performance of the ADVIA Centaur CMV IgG (CMV
IgG) assay on ADVIA Centaur systems.
2. Indication(s) for use: Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s): N/A
4. Special instrument requirements: ADVIA Centaur XP system
I. Device Description: The ADVIA Centaur CMV IgG Assay is a fully automated, 2-step
sandwich immunoassay using indirect chemiluminometric technology. The patient specimen is
diluted with ADVIA Centaur CMV IgG Diluent and incubated with the Solid Phase reagent. The
Solid Phase reagent contains a heterogeneous mixture of biotinylated CMV viral lysate antigens,
preformed to streptavidin-coated magnetic particles. The antigen coated particles subsequently
capture CMV specific antibodies in the specimen. The antibody-antigen complex is washed and
detection reagent is added. The detection reagent consists of an acridinium-ester (AE)-labeled
anti-human IgG mouse monoclonal antibody. The entire complex is washed and the signal is
generated in the presence of Lite Reagent bound to the Solid Phase via the CMV IgG-CMV
antigen complex. The system reports results according to the selected option, as described in the
system operating Instructions.

f. Assay cut-off:
Cutoff Determination: A comparison study between the ADVIA Centaur CMV IgG
assay and a comparator CMV IgG assay was performed to determine the placement of the
cutoff value at a 1.00 Index by testing 389 remnant clinical samples. Of these, 196
samples were negative, 186 samples were positive, and the rest were equivocal by the
comparator device. The cutoff value was set at ≥ 95% positive agreement and ≥ 95%
negative agreement to the comparator device.

Method Comparison: Percent agreement was determined by comparing the performance
of the ADVIA Centaur CMV IgG assay to a comparator CMV IgG assay. A total of 1842
samples that were sent for CMV IgG testing were analyzed, including:
· 1699 prospectively collected specimens
o 684 subjects sent for CMV IgG testing
o 348 pregnant subjects

Note: Five samples that tested equivocal by the comparator assay were further tested on two other CMV IgG assays.
Of these 5 samples, 3 remained equivocal, and 1 agreed and 1 did not agree with the ADVIA Centaur CMV lgG
assay when compared to the two out of three consensus result.
Retrospective Study
HIV-Positive Patient Subgroup: A total of 143 retrospective remnant samples from the HIV-
positive patient subgroup collected at 1 site were tested. The following results were obtained:

b. Matrix comparison:
Specimen Collection Tube Comparison: The ADVIA Centaur CMV IgG assay was
evaluated using different specimen matrices. ADVIA Centaur CMV IgG results that
ranged from 0.74–28.55 Index were analyzed using orthogonal regression. The
following results were obtained:

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Panel: A panel of 80 previously characterized
serum samples was obtained from the CDC and evaluated with the ADVIA Centaur
CMV IgG assay to determine the performance of the assay. There was 100% agreement
with the serological status provided by the CDC.

Note: The results are presented as a means to convey further information on the
performance of this assay with a characterized serum panel from the CDC. This does not
imply an endorsement of the assay by the CDC.
b. Clinical specificity: N/A
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): N/A
4. Clinical cut-off: N/A
5. Expected values/Reference range:
CMV is a universally dispersed pathogen with approximately 40%–100% of the world's
population having CMV antibody present in blood. Age, socioeconomic status, and
geographic location have all been suggested to play a role in the overall incidence of
CMV IgG. A population of 1842 male and female subjects (1827 subjects from the US),
were tested in the clinical studies described above using the ADVIA Centaur CMV lgG
assay. The values obtained and the demographic information are shown in the table
below.

As with all in vitro diagnostic assays, each laboratory should determine its own reference
range(s) for the diagnostic evaluation of patient results.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
