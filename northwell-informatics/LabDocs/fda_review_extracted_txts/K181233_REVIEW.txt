L. Test Principle:
This is a competitive assay with an assay time of 18 minutes.
First incubation: 15 μL of sample is combined with a T4 specific antibody labeled with a
sulfonyl ruthenium complex.
Second incubation: After addition of biotinylated T4 and streptavidin-coated microparticles,
the still free binding sites of the labeled antibody become occupied, with formation of an
antibody hapten complex. The entire complex becomes bound to the solid phase via
interaction of biotin and streptavidin.
The reaction mixture is then aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are
magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then
removed with ProCell/ProCell M. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces
chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.
Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument-specifically generated by
2 point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The repeatability (within-run) and intermediate precision (total) of the Elecsys FT4
III assay were evaluated on one cobas e 411 Immunoassay Analyzer referencing the
CLSI EP05-A2 guideline. Five human serum samples and two levels of control
material were analyzed. The protocol consisted of testing 2 replicates of each human
serum sample and control per run, 2 runs per day for 21 days.
The results of the precision study were as follows:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity of the Elecsys FT4 III assay was assessed using human serum samples on
the cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzer according to CLSI EP06-A guideline.
A high analyte human serum sample was diluted with FT4 analyte free human serum
to create 8 levels with FT4 concentrations from 0.068 to 8.623 ng/dL. Each sample
was measured in triplicate on 3 lots of reagent. Linearity was evaluated using first,
second and third polynomial regression analysis based on CLSI EP06-A. The
coefficient of the third order polynomial regression was found to be significant;
therefore, calculation of the third order model was used to demonstrate linearity. All
three reagent lots generated similar results and one representative lot is presented
below.
The linear regression line was y = 0.982x + 0.009, R2=0.9988
Summary of the deviation of the third order polynomial regression against the
expected linear regression:

The results of the linearity study and the limit of detection study (below) support the
sponsor claims that the measuring range of this assay is 0.101 – 7.7 ng/dL.

d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) is the 95th percentile value from 60 measurements of
analyte-free samples over several independent series (60 measurements /lot, 3 lots of
regents). The LoB corresponds to the concentration below which analyte-free samples
are found with a probability of 95% and was determined to be 0.03 ng/dL (highest of
the 3 lots).
The limit of detection (LoD) is determined based on the LoB and the standard
deviation of low concentration samples. The LoD corresponds to the lowest analyte
concentration which can be detected (value above the LoB with a probability of
95%). Five level of low samples were measured in two replicates per sample per run
for 6 runs (one run per day, over multiple days), using 3 lots of reagents. LoD was
determined to be 0.05 ng/dL (highest of the 3 lots).
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was determined by measuring five low serum
samples, in five replicates per run, one run per day, over 5 days, using 3 lots of
reagents. LoQ is defined as the lowest analyte concentration that can be reproducibly
measured with an intermediate precision CV of ≤ 20 % and was determined to be
0.101 ng/dL (highest of the 3 lots).
The claimed measuring range of this assay is: 0.101 – 7.7 ng/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
1. Endogenous substances
The effect of endogenous substances was evaluated on the e 411 Analyzer
using pooled human serum samples spiked with L-Thyroxine. For each potential
interferent, three serum samples containing low, mid, and high concentrations of
FT4 were analyzed. For all substances tested, no significant interference was
defined as recovery ± 10% of initial value. The potential interferents and the highest
concentration tested which did not cause significant interference are listed below:

Potential interferent
no interference was observed

2. Structurally similar substances

samples spiked with potential cross-reactant compounds and analyzed in duplicate
on the e 411 Analyzer. For all substances tested, no significant interference was
defined as recovery ± 10% of initial value. The following cross-reactivities were
found at FT4 concentrations of approximately 0.974 ng/dL and 2.66 ng/dL:

411 Analyzer using human serum pools spiked with L-Thyroxine. For each drug,
two serum samples containing a low and high concentration of FT4 were analyzed.

10% of initial value. The drugs and the highest concentration tested which did not

Thyroid drugs Furosemide and Levothyroxine caused elevated Free T4 findings at
the daily therapeutic dosage level. This is indicated in the labeling.
The sponsor has the following limitation statement in the labeling:
Any influence that might affect the binding behavior of the binding proteins can
alter the result of the FT4 tests (e.g. drugs, NTIs (Non Thyroid Illness)), patients
suffering from FDH (Familial Dysalbuminemic Hyperthyroxinemia).
The test cannot be used in patients receiving treatment with lipid-lowering agents
containing D-T4. If the thyroid function is to be checked in such patients, the
therapy should first be discontinued for 4-6 weeks to allow the physiological state
to become re-established.
Autoantibodies to thyroid hormones can interfere with the assay.
4. Biotin interference:
Biotin interference was tested up to 1200 ng/mL in serum samples at low, medium
and high concentrations of FT4. Interference was defined as a difference >±10% of
the control sample values. The results are summarized in the tables below:

The labeling states:
Specimens with biotin concentrations up to 104 ng/mL demonstrated ≤ 10%
bias in results. Biotin concentrations greater than 104 ng/mL can lead to
falsely increased fT4 results. Some studies have shown that serum
concentrations of biotin can reach 355 ng/mL within the first hour after biotin
ingestion for subjects consuming supplements of 20 mg biotin per day and up
to 1160 ng/mL for subjects after a single dose of 300 mg biotin.
Do not test samples from patients who take biotin.
