L. Test Principle:
The Athelas One system consists of the Athelas One analyzer and Athelas One test strips.
The Athelas One test strips serve as both a sample container and a reaction chamber. A
capillary whole blood sample or whole blood specimen anticoagulated in K EDTA of 3.5 μL
2
is pipetted or directly transferred via fingerstick to the Athelas One test strip which
automatically spreads the sample into a monolayer. The pre-coated stain within the strip
chamber interacts with the monolayer of blood and stains the WBCs. The Athelas One test
strip is inserted into the Athelas One analyzer which utilizes a proximity sensor to lock in
place. A servo stabilizes and auto-focuses the blood sample, and then a stage actuator scans
the strip across various fields while the optical module takes multiple images of the cells
across the monolayer. The images of the blood sample are transmitted to the server where
they are analyzed using a locked down image processing algorithm. The algorithm
recognizes the nucleation and WBCs to generate a WBC count and NEUT% result based on
the concentrations and types of cells present. The WBC count and NEUT% is then returned
to the user via the controlling mobile application on an authorized lab or hospital device.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability: The repeatability study was conducted in accordance with CLSI EP05-
A3 and CLSI H26-A2 at one internal site.The study was conducted with nine whole
blood samples collected in K EDTA. The samples spanned the reportable range of the
2
Athelas One analyzer including clinically important ranges and were tested using
three lots of test strips, three operators and five analyzers. Ten replicates were
measured for each sample per lot per operator for a total of 90 measurements per
sample. Results were analyzed for both WBC count and NEUT% for the following
variances using a mixed ANOVA model. All results met the pre-defined acceptance
criteria. Table 1 presents results for WBC count and Table 2 presents results for
NEUT%.

Reproducibility: The reproducibility study was conducted in accordance to CLSI
EP05-A3 over 20 days across three sites (two external, one interal), with three
analyzers (one per site), three lots of test strips, two operators per site and one lot of
quality control (QC) materials (ATH-CHECK quality control material) consisting of
three levels (low, medium, high). Each testing site performed two runs per day and
two replicates per run. A total of 80 readings were generated at each site for each
level of QC (2 runs x 20 days x 2 replicates = 80 readings). All results met pre-
defined acceptance criteria. Tables 1–3 summarizes the reproducibility results for the
ATH-CHECK QC material (low, medium and high) at all study sites combined.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Assay reportable range: WBC: 1.0–25.0 x103/µL
Linearity: The objective of the linearity study was to assess the linear correlation of
the Athlelas One WBC concentration across the reportable range (stated above). Ten
samples were analyzed in four replicates across the reportable range and tested on
four analyzers with one test strip lot. The samples were obtained by pooling together
one low WBC concentration K EDTA whole blood sample (0.8 x103/µL) and one
2
high WBC concentration K EDTA whole blood sample (38.6 x103/µL) in specific
2
proportions. The best fitting regressional model was a first order model and linearity
was demonstrated for the range presented below:

device by conducting a 48-hour stability study on nine different K EDTA venous
2
blood samples with low (0.53 x103/μL), normal (4.0–10.0 x103/μL) , and high (>10
x103/μL) WBC levels with one test strip lot and four Athelas one analyzers. The
study was designed in accordance with recommendations from CLSI EP25-A. After
baseline WBC and NEUT% was established by running samples in triplicate at time 0
(T0), each sample was divided into two identical aliquots. Aliquot 1 was stored at
refrigerated temperature (2–8ºC) and aliquot 2 was stored at room temperature (20–
25ºC). Triplicate measurements were run subsequently at each time point for both
refrigerated and room temperature samples. The results were analyzed for measurand
with pre-defined maximum allowable drift criteria. Based on the outcome of the
whole blood stability study, the whole blood sample stability for both WBC and
NEUT% parameters are 24 hours at refrigerated temperature (2–8ºC) and 24 hours at
room temperature (20–25ºC).
Test Strip Stability: A 16-week test strip stability study was conducted to assess the
shelf-life stability of the Athelas test strips. The strips were tested weekly over 16
weeks to substantiate a 14-week stability claim. The study was designed in
accordance with recommendations from CLSI EP25-A. In particular, the study was

conducted over 16 weeks, across two test strip lots, four analyzers, two replicates, and
one lot of quality control materials. Each week, two replicates per two lots of strips
across 3 levels of control fluid were performed. Statistically significant
degradation/drift over the 105 day study (p > 0.05) as recommended by the CLSI
EP25-A regression slope analysis was not observed. The stability duration for all
samples can be set to 98 days with no observed degradation at 105 days, the last time
point of the study.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB): This study was conducted in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2
using five blank samples containing diluent. The LoB was assessed with two strip
lots, two instruments, over three days and two replicates per sample (for each strip
lot, day and instrument combinations) and 60 total blank replicates per lot (across all
blank samples, days and instruments). Each day, two replicates of each sample were
measured per strip lot and instrument combinations.
Limit of Detection (LoD): This study was conducted in accordance with CLSI EP17-
A2. The LoB was established by evaluating five diluted fresh whole blood samples to
create low WBC count samples (0.3–0.5 x103/µL). The samples were assessed with
two strip lots, two instruments for over three days. Two replicates per sample (for
each strip lot, day and instrument combinations) and 60 total replicates per reagent lot
(across all samples, days and instruments) were obtained. On each day, two replicates
of each sample were measured per strip lot and instrument combination.
Limit of Quantification (LoQ): The study was conducted in accordance with CLSI
EP17-A2. The LoQ was established with four diluted K EDTA whole blood samples
2
to reach an approximate WBC concentration of 0.45 x103/µL with two strip lots, one
instrument, for over three days with three replicates per sample.
Parameter LoB LoD LoQ
WBC (103/µL) 0.000 0.079 0.440
e. Analytical specificity:
A study was conducted to determine the interference level of the following
interferents with the hematology results of the Athelas One System. Fresh whole
blood samples collected in K EDTA were contrived with the interferents listed below
2
where 16 measurements were obtained per interferent. The interference study results
demonstrated that the following interferents do not interfere with test results up to the
following concentrations:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison study was conducted at three U.S. point of care clinical sites
to assess the performance of the Athelas One versus the Sysmex XE-5000. Each site
had a minimum of three operators, three lots of test strips, and three Athelas One
analyzers. In total, 312 unique patient samples were analyzed on the Athelas One
system, where 113 samples were analyzed with capillary whole blood (direct from
fingerstick) and 195 samples were analyzed with K EDTA venous whole blood. The
2
method comparison study included both normal and abnormal patient samples at each
site. Passing-Bablok regression analysis was conducted for each individual site as
well as all sites combined. All results were within the pre-defined acceptance criteria.
Tables 1 and 2 presented below demonstrate the correlation and estimated bias of the
Athelas One and System XE-5000 for each site and all sites combined:

tubes thoroughly on a mechanical mixer for at least two minutes or invert the tube 10–20
times by hand. The specimen can be stored at room temperature for 2 hours or in a
refrigerator for 24 hours. If the specimen has been refrigerated, it should be warmed to
room temperature prior to mixing.
5. Calibration:
The Athelas One is factory calibrated and is fully functional upon unpackaging.
6. Quality Control:
ATH-CHECK QC material is provided at three levels (low, normal and high) which
includes preserved human leukocytes (neutrophils, lymphocytes, basophils, eosinophils,
monocytes) along with the other components of whole blood (RBCs, platelets) in
proportions expected in human whole blood.
Value Assignment: Value assignment for the ATH-CHECK QC materials was based on
data collected across three Athelas One analyzers conducted at three separate sites, with
six operators. Each site ran two runs per day and two replicates per run. Standard
deviation from the study was used to determine the range of each parameter of ATH-
CHECK QC material through the formula value range = mean ± 3.0*SD.
Open-Vial Stability: The open-vial stability study was conducted with two ATH-CHECK
QC lots, three QC levels per lot (low, medium, high), two vials per lot and three
instruments. Five time points (days 0, 2, 4, 7 and 8) were included in the study and three
replicates per measurement point were obtained. Results demonstrated an open-vial
stability of 7 days.
Closed-Vial Stability: The closed-vial stability study was conducted with two ATH-
CHECK QC lots, three QC levels per lot (low, medium, high), two vials per lot and three
instruments. Nine time points (days 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16) across the closed-vial
testing period of 16 days and three replicates per measurement point were obtained.
Results demonstrated a closed-vial stability of 15 days.
