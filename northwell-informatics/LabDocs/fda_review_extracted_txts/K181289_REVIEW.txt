H. Intended Use:
1. Intended Use(s):
The Cepheid Xpert Xpress Flu Assay, performed on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems, is
an automated, multiplex real-time, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-
PCR) assay intended for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza
A and influenza B viral RNA. The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay uses nasopharyngeal (NP)
swab and nasal swab (NS) specimens collected from patients with signs and symptoms of
respiratory infection. The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of
influenza infections in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the
sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2015-2016
influenza season for NP swab specimens and the 2016-2017 influenza season for NS
specimens. When other novel influenza A viruses are emerging, performance
characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture
should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and
culture specimens.
Ancillary Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimen Collection Kit for Viruses:
The Xpert Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve, and
transport nasopharyngeal swab specimens and to preserve and transport nasal
aspirate/wash specimens containing viruses from patients with signs and symptoms of
respiratory infection prior to analysis with the Xpert Flu Assay or the Xpert Flu/RSV XC
Assay. The Xpert Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve,

I. Device Description:
Overview
The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay, performed on the GeneXpert Instrument (Dx and Infinity)
Systems, is a rapid, multiplex nucleic acid amplification test for the qualitative detection and
differentiation of influenza A and influenza B viral RNA from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab
and nasal swab (NS) specimens.
To perform the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay, NP swab and NS specimens are collected from
patients and placed into viral transport medium using the Xpert Xpress Nasopharyngeal
Sample Collection Kit for Viruses. With a transfer pipette, eluted NP swab and NS
specimens are loaded into the sample chamber of a single-use, self-contained Xpert Xpress
Flu Assay cartridge. Each assay cartridge contains separate chambers for sample loading,
sample processing and target amplification by real-time RT-PCR, and contains all the
reagents necessary to carry out these processes. Because the cartridges are self-contained,
and specimens never contact working parts of the instrument modules, cross-contamination
between samples is minimized.
The assay cartridge containing the patient sample is inserted into the GeneXpert Instrument
System, which performs fully automated and integrated sample preparation and real-time
RT-PCR for the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay in approximately 30 minutes or less. The
GeneXpert Instrument Systems, comprised of the GeneXpert Dx and GeneXpert Infinity
Systems, have one to 80 randomly accessible modules that are each capable of performing
separate sample preparation and real-time PCR and RT-PCR tests. Each module contains a
syringe drive for dispensing fluids (i.e., the syringe drive activates the plunger that works in
concert with the rotary valve in the cartridge to move fluids between chambers), an
ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, and a proprietary I-CORE thermocycler for
performing real-time PCR and RT-PCR detection.
After completion of the test, the assay results are interpreted by the GeneXpert software
3

--- Page 4 ---
from measured fluorescent signals and embedded calculation algorithms, and are shown in
the “View Results” window in tabular and graphic formats.
1. Materials Provided
The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay (Cat # XPRSFLU-10) contains sufficient reagents to process
10 NP swab, NS specimens or quality control samples. The assay kit includes 10 individual
cartridges with integrated reaction tubes that hold all the reagents necessary for sample lysis,
RNA extraction, and nucleic acid amplification. Additionally, each kit includes a set of 12
transfer pipettes for loading samples into the assay cartridge and a CD containing the Assay
Definition Files (ADFs) with instructions for importing ADFs into the GeneXpert software.
2. Materials Required but Not Provided
Validated Specimen Collection and Transport Kit:
· Cepheid Xpert Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit for Viruses (Cat # SWAB/B-
100) containing one individually wrapped, sterile nasopharyngeal flocked nylon
swab and one Xpert Viral Transport Medium tube with three mL of Xpert Viral
Transport Medium.
· Cepheid Xpert Nasal Sample Collection Kit for Viruses (Cat # SWAB/F-100)
containing one individually wrapped, sterile nasal flocked nylon swab and one Xpert
Viral Transport Medium tube with three mL of Xpert Viral Transport Medium.
GeneXpert Instrument System:
· GeneXpert Dx System (GX-I, GX-II, GX-IV, GX-XVI)
· GeneXpert Infinity System (Infinity-48, Infinity-48s, Infinity-80)
3. Materials Available but Not Provided
External Controls:
· Positive inactivated influenza A and B virus control from ZeptoMetrix
(Cat # NATFLUAB-6C)
· Negative inactivated coxsackievirus control from ZeptoMetrix
(Cat # NATCXVA9-6C)
4. Quality Control
The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay includes two internal controls: a sample processing control, and
a probe check control.
Sample Processing Control:
The sample processing control (SPC) is a non-infectious armored RNA pseudovirus that
ensures adequate processing of target viruses, monitors the presence of PCR inhibitors, and
verifies the use of proper PCR conditions. The SPC should be POSITIVE in a sample that is
4

--- Page 5 ---
negative for both influenza A and influenza B target analytes, and can be NEGATIVE or
POSITIVE in a sample containing detectable levels of one or more of the target analytes.
Probe Check Control:
The probe check control (PCC) is present to control for sufficient reagent rehydration, PCR
tube filling, probe integrity, and dye stability. All assay reagents must be present and intact
for the PCC to pass the validated acceptance criteria. If any of the PCC conditions fail, the
result is reported as an ERROR and the test must be repeated using a new assay cartridge.
5. Results Interpretation
POSITIVE or NEGATIVE test results for influenza A (Flu A) and influenza B (Flu B) viral
RNA are automatically generated by the GeneXpert software and presented as text in the
“View Results” window of the GeneXpert Instrument Systems following completion of the
test. The GeneXpert software is equipped with embedded algorithms to determine the result
of the test based on the calculated cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained for each of the RNA
target-specific optical curves generated by fluorescent probes during the real-time PCR
cycling process. Optical curves for each of the RNA targets are also displayed in the “View
Results” window but do not require manual data interpretation or reviewing.
The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay uses two separate channels for the detection of influenza A
viral RNA (Flu A 1 and Flu A 2). The primers and probes in the Flu A 1 channel have 100%
homology to human influenza A strains. The primers and probes in the Flu A 2 channel
have > 95% homology to avian influenza A strains and approximately 80% homology to
human influenza A strains. Detection of influenza A strains in either the Flu A 1 or Flu A 2
channel is reported as Flu A POSITIVE.
The GeneXpert Instrument Systems software also reports if the test is INVALID, encounters
an ERROR, or produces NO RESULT.
All possible test results for the Xpert Xpress Flu assay are shown in Table 1.

If any of the test results mentioned below occur, the test should be repeated using leftover
specimen from the original transport medium tube and a new assay cartridge.
· INVALID: indicates that the control SPC failed. The sample was not properly
processed, PCR was inhibited, or the sample was not properly collected.
· ERROR: could be a result of PCC failure, or that the maximum pressure limits were
exceeded. PCR does not initiate when there is a PCC failure.
· NO RESULT: indicates that insufficient data were collected. For example, the operator
stopped a test that was in progress or a power failure occurred.
· Co-infection with two or more viruses: the incidence of co-infection with influenza A
and influenza B viruses is low. Specimens should undergo repeat testing if nucleic
acids from more than one analyte are detected in a single specimen.

L. Test Principle:
The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay performed on the GeneXpert Instrument platform utilizes
automated real-time RT-PCR for unique gene-specific sequence amplification and 5’ end
cleavage of hybridized, fluorogenic target-specific probe for the detection of influenza A and
influenza B viral RNA. Specific gene targets of the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay primers and probes
include the matrix protein (M), basic polymerase protein 2 (PB2), and polymerase acidic
protein (PA) of influenza A viruses and the matrix protein (M) and non-structural proteins
(NS1 and NS2) of influenza B viruses. Additional assay primers generate amplicons for the
SPC.
The GeneXpert Instrument Systems automates sample preparation, amplification and real-time
detection of target-specific cDNA from clinical specimens. Each system utilizes a syringe
pump drive to dispense fluids to and from the different cartridge chambers and ultrasonic lysis
to release nucleic acids from both the target organisms and integrated SPC. During the
amplification process, the I-CORE module contained within the GeneXpert Instrument systems
heats and cools the reaction tube contents, and detects emitted fluorescence generated in the
presence of target sequences. Embedded data analysis algorithms within the GeneXpert
Instrument software generate test results based on the calculated cycle threshold (Ct) values
obtained for each of the RNA target-specific optical curves generated by fluorescent probes
during the real-time RT-PCR cycling process. The time to results is 30 minutes or less.

--- Page 12 ---
at three sites (one internal, two external), by two operators per site, on either the GeneXpert
Dx system, the Infinity-48 system or the Infinity-80 system (each of the three sites used a
different instrument). Each operator tested one panel in duplicate, two times per day over
six, not necessarily consecutive days. Three lots of Xpert cartridges were used, with each
lot representing approximately two days of testing.
Original testing was performed on the GeneXpert Dx Instrument System with system
software version 4.6a or higher as part of K162456. Re-analysis of the original data was
conducted for this submission using the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay ADF version 3 in order to
determine reproducibility of the newly modified assay.
The expected results for each of the panel members are shown in Table 4 below. Overall
percent agreement between the expected results and the re-analyzed reproducibility study
results is presented in Table 5. Analysis of variance (CV) between sites, days, lots, and
operators for each reproducibility panel member is presented in Table 6.
Re-analysis of K162456 reproducibility data resulted in no changes to the percent
agreement for the negative, influenza A (Flu A) moderate positive, or influenza B (Flu B)
low positive sample types. For influenza A low positive samples, the percent agreement
decreased from 93.7% to 93.6% using ADF version 3. For influenza B moderate positive
samples, the percent agreement increased from 99.3% to 100%.

Additional study data to support stability claims at 16 months were provided in this
submission.
• 2-28°C for up to 16 months.

Cartridge Hold Time:
The following stability claim for prepared samples waiting on the GeneXpert Xpress
GX II or IV are supported by study data from K162456:
• Up to 4.5 hours at room temperature
Carry-over:
A carry-over study was conducted to demonstrate that single-use, self-contained GeneXpert
cartridges prevent carry-over contamination of negative samples if preceded by very high
positive samples in the same GeneXpert module. The study consisted of a negative sample
processed in the same GeneXpert module (GeneXpert Dx System; GX-IV instrument)
immediately following a very high positive influenza A sample (A/Victoria/361/2011,
2x107 TCID /mL) spiked into a simulated background matrix. The background matrix
50
consisted of 2.5% (w/v) porcine mucin, 1% (v/v) human whole blood in 0.85% sodium
chloride (NaCl) formulated in 1X PBS solution with 15% glycerol, which was then diluted
in UTM to a final concentration of 16.7%.
The testing was repeated 20 times on two GeneXpert modules for a total of 41 runs
resulting in 20 positive and 21 negative specimens for each virus type. All 20 positive
samples were correctly reported as Flu A POSITIVE; Flu B NEGATIVE. All 21 negative
samples were correctly reported as Flu A NEGATIVE; Flu B NEGATIVE. Therefore,
under the conditions of the study, no evidence of specimen or amplicon carry-over
contamination was observed in the GeneXpert Dx modules.
d. Detection limit:
The following influenza strains were used in the Limit of Detection (LoD) study:
· Influenza A pandemic 2009 H1N1 strains
o A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)
o A/Florida/27/2011 (H1N1)
· Influenza A H3N2 strains
o A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)
o A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2)
· Influenza B strains
o B/Massachusetts/2/2012
o B/Wisconsin/01/2011
The LoD studies for the NP and NS specimens were originally conducted as part of
submissions K162456 (using GeneXpert Instrument systems; NP samples) and
15

--- Page 16 ---
K171552 (using GeneXpert Xpress systems; NS samples). These data were re-
analyzed for this submission using a new Assay Definition File version 3 (ADF v3)
and presented in Table 8. There was no change in LoD, using ADF v3, for any of the
strains tested when compared to previous submissions K162456 and K171552.

f. Assay cut-off:
The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay detects Flu A and Flu B targets. The Assay has two channels
(Flu A 1 and Flu A 2) to detect influenza A strains. The Assay has one channel (Flu B) to
detect influenza B strains.
For each of the analytes (Flu A 1, Flu A 2, and Flu B) the valid cycle threshold (Ct) range
to report a positive result is Ct 10.0 to 40.0. For the Sample Processing Control (SPC) the
valid Ct range to report a positive result is Ct 26 to 40. The Ct cutoffs are included as
automatic calculations in the ADF that is provided with the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not Applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
An equivalency study for clinical and simulated nasal matrix was described in K162456.
An equivalence study for NP swab matrix, NS matrix and simulated matrix was described
in K171552.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
Performance of the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay was previously evaluated against FDA-cleared
nucleic acid reference tests during two separate prospective clinical studies (K162456 and
K171552). For the K162456 study, data was collected during the 2015-2016 influenza
season and used to support clearance of the Xpert Xpress Assay on the GeneXpert
Instrument systems (K162456) with nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens. For the
K171552 study, data was collected during the 2016-2017 influenza season and used to
support clearance of the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay on the GeneXpert Xpress Instrument
Systems (K171552) with both NP and nasal swab (NS) specimens. Details for the two
clinical studies can be found in the respective decision summaries.

To determine the clinical performance of the newly modified Xpert Xpress Flu Assay
(ADF v3) on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems, data from the previously conducted
studies were re-analyzed using the new software version. Results from the reanalysis are
summarized in the following tables.

Implementation of ADF v3 resulted in a 0.1% increase in NPA for influenza A and
influenza B for prospectively collected, fresh specimens when compared to the previous
ADF version. In addition, there was a 0.8% increase in NPA for influenza A and influenza
B for consecutively collected, frozen specimens when compared to the previous ADF
version. Therefore, ADF v3 has minimal impact on assay performance using clinical NP
swab specimens.

Implementation of ADF v3 resulted in a 0.3% increase in NPA for influenza A and a 0.1%
increase in NPA for influenza B when compared to the previous ADF version. Therefore,
ADF v3 has minimal impact on assay performance using clinical NS specimens.
4. Clinical cut-off:
N/A
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Expected prevalence values for influenza A and influenza B infections were calculated
using the data acquired during the NP and NS clinical studies conducted under K162456
and K171552, respectively. The number and percentage of cases positive for influenza A
and influenza B, as reported in Table 13, were determined following re-analysis of the
original study data with the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay ADF v3.

this line of product types.
Yes ______X_____ or No __________
4. Level of Concern
Moderate
5. Software Description
The GeneXpert Instrument Systems are provided with a computer, preloaded with software
for running tests and viewing results. Each instrument (Dx and Infinity) contains random
access, closed-system, computer-based software and embedded firmware which run
dedicated microprocessor-controlled modules to integrate sample preparation,
amplification, and real-time detection in a single system.
The GeneXpert Infinity modules contain extra robotic features for cartridge handling. The
Xpertise software utilized by the Infinity Systems is the user interface and provides the
ordering of tests as well as automates loading and unloading of cartridges into GeneXpert
modules within the system. The Xpertise user interface builds upon the existing core
software functionality for handling GeneXpert modules for cartridge fluidics control,
temperature control, optics control, and data analysis by the addition of automation
handling for the robotic arm.
6. Specimen Identification
Specimens are manually loaded into the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay cartridge by the user. The
user can then either scan or type the sample and patient ID into the system. Prior to placing
the cartridge into the GeneXpert Instrument System, the barcode on the Xpert Xpress Flu
Assay cartridge is scanned. The information contained in the assay barcode is utilized by
the software to run the appropriate assay definition file (ADF). If an assay is being run that
does not already exist in the GeneXpert database, the user must import the ADF before
starting the test.
