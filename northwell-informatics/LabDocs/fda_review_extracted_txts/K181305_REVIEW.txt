I. Device Description:
The OralTox® Oral Fluid Drug Test is an immunochromatographic assay that uses a
lateral flow system for the qualitative detection of amphetamine, cocaine, cannabinoids,
methamphetamine, morphine, phencyclidine, oxycodone and methadone (target analytes)
in human oral fluid.
The products are single-use in vitro diagnostic devices. Each test kit contains a test cup, a
package insert and a sample collection sponge. Each test device is sealed with a desiccant
in an aluminum pouch.
The device has a built-in sample collection tool, including collection swab and sponge, as
well as a saturation indicator strip. The saturation indicator strip turns red when a volume
of oral fluid has been collected that is adequate to both run the OralTox® test and to
conduct confirmation testing at a laboratory if the result is a presumptive positive.
OralTox® Oral Fluid Drug Tests are the first step in a two-step process. The second step
is to send the sample for confirmatory laboratory testing using a more specific method
(e.g., LC-MS/MS) if preliminary positive results are obtained.

L. Test Principle:
The OralTox®Oral Fluid Drug Test is an immunochromatographic assay that uses a lateral
flow system for the qualitative detection of amphetamine, cocaine, cannabinoids,
methamphetamine, morphine, and phencyclidine, methadone, and oxycodone, (target
analytes) in human oral fluid. The tests are lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays.
During testing, an oral fluid specimen migrates upward by capillary action. If target drugs
present in the oral fluid specimen are below the cut-off concentration, it will not saturate the

binding sites of its specific monoclonal mouse antibody coated on the particles. The
antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible
colored line will show up in the test line region. The colored line will not form in the test line
region if the target drug level exceeds its cut-off-concentration because it will saturate all the
binding sites of the antibody coated on the particles. A band should form in the control
region of the devices regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the sample to
indicate that the tests have been performed properly.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
The analytical performance of the device for the measurement of d-amphetamine (AMP),
cocaine (COC), delta-8-tetrahydrocannibinol (THC), d-methamphetamine (MET), morphine

three operators. Device results were compared to LC-MS/MS results. The results are
presented in the tables below. A method comparison study for d-amphetamine
(AMP), cocaine (COC), delta-8-tetrahydrocannibinol (THC), d-methamphetamine
(MET), morphine (OPI), and phencyclidine (PCP) was provided in k171403.
