*Phadia 2500/5000 – Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000 are identical instruments except for
sample throughput. The difference is that Phadia 2500 consists of 1 process module (2
process lines) and Phadia 5000 consists of 2 process modules (2x2 process lines). For
that reason Phadia uses the Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000 instrument names
interchangeably.

L. Test Principle:
The EliA wells are molded cups comparable to excised wells from a microtiter plate. They
are made of polystyrene and are coated with the respective antigen. The wells are at the same
time a holder of the coupled antigen for convenient automation and a reaction chamber with
reaction/washing solution handling based on pipetting to add and aspiration to remove
liquids.
The EliA wells are coated with human β2-Glycoprotein I antigen or with bovine cardiolipin
antigen. If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies to these proteins bind to the specific
antigen. After washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against
human IgA antibodies (EliA IgA Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate
complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is
incubated with a Development Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the
reaction mixture is measured. The higher the response value, the more specific IgA is present
in the specimen. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is compared
directly to the response for calibrators.

M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
All results presented below met the manufacturer’s predetermined acceptance criteria
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the assay was assessed in a study with a total of 21 runs, one
run/day over a period of seven days. Each sample was tested in four replicates/run
giving a total of 84 replicates per sample (3 instruments × 7 runs x 4 replicates = 84).
The data was calculated against the calibration curve from Day 1. Four serum native
patient serum samples were tested, the same samples were tested on all instruments.
One lot of EliA β2-Glycoprotein I IgA and EliA Cardiolipin IgA was used in these
studies because inter-lot-variation was deteremined in the predicate devices K112414
and K131821. The results for all three instruments are summarized in the tables
below:

Four patient serum samples were diluted in sample diluent and tested in triplicates
with one lot of EliA β2-Glycoprotein I IgA and EliA Cardiolipin IgA reagents and
one set of system reagents on Phadia 2500/5000. The results of the dilutions were
compared with their expected values. The ratio observed/expected (O/E) was
calculated. Mean observed value was used in the calculation. The results of the linear
regression analysis are summarized below:

The following statements is included in the package inserts: “Please note that
concentration values between LoD and LoQ may show a higher uncertainty...
Please note that due to differing binding characteristics of the antibodies in patient
samples, not all sera can be diluted linearly within the measuring range.”
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability, stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods) for the
EliA IgA method was previously reviewed in K062787.
Controls:
Controls are sold separately from the assay.
Traceability:
The IgA calibrators are traceable via unbroken ochain off calibrations to the
International Reference Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of the Human Serum
Immunoglobulins A, G, M from World Health Organization (WHO).
There are no international standards for ß2-Glycoprotein I antibodies. Results are
given in arbitrary EliA Units/mL. The instrument measures specific IgA
concentration in µg/mL. By using a conversion factor given by the lot-specific code
of the EliA ß2-Glycoprotein I IgA Well, thte results are automatically converted to
U/mL.

The standardization of the Cardiolipin IgA assay is adjusted to a set of established
standard sera (Harris et al., 1987). Results are expressed in APL-U/ml (1 APL-Unit
corresponds to the binding activity of 1 μg/ml of cardiolipin IgA antibody that was
purified from the standard serum by affinity chromatography).
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) is based on on 66 blank replicates. The limit of detection is
based on 66 low level replicates. The limit of quantitation is based on 66
determinations and a target uncertainty goal of 20%. The results are summarized in
the table below:

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference: Interference studies were previously reviewed in K112414 for ß2-
Glycoprotein I IgA and in K131821 for Cardiolipin IgA.
Carry-over: Phadia 2500/5000 intruments use disposable tips for pipetting samples
and a separate pipete for the conjugate, therefore carry-over from samples to
conjugate was not evaluated.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assays’ cut-offs are the same as in the predicate devices, K112414 for ß2-
Glycoprotein I IgA and in K131821 for Cardiolipin IgA and are summarized in the
table below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Instrument comparison was performed with the predicate device, see 2c below.
b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison between serum and plasma ( Li-Heparin, and EDTA) was
reviewed in the predicate K112414 for ß2-Glycoprotein I IgA and in K131821 for
Cardiolipin IgA.

4. Clinical cut-off:
See assay cut-off
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A total of 400 apparantly healthy Caucasian blood donors matched by age and gender
were tested on the Phadia 2500/5000 instrument to evaluate expected values in the
normal population. The results are summarized below:
ß2-Glycoprotein I IgA Cardiolipin IgA
n=400 EliA U/mL APL-U/mL
PH250 PH2500/500 PH250 PH2500/500
Mean 1.8 2.1 3.6 3.6
Median 1.4 1.8 2.8 2.8
95th percentile 4.3 4.1 7.1 6.6
99th percentile 8.7 9.5 17.1 16.5
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
