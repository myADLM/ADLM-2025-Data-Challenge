SPECIAL 510(K): DEVICE MODIFICATION
OIR DECISION SUMMARY
510(k) Number: K181368
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the applicant’s own class
II or class I devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable
1. The name and 510(k) number of the applicant’s previously cleared device. (For a preamendments
device, a statement to this effect has been provided.)
Trade Name: VITEK 2 AST-YS Micafungin (≤0.06 - ≥8µg/mL)
510(k) #: K151923
2. Applicant’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as
described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes
instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials
(labeling changes are permitted as long as they do not affect the intended use).
Indications for Use: The indications for use for both devices are identical. Please refer to the
K151923 for the INDICATION/INTENDED USE
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the
indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the
applicant’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between
the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has
not changed. The applicant has provided the design control information as specified in the New
510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, the device is determined to be substantially equivalent to the
previously cleared device.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams,
engineering drawings, photographs, user’s and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to
demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified
device has not changed.
This change is for revising QC organism Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019 expected range from
0.5-2 µg/mL (FDA/CLSI @24h) to 0.25-1 µg/mL (bMx-US) and removal of the following
footnote from the package insert under QC table: “**FDA/CLSI@24H = FDA/CLSI Broth
Microdilution expected QC range at 24h” and replace with the footnote “**bMx-US = bioMerieux
QC range for US”.
bioMerieux performed studies to establish a new quality control ranges for use specifically with
their device. The methods used to provide data to support this change were in confomity to those
outlined in CLSI M23 (Development of In Vitro Susceptibility Testing and Quality Control
Parameters, M23, 5th Ed, Jan 2018).

conducted at seven sites (six external clinical sites and one internal site). Table 2 below
outline the study design. Table 3 outline the FDA/CLSI M27-S4 QC range for Micafungin

QC testing was conducted throughout comparative testing at each of the seven sites using
two Candida species recommended in the FDA approved pharmaceutical drug label and
the CLSI : Candida krusei (ATCC 6258) and Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 22019).
Candida krusei (ATCC 6258) was used as a control. The QC organisms were tested using
three lots of VITEK 2 AST-YS07 suscetibility cards and the CLSI broth microdilution
reference panel read after incubation at 24 and 48 hours at all participating study sites.
Using individual inoculum preparations all three lots were tested in conjunction with the
reference panel. Ten replicates of each QC strain on each of the three lot were tested at
each site. No more than four replicates per day were tested. Reproducibility testing was
peformed on the VITEK AST-YS07 card and the reference method.
Colony counts for each QC strain inoculum was performed on each day of testing.
DensiCHEK Plus instrument was used to standardize the inoculum (modification of
the M23 testing procedure). The DensiCHEK Plus was FDA cleared for standardizing
suspensions for AST testing (K932224).
The QC organisms were tested with the reference method (70 data points), and the VITEK
2 instrument platform using the manual dilution method (210 data points).
The reference method QC results were interpreted after 24 hour and 48h of incubation as
recommended by the FDA pharmaceutical drug label and the CLSI M27-S4, (Reference
Method for Broth Dilution Antifungal Susceptibility Testing of Yeast; Fourth
Informational Supplement, Vol. 32 No.17). Results are shown in Table 4.

QC results for the VITEK 2 AST-Yeast Micafungin (manual dilution method) with C.
parapsilos were within the bioMerieux proposed range ≥ 95% of the time, with the
exception of one reference method at 24 hour read with C. parapsilosis which had QC
results of 98.% (69/70). The range for Micafungin’s quality control organism, C.
parapsilosis ATCC 22019, was estimated utilizing the CLSI Range Finder MIC tool. The
C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019 Micafungin proposed QC range with the VITEK 2
instrument was determined to be 0.25-1. A summary of the QC performance of C.
parapsilosis ATCC 22012 is provided in Tables 4-5 below.

Internal Validation Study
Once the new QC range for C. prapsilosis ATCC 22019 was established, an internal
validation study was performed to demonstrate that users will be able to obtain results
within the new established range. Quality control testing was performed using four
different inoculum of C. parapsilosis strain each day of testing to obtain 20 results (4
inoculum x 5 days =20 QC results). All the results were within the new QC range
(0.25-1) established for C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019 and Micafungin test. The
results showed 100% of the results (20/20) were within the new range.
Expected values/Reference range:
FDA Interpretive Criteria for Micafungin are the same as in K151923. Please refer to
K151923 for FDA/CLSI Interpretive Criteria for Micafungin.
Device Labeling Changes:
The data included in this submission validates the sponsor’s proposal to remove the
following statements from the device instructions for use:
1. Revise QC organism C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019 Micafungin MIC range from
0.5-2 µg/mL to 0.25-1 µg/mL (bMx-US)
2. Remove the following footnote from under the QC table:
“**FDA/CLSI@24H=FDA/CLSI Broth Microdilution expected QC range at 24h”
and replace with footnote “**bMx-US=bioMerieux QC range for US”.
Conclusion
The Labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device
