Procedures; Approved Guideline - Second Edition.
L. Test Principle:
The methodology of the test system involves measurement of a 400 MHz proton NMR
spectrum on a plasma or serum sample. The NMR spectra generated by the Vantera Clinical
Analyzer can be used to simultaneously quantify total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL
cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B. The sample is diluted 1:2 with NMR Diluent 1. The NMR
spectrum consists of multiple proton signals from the triglycerides, cholesteryl esters and free
cholesterol present in chylomicrons, VLDL, LDL and HDL in the combined methylene and
methyl region (0.56 – 1.40 ppm). The NMR signals from these lipoproteins have distinctive
frequencies and line shapes, and the amplitude of the NMR signal is proportional to the
concentration. The quantitative results are generated based on a Partial Least Squares
regression method using spectral information.
M. Performance Characteristics:

In some instances when analyzing the variance by mixed effects model the result was
a negative number, and therefore the contribution was considered negligible and the
variance set to 0.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was conducted on the Extended Lipid Panel Assay following the
recommendations in the CLSI EP06-A guideline. The linearity was assessed using
pooled serum samples spanning the target analyte concentration range which were
prepared by combining volumes from three pools; low pool, mid pool, and high pool.
A total of 15 samples for total cholesterol, 13 samples for Apolipoprotein B, 17
samples for triglycerides, and 12 samples for HDL cholesterol were prepared for the
linearity assessment. For each sample 4 replicates were tested by one operator using
one instrument. The mean values of four replicates of each pool were compared to
the expected target values to determine the deviation from linearity. For all samples
the deviation from linearity was less than 10%. The linear regression results are
given in the table below:
Analyte Slope Intercept R2
Total cholesterol 1.010 -1.851 1.000
Triglycerides 0.999 -1.086 1.000
HDL cholesterol 1.063 -1.925 1.000
Apolipoprotein B 0.985 -1.668 0.999
Based on these results, the sponsor concluded that the linearity data supported the
claimed analytical measurement range for total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL
cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B:
· 66 to 868 mg/dL for total cholesterol
· 35 to 950 mg/dL for triglycerides
· 14 to 152 mg/dL for HDL cholesterol
· 35 to 366 mg/dL for apolipoprotein B
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Extended Lipid Panel Assay for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides,
and apolipoproteins B is traceable to internal instrument standards.
The Extended Lipid Panel Assay is CRMLN certified for total cholesterol using
serum samples. The total cholesterol assay is traceable to the National Reference
System for Cholesterol.

d. Detection limit:
Determination of the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of
Quantification (LoQ) for the Extended Lipid Panel Assay were conducted following
the recommendations in the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
Limit of Blank:
The LoB study followed a classical protocol and utilized 5 different pools of human
serum albumin solution free of analyte. Each pool was tested in 4 replicates over a
three day period using one instrument by one operator for a total 60 measurements.
Using the parametric approach, LoB was derived from the 95th percentile of a normal
distribution.
Limit of Detection:
The LoD study followed a classical protocol and utilized 5 different serum pools
which were diluted 20-fold using human serum albumin solution. Each pool was
tested in 4 replicates per day on one instrument by one operator for three days for a
total of 60 measurements. The data was analyzed to calculate the LoD using a
parametric analysis recommended in the CLSI guideline EP17-A2.
Limit of Quantification:
The LoQ study followed an approach similar to the LoD study. Five 5 serum pools
with low concentrations were tested in replicates of 4 over 3 days on one instrument
and one operator for a total of 12 measurements per pool. The sponsor defined the
LoQ as the lowest analyte concentration where the %CV was ≤ 20%. The detection
limit results are summarized as follows:

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing on the Extended Lipid Panel Assay was evaluated following the
recommendations in the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. Serum samples at two analyte
concentrations near the medical decision concentrations were evaluated for each
substance. The samples were divided into two aliquots: control with no added
interferent and test with added interferent. Each sample was measured in 2 replicates.
The study tested for possible interference from common endogenous substances, and
exogenous substances such as medications or supplements likely to be used by the
target patient population. The interferent concentrations were selected using the
criteria recommended in CLSI EP7-A2. The following tables list the concentration of
each substance at which no significant interference was detected; defined as a
difference of less than or equal ±10% between the test sample and control.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To establish the accuracy of the Extended Lipid Panel Assay, a method comparison
study was conducted to evaluate the analytical agreement to a comparator method for
each of the 4 analytes. Serum samples were tested in singlicate on the Vantera
Clinical Analyzer and the comparator methods. The results of the method
comparison studies are summarized as follows.

Predicted Bias at Medical Decision Points
An estimate of the predicated bias at the medical decision points was calculated as the
percent difference between the regression line and the unity line at each medical
decision point.

b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was conducted on matched specimens collected in 4
different blood collection tube types; see table below. The NMR LipoTube (cleared
in k960858) was the comparator in the study and was used to collect specimens for all
the above analytical studies.
Specimen Type Collection Tube
Plasma EDTA
Plasma Sodium heparin
Serum Plain
Serum Gel barrier / NMR LipoTube
EDTA plasma, sodium heparin plasma, and serum samples (47 native and 5
contrived) were analyzed in singlicate on the Vantera Clinical Analyzer for total
cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and Apolipoprotein B. These were
compared to the results from testing specimens collected using the NMR LipoTube
measured in duplicate. The matrix comparison results were analyzed by Deming
regression and are given in the table below:

Based on the study data, serum collected from the NMR LipoTube or a plain tube is
the acceptable specimen type when simultaneously quantifying all four analytes.
Sodium heparin plasma is an acceptable specimen type for total cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol, and triglycerides. EDTA plasma is an acceptable specimen type for HDL
cholesterol and triglycerides. The product labeling states that serum and plasma
specimens drawn in gel barrier collection tubes other than the NMR LipoTube are
unsuitable for analysis and should not be used.
