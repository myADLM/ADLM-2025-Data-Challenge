4. Special instrument requirements:
None
I. Device Description:
The H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test utilizes antibodies specific for H. pylori antigen in human
fecal samples. The Membrane Device contains a “Reaction Window” with two vertical lines
of immobilized antibodies. The test line (“T”) contains antibodies specific for H. pylori
antigen. The control line (“C”) contains antibodies to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The
“Conjugate” consists of antibodies to H. pylori antigen coupled to horseradish peroxidase.
After incubation, the Reaction Window is examined visually for the appearance of vertical
blue lines on the “C” and “T” sides of the Reaction Window. A blue line on the “T” side of
the Reaction Window indicates a positive result. A positive “C” reaction, indicated by a
vertical blue line on the “C” side of the Reaction Window, confirms that the sample and
reagents were added correctly, the reagents were active at the time of performing the assay,
and that the sample migrated properly through the Membrane Device. It also confirms the
reactivity of the other reagents associated with the assay.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test was determined using an
eight member masked fecal specimen panel. The panel consisted of 2 negative, 2 high
negative (just below C5), 2 low positive (just above LoD), and 2 moderate positive
(3-4x higher than the C95) specimens. Each fecal specimen was spiked using a
known concentration of H. pylori purified flagellar antigen from whole organism to
achieve the desired concentration. Testing was performed at 2 independent
laboratories and on-site at TECHLAB, Inc. The Specimens were tested twice a day in
triplicate over a five day period by multiple technicians at each site using two
different kit lots. Positive and negative controls were run with each sample panel of
masked specimens. The result from each laboratory were submitted to TECHLAB
Inc. and compared. The results for the positive control, negative control, true
negative, low positive, and moderate positive, was consistent among all three
locations with100% reproducibility for all test panels. The high negative provided a
positive result 63 out of 180 observations.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Sample stability study:
The effect of specimen storage on antigen stability was evaluated for both fresh stool
samples and stool samples in transport media. The following transport media were
used for the study: Thermo Scientific Protocol Cary Blair media and Thermo
Scientific Protocol C&S media. For the analysis, a total of 32 fecal specimens were
tested with the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test. The samples were prepared using a
negative fecal matrix and spiked with H. pylori antigen (ATCC strain 43526). The
panel consisted of 2 negative, 5 high negative (C ), 10 low positive (1-2x C ), and 15
5 95
positive specimens covering the range of the test (For fresh and preserved specimens
this range was 50 ng/mL – 1200 ng/mL).
Fresh samples were stored at refrigerated temperatures (between 2ºC and 8ºC) and
room temperatures (between 20ºC and 25ºC) and were tested at 0, 24, 48,72 and 96
hours. Positive and negative controls were also tested at each timepoint.
Fecal specimens added to Cary Blair and C&S media were transported as
recommended in their respective package inserts; samples were stored at refrigerated
temperatures (between 2ºC and 8ºC) and room temperatures (between 20ºC and 25ºC)
and were tested at 24 hour intervals from 0 to 96 hours.
5

--- Page 6 ---
For fresh samples stored at refrigerated and room temperatures, the positive and
negative samples gave the expected results 100% of the time. Storage in Cary Blair
and C&S transport media did not affect the stability of the samples. Based on these
results, the recommended storage time for fresh, Cary Blair, and C&S stored samples
is up to 96 hours when stored between 2ºC and 8ºC and between 20ºC and 25ºC.
Frozen sample stability study:
Stability of frozen fecal matrix samples compared to fresh samples was established
using the 32 masked fecal specimen panel prepared as described for the storage
stability study. Samples were not diluted into transport media for this study. Samples
were stored at < -10ºC or < -70ºC for 14 days. Specimens were tested at 0, 5, 10, and
14 days. The results showed that all positive samples remained positive and negative
samples remained negative throughout the study.
Freeze/Thaw study:
A study was conducted to determine stability after 3 freeze/thaw cycles using the 32-
masked fecal specimen panel described for the storage stability study. Samples were
not diluted into transport media for this study. The results showed that up to 3
freeze/thaw cycles neither enhanced nor impaired the performance of the H. PYLORI
QUIK CHEK test. Therefore, the package insert will indicate that if samples are not
tested fresh, frozen stool samples may be tested and may undergo up to no more than
2 freeze/thaw cycles.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) for the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test was determined by
spiking purified flagellar antigen into unpreserved (raw stool) and preserved (Cary
Blair and C&S media) stool samples. The concentrations are reported in ng/mL and
by factoring in the dilutions and the final volume used in the assay. The LoD is the
concentrations of the antigen that yields a positive result 95% of the time and a
negative result 5% of the time. Table 1 lists the LoD values for antigen spiked in
negative fecal matrix, Cary Blair, and C&S transport media.

Prospective study
Initial Diagnosis
The performance of the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test was evaluated by conducting a
multi-site prospective clinical study. Six independent sites were included, five of
which collected specimens from patients suspected of H. pylori infection. The sixth
site, TECHLAB, did not conduct specimen collection. Of these five collection sites,
three conducted testing using both the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test and the
composite reference method (CRM). The remaining two sites performed CRM testing
and sent samples to TECHLAB for testing using the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test.
The CRM for diagnosis of H. pylori infection is based on endoscopy obtained gastric
biopsy. The biopsied tissue was tested for the presence of H. pylori by histology, or
rapid urease test. The sensitivity and specificity for the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test
was determined using the CRM.
Prospective testing consisted of 205 stool specimens collected from the patients with
symptoms of dyspepsia, gastritis, or peptic ulcer who were scheduled to undergo
endoscopy with gastric biopsy as part of routine care (Initial Diagnosis Group). Of
these, 83 patients were excluded either because they were on a treatment regimen
[i.e., proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), or antibiotics] or had samples with CRM results
that were rapid urease positive but histology negative. The remaining 122 patients
who were not taking PPIs or antibiotics at the time of specimen collection were
considered for final analysis. These specimens were tested at the following five sites:
Carilion Clinic, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Bangladesh,
Mayo Clinic, University of Virginia, Kliniken Essen-Mitte, and TECHLAB
(internal).

The ages of patients ranged from less than 19 years to 82 years with 100% of the
specimens coming from patients were > 18 years. Of the 122 patients tested 64%
were female and 34% were male. No difference in test performance was observed
based on patient age or gender. The results are provided in Table 3 which shows the
clinical performance of the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test for all 6 test sites combined.
The results of the study show that the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test exhibited a
sensitivity of 97.0%, and a specificity of 100% compared to the CRM.

result.
Post Therapy Diagnosis
Eradication (post-therapy) evaluation was conducted on patients enrolled
prospectively at 3 sites. A total of 9 specimens were collected at least 4 weeks after
completion of the treatment regimen. Post therapy evaluation was conducted using a
two-step algorithm of patient analysis. First, patients were screened for the continued
presence of H. pylori using an FDA-cleared stool antigen test. Positive patients were
reflexed to a follow-up endoscopy and biopsy analysis by rapid urease test and
histology. The results are provided in Table 4 which shows the clinical performance
of the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test for all 6 test sites combined. The results of the
study show that the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test exhibited a sensitivity of 100.0%
compared to the CRM.

Retrospective study
A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate performance and to augment the
prospective clinical study. Testing of retrospective samples was conducted at
TECHLAB.
To provide assurance that the retrospective samples are representative of wide range
of OD readings, CRM positives samples and retrospective positive samples were both
tested by an FDA cleared ELISA. The distribution and mean OD values obtained
from the retrospective study, n = 200 samples, were compared to those values
obtained from CRM positive samples, n = 46, to ensure that the use of retrospective
sample results reflects the OD distribution of CRM positive samples. This analysis
demonstrated that the use of retrospective and prospective clinical samples has
similar distributions and no concern of bias was noted.
The performance of the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test was evaluated by testing
retrospective samples at TECHLAB. Retrospective testing consisted of 200 frozen
stool specimens (94 positive and 106 negative by an FDA Cleared ELISA) obtained
from sample repositories. Positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent
agreement (NPA) for the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test was determined by comparing
to an FDA Cleared ELISA that was tested concurrently. The results of the study
show that the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test exhibited a PPA of 98.9% and a NPA of
97.2% with an FDA Cleared ELISA. The results are shown in Table 5.
