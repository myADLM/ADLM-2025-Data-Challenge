1. Intended use(s):
The TECHLAB H. PYLORI CHEK test is an enzyme immunoassay for the
qualitative detection of Helicobacter pylori specific antigen. It is intended for use
with human fecal specimens to aid in the diagnosis of H. pylori infection and to
demonstrate loss of H. pylori antigen following treatment. The test can be used with
unpreserved fecal specimens and fecal specimens preserved in transport media from
patients suspected of H. pylori infection. Testing of patients to demonstrate loss of
H. pylori antigen following treatment should be performed no sooner than 4 weeks
after completion of the treatment regimen. Test results should be taken into
consideration by the physician in conjunction with the patient history and symptoms.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as the Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
A spectrophotometric plate reader capable of reading the following wavelengths: 450 nm
or 450/620 nm.
I. Device Description:
The H. PYLORI CHEK test uses antibodies specific to H. pylori infection. The “Microassay
Plate” in the kit contains immobilized capture antibodies against H. pylori antigen. The
“Conjugate” consists of antibodies specific to H. pylori antigen conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase (HRP). In the assay, an aliquot of diluted fecal specimen is transferred to a
microassay well containing the Conjugate. If the antigen is present in the specimen, it will
bind to the Conjugate and to the immobilized capture antibody during the incubation phase.
Any unbound material is removed during the washing steps. Following the addition of the
“Substrate”, a color is detected due to the enzyme-antibody-antigen complexes that formed in
the presence of antigen. The color if positive is a yellow color that may be read visually or by
using a spectrophotometer at the following wavelengths: 450 nm or 450/620 nm.

antigen (ATCC strain 43526) to achieve the desired level. The specimens were tested
twice per day over a 12-day period by multiple technicians using two different kit
lots. By spectrophotometric analysis using dual OD (450/620 nm wavelenght),
positive specimens tested positive 98.3% of the time and negative specimens tested
negative 97.8% of the time. By visual read, positive specimens tested positive 93.1%
of the time and negative specimens tested negative 94.8% of the time.
The reproducibility of the H. PYLORI CHEK test was determined using the same 8-
member fecal specimen panel as described for the precision study. Testing was
performed at 2 independent laboratories and on-site at TECHLAB, Inc. The panel
members were tested twice a day, in triplicate, over a five-day period by multiple
technicians at each site using two different kit lots. Positive and negative controls
were run with each sample panel of masked specimens. The results from each
laboratory were submitted to TECHLAB, Inc. and compared with in-house results.
The results were consistent among all three locations and produced the expected
results (by dual OD) for the positive and negative samples 97.5% and 97.5% of time,
respectively. By visual read, positive specimens tested positive 96.9% of the time and
negative specimens tested negative 92.8% of the time
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Sample stability study:
The effect of specimen storage on antigen stability was evaluated for both fresh stool
samples and stool amples in transport media. The following transport media were
used for the study: Thermo Scientific Protocol Cary Blair media and Thermo
Scientific Protocol C&S media. For the analysis, a total of 32 fecal specimens were
tested with the H. PYLORI CHEK test. The samples were prepared using a negative
fecal matrix and spiked with H. pylori antigen (ATCC strain 43526). The panel
consisted of 2 negative, 5 high negative (C ), 10 low positive (1-2x C ), and 15
5 95
positive specimens covering the range of the test (For fresh, unpreserved specimens,
this range was 50 ng/mL – 1200 ng/mL).
Fresh samples were stored at refrigerated temperatures (between 2ºC and 8ºC) and
room temperatures (between 20ºC and 25ºC) and were tested at 0, 24, 48,72 and 96
hours. Positive and negative controls were also tested at each timepoint.
Fecal specimens added to Cary Blair and C&S media were transported as
recommended in their respective package inserts; samples were stored at refrigerated
temperatures (between 2ºC and 8ºC) and room temperatures (between 20ºC and 25ºC)
and were tested at 24 hour intervals from 0 to 96 hours.
5

--- Page 6 ---
For fresh samples stored at refrigerated and room temperatures, the positive and
negative samples gave the expected results 96.8% and 99.1% of the time,
respectively. Storage in Cary Blair transport media did not affect the stability of the
samples. Storage in C&S transport media did not affect the stability of samples stored
at room temperature, but a slight decrease in sample stability was observed at
refrigerated temperatures. Specifically, 93.8% of samples yielded the expected results
when stored in C&S transport media at refrigerated temperatures. Based on these
results, the recommended storage time for fresh, Cary Blair, and C&S stored samples
is up to 96 hours when stored between 2ºC and 8ºC and between 20ºC and 25ºC.
Frozen sample stability study
Stability of frozen fecal matrix samples compared to fresh samples was established
using the 32 masked fecal specimen panel prepared as described for the storage
stability study. Samples were not diluted into transport media for this study. Samples
were stored at < -10ºC or < -70ºC for 14 days. Specimens were tested at 0, 5, 10, and
14 days. The results showed that all positive samples remained positive and negative
samples remained negative throughout the study.
Freeze/Thaw study
A study was conducted to determine stability after 3 freeze/thaw cycles using the 32-
masked fecal specimen panel described for the storage stability study. Samples were
not diluted into transport media for this study. The results showed that up to 3
freeze/thaw cycles neither enhanced nor impaired the performance of the H. PYLORI
CHEK test. Therefore, the package insert will indicate that if samples are not tested
fresh, frozen stool samples may be tested and may undergo up to no more than 2
freeze/thaw cycles.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) for the H. PYLORI CHEK test was determined by
spiking purified flagellar antigen from H. pylori (ATCC strain 43526) into negative
fecal matrix and Cary Blair and C&S transport media. The LoD is defined as the
concentration of H. pylori antigen that yields a positive result 95% of the time and a
negative result 5% of the time. The LoD was determined as the concentration that
provided the correct result 95% of the time based on testing dilutions of antigen in a
negative fecal sample matrix, in replicates of 24 for two sets. LoD testing was read at
both single (450 nm) and dual (450/620 nm) wavelength reads. The LoD values were
similar between single wavelength reads and dual wavelength reads, however single
wavelength reads trended slightly higher for some, but not all, sample types. Table 1
lists the LoD values based on a dual wavelength reading for antigen spiked in
negative fecal matrix, Cary Blair, and C&S transport media.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity
The H. PYLORI CHEK test was evaluated for cross-reactivity with the bacteria, fungi,
and viruses listed below. H. pylori purified flagellar antigen (ATCC strain 43526)
was spiked in at 2-3 x LoD. H. pylori was spiked into clinical matrix that was
negative for H. pylori. Bacteria and fungi were spiked at concentration of >108
CFU/mL and viruses at a range from 103.3 to 108.25 TCID50 units per 0.2 mL. Due to
safety concerns for Listeria monocytogenes, freeze-dried biomaterial from ATCC was
reconstituted at >1x104 CFU/mL in PBS and spiked with purified H. pylori flagellar
antigen (ATCC strain 43526) at 2-3X LoD. No bacteria, fungi, or viruses tested
showed interference with the performance of the H. PYLORI CHEK test.

f. Assay cut-off:
The following cut off-values and result interpretation criteria were established for the
spectrophotometric single and dual wavelength reading methods:
Spectrophotometric Single Wavelength (450 nm)
Negative: <0.120
Positive: >0.120
Negative Control: <0.120
Positive Control: >0.500
Spectrophotometric Dual Wavelength (450/620 nm)
Negative: <0.080
Positive: >0.080
Negative Control: <0.080
Positive Control: >0.500
The following result interpretation criteria were established for the visual reading
method:
Visual Reading
Negative = Colorless to very faint yellow color
Positive = Definitive yellow color
A positive result indicates that H. pylori antigens were detected. A negative result
indicates that no H. pylori antigens were detected, or that the antigen levels are below
what can be detected by the assay.
g. Prozone/Hook Effect:
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that a high concentration of H. pylori
antigen does not interfere with a positive reaction in the H. PYLORI CHEK test. High
concentration samples were prepared by spiking negative fecal matrix with H. pylori
antigen at 12 ug/mL (i.e. 10x the highest concentration observed in a positive clinical
sample). A total of 5 different dilutions were prepared from the contrived sample.
Samples were prepared by spiking the following concentrations of antigen into a
negative fecal pool: 12 ug/mL, 6 ug/mL, 2.4 ug/mL, 1.2 ug/mL, 0.6 ug/mL and 0.12
ug/mL. Testing was performed in triplicate according to the Package Insert
instructions. The results demonstrated that there was no overall hook effect, and that
elevated levels of H. pylori antigen did not affect the test results.

a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Prospective study
Initial Diagnosis:
The performance of the H. PYLORI CHEK test was evaluated by conducting a multi-
site prospective clinical study. Six independent sites were included, five of which
collected specimens from patients suspected of H. pylori infection. The sixth site,
TECHLAB, did not conduct specimen collection. Of these five collection sites, three
conducted testing using both the H. PYLORI CHEK test and the composite reference
method (CRM). The remaining two sites performed CRM testing and sent samples to
TECHLAB for testing using the H. PYLORI CHEK test. The CRM for diagnosis of
H. pylori infection is based on endoscopally obtained gastric biopsy. The biopsied
tissue was tested for the presence of H. pylori by histology or rapid urease test. The
sensitivity and specificity for the H. PYLORI CHEK test was determined using the
CRM.
Prospective testing consisted of 176 stool specimens collected from the patients with
symptoms of dyspepsia, gastritis, or peptic ulcer who were scheduled to undergo
endoscopy with gastric biopsy as part of routine care (Initial Diagnosis Group). Of
these, 67 patients were excluded either because they were on a treatment regimen
[i.e., proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), or antibiotics] or had samples with CRM results
that were rapid urease positive but histology negative. The remaining 109 patients,
who were not taking PPIs or antibiotics at the time of specimen collection, were
considered for final analysis. These specimens were tested at the following five sites:
Carilion Clinic, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Bangladesh,
Mayo Clinic, University of Virginia, Kliniken Essen-Mitte, and TECHLAB
(internal). Reading of the H. PYLORI CHEK was conducted by dual wavelength
spectrophotometric analysis and by visual reading of the “Microassay Plate” for color
change.
The ages of patients ranged from 19 to 82 years with 100% of the specimens coming
from patients that were >18 years. Of the 109 patients tested, 66% were female and
34% were male. No difference in test performance was observed based on patient age
or gender. The results are provided in Table 3, which shows the clinical performance
of the H. PYLORI CHEK test for all 6 test sites combined. The results of the study
show that the H. PYLORI CHEK test, by dual spectrophotometric analysis, exhibited
a sensitivity of 100%, and a specificity of 96.1% compared to the CRM. Testing was
also conducted by visual reading of “Microassay Plates”. Visual results were the
same as dual wavelength spectrophotometric results 99% of the time.

Post-Therapy Diagnosis:
Eradication (post-therapy) evaluation was conducted on patients enrolled
prospectively at 3 sites. A total of 9 specimens were collected at least 4 weeks after
completion of the treatment regimen. Post-therapy evaluation was conducted using a
two-step algorithm of patient analysis. First, patients were screened for the continued
presence of H. pylori using an FDA-cleared ELISA . Positive patients were reflexed
to a follow-up endoscopy and biopsy analysis by rapid urease test and histology. The
results are provided in Table 4, which shows the clinical performance of the H.
PYLORI CHEK test for all 6 test sites combined. The results of the study show that
the H. PYLORI CHEK test exhibited a sensitivity of 77.8% compared to the CRM.

The ages of patients ranged from 33 years to 72 years. Of the 9 patients tested, 6 were
female and 3 were male.
Retrospective study
A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate performance and to augment the
prospective clinical study. Testing of retrospective samples was conducted at
TECHLAB.
To provide assurance that the retrospective samples are representative of a wide range
of OD readings, CRM positive samples and retrospective positive samples were both
tested by an FDA cleared ELISA. The distribution and mean OD values obtained
from the retrospective study, n= 75 samples, were compared to those values obtained
from CRM positive samples, n=42, to ensure that the use of retrospective sample
results reflects the OD distribution of CRM positive samples. This analysis
demonstrated that the use of retrospective and prospective clinical samples have
similar distributions and no concern of bias was noted.
Thee performance of the H. PYLORI CHEK test was evaluated by testing
retrospective samples at TECHLAB. Retrospective testing consisted of 196 frozen
stool samples (75 positive and 121 negative by an FDA-cleared ELISA) obtained
from sample repositories. Positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent
agreement (NPA) for the H. PYLORI CHEK test was determined by comparing to an
FDA Cleared ELISA that was tested concurrently. The results of the study show that
the H. PYLORI CHEK test exhibited a PPA of 100% and a NPA of 100% with an
FDA cleared ELISA. The results are shown in Table 5.
