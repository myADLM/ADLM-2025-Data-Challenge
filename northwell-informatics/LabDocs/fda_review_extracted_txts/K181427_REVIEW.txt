H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel performed on the BD MAX System, is an automated
in vitro diagnostic test for the direct qualitative detection and differentiation of enteric
viral pathogens. The BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel detects nucleic acids from
• Norovirus GI & GII
• Rotavirus A
• Adenovirus F40/41
• Sapovirus (genogroups I, II, IV, V)
• Human Astrovirus (hAstro)
Testing is performed on unpreserved soft to diarrheal or Cary-Blair preserved stool
specimens from symptomatic patients with suspected acute gastroenteritis, enteritis or
colitis. The test is performed directly on the specimen, utilizing real-time polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) for the amplification of relevant gene target DNA/RNA. The test
utilizes fluorogenic gene-specific hybridization probes for the detection of the amplified
DNA.
This test is intended for use, in conjunction with clinical presentation, laboratory
findings, and epidemiological information, as an aid in the differentialdiagnosis of
Norovirus GI & GII, Rotavirus A, Adenovirus F40/41, Sapovirus (genogroups I, II, IV,
V), and Astrovirus infections. Results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for
diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions. Positive results do not rule
out co-infection with other organisms that are not detected by this test, and may not be
the sole or definitive cause of patient illness. Negative results in the setting of clinical
illness compatible with gastroenteritis may be due to infection by pathogens that are not
detected by this test or non-infectious causes such as ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel
syndrome, or Crohn’s disease.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
Limitations:

I. Device Description:
The BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel performed on the BD MAX System, is an automated in
vitro diagnostic test for the direct qualitative detection and differentiation of enteric viral
pathogens. The BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel detects nucleic acids from
• Norovirus GI & GII
• Rotavirus A
• Adenovirus F40/41
• Sapovirus (genogroups I, II, IV, V)
• Human Astrovirus (hAstro)
Testing is performed on unpreserved soft to diarrheal or Cary-Blair preserved stool
specimens from symptomatic patients with suspected acute gastroenteritis, enteritis or colitis.
The test is performed directly on the specimen, utilizing real-time polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) for the amplification of relevant gene target DNA/RNA. The test utilizes fluorogenic
gene-specific hybridization probes for the detection of the amplified DNA.
The BD MAX System and the BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel is run with the instrument,
associated hardware and accessories, disposable microfluidic cartridges, master mixes,
unitized reagent strips, extraction reagents, and sample buffer tubes. The instrument
automates sample preparation including target lysis, DNA/RNA extraction and
concentration, reagent rehydration, and target nucleic acid amplification and detection using
real-time PCR. The assay includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC) that is present in the
Extraction Tube. The SPC monitors DNA/RNA extraction steps, thermal cycling steps,
reagent integrity and the presence of inhibitory substances. The BD MAX System software
automatically interprets test results. A test result may be called as POS (Positive), NEG
(Negative), or UNR (Unresolved) for each of the assay’s targets, based on the amplification
status of the target and of the Sample Processing Control. IND (Indeterminate) or INC
(Incomplete) results are due to BD MAX System failure.

Interpretation of Results
Targets amplified by both mastermixes D6 and D5 are detected with hydrolysis probes
(TaqMan probes) labelled at one end with a fluorescent reporter dye and at the other end with
a quencher moiety. Six separate probes labelled with different reporter dyes are used to
detect, in four different BD MAX System optical channels, the amplicons generated by their
respective primers for MM D6 Enteric Viral Panel targets (Astrovirus, Sapovirus, and a
sample processing control) and eight probes for MM D5 Enteric Viral Panel targets
(Adenovirus, Norovirus, Rotavirus, and a sample processing control). The BD MAX System
monitors several amplification curve metrics including: the fluorescence height at the end of
the amplification curve (EP fluorescence), the location and value of the curve’s first
derivative, the location and value of the curve’s second derivative, the threshold cycle value
with an additional quality control applied to prevent false positives due to signal drift
(Ct.Score), and measurements of system noise along the PCR amplification curve. Curve
metrics are transformed into results via comparison of the metrics to cutoffs and the use of
logic statements. Specifically, cutoffs are applied to the Ct.Score and EP values to determine
amplification status with other metrics serving as quality controls.
Results are available on the “Results” tab in the “Results” window on the BD MAX System
monitor. The BD MAX System software automatically interprets test results. Results are
4

--- Page 5 ---
reported for each of the analytes and for the Sample Processing Control. A test result may be
called as NEG (negative), POS (positive) or UNR (unresolved) based on the amplification
status of the target and of the Sample Processing Control. IND (Indeterminate) or INC
(Incomplete) results are due to BD MAX System failure and require sample repeat testing. A
sample can be re-tested directly from the already prepared Sample Buffer Tube or following
the preparation of a new Sample Buffer Tube inoculation. In the case of a partial UNR,
where one or more targets have a POS result and all other targets have a UNR result, the
targets with a UNR result will not be called NEG. This will be reported on a per Master Mix
basis.
Erroneous results may occur from improper specimen collection, handling, storage, technical
error, specimen mix-up or because the number of organisms in the specimen is below the
analytical sensitivity of the test.
The Sample Processing Control has been added to the test to aid in the identification of
samples that contain inhibitors to PCR amplification and as a control for reagent integrity and
of the assay system as a whole. The Sample Processing Control does not indicate if nucleic
acid has been lost due to inadequate collection, transport or storage of samples, or whether
viral capsids have been adequately lysed.

MAX Enteric Viral Panel Unitized Reagent Strip and PCR Cartridge, the run is started and
no further operator intervention is required. The BD MAX System automates specimen
preparation, including target organism lysis, DNA/RNA extraction and concentration,
reagent rehydration, target nucleic acid sequence amplification and detection using real-time
PCR. The interpretation of the signal is performed automatically by the BD MAX System.
The assay also includes a Sample Processing Control that is provided in the Extraction Tube
and subjected to extraction, concentration and amplification steps. The Sample Processing
Control monitors for the presence of potential inhibitory substances as well as system or
reagent failures. Following enzymatic viral lysis at an elevated temperature, the released
nucleic acids are captured by magnetic affinity beads.
The beads, with the bound nucleic acids, are washed and the nucleic acids are eluted. Eluted
DNA/RNA is neutralized and transferred to the Master Mix tubes to rehydrate the PCR
reagents. After rehydration, the BD MAX System dispenses a fixed volume of PCR-ready
solution into the BD MAX PCR Cartridge. Microvalves in the BD MAX PCR Cartridge are
sealed by the system to prevent evaporation and amplicon contamination prior to the
initiation of reverse transcriptase PCR to convert RNA to cDNA and subsequent real time
PCR.
The amplified DNA targets are detected using hydrolysis (TaqMan) probes labeled at one
end with a fluorescent reporter dye (fluorophore) and at the other end with a quencher
moiety. Probes labeled with different fluorophores are used to detect the amplicons of the
viral targets (Norovirus GI & GII, Rotavirus A, Adenovirus F40/41, Sapovirus (genogroups
I, II, IV, V), and hAstro) and the Sample Processing Control amplicons in four different
optical channels of the BD MAX System. When the probes are in their native state, the
fluorescence of the fluorophore is quenched due to its proximity to the quencher. However,
in the presence of target DNA, the probes hybridize to their complementary sequences and
are hydrolyzed by the 5’–3’ exonuclease activity of the DNA polymerase as it synthesizes the
nascent strand along the cDNA template. As a result, the fluorophores are separated from the
quencher molecules and fluorescence is emitted. The BD MAX System monitors these
signals at each cycle and interprets the data at the end of the program to report the final
results.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility panel utilized in all of the precision/reproducibility studies
consisted of 18 individual members. Three members of the panel contained no
analytes. Each of the 15 remaining panel members consisted of one viral pathogen at
low positive levels (2x LoD) and one viral pathogen at moderate positive levels (3x
LoD) with all other viral targets absent. In total, each individual viral target of the
Enteric Viral Panel was represented with 3 low positive (LP), 3 moderate positive
(MP) and 12 true negative (TN) samples. However, the combination of each analyte
9

--- Page 10 ---
per panel member is fixed. For example, the moderate positive Rotavirus specimens
always contain low positive Norovirus. And the moderate positive Sapovirus samples
always contain low positive Rotavirus. Proposed acceptance criteria included ≥95%
agreement with expected results for all low positive specimens and 100% agreement
with expected results for all moderate positive and true negative specimens. All study
results met the acceptance criteria for all targets and all categories.
For the Site-to-Site Reproducibility study, a single lot of reagents was tested over the
course of 5 days at three sites. Two users each completed a single run of 18 panel
members each day for a total of 30 runs.

Point
To evaluate lot-to-lot reproducibility, three lots of reagents were tested over five days
at a single site. Two operators performed two runs per day for a total of 30 runs.
Results from five days of the precision study were used as the final lot for analysis of
lot-to-lot reproducibility. All lot-to-lot study results met the acceptance criteria for all
targets and all categories.
The cycle end point fluorescence values typically have high standard deviations but
also high absolute magnitudes (700-5,000) compared to the cut-off threshold for these
values to make a positive call (70-200). A high degree of the observed variance is due
to higher value outliers among a pool of relatively consistent datapoints that do not
approach the threshold cutoff for these analytes.

The precision study utilized only 12 of the 18 original reproducibility panel members.
A single lot of reagents were tested over 12 days at a single site with two users
completing a single run on each day of the study. The composition of the panel
included true negative (TN), low positive (LP), and moderate positive (MP)
reactivities for each analyte. A total of 24 runs were performed.

Again, quantitative analysis was performed on numerical PCR metrics from the
precision study (Table 6) and while the Cycle EP values do sometimes exhibit high
variance, especially in low positive panel members, this is usually due to the presence
of higher value outliers. No values are near the cutoff threshold for each analyte.

The largest Ct.Score variability observed during the quantitative Precision study
segment (among TN, LP and MP) was obtained for the Adenovirus target, which
obtained a 2.1% overall variability for the LP and MP. Overall variability values for
Ct.Score obtained for the other targets ranged between 0.9% and 1.8%. In Cycle EP,
variability for the LP and MP ranged from 15.5% to 64.7%.

Specimen Stability:
According to the package insert, specimens can be stored for up to 120 hours (5
days) at 2-8°C or for up to 48 hours at 2-25°C before testing. Similarly, prepared
SBTs can be stored at 2-8°C for a maximum of 120 hours (5 days) OR at 2-25°C
for a maximum of 48 hours. Studies to support this stability claim for both Cary-
Blair preserved and unpreserved stool specimens followed the below scheme
(Tables 7 & 8):

A minimum of twenty valid replicates for positives and four valid replicates for
negatives were required for each condition tested. Baseline testing was required to
yield 100% (20/20) positive replicates and 100% (4/4) negative replicates. Each
subsequent test point was required to yield ≥ 95% (19/20) positive replicates and
100% (4/4) negative replicates. Additionally, a trend of the quantitative PCR curve
metrics for each channel over time was modeled using simple linear regression
analysis. The stability break point at which the specimen was no longer considered
stable was reached when the one-sided 95% lower confidence interval of the linear
regression crossed the acceptable drift limit (“ADL”) in any channel. The ADL was
determined for each target at baseline, which was derived from the mean Ct.Score
endpoint thresholds.
Data from the specimen stability study supports claims in the package insert, with
no observed change in sample status (Table 9 and Table 10) or significant loss of
cycle EP . One run of test point 4 for unpreserved stool samples included several
samples with unexpected negative results. The run was repeated to exclude sample
stability issues and this data is presented in Table 10. Regression lines of
quantitative PCR parameters were plotted with the 95% confidence interval and the

A fresh vs. frozen study was performed to demonstrate no difference in assay
performance upon repeated freeze-thaw cycles and validate the use of frozen
retrospective samples in the clinical studies. A total of 60 replicates for each analyte
present at 1.99x LoD (N = 30), 4x LoD (N = 15), and 10x LoD (N = 15) were
analyzed at baseline and after 1, 2, or 3 freeze-thaw cycles. All data agreed with the
expected results (Table 11) and the data demonstrated no significant drift in Ct
cycle values.

Internal Control Effectiveness
The sample processing control is designed to flag the user to potentially disruptive
errors in either sample extraction and nucleic acid purification or inhibition of the
PCR reaction. Samples that are reactive in the absence of a positive SPC control
signal will still be called positive; however, negative samples will be labeled
unresolved and necessitate repeat testing. To validate proper performance of the
SPC control, the sponsor performed 20 runs of the assay under normal conditions
(control), improper extraction (I), and absence of a mastermix tube (II). These
conditions were evaluated for each mastermix in the assay. All test runs agreed with
expected results except for one improper extraction sample that actually exhibited
unexpected SPC amplification (Table 12).

d. Detection limit:
Individual sample buffer tubes were spiked with the viral pathogens detected by the
BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel assay in the presence of either unpreserved or Cary-
Blair preserved stool matrix. A putative LoD was determined by testing 4 replicates
across a range of 5 analyte levels using 3 lots of assay reagents. Further confirmation
of LoD was determined by additional testing of 20 replicates near the putative LoD
levels to achieve 95% detection. The final LoD determination for each analyte in
either Unpreserved and Cary-Blair preserved stool matrix is displayed in Table 13
and Table 14, respectively.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity:
Other off-panel phylogenetically related microorganisms that may be present in
human stool were evaluated for potential Enteric Viral Panel reactivity. Specifically,
94 bacteria. ten viruses, and eight parasites were tested in three replicates using three
reagent lots and twelve BD MAX instruments (Table 15). The concentrations of
bacteria/parasites were confirmed by colony/cell count while parasites were
enumerated by the respective suppliers. Viruses were quantitated by their respective
vendor(s) and the concentrations were documented in the Certificates of Analysis.
Samples that exhibited initial reactivity or had INC or UNR results were subsequently
retested (Table 16 and Table 17). Adenovirus Type 1 was the only pathogen to
exhibit cross-reactivity, being consistently detected by the Enteric Viral Panel
adenovirus test and thus included as a cross-reactant in the package insert. This
reactivity disappeared at a tenfold lower dilution of virus.
Cross-reactivity with organisms other than those listed in the table below has not been
evaluated.

Interference
Exogenous and endogenous interfering substances were evaluated for potential
interference by spiking into unpreserved stool or Cary-Blair preserved stool matrix
containing 2x LoD concentrations of Adenovirus, Astrovirus, Rotavirus, Norovirus,
and Sapovirus. A total of 3 replicates were tested and compared to expected results
with an acceptance criteria of 100% of spiked samples showing reactivity and 100%
of organism-free samples being negative.
Hydrocortisone cream at concentrations of 50% v/v was shown to reduce sample
reactivity and was labeled as an interferant. However, repeat testing with
Hydrocortisone present at 25% v/v demonstrated 100% agreement with expected
results (Table 18). The RotaTeq live Rotavirus vaccine was also picked up by the
assay, as expected.
Potential interference has not been evaluated for substances other than those
described in the table below. Interference by substances other than those described in
the table below could lead to erroneous results.

aOne replicate resulted in partial UNR result but repeat testing resolved the issue
Mixed infection studies were carried out for each mastermix reaction with one viral
pathogen being represented at 2x LoD concentration and the other pathogens in the
same mastermix occurring at the 95th percentile concentration observed in the clinical
study. The acceptance criteria were 100% reactivity for high concentration analytes
and ≥95% reactivity for samples present at 2x LoD concentrations. All test conditions
met acceptance criteria (Table 19).

Cross-contamination (Carry-Over) Study
The sponsor analyzed a panel of alternating negative and high positive specimens to
demonstrate the absence of significant carry-over effects in the BD MAX instrument
during processing. Specifically, twelve high reactivity replicates of both Astrovirus
and Adenovirus were tested with negative samples lacking any analyte. Three runs
were performed on three instruments for a total of 108 negative and 108 high positive
samples. The final analysis determined that 2/108 expected negative samples were
reactive demonstrating a false-reactivity rate of 1.85% due to cross-contamination
effects.
Guardrail Family D and Workflow Compatibility Study
A Guardrail Family describes the list of assays that can be run together on the BD
MAX Instrument within one sample rack. Guardrail Family D follows the basic
extraction workflow for an IVD assay established in Guardrail Family A with two
major differences: it utilizes a 4-snap Unitized Reagent Strip (URS) and can
accommodate assays of either one or two Master Mix tubes.
The purpose of this challenge testing was to ensure the Enteric Viral Panel assay can
be simultaneously run with other assays utilizing the same Guardrail Family D
software parameters. Two BD MAX instruments each ran 18 Enteric Viral Panel tests
(9 positive and 9 negative) and 6 guardrail challenge tests. An additional instrument
completed a single run of 4 Enteric Viral Panel tests (2 positive and 2 negative) and 2
guardrail challenge tests. In total, 54 samples were analyzed. All data conformed to
acceptance guidelines and Enteric Viral Panel results as expected demonstrating no
interference from the Guardrail challenge tests.
Analytical Reactivity/Inclusivity Study
Inclusivity testing of the BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel included the strains listed in
Table 20. Three strains did not confirm at ≥ 95% at 3x LoD. Sapovirus GI clinical
strain BA0145AP required titration to 6x LoD before results were ≥ 95%. Sapovirus
GI clinical strain BA0141AP and Rotavirus A isolate WISC2 VR-2517 required

titration to 20x LoD before results were ≥ 95%.
Four strains of Norovirus (GI.3, GII.P16_GII.2, GII.P16_GII.4, GII.Pe_GII.4) were
unavailable for wet laboratory testing and were thus evaluated in silico for potential
sequence amplification by the Enteric Viral Panel. From gene sequences available in
the NCBI database, no significant primer or probe mismatches were identified that
would theoretically limit the detection capability of the Enteric Viral Panel for these
strains.

In silico analysis predicted that most strains of all genotypes would be detected,
though some variant strains may be detected with reduced sensitivity or may not be
detected due to inefficient amplification or exclusion by melt analysis. For Norovirus
in silico analysis, three sequences showed more than one mismatch, two GI.3 variants
and one GI.7 variant. Some Norovirus sequences showed more than two mismatches,
one GII.3 variant, one GII.4 variant, one GII.6 variant and one GII.12 variant. These
mutations could affect the detection of these variants. For Rotavirus A in silico
analysis, there were five variants that had more than three mismatches. There were
ten Rotavirus A sequences that were truncated by four nucleotides. These mutations
could affect the detection of these variants. For Sapovirus GI in silico analysis, one
GI.2 variant showed more than one mismatch, this mutation could affect the detection

mutations could affect the detection of this variant.
f. Assay cut-off:
The clinical trial data used in this analysis included testing results collected from
2148 patients (1786 prospective specimens and 362 retrospective specimes) and
seven testing sites. There were 1010 Cary-Blair preserved samples and 776
unpreserved samples collected prospectively and 136 Cary-Blair preserved samples
and 226 unpreserved samples collected as part of a retrospective study. For each
specimen, the BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel result and a reference method result were
determined. The reference method result is determined from a composite reference
method and the validation of the BD MAX cutoffs is performed against the reference
method.

Prospective Study
Six clinical sites enrolled prospective specimens and performed BD MAX testing.
Five were located in the U.S. and one was located in Canada. One additional internal
BD site was used as a testing site only. One internal BD site performed reference
method testing (alternate PCR and bi-directional sequencing). Sites were selected

based on several criteria, such as investigator and site personnel availability, number
of specimens eligible, historical prevalence rate for each target, familiarity with
reference methods and/or PCR methodologies, and characteristics of their respective
served patient populations.
All six geographically diverse clinical sites enrolled prospective specimens
that were being collected as part of routine patient care. The collection period for
Enteric Viral Panel Prospective specimens ranged from November 2015 to April
2017. The study included 1873 Prospective specimens (818 unpreserved and 1055
Cary-Blair preserved). These specimens were tested within the stability period
established for the BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel Assay and reference method.
Retrospective Study
Due to the low prevalence of the assay targets, archived (retrospective) specimens
collected from November 2011 to March 2017 were utilized to support the number of
positive specimens for all five targets. Retrospective specimens were collected from
the USA, Canada, and Uganda. The retrospective specimens were obtained from
various sources, including the participating clinical centers and commercial sources.
A total of 366 retrospective specimens were enrolled in the study (230 unpreserved
and 136 Cary-Blair preserved). Historical results were used as the first portion of the
composite reference method for the retrospective specimens.
Reference Method (RM)
The sponsor employed a composite reference method consisting of two validated
alternate PCRs followed by bi-directional sequencing analysis for one of the primer
sets. Confirmatory PCR primers were designed to target different regions of gene
sequence than those targeted by the BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel assay. Importantly,
while all prospective samples tested on the BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel assay were
evaluated fresh, they were frozen before being tested by the reference method.
Only specimens with positive or negative RM results and positive, negative, UNR or
IND MAX results were analyzed for each virus, which resulted in 1881 results for
Norovirus, 1909 results for Rotavirus, 1871 results for Adenovirus, 1827 results for
Sapovirus and 1847 results for Astrovirus. The primary reason for specimen
exclusion was the lack of data for the RM, but other reasons included specimens that
were too old, duplicate specimens that were collected from the same patient, and
samples that were enrolled before IRB renewal.
The sponsor submitted results from extensive testing of analytical LoD determination
and inclusivity testing for the reference PCR methods that utilized analytes prepared
from stock viral culture as well as characterized clinical stool specimens. The LoD
was determined for each of the 21 reference method assays. Testing was then
performed on ten representative assays, covering all five viral targets, in twenty
sample replicates at 1x LoD to validate viral DNA/RNA extraction from stool

samples, RT-PCR amplification and subsequent sequencing of viral genomic targets.
Samples with amplification above the cutoff values were called positive; any
concentration below these values was deemed negative. Non-sequencing master
mixes usually used cutoffs for YmaxEP conditions. Sequencing master mix positives
were based on melt temperature. However, the mixes were required to be sequenced
prior to calling a positive result.
To demonstrate analytical reactivity (inclusivity) for the reference method 61 strains
were tested by the non-sequencing PCR, with 41 confirmed ≥95% positive at 3x LoD.
Seven more were confirmed at 30x LoD, five more were confirmed at 300x LoD, and
four more required titration to 3000x LoD. The four isolates not detected were: ID
Sapovirus NYB 470159, Guix NoV GI.7 10.31750, NoV MG10737, and Guix NoV
GII.12 FII.3.
The sequencing PCR method detected 39/60 tested strains at 3x LoD. The remaining
samples were then titrated up to 30x LoD where seven more samples were confirmed.
Nine samples confirmed at 300x LoD, and finally two were confirmed at 3000x LoD.
The remaining three samples were not detected. The three strains not detected were:
Astrovirus Guix HAstV-7, Sapovirus BA0141AP, and Sapovirus NYB 470159.
Acceptance Criteria
Performance of ≥90% positive agreement of a NAAT test and NAAT reference
method was considered acceptable for Norovirus, Rotavirus, Adenovirus and
Astrovirus compared to current clinical practice. The acceptable performance of
Sapovirus was adjusted by the sponsor to a point estimate of ≥80% on the rationale
that the infection has a reduced severity compared to the other assay targets.
Study Demographics
The clinical study analyzed a total of 1146 Cary-Blair Preserved stool samples and
1002 Unpreserved stool samples across in-patient, out-patient, emergency, and long-
term care facility patient groups. The sponsor provided the following demographic
breakdown for the samples from the combined Retrospective and Prospective clinical

Seven false positive Cary-Blair preserved results available for discrepant analysis
were tested with the FilmArray GI panel. 4/7 of these samples were positive. Two
other preserved false positive specimens had historical negative results on either the
FilmArray GI panel or Luminex xTAG GPP assays.
Adenovirus Detection
Among prospectively collected fresh specimens, the BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel
assay achieved a PPA of 93.8% (95% CI: 71.7-98.9%) for Cary-Blair preserved stool
samples and a PPA of 80% (95% CI: 37.6-96.4%) for unpreserved stool samples.
Clinical performance of the BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel Adenovirus assay failed to
meet specific acceptance criteria for PPA due to a low number of positive samples
detected in the patient cohort. To supplement their prospective study results, the
sponsor performed additional contrived testing.

Since the minimum number of RM positives required as per the protocol was not
reached for Adenovirus among unpreserved specimens, contrived samples were also
tested. Contrived samples were prepared by spiking stock Adenovirus into BD MAX
SBT and adding unpreserved clinical stool matrix. A total of 48 samples were tested
at two external sites for a total of 96 samples. 50% of contrived specimens were made
at 1.99x LoD while the other 50% of specimens spanned the expected clinical range
of pathogen concentrations. Negative controls were prepared from the same clinical

Nine false positive Cary-Blair preserved specimens were available for discrepant
testing by FilmArray GI Panel. Four out of nine of these samples tested positive on
the predicate device. One other false positive specimen had a negative historical
result by an unknown “other molecular method”.
Six false negative preserved samples were similarly tested by the FilmArray GI panel
with four specimens testing negative for Sapovirus.
Despite meeting a less stringent acceptance criterion, the observed lower PPA
between the BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel and the reference method for Sapovirus
among unpreserved stool samples raised potential performance concerns. These
concerns were mitigated by additional discrepant testing performed by the sponsor.
Briefly, discordant unpreserved stool samples were mixed with Cary-Blair transport
medium and evaluated on the BioFire FilmArray GI panel. 5/6 unpreserved false
negative samples were also negative on the FilmArray GI panel. The one unpreserved
BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel false positive specimen, however, was negative by
BioFire FilmArray GI panel. These results support similar Sapovirus performance
characteristics between the BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel assay and the predicate
device.
Astrovirus Detection
Among prospectively collected fresh specimens, the BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel
assay achieved a PPA of 93.5% (95% CI: 79.3-98.2%) for Cary-Blair preserved stool
samples and a PPA of 93.3% (95% CI: 78.7-98.2%) for unpreserved stool samples.

2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
a. Level of Concern: Moderate
b. Device Hazard Analysis: Acceptable
The risks associated with the BD MAX Platform and Software were reviewed as part
of previous premarket notifications—
· K111860 (BD MAX Platform and Software with BD MAX GBS Assay)
· DEN160001 (BD MAX Vaginal Panel and Software Updates)
· K170308 (BD MAX Extended Enteric Bacterial Panel and Software
Updates)
The device hazard analysis submitted for the Enteric Viral Panel assay contains
redacted hazards and Risk Control Measures that, according to BD, are not associated
with the BD MAX system software for the ease of review by FDA.
According to the risk region chart in the Hazard Analysis Report, BD identified 93,
14, and 0 hazards in green, yellow, and red risk regions, respectively. After
accounting for appropriate mitigatins, where possible, all identified hazards are
acceptable. Examples of appropriate mitigations include software changes
implemented as a Risk Control Measures, proper device labeling, training of end
users, and the results of clinical and analytical validation studies.
c. Architecture Design Chart: Acceptable
The architecture design chart for the BD MAX System and software was submitted as
part of the original instrument clearance (K111860).
d. Software Description: Acceptable
42

--- Page 43 ---
Each new BD MAX assay is developed with an Assay Definition File (ADF)
containing the assay workflow parameters to run and report results for the assay on
the BD MAX System. The ADF controls sample preparation cartridge loading,
barcodes, result scripts, BANCS parameters and Master Mix parameters. The BD
MAX Enteric Viral Panel Assay ADF (BD MAX ENT VIR 49 Version: 1) was
released on Assay Release Key V2.38. The Assay Release Key is a compilation of
released BD MAX assay ADFs.
There are no unresolved anomalies associated with the ADF developed for use with
the BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel.
The BD MAX System software automatically interprets test results. Results are
reported for each of the analytes and for the Sample Processing Control. In the
absence of positive sample processing control amplification, positive analyte results
are maintained but any negative result is labeled unresolved “UNR”. Results for each
analyte are determined based on pre-extablished cut-off thresholds for both Ct.Score
(amplification threshold cycle) and Cycle End point (end point fluorescence of each
well).
e. Software Requirements Specifications: Acceptable
Extensive documentation was provided in the original K111860 submission with
assay-specific updates to software and ADFs in DEN160001, K170308, and the
current submission. No fundamental changes that affect safety or effectiveness are
noted.
f. Software Development Environment: Acceptable
Extensive documentation was provided in the original K111860 submission with
assay-specific updates to software and ADFs in DEN160001 and K170308. No
fundamental changes that affect safety or effectiveness are noted.
g. Traceability Analysis: Acceptable
Both the original K111860 submission and subsequent submissions contain adequate
documentation that links together design requirements and specifications to validation
testing.
h. Verification and Validation (VnV) Testing: Acceptable
BD provided a Software VnV plan that details testing and implementation procedures
for the release of V4.72A as well as the Assay Release Key V2.39A Software which
contains updated BD MAX Vaginal Panel (MVP) Assay Definition Files. According
to BD, the software version update to 4.72A is primarily to improve robustness of the
MVP assay.

--- Page 44 ---
The sponsor states that an equivalence comparison for the BD MAX Enteric Viral
Panel ADF will be performed to support the ADF parameters between the versions
used in the performance studies and the final commercial release version.
Software validation includes integration testing of new features, regression testing to
ensure retention of system performance and direct testing of bug fixes. Additional
testing includes stress testing and resolution of unexpected results. All completeion
criteria have been met for validation testing of the BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel
System and Assay software and all expected results have been addressed and
documented.
j. Revision Level History: Acceptable
BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel analytical and clinical studies were completed using the
functionality of BD MAX System software version 4.60A or 4.61D and with BD
MAX Enteric Viral Panel Assay Definition File “BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel IUO
v1”. The BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel assay kit will be distributed for use with the
BD MAX System running System Software Version 4.60A (or greater). Additional
enhancements, new features, and bug fixes are included in the upgrade to 4.72A.
A change to sample preparation script for the cleared BD MAX Vaginal Panel is
noted in release version 4.72A. The Software change impact review provided by the
sponsor suggests that this is to optimize workflow for interfering substances for
version 2 of the MVP assay and no new hazards are introduced.
None of the changes incorporated into the latest software version would impact the
BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel assay. The BD MAX ENT VIR 49 ADF was released
on February 15, 2018 for use with the CE marked version of the BD MAX Enteric
Viral Panel (CE Mark February 2018).
k. Unresolved Anomalies and Software Defects: Acceptable
In the Software Test Summary document, BD confirms passing results for all four test
protocols (SP_MVP Scripting, Stress Test, IVD Regression Test, Windows
Regression Test) using version 4.72A. Additionally, BD provides a list of all open
Software Change Requests for this version of software release.
While no unresolved software anomalies remain to the assay-specific ADF
component of the software, there is a total of 77 unresolved anomalies for the general
instrument software -- 21 Serious, 41 Medium, and 15 low – that primarily affet user
convenience and do not impact assay safety and effectiveness.
l. Off the Shelf Software (OTS)/Software of Unknown Pedigree (SOUP): Acceptable
The following third-party software components are used in the BD MAX instrument.
Microsoft Windows 7, Microsoft Windows IoT10 64 bits, Microsoft SQL Server
2012 Express, Microsoft .NET framework, Microsoft Visual Studio 2010,
