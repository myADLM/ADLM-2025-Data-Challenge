The Accula RSV Test performed on the Accula Dock is a molecular in vitro diagnostic
test utilizing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and lateral flow technologies for the
qualitative, visual detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) viral RNA. The Accula
RSV Test uses a nasal swab specimen collected from patients with signs and symptoms
of respiratory infection. The Accula RSV assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of
RSV infection in children and adults in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk
factors.
Negative results do not preclude RSV virus infection and should not be used as the sole
basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Prescription Use
4. Special instrument requirements:
To be used only with the Accula Dock Instrument
I. Device Description:
The Accula RSV Test is a semi-automated, colorimetric, multiplex reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nucleic acid amplification test to qualitatively detect
RSV A and RSV B viral RNA from unprocessed nasal swabs that have not undergone prior
nucleic acid extraction. The system integrates nucleic acid extraction, reverse transcription,
nucleic acid amplification using a novel Mesa Biotech technology, and hybridization-based
visual detection into a completely self-contained and semi-automated system. The Accula
RSV system consists of a small reusable Dock to drive the automated testing process and a
single-use disposable test cassette that contains all the reagents.
Upon insertion of a Test Cassette, the Dock will detect and identify the cassette type. After
the user transfers a clinical sample into the cassette and closes the dock lid, the embedded
firmware will control fluid flow of the sample into the various chambers of the cassette.

Amplicon detection requires the hybridization of two internal probes to generate a signal on
the Accula RSV detection strip. Dyed polystyrene microspheres are conjugated to
oligonucleotide probes to form an amplicon-microsphere complex by hybridization to an
internal region of the amplicon. The complex migrates through the pores of the detection
strip membrane and across capture zones which contain oligonucleotides complementary to
an amplicon region distinct from the detection probe binding site. Hybridization of the
amplicon-microsphere complex to a capture zone probe retards the flow of the specific
amplicon. This allows for the generation of a visible signal in the form of a colored line at the
capture zone.
Interpretation of results:
Results are interpreted visually by the operator after the test has completed. A colored line of
any intensity at the “RSV” location indicates a positive result if the test is valid. A Negative
Control line at the end of the test strip controls for non-specific binding or amplification and
must be absent for a valid test. A positive control line at the beginning of the strip tests for
amplification effectiveness and is necessary to interpret a test as “negative” for RSV.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the Accula RSV Test was tested in a study using contrived
nasal swabs at three CLIA-waived sites (sites 1 through 3) and one moderately
complex site (site 4) based in the United States. The objective of this study was to
test panels of contrived nasal swab samples with the Accula RSV Test to demonstrate
reproducibility of the assay in the hands of multiple users at multiple sites over
multiple non-consecutive days.
Samples were provided to testing operators in panels of 3 samples (RSV Low
Positive, Moderate Positive, and Negative). The targeted concentrations for the
Moderate Positive samples were approximately 3X the respective limit of detection
(LoD), the targeted concentrations for the Low Positive samples were approximately
1X the respective LoD, and the Negative samples contained no RSV. Samples were
blinded and randomized. Each operator tested one panel per day, testing a maximum
of three samples at a time. Each sample was tested in triplicate (from separate swabs)
(2 operators x 1 run x 3 swabs x 5 non-consecutive days = 30 observations for each
site per sample type). Results are reported for counts and percent agreement with
expected results. Reproducibility was evaluated by site, by operator and by day.

Agreement of actual results with expected results was 100%. There were no
differences observed within run (replicates tested by one operator), between runs (five
different days), between sites (four sites), or between operators (eight operators).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable; this is a qualitative assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality Control:
Each test cassette contains two internal process controls: an internal positive control
and a negative control. The positive control is a non-infectious RNA molecule of the
MS2 bacteriophage. The negative control is a non-RSV nucleic acid capture probe
intended to monitor for non-specific binding. Each test kit also contains separate
control swabs with inactivated RSV virus as well as a negative control swab to verify
reagent integrity. The manufacturer recommends positive controls be run for each
new lot or shipment of kits received, and for each new operator performing the test.
Additional positive control swabs are available for purchase from the manufacturer.
Specimen Stability
Contrived samples of RSV A were tested in triplicate on the Accula RSV assay in an
experiment to determine specimen stability. Samples were prepared near the
empirical LoD in pooled negative matrix containing the Accula RSV nasal swab
buffer solution and stored under various conditions. The contrived specimens were
prepared by spiking cultured viruses onto rayon-tipped swabs, which were then
dipped into pooled negative nasal swab matrix (PNNS); the material was pooled and
aliquoted into appropriately sized tubes for storage. Test conditions and the results of
the testing are summarized in the table below:

Mesa Biotech has indicated that specimens should be transferred to the nasal swab
buffer sample tube immediately after collection and stored at 2-8°C for no longer than
24 hours. Swabs that have not been eluted into nasal swab buffer can be stored in the
original swab packaging for up to two hours at room temperature. Tests supporting
the storage of the un-eluted swab sample in the original packaging are described in
the decision summary for CW180006.
Shelf Life
Accula RSV test kits are being tested for shelf life by storage at 30°C for different
lengths of time. At each time interval (day 0, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and at 3 month
intervals beyond) stored test kits are used to test control swabs and simulated RSV
samples prepared in clinical matrix. Contrived specimens are prepared in clinical
matrix near the empirical LoD. Negative samples and control swabs are tested as one
replicate. Acceptance criteria for shelf life studies are as follows: all positive samples
and controls must yield a 100% positive rate and all negative samples and controls
must yield a 100% negative rate. Tests were considered stable as long as they
continued to produce positive results for positive samples and negative results for
negative samples. Data generated so far demonstrates that the three lots tested are
stable for the first three time points tested (up to and including 4 weeks). The firm
will continue stability testing and the kit storage conditions for the Accula RSV test
will be labeled as stable at 15-30°C for the latest time period for which acceptance
criteria have been met in the ongoing stability study. Expiration dating will be
extended as the study continues provided that correct results are obtained for all three
test lots during the testing period.
d. Detection limit:
The objective of the Analytical Sensitivity Study was to identify the limit of detection
(LoD) of the Accula RSV assay using characterized strains of RSV A and RSV B.
Two RSV A strains (RSV A2 and RSV A Long) and two RSV B strains (RSV B1 and
RSV B 18537) were tested in replicates of twenty (20) for each concentration.
Clinical matrix was used as dilution material for all LoD determination/confirmation
experiments.
To determine the limit of detection, a range-finding study was first conducted to
establish the lower limit of analytical sensitivity using virus dilutions tested in
replicates of n=5. Following identification of the lower end of the detectable
concentrations in the range finding study, virus concentrations which produced at
least 3/5 detectable results were tested in replicates of 20. If the dilution tested did not
result in at least 19/20 “detected” results, a two-fold higher concentration was tested
again with 20 replicates.The final concentrations whereby at least 95% of results
(≥19/20) were positive for the target virus are shown in the table below:

e. Analytical reactivity:
Inclusivity verification was evaluated for the Accula RSV test using nine RSV
strains. The chosen strains represented clinical RSV A and RSV B isolates that were
obtainable for testing. Virus was diluted into a pooled clinical matrix to create
contrived samples at an estimated 2X LoD concentration based on the empirical LoD
studies. Each strain was tested in triplicate. The RSV strains, test concentrations, and
results are shown below:

f. Analytical specificity:
To determine the analytical specificity of the Accula RSV assay, 41 commensal and
common pathogenic microorganisms (21 viruses, 19 bacteria, 1 fungus) including
some that may be present in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx were tested. No cross-
reactivity was observed for any of the microorganisms tested. The organisms tested
and the results are shown in the table below:

g. Interfering Substances:
To assess substances with the potential to interfere with the performance of the
Accula RSV test, two RSV strains or a negative control were tested in replicates of
three (3) with each interfering substance at the “worst case” concentration. The RSV
strains selected for testing were RSV A2 and RSV B1. Virus was serially diluted into
a pooled clinical matrix to achieve a 1.5X LoD concentration.
Each RSV strain was tested with the “worst case” interferent concentration,
representing the highest concentration likely to be found in a respiratory sample.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable. Performance of the Accula RSV Test was evaluated against the
comparator method in a prospective clinical study.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable.
3. Clinical studies:
Clinical performance was evaluated in a multi-site study in the U.S. during the 2017-
2018 RSV season. Accula RSV was used to evaluate fresh, prospectively collected nasal
swab specimens from children and adults with suspected respiratory infection and
meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Samples were tested with the Accula RSV
within one hour of sample collection. At all sites, one swab specimen was tested directly
on the Accula RSV according to product instructions. The other swab was eluted in UTM
and shipped to a reference laboratory for testing with a high performance, FDA-cleared
molecular RSV assay. Elution and shipping of the reference swab sample was performed
according to the kit instructions. Discrepant results were tested using alternative FDA-
cleared molecular assays at the reference laboratory.
A total of 749 subjects were enrolled in the study with 55 specimens found to be
unevaluable. Of those 55 specimens that were unevaluable, 39 samples were rejected due
to protocol deviations, and 16 samples returned invalid results after repeat testing. A total
of 694 nasal swab specimens were considered evaluable for the purpose of data analysis
in the accuracy study. Patient age and gender distribution for the evaluable specimens is
presented in the table below:

6-18 67 67 134
19-59 78 31 109
≥60 54 26 80
Total 363 331 694
During the prospective clinical study, the initial invalid rate was 4.2% (30/710) (95% CI:
3.0% to 6.0%). After repeat testing (according to the product instructions) the invalid rate
was 2.3% (16/710) (95% CI: 1.4% to 3.6%)). Clinical performance of the Accula RSV
assay compared to an FDA-cleared molecular assay for nasal swab samples is presented
below.
