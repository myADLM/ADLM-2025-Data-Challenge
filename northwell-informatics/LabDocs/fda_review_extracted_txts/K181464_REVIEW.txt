H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The LIAISON Helicobacter Antigen assay is a chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA)
intended for the qualitative determination of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) antigen in
human stool. The test is an aid in the diagnosis of patients suspected of H. pylori
infection and to measure post therapy response from patients who have discontinued
therapy for at least 4 weeks. Assay results should be used in conjunction with other
clinical and laboratory data to assist the clinician in making individual patient
management decisions.
The test must be performed on the LIAISON XL Analyzer.
The LIAISON Helicobacter Antigen Control Set is intended for use as assayed quality
control samples to monitor the performance of the LIAISON Helicobacter Antigen assay.
The performance characteristics of the LIAISON Helicobacter Antigen Control Set have
not been established for any other assay or instrument platforms different from the
LIAISON XL.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
LIAISON XL Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The LIAISON Helicobacter Antigen assay is a delayed one-step sandwich assay for
detection of H. pylori stool antigen. The assay uses a Reagent Integral (Table 1) that consists
of Magnetic Particles, Conjugate monoclonal antibodies and Assay Buffer for detection of H.
pylori stool antigen. The assay also uses additional reagents (Table 2) that are required but
not provided with the assay. The reagents include calibrators and a stool extraction kit used
to extract and homogenize 200 μL of sample. The processed sample consists of a mixture of
extraction buffer and stool extracted H. pylori stool antigen which is then incubated with
paramagnetic particles coated with a capture antibody for H. pylori stool antigen. Following
incubation, an isoluminol conjugated antibody for H. pylori stool antigen is added to the
reaction and incubated. After the second incubation, the unbound material is removed with a
wash cycle. The starter reagents are then added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is
initiated. The light signal is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU).

L. Test Principle:
This test uses chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) technology based on the emission of
light as a result of a chemical reaction. During the first incubation, paramagnetic particles
coated with a capture antibody for H. pylori stool antigen are mixed with calibrators,
extracted samples or controls. During the second incubation, the conjugate antibody reacts
with H. pylori antigen that is bound to the solid phase. After each incubation, unbound
material is removed with a wash cycle. The starter reagents are then added to initiate a flash
chemiluminescence reaction. The resulting light signals are measured by a photomultiplier as
RLUs and are indicative of the presence of H. pylori antigen in calibrators, samples or
controls.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was assessed by measuring repeatability at one site using two kit lots, two
positive controls, two negative control and six clinically negative stool matrix samples
that were spiked with recombinant H. pylori antigen at three different concentrations (two
each) as follows: high negative < 1 X LoD (samples #1 and #2), low positive 2-3 X LoD
(samples #3 and #4) and moderate positive 3-4 X LoD (samples #5 and #6). Samples and
kit controls were assayed in duplicate in two runs per day over 12 days (48 data points for
each panel member). Multiple operators participated in the study. Mean, standard
deviation, and coefficient of variation (%CV) were calculated using multiple sources of
variability that included within-run, within-day, between-day, and total variability. The
study showed acceptable results which are summarized in Table 3.

Reproducibility was assessed across three testing sites (one internal) using two kit
controls in duplicate (positive and negative) and six samples containing antigen spiked
into matrix as described for the precision study. High negative (samples #3 and #4), low
positive (samples #5 and #6), and moderate positive (samples #1 and #2) concentrations
of H. pylori stool antigen were assayed in replicates of three, in two runs per day over
five operating days with two technicians at each site performing the test every day,
totaling 90 observations for each panel member. Mean, standard deviation, and
coefficient of variation (%CV) were calculated using multiple sources of variability that
include within run, within day, between-day, site to site, and total variability. The study
showed acceptable results which are summarized in Table 4.

Stability
Reagent Stability:
Reagent Integral Stability
Reagent Integral stability testing included four internal controls, one negative
stool sample, one low positive spiked antigen stool sample, one moderative
positive spiked antigen stool sample, and one high positive spiked antigen stool
sample. Testing was performed weekly. Three Reagent Integral lots were used to
establish stability conditions for opened and unopened reagents. All testing results
were acceptable for up to eight weeks. The data supports a labeling claim for an
open use stability of eight weeks at 2-8℃. Open use stability on board the
LIAISON Analyzer was performed using one Reagent Integral Lot at specified
intervals. All testing results were acceptable for up to eight weeks (see Table 5a).

Calibrators Stability:
Calibrators were stored at 2-8℃ and tested weekly. The Calibrators were found to
be stable up to the stated expiration date if unopened, up to 28 days if opened and
reconstituted, or up to 16 weeks if aliquoted and stored at -20℃ (see Table 5b).

Sample Stability:
A sample stability study was performed using ten (10) contrived stool samples
spiked to the following levels: three high negatives, four low positive, and three
moderate positive samples. Stool samples were spiked, extracted, and then stored
until testing in triplicate (see Table 5c). Additional fresh stools samples were
spiked with antigen then extracted at time of testing, these fresh samples should
be tested within 72 hours if stored at 2-8℃ and should be frozen at -20℃ in not
tested within the first 72 hours. All of the positives remained positive and all the
negatives remained negative. Stability testing was acceptable.

Index value.
The negative control is manufactured to a target value less than 0.70 Index value.
The positive control is manufactured to a have a target value of 5.0 Index value.
d. Detection limit:
The preliminary limit of Detection (LoD) testing was established by testing nine
dilutions of stool samples of known H. pylori concentrations near the index value of
1.0. Samples were prepared by spiking stool with purified recombinant H. pylori
antigen. Initial testing was performed in triplicate with the LIAISON Helicobacter
Antigen assay. Confirmatory LoD was defined as the concentration of samples that
gave a ≥ 95% positivity detection rate. The LoD was confirmed by evaluating sixty
(60) additional replicates at the preliminary LoD concentration. The limit of detection
for H. pylori stool antigen was determined to be at 4.0 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity:
Studies were performed on the LIAISON Helicobacter antigen assay using
potentially cross-reacting microorganisms that may cause symptoms similar to an H.
pylori infection. Clinically negative stool matrix samples were spiked with
recombinant H. pylori antigen at two levels: < 1 X LoD and 2-3 X LoD. Each
concentration was then run with or without the potentially cross-reactive
microorganism spiked at 1.2 x 108 CFU/mL (bacteria, fungi) and 1x105 TCID /mL

Interference:
Testing was performed to determine interference in the presence of potentially
interfering exogenous substances and commonly used medications relevant to
digestive complications and endogenous substances that may be found in stool. Two
matched stool sample pools containing Helicobacter antigen at concentrations near
the 1-2 X LoD and < 1 X LoD (low positive and high negative) were spiked with the
test substances and tested in triplicate. Mean Index values were calculated for each
sample. The Index values were averaged and the matched pairs were then compared
to determine if any of the substances affected test performance.
Acceptance criteria required that the spiked sample comparison to vehicle control did
not exhibit a change in classification from positive to negative or negative to positive.
No interference was observed in the LIAISON Helicobacter Antigen assay at the
highest concentration for each substance listed in Table 7.

High Dose Hook Effect (false negative):
A study was conducted to demonstrate that a high concentration of H. pylori antigen
does not interfere with a positive reaction in the LIAISON Helicobacter Antigen
assay. High concentration samples were prepared by spiking negative fecal matrix
with H. pylori antigen at 1.8 µg/mL (i.e., eight-fold higher than the highest
concentration observed in a positive clinical sample). A total of 16 different dilutions
were prepared from the contrived sample. Samples were prepared by spiking three

a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Prospective study
Initial Diagnosis
The performance of the LIAISON Helicobacter antigen assay was evaluated by
conducting a multi-site prospective clinical study. Twelve (12) independent sites
performed biopsies and collected stool specimens from patients suspected of H. pylori
infection. These specimens were collected from 11 sites within the US and one site
from outside the US (Italy).
The stool specimens were divided between three clinical sites, different from those
conducting biopsy, for testing. The three sites that performed the clinical testing with
the LIAISON Helicobacter antigen assay were ARUP Utah, Northwell Health Core
Laboratories New York, and DiaSorin Inc., Minnesota. Technicians at these three
sites were blinded to the biopsy (composite reference method, CRM) results obtained
from the collection sites.
The CRM for diagnosis of H. pylori infection is based on endoscopy obtained gastric
biopsy. The biopsied tissue was tested for the presence of H. pylori by histology and
rapid urease test. The sensitivity and specificity for the LIAISON Helicobacter
antigen assay was determined using the CRM.
Prospective testing consisted of 481 stool specimens collected from the patients with
symptoms gastritis or H. pylori infection who were scheduled to undergo endoscopy
with gastric biopsy as part of routine care (Initial Diagnosis Group). Of these, 204
patients were excluded either because they were on a treatment regimen [i.e., proton-
pump inhibitors (PPIs), or antibiotics] or had samples with CRM results that were
inconclusive, incomplete or were not readable. The remaining 277 patients who were
12

--- Page 13 ---
not taking PPIs or antibiotics at the time of specimen collection were considered for
final analysis.
The ages of patients ranged from 22 years to 87 years old. Of the 277 patients tested,
69% were female and 31% were male. No difference in test performance was
observed based on patient age or gender. The results are provided in Table 9 which
shows the clinical performance of the LIAISON Helicobacter antigen assay test at all
three of the test sites combined. The results of the study show that the LIAISON
Helicobacter antigen assay test exhibited a sensitivity of 95.5%, and a specificity of
98.6% compared to the CRM. The results are summarized in Table 9.

Post Therapy Diagnosis
Eradication (post therapy) evaluation was conducted on patients enrolled
prospectively at two sites. A total of 8 specimens were collected at least 4 weeks after
completion of the treatment regimen. Post therapy evaluation was conducted using a
two-step algorithm of patient analysis. First, patients were screened for the continued
presence of H. pylori using an FDA-cleared stool antigen test. Positive patients were
reflexed to a follow-up endoscopy and biopsy analysis by rapid urease test and
histology. The results of the study show that the LIAISON Helicobacter antigen
assay exhibited a sensitivity of 100.0% compared to the CRM. The results are
summarized in Table 10.

3. Specimen Identification:

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
See section M.1.c. above.
5. Calibration:
DiaSorin’s LIAISON Helicobacter antigen assay generates a continuous response
(relative light units, RLU) which is used in sample grading to provide a qualitative
(positive, negative, or equivocal) reportable result. The sample grading is based on the
use of a 10 point calibration curve (Master Curve) that was generated at the manufacturer
(In-house) when the analyzer was manufactured. Calibration of each Reagent Integral is
achieved by comparing the two calibrators (Calibrator 1 and Calibrator 2) provided in the
Reagent Integral in the Master Curve.
The Master Curve is stored on the LIAISON® XL Analyzer and specifically matched to
the kit in use via the instructions encoded in the RFID tag attached to the Reagent
Integral. Each 10 point Master Curve has been generated by a mathematical elaboration
of the data resulting from multiple testing (a minimum of 10 runs) of Master Standards
when the analyzer is manufactured.
The Master Standards are prepared from purified recombinant antigen also referred to as
the ‘in house’ Primary Standard Reference Preparation provided by the manufacturer.
The kit calibrators are manufactured by diluting stock solutions consisting of purified
recombinant antigen manufactured to an established Index value. The kit calibrators are
tested with a specific Integral lot against the Master Calibrators to assess the
concentration. They are subsequently corrected by dilution or concentration if the result
(Index value) is out of the target range.
Calibrator 1 is manufactured to have a target H. pylori antigen level of 1.5 Index value.
Calibrator 2 is manufactured to have a target H. pylori antigen level of 10.0 Index value.
15

--- Page 16 ---
The Calibrators are assayed by the user with a specific Reagent Integral lot to transform
the Master Curve (10 point) into a Working Curve (2 point) and further used to calculate
sample results. The LIAISON XL Analyzer Working Curve is obtained by the user
during assay calibration by assigning a curve to the two point kit calibrators based upon
the Master Curve. This Working Curve is used to calculate the patient sample results. The
Analyzer is calibrated in triplicate whenever one of the following conditions occurs:
· Quality Control results are out of the acceptable range.
· With each new lot of reagents (Reagent Integral or Starter Reagents)
· After each servicing of the LIAISON XL Analyzer
· The previous calibration was performed more than four weeks before
6. Quality Control:
LIAISON Helicobacter Antigen Control Set ([REF] 318201) is intended to monitor for
substantial reagent failure. LIAISON controls should be run in singlet to monitor the
assay performance. Quality control is required to be performed once per day of use, or
according to the guidelines or requirements of local regulations or accredited
organizations. It is recommended that the user refer to CLSI C24-A35 and 42 CFR
493.1256(c) for guidance on appropriate quality control practices.
The expected range of control concentrations is provided on the certificate of analysis,
the test is valid. If control values lie outside the expected ranges, the test is invalid and
patient results cannot be reported. Assay calibration should be performed if a control
failure is observed and controls and patient specimens must be repeated.
