E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The DxH 520 instrument system is comprised of the analyzer, software, and reagents that
allow for quantitative determination of hematological measurements through the use of
impedance, spectrophotometry, and optical technology. Additional reagents provide
system cleaning, quality control and calibration. The system includes the following
reagents :
 DxH 500 series Lyse – a cyanide-free, aldehyde-free erythrocyte lytic agent for
the quantitative determination of hemoglobin, dilution for the classification of
WBC subpopulations, and counting leukocytes.
 DxH 500 Series Diluent – an aldehyde-free, isotonic-buffered saline solution that
is used to dilute the specimen and used to rinse module components between
sample analyses.
 DxH 500 Series Cleaner – a cyanide-free, aldehyde-free cleaning agent for
components that come in contact with blood samples to remove residual material
from the system.

2. Principles of Operation:
Measurement of Hemoglobin
Using the DxH 520 hemoglobin reagent (DxH 500 Series Lyse), the hemoglobin
derivatives are stabilized in an oxyhemoglobin ferrous form. The resulting complex is
then measured by spectrophotometry using a LED λ=545nm with a δλ=40nm (+/- 20nm
bandwidth).
Determination of Count/Size for White Blood Cells, Red Blood Cells and Platelets
The Coulter Principle (impedance) is used to count and size cells by detecting and
measuring changes in electrical resistance when a particle (such as a cell) in a conductive
liquid passes through a small aperture. Platelet counting and sizing are performed in the
RBC bath. Thresholds separate the platelet pulses, which are much smaller than the RBC
pulses.
RBC and PLT Histograms
Red blood cells (RBCs) are categorized by size (volume) and plotted on a size
distribution curve to form the RBC histogram. Platelets are also categorized according to
size to develop a size distribution curve of the particles.
Leukocyte 5-Part Differential
The leukocyte 5-part differential is determined by using the simultaneous measurement
of impedance and direct optical measurement (Axial Light Loss - ALL) using a blue LED
focused through the WBC aperture.
3. Modes of Operation:
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes ___X____ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ________ or No ____X____
4. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification is performed by manual entry using a keyboard or hand-held
barcode reader.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Whole blood specimens are processed using a closed-vial sampling method as default
with the option to run in open-vial mode if selected by the operator. For open-vial
2

--- Page 3 ---
sampling, the whole blood specimen (single tube) is to be manually mixed and presented
to the analyzer by the operator.
6. Calibration:
The DxH 500 Series Calibrator is intended for the determination of CBC calibration
factors (WBC, RBC, HGB, MCV, PLT and MPV). The calibrator is comprised of human
and animal cells to simulate human blood cell populations.
7. Quality Control:
The DxH 500 Series Control is a hematology tri-level (low, normal and high) quality
control material intended to monitor the system’s performance for the CBC and 5-part
differential parameters. The calibrator is comprised of human and animal cells to
simulate human blood cells.

a. Method Comparison
The method comparison studies were performed at six sites (three clinical
laboratories and three physican office laboratories–also referred to as POLs) to
compare the performance of the DxH 520 Hematology Instrument to the UniCel DxH
800 COULTER Cellular Analysis System using a total of 688 residual whole blood
samples collected in K EDTA anticoagulant collection tubes. Venous (n=600) and
2
capillary (n=88) whole blood samples were analyzed in the open- and closed-vial
8

sampling modes. The study included pediatric (neonate to ≤ 21 years) and adult
subjects with the following conditions: anemia, thrombocytosis, sickle cell anemia,
acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic
leukemia, chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL), chronic myeloblastic leukemia
(CML), pancytopenia, polycythemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, infection and
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Deming regressions were used to estimate the regression models (i.e. slope, intercept,
95% confidence intervals (CI) and correlation coefficient (r)). Bland-Altman
(difference) plots and 95% limits of agreement (LOA) were presented to show the
average of the test and reference value on the X-axis and the difference between the
test and the reference methods on the Y-axis. Bias at medical decision points were
also evaluated for each site and for all sites combined. All results were within the pre-
defined acceptance criteria and found to be acceptable with the exception of the
basophil parameters.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
To evaluate precision and reproducibility, studies were conducted in clinical
laboratories and POL sites.
Repeatability
The repeatability study was conducted at multiple clinical laboratory sites using
multiple operators and multiple DxH 520 analyzers over multiple operating days. A
total of 112 samples residual native whole blood samples collected in K EDTA
2
collection tubes were selected within the defined ranges and around medical decision
points per the CLSI H26-A2 standard. Each sample was analyzed 10 consecutive
times in the closed-vial sampling mode. All results met the predefined acceptance
criteria and were determined to be acceptable.
To evaluate operator variability at POL sites, a repeatability study was conducted in
whole blood closed-vial mode and the pre-dilute testing mode using 24 residual
samples. Whole blood samples were analyzed by each operator for 10 replicates (each
sample) analyzed in the closed-vial mode. Pre-diluted samples were also analyzed by
each operator in the pre-dilute mode for 10 replicates. Samples were tested by two or
three operators at the POL sites. All results met the predefined acceptance criteria and
were determined to be acceptable.
Reproducibility
To evaluate reproducibility at clinical laboratory sites, three different levels of quality
control materials (low, normal, high) were used. The same lot was tested across all
sites. Control vials were run in duplicate twice each day for a minimum of 20 days at
one site and in triplicate twice each day for five days at the other two sites. All results
met the predefined acceptance criteria and were determined to be acceptable.
To evalute reproducibility at POL sites, one lot of quality control material (low,
normal, high) was run once a day across three sites for five days with five replicates
for each QC level. The data generated from this assessment was used to calculate
repeatability (within-run precision), between-day and between-site, and
reproducibility (total precision). For each reported parameter and for each level of
control tested, the sample size (N), mean, SD and %CV of the various components of
precision were calculated along with the 95% CI of the SD and %CV for repeatability
and reproducibility (total precision). All results met the predefined acceptance criteria
and were determined to be acceptable.

Regression analysis was used to assess linearity for the first-order model (e.g. linear),
and weighted polynomial regression was used to assess linearity for the second- and
third-order models (e.g, quadratic and cubic). WBC, PLT and HGB achieved linearity
with a first-order model whereas RBC linearity was achieved through polynomial
regression (third order model).

d. Carryover:
Carryover studies for the WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT parameters were conducted at
three sites in the closed-vial sampling mode. Fresh and contrived whole blood
samples were used to create high target value (HTV) samples for WBC and HGB.
Diluent was used for low target value (LTV) sample. Testing was performed on four
instruments. Each HTV sample was analyzed in triplicate, followed by three
aspirations of a LTV sample. The results of the carryover study were within the pre-
defined acceptance criteria and were determined to be acceptable for each parameter
tested.
e. Interfering Substances:
The interference effect of hemolysis, lipemia, icterus (unconjugated or conjugated
bilirubin), high levels of WBCs (100 x 103/µL) and high levels of platelets (PLT >
1000 x 103/µL) were evaluated in the interference study. For lipemia, seven
concentrations were analyzed in five replicates. For hemolysis, icterus and high levels
of WBCs, test concentrations selected from the CLSI EP07-A2 guideline were
analyzed in ten replicates. The concentrations indicated in the table below for lipemia,
conjugated bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin, and hemoglobin are the highest
concentrations that did not interfere with the following parameters: WBC, RBC, HGB,
HCT, MCV, MCHC, RDW, RDW-SD, PLT and MPV. For high levels of platelets (as
an interferent), the following parameters were evaluated: WBC, RBC, HGB, PLT and
MPV. For high levels of WBCs (as an interferent), the HGB parameter was evaluated.

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
Limits of Detection, Blank, and Quantitation (LoD, LoB, and LoQ)
Studies were conducted to evaluate LoB, LoD and LoQ for the WBC, RBC, HGB and
PLT parameters on the DxH 520 Hematology Analyzer. The study was conducted using
three DxH 520 instruments and two reagent lots. To determine LoB, testing was
performed on three individual test days, with 40 runs per day using diluent as a test
sample for each DxH 520 instrument yielding a total of 120 measurements/instrument.
To determine limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ), four samples per
parameter were evaluated. Three sets of 11 dilutions of the stock solution were prepared.
Five replicates of each dilution level was analyzed on each test instrument. The LoD and
LoQ study was carried out over two days on the same three instruments. The LoB, LoD
and LoQ were determined as follows.
Parameter LoB LoD LLoQ
WBC 0.020 0.032 0.072
RBC 0.010 0.014 0.044
HGB 0.010 0.040 0.123
PLT 1.700 3.036 3.629
Specimen Stability
To evaluate sample stability for all claimed parameters in predilute mode a total of 20
residual K2EDTA whole blood samples were prepared and stored at the defined
condition for each specimen. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate at different time
points according to the study design. The sample stability at room temperature for all
parameters was established at 15 minutes from the time of sample preparation (dilution).
To evaluate sample stability of whole blood (undiluted) samples, 21 normal and 15
abnormal whole blood specimens were collected and analyzed on three to four DxH 520
instruments. Sample stability was performed at both room temperature and refrigerated
storage. All parameters reported on DxH520 were assessed. Aliquots were prepared and
stored at the defined condition for each specimen, then analyzed in duplicate at different
time points according to the study design. The sample stability in the whole blood mode
for RBC, HGB, MCV, HCT, MCH, MCHC, RDW, RDW-SD, PLT, and MPV is 24
hours at room temperature (18–26°C) and refrigerated temperature (2–8°C) while the
sample stability for WBC and the 5-part differential parameters is 24 hours at room

Comparison Studies
Pre-Dilute vs. Whole Blood Sampling Modes
To demonstrate equivalency between pre-dilute and whole blood modes, fresh whole
blood samples were collected within 8 hours of venipuncture in K EDTA collection
2
tubes. Whole blood (normal and abnormal) samples run in duplicate in the Cap Pierce
mode was compared to two K EDTA whole blood dilutions prepared by the operator run
2
in the pre-dilute mode. Deming and weighted Deming approaches were used to estimate
the parameters of the regression model (slope, intercept, 95% confidence intervals and
correlation coefficient) of the comparison. Results met the predefined acceptance criteria
and were found to be acceptable.
Sampling Modes (Cap Pierce, Open Vial and Tube Holder Open Vial)
Cap piercing, open-vial and tube holder open-vial (THOV) modes were tested with the
same blood samples on the same instrument using the same reagents. A total of 44
samples (normal and abnormal) were included in analysis for the mode equivalency
testing. Deming and weighted Deming regressions were used to estimate the parameters
of the regression model (slope, intercept, 95% confidence intervals and correlation
coefficient) of the comparison. Results met the predefined acceptance criteria and were
determined to be acceptable.
Anticoagulant and Matrix Comparison
K EDTA and K EDTA anticoagulant and matrix (venous or capillary) comparison
2 3
studies were conducted in the whole blood cap-piercing mode. K EDTA venous whole
2
blood was compared to K EDTA venous whole blood or K EDTA capillary whole blood.
3 2
A total of 49 samples (normal and abnormal) were included in the analysis for the
anticoagulant comparison and a total of 48 samples were included in analysis for the
matrix comparison. Deming and weighted Deming regressions were used to estimate the
regression model (slope, intercept, 95% confidence intervals and correlation coefficient)
for the comparisons. The results met the predefined acceptance criteria and were found to
be acceptable.
Reference Intervals
The normal adult reference interval for all parameters reported by the DxH 520 system
were established by analyzing whole blood samples collected in K EDTA from a total of
2
279 healthy individuals (N=126 males, N=153 females). Statistical analysis was
performed using the nonparametric method in accordance with the reference limits
calculated using 95% confidence intervals.
A literature reference interval verification study was performed for the pediatric
population. A total of 208 samples were collected from apparently healthy pediatric
patients in pediatric subcategories (0 to 30 days (n=20), 31 days to 2 years (n=27), 3 to 12
