H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The SeraQuest HSV Type 2 Specific IgG assay is an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) intended for the qualitative detection of human
IgG antibodies to type 2 herpes simplex virus (HSV) in human serum. The test
is indicated for sexually active individuals and expectant mothers as an aid in
the presumptive diagnosis of HSV-2 infection. The predictive value of a
positive or negative result depends on the prevalence of HSV-2 infection in
the population and the pre-test likelihood of HSV-2 infection.
The test is not FDA cleared for screening blood or plasma donors. The
performance of this assay has not been established for immunocompromised
patients, pediatric patients or matrices other than human serum.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
ChemWell Automated Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The SeraQuest HSV Type 2 Specific IgG test is a solid-phase enzyme-linked
immunoassay (ELISA), which is performed in microwells, at room temperature,
and in three thirty minute incubations. The test detects IgG antibodies which are
directed against HSV-2 antigen,in human serum. The calibrators in the SeraQuest
HSV Type 2 Specific IgG test set have been assigned index values based on an in-
house standard. Test results are reported as index values. The following table
shows the interpretation of results:
Table 1: Interpretation of results
Index Result Interpretation
< 0.9 Negative No HSV-2 IgG antibodies detected. Patient is presumed not to
have had a previous HSV-2 infection
0.9 < X < 1.0 Equivocal Obtain an additional sample for re-testing
≥ 1.0 Positive IgG antibody to HSV-2 detected
2

[Table 1 on page 2]
	Index			Result			Interpretation	
< 0.9			Negative			No HSV-2 IgG antibodies detected. Patient is presumed not to
have had a previous HSV-2 infection		
0.9 < X < 1.0			Equivocal			Obtain an additional sample for re-testing		
≥ 1.0			Positive			IgG antibody to HSV-2 detected		

--- Page 3 ---
Notes:
1. A single positive result only indicates previous immunologic exposure; the
level of antibody response may not be used to determine active infection or
disease stage.
2. When equivocal results are obtained, another specimen should be obtained ten
to fourteen days later, and tested in parallel with the initial specimen. If the
second specimen is also equivocal, the patient is negative for primary or recent
infection, and equivocal for antibody status. If the second sample is positive,
the patient can be considered to have previous experience with HSV-2
infection.
3. Values obtained with different manufacturer's assay methods may not be used
interchangeably. The magnitude of the reported IgG index value cannot be
correlated to an endpoint titer. The magnitude of results above the cut-off is not
an indicator of total antibody present.

Document: Herpes Simplex Virus Types 1 and 2 Serological Assays (issued

L. Test Principle:
Diluted patient samples are incubated in antigen-coated wells. HSV Type 2
antibodies, if present in the patient sample, are immobilized in the wells by binding
to the antigen. Residual sample is eliminated by washing and draining, and
conjugate (enzyme-labeled antibodies to human IgG) is added and incubated. If
IgG antibodies to HSV-2 are present, the conjugate will be immobilized in the
wells. Residual conjugate is eliminated by washing and draining, and the substrate
is added and incubated. In the presence of the conjugate, the substrate is converted
to a yellow end-product which is read photometrically.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:A within laboratory precision study with a panel
of samples was conducted with the SeraQuest HSV Type 2 Specific IgG assay
by both the manual method and the ChemWell Automated Analyzer. The panel
consists of samples in the following categories: true negative, high negative,
low positive, and moderate positive. Precision evaluation of within-run,
between-run, between-day, and within lab precision was determined over the
duration of 12 days, with 2 runs per day, and 2 replicates of each sample per
run and 1 replicate per control per run. Data analysis includes calculation of the
mean, standard deviation and %CV for each panel, as summarized in tables 2
and 3.
