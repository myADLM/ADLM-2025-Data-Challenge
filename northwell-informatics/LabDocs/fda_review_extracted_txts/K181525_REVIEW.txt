L. Test Principle:
The INNOVANCE Free PS Ag assay is an immunoturbidimetric assay consisting of a
reagent and buffer. The reagent contains polystyrene (latex) particles covalently coated with
two different monoclonal mouse antibodies (mAb A and mAb B) specific for free protein S.
The latex reagent aggregates when mixed with samples containing free protein S. The
degree of aggregation is directly proportional to the concentration of free protein S in the
test sample and is detected at 800 nm via an increase in turbidity.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To obtain measures of repeatability and reproducibility imprecision for the
INNOVANCE Free PS Ag Assay, commercial qualitity controls (normal and
pathological) and human plasma pools with concentrations in the lower and upper
ranges as well as around the medical decision levels (MDLs), were analyzed on the
Sysmex CS-5100 analyzer.
i. Single-site Studies
To assess lot variability, three lots of the INNOVANCE Free PS Ag reagent
were tested on one Sysmex CS-5100 analyzer. For each lot of reagent, a sample
set consisting of five samples (two levels of commercial quality control and
three human plasma pools–low, MDL, high) were evaluated. The sample set was
tested on 20 non-consecutive days in duplicate with two runs per day, for a total
of 240 replicates per sample (80 replicates per sample per lot). Within-run,
between-run, between-lot, between-day, and total imprecision were calculated
and met the predefined acceptance criteria.

ii. Multi-site Study
A multi-site study using the same set of five samples as described above was
performed on one Sysmex CS-5100 analyzer at three sites using one lot of
INNOVANCE Free PS Ag. Each sample set was tested in two replicates per run
with two runs per day for 20 non-consecutive days, for a total of N=240

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were performed on one Sysmex CS-5100 analyzer with three lots
of reagent over a period of three days. Each sample was tested in quadruplicate for
each lot, with one run per day. Eleven different dilutions were prepared using a
plasma pool to cover the linear range (10–150% norm). The high pool was prepared
by spiking a normal plasma pool with a human protein S concentrate and the low
pool was prepared by diluting a normal plasma pool with commercial protein S
deficient plasma. Deviation between the linear regression model (predicted value
from 1st order regression) and the best fitting polynomial regression model was
calculated for each sample. The linear range for the INNOVANCE Free PS Ag
assay was determined to be 10–150 % on the Sysmex CS-5100.

Traceability:
Standard Human Plasma (SHP) is used for the calibration of Free protein S Antigen
assay. This SHP is traceable to the WHO International Standard, 2nd International
Standard (WHO IS) for Protein S (NIBSC code: 03/228).
Value Assignment:
The primary standard/calibrator for the assay is prepared from the respective WHO
International Standard (IS) and used to assign the value of the secondary standard,
the SHP masterlot. Product lots of SHP are value assigned with the secondary
standard using a similar value assignment process. For both primary and secondary
calibrators, the testing is performed on three Sysmex CS-5100 analyzers with three
lots of NNOVANCE Free PS Ag. With each reagent lot, a calibration curve using
the WHO IS and SHP in house standard are established for primary and secondary
calibrators, respectively (three curves per analyzer, for a total of nine curves for
each primary and secondary calibration). For the secondary calibrator, on each of
the three analyzers, two vials of SHP are measured in single determination from two
individual aliquots. The analyzer specific analytical value of free PS Ag (% norm)
for INNOVANCE Free PS Ag is calculated as the mean value of 36 measurements.
Shelf-life Stability of SHP:
One lot of reagent was used to evaluate three lots of the SHP calibrator at 2–8°C and
-70°C at different time points (6, 12, 13 months). The real-time stability study has
been completed up to 13 months for the SHP Calibrator, and support a 12-month
real-time stability claim.
On-Board Stability of SHP:
Three lots of SHP were evaluated for on-board stability on the Sysmex CS-5100
analyzer. In this study, the time points for calibrator testing were 0 (reference
value), 2, 4, 6 and 7 hours. The results from all evaluations performed during this
study were successful and met the predefined acceptance criteria. The data support a
7-hour on-board stability claim for the SHP on the Sysmex CS-5100. However, the
Standard Human Plasma is intended to be used immediately, as stated in the
labeling.
Stability of SHP after Reconstitution:
Three lots of SHP were evaluated for open-vial capped stability at 15–25°C and -20
°C on the Sysmex CS-5100 analyzer. The SHP lots were opened for 30 minutes at
15–25°C, recapped, then stored at 15–25°C and -20°C and finally measured at two
time points—4 and 5 hours at ambient temperature and 4 and 5 weeks at -20°C. The
results from all evaluations performed during this study met the predefined
acceptance criteria. The data support a stability claim after reconstitution of 4 hours
when stored at 15–25°C and 4 weeks when stored at -20°C.

Transportation Stability for SHP and INNOVANCE Free PS Ag Reagent:
The INNOVANCE Free PS Ag and SHP are shipped under refrigerated conditions
at 2–8°C. The transport simulation study is performed to simulate transport under
stressed conditions with variations in temperatures (45°C to -20°C) and different
storage times (12 hours to 54 hours). After the period of simulation testing, both the
calibrator and reagent were placed at 2–8°C and tested at different time points (6,
12, 18, and 24 months). Stability was assessed in terms of measurand drift for
reagent and calibrator and found to be acceptable to suppport lots representing a 12-
month shelf-life stability claim.
Shelf-life Stability of INNOVANCE Free PS Ag Reagent:
Three lots of the INNOVANCE Free PS Ag Reagent were tested at different time
points (0, 6, 12, 13 months) to determine shelf-life stability. The study was
conducted by testing a total of five samples: two native plasma pools, one plasma
pool diluted with protein S deficient plasma, and commercial quality control
material (normal and pathological levels). The shelf-life stability study has been
completed up to 13 months for the INNOVANCE Free PS Ag Reagent, and found
to be acceptable to support a 12-month shelf-life stability claim at 2–8°C.
Ambient Temperature Stability for INNOVANCE Free PS Ag Reagent:
One INNOVANCE Free PS Ag lot was used to determine the influence of
environmental temperature on test results of the INNOVANCE Free PS Ag assay on
the Sysmex CS-5100 analyzer. The study was conducted over a period of three days
with each day representing one ambient temperature (15, 22 or 30 °C). A maximum
deviation of ± 1°C to the defined environmental temperature was allowed for each
of the three different ambient temperatures. Stability was assessed in terms of
measurand drift for each test sample and found to be within predefined acceptance
criteria.
On-Board Stability of INNOVANCE Free PS Ag Reagent:
Three lots of INNOVANCE Free PS Ag reagent were evaluated for on-board
stability on the Sysmex CS-5100 analyzer. The same five sample set as described in
reagent stability was used to cover the AMR and medical decision point. Different
time points (0, 24, 48, 72, 76, 96 and 100 hours) were evaluated. Stability was
assessed in terms of measurand drift for reagent and found to be acceptable to
suppport support a 96-hour on-board stability claim.
Open-vial Stability for INNOVANCE Free PS Ag Reagent:
Three lots of INNOVANCE Free PS Ag reagent were evaluated for opened-vial
capped stability (2–8°C) on the Sysmex CS-5100 analyzer. INNOVANCE Free PS
Ag kit components are opened, stored for 30 minutes at 15 to 25 °C, subsequently
recapped and stored again at 2–8 °C until the testing time point. The same five
8

--- Page 9 ---
sample set as described in reagent stability was used to cover the AMR and medical
decision point. Different time points (4, 6, 8 and 9 weeks) were evaluated. Stability
was assessed in terms of measurand drift for reagent and found to be acceptable to
suppport an 8-week open-vial stability claim.
Sample Stability
The sample stability study was conducted using both fresh plasma samples (on cells
and removed from cells) stored at room temperature (15 to 25 °C) and frozen
plasma stored at -18 °C and -70 °C. Twenty-four plasma samples were tested in
quadruplicate within 4 hours after blood draw to determine the baseline (time point
t=0). For ambient temperature storage, the samples were resealed and tested at two
different time points (4 and 5 hours). For -18°C and -70°C storage, the samples
were kept frozen at two different time points (3 and 4 months), then the samples
were thawed at 37°C and tested. The result from each time point was compared to
the respective baseline result and found to be acceptable to support the claim for 3
months at ≤ -18°C for centrifuged plasma removed from the cell suspension and 4
hours at 15–25°C for centrifuged plasma stored on the cell suspension and
centrifuged plasma removed from the cell suspension.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of blank (LoB) was determined following CLSI EP17-A2 guideline by using
five analyte-free samples (protein S activity deficient plasma). Samples were
measured in quadruplicate using three lots of INNOVANCE Free PS Ag Reagent on
one Sysmex CS-5100 analyzer over three days, with one trained operator. The LoB
was determined to be 1.2%.
Limit of detection (LoD) was determined following CLSI EP17-A2 guideline by
using five low analyte samples. These samples were measured in quadruplicate
using three lots of INNOVANCE Free PS Ag Reagent on one Sysmex CS-5100
analyzer over three days, with one run per day. The limit of detection was
determined to be 1.746%.
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) study was conducted according to the CLSI EP17-
A2 guideline. In the study, two CS-5100 analyzers, three different reagent lots, and
one calibrator lot was used. Five low analyte samples were divided into two
individual aliquots and tested over three days by one trained operator. The LoQ was
determined to be 10%.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was conducted using one lot of INNOVANCE Free PS Ag
reagent on the Sysmex CS-5100 analyzer. In this study, four citrated human plasma
samples (30%, 80%, 100% and 150%) were spiked with various concentrations of
interferents and tested. Each spiked sample was tested in quadruplicate on the CS-
5100 analyzer.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed at three clinical laboratory sites located
in the U.S. to compare the performance of the INNOVANCE Free PS Ag reagent on
the Sysmex CS-5100 to the predicate device–STA Liatest Free Protein S on the
STA-R Evolution. The studies were performed with fresh and frozen samples
(N=350). To support the intended use population, patient samples with various
demographics (i.e. race, gender, and age), were included in the study. All samples
were collected in 3.2% sodium citrate anticoagulant and tested in singlet with both
methods (candidate and predicate). Patient sample demographics included 214
females and 136 males, ≥18 years of age. Patients with suspected thrombophilia or
protein S deficiency, congenital and acquired protein S deficiency were included in
the study.
Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed for each site and all sites
combined (results summarized below).

site, using one Sysmex CS-5100 analyzer, one reagent lot and one calibrator lot.
Sixty-six fresh samples covering the reportable range were measured on the CS-
5100 analyzer analyzer within 4 hours after blood collection. One aliquot of each
sample was stored for at least 7 days at ≤ -74 °C. The aliquots were thawed within
10 minutes at 37 °C in a water bath, gently mixed and measured again within 2
hours after thawing. Results were analyzed using Passing-Bablok regression
analysis and Bland-Altman plots. The study results demonstrated comparability
between fresh and frozen samples and met the predefined acceptance criteria.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Potential Cross-Reactivity:
To assess potential cross-reactivity between the monoclonal antibodies of the assay
and the C4BP-protein S complex, three different types of plasma pool samples were
evaluated. The samples were prepared with different concentrations of protein S: a
sample without C4BP (A), a sample with added C4BP (B) and a 1:1 mixture of
sample A and B (C). Each sample was prepared in triplicate, resulting in nine test
samples for each free protein S concentration (Low, Medical Decision Level (MDL)
and High) and tested on three different INNOVANCE Free PS Ag lots. The study
demonstrated no cross-reactivity with protein S bound to C4b-binding protein
(C4BP) was observed. The results of the study demonstrated that addition of C4BP
to a plasma sample, leads to an increase of protein S bound to C4BP and a decrease
of free protein S, which reduces the test results of INNOVANCE Free PS Ag in a
concentration-dependent manner.
High Dose Hook:
To evaluate a hook (prozone) effect, fresh normal plasma was used and spiked with
purified human protein S to prepare 10 different dilution samples and tested on three
Free PS Ag reagent lots. The study demonstrated that no hook effect was observed
up to a concentration of 588% of norm free protein S. Free protein S concentrations
above the measuring interval of the assay were flagged by the analyzer.
Carryover:
13

--- Page 14 ---
Sample Carryover:
The sample carryover study was evaluated to determine the level of contamination
from high-analyte test samples into low-analyte test samples. The study was
performed on one Sysmex CS-5100, using one reagent lot. A total of 21
measurements, using fresh pooled normal plasma were evaluated. The relative mean
deviation was calculated at -0.4% and found to be within the predefined acceptance
criteria.
Reagent Carryover:
The reagent carryover study was conducted using three different samples: a normal
sample, a sample near the medical decision point and a pathological sample. Each
sample was tested with both an acceptor application (Free PS Ag Reagent) and a
donor application (reagents that are representative of different methodologies:
clotting, chromogenic, immunologic) on specific pipettors of the Sysmex CS-5100
analyzer. The mean values were calculated for each sample and the relative mean
(percent) were calculated for each application and found to be within predefined
acceptance criteria.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Reference interval studies were conducted at three clinical sites in the U.S. at different
geographic locations to reflect the U.S. population. Citrated plasma samples were
obtained from 300 apparently healthy individuals (149 males and 151 females) ≥ 18
years with no current or recent history of a bleeding disorder or unexpected extended
bleeding episodes. Results from all sites were pooled and all reference intervals were
established by calculating the non-parametric 95% confidence interval (2.5th to 97.5th
percentiles). The calculated normal reference range for INNOVANCE Free PS Ag
assay is 72.8–138.8% for males and 65.8–146.7% for females.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
