L. Test Principle:
The On Call Sure Sync and On Call Sure Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems use
electrochemical methodologies that use a reagent system that includes glucose
dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH) and a mediator that reacts with the glucose in the whole blood
sample obtained from the fingertip, forearm, and/or palm to produce an electrical current
signal. This current is measured using an amperometric detection method. The meter then
calculates and displays the blood glucose concentration reading, calibrated to plasma
reference.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The only differences between the On Call Sure and On Call Sure Sync Blood Glucose
Monitoring Systems in this submission are the presence and absence of Bluetooth
functionality and the device names. Therefore, the performance studies presented below
were conducted using the On Call Sure Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring System as a
representative device.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed within-run precision studies using venous whole blood
samples adjusted to six glucose concentration levels (30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-
250, and 251-400, and 401-600 mg/dL). Each glucose level was analyzed in
replicates of 10, with 3 test strip lots and 10 meters for a total of 300 measurements
with each glucose concentration. Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
For evaluation of linearity, venous whole blood was prepare at 11 glucose levels(9.8,
28, 54.5, 81.8, 111.8, 173.5, 227.4, 342, 444.8, 563.8, and 673.4 mg/dL as measured
on the comparator methodYSI 2300 STAT PLUS). Each glucose level was measured
in replicates of10 using each of3 lots of test strips. Linear regression analysis for
each test strip lot was compared to the plasma YSI. The evaluation yielded the
following regression equations:
Lot Slope y-intercept R2
1 1.005 0.3755 0.9976
2 1.0023 -0.3007 0.9976
3 0.9948 0.4345 0.9991
Combined 1.0009 0.1698 0.9981
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of
40 - 600 mg/dL. If a sample result is less than 40 mg/dL glucose, the result is flagged
by the meter as “Lo”. If a sample result exceeds 600 mg/dL glucose, the result is
flagged by the meter as “Hi”. The “Lo” and “Hi” functions were validated by the
sponsor and were demonstrated to function as intended.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The On Call Sure Blood Glucose Monitoring System and On Call Sure Sync Blood
Glucose Monitoring System are traceable to the NIST SRM 917b reference material.
Test Strip Stability:
Stability of the On Call Sure Blood Glucose Test Strips was assessed using real time
and accelerated studies. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found
to be acceptable. The sponsor claims shelf life stability of 24 months and open-vial
stability of 6 months when stored at the recommended storage conditions of 36°F-
95°F (2-35°C) and 10-90% relative humidity (RH).
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study (Section M.1.b.) above.

e. Analytical specificity:
For the evaluation of interference, 38 potentially interfering substances were spiked
into venous whole blood. Each potentially interfering substance was tested at 3
glucose levels (50-70 mg/dL, 110-130 mg/dL and 250-270 mg/dL). Test samples
were prepared to the specified concentration for each substance. Control samples
were prepared without the potential interferent. Control and test samples were each
measured in replicates of 30 and the bias between control and test samples was
calculated. The highest interferent concentrations at which measurement bias was
≤10 mg/dL (for glucose <75 mg/dL) or ≤10% (for glucose ≥75 mg/dL) vs. control
specimens is presented in the table below.

evaluation study consisting of 366 participants who collected capillary samples from
their fingertip, palm, and forearm on their own and obtained blood glucose
measurements on the candidate device using only the On Call Sure/On Call Sure
Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring System labeling. Three test strip lots were used for
this study and results were analyzed against results obtained on the comparator
method, the YSI 2300 STAT PLUS analyzer. The glucose concentrations of the
samples ranged from 53.8-537.5 mg/dL as measured on YSI 2300 Stat Plus (21
unaltered samples contained glucose <80 mg/dL and 48 unaltered samples contained
glucose >250 mg/dL). Results are summarized below:

Usability/ Readability Study
A readability study was conducted on the proposed user’s manuals, quick reference
guide, quick start guide, and test strip package insert. The results of the readability
study indicated a Flesch-Kincaid Score of 8 and lower for all instructional materials
included with this device.
Extreme Glucose Study
System performance at the extreme upper (>250 mg/dL) and lower (<80 mg/dL) ends
of the claimed device measuring range was further assessed using additional capillary
blood collected from 149 participants. Following collection, extreme glucose study
samples were glycolyzed or spiked to obtain 88 samples with glucose concentrations
<80 mg/dL and 61 samples >250 mg/dL. Each sample was measured using the On
Call Sure System and results compared those obtained using the YSI comparator
method. Results are summarized in the tables below:

4. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm, and
forearm. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip, so there are no
special handling considerations.
5. Calibration:
No user calibration is required.
6. Quality Control:
The On Call Sure Glucose Control Solutions are used to confirm that the meter and test
strips are working properly. Glucose control solutions are viscosity-adjusted, buffered
aqueous control solutions that contain known concentrations of d-glucose. Three solution
levels are available (Level 0, Level 1 and Level 2) for use with the systems. Level 1 is
provided with the system kit. Level 0 and Level 2 are sold separately. Instructions on
how to order the control solutions are included in the user manual. The meter
automatically detects control solution readings. The control solution readings are not
13

--- Page 14 ---
included in the average of the patient results. An acceptable range for each control level
is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the
control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit: To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the On Call Sure/Sure Sync Blood
Glucose Monitoring System, venous blood samples were adjusted to hematocrit levels of
10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65% and 70%. Each
hematocrit level was tested at six glucose concentration intervals (~40, ~80, ~130, ~200,
~325, and ~500 mg/dL). Each sample was tested in replicates of ten using 30 meters and
3 test strip lots. Results from the meter were compared to results obtained using a
laboratory-based comparator measurement (YSI 2300 STAT PLUS analyzer). The
evaluation of bias and percent bias relative to values obtained on the YSI 2300 STAT
PLUS analyzer support the claimed hematocrit range of 10-70%.
2. Altitude: To evaluate the effect of altitude on the On Call Sure/Sure Sync Blood Glucose
Monitoring System, meters were tested at 16 ft and 10,790 ft on fingerstick capillary
blood acquired from 22 subjects at each altitude. Each sample was tested with 2 test
strips from each of 3 strip lots on 2 meters. Results were compared to results obtained for
venous plasma samples on laboratory-based comparator measurements taken at each
altitude (i.e., at sea level YSI 2300 STAT PLUS analyzer was used and at 10,000 ft
Beckman Coulter UniCel DxC 800 Synchron Clinical System was used). At sea level,
the reference glucose concentration range was 74.4 – 406.6 mg/dL (33 – 52%
hematocrit). At 10,000 ft, the reference glucose concentration range was 59.4 – 282.6
mg/dL (39 – 61% hematocrit). Test results support the claims in the labeling that
altitudes of up to 10,000 feet have no significant effect on performance of the On Call
Sure and On Call Sure Sync systems.
3. Operating Conditions: To evaluate system performance under the extremes of the
recommended temperature and humidity conditions, venous samples were prepared at six
glucose concentration levels (45.2, 103.0, 130.7, 202.4, 327.0, and 526.6 mg/dL). Test
strips from 3 lots were exposed to one of 7 relative humidity (RH) and temperature
conditions (10% RH/5oC, 10% RH/21oC, 10% RH/45oC, 90% RH/5oC, 90% RH/21oC,
90% RH/45oC, or 45% RH/21oC). The results from the On Call Sure system were
compared to results obtained using the comparator method, YSI 2300 STAT PLUS, and
support the claimed operating conditions of 10-90% RH and 41-113oF (5-45ºC).
4. Sample Volume: To verify the minimum sample volume requirement, venous whole
blood samples were tested at five volumes (0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 µL). Sample
concentrations included three glucose levels (50-65, 100-120, and 200-250 mg/dL).
Values obtained with the candidate device were compared to values obtained using the
comparator method (YSI 2300 STAT PLUS analyzer). Results support the claimed
minimum sample volume of 0.6 µL. The sponsor provided validation studies
demonstrating that with blood volumes below 0.6 μL, the insufficient sample volume
14

--- Page 15 ---
error message functioned as intended.
5. Sample Perturbation: The sponsor demonstrated that, while an error code (E-5:
Insufficient sample volume error) was triggered when sample was removed during
measurement, perturbation via shaking the meter and test strip, hitting the meter, or
flicking the test strip during measurement does not significantly affect meter glucose
results.
6. Intermittent Sampling: The sponsor demonstrated that intermittent sample application
triggers an error code (E-5) when a short sample is initially applied to the test strip
followed by a second sample application to the test strip. The results demonstrated that
the device does not provide blood glucose values when samples are intermittently
applied. The labeling indicates that the user should apply enough sample to fill the test
strip check window within 3 seconds.
7. Testing with Used Test Strips: The sponsor demonstrated that used test strips were
accurately detected by the meters when samples were applied to test strips prior to
insertion into the meter and when previously used test strips were re-inserted in the meter
after drying.
8. A variety of mechanical/durability testing (i.e., drop testing, temperature exposure,
humidity exposure, temperature sensitivity and limit testing, test strip connector
durability, vibration, packaging, and battery life testing) was performed and the ACON
On Call Sure/Sure Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring System to demonstrate that the meter
is robust to environmental and mechanical stresses.
9. Infection Control and Robustness Studies: The ACON On Call Sure/Sure Sync Blood
Glucose Monitoring System is intended for single-patient use. Disinfection efficacy
testing on the surface materials of the meter demonstrated complete inactivation of duck
hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectants, DisCide Ultra Disinfecting
Towelettes (EPA Registration #10492-4) and PDI Super Sani-Cloth Germicidal Disposal
Wipes (EPA Registration #9480-4). Robustness studies were also performed by the
sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of
the meter after 260 cleaning and disinfection cycles (a total of 520 wipes) designed to
simulate 5 years of single-patient use for the ACON On Call Sure/Sure Sync Blood
Glucose Monitoring System. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the
validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
10. The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic (EMC)
testing was performed and the ACON On Call Sure/Sure Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring
System were found to be compliant.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable.
