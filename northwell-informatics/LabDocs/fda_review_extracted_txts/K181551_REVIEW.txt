the urine specimen reacts with the dye conjugate (mouse anti-β-hCG antibody-colloidal gold
conjugate specific to the beta subunit of hCG) and forms a complex. This complex migrates
by capillary action along the test strip to the α-hCG antibody test line; If hCG is present in
the sample, the complex is captured onto the test line, where if hCG is present at
concentrations above the cutoff, a red line becomes visible indicating a positive result. If
hCG is not present in the sample above the cutoff, no line is visible on the test line,
indicating a negative result. The control line should develop regardless of the test line result,
if the test was correctly used and/or performed correctly, since mouse anti-β-hCG antibody-
colloidal gold conjugate is present in excess to bind to the antibodies at the control line,
resulting in a visible red line.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision study were performed for the DAVID One Step Prescription Pregnancy Test
Strip, DAVID One Step Prescription Pregnancy Test Cassette, and DAVID One Step

hCG traceable to the WHO 5th IS. The DAVID One Step Home Use Pregnancy Test
Strip and the DAVID One Step Prescription Pregnancy Test Strip are identical except
for the intended user, therefore the DAVID One Step Prescription Pregnancy Test Strip
was used in this study. The DAVID One Step Prescription Pregnancy Test Cassette and
the DAVID One Step Home Use Pregnancy Test Cassette are identical, therefore the
DAVID One Step Prescription Pregnancy Test Cassette was used in this study.
Samples created had concentrations of 0, 3, 6, 7.5, 9, 10, 15, 25 mIU/mL. Samples
were masked and randomized prior to testing. The study was conducted in replicates
of 10 for 5 days using 3 different lots of each format in 3 sites with one format per site.
A total of 150 test results per lot of device for each concentration were obtained. The
results for each format are summarized in the following tables

Effects of hCG β-core Fragment:
To evaluate potential interference by hCG β-core fragment, a negative urine sample and
a urine sample with 10 mIU/mL were spiked with hCG beta core fragment (traceable
to WHO reference reagent 99/708) to yield samples with concentrations of
(62,500, 125,000, 250,000, 500,000, and 1,000,000 pmol/L. These samples were
tested with 3 lots of each device. The data obtained demonstrated that there is no
interference by hCG β-core fragment at the concentrations tested.
Cross reactivity of similar compounds:
To evaluate cross-reactivity, hCG negative urine and hCG positive urine containing 10
mIU/mL hCG were spiked with various concentrations of glycoprotein hormones:
Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle stimulating Hormone (FSH), and thyroid
stimulating hormone (TSH). These samples were tested using 3 lots of each device. The
results demonstrated there is no interference from the tested glycoprotein hormones up
to 500 mIU/mL LH, 1000 mIU/mL FSH, and 1000 µIU/mL TSH in either negative or
positive urine samples
pH Interference Study：
To evaluate potential interference from changes in urine pH, urine samples containing 0
mIU/mL 10 mIU/mL were tested with 3 lots of each device using samples at pH 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, and 9. The results demonstrated that samples within the pH range of 4-9 do not
interfere with either positive or negative results from the device.
Specific Gravity Interference study:
To evaluate potential interference from changes in specific gravity, testing was
performed with urine samples containing 0 mIU/mL and 10 mIU/mL hCG were
adjusted to specific gravities spanning the physiological range and tested with 3 lots of
each device. The results indicate that changes in specific gravity do not interfere with
either positive or negative results from the device
High dose hook effect study:
To evaluate the high dose hook effect, testing was performed with hCG free urine
sample was spiked with varying hCG concentration of ranging from 50 mIU/mL to
2,000,000 mIU/mL. These samples were tested using 3 lots of each device. The result
show that there is no hook effect observed at the concentrations tested.
