L. Test Principle:
The Immunalysis Ethanol Alcohol Enzyme Assay technology is based on the oxidation of
ethyl alcohol to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD) reduced to NADH resulting in an absorbance change measured
spectrophotometrically at 340nm. The concentration of ethanol in the sample is directly
proportional to the ADH activity.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To evaluate linearity and recovery, a study was conducted on the Beckman Coulter
AU400e analyzer by measuring twelve levels of human urine, serum and plasma
samples in triplicate, with the mean of the three measurements used to calculate the
recovery. Drug-free human urine, serum and plasma were spiked with ethanol
(EtOH) to prepare the high pool at approximately 550 mg/dL, which was confirmed
by gas chromatography. The remainder of the samples were prepared by intermixing
the high pool with a low pool to obtain concentrations across the measuring range.
The linearity results are shown below:

measurements from unaltered drug free negative human urine, serum and plasma. The
Limit of blank (LoB) for each matrix was calculated using two lots, and the higher
calculated LoB of the two lots was used as the claimed LoB and to calculate the Limit
of Detection (LoD). The claimed Limit of Blank (LoB) of the assay is 0.481 mg/dL
for urine, 0.668 mg/dL for serum and 0.652 mg/dL for plasma.
Limit of Detection (LoD): Four low level samples of each matrix containing
concentrations in the range LoB to 4 x LoB were tested in replicates of five on two
reagent lots over three days for a total of 60 replicates per lot. The LoD was
calculated according to the formula LoD = LoB + (Cp x SD ) where Cp is derived
L
from the 95th percentile of the standard Gaussian distribution and SD is the
L
estimated standard deviation. The sponsor claims an LoD of 1.3 mg/dL for urine, 1.7
mg/dL for serum and 1.7 mg/dL for plasma.
Limit of quantitation (LoQ): Four independent samples of each matrix spiked at low
concentration of ethanol were measured in two runs in replicates of five for three days
on two reagent lots for a total of 60 replicates per lot. The LoQ was calculated based
on % CV ≤10% and Bias ≤10% and was determined to be 2.9 mg/dL for urine, serum
and plasma.
e. Analytical specificity:
1. Interference studies were performed in accordance to CLSI EP07-A2. Test
solutions for each compound were prepared by spiking the potential interfering
compound into drug-free negative urine containing ethanol concentrations of 10
mg/dL and 100 mg/dL. The following substances at were tested at the indicated
concentrations, and none of these compounds demonstrated significant
interference (defined by the sponsor as ≥10% bias).

3. Interference – pH
To evaluate potential interference from the effect of urine pH, device
performance in the quantitative mode was tested using a range of urine pH
values. All test samples were prepared in drug-free urine containing EtOH at
concentration of 10 mg/dL and 100 mg/dL. No interference was observed at
urine pH values ranging from 3.0 to 11.0.

4. Interference - Specific Gravity
To evaluate potential interference from the specific gravity of urine, device
performance in the quantitative mode was tested using a range of
physiologically relevant urine specific gravity values. All test samples were
prepared in drug free urine containing EtOH at concentration of 10 mg/dL and
100 mg/dL. No interference was observed at urine specific gravity values
ranging from 1.000 to 1.030.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed using unaltered clinical urine, serum and
plasma samples. 80 urine samples, 76 serum samples and 64 plasma samples with
concentrations covering the measuring range of candidate device were evaluated.
Results were compared to the predicate device, the Lin-Zhi Ethyl Alcohol Enzymatic
Assay, using linear regression and the study results are summarized in the table
below.
