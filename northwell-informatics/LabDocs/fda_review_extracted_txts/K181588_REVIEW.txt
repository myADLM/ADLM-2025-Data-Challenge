IEC 61010-1, Edition 3.0: 2010, Safety requirements for electrical equipment for
measurement, control and laboratory use – Part 1: General Requirements.
IEC 60601-1-2, Edition 3.0: 2007, Medical electrical equipment - Part 1-2: General
requirements for basic safety and essential performance - Collateral Standard:
Electromagnetic disturbances - Requirements and tests.
L. Test Principle:
The blood glucose testing is based on the measurement of electrical current generated by the
reaction of glucose with the reagent of the strip within the Sensor Module. The system
measures the current, calculates the blood glucose level, and displays the result. The strength
of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the blood
sample. The final results are communicated to the smart mobile device through a mobile
application.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed repeatability (within-day) studies using venous whole blood
samples adjusted to five different glucose concentrations (approximately 49, 106,
143, 246 and 392 mg/dL). Each glucose level was analyzed in replicates of ten, using
sensor modules with test strips from three lots and ten meters for a total of 100 tests
per each glucose level. Results are summarized below:
Repeatability precision summary:
Glucose Level
Mean (mg/dL) SD (mg/dL) % CV
(mg/dL)
30 - 50 48.6 2.0 4.1
51 - 110 105.5 3.3 3.1
111 - 150 143.4 4.2 2.9
151 - 250 245.7 7.0 2.9
251 - 400 391.7 11.2 2.8
Intermediate precision was evaluated over 10 days using five levels of glucose
control solutions with glucose concentrations of approximately 50, 95, 135, 245 and
309 mg/dL. Each sample was measured ten times using sensor modules with test
strips from three lots and ten POPS! one meters. These tests were performed over ten
days, for a total of 100 tests per glucose level. Results are summarized below.

151 - 250 245.0 7.5 3.1
251 - 400 308.8 8.2 2.7
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using sensor modules with test strips from three lots and 11
mixed pools of venous whole blood samples with glucose concentrations of
approximately 17, 41, 59, 101, 145, 187, 279, 388, 429, 521 and 622 mg/dL as
measured by YSI 2300. Each level was measured in replicates of 15 and the values
from the POPS! one meters were compared with those obtained from YSI 2300.
Linear regression analysis of the results yielded the following:
Lot 1: y = 1.008x – 0.076 R2 = 0.998
Lot 2: y = 1.002x + 0.599 R2 = 0.998
Lot 3: y = 1.004x + 0.541 R2 = 0.997
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range
of 20-600 mg/dL. If a sample is less than 20 mg/dL glucose, the meter’s mobile
application will display the error message “Your result was less than 20 mg/dL,
which is lower than the measuring range of the meter”. If a sample exceeds 600
mg/dL glucose, the meter’s mobile application will display the error message: “Your
result was greater than 20 mg/dL, which is higher than the measuring range of the
meter”. These low and high functions were validated and demonstrated to function
as intended.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The POPS! one Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to NIST SRM
# 917c glucose reference material.
Sensor module stability:
The stability of the POPS! one sensor module was assessed using accelerated and
real-time studies. The testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed
and found to be acceptable to support the manufacturer’s labeled claims for a
shelf life stability of 6 months for a sealed package (sensor module in foil

packaging) and 5 days for an opened package (sensor module outside of the foil
package) at the recommended storage temperatures of 35.6°F-86°F (2°C-30°C)
and 10-90% relative humidity.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20 to 600 mg/dL based on linearity studies above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by spiking venous whole blood to achieve three
glucose levels (50 -70 mg/dL, 110 –130 mg/dL and 225 -270 mg/dL). Each of these
samples was divided into a test sample with the potential interferent added and a
control sample with no added interferent. Each sample was measured using ten
meters and sensor modules with test strips from three lots, for a total of 30 replicates
per sample. Results on the candidate meter from the test samples were compared to
results on the candidate meter from the control sample. No interference was defined
by the sponsor as ≤ 10% bias at each glucose level. The highest concentrations at
which no significant interference was observed are presented in the following table:

instructions from the product labeling. A total of 362 POPS! meters, three lots of
sensor modules and 6 iPhones (model 6,6,7, 7 plus and 8) were used. Results were
analyzed by comparing the blood glucose results obtained by the lay users with the
POPS! one Blood Glucose Monitoring System against results obtained with a
laboratory-based comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The glucose
concentrations in the samples ranged from 53-553 mg/dL, as measured by the YSI
2300. The results are summarized below:

Accuracy at Extreme Glucose Values:
A study to evaluate the performance of POPS! one Blood Glucose Monitoring System
in the extreme upper and lower ends of the claimed measuring range was performed
using 50 altered samples with glucose concentrations below 80 mg/dL and 50
samples greater than 250 mg/dL. Samples were altered by spiking or glycolysis in
order to obtain the appropriate glucose concentrations. Samples were tested in
replicates of six using two POPS! one meters and sensor modules with test strips from
three lots, and compared to the average of two YSI 2300 measurements.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1) Hematocrit Study:
To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the POPS! one Glucose Monitoring System,
venous whole blood samples were adjusted to hematocrit levels of 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%,
40%, 45%, 50%, 55% and 60%. Each hematocrit level was adjusted to achieve five
concentrations within the following ranges: 30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250 and 251-
400 mg/dL. Each sample was then tested using 10 POPS! one meters and sensor modules
with test strips from 3 lots. The values were compared with the average of 4 glucose
measurements obtained from YSI 2300 analyzer. The % biases relative to the comparator
method were acceptable within the claimed hematocrit range of 20% to 60%.
2) Altitude study:
To evaluate the effect of altitude on blood glucose measurement of POPS! one Blood
Glucose Monitoring System, a study was conducted using venous whole blood samples
adjusted with 7 concentration levels of glucose ranging from 51 to 600 mg/dL. Samples
were placed under conditions to simulate 4 different altitude conditions from sea level to
4500 meters (15,000 feet). Each blood sample was tested using 4 POPS! one meters and
one lot of sensor modules; the values were compared with the values obtained with the
YSI 2300 analyzer outside of the pressurized chamber. The results demonstrate
acceptable bias to YSI 2300 to support the claims in the labeling that glucose
11

--- Page 12 ---
measurement performance of the POPS! one System is maintained at altitudes ranging
from the sea level up to 4,500 meters (15,000 feet).
3) Operating conditions:
The effect of temperature and relative humidity on the POPS! Blood Glucose Monitoring
System was evaluated using venous whole blood samples adjusted to approximately 65
mg/dL, 125 mg/dL, and 320 mg/dL glucose. Testing was conducted under the following
temperature and relative humidity (RH) combinations: 8°C (46.4°F) and 42°C (107.6°F)
at 10% and 90% RH each and at 25°C (77°F) at 60% RH. Four POPS! one meters and
three lots of test strips were used. Values measured by the POPS! one glucose meters
were compared to results from the comparator method YSI 2300. The study results
support the operating condition claim of 50 to 104°F (10 to 40°C) with relative humidity
of 15% to 85%.
4) Sample volume study:
The sponsor performed a study to support the claimed minimum sample volume for the
POPS! one system. Venous whole blood samples with three levels of glucose
concentrations (50-65, 100-120, and 200-250 mg/dL) were tested at six sample volumes
(0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8, μL) using 3 lots of test strips and 10 meters. Values
obtained were compared to YSI 2300 values. The meter has an error message that is
displayed on the mobile application when not enough blood is added to the test strip. This
feature was validated and was shown to function as intended. Results support the claimed
minimum sample volume of 0.5 μL.
5) Sample perturbation study:
The sponsor performed sample perturbation studies using venous whole blood samples
comparing meter readings to YSI 2300 results. Results were obtained without
perturbation of the test strip and with perturbation. The results demonstrate that the
performance of POPS! one Blood Glucose Monitoring System is not affected by
perturbed sample.
6) Intermittent sampling
The sponsor assessed the performance of the device when intermittent sampling occurs
using venous whole blood samples comparing meter readings to results from the
comparator method YSI 2300. Results were obtained by adding samples to the test strip
that were less than the required volume followed by a second sample application to the
test strip. The results demonstrate that the performance of POPS! one Blood Glucose
Monitoring System is not affected by intermittent sampling.
7) Testing with used test strips
The sponsor assessed the performance of the device when used test strips were inserted
into the meter . Each test resulted in an error message displayed on the mobile
application. The results demonstrate that the error code functions as intended when used
test strips are used.
12

--- Page 13 ---
8) Infection Control:
The device is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed on the meter materials by an outside commercial laboratory, demonstrating
complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant Micro-
Kill+™ Disinfecting Wipes (EPA Registration Number 59894-10-37549). Robustness
studies were also performed by the sponsor using the POPS! one Blood Glucose
Monitoring System and demonstrating that there was no change in the performance of the
system or in the internal and external materials of the meter after 260 cycles of cleaning
and disinfection cycles, using the chosen disinfectant, to simulate cleaning and
disinfecting the meter once per week over the expected service life of 5 years for a single-
patient use glucose meter. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the
validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
9) A variety of mechanical and durability tests (i.e., drop, vibration, shipping) were performed
demonstrating that the meter is robust to environmental and mechanical stresses.
10)Electrical Safety and EMC testing
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing had been performed and the system was
found to be compliant.
11)The test strip and sensor module lot release protocols and criteria were reviewed and
found to be acceptable.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
