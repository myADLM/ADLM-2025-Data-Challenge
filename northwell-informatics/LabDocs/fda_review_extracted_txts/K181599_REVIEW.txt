Unicel DxH 800 System
I. Device Description:
The Unicel DxH 800 Coulter Cellular Analysis System with Early Sepsis Indicator Application is the
quantitative measurement of Monocyte Distribution Width (MDW).is a quantitative, automated
hematology analyzer, and its reagents, controls and calibrators last cleared under K140911. The addition
of the MDW parameter required software algorithm modifications. The system provides a Complete
Blood Count (CBC), Leukocyte 5 Part Differential (Diff), Reticulocyte (Retic), Nucleated Red Blood
Cell (NRBC) on whole blood, as well as, Total Nucleated Count (TNC), and Red Cell a quantitative,
automated hematology analyzer Count (RBC) on Body Fluids (cerebrospinal, serous and synovial). The
MDW parameter added in this submission measures the dispersion (i.e., standard deviation) around the
mean of the monocyte volume population in whole blood. Throughput, as defined for CBC/DIFF (CD)
or CBC/DIFF/Retic (CDR) panel panels, is not impacted with the addition of the MDW parameter to the
differential results. The Early Sepsis Indicator Application is disabled by default at installation. When the
Early Sepsis Indicator Application is activated, the MDW parameter is enabled for reporting.

--- Page 3 ---
The Unicel DxH 800 system is composed of two primary components, an analyzer which processes
specimens and a workstation which processes results using a multidimensional clustering algorithm that
identifies the WBC cell populations. The workstation implements the algorithm for calculating MDW
results, which are generated by the analyzer from a scatterplot of light scatter correlated to the volume of
the cells to identify the monocyte population. The monocyte population is characterized using Volume
(V), Conductivity (C) and multiple angles of Light Scatter (Sn). Volume measurements correlate to cell
size. Monocytes are identified in the Volume (V) versus Rotated Light Scatter (RLSn) dataplot. Once the
monocyte population is identified, a histogram of monocyte volume distribution is generated from which
the MDW value is calculated. The MDW is calculated as the Standard Deviation (SD) of a set of
monocyte cell volume values.

L. Test Principle:
The Coulter Principle of automated cell counting and sizing is used in the analysis of the whole blood
and body fluid specimens; MDW measurements will be determined on whole blood specimens only.
Each cell suspended in a conductive liquid (diluent) acts as an insulator. As each cell goes through the
aperture, it momentarily increases the resistance of the electrical path between two submerged electrodes
on either side of the aperture. This causes a measurable electronic pulse. While the number of pulses
indicates particle count, the amplitude of the electrical pulse is proportional to the cell volume. These
pulses are sent to the Signal Conditioner for analog to digital conversion. Pulse counts and digitized
pulse measurements are sent to the System Manager for processing by the algorithms where the reported
parameter values, flags and histograms are generated.
The COULTER VCSn technology is used to determine the white cell differential, nucleated red blood
cell count, reticulocyte and monocyte parameters along with associated flags, messages, histograms and
data plots.
The sample preparation and analysis use specific reagents and analytical processes for the WBC
differential, NRBC and Retic analysis. The prepared sample is delivered to the flow cell for sample
detection. As the cells pass through the sensing zone, a diode laser illuminates the particles causing light
scatter and light absorption. Simultaneously to the light scatter measurements, cell volume and cell
conductivity are also measured. Monocytes are identified in the volume versus Rotated Light Scatter
(RLSn) dataplot. MDW is calculated as the standard deviation of the observed monocyte cell volumes in
a whole blood specimen.
5

--- Page 6 ---
The data collected during each of the analytical processes is transferred to the System Manager where the
digital raw values are processed by the algorithm using mathematical approaches designed for finding
optimal separation between clusters of data. The identified clusters are used to calculate the frequency of
cells within each population, generate parameter values, flags, histograms and data plots.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The system precision of the MDW parameter using COULTER 6C Plus Cell Controls on the
DxH 800 system was assessed using CLSI EP05-A3, Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative
Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline-Third Edition, October 2014. The measurement
procedure precision using control materials evaluated with three (3) instruments at three (3)
independent sites. A single lot of COULTER 6C Plus Cell Controls and at least three (3) lots of
COULTER DxH Diluent and COULTER DxH Diff Pack reagents were used during the testing
with each of the three (3) sites having a different set of reagent lots. The controls were run in
triplicate, twice each day (morning and afternoon) for a minimum of five (5) days. A different
vial of control was used for each test day. Repeatability and Reproducibility results are provided
in Table 1 below.

Repeatability was also assessed by replicate analysis of the same specimen (n=10). Repeatability
was achieved with a %CV limit at or below 10.0. Specimens with system messages and/or
suspect messages were not used for analysis.
The system precision performance for ESI on the DxH 800 hematology analyzer using whole
blood specimens was assessed according to CLSI EP05-A3, Evaluation of Precision of
Quantitative Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline-Third Edition, October 2014 and
CLSI H26-A2: Validation Verification and Quality Assurance of Automated Hematology
Analyzers, June 2010.
The precision profile was evaluated based on the CV% of ten replicates, from a total of 36
K2EDTA whole-blood samples. Analyzed samples recovered MDW values from 14 to 39. Whole
blood repeatability was also assessed in conjunction with Monocyte% and Monocyte# for each
individual sample. All CV% for individual specimens were <10% for MDW and similar to CV%
for Monocyte %. Results with MDW flags and/or messages were excluded. The repeatability
CV% was estimated at different MDW levels are shown in Table 2 below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Sample Stability: To characterize the specimen age profile for the MDW parameter on the DxH
800 system stability was evaluated by testing 20 whole-blood samples in duplicate from zero to
four hours. All samples were tested at each point in time. Samples were stored at 23.9°C (75°F).
MDW must be tested from a (K EDTA) whole-blood venous sample within 2 hours of collection.

The effect of time on MDW is summarized in Tables 3 - 5 below.

Mean 16.77 17.75 18.79 18.90 18.84
A second-degree polynomial was used to model the change of MDW over time. Drift at each
time point was calculated as the difference between the predicted response from the regression
model at each time point and the predicted response at time zero.
Standard error of the drift was based on the standard errors of the polynomial estimates and their
covariance. The two-sided confidence limit of the drift was calculated based on the standard error
and 95% confidence.
The estimates of regression parameters are shown in Table 4 and estimated drifts in Table 5.

Refrigerated samples cannot be used for MDW testing. Characterization studies have shown an
increase in MDW values when samples are refrigerated.
COULTER Latron CP-X Control Lot to Lot Variability (long-term)
The repeatability and reproducibility specifications of the currently cleared Latron CP-X
parameters as well as the D (V2) Sepsis parameter was verified per CLSI EP05-A3: Evaluation of
Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods. Three lots of Latron CP-X were
evaluated. One new vial of each lot of Latron CP-X Control was sampled twice daily (AM and
PM) with two aspirations being collected at each sampling for 20 days (20 x 2 x 2). The vials
were discarded at the end of each day. Testing was conducted at ambient room temperature on
one DxH 800. All currently cleared Latron CP-X parameters as well as the Sepsis D (V2)
parameter met the Repeatability Specification of ≤3% CV and all currently cleared Latron CP-X
parameters met the Reproducibility specification of ≤5% CV and the D (V2) met the
Reproducibility Specification of ≤4% CV.
Closed vial stability performance of three lots of Latron CP-X Control
The closed vial stability performance of three lots of Latron CP-X Control across the product’s
storage temperature range of 2-30⁰C was evaluated according to CLSI EP25-A: Evaluation of
Stability of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents; Approved Guideline. Wayne, PA: Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute; 2009. Test Methodology: Three lots of Latron CP-X Control were
tested. All currently cleared parameters and the D(V2) parameter were evaluated. Two vials per
lot of Latron CP-X were removed from each storage condition (2-8⁰C, 25°C and 30⁰C) and
aspirated 6 times per vial. Lots were tested at approximately 0, 3, 6 9, 12 and 13 months from
date of fill. Closed vial stability is 365 days while open vial stability is up to 30 days.

COULTER 6C Plus Cell Control: The COULTER 6C Plus Cell Control included for use with
the Early Sepsis Indicator Application is the current COULTER 6C Cell Control (K081822),
assayed to include values for the MDW and LDW parameters. The COULTER 6C Plus Cell
Control is an integrated control that enables monitoring of system performance for CBC, Diff,
NRBC, MDW and LDW parameters. The two new parameters, MDW and LDW, are contained
in each of the three levels of this cell control and represent dispersion values for different size
populations of white cell subsets. The MDW parameter provides a larger dispersion value above
the sepsis cutoff value. The LDW parameter provides a smaller dispersion value near or below
the sepsis cutoff value. Both values indicate that the UniCel DxH 800 Coulter Cellular Analysis
System is capable of calculating a range of clinical values for distribution width of cell
populations.

NOTE: LDW is designed to enhance control of population dispersion calculations; it is not
designed as part of patient result evaluation. LDW is only available in CBC/DIFF (CD) and
CBC/DIFF/Retic (CDR) panels for cell controls when the Early Sepsis Indicator is activated.
COULTER LATRON CP-X: A suspension of stable polystyrene particles of uniform size with
a diameter CV of ≤3.0%. Latron CP-X is used as part of the daily quality control procedure to
monitor the stability of the electrical processing and the fluidic flow rate systems used to measure
the volume (size), conductivity and light scattering characteristics of cells as they pass through
the flow cell. It is also used by Beckman Coulter manufacturing and service engineers to calibrate
the differential volume measurements. The MDW parameter cannot be reported if the D (V2)
parameter fails for the COULTER LATRON CP-X Control.
Note: The COULTER LATRON CP-X Control is an existing product (initially cleared under
(K885028) and has been modified with tighter expected ranges for control monitoring of the
differential volume measurement.
Calibrator:
COULTER S-CAL Calibrator used with the DxH 800 is used to determine the calibration factors
for directly measured CBC parameters; it is not required differential parameters. See K840794.
Since the MDW and LDW parameters are derived from
the monocyte and lymphocyte differential, the use of a calibrator is not required for the Early
Sepsis Indicator Application.

f. Comparability Sampling Modes
This study was performed to assess the impact on MDW parameter results due to sampling via
the Closed Vial Cassette sampling mode and the Open Vial Single-Tube sampling mode on the
DxH 800. A total of 60 whole blood specimens (20 normals and 40 abnormals) drawn into tubes
containing K2EDTA anticoagulant, were randomly analyzed in duplicate on a single DxH 800, in
closed vial (cassette) sampling mode and in the open vial (single-tube) sampling mode. Testing
was performed at controlled room temperature. Testing of the MDW parameter in the Open Vial
Single-Tube sampling mode was found to be equivalent to the Closed Vial Cassette sampling
mode. Results are summarized in Tables 8 and 9 below.

g. Comparability Tube Diameter
To generate an accurate MDW requires that the aspirated sample is sampled from a homogeneous
mixture. A nonhomogeneous sample resulting from poor quality sample mixing will result in
changes in the monocyte volume distribution and consequently MDW. Effective sample mixing,
i.e., creating a homogenous mixture, requires an air bubble and that the air bubble travel the
length of the tube during inversion. As the sample tube diameter decreases, the quality of sample
mixing can be adversely impacted because the effects of surface tension increase; which
increases the difficulty for the air bubble to travel the length of the tube. The purpose of this
study was to determine the effects of smaller diameter tubes on the quality of mixing as indicated
by changes in the MDW parameter when compared to a standard sized 13 mm diameter tube. To
limit the variability of the test to just tube diameter, tubes with the same anticoagulant from the
same manufacturer were selected. This study demonstrated that K2EDTA tubes having a
diameter of 8 mm and greater are acceptable for use on the DxH 800. The recommended

h. Effect of Incomplete Lysing on MDW (NRBC Interference)
This study was performed to assess the potential interference on MDW’s diagnostic ability in the
presence of nucleated red blood cells (NRBC’s). Within the differential analysis the NRBC’s are
spatially separated from the monocyte population; however, NRBC’s have characteristics that
place them in a region where other cellular material, such as red cell debris and giant platelets
occurs, preventing the precise and accurate identification and enumeration within the differential
analytical process. For these reasons the DxH 800 uses a separate VCS analytical process that
uses different reagents to identify and enumerate the NRBC. This study demonstrated that the
diagnostic ability of MDW is not affected by the presence of NRBC’s above the clinical cut-off
of ≥1.0%. For results, refer to Tables 12 and 13 below

patient whole-blood results and patient controls:
· MDW results for patient samples will be shown as incomplete (.....).
· MDW results for patient samples processed as controls will be shown as incomplete (.....).
An incomplete computation is reported under the following conditions:
· When there are not enough (< 100) monocyte events for the reporting of results.
· When excessive debris is detected due to incomplete lysing.
In this case, the user will determine the cause for the incomplete computation by multiplying
MO% x Displayed Count (located in the Additional Data screen - Diff tab):
· If the monocyte count is < 100 events, this is indicative of not enough events for the
reporting of results.
· If the monocyte count is > 100 events in the presence of excessive debris, this is
indicative of incomplete lysing.
Samples should be rerun if incomplete computation occurs. If a significant increase in the
frequency of incompletes, the user will contact Beckman Coulter for assistance.
NOTE:
· Patients who receive an incomplete MDW result may not necessarily be excluded from
the possibility of having sepsis
· The Patient Result screen displays MDW as part of the differential parameters. Flags,
codes, and messages that apply to the differential parameter also apply to the MDW
parameter. (Please refer to K081930, K120771, K140911).

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
A blinded, prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study was conducted at three sites
comprised of both academic and community hospital emergency departments in the United
States. MDW performance was established using Sepsis-2 (ACCP/SCCM 2001 consensus
criteria). The study enrolled a total of 2,158 consecutive adult emergency-department patients (≥
18 and ≤ 89 years of age) meeting inclusion criteria for:
· Having a CBC-DIFF performed upon presentation and
· Subjects remaining in the hospital (emergency department or in-patient) for at least 12
hours
The prevalence of sepsis as defined by the Sepsis-2 (ACCP/SCCM 2001 consensus criteria) was
13

--- Page 14 ---
17.8%. All subjects were adjudicated by two qualified physicians following the ACCP/SCCM
2001 consensus definition for Sepsis-2 and the recent Sepsis-3 definition. Discordant results
were arbitrated by a 3rd physician. No cases were excluded due to inability to arbitrate. Clinical
diagnosis was based upon medical information obtained within 12 hours of emergency-
department presentation. The presence of infection was determined based upon retrospective
chart review of clinical symptoms and tests performed within 12 hours of ED presentation. Test
results were obtained from the medical records 5-10 days later, including cultures, molecular
tests, tissue pathology, etc. Additional blood cultures obtained after 12 hours of presentation
were not considered in the determination of sepsis. For subjects to be considered for infection or
sepsis diagnosis, evidence of a protocol defined infection work-up was required in the data
extracted from the medical charts. If infection work-up was not performed within 12 hours or if
the adjudicator believed that the infection work-up showed no evidence of infection then, the
patient was classified as “Control” or “SIRS”. In order to categorize a patient as “Sepsis”, SIRS
criteria and an infection-work-up had to be fulfilled within 12 hours of presentation. The subject
categories included:
· Non-SIRS - case controls, subjects having 0 to 1 SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response
Syndrome) criteria and no infection
· SIRS - subjects having ≥ 2 SIRS criteria
· Infection -subjects having suspected or confirmed infection with 0 – 1 SIRS criteria
· Sepsis - subjects having infection plus ≥ 2 SIRS
· Severe sepsis - subjects having sepsis with one or more organ failure
· Septic shock -subjects having sepsis with severe hypotension
All sites were required to extract the same information to enable adjudication based on the case
report form, however the diagnostic evaluation for infection was not prescribed by the study but
rather followed the standard of care at the institution. Some subjects lacked cultures (87% had
cultures drawn, 46% were positive), and empiric therapy was considered to be part of the
infectious disease work-up. Some subjects (<1%) may not have had any additional evaluation for
sepsis besides the administration of antimicrobials but may have had an infectious workup
conducted with a previous admission or physical exam findings suggestive of infection.
Differences in diagnostic evaluations for infection added to the uncertainty in the clinical trial
results.
The emergency-department population demographics based upon presenting clinical status are
summarized in Table 16, subject demographics are summarized in Table 17, and the results of
microbiological testing for subjects diagnosed with sepsis are summarized in Table 18 below.

MDW results were compared to the clinical adjudication of sepsis per Sepsis-2 Criteria (defined
as a documented or suspected infection together with two or more SIRS criteria).
Of the 2,158 subjects enrolled in the prospective clinical study, MDW trended upwards with
sepsis and MDW values >20 were highly prevalent in the sepsis group. However, a proportion of
subjects without sepsis also had elevated MDW values (Table 19).

Figure 1.1: Distribution of MDW Values for Various Sub-populations
A cutoff of 20.0 units was validated to differentiate between sepsis and other conditions in
emergency-department patients. The MDW parameter upon emergency-department presentation
is modestly predictive of the development of sepsis within the first 12 hours of emergency-
department presentation. Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve (ROC) analysis yielded an area
under the curve (AUC) of 0.789 (95% CI 0.762 to 0.815). See Figure 1.2, Capacity of MDW to
Differentiate between Sepsis (ROC Curve) and All Other Conditions.
Table 20 titled “Performance of MDW for Sepsis”, summarizes the sensitivity, specificity,
positive and negative predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios with their
respective 95% confidence intervals based on the established optimal cutoff of 20.0 units.
MDW values between 19.0 and 19.5 units have a higher sensitivity for predicting sepsis, but
lower specificity (for example, more false-positive results). The impact on sensitivity and
specificity for early detection of sepsis at different MDW cutoffs is provided in Table 21.

Added Value Analyses
In the following analyses, the current standard of care is guided by WBC which is a component
of the SIRS criteria. Based on the data from the clinical trial, AUCs of the ROC curves for the
detection of sepsis are calculated for WBC as a single parameter and WBC+MDW combination.
Results are graphically presented in Figure 1.3, ROC Curves Comparison while AUC estimates
along with their 95% confidence intervals and are summarized in Table 22, AUC for WBC and
Combined WBC+MDW. These results apply to this multi-center observational clinical trial and
may not be generalizable to other patients in different institutions.

*Standard Error
The AUC for WBC+MDW is greater than the AUC for WBC alone. The difference
between the two models was shown to be statistically significant.
The added value of MDW combined with WBC was integrated into an assessment for
the probability of the disease. Pre-test and post-test probabilities for different
combinations of tests are shown in Table 23, Pre-Test and Post-Test Probabilities for
Different Combinations of Tests. This table summarizes the positive likelihood ratios
and post-test probabilities for WBC only or when used in conjunction with MDW. The
following decision rules are used for considering a result as abnormal:
· WBC > 12x103/μL
· WBC < 4x103/μL
· MDW > 20.0
· (WBC > 12x103/μL or WBC < 4x103/μL) and MDW > 20.0
An abnormal WBC result increases the probability of a patient having or developing
sepsis to 44.7% when the pre-test probability is 17.8%, based on the incidence of sepsis
in the clinical study. The post-test probability increases to 63.5% when WBC is
abnormal and MDW > 20.0. This represents an overall increase of 46% in the
probability of being septic when both tests being abnormal. This analysis includes
patients based on request for CBC-DIFF therefore, results may not be generalizable.
Normal WBC test results will reduce the probability of sepsis. The post-test probability
of a normal WBC test is 7.9%, but this value goes down to 2.9% if both WBC and
MDW are normal. Thus, the probability of sepsis in this clinical cohort, based on a
sepsis incidence of 17.8%, is reduced when both tests are normal.

The clinical study data was also analyzed using an alternative definition of sepsis to
define a comparator method positive. MDW performance is lower when applying
Sepsis-3 criteria as the comparator method when compared with Sepsis-2. This is
expected as MDW is intended to identify patients early in the disease progression,
prior to organ dysfunction. The performance of MDW when using Sepsis-3 criteria to
determine a positive comparator method result is summarized in Tables 24 and 25.

Clinical Performance differentiating between SIRS and Sepsis
An assessment was done to establish the performance of the MDW parameter to
differentiate between adult patients with inflammation (≥ 2 SIRS) and infection (sepsis)
from adult patients with inflammation only (≥ 2 SIRS). A total of 441 patients had ≥ 2
SIRS which represents 20% of the emergency-department population.
The performance of MDW to differentiated between SIRS and sepsis in emergency-
department patients at a cutoff of 20.0 units was reported. Receiver Operator
Characteristics Curve (ROC) analysis yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.756
(95% CI 0.723 to 0.789). See Figure 1.4, Capacity of MDW to Differentiate between
SIRS and Sepsis (ROC Curve).
A summary of the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and
positive and negative likelihood ratios with their respective 95% confidence intervals is
shown in table 26, Performance of MDW to Differentiate between SIRS and Sepsis.
The impact on sensitivity and specificity for early detection of sepsis from SIRS at
different MDW cutoffs is provided in Table 27, Sensitivity and Specificity at Various
MDW Cutoffs to Differentiate between SIRS and Sepsis.

Clinical Population Analyzed by White Blood Cell Interferences and MDW Cut-off
The pivotal clinical data was evaluated for the number of samples and relative percent
of total samples found with and without White Blood Cell flags at the MDW cut-off
values and by the MDW’s diagnostic ability in the presence of other abnormal cell
types as indicated by the presence of suspect messages (blasts, immature granulocytes
and variant lymphocytes) that occur in the peripheral blood in the presence of a clinical
condition or disease. Differential suspect messages are summarized in Table 28. While
there does not appear to be significant interference with the MDW assay, the number of
patients with sepsis was too small to make any conclusions on the potential impact
upon the MDW parameter. A labeling limitation has been included to indicate the
clinical performance of the MDW has not been established in patients with
hematological abnormalities, such as blast cells. Results are found in Tables 29-41
below.

Pre-existing Clinical Conditions
Assay performance was assessed with respect to the potential differences in monocyte
response to sepsis in the presence of pre-existing clinical conditions. The following five
(5) categories of pre-existing conditions (summarized below) were evaluated based on
their potential impact to the measurement of MDW: Immune Suppression, Immune
Stimulants, Malignancy, Antibiotic Treatment, and Lifestyle/Behavior. There does not
appear to be statistically significant interference with the measurement of MDW for the
pre-existing conditions tested but the number of patients is small. The assay labeling
includes a limitation indicating that clinical performance in patients receiving immune
stimulants or those with alcoholism is unknown.
Category 1: Immune Suppression
· Subjects with neutropenia (defined as absolute neutrophil count <1,500/μL)
· Subjects with suspected immune suppression due to HIV, organ or bone marrow
transplant.
· Subjects with suspected immune suppression due to chemotherapy. The
chemotherapeutic agent was recorded as well as the time from last
chemotherapeutic treatment [<1 month; >1 month].
· Subjects on chronic treatments (≥2 weeks) with potent immune suppressants,
including high-dose corticosteroids (prednisone ≥20 mg/day), anti-TNFα
molecules, methotrexate (≥15 mg/week), azathioprine (≥75 mg/day),
cyclophosphamide (any dose) or mycophenylate (≥1000 mg/day) or any
combination of these treatments (at any dose) .
· Subjects currently or recently (within one week) treated with Hydroxyurea.
Category 2: Immune Stimulant Treatments
· Subject on treatment for neutropenia, including Neupogen, Filgrastim, Leukine,
Granix or Sargramostim.
Category 3: Malignancy
· Subjects with malignancy, hematologic (lymphomas, multiple myeloma, acute
and chronic leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes, aplastic anemia). The
malignancy was recorded.

Category 4: Antibiotics
· Subjects treated with antibiotics within the past 7 days for active infection prior
to ED. The antibiotic was recorded.
· Subjects treated with antibiotics for primary prophylaxis prior to ED (HIV,
PSCT, etc.). The prophylactic antibiotic was recorded.
Category 5: Lifestyle/Behavior
· Subjects with a current diagnosis of “alcoholism” or current history of heavy
alcohol consumption, as defined by the CDC (≥15 drinks/week for men; ≥8
drinks/week for women) or a blood alcohol level on admission to the ED.
· Subjects that smoke.

4. Clinical cut-off:
The clinical MDW cut-off of 20.0 was established through a blinded prospective multi-
center pilot study; other cut-offs are provided as informational purposes only
5. Expected values/Reference range:
To assess the normal reference interval of the MDW parameter for apparently healthy
adults a total of 146 specimens (70 females and 76 males) were collected and tested within
two (2) hours of collection at the sites and evaluated per CLSI EP28-A3c: Defining,
Establishing and Verifying Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory. Approved
Guideline (10/2010). Subjects were enrolled from health and wellness screening programs
and had normal WBCs and monocyte differentials. The 146 subjects were enrolled from
three locations and were representative of the geographic and demographic diversity of the
United States. A non-parametric approach was used to calculate the lower and upper limits of
the reference interval using 95% confidence. The 95% reference interval for MDW on the
DxH 800 hematology analyzer across all participating sites is 13.98 - 21.28. The 90%
confidence intervals for the lower and upper bounds of the reference limits were also
calculated. Tables 55-58 summarize the characteristics of the expected values and the
demographics of the study subjects.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
DxH 800 specimen analysis can occur via several sampling methods on the analyzer (see
modes of operation above).
5. Calibration:
The DxH 800 COULTER S-CAL Calibrator is used to determine the calibration factors for
directly measured CBC parameters; it is not required for differential parameters. See K840794.
Since the MDW and LDW parameters are derived from the monocyte and lymphocyte
differential, the use of a calibrator is not required for the Early Sepsis Indicator Application.
6. Quality Control:
COULTER 6C Cell Control (K081822) enables monitoring of system performance for all
directly measured and calculated CBC, Diff and NRBC parameters.
COULTER LATRON CP-X Control (K885028) determines calibration factors to ensure
accurate measurements of directly measured CBC parameters. Assigned assay values are
traceable to reference methods. The MDW parameter cannot be reported if the D (V2)
parameter fails for the COULTER LATRON CP-X Control.
Q. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not Applicable
R. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
S. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
The potential value of MDW reporting to help aid in the diagnosis sepsis should be established
by the individual testing site in consideration of current testing practices. MDW is not
validated for clinical use in patient populations outside adults treated in the emergency
department.
Local education concerning reporting and interpretation guidelines should be established and
facilitated by joint decisions between various clinical care groups (Laboratory, Infectious
Diseases, Intensivists, antibiotic stewardship committee, etc.)
T. Patient Perspectives: This submission did not include specific information on patient
perspectives for this device.
