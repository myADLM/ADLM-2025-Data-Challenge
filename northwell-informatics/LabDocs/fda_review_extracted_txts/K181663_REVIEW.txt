H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The GenMark ePlex Blood Culture Identification Gram-Positive (BCID-GP) Panel is a
qualitative nucleic acid multiplex in vitro diagnostic test intended for use on GenMark’s
ePlex Instrument for simultaneous qualitative detection and identification of multiple
potentially pathogenic gram-positive bacterial organisms and select determinants
associated with antimicrobial resistance in positive blood culture. In addition, the ePlex
BCID-GP Panel is capable of detecting a wide variety of gram-negative bacteria (Pan
Gram-Negative assay) and several Candida species (Pan Candida assay). The ePlex
BCID-GP Panel is performed directly on blood culture samples identified as positive by a
continuous monitoring blood culture system and which contain gram-positive organism.
The following bacterial organisms and genes associated with antibiotic resistance are
identified using the ePlex BCID-GP Panel: Bacillus cereus group, Bacillus subtilis group,
Corynebacterium, Cutibacterium acnes (Propionibacterium acnes), Enterococcus,
Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus, Listeria, Listeria
monocytogenes, Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus
epidermidis, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Streptococcus, Streptococcus agalactiae
(GBS), Streptococcus anginosus group, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus
pyogenes (GAS), mecA, mecC, vanA and vanB.
The ePlex BCID-GP Panel contains assays for the detection of genetic determinants
associated with resistance to methicillin (mecA and mecC) and vancomycin (vanA and
vanB) to aid in the identification of potentially antimicrobial resistant organisms in
positive blood culture samples. The antimicrobial resistance gene detected may or may
not be associated with the agent responsible for disease.
The ePlex BCID-GP Panel also contains targets designed to detect a broad range of
organisms with a potentially misleading Gram stain result or organisms that may be
missed by Gram staining altogether, for example in the case of co-infections. These
include a broad Pan Gram-Negative assay as well as a Pan Candida assay, which is
designed to detect four of the most prevalent Candida species: Candida albicans,
Candida glabrata, Candida krusei and Candida parapsilosis.

The detection and identification of specific bacterial and fungal nucleic acids from
individuals exhibiting signs and/or symptoms of bloodstream infection aids in the
diagnosis of bloodstream infection when used in conjunction with other clinical
information. The results from the ePlex BCID-GP Panel are intended to be interpreted in
conjunction with Gram stain results and should not be used as the sole basis for
diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions.
Negative results in the setting of a suspected bloodstream infection may be due to
infection with pathogens that are not detected by this test. Positive results do not rule out
co-infection with other organisms; the organism(s) detected by the ePlex BCID-GP Panel
may not be the definite cause of disease. Additional laboratory testing (e.g. sub-culturing
of positive blood cultures for identification of organisms not detected by ePlex BCID-GP
Panel and for susceptibility testing, differentiation of mixed growth and association of
antimicrobial resistance marker genes to a specific organism) and clinical presentation
must be taken into consideration in the final diagnosis of blood stream infection.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
• For prescription use only
• For in vitro diagnostic use only
Limitations:
• For prescription use only.
• This test is a qualitative test and does not provide a quantitative value.
• This product should not be used with blood culture media that contains charcoal.
• False results were observed for some targets using the BacT Alert FN Plus bottle type
(see the Sample Matrix Equivalency (Bottle Evaluation) section of the package insert for
additional details) and with a specific lot of BD BACTECTM Plus Anaerobic bottles.
• Bacterial and fungal nucleic acids may be present in blood culture, independent of
bacterial or fungal viability. Detection of an assay target does not guarantee that the
corresponding bacteria or fungi are infectious or are the causative agents for clinical
symptoms.
• There is a risk of false negative results due to the presence of sequence variants in the
bacterial or fungal targets of the test.
• For some strains within the Corynebacterium, Streptococcus and Pan Candida results,
100% detection was not observed at concentrations expected at bottle positivity. See the
Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity) section for additional details.
• A result of “No Targets Detected” on the ePlex BCID-GP Panel does not preclude the
possibility of bacterial or fungal infection. A specimen with a result of No Targets
Detected may contain an organism not targeted by the ePlex BCID-GP Panel.
• Antimicrobial resistance can occur via multiple mechanisms. A “Not Detected” result for
3

--- Page 4 ---
the BCID-GP antimicrobial resistance gene assays does not indicate antimicrobial
susceptibility. Subculturing and standard susceptibility testing of isolates is required to
determine antimicrobial susceptibility.
• In mixed cultures, the ePlex BCID-GP Panel may not identify all organisms in the
specimen, depending upon the concentration of each target present.
• The results of the ePlex BCID-GP Panel should not be used as the sole basis for
diagnosis, treatment or other patient management decisions.
• Bacillus badius was shown to cross-react with the Bacillus subtilis group assay.
• Burkholderia cepacia was shown to cross-react with the Corynebacterium assay at levels
≥1x107 CFU/mL.
• An unspeciated Rhodococcus strain (ATCC 49988) was shown to cross-react with the
Micrococcus assay at levels ≥1x107 CFU/mL.
• The genus level and group assays included as a part of the BCID-GP Panel are designed
to detect a broad range of species but will not necessarily detect all species within a genus
or group. For species detected by these assays please refer to the analytical and in silico
inclusivity sections of this package insert.
• For genus level assays it is possible that an unspeciated target may be masked in the case
of a co-infection. For example, in the event that an unspeciated Staphylococcus species is
present in the same sample as a Staphylococcus epidermidis, there is no ability to
determine that the unspeciated Staphylococcus species is present.
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use with the GenMark ePlex instrument
I. Device Description:
The ePlex BCID-GP Panel is based on the principles of competitive nucleic acid
hybridization using a sandwich assay format, wherein a single-stranded target binds
concurrently to a sequence-specific solution-phase signal probe and a solid-phase
electrode-bound capture probe. The test employs nucleic acid extraction, target
amplification via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription PCR (RT-
PCR), and hybridization of target DNA. In the process, the double-stranded PCR
amplicons are digested with exonuclease to generate single-stranded DNA suitable for
hybridization.
Nucleic acid extraction from biological specimens occurs within the cartridge via cell
lysis, nucleic acid capture onto magnetic beads, and release for amplification. The nucleic
acid extraction is processed through microfluidic liquid handling. Once the nucleic acid
targets are captured and inhibitors are washed away, the magnetic particles are delivered
to the electrowetting environment on the printed circuit board (PCB) and the targets are
eluted from the particles and amplified.
During hybridization, the single-stranded target DNA binds to a complementary, single-
stranded capture probe immobilized on the working gold electrode surface. Single-
stranded signal probes (labeled with electrochemically active ferrocenes) bind to specific
4

--- Page 5 ---
target sequence / region adjacent to the capture probe. Simultaneous hybridization of
target to signal probes and capture probe is detected by alternating current voltammetry
(ACV). Each working electrode on the array contains specific capture probes, and
sequential analysis of each electrode allows detection of multiple analyte targets.
A summary of the ePlex BCID-GP Panel nucleic acid targets is presented in Table 1
below.

Genus and Group Assay Result Interpretation
The ePlex BCID-GP Panel Enterococcus result is based on three assays: the species-specific
Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium assays and a broad Enterococcus assay. The
broad Enterococcus assay will detect Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium,
however, its primary purpose is to detect non-faecalis/faecium Enterococcus species. If all
three assays are negative, the Enterococcus result will be Not Detected. If any of the three
assays is positive, the Enterococcus result will be ‘Detected’. If only the Enterococcus assay
is positive, an unspeciated Enterococcus species has been detected. Interpretations of results
for Enterococcus are described in Table 3 below.

ePlex BCID-GP Panel Test Reports
Several different reports are available on the ePlex System. Results are provided in a
printable format and may be viewed electronically or exported for additional analysis.
Reports can be customized with account specific information such as the address, logo and
institutional specific footers on each report.
Detection Report
The ePlex BCID-GP Panel Detection Report includes the results for each individual sample
run on the ePlex System. The Summary section indicates the overall test result and lists all
detected targets in that sample. The Results section includes a list of all targets on the panel
with an individual result for each target. Results are reported as Detected, Not Detected, or
Invalid (displayed as a red x); results for the Internal Control are reported as PASS, FAIL,
INVALID, or N/A.
External Control Report
The ePlex BCID-GP Panel External Control Report is generated for an external control that
has been pre-defined in the ePlex BCID-GP Panel Software. For more information on
defining external controls on the ePlex System, refer to the ePlex Operator Manual.
The Summary section indicates the overall result (PASS or FAIL status) and lists all detected
targets for that external control. The Results section includes a list of all panel targets with
the result, expected result and PASS/FAIL status for each. Results are reported as Detected,
Not Detected, or Invalid (displayed as a red x). A target is reported as PASS if the actual
result matches the expected result (as defined for that control); a target is reported as FAIL if
the actual result does not match the expected result. If the actual result for each target
matches the expected result (all targets reported as PASS), the overall result for the external
control is reported as PASS in the Summary section. If the actual result for any target does
not match the expected result, the overall result for the external control is reported as FAIL in
the Summary section.
Summary Report
The Summary Report allows the operator to use searchable criteria to create customized
reports, using specified targets, dates, range of dates, sample, external control, test bay, or
operator.

L. Test Principle:
The ePlex Blood Culture Identification Gram-Positive (BCID-GP) Panel is based on the
principle of competitive nucleic acid hybridization using a sandwich assay format, wherein a
single-stranded target binds concurrently to a sequence-specific solution-phase signal probe
and a solid-phase electrode-bound capture probe. The test employs nucleic acid extraction,
target amplification via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription PCR (RT-
PCR) and hybridization of target DNA. In the process, the double-stranded PCR amplicons
are digested with exonuclease to generate single-stranded DNA suitable for hybridization.
Nucleic acid extraction from biological samples occurs within the cartridge via cell lysis,
nucleic acid capture onto magnetic beads, and release for amplification. The nucleic acid
extraction is processed through microfluidic liquid handling. Once the nucleic acid targets
are captured and inhibitors are washed away, the magnetic particles are delivered to the
electrowetting environment on the printed circuit board (PCB) and the targets are eluted from
the particles and amplified.
During hybridization, the single-stranded target DNA binds to a complementary, single-
stranded capture probe immobilized on the working gold electrode surface. Single-stranded
signal probes (labeled with electrochemically active ferrocenes) bind to specific target
sequence/region adjacent to the capture probe. Simultaneous hybridization of target to signal
probes and capture probe is detected by alternating current voltammetry (ACV). Each
working electrode on the array contains specific capture probes, and sequential analysis of
each electrode allows detection of multiple analyte targets.

a. Analytical Sensitivity:
The limit of detection (LoD) of the ePlex Blood Culture Identification Gram-
Positive Panel was assessed with by testing pooled analytes at a range of
concentrations (CFU/mL). Each pool was comprised of an organism mix
combined together in negative blood matrix. LoD was determined using
qualified stocks of organisms with documented CFU/mL that were pooled
together and serially diluted to create organism mixes at the test
concentrations. Each assay’s LoD was determined by testing at least two
strains or species. The Pan Gram-Negative assay was evaluated with 6
species due to its broad specificity. Testing was initially done using 3 test
concentrations per multi-organism mix. Testing was performed with a
minimum of two ePlex consumable lots using multiple instruments and
17

--- Page 18 ---
covered a minimum of two testing days. A minimum of 20 replicates per
organism mix were tested at each concentration.
A summary of the determined LoD with the overall detection rate is shown
in Table 10 below. The target LoD was conservatively established based on
the observed testing outcomes. The species tested for each genus level call or
antibiotic resistance marker is noted in parentheses, where appropriate.

potential sources of variability, such as site-to-site, lot-to-lot, day-to-day, and
operator-to-operator. One ePlex instrument per study site with four towers
was employed in this reproducibility study. Two operators performed testing
at each site on six days (five nonconsecutive days) with three unique lots of
ePlex BCID-GP Panel cartridges. A reproducibility study panel consisting of
four panel members; including 9 on-panel organisms and three antibiotic
resistance genes representing 15 targets at two concentrations and one
negative mix including an off-panel organism were tested in triplicate.
Concentrations in the positive mixes reflected those observed at time of
bottle positivity plus 8 hours (BP+8) and time of bottle positivity (BP) and
one mix containing an off-panel organism grown to bottle positivity, which is
expected to yield a negative result.
Summary results for the ePlex BCID-GP Panel reproducibility study are
provided in Table 11 below.

Internal Controls:
Each ePlex BCID- GP Panel cartridge includes internal controls that
monitor performance of each step of the testing process, including
extraction, amplification and detection of targets.
Each amplification reaction on the cartridge has an internal control and in
each reaction either the internal control or a target must generate signal
above the defined threshold for a valid test result. Internal control results are
interpreted by the ePlex Software and displayed on the ePlex BCID-GP
Panel Reports as Internal Control with a result of PASS, FAIL, N/A or
INVALID. Table 12 includes details on the interpretation of Internal Control
results.

Recommended External Controls: External controls are not provided with
the ePlex BCID Gram-Positive Panel, but are recommended in the package
insert. Positive and negative external controls should be tested with each
new lot of reagents or monthly, whichever occurs first. Blood culture
medium can be used as the negative control. Previously characterized
positive samples or blood culture medium spiked with well characterized
organisms can be used as the external positive control. External controls
should be run in accordance with laboratory protocols and accrediting
organizations, as applicable.

Specimen Stability
A specimen stability study was performed to confirm the stability of
specimens stored under four different temperature conditions over multiple
time points which vary based on storage temperature. Organism mixes
whose members were at a concentration approximating bottle positivity
were stored at ≤-70°C, ≤-20°C, 2° - 8°C, and ambient temperature over
various time points described in Table 13 below.

*Mix 1 was tested up to 3 months; Mix 2 was tested up to 1 month.
These organism mixes represent each of the eight multiplex amplification
pools on the BCID-GP Panel and include common gram-positive bacteria,
drug resistance genes, bottle contaminants (Lactobacillus, Corynebacterium,
Cutibacterium), gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungal
(Candida albicans) targets. Twenty replicates were tested at the beginning
of the study when organism mixes were freshly made (time point T0). Ten
replicates were tested for each additional temperature and time point.
Ambient Storage Condition
All Mix 1 and Mix 2 analytes showed positivity rates of >95% when stored
under ambient temperature for up to 1 month. The positivity rates and mean
signals (nA) are summarized for Mix 1 and Mix 2 in Table 14 and Table 15,
respectively.

Freeze-Thaw Study
A study was performed to assess the tolerance of the ePlex BCID-GP to
correctly identify specimens containing bacterial and fungal organisms that
have gone through one or two freeze/thaw cycles prior to testing. One
hundred and ten positive clinical samples that were tested fresh during the
BCID-GP Panel Clinical Performance Study were selected to best represent
a variety of organisms in clinical samples. The samples were frozen at ≤-

Panel.
The positive agreement with the fresh condition at each freeze-thaw cycle
was calculated and was above 95% for each condition. Table 23 below
summarizes the concordance at each freeze-thaw cycle with a 95%
confidence level.

Results demonstrate that the BCID-GP Panel can detect the same organisms
in samples that were tested fresh and in samples that have been frozen and
thawed up to 2 times.
In-Cartridge Sample Stability Study
An analytical study was carried out to demonstrate performance under the
following conditions:
1) Condition 1 (Open Pouch): the cartridge is stable for 2 hours after
the pouch has been opened and the unloaded cartridge is exposed to
the environment.
2) Condition 2 (In-Consumable Sample Stability): the cartridge can be
stored at room temperature for at least 2 hours after the sample has
been loaded prior to running the cartridge in an ePlex bay.
A test mix of five organisms was used in the study. The selected organisms
represent each of the eight multiplex primer pools on the BCID-GP Panel
and produce nine target results. Each organism was tested at a concentration
approximating bottle positivity. A description of the test mix used for this
study is summarized in the Table below.

The open pouch stability study compared 20 replicates of cartridges that
were kept in closed pouches until the cartridges were loaded with sample vs.
20 replicates of cartridges where the pouches were opened and the cartridges
were exposed to ambient room temperature conditions for up to 2 hours
before being loaded with sample.
To demonstrate that the consumable can be held at room temperature for at
least 2 hours after the sample has been loaded (prior to running the
consumable on an ePlex bay), 20 consumables were loaded with the
organism mix, within 20 minutes of opening the pouch. The consumables
were kept for 2 hours at room temperature and then run in the ePlex
instrument.
A control condition was run wherein 20 replicates of the organism mix were
loaded within 20 minutes of pouch opening and the consumables were run
on the ePlex instrument within 20 minutes of sample loading. The data from
the test conditions were compared to the control condition and all cartridges
were run on the ePlex instrument following packing insert instructions.
The results of the study which assessed the interim storage conditions are
summarized in Table 25. All representative targets were detected in all
replicates (20/20) in the control and the two test conditions (Open Pouch
Stability Condition and In-Consumable Sample Stability Condition).

e. Growth and Detection Study
A study was performed to establish the range of expected organism
concentrations present in incubated blood cultures at bottle positivity (i.e.,
bottle “ring) and eight hours after bottle positivity/bottle “ring.” A total of
22 representative organisms (from organism glycerol stocks) were tested in
this study. A minimum of eight organism-appropriate blood culture bottles
were procured and decontaminated with 10% bleach and 70% isopropyl
alcohol. The volume of negative human whole blood, determined by the
manufacturer’s instructions, was inoculated into each bottle and grown to
bottle positivity and bottle positivity + 8 hours. At the time of positivity
(and/or eight hours after positivity), the blood culture was removed from the
instrument for determination of organism concentration (CFU/mL using a
plate count procedure) and ePlex BCID panel testing.
The following table summarizes the concentration of organism (CFU/mL)
determined for a representative panel of 22 isolates. The concentration of
Corynebacterium striatum at bottle positivity was observed to be the lowest
of all the bacterial species tested so a second round of growth was tested to
confirm the reproducibility of the counts. In addition, the Corynebacterium
genus is large (at least 88 species) so additional species were cultured and

f. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity):
The analytical reactivity of the ePlex BCID-GP Panel was evaluated with a
collection of 489 bacterial and fungal organisms that represent the diversity of the
ePlex BCID-GP Panel analytes, including antimicrobial resistance genes. Isolates
were selected to represent relevant species or serotypes and selection with specific
inclusion of more commonly encountered species and known human pathogens.
When possible, in silico analysis of sequence data was used to make predictions of
assay reactivity for less common species that were not tested but that may be
detected by the ePlex BCID-GP Panel.
Each isolate was initially tested in blood culture matrix at a concentration consistent
with the levels of organism enumerated from blood cultures at the time of positivity
(see Growth and Detection section above) and were tested in triplicate. If an isolate
was not detected initially, the sample was retested at higher concentrations. If
detected at the higher concentration(s), the species/isolate is indicated as detected
with reduced sensitivity and the concentration of organism that was detected is
indicated. If not detected at the highest concentration the isolate is listed as not
detected by the ePlex BCID-GP Panel. Results are provided below:

In addition to species-specific assays, the ePlex BCID-GP Panel contains a number of
broader genus or group-level assays; including Bacillus cereus group, Bacillus
subtilis group, Corynebacterium, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Listeria, Micrococcus,
Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Streptococcus anginosus group, Pan Candida and Pan
Gram-Negative assays. The following tables predicted (in silico) reactivity
(inclusivity) for these assay targets.
Note: the performance of the ePlex BCID-GP Panel has not been established for all of
the organisms listed in the tables below. See the Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)
and Limit of Detection (Analytical Sensitivity) sections for data on organisms for
which performance characteristics have been established (indicated with an asterisk in
Tables 31-41). Some species were not assessed in silico due to lack of sequence data,
though they may appear in the analytical sensitivity or specificity studies.

The Pan Gram-Negative assay was designed to be broadly inclusive of the majority
of gram-negative organisms.
g. Analytical specificity (Exclusivity):
Cross-reactivity of on-panel and off-panel analytes was evaluated with the BCID-GP
Panel. Bacterial targets were tested in triplicate at a concentration of ≥1x109 CFU/mL
while fungi were tested in triplicate at a concentration of ≥1x107 CFU/mL. If the
target concentration could not be reached, the organism was diluted 2-fold from stock
for use.
No cross reactivity was observed for any of the on-panel gram-positive organisms.

h. Assay cut-off:
Analytical studies were conducted to establish the signal boundaries for all targets
and controls of the ePlex BCID-GP Panel.
A mixture of clinical samples, contrived bottle positives, and organisms spiked at or
above the analytically determined limit of detection were used as samples for the
study. Positive data points from samples at or greater than the determined LoD test
concentration in the Limit of Detection study were used to supplement the Cutoff
study data. Negative data points for all targets were obtained from the Limit of Blank
study. Expected negative data points from replicates that were positive for other
targets in the LoD and Cutoff studies were also combined to increase statistical power
of the ROC analysis.
For each target, the signals for positive and negative tests were analyzed. An
appropriate boundary was established wherein specificity and sensitivity were
maximized. The analysis was verified by ROC analysis. The final boundary set points
are listed in Table 43 below.

i. Interference:
Two organism mixes consisting of 9 on-panel organisms representing 14 targets and
negative blood matrix were used to assess eighteen potentially interfering substances
and thirteen bottle types for interference. Potentially interfering test substances were
spiked at levels predicted to be above the concentration of the substance likely to be
found in a blood culture specimen. The positivity of the organisms for each
potentially interfering substance at the initial testing concentration is summarized in
Table 44 and 45.

additional C. acnes false negative was observed. Therefore, γ-globulin was diluted
and tested until all expected targets were detected.
k. Mixed Culture Study (Microbial interference):
A study was performed to evaluate whether the presence of high levels of organisms
will interfere with detection of representative organisms at bottle positivity and bottle
positivity +8 hours concentrations. The study evaluated the possibility of high
concentration organisms interfering with detection of lower concentration targets in
the same sample. Eight clinically-relevant co-infection organisms were selected for
the study. Selection of the organisms in the mixes was based on those that have been
identified in peer-reviewed literature as common polymicrobial co-infections. Testing
was performed in triplicate on the BCID-GP Panel

*Per Bottle Positivity Study, this organism concentration did not increase after 8 hours of culture post bottle ring. The
concentration at bottle positivity was rounded up to the next integer log concentration to
serve as a second (high) test concentration for this study.
**Cutibacterium granulosum is an off-panel organism (not detected by BCID-GP Panel).
Study results demonstrated that high concentrations of the on-panel BCID-GP
microorganisms spiked into blood culture samples produced positive results for the
relevant assays on the BCID-GP Panel but did interfere with any expected results for
other analytes. High concentrations of off-panel BCID-GP microorganisms also
showed no interference with the detection of any ePlex BCID-GP organism with no
unexpected false negative or false positive results observed.
l. Testing of Additional Blood Culture Bottle Types
Thirteen different blood culture bottle types from three different blood culture
systems (BacT/Alert, BACTEC and VersaTREK) were evaluated analytically with
the BCID-GP Panel. Blood culture bottles/media were tested with the recommended
ratio of blood to media. Testing was performed using two organism mixes whose

members were present at a concentration approximating blood culture bottle
positivity in a clinical sample. These organism mixes represent each of the eight
multiplex amplification pools on the BCID-GP Panel and include common gram-
positive bacteria, drug resistance genes, bottle contaminants (Lactobacillus,
Corynebacterium, Cutibacterium), gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungal
(Candida albicans) targets. The 13 bottle types listed in the table below were
evaluated and study results demonstrated correct positive and negative BCID-GP
Panel results with each bottle type.

Eleven of the bottle types tested showed no interference for any of the targets tested.
BD Bactec Anaerobic/F had 95% detection of C. acnes; this organism was tested at
Limit of Detection (LoD) concentration. BioMérieux BacT Alert Standard Aerobic
observed false positives in the control runs in one of two tested lots. However, false
positives were not detected in samples from seven bottle lots used in the clinical
study. Together, this data suggest that the bottle is not inhibitory and it is considered
acceptable for use with the BCID-GP Panel, but an elevated level of false positive
results is possible with certain bottle lots. The appropriate limitation is included in the
package insert. The BioMérieux BacT Alert FN bottle type may result in lower
sensitivity for some targets. The appropriate limitation statement for this specific
bottle type is included in the package insert.

m. Carryover Study:
The carryover/cross-contamination rate of the ePlex BCID-GP Panel and ePlex
instrument was evaluated using a checkerboard approach by running high positive
and negative samples interspersed in all bays of a four-tower ePlex instrument (i.e.,
24 bays total) over five separate runs on five separate days. The positive sample was a
multi-organism mix containing bacterial species at 1x109 CFU/mL and one fungal
species at 1x107 CFU/mL. The organism levels were higher than typically found in
positive blood cultures in order to challenge the system for potential cross
contamination. On each round of testing, 24 ePlex BCID-GP Panel cartridges were
evaluated. 100% of the positive sample runs resulted in detection of S. aureus, mecA,
E. faecium, vanA, Pan Gram-Negative, and Pan Candida. No false positives were
detected in the negative runs indicating no carryover or cross-contamination was
observed between bays or within bays with the ePlex BCID-GP Panel when testing
samples consecutively or in adjacent bays with an ePlex instrument.

3. Clinical studies:
The clinical performance of the ePlex BCID-GP Panel was established during multi-
center clinical studies conducted at seven distinct U.S. test sites in two phases. Each test
site was representative of the intended use setting (clinical laboratories) and testing was
performed by trained clinical laboratory personnel. From June 2014 through July 2016,
400 samples were prospectively collected and frozen; from January through February
2018, 319 samples were prospectively collected and tested fresh (never frozen) for a total
of 719 samples across the 2 phases. 8 of these samples were withdrawn; 5 due to the
sample coming from a patient already enrolled; 1 was collected outside of the required
timeframe; 1 was not viable upon subculture and 1 was from an autopsy. Samples with
final, valid ePlex BCID-GP Panel results and valid comparator results were considered
evaluable. Of the 711 prospectively-collected samples eligible for testing, all 711 were
evaluable. Demographic information for prospectively collected samples is described in
Table 48. Subjects enrolled in this study were from a diverse demographic distribution
and represent the intended patient population.
To supplement the number of positives for low prevalence targets in the prospective
collection, 586 samples were collected retrospectively and all 586 were evaluable.
Demographic information for retrospectively collected samples is described in Table 49.

microbiological and biochemical techniques for organism identification. Identification for
samples with Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis, or
Candida parapsilosis identified by standard laboratory procedures were confirmed using
analytically validated PCR assays followed by bi-directional sequencing or 16S
sequencing. For antibiotic resistance genes, the ePlex BCID-GP Panel was compared to
analytically validated qPCR amplification assays followed by bi-directional sequencing
in samples with an associated organism identified (i.e., Staphylococcus, Enterococcus).
The comparator method(s) results were used to determine the Detected/Not Detected
status for each target organism on the ePlex BCID-GP Panel. The comparator methods
for each target are summarized in Table 50.

propinquum, C. riegelii, and C. sundsvallens
Sensitivity or positive percent agreement (PPA) was calculated by dividing the number of
true positive (TP) results by the sum of TP and false negative (FN) results, while
specificity or negative percent agreement (NPA) was calculated by dividing the number
of true negative (TN) results by the sum of TN and false positive (FP) results. A TP result
being defined as a sample where the detected ePlex BCID-GP Panel result matched the
detected comparator method result, while a TN result was one where a negative ePlex
BCID-GP Panel result matched a negative comparator method result. The two-sided 95%
confidence interval was also calculated.
A total of 711 prospectively-collected samples (312 tested fresh and 399 tested after
previously frozen) and 586 retrospectively collected samples as well as 565 contrived
samples were evaluated for the ePlex BCID-GP Panel targets. Contrived samples were
prepared by spiking an isolate into a blood culture bottle and growing until flagged
positive by a continuously monitoring blood culture system. Samples were removed from
the system within 8 hours of positivity and stored frozen until the time of testing. PPA
and NPA results are summarized by target in Tables 51-74 and the strains used to
contrive samples are summarized in Table 75.

S. lugdunensis) with mecA identified by comparator methods, whereas ePlex BCID-GP
detected S. epidermidis with mecA.
A table for mecC is not provided because mecC was only detected in a single species,
Staphylococcus aureus. In the 49 contrived samples with Staphylococcus aureus
containing mecC, the resulting PPA and NPA were both 100%.
The PPA and NPA of the BCID-GP Panel vanA target stratified by the Enterococcus

A table for vanB is not provided because vanB was only detected in 1 clinical sample and
52 contrived samples comprised of two species, E. faecalis (n=43) and E. faecium (n=10),
resulting in PPA and NPA of 100%.
The ePlex BCID-GP Panel identified a total of 103 bacterial co-detections in 1297 clinical
samples (prospective/retrospective). In the 711 prospective samples of the clinical study,
38/711 (5.3%) had double detections and 1/711 (0.1%) had a triple detection. In the 586
retrospective samples, 56/586 (9.6%) had co-detections and 8/586 (1.4%) had triple
detections. Neither the prospective nor the retrospective arms of the clinical studies
contained a sample with more than 3 organisms detected.
In prospective samples, the most common co-detection combination identified by the
ePlex BCID-GP Panel was Enterococcus faecalis with Pan Gram-Negative which was
detected in 6 samples. Pan Gram-Negative was identified in 17 co-detections,
Staphylococcus was identified in 26 co-detections, Enterococcus was identified in 13 co-
detections, and Streptococcus was identified in 12 co-detections. Results are summarized
in Table 83.

* A discrepant result is one that was detected by the comparator method(s) but not by the ePlex BCID-GP Panel (excludes organisms not
targeted by the ePlex BCID-GP Panel). 24 discrepant organisms were investigated using PCR/sequencing; 2 discrepant organisms were
not detected: In 2/6 false negative E. faecalis samples, PCR/Sequencing instead detected Enterococcus faecium.
A. Off-panel organisms not targeted by the ePlex BCID-GP Panel.
External Control testing in the Clinical Study:
External controls used in the clinical study consisted of three positive controls (A, B, C)
and 1 negative control. The positive controls together represent all the targets on the ePlex
BCID-GP Panel. On each day of testing with the ePlex BCID-GP Panel, each site tested
one positive and one negative control. Sites rotated through the 3 positive controls
throughout the study.

no targets were detected. All positive controls tested resulted in the correct targets detected
with the exception of one run. This run failed to detect the Cutibactierium acnes (C. acnes)
target. The concentration of C. acnes in this mix was noted to be at the Limit of Detection
(LoD) and below the bottle positive concentration. Therefore, this result was expected and
accepted.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A prospective, multicenter clinical study was conducted to evaluate the clinical
performance of the ePlex BCID-GP Panel in positive blood culture samples. A total of
711 samples were prospectively collected at 7 clinical sites in 2 phases from patients of
all ages and genders. In the first phase from June 2014 through July 2016, 399 samples
were prospectively collected and frozen; from January through February 2018, 312
samples were prospectively collected and tested fresh (never frozen). The expected
values of individual analytes based on the ePlex BCID-GP Panel results in prospective
samples are summarized by age group and by site in Table 88 and Table 89, respectively.
