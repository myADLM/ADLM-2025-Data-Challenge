H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System is intended for the in vitro rapid
identification (ID) and quantitative determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by
minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Gram Negative aerobic and facultative
anaerobic bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae and non-
Enterobacteriaceae.
2. Indication(s) for use:
BD Phoenix CPO detect is a qualitative confirmatory test that uses a growth-based
algorithm intended to phenotypically detect carbapenemase-production in
Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii on Gram-
negative ID/AST or AST only Phoenix panels. The test also provides the Ambler
classification (Class A, Class B and Class D) of the carbapenemase produced. One of
three test configurations are available per panel for carbapenemase detection with/without
Ambler classification for the target organism groups. BD Phoenix CPO detect does not
report multiple classes of carbapenemases from a single isolate.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Prescription Use only
For in vitro diagnostic use
· Due to the small number of tested isolates identified as harboring carbapenemases
from multiple Ambler classes (n=7), there is limited information on the performance
of the BD Phoenix CPO detect with organisms co-producing different classes of
carbapenemases.
· Carbapenemase positive isolates that are carbapenem susceptible (Enterobacteriaceae,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Acinetobacter baumannii) are rare, as encountered in the
clinical study. Additional confirmatory testing should be conducted before reporting
carbapenemase activity in a susceptible isolate.
· Well-established phenotypic carbapenemase tests (e.g. CarbaNP and mCIM) do not
include testing of Acinetobacter baumannii. End-users should consider other methods
for further characterization of Acinetobacter baumannii if necessary.
· In silico analysis of carbapenemase gene variants was performed in the validation of
the PCR multiplex method for the reference method. Performance with isolates
harboring specific carbapenemase gene variants expressing enzymes from various
Ambler classes by BD Phoenix CPO detect was not determined.
4. Special instrument requirements:
BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System

--- Page 3 ---
I. Device Description:
The Phoenix panel is a sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene tray, with 136
microwells containing dried reagents. The combination panel includes an ID side with dried
substrates for bacterial identification and an AST side with varying concentrations of
antimicrobial agents, growth, and fluorescent controls at appropriate well locations. The
Phoenix system utilizes an optimized colorimetric redox indicator for AST, and a variety of
colorimetric and fluorometric indicators for ID. Phoenix panels are also available in an "ID
Only" format where only the 51-well side is filled with substrates and the 85-well side is
empty. Phoenix panels are also available in an "AST Only" format where both the 51-well
and 85-well sides are filled with antibiotics.
Microorganisms to be tested are isolated from pure culture and preliminarily identified as a
Gram-negative bacillus, Gram-positive coccus or Gram-positive bacillus. For each bacterial
isolate, the inoculum suspension is prepared in the Phoenix ID broth and vortexed to mix.
The appropriate amount of inoculated ID Broth is transferred to the prepared AST Broth
tube, so that the resulting AST inoculum contains approximately 5 x 105 CFU/ml. The
Phoenix ID broth is poured into the inoculation port of the 51-well side (left) of the Phoenix
Combo panel (for ID substrates). The Phoenix AST Broth is poured into the inoculation port
of the 85-well side (right) of the Phoenix Combo panel (for antimicrobials). The panel
barcode is scanned to log-in the panel configuration and the panel is loaded into the Phoenix
instrument. The instrument houses the inoculated panels where they are continuously
incubated at 35°C. The Phoenix instrument reads and records the results of the biochemical
substrates and antimicrobial agents contained in the panel and interprets the reactions to give
an ID of the isolate, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, and category
interpretations of S, I, R or N (susceptible, intermediate, resistant or not susceptible).
BD Phoenix CPO detect is a qualitative growth-based test intended to phenotypically detect
carbapenemase-production in Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and
Acinetobacter baumannii on the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System. The test also
provides the Ambler classification (Class A, Class B and Class D) of the carbapenemase
produced. CPO detect uses the principle of carbapenem resistance to detect the presence of
the carbapenemase, and it employs the principles of Ambler-class specific beta-lactamase
inhibition and Ambler-class specific antibiotic resistance to derive the Ambler class of the
carbapenemase.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute: M100 “Performance Standards for Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Testing.” 28th Edition (January 2018)
L. Test Principle:
The BD Phoenix CPO detect test determines the growth or inhibition of growth with each
antimicrobic agent or antimicrobic agent/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination in relation to
the growth control well. The classification tree algorithms compare these relative growth
rates to a series of thresholds in the decision trees. Based on the resultant profile, the system
will produce a particular result. The CPO detect result does not depend on the MIC or SIR of
any drug on the panel.
The test is offered to users as a choice of multiple configurations—9-well, 6-well, and 2-well
(See Table 1 below). There are different classification tree algorithms for
Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters. The Phoenix instrument calculates both of these
results simultaneously and then reports the appropriate result based on the isolate
identification. The wells for the CPO detect test are specific for the test and are not part of
any drug MIC determination.
If the test is unable to classify the carbapenemase into an Ambler class, then it reports only
the presence of a carbapenemase. When two different Ambler class carbapenemases are
present, BD Phoenix CPO detect will not report multiple classes; e.g., it will not report both
Class A and Class B. For bacteria that produce more than one class of carbapenemase, the
Phoenix test is expected to give a result of positive with no classification.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra- and inter-site reproducibility of the BD Phoenix CPO detect test on the BD
Phoenix System was evaluated at three sites using a panel of Gram-negative isolates.
Thirteen gram-negative organisms were tested, where each site tested the isolates in
triplicate on three different days using Gram Negative Phoenix panels containing
CPO detect and associated reagents. There were two QC isolates included on the
reproducibility panel. Results of the study demonstrated that the BD Phoenix CPO
detect test showed acceptable reproducibility at > 95% with the expected results for
Gram-negative organisms prepared by both manual and Phoenix AP inoculations.
Table 2 below presents the reproducibility of the organism panels with and without
the QC organism data included in the performance calculations.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Clinical fresh and stock isolates were tested across three sites to demonstrate the
performance of the BD Phoenix CPO detect test with multiple lots of BD Phoenix
Gram Negative panels. Challenge isolates obtained from domestic and international
sources were also tested at these sites. All studies were conducted with the 9-well
configuration of the BD Phoenix CPO detect test. For the challenge isolates, Phoenix
System results with the CPO detect test were compared to the expected results.
Phoenix System results for clinical isolates were compared to the results obtained
from the Composite Reference Method, which was based on results from three
different and independent tests. The tests included the following: 1) Phenotypic
testing to detect the presence of carbapenemase expression according to the CLSI-
recommended modified Carbapenem Inactivation Method (mCIM), 2) carbapenem
MIC results obtained by the BD Phoenix cleared system and 3) Molecular (multiplex
PCR amplification) testing to assign the Ambler classification of the enzyme based on
detection of gene or genes associated with each class. All strains were tested using the
mCIM assay and on the BD Phoenix panel. PCR testing was performed as appropriate
based on the reference decision flowchart. Under certain conditions, and to lessen the
burden of extensive PCR testing, the MIC screen was applied for each organism
group (Table 4) and used to determine whether an isolate would proceed to PCR
testing. The possible outcomes for the Composite Reference Method are shown in
Table 5.

Results from these 1452 compliant Gram-negative Phoenix and reference isolates
were used to calculate the performance for BD Phoenix CPO detect test for
carbapenemase detection. Of these 1452 isolates, 317 (21.8%) were challenge isolates
and 1135 (78.2%) were clinical isolates. Clinical isolates were comprised of 416 fresh
isolates (28.7% of total isolates tested) and 719 stock isolates (49.5% of the total
isolates tested). A total of 155 isolates were used from the CDC/FDA AR Bank. The
distribution of isolates according to the Reference Method and BD Phoenix CPO
detect test result is displayed in Table 6. Table 7 and Table 8 show the ability of the
BD Phoenix CPO detect test to identify carbapenemase-producing isolates for all
organisms, and for each organism group, respectively. The classification performance

1The challenge set isolates were well-characterized and compared to the expected results.
2Of the (19) challenge isolates with carbapenemase genes other than blaIMP, blaVIM, blaKPC, blaNDM, blaOXA-48, blaOXA-24, blaOXA-23,
and blaOXA-58, all (19) were reported as carbapenemase producers by the BD Phoenix CPO detect test. These included: (3) blaGES,
(3) blaIMI, (12) blaSME, and (1) blaSPM.
3The specificity of the BD Phoenix CPO detect when testing isolates with known carbapenem resistance by cephalosporinase or
ESBL coupled with decreased permeability through porin mutations among Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and
Acinetobacter baumannii has not been fully evaluated. Out of 735 carbapenem “not susceptible” isolates in the clinical study,
only four were well-characterized strains with such a known resistance mechanism. All four strains were falsely reported as
carbapenemase producers by the BD Phoenix CPO detect test.

The percent of unclassified isolates as determined by the BD Phoenix CPO detect test was 5.2%
(76/1452). For those isolates identified as carbapenemase producers by the Reference Method,
13.2% (64/486) were not assigned to an Ambler class by BD Phoenix CPO detect. Performance of
the device for isolates in which BD Phoenix CPO detect yielded a CPO detection result with
Ambler classification is presented in the Table 10 (n=1357), where the PPA and NPA for each
classification is shown with (95) isolates excluded. Using the data in Table 10 below, the Ambler
class for the carbapenemase was correctly reported by the BD Phoenix CPO detect test the
following % of times—Class A: 93.8% (122/130), Class B: 87.5% (126/144), and Class D: 94.4%
(134/142).

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Of the 735 isolates included in the analysis for carbapenemase detection and reported as
‘not susceptible’ based on conventional phenotypic (AST) results, 506 isolates were
determined to be carbapenemase producers by the BD Phoenix CPO detect test. For the
717 carbapenem susceptible isolates tested, 713 isolates were determined to be negative
for carbapenemase production by the BD Phoenix CPO detect test. Tables 11-14 show
the results of the BD Phoenix CPO detect test compared to susceptibility test results for
the 1452 isolates included in the clinical study (combined and separately by organism
group).

1NS denotes that the isolate was ‘not susceptible’ to at least one of the carbapenems tested. S means the isolate was susceptible to all
relevant carbapenems tested. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii/Acinetobacter calcoaceticus complex,
ertapenem was not used to determine NS as these organisms are intrinsically resistant to ertapenem.
