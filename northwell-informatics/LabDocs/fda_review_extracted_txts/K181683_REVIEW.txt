I. Device Description:
The BD MAX CT/GC/TV 20-Day QC Panel is a quality control material provided to the
customer as 20 individually packaged positive control pellets. Each pellet consists of
inactivated Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Trichomonas vaginalis
microorganisms. The organisms are purified and suspended in a buffered aqueous matrix
(Base Matrix), followed by inactivation by gamma radiation. The organisms are then
quantified by a by quantitative PCR assay and spiked into the Base Matrix at predefined
target concentrations. Aliquots of the suspension are lyophilized and packaged. Each
production lot is tested for purity and is assayed for performance on the BD MAX
instrument.
The pellets are contained in a vial and enclosed in a vacuum sealed foil pouch. The user
opens the pouch, uncaps the tube and transfers the pellet into the BD MAX UVE Sample

test instructions for the BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay. Negative controls are not included in the
panel.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of results obtained with the BD MAX 20-Day QC Panel was
evaluated in a study performed at three sites over five days, with two operators per
site. Three lots of the control material were evaluated by testing with the BD MAX
CT/GC/TV Assay on three BD MAX instruments. Each operator tested three
lyophilized control pellets on each day of the study (3 sites x 5 days x 2 operators x 3
replicates (lots) = 90 measurements in total). Controls associated with incomplete
instrument runs (2) or that produced unresolved results (1) were retested using a new
control pellet according to the Instructions For Use. A Negative Control consisting of
molecular grade water was also tested at least once a day on each instrument to
monitor for contamination. The results of the study are summarized below. All
Negative Controls produced the expected results.

Stability:
1. Shelf life stability was initially determined through an accelerated study with
three lots of the controls. The product was placed into chambers at elevated
temperatures: 43˚C, 53˚C and 63˚C. Each lot was tested in 4 replicates at each
time point: Day 0, Day 14 and Day 42. The stability of the product was evaluated
by calculating the mean Ct value at each time point for CT and for NG and
comparing that to the mean Ct value obtained at Day 0. The data showed that
there was no product degradation under the conditions tested. The change in Ct
score, across the three lots ranged from -0.2 to 1.3 for C. trachomatis, from -0.6 to
1.6 for N. gonorrhoeae, and from -0.5 to 0.6 for T. vaginalis. The data is
summarized below.

stability claim.
2. An in-use stability of the dissolved pellets was evaluated by keeping the hydrated
pellets at room temperature (23˚C) for six hours. The testing was conducted with
4 replicates at 3 and at 6 hours. The calculated % CV (based on Ct values) across
all three analytes ranged from 0.16% to 1.95%, demonstrating no degradation of
the product once hydrated for up to 5 hours at ambient laboratory temperature.
