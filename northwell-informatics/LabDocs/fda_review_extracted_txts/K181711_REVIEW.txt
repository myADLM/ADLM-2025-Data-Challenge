M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of results obtained with the BD MAX Enteric Parasite control
panels was evaluated in a study performed at three sites over five days, with two
operators per site. Each operator tested three lyophilized control pellets on each day
of the study according to the instructions for use (3 sites x 5 days x 2 operators x 3
replicates = 90 replicates in total). Controls associated with incomplete instrument
runs (2) or that produced unresolved results (1) were retested using a new control
pellet according to the Instructions For Use. A Negative Control consisting of
molecular grade water (not provided in the BD MAX Enteric Parasite Control and 20-
Day QC Panels) was also tested at least once a day on each instrument to monitor for
contamination. The results of the study are summarized in Table 1. All Negative
Controls and produced the expected results.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability
Reagent shelf-life was established in an Accelerated Stability Study that was
performed with three lots of BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel controls that were
placed at 43, 53 or 63°C for up to 42 days. All results were as expected and there was
no evidence of product degradation under the conditions tested. The results of this
study were used to support a claimed shelf-life of 18 months at 2-25°C, which will be
verified through a Real-time Stability Study.
Expected Values
The BD MAX Enteric Parasite Control and 20-Day QC Panels are expected to
produce positive results for G. lamblia, C. parvum and E. histolytica when tested with
the BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel on the BD MAX System.

The BD MAX Enteric Parasite Control Panel and BD MAX Enteric Parasite 20-Day QC
Panel do not have assigned values. Performance was evaluated through testing at three
sites using three different BD MAX Systems and three lots of controls (refer to Section
M(1)(a)).

O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
