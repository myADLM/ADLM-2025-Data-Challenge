Number
K172091 CDC Human 8/9/2017 A bundeled 510(k) submission for device modification to add three
Influenza Virus additional options of nucleic acids extraction instrument and extraction
Real-Time RT-PCR method combinations (QIAGEN EZ1 DSP Virus Kit on the QIAGEN
Diagnostic Panel: EZ1 Advanced XL instrument, QIAGEN EZ1 RNA Tissue Mini Kit on
Influenza B Lineage the QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL instrument, and Roche DNA and
Genotyping Kit Viral NA Small Volume Kit on the Roche MagNA Pure 96 instrument)
that are acceptable for use with the four previsouly FDA-cleared
diagnostic kits of the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR
Diagnostic Panel, the Influenza A/B Typing Kit, the Influenza A
Subtyping Kit (Ver 2), the Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Kit, and the

2. Applicant’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in
its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed instructions for use.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S) in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the
FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.
1) To address recent evolutionary changes in circulating influenza B viruses that may impact the
reactivity of the current Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Kit of the CDC Human Influenza
Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (i.e., the prevalence of specific genetic mutations in the
targeted influenza B HA gene is increasing), the CDC Influenza Division modified the existing
FDA-cleared device using the following two design approaches for the VIC and YAM assays.
The first design approach updated individual bases in the existing primer or probe sequences to
eliminate mismatches with the targeted RNA sequences of emerging viruses within each
lineage, B/Yamagata or B/Victoria. The targeted locations of the primer and probe design as
well as all reaction conditions remain essentially the same as the previously FDA-cleared VIC
and YAM assays. These updated assays (primers/probe sets) are named VIC (VER 1.1) and
YAM (VER 1.1). The second design approach targeted a different location on the HA gene of
each influenza B lineage. This approach used a “standard” probe design typical of the other
CDC assays in CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel that target a longer
genetic region and do not incorporate modified bases or minor-groove-binding molecules to
increase annealing temperatures. These modified assays (primers/probe sets) are named VIC
(VER 2) and YAM (VER 2).
2) To incorporate an additional quencher chemistry, ZEN™ (manufactured by Integrated DNA
Technologies), to the previously FDA-cleared influenza B (InfB) assay probe as a

manufacturing option. This represents a continuation of previous efforts and submissions by
CDC Influenza Division in order to extend this manufacturing option to all assays within the
CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. The implementation of the
alternate oligonucleotide probe quencher chemistry, ZENTM, has been addressed in previous
CDC submissions for the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. (e.g.,
K153148 and K161556).
3) The product instructions for use (package insert) was updated primarily to reflect the redesigned
and the modified assays primers and probes. Two different versions of the package insert are
available, each version contains one specific primers/probe set for each of the VIC and YAM
assays only (i.e., VER 1.1 or VER 2, not both).

5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the
device and its components, and the results of the analysis.
The Risk Assessment process used was based on an internal Risk Management Procedure, the
CDC Influenza Division’s Quality Management System DC -10: FluIVD03 Risk Analysis,
which is consistent with the requirements in ISO 14971. Using this procedure, the primary
failures/risks associated with modifying and redesigning the VIC and YAM assay primers and
probes, as well as introducing the alternate oligonucleotide probe quencher chemistry, ZENTM
(manufactured by Integrated DNA Technologies), to the InfB assay probe, were analyzed.
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities
required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.
Based on the Risk Analysis, CDC followed its established internal procedures when
developing, validating, and implementing the modified and redesigned Influenza B Lineage
Genotyping assays. CDC conducted analytical and clinical studies (see Section 6 and Section
7 below) using the modified and redesigned assays to demonstrate that the performance of the
modified Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Kit succefully mitigates the identified potential
risks to an acceptable level.
6. Analytical Performance
Analytical Sensitivity - Influenza B (InfB) Assay
A range finding analytical study was performed to demonstrate Limit of Detection (LoD)
equivalency between the previously FDA-cleared InfB assay probe quenched with BHQ-1 and the
same probe quenched with ZEN. Two characterized influenza vaccine reference viruses of a
known 50% egg infectious dose titer (EID /mL) were extracted using the Roche MagNA Pure
50
Compact RNA Isolation Kit. The RNA was serially diluted and tested (n=3 replicates) in order to
determine the apparent endpoint range using both enzymes cleared for use with the CDC Human
Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. The acceptance criterion for LoD equivalency
was defined as demonstrating 100% positivity (3 out of 3 replicates) at either the same endpoint
LoD concentration or within a 5-fold dilution of each other. All assays demonstrated similar
analytical reactivity in this study (See Table 1 and Table 2 below).

A confirmation of the LoD for each modified or newly designed assay was performed using a
current strain of the corresponding influenza B/Victoria or B/Yamagata lineage. The VER 1.1 and
VER 2 VIC and YAM primer and probe sets were tested alongside the currently FDA-cleared InfB
assay as required for interpretation by the routine testing algorithm. The confirmatory LoD testing
for each primer and probe set was performed on extraction replicates (n=20) of each dilution. The
lowest virus concentration where InfB and VIC or InfB and YAM primers and probes sets
demonstrated ≥ 95% detection is reported as the confirmed LoD for each virus for the
Primers/probe set (See Table 7 below).

Analytical Inclusivity - Modified and Newly Designed Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Assays
Analytical inclusivity testing was performed to demonstrate the capability of the modified VER 1.1
VIC and YAM primers/probe sets and the newly designed VER 2 VIC and YAM primers/probe
sets to detect strains of the corresponding influenza B lineage at or near the confirmed LoD. Ten
influenza B viruses of each lineage and representative of different geographic locations and
phylogenetic clades were selected for this testing. Characterized stocks were serially diluted to
concentrations near the LoD of the assays and extracted using the Roche MagNA Pure Compact
RNA Isolation Kit. Samples were tested in triplicate with the VER 1.1 and VER 2 VIC and YAM
assays with both enzyme systems FDA-cleared for use with the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time

extracted using the Roche MagNA Pure Compact RNA Isolation Kit from 36 organisms (16
viruses, 19 bacteria, and 1 yeast) representing common respiratory pathogens or flora commonly
present in specimens collected from the nasopharynx region. All bacteria, yeast, and non-influenza
viruses were from CDC repositories or acquired from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Manassas, VA) and tested at high titers, typically ≥ 106TCID /mLor EID /mL, ≥ 106CFU/mL,

7. Clinical Performance
Retrospective Study - Influenza B (InfB) Assay
The clinical performance of the InfB assay oligonucleotide probe quenched with ZEN was
evaluated using retrospective clinical samples collected during the 2011-2012 influenza season
that were previously determined to be positive or negative for influenza B virus. A total of 30
positive and 50 negative upper respiratory tract samples were evaluated with the InfB assay using
either the FDA-cleared oligonucleotide probe quenched with BHQ-1 or the oligonucleotide probe
quenched with ZEN. Testing was performed with both enzymes FDA-cleared for use with the
CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel and one of the FDA-cleared
extraction methods. Result interpretation followed the instructions of the Package Insert for the
FDA-cleared Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Kit. The InfB assay containing the oligonucleotide
probe quenched with ZEN demonstrated 100% positive and negative agreement with the FDA-
cleared oligonucleotide probe quenched with BHQ-1 (Table 14 and Table 15 below).

Retrospective Study – VER 2 VIC and YAM Assays
A retrospective study was performed using the VIC (VER 2) and the YAM (VER 2) assays to
supplement the prospective performance assessment. Upper respiratory tract clinical samples were
collected during the 2016-2017 and 2017- 2018 influenza seasons and determined to be positive or
negative for influenza B/Victoria or B/Yamagata viruses using the FDA-cleared Influenza B
Lineage Genotyping Kit. The specimens were tested using the FDA-cleared InfB assay and the
newly designed VIC (VER 2) and YAM (VER 2) assays in this study. A total of 126 upper
respiratory tract clinical specimens positive for either influenza B/Victoria or influenza
B/Yamagataviruses and 61 specimens negative for influenza B viruses were tested. Result
interpretation followed the instructions of the Package Insert for the FDA-cleared Influenza B
Lineage Genotyping Kit.
The performance of the newly designed VIC (VER 2) and YAM (VER 2) assays against the
comparator (i.e., FDA-cleared Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Kit) is summarized in Table 19
and Table 20 below.

Retrospective Study – VER 1.1 VIC and YAM Assays
A retrospective study was performed using the VIC (VER 1.1) and the YAM (VER 1.1) assays to
assess performance of the modified VIC and YAM assays. Upper respiratory tract clinical
samples were collected during the 2016-2017 and 2017- 2018 influenza seasons and determined
to be positive or negative for influenza B/Victoria or B/Yamagata viruses using the FDA-cleared
Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Kit. The specimens were tested using the FDA-cleared InfB
assay and the modifed VIC (VER 1.1) and YAM (VER 1.1) assays in this study. A total of 126
upper respiratory tract clinical specimens positive for either influenza B/Victoria or influenza
B/Yamagata viruses and 61 specimens negative for influenza B viruses were tested. Result
interpretation followed the instructions of the Package Insert for the FDA-cleared Influenza B
Lineage Genotyping Kit.
The performance of the modified VIC (VER 1.1) and YAM (VER 1.1) assays against the
