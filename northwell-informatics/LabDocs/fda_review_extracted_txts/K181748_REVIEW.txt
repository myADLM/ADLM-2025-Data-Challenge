L. Test Principle:
Magnesium present in the sample is a cofactor in an enzymatic reaction with isocitrate
dehydrogenase. The rate of increase in absorbance at 340 nm, due to the formation of
NADPH, is directly proportional to the magnesium concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Analytical performance for serum and plasma was cleared under k173294. Analytical
performance for urine is presented below.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated according to the CLSI EP05-A2 guideline. Precision testing
included 2 commercially available urine-based controls (Control 1 and 2) and 3
contrived urine pools (A, B, and C). Each sample was tested in 2 replicates per run, 2
runs per day for 20 days for a total of 80 replicates per sample. The results from the
precision study are summarized in the table that follows:
Within Run Total
Sample n Mean (mg/dL)
SD %CV SD %CV
Control 1 80 4.54 0.055 1.2 0.058 1.3%
Control 2 80 11.17 0.114 1.0 0.149 1.3%
Urine Pool A 80 1.89 0.036 1.9 0.045 2.4%
Urine Pool B 80 5.7 0.096 1.7 0.102 1.8%
Urine Pool C 80 22.51 0.394 1.7 0.394 1.8%
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated according to CLSI EP06-A guideline. The linearity of the
Magnesium assay was evaluated by preparing a series of 12 sample pools with
analyte concentrations of 0.98, 1.47, 1.97, 3.09, 5.12, 9.27, 13.60, 18.04, 22.51,
27.02, 31.95 and 36.34 mg/dL. Samples were tested in four replicates with 2 reagent
lots on 1 ARCHITECT c8000 System. The linear regression results of a
representative sample set are as follows:
y = 1.03 x - 0.20, r = 1.00
The results of the linearity study supports the claimed analytical measuring interval of
1.81 to 26.35 mg/dL.

Automatic dilution:
The sponsor evaluated the automatic dilution (auto-dilution) protocol using a 1:3
dilution factor. Two urine pools were prepared to magnesium concentrations above
26.35 mg/dL and evaluated in replicates of 12 using the on board auto-dilution on the
ARCHITECT c8000 System. Results obtained using auto-dilution were found to be
less than 10% difference from the expected values. The results of this study support
the sponsor’s labeling claims that, using the Automated Dilution Protocol, samples
with magnesium concentrations above 26.35 mg/dL may be auto-diluted 1:3 on board
the analyzer.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The assigned values for Magnesium are traceable to NIST SRM 956 reference
material.
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit studies were carried out in accordance with the CLSI EP17-A2
guideline.
The limit of blank (LoB) was determined by running 4 blank samples in 10 replicates
per run and 2 runs per day for 3 days using 2 reagent lots on one ARCHITECT c8000
System. The 95th percentile of the zero-analyte sample concentration was calculated
and considered to the estimated LoB.
The limit of detection (LoD) was determined by running ten low level samples in 10
replicates per run and 2 runs per day for 3 days using 2 reagent lots on one
ARCHITECT c8000 System. LoD was calculated based on the following equation:
LoD = LoB + Cp x SD , where Cp is multiplier to give the 95th percentile of a normal
L
distribution and SD is the pooled SD ).
L
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was determined by running ten low level samples in
10 replicates per run and 2 runs per day for 3 days using 2 reagent lots on one
ARCHITECT c8000 System. LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration that
yielded an estimated total error less than or equal to the total allowable error of
22.0%.
The results for the urine application of the assay (new claim) are summarized in the
table below:
mg/dL
LoB 0.04
LoD 0.09
LoQ 0.75

LoD	0.09
LoQ	0.75

The detection limit study supports the claimed measuring range of 1.81 mg/dL to
26.35 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was performed based on the CLSI EP07-A2 guideline.
Interference effects were assessed by dose response and paired difference methods.
For each potentially interfering substance, 2 base pools were prepared using human
urine and magnesium chloride at magnesium levels of approximately 5 mg/dL and 14
mg/dL. Bias is defined as the difference in the results between the control sample
(without interference) and the test sample (contains interferent) expressed in percent.
Difference exceeding 10% is considered significant interference by the sponsor.
The highest concentration of substance tested that did not cause significant
interference for magnesium samples is summarized in the table below.
Highest concentration tested that did not show
Substance
significant interference
Albumin 64 mg/dL
Ascorbic acid 200 mg/dL
Bilirubin (conjugated) 59.5 mg/dL
Calcium 26 mg/dL
Glucose 1220 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 1200 mg/dL
Phosphorus 307 mg/dL
Boric Acid 1000 mg/dL
Hydrochloric Acid 3.0 mL/dL
Copper 21.6 µg/dL
Zinc 3504 µg/dL

The following statements have been included in the Limitations of the Procedure
section of the package insert:
• The Magnesium assay is susceptible to interference from hemoglobin.
• Do not use acetic acid, nitric acid, and sodium fluoride as urine preservatives.
• Do not use more than 2.5 mL 6N HCl per 100 mL of urine. Excess hydrochloric
acid may cause elevated results with this methodology.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was conducted by testing a total of 118 patient urine
samples (106 native and 12 spiked urine samples) with magnesium concentrations
from 1.82-23.25 mg/dL, as determined on the predicate device. Three aliquots from
each sample were prepared to characterize bias under different testing conditions: (a)
without acidification to represent random urine samples with no preservative added,
(b) with acidification to pH < 2 (pH 1.8 – 1.9) using 6N HCl to represent samples
with added preservative, or (c) with acidification to pH ~1 (pH 0.9 – 1.1) using 6N
HCl, as per predicate device instructions. Results obtained for each aliquot (a), (b),
and (c) on the candidate device were compared to results obtained for aliquot (c)
using the predicate device (Roche Magnesium Gen.2).
The results of the regression analyses are summarized in the tables below:
No acidification
