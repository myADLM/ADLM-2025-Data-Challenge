L. Test Principle:
According to the instructions for use, whole blood capillary samples are collected from the
puncture of the fingertip using high-flow lancets (not included with the HemoCue Hb 801
System), and filled directly into the microcuvette which is inserted into the HemoCue Hb
Analyzer. The analyzer measures the whole blood at an Hb/HbO2 isosbestic point (506 nm)
and at a wavelength (880 nm) to compensate for possible interfering background (e.g.
turbidity). The measurement is performed directly on the whole blood through measurement
of the transmitted and scattered light using an algorithm for translation into the hemoglobin
concentration of the sample. The HemoCue Hb 801 System is traceable to the HiCN method,
the international reference method according to International Council for Standardization in
Hematology (ICSH) for the determination of the hemoglobin concentration in blood. The
system is factory calibrated and needs no further calibration by the operator.

HemoCue Hb 801 Microcuvette shelf-life was determined by using three lots of
microcuvettes with one lot kept open to study in-use stability over nine months (Time
0, 7 weeks, 3 months ± 2 weeks, 6 months ± 2 weeks, and 9 months). Measurements
taken at these time points were compared with the hemiglobincyanide (HiCN)
method. HiCN method is the ICSH reference method and was manually performed
per ICSH recommendations. The absorbance was detected by a spectrometer. The
data support a shelf-life stability claim of 6 months.
Microcuvette Transportation
HemoCue Hb 801 Microcuvette stability during transportation was determined by
using one lot of microcuvette over six months (Time 0, 2 weeks, 3 months ± 2 weeks,
and 6 months ± 2 weeks). To mimic the transportation conditions, microcuvettes were
cycled between two temperatures (-20±2°C and 52±2°C) and afterwards stored at one
of the following storage temperatures, 5±3°C or 42±2°C. Measurements taken at
these timepoints were compared with the HiCN method. The data support a
transportation stability claim of 6 months.
d. Detection limit:
LoB
To determine Limit of Blank (LoB), plasma samples were obtained from four venous
K EDTA whole blood samples. The study was conducted with three analyzers, two
2
microcuvette lots, and over four operating days. Each sample was analyzed in three
runs per day and two replicates per run, providing a total of 144 replicates. LoB was
calculated by rank ordering the 72 samples per microcuvette lot from low to high and
averaging the 68th and 69th results (being the 95th percentile). LoB was determined
to be 0.26 g/dL.
LoD
To determine Limit of Detection (LoD), four venous K EDTA whole blood samples
2
were collected covering a Hb concentration range of 0.46–1.0 g/dL. The study was
conducted with three analyzers, two microcuvette lots, and over four operating days.
Each sample was analyzed three runs per day and two replicates per run, providing 72
replicates per microcuvette lot. LoD was calculated by nonparametric analysis and
was determined to be 0.3 g/dL.
LoQ
To determine Limit of Quantitation (LoQ), four venous K EDTA blood samples were
2
collected covering Hb concentration 0.37–0.52 g/dL. The study was conducted with
three analyzers, two microcuvette lots, and over four operating days. Each sample
was analyzed three runs per day and three replicates per run, providing 108 replicates
8

--- Page 9 ---
per microcuvette lot. LoQ was determined from the specified total error to be 0.5
g/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Venous K EDTA whole blood samples were adjusted to two Hb levels (10.0±0.5
2
g/dL and 20.0±1.0 g/dL). The samples were divided into two groups: a test group and
a reference group that serves as the control. The test group was spiked with the
interfering substance in NaCl solution as the diluent solution; the reference group was
added with a corresponding volume of diluent solution. Each condition (one
hemoglobin level with one interfering substance or control) was analyzed with three
blood samples, three analyzers, and five replicates per analyzer, providing a total of
45 replicates. A high concentration per CLSI EP07-A2 recommendation of each
substance was tested. The results from the test groups were compared with the
reference group and if the difference was within ±10%, no interference was
determined to be the outcome. For substances identified as interferents at the high
concentration tested, a concentration-response curve evaluating multiple
concentrations of the interfering substance was generated to determine the non-
interfering concentration.
To evaluate the impact on hemoglobin measurements by disease conditions, venous
K EDTA blood specimens from 5–42 donors of each the following conditions were
2
collected and tested: high white blood cell (WBC) count, sickle cell, polycythemia
vera, thalassemia/hypochromia, microcytic hypochromic anemia, normocytic
normochromic anemia, macrocytic anemia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia
(spherocytosis), dual RBC populations (post-transfusion samples), NRBC,
polychromasia, hemoglobin C disease, blood borne parasite (malaria), rouleaux, and
agglutination. The Hb concentration from HemoCue Hb 801 System was compared to
the HiCN method. Each sample was tested in three or five replicates on HemoCue Hb
801 System and 2–3 replicates with HiCN method. The following conditions, within
the acceptance criteria demonstrated no interference effect on the HemoCue Hb 801
System: sickle cell, polycythemia vera, thalassemia/hypochromia, microcytic
hypochromic anemia, normocytic normochromic anemia, macrocytic anemia,
autoimmune hemolytic anemia (spherocytosis), dual RBC populations (post-
transfusion samples), NRBC, polychromasia, hemoglobin C disease, blood borne
parasite (malaria), rouleaux, and agglutination.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed across five point-of-care (POC) sites to
compare the HemoCue Hb 801 System to the predicate device, the HemoCue Hb 301
System. A total of 233 capillary samples and 264 venous K EDTA whole blood
2
specimens from a total of 285 subjects were tested at five U.S. sites of primary care
setting with both the Hemocue Hb 801 System and the predicate. All samples were
measured in duplicate and only the first replicate for each sample was used for the
data analysis.
A total of 135 male and 150 female subjects, ranging from 29 days to 95 years of age,
provided 233 capillary samples ranging from 4.7–23.2 g/dL and 264 venous K EDTA
2
samples ranging from 1.5–25.3 g/dL when tested on the HemoCue Hb 801 System.
Of the 497 samples, 28 (6%) contrived venous K EDTA samples were collected at
2
one site and tested to challenge the full measuring range of the HemoCue Hb 801
System. In addition, the samples tested for the method comparison study included

Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function for the HemoCue Hb 801 system.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The Hemocue 801 microcuvette draws a small amount (approximately 10μL) of venous
or capillary blood by capillary effect. The cuvette is then inserted into the meter. No
reagent is required.
5. Calibration:
The HemoCue Hb 801 Analyzer is factory calibrated and needs no further calibration.
6. Quality Control:
The HemoCue Hb 801 System is intended to be used with the HemoTrol WB control
materials, manufactured by EuroTrol, in three concentrations that correspond to three
levels of human hemoglobin (~ 95, 130, and 160 g/L). Each vial contains 1 mL of
HemoTrol WB solution that contains purified bovine hemolysate, stabilizer, and
preservatives. Users are directed to perform control testing when an external quality
control is required by local or other regulations. The EuroTrol HemoTrol WB is
concurrently cleared under K182744.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
a. Operating Environment
The operation of HemoCue Hb 801 was tested under the following three conditions: 8–
10°C and ≤ 30% relative humidity (RH); 24–26°C and ≥ 90% RH; 40–42°C and 75–80%
RH. Three contrived venous K EDTA samples at hemoglobin levels 5.0±0.5, 14.0±0.5,
2
and 20.0±1.0 g/dL were tested over three operating days. Acceptable results were
achieved under all conditions tested.

b. Cleaning and Disinfection Validation Study
A cleaning and disinfection validation study was conducted to validate virucidal efficacy
using the selected disinfectant with the recommended disinfection protocol. Super Sani-
Cloth Germicidal Disposable Wipes (EPA Registration No. 9480‐4), a ready to use pre-
saturated towelette, demonstrated complete inactivation of Duck Hepatitis B virus
(surrogate for Human Hepatitis B virus) for all tested materials, following 2-minute wet-
contact time. Results of the study also demonstrate no significant change in appearance
and function of the HemoCue Hb 801 System after 3000 disinfection and cleaning cycles.
c. Accuracy
An accuracy study was performed by testing 102 venous K EDTA whole blood samples
2
(45% contrived) and 100 capillary blood samples on the HemoCue Hb 801 System and
using HiCN method. Samples were tested on one analyzer Hemocue Hb 801 System,
three lots of microcuvette, over ten days. The regression analysis of venous or capillary
samples suggested an agreement between HemoCue Hb 801 System and HiCN method
(ICSH reference method).
Blood Type Sample Number Slope Intercept r
Venous 102 0.99 0.087 1.00
Capillary 100 0.96 0.92 0.92
d. Sample Stability
Sample stability was assessed using five venous K EDTA whole blood samples at either
2
room temperature (23±2˚C) or refrigerated temperature (5±3˚C). All samples were
analyzed with one lot ofmicrocuvette, three analyzers, and four replicates over 25 hours
(0, 4, 8, 20, and 25 hours). The study data supportedthe recommended stability claim of
24 hours when stored at room temperature (23±2˚C) or refrigerated temperature (5±3˚C).
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
