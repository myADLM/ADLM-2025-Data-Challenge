I. Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each
VITEK 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium
is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials
combined with the nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized
concentration with 0.45% to 0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial
medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System will automatically dilute the bacterial
suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then the VITEK 2 will fill, seal
and place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling,
sealing and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the
card over a defined period of time (up to 24 hours for Streptococcus species). The analysis
program determines when a well demonstrates growth based on attenuation of light measured
by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration
or “MIC” values for the anti-microbial agent. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a
report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for
each antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK2 AST-Gram Positive Inducible Clindamycin Resistance has the following
concentrations in the card: Clindamycin 1.5 µg/mL, Clindamycin/Erythromycin at 0.5/2.5
µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL). Results of the
VITEK2 AST-Gram Positive Inducible Clindamycin Resistance are reported as Positive
(inducible resistance to clindamycin) or Negative (no inducible resistance to clindamycin).

L. Test Principle:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection
using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems uses
visible light to directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells.
Transmittance optics is based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth
has begun. Every 15 minutes throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based
on the VITEK 2 card), light transmittance readings of each well measures organism growth
by the amount of light that is prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of
the incubation period, the MIC values and their associated interpretive category results for
each antimicrobial on the test card are displayed in an automatically generated report.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study for the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive Inducible Clindamycin
Resistance card with Clindamycin and Clindamycin/Erythromycin was conducted at
three external clinical sites using ten isolates of Staphylococcus spp. consistent with
the Intended Use. The isolates tested in the reproducibility study included six
Staphylococcus aureus, two Staphylococcus epidermidis, and one each for
Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. The reproducibility
set included three S. aureus positive for ICR, three S. aureus negative for ICR, and
four coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. negative for ICR. Inocula were prepared
using both the auto-dilution and manual dilution methods for testing in the VITEK 2
System. Inocula were prepared by the manual dilution method only for use with the
VITEK 2 Compact. Testing of ech isolate was performed on three separate days and
in triplicate for a total of 270 data points. As a qualitative test, results were evaluated
by comparing the VITEK 2 or VITEK 2 Compact results to the expected result for
each isolate.
The reproducibility was 100% for VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact for each dilution
method.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Inoculum Density Control
The DensiCHEK Plus was used to standardize the inoculum to a 0.5 McFarland
standard. The instrument was standardized daily with all results recorded at each site.
Calibration values were within the expected range.

--- Page 6 ---
Purity Check
A purity check of all organisms was performed on the dilution tube used to prepare
the VITEK 2 card inoculum. Only those cultures that were pure were evaluated in the
study.
Growth Failure Rate
A total of 404 isolates were tested in the clinical study and 75 challenge isolates
tested at one external site. All isolates grew.
Quality Control (QC) Testing
The CLSI recommended QC organisms (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC BAA-976 as
negative control and S. aureus ATCC BAA-977 as positive control for ICR) were
tested using both the VITEK 2 card and the reference method at each site. Both the
automatic dilution and manual dilution methods were used for the VITEK 2 and
themanual dilution method was used for the VITEK 2 Compact.
As shown in Table 2 both the auto-dilution and the manual dilution methods for
VITEK 2 and the manual dilution for VITEK 2 Compact gave the expected QC result
(positive/negative) >95% of the time.

2. Comparison studies:
The VITEK 2 AST- Gram Positive ICR was compared to the CLSI D-zone reference
method using standard disk diffusion procedure. The conditions were:
· Medium: Mueller Hinton agar with Clindamycin (CM) 2 µg disk and
Erythromycin (E) 15 µg disk
· Inoculum: Direct colony suspension
· Incubation: 35ºC in ambient air for 16‒18 hours
A 15-µg erythromycin disk was positioned 15 mm (edge to edge) from a 2-µg
clindamycin disk. After incubation, flattening of the clindamycin zone adjacent to the
erythromycin disk (D-zone) indicates inducible clindamycin resistance.
The VITEK 2 ICR test consists of two wells, Clindamycin at concentration of 1.5µg/mL
and Clindamycin/Erythromycin at concentration of 0.5/2.5 µg/mL. The VITEK 2 ICR
interpretation is shown in Table 3 below. The VITEK 2 ICR results were compared to the
reference D-zone results tested at the testing sites and the comparative result is shown in
Table 4 below.

CA is when interpretation of the VITEK 2 results agrees exactly with the interpretation of the reference D
test
Staphylococcus aureus: One vmj (i.e., false negative) error was observed with S. aureus.
The vmj error rate was 2.7%. It was determined to be constitutively resistant to
clindamycin upon further analysis. This strain is ICR-negative in accordance with the
interpretation noted in Table 3 above.
As a result, the footnote below is included for S. aureus:
“One very major error (vmj) was observed for Staphylococcus aureus during the
VITEK 2 AST-GP Inducible Clindamycin Resistance clinical performance
evaluation. Further testing confirms this isolate was constitutively resistant to
clindamycin, and therefore the isolate is ICR-negative.”
Coagualse Negative Staphylococcus spp. (CNS):
Because of the broad claim for CNS, multiple species were tested and all species were
combined for analysis but also was evaluated for each by species. It was noted that the
CNS group performance did not meet the acceptance criteria with a maj error rate of 6.8%
(9/132). An additional study of 100 CNS was conducted. This study included 67 S.
saprophyticus and 33 S. warneri. With the combined data obtained by testing 253 CNS
isolates, the CNS maj error rate was 4.0% as demonstrated in Table 5 below.
