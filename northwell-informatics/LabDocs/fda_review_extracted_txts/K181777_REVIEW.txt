L. Test Principle:
The AggreGuide A-100 instrument uses a laser diode and photodetector to measure light
scatter. A whole blood sample is added to the reaction chamber of the AggreGuide A-100
ADP Assay cartridge. The reaction chamber contains a preloaded freeze-dried agonist, ADP,
as well as a magnetically activated rotor that mixes the agonist with the whole blood sample.
ADP activates platelets by binding to the ADP receptors on the platelet surface resulting in
platelet aggregation. P2Y12 inhibitors inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation by blocking
the P2Y12 ADP receptor on the platelet surface. The laser in the AggreGuide A-100
instrument emits light into the sample and platelet aggregates are detected by the observation
of light scatter. The amount of platelet aggregation is proportional to the amount of platelet
aggregates detected in the sample. Test results are reported as a Platelet Activity Index (PAI),
where higher values are associated with more platelet activity/aggregation and lower values
are associated with less platelet activity/aggregation.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The repeatability study was conducted using one instrument, with three donor
samples across the reportable range including a high level sample (> 6.5 PAI), a
sample near the cut-off (3.7–5.7 PAI) and a low level sample (< 3.7 PAI). For each
donor, five to ten whole blood sample tubes were collected and three replicates were
performed per tube on three different days, for a total of minimum of 60
measurements per donor. The SD results for the levels below 4.7 PAI and the %CV
results for the levels above 4.7 PAI were found to be acceptable.

per tube, for multiple days with a minimum of 3 days to 20 days. Four runs were
performed with five replicates per run on each instrument per tube. To demonstrate
precision performance for each sample/donor, the %CV and SD for each component of
variability were calculated; including, within-run, between-run, between-lot and between-
instrument. Due to biological variation of platelet function, between-donor and between-
day variability was not calculated.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity is not applicable.
Assay Reportable Range:
The numerical values of PAI are reported between the values of 2.1 and 12.0. When
levels of aggregation are less than 2.1, the PAI is reported as “LOW” accompanied by
a message “No Detectable Aggregation.” When levels of aggregation are greater than
12.0, the PAI is reported as “HIGH”, accompanied by a message “Aggregation is
High, reliability of a PAI greater than 12 has not been established.”
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability is not applicable.
Shelf Life Stability:
In accordance with CLSI EP25-A, the shelf-life stability study was conducted for the
AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay cartridges using an isochronous study design with
four different time points including baseline. Six donors representing high (normal),
medium (normal) and low (dysfunctional due to P2Y12 inhibitor) were used to test
shelf-life stability. Donor samples were tested on three different lots of aged
cartridges (previously manufactured production lots) compared to one freshly
manufactured lot that was less than one week old. Each donor was tested with each
cartridge lot in five replicates per time point using a single instrument. Shelf-life
stability was assessed in terms of measurand drift for each donor and lot. The data
provided were found to be acceptable to support the 18-month shelf-life stability
claim at room temperature.
Transportation Stability:
The transportation (shipping) stability study was conducted with one cartridge lot,

one instrument and a single donor sample. The donor sample was collected in sodium
citrate anticoagulant and tested under stressed (-20°C and 55°C) and unstressed (room
temperature) conditions, for five runs and two replicates per run. To simulate a
stressed condition, the assay cartridge was placed in a temperature control test
compartment under different temperature cycles. The compartment temperature was
lowered to -20°C and raised to 55°C. At each temperature, the cartridges were
maintained for 60 minutes. The transition time from -20°C to 55°C was 15 minutes.
The transition time from 55°C to -20°C was 25 minutes. The data provided for the
transportation stability study was assessed with a linear regression analysis and was
found to be acceptable.
Shipping temperature is monitored by an indicator attached to the box label which
will change color if the temperature of the box exceeds 54°C.
Sample Stability:
Sample stability was determined using whole blood samples collected from donors.
The samples were stored at room temperature (20–25°C) and subsequently analyzed
using one assay cartridge lot on one instrument at a minimum of eight different time
points (ranging from 2 minutes to more than 6 hours from collection). The data
supported a sample stability claim at room temperature for 30 minutes to 4 hours
post-collection.
Open-pouch Stability:
The AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay cartridges are packaged in Mylar pouches. An
open-pouch stability study was conducted to demonstrate stability of the cartridges
after removal from the Mylar pouch. The study was conducted by testing three
normal donor samples at four different time points (ranging from 1 minute to 60
minutes). Each time point consisted of one test and one control observation on the
same instrument which was operated by the same user. For each time point, test
results were compared to the respective baseline results. The data demonstrate that
the AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay cartridges should be used within 12 minutes of
opening the Mylar pouch.
Expected Values for Controls:
The labeling for the AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay requires the quality control
cartridge (QC2) test to be performed on the AggreGuide A-100 instrument every 30
days, or every 200 assays, whichever occurs first. The QC2 cartridge serves as a
method of detecting gross failure of the AggreGuide A-100 instrument. The
AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay cannot be performed on the AggreGuide A-100
instrument unless a QC2 test has been successfully performed within the defined
interval (30 days or 200 assays).
There are no manufactured external controls for AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay. The
7

--- Page 8 ---
manufacturer recommends that laboratories establish their own donor reagent controls
and may consider the following when establishing control donor groups:
• Normal PAI: In accordance with the specimen collection and handling
instructions provided in the labeling, collect whole blood from healthy adult
donors. The donor must not have taken any medication that is known to affect
platelet function for at least seven days and should have prior platelet
aggregation tests with results within the normal range established by the
laboratory. The manufacturer recommends using donors whose PAI value is >
4.7.
• Abnormal PAI: In accordance with the specimen collection and handling
instructions provided in the labeling, collect whole blood from a donor under
chronic aspirin treatment. The manufacturer recommends using donors whose
PAI value is < 4.7.
The manufacturer recommends performing quality control (normal and abnormal) for
each new lot of AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay cartridges. Quality control may be
performed more frequently in accordance with laboratory procedures.
Expected Values for Calibrators:
The AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay is factory calibrated, as such, calibration is not
performed by the user of the device.
d. Detection limit:
In accordance with CLSI EP17-A2, the Limit of Blank (LoB) study was conducted by
testing five K EDTA whole blood samples over 30 days, 30 runs per day, 2 replicates
2
per run. Twenty-eight cartridge lots were run on one AggreGuide A-100 instrument.
The LoB was determined to be 0.8 PAI.
e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity for the AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay was determined by
spiking normal whole blood samples collected in sodium citrate anticoagulant with
various concentrations of interferents. The following endogenous and exogenous
interfering substances were evaluated and showed no significant interference up to
the specified concentration in whole blood samples collected in 3.2% sodium citrate
anticoagulant tubes.

3. Clinical studies:
A clinical study was conducted at seven intended use sites in the U.S. using three
instruments and six assay cartridge lots. For each study subject, whole blood was
collected and tested at baseline and at each time point of the on-therapy state. Note: each
study subject adhered to an aspirin regimen which included aspirin ingestion prior to the
collection of the baseline sample and a daily 81 mg dose post-baseline.
In addition to the baseline measurement, samples were collected from subjects on
ticagrelor therapy at the following time points to represent the respective phase of the on-
therapy state: 3–6 hours (post-loading, “full-effect”), 24 hours to represent the “not full-
effect” and 7 days (post-maintenance, “full-effect”). In addition to the baseline
measurement, samples were collected from subjects on prasugrel at the following time
points to represent the respective phase of the on-therapy state: 24 hours and 7 days
(post-maintenance) which represent the “full-effect” states. All study samples were tested
with the AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay and the VerifyNow PRUTest.
Note: Although the clinical study included three study arms in which patients receiving
ticagrelor, prasugrel, or clopidogrel were evaluated, the AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay
is intended to detect platelet dysfunction in patients receiving ticagrelor and patients
receiving prasugrel. The data provided in the tables below represent the performance of

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The reference range for the AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay was established in a study
involving 129 healthy adult subjects (22–75 years of age) who were not receiving anti-
platelet medication. The study cohort consisted of a diverse population of males and
females with different ethnic backgrounds representative of the U.S. population. The
reference range was determined by the one-sided lower bound of the 95% confidence
interval. The lower limit is 4.54 PAI.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
