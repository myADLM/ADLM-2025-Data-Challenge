*Phadia 2500/5000 – Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000 are identical instruments except for
sample throughput. The difference is that Phadia 2500 consists of one process module
(two process lines) and Phadia 5000 consists of 2 process modules (2x2 process lines).
For that reason Phadia uses the Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000 instrument names
interchangeably.

L. Test Principle:
The EliA wells are molded cups comparable to excised wells from a microtiter plate. They
are made of polystyrene and are coated with the respective antigen.
The EliA wells are coated with human recombinant tissue transglutaminase for Celikey IgG,
or with synthetic deamidated gliadin peptides for GliadinDP IgA and GliadinDP IgG. If present
in the patient's specimen, antibodies to these proteins bind to the specific antigen. After
washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgA or IgG
antibodies (EliA IgA Conjugate or EliA IgG Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-
conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the bound
complex is incubated with a Development Solution. After stopping the reaction, the
fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The higher the response value, the more
specific IgA or IgG is present in the specimen. To evaluate test results, the response for
patient samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
All results presented below met the manufacturer’s predetermined acceptance criteria.
a. Precision:
The imprecision of the assay was assessed in a study with a total of 21 runs (3
instruments × 7 runs, 28 replicates/instrument/per sample) using serum native patient
samples.
The studies were performed with 1 run/day over a period of 7 days. Each sample was
tested in four replicates/run giving in total 84 replicates per sample. The data was
calculated against the calibration curve from Day 1. The results are summarized in the
table below:

Four patient serum samples were tested with one batch of EliA Celikey IgG, EliA
GliadinDP IgA and EliA GliadinDP IgG Immunoassays and one set of system reagents
on Phadia 2500/5000. The samples were serially diluted using the EliA Sample
Diluent and tested in triplicates. The ratio of observed/expected (O/E) values were
calculated. Observed values were graphed against the calculated values and a linear
regression was performed. The results of the regression analysis are summarized

The following statements are included in the package inserts: “Please note that
concentration values between LoD and LoQ may show a higher uncertainty.”
“Please note that due to differing binding characteristics of the antibodies in patient
samples, not all sera can be diluted linearly within the measuring range.”
High dose hook effect: The hook effect was previously reviewed in the predicate

The EliA IgA stability and calibration method was previously reviewed in K062787.
Controls:
Controls are sold separately from the assay. Calibrators are traceable to the
International Reference Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of Human Serum Immunoglobulins
A,G and M from World Health Organization (WHO).
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation studies
were performed on the Phadia 2500/5000 instrument. One blank sample was run in 33
replicates in two runs for a total of 66 observations. The LoD was measured by
assaying three low level samples (11 replicates for each sample in each run) using
two assay runs, for a total of 66 observations. Three additional low level samples
were used for the LoD determination of the EliA Celikiey IgG for a total of 132
determinations.
The LoB and LoD were calculated according to CLSI guideline EP17-A2. To
estimate the LoQ, a target level for the CV% of 20% has been defined. The mean
value of the sample with the CV% closest to and below the precision target of 20%
CV is selected as LoQ.
The results are summarized in the table below:
Phadia 2500/5000 Units LoB LoD LoQ
EliA Celikey IgG EliA U/mL 0.0 0.6 1.7
EliA GliadinDP IgA EliA U/mL 0.0 0.2 0.4
EliA GliadinDP IgG EliA U/mL 0.3 0.6 1.4
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference: Previously reviewed in K062583 for CelikeyR IgG and in K093459 for
GliadinDP IgA and IgG.
Carry-over: Phadia 2500/5000 instruments use disposable tips for pipetting samples
and a separate pipette for the conjugate, therefore carry-over from samples to
conjugate was not evaluated.
f. Assay cut-off:
The three assays’ cut-offs are the same as in the predicate devices, K062583
CelikeyR IgG and in K093459 for GliadinDP IgA and IgG and are summarized in the
table below:
EliA Celikey IgG, EliA GliadinDP IgA , EliA GliadinDP IgG

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Instrument comparison was performed with the predicate device, see 2c below.
b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison between serum and plasma was previously reviewed in K062583
for Celikey IgG and in K093459 for GliadinDP IgA and IgG.
c. Instrument comparison
The purpose of this study is to evaluate conformance and show comparability of the
EliA assays on the instruments Phadia 250 (PH250) versus Phadia 2500/5000
(PH2500/5000). The samples were run in single replicates on one PH250 instrument
and three PH2500/5000 (A, B, C) instruments for a total of four measurments per
sample. Only samples inside the measuring range were included in the calculations.
Results were analyzed by Passing-Bablock regression.

samples. The results are summarised below:
