L. Test Principle:
The PixoTest A1c Test kit uses an anti-HbA1c antibody which is specific for the first few
amino acid residues of the glycated N-terminus of the ß-chain of hemoglobin A0. When
whole blood is added to the buffer solution tube and mixed with the spoit, the erythrocytes
are instantly lysed to release the glycated hemoglobin (hereafter, HbA1c). When sample
mixture is loaded onto the sample port of the test panel, the mixture fluid migrates along the
membrane of the test panel by capillary action, and the HbA1c is then immobilized onto the
anti-HbA1c antibody coated line. The amount of the blue conjugates on the anti-HbA1c line
reflects the amount of HbA1c in the sample. The intensity of hemoglobin color from the

day using 3 test kit lots and 3 analyzers. Within-run, between run, between day,
between site, and between operator variability were assessed. The total precision CVs
were < 2.9% at 5.3% HbA1c, < 3.3% at 6.2% HbA1c, < 3.7% at 6.8% HbA1c, < 3.1%
at 7.8% HbA1c, and < 2.6% at 12.0% HbA1c.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A total of 13 K2-EDTA venous whole blood samples with HbA1c concentrations
covering the assay measuring range (at approximately 3.9, 4.8, 5.8, 6.5, 7.7, 8.2, 9.7,
10.7, 11.4, 12.3, 13.8, 14.8, 15.5%) were analyzed in ten replicates per sample on one
PixoTest POCT System using 3 lots of PixoTest POCT A1c Test Kits. The mean of
these replicates was compared to the expected values obtained from TOSOH G7
analyzer (k011434). A representative linear regression equation from one lot is shown
below:
y = 0.99x + 0.13, r = 0.99
The study supports the sponsor’s claimed linearity range of 4.0 - 15.0% HbA1c.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The PixoTest POCT System is traceable to the International Federation of Clinical
Chemistry (IFCC) reference material.
Test strip stability:
The PixoTest POCT Test Kit has a shelf-life of 18 months when stored at 34-86°F (1-
30°C) and 10-90% relative humidity. Shelf-life protocols and acceptance criteria were
previously reviewed in k140827 and found acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The claimed HbA1c measuring range of 4.0%-15.0% for the PixoTest POCT System
is based on linearity. See M.1.b. above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous and exogenous interference
Endogenous and exogenous substances were spiked at two levels into each of two
K2-EDTA venous whole blood samples (containing approximately 5.5% or 9.6%
HbA1c). Test samples measured on the PixoTest POCT System were compared to
K2-EDTA venous whole blood control samples (containing no potential interferent)
measured on the PixoTest POCT System. Test and control samples were tested in
replicates of five. The sponsor defined non-significant interference as < ± 6% change
in the HbA1c measurements from the control value. The following substances
demonstrated no significant interference at the concentrations described below:

Hemoglobin derivative interference
Interference from hemoglobin derivatives (acetylated hemoglobin, carbamylated
hemoglobin, labile A1c) was assessed in two K2-EDTA venous whole blood samples
(approximately 5.5% or 9.6% HbA1c). Acetylated hemoglobin was derived in the
presence of acetylsalicyclic acid, carbamylated hemoglobin was derived in the
presence of sodium cyanate, and labile A1c was derived in the presence of glucose.
Test samples measured on the PixoTest POCT System were compared to K2-EDTA
venous whole blood control samples (containing no potential interferent) measured on
the PixoTest POCT System. Test samples and control samples were tested in
replicates of five. The sponsor defined non-significant interference as < ± 6% change
in the HbA1c measurements from the control value. The following hemoglobin
derivatives demonstrated no significant interference at the concentrations described
below:

Hemoglobin variant interference:
A hemoglobin variant study was performed using K2-EDTA venous whole blood
samples (ranging from 5.0% to 9.7% HbA1c) containing known concentrations of
hemoglobin variants C, D, E, S, F, and A2. Samples measured by PixoTest POCT
System were compared to the assigned HbA1c concentration. The sponsor defined
non-significant interference as < ± 7% change in HbA1c from the reference value.
The data demonstrate no significant interference for the hemoglobin variants at the
following concentrations: Hemoglobin C (≤ 36%), Hemoglobin D (≤ 41%),
Hemoglobin E (≤ 28%), Hemoglobin S (≤ 40%), Hemoglobin F (≤ 19%) and
Hemoglobin A2 (≤ 6.5%).
The labeling contains the following information regarding hemoglobin variant
interference:
Hemoglobinopathies may interfere with glycated hemoglobin analysis. The results
from the PixoTest POCT System show that there is no significant interference for
samples containing Hemoglobin C (≤ 36%), Hemoglobin D (≤ 41%), Hemoglobin E
(≤ 28%), Hemoglobin S (≤ 40%), Hemoglobin F (≤ 19%) and Hemoglobin A2 (≤
6.5%).
Total hemoglobin
The effect of different levels of total hemoglobin was evaluated using three K2-
EDTA venous whole blood samples containing approximately 5.3%, 7.1%, or 12.2%
HbA1c. Samples measured by PixoTest POCT System were compared to the HbA1c
concentration assigned by TOSOH G7 method (k011434). The sponsor defined non-
significant interference as < ± 6% change in HbA1c from the reference value. The
data supports the claimed hemoglobin range of 7 to 23 g/dL.

b. Matrix comparaison :
Testing was performed to validate the use of venous whole blood samples with
different anticoagulants with the PixoTest POCT System. Fifty venous whole blood
samples (ranging from 5.0% to 13.0% HbA1c) were drawn into each of the intended
anticoagulant tube types. Values for sodium heparin, lithium heparin, and sodium
fluoride venous whole blood samples measured on PixoTest POCT System were
compared to values obtained for K2-EDTA venous whole blood samples measured on
PixoTest POCT System. Results of the linear regression analyses are shown below.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended a reasonable A1c goal for
many non-pregnant adults is < 7 % (53 mmol/mol). Providers might reasonably suggest
more stringent A1C goals (such as 6.5 % [48 mmol/mol]) for selected individual patients
if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of
treatment.
