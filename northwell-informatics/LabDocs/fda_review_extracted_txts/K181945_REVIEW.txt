This test provides only a preliminary test result. A more specific alternate testing method
must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Other confirmation
methods are available. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are
observed.

L. Test Principle:
TheQuickScreen™ Pro Multi Drug Screening Test, Model 9395Z device employs lateral
flow immunochromatographic technology, which involves the recognition and formation of a
specific antibody/target drug complex. Drug in the sample and drug-labeled conjugate
compete for antibody binding sites. During testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by
capillary action. If target drugs present in the urine specimen are below the cut-off
concentration, it will not saturate the binding sites of its specific monoclonal mouse antibody
coated on the particles. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized
drug-conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the test line region (T). The colored
line will not form in the test line region if the target drug level exceeds its cutoff-
concentration because it will saturate all the binding sites of the antibody coated on the
particles. The control line (C) serves as an internal quality control to ensure proper sample
volume has been added to the test and that the sample has correctly migrated up the test strip.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision/reproducibility study was performed using the QuickScreen™ Pro Multi
Drug Screening Test Model 9395Z device at three separate point of care (POC) sites.
Multiple replicates of each of the nine drug concentrations (prepared by spiking
negative urine samples with buprenorphine or TCA (Imipramine)) was assayed over a
minimum of 5 days. The tests were done in accordance with the package insert
instructions using one lot of the device, and a summary of the results are provided in
the table below. Precision performance for Amphetamines, Barbiturates,
Benzodiazepines, Cocaine, Ecstasy, Methadone, Methamphetamine, Opiates,
Oxycodone, Phencyclidine, and Marijuana, was reviewed in k070098.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There are no external controls supplied with the device.
Real time stability tests were conducted over 24 months. Protocol and acceptance
criteria were found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims that the devices are
stable for 22 months.
d. Detection limit:

pH sensitivity: Testing was conducted for BUP and Imipramine with the
QuickScreen™ Pro Multi Drug Screening Test Model 9395Z device to determine the
influence of sample pH on test results. Samples were tested in triplicate at a pH of
4.0, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5 and 9.0. No interference was observed for any pH test
conditions. pH interference performance for Amphetamines, Barbiturates,
Benzodiazepines, Cocaine, Ecstasy, Methadone, Methamphetamine, Opiates,
Oxycodone, Phencyclidine, and Marijuana, was reviewed in k070098.
Specific Gravity: Testing was conducted for BUP and Imipramine with the
QuickScreen™ Pro Multi Drug Screening Test Model 9395Z device to determine the
influence of sample specific gravity on test results. Four samples were tested,
spanning a range of specific gravity from 1.002 to 1.040. All were tested in
quadruplicate. No interference was observed for any specific gravity test conditions.
Specific gravity interference performance for Amphetamines, Barbiturates,
Benzodiazepines, Cocaine, Ecstasy, Methadone, Methamphetamine, Opiates,
Oxycodone, Phencyclidine, and Marijuana, was reviewed in k070098.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performaned analytically around the claimed
cutoff concentration appears in the precision section M.1.a., above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were conducted for BUP and Imipramine at four different

QuickScreen™ Pro Multi Drug Screening Test Model 9395Z device. All tests were
conducted using unaltered urine clinical samples. Accuracy performance for
Amphetamines, Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, Cocaine, Ecstasy, Methadone,
Methamphetamine, Opiates, Oxycodone, Phencyclidine, and Marijuana, was
reviewed in k070098.
