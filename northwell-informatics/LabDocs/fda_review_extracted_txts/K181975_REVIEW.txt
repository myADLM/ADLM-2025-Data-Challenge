marked on both sides with the code MEV30. The code designates the agent
(Meropenem/Vaborbactam) and the drug content.
Oxoid discs are supplied in cartridges containing 50 discs each; there are 5 cartridges per
pack. Each cartridge is individually sealed together with a desiccant capsule in a foil covered
see-through blister pack. Oxoid discs can be dispensed using an Oxoid Disk Dispenser.

L. Test Principle:
A suitable therapeutic agent can be determined using filter paper discs impregnated with
specified concentrations of antimicrobial agents placed on the surface of a suitable test
medium. The test is performed by inoculating pure cultures of clinical isolates onto the test
medium and placing the AST disc on the surface of the medium. The antibiotic within the
disc diffuses into the agar. After incubation, the zones of inhibition around the discs are
measured and compared against recognized zone diameter ranges for the specific
antimicrobial agent/organism combinations being tested.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was conducted at an external site using 15 indicated organisms, tested
with two disc lots on three separate days. Each test was visually read by 3
independent readers with results blinded, resulting in 270 data points for evaluation.
The reproducibility study included 12 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and one each
of Citrobacter freundii, E. coli, and Enterobacter cloacae. Reproducibility was
assessed by considering ± 3 mm difference in zone diameter comparing test results
with predetermined disk zone diameter test mode. All results were within 2 mm of the
mode result. Results are shown in Table 2 below.

The Oxoid disc QC performance is >95% (96.2%, 508/528) and was considered
acceptable. However, the Oxoid disc QC results tended to be on the high end of the
approved QC range and this trend was seen for all strains.
Colony counts were conducted for the four QC isolates and were within expected
range.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The Oxoid disk was compared with a FDA cleared disc (predicate) of the same
antimicrobial, mass/concentration, and content. The study was conducted at one
testing site. Three independent operators participated in reading of test results with
isolates evenly distributed to mimic testing at multiple sites. The study included 300
clinical isolates recovered during the drug development clinical trials. An additional
75 challenge isolates from the CDC and FDA AR Bank included Enterobacteriaceae
isolates harboring multiple resistance determinants.
The following species were evaluated as clinical isolates in the study: Citrobacter
freundii/C. freundii spp. complex (4), Klebsiella (Enterobacter) aerogenes (1),
Enterobacter cloacae/E. cloacae spp. complex (23), E. coli (111), K. oxytoca (1), K.
pneumoniae (149), Morganella morganii (4), Providencia stuartii (3), and Serratia
marcescens (3). Seventy-five isolates were included in the challenge study:
Citrobacter freundii (1), Enterobacter aerogenes (3), Enterobacter cloacae/E.
cloacae spp. complex (12), E. coli (9), K. oxytoca (2), K. pneumoniae (32), Kluyvera
ascorbate (1), Morganella morganii (1), P. mirabilis (3), and Serratia marcescens
(8). A total of 340 isolates from the drug indicated species (K. pneumoniae, E. coli
and E. cloacae spp. Complex) were tested. The performance of the Oxoid disc for
Enterobacteriaceae is shown in Table 4 below.

Enterobacter cloacae spp. complex (35).
CA - Category Agreement maj – major discrepancies
S - Susceptible isolates vmj- very major discrepancies
I - Intermediate isolates min- minor discrepancies
R – Resistant isolates
The performance of the Oxoid Meropenem/Vaborbactam disc as compared to the
predicate is acceptable (99.2%); there were three minor discrepancies and no major or
very major discrepancies. There was a total of 340 isolates from indicated species that
included K. pneumoniae (184 isolates), E. coli (121 isolates) and E. cloacae (35
isolates). To address the testing of non-indicated species the following footnote is
included in the device labeling:
The safety and efficacy of meropenem/vaborbactam in treating clinical infections
due to Gram-Negative organisms other than Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae species complex may or may not have
been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. The clinical
significance of such susceptibility information in those instances is unknown.
A total of 11 resistant strains were tested including 10 strains of K. pneumoniae and
one strain of E. coli. To address the lack of testing of resistant strains of species other
than K. pneumoniae, the following limitation was included in the device labelling:
The ability of the Oxoid Meropenem/Vaborbactam disc to detect resistance in
species other than K. pneumoniae is unknown because resistant strains were not
available at the time of comparative testing. If such a strain is observed, it should
be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.
Resistance Mechanisms in Challenge Isolates
The 75-isolate challenge set included Enterobacteriaceae isolates harboring extended
spectrum βeta-Lactamases (ESBLs) (CTX-M, SHV, TEM, AmpC including pAmpC
(ACT, CMY, DHA), and cAmpC) and carbapenemases (KPC, NDM, OXA, IMI,
VIM, and SME).
Isolates that exhibit overexpression of efflux pumps or lower expression of porins
were not available for evaluation. Information regarding these resistance mechanisms
is addressed in device labeling by the following footnote:

[Table 1 on page 7]
				Total			CA#			CA%			S (#)			I (#)			R (#)			Vmj			Maj			Min

The performance of Oxoid Meropenem/Vaborbactam disk (30 µg) MEV30 is
unknown for Enterobacteriaceae with the following resistance mechanisms:
overexpression of efflux pumps and/or lower expression of porins.
Secondary Analysis
A secondary analysis of the 375 isolates was also performed. The analysis was
conducted to compare qualitative categorical agreement of the Oxoid disc and the
predicate disk with the reference MIC values (based on historical data from testing
performed at the initial recovery of isolates during the drug clinical trials). The
analysis showed a CA of 98.1% and 98.4% for the Oxoid and the predicate discs,
respectively. There were two very major errors observed; however, because testing
was not performed concurrently with disk testing and no further investigation was
performed, the reason for these errors remains unknown. Given that these errors were
observed by both the test disk and predicate and no errors were observed in the
primary analysis (based on disk comparisons), these results did not raise additional
concerns.
