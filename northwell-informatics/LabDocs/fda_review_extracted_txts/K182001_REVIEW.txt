H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
1) The Acucy Influenza A&B Test for the rapid qualitative detection of influenza A and
B is composed of a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the direct and qualitative
detection of influenza A and B viral nucleoprotein antigens from nasal and
nasopharyngeal swabs of symptomatic patients that is automatically analyzed on the
Acucy Reader. The Acucy Influenza A&B Test is a differentiated test, such that
influenza A viral antigens can be distinguished from influenza B viral antigens from a
single processed sample using a single Test Cassette. The test is intended for use with
the Acucy System as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections.
The test is not intended for the detection of influenza C viruses. Negative test results
are presumptive and should be confirmed by viral culture or an FDA-cleared
influenza A and B molecular assay. Negative test results do not preclude influenza
viral infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient
management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2017-2018
influenza season when influenza A/H3N2 and A/H1N1pdm09 were the predominant
influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging,
performance characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for
novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for
testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility
is available to receive and culture specimens.

Overview
The Acucy Influenza A&B Test is a lateral flow immunochromatographic assay in the
sandwich immunoassay format. The Acucy Influenza A&B Test consists of a Test Cassette
that detects and differentiates influenza A and influenza B viral antigens from a patient
sample. The test sample, a nasal swab or nasopharyngeal swab, is processed to extract
nucleoproteins by mixing the swab in Acucy Influenza A&B Extraction Buffer. The mixture
is then added to the sample well of the Test Cassette. From there, the sample migrates along
the membrane surface. If influenza A or B viral antigens are present, they form a complex
with mouse monoclonal antibodies to influenza A and/or B nucleoproteins conjugated to
colloidal gold. The complex is then bound by a rat anti-influenza A and/or mouse anti-
influenza B antibody coated on the nitrocellulose membrane.
The Acucy Reader is an optoelectronic instrument that uses a reflectance-based measurement
method to evaluate the line signal intensities in the results window of the Test Cassette. The
Acucy Reader scans the Test Cassette and measures the absorbance intensity by processing
the results using method-specific algorithms. The Acucy Reader displays the test results POS
(+), NEG (-), or INVALID on the screen. The results can also be automatically printed on the
Acucy Printer if this option is selected.

Instrument System
Separately from the Acucy Influenza A&B Test Kit, the Acucy Reader is provided with the
following accessories: an Acucy Printer, power cords and adapters, paper roll, Acucy
Calibration Device (CAL-Device) with case, USB Memory Drive, and System Manual.
Materials Required but Not Provided
· Timer or watch
· If needed, sterile nasopharyngeal swabs (Copan Catalog # 534CS01)
· If needed, additional external quality controls may be purchased separately (Acucy
Influenza A&B Control Kit # 1011)
Quality Control
There are three types of Quality Control for the Acucy System and Acucy Influenza A&B
Test: Acucy Reader Calibration, Test Cassette Built-In Internal Control, and External Quality
Control.
Acucy Reader Calibration
The Acucy Reader calibration is a required function that checks the Acucy Reader optics and
calculation systems using a specific CAL-Device. The CAL-Device is supplied in a
calibration case with the Acucy System accessories. The Calibration Procedure is performed
upon installation to activate the QC TEST and RUN TEST functionality and is required
every 30 days. The operator is prompted by the Acucy Reader to conduct calibration with the
CAL-Device after the 30 days have elapsed. The Calibration Procedure may also be
performed, as directed during troubleshooting or whenever the Acucy Reader date and time
have been changed.
Test Cassette Built-In Internal Control
The Acucy Influenza A&B Test Cassette contains a built-in internal control feature. Each
time a test is run in the Acucy Reader, the internal control zone is scanned by the reader. A
“VALID” test result displayed by the reader indicates that the internal control was present,
demonstrates that the test flowed correctly, and that the functional integrity of the Test
Cassette and reagents was maintained. A “INVALID” test result displayed by the reader
indicates that the internal control was not present, demonstrates that the test did not flow
correctly, and/or that the functional integrity of the Test Cassette and reagents were not
maintained. Should this occur, the end user is instructed to review the testing procedure and
repeat the test using a new patient sample, Test Cassette, and reagents.
External Quality Control (QC)
4

--- Page 5 ---
The Acucy Influenza A&B Test includes one Influenza A+/B- Control Swab (Red Label) and
one Influenza A-/B+ Control Swab (Blue Label), each of which contains inactivated virus,
for external quality control testing. The Influenza A+/B- Control Swab acts as an external
positive control for influenza A antigen and an external negative control for influenza B
antigen, and conversely, Influenza A-/B+ Control Swab serves as an external positive control
for influenza B antigen and an external negative control for influenza A antigen.
The External Quality Controls are used to monitor that the assay-specific reagents, Test
Cassettes, and Acucy Reader are functioning properly, and to demonstrate proper
performance by the operator. External Quality Control requirements should be established in
accordance with local, state, and federal regulations or accreditations requirements.
Minimally, Sekisui Diagnostics recommends that External Quality Controls be run with each
new lot, each shipment received, and with each new untrained operator.
Acucy Reader Modes
The Acucy Reader has two modes of operation, the WALK AWAY/NORMAL and the
READ NOW modes. The reader may be set to either one of the two different modes.
WALK AWAY/NORMAL Mode
In the WALK AWAY/NORMAL mode, Test Cassettes are inserted into the reader. Then,
after the addition of the sample to the Test Cassette, the development and timing of the test
occur within the reader. This allows the user to “walk away” until the test has been
completed.
READ NOW Mode
In the READ NOW Mode, the reader analyzes the results after manually timing the
development of the Test Cassette on a flat surface for the full 15 minutes. This mode is
helpful if the user is running multiple samples in a batch format.
Running the tests in the wrong modes will produce invalid results. If a user runs a test in the
WALK AWAY/NORMAL mode, however, the reader is set incorrectly in the READ NOW
mode, the reader screen will display error message “INVALID2.” If a user runs a test in the
READ NOW mode, however, the reader is set incorrectly in the WALK AWAY/NORMAL
mode, the reader screen will display error message “INVALID1.”
Workflow
To perform the Acucy Influenza A&B Test, an operator first collects either a nasal swab
(NS) using a nylon sterile flocked nasal swab provided in the test kit or a nasopharyngeal
swab (NPS) using a nylon sterile flocked nasopharyngeal swab (Copan Catalog # 534CS01).
The operator removes the cap off an Extraction Buffer vial, and inserts the NS or NPS
sample into the Extraction Buffer vial while pressing down on the swab, vigorously mix
5

--- Page 6 ---
against the side of the vial 10 times while submerged. The operator then removes the swab
while squeezing the middle of the vial to remove the liquid from the swab, properly discard
the swab, adds dropper tip to the Extraction Buffer vial, presses tightly to seal the vial, and
labeled the vial with patient identification.
After the swab sample elution/extraction step, the procedure for testing depends on the reader
workflow configuration chosen by the operator.
WALK AWAY/NORMAL Mode
In the WALK AWAY/NORMAL mode, the operator first enters the patient identification
into the reader by scanning the patient’s ID barcode using the reader scanner or by manually
entering the patient ID using the keypad on the reader screen. The operator then opens the
Test Cassette foil pouch, labels the Test Cassette with the patient ID, opens the reader
drawer, and inserts the Test Cassette. The reader automatically scans the Test Cassette. While
the Test Cassette is in the reader drawer, the operator gently mixes the Extraction Buffer vial
to agitate sample, and then inverts the Extraction Buffer vial vertically above the Test
Cassette to gently squeeze 5 drops of extracted sample into the sample well of the Test
Cassette. The operator closes the drawer within 10 seconds to start the test. The Reader
automatically times the 15-minute development. After the 15 minutes, the reader
automatically displays the test results. The operator subsequently opens the reader drawer,
removes the Test Cassette, and disposes it in a proper biohazard container.
READ NOW Mode
In the READ NOW Mode, the operator first opens the Test Cassette foil pouch and labels the
Test Cassette with the patient ID. While the Test Cassette is on a flat surface, the operator
inverts the Extraction Buffer vial vertically above the Test Cassette and gently squeeze 5
drops of extracted sample into the sample well of the Test Cassette. The operator then starts
an external timer for 15 minutes. While the Test Cassette is developing, the operator enters
the patient identification into the reader by scanning the patient’s ID barcode using the reader
scanner or by manually entering the patient ID using the keypad on the reader screen. Once
the 15-minute is complete, the operator opens the reader drawer, and inserts the Test
Cassette. The reader automatically scans the Test Cassette. The operator then immediately
closes the drawer to start the test. The reader automatically displays the test results. The
operator subsequently opens the reader drawer, removes the Test Cassette, and disposes it in
a proper biohazard container.
Results Interpretation
The results are interpreted by the Acucy Reader software from measured absorbance
intensity by processing the results using method-specific algorithms. The Acucy Reader
displays the test results POS (+), NEG (-), for FLU A and B separately, or INVALID on the
screen There are five possible results: (1) FLU A POS (+)/FLU B NEG (-); (2) FLU A NEG
(-)/FLU B POS (+); (3) FLU A NEG (-)/FLU B NEG (-); (4) FLU A POS (+)/FLU B POS
(+); and (5) INVALID. The results can also be automatically printed on the Acucy Printer if
6

--- Page 7 ---
this option is selected.
Any INVALID result should be retested with a new patient sample, reagents, and Test
Cassette. A FLU A or FLU B positive result, or a FLU A and B dual positive result, does not
rule out co-infection with other pathogens or identify any specific Influenza A or B virus
subtypes. Co-infection with Influenza A and B is rare. It is recommended that a FLU A and
B dual positive sample (Influenza A and Influenza B positive) should be re-tested.
Repeatable Influenza A and B dual positive results should be confirmed by cell culture or
PCR testing before reporting results. A FLU A and B negative result does not exclude
influenza viral infection. Negative results should be confirmed by viral culture or an FDA-
cleared Influenza A and Influenza B molecular assay.

L. Test Principle:
The Acucy Influenza A&B Test is a lateral flow immunochromatographic assay in the
sandwich immunoassay format. In the sandwich immunoassay format, the antibody-
conjugate is mixed with the antigen of a sample to form a complex in the glass fiber pad
before the test line, which is then transported by diffusion along a flow path to the test site.
At the test site, the antigen bound with the conjugate reacts with the immobilized first
binding protein to form a “sandwich” of the first protein, antigen, second protein, and colored
particles. The sandwich complex is progressively produced at the test site as sample
continuously passes by, filling the reservoir. As more and more antigen-conjugate is
immobilized, the colored particles aggregate at the test site and become visible through the
window, indicating the presence of the antigen in the sample.
The Acucy Influenza A&B Test consists of a Test Cassette that detects and differentiates
influenza A and influenza B viral antigens from a patient sample. The test sample, a nasal
swab or nasopharyngeal swab, is processed to extract nucleoproteins by mixing the swab in
Acucy Influenza A&B Extraction Buffer. The mixture is then added to the sample well of the
Test Cassette, which then migrates along the membrane surface. If influenza A and/or B viral
antigens are present in the sample, they form a complex with mouse monoclonal antibodies
to influenza A and/or B nucleoproteins conjugated to colloidal gold. The complex is then
bound by a rat anti-influenza A and/or mouse anti-influenza B antibody coated on the
nitrocellulose membrane. The presence of colored line at the Flu A position of the results
window indicates the presence of influenza A, and a colored line at the Flu B position
indicates the presence of influenza B. The intensity of the lines is related to the amount of
antigen in the sample.
The Acucy Reader scans the test strip, measures the absorbance of the colored Flu A and Flu
B lines, and uses analyte-specific algorithms to determine whether the sample is positive for
influenza A and/or influenza B. Depending on the user’s choice, the Test Cassette may be
either placed inside the Acucy Reader for automatically timed test development (WALK
AWAY/NORMAL mode), or placed on the bench top for manually timed development and
then placed into the Acucy Reader to be scanned (READ NOW mode).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:

Four independent studies: within-laboratory repeatability, instrument-to-instrument

reproducibility, were carried out to evaluate the precision and reproducibility of the
Acucy Influenza A&B Test with the Acucy Reader.
A seven-member panel was used for all four studies. The panel was made with two
viral strains: Influenza A/Hong Kong/4801/14 (H3N2) and Influenza
B/Phuket/3073/13. Each strain was diluted into Viral Transport Medium (VTM) at
three different target levels: Moderate Positive (MP) (~2xLoD), Low Positive (LP)
(~1xLoD), and High Negative (HN) (0.1xLoD for Influenza A and 0.25xLoD for
Influenza B). Panel members were formulated with only one target present (Flu A or
Flu B). A Negative sample (VTM only) was also used. Simulated nasal swabs were
prepared by pipetting 50 µL of sample (virus dilution) onto the head of the swab.
Each swab was allowed to air dry and then sealed in a desiccated pouch prior to
testing.
Detection rates and percent agreement scores were calculated for each study. Percent
agreement was calculated as the number of expected results divided by the total
number of replicates tested. For Moderate and Low Positive samples, detection of
target is the expected result. For High Negative and Negative samples, the absence of
target detection is the expected result.
Within-Laboratory Repeatability Study
The seven-member panel was tested twice per day with a minimum of two replicates
per testing period, for 20 non-consecutive days. Testing at a manufacturer’s internal
site was conducted by one operator using one lot of the Acucy Influenza A&B Test
and one Acucy Reader. Table 1 below shows the results of the within-laboratory
repeatability study.

External Quality Controls
The Acucy Influenza A&B Test includes one Influenza A+/B- Control Swab (Red
Label) and one Influenza A-/B+ Control Swab (Blue Label), each of which contains
inactivated virus, for external quality control testing. Refer to the “Device
Description” section of this summary for details regarding these controls.
The External Quality Controls are used to monitor that the assay-specific reagents,
Test Cassettes, and Acucy Reader are functioning properly, and to demonstrate
proper performance by the operator. External Quality Control requirements should be
established in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations or accreditations
requirements. Minimally, Sekisui Diagnostics recommends that External Quality
Controls be run with each new lot, shipment received and with each new untrained
operator.

During the prospective clinical study conducted during the 2017 to 2018 influenza
season, quality control testing using the external quality controls was performed per
the product Instructions for Use at all 16 CLIA waived study sites. A total of 960
Influenza A+/B- Control Swabs and 957 Influenza A-/B+ Control Swabs were tested
during the clinical evaluation of the Acucy Influenza A&B Test with the Acucy
Reader by operators representative of those in CLIA waived settings who were not
selected to participate in the clinical evaluation of the Acucy Influenza A&B Test
with the Acucy Reader. Three different lots of Influenza A+/B- Control Swab and
Influenza A-/B+ Control Swab were used with one lot of the test reagents (Test
Cassette and Extraction Buffer) between December 2017 and May 2018. Upon initial
testing, there were 14 invalid results (for both the Influenza A+/B- Control Swab and
the Influenza A-/B+ Control Swab), 8 failed results for the Influenza A+/B- Control
Swab, and 11 failed results for the Influenza A-/B+ Control Swab. All controls with
initial invalid or failed results generated expected results upon repeat testing. The
failure rate upon initial testing (including the failed and the invalid results) of the
external quality control materials was 1.7% (33/1917), with 95% CI: (1.2% - 2.4%).
Nasal and Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimens Stability
Analytical studies were performed to evaluate the stability of clinical nasal swab (NS)
and nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens, when stored at room temperature and
refrigerated temperature. Samples were prepared in Clinical Nasal Matrix (CNM).
CNM was obtained from a vendor. The pooled matrix was prepared by the vendor
from leftover negative clinical samples (confirmed negative for influenza A and
influenza B with an FDA-cleared molecular test) from other studies. One influenza A
strain (A/Hong Kong/4801/14) and one influenza B strain (B/Phuket/3073/13) were
diluted in CNM to levels corresponding to 2x LoD to prepare the positive samples.
Negative samples were CNM only. To prepare contrived NS and NPS samples for
testing, 50 µL of virus dilution was applied to a NS or a NPS and then reinserted into
the original swab packaging for storage at the specified temperatures.
A set of contrived NS and NPS samples (three replicates per storage condition) were
stored at room temperature (15° - 30°C) for the following time periods before
extraction and testing: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9 hours. Another set of contrived NS and NPS
samples (three replicates per storage condition) were stored at refrigerated
temperature (2° - 8°C) for the following time periods before extraction and testing: 0,
1, 4, 8, 16, and 25 hours. After the specified storage interval, the contrived NS and
NPS samples were extracted in Extraction Buffer and tested with the Acucy Influenza
A&B Test according to the directions in the Instructions for Use. Testing was
performed with one lot of reagents using the READ NOW mode.
The results for the contrived samples in CNM stored at room temperature (15° -
30°C) show 100% agreement with Time 0 at all time points (up to 9 hours) for both
swab types (nasal and nasopharyngeal), supporting a stability claim of 8 hours at
room temperature (15° - 30°C). The results for the contrived samples in CNM stored
at refrigerated temperature (2° - 8°C) also show 100% agreement with Time 0 at all
14

--- Page 15 ---
time points (up to 25 hours) for both swab types (nasal and nasopharyngeal),
supporting a stability claim of 24 hours at refrigerated temperature (2° - 8°C).
Extracted Specimens Stability
Analytical studies were performed to evaluate the stability of extracted specimens,
when stored at room temperature, refrigerated, and frozen. Samples were prepared in
the same CNM used in the NS and NPS Specimens Stability studies. One influenza A
strain (A/Hong Kong/4801/14) and one influenza B strain (B/Phuket/3073/13) were
diluted in CNM to levels corresponding to 2x LoD to prepare the positive samples.
Negative samples were CNM only. To prepare contrived NS samples for testing, 50
µL of virus dilution was applied to a NS and dried for at least one minute prior to
extraction. Sufficient number of contrived NS samples that allow testing three
replicates per storage condition were prepared. Prepared samples were then extracted
in Extraction Buffer according to the Acucy Influenza A&B Test Instructions for Use.
Extracted samples were stored in the Extraction Buffer vials at the following
specified temperature ranges and time points until they were tested:
· room temperature (15° - 30°C) for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, and 25 hours
· refrigerated temperature (2° - 8°C) for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 25 hours
· frozen temperature (-5° to -25°C) for 0, 1, 7, 14, 21, and 31 days
Testing was performed with one lot of reagents using the READ NOW mode.
Extracted specimens stored at room temperature (15° to 30°C) show 100% agreement
with Time 0 results up to 13 hours. Failures were observed at 16 and 25 hours. This
data supports a stability claim of 12 hours at room temperature (15° - 30°C).
Extracted specimens stored refrigerated (2° to 8°C) show 100% agreement with Time
0 results for the duration of the testing schedule of 25 hours, supporting a stability
claim of 24 hours when refrigerated at temperature of 2° to 8°C. Extracted specimens
stored frozen (-5° to -25°C) also show 100% agreement with Day 0 results for the
duration of the testing schedule of 31 days, supporting a stability claim of 30 days
when frozen at temperature -5° to -25°C.
Open Test Cassette and Extraction Buffer Stability
Analytical studies were conducted to determine the stability of open Acucy Influenza
A&B Test cassettes held at room temperature at various time points and to determine
the stability of open vials of Acucy Influenza A&B Test Extraction Buffer held at
room temperature or in a refrigerator at various time points.
Acucy Influenza A&B Test cassettes were opened, removed from the pouch and
incubated at room temperature (15° - 30°C). Acucy Influenza A&B Test Extraction
Buffer vials were opened and incubated at either room temperature (15° - 30°C) or
refrigerated at 2° - 8°C. At various time points (2, 5, 9, 17, and 25 hours), three test
cassettes or Extraction Buffer vials were removed from storage and tested with
15

--- Page 16 ---
contrived influenza A and influenza B samples. At Time 0 and each subsequent time
point, unopened test cassettes and extraction buffer vials representing all incubation
conditions were run as control conditions.
Contrived test samples were prepared by diluting an influenza A strain
(A/California/07/09) and an influenza B strain (B/Brisbane/60/08) to a concentration
of 2x LoD in Viral Transport Media. Samples (50 µL) were applied to
nasopharyngeal swabs, dried for at least one minute, and tested with the stored
reagents using the READ NOW mode. One lot of reagents was tested.
There was 100% qualitative agreement between the open test cassette/extraction
buffer and the control condition at all time points. The data support the stability of an
opened Acucy Influenza A&B Test cassette for up to 24 hours at room temperature
(15° - 30°C). The data also support the stability of an opened Acucy Influenza A&B
Extraction Buffer vial for up to 24 hours at both room temperature (15° - 30°C) and
refrigerated temperature (2° - 8°C).
Matrix Equivalency Study
In order to utilize Viral Transport Media (VTM) as a simulated nasal matrix in
making contrived samples to be tested in precision/reproducibility studies and other
analytical studies, an analytical study was performed to evaluate the performance
using VTM as simulated nasal matrix against a true negative Clinical Nasal Matrix
(CNM) with the Acucy Influenza A&B Test.
CNM was obtained from a vendor. The pooled matrix was prepared by the vendor
from leftover negative clinical samples (confirmed negative for influenza A and
influenza B with an FDA-cleared molecular test) from other studies. Thirty (30)
contrived influenza A samples (A/Hong Kong/4801/14) and 30 contrived influenza B
samples (B/Brisbane/60/2008) were prepared at approximately 2x LoD, using either
pooled Clinical Nasal Matrix (CNM) or VTM as a diluent. VTM or CNM without
addition of virus was used as a negative sample. Virus dilutions (50 µL) were coated
onto nasopharyngeal swabs, allowed to dry for at least one minute, and tested using
the Acucy Influenza A&B Test. Each was tested with three test cassette lots, for a
total of 90 replicates for each sample. Testing was performed using the READ NOW
mode.
Results of this study are presented in Table 5 below.

Swab Equivalency Study
This study was performed to evaluate the use of both Copan nasal swabs (Copan part
number 519CS01) and nasopharyngeal swabs (Copan part number 534CS01) with the
Acucy Influenza A&B Test and to demonstrate equivalent performance of the test
both swab types.
Twenty (20) influenza A contrived samples (A/Hong Kong/4801/14 diluted to 2x
LoD in CNM), twenty influenza B contrived samples (B/Phuket/3073/13 diluted to 2x
LoD in CNM), and twenty negative samples (CNM) were prepared. Each virus
dilution (50 µL) was coated on both swab types. All samples were tested with one lot
of the Acucy Influenza A&B Test. Testing was performed using the READ NOW
mode.
Results of this study are presented in Table 6 below.

performance studies.
d. Detection limit:
Two strains of each viral type of influenza A (H1N1pdm09 and H3N2) and influenza
B (Victoria and Yamagata lineages) were tested in a two-step approach that involved
first testing a series of 10-fold dilutions (n=3) to determine the initial starting point
for the second 2-fold dilution series with 20 replicates for each dilution. The 2-fold
dilution series starting point was determined to be the last 10-fold dilution that
produced a 100% detection rate (3/3) with the subsequent dilution producing a
detection rate less than 100%. The Limit of Detection (LoD) results from the second
dilution series were confirmed by testing an additional 40 replicates (20 replicates
tested with two different reagent lots). The LoD for each strain was determined to be
the dilution concentration (in TCID /mL) that produced a ≥ 95% detection rage for a
50
given target.
Contrived samples were prepared by diluting viral strains in pooled Clinical Nasal
Matrix (CNM), which was confirmed negative by PCR. For each test, 50 µL was
pipetted onto the head of a new nasopharyngeal swab. The seeded swab was then
extracted into 400 µL of Acucy Flu A&B Extraction Buffer. Five drops of extracted
sample were applied to the sample well of the test cassette. Testing was performed
using the READ NOW mode. The LoD confirmation study results are presented in
Table 8 below.

e. Analytical Reactivity
Analytical Inclusivity Study
This study was performed to demonstrate that the Acucy Influenza A&B Test can
detect a wide range of well characterized influenza A and influenza B strains with
global epidemiological representation. For this study, 28 characterized strains were
tested, composed of 23 strains of influenza A (6 H1N1 strains, 5 H1N1pdm09 strains,
10 H3N2 strains, 1 H3N2v strain, and 1 H7N9 avian strain) and 5 strains of influenza
B.
The influenza strains were obtained from vendors and repositories. Each strain was
diluted in viral transport media at a concentration of approximately 1.5x LoD, and 50
µL was applied to each nasopharyngeal swab. Testing was performed in triplicate in
the READ NOW mode. If fewer than three of the replicates were detected, additional
testing was performed to determine the concentration at which 100% agreement
(observed/expected) was achieved using six replicates.
Results of the analytical inclusivity study are presented in Table 9 below.

CDC Human Influenza Virus Panel for 2017
This study was performed to determine the minimum reactive concentrations for the
CDC Human Influenza Virus Panel for 2017 with the Acucy Influenza A&B Test.
For this study, 10 characterized strains were used, composed of six strains of
influenza A (2 H1N1 strains, 2 H3N2 strains, and 2 H1N1pdm09 strains) and 4
strains of influenza B (2 strains representing the Victoria lineage and 2 strains
representing the Yamagata lineage). The strains were obtained from the CDC, as the
Human Influenza Panel for 2017. The strains were prepared and tested according to
the instructions provided by CDC.
Each strain was serially diluted 1:5 in viral transport media. For each replicate, 50 µL
was applied to a nasopharyngeal swab and allowed to dry for one minute before being
processed following the instructions for the Acucy Influenza A&B Test. Testing was
performed in replicates of five using the READ NOW mode. Testing was performed
up to the point where there was no reactivity at two consecutive five-fold dilutions, as
shown by obtaining zero positive results for all five replicates at a tested
concentration.
Table 10 below shows the minimum reactive concentration for the 10 influenza
strains.

CDC Human Influenza Virus Panel for 2018
This study was performed to determine the minimum reactive concentration of the
CDC Human Influenza Virus Panel for 2018 with the Acucy Influenza A&B Test.
Eight (8) characterized strains were used in this study, composed of four strains of
Influenza A (2 H1N1pdm09 strains and 2 H3N2 strains), and four strains of Influenza
B (2 Victoria lineage strains and 2 Yamagata lineage strains). The strains were
obtained from the CDC, as part of the Human Influenza Virus Panel for 2018. Each
strain was serially diluted 1:5 in viral transport media. For each replicate, 50 µL was
applied to a nasopharyngeal swab and allowed to dry for one minute before being
processed following the instructions for the Acucy Influenza A&B Test. Testing was
performed in replicates of five using the READ NOW mode. Testing was performed
up to the point where there was no reactivity at two consecutive five-fold dilutions, as

Cross-Reactivity Study
This study was performed to evaluate the potential of the Acucy Influenza A&B Test
to cross-react with non-target microbial organisms, representing common respiratory
pathogens or flora, resulting in a false positive result. A total of 41 organisms (viral,
bacterial, and fungal) and human DNA were tested in triplicate with the Acucy
Influenza A&B Test. Potentially cross-reactive bacteria and yeast representing
common respiratory pathogens or flora were tested at a final concentration of ≥1 × 106
Colony-Forming Units/mL (CFU/mL) or Color Changing Units/mL (CCU/mL), or
highest concentrations available for testing. Potentially interfering common respiratory
viral pathogens or flora were tested at a final test concentration of ≥1 × 105 50%
Tissue Culture Infective Dose/mL (TCID /mL), Particle Forming Units/mL (pfu/mL),
50
or copies/mL, or highest concentrations available for testing. Human genomic DNA
was tested at a final test concentration of 1 × 104 copies/mL. The diluted organisms or
human DNA sample (10 uL) were added to the extraction buffer to yield the desired
testing concentrations. Three replicates of each sample were tested. Testing was
performed using the READ NOW mode.
Results of the cross-reactivity study are summarized in Table 12 below.

* Required re-testing.
The results show there is no observed cross-reactivity with the organisms or human
genomic DNA at the concentrations tested. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was re-tested
after the original data showed 1 of the 3 replicates positive for Flu B. The re-test
confirmed that the microorganism is not cross-reactive in the Acucy Influenza A&B
Test. Upon investigation, it was determined that the false positive replicate was caused
by particulate matter on the Read Window of the Test Cassette.
Microbial Interference Study
Microbial interference was assessed for the Acucy Influenza A&B Test using the same
42-member test panel as the one used in the Cross-Reactivity Study above. The
organism or human genomic DNA was mixed with either influenza A or influenza B
in the same sample to determine if the presence of the non-target organism or human
genomic DNA would interfere with the detection of the influenza analyte using the
Acucy Influenza A&B Test.
Contrived samples with Influenza A (A/Hong Kong 4801/14) or Influenza B
(B/Phuket/3073/13) were prepared at a concentration of approximately 2x LoD.
Influenza samples were prepared in viral transport media (VTM), and 50 uL was
applied to nasopharyngeal swabs, which were allowed to dry for one hour prior to
testing. The diluted organisms (10 uL) were added to the extraction buffer to yield the
desired concentration for testing before introducing the contrived sample swab. Three
replicates of each sample were tested. Testing was performed using the READ NOW

g. Competitive Interference Study
Since the Acucy Influenza A&B Test detects two analytes (influenza A and B), a
competitive interference study was conducted to determine whether viral target
analytes at a high viral concentration would interfere with the detection of a second
target at near LoD concentrations in co-infected samples.
A high-titer target at a medically relevant level (≥1 x 104 TCID /mL), or VTM only,
50
was mixed with the second target at a low-titer level (approximately 4x LoD). Viral
strains used in this study were A/California/07/09 (H1N1pdm09), A/Hong
Kong/4801/14 (H3N2), and B/Phuket/3073/13. Testing was performed in triplicate
with the Acucy Influenza A&B Test to determine whether detection of the low-titer
targets was affected by the presence of the high-titer strain. The contrived samples
were prepared according to the scheme shown in Table 14 below. High-titer strains or
VTM were mixed in a tube with low-titer strains to the concentrations in Table 14.
Then 50 µL was applied to a swab and allowed to dry for 1 hour before testing.
Testing was performed using the READ NOW mode.

h. Potentially Interfering Substances Study
A total of 23 potentially interfering substances, either naturally present in respiratory
specimens or artificially introduced into the nasal cavity or nasopharynx, were tested
in this study to evaluate the susceptibility of the Acucy Influenza A&B Test to
interference when elevated levels of these substances were added to influenza A and
influenza B positive samples.
Positive influenza A and influenza B contrived samples were prepared by diluting
viral strains (A/Hong Kong/4801/14 and B/Phuket/3073/13) in Viral Transport Media
(VTM) to approximately 2x LoD. The potentially interfering substances were spiked
into the influenza A and influenza B samples at elevated levels. Two controls were
also run, samples spiked with VTM only and samples spiked with no interfering
substances. Samples (50 µL) were applied to nasopharyngeal swabs and tested in
triplicate with the Acucy Influenza A&B Test. Testing was performed using the
READ NOW mode.
Concentrations of potentially interfering substances tested and the study results are
summarized in Table 16 below.

i. Carry-Over Study
This study evaluated the potential of sample carry-over between test cassettes when
high-titer (1 x 105 TCID /mL) samples were run in an alternating fashion with
50
negative samples.
High titer influenza A samples (n=30) were prepared using the A/Hong Kong/4801/14
strain diluted in VTM to a concentration of 1 x 105 TCID /mL. High titer influenza B
50
samples (n=30) were prepared using the B/Phuket/3073/13 strain diluted in VTM to a
concentration of 1 x 105 TCID /mL. Negative samples (n=60) were prepared using
50
VTM. Dilutions (80 µL) were applied to nasal swabs, allowed to dry for up to one
minute, and tested using the Acucy Influenza A&B Test using the READ NOW mode.
Positive and negative samples were alternated so that a negative sample was always

j. Assay cut-off
Primary Cut-off
The initial cutoff of 5.0 milli-absorbance units (mAbs) was established as a default
setting for the Acucy Reader by the instrument developer.
Sixty (60) negative samples, 60 influenza A positive (1x LoD) samples, and 60
influenza B positive samples (1x LoD) were tested with two lots of the Acucy
Influenza A&B Test to verify the initial assay cutoff. All contrived samples were
prepared in pooled Clinical Nasal Matrix (CNM). Negative samples were CNM only.
An influenza A strain (A/Hong Kong/4801/14) was diluted to approximately 1x LoD
in CNM. An influenza B strain (B/Brisbane/60/2008) was diluted to approximately 1x
LoD in CNM. Clinical nasal matrix was obtained from a vendor. The pooled matrix
was prepared by the vendor from leftover negative samples (from a clinical study for
another investigational device) that were confirmed negative for influenza A and
influenza B with an FDA-cleared molecular test. For each replicate, 50 µL of each
contrived sample were applied to a nasopharyngeal swab and dried one minute before
extraction and testing. Testing was performed using the READ NOW mode.
Data from the Positive influenza A and B samples in this study showed separation of
the positive signal above the cutoff and no examples of false positives. Data from the
negative samples in this study were used to calculate the Limit of Blank (LoB) using
the Classical Approach (non-parametric analysis) decribed in the CLSI EP17-A2,
Evaluation of Detection Capability for the Clinical Laboratory Measurement
Procedures; Approved Guideline – Second Ed. June 2012. The calculated LoB values
from this study, 4.71 mAbs for influenza A and 3.51 for influenza B, represented the
maximal values determined for influenza A and influenza B, respectively. These data

supported the initial cutoff of 5.0 mAbs for both the influenza A line and the influenza
B line.
Clinical validation of the initial 5.0 mAbs cutoff was performed using the clinical
dataset from a previously conducted clinical study during the 2016-2017 influenza
season. In total, 1252 clinical samples were analyzed for both test lines in the Receiver
Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis. From this ROC analysis, the optimal cutoff
for influenza A was determined to be 6.4 mAbs, with a sensitivity of 88.6% and a
specificity of 95.4%. For influenza B, the optimal cutoff was determined to be 5.4
mAbs with a sensitivity of 84.4% and a specificity of 96.5%.
Secondary Cut-off
The Acucy Reader uses a secondary cutoff in the event that one analyte has a result
that is ≥ 350 mAbs. This cutoff was set to 26.0 mAbs for influenza A and B, as high
titer samples have been shown to generate higher levels of non-specific binding at the
second test line, resulting in signals greater than 5.0 mAbs and a false positive result
for the second analyte. A study was performed to verify the secondary cutoff.
Different concentrations of influenza A and influenza B were tested alone or combined
(simulating a co-infected sample).
Contrived samples were prepared by diluting an influenza A viral strain (A/Hong
Kong/4801/14) and/or an influenza B viral strain (B/Brisbane/60/2008) in VTM.
Samples were prepared at three levels: a concentration to produce a result of > 350
mAbs (High); a concentration to produce a result of 30-50 mAbs (Mid); and a
concentration to produce a result of < 25 mAbs (Low).
Data from this study and the Carry-Over Study validated the effectiveness of this
secondary cutoff in preventing the reporting of false positive results for the second
analyte when one analyte is present in very high concentrations.
Cut-off Validation
Both the primary and the secondary cut-offs were further validated during the
prospective clinical study conducted during the 2017-2018 influenza season.

3. Clinical Studies:
Clinical performance characteristics of the Acucy Influenza A&B Test with the Acucy
Reader were evaluated in a multi-center prospective study during the 2017-2018
influenza season in the U.S. To be enrolled in the study, patients had to present at the
participating study centers with influenza-like symptoms as defined in the clinical study
protocol, and to provide informed consents.
Patient subjects were randomized to have either two nasal swabs or two nasopharyngeal
swabs collected according to standard collection methods (i.e., even numbered subjects
had two nasal swabs collected and odd numbered subjects had two nasopharyngeal swabs
collected). The paired nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from each
subject from the same nostril. The paired swabs were collected in no set order for testing
under the clinical study protocol (i.e., one for Acucy Influenza A&B Test and the other
for reference methods testing). Any swab specimens required for standard of care testing
were collected prior to the specimens for this investigation; nasal washes/aspirates for
standard of care testing excluded a patient from study participation.
Sixteen (16) geographically diverse Point of Care (POC) clinical sites (CLIA waived
sites) participated in the study. At least one, but no more than three untrained CLIA
waived operators performed testing at each site. Testing personnel were blinded to the
standard of care test results for the specimens they tested. Two reference labs participated
in the study to perform reference methods testing of the samples. Samples for testing by
the reference labs were prepared as directed by the reference testing laboratories and sent
by courier on the day of sample collection to the reference lab for receipt the following
day. Testing at the reference laboratories was performed by trained laboratory personnel.
One of the paired nasal or nasopharyngeal swab was used for immediate testing with the
Acucy Influenza A&B Test per the instructions for use. Each site was supplied with two
Acucy Readers. One Acucy Reader was used to test specimens in the “READ NOW”
mode and the second in the “WALK AWAY/NORMAL” mode. The other nasal or
nasopharyngeal swab of the pair was rotated in 3.0 mL of viral transport media (VTM)
for 10 seconds within one hour of specimen collection. The swab was subsequently
removed and discarded. The sample eluted in VTM was stored at 2-8ºC until transport
was made on the same day as specimen collection on ice-packs in an insulated container.
The samples collected in VTM were tested by the reference methods within the allowable
time frames of specimen collection per the standard reference laboratory cell culture
procedure or the Instructions for Use for the FDA-cleared molecular tests.
The performance of the Acucy Influenza A&B Test with the Acucy Reader was
evaluated against a compostite reference result, which was calculated from the results
of three reference methods: two FDA-cleared molecular methods and cell culture.
The composite reference result for each specimen tested by all three reference
33

--- Page 34 ---
methods was based on the following algorithm:
· At least two out of three reference methods positive = positive result for
either Flu A or B;
· One out of three reference methods positive = negative result for either Flu A
or B;
· At least two out of three reference methods negative = negative for either Flu
A or B.
Nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from 1053 subjects enrolled in
the clinical study. There were 41 swab samples excluded from the performance analyses
due to patient eligibility and sample handling issues, and inconclusive reference testing
results, leaving a total of 1012 prospectively collected swab samples to be included in the
evaluation of the assay performance. Additional nine samples generated a final invalid
result with the Acucy Influenza A&B Test, resulting in a total of 1003 samples with valid
results.
Patient age and gender distribution for the 1003 prospective specimens is presented in
Table 18 below.

Compared to the composite reference algorithm, the performance of the Acucy
Influenza A&B Test for influenza A and influenza B in the prospective clinical study
was also analyzed by study site. The Acucy Influenza A&B Test demonstrated similar
performance across the 16 study sites for influenza A and influenza B, respectively.
The initial invalid rate observed during the clinical study was 1.8% (18/1012), 95% CI:
(1.1% - 2.8%). Nine of the 18 samples with an invalid result initially generated valid
results upon retest, while nine of the 18 samples with an invalid result initially were not
retested.
The Acucy Influenza A&B Test detected three mixed influenza A and B
infections in this prospective clinical evaluation. Of the three samples tested positive
for influenza A and influenza B by the Acucy Influenza A&B Test, the composite
reference result for one of the three sample was negative for influenza A and influenza

3. Specimen Identification:
Operator labels the Extraction Buffer vial with the extracted patient sample with patient
identification. Operator enters the patient identification into the Acucy Reader by
scanning the patient’s ID barcode using the reader scanner or by manually entering the
patient ID using the keypad on the reader screen. Operator then opens the Test Cassette
foil pouch, labels the Test Cassette with the patient ID. Test Cassette scanned
automatically by the reader once it is inserted in the reader.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
An operator first collects a patient NS or NPS sample. The operator removes the cap off
an Extraction Buffer vial, and inserts the NS or NPS sample into the Extraction Buffer
vial, and vigorously mixes against the side of the vial 10 times while submerged. The
operator then removes the swab while squeezing the vial to remove the liquid from the
swab, properly discards the swab, adds dropper tip to the Extraction Buffer vial, presses
to seal the vial, and labels the vial with patient identification.
After the swab sample elution/extraction step, the procedure for testing depends on the
reader workflow configuration chosen by the operator.
WALK AWAY/NORMAL Mode
In the WALK AWAY/NORMAL mode, the operator first enters the patient
identification. The operator then opens the Test Cassette foil pouch, labels the Test
Cassette with the patient ID, opens the reader drawer, and inserts the Test Cassette. The
reader automatically scans the Test Cassette. While the Test Cassette is in the reader
drawer, the operator gently mixes the Extraction Buffer vial to agitate sample, and then
inverts the Extraction Buffer vial vertically above the Test Cassette to gently squeeze 5
39

--- Page 40 ---
drops of extracted sample into the sample well of the Test Cassette. The operator closes
the drawer within 10 seconds. The Reader automatically times the 15-minute
development. After the 15 minutes, the reader automatically displays the test results. The
operator subsequently opens the reader drawer, removes the Test Cassette, and disposes it
in a proper biohazard container.
READ NOW Mode
In the READ NOW Mode, the operator first opens the Test Cassette foil pouch and labels
the Test Cassette with the patient ID. While the Test Cassette is on a flat surface, the
operator inverts the Extraction Buffer vial vertically above the Test Cassette and gently
squeeze 5 drops of extracted sample into the sample well of the Test Cassette. The
operator then starts an external timer for 15 minutes. While the Test Cassette is
developing, the operator enters the patient identification into the reader. Once the 15-
minute is complete, the operator opens the reader drawer, and inserts the Test Cassette.
The reader automatically scans the Test Cassette. The operator then immediately closes
the drawer. The reader automatically displays the test results. The operator subsequently
opens the reader drawer, removes the Test Cassette, and disposes it in a proper biohazard
container.
5. Calibration:
The Acucy Reader calibration is a required function that checks the Acucy Reader optics
and calculation systems using a specific CAL-Device. The CAL-Device is supplied in a
calibration case with the Acucy System accessories. The Calibration Procedure is
performed upon installation to activate the QC TEST and RUN TEST functionality and is
required every 30-days. The operator is prompted by the Acucy Reader to conduct
calibration with the CAL-Device after the 30-days has elapsed. The Calibration
Procedure may also be performed, as directed during troubleshooting or whenever the
Acucy Reader date & time has been changed.
6. Quality Control:
Quality control is addressed for each specific FDA-cleared assay to be run on the
instrument.
