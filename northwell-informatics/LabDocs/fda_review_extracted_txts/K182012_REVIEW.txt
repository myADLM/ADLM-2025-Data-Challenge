L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA Centaur CALCT assay is a fully automated, two-step immunoassay using direct
chemiluminescent technology. Calcitonin in the sample is captured by the biotinylated anti-
calcitonin mouse monoclonal antibody-coated paramagnetic microparticles present in the
Solid Phase reagent. Unbound reagent is removed and the immunocomplexes on the
paramagnetic particles are resuspended using the ADVIA Centaur Wash 1. The acridinium-
ester-labeled antibody present in the Lite Reagent binds to a different epitope of calcitonin.
After a wash step, the Acid and Base Reagents are added to initiate the chemiluminescent
reaction. The amount of calcitonin present in the sample is directly proportional to the
relative light units (RLUs) detected by the system.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run and total precision were evaluated according to the CLSI EP05-A3
guideline. Precision studies were conducted using 3 serum pools and 2 spiked serum
pools tested using 3 reagent lots. Samples were tested in replicates of 2, with 2 runs
per day over 20 days, totaling 80 measurements per sample. All 3 lots yielded similar
results. The results of one representative lot are summarized in the table below:

--- Page 5 ---
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the ADVIA Centaur® CALCT assay was evaluated using 7 diluted
samples with calcitonin concentrations evenly distributed throughout the measuring
range, prepared from high and low serum pools with concentrations that encompassed
the claimed measuring range. Each of the 7 diluted samples, along with the high and
low serum pools (a total of 9 concentrations), was tested in replicates of 5, using 3
reagent lots.
The linear regression equation of a representative lot is shown below:
y = 0.988 x + 0.012 R2 = 1.00
The linearity study supports the sponsor’s claimed measuring rang: 1.75 – 2000
pg/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The ADVIA Centaur CALCT assay is traceable to the World Health Organization
(WHO) 2nd International Reference Preparation for Calcitonin (Human); NIBSC
code: 89/620. Assigned values for calibrators are traceable to this standard.
d. Detection limit
The analytical limits at low levels were determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-
A2 guideline.
Limit of blank (LoB) was determined using 3 reagent lots on 1 analyzer, measuring 4
zero-level serum pools over 3 days, 1 run per day, 5 replicates per run, for a total of
60 blank measurements per reagent lot. LoB was calculated as follows: sample
measurements were ranked from lowest to highest, then the rank position of the 95th
percentile was calculated using the equation: Rank position = 0.5+n*0.95.
Limit of detection (LoD) was determined using 3 reagent lots on 1 analyzer,
measuring sample pools with low concentration of calcitonin (0.50-6.00 pg/mL). The
samples were analyzed over 4 days (reagent lot 1) and 3 days (reagent lot 2 and 3),
with 1 run per day, 7 replicates per run ensuring a minimum of 60 replicates per
reagent lot. The LoD was determined as the lowest concentration of calcitonin that
can be detected with 95% probability.
Limit of quantitation (LoQ) was determined using the data used to generate LoD, by
comparing the Total Error (=Bias + 2*SD) at each pool level. The LoQ was
determined as the lowest concentration of calcitonin that can be detected at a total
error of 20%.

The detection limits are summarized in the table below:
LoB LoD LoQ
1.29 pg/mL 1.65 pg/mL 1.75 pg/mL
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interference was evaluated using human serum pools with calcitonin
concentrations of 8.88 -14.12 pg/mL (serum 1) and 380.21 – 515.68 pg/mL (serum 2).
Each interferent was spiked at 2 concentrations, and an equivalent control was
prepared for each spike using the diluent without the interferent. Samples were tested
in replicates of 5, using 3 reagent lots. The sponsor defined significant interference as
a difference greater than ± 10% of the control value. The endogenous interference
effects on calcitonin quantitation are summarized in the table below:

Exogenous Interference was evaluated using human serum pools with calcitonin
concentrations of 5.33 - 12.94 pg/mL (serum 1) and 196.79 - 520.50 pg/mL (serum
2). Each interferent was spiked at 2 concentrations, and an equivalent control was
prepared for each spike using the diluent without the interferent. Samples were tested
in replicates of 5, using 3 reagent lots. The sponsor defined significant interference as
a difference greater than ± 10% of the control value. The exogenous interference
effects on calcitonin quantitation are summarized in the table below:

In addition, a study was conducted to determine biotin interference. Biotin was added
to serum samples containing different levels of calcitonin. The samples were tested
against appropriate controls and the observed bias is presented in the table below.
Interference was defined as a difference >±10% of the control sample values.

The following statement was included within the Limitations section of the labeling:
Patient samples with low calcitonin levels may demonstrate falsely depressed results
in presence of biotin greater than 40 ng/mL. Do not test samples from patients who
take high doses of biotin. If biotin interference is suspected, follow your established
internal procedures to investigate the interference or test with an alternative assay
that is not affected by biotin interference.
Cross Reactivity was evaluated using human serum pools with calcitonin
concentrations of 7.57-11.65 pg/mL, according to CLSI EP07-A2 guideline. Each of
these pools was spiked with cross-reactants as detailed in the table below, and an
equivalent control was prepared for each spike using the diluent without the
interferent. Samples were tested in replicates of 5, using 3 reagent lots. Cross-
reactivity was estimated using the following formula:
