L. Test Principle:
The Randox Calcium (Ca) reagent uses the Arsenazo III assay protocol. Arsenazo III
specifically binds to calcium forming a colored complex at 660 nm.
Ca++ + Arsenazo → III Colored complex
The amount of calcium present in the sample is directly proportional to the intensity of the
colored complex formed.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated consistent with the CLSI EP05-A3 guideline. Separate
precision studies were conducted for serum and urine matrices and were performed
using one operator on one RX daytona plus system.
The serum precision study analyzed human serum samples spiked with calcium
chloride (CaCl ) to the concentrations listed in the table below. Testing was
2
conducted twice per day for 20 non consecutive days. Two replicates per run was
performed for each sample. Two reagent lots were evaluated and the results were
comparable between the lots. Representative performance from one lot is presented
below:

Urine precision studies were performed for calcium using two levels of urine
controls, calibration material and human urine samples. Testing was conducted twice
per day for 20 non consecutive days. Two replicates per run was performed for each
sample. Two reagent lots were evaluated and the results were comparable between
the lots. Representative performance from one lot is presented below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor performed linearity studies referencing the CLSI EP6-A guideline.
Serum and urine linearity samples were prepared at eleven levels, including
concentrations above and below the claimed measuring range of the assay. Each
level was run in replicates of five on two lots of Calcium reagent on a single day.
Recoveries for serum samples ranged from 95.1 – 106.0% and linear regression
analysis of a representative lot produced the following results:
Serum: y = 1.02x + 0.04, r = 1.00
Recoveries for urine samples ranged from 90.7 – 104.2% and linear regression
analysis of a representative lot produced the following:
Urine: y = 0.98x + 0.28, r = 1.00
The results of the linearity study support the sponsor’s claimed measuring range of
1.0 to 16.0 mg/dL for serum and plasma and 1.0 to 32.0 mg/dL for urine.
Automatic Dilution:
The Rx daytona plus analyzer has an auto-dilution feature. When a calcium
concentration exceeds the upper end of the reportable range (16 mg/dL for serum and
32 mg/dL for urine), the result is flagged, and the sample is diluted with saline and re-
run automatically by the instrument.

The sponsor performed a study to evaluate the auto-dilution feature and the results
supported the sponsor’s claim that the instrument could automatically and accurately
dilute the out of range high concentration samples.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability for the Randox Calcium (Ca) reagent is standardized against primary
calibrators traceable to Calcium reference materials NIST 909b and SRM956b.
d. Detection limit:
A limit of blank (LoB), a limit of detection (LoD) and a limit of quantitation (LoQ)
studies were performed for both serum and urine using two lots of Randox Calcium
(Ca) reagent tested by one operator on one RX daytona plus system.
Serum
The limit of blank (LoB) was evaluated using four blank samples which were run in
replicates of five over three days for a total of 15 replicates per sample. The LoB was
calculated to be 0.02 mg/dL as the 95th percentile of the 60 results sorted from low to
high.
The limit of detection (LoD) was calculated to be 0.18 mg/dL based on 240
determinations using 4 samples with low calcium concentrations. The formula used
was LoB value + CpSDL where Cp is derived from the 95th percentile of the standard
Gaussian distribution, and SDL is the estimated standard deviation of the 4 low level
samples tested.
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was determined as the lowest concentration at which
precision and accuracy are still met, with acceptable criteria ≤20% accuracy and
≤20% imprecision. The data was collected over five days.
The two lots evaluated produced LoQ’s of 0.41 mg/dL and 0.53 mg/dL. The sponsor
claims 0.53 mg/dL as LoQ for the candidate device.
Urine
The LoB was evaluated using four blank samples which were run in replicates of five
over three days for a total of 15 replicates per sample. The LoB was calculated to be
0.08 mg/dL as the 95th percentile of the 60 results sorted from low to high.
The LoD was calculated to be 0.15 mg/dL based on 240 determinations using 4
samples with low calcium concentrations. The formula used was LoB value + CpSDL
where Cp is derived from the 95th percentile of the standard Gaussian distribution,
and SDL is the estimated standard deviation of the 4 low level samples tested.

--- Page 7 ---
The LoQ was determined as the lowest concentration at which precision and accuracy
are still met, with acceptable criteria ≤20% accuracy and ≤20% imprecision.
Two lots achieved LoQ’s of 0.60 mg/dL and 0.55 mg/dL. The sponsor claims an LoQ
of 0.60 mg/dL for the candidate device.
The sponsor claims a measuring range of 1.0 to 16.0 mg/dL for serum and plasma and
1.0 to 32.0 mg/dL for urine.
e. Analytical specificity:
The effects of potential interferents were determined separately for the serum and
urine matrices. The sponsor defined interference as ≥ 10% with the potential
interferent as compared to the control sample.
For serum the following analytes were tested and shown not to interfere up to the
levels indicated at calcium concentrations of 8 mg/dL and 12 mg/dL. The highest
concentration tested that did not cause interference is listed in the table below:
Highest level tested that

Total Bilirubin 60 mg/dL
Conjugated Bilirubin 60 mg/dL
Triglycerides 2000 mg/dL

For urine the following analytes were tested and shown not to interfere up to the
levels indicated at calcium concentrations of 9.0 mg/dL and 22.8 mg/dL. The highest

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor performed a method comparison on de-identified serum and urine
samples between the candidate device and the predicate (ADVIA Chemistry
Calcium_2 (CA_2) method cleared under k083386. Two lots of the candidate device
were evaluated with similar performance. Representative data from one lot is
presented below:
Serum Method Comparison
One hundred and eleven (111) serum patient samples ranging from 1.00 to 15.87
mg/dL were tested on the RX daytona plus analyzer and the predicate in singlicate.
Three diluted and eight spiked samples were included in the analysis. Linear
regression analysis produced the following equation:
y = 0.99x - 0.10, r = 0.99
Urine Method Comparison
One hundred (100) urine patient samples ranging from 1.20 to 31.78 mg/dL were
tested on the RX daytona plus analyzer and the predicate in singlicate. Four diluted
and three spiked samples were included in the analysis. Linear regression analysis
produced the following equation:
y = 0.98x - 0.24, r = 0.99
b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed to evaluate the use of plasma samples on
one RX daytona plus system using two lots of Calcium reagents. Patient samples
were drawn in matched pairs – one sample serum (x) and the second sample lithium
heparin plasma (y). Forty-seven (47) matched patient sample pairs were analyzed in
singlicate spanning the range 1.00 to 14.11 mg/dL. The performance between the two
reagent lots tested was similar and the following linear regression equation is
representative:
y = 0.97 x + 0.22, r = 0.99
The results of the matrix comparison study support the claim that serum and lithium
heparin plasma samples can be used with the Randox Calcium (Ca) assay.
