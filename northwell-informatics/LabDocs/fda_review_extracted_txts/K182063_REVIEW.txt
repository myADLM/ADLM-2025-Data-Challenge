L. Test Principle:
VITROS CRBM Slides (Multiple-point colorimetric/immuno-rate assay):
A drop of patient sample is deposited on the slide and is evenly distributed by the
spreading layer to the underlying layers. Carbamazepine in the sample competes with the
carbamazepine-peroxidase conjugate for a limited number of antibody binding sites during
incubation. The subsequent addition of 12 µL of VITROS Immuno-Wash Fluid to the slide
removes unbound carbamazepine-peroxidase conjugate from the read area, while also
providing a substrate for the enzyme mediated oxidation of leuco dye. The rate of dye
formation, as monitored by reflectance spectrophotometry during incubation, is inversely
proportional to the carbamazepine concentration in the sample. To determine if an
adequate wash has occurred, a wash detection dye is read at 540 nm during incubation.
7

--- Page 8 ---
VITROS CREA Slides (Colorimetric, two-point rate assay):
A drop of patient sample is deposited on the slide and is evenly distributed by the
spreading layer to the underlying layers. Creatinine diffuses to the reagent layer, where it
is hydrolyzed to creatine in the rate-determining step. The creatine is converted to
sarcosine and urea by creatinine amidinohydrolase. The sarcosine, in the presence of
sarcosine oxidase, is oxidized to glycine, formaldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide. The final
reaction involves the peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of a leuco dye to produce a colored
product. Following addition of the sample, the slide is incubated. During the initial
reaction phase, endogenous creatine in the sample is oxidized. The resulting change in
reflection density is measured at 2-time points. The difference in reflection density is
proportional to the concentration of creatinine present in the sample
VITROS TBIL Slides (Colorimetric, dual-wavelength endpoint):
A drop of patient sample is deposited on the slide and is evenly distributed by the
spreading layer to the underlying layers. This layer provides a reflective background for
measuring the diazo products of bilirubin and contains all reagents necessary to determine
total bilirubin. The method uses dyphylline to dissociate unconjugated bilirubin from
albumin. Unconjugated bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, and albumin-linked bilirubin (delta)
subsequently react with the diazonium salt 4-(N-carboxymethylsulfonyl)
benzenediazonium hexafluorophosphate to produce azobilirubin chromophores that have
similar molar absorptivity and absorbance maxima around 520 nm. The concentration of
total bilirubin is determined by measuring the azobilirubin chromophores at two
wavelengths through the transparent support. The reflectance measurement at 460 nm
corrects for spectral interferences.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted following EP05-A3 guideline. The study was
performed by testing a minimum of two quality control fluids and three human
serum pools using the Carbamazepine (CRBM), Creatinine (CREA), and Total
Bilirubin (TBIL) assays. Samples were analyzed using one VITROS XT 7600
Integrated System over 20 days, with 2 runs per day and 2 replicates per specimen
(n=80). The results of the precision studies are shown in the tables below:

d. Detection limit:
Detection capability studies for each analyte were evaluated based upon
CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
Limit of blank (LoB) studies were performed by testing 4 blank samples. Samples
were tested in replicates of 6 over 3 days, using 3 lots of reagents, 4 samples every
day, for a total of 216 observations (72 results per reagent lot). The LoB value for
each assay was defined as the highest value achieved using blank samples with the
stated probability (i.e. a = 5%). Since the data for all assays were non-gaussian, a

non-parametric approach was applied that estimates the LoB using the calculated
rank position corresponding to the 95th percentile of the distribution of blank values
observed.
Limit of detection (LoD) studies were performed by testing 4 pools of human
samples with analyte concentrations close to the expected detection limit for each
analyte. Samples were tested in replicates of 6 over 3 days, using 3 lots of reagents,
with the 4 human sample pools every day, for a total of 216 observations (72 results
per reagent lot). The LoD was calculated using a pooled SD from the low level
sample results and the input LoB value for the assay, determined as described
above. The LoD value for the assay was defined as the highest resultant value
achieved among the combinations of reagent lots and human pools evaluated, with
the stated probability (i.e. β= 5%).
Limit of quantitation (LoQ) studies were performed using 4 pools of low level
samples with analyte concentrations close to the expected LoQ of the corresponding
assay. Samples were tested in replicates of 4 over 3 days, using 3 lots of reagents, 4
samples every day, for a total of 144 observations (48 results per reagent lot). Ortho
defines LoQ as the lowest concentration with a percent total allowable error < 19%
for carbamazepine; percent total allowable error < 30% for creatinine in serum and
urine, and total allowable error < 0.09 mg/dL for total bilirubin in serum.
The results of the detection capability studies for each assay are presented in the table
below.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP07-A2 guideline, by
using pool of human serum, plasma or urine (samples may have been spiked or
diluted to achieve the appropriate target analyte concentration). Each representative
assay was tested at a minimum of two analyte concentrations in 6 replicates on one
lot of reagent or multiple lots if needed. Bias was evaluated between interferent test
and control samples and compared to the Maximum Allowable Interference (MAI)
for each analyte. The substances that were tested included known chemical
interferents, common chemical substances identified with potential to interfere based
upon risk assessment.

The sponsor included in the labeling the following limitations for creatinine
determinations in serum:
· Creatine: At a creatinine concentration of 1.5 mg/dL (133 µmol/L), creatine
greater than 8 mg/dL (707 µmol/L) will be flagged with a DP code (because
highly elevated creatine concentrations may cause excessive background
density). For unflagged samples, residual bias because of creatine will be less
than 0.15 mg/dL (13 µmol/L). At a creatinine concentration of 14 mg/dL
(1237 µmol/L), creatine greater than 1 mg/dL (88 µmol/L) will be flagged
with a DP code.
· Proline: Patients receiving hyperalimentation fluids containing proline may
show an increase of 0.2 mg/dL (18 µmol/L). Do not collect specimens from
intravenous fluid lines contaminated with hyperalimentation fluid.
· Lidocaine: Patients on long-term lidocaine therapy may show an increase of
up to 1.0 mg/dL (88 µmol/L) due to a metabolite of lidocaine, N-ethyl glycine
(NEG).
Total Bilirubin:
The study was conducted using a minimum of 2 samples with total bilirubin
concentrations of approximately 0.3 and 15 mg/dL. The sponsor defined non-
interference as a bias <0.2 mg/dL (vs. control condition). The compounds and the

The sponsor included in the labeling the following limitations for total bilirubin
determinations:
· Cefotiam (Pansporin) has been reported to show very large positive biases on
TBIL results. This drug is normally cleared through the kidney. Biases will
be largest in specimens from patients with renal insufficiency and may be as
large as 5 mg/dL (86 μmol/L). Because the VITROS BuBc Slide is not
affected by Cefotiam, patients known to be receiving Cefotiam therapy
should be monitored only with the BuBc Slide.
· Drugs and other compounds that are diazo-reactive or that absorb light in the
vicinity of 540 and 460 nm may interfere.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were conducted by testing a minimum of 116 human
serum samples with analyte concentrations across the analytical ranges of
carbamazepine, creatinine and total bilirubin assays on the VITROS XT 7600
Integrated System and the VITROS 5600 Integrated System (predicate device). In
addition, 125 human urine samples were tested for creatinine on the candidate and
predicate test systems. The results of the regression analyses for each of the assays
are summarized below:

b. Matrix comparison:
Based on the sponsor’s risk assessment for adding the VITROS Chemistry Products
CRBM Slides, VITROS Chemistry Products CREA Slides and VITROS Chemistry
Products TBIL Slides to the VITROS 7600 System and the results of the analytical
testing conducted that demonstrated there was no impact on the assays’ performance
characteristics, new matrix comparison studies were not conducted. FDA found this
justification to be acceptable.
The VITROS Chemistry Products CRBM Slides can be used with serum and plasma

this line of product types:
Yes X or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Specimens that are labeled with a barcode will be scanned in automatically when placed
into the Reagent and Sample Manager area or manually using the bar code scanner.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The Sample Handler (SAHA) uses the universal sample tray to house patient sample
containers. Once samples are loaded onto the System, they are advanced into a metering
zone, where a bar code reader scans the bar code labels to identify tray and samples.
5. Calibration:
Calibration is an automatic process: bar-coded calibrators or manually programmed
trays are placed on the system for assay calibration, the calibrators are processed in a
random-access format (bar-coded) or in the order they were defined (manual), and a new
calibration curve is calculated. The new curve is saved on the system and used for
19
