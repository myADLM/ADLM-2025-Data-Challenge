L. Test Principle:
VITROS Chemistry Products Cl- Slides (Potentiometric):
A drop of patient sample and a drop of VITROS Reference Fluid on separate halves of the
slide results in migration of both fluids toward the center of the paper bridge. A stable liquid
junction is formed connecting the reference electrode to the sample indicator electrode.
Each electrode produces an electrical potential in response to the activity of chloride ions
applied to it. The potential difference poised between the two electrodes is proportional to the
chloride concentration in the sample.
VITROS Chemistry Products ECO2 Slides (Enzymatic endpoint):
A drop of patient sample is deposited on the slide and is evenly distributed by the spreading
layer to the underlying layers. The high pH in the spreading layer ensures that essentially all
CO2 in the sample is in the bicarbonate form. Bicarbonate diffuses to the gel layer and is
used to carboxylate phosphoenolpyruvate in the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxylase to form oxalacetate and inorganic phosphate. The final reaction involves the
malate dehydrogenase–catalyzed oxidation of NADH and reduction of oxalacetate to produce

NAD+ and malate. The slide is incubated at 37°C. The concentration of CO2 in the sample is
determined by measuring the absorbance of the unreacted NADH by reflectance
spectrophotometry.
VITROS Chemistry Products GLU Slides (Colorimetric):
A drop of patient sample is deposited on the slide and is evenly distributed by the spreading
layer to the underlying layers. The oxidation of glucose in the sample is catalyzed by glucose
oxidase to form hydrogen peroxide and gluconate. This reaction is followed by an oxidative
coupling catalyzed by peroxidase in the presence of dye precursors to produce a dye. The
intensity of the dye is measured by reflected light.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted following EP05-A3 guideline. The study was

assays. Samples were analyzed using one VITROS XT 7600 Integrated System over
20 days, with 2 runs per day and 2 replicates per specimen (n=80). The results of the
precision study are presented in the tables below:

per reagent lot). The LoB value for each assay was defined as the highest value
achieved using blank samples with the stated probability (i.e. α = 5%). Since the data
for all assays were non-gaussian, a non-parametric approach was applied that
estimates the LoB using the calculated rank position corresponding to the 95th
percentile of the distribution of blank values observed.
Limit of detection (LoD) studies were performed by testing 4 pools of human samples
with analyte concentrations close to the expected detection limit for each analyte.
Samples were tested in replicates of 6 over 3 days, using 3 lots of reagents, for a total
of 216 observations (72 results per reagent lot). The LoD value for the assay is the
highest resultant value achieved among the combinations of reagent lots and human
pools evaluated, with the stated probability (i.e. β= 5%).
Limit of quantitation (LoQ ) studies were performed using 4 pools of low level
samples with analyte concentrations close to the expected LoQ of the corresponding
assay. Samples were tested in replicates of 4 over 3 days, using 3 lots of reagents, for
a total of 144 observations (48 results per reagent lot). Ortho defines LoQ as the
lowest concentration with a percent total allowable error < 8% for chloride (serum);
percent total allowable error 10% for chloride (urine), percent total allowable error <
30% for carbon dioxide, total allowable error < 30% for glucose in serum, urine, and
CSF.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP07-A2 guideline.
Testing on the representative assays included known chemical interferents, common
chemical substances identified with potential to interfere based upon risk assessment.
Testing employed “paired-difference” assessment at a minimum of two analyte
levels, as specified by CLSI EP07-A2 guideline. All samples used in the interference
testing were pools of human serum, plasma, CSF or urine. For all pools, samples may
have been spiked or diluted in order to achieve the appropriate target analyte
concentration and was tested at a minimum of two analyte concentration and bias
between interferent test and control samples was calculated.

· Purines, such as adenine or hypoxanthine, at significantly elevated levels may
cause a negative bias of approximately mmol/L.

The substance that interferes with glucose determinations in serum are summarized in
the table below:

Interferent Bias
concentrations concentrations
Glutathione 61.5 mg/dL 80 mg/dL -7.4 mg/dL
The following limitations are listed in the package insert:
· When using samples with visible hemolysis (Hb >200 mg/dL), there may be a
negative bias due to catalase released from the lysis of red blood cells. On
VITROS Systems capable of performing Sample Indices using the
MicroSensor, the GLU result will be flagged with H (Hemolysis).
· Elevated lipids may limit diffusion of oxygen to the reactants. Dilute grossly
lipemic samples two-fold before analysis.
Glucose – interference testing in urine:
The study was conducted using samples with urine glucose concentrations of
approximately 30 mg/dL and found not to interfere, bias <7 mg/dL. The substances
were also tested at a glucose concentration of approximately 215 mg/dL and found
not to interfere, bias <7% (vs. control condition).
The substances that showed not to interfere in urine are summarized in the following

The following limitations are listed in the package insert:
· Glacial acetic acid at 10 mL/L results in ~4% negative bias. The magnitude of
the bias increases with higher concentrations of glacial acetic acid (60 mL/L).
Do not use urine specimens with acetic acid as a preservative.
· 12N Hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 2.5 mL/dL results in a large negative bias,
potentially resulting in values less than the measuring range. Do not use urine
specimens with HCl as a preservative.
In CSF sample matrix hemoglobin was found not to interfere up to 250 mg/dL at a
glucose concentration of 65 mg/dL (bias less than 5.2 mg/dL).

b. Matrix comparison:
Based on the sponsor’s risk analysis for adding the VITROS Chemistry Products Cl-
Slides, VITROS Chemistry Products ECO2 Slides and VITROS Chemistry Products
GLU Slides to the VITROS XT 7600 Integrated system and the results of the
analytical testing conducted that demonstrated that there was no impact on the assays’
performance characteristics, new matrix comparison studies were not performed. FDA
found this justification to be acceptable.
The sample types are:
The VITROS Chemistry Products Cl- Slides are suitable for use with serum, lithium
heparin plasma, and urine.
VITROS Chemistry Products ECO2 Slides can be used with serum, lithium heparin
and sodium heparin plasma.
The VITROS Chemistry Products GLU Slides are suitable for testing serum, plasma
samples collected in EDTA, lithium heparin, sodium heparin, and sodium
fluoride/potassium oxalate tubes, and also in urine and CSF.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:

* Chloride concentration (mmol/L) x 24-hour volume (L) = mmol/day
**Glucose concentration (mg/dL) x 24-hour volume (dL) = mg/day.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
