L. Test Principle:
The MiniCollect K2E K2EDTA Tubes are plastic, non-evacuated, non-sterile low sample
volume collection devices. The interior of the tube wall is coated with K EDTA which binds
2
calcium ions thus blocking the coagulation cascade. Sample draw volume is 0.25-0.5 ml
collected via capillary (finger or heel stick) using a lancet and filling the tube or venous via
syringe and transferred to the tube.

tube, between-run, as well as between-lot precision testing at one site (University of
Maryland). The collected blood was transferred to a total of eight tubes (five
evaluation tubes from three lots and three control tubes) via syringe. The following
parameters were tested: WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, PLT. For the MiniCollect K2EDTA
tubes, mixed models were fit to estimate the variability within the tube while
controlling for different subjects. Estimates of the SD and %CV were computed for
the evaluation tubes and compared to the acceptance criteria. Further, the relative SD
of the test and control tubes were also compared to see if 1 was included in the
confidence interval.
The Repeatability/Reproducibility evaluations were conducted in accordance with
CLSI EP5-A3 and CLSI GP34-A standards and the results are shown in the tables

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To demonstrate that the evaluation tube (MiniCollect K2E K2EDTA Tube) is
substantially equivalent to the predicate device (BD Microtainer K2EDTA Tube) a
method comparison study was conducted consisting of blood specimens collected
from both adult and pediatric donors using the Coulter DxH 800 (K081930), Sysmex
XE-5000 (K071967), and Cell-Dyn Sapphire (K051215) hematology analyzers.
Capillary, venous and heel stick samples had one measurement for each parameter on
the evaluation tube and on the predicate/control tube. Weighted Deming regression
was performed for each analyte and the percent difference (%CV) and the difference
in values (Abs) were presented.
Outliers were removed using the extreme studentized deviated test where up to 5% of
the paired samples were allowed to be removed if there appeared to be outliers.

b. Matrix comparison:
To demonstrate that there is no significant difference in the test results obtained using
capillary specimens as compared to venous specimens a matrix comparison study was
conducted consisting of blood specimens collected from adult donors only using the
Coulter DxH 800 and Sysmex XE-500 hematology analyzers. Each subject had one
capillary sample measurement and one venous sample measurement from each tube
type for each parameter. The following parameters were tested using venous and
capillary blood specimens: WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, MCV, MCH, MCHC,
Platelets, RDW, Lymphocytes, Neutrophils, Monocytes, Eosinophils, Basophils.
Three clinical sites (Beckman Coulter DxH 800; Sysmex XE-5000; Beckman Coulter
DxH 800/Sysmex XE-5000) participated in the evaluation. For the MiniCollect
K2EDTA Tubes, Deming regression was performed for each analyte to account for
error in both venous and capillary measurement. The estimates and 95% confidence
intervals for the bias are expressed in terms of the percent and absolute difference.
Depending on the parameter, up to three medical decision points were included in the
analysis of the bias. The medical decision points used in the analysis of each
parameter were included as levels in the performance results. Then appropriate
measure was compared to the acceptance criteria

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not Applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not Applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Fill Accuracy Study:
Fill accuracy study was conducted to demonstrate conformity to CLSI GP39-A6
regarding +/- 10% of fill volume accuracy of the MiniCollect tubes. Testing was done
according to standard ISO 6710 Annex A because CLSI GP39-A6 does not define a
testing procedure for fill accuracy testing. When tested in accordance with the
methods as specified, the volume of water should be within ±10 % of the draw
volume. All tested parts fulfilled the draw volume test and have fill accuracy inside
the tolerance limits. All tested MiniCollect tube results were within specifications and
in accordance with requirement of +/-10% fill accuracy according to CLSI GP39-A6.
Transportation Stress Test:
Transport stress test was conducted to demonstrate that there is no significant effect
of temperature and humidity on MiniCollect tubes when the tubes are shipped by
various transport methods internationally and domestically. The samples used in the
clinical study at the U.S. sites were transported by airfreight and truck shipment. The
device was exposed to low temperatures during international and domestic flights in
the plane freight room. The device was also exposed to elevated temperatures during
the summer months (27–34°C) and reflect extreme changes in temperature and
humidity during the various transport methods.
