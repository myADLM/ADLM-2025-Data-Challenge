1. Intended uses:
N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex FLC lambda assays
In-vitro diagnostic reagents for the quantitative determination of free light chains (FLC),
type kappa or type lambda in human serum and EDTA-plasma by means of particle-
enhanced immunonephelometry using the BN Systems. FLC measurements are used as an
aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma (MM) and as an aid in the
diagnosis of amyloidosis (AL) in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings.
The response category assignment of Complete Response for the monitoring of MM, is
reliant upon the combination of clinical history and other tests including protein
electrophoresis, immunofixation and bone marrow, imaging and urine assessments.
2. Indications for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statements:
For prescription use only
Warning: The result of the FLC Kappa or FLC Lambda in a given specimen determined
with assays and/or instrument platforms from different manufacturers can vary due to
differences in assay methods and reagent specificity. The results reported by the
laboratory to the physician must include the identity of the assay used. Values obtained
with different assay methods cannot be used interchangeably. If, in the course of serially
monitoring a patient, the assay method used for determining the FLC Kappa and FLC
Lambda levels is changed, additional sequential testing should be carried out. Prior to
changing assays, the laboratory MUST confirm baseline values for patients being serially
monitored.
4. Special instrument requirements:
BN II (K943997) and BN ProSpec Systems (K001647)
I. Device Description:
The N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex FLC lambda assays are comprised of the following
reagents in liquid form:
N latex FLC reagents: suspension of polysterene particles coated with mouse monoclonal
antibodies to either human FLC Kappa or human FLC Lambda with preservative.
N FLC supplementary reagents: mouse immunoglobulin in buffered solution with

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
L. Test Principle:
The FLC test systems are based upon the principles of particle-enhanced
immunonephelometry. Polystyrene particles coated with monoclonal antibodies to human
free light chains (FLCs), type kappa or lambda, are agglutinated when mixed with samples
containing FLCs. These aggregates scatter a beam of light passed through the sample. The
intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in
the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.

3. Clinical studies:
The performance of the N Latex FLC kappa assay and the N Latex FLC lambda assay as
an aid in monitoring of disease status in multiple myeloma (MM) and light chain multiple
myeloma (LCMM) subjects was determined from a retrospective clincal study. Changes
in FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda levels in serial serum samples from subjects diagnosed
with MM and LCMM during treatment were compared to clinical response categories
based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) as determined by the
clinicians.
The patient inclusion and exclusion criteria were as follows:
Inclusion criteria:
· Confirmed diagnosis of MM or LCMM
· At least four blood collections in intervals of ≥ three weeks
· Informed consent available
· Clinical information of response level available
Exclusion criteria:
5

--- Page 6 ---
· Less than four blood collections
· No informed consent available
· Patients subsequently diagnosed with another disease
A total of 125 (104 MM and 21 LCMM) subjects were enrolled in the study. Among
them, 27 subjects were excluded: 17 subjects had less than four sample draws; four MM
subjects were re-diagnosed to Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia; two subjects had no
informed consent available; and four subjects had no available clinical information about
response level. Therefore, a total 98 subjects (81 IgG, IgA and IgM MM and 17 Kappa
and Lambda LCMM subjects) with a total of 391 serum samples were used in the study
analysis.
Of the 98 subjects, 47 (47%) were male and 51 (52%) were female. The mean age was 65
years and the range was 35 to 92 years. The majority of subjects (n=70, 71%,) were
Caucasian, the remaining subjects included 18 (18%) African American, one (1%) Asian
and nine (9%) Unknown.
A total of 391 draws were collected from 98 subjects. The mean number of draws per
subject was five, ranging from four to seven draws. The duration of the monitoring days
ranged from 88 days to 1338 days.
The information collected for each sample included the following: (a) general
information including patient’s demographic information and date of blood sample
drawn; (b) clinical information including patient’s diagnosis report/medical notes,
treatment initiated, and diagnostic response criteria; c) laboratory data including serum
electrophoresis results, serum/ urine immunofixation electrophoresis, serum FLC Kappa
and FLC Lambda, CRAB (Calcium, Renal Failure, Anemia, Bone lesions) status, and
plasma cell count.
Results:
The performance of the N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex FLC lambda assays as aid in
monitoring MM was evaluated by testing a total of 391 samples from 98 subjects
consisting of 98 baseline values and 293 monitoring observations and comparing to
clinical disease response status.
At each follow-up visit, the percentage change of the Involved FLC Kappa (iFLC Kappa)
or Involved FLC Lambda (iFLC Lambda) was calculated by comparing the test result to
the test result from the previous visit. The monitoring response criteria based on the FLC
results were based on the FLC ratio, % relative change of difference between both FLC
(rd_FLC), M protein level and IFE monocloncal protein detection.
The clinical assessment for each monitoring observation was provided by the attending
physician who was responsible for the corresponding therapy decisions based on therapy
response criteria defined according to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG)
2011/National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in
Oncology on Multiple Myeloma. Clinical status of each monitoring event was
6

--- Page 7 ---
categorized into one of six response categories: Stringent Complete Response (sCR),
Complete Response (CR), Very Good Partial Response (VGPR), Partial Response (PR),
Stable Disease (SD), and Progressive Disease (PD).
Data were analyzed based on the comparison of disease category determined from N
Latex assays to clinical assessement.
Results of N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex FLC lambda assays in combination with
other laboratory results were used to assign a response category and compared to the
clinical assessment according to the table below:
Response Category Response Criteria based on Clinical Assessment
N Latex FLC, SPE, IFE Results based on IMWG
Good Response FLC ratio normal, M protein not sCR
detectable and IFE negative* CR
Moderate Response ≥ 50 to ≥ 90% reduction of VGPR

Stable Disease 50% reduction to 25% increase of SD
rd_dFLC and 50% reduction to 25%
increase of M protein
Progressive Disease ≥ 25% increase of rd_dFLC and PD
≥ 25% increase of M protein AND
increase of d_dFLC*** ≥ 100 mg/L
and increase of M protein
≥ 0.5 g/L
*Applies only to MM population
**rd_dFLC = (dFLC t2 – dFLC t1)/ dFLC t1
***d_dFLC = dFLC t2 – dFLC t1 (with ‘dFLC = iFLC – ni FLC’)
Definitions:
· t1 = time point 1; t2 = time point 2
· rd = relative difference
· iFLC = involved FLC; niFLC = not involved FLC
· Relative change of involved FLC: rd_iFLC = (iFLC t2 – iFLC t1)/
iFLC t1
· Relative change of difference between both FLC: dFLC = iFLC –
niFLC

laboratory tests compared to the clinical assessment is summarized in the following

Discordance results:
The response criteria established by clinicians are often based on multiple factors
besides FLC results, therefore FLC results alone might lead to a different
classification.
The clinical disease reponse categories were condensed into two clinical status
categories: “Progression” and “No-progression”. Subjects with ‘Progression’ consist
of those monitoring events defined as ‘Progressive Disease’. Subjects with ‘No-
Progression’ consist those monitoring events defined as ‘Good Response, Moderate
Response, and Stable Disease Response’ categories. The performance N-Latex FLC
