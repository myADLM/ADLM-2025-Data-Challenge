L. Test Principle:
The Psychemedics Microplate EIA For Fentanyl in Hair consists of (1) a screening
immunoassay and (2) a confirmation test by LC-MS/MS.
The screening immunoassay consists of two parts; a pre-analytical hair treatment procedure
(to remove fentanyl from solid hair matrix to a measurable liquid matrix), and the qualitative
assay. The qualitative assay is an Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) based
upon the competitive binding of fentanyl in the sample and solid-phase fentanyl in the
microplate wells to the assay detection antibody. Sample is added to the microplate well,
followed by primary antibody (monoclonal mouse anti-fentanyl), and then (after washing the
plate) goat anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase conjugate is added. Enzyme substrate is then
added and the plate is read on a microplate reader at 450 nm.
Confirmatory testing:
Confirmation testing for fentanyl and norfentanyl in samples is performed on a 6-12 mg
aliquot of the original hair specimen. The hair is washed with isopropanol, followed by
phosphate buffer. After washing, samples are then spiked with deuterated fentanyl to a
concentration of 1.0 ng/10 mg hair, processed by solid phase extraction and analyzed using
the AB Sciex 6500+MSMS (SN CG21891608) operating in the Positive Multiple Reaction
Mode. To account for variability in drug recovery during solid phase extraction the recovered
concentration of the deuterated internal standards in each sample is used to normalize the
data for that sample.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The screening immunoassay is a qualitative test only; therefore, a linearity evaluation is not
applicable.
Linearity of the LC-MS/MS confirmation method
The linearity of the confirmation method was evaluated by spiking fentanyl and norfentanyl
into negative hair over the range of 0.01 to 7.5 ng/10 mg hair. Thirteen concentrations
within this range were evaluated (0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 1.5, 4.5,
6.0, 7.5 ng/10mg). All levels for fentanyl and norfentanyl demonstrated percent recoveries
within +/- 15% of the expected value.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls and calibrators are prepared as a methanolic solution containing fentanyl /
norfentanyl and are traceable to a commercial fentanyl / norfentanyl source.
Shipping stability: Five hair samples containing fentanyl and norfentanyl were shipped
overnight to another location and returned to the original location by overnight shipping.
Samples were tested by the routine LC-MS/MS procedure both before being shipped and
after returning to Psychemedics. Both analytes were evaluated. Recovery of both was
acceptable after shipping.
Sample storage stability: Five hair samples were stored in the same collection foil and card-
envelope provided with the hair collection kit, following the instructions provided in the
package insert. Samples were tested by LC-MS/MS on day 0 and 28 days later following
storage conditions at 68 – 75 °F (20 – 24 °C). Both fentanyl and norfentanyl were evaluated
and recoveries after storage were found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The screening immunoassay is a qualitative test only; therefore, a detection limit evaluation
is not applicable. See section M.1.a. above for sensitivity around the immunoassay device

Detection Limit of the LC-MS/MS method
The sponsor performed a study to determine the Lower limit of Quantitation (LLOQ) of the
LC-MS/MS assay for fentanyl and norfentanyl.
The LLOQ is the lowest concentration that meets chromatographic and retention time
criteria, and that can be quantitated within 20% of the expected value. The method LLOQ is
0.01 ng/10 mg for fentanyl. The LLOQ is 0.01 ng/10 mg for norfentanyl.

Specificity of the immunoassay screening method
Immunoassay: cross-reactivity with structurally related compounds
The cross-reactivity characteristics of the screening immunoassay was evaluated by spiking
various concentrations of fentanyl into drug-free hair samples and comparing the result to
the cutoff calibrator. The table below lists the percent cross-reactivity and the approximate
concentration of each compound required to produce a response approximately equivalent to
the cutoff concentration of the assay.

Immunoassay: Effect of cosmetic treatments
Hair samples negative for fentanyl and samples positive for fentanyl were treated with the
following cosmetic treatments: permanent wave, relaxer, bleach, dye, and shampoo. After
the treatments, these samples and an aliquot of the same hair samples untreated were
digested for fentanyl analysis and then assayed by the Psychemedics Microplate EIA for
Fentanyl in Hair. The EIA results with and without treatment are compared to detect
interference in the assay or loss of drug due to the treatments. The study included 10
negative samples and 6 fentanyl-positive samples with one brand of each of the particular
product types, and another set of 10 negative samples and 6 positive samples with a second
brand of each of the product types for a total of 32 different combinations of hair and
products. All negative results remained negative and all positive results remained positive
after the treatments.
All of the positive samples were also analyzed by the confirmation procedure for fentanyl
and norfentanyl using the LC-MS/MS method. Each of the samples was measured before
and after the treatment. The percent change of fentanyl as well as the average across the 6
samples for each of the treatments is reported in the tables below.

Specificity of the LC-MS/MS method
LC-MS/MS: Cross-reactivity with structurally related compounds
The cross-reactivity characteristics of the LC-MS/MS confirmation assay were evaluated by
measuring hair samples spiked with fentanyl and norfentanyl at the cutoff of 0.20 ng/10
mg/hair, and also containing the following structurally related compounds at a concentration
of 0.20 ng/10 mg/hair: butyryl fentanyl, valeryl fentanyl, acetyl fentanyl, para-fluorobutyryl
fentanyl, cis-3-methylfentanyl, furanyl fentanyl, carfentanil, butyryl norfentanyl, acetyl
norfentanyl, furanyl norfentanyl, norcarfentanil. All of the samples spiked with the potential
cross-reactant and one of the target drugs at the cutoff produced a concentration within ±
15% of the spiked value of 0.20 ng/10 mg hair. The sponsor concluded that these
compounds did not cross-react or cause interference with the LC-MS/MS assay.
LC-MS/MS: Interference from structurally unrelated compounds
The specificity of the LC-MS/MS confirmation assay with structurally unrelated compounds
was evaluated by measuring samples spiked with fentanyl and norfentanyl at the cutoff of
0.20 ng/10 mg/hair, containing the following compounds at the concentrations listed:
Cotinine (500 ng/10 mg hair), Nicotine (500 ng/10 mg hair), Caffeine (500 ng/10 mg hair),
Ibuprofen (50 ng/10 mg hair), Naproxen (50 ng/10 mg hair), Phentermine (20 ng/10 mg

All of the samples spiked with the potential interfering compounds and each of the target
drugs at the cutoff produced a concentration within ± 15% of the spiked value of 0.20 ng/10
mg/hair. The sponsor concluded that the potentially interfering compounds listed above did
not cross-react or cause interference with the LC-MS/MS assay.
LC-MS/MS: Studies to evaluate environmental contamination
Studies were performed to evaluate environmental contamination. Two different aliquots of
10 different hair specimens, previously shown to be negative for fentanyl, were soaked in
either a water-based solution containing 5 ng fentanyl/mL or a saline-based solution
containing 5 ng fentanyl/mL, resulting in a range of fentanyl on the hair from below the
Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) to 0.0527 ng of fentanyl /10 mg hair, prior to washing. After
washing hair samples according to the instructions in the product insert, no samples
contained an amount of drug above the LOQ of the confirmatory method.
f. Assay cut-off:
Analytical performance of the device around the claimed cutoff is described in
precision section M.1.a. above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Accuracy of the immunoassay screening method
A total of 197 hair specimens were used to compare the results of the Psychemedics
Microplate EIA for Fentanyl in Hair with the LC-MS/MS method. The studies were
comprised of the following hair samples: 138 samples from males, 59 samples from
females; 98 black hair samples, 94 brown hair samples (from light brown to dark
brown), 1 blond hair sample, and 2 grey hair samples, 134 head hair samples, and 63
body hair samples. 97 samples tested positive by the Psychemedics Microplate EIA
for Fentanyl in Hair for fentanyl, and 100 tested negative.
There were no false negative results reported by the Microplate EIA for Fentanyl test.
There were 10 false positives (confirmed by LC-MS/MS to have less than 0.2ng/10
mg cutoff of the EIA). The false positives were caused by the presence of structurally
similar molecules that cross react in the EIA causing a falsely high result. In section
M.1.e. above, the fentanyl immunoassay cross-reacts with butyryl fentanyl, valeryl
fentanyl, furanyl fentanyl, acetyl fentanyl, acryl fentanyl, cyclopropyl fentanyl,
isobutyryl fentanyl, ocfentanil, 4-fluoro-isobutyryl fentanyl. There were an additional
9 samples that were positive for fentanyl but not positive for norfentanyl, these are
interpreted as negative / discordant results. These results are interpreted by the test as
environmental contamination and were falsely positive due to inadequate washing
procedures.

--- Page 15 ---
Recovery study for the LC-MS/MS:
The sponsor conducted a study to evaluate recovery for fentanyl at concentrations of
0.2, 3, and 7.5 ng/10 mg hair. For each combination of drug and concentration level,
ten individual hair samples were prepared and analyzed. The recovery for fentanyl
ranged from 87% to 100% and the recovery for norfentanyl ranged from 92 – 100%.
