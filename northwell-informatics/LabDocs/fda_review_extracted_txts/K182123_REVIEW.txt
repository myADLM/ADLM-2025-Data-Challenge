adulteration/specimen validity tests (SVT) in the dip card format and in the cup format.
The drug screen tests are intended for prescription use only.
The tests provide only a preliminary result. A more specific alternative chemical method
should be used in order to obtain a confirmed presumptive positive result if the donor
doesn’t admit use or anytime required by testing procedures. Gas Chromatography / Mass
Spectrometry (GC/MS), Liquid Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) and their
tandem mass-spectrometer versions are the preferred confirmatory methods. Careful
consideration and judgment should be applied to any drugs of abuse screen test result,
particularly when evaluating preliminary positive results.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
This assay is intended for prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable.
I. Device Description:
The ATTEST Drug Screen Cup and ATTEST Drug Screen Dip Card devices are
immunochromatographic assays that use a lateral flow system for the qualitative detection of
Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Barbiturates, Benzodiazepine, Cannabinoids, Cocaine,
Methadone, Tricyclic antidepressants, Buprenorphine, EDDP, MDMA, Morphine,
Oxycodone, Phencyclidine, Propoxyphene, and 6-Acetylmorphine. The ATTEST Drug
Screen Cup device consists of a cup device and a package insert. The ATTEST Drug Screen
Dip Card device consists of a Dip Card device, a package insert and a urine cup for sample
collection.

L. Test Principle:
Each device employs lateral flow immunochromatographic technology and is based on the
principle of competitive binding. Drugs, if present in concentrations below the cutoff level,
will not saturate the binding sites of the antibody coated particles on the drug specific test
strips. The goat-anti-rabbit IgG antibody-coated particles will then be captured by
immobilized drug-specific conjugate. If the level of drug in the urine specimen is below the
cutoff concentration, the T line appears as a visible burgundy line. If the level of drug in the
urine specimen is above the cutoff, no T line develops.
The control line (C line) serves as an internal quality control. The control line should always

appear as a burgundy-colored band regardless of the presence of the drug, if enough sample
volume has been added to the test and if the sample has correctly migrated up the test strip.
Testing is based on the principle of a competitive immunochemical reaction between a
chemically labeled drug (drug-protein conjugate) and the drug or drug metabolites which
may be present in the urine sample competing for the limited antibody binding sites.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study of the ATTEST Drug Screen Cup and Dip card were evaluated
for Amphetamine (1000 ng/mL cutoff, AMP 1000), Methamphetamine (1000 ng/mL
cutoff, MET 1000), Cocaine (300 ng/mL cutoff, COC 300), Opiates (300 ng/mL
cutoff, OPI 300) and 6-Acetylmorphine devices (10 ng/mL cutoff, 6-AM 10) at three
external testing sites. Samples tested were drug free urine spiked with certified
reference standards to the target concentrations. The test solutions contain the
following drug concentrations: negative, +/-75% cutoff, +/-50% cutoff, +/-25%
cutoff, and +100% cutoff. All test solutions were confirmed by a chemically specific
quantitative method to verify the drug concentrations.
Three operators performed the study using three lots of ATTEST Cup Drug Screen
and three lots of ATTEST Card Drug Screen. Each sample was tested in 20 replicates
for each device format at each of three sites. A total of 180 specimens for each device
format were tested over 10 non-consecutive days. The results are shown in the tables
below. Performance data for Amphetamine (500 ng/mL cutoff), Barbiturates,
Benzodiazepines, Buprenorphine, EDDP, Cocaine (150 ng/mL cutoff), Ecstasy,
Methamphetamine (500 ng/mL cutoff), Marijuana, Methadone, Opiates (2000 ng/mL
cutoff), Oxycodone, Phencyclidine, Propoxyphene, and Tricyclic Antidepressants
was provided in k122809.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device has internal process controls. A colored line appearing in the control
region confirms sufficient sample volume and adequate membrane wicking. Users are
informed that the test is invalid if a line fails to appear in the control region. There are
no external controls supplied with the device.
Device stability has been evaluated through accelerated and real-time studies.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The
manufacturer claims that the devices are stable for 28 months.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity for both the ATTEST Drug Screen Cup and the ATTEST Drug
Screen Dip Card was determined through the testing of contrived solutions made by
spiking certified standards of chemically-related or structurally-similar compounds
into drug free urine. The relative cross-reactivity represents the minimum
concentration necessary to yield a result similar to the cutoff level of the respective
assay. Identical results, provided in the table below, were obtained with the two
devices. Performance data for Amphetamine (500 ng/mL cutoff), Barbiturates,
Benzodiazepines, Buprenorphine, EDDP, Cocaine (150 ng/mL cutoff), Ecstasy,
Methamphetamine (500 ng/mL cutoff), Marijuana, Methadone, Opiates (2000 ng/mL
cutoff), Oxycodone, Phencyclidine, Propoxyphene, and Tricyclic Antidepressants

The potential interference from compounds chemically dissimilar to target drugs, and
known endogenous agents was also determined for both the ATTEST Drug Screen
Cup and the ATTEST Drug Screen Dip Card. Testing of compounds and endogenous
agents was performed by spiking the substances noted in the table below into pooled
urine containing target drugs at near-cutoff concentrations. Identical results, provided
in the table below, were obtained with the two devices. Unless otherwise indicated,
substances were tested for potential interference at a concentration of 100 µg/mL.
Performance data for Amphetamine (500 ng/mL cutoff), Barbiturates,
Benzodiazepines, Buprenorphine, EDDP, Cocaine (150 ng/mL cutoff), Ecstasy,

Interference from pH and specific gravity variation was also evaluated for both the
ATTEST Drug Screen Cup and the ATTEST Drug Screen Dip Card using pooled
urine specimens containing target drugs at near-cutoff concentrations. The results
demonstrated that pH levels of 4 to 9 and specific gravity levels of 1.003 to 1.030 do
not affect the results of the assays for either of the devices. Performance data for
Amphetamine (500 ng/mL cutoff), Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, Buprenorphine,
EDDP, Cocaine (150 ng/mL cutoff), Ecstasy, Methamphetamine (500 ng/mL cutoff),
Marijuana, Methadone, Opiates (2000 ng/mL cutoff), Oxycodone, Phencyclidine,
Propoxyphene, and Tricyclic Antidepressants was provided in k122809.
f. Assay cut-off:
For characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed
cutoff concentration, please refer to section M.1.a., above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was conducted for the ATTEST Drug Screen Cup and
ATTEST Drug Screen Dip card, using clinical urine specimens quantitated for the
target drugs of abuse by chemically specific quantitative methods (e.g. LC-MS).
Identical results, provided in the table below, were obtained with the two devices.
Performance data for Amphetamine (500 ng/mL cutoff), Barbiturates,
Benzodiazepines, Buprenorphine, EDDP, Cocaine (150 ng/mL cutoff), Ecstasy,
Methamphetamine (500 ng/mL cutoff), Marijuana, Methadone, Opiates (2000 ng/mL
cutoff), Oxycodone, Phencyclidine, Propoxyphene, and Tricyclic Antidepressants
was provided in k122809.
