L. Test Principle:
The Dimension Vista® High-Sensitivity Troponin I TNIH assay is a homogeneous, sandwich
chemiluminescent immunoassay based on LOCI technology. The LOCI reagents include two
synthetic bead reagents and two biotinylated anti-cardiac troponin I monoclonal antibody
fragments. The first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains
photosensitizer dye. The second bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a third anti-
cardiac troponin I monoclonal antibody and contains chemiluminescent dye. The sample is
incubated with Chemibeads and biotinylated antibodies to form bead-cardiac troponin I-
biotinylated antibody sandwiches. Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to form bead-
pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen
from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent
reaction. The resulting signal is measured at 612 nm and is a direct function of the cardiac
troponin I concentration in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor provided results from precision studies across multiple reagent lots.
Native pooled plasma samples and one quality control sample (QC) were tested on
one instrument two times a day, each with two replicates, for 20 days, for a total of 80
measurements per sample. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the
data following recommendations in EP05-A3. This was repeated for 3 reagent lots
using the plasma samples. Results from one representative lot of the three lots tested,
are described in the table below. The within-lab precision estimate described in the
table is a total of within-run variability, within-day, run-to-run variability, and day-to-
day variability.

The sponsor also evaluated site to site reproducibility following the recommendations
in CLSI EP05-A3. Imprecision was evaluated using seven samples spanning the
measurement range of the assay and comprising of native pooled lithium heparin
patient samples across three sites using one lot of reagents. Testing was performed
over five days, with two samples a day and three replicates per sample. The
reproducibility estimate is a total of within-run variability, within-day variability, run-
to-run variability, day-to-day variability, and site to site variability. The sample at the
upper end of the assay measuring range was prepared by spiking normal human
plasma with human troponin complex to desired test levels, as noted in the table
below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated following the recommendations in the CLSI Guideline EP06-
A with 16 lithium heparin plasma samples ranging in concentrations from 1.8 pg/mL
to >25,000 pg/mL. The high samples and the low samples were native and the
intermediate samples were prepared by mixing high and low concentration samples.
At least five replicates were measured for each sample, and the mean of these
replicates was used to calculate the reported results. Deviations from linearity within
the claimed range were never observed to be greater than 10%.
The measuring range is 3-25000 pg/mL with the upper end of the measuring range
being defined by the upper linear range of the assay. See detection limits in M. item
d. below for information supporting the lower end of the measuring range.
Hook Effect
The sponsor demonstrated that there is no hook effect with the assay up to 1,223,723
pg/mL.
Dilution Recovery
The sponsor provided dilution studies which supported the measurement of samples
above the measurement range diluted by up to a factor of five.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor’s traceability scheme was reviewed and found acceptable. The assay is
traceable to a commercially available troponin assay.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) Test Protocol
The LoB was determined as described in the CLSI Guideline EP17-A2. Testing was
performed using three lots of reagents, each on one instrument. 60 determinations
were obtained by testing five samples with no analyte (the zero level calibrator
material) four times a day for three days across three reagent lots. LoB was calculated
non-parametrically. The largest estimate across all reagent lot-instrument
combinations tested was 1.0 pg/mL.
Limit of Detection (LoD) Test Protocol
The LoD was determined following the recommendations in the CLSI Guideline
EP17-A2. Testing was performed using three reagent lots. For the three lots tested,
6

--- Page 7 ---
seven to ten native low analyte lithium heparin plasma samples were tested every day,
respectively, with four replicates for each test, for 3 days.
The nonparametric approach described in EP17-A2 was followed to determine the
LoD. The largest estimate across all reagent lot-instrument combinations tested was
1.8 pg/mL.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) Protocol
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined as the analyte level with a within-
lab CV of less than or equal to 20.0% following the recommendations in the CLSI
EP17-A2 Guideline. Testing was completed two times a day (n=2) for at least 20 days
for a total of 80 replicates with eight to 11 native lithium heparin plasma pools
measured on one instrument using three reagent lots. For each reagent lot-instrument
combination, the within-laboratory precision for each sample, expressed as %CV,
was plotted against the mean concentration obtained for each sample. LoQ was
determined by this precision profile as the concentration where the %CV was less
than 20%. The largest estimate across all reagent lot-instrument combinations tested
was 2.4 pg/mL.
The sponsor claims an LoB of 1.0 pg/mL, and LoD of 2.0 pg/mL, and an LoQ of 3.0
pg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous interference studies were performed following the recommendations in
CLSI EP07-A2. Two sample pools were tested. One sample pool had 20-60 pg/mL
cTnI and the second sample pool had 700-2000 pg/mL cTnI. These sample pools
were spiked with potential interferents. Test results from samples spiked with the
potential interferent were compared to test results from the control samples lacking
the potential interferent. At the tested concentrations, these compounds caused <10%
interference.

healthy subjects after a single dose of 300 mg biotin.
The following limitations are included in the labeling:
Testing specimens from renal dysfunction patients taking biotin may lead to false
negative results. Therefore, do not use this device in patients with renal impairment
(eGFR<60), unless it is confirmed that the patient is not taking biotin.
Patients taking more than 20 mg/day of biotin may have falsely negative results, and
should not use this test. There have been reports of multiple sclerosis patients taking
biotin doses exceeding 20 mg/day. Therefore, do not use this device in patients with
multiple sclerosis, unless it is confirmed that the patient is not taking more than 20
mg/day of biotin.
Protein gamma globulin at 6 g/dL increases the troponin result in plasma samples at
approximately 40 pg/mL [ng/L] and 1000 pg/mL [ng/L] of troponin. Protein gamma
globulin at 2.5 g/dL demonstrates less than 10% change in results when testing
plasma samples at the concentrations stated above.
Dextran 40 at 60 g/L increases the troponin result in plasma at 35.1 pg/mL [ng/L] and
1337.4 pg/mL [ng/L] by 22% and 4% respectively. Dextran 40 at 15 g/L and 45 g/L
demonstrates less than 10% change in results when testing plasma samples at the
concentrations stated above.
Patient samples may contain cardiac troponin-specific autoantibodies that could react
in immunoassays to give depressed results. A test result that is inconsistent with the
clinical picture and patient history should be interpreted with caution.
Samples from patients receiving preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies for
therapy or diagnosis may contain human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA). Such
samples may show either falsely elevated or falsely depressed values. This assay has
been designed to minimize interference from heterophilic antibodies. Nevertheless,
complete elimination of this interference from all patient specimens cannot be
guaranteed. A test result that is inconsistent with the clinical picture and patient
history should be interpreted with caution.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
A clinical study was performed to evaluate the clinical performance of the device at
the different clinical cut-offs (see section 5, Expected values/Reference range,
below). A multicenter prospective study evaluated 2498 patients from emergency
departments presenting with chest pain or equivalent symptoms suggestive of acute
coronary syndromes. Final diagnoses were adjudicated by an independent panel of
expert physicians using criteria consistent with the 2007 Universal Definition of
Myocardial Infarction (MI). Serial samples were collected from patients presenting to
the emergency department. The number of patients adjudicated with an MI was 13%
(325/2498). The sample collection times were at 0 – 1.5 hours (from time since
presentation) and at the following timepoint relative to the time from presentation: 1.5
to 2.5 hours, 2.5 to 3.5 hours, 3.5 to 4.5 hours, 4.5 to 6 hours, 6 to 9 hours, 9 to 24
hours, and greater than 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department.
Investigators and adjudicators were blinded to the proposed device’s results.
Adjudicators were also blinded to site diagnoses. All results presented below were
based on the adjudicated diagnoses. Clinical performance was estimated at overall
(male and female combined) and male- and female-specific 99th percentile upper
reference limit (URL) cut-offs, calculated as described in Section 5, Expected
values/Reference range, below. The results are summarized below.

The following statements about cut-offs are included in the labeling:
Using the higher male-specific 99th percentile instead of the overall 99th
percentile of 58.9 pg/mL (ng/L) may result in a higher proportion of negative test
results for males that are MI. For males that are MI, data analyzed using the male-
specific cut-off versus the overall cutoff increased the false-negative rate by up to
3.8%.
Using the lower female-specific 99th percentile instead of the overall 99th percentile
of 58.9 pg/mL (ng/L) may result in a higher proportion of positive test results for
females that are non-MI. Taking into consideration the lower bound of the 95%
confidence interval, in the worst-case scenario (samples drawn at ≥4.5-<6 hours after
presentation), up to 68% of positive test results for females may be non-MI.
b. Clinical specificity:
See clinical sensitivity section, M.3.a., above.
4. Clinical cut-off:
The cut-offs for this assay were determined based on the 99th percentile upper reference
limit in apparently healthy adults. Please see section 5, Expected values/Reference range,
below for the determination of the clinical cut-offs.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor conducted a multicenter prospective study to establish the 99th percentile in
a population of apparently healthy adults.
Lithium-heparin plasma specimens were collected from apparently healthy adults with no
known diseases of the cardiovascular system or other serious acute or chronic diseases or
infections from the United States who ranged in age from 22–91 years of age.
Plasma samples from 2021 subjects were tested in singlicate. The 99th percentile value
for results in apparently healthy subjects was calculated. The 99th percentile values were
determined using the non-parametric empirical univariate distribution function. The
results are summarized below:
Population N 99th percentile 95% CI pg/mL
URL pg/mL (ng/L) (ng/L)
Overall 2021 58.9 42.2-82.
Females 1017 53.7 37.7-115.7
Males 1004 78.5 41.4-114.5
Two female subjects had troponin values of approximately 400 pg/mL and 5000 pg/mL
and were considered to be outliers. These results were not included in the 99th percentile
determination.
Overall (combination cut-off for all males and females): 58.9 pg/mL
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
