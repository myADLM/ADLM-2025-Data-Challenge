H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The ARK Tramadol Assay is an immunoassay intended for the qualitative and/or
semiquantitative determination of tramadol in human urine at a cutoff concentration of
100 ng/mL. The assay is intended for use in laboratories with automated clinical
chemistry analyzers. This in vitro diagnostic device is for prescription use only.
The semiquantitative mode is for the purpose of (1) enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method, such as
1

--- Page 2 ---
Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid Chromatography/tandem
Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), or (2) permitting laboratories to establish quality
control procedures.
The ARK Tramadol Assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more
specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed positive
analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid
Chromatography/tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory
method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any
drug test result, particularly when the preliminary test result is positive.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Beckman Coulter AU 680 chemistry analyzer
I. Device Description:

L. Test Principle:
The ARK Tramadol Assay is based on competition between drug in the specimen and drug
labeled with recombinant glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (tramadol-rG6PDH), for
antibody binding sites. When tramadol-rG6PDH is bound by antibody, enzyme activity
decreases. In the presence of free tramadol from the specimen, the free tramadol competes
for antibody binding to tramadol-rG6PDH, resulting in increased enzyme activity that is
proportional to the free tramadol concentration. Active tramadol-rG6PDH converts
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH in the presence of glucose-6-phosphate

Endogenous G6PDH does not interfere because the coenzyme NAD functions only with the
bacterial enzyme used in the assay.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using CLSI EP05-A3 as a guideline. Drug-free,
negative human urine was supplemented with tramadol (0.0 to 200.0 ng/mL).
Each level was assayed in quadruplicate twice a day for 20 days (N=160) in both
qualitative and semiquantitative modes. Results are summarized in the tables
below.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity
The cross-reactivity of the following metabolites of tramadol was evaluated by
spiking these compounds into drug-free, negative human urine to determine the
minimum concentration that would yield a positive result approximately equivalent to
the 100 ng/mL tramadol cutoff. These concentrations were used to determine the
percent cross-reactivity according to the formula:
% Cross-reactivity = (Cutoff concentration / Lowest concentration of cross-reactant
causing a positive result) X 100

One percent (1%) w/v of boric acid was added into urine spiked with tramadol
(± 25% of the cutoff concentration) and tested with the ARK Tramadol Assay
in both qualitative and semiquantitative modes. Results are provided in the table

pH and Specific Gravity
For potential interference from the pH of urine, device performance in the qualitative
and semi-quantitative modes was tested using a range of urine pH values (3.0, 4.0,
5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0 and 11.0). All test samples were prepared in drug free

urine containing Tramadol at ± 25% of the cutoff (75 ng/mL and 125 ng/mL tramadol
concentrations). No positive or negative interference was observed at urine pH
values ranging from 3.0 to 11.0 for each test mode.
For potential interference from the specific gravity of urine, device performance in
the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes was tested using a range of urine specific
gravity values (1.000, 1.002, 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025 and 1.030). All test
samples were prepared in drug free urine containing Tramadol at ± 25% of the cutoff
(75 ng/mL and 125 ng/mL tramadol concentrations). No positive or negative
interference was observed at urine specific gravity values ranging from 1.000 to 1.030
for each test mode.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 115 unaltered clinical human urine specimens that are not individually
identifiable were analyzed for tramadol with the ARK Tramadol Assay in both
qualitative and semiquantitative modes and the results were compared to LC-MS/MS.
The LC-MS/MS confirmatory method was performed by a licensed reference
laboratory. Results are summarized in the tables below.

b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. Urine is the only claimed matrix for the candidate device.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clincal Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The sponsor provided published, peer-reviewed articles and reports which, in addition
to data provided by the sponsor, supported that for doses of tramadol anticipated in
the intended use population, a 100 ng/mL cutoff would detect the analyte for
approximately 3-4 days (60-100 hours).
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Not applicable.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
