H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The hemochroma PLUS System is for the quantitative determination of hemoglobin
concentration in non-anticoagulated capillary (finger-stick) whole blood or venous whole
blood (K -EDTA, K -EDTA, sodium citrate, lithium heparin, or sodium heparin). The
2 3
testing system is designed for point-of-care settings, hospitals, and medical lab facilities.
Estimation of hematocrit, as a function, is only for normal hemoglobin values, 12.0 to
18.0 g/dL (120 to 180 g/dL) and in patients ≥ 6 months old.
The hemochroma PLUS Controls are intended for use as quality control material to
assure the validity and performance of the hemochroma PLUS system in measuring the
human hemoglobin concentration.
The hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes are only used with hemochroma PLUS Analyzer.
The hemochroma PLUS System is for in vitro diagnostic only.
The hemochroma PLUS Analyzer calculates the test result automatically and displays
hemoglobin concentration in terms of g/dL.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
hemochroma Plus Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The hemochroma PLUS System consists of a hemochroma PLUS Analyzer, single-use
hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes, hemochroma PLUS ID Chip, optical System Check
Microcuvette and hemochroma PLUS Controls.
1. hemochroma PLUS Analyzer
The hemochroma PLUS Analyzer is a battery powered, hand-held device used to
2

--- Page 3 ---
measure total hemoglobin concentration in human whole blood. Whole blood may be
collected by fingerstick (capillary) or venipuncture and analyzed without pre-processing.
The hemochroma PLUS Analyzer uses hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes with dual ports
where the user applies samples either through capillary action or direct volume pipetting.
The hemochroma PLUS Analyzer determines hemoglobin concentration in whole blood
samples using a dual wavelength photo-absorption method and measures the degree of
light absorption with a spectrophotometer. The optical distance between the hemochroma
PLUS Microcuvette walls is fixed and permits photometric determination of hemoglobin
in undiluted blood samples. The computed end result is displayed on a LCD display and
can be printed on an external printer (optional).
2. hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette
The hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes are specially designed for use with the
hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. The microcuvettes function as measuring devices
specifically holding 15 μL of blood and are inserted into the hemochroma PLUS
Analyzer by placing it into the cuvette holder. The optical distance between the
hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette walls is fixed and by measuring the degree of light
absorption permits photometric determination of the hemoglobin in undiluted blood
samples.
3. hemochroma PLUS ID Chip
The hemochroma PLUS ID chip contains encoded memory with the calibration
data/information of the Microcuvette lot. With the ID chip inserted in the designated port,
the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer reads and utilizes the calibration data regarding the lot
under consideration and applies appropriate correction to the conversion formula while
computing the test result.
4. hemochroma PLUS Optical System Check Microcuvette
hemochroma PLUS Optical System Check Microcuvette is designed for use with the
hemochroma PLUS Analyzer only. The Optical System Check Microcuvette is a special
glass filter used to measure the degree of light absorption with the spectrophotometric
method. If the result is between 11.7–12.3 g/dL, the optic system is working properly
according to specification.
5. hemochroma PLUS Controls
The hemochroma PLUS Controls: Level 1 (Low), Level 2 (Middle), and Level 3 (High),
are external quality controls designed for use with hemochroma PLUS Analyzer only.

L. Test Principle:
The hemochroma PLUS Analyzer utilizes a dual wavelength LED light source by which the
hemoglobin absorbance is detected and converted into an electrical signal. The signal is
directly proportional to the amount of hemoglobin present in the sample. The concentration
of hemoglobin is calculated based on a pre-programmed calibration. The hemochroma PLUS
Microcuvette is specifically designed for the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. Approximately
15 μL of capillary or venous blood is taken up by capillary action using the tip of the
hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette or by direct volume pipetting of the sample. The blood
filled Microcuvette is inserted onto the microcuvette holder, and the hemochroma PLUS
Analyzer measures the degree of light absorption with a spectrophotometer. The absorbance
of the light from the hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette is converted into an electrical signal.
The optical distance between the hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette walls is fixed and permits

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes ________ or No ___X____
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ________ or No ___X____
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes __X___ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function for the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. Samples
are applied directly to the microcuvettes as they are collected. The end user must develop
a manual system to identify patients that are tested with the hemochroma PLUS
Analyzer.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Capillary or venous whole blood is directly applied from the finger or blood tube (using a
disposable pipette) to the Microcuvette. Wipe off excess blood from the surface of the
microcuvette using a piece of soft gauze. The blood-filled Microcuvette is then inserted
into the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer.
5. Calibration:
The hemochroma PLUS ID chip contains encoded memory with the calibration
data/information of the Microcuvette lot. With the ID chip inserted in the designated port,
the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer reads and utilizes the calibration data regarding the lot
under consideration and applies appropriate correction to the conversion formula while
computing the test result.

6. Quality Control:
The hemochroma PLUS Controls (low, middle, and high hemoglobin) are intended for
use as quality control material to assure the validity and performance of the hemochroma
PLUS System in measuring the human hemoglobin concentration. The hemochroma
PLUS Controls should be assayed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and
following the local and state guidelines. If controls do not perform as expected, the test
results should not be used.
The hemochroma PLUS Optical System Check is used to assure the performance of the
Optic System of the hemochroma PLUS. The Optical System Check Microcuvette is a
special glass filter used to measure the degree of light absorption with the
spectrophotometric method. If the result is between 11.7–12.3 g/dL, the optic system is
working properly according to specification.
