VI Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indication for use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
VeriClear Digital Early Result Pregnancy Test is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for
qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine, as an aid in early
detection of pregnancy, in some cases as early as five (5) days before the expected period, i.e., as
early as six (6) days before the day of the missed period.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
VeriClear Digital Early Result Pregnancy Test is intended for over-the-counter (OTC) use.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
None
VII Device Description:
A Device Description:
The VeriClear Digital hCG Early Result Pregnancy Test is a qualitative lateral flow
immunoassay for the detection of hCG. Each device is provided in a sealed pouch with
instructions for use and a desiccant package to control the moisture during storage. The device
may be used in midstream or dip mode (with a user-supplied cup) and consists of a plastic
housed test stick containing an immunochromatographic strip and electronic and optical
components along with a microprocessor and specific algorithms to digitally display test results.
The VeriClear Digital Early Result Pregnancy Test is powered by a battery and the test results
are displayed on the device’s liquid crystal display (LCD) as either “YES+” (for a positive
result), “NO-” (for a negative result) or “?” (for an invalid result) on the display.
B Principle of Operation:
The VeriClear Digital hCG Early Result Pregnancy Test is a sandwich immunoassay employing
mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for hCG, which are immobilized on the membrane as test
line, and goat anti-mouse IgG immobilized on the membrane as control line. After the urine
specimen is applied to the device, the hCG present in the specimen will react with a mouse anti-
hCG monoclonal antibody conjugate. The conjugate complex migrates along the membrane
towards the test and control zones. A digital component integral with the chromatographic strip
reads and displays the result of the immunochemical reaction on an LCD (Liquid Crystal
Display) screen of the device. The test result is shown on the LCD screen of the device. A
"YES+" test result indicates that the pregnancy hormone (hCG) was detected, a "NO-" test result
indicates that no hCG was detected, and a “?” result indicates an invalid test.

A precision study was performed using human urine samples spiked with hCG, traceable to
the 4th WHO International Standard to obtain samples with hCG concentrations of 0
mIU/mL, 3 mIU/mL, 5 mIU/mL, 8.5 mIU/mL, 10 mIU/mL, 25 mIU/mL, 50 mIU/mL, and

Effect of urine pH and Specific Gravity:
Negative urine samples and positive (10 mIU/mL hCG) urine samples were adjusted
to pH values of 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 and 9.0 and then tested using the candidate
device. The positive and negative hCG results were not affected by urine pH ranges
between 4.0 and 9.0.
Negative urine samples and positive (10 mIU/mL hCG) urine samples were adjusted
to Specific Gravity values of 1.003, 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020 and 1.030 and then
tested using the candidate device. The positive and negative hCG results were not
affected by urine Specific Gravity ranges between 1.003 and 1.030.
Effect of hCG β-core fragment:
Negative urine samples (0 and 5 mIU/mL hCG) and positive urine samples (10, 25 and
20,000 mIU/mL hCG) were spiked with hCG β-core fragment at concentrations of
51,000 pmol/L, 102,000 pmol/L, 204,000 pmol/L and 408,000 pmol/L and tested
using 2 lots of the candidate device. All samples yielded correct results with hCG β-
core fragment concentrations up to 408,000 pmol/L.
High dose hook effect study:
Negative urine samples were spiked with hCG at concentrations up to 450,000 mIU/mL,
and tested in 2 replicates per lot using two lots of devices for each format. The results
demonstrated that no hook effect was observed at hCG concentrations up to 450,000
mIU/mL.

D Detection of hCG in Early Pregnancy Clinical Samples
A total of 616 urine samples were collected from 56 different women (25 - 43 years old) who
planned to become pregnant. The women were followed throughout their conception cycles
with urine collected from day -9 to day +1 of their expected period. The VeriClear Digital
Early Result Pregnancy Test device detected hCG in 69% of samples from five days before
the expected menstrual period and 100% of samples from one day before the expected
menstrual period. The early pregnancy detection results are summarized below:

A lay user study was performed at an intended use site with a total of 216 women with diverse
educational and professional backgrounds, ages 18 years and older. 108 lay users tested the
simulated midstream method and 108 lay users tested the dip method of the device. Lay users
were only provided with the package insert prior to performing the study. Lay user results

Besides testing their own urine samples, lay users also tested 4 spiked urine samples around the
cut-off level, at concentrations of 3.0, 7.0, 8.5 and 10 mIU/mL hCG. A total of 216 samples were
tested by using the VeriClear Digital Early Result Pregnancy Test at each hCG level. Among the
216 devices tested at each hCG level, 108 were tested via the simulated midstream mode, while
the other 108 were tested via the dip mode. Lay user results compared to professional user results

All the lay users participated in the study were given a questionnaire to rate how well they
understand the instruction in the package insert. A Flesch-Kincaid reading analysis was
performed on the OTC package insert and the score demonstrated a reading Grade Level of
7.9. The result of the questionnaire reflected that the consumers found the test easy to use and
that they did not have trouble understanding the labeling or interpreting results.
F Specificity Study to Determine False-Positive Result Rate
A study was performed to determine the incidence of false positive test results from VeriClear
Digital Early Result Pregnancy Test among non-pregnant women in three age groups: 15–41
years of age (pre-menopausal), 42–55 years of age (peri-menopausal) and >55 year of age
(post- menopausal). A total of 320 subjects provided urine samples including 100 from pre-
menopausal patients, 111 from peri-menopausal patients, and 109 from post-menopausal
patients. All 320 urine samples were tested with three lots of VeriClear Digital Early Result
Pregnancy Test devices. No positive results were observed in any of the age groups.
