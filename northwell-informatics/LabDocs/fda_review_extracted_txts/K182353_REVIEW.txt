Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000 are identical instruments except for sample throughput. The
Phadia 2500 consists of one process module (two process lines), whereas Phadia 5000 consists
of two process modules (2 x 2 process lines). Instrument operation is handled by onboard
Instrument Software (ISW). Data output is administered by Information Data Manager (IDM).
All steps of an assay are performed within a single process line. Thus, study protocols used for
Phadia 2500 are also valid for Phadia 5000.

L. Test Principle:
EliA tests are fluorescence immunoassays for the detection and measurement of human
antibodies based on EliA solid-phase components, which contain specific antigens for the
antibodies to be measured.
The EliA wells are coated with human recombinant centromere protein B, human recombinant
RNP (RNP70, A, C) or with human recombinant RNP (70 kDa) protein. If present in the
patient's specimen, antibodies to these proteins bind to their specific antigen. After washing
away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgG antibodies (EliA
IgG Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-

bound conjugate is washed away, and the bound complex is incubated with a Development
Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured.
The higher the value of fluorescent signal, the higher the amount of antibody bound and
detected in the sample tested. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is
compared directly to the response for calibrators.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
All results presented below met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria for
all analytical performance studies.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To determine the precision of the assay, the variability was assessed in a study with a
total of 21 runs (three instruments total and seven runs per instrument). The study was
performed with a single run/day over a period of seven days. Each sample was tested
in four replicates/run giving in total 84 replicates per sample (3 instruments × 7 runs x
4 replicates = 84). The data were calculated against the calibration curve from Day 1.
Five native patient serum samples were tested: one negative, one or two in the
equivocal range, and two or three positive specimens. All samples were tested on all
instruments. The results are summarized in the tables below:

to 240 EliA U/mL.
The following statements are included in the package inserts: “Please note that
concentration values between LoD and LoQ may show a higher uncertainty.” and
“Please note that due to differing binding characteristics of the antibodies in patient
samples, not all sera can be diluted linearly within the measuring range.”
The hook effect was previously reviewed in K082759 (EliA CENP and EliA U1RNP)
and K083117 (EliA RNP70).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Same as in the predicate devices. Refer to K082759 (EliA CENP and EliA U1RNP)
and K083117 (EliA RNP70).
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) studies were performed on a
Phadia 2500 instrument. LoB was measured in two assay runs with each run including
a blank sample in 33 replicates, giving a total of 66 replicates. LoD was measured in
two assay runs by testing three low level serum samples in 11 replicates per sample in
a run, giving a total of 66 replicates. The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was based on 66
determinations and a precision targetof 20%. The results are summarized in the table
below:

e. Analytical specificity:
i) Interference:
Interference by endogenous substances was previously reviewed in K082759
(EliA CENP and EliA U1RNP) and K083117 (EliA RNP70).
ii) Cross-reactivity:
Cross-reactivity was previously reviewed in K082759 (EliA CENP and EliA
U1RNP) and K083117 (EliA RNP70).
iii) Carry-over:
The Phadia 2500/5000 instruments use disposable tips for pipetting samples and a
separate pipette for the conjugate, therefore carry-over from samples to conjugate
was not evaluated.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-offs are the same as in the predicate devices (refer to K082759 and
K083117) and are summarized in the tables below:
EliA CENP:

7–10 EliA U/mL Equivocal

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
See 2c. Instrument Comparison below.
b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison between serum and plasma was reviewed in K141375K082759
(EliA CENP and EliA U1RNP) and K083117 (EliA RNP70).
c. Instrument comparison:
The purpose of this study was to evaluate conformance and show comparability of
EliA CENP, EliA U1RNP, and EliA RNP70 on the Phadia 250 instrument versus the
Phadia 2500/5000 instrument.
1) EliA CENP:
A total of 100 samples (75 positive, 17 negative and 8 equivocal) were run in
singlicate on one Phadia 250 instrument and three Phadia 2500/5000 instruments
for comparison. Only samples inside the measuring range were included in the
calculations. Results were analyzed by Passing-Bablok regression and
summarized below:

No sample switched from negative to positive or vice versa. Five samples in the
negative range were tested equivocal. One sample in the positive range was tested
equivocal and three samples in the equivocal range were tested positive.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
Clinical performance values were reviewed in K082759 and K083117.
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. is not applicable):
Not Applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Same as assay cut-off.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The frequency distribution for CENP, U1RNP and RNP70 antibodies was
investigated in a group of apparently healthy subjects (N=400) equally distributed by
age and gender, using sera from a Caucasian population obtained from a blood bank.
None of test samples was within the equivocal or the positive range in the three EliA
assays. The test results are given in the table below and all measurements are shown
in EliA U/mL:

N. Proposed Labelling:
The labelling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
