L. Test Principle:
The albumin test is based on affinity binding of albumin to a sulfonephthalein dye at a
constant pH. The development of pale green to aqua blue indicates the presence of albumin.
The creatinine test is based on the peroxidase-like activity of a copper creatinine complex
that catalyzes the reaction of diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide and 3,3’,5,5’-
tetramethylbenzidine. The resulting color ranges from orange through green to blue.
The ACR | LAB Urine Analysis Test System scans and analyzes the test strip using a mobile
device running the smartphone application.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:

All urine samples evaluated by this device should be tested for blood using a
urinalysis device that tests for blood. If testing indicates the presence of blood equal
to or greater than 80 erythrocytes/microliter ( ≥2+), the sample should not be tested
with this assay.
Urine samples with visible levels of color interferents (e.g., riboflavin, ascorbic acid)
should not be tested with the device.
Specific gravity (SG)
Urine samples spiked with albumin (10 mg/L, 30 mg/L, 150 mg/L) or creatinine (10
mg/dL, 50 mg/dL, 300 mg/dL) were adjusted to specific gravities of 1.000, 1.005,
1.015, 1.020, 1.025, 1.030, 1.035, and 1.040. No interference from SG was detected
on abumin or creatinine measurements in the examined range.
pH
Urine samples spiked with albumin (10 mg/L, 30 mg/L, 150 mg/L) or creatinine (10
mg/dL, 50 mg/dL, 300 mg/dL) were adjusted to pH 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 8.0, and 9.0. pH of
10 showed interference at the 30 mg/L albumin block, and generated falsely increased
results of +1 block. None of the other pH levels had an interfering effect at any other
concentration of albumin or creatinine.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The following statements regarding expected values are provided in the ACR | LAB
Urine Analysis Test System user manual:
Albumin: Normally, albumin is present in urine at concentrations < 20 mg/L1. Results of
20-200 mg/L may indicate microalbuminuria. It is associated with early-stage kidney
disease when a small amount of Albumin, also called Microalbumin, is consistently
present in urine. Clinical albuminuria is indicated by results of > 200 mg/L. These levels
can be predictive of albumin excretion rates of 30-300 mg/24 hours and > 300 mg/24
hours, respectively2-3. Exercise, acute illness and fever, and urinary tract infections may
temporarily elevate urinary albumin excretions.
Creatinine: Creatinine concentrations of 10-300 mg/dL are normally present in urine.
Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (microalbumin/Creatinine): Albumin is normally
present in urine at concentrations of < 30 mg/g. Microalbuminuria is indicated at a ratio
result of 30 - 300 mg/g (moderately increased) and clinical albuminuria at a ratio of > 300
mg/g (severely increased)4.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Carryover study: Test strips were held in both the "up" (with the creatinine on top) and
13

--- Page 14 ---
"down" (with the albumin on top) positions for 0 (control), 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120
seconds after being dipped in solutions. The "up" experiment used a high-positive
creatinine solution (300 mg/dL) and a negative albumin solution. The "down" experiment
used a high-positive albumin solution (150 mg/L) with a negative creatinine solution. The
experiment consisted of 240 measurements (6 timings x 2 test strips lots x 5 replicates x 2
operating systems x 2 configurations ("up" / "down") = 240 results). Though none of
these configurations demonstrated any impact, labeling directs the user to place the test
strips on the Color-Board after dipping it in the urine to prevent run-off from flowing
from one patch into another.
2. Dipping study: Test strips were dipped in samples containing negative, low positive, and
high positive concentrations (measured as 10, 30, and 150 mg/L albumin, respectively
and 10, 50, and 300 mg/dL creatinine, respectively). Samples were measured for four
different time durations to test the impact of various dipping times on the ACR | LAB's
ability to perform accurate measurements: 1 second (control), 2 seconds, 5 seconds, and
10 seconds. Wetting time was held constant at 0 seconds and assay time was held
constant at 60 seconds. The experiment consisted of 80 measurements (4 timings x 2 test
strip lots x 5 replicates x 2 operating systems = 80 results). For creatinine, none of the
various dipping times impacted the accuracy of the device. For albumin, at times 5- and
10-seconds there was an increase in false positive results. The user manual and in-app
instructions direct the professional user to dip the ACR Reagent Strip for 1-second, and
state that increasing the dipping time longer than 5 seconds can cause falsely increased
results for albumin.
3. Wetting (“Blotting”) study: This experiment tested different "blotting" times, i.e. the
tester dipped the test strips and then waited a specific amount of time before blotting the
test strips and scanning it with the ACR | LAB device. Samples containing negative, low
positive, and high positive concentrations (measured as 10, 30, and 150 mg/L albumin,
respectively and 10, 50, and 300 mg/dL creatinine, respectively) were measured. There
were six different waiting times: 0 seconds (control), 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 20 seconds,
40 seconds, and 60 seconds. Dipping time was held constant at 1 second and assay time
was held constant at 60 seconds. The experiment consisted of 60 measurements per
sample (6 timings x 2 test strip lots x 5 replicates x 1 iPhone). For creatinine, none of the
various dipping times impacted the accuracy of the device. For albumin, waiting 60-
seconds to blot the strip resulted in false positive results. The labeling and the in-app
instructions direct the user to wipe the strip on the edge of the urine cup and then
immediately absorb it on a paper towel for 1 second to remove any excess urine after
dipping. The labeling also includes a warning that waiting longer than 60 seconds before
blotting the strip can cause falsely increased results for albumin.
4. Assay time study: This experiment tested how different assay times impact the ACR |
LAB's ability to measure accurate results. Test strips were dipped and then immediately
blotted, per the device's instructions. The user then waited a predetermined amount of
time before scanning the test strips: 60 seconds (control), 80 seconds, 100 seconds, and
120 seconds. Dipping time was held constant at 1 second and wetting time was held
constant at 0 seconds. Samples containing negative, low positive, and high positive
14

--- Page 15 ---
concentrations (measured as 10, 30, and 150 mg/L albumin, respectively and 10, 50, and
300 mg/dL creatinine, respectively) were measured. . The experiment consisted of 40
measurements per sample (4 timings x 2 test strip lots x 5 replicates x 1 iPhone). None of
the assay time durations had any impact on the ACR | LAB's ability to accurately
measure albumin or creatinine. Labeling and in-app instructions direct the user to wait
for 60 seconds and then scan the test strip and Color-Board.
5. Illumination study: The accuracy of the subject device was tested under ten simulated
lighting conditions (fluorescent 6000K, fluorescent 2700K, compact fluorescent lamp
6000K, compact fluorescent lamp 6500K, compact fluorescent lamp 2700K, LED 6000K,
LED 6500K, incandescent, halogen, CW LED). Two operators used one iPhone 7 (iOS
12.0) to test 2 spiked urine samples (10 mg/L or 150 mg/L albumin and 10 mg/dL or 300
mg/dL creatinine) with 2 strip lots and 3 replicates per lot or 5 printed test strip
configurations (with creatinine at 10, 50, 100, 200, and 300 mg/dL and albumin at 10, 30,
80, and 150 mg/L) at 4 replicates per lot. All results were reported as an exact match
with expected results.
6. Boundary study: The accuracy of the subject device was tested under 5 boundary
conditions (i.e., different distances, angles, and extreme lighting conditions). One iPhone
7 (iOS 12.0) was used to test 2 spiked urine samples (10 mg/L or 150 mg/L albumin and
10 mg/dL or 300 mg/dL creatinine) with 2 strip lots and 3 replicates per lot or 5 printed
test strip configurations (with creatinine at 10, 50, 100, 200, and 300 mg/dL and albumin
at 10, 30, 80, and 150 mg/L) at 5 replicates per lot. All results were reported as an exact
match with expected results.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
