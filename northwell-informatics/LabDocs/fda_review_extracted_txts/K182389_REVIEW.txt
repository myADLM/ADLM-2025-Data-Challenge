510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION MEMORANDUM
A. 510(k) Number:
K182389
B. Purpose for Submission:
Expand Intended Use to include pediatric subjects under the age of 2 years old.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Sysmex America Inc., Sysmex® XN-L Automated Hematology Analyzer
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
The Sysmex XN-L Automated Hematology Analyzer (hereafter, the XN-L analyzer)
classifies and enumerates the following parameters in whole blood: WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT,
MCV, MCH, MCHC, PLT, NEUT%/#, LYMPH%/#, MONO%/#, EO%/#, BASO%/#,
IG%/#, RDW-CV, RDW-SD, MPV, RET%/#, IRF, RET-He and has a Body Fluid mode for
body fluids. The Body Fluid mode enumerates the WBC-BF, RBC-BF, MN%/#, PMN%/#,
and TC-BF# parameters in cerebrospinal (CSF), peritoneal, pleural and synovial fluids.
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The XN-L analyzer is a quantitative multi-parameter automated differential cell counter
that classifies and enumerates whole blood and body fluid parameters by means of
electrical impedance, laser light scattering, and fluorescent labeling. Cell counts and
parameters are performed on whole blood samples collected in K EDTA or K EDTA
2 3
anticoagulant, body fluids (peritoneal, pleural and synovial) collected in K EDTA
2
anticoagulant and CSF collected without anticoagulant. The instrument consists of two
principal units: (1) the Main Unit which will aspirate, dilute, mix, and analyze whole
blood and body fluid samples and (2) the Pneumatic Unit which supplies pressure and
vacuum to the analyzer.
The XN-L analyzer has an external monitor with touch screen capability that is used to
operate the instrument and process data from the Main Unit. The monitor also allows for
operator interfacing with the instrument by use of a panel keyboard.
2. Principles of Operation:
The XN-L analyzer analyzes samples using the following methods: DC Sheath Flow
Detection method, Flow Cytometry method using a semiconductor laser, and SLS
(cyanide-free sodium lauryl sulfate) hemoglobin method. Particle characterization and
identification is based on detection of forward scatter, fluorescence, and adaptive cluster
analysis. The XN-L analyzer automatically classifies cells from whole blood and body
1

fluids and carries out all processes automatically from aspiration of the sample to result
output.
3. Modes of Operation:
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ________ or No ____X____
4. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification input is manual (by operator) or by barcode reader.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
There are two modes of sample introduction: (1) Sampler Mode; (2) Manual Mode. In the
Sampler Mode the operator loads the sample tubes into a rack, which is then
automatically transported and analyzed by the instrument. This mode automatically
mixes, aspirates, and analyzes samples without removing their caps. The Sampler Mode
is used for processing of whole blood samples. In the Manual Mode, there are two sample
tube holders: (1) Normal sample tube holder; (2) Micro collection tube holder. In this
mode the operator loads and mixes the samples tubes individually by hand. The samples
in the Manual Mode can be analyzed with the cap on or off. The Manual Mode is used
for processing whole blood and body fluid samples.
6. Calibration:
The XN CAL calibrator (K160585) is used for calibration of the WBC, RBC, HGB,
HCT, PLT and RET parameters. XN CAL is used for the calibration and calibration
verification of Sysmex XN series (XN-10, XN-11, XN-20, XN-21, XN-L) analyzers.
Calibration is performed as needed (e.g., when QC data is fluctuating) to ensure accuracy
of the system.
7. Quality Control:
The XN-L CHECK (K160586) is used as quality control (three levels) for Sysmex XN-L
analyzers. XN-L CHECK™ is an in-vitro diagnostic product that contains the following:
stabilized red blood cell component(s), stabilized white blood cell component(s), and
stabilized platelet component(s) in a preservative medium.
XN CHECK (K160590) is used as quality control (three levels) for Sysmex XN series
(XN-10, XN-11, XN-20, XN-21, XN-L) analyzers. XN CHECK is an in-vitro diagnostic
product that contains the following: stabilized red blood cell component(s), stabilized
white blood cell component(s), stabilized platelet component(s), and stabilized nucleated
red blood cell component(s) in a preservative medium.

ii. Method comparison - ≤ 2 years of age:
Whole Blood Studies (excluding reticulocyte parameters - RET, IRF, Ret-He):
A total of 52 pediatric samples under the age of 2 years old were collected across
three clinical pediatric sites. The residual specimens were collected in K EDTA
2
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. All samples were tested within 8
hours of collection. Samples were analyzed on both the XN-10 analyzer and the
XN-L in singlet by the labeled procedures within 2 hours of each other.
Deming regression analyses were used to estimate the parameters of the regression
model (slope, intercept, 95% confidence intervals (CI) and correlation coefficient).
The 95% CI and estimates of the bias/difference were determined for each
parameter. All results were within the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

were tested within 8 hours of collection. Samples were analyzed on both the XN-10
analyzer and the XN-L in singlet by the labeled procedures within 2 hours of each
other.
Deming regression analyses were used to estimate the parameters of the regression
model (slope, intercept, 95% confidence intervals (CI) and correlation coefficient).
The 95% CI and estimates of the bias/difference were determined for each
parameter. All results were within the pre-defined acceptance criteria.
