I. Device Description:
1. Overview:
The ASI Automated RPR Test for Syphilis performed on the ASI Evolution is an
automated nontreponemal flocculation test for the detection of reagin antibodies in human
serum and plasma. Reagin antibodies, if present in human serum or plasma, bind to the
carbon RPR test antigen which is composed of complexed cardiolipin, lecithin, and
cholesterol particles in the presence of activated charcoal. Flocculation of the antibody-
antigen complex and coagglutination with charcoal particles allows visualization of an
agglutionation pattern that is distinguishable from non-reactive test samples.
The ASI Evolution instrument provides full automation of the sample and reagent handling
steps of the test procuedure, and objective interpretation of test results via a high-resolution
internal CCD camera and an embedded agglutination pattern recognition software. The ASI
Evolution reports a qualitative test result (reactive or non-reactive) for each microtiter well
and semi-quantitative endpoint titers of serially diluted samples.
Performance data supporting the qualitative claim for the ASI Automated RPR Test for
Syphilis run on the ASI Evolution was previously submitted and reviewed by FDA under
K173376. Detailed descriptions of the analytical and clinical study designs and test results
which were conducted to support the qualitative claim are available in the K173376
decision summary document. Data presented in the sections below are limited to the studies
that were required to demonstrate that the ASI Auotmated RPR Test for Syphilis run on the
ASI Evolution can accurately determine semi-quantiative reagin antibody endpoint titers.
2. Materials Provided:
The ASI Automated RPR Test for Syphilis includes the following reagents:

macroscopic nontreponemal flocculation test that detects reagin antibodies in human
serum or plasma samples. The test kit is intended to be used with the ASI Evolution
system.
The ASI Evolution is an integrated digital particle analyzer designed to automate the sample and
reagent handling steps of the test procedure and objectively interpret the test results of the ASI
Automated RPR Test for Syphilis. The result is analyzed through an image processing algorithm
from images taken with an internal CCD camera. The camera first takes high quality images of
each well in the microtiter plates using light reflectance. The image is then analyzed by software
developed with an optical recognition feature that identifies each well boundary to ensure it is in
the correct position, and interprets the agglutination pattern to determine the sample result.
To complete the ASI Automated RPR Test for Syphilis the user must perform the following tasks:
• Load sample tubes into the sample rack
• Load the sample rack into the unit
• Refill the prime bottle with deionized water
• Place the reagent and diluent in their respective positions in the permanent rack
• Load and unload 48-well microtiter plates.
To complete the ASI Autotmated RPR Test for Syphilis the analyzer automates the following
steps:
• Aspirate and dispense sample fluid and carbon RPR antigen
• Perform mixing of the reaction
• Time each procedural step appropriately
• Capture and record images of each completed test
• Process and store data of the test result image
• Report and record the qualitative and numerical results of each test.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Analytical studies supporting the qualitative detection of reagin antibodies in human
plasma and serum by the ASI Automated RPR Test for Syphilis performed on the ASI
Evolution were previously submitted and reviewed under K173376. Details pertaining to
the study protocols and resulting data are available in the K173376 decision summary
document. In addition to the previously conducted studies, validation testing to support the
semi-quantitative claim for the determination of reagin antibody endpoint titers in human
serum and plasma was performed. A description of the study protocol and a summary of
the test results are provided below.
Endpoint Titer Validation
A randomized and blinded panel of 10 human serum samples with known reagin antibody
endpoint titers, as determined by the ASI RPR Card Test for Syphilis on the ASiManager-
AT, was tested with the ASI Automated RPR Test for Syphilis on the ASI Evolution using

--- Page 7 ---
the semi-quantitative test procedure. The reactive samples had titers ranging from 1:1 to
1:256. Each sample panel member was tested a minimum of 80 times, in-house, on at least
five different days by one operator using a single ASI Evolution instrument. To meet the
acceptance criteria, all non-reactive samples were required to yield non-reactive test results,
while all reactive samples were required to yield test results within one dilution above or
below the known titer. The results of the semi-quantitative analysis are shown below.

ASI Evolution
2. System Description
The ASI Evolution instrument system is an integrated digital particle analyzer designed to
objectively interpret certain slide agglutination tests manufactured by Arlington Scientific,
Inc. (ASI). The system is capable of fully automating the sample and reagent handling
steps of test procedures as well as digital acquisition and interpretation of agglutination
patterns. This system design removes assay subjectivity, reduces errors, enables the review
of past data, and speeds up the overall test procedure.
3. Software
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types: YES X or NO _
a. Level of Concern
Moderate
b. Software Description
The software for the ASI Evolution instrument analyzes agglutination tests, which are
interpreted through image processing algorithms from images taken with a CCD
camera. The image results are passed to an integrated PC and software to provide an
easy to use application for reviewing and distributing results.
The ASI Evolution software algorithm determines a “Reactive” or “Non-reactive”
result based on the following criteria:
· If the numerical number is less than or equal to 50 the result is “Non-reactive.”
· If the numerical number is greater than or equal to 51, the test is “Reactive.”
The “Reactive” or “Non-reactive” outputs of the software determine the qualitative
assay result. When running the semi-quantitative titer protocol, the software uses the
same cutoffs described above to distinguish between a “Reactive” and “Non-reactive”
sample well. The endpoint titer value is equivalent to the highest dilution at which the
serially diluted sample produces a “Reactive” test result.
c. Specimen Identification
Barcode labeled patient samples can be imported with the use of a hand-held barcode
scanner.
