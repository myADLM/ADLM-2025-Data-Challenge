D Special Instrument Requirements:
GlucoLeader Enhance Blood Glucose Meter.
VII Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The GlucoLeader Enhance Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to quantitatively
measure the glucose concentration in fresh capillary whole blood. The GlucoLeader Enhance
Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the following: GlucoLeader Enhance Blood
Glucose Meter; Lancets and lancing device; GlucoLeader Enhance Blood Glucose Test Strips;
GlucoLeader Enhance Glucose Control Solutions (L1: low glucose level, L2: high glucose level)
and GlucoLeader Enhance Check Strip. GlucoLeader Enhance Blood Glucose Test Strips and
GlucoLeader Enhance Glucose Control Solutions are not included in the kit package and should
be purchased separately.
B Principle of Operation:
The GlucoLeader Enhance Blood Glucose Monitoring System measures glucose using an
amperometric detection method. The reaction of glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH) and an
electron mediator in the GlucoLeader Enhance test strip with glucose in the whole blood sample
from the fingertip produces an electrical current that is proportional to the amount of glucose in
the sample. The meter measures the current and converts it to the corresponding glucose
concentration, calibrated to plasma reference, which is displayed by the meter.

2. Linearity:
Linearity was evaluated using 13 levels of venous whole blood glucose concentrations (9.2,
23.4, 40.8, 63.8, 85.8, 119.0, 179.0, 237.0, 281.0 350.0, 454.0, 538.0 and 609.0 mg/dL) as
determined by the comparator method YSI 2300. Each glucose level was measured in
replicates of 20 using 2 glucose meters and 3 lots of test strips, and the values from the
GlucoLeader Enhance meter were compared to the values obtained from the comparator
method, YSI 2300. Linear regression analysis of the results yielded the following:
Test strip lot 1: y = 0.9836 x + 2.2189 R2 = 0.9972
Test strip lot 2: y = 0.9814 x + 3.5638 R2 = 0.9968
Test strip lot 3: y = 1.0061 x + 1.4702 R2 = 0.9966
The results of the linearity study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range
of 10- 600 mg/dL. If a sample is less than 10 mg/dL glucose, the result is flagged by the
meter as “Lo”. If a sample exceeds 600 mg/dL glucose, the result is flagged by the meter as
“Hi”. The “Lo” and “Hi” functions were validated and demonstrated to function as intended.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
To assess potential interferences, a study was conducted using venous whole blood samples
adjusted to the following glucose levels as measured by the comparator method, YSI 2300:
50-70, 110-130 and 225-270 mg/dL. Each of these samples was divided into a test pool and a
control pool, with each of the potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances
added to the test pool. The study used 3 lots of test strips and 10 meters, for a total of 30
replicates per test sample. The difference between test sample and control sample meter
results was calculated. The table below shows the highest concentration of substance tested at
which no significant interference (as defined by the sponsor as ± 10 mg/dL for glucose
concentrations < 100 mg/dL and ± 10% for glucose concentrations > 100 mg/dL) was
observed:

The sponsor has included the following in the labeling (user manual):
• Do not use this device while taking acetaminophen or acetaminophen-containing drugs
(such as Tylenol, certain cold and flu remedies or certain prescription drugs). You may
receive incorrect meter results if you have recently taken any acetaminophen.
• If you have a disease or condition that elevated your blood uric acid level (> 12 mg/dL),
such as gout, your blood glucose results may not be reliable. If you are unsure, then ask
your doctor.
• If you are taking high doses of vitamin C (ascorbic acid in your blood concentration > 3
mg/dL), your blood glucose results using this meter may not be reliable.
• If you are taking high doses of Tolazamide (blood concentration > 4.7 mg/dL), your
blood glucose results using this meter may not be reliable.
4. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The GlucoLeader Enhance Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to the NIST
(SRM) 917A. A method comparison was performed using the candidate device and YSI 2300

Accuracy at extreme glucose values:
To further assess the performance of the GlucoLeader Enhance Test System at the extreme
upper and lower ends of the claimed measuring range, the sponsor altered 100 capillary
whole blood samples, by spiking or allowing samples to glycolyse, to achieve glucose
concentrations below 80 mg/dL (50 samples; 9 – 75 mg/dL according to YSI 2300) and
above 250 mg/dL (50 samples; 262 - 604 mg/dL according to YSI 2300). Samples were
compared the comparator method, YSI 2300. The results for one representative lot are
summarized below:

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1) Hematocrit Study:
The GlucoLeader Enhance Blood Glucose Meter System was assessed at 10%, 15%, 20%,
25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65% and 70% hematocrit levels, and at 5
glucose concentrations (30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250 and 251-400 mg/dL). Each
sample was tested in replicates of 10 using 5 meters and 3 lots of test strips, for a total of 30
replicates per sample. The values were compared with the glucose measurements obtained
from YSI 2300 comparator method. The % bias of the GlucoLeader Enhance Blood Glucose
Meter System relative to YSI 2300 demonstrated adequate performance to support the
claimed hematocrit range of 10-70%.
2) Altitude study:
To assess the effect of altitude, venous whole blood samples adjusted to 5 glucose
concentrations covering the measuring range (39, 85, 179, 311 and 529 mg/dL) were tested
at sea level (7 feet) and at an elevation of 10,355 feet in replicates of 5, using 4 GlucoLeader
Enhance Blood Glucose Meters and 1 lot of test strips, for a total of 20 replicates per
samples). Values measured by the candidate device were compared to the comparator
method YSI 2300. The results support the claim that the GlucoLeader Enhance Blood
Glucose Monitoring System can be operated at altitudes of up to 10,000 ft.
3) Operating conditions (temperature, humidity):
The GlucoLeader Enhance Blood Glucose Monitoring System was tested at different
temperature and humidity conditions to assess the effect of operation environment on the
meter’s performance. Temperatures ranging from 46.4°F – 111.2°F (8-44°C) and relative
humidity from 10% to 90% were tested. Meter results were compared to the YSI 2300

comparator analyzer. Four temperature and humidity combinations were tested including
low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low
humidity and high temperature/high humidity. Each of 4 venous whole blood glucose
levels (20-50; 111-150; 251-400 and 401-600 mg/dL) were tested in replicates of 5 by 2
meters, for a total of 10 replicates per sample. Values measured by the GlucoLeader
Enhance Blood Glucose Monitoring System were compared to the comparator method YSI
2300 analyzer. The study results support the operating condition claim of 46.4-111.2°F (8-
44°C) and 10-90% RH.
4) Sample volume study:
To verify the test strip minimum sample volume requirement (0.8 μL), venous whole blood
samples with glucose concentrations levels the following levels were used: 50-65 mg/dL,
100-120 mg/dL and 200-250 mg/dL. Sample volumes of 0.45, 0.50, 0.60, 0.70, and 0.80
μL were tested using 3 lots of test strips for a total of 9 measurements per sample volume
per glucose level. Values obtained with the candidate device were compared to values
obtained using the comparator method (YSI 2300). Results support the claimed minimum
sample volume of 0.8 µL. When the sample volume is lower than 0.80 μL the meter does
not provide a result and displays an error code, therefore the sample detection feature
functions appropriately when the sample volume is insufficient.
5) Intermittent sampling, sample perturbation and testing with used test strips:
Intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, and testing with used test strips testing was
completed by the sponsor. The testing performed demonstrated that the GlucoLeader
Enhance Blood Glucose Monitoring System is robust to intermittent sampling, sample
perturbation, and that an error message is returned to the user if a used test strip is inserted
into the meter.
6) EMC
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing had been performed and the system was found
to be compliant.
7) Cleaning and disinfection robustness evaluation (Infection control studies)
The device is intended for a single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed on the materials the comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing
laboratory, demonstrating removal of the HBsAg antigen with the chosen disinfectant,
Clorox Germicidal Wipes (EPA Registration Number 67619-12). Robustness studies were
also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or
external materials of the meter. The robustness studies were designed to simulate cleaning
and disinfection procedures 10 times a day for 5 years (a total of 18,250 cycles of cleaning
and disinfection). Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated
cleaning and disinfection procedures.
8) Test strip lot release criteria
The test strip lot release protocols and criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
