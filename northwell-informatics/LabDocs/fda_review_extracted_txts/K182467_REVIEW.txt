VII Device Description:
A Device Description:
The Simplexa GBS Direct assay is an in vitro diagnostic, real-time PCR amplification test for the
direct, qualitative detection of Group B Streptococcus DNA in vaginal/rectal swab specimens
from antepartum women that have been incubated for 18-24 hours in Lim enrichment broth. The
assay is performed on the LIAISON MDX instrument which is controlled by an external
computer equipped with LIAISON MDX Studio Software.
The assay kit comprises frozen PCR mixture containing primers and probes to detect a conserved
region of the Group B Streptococcus genome and an Internal Control sequence and which is
designed to monitor reagent and system integrity.
The Simplexa GBS Direct assay is performed by manually pipetting PCR reagents and test
samples into disposables called DADs (Direct Amplification Discs) that comprise eight segments
or wedges, each of which may be used to test a separate specimen or control. After sealing the
foil on each wedge, the DAD is loaded into the LIAISON MDX instrument and the run is
initiated. The system uses a combination of centrifugal force and laser-controlled valves to
combine metered aliquots of the unextracted samples and PCR reagents in the assay chamber of
each wedge. Amplification, fluorescence-based detection and result interpretation occur
automatically.
B Principle of Operation:
The Simplexa GBS Direct assay uses real-time PCR amplification with fluorescently-labeled
probes to detect a conserved region of the S. agalactiae cfb gene in Lim broth enrichment
cultures of vaginal/rectal swabs obtained from pregnant women.
Vaginal/rectal swab specimens are cultured for 18-24 hours in Lim broth after which a sample of
the medium is transferred to one wedge of a DAD (Direct Amplification Disc) to which the
operator also adds an aliquot of the PCR reagents via a separate port. After sealing the DAD and
loading the LIAISON MDX instrument, the sample and PCR mixture are combined for
automated amplification, detection and result interpretation. Results are displayed on the
computer screen as “GBS Detected”, GBS Not Detected” or “Invalid” (due to failure of the
Internal Control or inadequate sample volume) and may be printed.

X Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
Analytical Studies to characterize the performance of the Simplexa GBS Direct assay were
conducted using Lim broth that was inoculated with clinical vaginal/rectal swab matrix, incubated for
18-24 hours and screened as GBS-negative. Samples for testing were prepared by mixing an aliquot
of the vaginal/rectal swab culture medium with enumerated stock suspensions of S. agalactiae.
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility
The reproducibility of the Simplexa GBS Direct assay between laboratories was evaluated in a
study performed by two operators at each of three sites over a period of five days using a panel of
contrived samples and Positive/Negative Controls. On each day of testing each operator tested
three replicates of each panel member (5 days X 3 sites X 2 operators X 3 replicates = 90
replicates per panel member). The results of the study are summarized in Table 1. The Simplexa
GBS Direct assay exhibited acceptable reproducibility within and between sites/instruments, days
and operators at target levels close to the Limit of Detection (LoD).

Microbial Interference
To evaluate the potential for interference with the Simplexa GBS Direct assay from
microbial flora that may be present in vaginal/rectal swab specimens, testing was performed
with GBS positive samples in the presence of each of the organisms and viruses that were in
the Cross-reactivity Study (Table 3), and at the same concentrations. Each species was tested
in Lim broth-enriched vaginal/rectal matrix in the presence of two strains of GBS (ATCC
BAA-22 and ATCC BAA-1138) at 2X LoD (1.6 x 105and 6 x 104 CFU/mL, respectively).
Testing under each condition was initially performed in triplicate and additional replicates
were evaluated in the event of a failure (i.e., a false negative result).
No false negative results were observed in the presence of any of the potentially interfering
organisms or viruses with GBS strain ATCC BAA-22. However, with GBS strain ATCC
BAA-1138, at least one false negative result was obtained on initial testing with each of the
species listed in Table 5. The potential for interference by these species with the detection of
GBS at low target levels is noted in the Limitations section of the device labeling.

(Table 6). Each substance was tested in Lim broth enriched vaginal/rectal swab matrix in the
presence of two strains of GBS (ATCC BAA-22 and ATCC BAA-1183) at 2X LoD (1.6 x 105
and 6 x 104 CFU/mL, respectively). A minimum of three replicates were tested under each

condition. If interference was observed, additional testing was performed at lower concentrations
of the substance to determine at what concentration the adverse effect on assay performance was
alleviated.
False negative and/or Invalid results were observed with one or both strains of GBS with fecal
fat, meconium, seminal fluid, stool, Gaviscon, Nexium, mesalazine, barium sulfate and the non-
steroidal inflammatory drug, Naproxen. Although the potential for interference by these
substances is noted in the device labeling, the risk to patients is considered low because of the
diluting effect of the Lim broth culture medium on the contents of a vaginal/rectal swab and the
high target levels present in GBS positive Lim broth cultures.

different concentrations two strains of S. agalactiae at levels ranging from 2 to 50X LoD.
The samples were held at 2-8°C for different periods prior to testing. At each inoculum
concentration, there was a decrease in Ct values over time. The results of the study support
the stability of enriched Lim broth cultures of vaginal/rectal swabs for up to 7 days at 2-8°C.
Internal Control
The Simplexa GBS Direct reaction mix includes an Internal Control that is amplified with a
different pair of PCR primers than the GBS target and which is detected in a separate optical
channel. The Internal Control is designed to monitor for reagent and process integrity.
External Controls
Clinical Study: Positive and Negative External Controls were tested on each LIAISON MDX
instrument on each day that patient specimens were evaluated during the prospective Clinical
Study (Decision Summary Section X.C(1)). The Simplexa GBS Direct Positive Control was
used as the Positive External Control. Uninoculated Lim broth was used as the Negative
External Control. A total of 68 pairs of Positive and Negative External Controls were tested
during the study, all of which (100%) produced the expected results.
Lot-to-Lot Precision: The lot-to-lot precision of the Simplexa GBS Direct Positive Control
was evaluated in a study conducted over a period of three days with a single LIAISON MDX
instrument and a single lot of Simplexa GBS Direct reaction mixture. On each day of testing,
two replicates of each lot of Positive Control were tested twice in different runs (3 days X 2
replicates X 3 lots X 2 runs = 36 replicates). Negative Controls were tested daily to monitor
for contamination. All qualitative test results were as expected (Table 7) and the Simplexa
GBS Direct Positive Control was shown to exhibit acceptable precision between lots.

6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Detection
The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the Simplexa GBS Direct assay was established by testing
enumerated stocks of two strains of S. agalactiae that were diluted in Lim broth-enriched
vaginal/rectal swab matrix. For each strain, results from a total of 32 valid assay replicates
were obtained at each of eight target concentrations. The study was performed using two lots
of Simplexa GBS Direct reagents and four LIAISON MDX instruments. The LoD was
defined as the lowest concentration at which ≥95% of replicates produced a positive result.
The LoD for ATCC BAA-22 (serotype III) was 80,000 CFU/mL and that for ATCC BAA-
1138 (serotype Ia) was 30,000 CFU/mL. These results are acceptable.

Analytical Reactivity/Inclusivity
The inclusivity of the Simplexa GBS Direct assay was evaluated by testing 18 different
strains of S. agalactiae in addition to those included in the LoD Study (Table 8). Each strain
was tested in triplicate in Lim broth cultured vaginal/rectal swab matrix at 110,000 CFU/mL
(2X the average LoD for strains ATCC BAA-22 and ATCC BAA-1138). All the replicates of
each of strain produced positive results. These results are acceptable.

Bioinformatic Analysis
Bioinformatic analysis using Nucleotide-Nucleotide BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search
Tool) showed that the region of the cfb gene targeted by the Simplexa GBS Direct primers
and probe is well conserved between strains, with no evidence of mismatches that are
predicted to affect the efficiency detection.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Samples tested with the Simplexa GBS Direct assay are dispositioned as Positive, Negative
or Invalid based on the comparison of Cycle Threshold (Ct) values observed in the optical
channels for GBS and the Internal Control targets to previously determined cut-offs. The Ct
cut-offs were established during development of the assay and validated in the Clinical Study
described in Decision Summary Section X.C(1).
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
Not applicable.
9. Carry-Over:
A study to assess the potential for carry-over/cross-contamination was conducted with the
Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct assay (K120413). The study design was determined to be
acceptable and no evidence of contamination was observed. Because of the similarities in
format and assay workflow with this previously cleared device, no additional contamination
studies were conducted with the Simplexa GBS Direct assay.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
The performance of the Simplexa GBS Direct assay was evaluated in a prospective Clinical
Study that was conducted at four (4) sites in the U.S. using de-identified enriched Lim broth
cultures of vaginal/rectal swabs from pregnant women that were left over from routine
diagnostic testing for GBS. A total of 804 enriched Lim broth cultures were initially enrolled,
of which 372 were excluded from the analysis of performance for the following protocol
violations: the duration of incubation of the Lim broth was not recorded (n = 239, including
all those obtained from Site #3); incubation of the Lim broth culture exceeded 24 hours (n =
115); the sample was a duplicate from a previously enrolled subject (n = 12); testing was
performed with the incorrect Simplexa Assay Definition software (n = 4); no Simplexa test
result was obtained (n = 1); the subject was male (n = 1). Lim broth cultures of vaginal/rectal
swabs from a total of 432 antepartum women at 35-37 weeks of gestation were therefore
included in the performance evaluation. The subjects ranged from 18 to 45 years of age.
Following 18-24 hour incubation of the Lim enrichment broth at each site, separate aliquots
were prepared for testing with the Simplexa GBS Direct assay and for shipment to a central
laboratory for reference culture and organism identification (i.e., subculture to non-selective
blood agar and selective CNA (colistin-nalidixic acid) agar, followed by Gram staining of
suspected colonies of S. agalactiae, catalase testing (S. agalactiae is catalase negative) and
latex agglutination using GBS-specific reagents). Agar plates were incubated for a minimum
of 48 hours before being discarded as GBS negative. The results of the study are summarized
in Tables 9 and 10.
No Invalid results were reported among the 432 samples included in the analysis of
performance for the Simplexa GBS Direct assay (Invalid Rate 0% (0/432)).
These results are acceptable.
