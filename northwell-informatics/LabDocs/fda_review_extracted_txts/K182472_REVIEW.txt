M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Studies to determine precision and reproducibility of the Cepheid Xpert GBS LB
Control Panel were performed on the GeneXpert Instrument using the Cepheid Xpert
GBS LB assay. Testing was done at three different locations over five days. At each
location, two operators each tested three different lots of control material for a total of
90 test results each for the Positive and Negative Control swabs (3 sites x 5 days x 2
operators x 3 replicates = 90 replicates in total). A summary of the qualitative results
for both the Positive and Negative Controls are provided in Table 2. All Positive
Controls produced the expected Positive result, although one control was re-tested
due to an instrument ERROR which indicated that the assay was aborted. When re-
tested, the Positive Control produced the expected result. All Negative Controls
produced the expected Negative result.

1 One ERROR result was observed for the positive control. Both the positive control and negative control were
re-tested, as indicated in the test protocol.
2 Data from the test run with the ERROR result was not included in the Percent Correct analysis.
The reproducibility of the Cepheid Xpert GBS LB Control Panel within and between
test locations, GeneXpert Instruments, operators, and lots was determined to be
acceptable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Not applicable.
Stability:
1. Shelf-life stability was established through an Accelerated Stability Study that was
performed with three lots of the Positive Control from the Cepheid Xpert GBS LB
Control Panel. The Positive Control was placed at elevated temperatures (43˚C, 53˚C
and 63˚C) and tested in four replicates at four time points (Day 0, Day 14, Day 28 and
Day 42). When the stability of the product was evaluated qualitatively, all analytes
tested positive on the GeneXpert Instrument System using the Cepheid Xpert GBS
LB assay. Thus, the data provided no evidence of product degradation under the
conditions tested and may support shelf-life claims of 24 months.
2. A Real-Time, Shelf-Life Stability Study is in process with a goal of a 24 months
stability claim. Positive Control samples incubated at two temperatures (2-8°C and
25°C) will be qualitatively tested four times throughout a 25 months study (four
samples/sampling). Testing is expected to be completed by 08/27/2020.
3. An In-Use Stability Study was done to determine if the Positive and Negative
Control products would remain stable for five hours after hydration to demonstrate
stability of the product within the recommended time frame of use (i.e., ≤15 minutes).
Two replicates from a single lot were hydrated and set aside (in a centrifuge tube) at
room temperature (21°C). Samples were tested on the GeneCpert System after zero,
four, and six hours and gave expected values indicating that the product may be
hydrated and used within a six hour period without concern of performance.
Expected Values:
The Cepheid Xpert GBS LB Control Panel is a qualitative conrol expected to produce
positive results with the Positive Control (Streptococcus agalactiae) and negative
results with the Negative Control (Lactobacillus acidophilus) when tested with the
Cepheid Xpert GBS LB assay using the GeneXpert Instrument System.
