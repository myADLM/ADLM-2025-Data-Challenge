L. Test Principle:
The NOVEOS™ sIgE Assay is an immunometric, chemiluminescent assay for the
quantitative determination of IgE of known specificity in human serum samples. Magnetic
beads coated with streptavidin and fluorescent dye are incubated with a biotinylated allergen
that binds to the streptavidin molecule on the surface of the beads. The beads are collected by
use of a magnetic field to remove the liquid, and then undergo a wash step to remove
unbound biotinylated allergen prior to incubation with the sample. If present in the sample,
sIgE binds to the captured biotinylated allergen. After incubation, the beads are washed and
subsequently incubated with an HRP-labeled anti-IgE monoclonal antibody (Conjugate IgE)
to form an antibody-conjugate complex that is bound to the captured biotinylated allergen.
After washing away the non-bound conjugate, a chemiluminescent substrate is added to the
assay mixture resulting in light generation in proportion to the amount of antibody-conjugate
that has been bound to the beads. The fluorescence is used to correct for any bead loss during
the assay, and the (corrected) chemiluminescence is compared to a calibration curve to
provide quantification of bound sIgE. The higher the value of chemilumiscent signal detected
by the instrument, the higher the amount of sIgE detected in the sample tested.

determined according to CLSI guideline EP17-A2.
LoB was determined by testing three IgE-free human serum samples in ten replicates
per run, one run per day, for three days on two analyzers using two lots of
NOVEOS™ sIgE Assay, D001. The LoB was estimated as the 95th percentile of 90
measurements for each of the lots tested.
LoD was determined using five serum samples with low IgE concentrations. Each
sample was tested in replicates of ten per run, two runs per day, for three days on two
analyzers using three lots of NOVEOS™ sIgE Assay, D001. The LoD was
determined for each lot based on 900 measurements as the mean concentration of the
lowest sample with 95% or more of its replicates recovering above the LoB.
LoQ was determined as functional sensitivity using a set of 15 samples with low IgE
concentrations. Each sample was tested in replicates of two per run, one run per day,
for 20 days with three reagent lots on two instruments for a total of 80 data points per
sample per reagent lot. The LoQ is defined as the mean value of the sample which
fulfills the specification for the total within-laboratory imprecision (<20%CV).
The claimed LoB, LoD, and LoQ are based on the highest value obtained from the
lots tested and are summarized in the table below.

e. Analytical specificity:
i. Inhibition study:
Immunological specificity of D001 (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) allergen
was verified through competitive inhibition according to CLSI guideline I/LA20-
A3. A positive sample with specific IgE concentration of 43.2 kU/L was used in
the study.
The D001 allergen solution (inhibitor) was diluted into the positive serum sample
to achieve a starting concentration of 100 mg/mL. The D001 sample solution was
serially diluted five times in two folds and each diluted sample was evaluated for
dose-dependent inhibition in five replicates with three lots of NOVEOS™ sIgE
Assay, D001. The results of the dose-dependent inhibition study showed that 83%
inhibition was achieved with D001 at a final inhibitor concentration of 3.1 µg/mL.
The related allergen D070 (Storage mite), and the unrelated allergen, E006
(Guinea pig epithelium), E085 (Chicken feathers), F001 (Egg white), G006
(Timothy grass) and W003 (Giant ragweed) were also tested as potential
inhibitors at a final concentration of at least ten times the concentration of D001 at
which >50% inhibition was achieved. All allergen inhibitors were spiked into the
positive serum sample at a 1:1 dilution and evaluated with three lots of

NOVEOS™ sIgE Assay, D001. The results of the single-dose inhibition studies
using one related allergen (D007) and five unrelated allergens (E006, E085, F001,
G006 and W003) did not show inhibition (<15%) at a test concentration of 31.3
µg/mL for the related allergen and 1.2 mg/mL for the five unrelated allergens. The
inhibition studies indicate that the NOVEOS™ sIgE Assay, D001 contains the
immunologically relevant allergen.
ii. Interference
a) Endogenous Substance Interference:
The effect of the presence of elevated level of human albumin, hemoglobin,
triglyceride, conjugated bilirubin, and rheumatoid factor in serum samples
was evaluated by testing four (one negative, three positive including one near
0.35 kU/L) serum samples spiked with varying levels of each interferent and
analyzed in ten replicates in one assay run with three lots of NOVEOS™ sIgE
Assay, D001. The % recovery for each sample spiked with the interference
substance was calculated by comparing its result to that of the corresponding
reference sample spiked with an equal volume of the solvent without the
interference substance. No interference was noted for samples containing
human serum albumin up to 120 mg/mL, hemoglobin up to 200 mg/dL,
triglyceride up to 584 mg/dL, conjugated bilirubin up to 30 mg/dL, and
rheumatoid factor up to 513 IU/mL.
b) Exogenous Substance Interference:
The same protocol used in the endogenous substance interference study was
used to evaluate potentially interfering exogenous substances. No interference
was noted for samples containing biotin up to 1200 µg/L, diphenhydramine at
19.6 µmol/L, methylprednisolone at 1000 ng/mL, omalizumab at 0.12 mg/mL
and ranitidine at 6.0 µg/L.
iii. Cross-reactivity:
The potential cross-reactivity of non-IgE (IgA, IgD, IgG, and IgM) to the
NOVEOS™ sIgE Assay, D001 was evaluated by mixing serum samples spiked
with the immunoglobulin stock solutions containing IgA, IgG, and IgM at 77.2
mg/mL and IgD at 81.24 mg/mL with immunoglobulin stripped serum to obtain a
series of six two-fold serially diluted samples containing target levels of non-IgE
within or above the physiological range. The control samples were prepared by
serially diluting equal volumes of distilled water into stripped serum. No cross
reactivity was noted up to 20.4 mg/mL for IgA, IgG and IgM, and up to 2.4
mg/mL for IgD.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
To demonstrate the clinical performance of the NOVEOS™ sIgE Assay, D001, test
results of the clinical samples from 117 atopic and 119 healthy, non-atopic donors
evaluated in the method comparison study were compared to a clinical diagnosis of
allergy. The atopic donors with a clinical history of allergy-like symptoms were
identified as positive by skin prick testing (SPT) and the non-atopic donors with no
reported allergy. The clinical sensitivity and specificity in this study cohort are
summarized in the following table:

Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
A barcode scanner is part of the instrument system and is used to identify specimens.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The instrument system has automated specimen sampling and handling - the Sample Arm
transfers samples from tubes in the Sample Rotor to cuvettes in the Reaction Rotor.
5. Calibration:
All assays use a calibration curve which is generated from six level calibrators. A
calibration curve is run with each batch of samples.
6. Quality Control:
Controls are processed exactly the same as patient samples, but yield known expected
results. The manufacturer suggests that quality control specimens be run with each
calibration curve to monitor assay performance. The value assigned for the positive
control are with a lot-specific 2D barcode that lists what the expected values are for each
test that the control supports. Negative Controls for allergy is also coded into the 2D
barcode.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Carryover:
Evaluation of instrument carryover was conducted using one lot of reagent of NOVEOS
sIgE, D001 on three NOVEOS Immunoassay Analyzers. The carryover assessment is based
on 11 cycle counts split over two runs per instrument. Pooled high-level patient samples with
sIgE concentration of 73 kU/L were aliquoted into 11 tubes and pooled low-level patient
samples with sIgE concerntration of 0.24 kU/L were aliquoted into 55 tubes. During each
cycle one high sample is tested followed by five low samples. Low Sample 1 following High
Sample is denoted as “possibly affected” which has the highest chance of potential carryover
thus leading to signal change > 0.10 kU/L. Low Samples 3-5 is denoted as “very probably
unaffected” and therefore should not have elevated kU/L signal. Carryover assessment is
done by measuring the change (Δ) of [mean concentration of Low Sample 1] and [mean
concentration of Low Samples 3-5]. The results are summarized in the table below:
