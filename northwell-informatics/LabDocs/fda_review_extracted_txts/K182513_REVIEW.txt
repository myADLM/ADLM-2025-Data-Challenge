H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay is a multiplex RT-PCR in vitro diagnostic test
intended for the qualitative detection and differentiation of seasonal influenza A/H3N2,
seasonal influenza A/H1N1pdm09, and “non-seasonal” influenza A subtypes other than
seasonal H1N1pdm09 or H3N2. The assay is also intended for the qualitative detection
and differentiation of the genetic lineage of human influenza B viruses as B/Victoria or
B/Yamagata. The assay is designed for use on influenza nucleic acids isolated and
purified from nasopharyngeal swab and nasal swab specimens from human patients with
signs and symptoms of respiratory infection in conjunction with clinical and
epidemiological risk factors.
This assay amplifies the hemagglutinin (HA) gene segment, neuraminidase (NA) gene
segment, matrix (M) gene segment, non-structural (NS) gene segment, and nucleoprotein
(NP) gene segment for detection and discrimination of influenza A, and amplifies the
hemagglutinin (HA) gene segment and neuraminidase (NA) gene segment for detection
and discrimination of influenza B. This assay is not intended to detect influenza C
viruses.
FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay “non-seasonal” influenza A positive results are for the
presumptive detection of influenza A subtypes other than seasonal influenza
A/H1N1pdm09 or A/H3N2. The definitive identification of a “non-seasonal” influenza A
case requires additional testing and confirmation procedures in consultation with the
appropriate public health authorities (e.g., local or state public health departments, etc.)
for whom reporting is necessary.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection. FluChip-8G Influenza A+B
Assay “non-seasonal” influenza A negative results, even in the context of a FluChip-8G
Influenza A+B Assay positive result for seasonal influenza A/H1N1pdm09 or A/H3N2,
or influenza B, do not preclude “non-seasonal” influenza A infection and should not be
used as the sole basis for patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics of the FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay for detecting and
differentiating seasonal influenza A viruses were established when seasonal influenza
A/H3N2 was the predominant influenza A virus circulating in the United States.
Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging seasonal influenza A viruses.
Performance characteristics of the FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay for detecting and
differentiating human influenza B genetic lineages were established when influenza
2

--- Page 3 ---
B/Victoria was the predominant influenza B virus circulating in the United States.
Due to low prevalence of “non-seasonal” influenza A viruses, performance
characteristics of the FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay for detecting “non-seasonal”
influenza A viruses and distinguishing “non-seasonal” influenza A from seasonal
influenza A H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 were assessed exclusively by conducting cross-
validation on a total of 759 microarray images generated from bench testing contrived
samples consisting of 352 unique “non-seasonal” influenza A strains representing 62
subtypes, and by bench testing contrived samples and surrogate clinical specimens
consisting of 133 unique non-seasonal influenza A strains representing 46 subtypes.
FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay performance may vary when testing “non-seasonal”
influenza A strains not represented in the performance assessment.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus strain is suspected based on current clinical
and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel
virulent influenza viruses and sent to local or state health department(s) for testing. Viral
culture should not be attempted unless a BSL 3E facility is available to receive and
culture specimens.

Quality Control
Assay Controls
• Internal Control: Sequences corresponding to portions of the 18s rRNA gene are
included on each microarray to monitor adequate specimen collection, and in the absence
of influenza, also to indicate the absence of reaction inhibition. Primers to amplify the
18s internal control are included in the Primer Mix so that the sequence complement to
these microarray markers is amplified during RT-PCR and subsequently hybridized to the
microarray if sufficient human material is present in the collected specimen. This control
is expected to fail in samples containing no human cellular material. This control is
evaluated in the absence of an influenza positive result and is expected to result in “No
Call: Assay Failure (Internal Control)” in samples containing no human cellular material
or poorly collected specimens.
• Hybridization Control: Oligonucleotides are included on each microarray to monitor
the integrity of the hybridization procedure. The complementary sequences are
fluorescently tagged single-stranded synthetic DNA sequences included in the Hyb Mix
solution that bind specifically to the hybridization control sequences on the microarray.
When the hybridization process fails, the FC8G assay result will be “No Call: Assay
Failure (Hybridization Control)”.
• Labeling Control: Each microarray includes a biotin-terminated capture oligonucleotide
that bind to the fluorophore-coupled streptavidin solution present in the label applied
during the labeling step. This control serves as an indicator of successful microarray
labeling. When the labeling process fails, the FC8G assay result will be “No Call: Assay
Failure (Labeling Control)”.

• Image Processing Control: Direct fluorescently tagged sequences are included on each
microarray at specific locations. The image processing controls serve as points of
reference for microarray placement used by the FluChip-8G software during microarray
image analysis. When the FluChip-8G Microarray Slide is improperly positioned in the
FluChip-8G Imaging system, the FC8G assay result will be “Error: Image processing
failure”. A failure of this control may indicate an issue with the microarray quality,
placement of the FluChip-8G Microarray Slide in the FluChip-8G Imaging System, or a
focus issue of the FluChip-8G Imaging System.
External Quality Control (QC)
• External Batch Positive Control: A previously characterized influenza-positive clinical
specimen is recommended for inclusion as part of good laboratory practices. This control
is user-supplied.
• External Batch Negative Control: A previously characterized influenza-negative
clinical specimen is recommended for inclusion as part of good laboratory practices. This
control is user supplied.
• Extraction Negative Control: This control is recommended for inclusion in each testing
batch, and is composed of nuclease-free water added by the end user in place of specimen
during the nucleic acid extraction step.
• RT-PCR No Template Control: This control is recommended for inclusion in each
testing batch, and is composed of nuclease-free water added by the end user in place of
extracted nucleic acid template during RT-PCR reaction setup.
Workflow
The FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay is comprised of the following workflow:
1) Nucleic acid extraction
First, nucleic acids are extracted from human nasal swab or nasopharyngeal swab
specimen(s) stabilized in Universal Transport Media (UTM) employing the QIAamp DSP
Virus Spin Kit (catalog #61704). During the nucleic acid extraction step, both DNA and
RNA are co-eluted from starting material, and any influenza viral RNA as well as the
endogenous 18s rRNA internal control are made accessible for downstream
amplification. Extracted nucleic acid is then eluted and utilized as template for
downstream amplification.
2) Multiplexed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification
followed by heat fragmentation
The RT-PCR amplification primers designed for the FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay
(provided as FC8G Primer Mix) provide simultaneous (multiplexed) amplification of
several full-length gene segments of the influenza A virus genome (HA, NA, M, NS, and
NP), two full length gene segments of the influenza B virus genome (HA, NA), and a
segment of the 18s rRNA found in eukaryotic cells as an internal process control. The
7

--- Page 8 ---
FC8G Primer Mix provides amplification of all targeted gene segments for all influenza
A and B viruses, regardless of subtype or lineage, within a single reaction. A biotinylated
dUTP is supplied, and is used during RT-PCR to incorporate biotin molecules into the
amplified product. The FC8G Biotin dUTP supplements the standard dNTPs already
present in the FC8G Polymerase Mix. These biotin moieties are utilized for downstream
fluorescence labeling with a streptavidin-coupled fluorophore (FC8G Label) after the
microarray hybridization step. Post-amplification, RT-PCR products are heat-fragmented
for 10 min at 95°C to fragment the amplicons into shorter pieces for more efficient
downstream hybridization to the FluChip-8G Microarray Slide.
3) Microarray processing (pre-wash slides, hybridization, post-hybridization slide wash,
labeling, and post-label wash)
The FluChip-8G Microarray Slide consists of a 75 mm x 25 mm glass microscope slide
onto which 16 replicate microarrays (labeled A1 through H2) are printed. The Microarray
Slide is also labeled with a slide number at the top and a barcode at the bottom. Within
each replicate microarray, 464 unique synthetic DNA oligonucleotides (capture
oligonucleotide sequences) are printed that act as either influenza capture sequences (458,
each printed in triplicate) or assay controls (six control sequences). A heat-fragmented
post-amplification mixture is added to the microarray and incubated to allow for
hybridization between the amplified nucleic acid and the microarray capture sequences.
Once hybridization is complete, the microarray is washed to remove any unbound
material. The microarray is then labeled with a streptavidin-coupled fluorophore to
enable downstream fluorescence imaging.
4) Microarray imaging and data analysis
FluChip-8G Imaging System consists of: a) an optical imaging subsystem used to obtain
fluorescence images of FluChip-8G Microarray Slides processed via the FC8G Influenza
A+B Assay, b) instrument control software and application programming interface (API),
and c) FC8G Software that automates image acquisition, controls the settings and
instrument features available to end users through the user interface (UI), and interprets
the FluChip-8G Microarray Slide data using a neural network module to provide results
to the end users. Image processing algorithms within the FC8G Software locate the
microarray pattern within the image and determine the fluorescence intensity of
individual oligonucleotide captures on the microarray. Specific captures on the
microarray that are intended as controls verify that specific assay processing steps were
successfully completed. Trained neural networks are used to recognize the patterns of
intensities of the influenza-targeted captures on the microarray as belonging to specific
influenza types or subtypes/lineages. The neural network module utilizes seven
individual neural networks, with the microarray signals from the 458 influenza capture
sequences utilized as inputs. The output of each neural network is a value between 0 and
1, and a cutoff (optimized subsequent to neural network training) is applied to each to
determine if each is positive or negative for its trained target. A deterministic decision
tree then uses the binary outputs of the controls and neural networks to generate a
diagnostic output for each clinical sample. The diagnostic output is then displayed to the
8

--- Page 9 ---
end user in un-editable format for printing and/or saving.
Neural Networks Training and Verification
Neural networks training is an interactive process and includes the following elements:
a) Read in the library of results from well-characterized known samples corresponding to all
target virus groups for training.
b) Determine which result files contain sufficient signal to be used for training. Training set
inclusion is based on key capture sequences identified for different target virus groups.
c) Use the Fast Artificial Neural Network (FANN) open source library functions to train
individual networks. Each individual neural network uses a single hidden layer neuron
and a single output neuron trained via supervised learning using backpropagation.
d) Determine thresholds that optimize network performance in terms of positive percent
agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) with the known results of a
clinically-representative set of naïve samples.
e) Save network files with threshold values for verification and inclusion in FC8G Software.
The database of assay results available for training the neural networks consisted of 3372
microarray images. Inclusion criteria were applied to ensure that the influenza-positive
results had detectable signals on key captures of the microarray. This prevented result files
with undetectable signal levels from being trained as positives. The final count of microarray
images used for training by virus target group is presented in Table 1 below. This includes:
• 478 results from RT-PCR No Template Controls and Extraction Negative Controls.
• Results from 850 unique clinical specimens containing influenza, clinical specimens
negative for influenza, and contrived influenza positive samples.
• Results from 1736 replicate analyses from the 850 unique sample strains noted above
(primarily from dilution series testing).

Performance of the neural network algorithm was verified utilizing the technique of k-fold
cross-validation (k=10) that allows assessment of how the neural network algorithm will
generalize to a completely independent dataset. This mathematical approach was
accomplished by dividing the training set randomly into 10 groups. All groups but one are
used to train the neural network algorithm, and the algorithm is tested on the remaining
group. Then, the groups used for training are rotated until all combinations of nine training
groups/one test group have been used. The performance of each test group was then
compiled to estimate performance expected on an independent dataset. Therefore, while
viruses in the training set were not technically naïve to the training, this approach allowed an
estimation of performance as if each portion of the training set had been naïve prior to
validation activities.
Postmarket Surveillance and Software Update Plan
InDevR developed a plan to monitor genetic changes in the circulating strains of influenza
annually in order to assess the impact of those changes on the results generated by the FC8G
assay. InDevR will test the CDC human influenza panel (includes seasonal influenza A and
influenza B strains) and the CDC animal influenza panel (includes select, important non-
seasonal strains with pandemic potential) annually, if appropriate and available. If the CDC
human and animal influenza panels are not available or not appropriate for testing with the
FC8G assay, e.g., virus samples inactivated with Betapropiolactone (BPL) are not compatible
with the FC8G assay, etc. InDevR will conduct similar experiments on similar panels
compiled from other sources (such as commercial sources and/or collaborators). Such a
human influenza panel would consist of two strains of each target virus group, and include
strains genetically similar to those included in the annual quadrivalent vaccine formulation
for the four components in addition to two pre-2009 H1N1 strains. Composition of such an
animal influenza panel will be based on recommendations from the CDC and other
surveillance laboratories regarding selecting important non-seasonal strains with pandemic
potential, and will be subject to availability limitations. In addition, if testing and reporting
from CDC or other surveillance laboratory suggests that a newly emerging strain of influenza
is on the rise in the US and it is not represented in the CDC panels, then InDevR will work
with CDC and/or surveillance laboratories to test the newly emerging strain with the FC8G
assay to determine its reactivity with the newly emerging strain.
If the annual reactivity testing indicates that the assay is not reactive to one or more of the
strains tested, InDevR will further investigate by testing other similar strains to confirm that a
systematic non-reactivity exists and that this failure to detect the virus was not due to an
isolated assay failure or issue. If a change in reactivity is confirmed, the discovery will be
reported to the FDA. An update to the training database and re-optimization of the neural
network parameters would likely be necessary.
Once data have been generated that indicate an update to the training database is necessary,
InDevR will obtain as many strains representing the non-reactive group as possible. If the
virus(es) exhibiting low reactivity were initially emerging, it may be difficult to obtain a
large number of strains. Even with a relatively low number of strains, it may be possible to
17

create a robust collection of images by analyzing strains in replicates, as well as analyzing
each additional strain at a variety of concentrations by preparing a contrived panel spiked at a
variety of concentrations into pooled clinical negative material. These samples will then be
analyzed to generate FC8G assay images. Once FC8G images are obtained for these samples,
InDevR will utilize the same criteria currently in place for determining suitability for
inclusion in the training database. Once the training database update is complete, InDevR
will follow the same general procedure used during the initial software development to
optimize the neural network parameters and finalize the software update. In brief, InDevR
will utilize the FC8G Data Tools software developed for neural network training to optimize
the neural network parameters using a k-fold cross-validation approach. Once the neural
network parameters have been optimized, InDevR will optimize the thresholds applied to
each neural network and sub-net (assay cutoff) to ensure the proper balance of sensitivity and
specificity. After the assay thresholds have been optimized, the FC8G Software code would
be updated accordingly. Final validation of the updated software with the new neural network
parameters and cutoffs will also require bench testing of training-naïve samples of the
strain(s) in question.
Once validation of the newly updated software is completed, InDevR will submit a 510(k) to
the FDA for the modified device.
Results Interpretation
Interpretation of External Quality Control (QC) Results
• External Batch Positive Control (user supplied influenza positive specimen):
Interpret the External Batch Positive Control results (if included) to determine whether
the expected result of influenza positive was obtained and if the batch of samples is valid.
Failure to obtain the expected influenza positive result should invalidate the batch, and all
samples included in that batch should be retested.
• External Batch Negative Control (user supplied influenza negative clinical specimen):

L. Test Principle:
The FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay (FC8G assay) includes a multiplex primer mix to
amplify the hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), matrix (M), non-structural (NS), and
nucleoprotein (NP) gene segments of all influenza A viruses, as well as the hemagglutinin
(HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene segments of all influenza B viruses, and a portion of the
18s gene present in eukaryotic cells as an endogenous internal control. During a one-step RT-
PCR reaction, the primers and RT-PCR enzymes and reagents are utilized to amplify nucleic
acids extracted from human nasal specimens while incorporating biotin for downstream
fluorescence labeling. The biotinylated amplified products are then heat-fragmented and
applied to the FC8G microarray for hybridization, labeling, and detection using the FluChip-
8G Imaging System. The system software is trained to identify the patterns of the influenza
target virus groups using a large database of thousands of results from viruses of known
characterization, and a simple result in the form of a report is returned to the end user via the
software user interface.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Two independent studies: within-laboratory repeatability and external multi-site user-
to-user reproducibility, were carried out to evaluate the precision and reproducibility
of the FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay.
A 45-member panel was used for the two studies. The panel was made with five viral
strains that represent the five target influenza virus groups: A/New
Caledonia/20/1999 (A/non-seasonal), A/California/07/2009 (A/H1N1pdm09),
A/Victoria/361/2011 (A/H3N2), B/Wisconsin/01/2010 (B/Yamagata), and
B/Florida/02/2006 (B/Victoria). Each strain was diluted into pooled influenza

negative clinical material at three different target levels: Moderate Positive (MP)
(approximately 3xLoD), Low Positive (LP) (approximately 1xLoD), and High
Negative (HN) (approximately 0.1xLoD). Influenza negative clinical material
consisted of clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples stabilized in universal transport
medium (UTM) that were determined to be negative for the presence of influenza
virus via an FDA-cleared influenza molecular assay.
External Multi-Site User-to-User Reproducibility Study
Two operators at each of the three separate laboratory sites performed the FluChip-
8G Influenza A+B Assay (FC8G assay) according to the assay instructions for use.
Performance was evaluated on six unique testing points at the three separate laboratory
sites for a total of 18 testing points. Each testing point corresponds to a unique
run/execution of the FC8G assay, where each member of the blinded 45-member
panel of contrived samples was tested in triplicate. Two unique lots of FC8G assay
reagents were evenly divided between the three sites. At each site, each of the two
operators executed three testing points. Operators at each site alternated testing until
all six test points/site were completed. Each testing point was separated by a
minimum of one full day in which no FC8G assay processing for this study occurred.
A total of 810 data points (45 samples/testing point x 18 testing points) were
generated in this study. Performance was evaluated by determining the agreement
with the expected results, where the MP and LP concentrations were expected to be
positive for the intended target, and the HN was expected to be negative.

In addition, site-to-site, operator-to-operator, run-to-run, and reagent lot-to-lot
reproducibility performance were also assessed using the data generated from this
multi-site reproducibility study. There were no statistically significant differences in
the observed performance between sites, between operators, between runs, or
between reagent lots, as indicated by overlapping confidence intervals for all samples
expected to be positive.
Within-Laboratory Precision Study
Two operators at a manufacturer’s internal laboratory site performed testing in the
within-laboratory precision study. The same panel of 45 contrived samples described
previously was utilized to conduct a total of 12 test points, with six test points
conducted by each operator. Each testing point was separated by a minimum of one
full day in which no FC8G assay processing for this study occurred. The same lot of
FC8G reagents, including the QIAamp DSP Virus Spin Kit, and the same imaging
system was utilized by both operators for testing.
A total of 540 data points (45 samples/testing point x 6 testing points/operator x 2
operators) were generated in this study. Performance was evaluated by determining
the agreement with the expected results, where the MP and LP concentrations were
expected to be positive for the intended target, and the HN was expected to be
negative.
Table 4 below shows the results of the within-laboratory precision study.

• External Batch Negative Control: A previously characterized influenza-
negative clinical specimen is recommended for inclusion as part of good
laboratory practices. This control is user supplied.
• Extraction Negative Control: This control is recommended for inclusion in
each testing batch, and is composed of nuclease-free water added by the end
user in place of specimen during the nucleic acid extraction step.
• RT-PCR No Template Control (NTC): This control is recommended for
inclusion in each testing batch, and is composed of nuclease-free water added
by the end user in place of extracted nucleic acid template during RT-PCR
reaction setup.
The following language, pertaining to the external controls, is included in the
Instructions for Use (IFU):
“Good laboratory practice recommends that both an external positive control and
external negative control are included alongside clinical specimens in each batch of
extractions. These external positive and negative controls should be treated as
samples under analysis and interpreted as such. It is also recommended that an
extraction negative control (consisting of nuclease-free water) and an RT-PCR No
Template Control be run alongside each batch of specimens. These controls should
be carried through the entire assay alongside the clinical specimens under analysis.”
External batch positive controls were prepared for inclusion in each batch of samples
analyzed during the prospective clinical study testing. The following four viruses
were utilized to prepare the external batch positive controls: Influenza
A/Netherlands/2290/2009 (A/H1N1pdm09), Influenza A/Victoria/361/2011
(A/H3N2), Influenza B/Florida/02/2006 (B/Victoria), and Influenza
B/Florida/04/2006 (B/Yamagata). Three dilutions of each of the viruses were
prepared in viral transport media (VTM) in large volumes to produce twelve overall
external positive controls representing high, medium, and low influenza
concentrations in each sample, as determined by an influenza molecular assay.
Replicate aliquots of each control were prepared and provided to the clinical sites for
use in testing. During the prospective clinical study, each site included one of the four
external batch positive controls in each batch of specimens tested on a rotating basis.
Replicate aliquots of pooled influenza negative clinical materials that were
determined to be negative for the presence of influenza virus via an FDA-cleared
influenza molecular assay were also provided to the clinical study sites. During the
prospective clinical study, each site included one aliquot of the provided external
batch negative control in each batch of specimens tested.
In addition, an Extraction Negative Control and a No Template Control were also
included in each batch of specimens tested at each site.
During the prospective clinical study between June 2017 and July 2018 at three sites,
upon initial testing, there were one failed external batch negative control, one failed
26

--- Page 27 ---
extraction negative control, and one failed external batch positive control. All
controls with initial failed results generated expected results upon repeat testing. The
failure rate upon initial testing (including the failed and the invalid results) of the
external quality control materials was 1.7% (3/176), with 95% CI: (0.6% - 4.9%).
Nasal and Nasopharyngeal Swab in UTM Specimens Stability
An analytical study was performed to evaluate the stability of clinical nasal swab
(NS) and nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) in UTM specimens, when stored at refrigerator
temperature (2° - 8°C). Contrived samples consisting of one strain representing each
FC8G target virus group (A/H1N1pdm09, A/H3N2, A/non-seasonal, B/Victoria, and
B/Yamagata) were prepared in pooled influenza negative clinical matrix at an
influenza concentration of approximately 3x LoD. Triplicate extractions of the
contrived sample were performed following storage at 10°C ± 2°C for each of the
following time points: 0 hour, 24 hours, 36 hours, 48 hours, and 96 hours. For all
storage time points tested in this analytical study, an overall agreement of 100%
(95%CI, 79.6 – 100) with the expected result was obtained. This data supports a
stability claim of 72 hours at refrigerator temperature (2° - 8°C) for clinical nasal
swab (NS) and nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) in UTM specimens.
While a formal analytical study was not conducted to determine specimen stability at
≤ -70°C, data from the external controls performed during the clinical study were
analyzed to assess stability over time when stored at ≤ -70°C for 427 days. The
samples evaluated were those used as external batch controls executed weekly during
the course of the clinical study at the InDevR clinical site. Influenza positives in the
testing panel were stock influenza viruses spiked into UTM. Influenza negatives in
the testing panel were pooled influenza negative clinical material. Based on the
results of this analysis, it appears that the nasal swab and nasopharyngeal swab in
UTM specimens are stable for up to 14 months when stored at ≤ -70°C.
Nasal and Nasopharyngeal Swab in UTM Specimens Freeze and Thaw Study
An analytical study was conducted to assess the performance of the FC8G Assay on
contrived samples that underwent repeated freeze/thaw cycles to establish the
equivalency of samples subjected to freeze/thaw and support the clinical study design
of testing archived frozen specimens. A panel of 60 contrived influenza samples were
utilized in this testing, consisting of 12 unique strains for each of the five target
groups (A/H1N1pdm2009, A/H3N2, A/non-seasonal, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria).
Samples were contrived by spiking stock whole virus into pooled influenza negative
clinical material at a final concentration of approximately 3x LoD (ranging from 1x to
9x LoD, depending on strain), and five replicate aliquots of each prepared sample
were made. The first aliquot of each strain was tested without re-freezing
(immediately after preparation), with one aliquot of each strain tested after each of
four consecutive freeze-thaw cycles to assess % agreement with expected result. Data
from this study demonstrated that the FC8G Assay performance was not affected by
up to four freeze and thaw cycles of the specimens.

Extracted RNA Specimens Stability
An analytical evaluation was performed to evaluate the stability of extracted RNA
specimens, when stored at ≤ -70°C. A large volume of a representative A/H3N2 stock
virus, A/Victoria/361/2011, was utilized to perform this testing by spiking stock virus
into pooled influenza-negative clinical material at approximately 3x LoD and creating
individual homogeneous aliquots for downstream testing. Sixteen aliquots of the
prepared A/H3N2 contrived sample were extracted according to the Instructions for
Use (IFU), subsequently pooled to create a homogeneous material, and aliquoted into
five aliquots. Each aliquot was of sufficient volume to enable 14 replicate tests. One
aliquot was utilized to assess the assay performance at “Day 0”, and the remaining
four aliquots were stored at ≤ -70°C until tested. Three of the four remaining aliquots
were utilized to conduct testing at Days 14, 30, and 40 after storage. The last aliquot
was utilized to test the cumulative “worst case” stability of the assay intermediates,
including Extracted RNA Specimen, RT-PCR Product, Fragmented RT-PCR product,
and Labeled Microarray.
Extracted RNA specimens stored at ≤ -70°C showed 100% agreement with “Day 0”
results for the duration of the testing schedule of 40 days, supporting a stability claim
of 30 days at ≤ -70°C.
Intact and Heat-Fragmentated RT-PCR Products Stability
An analytical evaluation was performed to evaluate the stability of intact and heat-
fragmented RT-PCR products when stored at either +10°C or -10°C.
A large volume of a representative A/H3N2 stock virus, A/Victoria/361/2011, was
utilized to perform this testing by spiking stock virus into pooled influenza-negative
clinical material at approximately 3x LoD and creating individual homogeneous
aliquots for downstream testing. Thirty-five (35) aliquots of the prepared A/H3N2
sample were extracted according to the IFU, and subsequently pooled to create a
homogeneous material. This extracted material was then used as template in 254
replicate RT-PCR amplification reactions conducted according to the IFU. Once
amplified, all of the replicates of the amplified A/H3N2 sample were pooled to create
a homogeneous RT-PCR product which was subsequently aliquoted into
approximately 220 individual PCR tubes for downstream processing by the remainder
of the FC8G assay.
For the intact (un-fragmented) RT-PCR product testing, 14 replicate aliquots of the
amplified A/H3N2 sample were processed through the remainder of the FC8G assay
according to the IFU at “Day 0”. Eighty-four (84) replicate aliquots of the amplified
A/H3N2 sample were divided evenly at two different storage temperatures: 42
aliquots at +10°C and 42 aliquots at -10°C. For the +10°C stored products, 14
aliquots were processed through the remainder of the FC8G assay according to the
IFU at Day 3, Day 7, and Day 14 after storage. For the -10°C stored products, 14
28

--- Page 29 ---
aliquots were processed through the remainder of the assay at Days 7, 14, and 30 after
storage.
Intact (un-fragmented) RT-PCR products stored at +10°C showed 100% agreement
with “Day 0” results for the duration of the testing schedule of 14 days, supporting a
stability claim of 7 days at ≤ 8°C. Intact (un-fragmented) RT-PCR products stored at -
10°C showed 100% agreement with “Day 0” results for the duration of the testing
schedule of 30 days, supporting a stability claim of 14 days at ≤ -15°C.
For the heat-fragmented RT-PCR product testing, 14 replicate aliquots of the
amplified A/H3N2 sample were heat-fragmented and processed through the
remainder of the FC8G assay according to the IFU at “Day 0”. The remaining
replicate RT-PCR product aliquots were heat-fragmented according to the IFU, and
the fragmented products were then immediately pooled to create a homogeneous
material. The homogeneous material was then re-aliquoted. These aliquots were
evenly divided between two different storage temperatures, +10°C and -10°C. For the
+10°C stored products, aliquots were tested on Days 1, Day 3, Day 7, and Day 14
after storage. For the aliquots stored at -10°C, aliquots were tested on Days 3, 7, 14,
and 30 after storage.
Heat-fragmented RT-PCR products stored at +10°C showed 100% agreement with
“Day 0” results for the duration of the testing schedule of 14 days, supporting a
stability claim of 7 days at ≤ 8°C. Heat-fragmented RT-PCR products stored at -10°C
showed 100% agreement with “Day 0” results for the duration of the testing schedule
of 30 days, supporting a stability claim of 14 days at ≤ -15°C.
Labeled Microarray Stability
An analytical evaluation was performed to evaluate the stability of labeled
microarrays when stored at room temperature (18°C - 25°C).
Two microarray slides processed for other aspects of the assay intermediates stability
evaluations (one from the extracted RNA specimen stability evaluation, and one from
the RT-PCR product stability evaluation), were imaged on the FC8G Imaging System
immediately after assay completion (considered Day 0). A total of 14 replicate
A/H3N2 samples were included on each of the two microarray slides. The slides
were subsequently stored in a dry microarray slide box in the dark, at room
temperature and rescanned using the FC8G Imaging System after Days 3, 7, and 14.
Labeled microarrays stored at room temperature showed 100% agreement with “Day
0” results for the duration of the testing schedule of 14 days, supporting a stability
claim of 7 days at room temperature (18°C - 25°C).
Cumulative “Worst Case” Assay Intermediate Storage Stability
To investigate the cumulative “worst” case scenario in which each assay intermediate
29

--- Page 30 ---
was stored for the longest recommended storage time at its highest recommended
temperature in the IFU, an aliquot of pooled extracted RNA prepared for the extracted
RNA specimens stability testing was separated into 14 identical aliquots, and each
aliquot was RT-PCR amplified according to the IFU. The intact double-stranded
amplicon RT-PCR products were then stored at +10°C for seven days prior to
fragmentation. The products were then heat-fragmented according to the IFU, and the
fragmented products were stored at +10°C for seven days prior to hybridization and
labeling according to the IFU. After hybridization and labeling, the slide was initially
imaged. The imaged slide was then stored for seven days upon which it was re-
imaged. All 14 aliquots processed produced the expected A/H3N2 result. The testing
data supports the maximum recommended storage times and temperatures presented
in the IFU.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) was determined for each FC8G assay target virus group
(influenza A/H3N2, influenza A/H1N1pdm2009, influenza B/Yamagata, influenza
B/Victoria, and non-seasonal influenza A) by testing serial dilutions of stock virus
strains (used either as intact virus or viral genomic RNA, depending on influenza
subtype) spiked into pooled influenza negative clinical material. The LoD was
determined for each strain by: 1) performing a 10-fold serial dilution range-finding
experiment to determine an appropriate range for testing, 2) analyzing four replicates
of a 3-fold limiting dilution series spanning a concentration range both above and
below the assay cutoff to approximate the LoD, and 3) confirming the LoD by
determining the concentration at which 95% positivity is achieved from testing at
least 20 replicates.
LoD for Seasonal Influenza Target Virus Groups
The LoD was established for eight strains of seasonal influenza, including two strains
each of A/H1N1pdm09, A/H3N2, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria. All viral stock
materials were intact whole virus of known titer spiked into pooled influenza-
negative clinical material. The confirmed LoD in TCID /mL for each strain
50
investigated are shown in Table 5 below, along with associated concentrations in
approximate genome copies/mL determined at the LoD.

LoD for Non-Seasonal Influenza A
The LoD was established for 10 strains of non-seasonal influenza A, representing 10
different subtypes. Due to safety and availability reasons, in this study the A/H5 and
A/H7 strains were tested as extracted viral genomic RNA, and the other strains were
tested as whole virus. Both types of starting material were spiked into pooled
influenza-negative clinical material and processed through the entire assay, including
extraction. Specific procedures were followed (i.e., stabilization of RNA with
protease/lysis buffer) to ensure that RNA spiked into clinical negative material did
not degrade prior to testing. The confirmed LoD in either TCID /mL or approximate
50
genome copies/mL, depending on the starting viral material (i.e., whole virus vs.
extracted genomic viral RNA), along with associated concentrations in approximate
genome copies/mL determined at the LoD for the whole viruses, are shown in Table 6
below.

The A/H1N1v virus strain tested (A/Swine/IL/4L013/2015) was consistently
misidentified as an A/H1N1pdm09 virus during the study. For samples at and above
the LoD, this virus was correctly identified as non-seasonal influenza A, but was also
identified incorrectly as an A/H1N1pdm09 (a dual positive result). At concentrations
below the LoD, the A/H1N1v samples were misidentified as A/H1N1pdm09 only.
The H3N2v virus strain tested (A/Indiana/08/2011) resulted in correct identification
as non-seasonal influenza A at concentrations at and above the LoD, but was
misidentified at concentrations below the LoD as an A/H1N1pdm09. The
misidentification of A/H1N1v and A/H3N2v as seasonal A/H1N1pdm09 or as non-
seasonal influenza A and A/H1N1pdm09 dual infections is likely due to close genetic
similarities among these viruses. The assay Instructions for Use (IFU) includes
limitation language indicating these possible results for variant viruses, and follow-up
retesting requirement for all dual positive results.

e. Analytical Reactivity
Analytical reactivity (inclusivity) was evaluated for 52 additional temporally and
geographically diverse influenza strains representing all FC8G assay target virus
groups. The FC8G assay was executed on either titered stock whole virus or extracted
RNA (depending on subtype) spiked into pooled clinical negative material at close to
the LoD concentration. Each strain was tested in triplicate. Any virus that was not
correctly identified in triplicate was tested again at a higher concentration until
detected.
Analytical Reactivity of Seasonal Influenza Target Virus Groups
Analytical reactivity (inclusivity) was determined for 32 seasonal influenza strains
near the limit of detection as shown in Table 7 below. In this study, whole viruses
were utilized as starting material for the testing. The testing concentrations are shown
in both TCID /mL and approximate genome copies/mL. The multiple of the LoD
50
tested was determined based on the approximate genome copies/mL values.

Analytical Reactivity of Non-Seasonal Influenza A Target Virus Group
Analytical reactivity (inclusivity) was determined for 20 virus strains belonging to the
non-seasonal influenza A target virus group (i.e., all influenza A subtypes other than
A/H1N1pdm09 or A/H3N2). For A/H5 and A/H7 strains, due to safety and
availability reasons, starting material used was extracted genomic viral RNA in this
study. All other strains utilized whole virus as starting material in this study. Both
types of starting material were spiked into pooled influenza-negative clinical material
at close to the LoD concentrations and processed through the entire assay, including
extraction. Results are shown in Table 8 below. The multiple of the LoD tested was
determined based on the approximate genome copies/mL values.

f. Analytical specificity
Analytical Specificity for Influenza Viruses
Analytical specificity for all target virus groups was evaluated with the FC8G assay to
determine whether strains of a known target influenza virus group were misidentified
as another influenza virus group targeted by the assay when run at high concentration.
High concentrations of stock influenza virus or extracted genomic viral RNA
(depending on subtype) were spiked into pooled influenza-negative clinical material in
triplicate and analyzed by the FC8G assay to determine if any mis-identification
occurred.
Analytical Specificity for Seasonal Influenza Target Virus Groups
Analytical specificity (exclusivity) was demonstrated for 32 strains of seasonal
influenza at high concentrations. Whole virus was utilized as starting material in this
study and spiked into influenza-negative clinical material at concentrations >106
approximate genome copies/mL. Results of this study are shown in Table 9 below.

Analytical Specificity for Non-Seasonal Influenza A Target Virus Group
Analytical specificity (exclusivity) was determined for 19 non-seasonal influenza A
viruses. In this study the A/H5 and A/H7 strains were tested as extracted genomic viral
RNA for safety and availability reasons, and all other strains were tested as whole
virus. Starting materials were spiked into pooled influenza negative clinical material at
concentrations >106 approximate genome copies/mL. Results of this study are shown
in Table 10 below.

Analytical Specificity with Non-Influenza Respiratory Pathogens
Analytical specificity of the FC8G assay with non-influenza organisms that may be
present in the respiratory tract of patients presenting with influenza-like illness was
conducted testing a panel of 34 non-influenza organisms (19 bacteria isolates and 15
viruses). A stock of each organism in culture media at known titer was spiked into
pooled influenza-negative clinical material at concentrations ≥106 CFU/mL for
bacteria and ≥105 TCID /mL or CCU/mL for viruses and atypical bacteria, whenever
50
possible. Each organism was extracted once and tested in triplicate. For any organisms
producing a false positive result of influenza, additional replicates were tested as
needed to evaluate consistency of assay results in the presence of potentially cross-
reactive organisms. Final results of this study are shown in Table 11 below.

None of the organisms tested in this study were found to be cross-reactive with the
FC8G assay at the concentrations tested.
Microbial Interference Study
Microbial interference was assessed for the FC8G assay by testing a 10-member test
panel that represented an abbreviated version of the test panel used in the Analytical
Specificity Study above. The non-influenza organism at high concentration (i.e., ≥106
CFU/mL for bacteria and ≥105 TCID /mL or CCU/mL for viruses and atypical
50
bacteria) was mixed with an influenza virus at close to the LoD concentration in the
same sample to determine if the presence of the non-target organism would interfere
with the detection of the influenza analyte using the FC8G assay.
Contrived samples with one representative virus strain from each of the five target
virus groups, A/California/07/2009 (A/H1N1pdm09), A/Victoria/361/2011 (A/H3N2),
B/Florida/02/2006 (B/Victoria), B/Wisconsin/01/2010 (B/Yamagata), and A/New
Caledonia/20/1999 (A/H1N1 pre-2009, non-seasonal influenza A), were prepared at a
concentration of approximately 3x to 5x LoD. Influenza samples were prepared in
pooled influenza-negative clinical material, and the diluted non-influenza organisms
were added to the extraction buffer to yield the desired concentration for testing. Each
contrived sample was extracted once and tested in triplicate.
Results of the Microbial Interference Study are summarized in Table 12 below.

* One Influenza B Yamagata sample was identified only as influenza B only (without Yamagata lineage).
The results showed that the evaluated non-influenza organisms at the concentrations
tested in this study did not interfere with the detection of influenza virus samples at
close to the LoD concentrations.
g. Influenza Competitive Interference Study
To assess performance of the FC8G assay for samples containing two different
influenza viruses, samples containing one representative virus from each of two
different target virus groups were spiked into pooled influenza negative clinical
material and analyzed by the FC8G assay. Mock dual infection samples that
represented all permutations of dual infections of the following five influenza strains,
A/South Carolina/18/2009, A/Victoria/361/2011, A/Ruddy Turnstone/Delaware
Bay/39/1994, B/New Jersey/01/2012, and B/Texas/06/2011, representing the five
target virus groups, A/H1N1pdm09, A/H3N2, A/H11N3 (non-seasonal influenza A),
B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata, respectively, at three different concentrations of each
included virus (high, medium, and low, corresponding to approximately 500x, 60x,
and 4x LoD, respectively, based on the assessment of Ct values generated by an FDA-
cleared influenza molecular assay), were analyze for a total of 90 samples, as outlined
in Table 13 below.
Results of the Competitive Interference Study are summarized in Table 13 below.

The FC8G assay resulted in a correct dual infection identification for 33% (30/90) of
samples analyzed, and correctly identified at least one of the two viruses in the sample
66% (59/90) of the time. One sample, containing B/Victoria and B/Yamagata at low
concentrations, resulted in an “influenza B detected (no lineage)” result.
Results of this mock dual infection testing, organized by relative concentrations of the
two viruses, are presented in Table 14 below.

This analysis showed that samples for which both viruses were at the same
concentration had a 63% rate of correct dual infection identification. This was
significantly higher than the 18% rate of correct dual identification when samples
contained viruses at two different concentrations. Regarding the samples that
contained two viruses at different relative concentrations, 82% of samples resulted in a
correctly identified single infection result by the FC8G assay only.
An additional analysis of samples with different viral concentrations that resulted in a
correctly identified single infection only by the FC8G assay is presented in Table 15

This analysis demonstrated that the FC8G assay was less likely to identify a dual
infection on samples containing viruses from the same influenza type or lineage (17%)
compared to a co-infection of samples including one influenza A and one influenza B
virus (44%). Further, a co-infection of both influenza B lineages (B/Victoria +
B/Yamagata), as well as a co-infection of both the seasonal influenza A viruses
(A/H1N1pdm09 + A/H3N2) resulted in zero dual infections correctly identified. The
only dual infections identified in co-infection of the same influenza virus types were
influenza A seasonal viruses mixed with an influenza A non-seasonal virus (either
A/H1N1pdm09 or A/H3N2 with A/H11N3) in 33% of such samples tested.
h. Potentially Interfering Substances Study
The effects of 17 potentially interfering substances that may be encountered in
respiratory specimens were assessed in an analytical study. To evaluate the potential
for interfering substances to cause false negative results in influenza positive samples,
one representative virus strain from each of the five target virus groups,
A/California/07/2009 (A/H1N1pdm09), A/Perth/16/2009 (A/H3N2),
B/Florida/02/2006 (B/Victoria), B/Wisconsin/01/2010 (B/Yamagata), and
A/Chicken/NY/SG-00425/2004 (A/H2N2, non-seasonal influenza A), was analyzed in
triplicate at approximately 5x the LoD in the presence of the interferent. Samples were
prepared by spiking each potentially interfering substance into a contrived specimen of
pooled influenza negative clinical material containing one of the virus strains. To
evaluate the potential for false positive results due to the presence of potentially
interfering substances in influenza negative samples, representative influenza negative
samples were analyzed in triplicate in the presence of each substance.
If a substance was found to interfere in an influenza positive sample (i.e., caused a
false negative result), samples were prepared with the interferent at a lower

concentration and retested until a concentration of interferent was tested that resulted
in the correct/expected result for all three replicates. If a substance was found to
interfere in an influenza negative sample (i.e., caused a false positive result), the
existing extracted sample was re-analyzed in triplicate to assure reproducible results.
Any substance that resulted in consistent false positive or false negative results are
reported as an interfering substance with the FC8G assay.
The results of the study are summarized in Table 17 below.

spray, and were correctly identified in all three replicates. In addition, as expected,
FluMist (an attenuated live intranasal vaccine) interfered with the assay by causing
false positive results in influenza negative samples. Limitations regarding these
observations were developed and included in the assay Instructions for Use (IFU).
i. Carry-Over Study
Potential sample-to-sample carry-over contamination was investigated by analyzing
influenza positive samples at high concentration (>106 approximate genome
copies/mL) next to pooled clinical negative samples in a single run, and conducting
the microarray hybridization portion of the assay in a checkerboard pattern of
alternating positives and negatives. Run-to-run carry-over contamination was
evaluated by executing a run of the alternating positive/negative samples used for the
sample-to-sample carry-over contamination testing followed by a run containing only
influenza negatives to assess risk of carry-over. This cycle of testing was repeated
three times. An A/H3N2 virus strain A/Uruguay/716/2007 was utilized to prepare
positive samples in this testing. The influenza negative sample tested was pooled
influenza negative clinical material.
In addition, as an alternative assessment of sample-to-sample contamination during
hybridization, a mock hybridization study was performed. Two solutions, one
containing blue dye and one without dye, were added to eight FluChip-8G Microarray
Slides in an alternating, checkboard pattern (i.e., 64 wells with dye, 64 wells without
dye). The FluChip-8G Microarray Slides were then placed on orbital shaker at 125-
140 RPM for one hour to mimic the hybridization step. Triplicate absorbance
measurements were then taken of the solution in all wells without dye to determine
whether any dye contaminated neighboring wells.
The FC8G assay results from the carry-over contamination study are in Table 18
below.

samples resulted in the expected result. While two pooled clinical negative samples
did produce a false positive result for A/H1N1pdm09, follow up analysis of these

RNA extracts using an FDA-cleared influenza molecular assay resulted in no influenza
detected indicating no evidence of cross-contamination during extraction. It is
expected that these two incidents are not systematic, as this rate of false positivity is
consistent with assay performance in other studies. The possibility does exist,
however, that this was due to cross-contamination during the microarray processing
steps.
The mock hybridization analysis resulted in none of the wells having absorbance
measurements that were significantly above background, indicating no cross-
contamination event during microarray hybridization.
There was no evidence of systematic sample-to-sample carryover or run-to-run cross
contamination. However, any open platform assay based on PCR and endpoint
detection has the potential for carry-over and/or cross-contamination if careful
measures to avoid contamination are not taken. Therefore, the FC8G assay IFU
includes the warnings and limitations language below which stresses the importance of
good technique to obtain proper results:
“Limit use of this product to personnel trained in the techniques of PCR-based
molecular diagnostic assays. PCR-based assays require effort by the operator to
reduce potential for cross-contamination during all steps of the procedure, including:
nucleic acid extraction, transfer of nucleic acid, and RT-PCR reaction preparation. In
addition, care should be taken not to introduce cross-contamination during the
microarray hybridization step.”
“Laboratory workflow should proceed in a unidirectional manner, starting with
nucleic acid extraction and ending with microarray detection. Change gloves
whenever contamination is suspected. Use dedicated areas and separate
supplies/equipment for pre and post amplification processes.”
j. Assay cut-off
The threshold value or cutoff for each of the neural networks was selected separately
and subsequently to the neural network training and architecture lock down in order to
optimize the performance of the neural network over a given set of samples. Initially,
the entire training database of samples was used as the set over which performance
was optimized. The thresholds were then determined for each neural network as the
value which would minimize the total number of errors (false positives plus false
negatives) over this dataset.
It was later observed that the dataset used to select the thresholds differed significantly
from what would be expected with real clinical data. The training dataset had a much
higher percentage of influenza-positive samples than influenza-negative samples. This
was good for training the various influenza-positive patterns, but resulted in a higher
False Negative/False Positive ratio than would be expected in real-world testing. In
addition, the training dataset included many samples processed as part of dilution
45

--- Page 46 ---
series used to determine the limit of detection, and thus had a much higher percentage
of influenza-positive samples below the limit of detection than would be expected in
real-world data. Identifying these samples as true positive rather than false negative
required lower thresholds. These biases in the dataset used to determine the original
thresholds biased them toward sensitivity over specificity.
To optimize the thresholds for real-world testing, a set of 910 training naïve clinical
samples, consists of 251 influenza A positive samples, 163 influenza B positive
samples, and 496 influenza negative samples, was compiled from an existing in-house
archive comprised of material received from various vendors. The clinical samples
were processed by the FC8G assay and used to revise the thresholds. These samples
were of unknown concentration, and thus considered to be clinically-representative of
both influenza concentrations and human background material. This set of 910
samples was entirely independent from the clinical study data presented in the Clinical
Studies section. A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) method was used to
optimize the thresholds.
The revised and optimized thresholds were further validated during the prospective
clinical study conducted between June 2017 and July 2018.

Prospective Clinical Study
Clinical performance characteristics of the FC8G assay were evaluated in a multi-center
clinical study between June 2017 and July 2018 in the U.S.
Nasal swab (NS) or nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens were prospectively collected
between 2013-2017 from consented patients meeting a febrile respiratory illness (FRI)
case definition. Patients were enrolled at seven geographically distributed clinical sites
across the United States under a standing influenza surveillance protocol. Upon specimen
collection, the nasal swab and nasopharyngeal swab specimens were stabilized in Copan
Universal Transport Media (UTM) and shipped frozen to a reference laboratory as part of
this ongoing influenza surveillance effort. Remaining volume of each specimen was
archived and stored at ≤ -70°C at the reference laboratory.
46

--- Page 47 ---
To assess the clinical performance of the FC8G assay, the prospectively collected
archived specimens were thawed and tested with an FDA-cleared influenza molecular
assay (the comparator assay) by the reference laboratory, and then blinded and shipped to
one of the three participating testing sites. Each clinical study testing site performed the
FC8G assay on approximately one third of the blinded specimens. After all specimens
were tested with the FC8G assay, the specimens were un-blinded and the FC8G assay
result was compared to the comparator assay result for each specimen. Specimens with
discordant results were reflex tested using bi-directional sequencing of the hemagglutinin
(HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes.
Of the 1065 subjects enrolled in this study, there were seven specimens excluded from
the performance analyses due to deviation from the study protocol, leaving a total of
1058 prospectively collected swab specimens to be included in the evaluation of the
assay performance. There were an additional 36 specimens that did not generate a final
result with the FC8G assay due to insufficient sample volume as a result of an external
batch control failure (user error) during initial or retesting efforts, resulting in a total of
1022 specimens with a final valid FC8G assay result.
Patient age and gender distribution for all the 1022 prospective specimens (700 NS and
322 NPS specimens) are presented in Table 19 below.

Of the total of 1022 samples with a final valid FC8G assay result, 26 specimens resulted
in a failure of the FC8G assay internal control to amplify above the threshold value, i.e.,
“No Call: Assay Failure (Internal Control)”, and were excluded from the performance
analyses. In addition, there were 12 specimens that resulted in a comparator assay result
of “inconclusive” due to internal control failures, and were also excluded from the
performance analyses.
The performance of the FC8G assay testing the remaining 984 specimens (664 NS and
320 NPS specimens) against the comparator assay is presented in Table 20 below.

Compared to the comparator assay, the performance of the FC8G assay in this
prospective clinical study was also analyzed by testing site, and by specimen type (NS
vs. NPS), demonstrating similar performance across the three testing sites and across
the two specimen types.
The invalid rate observed during this clinical study was 5.9% (62/1058), 95% CI: 4.6% -
7.4%. This rate includes 26 specimens for which the internal control did not produce a
result (a “no call” invalid result), and 36 specimens for which inadequate specimen
volume existed to generate a final valid result due to an external batch control failure
(user error) either during initial or recommended retesting.
One dual infection was detected by the FC8G assay during this study, resulting in both a
Flu A/H3N2 call and a Flu A/non-seasonal call by the FC8G assay. A Flu A/H3 result
was generated by the comparator assay. This specimen was retested in accordance with
the follow-up recommendations in the FC8G assay instructions for use. Upon retest, this
specimen produced the same dual infection result. Reflexive bi-directional sequencing for
this specimen produced a result of Influenza A/H3N2, matching the comparator assay
result.
Supplemental Clinical Study
As the prevalence of influenza in the prospective clinical study was expected to be lower
than needed to obtain sufficient numbers of influenza positive specimens to establish
FC8G assay performance, archived nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens that were
prospectively collected from 500 subjects from November 16, 2014 to December 13,
2014 and from January 28, 2016 to April 6, 2016, were acquired from a vendor to be
enrolled in a supplemental clinical study. These NPS specimens represented all
specimens archived during a defined period that met the same inclusion criteria as the
prospective clinical study described previously, and were available in the vendor’s
possession with a sufficient volume.
The acquired archived specimens were thawed and tested with an FDA-cleared influenza
molecular assay (the comparator assay) by the reference laboratory, and then blinded and
shipped to one of the three participating testing sites. Each clinical study testing site
performed the FC8G assay on approximately one third of the blinded specimens. After all

* Influenza A (Overall) category includes two specimens that resulted in a FC8G assay result of “Influenza AH1N1pdm09”.
The comparator assay generated a result of “Influenza A (Equivocal), No subtyping”. Both samples were correctly
identified as influenza A by the FC8G assay, therefore, counted as true positives in the Influenza A (Overall) category, but
were both counted as false positives for the Influenza A/H1N1pdm09 subtype.

Compared to the comparator assay, the performance of the FC8G assay in this
supplemental clinical study was also analyzed by testing site. The FC8G assay
demonstrated similar performance across the three testing sites.
No invalid result or dual infection result was generated by the FC8G assay during this
study.
Retrospective Clinical Studies
A retrospective clinical study was conducted to supplement the prospective performance
studies, since there were low numbers of positive specimens for A/H1N1pdm09 and

B/Yamagata in the prospectively collected cohorts. A total of 98 retrospective blinded
NPS or NS specimens, collected from 2010 to 2018, were analyzed by the FC8G assay
against the same comparator assay utilized in the prospective clinical studies, to increase
the number of influenza positive specimens per target virus group. One specimen was
removed from the performance analysis due to an internal control failure in the FC8G
assay, resulting in 97 specimens being included in the performance analysis.
The performance of the FC8G assay testing the 97 NS or NPS retrospective specimens
against the comparator assay is presented in Table 25 below.

* Influenza A (Overall) category includes one specimen that resulted in a FC8G assay result of “Influenza B/Yamagata”.
The comparator assay generated a result of “Influenza A (Equivocal), No subtyping” and “Influenza B/Yamagata”. This
sample was counted as a false negative in the Influenza A (Overall) category, but was counted as a true positive for the
Influenza B (Overall) and the Influenza B/Yamagata categories.
An additional retrospective clinical study was also conducted to supplement the
prospective performance studies, since there were lower than expected numbers of
specimens that were obtained from patients 65 years of age or older in the prospectively
collected cohorts. One hundred and ten (110) NPS specimens were sourced
retrospectively to increase the number of specimens in the 65+ age bracket. All these
retrospective specimens for the 65+ age group were collected between 2016 and 2018,
with 51 specimens collected from males and 59 collected from females. The specimens
were analyzed by the FC8G assay against the same comparator assay utilized in the
prospective clinical studies. Two specimens resulted in an assay failure by either the
FC8G assay or the comparator assay and were not included in the performance analysis.
The performance of the FC8G assay on the 108 retrospective NPS samples with a valid
result for the 65+ age bracket is shown in Table 26 below.

Non-Seasonal Influenza A Virus Challenge Study
Due to the rarity of non-seasonal influenza A infections in humans and therefore the lack
of non-seasonal influenza A in the prospectively collected clinical study cohorts or in the
retrospective specimens, a FC8G assay non-seasonal influenza A challenge study was
executed.
The non-seasonal influenza A challenge study was performed testing 220 blinded surrogate
clinical samples representing 41 unique influenza A subtypes, including an equal number
of influenza positive and influenza negative samples. One hundred (100) surrogate clinical
samples were contrived by spiking each of the 100 unique non-seasonal influenza A strains
into unique individual clinical negative NS or NPS collected in VTM (i.e., influenza
negative clinical specimen from a single patient). The 100 non-seasonal strains were
selected to represent diversity in host-origin and subtype, with a focus on subtypes with
pandemic potential. Fifty (50) of the 100 unique non-seasonal influenza A viruses were
tested with the FC8G assay at concentrations from approximately 0.5x to 3x LoD, and the
other 50 non-seasonal influenza A viruses were analyzed at concentrations greater than 3x
LoD (see Table 27 below). For safety reasons, all H5 and H7 subtypes were utilized as
extracted RNA and not intact whole virus. To reduce potential bias, 10 contrived surrogate
clinical specimens from seasonal target virus groups, and 110 influenza-negative clinical
specimens were also included in the sample set. All specimens included in this study were
blinded to the analyst, and all testing occurred at a single site.
Overall, this challenge study included testing 62 non-seasonal influenza A strains
representing subtypes that were included in the training set. The challenge study also
included testing 38 non-seasonal influenza A strains that were not included in the training
set (i.e., naïve to training) as a challenge to the assay. All the 100 non-seasonal influenza
A strains tested in this challenge study were contrived in unique individual influenza
negative clinical specimens, and therefore, had a unique clinical background compared to
other analyses of the FC8G microarray images generated by testing the same strain that
may have been included in training.

* This sample is a mixed infection of A/H7N1, A/H7N3, and A/H7N5.
The non-seasonal influenza A strains utilized to build contrived specimens in this study
were characterized by a combined method comprised of virus characterization provided
on Certificates of Analysis (COA) for commercially obtained strains, sequencing
information for the hemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA) genes, and/or an
FDA-cleared influenza molecular assay. Performance of the FC8G assay in this study
was assessed against the expected results of the contrived specimens. One negative
sample produced an inconclusive (internal control failure) result by the FDA-cleared
influenza molecular assay, and was removed from the performance analysis. Six negative
samples resulted in FC8G assay internal control failures, and were also excluded from the
performance analysis.
FC8G assay performance for the remaining 213 contrived specimens, are presented in
Table 28 below.

Influenza B/Yamagata 3/3 100% 43.9 - 100 210/210 100% 98.2 - 100
The overall sensitivity of the assay for the non-seasonal influenza A target virus group
was 99% (95% CI of 96.4%- 99.8%) and specificity was 100% (95% CI of 96.7% -
100.0%). All 10 seasonal influenza viruses included in this study were correctly
identified.
One pre-2009 H1N1 strain (A/Fukushima/141/2006) analyzed at approximately 1.5x LoD
produced a false positive result for A/H1N1pdm09. Based on the results of the FDA-
cleared influenza molecular assay, the concentration of human cellular DNA appeared to
be orders of magnitude higher than the concentration of the influenza A RNA in this
specimen, indicating there might have been a competition between 18s and influenza A
amplifications in this specific specimen. In addition, one negative sample resulted in a
false positive for A/H1N1pdm09.
