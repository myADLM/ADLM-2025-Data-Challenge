L. Test Principle:
The FastPack® IP Sex Hormone Binding Globulin Immunoassay is a chemiluminescent
paramagnetic particle, two-site sandwich immunoassay that employs specific monoclonal
antibodies. A mixture of biotinylated anti-SHBG specific antibody and anti-SHBG antibody
labeled with alkaline phosphatase reacts with SHBG from the patient’s sample forming a
sandwich complex in the mixture. Streptavidin-coated paramagnetic particles are added to
the reaction mixture. Wash steps remove unbound materials. Chemiluminogenic substrate is
added to the bound complex and the chemiluminescence signal (relative luminescence units)
is measured. The amount of relative luminescence units is directly proportional to the
concentration of SHBG in the sample.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility
Precision was evaluated following CLSI EP5-A3 guideline. Seven serum patient
samples with concentrations range ~5 to ~150 nmol/L SHBG were tested in duplicate
determinations in each of two runs per day on each of three reagent lots. Testing was
performed over a period of 20 non-consecutive days to yield 80 replicate
determinations for each sample.
The precision results from one representative lot are summarized in the table below:
Mean Within-Run Between Run Between Day Total
Sample
(nmol/L) SD % CV SD % CV SD % CV SD % CV
1 5.02 4.88 4.88 0.0 0.0 0.16 3.20 0.29 5.83
2 16.74 0.74 4.40 0.89 5.29 0.88 5.24 1.45 8.65

4 63.53 2.99 4.71 3.36 5.29 2.57 4.04 5.18 8.15
5 94.47 7.31 7.74 5.33 5.64 4.44 4.70 10.07 10.66
6 107.81 8.31 7.70 4.59 4.26 8.03 7.44 12.43 11.53
7 150.43 4.16 4.16 0.0 0.0 4.28 2.85 7.58 5.04
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study was conducted following CLSI EP06-A guideline. A high serum
sample pool with a value > 180 nmol/L SHBG was intermixed with a low serum
sample pool to make 11 concentrations spanning the intended linear range of the
assay. All samples were run in quadruplicate determinations versus one FastPack®
reagent lot on one FastPack® analyzer. The following linearity regression equation
was obtained:
y=0.9861x + 0.4787; r2 = 0.9993
The results of this study demonstrate that this method is linear for a measuring range
of 0.8 to 174 nmol/L.
c. Traceability
The FastPack® IP Sex Hormone Binding Globulin Immunoassay is traceable to the
WHO 082/266 reference material.

d. Detection limit:
Detection capability studies were conducted per CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
For the limit of blank (LoB) study a total of 180 replicate determinations of a blank
sample were run over 4 days on 6 FastPack® analyzers using three lots of FastPack®
reagents. Data was analyzed using the non-parametric approach per CLSI EP17-A2
guideline. Based on the results of the study, the LoB was set to 0.08 nmol/L.
The limit of detection (LoD) study was conducted by testing 4 low-level SHBG
samples over 4 days on 6 FastPack® analyzers using three lots of FastPack®
reagents. LoD was determined based on the lowest amount of analyte in a sample
that can be detected with type I and II error rates set to 5% . Based on the results of
the study, the LoD was set to 0.20 nmol/L.
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) study was conducted by testing 4 low-level samples
over 4 days on 6 FastPack® analyzers using three lots of FastPack® reagents. The
LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration wherein a <20% CV occurs. The LoQ
was calculated for each lot of reagents, and the LoQ that met the acceptance criteria at
the representative performance reagent combination was selected. Based on the
analysis of the study results the LoQ is set at 0.80 nmol/L.
The sponsor’s claimed measuring range is 0.8-174 nmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference and cross-reactivity studies were conducted using two serum sample
pools, one containing ~10 nmol/L SHBG and the second containing ~70 nmol/L
SHBG were prepared. Aliquots of the samples were spiked with interfering
endogenous and exogenous substances at varying concentrations and run against one
lot of FastPack® reagents on seven FastPack® analyzers in triplicate determinations.
The sponsor defines significant interference as ±10% bias compared to the control
results. The results of the interference study are summarized in the table below:
Highest level demonstrating no
Compound

Conjugated Bilirubin 400 mg/mL
Unconjugated Bilirubin 300 mg/mL
Hemoglobin 10 g/L
Lipid 10 g/L

HAMA interference:
For the human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) interference, two serum sample pools,
one containing ~10 nmol/L SHBG and the second containing ~70 nmol/L SHBG
were prepared. Aliquots of the samples were spiked with concentrations up to 4
µg/mL HAMA and run against one lot of FastPack® reagents on one FastPack®
analyzer in triplicate determinations. In addition, six patient samples (3 HBV-3 HIV
false positive samples which represent specimens with high levels of heterophilic
antibodies) were spiked with either saline (as a control) or heterophilic blocking
reagent to determine the effect of the heterophile activity in relation to the saline
control. The sponsor defines significant interference as ±10% bias as compared to
the control results. Based on the results of these studies, the FastPack® IP Sex
Hormone Binding Globulin Immunoassay did not show HAMA interference up to 4
μg/mL or to the additional heterophile antibodies tested.
High-dose hook effect:
To evaluate the potential for high dose hook effect on the FastPack® IP Sex Hormone
Binding Globulin Immunoassay, samples were prepare to generate SHBG
concentrations values of 2500, 1000, and 400 nmol/L. Each sample was assayed in
triplicate determinations against one FastPack® reagent lot on two FastPack®
analyzers. The results demonstrate that the FastPack® IP Sex Hormone Binding
Globulin Immunoassay displays no hook effect up to and including 1000 nmol/L
SHBG.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed by testing a total of 158 human serum
samples using the candidate device and the predicate device. The serum samples
concentrations ranged between 5.7 to 176 nmol/L SHBG, as determined by the
predicate device. The following results were obtained using Passing-Bablok analysis:
r= 0.985, slope = 0.993 (95% CI: 0.967 to 1.019) , and y-intercept = -0.614 nmol/L
(95%CI: -2.21 to 0.982) .
b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed by testing 54 matched serum and lithium
heparin plasma samples. The samples were tested in singlet determinations on each of
two FastPack® Analyzers against one lot of FastPack® IP Sex Hormone Binding
Globulin Reagents. Passing-Bablok regression was performed using the first replicate
obtained from each matrix and the slope was 0.987, y-intercept = 0.992 nmol/L,
r=0.987 (r2 = 0.973).
The results of the matrix comparison study support the manufacturer’s claim that
serum and lithium heparin plasma are acceptable sample types to use with the
FastPack® IP Sex Hormone Binding Globulin Immunoassay.
