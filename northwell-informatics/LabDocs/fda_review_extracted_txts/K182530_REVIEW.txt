Configuration of the BIOEASY Multi-Drug Test Cup tests can consist of any
combination of the above listed drug analytes.
The test may yield positive results for the prescription drugs Buprenorphine,
Nortriptyline, Oxazepam, Secobarbital, Propoxyphene, and Oxycodone when taken at or
above prescribed doses. It is not intended to distinguish between prescription use or
abuse of these drugs. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is
positive. The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative
chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS or LC/MS
is the preferred confirmatory method.
For in vitro diagnostic use only.
I. Device Description:
The BIOEASY Multi-Drug Test Cup tests are immunochromatographic assays that use a
lateral flow system for the qualitative detection of Amphetamines, Oxazepam, Cocaine,
Marijuana, Methamphetamines, Morphine, Oxycodone, Secobarbital, Buprenorphine,
Methylenedioxy-methamphetamine, Phencyclidine, Methadone, Nortriptyline, and d-
Propoxyphene (target analytes) in human urine. The products are single-use in vitro
diagnostic devices. Each test kit contains a Test Device, a package insert, and a urine cup
for sample collection. Each test device is sealed with a desiccant in an aluminum pouch.

L. Test Principle:
The BIOEASY Multi-Drug Test Cup is a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay.
During testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. If target drugs
present in the urine specimen are below the cut-off concentration, it will not saturate the
binding sites of its specific monoclonal mouse antibody coated on the particles. The
antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a
visible colored line will show up in the test region. The colored line will not form in the
test line region if the target drug level exceeds its cut-off concentration because it will
saturate all the binding sites of the antibody coated on the particles. A band should form
in the control region of the devices regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the
sample to indicate the tests have been performed properly.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical Performance
a. Precision Reproducibility
Precision studies were conducted for samples with concentrations of -100% cut off,
-75% cut off, -50% cut off, -25% cut off, +25% cut off, +50% cut off, +75% cut off
and +100% cut off. The samples were prepared by spiking drug into negative urine
samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by GC/MS. All sample aliquots
were blindly labeled by the person who prepared the samples and did not take part in
the sample testing. For each concentration, tests were performed two runs per day for
25 days per device in a randomized order. The results are summarized in the
following tables:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable, these devices are intended for qualitative use only.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (controls, calibrators, or methods)
The stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to
be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity:
Analytical specificity studies were performed to determine whether drugs and
drug metabolites within the same class of drugs or with similar molecular
structures cross-react in the test systems. Reference standards for the various
metabolites and compounds were prepared at 100 µg/mL in pooled negative
human urine samples. Compounds that tested positive were serially diluted until a
negative result was observed. Results shown are expressed as the minimum
concentration producing a positive result in the indicated assay.

Interference
Potential interfering substances found in human urine of physiological or
pathological conditions were added at a concentration of 100 µg/mL (albumin
was tested at 100 mg/dL) to drug-free urine and urine with target drug
concentrations at 25% below and 25% above Cut-off levels. These urine samples
were tested using three batches of each device. No interference was observed for
any compounds tested, and the list of compounds tested is provided in the
following table:
Acetaminophen β-Estradiol Oxalic acid
Acetophenetidin Erythromycin Oxolinic acid
N-Acetylprocainamide Ethanol Oxymetazoline

f. Effect of Urine Specific Gravity and Urine pH
To investigate potential interferences due to urine specific gravity and urine pH,
urine samples, with 1.000 to 1.035 specific gravity, or urine samples with pH 4 to
9, were spiked with target drugs at 25% below and 25% above Cut-Off levels.
These samples were tested using three lots of each device. For all devices and all
lots tested, results were all positive for samples at +25% Cut-Off and all negative
for samples below 25% Cut-Off.
g. Assay Cut-off
See M.1.a., above.
2. Comparison Studies
Method comparison studies for the BOEASY Multi-Drug Test Cup tests were
performed in-house with three laboratory assistants for each device. Operators ran
80(40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered clinical samples for each target drug. The
samples were blind-labeled and compared to results obtained by LC/MS. The results
are presented in the tables below:

Lay user study
A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 300 lay persons. The lay users
had diverse ages and educational and professional backgrounds. Urine samples were prepared at

drug free pooled specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by LC/MS.
Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers and blind-labeled. Each participant was
