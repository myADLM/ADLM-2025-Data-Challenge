2. Indications for Use:
The StatStrip Xpress 2 Glucose Hospital Meter System is intended for point-of-care, in
vitro diagnostic, multiple-patient use for the quantitative determination of glucose in
capillary finger stick, venous whole blood, arterial whole blood, neonate arterial whole
blood and neonate heel stick specimens throughout all hospital and all professional
healthcare settings including patients receiving intensive medical intervention/therapy.
The system should only be used with single-use, auto-disabling lancing devices when
performing a capillary finger stick or neonate heel stick. It is not intended for use with
neonate cord blood specimens. It is not intended for the screening or diagnosis of
diabetes mellitus but is indicated for use in determining dysglycemia.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
- For prescription use only
- For in vitro diagnostic use only
- The system has not been evaluated for use with neonate venous blood.
- Temperature and humidity extremes - Test results may be inaccurate when test
strips are stored outside of the storage and handling conditions.
- Altitudes above 15,000 feet (4500 meters) above sea level have not been evaluated.
- Specimens - Only fresh whole blood or whole blood collected in lithium heparin
collection devices should be used for arterial and venous specimens.
- Fluoride, EDTA, Sodium, and Ammonium blood collection devices should not be
used.
- Use only whole blood. Do not use serum or plasma.
- Should only be used with single-use, auto-disabling lancing devices
- Caution should be exercised when testing capillary whole blood due to potential
pre-analytical variability in capillary specimen collection.
- A capillary whole blood specimen relies upon an adequate, non-compromised
capillary blood flow. The healthcare provider must be aware that a capillary whole
blood specimen glucose result may not always be the same as an arterial or a
venous whole blood glucose result, especially when the patient’s condition is
rapidly changing.
- If a capillary whole blood glucose result is not consistent with a patient’s clinical
signs and symptoms, glucose testing should be repeated with either an arterial or
venous specimen on the StatStrip Xpress 2 Glucose Hospital Meter System.

L. Test Principle:
The StatStrip Xpress 2 Glucose Hospital Meter System is based on electrochemical biosensor
technology and the principle of capillary action. The system quantitatively measures blood
glucose levels using glucose oxidase enzyme chemistry. The electrons generated during this
reaction are transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant
current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is
converted into a readout displayed on the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
This 510(k) is to expand the indications for use for the StatStrip Xpress 2 Glucose Hospital
Meter System to include capillary whole blood samples for use in all hospitalized patients
based on the clinical studies for the StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter System established in
k181043. The StatStrip Xpress 2 Glucose Hospital Meter uses the exact same technology as
the StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter. Both meters use the Nova StatStrip Glucose Hospital
Meter Test Strips to measure glucose, require the same volume of sample, have the same
glucose measuring range, and have the same indications for use. The systems differ in minor
user preference features that do not impact the usability of the device, such as size of the
meter, data storage specifications, and power source. The analytical performance for the
StatStrip Xpress 2 Glucose Hospital Meter System has been previously established in
