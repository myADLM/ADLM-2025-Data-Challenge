K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI EP05-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement
Methods; Approved Guideline.

Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline.
CLSI EP07-A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline.
L. Test Principle:
The test principle of KET-1 Blood Ketone Monitoring System is based on the amperometry
detection of beta-hydroxybutyrate in whole blood. β-hydroxybutyrate is converted by the
enzyme β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase to acetoacetate. The magnitude of electrical
current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is proportional to the amount of β-
hydroxybutyrate present in the sample. The result is displayed on the meter in mmol/L.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability
Repeatability was assessed using two ketone concentration ranges (1.2 – 0.6 mmol/L
and 1.4 - 2.2 mmol/L) and five lithium heparinized whole blood samples and five
lithium heparinized whole blood samples spiked with β-hydroxybutyrate to create
concentrations of (0.55, 2.17, 3.76, 6.26, and 7.58 mmol/L) and tested on ten KET-1
meters. Ten replicates were tested per meter per concentration with each of the three
lots of the test strips. The results are summarized below:

with 10 meters. Two levels of control solutions were used with β-ketone ranges of
0.2-0.6 mmol/L (Level 1) and 1.4-2.2 mmol/L (Level 2). For each control, ten
replicates were taken each day for ten days, so that 100 individual measurements
were generated per control level. The results from all strip lots are summarized
below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The Linearity of the KET-1 Blood Ketone Monitoring System was evaluated using
Lithium Heparin venous whole blood spiked with β-hydroxybutyrate. Seven whole
blood samples were adjusted to the following β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations:
0.04, 0.51, 2.23, 4.12, 6.03, 7.11, and 8.52 mmol/L. The concentrations were
assigned using the Beckman Coulter UniCel DxC800 Clinical System with
STANBIO β-Hydroxybutyrate LiquiColor Test Kit. The summary of the of the
linear regression analysis for each lot was as follow:
Test Strip Lot Slope y-intercept R value
Lot 1 0.9911 0.0158 0.9985
Lot 2 0.9829 0.0338 0.9983
Lot 3 0.9887 0.0265 0.9984
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed (β-ketone) measuring range of
0.1-0.8 mmol/L.
Validation testing was performed demonstrating that the meter displays ‘HI” when
the measurement result is greater than 8.0 mmol/L and “LOW” when the
measurement result is less than 0.1 mmol/L, as intended.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The KET-1 Blood Ketone Monitoring system is traceable to an in-house standard
prepared from commercially available control materials.
Test strip stability:
The KET-1 Blood Ketone Test Strip are provided in individual foil packages. The
shelf life stability of the foil packaged strips was assessed with real-time testing. The
study protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable to
support the sponsor’s claimed stability of 18 months when stored under
recommended storage conditions of 39°F – 86°F (4-30°C) and relative humidity of
10-85%.

d. Detection limit:
Please refer to Linearity study above, Section M.1.b.
e. Analytical specificity:
To evaluate interference of exogenous and endogenous interfering substances, three
lithium heparinized whole blood samples with ketone concentrations of 0.8 mmol/L,
3.3 mmol/L and 5.8 mmol/L were divided into two aliquots: control (with no added
interferent) and test (with assessed interferent). Each sample was tested using 10
KET-1 meters and the difference between meter results obtained with the test sample
compared to the control samples calculated. The sponsor defined no significant
interference as bias within 0.3 mmol/L for β-ketone < 1.5 mmol/L and
≤ 20% for β-ketone ≥1.5 mmol/L. The following table lists the highest tested
concentration of each substance at which no significant interference was detected.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered in the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study:
The effects of varying hematocrit levels on the measurement of β-ketone concentration
was evaluated using venous whole blood samples with hematocrit levels at 20%, 25%,
30%, 40%, 45%, 50% and 60%. Four different with β-ketone concentrations of 0.4-0.6
mmol/L, 1.5-2.5 mmol/L, 3.5-5.4 mmol/L, and 5.0-6.5 mmol/L were prepared at each of
the four levels with seven hematocrit levels. The β-ketone concentration was measured
using ten KET-1 meters and three test strips. The % bias at each hematocrit level relative
to the result obtained STANBIO β-Hydroxybutyrate LiquiColor Test Kit was calculated.
The result support the claimed acceptance hematocrit range of 20-60%.
2. Altitude Study:
An altitude/oxygen dependability study was performed to assess the effect of low
oxygen levels when the system is used at elevations above sea level. For testing two
levels sea level (0 and 10, 335 feet). Venous whole blood samples at five levels
approximately 0.5, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0 and 7.5 mmol/L and two levels of KET-1 control
solution were tested at sea level and 10, 335 feet elevation. Twenty ketone readings per
ketone level were taken at each of the two elevations. The results demonstrated
acceptable bias to support the claim that altitude up to 10, 335 feet have no significance
effect on β -Ketone measurement when measured with KET-1 monitoring system.

--- Page 10 ---
3. Operating Conditions Study:
The sponsor performed testing in operating condition studies to evaluate the operating
temperature and relative humidity (RH) ranges. Venous whole blood samples with β -
Ketone concentrations ranges of 0.47 mmol/L, 2.21 mmol/L, 3.76 mmol/L 6.15 mmol/L
were tested. Each sample was tested at the combined temperature and humidity
conditions shown below using 10 KET-1 meters, and 3 lots of KET-1 test strip. The
results obtained on the KET-1 Blood Ketone meter were compared to results obtained
using the STANBIO β-Hydroxybutyrate LiquiColor Test Kit.
Temperature 10, 20, 25, 30, 40±2°C at 45-55%RH
20%±5% at 10°C and 400C
Relative Humidity 50%±5% at 25°C
90%±5% at 10°C and 40°C
The results support the sponsor’s claimed operating temperature range of 50-104°F (10°C
– 40°C) and 20-90% RH.
4. Sample Volume Study:
A sample volume study was conducted to verify the minimum sample volume required
for the KET-1 monitoring system. Venous whole blood samples were tested at 0.6 µL,
0.7 µL, 0.8 µL, 0.9 µL and 10 µL volume. Samples had concentration of (0.50 mmol/L,
3.91 mmol/L, 7.44mmol/L). Testing was performed using 10 test strips for each of three
lots of test strips for each test volume and each ketone level. Results from the study
support the claimed sample volume of 0.8 µL.
5. Electromagnetic Compatibility:
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing
had been performed and the KET-1 Monitoring System was found compliant.
6. Infection Control Studies:
This device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies
were previously performed (k131750) on the materials comprising the meter by an
outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B
virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes
(EPA Registration # 67619-12-5813). Robustness testing was conducted by the sponsor
demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of the
meter after 1825 cleaning and disinfection cycles with Clorox Healthcare Bleach
Germicidal Wipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 5 years of single-
patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning
and disinfection procedures.
