H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The GenMark ePlex Blood Culture Identification Gram-Negative (BCID-GN) Panel is a
qualitative nucleic acid multiplex in vitro diagnostic test intended for use on GenMark’s
ePlex Instrument for simultaneous qualitative detection and identification of multiple
potentially pathogenic gram-negative bacterial organisms and select determinants associated
with antimicrobial resistance in positive blood culture. In addition, the ePlex BCID-GN
Panel is capable of detecting several gram-positive bacteria (Pan Gram-Positive assay) and
several Candida species (Pan Candida assay). The ePlex BCID-GN Panel is performed
directly on blood culture samples identified as positive by a continuous monitoring blood
culture system and which contain gram-negative organism.
The following bacterial organisms and genes associated with antibiotic resistance are
identified using the ePlex BCID-GN Panel: Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacteroides fragilis,
Citrobacter, Cronobacter sakazakii, Enterobacter cloacae complex, Enterobacter (non-
cloacae complex), Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium
nucleatum, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae group,
Morganella morganii, Neisseria meningitidis, Proteus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Salmonella, Serratia, Serratia marcescens, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia,
CTX-M (bla ), IMP (bla ) , KPC (bla ) , NDM (bla ), OXA (bla ) (OXA-23
CTX-M IMP KPC NDM OXA
and OXA-48 groups only), and VIM (bla ).
VIM
The ePlex BCID-GN Panel contains assays for the detection of genetic determinants
associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents including CTX-M(bla ), which is
CTX-M
associated with resistance to extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-mediated resistance
to penicillins, cephalosporins and monobactams, as well as OXA (bla ) (OXA-23 and
OXA
OXA-48 groups only), KPC (bla ), and metallo-beta-lactamases IMP (bla ), VIM
KPC IMP
(bla ), and NDM (bla ), which is associated with carbapenemase-mediated resistance.
VIM NDM
The antimicrobial resistance gene detected may or may not be associated with the agent
responsible for disease. Negative results for these select antimicrobial resistance assays do
not indicate susceptibility, as there are multiple mechanisms of resistance in gram-negative
bacteria.
The ePlex BCID-GN Panel also contains targets designed to detect a broad range of
organisms with a potentially misleading Gram stain result or organisms that may be missed
by Gram staining altogether, for example in the case of co-infections. These include a broad
Pan Gram-Positive assay (which is designed to detect Bacillus cereus group, Bacillus subtilis
group, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus), as well as a Pan Candida assay,
which is designed to detect four Candida species: Candida albicans, Candida glabrata,
Candida krusei, and Candida parapsilosis.
The detection and identification of specific bacterial and fungal nucleic acids from

--- Page 3 ---
individuals exhibiting signs and/or symptoms of bloodstream infection aids in the diagnosis
of bloodstream infection when used in conjunction with other clinical information. The
results from the ePlex BCID-GN Panel are intended to be interpreted in conjunction with
Gram stain results and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other
patient management decisions.
Negative results in the setting of a suspected bloodstream infection may be due to infection
with pathogens that are not detected by this test. Positive results do not rule out co-infection
with other organisms; the organism(s) detected by the ePlex BCID-GN Panel may not be the
definite cause of disease. Additional laboratory testing (e.g. sub-culturing of positive blood
cultures for identification of organisms not detected by ePlex BCID-GN Panel and for
susceptibility testing, differentiation of mixed growth, and association of antimicrobial
resistance marker genes to a specific organism) and clinical presentation must be taken into
consideration in the final diagnosis of bloodstream infection.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
Limitations:
• This product should not be used with blood culture media that contains charcoal.
• Bacterial and fungal nucleic acids may be present in blood culture, independent of
bacterial or fungal viability. Detection of an assay target does not guarantee that the
corresponding bacteria or fungi are infectious or are the causative agents for clinical
symptoms.
• Decreased sensitivity has been observed for some targets in BD BACTEC Lytic
Anaerobic blood culture bottles.
• In mixed cultures, the ePlex BCID-GN Panel may not identify all organisms in the
specimen, depending upon the concentration of each target present.
• Antimicrobial resistance can occur via multiple mechanisms. A “Not Detected” result
for the BCID-GP antimicrobial resistance gene assays does not indicate antimicrobial
susceptibility. Subculturing and standard susceptibility testing of isolates is required
to determine antimicrobial susceptibility.
• The BCID-GN Pan Candida and Pan Gram-Positive assays are designed to detect
Candida and gram-positive microorganisms in mixed blood cultures where these
microorganisms might be missed by Gram stain. Lower than expected clinical
sensitivity was observed for these analytes, which was likely due to the presence of
Candida spp. or gram-positive microorganisms in mixed cultures at concentrations
below the respective limits of detection for the Pan Candida and Pan GP targets.

--- Page 4 ---
• For Enterococcus saccharolyticus, Serratia odorifera, and Streptococcus thoraltensis,
100% detection was not observed at expected bottle positivity concentrations.
Decreased sensitivity may be observed for these strains.
• False negative results may occur for specimens containing Fusobacterium
necrophorum because the assay’s limit of detection for F. necrophorum can be near
the concentration observed at the time of bottle positivity.
4. Special instrument requirements:
GenMark ePlex Instrument and Software
I. Device Description:
The ePlex Blood Culture Identification Gram-Negative (BCID-GN) Panel is based on the
principles of competitive nucleic acid hybridization using a sandwich assay format, wherein a
single-stranded target binds concurrently to a sequence-specific solution-phase signal probe and
a solid-phase electrode-bound capture probe. The test employs nucleic acid extraction, target
amplification via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription (RT-PCR) and
hybridization of target DNA. In the process, the double-stranded PCR amplicons are digested
with exonuclease to generate single-stranded DNA suitable for hybridization.
Nucleic acid extraction from biological specimens occurs within the cartridge via cell lysis,
nucleic acid capture onto magnetic beads, and release for amplification. The nucleic acid
extraction is processed through microfluidic liquid handling. Once the nucleic acid targets are
captured and inhibitors are washed away, the magnetic particles are delivered to the
electrowetting environment on the printed circuit board (PCB) and the targets are eluted from the
particles and amplified.
During hybridization, the single-stranded target DNA binds to a complementary, single-stranded
capture probe immobilized on the working gold electrode surface. Single-stranded signal proves
(labeled with electrochemically active ferrocenes) bind to specific target sequence/region
adjacent to the capture probe. Simultaneous hybridization of target to signal probes and capture
probe is detected by alternating current voltammetry (ACV). Each working electrode on the
array contains specific capture probes, and sequential analysis of each electrode allows detection
of multiple analyte targets.
A summary of microorganisms and resistance markers detected by the ePlex BCID-GN Panel are
presented in Table 1:

Genus and group assay result interpretation
While many results on the ePlex BCID-GN Panel are based on a single assay, the ePlex
BCID-GN Panel uses two assays for each of the Proteus and Serratia results.
The ePlex BCID-GN Proteus result is based on two assays: the species-specific Proteus
mirabilis and the broad Proteus assay. The broad Proteus assay will detect Proteus mirabilis,
however, its primary purpose is to detect non-mirabilis Proteus species. See Table 3 for
detailed Proteus target call logic.

The ePlex BCID-GN Serratia result is based on two assays: the species-specific Serratia
marcescens and the broad Serratia assay. The broad Serratia assay will detect Serratia
marcescens, however, its primary purpose is to detect Serratia species other than Serratia
marcescens. See Table 4 for detailed Serratia target call logic.

L. Test Principle:
The ePlex instrument automates all aspects of sample processing and nucleic acid testing in a
single cartridge associated with the ePlex BCID-GN Panel. Multiple bloodstream pathogens can
be detected from a single blood culture specimen. Automation of DNA extraction, amplification,
and target detection is accomplished within the cartridge using a combination of electrowetting
and GenMark’s eSensor technology. Electrowetting, or digital microfluidics, uses electrical
fields to directly manipulate discrete droplets on the surface of a hydrophobically coated printed
circuit board (PCB). Sample and reagents are moved in a programmable fashion in the ePlex
cartridge to complete all portions of the sample processing and detection. eSensor technology is
based on the principles of competitive DNA hybridization and electrochemical detection, which
is highly specific and is not based on fluorescent or optical detection.
A sample is loaded onto the ePlex cartridge and nucleic acids are extracted and purified from the
specimen via magnetic solid phase extraction. PCR is used to create double-stranded DNA,
which is treated with exonuclease to create single-stranded DNA in preparation for eSensor
detection.
The target DNA is mixed with ferrocene-labeled signal probes that are complementary to the
specific targets on the panel. Target DNA hybridizes to its complementary signal probe and
target-specific capture probes, which are bound to gold-plated electrodes, forming a
hybridization complex as shown below in Figure 1. The presence of each target is determined by
voltammetry which generates specific electrical signals from the ferrocene-labeled signal probe.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A multisite reproducibility study was conducted at three testing sites (two external sites
and one internal site). The study evaluated multiple sources of variability, such as site-to-
site, lot-to-lot, day-to-day, and operator-to-operator variability. One ePlex instrument
with four towers was used at each study site. Two operators each tested the
reproducibility panel at each site on five nonconsecutive days with three unique lots of
ePlex BCID-GN Panel cartridges.
The reproducibility panel consisted of a seven-member test panel comprised of six panel
members representing 17 BCID-GN analytes (including five resistance markers) and one
panel member containing an off-panel organism, Cutibacterium granulosum.
Panel members were prepared by spiking cultured isolates into negative blood culture
matrix (NBM). The NBM was prepared by incubating 10 mL of negative whole blood in
BD BACTEC Standard/10 Aerobic/F blood culture bottles per the manufacturer’s
instructions for a minimum of eight hours on a continuous monitoring blood culture
system. After incubation and prior to use in analytical studies, the NBM was pre-screened
to ensure the matrix is negative for all BCID-GN targets.
Each of the on-panel organisms was evaluated at two concentrations: (1) Bottle positivity

--- Page 13 ---
and (2) One log higher than bottle positivity (to mimic organism concentrations present
after eight hours additional incubation on the blood culture instrument).
The organisms and concentrations evaluated in the study are summarized in Table 8.

The seven panel members were tested 108 times each (excluding repeat testing): 3
replicates x 3 sites x 2 operators x 3 lots x 2 days of testing/operator/lot, for a minimum
number of 756 tests.
A summary of results for the ePlex BCID-GN Panel reproducibility study is provided in
Table 9. For the negative panel member, 100% of replicates generated the expected
negative results for all ePlex BCID-GN Panel analytes.

false positive results were observed (i.e., Pan Gram-Positive and Acinetobacter
baumannii targets), external controls containing those targets were also tested. These
results suggest a potential site-specific root cause (e.g., site-specific contamination) rather
than a systematic performance issue with the BCID-GN Panel.
During the study, 812 runs were attempted with six pre-flight check failures (1.2% pre-
flight errors) for which a new cartridge had to be tested. The pre-flight check is an ePlex
system process that tests the integrity of the cartridge/instrument interface prior to
initiating sample processing. An additional 10 runs were aborted by the system (1.2%
system abort errors) resulting in 796 completed runs, including repeat runs due to invalid
results.
Of the 756 samples initially tested, 715 (94.6%) had valid results and 41 (5.4%) had
invalid results. Of the 40 samples re-tested, 39 had valid results and 1 had a second
invalid result upon re-test. The final validity rate (95% CI) was 99.7% (99.0%-99.9%).

Internal Controls
Each ePlex BCID-GN Panel cartridge includes internal controls that monitor performance
of each step of the testing process, including extraction, amplification and detection of
DNA targets.
Each of the eight amplification reactions has an internal control, and in each reaction,
either the internal control or a target must generate signal above the defined threshold for
a valid test result. Internal control results are interpreted by the ePlex Software and
displayed on the ePlex BCID-GN Panel Reports as Internal Control with a result of
PASS, FAIL, N/A, or INVALID. Table 10 includes details on the interpretation of
Internal Control results.

External Controls
External controls are not provided with the ePlex BCID-GN Panel; however, the package
insert includes the following recommendations for external controls:
• Positive and negative external controls should be tested with each new lot of
reagents or monthly, whichever occurs first. Blood culture medium can be used
as the negative control. Previously characterized positive samples or blood
culture medium spiked with well characterized organisms can be used as the
external positive control. External controls should be run in accordance with
laboratory protocols and accrediting organizations, as applicable.
During the prospective clinical evaluation of the ePlex BCID-GN Panel, each testing site
was provided with positive and negative external control samples. There were four
organism mixes that served as positive controls and were prepared at concentrations near
or below the concentration expected at bottle positivity. Negative blood culture matrix
was used as the negative control. At least one positive and one negative external control
were tested each day and cycled throughout the clinical study. The control mixes are
described in Table 11.

Specimen stability
Clinical specimen stability claims were supported by an analytical study that investigated
the effect of different specimen storage conditions/time periods on specimen integrity for
specimens tested with the ePlex BCID-GN Panel. Three organism mixes containing
representative targets from each of the eight multiplex primer pools on the ePlex BCID-
GN Panel were used for this study. Organism mixes whose members were at
concentrations consistent with those observed at bottle positivity were stored at ≤-80°C,
≤-20°C, 2-8°C, and at ambient temperature over several time points.
Baseline condition (T ) was established with 20 replicates. Ten replicates were tested
0
for each additional temperature and time point. All test conditions that were assessed
in this study are summarized in Table 12.

positivity positivity
The specimen stability criteria were as follows:
• Performance at each time point will be considered acceptable if the positivity rate
for each analyte (either from the first 10 replicates or from the final 20 replicates
in case of additional testing) is equivalent to the positivity rate for the
corresponding analyte at time point T (baseline time point).
0
• If a time point did not meet the positivity acceptance criteria, the next time point
was evaluated. If the subsequent time point met the acceptance criteria, the study
was continued. If two consecutive time points failed, the specimen stability was
determined to be the last time point when the acceptance criteria were met.

Freeze-thaw Study
An analytical study was conducted to demonstrate the stability of clinical specimens after
subjecting samples to one or two freeze-thaw cycles prior to testing on the BCID-GN
Panel. One hundred and ten positive clinical samples representing 20 targeted analytes
were tested fresh during the BCID-GN clinical study and selected to represent a variety
of organisms present in positive blood cultures. All specimens contained gram-negative
organisms on Gram stain. Samples were frozen at ≤-70°C and then subjected to one or
two thawing cycles, followed by testing with the BCID-GN Panel. Study results are
summarized in Table 15.

*There was only one sample tested for the KPC target. Therefore, the nA value is the actual observed value.
A. Four samples had false positive results but all expected targets were detected.
i. Under the 1X freeze-thaw condition, one positive Enterobacter cloacae complex sample detected Enterobacter cloacae
complex and OXA, making OXA a false positive result.
ii. Under the 1X freeze-thaw condition, one positive Pan Candida sample detected Pan Candida and Pan Gram-Positive,
making Pan Gram-Positive a false positive result.
iii. Under the 2X freeze-thaw condition, one positive Pseudomonas aeruginosa sample detected Pseudomonas aeruginosa
and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, making Stenotrophomonas maltophilia a false positive result.
iv. Under the 2X freeze-thaw condition, one positive Klebsiella pneumoniae sample detected Klebsiella pneumoniae and
OXA, making OXA a false positive result.
Data from the freeze-thaw study support that clinical specimens are stable up to two
freeze-thaw cycles and frozen specimens and previously frozen specimens are acceptable

for testing with the ePlex BCID-GN Panel.
Open Pouch Stability Study In-Consumable Sample Stability Study
An analytical study was conducted to demonstrate that the ePlex BC-GN cartridge (after
the pouch has been opened) can be exposed to ambient conditions for up to two hours
before loading the sample and testing on the ePlex instrument.
A second study was conducted to demonstrate that the cartridge can be stored at room
temperature (15–30ºC) for two hours after the sample has been loaded but prior to
running the cartridge in an ePlex bay.
For these two studies, the test panel was comprised of four organisms representing six of
the eight multiplex primer pools and covering six targets on the ePlex BCID-GN Panel.
Each organism was tested at a concentration approximating bottle positivity.
A total of 20 control replicates were also run for each organism. Control samples were
loaded within 20 minutes after pouch opening and were run on the ePlex instrument
within 20 minutes of sample loading.
The open pouch stability study demonstrated that ePlex BCID-GN cartridges are stable
for up to 2 hours at room temperature after the pouch has been opened and prior to testing
on the ePlex instrument. Results from the study are presented in Table 16.

d. Bottle Positivity: Organism Concentration Study
To approximate organism concentrations that may be present in positive blood culture
bottles in a clinical setting, a study was conducted to establish the range of expected
organism concentrations present in incubated blood cultures at bottle positivity (i.e.,
bottle ring) and eight hours after bottle positivity/bottle “ring.” Representative organisms
were evaluated, consisting of 14 genera that are detected by the ePlex BCID-GN Panel.
The volume of negative human whole blood, determined by the manufacturer’s
instructions, was inoculated into each organism-appropriate bottle and incubated to bottle
positivity and bottle positivity plus eight hours on a continuously monitoring blood
culture system. At the time of positivity (and eight hours after positivity), the blood
culture was removed from the instrument for determination of organism concentration
(CFU/mL using a standard plate counting method) and ePlex BCID Panel testing. All
estimated bottle positivity concentrations are equivalent or greater than the established
Limit of Detection (LOD) for each of the assays of the ePlex BCID-GP Panel. The
following bottle types were used for the study: BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F blood
culture bottle (E. faecium, S. aureus, S. anginosus, A. baumannii, E. cloacae, E. coli, H.
influenzae, K. oxytoca, N. meningitidis, P. aeruginosa, and S. marcescens), and BD
BACTEC Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F (B. fragilis and F. nucleatum). Table 18 summarizes the
concentration present at bottle positivity and bottle positivity plus eight hours for each
organism evaluated.

e. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) was determined for each analyte/group on the ePlex BCID-
GN Panel using samples prepared in negative blood culture matrix consisting of EDTA
human whole blood (amount consistent with the bottle manufacturer recommendations)
spiked into a blood culture bottle and incubated for a minimum of eight hours in a
continuously monitoring blood culture instrument. Quantitation of organism preparations
was determined in CFU/mL using plating and colony count methods. Analytes were
pooled together and serially diluted to create organism mixes containing no more than
five organisms in negative blood/blood culture matrix. A minimum of 20 replicates per
organism mix were tested to confirm the final LoD for each assay target. The limit of
detection was defined as the lowest concentration at which each target is detected at least
95% of the time.
Results from the study demonstrated that all targets were detected in ≥95% of tested
replicates at ≤1 x 108 CFU/mL for bacterial and resistance marker targets and ≤1 x 106
CFU/mL for fungal targets. It is noted that the LoD for Fusobacterium necrophorum
approximates the concentration for this organism present at bottle positivity.
The confirmed LoD for ePlex BCID-GN Panel organism and resistance marker targets
are shown in Table 19.

f. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)
The analytical reactivity of the BCID-GN Panel was evaluated using a collection of 336
bacterial and fungal strains/isolates. Organisms were tested at concentrations expected at
bottle positivity with bacteria tested at 1 x 109 CFU/mL or lower and fungal strains tested
at 1 x 106 CFU/mL. For organisms that were not evaluated in the bottle positivity study,
test samples were prepared at 4.5x108 CFU/mL (i.e., average concentrations for all gram-
negative organisms evaluated in the bottle positivity study). Each strain evaluated for
inclusivity was tested in triplicate and if not detected in initial testing, the strain was
retested at a higher concentration. If detected at the high concentration(s), the
species/isolate is indicated as detected with reduced sensitivity and the concentration is
indicated in footnotes under Table 20 below. All strains evaluated generated ‘detected’
results by the ePlex BCID-GN Panel with the following exceptions:
• Strains of Citrobacter amalonaticus, Citrobacter farmer, Citrobacter gillenii,
Citrobacter murliniae and Citrobacter sedlakii were not detected by the BCID-
GN Panel at any concentration evaluated (up to 1x 109 CFU/mL).
• Enterobacter kobei and Enterobacter cancerogenous were not detected by the
ePlex BCID-GN Panel.
• Enterobacter cowanii was not detected by the ePlex BCID-GN Enterobacter non-
cloacae complex assay. Instead, this species generated detected results with the
Enterobacter cloacae complex. It is noted that this species is not included in the
Enterobacter cloacae complex.
• The Pan Gram-positive assay target may have reduced sensitivity for

Streptococcus thoraltensis and Enterococcus saccharolyticus (1/6 replicates
detected for both organisms at 1 x 107 CFU/mL). Additional testing at 4 x 108
(Streptococcus thoraltensis) and 1x 108 (Enterococcus saccharolyticus) generated
3/3 replicates detected for the Pan Gram-positive target.
• For one strain each of Enterobacter amnigenus and Morganella morganii, two of
three initially tested replicates were detected. Additional testing for each strain
generated positive results for three additional replicates for a total of five of six
replicates tested.
• One strain of Serratia odorifera was not detected at 1 x 108 CFU/mL and was
detected in only one of three replicates at 1 x 109 CFU/mL. In silico analysis
suggest that this species will not be detected by the BCID-GN Panel.
• In initial testing of samples prepared at 1 x 106 CFU/mL, the Pan Candida target
was detected for one of six replicate samples containing Candida krusei (ATCC
34135) and two of six replicates of Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 90018).
Additional testing was performed with blood culture samples from culture bottles
grown on a blood culture instrument until bottle positivity. For this additional
testing, the Pan Candida target was detected for all six replicates of each Candida
strain.
Organisms and associated resistance markers evaluated in the analytical reactivity study
and detected by the ePlex BCID-GN Panel are shown in Table 20. Additional strains
were evaluated as part of the LoD study (See Table 19).

Predicted reactivity (In silico analysis), genus and group assays
In silico analysis was performed for the broader genus or group-level assays of the ePlex
BCID-GN Panel including: Citrobacter, Enterobacter cloacae complex, Enterobacter
non-cloacae complex, Proteus, Serratia, Pan Candida, and Pan Gram-Positive assays.
Tables 21-28 below include results from this analysis including species for which
detection is predicted, species for which detection is predicted for a percentage of strain
sequences, and species for which detection is not predicted.
Note: The performance of the ePlex BCID-GN Panel has not been established for the
organisms listed in the tables below with the exception of species that were evaluated in
the analytical reactivity study which are indicated with an asterisk.

Predicted Reactivity (In silico analysis) for resistance markers
Known variants of the six resistance markers reported by the ePlex BCID-GN Panel were
each assessed for predicted reactivity using in silico analysis. BLAST searches to support
in silico analyses were conducted in March 2018; therefore, any new resistance gene
variants deposited into GenBank after March 2018 have not been evaluated.

Tables 29-39 below describe the predicted reactivity for CTX-M, IMP, KPC, NDM,
OXA, and VIM resistance marker assays of the ePlex BCID GN Panel. Strains that were
tested as part of the Inclusivity study are marked with an asterisk. Table 40 includes all
variants that are not predicted to be detected by the ePlex BCID-GN Panel.
The CTX-M assay on the ePlex BCID-GN Panel is designed to detect the following
CTX-M groups: CTX-M-1, CTX-M-2, CTX-M-8, CTX-M-9, and CTX-M-25. Results
from in silico results for variants included in each of these CTX-M groups are presented
in Table 29-33.

g. Analytical Specificity (Cross-Reactivity/Exclusivity)
The analytical specificity of the BCID-GN Panel was assessed by examining the potential
for cross-reactivity of on-panel and off-panel analytes. Cross-reactivity of on-panel
analytes was evaluated using data from the analytical reactivity study (See Table 20).
Bacterial and fungal analytes were diluted and tested in triplicate at bottle positive
concentrations. Cross reactivity was not observed for any of the on-panel organism strain
with the exception of one strain of K. pneumoniae for which NDM was unexpectedly
detected in all three replicates. The root cause of the detected NDM was not confirmed
with an alternate PCR assay; however, it is not likely that K. pneumoniae cross-reacts
with the NDM target of the BCID-GN Panel based on results from 32 additional strains
of K. pneumoniae that did not demonstrate cross-reactivity for NDM.
A total of 128 off-panel bacterial and fungal strains were tested in triplicate at ~1x109
CFU/mL and ~1x107 CFU/mL, respectively. If these target concentrations could not be
obtained, the organism was diluted 2-fold from the stock for use (indicated with an
asterisk in Tables 41-44 below); these concentrations were at least as high as
concentrations present at bottle positivity (1 x 108 CFU/mL for bacteria and 1 x 106
CFU/mL for fungi).
The following off-panel species demonstrated cross reactivity with ePlex BCID-GN
Panel targets:
• Acinetobacter anitratus (at a concentration of >1x104 CFU/mL) cross-reacts with
the BCID-GN Acinetobacter baumannii assay
• Enterobacter cowanii (at a concentration of >1x108 CFU/mL) cross-reacts with
the BCID-GN Enterobacter cloacae complex assay
• Escherichia hermanii cross-reacts with the BCID-GN Enterobacter (non-cloacae
complex) assay (at a concentration of >1x106 CFU/mL) and with the BCID-GN
Serratia assay (at a concentration of >1x107 CFU/mL)
• Fusobacterium periodonticum (at a concentration of 5x108 CFU/mL) and
Fusobacterium simiae (at a concentration of 2.9x108 CFU/mL) cross-react with
the BCID-GN Fusobacterium nucleatum assay
• Shigella (at a concentration of 1x109 CFU/mL) cross-reacts with the BCID-GN
Escherichia coli assay.
Off-panel organisms demonstrating cross-reactivity with ePlex BCID-GN Panel targets
are bolded in Tables 41-44 below.

h. Interfering Substances:
At total of 18 substances that could be present in blood culture specimens or introduced
during sample handling were evaluated for potential interference with performance of the
BCID-GN Panel. Each endogenous or exogenous substances was added to simulated
positive blood culture samples which contained simulated blood culture matrix (human
whole blood that had been incubated in a blood culture bottle) and one of three different
organism mixes. Each mix contained organisms inoculated at concentrations equivalent
to bottle positivity. Potentially interfering substances were spiked at medically relevant
concentrations and were evaluated both without organism with all testing performed in
triplicate. On each day of testing, each organism mix was evaluated without any
interfering substance to serve as a positive control (no interference) to which the test
specimens were compared.

None of the 18 substances commonly found in blood culture specimens or as medications
commonly used to treat skin or blood infections were found to inhibit the ePlex BCID-
GN Panel. Two substances required further dilution of the substance under evaluation to
determine the final concentration for which interference is no longer observed.
Caspofungin was diluted from 5 µg/mL to 4.5 µg/mL and γ-globulin was diluted from 1.7
g/dL to 0.85 g/dL. The final testing concentration of caspofungin and γ-globulin are
above the clinically relevant concentration of those individuals suspected of having a
bloodstream infection.

i. Competitive Inhibition:
A competitive inhibition study was conducted to evaluate the possibility of high
concentration organisms interfering with the detection of lower concentrations targets in
the same blood culture specimen. Four organism mixes covering eight clinically relevant
co-infection organisms including both on and off-panel analytes were selected for the
study based on those identified in the peer-reviewed literature as common polymicrobial
co-infections. The four mixes were used to formulate test case scenarios by pairing one
mix with organisms at bottle positive concentrations with a second mix with organism at
concentrations typically present at bottle positivity plus eight hours. Testing was
performed in triplicate for each test condition. A summary of the organisms and test
concentrations evaluated in the study is presented in Table 49. Testing generated 100%
detected results for all targeted organisms. There were no false positive results for
samples with the non-targeted organism, Corynebacterium striatum. The study results
demonstrated the ability of the ePlex BCID-GN Panel to detect two clinically relevant co-
infecting organisms in a specimen at both high and low concentrations. Detailed study
results are presented in Table 50.

with the ePlex BCID-GN panel. Results from this study will be used to support the
analytical performance claims of the ePlex BCID-GN Panel as well as to assess for the
potential presence of non-viable organisms or organism nucleic acids in blood culture
media for each bottle type.
Testing was performed using three organism mixes with organism concentrations
approximating bottle positivity. Each of the blood culture bottle types were tested with
the manufacturer’s recommended ratio of human whole blood to media. The organisms
evaluated that were also used for the competitive inhibition study, represent each of the
eight multiplex primer amplification pools on the BCID-GN Panel. Two lots of the 13
different blood culture bottles were evaluated using five replicates of the three organism
mixes. Three negative control (negative blood matrix, no organism mix) replicates were
also tested per lot of each bottle type. The thirteen bottle types evaluated are listed in
Table 51 below.
Twelve of the bottle types evaluated showed no interference for any of the targets tested.
One of three lots of the BACTEC Lytic Anaerobic bottles tested showed reduced
sensitivity (i.e., false negative results) in initial testing for four analytes. Additional
replicates tested with a new bottle lot generated the expected positive results. The
following are the results observed for BACTEC Lytic Anaerobic bottles for the initially
discordant analytes:
• Pan Candida was not detected in 2/15 sample replicates
• Enterobacter cloacae was not detected in 1/15 sample replicates
• Escherichia coli was not detected in 1/15 sample replicates
• CTX-M was not detected in 2/15 sample replicates
A limitation is included in the package insert stating that the ePlex BCID-GN Panel may
have reduced sensitivity with BACTEC Lytic Anaerobic bottles.

* 2/15 replicates were false negative for Pan Candida; 1/15 replicates was false negative for Enterobacter cloacae; 1/15 replicates

k. Carry-Over/Cross-contamination:
Potential run-to-run carryover or cross-contamination was evaluated by determining
whether a high positive sample in one cartridge would cause false positive results in
subsequently tested cartridges. It is noted that the configuration of the ePlex instrument
mitigates the risk for carry-over/cross-contamination because each bay functions
independently and is physically separated from other bays, therefore, not allowing
cartridges to interact with one another. The carry-over/cross-contamination rate of the
ePlex BCID-GN Panel and ePlex Instrument was tested in a checker board approach by
running high positive and negative samples interspersed in all towers of a four-tower
ePlex instrument over five consecutive runs on separate days. The high positive sample
consisted of a multi-organism mix of four bacterial and one fungal species, covering eight
assay targets, prepared at concentrations higher than typically found in positive blood
cultures (i.e., 1 x 109 CFU/mL for bacteria and 1 x 107 CFU/mL for fungi). Negative
blood culture matrix was used for negative samples.
Testing resulted in detection of all expected targets for samples containing organism. No
carry-over/cross-contamination (i.e., no false positive results) was observed when testing
consecutively within bays or in adjacent bays over 120 total runs.

Assay cutoff analysis was conducted to define signal boundaries that would discriminate
between positive and negative detections for each ePlex BCID-GN Panel analyte and for
the internal control. Clinical specimens, contrived positive blood culture specimens, and
organisms spiked at or above the determined LoD were used to establish assay-cutoffs.
Contrived samples were prepared by spiking organisms at low concentrations into
simulated negative blood culture matrix and grown to bottle positivity on a blood culture
continuous monitoring system. An appropriate boundary was established per target
wherein specificity (limit the number of potential false positives) and sensitivity (limit the
number of potential false negatives) were maximized and verified by ROC analysis. The
boundary set points that were determined during the cutoff study are listed in Table 52.

specimens were prospectively collected and frozen prior to testing and 171 specimens were
prospectively collected and tested fresh (never frozen) for a total of 354 specimens tested
across the 2 phases. One specimen was withdrawn due to organism identification from
unacceptable methods. Of the 353 prospectively-collected specimens eligible for testing, 349
were evaluable (i.e., valid ePlex BCID-GN Panel results and a valid comparator result). Four
specimens were not evaluable as they did not generate valid ePlex BCID-GN Panel results
and were excluded from performance evaluations.
To supplement the prospective study for low prevalence organism targets, a total of 578
positive blood culture specimens (577 evaluable) were collected from 10 collection sites and
retrospectively tested. One specimen was not evaluable because it did not have a final, valid
ePlex BCID-GN Panel result and was excluded from performance evaluations.

The performance of the ePlex BCID-GN Panel for organism targets was evaluated in
comparison to results from standard laboratory procedures for identification of blood culture
isolates. Comparator testing included traditional and automated identification methods,
MALDI-TOF, as well as microbiological and biochemical techniques. Identification for
specimens with Acinetobacter baumannii (to distinguish between other Acinetobacter
species) or Candida parapsilosis (to distinguish between C. parapsilosis, C. metapsilosis and
C. orthopsilosis) identified by standard laboratory procedures was confirmed using
analytically validated PCR assays followed by bi-directional sequencing. For antimicrobial
resistance markers, results from the ePlex BCID-GN Panel were compared to analytically
validated qPCR amplification assays followed by bi-directional sequencing in specimens
with an applicable organism identified by culture.
The comparator methods used in the study for each ePlex BCID-GN Panel target are
summarized in Table 56.

Positive percent agreement (PPA) was calculated by dividing the number of true positive
(TP) results by the sum of TP and false negative (FN) results, while negative percent
agreement (NPA) was calculated by dividing the number of true negative (TN) results by the
sum of TN and false positive (FP) results. A TP result being defined as a specimen where the
detected ePlex BCID-GN Panel result matched the identified/detected comparator method
result, while a TN result was one where a negative ePlex BCID-GN Panel result matched a
negative comparator method result. The two-sided 95% confidence interval was also
calculated.

A total of 777 contrived blood culture specimens were evaluated to supplement the
prospective and retrospective specimen cohorts for low prevalence organism and
resistance markers. Contrived specimens were prepared by spiking low concentrations of
organism into blood culture bottle types appropriate for the organism being evaluated.
Each bottle was also inoculated with human whole blood at volumes recommended by
the bottle manufacturer. Bottles were incubated on a continuously monitoring blood
culture system until flagged as positive. Contrived specimens were removed from the
system within eight hours of positivity and stored frozen until the time of testing.
Contrived specimens were batched together and tested along with other clinical

Performance of the ePlex BCID-GN Panel for the Pan Candida and Pan Gram-Positive assay
targets is summarized in Table 79 below. In addition to the evaluable prospective and
retrospective specimens that contained gram-negative organisms by Gram stain (Intended use
population), the clinical performance of the Pan Candida and Pan Gram-Positive targets was
evaluated with an additional 741 non-intended use retrospective specimens that contained
gram-positive or fungal organisms by Gram stain; these specimens are denoted as
retrospective (non-intended use) specimens and were used to supplement the prospective
intended use specimens.
Pan Candida target performance: For the intended use population (specimens with gram-
negative organisms observed by Gram stain), there were eight specimens with targeted
Candida species identified by the comparator method. All eight specimens were mixed
cultures, including three specimens with false negative results for the ePlex BCID-GN Pan
Candida assay.
It is noted that the Pan Candida assay is designed to detect only four Candida species
(Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. krusei). In the clinical study there
were six specimens for which non-targeted Candida species were identified either by

comparator testing or PCR/sequencing performed during discordant analysis. The non-
targeted Candida species identified in these six specimens included C. dubliniensis (1), C.
lusitaniae (3), and C. tropicalis (2). The ePlex BCID-GN Panel generated the expected result
for each of these specimens.
Pan Gram-Positive performance: For the intended use population (specimens with gram-
negative bacteria observed by Gram stain), there were a total of 17 false negative specimens
for the Pan Gram-positive assay target (i.e., PPA for prospective specimens was 73.9%
(17/23); PPA for retrospective specimens was 80% (44/55)). For the six false negative
prospective specimens, two specimens were determined to have Paenibacillus species based
on additional testing of discrepant specimens. Three of the other four false negative
prospective specimens and all 11 of the false negative retrospective specimens were mixed
cultures containing gram-negative organisms that were correctly detected by the ePlex
BCID-GN Panel.
The assay labeling includes the following two limitations regarding mixed cultures, with the
second limitation specifying the lower sensitivity of the ePlex BCID Panel for the Pan
Candida and Pan Gram-Positive assay targets.
• In mixed cultures, the ePlex BCID-GN Panel may not identify all organisms in the
specimen, depending upon the concentration of each target present.
• The BCID-GN Pan Candida and Pan Gram-Positive assays are designed to detect
Candida and gram-positive microorganisms in mixed blood cultures where these
microorganisms might be missed by Gram stain. Lower than expected clinical
sensitivity was observed for these analytes, which was likely due to the presence of
Candida spp. or gram-positive microorganisms in mixed cultures at concentrations
below the respective limits of detection for the Pan Candida and Pan GP targets.

A. Candida glabrata was detected in the 1/1 false positive specimen using PCR/sequencing.
B. 3 of 3 (100%) false negative results occurred in specimens in mixed infections with bacterial organisms where the BCID-GN
Panel results were correct for the other infections in these specimens.
C. Candida albicans was detected in the 1/1 false positive specimen using PCR/sequencing.
D. 2 of 3 (67%) false negative results occurred in specimens in mixed infections with bacterial organisms where the BCID-GN
Panel results were correct for the other infections in these specimens.
E. Candida glabrata was detected in the 1/1 false positive specimen using PCR/sequencing.
F. Bacillus (the gram-positive organism identified by standard laboratory procedures) was not detected in 2 false negative
specimens using PCR/sequencing, but 16S sequencing instead detected Paenibacillus lautus and Paenibacillus urinalis, which
were not identified by standard laboratory procedures. 3 of the remaining 4 (75%) false negative results occurred in specimens in
mixed infections with bacterial organisms where the BCID-GN Panel correctly detected the gram-negative organisms present.
G. Enterococcus (1), Staphylococcus (3), or Streptococcus (2) were detected in 6/7 false positive specimens using PCR/sequencing
(testing was not performed for the remaining 1/7 false positive specimens).
H. 11 of 11 (100%) false negative results occurred in specimens in mixed infections with bacterial organisms where the BCID-GN
Panel correctly detected the gram-negative organisms present.
I. Enterococcus (2), Staphylococcus (1), or Streptococcus (5) were detected in 8/10 false positive specimens using PCR/sequencing
(testing was not performed for the remaining 2/10 false positive specimens).
J. Bacillus (1) or Streptococcus (1) were detected in 2/5 false positive specimens using PCR/sequencing (testing was not performed
for the remaining 3/5 false positive specimens).
Performance for ePlex BCID-GN Panel for genus and group assays, stratification by species
The ePlex BCID-GN Panel reports genus or group level results for Citrobacter, Enterobacter
cloacae complex, Enterobacter non-cloacae complex, Proteus, Salmonella, Serratia, Pan
Candida, and Pan Gram-Positive assay targets. Clinical performance is described in Table
80 for intended use specimens (i.e., bottles containing gram-negative organisms by Gram
stain). Performance is stratified by species identified by comparator methods.
Table 81 includes performance for the Pan-Candida and Pan-Gram Positive assays for non-
intended use specimens (i.e., bottles with gram-positive or fungal organisms by Gram stain).
This data was used to supplement the intended use specimens due to the lower prevalence of
Candida spp. and gram-positive organisms observed in intended use specimens.

Clinical performance, resistance marker targets:
Results for ePlex BCID Panel resistance marker targets are only reported when an associated
organism is detected in the same specimen. The assay report will report ‘N/A’ for a
resistance marker if an applicable organism is not detected in the specimen (See Table 5
above for associated organisms specifically reported with the six targeted resistance markers
on the ePlex BCID-GN Panel).
Clinical performance for the ePlex BCID-GN Panel assays for CTX-M, KPC, IMP, NDM,
OXA and VIM targets are described in Tables 82-99 below. Note that there were no
prospective or retrospective specimens that harbored IMP, NDM, or VIM beta-lactamase
genes; therefore, performance was established for these analytes using contrived specimens.
Clinical Performance, CTX-M:
Table 82 includes the clinical performance for detection of CTX-M for prospective,
retrospective and contrived specimens that contain an applicable gram-negative organism
based on the comparator method (for clinical specimens) or the inoculated organism (for
contrived specimens).
Table 83 includes the clinical performance summary for detection of CTX-M and any
applicable organism by the BCID-GN Panel in comparison to detection/identification by
comparator methods. Results include all prospective and retrospective specimens combined.

A. In 3/11 false negative specimens, CTX-M signal was above the threshold for detection; however, an associated organism was not
detected by the BCID-GN Panel and the CTX-M target was reported as ‘N/A’. Further testing of the 8/11 remaining false negative
specimens indicated that 7 of the 8 specimens may have been contaminated during the original comparator extraction process and
misidentified as having CTX-M present. Specifically, results for 7 of the 8 specimens were negative for CTX-M from the following
additional testing: 1) qPCR testing of 2 repeat extractions from the original specimen, 2) qPCR testing of an extraction from the
isolate, and 3) testing of the original specimen with an FDA-cleared multiplex assay. For these 7 specimens, the originally extracted
specimen was re-tested with qPCR and CTX-M was again detected, suggesting contamination during the original extraction process.
The remaining 8th specimen was positive for CTX-M from the repeat extractions, negative for CTX-M from the isolate, and negative
for CTX-M when tested with an FDA-cleared multiplex assay. These inconsistent detection results suggest the 8th specimen may be
a true low-copy CTX-M positive specimen.

Resistance markers, comparison to antimicrobial susceptibility testing
A supplemental comparison of the CTX-M BCID-GN Panel target versus phenotypic
antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) results for extended spectrum beta-lactamase
(ESBL) activity, Ceftazidime, Ceftriaxone, and Aztreonam, and a combination of the four
results (ESBL/Combo) is provided in Table 100 for clinical isolates with available AST
results. In total, 162 isolates had ESBL confirmatory testing and 770 isolates had ESBL
confirmatory testing and/or AST results for one or more of Ceftazidime, Ceftriaxone, or

Aztreonam. A true positive (TP) result was defined where CTX-M was detected by the
BCID-GN Panel and the isolate was positive for the ESBL confirmatory test or resistant (R)
or intermediate (I) to the specific antimicrobial. A false negative (FN) result was defined
similarly when CTX-M was not detected by the BCID-GN Panel. PPA was calculated as 100
x (TP/(TP+FN)). A true negative (TN) result was defined where CTX-M was not detected by
the BCID-GN Panel and the isolate was negative for the ESBL confirmatory test or
susceptible (S) to the specific antimicrobial. A false positive (FP) result was defined similarly
when CTX-M was detected by the BCID-GN Panel and the isolate was susceptible to the
specific antimicrobial. NPA was calculated as 100 x (TN/(TN+FP)).
For the ESBL/Combo analysis, the phenotypic AST result was positive or negative based on
the ESBL confirmatory test, if available. If the ESBL confirmatory test was not available,
then the phenotypic AST result was considered positive if any of the three antimicrobials
were resistant or intermediate, otherwise, if AST results were susceptible, the result was
considered negative. Note: ESBL resistance can be due to mechanisms other than acquisition
of the CTX-M resistance gene.

A supplemental comparison of the five BCID-GN Panel carbapenemase resistance gene
targets (OXA, KPC, IMP, NDM, VIM) versus phenotypic AST testing for Ertapenem,
Imipenem, and Meropenem is provided in Table 101 for clinical isolates with available AST
results. In total, 731 isolates had AST results for 1 or more of Ertapenem, Imipenem, or
Meropenem. A true positive (TP) result was defined where OXA, KPC, IMP, NDM and/or
VIM was detected by the BCID-GN Panel and the isolate was resistant (R) or intermediate
(I) to Ertapenem, Imipenem, or Meropenem. A false negative (FN) result was defined
similarly when OXA, KPC, IMP, NDM and/or VIM was not detected by the BCID-GN Panel
and the isolate was resistant or intermediate to any of the three antimicrobials. PPA was
calculated as 100 x (TP/(TP+FN)). A true negative (TN) result was defined where OXA,
KPC, IMP, NDM and/or VIM were not detected by the BCID-GN Panel and the isolate was
susceptible for all carbapenems evaluated with AST. A false positive (FP) result was defined
similarly when OXA, KPC, IMP, NDM and/or VIM was detected by the BCID-GN Panel
and the isolate was susceptible for all carbapenems evaluated by AST. NPA was calculated
as 100 x (TN/(TN+FP)). Note: Resistance to carbapenems can be due to mechanisms other
than acquisition of the OXA, KPC, IMP, NDM and/or VIM resistance genes.

Clinical Study, performance of BCID-GN Panel for Specimens with multiple analytes
The ePlex BCID-GN Panel identified multiple bacterial analytes in 103 prospective and
retrospective specimens. Of the 349 prospective specimens tested in the clinical study,
320 (91.7%) had single detections by the ePlex BCID-GN Panel. A total of 29 (8.2%)
specimens had multiple organisms detected; 22 (6.2%) specimens had double detections,
and seven specimens (2.0%) had triple detections.
Of the 29 specimens with multi-detections by the BCID-GN Panel, 13 (44.8%) had one
or more organism targets detected by BCID-GN that were not identified by the
comparator method (i.e., false positive ePlex BCID-GN Panel result).
All multi-detection combinations as detected by the ePlex BCID-GN Panel during the
prospective clinical evaluation are presented in Table 102. False positive BCID-GN Panel
results are described as discrepant organisms in the far right column of the table.

Of the 349 prospective specimens evaluated in the clinical study, 34 specimens (9.7%)
had multiple organisms identified by culture. Of these 34 specimens, 10 specimens
(29.4%) had one or more organisms that were not identified by the ePlex BCID-GN
Panel (i.e., false negative ePlex BCID-GN Panel result).
Due to the significant percentage of false negative results for the ePlex BCID-GN Panel
for blood culture specimens with multiple organisms, a limitation is included in the
package insert stating the following:
• In mixed cultures, the ePlex BCID-GN Panel may not identify all organisms in
the specimen, depending upon the concentration of each target present.
Table 103 includes results from the prospective clinical study for specimens with
multiple organisms identified by comparator methods. False negative BCID-GN Panel
results are described as discrepant organisms in the far right column of the table.

* Indicates an off-panel organism not detected by the BCID-GN Panel.
A. A discrepant organism or resistance marker is defined as one that was detected by the comparator method(s) but not by the BCID-
GN Panel. Excludes organisms not targeted by the BCID-GN Panel.
Instrument Errors/Invalid Rates:
A total of 2460 prospective, retrospective, and contrived specimens were initially tested
in the clinical study. Of these, 23/2460 (0.9%) did not complete the run and the specimen
was retested according to assay instructions.

A total of 2334/2460 (94.9%, 95% CI: 93.9%-95.7%) specimens generated valid results
for an initial invalid rate of 5.1% (95% CI: 4.3%-6.1%)
Upon repeat testing of the 126 specimens with initially invalid results, 1/126 (0.8%) did
not complete the run and the specimen was retested. After repeat testing, all 126
specimens completed testing with 114/126 (90.5%) specimens generating valid results for
a repeat invalid rate of 9.5% (95% CI: 5.5%-15.9%)
Overall, after final testing, 12/2460 (0.5%, 95% CI: 0.3%-0.9%) specimens had final,
invalid results, resulting in a final validity rate of 2448/2460 (99.5%, 95% CI: 99.1%-
99.7%).
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A prospective, multicenter clinical study was conducted to evaluate the clinical
performance of the ePlex BCID-GN Panel in positive blood culture specimens. A total of
349 specimens were prospectively collected at seven clinical sites in two phases from
patients of all ages and genders. In the first phase from June 2014 through July 2016,
182 specimens were prospectively collected and frozen; from June through July 2018,
167 specimens were prospectively collected and tested fresh (never frozen). The expected
values of individual analytes based on the ePlex BCID-GN Panel results in prospective
specimens are summarized by age group and by site in Tables 106 and 107.
