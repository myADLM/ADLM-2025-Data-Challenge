2. Indication(s) for use:
The HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c) Advanced assay on the Beckman Coulter DxC 700 AU
Clinical Chemistry Analyzer, is intended for the quantitative determination of mmol/mol
HbA1c (IFCC) and % HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP) concentration in human venous whole
blood. The determination of HbA1c is used as an aid in diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, for
the monitoring of long-term blood glucose control in individuals with diabetes mellitus
and identifying patients who may be at risk for developing diabetes mellitus. For In vitro
diagnostic use only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
For in vitro diagnostic use.
This assay is designed only for the measurement of mmol/mol HbA1c (IFCC) and
%HbA1c (NGSP). Individual results for T-Hb and A1c concentration should not be
reported.
This test should not replace glucose testing for patients with Type 1 diabetes, pediatric
patients or pregnant women.
In cases of rapidly evolving Type 1 diabetes, the increase of HbA1c values might be
delayed compared to the acute increase in glucose concentrations. In these conditions,
diabetes mellitus must be diagnosed based on plasma glucose concentration and/or the
typical clinical symptoms.
HbA1c should not be used to diagnose diabetes during pregnancy or to diagnose
gestational diabetes. HbA1c reflects the average blood glucose levels over the preceding
3 months (the average life of a red blood cell), and therefore may be falsely low during
pregnancy or any other condition associated with recent onset of hyperglycemia.
The HbA1c Advanced assay allows its use in patients with hemoglobin variants S, C, D
and E traits. However, hemoglobinopathies might affect the red blood cell turnover or the
in vivo glycation rates, and these patients may suffer from anemia and undergo
transfusion. Therefore, results reported correctly by the assay may not reflect the same
level of glycemic control as would be expected in patients with normal hemoglobin. In
these cases, even analytically correct results do not reflect the same level of glycemic
control that would be expected in patients with normal hemoglobin. Whenever, it is
suspected that the presence of a Hb variant (e.g. HbSS, HbCC or HbSC) affects the
correlation between the HbA1c value and glycemic control, HbA1c must not be used for
the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.
This test is not intended for analysis of samples collected from newborns.
Glycated HbF is not detected by the assay as it does not contain the β-chain that
f
2

--- Page 3 ---
characterizes HbA1c. However, HbF is measured in the T-Hb assay and as a
consequence, specimens containing high amounts of HbF may result in lower than
expected mmol/mol HbA1c values (IFCC) and% HbA1c values (DCCT/NGSP). HbA1c
results are invalid for patients with abnormal amounts of HbF including those with
known Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin. The following warning is included in
the labeling;
“WARNING: The Hemoglobin A1c assay has significant negative
interference from Hemoglobin F (HbF). HbA1c results are invalid for
patients with abnormal amounts of HbF, including those with known
Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin. Refer to Limitations
section.”
HbA1c should not be used to diagnose or monitor diabetes in patients with any conditions
resulting in decreased erythrocyte survival, decrease in mean erythrocyte age or abnormal
red blood cell turnover (e.g., hemolytic anemia, including hereditary spherocytosis, iron
deficiency, thalassemias, malignancies, recovery from acute blood loss and severe
chronic hepatic and renal disease). Shortened red cell survival time will reduce the
exposure of red cells to glucose, with a resultant decrease in HbA1c values. The altered
red blood cell turnover interferes with the relationship between mean blood glucose and
HbA1c values.

L. Test Principle:
The HbA1c Advanced assay is a turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay. The DxC 700 AU
Clinical Chemistry analyzer automatically performs the whole blood hemolysis.
Tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB) in the hemolyzing reagent eliminates
interference from leukocytes. The hemolyzed venous whole blood is then added to both the
Total Hemoglobin and HbA1c assay cuvettes according to their defined assay parameters.
Total Hemoglobin reagent (R1) is used to measure Total Hemoglobin (T-Hb) concentration
by a colorimetric method. Change in absorbance is measured at 570/660 nm.
HbA1c reagent (R1 and R2) is used to measure hemoglobin A1c (A1c) concentration by a
turbidimetric immunoinhibition method. In the reaction, hemoglobin A1c antibodies in the
reagent combine with HbA1c from the sample to form soluble antigen-antibody complexes.
Polyhaptens from the reagent then bind with the excess antibodies and the resulting

The concentrations of both T-Hb and A1c are determined, and are used in the calculation of
the reported HbA1c (A1c/T-Hb ratio), which is expressed either as mmol/mol (IFCC) or
% (DCCT/NGSP).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the HbA1c Advanced reagent on the DxC 700 AU Clinical Chemistry
Analyzer was evaluated based on CLSI guideline EP05-A3, Evaluation of Precision
Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline - Third
Edition. Studies were carried out at a single site by three operators over 20 days on
three DxC 700 AU systems using three lots of HbA1c Advanced reagent, four levels
of HbA1c K2 EDTA human venous whole blood patient samples at HbA1c
concentrations of approximately 5.0%, 6.5%, 8.0% and 12%, one level of K2 EDTA
human venous whole blood spiked with human based high HbA1c material at a
HbA1c concentration of approximately 14% and two levels of control materials (QC)
resulting in 720 measurements for each sample. The summary of precision
performance results are shown in the tables below.

the DxC 700 AU Clinical Chemistry Analyzer. The measured values were compared
to the expected values. The regression parameters (slope, intercept, and r) are shown
below for one representative lot:
NGSP:
Slope Intercept R Concentration Range Tested
1.030 -0.14 1.000 3.94 to 15.37 % HbA1c
IFCC:
Slope Intercept R Concentration Range Tested
1.020 -0.64 1.000 19.51 to 144.49 mmol/mol HbA1c
The results of the linearity study support the claimed assay measuring range of 4-15%
HbA1c (20 – 140 mmol/mol HbA1c (IFCC)).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The HbA1c Advanced assay standardization is traceable to the International
Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) reference material. The HbA1c Advanced
assay is certified through the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program
(NGSP). The NGSP certification expires in one year. See NGSP website for current
certification at http://www.ngsp.org. The International Federation of Clinical
Chemistry (IFCC) units of mmol/mol are calculated using the Master Equation:
NGSP (%) = 0.09145 x IFCC (mmol/mol) + 2.152
IFCC Formula= (A1c / T-Hb) * 1000 = HbA1c (mmol/mol)
Results for calculated HbA1c may be reported from the DxC 700 AU analyzer in
either NGSP (%) units or IFCC (mmol/mol).
d. Detection limit:
The claimed measuring range of 4-15% HbA1c (NGSP) and 20 – 140 mmol/mol
HbA1c (IFCC) for HbA1c Advanced reagent is based on the linearity studies above
in M.1.b.
e. Analytical specificity:
Testing to determine the interference bias of various endogenous and exogenous
interferents on the HbA1c Advanced Assay was performed according to CLSI EP07-
A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline - Second
Edition; CLSI EP37 Supplement Tables for Interference Testing in Clinical
Chemistry, 1st Edition was used in conjunction with EP07-A2.
The interfering substances analyzed were tested at two % HbA1c concentrations;
approximately 6.5% HbA1c (low level human venous whole blood K2 EDTA

EDTA sample) using one lot of reagent on one DxC 700 AU Clinical Chemistry
Analyzer.
The whole blood samples were tested at a minimum of five concentration levels for
each interferent with 10 replicates tested per level on the DxC 700 AU Clinical
Chemistry Analyzer to determine the magnitude of the interference. The difference in
mean recovery of the samples with and without the potential interfering substances
was determined.
The sponsor defines significant interference as ≥ ±7% change in the HbA1c

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison testing was performed using 138 frozen human venous whole
blood samples in K2EDTA with values spanning the assay range of 4.70 to 14.2%
HbA1c. Samples were evaluated using the HbA1c Advanced assay on the DxC 700
AU Clinical Chemistry Analyzer. The HbA1c Advanced assay first replicate results
were compared to results obtained for the same samples from testing at an NGSP
secondary reference laboratory (SRL) on the Menarini HA8180V, a HPLC method
(cleared in k162822). The distribution of samples spanning the measuring interval
follows:
Distribution of Samples

<5 6 4.35%
5-6 18 13.04%
6-6.5 32 23.19%
6.5-7 35 25.36%
7-8 25 18.12%
8-9 12 8.7%
>9 10 7.25%
Total 138 100%
Deming (weighted) and Passing-Bablok regression analyses were performed for the
HbA1c Advanced assay versus the comparator method. A summary of the results are
provided below:

Total Error calculations and estimation
The bias estimation values determined in the method comparison study and precision
estimates determined in the precision study were used to determine the total error at
each of the levels listed in the tables below. Total error was calculated by the
following equation:
%TE = |%Bias| + (1.96 x %CV) x (1 + %Bias/100)
Total Error Summary:
%HbA1c % Bias %CV %TE
5.00 -0.80 1.78 4.3
6.50 -0.85 1.69 4.2
8.00 -0.88 1.74 4.2
12.00 -0.92 1.22 3.3
b. Matrix comparison:
Testing was performed to validate the use of different anticoagulants in primary
collection tubes for the HbA1c Advanced reagent on the DxC 700 AU Clinical
Chemistry Analyzer. The study was carried out using one lot of HbA1c Advanced
and K2 EDTA, K3 EDTA, Lithium Heparin and Sodium Heparin anticoagulant tube
types. K2 EDTA values were used as the reference method for K3 EDTA, Lithium
Heparin and Sodium Heparin.
Fifty native venous human whole blood specimens were drawn from each donor into
each of the intended anticoagulant tube types. Values of K2-EDTA whole blood,
ranging from 4.86% HbA1c to 9.83% HbA1c, were compared with values for K3-
EDTA whole blood, lithium heparin whole blood and sodium heparin whole blood,
yielding the following regression results:
Anticoagulant Deming Regression Analysis
K3-EDTA y = 1.000x + 0.043 ; r = 0.997
Lithium Heparin y = 1.004x + 0.013; r = 0. 994
Sodium Heparin y = 1.002x - 0.009; r = 0.997
These results support the use of the HbA1c Advanced assay with samples collected in
