Configuration of SAFECARE Multi-Drug Urine Test Dip Card can consist of any
combination of the above listed drug analytes. The test may yield positive results for the
prescription drugs Buprenorphine, Nortriptyline, Oxazepam, Secobarbital,
Propoxyphene and Oxycodone when taken at or above prescribed doses. It is not intended
to distinguish between prescription use or abuse of these drugs. Clinical consideration
and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result,
particularly when the preliminary result is positive. The test provides only preliminary
test results. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain
a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS or LC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method.
The tests are intended for over-the-counter use.

For over the counter use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable. The devices are visually read and single-use.
I. Device Description:
The SAFECARE Multi-Drug Urine Test Dip Card and SAFECARE Multi-Drug Urine Test
Cup are immunochromatographic assays that use a lateral flow system for the qualitative
detection of Amphetamine, Oxazepam, Cocaine, Marijuana, Methamphetamine, Morphine,
Secobarbital, Methadone, Methylenedioxy-methamphetamine, Oxycodone, Buprenorphine,
Phencyclidine, Nortriptyline and Propoxyphene (target analytes) in human urine. The devices
are single-use in vitro diagnostic devices. SAFECARE Multi-Drug Urine Test Dip Card
comes in the dip card format, and SAFECARE Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup comes in the cup
format. Each test kit contains a device, a package insert and a urine cup for sample
collection. Each test device is sealed with a desiccant in an aluminum pouch.

in the urine specimen are below the cut-off concentration, it will not saturate the binding sites
of its specific monoclonal mouse antibody coated on the particles. The antibody-coated
particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible colored line will
show up in the test line region. The colored line will not form in the test line region if the
target drug level exceeds its cutoff-concentration because it will saturate all the binding sites
of the antibody coated on the particles. A band should form in the control region of the
devices regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the sample to indicate that the
tests have been performed properly.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of -100% cut off, -
75% cut off, -50% cut off, -25% cut off, cut off, +25% cut off, +50% cut off, +75%
cut off and +100% cut off. These samples were prepared by spiking drug in negative
samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by LC/MS. All sample aliquots
were blindly labeled by the person who prepared the samples and didn’t take part in
the sample testing. For each concentration, tests were performed two runs per day for
25 days per device in a randomized order. The results obtained are summarized in the
following tables for Methylenedioxy-methamphetamine, Oxycodone, Buprenorphine,
Phencyclidine, Nortriptyline and Propoxyphene. Please refer to k181968 for precision
data for Amphetamine, Oxazepam, Cocaine, Marijuana, Methamphetamine,
Morphine, Secobarbital and Methadone.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable; these devices are intended for qualitative use only.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Real-time and accelerated stability studies were conducted on three lots of each
device. The protocols for the stability studies were reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interferences
Potential interfering substances found in human urine of physiological or pathological
conditions were added to drug-free urine and urine with concentrations at 25% below
and 25% above the cutoff levels for each analyte. These urine samples were tested
using three lots of each device. Compounds that showed no interference at a
concentration of 100 μg/mL, for either the SAFECARE Multi-Drug Urine Test Dip
Card or the SAFECARE Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup, are listed in the following

Cross-reactivity
To evaluate cross-reactivity, drug metabolites and other structurally related
compounds that are likely to cross-react in urine samples were tested using three lots
of each device. The lowest concentrations of tested compounds that caused a positive
result for each compound are listed below for Methylenedioxy-methamphetamine,
Oxycodone, Buprenorphine, Phencyclidine, Nortriptyline and Propoxyphene. Cross-
reactivity data was reported in k181968 for Amphetamine, Oxazepam, Cocaine,
Marijuana, Methamphetamine, Morphine, Secobarbital and Methadone. There were
no differences in cross-reactivity observed between the SAFECARE Multi-Drug
Urine Test Dip Card or the SAFECARE Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup.

To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine pH, urine samples, with
1.000 to 1.035 specific gravity and urine samples with pH 4 to 9 were spiked with the
target analytes at 25% below and 25% above Cut-Off levels. These samples were
tested using three lots of each device. Results for the pH and specific gravity samples
were all positive for samples at and above +25% Cut-Off and all negative for samples
at and below -25% Cut-Off. There were no differences observed between the
SAFECARE Multi-Drug Urine Test Dip Card or the SAFECARE Multi-Drug Urine
Test Cup.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration is described in the precision section, M.1.a. above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies for the SAFECARE Multi-Drug Urine Test Dip Card and
SAFECARE Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup were performed with three laboratory
assistants performing the tests for each device format. The operators analyzed 80 (40
negative and 40 positive) unaltered clinical samples for each drug. The samples were
blind labeled and compared to LC/MS results. The results are presented in the tables
below for Methylenedioxy-methamphetamine, Oxycodone, Buprenorphine,
Phencyclidine, Nortriptyline and Propoxyphene. Method comparison results were
reported in k181968 for Amphetamine, Oxazepam, Cocaine, Marijuana,

Lay User Study
A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 300 lay persons for
each device format. The lay users had diverse educational and professional
backgrounds and ranged in age from 18 to >50 years. Urine samples were prepared at
the following concentrations; negative, +/-75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of the cutoff by
spiking drugs into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the
samples were confirmed by LC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual
containers and blind-labeled. Each participant was provided with the package insert,
one blind labeled sample and a device. Each device was tested. Results are shown
below.
