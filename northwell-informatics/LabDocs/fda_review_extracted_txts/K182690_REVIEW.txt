H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The GenMark ePlex Blood Culture Identification Fungal Pathogen (BCID-FP)
Panel is a qualitative nucleic acid multiplex in vitro diagnostic test intended for
use on GenMark’s ePlex Instrument for simultaneous detection and identification
of multiple potentially pathogenic fungal organisms in positive blood culture. The
ePlex BCID-FP Panel is performed directly on blood culture samples identified as
positive by a continuous monitoring blood culture system and which contain
fungal organism.
The following fungal organisms are identified using the ePlex BCID-FP Panel:
Candida albicans, Candida auris, Candida dubliniensis, Candida famata,
Candida glabrata, Candida guilliermondii, Candida kefyr, Candida krusei,
Candida lusitaniae, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus
gattii, Cryptococcus neoformans, Fusarium and Rhodotorula.
The detection and identification of specific fungal nucleic acids from individuals
exhibiting signs and/or symptoms of bloodstream infection aids in the diagnosis
of bloodstream infection when used in conjunction with other clinical
information. The results from the ePlex BCID-FP Panel are intended to be
interpreted in conjunction with Gram stain results and should not be used as the
sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions.
Negative results in the setting of a suspected bloodstream infection may be due to
infection with pathogens that are not detected by this test. Positive results do not
rule out co-infection with other organisms; the organism(s) detected by the ePlex
BCID-FP Panel may not be the definite cause of disease. Additional laboratory
testing (e.g. sub-culturing of positive blood cultures for identification of
organisms not detected by ePlex BCID-FP Panel, susceptibility testing and
differentiation of mixed growth) and clinical presentation must be taken into
consideration in the final diagnosis of bloodstream infection.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
Limitations:
• For prescription use only.
• This test is a qualitative test and does not provide a quantitative value.
• This product should not be used with blood culture media that contains
charcoal.
• False results were observed for some targets in a single lot of BACT/Alert
PF Plus and BACT/Alert FA Plus bottle types (see the Sample Matrix
Equivalency (Bottle Evaluation) section of the package insert for additional
details).
• There is a risk of false negative values due to the presence of sequence
variants in the fungal targets of the test.
• In mixed cultures, the ePlex BCID-FP Panel may not identify all organisms
in the specimen, depending upon the concentration of each target present.
• The results of the ePlex BCID-FP Panel should not be used as the sole basis
for diagnosis, treatment or other patient management decisions.
• The genus level assays included as a part of the BCID-FP Panel (Fusarium,
Rhodotorula) are designed to detect a broad range of species but will not
necessarily detect all species within a genus or group.
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use with the GenMark ePlex instrument
I. Device Description:
The ePlex Blood Culture Identification Fungal Pathogen (BCID-FP) Panel is based
on the principles of competitive nucleic acid hybridization using a sandwich assay
format, wherein a single-stranded target binds concurrently to a sequence-specific
solution-phase signal probe and a solid-phase electrode-bound capture probe. The test
employs nucleic acid extraction, target amplification via polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) or reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and hybridization of target DNA. In
the process, the double-stranded PCR amplicons are digested with exonuclease to
generate single-stranded DNA suitable for hybridization.
Nucleic acid extraction from biological samples occurs within the cartridge via cell
lysis, nucleic acid capture onto magnetic beads, and release for amplification. The
nucleic acid extraction is processed through microfluidic liquid handling. Once the
nucleic acid targets are captured and inhibitors are washed away, the magnetic
particles are delivered to the electrowetting environment on the printed circuit board
(PCB) and the targets are eluted from the particles and amplified.
3

--- Page 4 ---
During hybridization, the single-stranded target DNA binds to a complementary,
single-stranded capture probe immobilized on the working gold electrode surface.
Single-stranded signal probes (labeled with electrochemically active ferrocenes) bind
to specific target sequence / region adjacent to the capture probe. Simultaneous
hybridization of target to signal probes and capture probe is detected by alternating
current voltammetry (ACV). Each working electrode on the array contains specific
capture probes, and sequential analysis of each electrode allows detection of multiple
analyte targets.

employs nucleic acid extraction, target amplification via polymerase chain reaction

nucleic acid targets are captured and inhibitors are washed away, the magnetic
particles are delivered to the electrowetting environment on the printed circuit board
(PCB) and the targets are eluted from the particles and amplified.
During hybridization, the single-stranded target DNA binds to a complementary,
single-stranded capture probe immobilized on the working gold electrode surface.
Single-stranded signal probes (labeled with electrochemically active ferrocenes) bind
to specific target sequence/region adjacent to the capture probe. Simultaneous
hybridization of target to signal probes and capture probe is detected by alternating
current voltammetry (ACV). Each working electrode on the array contains specific
capture probes, and sequential analysis of each electrode allows detection of multiple
analyte targets.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Analytical Sensitivity:
The limit of detection (LoD), or analytical sensitivity, was identified
and verified for each assay on the BCID-FP Panel using quantified
reference strains in simulated blood culture sample matrix, which is
defined as the matrix from a negative blood culture bottle mixed with
whole blood and EDTA in the same ratio as the manufacturer
recommends for blood culture. At least 20 replicates per target were
tested for each condition. The limit of detection was defined as the
lowest concentration of each target that is detected in ≥95% of tested
replicates. The confirmed LoD for each ePlex BCID-FP Panel
organism is shown in Table 3 below.

b. Reproducibility:
A multisite reproducibility study of the ePlex BCID-FP Panel was
conducted at three testing sites (two external sites and one internal
site) across major potential sources of variability, such as site-to-site,
lot-to-lot, day-to-day, and operator-to-operator. One ePlex instrument
per study site with four towers was employed in this reproducibility
study. Two operators performed testing at each site on six days (five
nonconsecutive days) with three unique lots of ePlex BCID-FP Panel
cartridges. A reproducibility study panel consisting of four positive
panel members including 5 on-panel organisms at 2 concentrations
reflecting bottle positivity plus 8 hours and bottle positivity, and 1
negative panel member, was tested in triplicate. Concentrations in the
positive mixes reflected those observed at time of bottle positivity
plus 8 hours (BP+8) and time of bottle positivity (BP) and one mix
containing an off-panel organism grown to bottle positivity, which is
expected to yield a negative result. Bottle concentrations used in this
study are summarized in Table 4.

Internal Controls:
Each ePlex BCID- FP Panel cartridge includes internal controls that
monitor performance of each step of the testing process, including
extraction, amplification and detection of targets.
Each amplification reaction on the cartridge has an internal control
and in each reaction either the internal control or a target must
generate signal above the defined threshold for a valid test result.
Internal control results are interpreted by the ePlex Software and
displayed on the ePlex BCID-FP Panel Reports as Internal Control
with a result of PASS, FAIL, or INVALID. Table 6 includes details
on the interpretation of Internal Control results.

Recommended External Controls: External controls are not provided
with the ePlex Identification Fungal Pathogen (BCID-FP) Panel, but
are recommended in the package insert. Positive and negative
external controls should be tested with each new lot of reagents or
monthly, whichever occurs first. Blood culture medium can be used
as the negative control. Previously characterized positive samples or
blood culture medium spiked with well characterized organisms can
be used as the external positive control. External controls should be
run in accordance with laboratory protocols and accrediting
organizations, as applicable.
Specimen Stability
A specimen stability study was performed to confirm the stability of
specimens stored under four different temperature conditions over
multiple time points which vary based on storage temperature.
Additionally, specimen stability was compared at bottle ring and 12
hours after bottle ring.
Organism mixes whose members were at a concentration
approximating bottle positivity were stored at ≤-70°C, ≤-20°C, 2°-

Twenty replicates were tested at the beginning of the study when
organism mixes were freshly made (time point T0). Ten replicates
were tested for each additional temperature and time point. If any of
the targets were not detected in 1 of 10 replicates, an additional 10
replicates were tested to determine whether 95% detection rate could
be achieved.
Ambient Storage Condition
The positivity rate and mean nA signals for all 5 targets for the
Ambient Storage temperature were calculated (Table 9). All analytes
were ≥95% positive at all time points at ambient temperature
storage, with the exception of Rhodotorula. Detection of
Rhodotorula was 85% at day 7, but passed the criteria of ≥95%
detection at the subsequent two time points (14 and 30 days), which
passes overall acceptance criteria for the ambient storage condition.

The positivity rate and mean nA signals for all 5 targets for the -20 °C
temperature storage condition were calculated (Table 11). All analytes were
100% positive at all time points up to 3 months at -20 °C temperature
storage, with the exception of Rhodotorula. Detection of Rhodotorula was
85% at 30 days, but passed the criteria of ≥95% detection at the subsequent
time point (3 months), which passes overall acceptance criteria for the -20
°C storage condition.

Freeze-Thaw Study
A study was performed to assess the tolerance of the ePlex BCID-FP to
correctly identify specimens containing fungal organisms that have gone
through one or two freeze/thaw cycles prior to testing. One hundred and
twelve positive clinical samples that were tested fresh during the BCID-FP
Panel Clinical Performance Study were selected to best represent a variety
of organisms in clinical samples. The samples were frozen at ≤-70°C and
then thawed once or twice prior to re-testing with the BCID-FP Panel.
The positive agreement with the fresh condition at each freeze-thaw cycle
was calculated and was above 95% for each condition. Table 14 and 15
below summarizes the concordance at each freeze-thaw cycle with a 95%
confidence level and the mean nA signal.

Results demonstrate that the BCID-FP Panel can detect the same organisms
in samples that were tested fresh and in samples that have been frozen and
thawed up to 2 times.
In-Cartridge Sample Stability Study
An analytical study was carried out to demonstrate performance under the
following conditions:
1) Condition 1: The hands-on-time for pipetting the sample into the
sample reservoir and starting the consumable run on the ePlex
instrument is ≤ 2 minutes.
2) Condition 2 (Open Pouch): the cartridge is stable for 2 hours after
the pouch has been opened and the unloaded cartridge is exposed to
the environment.
3) Condition 3 (In-Consumable Sample Stability): the cartridge can be
stored at room temperature for at least 2 hours after the sample has
been loaded prior to running the cartridge in an ePlex bay.
A test mix of four organisms was used in the study. The selected organisms
represent all four of the multiplex primer pools on the BCID-FP Panel. Each
organism was tested at a concentration approximating bottle positivity. A
description of the test mix used for this study is summarized in Table 16
below.

Hands-on time study results demonstrated that each consumable met the ≤ 2
minute hands-on time requirement, with an overall average time of 27
seconds. Sample loading time averaged 9 seconds, and consumable loading
time on the ePlex Instrument averaged 18 seconds.
Cartridge Shelf-Life Stability Study
An analytical study was carried out to generate supporting stability data to
establish the shelf-life of the ePlex BCID-FP Panel cartridge when stored
under refrigerated conditions (2ºC - 8ºC). The study design uses an approach
consistent with CLSI guideline EP25-A.
A minimum of three lots of ePlex BCID-FP Panel cartridges were stored
under refrigerated conditions and were tested throughout the duration of the
real-time stability study. A positive test sample was comprised of a mix
containing qualified organisms, each at concentrations approximating bottle
positivity (Table 18). This sample mix represents all four multiplex primer
pools on the BCID-FP Panel.

On each day of time point testing, positive test samples were made to a final
concentration. Positive test samples were created in negative blood matrix.
A negative control consisting of negative blood matrix was also included
with each time point. The following were tested at each time point; 4
replicates of negative blood matrix as negative control and 50 replicates of
positive test samples.
Real-time study data support that the ePlex BCID-FP Panel cartridges
continue to be stable for up to ten weeks when stored under refrigerated
conditions (2ºC - 8ºC). The stability study is ongoing and the product will be
labeled with an expiration date that is supported by the real-time stability

e. Growth and Detection Study
A study was performed to establish the range of expected organism
concentrations present in incubated blood cultures at bottle positivity
(i.e., bottle “ring”) and eight hours after bottle positivity/bottle
“ring” Several representative fungal organisms were spiked into
blood culture bottles along with the manufacturer’s recommended
volume of human whole blood and grown to positivity in a
commercially-available continuously monitoring blood culture
system. Bottles were removed from the incubator within two hours
of being identified as positive as well as eight hours after bottle
positivity. At least two independent positive blood culture replicates
were quantified for each organism on culture plates. Organisms
tested and approximate bottle positivity concentrations are
summarized in Table 19. Concentrations shown below represent
approximate levels that may be observed in a clinical setting. All
estimated bottle positivity concentrations are equivalent or greater
than the established Limit of Detection (LOD) for each of the assays
of the ePlex BCID-FP Panel.

collection of 51 fungal organisms that represent the diversity of the ePlex
BCID-FP Panel analytes. Isolates were selected to represent relevant species
or serotypes and selection with specific inclusion of more commonly
encountered species and known human pathogens.
Each isolate was initially tested in blood culture matrix at a concentration

No cross-reactivity was observed between any of the off-panel bacteria and fungi
with the ePlex BCID-FP Panel targets.
h. Assay cut-off:
Analytical studies were conducted to establish the signal boundaries for all targets
and controls of the ePlex BCID-FP Panel.
A mixture of clinical samples, contrived bottle positives, and organisms spiked at or
above the analytically determined limit of detection were used as samples for the
study. Positive data points from samples at or greater than the determined LoD test

concentration in the Limit of Detection study were used to supplement the Cutoff
study data. Negative data points for all targets were obtained from the Limit of Blank
study. Expected negative data points from replicates that were positive for other
targets in the LoD and Cutoff studies were also combined to increase statistical power
of the ROC analysis.
For each target, the signals for positive and negative tests were analyzed. An
appropriate boundary was established wherein specificity and sensitivity were
maximized. The analysis was verified by ROC analysis. The final boundary set points
are listed in Table 25 below.

i. Interference:
A study was performed to investigate the effect of 18 potentially interfering
substances on the BCID-FP Panel. Two organism mixes consisting of 5 on-
panel organisms and negative blood matrix were used to assess potentially
interfering substances for interference. Potentially interfering test substances
were spiked at levels predicted to be above the concentration of the substance
likely to be found in a blood culture specimen. The positivity of the organisms
for each potentially interfering substance at the initial testing concentration is
summarized in Table 26 and 27.

j. Mixed Culture Study (Microbial interference):
Competitive inhibition was evaluated for the ePlex BCID-FP Panel by
pairing twelve clinically relevant organisms (including 9 off-panel
organisms) in thirteen simulated dual infection sample mixes. Candida
albicans was tested at low titer (concentration expected at bottle positivity)
while in the presence of other organisms at higher titer (concentrations
expected at 8 hours beyond bottle positivity, or one log higher than that
expected at bottle positivity). Candida glabrata and Candida parapsilosis
were also tested at the concentration expected at bottle positivity in the
presence of Candida albicans at a higher titer concentration. No competitive
inhibition was observed in any of the sample mixes evaluated at the
concentrations listed in Table 28.

Study results demonstrated that high concentrations of the on-panel BCID-FP
microorganisms spiked into blood culture samples produced positive results for the
relevant assays on the BCID-FP Panel but did interfere with any expected results for
other analytes. High concentrations of off-panel BCID-FP microorganisms also
showed no interference with the detection of any ePlex BCID-FP organism with no
unexpected false negative or false positive results observed.
k. Testing of Additional Blood Culture Bottle Types
Fifteen different blood culture bottle types from three different blood culture systems
(BacT/Alert, BACTEC and VersaTREK) were evaluated analytically with the BCID-
FP Panel. Blood culture bottles/media were tested with the recommended ratio of
blood to media. Testing was performed using two organism mixes whose members
were present at a concentration approximating blood culture bottle positivity in a
clinical sample. The mixes contain representative organisms from four genera,
including the most prevalent Candida organism. Each organism was present at a
testing concentration approximating bottle positivity. The 15 bottle types listed in the
table below were evaluated and study results demonstrated correct positive and
negative BCID-FP Panel results with each bottle type.

Thirteen bottle types tested showed no interference for any of the targets
tested. The BACT/Alert® PF Plus and BACT/Alert® FA Plus bottle types
each showed lower sensitivity for one organism tested in one of the two bottle
lots and may have reduced sensitivity for some targets. The following
discordance was observed in the study:
• BACT/Alert PF Plus
Both lots of BacT/ Alert PF Plus failed to detect Rhodotorula in one of five
initial replicates. Upon retest, one of ten replicates resulted in a Rhodotorula
false negative for lot 3048740. The second lot of the same bottle type (lot
3047800), detected all targets in all 10 repeat test replicates. Given the lower
detection rate of Rhodotorula in one of two bottle lots tested, the sensitivity for
some targets may potentially be reduced in BacT/ Alert PF Plus bottles.
• BacT/ Alert FA Plus
The BacT/ Alert FA Plus lot 3048018 had one run with a Candida parapsilosis
false positive in the initial five test replicates with mix 2. Upon retest, no false
positives were observed but one Candida albicans false negative was observed.
Given the lower detection rate of Candida albicans in one of two bottle lots
tested, the sensitivity for some targets may potentially be reduced in BacT/
Alert FA Plus bottles.

l. Carryover Study:
The carryover/cross-contamination rate of the ePlex BCID-FP Panel and ePlex
instrument was evaluated using a checkerboard approach by running high positive
and negative samples interspersed in all bays of a four-tower ePlex instrument (i.e.,
24 bays total) over five separate runs on five separate days. The positive sample was a
contrived blood culture sample containing Fusarium sacchari. This organism was
contrived and grown to positivity in blood culture, then incubated for an additional 8
hours in a continuously monitoring blood culture instrument. The contrived F.
sacchari sample was then spiked with Candida albicans at 1x107 CFU/mL. The
organism levels were higher than typically found in positive blood cultures in order to
challenge the system for potential cross contamination. No false positives were
detected in the negative runs indicating no carryover or cross-contamination was
observed between bays or within bays with the ePlex BCID-FP Panel when testing
samples consecutively or in adjacent bays with an ePlex instrument. Two false
negatives were detected in positive samples, which were repeated and produced
expected results.

The performance of the ePlex BCID-FP Panel was compared to standard
laboratory procedures, including traditional and automated culture, MALDI-TOF
IVD, and microbiological and biochemical techniques. In addition, all prospective
samples were tested with analytically validated PCR assays followed by bi-
directional sequencing to determine the presence or absence of Candida auris,
Fusarium, and Rhodotorula. Identification for samples with Candida parapsilosis
identified by standard laboratory procedures was confirmed using analytically
validated PCR assays followed by bi-directional sequencing.
The comparator method(s) results were used to determine the Detected / Not
Detected status for each target organism on the ePlex BCID-FP Panel. The
comparator methods for each target are summarized in Table 32.

fungal Gram stain results
Clinical sensitivity or positive percent agreement (PPA) was calculated by
dividing the number of true positive (TP) results by the sum of TP and false
negative (FN) results, while specificity or negative percent agreement (NPA) was
calculated by dividing the number of true negative (TN) results by the sum of TN
and false positive (FP) results. A TP result was defined as a sample where the
detected ePlex BCID-FP Panel result matched the detected comparator method
result, while a TN result was one where a negative ePlex BCID-FP Panel result
matched a negative comparator method result. The two-sided 95% confidence
interval was also calculated.
A total of 866 positive blood culture samples with a Gram stain result indicating
fungal organism consisting of 11 fresh prospective, 10 frozen prospective, 120
retrospective, and 725 contrived samples were evaluated for the ePlex BCID-FP
Panel targets. Contrived samples were prepared by spiking an isolate into a blood
culture bottle and growing until flagged positive by a continuously monitoring
blood culture system. Samples were removed from the system within 8 hours of
positivity and stored frozen until the time of testing. PPA and NPA results are
summarized by target in Tables 33-48 below and the strains used to contrive
samples are summarized in Table 49.

The ePlex BCID-FP Panel did not identify any fungal co-detections in prospective
samples, and 6 fungal co-detections were identified in the retrospective samples.
Of the 120 retrospective samples, 114 (95.0%) had single detections and 6 (5.0%)
had double detections. In the 6 co-detections, 4 included 1 organism that
comparator method(s) did not detect. See Table 50 below for a summary of co-
detections in retrospective samples.

A A discrepant organism is defined as one that was detected by the comparator method(s) but not by the BCID-FP Panel
(excludes organisms not targeted by the BCID-FP Panel).
A total of 867 samples (including prospective, retrospective, and contrived
samples) were initially tested in the clinical evaluations. Of these, 7/867 (0.8%)
did not complete the run and the sample was retested. After repeat testing, all 867
samples completed testing and 839/867 (96.8%, 95% CI: 95.4%-97.8%)
generated valid results and 28/867 (3.2%, 95% CI: 2.2%-4.6%) generated invalid
results on the first completed attempt.
Upon repeat testing of the 28 samples with initially invalid results, all completed
the run and 27/28 (96.4%) generated valid results. Overall, after final testing,
1/867 (0.1%, 95% CI: 0.0%-0.7%) had final, invalid results, resulting in a final
validity rate of 866/867 (99.9%, 95% CI: 99.3%-100%).

External controls used in the clinical study consisted of 2 positive controls and 1
negative control. The positive controls together represent all the targets on the
ePlex BCID-FP Panel. On each day of testing with the ePlex BCID-FP Panel,
each site tested one positive and one negative control. Sites rotated through the 2
positive controls throughout the study.

Over 47 days of investigational testing across 4 sites (median number of days/site
was 12), there were 93 external control samples tested with valid results: 23
Positive Control A, 24 Positive Control B, and 46 Negative Control. Of these,
92/93 had the expected results. The remaining 1 external control sample had the
expected results except as follows: 1 Positive Control B sample had 1 Candida
glabrata false positive result.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
A prospective, multicenter clinical study was conducted to evaluate the clinical
performance of the ePlex BCID-FP Panel in positive blood culture samples. A
total of 447 positive blood culture samples were collected at 6 clinical sites in 2
phases from patients of all ages and genders. Samples were collected and frozen
for future testing from May 2015 through July 2016. Samples were collected from
July through August 2018 and tested fresh (never frozen). Of these 447 samples,
21 had a Gram stain result indicating fungal organism. The expected values of
individual analytes based on the ePlex BCID-FP Panel results in the 21
prospective samples are summarized by age group and by site in Tables 54 and 55
below.
