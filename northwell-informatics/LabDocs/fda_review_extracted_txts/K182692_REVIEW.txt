3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
BD MAX System
I. Device Description:
The BD MAX System and the BD MAX CTGCTV 2 assay are comprised of an instrument
with associated hardware and accessories, and a reagent kit. Each reagent kit contains a PCR
cartridge with the master mix, Unitized Reagent Strips (URS), extraction reagent, and sample
buffer tubes, sufficient for 24 tests.
Urogenital specimens are collected using proprietary collection kits (BD MAX Urine
Transport Kit, the BD MAX LBC Sample Buffer Tubes or the BD MAX 3-in-1 Swab
Collection Kit) and transported to a laboratory. The Unitized Reagent Strips needed for the
run are placed in the sample rack and securely seated. Foil-sealed dried Extraction Tubes
and PCR reagent tubes are snapped into the appropriate positions on each Unitized Reagent
Strip. The PCR cartridge is placed in a designated place on the instrument and the specimens
are loaded onto a sample rack. As the run is initiated, the reagents are rehydrated and the
cells in the sample are lysed releasing DNA which is then bound to magnetic beads. After a
washing step, the PCR master mix is added and the specific targets, if present, are amplified
followed by detection of the generated fluorescent signal.
Specimens collected in PreservCyt solution (Liquid-based Cytology (LBC) specimens)
require a pre-warming step prior to loading on the BD MAX instrument, using the BD Pre-
Warm Heater. Following the pre-heating, a 0.5 mL aliquot of the specimen is transferred to
the BD MAX LBC Sample Buffer Tube and loaded onto the instrument.
The instrument consists of a sample processing sub-system with a fluid handling robot, and
the integrated readers, which perform thermal cycling and optical detection. The instrument
automates sample preparation including target lysis, DNA extraction and concentration,
reagent rehydration, and target nucleic acid amplification and detection using real-time PCR.
A Sample Processing Control is included in every Extraction Tube and serves to detect a
reagent or a procedure failure during the extraction and thermal cycling steps. The probes
used for the amplification are labeled with a fluorophore which generates fluorescence in the
presence of complementary sequences. The BD MAX software interprets the emitted
fluorescence to generate final qualitative results. The following table shows the result
interpretation for the BD MAX CTGCTV2 assay.

L. Test Principle:
The assay utilizes real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for amplification of specific
genetic sequences in the DNA of the target microorganisms. The nucleic acids from the
target organisms are released during cell lysis and are captured on magnetic affinity beads.
The beads are washed using Wash Buffer and the nucleic acids are then eluted by a
combination of heat and pH. Eluted DNA is neutralized using Neutralization Buffer and
transferred to the Master Mix to rehydrate the PCR reagents. After reconstitution, the BD
MAX System dispenses a fixed volume of PCR-ready solution containing extracted nucleic
acids into the BD MAX PCR Cartridge. Microvalves in the BD MAX PCR Cartridge are
sealed by the system prior to initiating PCR in order to contain the amplification mixture,
thus preventing evaporation and contamination.

The amplified DNA targets are detected using hydrolysis (TaqMan) probes, labeled at one
end with a fluorescent reporter dye (fluorophore), and at the other end with a quencher
moiety. Probes labeled with different fluorophores are used to detect amplicons for target
analytes and the Sample Processing Control in five different optical channels of the BD
MAX System. When the probes are in their native state, the fluorescence of the fluorophore
is quenched due to its proximity to the quencher. However, in the presence of target DNA,
the probes hybridize to their complementary sequences and are hydrolyzed by the 5’-3’
exonuclease activity of the DNA polymerase as it synthesizes the nascent strand along the
DNA template. As a result, the fluorophores are separated from the quencher molecules and
fluorescence is emitted. The BD MAX System monitors these signals at the end of each cycle
and interprets the data at the end of the reaction to provide qualitative test results for each
analyte (i.e., positive or negative).
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision
Within-laboratory precision was evaluated for the BD MAX CTGCTV2 assay at one site
with one lot of reagents. Testing was performed over 12 days, by two technologists,
alternating each day to perform two runs (total of 24 runs). The test panel consisted of four
samples prepared in pooled negative vaginal, urine, and PreservCyt specimen matrix. Each of
the three organisms, Chlamydia trachomatis (Serovar D), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and
Trichomonas vaginalis, was spiked into the respective matrices at the following target
concentrations relative to the established limit of detection (LoD):
• True negative (TN): no target (expected negative 100% of the time)
• Low Positive (LP): 1.5x LoD (expected positive 95% to 100% of the time)
• High Negative (HN): below assay LoD (expected negative 5% to 95% of the time)
• Moderate Positive (MP): 3x LoD (expected positive 100% of the time)

b. Reproducibility
Site-to-Site Reproducibility
A site-to-site reproducibility of the BD MAX CTGCTV2 assay was evaluated at three testing
sites (two external and one internal), using one lot of reagents. Testing was performed on
eight distinct days, by two technologists, alternating each day to perform two runs per day
(16 runs per site, a total of 48 runs across the sites). Each site was provided the same panels
as described for the Precision study, above. Each sample was tested in duplicate in each run
and one pair of positive and negative External Controls was included in each test run.
The data was analyzed for percent agreement with the expected qualitative results.
Additionally, quantitative analyses of the PCR parameters were performed for each target
(for positive results only).

Based on the evaluation of reproducibility of the BD MAX CTGCTV2 assay system,
conducted at three sites, with one lot of reagents, the overall variability (for positive
samples), across all matrices and across all analytical targets, expressed as % CV, ranged
from 3.2% to 6.6% for the High Negative samples; from 2.1% to 4.0% for the Low Positive
samples; and from 1.5% to 3.2% for the Moderate Positive samples.
Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility
A lot-to-lot reproducibility was evaluated at one (internal) site using three lots of reagents.
The testing was performed over eight days, by two technologists, alternating each day to
perform two runs per day. Using the same test panels as described for the Precision study,
above, there were 16 runs performed on each lot of reagents, for a total of 48 runs. Each
sample was tested in duplicate in each run and one pair of positive and negative External
Controls was included in each test run.
The data was analyzed for percent agreement with the expected qualitative results.
Additionally, quantitative analyses of the PCR parameters were performed for each target
(for positive results only).

Controls:
The BD MAX CTGCTV2 assay includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC) in each
Extraction Tube which serves to monitor the DNA extraction and thermal cycling steps, as
well as to detect reagent deterioration and the presence of inhibitory substances. If the
Sample Processing Control result fails to meet the specific acceptance criteria written in the
software, the result of the specimen will be reported as Unresolved; however, any positive
(POS) assay result will be reported and no targets will be called NEG. An Unresolved result
is indicative of specimen-associated inhibition or reagent failure. Any specimen reported as
Unresolved must be retested.
External controls are not provided by the manufacturer. Laboratories must establish the
number, type, and frequency of testing of control materials according to guidelines or
requirements of local, provincial, state and federal and/or country regulations, or
accreditation organizations in order to monitor the effectiveness of the entire analytical
process. An External Positive Control is intended to monitor for substantial reagent failure.
An External Negative Control is intended to detect reagent or environmental contamination
(or carry-over) by target nucleic acids.
Commercially available control material or a previously characterized clinical sample known
to be positive may be used as a positive control. The BD MAX CTGCTV2 Swab Buffer
Tube without the addition of organism or a previously characterized sample known to be
negative is recommended for use as an external negative control. External positive and
negative controls were included in all analytical and clinical studies performed in support of
this submission.
Specimen Stability Studies:
Specimen stability (i.e., stability of the amplifiable DNA in the specimen) was evaluated for
urine, vaginal swabs, and endocervical specimens collected in PreservCyt solution (LBC
specimen). Test samples were prepared in pooled negative clinical matrix (i.e., swab, urine
and LBC) by spiking with the target organisms to concentrations targeted at 2x LoD and
processing them according to the directions in the collection kit appropriate for the matrix.
Baseline testing was performed on the same day as the samples were prepared. Specimen
stability was evaluated at 2-8ºC, 30ºC and -20ºC. All positive (spiked) samples were tested in
20 replicates at each time point. All negative samples were tested in four replicates at each
time point. The data generated during the study support specimen stability at the following
storage conditions:
Urine specimens, when transferred immediately to the MAX Urine SBT, are stable up to
21 days at 2-30ºC and then additional 30 days at -20ºC.
Endocervical and vaginal swab specimens, when transferred immediately to the MAX Swab
SBT, are stable up to 21 days at 2-30ºC and then additional 30 days at -20ºC.
Neat PreservCyt specimens must be transferred to the MAX LBC SBT within 14 days of
15

--- Page 16 ---
collection when stored at 2-30°C. PreservCyt in MAX LBC SBT prior or post-prewarm can
be stored for up to 21 days at 2-30°C and then an additional 30 days at -20°C before testing.
e. Detection limit:
Analytical Sensitivity
The Limit of Detection (LoD) for the BD MAX CTGCTV2 assay was determined in urine,
vaginal swab specimen matrix, and in PreservCyt liquid based cytology (LBC) specimen
matrix. The study included two representative strains of each: CT (serovars D and H), GC,
and TV organisms.
The CT, GC, and TV stock cultures were obtained from the ATCC either as lyophilized or
frozen cultures. Each organism was re-grown in the appropriate media designated for that
organism and quantified stocks were prepared for use in the study. CT EBs were enumerated
by direct immunofluorescent staining using a labeled antibody directed toward the Major
Outer Membrane Protein. The EBs were counted using a fluorescent microscope. GC was
enumerated by preparing a suspension of cells and measuring the optical density to calculate
the number of organisms/mL. TV was enumerated using a Neubauer hemocytometer under a
light microscope to obtain the total count of organisms/mL
For each strain to be tested, pooled female urine, pooled vaginal swab matrix, and pooled
PreservCyt samples (pre-screened negative for CT, GC and TV) were individually spiked
with different concentrations of CT, GC or TV organisms. After determining a putative LoD
(serial dilutions tested in 12 replicates, to determine the highest dilution (the lowest target
level) yielding 100% positivity rate), a confirmation of LoD study was conducted in each
matrix. Dilutions prepared at organism concentration levels below and above the putative
LoD were tested with the BD MAX CTGCTV2 assay in 20 replicates. Confirmation of LoD
was achieved when ≥ 95% positivity rate was observed, i.e., at least 19 out of 20 results per
dilution were positive. Additional intermediate dilutions were tested when the observed
results were 100% positive at one level and < 85% at the next lower concentration. The
testing was performed across nine BD MAX instruments using three lots of reagents. The
confirmed Limit of Detection by serovar/strain and specimen type is shown below.

Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)
The reactivity of the BD MAX CTGCTV2 assay was evaluated with additional clinically
relevant and geographically diverse serovars and/or strains of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT),
Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV). The study included 13
serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis (A, B, C, E, vE, F, G, I, J, K, LGV1, LGV2, and LGV3),
30 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and eight strains of Trichomonas vaginalis. Organism
stocks were obtained from ATCC either as lyophilized or frozen cultures. Each organism was grown
on/in the appropriate media designated for that organism and quantified. Each organism was
evaluated in swab, urine, and PreservCyt matrix in 20 replicates at the pre-determined LoD
(1x) concentration, using at least three reagent lots. All organisms, except four of the
Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, were positive in at least 19 out of 20 (≥ 95%) replicates
tested. Three of the remaining four N. gonorrhoeae strains were titered to a 1.5x LoD
concentration in vaginal matrix and retested. One additional strain was re-titered to a 1.5x
LoD concentration in urine and retested. All four organisms were detected in at least 19 out
of 20 replicates when tested at 1.5x LoD concentration. The results of the analytical reactity
testing are shown below.

f. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity with Other Microorganisms
The analytical specificity of the MAX CTGCTV2 assay was evaluated with well-
characterized isolates of microorganisms that are phylogenetically related or likely to be
found in urogenital specimens. The bacterial strains, viruses, parasites, and yeast species
commonly found in urogenital specimens were added to the Sample Buffer Tubes and tested
in three replicates across two lots of assay reagents. Bacteria, parasites, and yeast were grown
and quantified to achieve final test concentrations of ≥ 1x106 organisms/mL. Quantified
viruses were obtained from commercial vendors and diluted to achieve final test
concentration in the Sample Buffer Tube of ≥ 1x105 pfu or genomic equivalents/mL. All
samples were negative for CT, GC, and TV in all three replicates tested, except for
Pentatrichomonas hominis and Trichomonas tenax. Pentatrichomonas hominis (commensal
of the large intestine) produced positive results for TV at a concentration ≥ 1.00 x 105
TV/mL; Trichomonas tenax (commensal of the oral cavity) produced positive results for TV
at a concentration ≥ 1.88 TV/mL. Both organisms produced negative results for CT and GC
(i.e., no cross-reactivity).

Interference from Endogenous and Exogenous Substances
Potential interference/inhibition from endogenous and exogenous substances that may be
present in urogenital specimens was evaluated by testing specimens contrived in negative
matrix at low concentrations of the target analytes (CT, GC and TV), in the presence of each
of the substances listed in the table below. Two serovars of CT, two strains of GC, and one
strain of TV were spiked into urine, swab, and PreservCyt matrices at target concentrations
of 3x LoD. The interferents tested were added to each of the samples containing the target
analytes. Each sample was tested in triplicate, in accordance with the test procedure. Twenty
six of the substances were evaluated in urine, 23 were tested in vaginal swab matrix, and 22
were tested in PreservCyt media. Each of the substances was titrated to determine the
concentration at which no interference was observed. There was no interference observed up
to the concentrations tested, as shown below.

g. Assay cut-off:
For all analytes in the CTGCTV2 assay, the cutoff was determined using a training dataset
and later validated by the clinical study. With the exception of GC2, the chemistry of the
CTGCTV2 assay is identical to the previously cleared CT/GC/TV assay (K151589), and
therefore presented a unique opportunity to use the previous clinical study as a training
dataset for those analytes.
For each analyte, an acceptable threshold range was established for each sample type in the
study, setting a minimum threshold at a point where no false positives were caused by system

noise. System noise was evaluated subjectively, using expert analysis of individual signal
curves to distinguish them from true PCR amplification. A maximum threshold was then set
as the highest value with no new false negatives. Positive results are reported when any Ct
score is calculated and, by definition, there are no Ct values for negative specimens (note:
instrument reports a -1 for negative specimens).
However, since GC2 was not included in the CT/GC/TV study, the cutoff for that analyte
was determined using a separate analytical dataset. Multiple GC LoD titration studies were
performed and the data was evaluated over a range of Ct thresholds. The studies used
contrived samples at varying concentrations including true negatives, high negatives (below
LoD), low positives (at LoD), and moderate positives (2-4x LoD) in both vaginal and urine
matrix. True negatives were 100% negative across the entire Ct threshold. As a result,
thresholds were selected to maximize sensitivity.
The assay cutoff was then verified based on the results of the clinical study, using all samples
with valid reference results (3756 for CT and for GC and 3735 for TV). The infected/non-
infected status was determined by the agreed PIS algorithm for all specimens, except for
urine, which was evaluated by comparison to a Composite Comparator Algorithm (CCA),
consisting of three NAATs (with a 2 out of 3 rule).
h. Competitive Inhibition:
A study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the assay in the presence of mixed
infection, i.e., the potential inhibition of one of the targets by the presence of the second (or
third) analyte. The urine, vaginal, and PreservCyt specimens were spiked with different
combinations of high and low concentrations of the organisms to determine the impact, if
any, of mixed infections on assay results. The Low concentration was prepared at 1.5X LoD
(as shown below) and the high concentration was prepared at ≥106 units/mL.

The observed shift in the signal, expressed in Ct-score values, for all samples tested across
the three matrices, ranged from -0.1 to 4.5 for CT, from -1.8 to 5.8 for GC, and from 1.0 to
4.8 for TV.
i. Carryover/Contamination:
A study was conducted to estimate the rate of carryover/cross-contamination for the MAX
CTGCTV2 assay on the BD MAX System when processing specimens with a high
concentration of an analyte. The study was performed using high positive samples alternated
with negative samples. PreservCyt matrix was used as a representative specimen type in this
study because of its high alcohol content and thus most likely to result in cross-
contamination. The High Positive samples were prepared at a concentration ≥ 106 EB/mL in
the LBC Sample Buffer Tubes. Negative samples consisted of LBC Sample Buffer Tubes
without target added.
Eighteen runs were conducted, each containing 12 replicates of the High Positive sample and
12 replicates of the negative sample (24 samples per run). The samples were loaded in an
alternating fashion (positive, negative, positive, etc.) and were equally distributed across BD
MAX sample racks for a total of 432 measurements. The testing was performed by two
operators over two days, using 3 instruments in total.
Data was analyzed by comparing the proportion of false positive results observed in the
negative samples. Among the 216 negative specimens analyzed there were two positive
results, with the contamination rate estimate of 0.93% (95% CI: 0.25%; 3.31%).

3. Clinical studies:
Twelve geographically diverse clinical collection centers participated in this study. Two
additional sites participated in the study and performed reference testing only. Clinical
centers represented high and low prevalence settings and included sexually transmitted
disease (STD) clinics, family planning clinics, research facilities and obstetrics and
gynecology clinics (OB/GYN). Of the 12 collection sites, five sites enrolled both female and
male subjects, six sites enrolled females only, and one site enrolled males only. Enrollment
occurred between July 6, 2016 and June 2, 2017, during which a total of 2,547 female
subjects and 1,159 male subjects were enrolled. Specimens were collected from
asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects. The collected specimens were distributed and
tested with the BD MAX CTGCTV2 assay across five clinical testing sites.
Male subjects provided a urine specimen which was aliquoted into four transport devices for
testing with the BD MAX assay and three comparator assays.
A total of eight specimens were collected from each female and included one urine specimen
(aliquoted into four transport devices), two patient-collected vaginal swabs (in a clinical
setting), two clinician-collected vaginal swabs, two endocervical swabs, and one LBC
specimen (in ThinPrep PreservCyt Solution).
Standard of care specimens were collected either separately or first within the specimen
category prior to the remaining collection used in the investigational study.
Samples were prepared for BD MAX CTGCTV2 testing in accordance with the appropriate
BD MAX specimen collection kit package insert instructions. Specimens intended for
reference testing were prepared in accordance with the instructions for use in the appropriate
specimen collection kit package insert.
Of the total subjects enrolled in the study, 11 females and 10 males were excluded due to
enrollments issues. The remaining 2,536 female subjects and 1,149 male subjects provided
specimens for testing with the BD MAX CTGCTV2 assay and the comparator assays.
After specimen exclusion for reasons such as missing specimens, transport errors,
collection errors, shipping errors, processing errors, missing reference test results or non-
reportable BD MAX test results (Indeterminate, Unresolved or Invalid), the final data
analysis of performance estimates, using evaluable specimens, included:
• For Chlamydia trachomatis, there were 2,508 patient-collected vaginal swabs, 2,502
clinician-collected vaginal swabs, 2,512 endocervical swabs, 2,469 PreservCyt LBC,
2,416 female urine and 1,140 male urine specimens;
• For Neisseria gonorrhoeae, there were 2,506 patient-collected vaginal swabs, 2,503
clinician-collected vaginal swabs, 2,511 endocervical swabs, 2,470 PreservCyt LBC,
2,419 female urine and 1,142 male urine specimens;
• For Trichomonas vaginalis, there were 1,742 patient-collected vaginal swabs, 1,732
clinician-collected vaginal swabs, 1,646 female urine and 1,141 male urine specimens.

Clinical Performance of the BD MAX CTGCTV2 Assay for the Detection of Chlamydia
trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae Infections
a. In Females with Vaginal Swabs, Endocervical Swabs, and LBC Specimens
The clinical performance of the BD MAX CTGCTV2 for the detection of Chlamydia
trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections in females was calculated compared to a
Patient Infected Status (PIS) based on testing urine and cervical specimens with two different
FDA-cleared NAATs. Female subjects were designated as infected if at least one different
reference NAAT was positive for urine and for the cervical specimen. For the purpose of data
analysis, women who tested negative in swabs with both NAATs and positive with the two
comparator NAATs in urine only, were considered non-infected (Negative PIS) when
calculating the performance of the assay with vaginal or endocervical specimens.
The clinical sensitivity of the BD MAX CTGCTV2 for the detection of Chlamydia
trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections in female vaginal swabs (patient- and clinician-
collected vaginal swabs) and cervical specimens (endocervical swab and PreservCyt LBC) is shown
below.

Based on available data generated in the study, the clinical performance of the BD MAX
CTGCTV2 assay for female vaginal swabs (patient- and clinician-collected vaginal swabs)
and cervical specimens (endocervical swab and PreservCyt LBC) was also assessed against a
PIS algorithm composed of vaginal swab and urine specimens. Comparative reference
methods included two different FDA cleared molecular tests where female subjects were
designated as infected if at least two different reference NAATs were positive for urine
and vaginal specimens. Females who tested positive with the two comparator NAATs in
urine only (negative in swabs with both NAATs), were considered non-infected

c. In Female Urine
The clinical performance of the BD MAX CTGCTV2 for the detection of Chlamydia
trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections in female urine was calculated compared to a
Composite Comparator Algorithm (CCA), where urine samples were tested with up to three
reference NAATs to generate reference results for each analyte. Female subjects were
designated as positive if at least two out of three reference NAAT results were positive.
Subjects were categorized as negative if at least two out of three reference NAAT results
were negative. The clinical performance of the BD MAX CTGCTV2 for the detection of
Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections in female urine, expressed as positive
percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) with the CCA, is shown below.

Additionally, the results obtained testing urine specimens in females with the BD MAX
CTGCTV2 assay were evaluated against the PIS based on cervical and urine algorithm.
In the clinical study conducted for the BD MAX CTGCTV2 assay, 5.8% fewer
Chlamydia trachomatis infections were detected in female urine than in clinician and
self-collected vaginal swabs and 1.9% fewer Chlamydia trachomatis infections than in
endocervical swabs. Similarly, 2.4% fewer Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections were
detected in female urine than in clinician-collected vaginal swabs and 4.7% fewer
Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections than in patient-collected vaginal swabs. There was no
difference in the detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections when comparing female
urine and endocervical swabs.

6. Positive and Negative Predictive Values
Hypothetical Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) were
calculated for patient- and clinician-collected vaginal swabs, endocervical swabs, male urine
and PreservCyt LBC specimens and are shown in Table 8. The calculations are based on
observed sensitivity and specificity for each specimen type, as compared to the Patient
Infected Status.

N. Instrument Name:
BD MAX System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or
mobile device?
Yes X or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using
wireless transmission?
Yes ________ or No X
2. Software:
a. FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes
for this line of product types: Yes X or No ________
b. Level of Concern: Moderate
c. Device Hazard Analysis: Acceptable
The hazards exclusively related to the CTGCTV2 ADF (e.g., inaccurate temperature,
incorrect magnet position, incorrect volume transfer, etc.) are included in the BD MAX
System hazard analysis (HA) (BALTRM-MAXINST-APH). All hazards were properly
documented and mitigated.
3. Specimen Identification:
Specimens are labeled with a unique bar code and following the BD MAX Specimen
Collection Kit package insert.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimens are handled through the BD MAX sample processing subsystem, which utilizes a
fluid handling robot for sampling. The instrument system includes the BD Pre-Warm Heater
(required for LBC specimens only), which is completely controlled by the BD MAX System and
does not require user intervention to operate. The specimens are loaded onto the BD MAX System
where automated processing and reporting of assay results are completed.
5. Calibration:
BD MAX does not require user calibration. All maintenance procedures, other than daily and
weekly cleaning procedures, are performed by BD qualified personnel.

6. Quality Control:
The assay includes a Specimen Processing Control (SPC) that is present in every Extraction
Tube. The SPC monitors DNA extraction steps, thermal cycling steps, reagent integrity and
the presence of inhibitory substances. External Control materials are treated as if they were
patient samples; the BD MAX software does not use QC results for the interpretation of test
results. External controls are not provided by BD and must be sourced by the user.
It is recommended that one External Positive Control and one External Negative Control be
run at least daily until adequate process validation is achieved on the BD MAX System in
each laboratory setting.
The External Positive Control is intended to monitor for substantial reagent failure. The
External Negative Control is intended to detect reagent or environmental contamination (or
carry-over) by target nucleic acids.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered in the
Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not Applicable.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
