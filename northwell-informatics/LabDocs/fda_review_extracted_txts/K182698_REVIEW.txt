immunoassay (CLIA) intended for the quantitative measurement, in human stool, of fecal
calprotectin, a neutrophilic protein that is a marker of mucosal inflammation. The
LIAISON Calprotectin assay can be used as an aid in the diagnosis of inflammatory
bowel diseases (IBD), specifically Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and as an aid in
differentiation of IBD from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Test results are to be used in
conjunction with information obtained from the patients' clinical evaluation and other
diagnostic procedures. The test has to be performed on the LIAISON XL Analyzer.

I. Device Description:
The device is an IVD reagent system consisting of:
• paramagnetic capture particles coated with monoclonal mouse antibodies against
human calprotectin
• conjugated monoclonal mouse anti-human calprotectin detection antibodies,
labeled with an isoluminol derivative
• Q.S.E.T. sample extraction buffer
• sample diluent
• wash buffer
• calibrators and controls
× controls: two levels of calprotectin, low (50 μg/g) and high (250 μg/g)

L. Test Principle:
The assay is a quantitative sandwich immunoassay, in which capture antibodies, immobilized
to the paramagnetic solid phase bind calprotectin from processed fecal samples. Washing
eliminates non-specific interactions, allowing for specific detection by conjugate antibodies
against calprotectin. Subsequent measurement of light from the bound, conjugated isoluminol
is in proportion to the quantity of bound calprotectin. The LIAISON XL Analyzer automates
the assay process steps including: incubations, washing, calibration, measurement, and
analysis.
Pre-analytical processing of fecal samples is accomplished by either manual weight
normalization, followed by homogenization in Q.S.E.T. buffer; or using the optional
Q.S.E.T. device for unitized collection and homogenization.
Following measurement, the assay reports calprotectin concentrations in units of microgram-
per-gram of starting fecal sample material (μg/g). Interpretation of fecal calprotectin
concentration ([Cal]) is as follows:
[Cal] (μg/g) Interpretation
< 50 μg/g Negative
50 ‒ 120 μg/g Borderline
>120 μg/g Positive

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity:
A pool of three stool extracts with endogenous calprotectin levels above the AMR
was diluted into 13 intervals over the range of the AMR. Diluted samples were tested
in triplicate, in random sequence, using one reagent lot. The results are summarized in
the table below:
Linearity

Slope (95% CI) 0.96 (0.93‒0.99)
Y-Intercept (95% CI) 4.14 (−13.82‒22.1)
R2 1.00
Extended Analytical Measuring Range (AMR):
The AMR for the assay was set as the linear range of 5.0 ‒ 800 μg/g. An extended
AMR for the LIAISON Calprotectin assay was evaluated using auto-dilution features
incorporated into the LIAISON XL Analyzer. To evaluate the extended AMR (800-
8000 μg/g), automated dilutions were compared to manual dilutions for three stool
samples with calprotectin concentrations above 800 μg/g, extracted using the
Q.S.E.T. device, and tested in triplicate. The results are summarized in the table
below:

Hook Effect:
Antigen excess was evaluated by testing three stool extracts spiked with exogenous
recombinant calprotectin to a final concentration of 100,000 μg/g. The spiked samples
were serially diluted 1:10 to a final concentration of 10 μg/g. Dilutions, the undiluted

spiked samples, and the unspiked native samples were tested in triplicate, using one
reagent lot. No high-dose hook effect was observed for calprotectin concentrations up
to 100,000 μg/g.
Assay Recovery:
To evaluate recovery, five high concentration stool extracts and five low
concentration stool extracts were tested neat. Recovery samples were prepared by
mixing defined ratios of high and low samples (i.e. 2:1, 1:1, 1:2), and tested in five
replicates using one reagent lot. Recovery was calculated as the observed calprotectin
concentration, as a percent ratio of the expected calprotectin concentration. Mean
recovery across all five sample pairs, replicates, and dilution ratios was 103% (± 3%).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Recognized international standards for calprotectin measurement are not available.
The LIAISON calprotectin calibrators are referenced to an in-house standard
preparation of recombinant calprotectin. Reagent integral lots include two calibrators
to establish working curves based on 10-point master curves stored on the analyzer.
Stability:
Independent evaluations of the stability of the LIAISON Calprotectin kit, the Q.S.E.T
extraction buffer, calibrators, controls, calibration verifiers, and Q.S.E.T. device are
summarized below.

In addition, critical storage parameters for stool samples were evaluated for stability,
using six samples. In addition to storing native, unextracted sample, extracts derived
from the manual extraction method or the Q.S.ET. device were stored in different
conditions, and evaluated. Data from these sample stability studies are summarized
below:

d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB): Five blank extraction buffer samples were tested in duplicate
in six runs × two operators/instruments × two lots. The LoB was calculated by the
parametric method as the 95th percentile of a corrected, normal distribution on the
mean and standard deviation. The greater value from two lots, calculated
independently, was selected.
Limit of Detection (LoD): Four low stool samples were tested in duplicate in six runs
over three days × two operators/instruments × two lots. The LoD was calculated by
the parametric method, as the 95th percentile of a corrected, normal distribution on the
mean and standard deviation, added to the LoB. The greater value from two lots,
calculated independently, was selected.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ): Nine low stool samples were tested in duplicate in six
runs over three days × two operators/instruments × two lots. The LoQ was calculated
by precision profile, calculated from the inverse power regression function
intercepting a precision target of 20%. The greater value from two lots, calculated
independently, was selected; a third lot was used for verification.
Values for detection capabilities are summarized in the table below:

e. Analytical specificity:
One stool sample extract, containing a calprotectin concentration of ~50 μg/g was
tested in triplicate in the presence of each interferent or vehicle buffer, using one
assay reagent lot. A total of four endogenous, six microbial, and 23 exogenous
interferents were evaluated, each at a single concentration. Interference was
calculated as a percent ratio of the observed calprotectin concentration to the expected
calprotectin concentration.

calprotectin values for the LIAISON calprotectin assay obtained by the manual
weight extraction method, to LIAISON calprotectin values for the same 128 samples,
selected to represent the AMR, obtained using the Q.S.E.T. device. Extracts were

3. Clinical studies:
To study the clinical performance of the LIAISON calprotectin assay, prospective
specimens were collected at 14 sites within the U.S. . The population consisted of
subjects undergoing endoscopy for evaluation of signs and symptoms of Inflammatory
Bowel Disease (IBD) or Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). A total of 240 evaluable
subjects meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria remained (see table below) after an
initial 411 subjects were recruited. These subjects included 160 female, 80 male, and 19
pediatric (<22 years of age) subjects.

For 102 IBD patients, disease status was based on the Simple Endoscopic Score for
Crohn’s disease and the Mayo Endoscopic Score for Ulcerative Colitis and Indeterminate
Colitis. For 67 IBS patients, diagnosis was based on negative colonoscopy within the
previous year and the Rome III criteria. Of the 71 patients labeled with other GI
conditions, seven diagnoses other than IBD or IBS were represented, also based in part
on negative colonoscopic findings. In order of representation, these Other GI conditions
included (with total number): diverticular disease (35), chronic diarrhea (16), recurrent
abdominal pain (11), Clostridium difficile infection (3), other GI infection (3), celiac
disease (2), and small bowel obstruction (1). Qualitative interpretation for the LIAISON
Calprotectin test for these disease categories is summarized in the table below:
