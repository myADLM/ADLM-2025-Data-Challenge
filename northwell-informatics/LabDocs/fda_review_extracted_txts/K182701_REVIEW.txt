Wondfo T-Cup® Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup offers any combinations from 2 to 15 drugs
of abuse tests but only one cutoff concentration under same drug condition will be
included per device. It is for in vitro diagnostic use only.
The tests may yield positive results for the prescription drugs Buprenorphine,
Nortriptyline, Oxazepam, Secobarbital, Propoxyphene, and Oxycodone when taken at or
above prescribed doses. It is not intended to distinguish between prescription use or abuse
of these drugs. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any
drug of abuse test result, particularly in evaluating a preliminary positive result.
The tests provide only preliminary results. To obtain a confirmed analytical result, a more
specific alternate chemical method must be used. GC/MS or LC/MS is the recommended
confirmatory method.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For over the counter use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable.
I. Device Description:
The Wondfo T-Cup® Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup is a rapid, single-use in vitro diagnostic
device. Each test kit contains a test device in one pouch. One pouch contains a test T-Cup
and two desiccants, a package insert, and a urine cup for sample collection.

in the urine sample is below the cutoff level, the target drug will not saturate the binding sites
of its specific monoclonal antibody-coated particles. The antibody-coated particles will then
be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible colored band will be formed on the
test line region. If the concentration of target is beyond the cutoff level, the target drug will
saturate the binding sites of its specific monoclonal antibody-particles, thus the antibody-
coated particles will not be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate hence no colored band
will be formed on the test line region. A band should be formed on the control line region
regardless of the presence of target drug or metabolite in the sample to indicate that the tests
have been performed properly.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of -100% cutoff, -
75% cut off, -50% cutoff, -25% cutoff, cutoff, +25% cutoff, +50% cutoff, +75%
cutoff and +100% cutoff. Samples with concentration of -100% cutoff were drug-free
urines samples. Other samples were prepared by spiking target drug in drug-free urine
samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by LC/MS or GC/MS. For each
concentration, tests were performed two runs per day for 25 days using three lots of
test cups. The results of a representative lot are summarized in the following tables:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device has internal process controls. A colored line appearing in the control
region confirms sufficient sample volume and adequate membrane wicking. Users are
informed that the test is invalid if a line fails to appear in the control region. There are
no external controls supplied with the device.
Device stability has been evaluated through accelerated and long-term studies.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The
manufacturer claims that the devices are stable for two years (24 months) when stored
at 4–30º C.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity for this device was determined through adding the potential
interfering substances to drug-free urine samples. The relative cross-reactivity
represents the minimum concentration necessary to yield a result similar to the cutoff
level of the respective assay. Percent cross-reactivity, provided in the below table,
was calculated as the concentration of analyte tested that yielded a positive result,
divided by the cutoff concentration, multiplied by 100; compounds that did not yield
a positive result at the highest concentration tested have relative cross reactivity
results represented by a dash in the table below.

Interference by pH and specific gravity were also evaluated using pooled urine
specimens containing target drugs at near-cutoff concentrations (at +25% and -25%
of cutoff). The results demonstrated that pH levels of 4 to 9 and specific gravity levels
of 1.003 to 1.035 do not affect the results of the assays.
f. Assay cut-off:
For characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed
cutoff concentration, please refer to section M.1.a., above.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison study of the Wondfo T-Cup® Multi-Drug Urine Test cup
was performed by three operators with 80 unaltered urine samples. The samples were
blind labeled and compared to LC/MS or GC/MS results. The results are shown in the
table below.

A lay user study was performed involving a total of 280 participants from 3 sites. 89
males and 51 females tested T-Cup® Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup Configuration 1
(including AMP 500, MET 500, MOP 300, COC 150) ; 84 male and 56 females
tested T-Cup® Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup Configuration 2 (Group 2, including AMP
1000, MET 1000, MOP 2000 (OPI), COC 300). Each participant was provided one
package insert, one blind labeled test solution, and one test device. Test solutions
were randomly assigned to participants, one for each. Following testing, users
completed a study questionnaire to assess usability and user comprehension, and the
results from this questionnaire were found to be acceptable. Participants aged 20 and
