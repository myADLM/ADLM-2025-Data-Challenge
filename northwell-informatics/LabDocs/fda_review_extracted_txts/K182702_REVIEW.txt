L. Test Principle:
The SEKURE CK Assay employs the reverse reaction of CK, to produce adenosine
triphosphate (ATP). The reaction is coupled to hexokinase and G6PDH which consumes
ATP to generate NADPH. The rate of NADPH formation is monitored at 340 nm and is
directly proportional to CK activity.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Testing was conducted following the recommendations in the CLSI EP05-A3
guideline using two lots of SEKURE CK reagents on one SK500 analyzer. Two
levels of sera controls, one level of pooled serum, and three levels of pooled plasma
were assayed in duplicate in two runs a day for twenty (20) days. The precision study
results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were performed following the recommendations in the CLSI EP06-
A guideline. Linearity testing for serum was conducted using eight dilutions of
pooled high serum sample with saline to generate a CK activity range from 0 - 1650
U/L. Linearity testing for plasma was conducted using ten dilutions and admixtures of
pooled plasma to generate a CK activity range from 3 - 2700 U/L. Testing of all
samples was conducted in quadruplicate using two lots of SEKURE CK reagent on
one SK500 analyzer. Deviation of the mean observed value from the calculated
theoretical value was determined for each sample in the series. The maximum
deviation from linearity observed was <11%. The linearity study data supports the
claimed measuring range for the SEKURE CK Assay of 11 to 1500 U/L for serum
and plasma.
Dilution Recovery Studies:
The sponsor provided data supporting their claim that creatine kinase sample values
above the assay measuring range can be accurately determined by diluting (3x) in

saline and assaying with the SEKURE Creatine Kinase-SL Assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The SEKURE Creatine Kinase Assay is traceable to an IFCC reference method.
d. Detection limit:
Limits of detection studies were performed following the recommendations in the
CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined as the 95th percentile of measurements of
blank samples. The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined as the lowest amount of
analyte in a sample detected with a 95% probability. Testing was conducted by
analyzing low level samples (saline blanks and dilutions of pooled serum or plasma in
saline) in quadruplicate for three days (12 replicates per sample) producing 60
measurements total. All samples were assayed on two lots of SEKURE CK reagents
and one SK500 analyzer. The LoB and LoD were determined individually for each
reagent lot, dilution level, and matrix type.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) testing was conducted using eight linear serum
samples and eight linear plasma samples, ranging from normal (~100 U/L) to zero on
two SEKURE CK reagent lots. Each sample was assayed in quadruplicate on five
runs over three days to give 40 replicates per sample. The LoQ was determined as the
lowest CK activity value at which the %CV was ≤20%.
The results of the evaluation of the detection limits and final claim are summarized in
the following table:
Analyte LoB LoD LoQ
CK (U/L) 3 5 11
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was performed following the recommendations in the CLSI
EP07-A2 guideline to assess common or known substances that could interfere with
the CK Assay. Interference testing was conducted using two lots of SEKURE CK
reagent on one SK500 analyzer. All interferents were evaluated at CK concentrations
of 180 and 415 U/L using serum samples. A minimum of seven concentrations of
interferent were assessed. Each sample was tested in replicates of five on each reagent
lot and compared to a control sample. Significant interference was defined by the
sponsor as a percent difference greater than 10% from control.
Results are summarized in the table below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 114 serum specimens were tested in duplicate over eight operating days on
the candidate and predicate device. Two samples were excluded from the data
analysis as they exceeded the reportable range of the assay. The remaining 112 serum
specimens had a CK range of 28 to 1409 U/L. Five of the samples included in the
data analysis were spiked to evaluate the high end of the assay measuring interval.
First replicate data collected on the candidate method and mean sample data collected
on the predicate method were evaluated using Deming regression analysis and gave
the following equation:
y = 0.964 x + 2.4 U/L, r = 0.9998
b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison testing was conducted to evaluate the suitability of lithium
heparin plasma with the SEKURE CK Assay on the SK500 analyzer. A set of 75
matched serum and lithium heparin plasma specimens were assayed in duplicate
using two lots of CK reagents on one SK500 analyzer. Thirteen of these samples were
contrived samples. The CK activity ranged from 38 to 1487 U/L. Deming regression
analysis was generated using first replicate data from plasma and mean sample values
from serum and gave the following equation:
y = 1.015 x -3.4 U/L, r = 0.9991
