1. Intended use:
The EntericBio Dx assay, performed on ABI 7500 Fast Dx real-time instrument, is an in
vitro multiplexed nucleic acid test for the direct, simultaneous, qualitative detection and
identification of multiple enteric pathogens in Cary-Blair preserved stool specimens from
individuals with signs and symptoms of infectious colitis or gastroenteritis. The test is
based on detection of nucleic acids from:
• Salmonella enterica spp.
• Shigella spp./ Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC)
• Campylobacter spp. (jejuni, coli and lari)
• STEC (Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli), stx1/ stx2 genes
• Vibrio spp. (cholerae and parahaemolyticus)
• Giardia lamblia (also known as G. intestinalis and G. duodenalis)
• Entamoeba histolytica
Testing is performed on Cary-Blair preserved diarrheal specimens from symptomatic
patients with suspected acute gastroenteritis, enteritis or colitis of bacterial or parasitic
origin. The test is performed directly on the specimen, utilizing real-time polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) for the amplification of Salmonella-specific, Campylobacter-
specific, Shigella/ EIEC-specific ipaH, stx1/stx2, Vibrio-specific, Entamoeba-specific and
Giardia-specific gene sequences. The test utilizes fluorogenic sequence-specific
hybridization probes for the detection of the amplified DNA.
This test is intended for use, in conjunction with clinical presentation, laboratory findings
and epidemiological information, as an aid in the diagnosis of Salmonella, Shigella /
EIEC, Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli, Campylobacter spp., Vibrio spp., Entamoeba
histolytica and Giardia spp. infections in humans.
Results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other
patient management decisions. Positive results do not rule out co-infection with other
organisms that are not detected by this test and may not be the sole or definitive cause of
patient illness. Negative EntericBio Dx assay results in the setting of clinical illness

A Copan FLOQSwab is used to transfer the Cary-Blair preserved specimen to the EntericBio
Stool Preparation Solution (SPS). The SPS tube is closed with a pierceable cap and
transferred to the EntericBio Heatstation for lysis at 103°C for 30 minutes. The heat-treated
specimens are then placed on the EntericBio Workstation for fully automated transfer of the
processed samples directly to lyophilized PCR reaction wells. The wells are capped,
vortexed, centrifuged and transferred to the ABI 7500 Fast Dx real-time PCR instrument for
amplification.
The EntericBio Dx assay utilizes real-time multiplex PCR technology based on
hydrolysis probe reagent chemistry. The amplified targets are detected by the ABI 7500
Fast Dx instrument using target-specific probes, labelled at one end with a fluorescent
reporter dye (fluorophore) and at the other end with a quencher molecule.
The probes (for assay target analytes and IAC) are labelled with different fluorophores to
allow simultaneous detection of multiple targets in one reaction, in different optical
channels of the ABI 7500 Fast Dx instrument.
The fluorescence data generated by the ABI 7500 Fast Dx instrument and SDS Dx Software
are automatically analyzed with the UgenTec FastFinder EntericBio Dx plugin.
M. Performance Characteristics
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was performed to assess the inter-site and overall
reproducibility of the EntericBio Dx assay. Reproducibility testing was performed in-
house, simulating a multi-site study using three instruments, multiple operators and
panels of contrived stool samples. Positive panel members were prepared using
natural negative stool matrix spiked with various combinations of Vibrio
parahaemolyticus, Shigella sonnei and Giardia lamblia. These three target analytes
were representative of each of the three component multiplex assays of EntericBio
Dx. Each analyte was evaluated at two different concentrations (Low Positive at 1.5x
LoD and Moderate Positive at 3x LoD) using three batches of EntericBio Dx assay
reagents. A true negative specimen was also included in the study. Reproducibility
panels containing randomized panel members were tested at each of three
independent in-house testing areas by two different operators for five non-consecutive
days. Sample identities were blinded to the user.
Results from the study demonstrated 100% agreement with the expected result for
moderate positive samples tested at all three in-house sites. For low-positive samples,
samples containing Shigella sonnei and Vibrio parahaemolyticus samples generated
100% agreement with the expected positive results and samples containing Giardia
lamblia generated 98% agreement to the expected positive result. A summary of
qualitative results (percent agreement with the expected result) for each analyte is
shown in Table 1.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Internal Amplification Control (IAC)
The IAC is lyophilized into each of reaction wells of the EntericBio Dx strip and is
resuspended automatically on the EntericBio Workstation. The IAC is included to
monitor for PCR inhibition and reagent/amplification failure for each specimen
tested. Specimens cannot be considered as negative without a valid result for the IAC
in the sample well. Specimens that are negative for assay targets and which also have
a failed IAC in the corresponding well should be retested from the original Cary-Blair
preserved fecal sample in accordance with the assay instructions for use. A specimens
with a failed IAC is reported as invalid by the assay software.
EntericBio Positive Control
Each box of the EntericBio Dx kit is supplied with a Positive Control. The Positive
Control, containing nucleic acids for all assay target analytes, is provided in a
lyophilized form and is reconstituted prior to its first use. The Positive Control is
tested with each batch of specimens processed with the EntericBio Dx assay to
monitor the PCR amplification process for potential reagent and/or process failures. If
the Positive Control is negative for any of the assay target analytes, the EntericBio
FastFinder plugin will report the result as invalid and the run must be repeated.
Negative Control:
Each EntericBio Dx assay kit includes EntericBio Resuspension Buffer which is used
to re-suspend the lyophilized PCR reagents and is also used as a negative (No
Template) control for the assay. Fresh negative control is prepared for each run of the
EntericBio Dx assay by transferring an aliquot of the EntericBio Resuspension Buffer
to an empty EntericBio SPS tube. This negative control is used to monitor for any
carry-over/contamination of the run. If the negative control is positive for any of the
assay targets, the EntericBio FastFinder plugin will report the result as invalid and the
run must be repeated.
External controls:
Because the EntericBio Dx positive and negative kit controls do not undergo the heat
lysis steps of the assay, external positive and negative specimen controls were also
included in each test run performed during the clinical study. Each targeted analyte
was included in the external control scheme with one analyte included per control and
using a rotation of one positive control (analyte) per run.
Clinical study, control results
A total of 276 positive and 276 negative EntericDx kit controls were tested in the
clinical study to monitor the performance of the EntericBio Dx assay. Valid expected
11

--- Page 12 ---
results were observed for 272 (98.6 %) and 269 (97.5 %) for the positive and negative
kit controls respectively.
In addition, a total of 276 external positive controls and 276 external negative
specimen controls were tested in the clinical study. Valid expected results were
observed for 270 (97.8 %) and 272 (98.6 %) for the positive and negative external
controls respectively.
Specimen Stability
A study was conducted to validate appropriate specimen storage conditions for the
EntericBio Dx assay. Samples evaluated included one strain for microorganism target
and were prepared by spiking negative Cary-Blair preserved stool specimens with
microorganisms at low positive concentrations. All replicates were tested for each
panel such that a baseline reading, Time 0, was taken prior to storage at 2-8°C.
Sample replicates were also tested at days three, five, and six.
Results for each specific storage condition were considered acceptable if at least nine
of the ten replicates were positive for the expected target analyte. As shown in Table
3 below, results of the study met the pre-determined acceptance criteria for claimed
specimen storage conditions (up to 5 five days at 2-8°C). It was noted however that
testing of samples with Giardia and Entamoeba histolytica generated higher Cq
values after storage. Therefore the labeling indicates to test specimens as soon as
possible after collection and if required, Cary-Blair preserved specimens can be
stored for up to 5 days at 2-8oC prior to testing. In addition, the following limitation
has been added to the assay product labelling:
• “Where possible, specimens should be tested immediately upon receipt in the
laboratory. There is an increased potential for false negative results for
Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica in specimens with low analyte
concentrations if specimens are not tested immediately.”

Storage of inoculated EntericBio SPS tubes prior to heat-treatment:
A study was conducted to evaluate specimen stability of inoculated EntericBio SPS
specimens prior to heat-treatment. Three representative targeted microorganisms were
spiked at low positive concentrations into pre-screened negative Cary-Blair preserved
stool. Testing included a total of 10 replicates per microorganism and three
temperature storage conditions. All replicates were detected for each microorganism
evaluated. when inoculated SPS samples were stored at 2-8°C, 20°C and 30°C for
nine hours prior to heat treatment on the EntericBio Heatstation. Additionally, there
were no significant differences in Cq values between initial testing and after storage
of samples at either of the three storage temperatures evaluated. The study results
support the package insert instructions indicating that inoculated EntericBio SPS
tubes can be stored at room temperature prior to heat-treatment but must be processed
within six hours of inoculation.
Storage of specimens in heat-treated EntericBio SPS tubes:
A study was conducted to evaluate specimen stability of inoculated EntericBio SPS
specimens post heat-treatment and prior to loading of PCR wells using the EntericBio
Workstation. Three representative targeted microorganisms were spiked at low
positive concentrations into pre-screened negative Cary-Blair preserved stool. Testing
included a total of 10 replicates per microorganism and three temperature storage
conditions. All replicates were detected for each of the microorganisms evaluated.

processing on the EntericBio Workstation.
Stability of loaded EntericBio Dx PCR strips:
A study was conducted to evaluate the stability of inoculated PCR strips when there is
a delay in loading onto the ABI 7500 Fast Dx instrument. For this study, three
representative targeted microorganisms were spiked at low positive concentrations
into pre-screened negative Cary-Blair preserved stool. A total of 10 replicates were
tested per organism and timeframe evaluated. All targets tested were detected in
100% of replicates that were evaluated after a one hour delay on the EntericBio Dx
Workstation after loading of PCR strips. Furthermore, there were no significant
differences in Cq values generated between initial testing of samples and after the one
hour delay on the Workstation and prior to loading on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx
instrument. The results of the study support the package insert instructions indicating
that loaded PCR strips must be process on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx instrument within
20 minutes.
Heat station timing: The package insert instructions indicate that inoculated SPS
tubes should be treated on the Heat Station for 30 minutes ± 5 mins. A study was
conducted to test the effect of heat-treatment duration for inoculated samples
processed on the EntericBio Heatstation. The procedure outlined in the instructions
for use was followed except inoculated SPS were heat-treated for either 20, 30 or 40
minutes at 103oC before processing on the EntericBio Workstation. Samples were
prepared using three representative targeted microorganisms spiked at low positive
concentrations into pre-screened negative Cary-Blair preserved stool. A total of 10
replicates were tested per microorganism for each timepoint evaluated. All targets
tested were detected in 100% of replicates tested for 20 minutes, 30 minutes and 40
minutes on the EntericBio Heatstation. Results of the study support the package insert
instructions for heat-treatment of inoculated SPS specimens for 30 mins ± 5 mins.
d. Limit of Detection (LoD):
The analytical sensitivity (LoD, limit of detection) of the EntericBio Dx assay was
determined using contrived samples with target analytes spiked into a negative stool
matrix (Cary-Blair preserved stool) at three concentrations: greater than estimated
LoD (High), estimated LoD (Medium) and less than LoD (Low). A total of 20
replicate SPS tubes were tested per level using three assay lots for a total of 60
replicates per microorganism concentration. If 100% of replicates were positive at the
initially lowest concentration, additional testing was performed at a lower
concentration and the LoD was determined as the lowest analyte concentration that
was detected ≥95% of the time. A minimum of two strains were tested for each
EntericBio Dx analyte. Table 4 lists the LoDs determined for the strains evaluated in
the study.

e. Analytical Reactivity/Inclusivity:
The analytical reactivity (inclusivity) of the EntericBio Dx assay was evaluated with
a collection of 101 microorganisms that represent the analytes detected by the assay.
Samples were prepared using quantified whole microorganism preparations that
were spiked into negative stool matrix (Cary-Blair preserved) at low positive
concentrations of approximately 3x LoD for each assay target. Each sample was
multi-spiked with up to three microorganisms, typically with one targeted analyte
per each of the three multiplex assays of the EntericBio Dx assay. Testing was
performed in triplicate.
The expected positive results were generated for all strains/replicates evaluated in
the study demonstrating inclusivity of the EntericBio Dx assay. The strains evaluated
are shown in Table 5. Also included in the table are four E. coli serotypes that are
predicted to be positive for STEC (stx1/stx2) based on in silico analyses.

specimens were prepared in a negative stool matrix (i.e., Cary-Blair preserved stool)
by spiking microorganisms at high concentrations of greater than 106 CFU/mL or 106
cells/mL. Nucleic acid preparations were used to prepare samples at concentrations of
106 genomic copies/mL for microorganisms that are difficult to culture or for which it
is challenging to achieve high concentrations of whole microorganisms. Testing of
each microorganism was performed in triplicate. Samples that were negative for 3/3
replicates were considered to be non-cross-reactive between the assay and the
microorganisms.
The majority of microorganisms listed in Table 6 generated the expected negative
results for all three replicates tested. For microorganisms that were unexpectedly
positive, additional in silico analysis and bi-directional sequencing was conducted to
evaluate the potential reason(s) for cross-reactivity.
Microorganisms evaluated in the study are listed in Table 6 and those demonstrating
cross-reactivity are listed in Table 7.

1 Microorganisms for which testing was performed using genomic DNA
2Cryptosporidium viatorum: Shigella detected in 3/3 replicates. Bi-directional sequencing demonstrated the presence of Shigella
DNA suggesting possible sample contamination with Shigella. In silico analysis indicated no cross-reactivity should occur.
3 Cryptosporidium cuniculus: Giardia detected in 2/3 replicates. Bi-directional sequencing of amplicon failed and thus it could
not be confirmed empirically if the sample was contaminated with Giardia or if cross reactivity-occurred. In silico analysis
indicated no cross-reactivity should occur.
4 Cryptosporidium xiaoi: Campylobacter detected in 3/3 replicates. Bi-directional sequencing demonstrated the presence of
Campylobacter DNA suggesting possible sample contamination with Campylobacter. In silico analysis indicated no cross-
reactivity should occur.
5 Entamoeba dispar: IAC failures were observed for 5/6 replicates after repeat testing. In silico analysis demonstrated homology
for the primers and predicts amplification to occur and competitively inhibit the IAC, but the probe has several mismatches and is
not expected to produce a detected signal.
6 Eubacterium rectale: Campylobacter detected in 3/3 replicates and Vibrio in 1/3 replicates. Bi-directional sequencing
demonstrated the presence of Campylobacter and Vibrio DNA suggesting possible sample contamination with Vibrio and
Campylobacter. In silico analysis indicated no cross-reactivity should occur.
7 Anaerostipes hadrus: Campylobacter detected in 2/3 replicates. Bi-directional sequencing demonstrated the presence of
Campylobacter DNA suggesting possible sample contamination with Campylobacter. In silico analysis indicated no cross-
reactivity should occur.
8 Vibrio vulnificus: Evaluated by in silico analysis only. In silico analysis indicated no cross-reactivity should occur.
9 Campylobacter sputorum: Vibrio detected in 1/3 replicates. Bi-directional sequencing demonstrated the presence of Vibrio DNA
suggesting possible sample contamination with Vibrio. In silico analysis indicated no cross-reactivity should occur.

g. Assay cut-off:
The EntericBio Dx assay performed on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx instrument uses
FastFinder software with EntericBio Dx plug-in to generate final results. The
software uses proprietary decision algorithms to convert ABI 7500 Fast Dx raw data
and translates these results into final qualitative results. The decision algorithms used
to generate results are used for all controls and patient specimens. Any specimens
with failed IACs or indeterminate final results are reported as invalid to the user. The
final results reported to the end user are positive, negative or invalid.
h. Microbial Interference
A study was conducted to assess non-targeted microorganisms for their potential to
interfere with detection of microorganisms that are targeted by the EntericBio Dx
assay. A total of 11 potentially interfering microorganisms were tested at high
concentrations (i.e., 106 CFU/mL) in the presence of EntericBio Dx target analytes at
low concentrations. Samples were prepared using quantitated whole microorganism
preparations of target (Table 8) and non-target (Table 9) microorganisms spiked into
a negative stool specimen matrix. Testing of each microorganism combination was
performed in triplicate. Control samples containing only potentially interfering
microorganisms were also tested.

Results from the study showed no microbial interference with any of the 11 non-
targeted microorganisms evaluated as there were no false negative results for targeted
microorganisms. Additionally, there were no false positive results or IAC failures
observed in control samples which contained only non-targeted microorganisms.
i. Interfering Substances
A study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the EntericBio Dx assay for
samples containing 23 potentially interfering substances, at high, but clinically
relevant levels that might be present in fecal specimens. Each substance was tested in
the presence of each target analyte (Table 8 above) at low positive concentrations.
Samples were prepared using quantified microorganism preparations and each
potentially interfering substance spiked into negative stool matrix. Testing was
performed in triplicate for each microorganism/substance combination. Control
samples containing each potentially interfering substance in a negative stool matrix
without targeted analytes were also tested.
Results of the study demonstrated that the presence of 21/23 potentially interfering
substances at the concentrations listed in Table 10 below had no effect on the
detection of the target analytes or the EntericBio Dx assay internal control. A false
negative result for V. parahaemolyticus was observed for 1/3 sample replicates
containing hemorrhoidal cream (1% w/v) and false negative results for C. jejuni were
observed for 2/3 sample replicates containing tetracycline (1.6% w/v).
For the following substances, interference was observed for samples containing
higher concentrations than are listed in Table 10 below.
Benzalkonium chloride (Initial testing at 50% v/v):
• For samples without target microorganism, initial testing for samples with
Benzalkonium chloride (50% v/v) generated failed IACs for all three
replicates. The substance was then evaluated at progressively lower

concentrations. A concentration of 1.0% v/v was the highest concentration
for which the IAC was detected for all replicates.
• For samples with targeted microorganism, the presence of this substance at a
concentration greater than 0.15% v/v generated false negative results for one
or more targets.
Hemorrhoidal cream (Initial testing at 50% v/v):
• For samples without targeted microorganism, initial testing for samples with
Hemorrhoidal cream (50% v/v) generated failed IACs for all three replicates.
The substance was then evaluated at progressively lower concentrations. A
concentration of 1.0% w/v was the highest concentration for which the IAC
was detected for all replicates.
• For samples with targeted microorganism, the presence of this substance at a
concentration greater than 1% v/v demonstrated false negative results for one
or more targets.
Whole Human Blood: For samples with targeted microorganism, the presence of
human whole blood at concentrations >5% v/v generated false negative results for
one or more targets.
Magnesium Hydroxide: For samples with targeted microorganism, the presence of
magnesium hydroxide at concentrations greater than 0.5% w/v generated false
negative results for one or more targets.
Tetracycline: For samples with targeted microorganisms, the presence of tetracycline
at concentrations of >0.8% w/v generated false negative results for one or more
targets.
Sulfamethoxazole: For samples with targeted microorganism, the presence of
sulfamethoxazole at concentrations greater than 0.5% w/v generated false negative
results for one or more targets.
Loperamide hydrochloride: For samples with targeted microorganism, the presence of
loperamide hydrochloride at concentrations greater than 4% w/v demonstrated false
negative results for one or more targets.
Amoxicillin: For samples with targeted microorganism, the presence of amoxicillin at
concentrations greater than 1% w/v generated false negative results for one or more
targets.

j. Competitive Inhibition
A study was conducted to evaluate the potential for competitive inhibition between
analytes targeted by the EntericBio Dx assay. Testing included samples containing two
microorganisms detected in PCR Well A (Salmonella and Campylobacter) and two
microorganisms detected PCR Well C (Giardia and Entamoeba). The analytes in Well
B (Vibrio cholerae/parahaemolyticus and STEC) were not evaluated in this study;
however, co-infections of these two analytes are expected to be rare.
The study was performed using Cary-Blair preserved negative stool samples spiked
with dual EntericBio Dx analyte combinations at high and low concentrations (Table
11). Testing was performed in triplicate and generated expected results for all
microorganism combinations except for samples containing Giardia lamblia and
Entamoeba histolytica (bolded in Table 11). False negative results for Giardia lamblia
were observed for all sample replicates containing either low or high concentrations of
Entamoeba histolytica. A limitation indicating this interference is also included in the
limitation section of the package insert for the EntericBio Dx assay.

k. Carryover/Cross-Contamination:
A study was conducted to investigate the potential for carryover or cross-
contamination when using the EntericBio Dx assay on the EntericBio Workstation. In
each run, samples with a high concentration of target microorganism(s) were
processed in an alternating sequence with negative samples. Contrived samples were
prepared in a negative stool matrix (Cary-Blair preserved stool) with one bacterial
analyte (Shigella sonnei) and one parasitic target (Giardia lamblia). Microorganisms
were spiked at a high concentrations (1x 107 CFU/mL and 1 x 105 cells/mL for
Shigella sonnei and Giardia lamblia respectively). Negative samples consisted of
negative stool matrix. The study consisted of six runs with three runs containing
Shigella sonnei and three runs containing Giardia lamblia samples. Each run
contained 30 samples (15 positive and 15 negative). Results from the study
demonstrated no false positive results and therefore no evidence of
carryover/contamination within run or between runs when using the EntericBio Dx
assay on the EntericBio Workstation.

The performance of the EntericBio Dx assay was evaluated using the following specimen
cohorts:
1) Fresh, prospectively-collected, Cary-Blair preserved fecal specimens from patients
presenting with symptoms of gastrointestinal infection;
2) Fresh, selected Cary-Blair preserved fecal specimens from patients presenting with
symptoms of gastrointestinal infection. Specimens were selected based on the
results obtained with Standard of Care (SoC) methods in use at the study sites;
3) Frozen, well characterized Cary-Blair preserved fecal specimens from patients
presenting with symptoms of gastrointestinal infection, known to be positive for
selected target analytes based on routine diagnostic methods used by the collection
sites;
4) Contrived Cary-Blair preserved fecal samples for lower prevalence targets
The performance of the EntericBio Dx assay in fresh prospectively tested fresh
specimens, selected fresh specimens and archived specimens was evaluated by
comparing the EntericBio Dx assay result for each target analyte with results obtained
from FDA-cleared assays. For the STEC and Campylobacter analytes, a composite
comparator method of three FDA-cleared assays was used for the fresh prospective and
fresh selected specimen cohorts. A specimen was characterised as positive if two out of
three comparator assays were positive and a specimen was characterized as negative if
two out of three comparator assays were negative. For the remaining analytes (fresh
specimens) and for all analytes (archived specimens), the comparator method consisted of
one FDA-cleared assay.
A total of 1523 fresh Cary-Blair fecal specimens (1491 prospective, 32 select) were
enrolled during the clinical trial. Of the 1491 prospective samples, 19 were excluded
from the study, giving 1472 evaluable samples. The reasons for exclusion included
invalid test result for the EntericBio Dx assay (n=9) or by the comparator method (n=6),
Indeterminate result by the EntericBio Dx assay (n=1), specimen not tested with
comparator method within specimen stability (n=2) or a duplicate specimen from a
previously enrolled patient (n=1).
Table 12 provides a summary of demographic information for the fresh specimens
enrolled in the clinical study.

Several analytes had low prevalence for the fresh specimen cohorts; therefore, 212
archived frozen positive specimens were included in the study. Specimens consisted of a
mix of Cary-Blair preserved specimens and unpreserved specimens transferred to Cary-
Blair upon enrollment. Specimens were selected based on historic testing results for the
desired target analytes by routine diagnostic methods used by the collection sites.
Although standard of care results were used for selection of specimens for inclusion in
the study, assay performance was evaluated by comparing EntericBio Dx results to
results from one FDA-cleared comparator assay.
Of the 212 archived specimens enrolled into the study, three specimens were excluded,
resulting in 209 evaluable specimens. The reasons for exclusion were invalid (n=1) and
Indeterminate results (n=2) for the EntericBio Dx assay.
Archived specimens were distributed across three clinical testing sites were randomized
such that the users performing the testing were blinded as to the expected test result.
Table 13 provides a summary of demographic information for the archived specimens
enrolled in the clinical study.

To supplement the fresh and frozen specimen data for very low prevalence
microorganisms (Vibrio and Entamoeba histolytica), contrived specimens (n=310) were
prepared and tested with the EntericBio Dx assay. Each contrived specimen was prepared
using a unique fecal matrix from residual fresh specimens which had previously tested
negative for all analytes. Contrived specimens were spiked at various levels, with the
majority of specimens for each analyte having microorganism concentrations near the
LoD (i.e., 1.5x-3x LoD). Contrived positive specimens were randomized with negative
specimens for blinding purposes. Strains used for preparation of contrived specimens are
listed in Table 14.

Of the 310 contrived specimens evaluated in the clinical study, there were no specimens
excluded from the study. Performance was evaluated by comparing the test result for
each target analyte to the expected result, based on the microorganism used for spiking.

and all were concordant with the comparator method(s) used for the respective target
analytes. The summary of the multi-detections reported by the EntericBio Dx assay is
presented in Table 22.
For analytes reported by the EntericBio Dx assay, the comparator assay(s) reported
multiple microorganism detections for a total of five specimens (0.33%, 5/1504). All
multiple detections contained two target analytes. For these specimens the EntericBio Dx
assay did not detect a second target analyte in two specimens and none of the discordant
specimens reported as co-infections by the comparator method were confirmed with an
alternative FDA-cleared assay. The summary of the multi-detections reported by the
comparator assay is presented in Table 23.

Of the 1482 prospective (fresh) specimens initially evaluated with EntericBio Dx assay,
28 specimens (1.9%) initially generated Invalid results. Repeat testing of these specimens
generated valid results for 19 specimens and invalid results for six specimens. Repeat
testing was not performed for the remaining three specimens. None of the 32 select
(fresh) specimens were initially reported as invalid. Of the 212 retrospective specimens
initially evaluated with EntericBio Dx assay, two specimens (0.9%) were initially
reported as Invalid. Repeat testing of one specimen generated a valid result. Repeat
testing was not performed for the other specimen. Table 24 includes the initial and final
invalid rates for each specimen cohort as observed during the clinical study.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
In the prospective study clinical evaluation of the EntericBio Dx assay, a total of 1504
eligible fresh fecal specimens in Cary-Blair medium were tested at three geographically
diverse locations, two in the United States (Site 1, Site 2) and one outside of the United
States (Site 3). The number and percentage of positive results for each of the seven target
microorganisms as determined by the EntericBio assay are stratified by testing site and
presented in Table 27 below. Overall, the EntericBio assay detected at least one
microorganism in 9.2% (138/1504) of the fresh specimens.
