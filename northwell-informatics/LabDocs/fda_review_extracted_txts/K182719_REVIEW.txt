This test provides only a preliminary test result. Clinical consideration and professional
judgment must be applied to any drug test result, particularly in evaluating a preliminary
positive result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used to obtain a
confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectroscopy (GC/MS), Liquid
Chromatography / Mass Spectroscopy / Mass Spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) and High
Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) are common confirmatory methods.

(depending on the test analyte) and drug conjugates labeled with a fluorescent dye or
immobilized on the solid phase and stabilizers.
The Quidel Triage® TOX Drug Screen, 94600 is inserted into and read by the Quidel Triage®
MeterPro. Threshold concentrations are factory calibrated and are used to determine a
negative result or a presumptive positive result for the presence of the major urinary
metabolites of the following substances in human urine: amphetamine (AMP),
methamphetamine (mAMP), barbiturates (BAR), benzodiazepines (BZO), cocaine (COC),
methadone metabolite, (2- ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine), (EDDP),
opiates (OPI), cannabinoid (THC), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCA).
The Quidel Triage TOX Drug Screen, 94600 Test is provided as a kit that contains 25 test
devices, 25 transfer pipettes, one reagent CODE CHIP Module and 2 printer paper rolls. The
test device is individually wrapped for one time use only.

Quidel Triage® MeterPro, and Quidel Triage TOX Drug Screen, 94600 Control 1 and 2 are
needed but not provided with the kit.
The Quidel Triage® MeterPro is a portable fluorescence instrument. It uses a laser diode as
the excitation light source and a silicon photodiode as the light detector for the reaction.
Light from the laser hits a test device that has been inserted in the meter. This causes the
fluorescent dye in the test device to give off energy, and this fluorescence is captured by the
light detector. The amount of fluorescence produced directly correlates with analyte
concentrations in an analyte-specific manner. Results are displayed on a liquid crystal
display or hard copies can be printed via the internal printer.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The Quidel Triage TOX Drug Screen, 94600 is a competitive fluorescence immunoassay
which contains all the reagents necessary for the qualitative detection, relative to an assigned
threshold value, of the major urinary metabolites of the following substances in human urine:
amphetamine (AMP), methamphetamine (mAMP), barbiturates (BAR), benzodiazepines
(BZO), cocaine (COC), methadone/methadone metabolite (EDDP), opiates (OPI),
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCA).
The tests use monoclonal antibodies against 9 targeted drugs or metabolites in the patient
urine sample. The tests utilize a competitive immunoassay format in which the fluorescence
results are inversely proportional to the analyte concentration. If the assay spot concentration
is less than the assay-specific threshold then the result will be reported as positive. If the
assay spot concentration is equal to or greater than the test-specific threshold then the result
will be reported as negative.
The tests contain positive on-board test device controls. Before calculating whether the test
is positive or negative for each assay spot, the algorithm checks to ensure that the acceptance
criteria for the on-board test device controls have been met. If any have not been met, the
assay result is reported as invalid.
The test procedure involves the addition of a urine specimen to the sample port on the Test
Device. After addition of the specimen, the urine passes through a filter. The specimen
reacts with fluorescent antibody conjugates or with fluorescent drug conjugates and flows
through the Test Device by capillary action. The presence of drug or drug metabolite in the
urine specimen prevents binding of the fluorescent conjugates to the solid phase on the
detection zone. Excess urine washes the unbound fluorescent conjugates from the detection

lane into a waste reservoir.
The Test Device is inserted into the Quidel Triage® MeterPro. The Quidel Triage® MeterPro
is programmed to perform the analysis after the specimen has reacted with the reagents in the
Test Device. The analysis is based on the amount of fluorescence the Quidel Triage®
MeterPro detects within a measurement zone on the Test Device. The positive or negative
results are displayed on the Quidel Triage® MeterPro screen at a specified time after the
addition of specimen. All results are stored in the Quidel Triage MeterPro memory to
display or print when needed. If connected, the Quidel Triage® MeterPro can transmit results
to the laboratory or hospital information system.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Each analyte for the precision study was tested at the following concentrations, as
percentages of the cutoffs: A negative control, drug free, 25%, 50%, 75%, cutoff,
125%, 150%, 175%, and 200%. The panels were blinded and randomized prior to
testing. Testing was performed at three representative point of care (POC) sites using
three device lots and 45 meters. Three operators conducted the testing at each POC
site. Each operator was assigned one test device lot and five Triage MeterPro
instruments to conduct the testing. Each operator tested ten samples each day of
testing. The ten samples were run in duplicate two times per day for twenty days at
each clinical site. Each device was read on one Triage MeterPro. There were
approximately 720 results (N=4x20x9) per sample. The test results were interpreted
as positive (POS) or negative (NEG) for each individual assay based on the assay
specific cut-off concentration values. The results of the testing are summarized as
follow for the test device.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. These devices are intended for qualitative use only.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quidel Triage TOX Drug Screen, 94600
Cold Storage Stability
A shelf-life stability study of the test was performed and the results showed that
devices are stable for 3 months when stored in cold storage (2°C to 8°C). Real time
stability studies are ongoing and shelf life will be extended based upon data meeting
the acceptance criteria.
Room Temperature Stability
A shelf-life stability study of the test was performed and the results showed that
devices are stable for 14 days when stored at room temperature (20°C to 24°C).
Room temperature stability studies are ongoing and shelf life will be extended based
upon data meeting the acceptance criteria.
Patient Sample Handling Stability
A patient sample handling stability study of the test was performed and patient
sample results were found to be stable when used within 36 hours of sample
collection at room temperature (20°C to 24°C) and within four days when stored
refrigerated (2°C to 8°C). No more than a single freeze/thaw cycle is recommended.
d. Detection limit:
See assay cutoff characterization data in Section M.1.a, above, and M.1.f., below, for
device performance around the claimed cutoff concentrations.
e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical Specificity
To test cross-reactivity, drug metabolites and other compounds that may be present in
human urine samples were tested using nine lots of Quidel Triage TOX Drug Screen,
94600 Test Devices. The following is a summary of the cross-reactivity study. The
individual assays are calibrated against the compounds marked with an asterisk (*).

Specific gravity and pH
The effect of specific gravity for each analyte was evaluated by testing positive and
negative samples at specific gravities ranging from 1.003 to 1.030 g/mL. No
interference was observed for all specific gravities tested.
The effect of pH for each analyte was evaluated by testing positive and negative
samples over a range of pH levels of 4.0 to 9.0. Within the pH range of 4.0 to 9.0
acceptable results were observed with the samples tested. However, a low level of
interference was noted with the TCA assay as the pH increased which could impact
results which are above the threshold of 1,000 ng/mL. Specimens tested outside of
the validated pH range of 4.0 to 9.0 may yield inaccurate results.
The sponsor has included the following statement under ‘Warnings and Precautions’
section of the labeling:
“The Quidel Triage TOX Drug Screen, 94600 has been validated with specimens that
have a pH range of 4.0 – 9.0 acceptable results were observed with the samples
tested. However, a low level of interference was noted with the TCA assay as the pH
increased which could impact results which are above the threshold of 1,000 ng/mL.
Specimens tested outside of the validated pH range may yield inaccurate results.”
Operating Temperature
The effect of operating temperature for each analyte was evaluated by testing positive
and negative samples at temperatures ranging from 16°C to 30°C (61°F to 86°F).
Based on the study results, the Quidel Triage TOX Drug Screen, 94600 is validated
for an operating temperature range from 18°C to 28°C (64°F to 82°F).
Operating Humidity
The effect of operating humidity for each analyte was evaluated by testing positive
and negative samples at relative humidities (R.H.) ranging from ≤ 10 %R.H. to 85
%RH. The Quidel Triage TOX Drug Screen, 94600 is validated for an operating
relative humidity (R.H.) range from 10 %R.H. to 85 %R.H. for all analyte assays.
The sponsor has included the following statement in the devicelabeling under the
‘Warnings and Precautions’ section:
“Optimal results will be achieved by performing testing at temperatures between
18°C to 28°C (64°F to 82°F) and between a relative humidity (RH) range of 10 %RH
to 85 %RH. Specimens tested outside of the validated temperature range may yield
inaccurate results particularly for the cocaine, methamphetamines and opiates
assays.”
f. Assay cut-off:
Each analyte for the cutoff characterization study was tested at the following
concentrations: 0, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, +125%, +150%, +175% and +200% of the
specific cutoff for each drug assay. Testing was performed using 3 lots of Quidel
Triage TOX Drug Screen, 94600 Test Devices and was performed by 3 operators
24

--- Page 25 ---
over four days. Each test sample was run on 105 test devices per device lot for a total
of 315 results per sample. For each test device lot, 40 unique meters were used to
complete all test measurements. Combined results from three test device lots for each
drug test is summarized below.

a These two patient specimens were read negative despite a near threshold positive
results by the reference method.
b
These two patient specimens were read negative despite a high positive result. The
Quidel Triage TOX Drug Screen, 94600 has 100.0% cross reactivity to the d
amphetamine isomer and 16.7% cross reactivity to the l amphetamine isomer,
resulting in negative screening results even with amphetamine levels above t‐he cutoff
concentration of 500 ng/mL by the ref‐erence method. A‐ specimen with high levels of
the l amphetamine isomer may be associated with prescription use of medications
containing amphetamines or compounds that metabolize to amphetamines. A
summ‐ ary of the results for the patient specimens containing both isomers is presented
in the table below. After adjudication, Specimen ID 570964 would be classified as
“near threshold” negative and would not be classified as a discordant result.
Specimen ID 572667 would be classified as a “near threshold” positive patient
specimen (within 10.8% of the assay threshold).

c Patient specimens with Specimen IDs 578510, 579777, 579705, 579727, and
579806 were found to be positive despite a near threshold negative result.
d Patient specimens with Specimen IDs 586313, 586723, 579791, 586280 and 586293
were found to be negative despite a near threshold positive result.

586300, and 579757 were found to be negative despite a high positive result. The
specimens contained both the d-methamphetamine and l-methamphetamine isomers.
The initial LC-MS/MS reference method was unable to distinguish between the two
enantiomeric forms. The Quidel Triage TOX Drug Screen, 94600 has 100.0% cross-
reactivity to the d-methamphetamine isomer and 0.0% cross-reactivity to the l-
methamphetamine isomer, resulting in negative screening results even with
methamphetamine levels above the cutoff concentration of 500 ng/mL. A specimen
with high levels of the l-methamphetamine isomer may be associated with
prescription use of medications that contain methamphetamine or compounds that
metabolize into methamphetamines. A summary of the results for the patient
specimens containing both isomers is presented in the table below. After adjudication,
Specimen IDs 586282, 586275 and 586300 were found to be negative despite a near
threshold positive result (all within 8.6% of the assay threshold).
