chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of single or multiple drugs
and drug metabolites in urine at the following cut-off concentrations: Amphetamine
500ng/mL, Secobarbital 300ng/mL, Benzodiazepines 300ng/mL, Buprenorphine
10ng/mL, Cocaine 150ng/mL, Marijuana 50ng/mL, Methadone 300ng/mL,
Methamphetamine 500ng/mL, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine 500ng/mL, Morphine
300ng/mL and 2,000ng/mL, Phencyclidine 25ng/mL, Nortriptyline 1,000ng/mL,
Oxycodone 100ng/mL, and 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine

This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate
chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.
Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse
test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.
For Prescription use.

L. Test Principle:
The candidate devices are rapid lateral flow immunoassays in which drug-protein
conjugates in the test device compete with drugs or drug metabolites that may be present in
urine.
On each test strip, a drug-protein conjugate is added to the test band of the membrane
known as the test region (T), and the anti-drug antibody-colloidal gold conjugate pads are
placed at the forward end of the membrane. If target drugs are present in the urine specimen

below its cut-off concentration, the solution of the colored antibody-colloidal gold
conjugates moves along with the sample solution by capillary action across the membrane to
the immobilized drug-protein conjugate zone on the test band region. The colored antibody-
gold conjugates then complexes with the drug-protein conjugates to form visible lines.
Therefore, the formation of the visible precipitant in the test band indicates a negative result.
Unbound target drug in urine competes with drug protein conjugates on the test band region
for the limited antibody on the colored drug antibody-colloidal gold conjugate pad. If target
drug is present in excess of the cutoff, the drug will saturate the limited antibody binding
sites and the colored antibody-colloidal gold conjugate cannot bind to the drug-protein
conjugate at the test region of the test strip. Therefore, absence of the color band on the test
region indicates a preliminary positive result. A band should form in the control region (C)
of the devices regardless of the presence of drug in the sample to indicate that the test has
been performed properly.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision/reproducibility study was performed using 3 lots per device format (cup
and panel) five replicates per day for five consecutive days by 3 Point of care (POC)
personnel, at 3 POC sites. Blinded, drug-free urine and commercial GC/MS
confirmed spiked urine samples at the following concentrations were used: -100%,
-75%, -50%, -25%, cutoff, +25%, +50% and +100% of the cutoff level.
Precision performance of the different trade name devices within a format (i.e.
within the cup format or within the panel and dipstick formats) is the same (since
these different trade name devices differ only by intended user, the presence absence
of adulteration strips, or the presence of the plastic housing (in the case of the panel
vs. dipstick formats)). Therefore, in the precision studies conducted by the sponsor,
the Single and Multi-Drug Rapid Test Panel (Urine) results were found to support
performance of the all test panel devices and dipstick devices, and the Single and
Multi-Drug Rapid Test Cup (Urine) results are intended to support performance of
the all cup devices.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The devices have internal process controls. A control line appears in the control
region confirming that sufficient sample volume has been applied to the test strip
and that the sample has migrated correctly on the test strip. Users are informed that
the test is invalid if the colored line does not appear in the control region. There are
no external controls supplied with the devices.
Accelerated testing demonstrated 36 months shelf-life at room temperature. Real
time stability is on-going. Protocol and acceptance criteria were found to be

acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
See precision data in Section M.1.a., above, for assay performance around the
claimed cutoff concentrations.
e. Analytical specificity:
The analytical specificity performance of the different trade name devices within a
format (i.e. within the cup format or within the panel and dipstick formats) is the
same (since these different trade name devices differ only by intended user, the
presence absence of adulteration strips, or the presence of the plastic housing (in the
case of the panel vs. dipstick formats)). Therefore, in the cross-reactivity,
interference and endogenous interferent studies conducted by the sponsor, the Single
and Multi-Drug Rapid Test Panel (Urine) results were found to support performance
of the all test panel devices and dipstick devices, and the Single and Multi-Drug
Rapid Test Cup (Urine) results are intended to support performance of the all cup
devices.
Cross-reactivity:
Cross-reactivity was evaluated by spiking various concentration of similarly
structured drug compounds into drug-free urine, using 3 lots of each device
format (cup and panel). Results are expressed as the lowest concentration producing
a positive result (ng/ml).
The cup and panel configurations demonstrate comparable performance. The results
of one test configuration (Multi-Drug Rapid Test Cup) are presented in the table
below.

Interference:
Interference was evaluated by spiking the potential interferents below into urine
samples having test drug analytes at 25% below and 25% above the cutoff levels for
each assay, using 3 lots of each device format (cup and panel). All potential
interferents were tested at a concentration of 100 µg/mL, except for ethanol which
was tested at a final concentration of 1%.

Endogenous Interferents:
The effect of pH was evaluated by preparing samples with test drug analytes at
+/-25% of the cutoff for all devices and adjusting the pH to 2.00 to 9.00, in
increments of 1 pH unit. There were no interferences observed.
The effect of specific gravity was evaluated by preparing samples with test drug
analytes at +/-25% of the cutoff for all devices and adjusting the specific gravity to
1.001, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025, and 1.030. There were no interferences observed.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration appears in the precision section M.1.a., above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed at the manufacturer’s site using three
operators for each device format (cup and panel). Operators tested a minimum of 40
unaltered positive and 40 unaltered negative clinical samples for each drug. The
samples were blind labeled and compared to GC/MS results.
Accuracy performance of the different trade name devices within a format (i.e.
within the cup format or within the panel and dipstick formats) is the same (since
these different trade name devices differ only by intended user, the presence absence
of adulteration strips, or the presence of the plastic housing (in the case of the panel
vs. dipstick formats)). Therefore, in the method comparison study conducted by the

A lay user study using the cup format of the device was performed by 245 lay
persons at three intended user sites. An additional lay user study using the panel
format of the device was performed by 65 lay persons at three intended user sites.
The lay users were recruited to ensure a representative and demographically diverse
population. Urine samples were prepared with test drug analytes at the following
concentrations; -100%, -50%, -25%, +25%, +50% and +100% of the cutoff by
spiking drug(s) into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the
samples were confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into an individual
blind-labeled container. Each lay-user was provided with a package insert in English
only, one blind-labeled sample for cup format testing and two blind-labeled samples
for panel format testing.

Lay-users were also given surveys on the ease of understanding the package insert
instructions. All lay users indicated that the device instructions can be easily
followed. A Flesch-Kincaid reading analysis was performed on each package insert
and the scores revealed a reading Grade Level of 7.9-8.0.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Not applicable.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable.
