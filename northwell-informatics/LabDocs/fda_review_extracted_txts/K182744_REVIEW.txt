I. Device Description:
HemoTrol WB is an assayed hemoglobin quality control material intended for professional
use in the verification of the precision and accuracy of the HemoCue 301 and HemoCue 801
systems. HemoTrol WB contains bovine red blood cells with hemoglobin lysates in MetHb
and additional stabilizers. For daily quality control, three physiologically relevant levels are
available.
HemoTrol WB solutions are filled in reclosable plastic primary containers. Each bottle
contains 1.1 g of HemoTrol WB solution. The primary containers are equipped with colored
polypropylene caps. Cap color depends on the concentration of hemoglobin (Low: red cap;
Normal: white cap; High: blue cap). Two bottles of the same level are placed in a plastic
blister and packed in a product box together with the combined instructions for use (IFU) and
value sheet. Both the primary containers and product box are labeled.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability- Shelf Life
Shelf life stability at 2–8˚C was assessed using control materials of three hemoglobin
levels. Three lots of each hemoglobin level were tested with 3–6 replicates per lot per
time point. Eight time points between 0 to 127 days were tested on both analyzers -
HemoCue Hb 301 System and HemoCue Hb 801 System. Shipping conditions with
temperature ranges of either 22–30˚C or -10–3˚C were applied on Day 7–14. The
study data supported the recommended stability claim of 108 days at 2–8˚C.
In-use stability
In-use stability at 2–8˚C was assessed using control materials of three hemoglobin
levels. Five time points (0, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days) were tested on both analyzers -
HemoCue Hb 301 System and HemoCue Hb 801 System. Each hemoglobin level was
tested with 2–4 replicates per lot per time point. The study data supported the
recommended stability claim of 31 days at 2–8˚C.

Value Assignment
Value assignment is performed for each new lot of HemoTrol WB. Three samples of
control materials were evaluated on three HemoCue Hb 801 Systems, with three lots
of microcuvettes. Each sample is measured once per microcuvette lot per analyzer,
providing 27 replicates. If the 27 measurements are within the acceptance criteria (4%
for Normal and 7% for Low and High), a value range is assigned to the lot as the
mean value of these 27 measurements with ±4% for Normal and ±7% for Low and
High.
