findings. EliA RF IgM uses the EliA IgM method on the instrument Phadia 2500/5000.
2. Indication for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement:
Prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use on the Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000 instruments
I. Device Description:
EliA uses a modular reagent system. The assay-specific, method-specific and general reagents
are packaged and purchased as separate units. The reagents on Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000
are identical; they are only filled in different containers.
(1) EliA Assay-specific reagent:
· EliA RF IgM Wells are coated with aggregated rabbit IgG – four carriers (12 wells
each), ready to use;
(2) EliA Method-specific reagents:
· EliA IgM Conjugate 50 or 200: β-Galactosidase labeled anti-IgM (mouse monoclonal
antibodies) in PBS containing BSA and 0.06% (w/v) sodium azide in six wedge-shaped
bottles, 5 mL each, ready to use; or six wedge shaped bottles, 19 mL each, ready to use
· EliA IgM Calibrator Strips: Human IgM (0, 10, 35, 80, 500, 1000 µg/L) in PBS

--- Page 3 ---
containing BSA, detergent and 0.095% (w/v) sodium azide – five strips, six single- use
vials per strip, 0.3 mL each, ready to use;
· EliA IgM Curve Control Strips: Human IgM (80 µg/L) in PBS containing BSA, detergent
and 0.095% (w/v) sodium azide – five strips, six single-use vials per strip, 0.3 mL each,
ready to use;
· EliA IgM Calibrator Well: Coated with mouse monoclonal antibodies – four carriers (12
wells each), ready to use.
· EliA Sample Diluent: PBS containing BSA, detergent and 0.095% (w/v) sodium azide
– six bottles, 48 mL each, ready to use; or six bottles, 400 mL each, ready to use;
(3) EliA General reagents:
· Development Solution (0.01 %4-Methylumbelliferyl-β-D-galacto-side, <0.0010%
preservative), ready for use;
· Stop Solution (4% Sodium Carbonate), ready for use;
· Dilution Wells (high density polyethylene wells), 50 carriers, ready to use;
· Pipette Tips in Racks (polyethylene tips), 24 racks × 160 tips, ready for use;
· Washing Solution (information in separate Washing Solution package insert)
Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000 are identical instruments except for sample throughput. Phadia
2500 consists of one process module (two process lines), whereas Phadia 5000 consists of two
process modules (2 x 2 process lines). Instrument operation is handled by onboard Instrument
Software (ISW). Data output is administered by Information Data Manager (IDM). All steps of
an assay are performed within a single process line. Thus, study protocols used for Phadia 2500
are also valid for Phadia 5000.

L. Test Principle:
EliA tests are fluorescence immunoassays for the detection and measurement of human
antibodies based on EliA solid-phase components, which contain specific antigens for the
antibodies to be measured.

The EliA wells are coated with aggregated rabbit IgG antigen. If present in the patient's
specimen, antibodies (RF) to these proteins bind to the specific antigen. After washing away
non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgM antibodies (EliA IgM
Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound
conjugate is washed away, and the bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution.
After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The assay
directly measures the amount of antibody of interest bound to the antigen coating the EliA
well, therefore the higher the value of fluorescent signal detected by the instrument, the higher
the amount of antibody bound and detected in the sample tested. To evaluate test results, the
response for patient samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
All results presented below met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria
for all analytical performance studies.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To determine the precision of the assay, the variability was assessed in a study with a
total of 21 runs (three instruments total and seven runs per instrument). The study was
performed with a single run/day over a period of seven days. Each sample was tested
in four replicates/run giving in total 84 replicates per sample (3 instruments × 7 runs x
4 replicates = 84). The data were calculated against the calibration curve from Day 1.
Five native patient serum samples were tested: one negative, one in the equivocal
range, and three positive specimens. All samples were tested on all instruments. The
results are summarized in the tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Four patient serum samples were diluted in EliA Sample Diluent and tested in
triplicate with one lot of EliA RF IgM and one set of system reagents on Phadia
2500/5000. The results of the dilutions were compared with their expected values.
The ratio observed/expected (O/E) was calculated. Mean observed value was used in
the calculation. The results of the regression analysis are summarized in the tables
below:

(0.99–1.03) (−0.27–0.75)
The reportable range (Limit of Detection, upper limit) for EliA RF IgM is from 0.6 to
200 EliA U/mL. The measuring range (Limit of Quantitation, upper limit) is from
1.0 to 200 EliA U/mL.
The following statements are included in the package inserts: “Please note that
concentration values between LoD and LoQ may show a higher uncertainty.” and
“Please note that due to differing binding characteristics of the antibodies in patient
samples, not all sera can be diluted linearly within the measuring range.”
The hook effect was previously reviewed in K102673
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Same as in the predicate devices. Refer to K102673.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) studies were performed on a
Phadia 2500 instrument. LoB was measured in two assay runs with each run including
a blank sample in 33 replicates, giving a total of 66 replicates. LoD was measured in

two assay runs by testing three low level serum samples in 11 replicates per sample in
a run, giving a total of 66 replicates. The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was based on 66
determinations and a precision target of 20%. The results are summarized in the table
below:

e. Analytical specificity:
i) Interference:
Interference by endogenous substances was previously reviewed in K102673.
ii) Carry-over:
The Phadia 2500/5000 instruments use disposable tips for pipetting samples and a
separate pipette for the conjugate, therefore carry-over from samples to conjugate
was not evaluated.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-offs are the same as in the predicate devices and are summarized in the
tables below:
< 3.5 EliA U/mL Negative
3.5–5.0 EliA U/mL Equivocal
> 5.0 EliA U/mL Positive

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
See 2c. Instrument Comparison below.
b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison between serum and plasma was reviewed in K102673.
c. Instrument comparison:
The purpose of this study was to evaluate conformance and show comparability of
EliA RF IgM on the Phadia 250 instrument versus the Phadia 2500/5000 instrument.
A total of 105 samples (77 positive, 18 negative, and 10 equivocal samples) were
run in singlicate on one Phadia 250 and three Phadia 2500/5000 instruments for

No sample switched from negative to positive or vice versa. Five samples in the
negative range were tested equivocal. Two samples in the equivocal range were tested
positive and one sample in the positive range were tested equivocal.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and specificity:
Clinical performance values were reviewed in K102673.
b. Other clinical supportive data (when. a is not applicable):
Not Applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Same as assay cut-off
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The frequency distribution for RF IgM antibodies was investigated in a group of
apparently healthy subjects (N=400) equally distributed by age and gender, using sera
from a Caucasian population obtained from a blood bank. Five samples were within
the equivocal and nine samples were within the positive range. The results are given
in the table below all measurements are shown in EliA U/mL:
95th 99th
Test Mean Median Range

Percentile Percentile
EliA RF IgM on
400 0.9 <1.0* 0.0–47.0 2.9 19.2
Phadia 2500/5000
*Any test result lower than LoQ was indicated <1.0 EliA U/mL.
N. Proposed Labelling:
The labelling is sufficient, and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
