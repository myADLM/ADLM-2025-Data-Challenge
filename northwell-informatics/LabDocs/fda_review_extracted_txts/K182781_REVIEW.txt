H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The PTS Professional Chemistry Kit is a medical device convenience kit that
quantitatively measures the percent of glycated hemoglobin (%Alc), total cholesterol,
high density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, and glucose in capillary (fingerstick) or
venous whole blood.
• Cholesterol measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatments of disorders
involving excess cholesterol in the blood and lipid and lipoprotein metabolism
disorders.
• HDL (lipoprotein) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of lipid
disorders (such as diabetes mellitus), atherosclerosis, and various liver and renal
diseases.
• Triglycerides measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with
diabetes mellitus, nephrosis, liver obstruction, other diseases involving lipid
metabolism or various endocrine disorders.
• Glucose measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of carbohydrate
metabolism disorders including diabetes mellitus, neonatal hypoglycemia, and
idiopathic hypoglycemia, and of pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.
• The HbA1C test provides quantitative measurement of the percent of glycated
hemoglobin levels. The test is for professional use to monitor glycemic control in
people with diabetes.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
For in vitro diagnostic use only.
The Glucose and HbA1c test systems in this kit are not intended for use in screening for
diabetes.

4. Special instrument requirements:
This convenience kit may include up to three different analyzers, the Cardiochek PA, the
Cardiochek Plus and the A1cNow analyzer. Users should follow the instructions on each
test strip package insert to determine which analyzer is appropriate for use with that strip.
I. Device Description:
The PTS Professional Chemistry Kit combines the previously cleared test systems listed
below:
The CardioChek® PA test system that consists of the CardioChek® PA Analyzer and certain
PTS Panels® Test Strips.
The CardioChek® Plus test system that consists of the CardioChek® Plus Analyzer and
certain PTS Panels® Test Strips.
The PTS Panels® Test Strips consist of varying amounts of test strips packed into a vial and
a lot-specific MEMo® Chip. The PTS Panels® Test Strips for use with this kit include:
PTS Panels® Lipid Panel Test Strips, PTS Panels® Chol+HDL+Glu Test Strips, PTS
Panels® Chol+HDL Test Strips, PTS Panels® Chol+Glu Test Strips, PTS Panels® eGlu Test
Strips and PTS Panel® Glucose Test Strips. The PTS Panels® Test Strips are single-use.
PTS Panels® Controls contain two vials of control solution that have two levels of each
analyte. Controls included in this kit are the PTS Panels® HDL Cholesterol Controls and
PTS Panels® Multi-Chemistry Controls.
The PTS Collect™ Capillary Tubes are a glass and plastic tube capable of dispensing an
exact volume of blood from the capillary tube to a test strip.
A1CNow®+ consists of three components: a semi-disposable plastic-encased device (the
analyzer), a plastic cartridge enclosing dry reagent strips, and a shaker kit.
The Unistik® 3 Pre-set Single Use Safety Lancets are sterile, single-use, auto-disabling
lancets to perform finger sticks to obtain capillary blood.
The PTS Connect™ Dock and PTS Connect® ProLink are included to transfer data from the
CardioChek® Plus Analyzer, CardioChek® PA Analyzer, and the A1CNow®+ to computer
systems. The CardioChek® Printer interfaces with the CardioChek® Plus and CardioChek®
PA Analyzer to print results onto paper and self-adhesive labels.
The PTS Professional Chemistry Kit contents are customizable according to user needs.
Individual kits may not contain all of the devices described in this submission.

L. Test Principle:
PTS Panels® Test Strips include reflectance and electrochemical test strips. The reflectance
assays include quantitative determination of glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and
triglycerides. The test strips utilize enzymatic methods on a dry strip that is read by
reflectance photometry. A single application of whole blood flows laterally to dose each set
of analyte specific membranes once the blood is applied to the test strip. The red blood cells
are separated by the test strip such that only the serum or plasma reaches the reaction
membranes. The color resulting from the enzymatic reaction is read by the analyzers by
reflectance. The reflectance is compared to the calibration curve stored in the memory chip

and converted into concentration and displayed by the analyzer.
PTS Panels eGLU glucose test strips use electrochemical (amperometric) technology to
produce a glucose result. When the blood is applied to the test strip, the blood starts a
chemical reaction that produces an electrical current. The current is converted into a glucose
result and is displayed on the analyzer screen.
The A1CNow+ analyzer utilizes both immunoassay and chemistry technology to measure
A1C and total hemoglobin, respectively. Upon the addition of a diluted blood sample, blue
microparticles conjugated to anti-A1C antibodies migrate along the reagent strips. The
amount of blue microparticles captured on the strips reflects the amount of A1C in the
sample. For the total hemoglobin (Hb) portion of the test, the sample diluent converts Hb to
met-Hb. The intensity of met-Hb color measured on the reagent strips is proportional to the
concentration of hemoglobin in the sample. Test results are expressed as % A1C (A1C ÷ total
Hb x 100).
