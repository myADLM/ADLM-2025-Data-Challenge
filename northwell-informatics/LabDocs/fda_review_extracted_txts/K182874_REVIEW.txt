H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Refer to indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Fenom Pro™ Nitric Oxide Test is a portable, non-invasive device to measure fractional
exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in human breath. FeNO is increased in some airway
inflammatory processes, such as asthma, and often decreases in response to anti-
inflammatory treatment. Measurement of FeNO by Fenom Pro™ is a method to measure
the decrease in FeNO concentration in asthma patients that often occurs after treatment
with anti-inflammatory pharmacological therapy as an indication of therapeutic effect in
patients with elevated FeNO levels. FeNO measurements are to be used as an adjunct to
established clinical assessments. Fenom Pro™ is suitable for children, approximately 7-
17 years, and adults 18 years and older.
Testing using the Fenom Pro™ should only be done in a point-of-care healthcare setting
under professional supervision. Fenom Pro™ should not be used in critical care,
emergency care or in anesthesiology.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Fenom Pro™ may not be used by children under the age of approximately 7 years,
including infants, as measurement requires patient cooperation. Fenom Pro™ may not be
used by children under the age of 7 years, or by patients who are unable to understand
and execute the instructions given by healthcare providers, as measurement requires
patient cooperation.
Fenom Pro™ should not be used in critical care, emergency care, or in anesthesiology.
All subjects should refrain from eating or drinking for at least 60 minutes before the
FENOM test. Recent intake of nitrate rich food, such as lettuce, spinach, beets, walnuts,
peanuts, and animal organs, can lead to increased FeNO levels .
Smoking reduces exhaled NO levels. Fenom Pro™ results obtained from subjects who
smoke should only be considered after considering the subject's smoking history and the
potential impact on NO levels.
For prescription use only.

I. Device Description:
The Fenom ProTM Nitric Oxide Test (also referred to in short as Fenom ProTM) is a portable
system for the non‐invasive, quantitative measurement of the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide
(NO) in expired human breath (FeNO).
The Fenom ProTM Nitric Oxide Test is comprised of four major components (touch screen,
handpiece, mouthpiece, breath conditioning cartridge). The main unit contains a touch screen
interface for the use as well as houses the nitric oxide sensor and pneumatics needed to
sample the patient’s breath. The patient interfaces with Fenom though the mouthpiece which
is attached to the handpiece. The handpiece is connected to the main unit via a breath tube.
The handpiece contains a breath conditioning cartridge which prepares the breath sample
from the patient for proper analysis in the main unit. Both the mouthpiece and the breath
conditioning cartridge are consumables.
The mouthpiece is a single patient use, disposable component that contains an anti-
bacterial/anti-viral filter. The mouthpiece has an ergonomically designed oval interface to the
patient to aid in creating a proper seal during the breath maneuver.
The breath conditioning cartridge is designed to remove humidity from breath samples. It is
intended to be used 20 times before being disposed. It contains desiccant beads conditioned
to a low dew point to ensure proper sample conditioning over the useful life of the cartridge.
The device keeps track of the number of uses on the cartridge as well as independently
measures the humidity of the breath sample after the cartridge to verify the gas sample
humidity is within the device requirement for proper FeNO analysis.

L. Test Principle:
Fenom ProTM Nitric Oxide Test uses solid-state electrochemical sensor technology sensitive
to nitric oxide (NO) compounds. The solid state sensor is preceded by a reactive filter
material that renders (oxidizes) potentially confounding species such as carbon monoxide
(CO), ammonia (NH4), and methanol (CH4O) inactive, or inert, to the NO sensor. Fenom
ProTM provides visual and audible feedback during its use. A user performs a breath
maneuver by exhaling into Fenom ProTM Nitric Oxide Test, and the Fenom ProTM Nitric
Oxide Test graphical user interface (GUI) displays an indication of the user’s breath flow
rate, such that the user can modulate their breath flow rate to be within the acceptable limits.
An electrochemical potential difference between the electrodes of the sensor develops and is
proportional to the amount of NO in the gas sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Nitric oxide was mixed in a balance gas to simulate breath samples. Samples NO
concentrations were determined using a chemiluminescence device calibrated against
a NIST traceable NO tank. Fenom ProTM Nitric Oxide Test results were collected by
multiple operators over 5 operating days, 2 sessions per day, 4 runs per session with
two replicates for each concentration, across five different devices using the

A multi-center, single visit, point-of care, inter-operator variability study was
conducted to determine the repeatability of FeNO measured with the Fenom ProTM
Nitric Oxide Test. 3 different operators at each site instructed each subject to perform
two valid Fenom ProTM Nitric Oxide Test measurements. FeNO levels in this study
were assessed for a total of 127 subjects at 4 different sites by a total of 12 operators.

Device 2 1.02 0.231 0.999
Effects of extreme temperature, relative humidity.
The effects of temperature, relative humidity (RH) were assessed using the following
conditions: 15°C/20% RH, 15°C/80% RH, 30°C/20% RH, 30°C/80% RH, and
ambient conditions at 22°C/37% RH. For each sample, nitric oxide was mixed in a
balance gas of simulated breath and the concentration of NO was determined using a
NO Gas Analyzer. Each concentration sample was measured using 2 Fenom ProTM
devices, with each concentration tested in five replicates per device per test condition.
The results support the claimed operating conditions for the Fenom ProTM Nitric
Oxide Test: 15°C-30°C, 20-80% RH .
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Fenom ProTM Nitric Oxide Test is manufacturer calibrated and does not require
calibration by the user.
The device is pre-programmed to allow a defined number of tests for the nitric oxide
sensor. Stability study results were provided to support the sensor life of 250 tests or
50 hours of use, whichever comes first. Replacement of the sensor is done by the
manufacturer.
The breath conditioning cartridge is a replacement part of the device. Stability study
results were provided to support the claimed cartridge shelf life of 3 months. Once
installed, each cartridge is pre-programmed to allow a defined number of tests (12
hours of use or 20 uses, whichever comes first).
The shelf-life for the mouthpiece is 24 months. The mouthpiece is a single patient
use, disposable component that contains an anti-bacterial/anti-viral filter.

d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection for the Fenom ProTM Nitric Oxide Test was determined based
on CLSI EP17-A2. Two devices were tested at 0 ppb (60 replicates), 5 ppb (30
replicates) and 10 ppb (30 replicates) over three days. Nitric oxide samples were
mixed in a balance gas of simulated breath. The limit of detection was calculated
using the parametric option in CLSI EP17-A2, using the following formulas:
LoB=μ +1.645 σ and LoD=LoB+1.645 σ . The results of the limit of detection
B B S
analysis support the claimed detection limit of 10 ppb.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous substance interference
Interference testing was performed using simulated breath having 15, 30, and 50 ppb
NO. Five sensors were used to evaluate endogenous interference. The substances and
concentrations tested are summarized in the table below. A substance was defined as

The relationship between the percent change in FeNO and the percent change in pre-
and post-bronchodilator FEV1 from visit 1 to visit 2 was investigated. The magnitude
of the FeNO change and degree of improvements in ACQ and FEV1 are different
because the scale and precision of these metrics varies. The data presented in the table
below indicate that FEV1 and symptom score (ACQ) are different metrics and are not
directly correlated with FeNO as determined by Fenom ProTM Nitric Oxide Test.

Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected values are provided from the literature. In the labeling the sponsor states,
“Given that physiological and environmental factors can affect FeNOlevels, in clinical
practice, ‘healthy’ FeNOlevels need to be established on an individual basis. However,
most healthy individuals will have NO levels in the range 5-35 ppb (children slightly
lower 5-25 ppb) when measured at 50 mL/s. (ATS/ERS Recommendations for
Standardized Procedures for the Online and Offline Measurement of Exhaled Lower
Respiratory Nitric Oxide and Nasal Nitric Oxide, 2005. Am J Respir Crit Care Med.

N. Instrument Name:
Fenom ProTM Nitric Oxide Test
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
A user will perform a breath maneuver by exhaling into Fenom ProTM Nitric Oxide Test,
and the Fenom ProTM Nitric Oxide Test graphical user interface (GUI) will display an
incentive or indication of the user’s breath flow rate, such that the user can modulate their
breath flow rate to be within the acceptable limits recommended by the ATS and ERS
guidelines.
The Fenom ProTM Nitric Oxide Test device evaluates the breath maneuver and
determines if the breath maneuver was performed according to the ATS and ERS
guidelines with regards to breath flow rate and duration. The breath sample is presented
through the reactive filter that transforms interferent species into inert species for the
sensor and then fluidly presents the gas sample to the sensor. An electrochemical
potential difference between the electrodes of the sensor develops and is proportional to
the amount of NO in the gas sample.
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes ________ or No ___x_____
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ________ or No ___x_____
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____x____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
The patient performs the test in real-time and is identified by patient name.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The user obtains a breath sample by having the subject exhale into the device.

--- Page 14 ---
5. Calibration:
The manufacturer performs calibration for each Fenom ProTM Nitric Oxide Test device.
No calibration is required by the operator.
6. Quality Control:
Fenom ProTM Nitric Oxide Test provides internal controls as well as an External Quality
Control program for the user to verify the reliability of measurements.
The External Quality Control (QC) program consists of two parts: One positive control
from a qualified staff member with a stable FeNO value providing a normal biological
FeNO sample and a negative control consisting of a NO free gas sample which is
generated by the device from ambient air.
The labeling states that QC Users must be over 18 years of age, non-smoker, no known
airway diseases or chronic cold, preferably no allergies or asthma, and stable FeNO
values between 10-40 ppb. The device has built in QC rules and the user will see the
Passed or Failed instructions after the daily QC is performed.
The process consists of performing four QC measurements, one per day, within 7 days.
The negative control result must be <10ppb. The positive control result must be with
process control limits for control charts with subgroup size one as defined in
"Understanding Statistical Process Control" by Donald L. Wheeler and David S.
Chambers. The control limits are established as follows: the most recent result (V0) is
compared to a rolling average (AVG) and the prior result (V1). The control limit is a
multiple of the rolling absolute range (RAR), which is the average difference of
successive results. The control limits are:
|V – AVG| < RAR * 2.66, or 5ppb, whichever is greater
0
|V – V | < RAR * 3.268, or 5ppb, whichever is greater
0 1
When the QC has passed both criteria, the device is ready for clinical use. A QC test must
be performed each day of use. If the QC tester does not perform a QC test in 30 days, the
qualification is suspended and the QC tester needs to re-qualify.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Analytical Accuracy
An accuracy study was performed to compare performance of the Fenom ProTM Nitric Oxide
Test device to a chemiluminescence device calibrated against a NIST traceable NO tank.
Four Fenom ProTM Nitric Oxide Test devices were tested over six concentrations (10 ppb, 25
ppb, 75 ppb, 100 ppb, 200 ppb, and 300 ppb) with ten replicates each for a total of 240 tests.
For each concentration, nitric oxide was mixed in a balance gas of simulated breath.

The results of the study are shown below:
Mean Bias (%)
10 ppb 25 ppb 75 ppb 100 ppb 200 ppb 300 ppb
Device 1 -1.1 ppb -2.6 ppb -0.5 1.1 -6.4 -2.5
(-11.0 %) (-10.4%)
Device 2 -0.7 ppb -1.6 ppb -5.4 -2.7 -7.7 -5.0
(-7.0%) (-6.4%)
Device 3 3.2 ppb 3.0 ppb -0.1 -1.5 -4.6 -5.2
(32.0%) (12.0%)
Device 4 -0.9 ppb -1.2 ppb -7.0 -4.6 -7.3 -3.2
(-9.0%) (-4.8%)
Electrical Safety testing
The sponsor provided documentation describing conformity assessment to the relevant
electrical safety standard (IEC 60601-1).
Electromagnetic Compatibility testing
The sponsor provided documentation describing conformity assessment to the relevant EMC
standard IEC 60601-1-2:2014
Biocompatibility testing
Fenom PRO Nitric Oxide Test device will be contacting patient’s gas pathway via air. In
addition, the mouthpiece component will have direct surface contact. The contact duration is
limited (<24 hours). Based on the intended patient contact types and duration, the sponsor
provided demonstrated acceptable cytotoxicity, intracutaneous reactivity, sensitization, and
acute systemic toxicity for the device.
Effects of extreme temperature, relative humidity.
The operating conditions for the device is 15oC-30oC, 20-80% RH. The effects of
temperature, relative humidity (RH) were assessed using the following conditions: 15°C/20%
RH, 15°C/80% RH, 30°C/20% RH, 30°C/80% RH, and ambient conditions at 22°C/37% RH.
For each sample, nitric oxide was mixed in a balance gas of simulated breath and the
concentration of NO was determined using a NO Gas Analyzer. Each concentration sample
was measured using 2 Fenom ProTM devices, with each concentration tested in five replicates
per device per test condition. The readings from the candidate device meet the acceptance
criteria of within +/-5 ppb at 15 ppb, and +/-10% at 75 and 200ppb. The results support the
recommended operating conditions of 5oC-30oC (59°F to 86 °F), 20-80% RH.
Effects of altitude
The sponsor also tested device performance at the following atmospheric pressure range of
106 to 92 kPa, equivalent to -1500 feet to +2500 feet above sea level, and show that the
device performance are not affected. The labeling states the operation condition of the device
is from Sea level to 6500 ft.
