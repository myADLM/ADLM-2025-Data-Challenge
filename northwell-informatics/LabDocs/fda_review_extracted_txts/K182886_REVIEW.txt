510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
K182886
B. Purpose for Submission:
Instrument modification
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Beckman Coulter, Inc.
Cytomics FC500 MCL and MPL Flow Cytometers
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Flow cytometric immunoassays: cell identification with quantitative cell counts
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Cytomics FC500 MCL and MPL Flow Cytometers are instruments for the qualitative
and quantitative measurement of biological and physical properties of cells and other
particles. These properties are measured when the cells pass through one or two laser
beams in single-file. The MCL configuration denotes a carousel-loader unit for sample
tubes; the MPL configuration denotes a plate-loader unit, in addition to sample tubes.
These instruments include a 488nm excitation laser, and an optional 633nm solid-state or
635nm HeNe laser. IVD assays cleared for use on the FC500 cytometers employ the
488nm laser for excitation, no assays that employ the 633/635 lasers have been cleared
by the FDA and clearance of those lasers is not the subject of this 510(k). All
configurations of the FC500 cytometer possess a total of seven detector channels ‒ two
avalanche photodiodes (APD), for forward- and side-scatter; and five photomultiplier
tubes (PMT, FL1‒FL5) for detection of specific fluorescence. Seven amp boards (one for
each detector circuit) amplify and synchronize analog electronic signals from
photodetectors, prior to conversion to digital signals.
The software architecture for the FC500 instrument-controlling workstation includes
CXP for acquisition and analysis of closed-system IVD assays, MXP for more advanced
acquisition and analysis including LDT assays, and BCAP for necessary user and account
permissions controls for review of quarantined files.
This 510(k) submission concerns software update patches (CXP v2.3, MXP v2.3),

enabling detection of delay line failures in the amp board for each detector channel, as
described in RCL181101. As a corrective Change Being Effected (CBE) response, this
software update contains three algorithmic processes as part of a Software Detection Tool
(SDT) for:
1) electronic detection of pre-acquisition signal failures in amp board delay lines
2) mid- or post-acquisition detection of signal failures by automated digital analysis
of parameter-by-time signal for each detection channel
3) predictive quarantine of datafiles suspected of being compromised, due to signal
failure, for operator review prior to release or dismissal
2. Principles of Operation:
The Cytomics FC500 cytometric instrument contains a fluidics system designed to pass
cells or particles through one or more laser beams in succession. Scattered and fluoresced
light from these events is collected by APD and PMT detectors, converted to digital
signal, and collected by the instrument workstation.

(LMD) files retroactively, simulating amp board signal loss through digital,
algorithmic means. For the electronic simulation method, a modified amp board was
engineered to include a switch on the delay line to electronically mimic the signal loss
defect in compromised amp boards For the physical simulation methods, the Sponsor
physically disrupted the fluidic path in the instrument in an intermittent fashion. In
addition, real-world data files were collected from instrument users who experienced
amp board failures in their laboratory or generated from instruments that had known
board failures.
For purposes of testing of the SDT, “positive” results are defined as files flagged by
the SDT as compromised, and “negative” results are defined as files that were not
flagged as compromised by the SDT. Therefore, “false positive” results are
uncompromised files which the SDT flags, and “false negative” results are
compromised files which are not flagged by the SDT.
i. Pre-Acquisition Testing:
To evaluate the ability of the software detection tool to detect pre-acquisition
signal failures, the modified amp board was used to simulate signal loss
conditions on each channel (FL1-5, FSC, SSC) using Tetra, Stem-Kit, and
ClearLLab assays and auto-setup protocols. Out of a total of 247 tests across these
parameters, 247 cases were positively identified by the SDT as comrompised
signal – the positive agreement rate for this value is 100.0% (95% CI: 98.5‒
100.0%).
ii. Post-Acquisition Test Case 1:
In the first set of test cases for post-acquisition performance of the SDT, the LMD
Tool was applied to a set of 42 datafiles (Retrospective Simulations). In addition,
the modified amp board or physically disrupted fluidics were employed (Live
Simulations). Together, these methods generated 2344–2726 test datafiles for
each assay panel. False negative (FNR) and false positive (FPR) rates were
determined for the software detection tool. The FNR evaluates the SDT’s inability
to identify a compromised file, and the FPR evaluates the frequency of falsely
identifying an uncompromised file. The results are presented in the table below:

In order to evaluate the performance of the SDT in non-simulated conditions,
sample listmode datafiles (LMD) were sourced from customers and end-users. A
total of 409 datafiles were collected and categorized into three sets, as described
below – by source and assay panel. These sets of datafiles were used to evaluate
the performance of the SDT in detecting data compromised by actual amp board
failure in laboratories using the affected instruments or prospectively by using a
failed amp board in a single instrument.

The results met the Sponsor’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.
v. Manual Review Reader Study:
The labeling addendum for use of the SDT specified that all data should be
reviewed before release and reporting, irrespective of SDT flagging and
quarantine. Therefore, instructions for manual review included in the labeling
addendum constitute a critical mitigation for the SDT, and therefore a constituent
element of the device.
To address the adequacy of these instructions for manual review, a reader study
was performed. 100 data files from Test Case 1 were selected to represent all IVD
assay areas (i.e. Tetra, StemKit, and ClearLLab), as well as all relevant types of
signal loss and file compromise observed in the recall investigation, specifically
signal loss patterns identified as resulting in false negative results from Test Cases
1 and 2. The datafiles included seven failure pattern-imprinted compromised
LMD for each panel, and three unaltered “normal” files for each panel.
Analyses were provided to three Tier 1 independent reviewers, blinded to each
other and to expected results. To model clinical practice, a second tier of review
was further incorporated; to represent post-acquisition reviewers of higher level
experience. Only discordant results among Tier 1 operators were resolved by Tier
2 review. Data for discordant results for a total of n=30 reads for each panel are
