findings. EliA SmDP uses the EliA IgG method on the instrument Phadia 2500/5000.
2. Indication for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement:
Prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use on the Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000 instruments
I. Device Description:
EliA uses a modular reagent system. The assay-specific, method-specific and general reagents
are packaged and purchased as separate units. The reagents on Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000
are identical; they are only filled in different containers.
(1) EliA Assay-specific reagent:
· EliA SmDP Wells are coated with a synthetic SmD3 peptide – four carriers (12 wells
each), ready to use;
(2) EliA Method-specific reagent:
· EliA IgG Calibrator Strips: Human IgG (0, 4, 10, 20, 100, 600 µg/L) in PBS containing
BSA, detergent and 0.095% (w/v) sodium azide in five strips, six single- use vials per
strip, 0.3 mL each, ready to use;
· EliA IgG Curve Control Strips: Human IgG (20 µg/L) in PBS containing BSA,
detergent and 0.095% (w/v) sodium azide in five strips, six single-use vials per strip,
0.3 mL each, ready to use;
· EliA Sample Diluent: PBS containing BSA, detergent and 0.095% (w/v) sodium azide
in six bottles, 48 mL each, ready to use; or six bottles, 400 mL each, ready to use;

antibodies) in PBS containing BSA and 0.06% (w/v) sodium azide in six wedge-shaped
bottles, 5 mL each, ready to use; or six wedge-shaped bottles, 19 mL each, ready to use;
· EliA IgG Calibrator Well: Coated with mouse monoclonal antibodies in four carriers
(12 wells each), ready to use
(3) EliA General reagents:
· Development Solution (0.01 %4-Methylumbelliferyl-β-D-galacto-side, <0.0010%
preservative), ready for use;
· Stop Solution (4% Sodium Carbonate), ready for use;
· Dilution Wells (high density polyethylene wells), 50 carriers, ready to use;
· Pipette Tips in Racks (polyethylene tips), 24 racks × 160 tips, ready for use;

Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000 are identical instruments except for sample throughput. The
Phadia 2500 consists of one process module (two process lines), whereas Phadia 5000 consists
of two process modules (2 x 2 process lines). Instrument operation is handled by onboard
Instrument Software (ISW). Data output is administered by Information Data Manager (IDM).
All steps of an assay are performed within a single process line. Thus, study protocols used for
Phadia 2500 are also valid for Phadia 5000.

L. Test Principle:
EliA tests are fluorescence immunoassays for the detection and measurement of human
antibodies based on EliA solid-phase components, which contain specific antigens for the
antibodies to be measured.
The EliA wells are coated with a synthetic SmD peptide. If present in the patient's specimen,
3
antibodies to SmD peptide bind to the specific antigen. After washing away non-bound
3
antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgG antibodies (EliA IgG Conjugate)
are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is
washed away, and the bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution. After
stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The higher the
response value, the higher the amount of antibody bound and detected in the sample tested. To
evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is compared directly to the response for
calibrators.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To determine the precision of the assay, the variability was assessed in a study with a
total of 21 runs (three instruments total and seven runs per instrument). The study was
performed with a single run/day over a period of seven days. Each sample was tested
in four replicates/run giving in total 84 replicates per sample (3 instruments × 7 runs x
4 replicates = 84). The data were calculated against the calibration curve from Day 1.
Five native patient serum samples were tested: one negative, two in the equivocal
range, and two positive specimens. All samples were tested on all instruments. The
results are summarized in the tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Four patient serum samples were diluted in EliA Sample Diluent and tested in
triplicate with one lot of EliA SmDP immunoassay and one set of system reagents on
Phadia 2500/5000. The results of the dilutions were compared with their expected
values. The ratio observed/expected (O/E) was calculated. Mean observed value was
used in the calculation. The results of the regression analysis are summarized in the
tables below:

The reportable range (Limit of Detection to upper limit) for EliA SmDP is from 0.8 to
480 EliA U/mL. The measuring range (Limit of Quantitation to upper limit) is from
1.6 to 480 EliA U/mL.
The following statements are included in the package inserts: “Please note that
concentration values between LoD and LoQ may show a higher uncertainty.” and
“Please note that due to differing binding characteristics of the antibodies in patient
samples, not all sera can be diluted linearly within the measuring range.”
The hook effect was previously reviewed in K132631.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Same as in the predicate devices. Refer to K132631.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) studies were performed on a
Phadia 2500 instrument. LoB was measured in six assay runs with each run including
a blank sample in 12 replicates, giving a total of 72 replicates. LoD was measured in
six assay runs by testing five low level serum samples in 12 replicates per sample in a
run, giving a total of 360 replicates. The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was based on 360
determinations and a precision target of 20%. The results are summarized in the table
below:
EliA SmDP Assau (EliA U/mL) LoB LoD LoQ
Phadia 2500/5000 0.3 0.8 1.6
e. Analytical specificity:
i) Interference:
Interference by endogenous substances was previously reviewed in K132631.
ii) Cross-reactivity:
Cross-reactivity was previously reviewed in K132631.
iii) Carry-over:
The Phadia 2500/5000 instruments use disposable tips for pipetting samples and a
separate pipette for the conjugate, therefore carry-over from samples to conjugate
was not evaluated.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:

b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison between serum and plasma was reviewed in K132631.
c. Instrument comparison:
The purpose of this study was to evaluate conformance and show comparability of
EliA SmDP on the Phadia 250 instrument versus the Phadia 2500/5000 instrument.
A total of 105 samples (75 positive, 15 negative and 15 equivocal) were run in
singlicate on one Phadia 250 instrument and three Phadia 2500/5000 instruments for
comparison. Only samples inside the measuring range were included in the
calculations. Results were analyzed by Passing-Bablok regression and summarized

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The frequency distribution for SmDP antibodies was investigated in a group of
apparently healthy subjects (N=400) equally distributed by age and gender, using sera
from a Caucasian population obtained from a blood bank. None of test samples was
within the equivocal or the positive range in the three EliA assays. The test results are
given in the table below and all measurements are shown in EliA U/mL:
95th 99th
Test Mean Median Range
N
Percentile Percentile
EliA SmDP on
400 1.2 1.1 0.0–5.4 2.2 4.2
Phadia 2500/5000
N. Proposed Labelling:
The labelling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
