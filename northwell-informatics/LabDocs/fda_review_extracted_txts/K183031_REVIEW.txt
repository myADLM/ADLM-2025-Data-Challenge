The ETEST consists of a thin, inert, nonporous plastic strip that is used to determine the
antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria. One side of the strip carries the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) reading scale expressed in µg/mL. The other side of the strip contains a
predefined continuous gradient of antibiotic concentrations.
When the strip is applied to an inoculated agar surface, the preformed antibiotic gradient
immediately transfers into the agar matrix, then forming a stable, continuous and exponential
gradient of antibiotic concentrations directly underneath the strip. Bacteria growth becomes
visible during incubation, and a symmetrical inhibition ellipse centered along the strip
appears. After incubation, the MIC value is read from the scale in terms of µg/mL at
complete inhibition of bacterial growth, where the pointed end of the ellipse intersects the
strip. Since ETEST generates MIC values which fall between two-fold dilutions for
interpretation, the MIC value read must be recorded to the next two-fold dilution.
The MIC gradient on ETEST Meropenem/Vaborbactam ranges from 0.004/8 ‒ 64/8 µg/mL.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three external sites using 10 isolates of
Gram negative organisms that were consistent with the intended use. The isolates
tested included E. coli (3), K. pneumoniae (3), C. freundii (1), K. aerogenes (1), E.
cloacae (1), and S. marcescens (1).
Most of the results were within ± 1 doubling dilution of the MIC mode for
Meropenem/Vaborbactam. The reproducibility was acceptable at 99.6%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Inoculum Density Check. Inoculum density checks were performed for all quality
control and reproducibility organism suspensions and for 10% of the suspensions
prepared for susceptibility testing of the fresh clinical isolates.
The mean inoculum density of E. coli ATCC 25922 was acceptable at 4.83 X 105
CFU/mL.
Purity Check. All clinical, challenge and reproducibility test suspensions were
subcultured to assure purity.

Growth or Device Failure. There were no growth or device failures during the
course of the study.
Quality Control Testing. QC organisms for meropenem/vaborbactam recommended
by both FDA and the CLSI were tested at four sites. The QC organisms tested
included E. coli ATCC 25922, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, K. pneumoniae ATCC
BAA-1705, and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. These QC strains were tested a
minimum of 20 times per site by both the ETEST and the reference method. The
results demonstrate that the meropenem/vaborbactam ETEST can produce quality
control results in the recommended range > 95% of the time. See Table 2.1 below for
summary of the QC results.

· Incubation 35 °C in ambient air; 16-20 hours for all organisms
Clinical testing was performed at four sites using a total of 550 clinical isolates. There
were 313 fresh isolates (56.9%), 110 (20.0%) recent isolates, and 127 (23.1%) stock
isolates. Clinical isolates were tested using both ETEST and the reference method.
During the comparative testing, the EA performance of the 31 P. mirabilis isolates
did not meet the acceptance criteria and therefore was removed from the dataset. As a
result, there were a total of 519 clinical isolates after excluding the 31 P. mirabilis
isolates. This organism was also removed from the indicated organisms in the
indications for use statement.
A total of 79 challenge isolates were tested at a single site using ETEST and the
reference method. The EA performance of the four P. mirabilis isolates also did not
meet the acceptance criteria and was excluded from the calculation, resulting in a
total of 75 challenge isolates after excluding the four P. mirabilis isolates .
The comparative study (both clinical and challenge) included 594 Enterobacteriaceae
isolates. They were: C. freundii (32), C. koseri (32). K. aerogenes (33), E. cloacae
spp. complex (98), E. coli (136), K. oxytoca (31), K. pneumoniae (128), M. morganii
(31), P. rettgeri (21), P. stuartii (21), and S. marcescens (31).
Information on the Enterobacteriaceae isolates was added as a footnote to the
performance table in the package insert:
The performance data presented for Enterobacteriaceae exclude Proteus mirabilis.
There were C. freundii (32), C. koseri (32), K. aerogenes (33), E. cloacae complex
(98), E. coli (136), K. oxytoca (31), K. pneumoniae (128), M. morganii (31), P.
rettgeri (21), P. stuartii (21), and S. marcescens (31).

Enterobacteriaceae, with P. mirabilis removed, is acceptable at 95.8% EA and 99.3%
CA. There were no very major or major discrepancies; the minor discrepancy rate
was 0.7% (4/594). There were 13 isolates (11 K. pneumoniae and 2 E. coli ) that were
resistant to Meropenem/Vaborbactam in the comparative studies. A limitation was
included in the package insert:
The ability of the ETEST Meropenem/Vaborbactam to detect the following
resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates is unknown because resistant isolates were
either not available or an insufficient number was encountered at the time of
comparative testing: C. freundii, C. koseri. K. aerogenes, E. cloacae complex, E.
coli, K. oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, M. morganii, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii, and S.
marcescens.
Inoculator and ETEST Strip Applicator Options
Culture media plates for ETEST are traditionally inoculated and streaked by swabs;
ETEST strips are applied onto inoculated media by forceps. In the
Meropenem/Vaborbactam studies, inoculator RETRO C80 was used at two sites and
manual strip applicator, vacuum pen NEMA C88 was used at one site. The footnote
below is added to the performance table in the package insert:
Optional inoculator and ETEST strip applicator were used for plate inoculation
and applying ETEST strips onto agar media. In the studies, swab and Retro C80
were used for plate inoculation/streaking, forceps and vacuum pen NEMA C88
were used for ETEST strip applications.
MIC Trends:
Using the combined claincal and challenge data for Enterobacteriaceae, an analysis
of trending was conducted. Trending was assessed using current trending review
criteria (i.e., ≥30% difference between higher and lower dilution readings). This
trending calculation considers MIC values that are determined to be one or more
doubling dilution lower or higher compared to the reference method irrespective whether
the device MIC values are on-scale or not. The analysis is presented in Table 4.1 for
Enterobacteriaceae excluding P. mirabilis.

Trending was observed with Enterobacteriaceae. The difference between higher and
lower dilutions was -38.05%. The following footnote was included in the labeling to
address the trending:
ETEST Meropenem/Vaborbactam MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or
at least one doubling dilution lower when testing Enterobacteriaceae compared to
the CLSI reference broth microdilution.
MIC trends for each intended Enterobacteriaceae species was also evaluated as noted in Table
4.2 below.

Resistance Markers
Resistance markers for indicated Enterobacteriaceae isolates were provided in the
submission. They consisted mostly of βeta-lactamses including AmpC (ACT, CMY,
DHA), ESBL (CTX-M, TEM, SHV), carbapenemases (KPC, OXA, NDM, VIM,
SME). Class A βeta-lactamse (LEN-16) was also included. The study showed that
isolates with metallo-βeta-lactamses (NDM, and/or VIM) and OXA carbapenemases
were resistant to meropenem/vaborbactam as stated in the drug labeling. The footnote
below is added to the performance table in the package insert:
Meropenem/Vaborbactam is not active against bacteria that produce metallo-
beta-lactamases, oxacillinases with carbapenemase activity, or porin mutations
combined with overexpression of efflux pumps.
