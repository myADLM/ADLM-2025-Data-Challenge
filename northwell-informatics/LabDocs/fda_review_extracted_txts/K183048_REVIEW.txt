I. Device Description:
The Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Device is intended for the collection, preservation and
transport of oral fluid. An oral fluid specimen is collected by placing two cellulose pads
affixed to a polypropylene stem collector under the tongue of an individual until a defined
volume of saliva has saturated the cellulose pads. When sufficient volume is collected a blue
color is shown in a window on the stem. The collector is then separated into two pads A and
B, then transferred into two separate polypropylene tubes, both containing a volume of
preservative buffer. The tubes are stoppered with caps. The design with two pads and two
tubes allows for one aliquot to be used for screening and confirmation testing, and the other
aliquot to be stored in reserve in cases where re-testing by the confirmation method is
required. The Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection System collects 1 mL of neat oral fluid and
is diluted with 3 mL of preservative buffer.

weighed. After the volume adequacy indicator turned blue on both A and B collector
stems, each stem was weighed again. The volume was calculated from the weight
change and using the specific gravity for saliva based on scientific literature
references. The study found the mean ± standard deviation volume collected was
0.997 ± 0.05 mL (range 0.860 – 1.103) and 1.001 ± 0.05 (range 0.902 – 1.093) mL
for collectors A and B, respectively.
Sample Collection Time
A sample collection time study was conducted to verify the collection time range for
Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Device. The product labeling states that the
collection time may take from 2 to 10 minutes, and if the indicator has not turned blue
within 15 minutes, the pad should be removed from the mouth and discarded. In the
study, oral fluid samples were collected from a total of 125 subjects (including 75
drug users) following the instructions for use. The timer started when the collector
was placed into subject’s mouth, and stopped when the volume adequacy indicator
turned blue on both A and B collector stems. The sponsor reported that 99.2% (124
of 125) subjects were able to provide sufficient oral fluid within the recommended 10
minute collection. The mean time required for collection was 3 minutes and 54
seconds. The maximum time required for collection was reported as 11 minutes.
Drug Recovery
A drug recovery study was conducted to verify adequate analytical recovery of 15
drugs from oral fluid collected by the Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Device. The
samples under test for each drug (THC, benzoylecgonine, cocaine, morphine,
codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, 6-acetylmorphine, phencyclidine, amphetamine,
methamphetamine, buprenorphine, methadone, nordiazepam, and tramadol) were
prepared by spiking the drug into negative oral fluid at ±25% and +50% from the
concentrations listed in the table below. The sample concentrations were assayed by
LC/MS/MS or GC/MS prior to introduction into the collector. For each sample, three
Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Devices were sequentially dipped and removed
after the volume adequacy indicator turned blue. The collectors (pad A and B) were
then placed into the collection tubes, sealed with the cap, and stored overnight at
room temperature. The next day the liquids in the tubes were assayed by LC/MS/MS
or GC/MS in replicates of three per pad for each collection device for a total of 18
replicates at each concentration.

Oral Fluid Sample Stability
Sample stability studies were conducted to verify the stability of 15 drugs in human
oral fluid under the claimed storage stability conditions in the product labeling when
diluted with preservative buffer and stored in the Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection
Device polypropylene tube. The product labeling identifies that certain drugs in oral
fluid specimens collected with pad A of the Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collector are
stable for 10 days if stored refrigerated (2-8°C; 36-46°F) and stable for 5 or 10 days
(depending on the drug type) if stored at room temperature (8-25°C; 46-77°F). For
pad B specimens, certain drugs in oral fluid are stable for 1 month if stored
refrigerated. The product labeling also identifies that samples should be stored
diluted for a minimum of 4 hours at room temperature prior to testing to allow
sufficient time for any drug(s) present to be extracted from the pad into the
preservation buffer. The transportation claims were also supported by the specimen
stability studies.

Clinical Specimens Testing
Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Device versus expectoration
A study was conducted to verify that drug concentrations in oral fluid samples
collected by Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Device are analytically comparable to
the neat oral fluid samples collected by expectoration. The samples used in the study
were collected from self-reported drug user patients at a clinical research facility. For
each patient, a single neat oral fluid sample was collected by expectoration into a
borosilicate glass vial. An aliquot of each sample was subsequently processed
through the Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Device by dipping the collection pad
into the oral fluid until the volume adequacy indicator turned blue. The expectoration
samples and Quantisal II samples were assayed by LC-MS/MS or GC-MS. The assay
results from expectoration samples and for Quantisal II (pad A) were compared by
linear regression. The results are given in the following table.

The sponsor also provided a study demonstrating that the borosilicate glass vials used
to collect expectoration samples were analytically fit for purpose because of high
analyte recovery properties of the vial material. In the study, samples were prepared
in the subject vial by spiking drug free expectorated oral fluid with the drug analytes
(THC, benzoylecgonine, cocaine, morphine, codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, 6-
acetylmorphine, phencyclidine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, buprenorphine,
methadone, nordiazepam, or tramadol) at +50% above the concentrations listed in
table under Drug Recovery. The initial concentration of each sample was assayed by
LC-MS/MS or GC-MS. For each sample, three aliquots were subsequently taken
from the vial and dispensed into three vials. The vialed samples were stored at 25°C

for 48 hours and then tested in replicates of three for each vial using the same
analytical method. The recovery for all test samples in the subject vial was within
100 ±10%.
Pad A versus pad B
A second study was conducted to demonstrate that both collection pads on the
Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Device are equivalent when used under real world
conditions. In the study, samples were collected from self-reported drug user patients
at a clinical research facility using the Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Device. At
least 40 unaltered drug negative oral fluid samples and 40 unaltered oral fluid
samples containing analyte from each drug class were collected. The samples were
assayed by LC-MS/MS or GC-MS. The assay results from samples for pad A and pad
B were compared by linear regression. The results are given in the following table.

In the study, the patient samples included 40 drug negative oral fluid samples that
were collected using the Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Device and also collected
by expectoration into a borosilicate glass vial. A comparison of the expectoration
samples and Quantisal II samples was conducted by assaying for drugs using LC-
MS/MS or GC-MS. To remove bias, the sequence of collection between
expectoration and the Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Device was randomized. The
assay results across all drugs were negative for both the expectoration samples and
samples collected by the Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Device.
Biocompatibility
The Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Device has short term contact (up to 15
minutes) with the patient’s mouth during oral fluid collection. The materials
comprising the Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Device are the same as those of the
Quantisal I Oral Fluid Collection Device (cleared under k942435 with tradename
Saliva Sampler), and therefore no new biocompatibility testing was performed.
