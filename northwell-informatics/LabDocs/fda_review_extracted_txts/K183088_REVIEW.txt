L. Test Principle:
The Access EPO assay is a two-site immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay. A sample is
added to a reaction vessel along with the paramagnetic particles coated with mouse
monoclonal anti-EPO, blocking reagent and the alkaline phosphatase conjugate. After
incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field
while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate is added to
the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light
production is directly proportional to the concentration of EPO in the sample. The amount of
analyte in the sample is determined from a stored, multi-point calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The ADVIA Centaur EPO assay is traceable to the World Health Organization
(WHO) 2nd International Reference Preparation for Erythropoietin (Human, urinary
derived); NIBSC code: 67/343. The ADVIA Centaur EPO assay is also traceable to
the 3rd World Health Organization (WHO) International standard for Erythropoietin,
recombinant, for bioassay; NIBSC code: 11/170.
Sample Stability
A sample stability study was conducted with pooled serum and plasma samples as
well as neat native samples to demonstrate stability under room temperature
conditions for 8 hours. The pooled samples were tested at T0, 1, 2, 4, 18 and 20
hours. The native samples were tested at T0, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 25 hours. All
subsequent time points were within acceptable limits of timepoint zero. Room
temperature serum and plasma sample stability was established at 20 hours.
A similar study was conducted with pooled serum and plasma samples as well as neat
native samples at multiple concentrations across the measurement range to
demonstrate stability under refrigerated storage conditions. All timepoints were
within acceptable limits of timepoint zero. Sample stability for serum and plasma was
established at 7 days under refrigerated storage conditions (2−8ºC).
Sample stability studies were also conducted to substantiate sample storage claims at
-20ºC with pooled samples at multiple concentrations across the measurement range
to demonstrate stability under frozen storage conditions for 7 days. Each sample was
tested at multiple timepoints and the results of the study were within acceptable
limits. Sample stability was established for serum and plasma samples at -20ºC for 7
days.
Lastly, a freeze-thaw study was performed with multiple pooled serum and plasma
samples at concentrations across the measurement range. The results of the study
support the claimed maximum number of three freeze-thaw cycles for both serum and
plasma samples.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) was determined by testing four blank samples (calf serum)
on one analyzer with three reagent lots, over three days. Each sample was analyzed in
one run per day and five replicates per run, providing a total of 180 replicates. LoB
was calculated by rank ordering the 72 samples per microcuvette lot from low to high
and averaging the 68th and 69th results (being the 95th percentile). LoB was
determined to be 0.46 mIU/mL.
The limit of detection (LoD) was determined by testing human serum and plasma
samples with low EPO concentrations. The study was conducted with 10 samples
(eight serum and two plasma) by one analyzer and three reagent lots, over 5–6 days
per reagent lot. Each sample was analyzed in one run per day and 3‒6 replicates per
run, providing 259‒323 replicates per reagent lot. LoD was calculated by
6

--- Page 7 ---
nonparametric analysis and was determined to be 0.75 mIU/mL.
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was determined by testing human serum and plasma
samples with low EPO concentrations. The study was conducted with 10 samples
(eight serum and two plasma) by one analyzer and three reagent lots, over 5–6 days
per reagent lot. Each sample was analyzed in one run per day and 3‒6 replicates per
run, providing 259‒323 replicates per reagent lot. LoQ was determined to be 0.83
mIU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by spiking pooled human serum with rhEPO to
achieve two levels (4–6 mIU/mL and 25–35 mIU/mL). Each of these samples were
divided into a test pool with the potential interferent added and a control sample with
no added interferent. For substances identified as interferents at the highest
concentration tested, a concentration-response curve evaluating multiple
concentrations of the interfering substance was generated to determine the non-
interfering concentration. A total of 11 potential endogenous interferents and six
potential exogenous interferents were evaluated. Each sample was tested in five
replicates on one ADVIA Centaur XP. The highest tested concentrations at which no
significant interference was observed (defined by the sponsor as ≤ 10% difference)
are presented in the following table:

To determine the cross reactivity of potential cross reactants with the ADVIA
Centaur EPO assay, two serum samples were examined. One sample was pooled
normal serum at 4–6 mIU/mL and the other was pooled normal serum with spiked
rhEPO to achieve an EPO concentration of 25–35 mIU/mL. Either one or four
concentrations of the cross reactant was added to these two serum samples for the
calculation of % cross-reactivity. No cross-reactivity was observed. The results of
the study are present in the following table:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Four different method comparison studies were performed: single site (in-house) with
frozen samples, multisite study with frozen samples, and two single site studies with
native samples.
For the single site using frozen samples, a total of 222 frozen serum samples were
thawed and measured in singlicate. Among these samples were: 22 infants (1 month
to 2 years), 12 children (2 to 12 years), 20 adolescents (12 to 21 years), and 20
collected from EPO therapy donors. Additionally, five serum samples were collected
from patients with the following conditions: chronic kidney disease, lymphoma,
myeloma, non-renal anemia, polycythemia, and renal anemia. Ninety-two (41%)
samples were from the U.S., 21 (10%) contrived, and 6 samples were excluded due to
“device errors or a result not within the measurement interval of the predicate device
or new device were excluded”. The study was performed with three reagent lots and
testing was performed on the ADVIA Centaur XP for the subject assay and the
Beckman Coulter Access Immunoassay system for the predicate assay. A total of 216
samples in the range of 3.29–691.60 mIU/mL were evaluated in the Passing-Bablok
regression analysis. The results of the study are as follows: y= 0.99x + 0.81 mIU/mL,
and r=0.99.

For the multisite study using frozen samples, testing using the candidate device
ADVIA Centaur EPO assay was performed at three sites and testing using the
predicate device, Beckman Access EPO, was performed at a single site. A total of
341 frozen serum samples were thawed and measured. Among these samples, 28
were adolescents (12 to 21 years) and 20 were collected from EPO therapy donors.
Additionally, serum samples collected from patients with the following conditions
were tested: chronic kidney disease, lymphoma, myeloma, non-renal anemia, and
polycythemia. Fourteen samples were removed as nine samples generated no result
by the instrument and five were outside the measurement range.
For the first single site study using native samples with endogenous EPO stored
frozen, 140 samples were tested across the measurement range on both the candidate
and predicate devices. This study included more samples at the lower end of the
measuring range to cover medical decision limits around 1.5–2.5 mIU/mL and <1.4
mIU/mL. The results of the study are as follows: y= 1.00x + 0.23 mIU/mL.
For the second single site study using fresh native samples with endogenous EPO
stored at room temperature, 100 samples were tested across the measurement range
on both the candidate and predicate devices. This study included samples in the
following range: 4.00–445.68 mIU/mL. The results of the study were evaluated with
Passing-Bablok regression analysis. The results of the study are as follows: y= 1.07x
– 0.00 mIU/mL, and r=1.00. The 95% CI were reported for the slope (1.04, 1.10),
intercept (-0.42, 0.41) and r value (1.00, 1.00).
b. Matrix comparison:
A study was performed to compare serum to the other five sample types including:
K EDTA, LiHep, NaHep, PST (plasma separator tube), and SST (serum separator
2
tube), using the ADVIA Centaur EPO assay. Each sample was tested in singlicate and
the study was performed with one reagent lot. Samples were collected from 23 donors
for each of the six sample types and each sample with each collection tube type was
split into three aliquots: one was tested as the neat sample that ranged 4.39–33.32
mIU/mL, while the second and third aliquots were spiked with rhEPO to achieve
about 300 and 600 mIU/mL to cover the medium and high end of the AMR,
respectively. The results of the study were found to be acceptable.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
A reference range study was performed to determine the expected EPO concentration for
the adult population. A total of 251 serum samples collected from 128 apparently healthy
adult males and 123 apparently healthy adult females in the U.S. Using non-parametric
data analysis, the 95% central reference interval was calculated. The reference range for
adult males and females are 5.41–36.90 mIU/mL and 2.92–35.17 mIU/mL, respectively.
In addition, a reference range study was performed for the pediatric population with a
total of 266 serum samples collected from 140 apparently healthy males and 140
apparently healthy females in the U.S. A total of 14 samples in the infant group (> 1
