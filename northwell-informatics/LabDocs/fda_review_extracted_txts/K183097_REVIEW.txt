L. Test Principle:
The Kangzhou One Step hCG Test Strip, Kangzhou One Step hCG Test Cassette, and
Kangzhou One Step hCG Test Midstream devices utilize a double antibody sandwich
method. During the test procedure, hCG in the urine specimen reacts with the dye conjugate
(mouse anti-β-hCG antibody-colloidal gold conjugate specific to the beta subunit of hCG)
and forms a complex. This complex migrates by capillary action along the test strip to the α-
hCG antibody test line; If hCG is present in the sample, the complex is captured onto the test
line, where if hCG is present at concentrations above the cutoff, a red line becomes visible
indicating a positive result. If hCG is not present in the sample above the cutoff, no line is
visible on the test line, indicating a negative result. The control line should develop
regardless of the test line result, if the test was correctly used and/or performed correctly,
since mouse anti-β-hCG antibody-colloidal gold conjugate is present in excess to bind to the
antibodies at the control line, resulting in a visible red line.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed for the Kangzhou One Step hCG Test Strip,
Kangzhou One Step hCG Test Cassette, and Kangzhou One Step hCG Test
Midstream devices using 30 urine samples collected from non-pregnant females
spiked with hCG traceable to the WHO 5th International Standard (IS). Samples
created had concentrations of 0mIU/mL,12.5mIU/mL, 18.75mIU/mL, 25mIU/mL,
50mIU/mL, and 100mIU/mL Samples were masked and randomized prior to testing.
The study was conducted over 10 days by multiple operators at 3 sites. Three lots of
each of the three devices were tested. The midstream format was tested with both the
dip and (simulated) midstream method.

e. Analytical specificity:
To evaluate the potential for interference by certain exogenous and endogenous
compounds and potentially interfering clinical conditions, testing for the Kangzhou
One Step hCG Test Strip, Kangzhou One Step hCG Test Cassette, and Kangzhou One
Step hCG Test Midstream devices was performed using two urine samples with
concentrations of 0 and 25 mIU/ml hCG. These two samples were spiked with each
of the known interferents to obtain the desired test concentration. Three different lots
of each device format were tested. The results demonstrated that no interferences
were observed from substances at the following concentrations for both negative and
positive hCG urine samples.
Interfering substances Substance concentration
Acetaminophen 20mg/dL
Aspirin 20mg/dL
Ascorbic acid 20mg/dL
Atropine 20mg/dL
Caffeine 20mg/dL
Glucose 2000mg/dL
Hemoglobin 500mg/dL
Tetracycline 20mg/dL
Ampicillin 20mg/dL
Albumin 2000mg/dL

Effects of hCG β-core fragment:
To evaluate potential interference by hCG β-core fragment for the Kangzhou One
Step hCG Test Strip, Kangzhou One Step hCG Test Cassette, and Kangzhou One
Step hCG Test Midstream devices, an hCG negative urine sample and a urine sample
with 25mIU/mL were spiked with the hCG β-core fragment (traceable to WHO
reference reagent 99/708) to yield samples with concentrations of 125,000, 250,000,
500,000 and 1,000,000 pmol/mL. These samples were tested with 3 lots of each
device. The data obtained demonstrated that there is no interference by hCG β-core
fragment at the concentrations tested.
Cross-reactivity:
To evaluate cross-reactivity for the Kangzhou One Step hCG Test Strip, Kangzhou
One Step hCG Test Cassette, and Kangzhou One Step hCG Test Midstream devices,
hCG negative and hCG positive urines (25 mIU/mL hCG) were spiked with various
concentrations of the glycoprotein hormones, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle

stimulating Hormone (FSH), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). These samples
were tested 3 lots of each device. The results demonstrated there is no interference
from the tested glycoprotein hormones up to 500 mIU/mL LH, 1000 mIU/mL FSH,
and 1000 mIU/mL TSH in either negative or positive urine samples.
pH Interference Study:
To evaluate potential interference from changes in urine pH for the Kangzhou One
Step hCG Test Strip, Kangzhou One Step hCG Test Cassette, and Kangzhou One
Step hCG Test Midstream devices, urine samples containing 0 mIU/mL and 25
mIU/mL hCG were tested with 3 lots of each device using samples at pH values of
3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9. The results demonstrated that samples within the pH range of 3-9
do not interfere with either positive or negative results from the device.
Specific Gravity interference study:
To evaluate potential interference from changes in specific gravity for the Kangzhou
One Step hCG Test Strip, Kangzhou One Step hCG Test Cassette, and Kangzhou
One Step hCG Test Midstream devices, urine samples containing 0mIU/mL and 25
mIU/mL hCG were adjusted to specific gravities spanning the physiological range
and tested with 3 lots of each device. The results indicate that changes in specific
gravity do not interfere with either positive or negative results from the device.
Hook effect:
To evaluate the high dose hook effect for the Kangzhou One Step hCG Test Strip,
Kangzhou One Step hCG Test Cassette, and Kangzhou One Step hCG Test
Midstream devices, hCG free specimens were spiked with varying hCG
concentrations: 62,500 mIU/ml, 125,000 mIU/ml, 250,000 mIU/ml, 500,000 mIU/ml,
and1,000,000 mIU/ml. These samples were tested using 3 lots of each device. The
result show that there is no hook effect observed at the concentrations tested.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
A lay-user study was conducted with 360 lay users. Each subject tested their own
urine on the candidate device following instructions on the package insert. The same
sample was tested by a healthcare professional using the candidate devices as well as
the predicate device. This included 90 lay users using test strip, 90 using test cassette,
180 using actual midstream method and the dip method respectively. Subject ages
ranged from 18 to 45 years. All samples were masked and randomized prior to
professional testing.
