4. Panel:
83 - Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
For use with MicroScan Dried Gram Negative MIC/Combo Panels and Dried Gram
Negative Breakpoint Combo panels. MicroScan panels are designed for use in
determining antimicrobial agent susceptibility and/or identification to the species level of
aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel is used to determine
quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on
solid media of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacilli.
After inoculation, panels are incubated for 16 – 20 hours at 35°C ± 1°C in a non-CO
2
incubator, and read either visually or with MicroScan instrumentation, according to the
package insert.
This particular submission is for the addition of the antimicrobial
meropenem/vaborbactam at concentrations of 0.03/8 to 64/8 µg/mL to the test panel.
The gram-negative organisms which may be used for meropenem/vaborbactam
susceptibility testing in this panel are as follows:
Meropenem/vaborbactam has been shown to be active both clinically and in vitro against
the gram negative bacteria listed below according to the FDA drug approved label:
· Enterobacter cloacae complex
· Escherichia coli
· Klebsiella pneumoniae
Meropenem/vaborbactam has been shown to be active in vitro only against the gram-
negative bacteria listed below according to the FDA drug approved label:
· Citrobacter freundii
· Citrobacter koseri
· Enterobacter aerogenes
· Klebsiella oxytoca
· Morganella morganii,
2

--- Page 3 ---
· Proteus mirabilis
· Providencia spp
· Serratia marcescens
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Prescription use only.
The following limitations are included in the labeling:
· “Performance of meropenem/vaborbactam when testing Morganella morganii
using the Prompt Inoculation system with the autoSCAN-4 or manual read
methods were outside of essential agreement compared to the reference method
and should be tested using the turbidity inoculation method.”
· “Elevated MICs with beta-lactam antimicrobials (e.g. aztreonam,
ceftazidime/avibactam, Ceftolozane/tazobactam, meropenem/vaborbactam) may
be observed if panels are over-inoculated with microorganisms such as
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Morganella spp., and
Providencia spp. Inoculum concentration is critical with these antimicrobials as
their mechanism of action involves disruption of bacterial cell wall synthesis. The
user should pay careful attention to inoculum preparation, especially with manual
methods that are technique dependent such as the Prompt system or inoculum
prepared without the aid of a photometric device”.
· “The ability of the MicroScan Dried Negative Panels to detect resistance to
meropenem/vaborbactam is unknown with C. koseri, E. aerogenes, K. oxytoca, M.
morganii, P. mirabilis, Providencia species and S. marcescens because resistant
strains were not available at the time of comparative testing. If such isolates are
observed, they should be tested on an alternate method and /or submitted to a
reference lab”.
· “Meropenem/vaborbactam is not active against bacteria that produce metallo-
beta lactamases or oxacillinases with carbapenemase activity”.
4. Special instrument requirements:
MicroScan panels can be read either manually or automatically on the WalkAway or
autoSCAN-4 instrument systems.
I. Device Description:
The MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo panel with meropenem/vaborbactam is
used to determine the quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of

3. CLSI M100-S28. Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing;
Twenty-Eight Informational Supplement, January 2018.
L. Test Principle:
The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are dehydrated miniaturizations of the broth dilution
susceptibility test. Various antimicrobial agents are diluted in Mueller Hinton broth
supplemented with calcium and magnesium to concentrations spanning the range of clinical
interest. Breakpoint Combo panels use concentrations equivalent to the categorical
breakpoints of FDA and/or CLSI. After inoculation and rehydration with a standardized
suspension of organism and incubation at 35°C for a minimum of 16 hours, the minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test organism is determined by observing the lowest
antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three external sites using 14 gram negative
strains that were consistent with the intended use. The range of
Meropenem/vaborbactam dilutions tested was 0.03/8 to 64/8 µg/mL. Isolates were
tested in triplicate over three days (total of 27 replicates per strain). The isolates
tested in the reproducibility study included C. freundii (one isolate), E. aerogenes
(one isolate), E. cloacae (one isolate), E. coli (three isolates), K. oxytoca (one isolate),
K. pneumoniae (three isolates), P. aeruginosa (two isolates), P. mirabilis (one
isolate), S. marcescens (one isolate). Inocula were prepared using both the turbidity
and Prompt inoculum methods and results were read manually and with the
WalkAway (WA) and autoSCAN-4 (AS4) instruments.
The majority of data points were on-scale and within ± one doubling dilution

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Inoculum Density Check. A spectrophotometric device, the MicroScan Turbidity
Meter was used to ensure quality control of the turbidity inoculum method. The
turbidity inocula were prepared using the MicroScan Turbidity Meter with a reading
of 0.08 ± 0.02 (equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland barium sulfate turbidity standard). The
digital reading was recorded each day of use at each clinical trial site.
Organism density data was also collected during the Reproducibility phase of the
study for suspensions prepared using the Prompt inoculum preparation method.
Colony counts were performed weekly using the quality control strain E. coli ATCC
25922. Colony counts were also done once at each site for each reproducibility
isolate. All results were acceptable.
Purity Check. Purity check plates were performed on all isolates tested during the
clinical study for meropenem/vaborbactam. If a purity plate indicates mixed culture,
the isolate was retested.
Growth Failure Rate. During the clinical trial, there were no growth failures with
both the MicroScan panel and the CLSI frozen reference method with
Meropenem/vaborbactam.
Quality Control Testing. The CLSI and FDA recommended QC organisms (E. coli

*The lowest end point of the MicroScan Meropenem/Vaborbactam MIC range is ≤0.03 µg/mL. Obtaining this value was
considered as an indicator that the quality control test results were acceptable.
1E. coli ATCC 25922, E. coli ATCC 35218, and K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 are not required for routine testing.
2K. pneumoniae ATCC BAA-1705 is recommended for routine QC with Meropenem/Vaborbactam. The QC range for K.
pneumoniae ATCC BAA-1705 is ≤0.03/8-0.06/8 μg/mL (Table 3a).
Because of the meropenem/vaborbactam dilution range of 0.03/8 – 64/8 µg/mL, all MIC
values for the QC strains tested were off-scale, except for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853.
Therefore, only P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 is recommended for QC testing of
meropenem/vaborbactam. In addition, K. pneumoniae BAA-1705 is recommended for routine
QC with meropenem/vaborbactam and with meropenem alone. The strains included in the
Quality Control section of the MicroScan Dried Gram Negative Procedural Manual are shown
in Table 3a.

to ensure that the plasmid encoding β-lactamase has not been lost, this strain was tested using a single β-lactam agent
(meropenem) as instructed in CLSI M100, 28th ed. QC performance of meropenem on the frozen reference panel confirmed
the integrity of this QC strain to reliably QC meropenem/vaborbactam at all sites.
Quality control results of all QC organisms tested met the acceptance criteria of > 95%

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The results obtained with the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel
with meropenem/vaborbactam were compared to results obtained using a frozen broth
microdilution reference panel at three testing sites in the U.S.
The reference panel was prepared according to CLSI M07-A10 guidelines except for
the use of Pluronic-F in the inoculum water for the reference panel. A validation
study was performed to demonstrate equivalence between reference panels inoculated
with organisms suspended in water supplemented with Pluronic-F and reference
panels inoculated with autoclaved distilled water without Pluronic-F. The essential
agreement (EA) of MIC values obtained using Pluronic-F as the diluent as compared
to MIC values obtained using autoclaved distilled water as the diluent was 100% and
the categorical agreement (CA) was 92.9%.
The Enterobacteriaceae clinical data was collected on a dried test panel which
included twelve dilutions of meropenem/vaborbactam (0.03/8-64/8 µg/mL). The data
analysis was performed by comparing test panel results to the reference results.
For each organism tested, MicroScan panels and reference panels were inoculated
using the same standardized suspension further diluted into 25 mL of water with
either Pluronic-D (for the MicroScan dried panels) or Pluronic-F (for the frozen
reference panels). Panels were inoculated using both the Prompt System and by the
Turbidity method; MicroScan panels were read using the WalkAway, the autoSCAN4
and Manual Read. The reference panels were read manually. Performance was
9

--- Page 10 ---
evaluated using FDA breakpoints for Meropenem/vaborbactam, and results were
analyzed based on the guidelines provided in the AST Class II Special Controls
Guidance Document. The primary read has been identified as the WalkAway system
with the prompt inoculation system. The clinical data are also presented on the two
secondary read methods collected at the three sites, which includes MicroScan and
autoSCAN-4 instruments and manual reads with both Prompt and turbidity
inoculation methods.
Clinical Study:
Clinical testing was performed at three US sites. A total of 560 Enterobacteriaceae
clinical isolates were tested including C. freundii (63 isolates), C. koseri (57 isolates),
E. aerogenes (55 isolates), E. cloacae complex (67 isolates) E. coli (64 isolates), K.
oxytoca (49 isolates), K. pneumoniae (59 isolates), M. morganii (29 isolates), P.
mirabilis (32 isolates), Providencia species (51 isolates) and S. marcescens (34
isolates). Of the 560 clinical isolates, 358 (69.10%) were fresh isolates,136 (24.3%)
were recent isolates and 66 (11.8%) were stock isolates.
Challenge Study:
Challenge testing was performed at one internal site. A total of 95 challenge isolates
of Enterobacteriaceae were evaluated. The Enterobacteriaceae isolates included C.
freundii (4 isolates), C. koseri (3 isolates), E. aerogenes (5 isolates), E. cloacae
complex (13 isolates), E. coli (10 isolates), K. oxytoca (4), K. pneumoniae (30
isolates), M. morganii (4 isolates),,P. mirabilis (5 isolates), Providencia species (11
isolates), and S. marcescens (6 isolates).
The performance of the 655 clinical and challenge isolates is summarized in Tables 3
and 4.

EA – Essential Agreement (+/- 2 dilutions) min – minor discrepancies
CA – Category Agreement maj – major discrepancies
EVAL – Evaluable isolates vmj – very major discrepancies
R or NS – Resistant or non-susceptible isolates
Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the result of the
reference method and that of the MicroScan panel within plus or minus one serial
two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on scale for
both the MicroScan panel and the reference method. Category Agreement (CA)
occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly
with the interpretation of the MicroScan panel.
Overall Performance:
The overall essential agreement and category agreement of the MicroSCAN
Meropenem/Vaborbactam for all Enterobacteriaceae is acceptable at ≥90.0 % for both
inoculation methods across all read methods (Tables 4 and 5). The essential agreement of
evaluable results was also acceptable with both the prompt and the turbidity inoculation methods
across all read methods.

With the Prompt inoculation method across all reads, there was no very major or major
discrepancies; (Table 4). The minor discrepancy rate was 0.9% (6/655).
The high very major error rate of 3.3% observed with the turbidity inoculation method across all
read methods (Table 5) was attributed to Citrobacter freundii strains which had one of two
challenge resistant isolates false susceptible result with an MIC of 4µg/mL with test panel and an
MIC of 16µg/mL by the reference method. The following footnote was added to the Procedural
Manual:
“One of the two resistant Citrobacter freundii strains had discrepant results compared to
the reference method when using the turbidity inoculation method across all read
methods”.
Since the number the number of resistant isolates tested during the comparative studies was low
(31), 25 additional resistant isolates were evaluated during verification on all read and
inoculation methods. The combined data of 56 resistant isolates had no additional very major
errors. The expansion of the resistant isolates pool resulted in a very major error rate less than
2% which is acceptable.
Morganella morganii was observed to have low essential agreement with Prompt inoculation
method when read on the autoSCAN-4 instrument (84.8%) and manually (72.7%), whereas
categorical agreement was 100%. However, the performance of this organism was acceptable
when read by the WalkAway with an essential agreement of 93.9%. The following limitation are
included in the procedural manual:
“Performance of meropenem/vaborbactam when testing Morganella morganii using the
Prompt Inoculation system with the autoSCAN-4 or manual read methods were outside of
essential agreement compared to the reference method and should be tested using the
turbidity inoculation method”.
“Elevated MICs with beta-lactam antimicrobials (e.g. aztreonam, ceftazidime/avibactam,
Ceftolozane/tazobactam, meropenem/vaborbactam) may be observed if panels are over-
inoculated with microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia spp., Proteus
spp., Morganella spp., and Providencia spp. Inoculum concentration is critical with these
antimicrobials as their mechanism of action involves disruption of bacterial cell wall
synthesis. The user should pay careful attention to inoculum preparation, especially with
manual methods that are technique dependent as the Prompt system or inoculum
prepared without the aid of a photometric device”.
To address the testing of non-indicated species the following statement is included in the device
labeling:
“The safety and efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested
by this AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled
clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those found in the
12

--- Page 13 ---
indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of susceptibility information in
those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for specific antimicrobial drugs provides the
uses for which the antimicrobial drug is approved”.
Resistant Organisms:
A total of 31 resistant isolates were identified out of 655 organisms tested (4.7%) in the
combined challenge and clinical study of with Meropenem/vaborbactam However, the following
indicated organisms had no resistant isolates available during comparative testing: Citrobacter
koseri, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella oxytoca, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis,
Providencia species and Serratia marcescens. This was addressed by adding the following
limitation in the labeling:
“The ability of the MicroScan Dried Negative Panels to detect resistance to
meropenem/vaborbactam is unknown with C. koseri, E. aerogenes, K. oxytoca, M.
morganii, P. mirabilis, Providencia species and S. marcescens because resistant
strains were not available at the time of comparative testing. If such isolates are
observed, they should be tested on an alternate method and /or submitted to a
reference lab”.
Trending:
An analysis of trending was conducted using the combined clinical and challenge data for
Enterobacteriaceae and for each claimed species within the Enterobacteriaceae group with
meropenem/vaborbactam 0.03/8-64/8 µg/mL for both inoculation methods (Prompt and
Turbidity).
This trending calculation takes into account MIC values that are determined to be one or more
doubling dilutions lower or higher compared to the reference method irrespective of whether the
device MIC values for both systems are on-scale or not. A difference of ≥30% between the
percentage of isolates with higher versus lower readings compared to the reference method was
considered evidence of significant trending. Trending that provides higher or lower MIC values
compared to the reference is addressed in labeling.
The analysis for trending takes into account only results that are evaluable for trending. Results
that cannot be evaluated because it is unclear if they are at least one dilution lower, at least one
dilution higher or in exact agreement with the CLSI reference method are not taken into account
in the trending analysis.
The analysis for which significant high trending was observed is outlined in Tables 6 and 7
below. Table 6 demonstrates the results for Prompt inoculation method by reading method for
each species and by manual reading for all Enterobacteriaceae. Table 7 demonstrates the results
for Turbidity inoculation method by reading method for Providencia species.

Based on the above results, the following footnotes were added to the meropenem/vaborbactam
Procedural Manual to address the observed trending:
“Meropenem/vaborbactam MIC values tended to be one or more doubling dilution
higher when compared to the reference broth microdilution method for P. mirabilis.,
Providencia spp., Enterobacter cloacae complex and Morganella morganii with the
WalkAway, autoSCAN-4 and manual reads when using the Prompt Inoculation system.
Additionally, Meropenem/vaborbactam MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or at
least one doubling dilution higher when testing Enterobacteriaceae when using the
Prompt Inoculation system and the manual read compared to the CLSI reference broth
method”
“Meropenem/vaborbactam MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or at least one
doubling dilution higher when compared to the reference broth microdilution for
Providencia spp. with autoSCAN-4 and manual reads when using the turbidity
Inoculation method”.
Resistance Mechanisms:
The meropenem/vaborbactam approved drug label indicates activity against specific resistance
mechanisms. Therefore, resistance mechanisms for indicated Enterobacteriaceae isolates were
tested in the challenge phase and provided in the submission. They consisted mostly of βeta-
lactamases and Extended-spectrum Beta-lactamases (Table 7).
