H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The TEG 6s Hemostasis System consists of the TEG 6s Hemostasis Analyzer and TEG
6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge. The TEG 6s Hemostasis System is intended for
in vitro diagnostic use to provide semi-quantitative indications of the hemostasis state of
a venous blood sample. The TEG 6s Hemostasis System records the kinetic changes in a
sample of 3.2% citrated whole blood as the sample clots.
The Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge contains three independent assays (CK, CRT
and CFF) and the system output consists of a table of numerical values for parameters R,
LY30, and MA.
The CK assay monitors the hemostasis process via the intrinsic pathway in 3.2% citrated
whole blood specimens on the TEG 6s Hemostasis System. Clotting characteristics are
described by the functional parameters R (clotting time) and LY30 (fibrinolysis after 30
minutes of reaching maximum clot strength).
The CRT assay monitors the hemostasis process via both the intrinsic and extrinsic
pathways in 3.2% citrated whole blood specimens on the TEG 6s Hemostasis System.
Clotting characteristics are described by the functional parameter MA (maximum clot
strength).
The CFF assay monitors hemostasis of 3.2% citrated whole blood specimens in the TEG
6s Hemostasis System after blocking platelet contributions to clot strength. Clotting
characteristics are described by the functional parameter MA (maximum clot strength).
Results from the TEG 6s analysis should not be the sole basis for a patient diagnosis, but
should be evaluated together with the patient's medical history, the clinical picture and, if
necessary, further hemostasis tests. The indication for TEG 6s Hemostasis System use is
with adult patients (18 years and older) where an evaluation of their blood hemostasis
properties is desired. Hemostasis evaluation with the TEG 6s Hemostasis System using
the Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge is used to assess clinical conditions in a trauma
setting to assess hemorrhage or thrombosis conditions.

TEG 6s Hemostasis Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The TEG 6s Hemostasis System is comprised of the following components: TEG Hemostasis
analyzer and TEG 6s Assay Cartridge. The TEG 6s Hemostasis System is intended for in
vitro diagnostic use to measure the physical and developmental properties (rate, strength, and
stability) of clot formation in a whole blood sample through the oscillating motion of a
pendant drop of blood in response to external vibration. As the sample transitions from a
liquid state to a gel-like state during clotting, the modulus of elasticity and resonant
frequency increase, thus, the analyzer measures these variations in resonant frequency during
clotting and lysis. The system output consists of a table of numerical values or graphic
representation of the results from the hemostasis process over time.
The TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge is used to perform the Citrated Kaolin
(CK), Citrated RapidTEG (CRT) and Citrated Functional Fibrinogen (CFF) assays and
consists of three independent measurement channels, each pre-filled with the dried reagents.
The CK assay channel contains Kaolin and CaCl , the CRT assay channel contains Kaolin,
2
CaCl and Tissue Factor, and the CFF assay channel contains abciximab, Tissue Factor and
2
CaCl .
2
CK (Citrated Kaolin) Assay: Kaolin acts as a contact surface activator (intrinsic pathway)
which activates Factor XII and platelets and stimulates the reserve clotting ability of a blood
sample. Kaolin is combined with CaCl to neutralize any sodium citrated in the blood.
2
Clotting characteristics are described by the functional parameters Clotting Time (R), the
time from the start of the test until in initial fibrin formation, and Clot Lysis (LY30), a
measurement of the rate of fibrinolysis 30 minutes after Maximum Clot Strength (MA) is
reached.
CRT (Citrated RapidTEG) Assay: In the CRT Assay, the clotting process is accelerated by
simultaneously activating the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways using a high
concentration of Kaolin and Tissue Factor. Clotting characteristics are described by the
functional parameter Maximum Clot Strength (MA).
CFF (Citrated Functional Fibrinogen) Assay: In the CFF Assay, the extrinsic pathway is
activated using Tissue Factor and inhibits platelet aggregation using abciximab, a platelet
inhibitor that binds to GPIIb/IIIa receptors. By excluding the platelet aggregation
contribution to clot strength (MA), the assay determines fibrinogen contribution. Clotting
characteristics are described by the functional parameter Maximum Clot Strength (MA).

L. Test Principle:
The TEG 6s Hemostasis Analyzer has four independent measurement channels. Each channel
consists of a short vertically-oriented injection molded tube (ring) with a diameter of 2.5mm
and a length of 4.5mm. The TEG 6s Hemostasis analyzer uses a resonant frequency
technology with optic analysis by assessment of clot viscoelasticity through the response to
vibrations over the spectrum of frequency. With LED illumination, a detector measures in the
vertical motion of the blood meniscus. The resulting motion of the meniscus is monitored
optically and recorded by the analyzer to calculate the resonant frequency and the clot’s
physical development such as clot rate, strength and stability. To measure the clot strength

with the resonance method, the sample is exposed to a fixed vibration frequency. The
frequency leading to resonance is identified and then converted to the TEG system readout.
The exact frequencies at which resonance occurs will depend on the clot stiffness and mass
of the sample. During coagulation, the stronger clots will have higher resonant frequencies
and higher TEG readouts. During fibrinolysis, the clot begins breaking down and the
resonant frequencies decrease.
To perform a test, a disposable TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge is inserted into the
analyzer. Twenty microliters (20μL) of whole blood sample (3.2% sodium citrated whole
blood) or control (AQC/LQC) material is added to an entry port on the cartridge and drawn
into the cartridge under analyzer control. The amount of the sample drawn into the cartridge
is automatically determined by the volume of the blood chambers in the cartridge and is
metered into separate analysis channels. Reconstitution of dried reagents within the cartridge
is accomplished by moving the sample back and forth through the reagent chambers, under
the control of microfluidic valves and pumps within the cartridge. After each sample has
been mixed with reagent, it is delivered to three designated test cells where it is monitored
for visco-elastic changes due to coagulation. Excess sample material is moved under
microfluidic control into an enclosed waste chamber within the cartridge.
In a typical test, blood that has been delivered to the test cell will not clot for several minutes.
During this time the sample has no inherent stiffness except that provided by surface tension,
and since this remains constant the measured resonant frequencies will not change. During
coagulation, however, a clot will bind to the test tube (ring) and the resonant frequency will
rise with increasing firmness of the clot. During fibrinolysis, the process is reversed, the clot
stiffness and resonant frequencies decrease. The TEG 6s Analyzer collects meniscus motion
data, tracks changing resonant frequencies and analyzes the frequency data to provide semi-
quantitative parameters describing the clot.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
The design of the TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge is identical to the design
of the TEG 6s Citrated Multichannel Cartridge: K, KH, RT, FF Assay Cartridge
(formerly named the Citrated Multichannel Cartridge), cleared in K150041. Both
cartridges also contain the same reagents. The difference between assay cartridges is the
exclusion of the Citrated Kaolin with Heparinase (CKH) assay channel and the addition
of the CK-LY30 parameter in the CK Assay for the TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay
Cartridge (subject device cartridge). Therefore, CK-LY30 was the only parameter
evaluated for the precision, linearity/assay reportable range and stability studies. The
performance of the CRT and CFF Assays in addition to the CK-R parameter in the CK
Assay for the precision, linearity/assay reportable range and stability studies, were
evaluated in K150041.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:

--- Page 9 ---
The CK-LY30 precision study was conducted using sodium citrated whole blood
collected from three normal donors. Three sample types (no tPA, low tPA, high tPA)
were made for each donor. A tPA working solution was used to create a low tPA
blood sample with approximately 5% lysis and a high tPA blood sample with
approximately 22% lysis. Testing was performed in 12 replicates per sample by three
operators, using three reagent lots and 12 analyzers for five days. The mean, standard
deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (%CV) of each set of CK-LY30 values
were calculated for each donor per sample (no tPA, low tPA, high tPA) per day. The
determination of acceptability was based on the SD or %CV.

The reproducibility study was conducted with three normal donors, three lots of
cartridges on 36 instruments where all three cartridge lots were used on each
instrument. Three sample types (no tPA, low tPA, high tPA) were made for each
donor, where six runs per sample type and two replicates per run were performed for
five days. To demonstrate precision performance for each sample per donor (no tPA,
low tPA, high tPA), the mean, SD and %CV for each component of variability were
calculated including: within-run, between-operator, between-lot, between-day and
total reproducibility. The determination of acceptability was based on the SD or

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The analytical measurement range for the CK-LY30 parameter is 0–22% as
determined in this premarket notification, based on the data collected in method
comparison study. The ranges for the CK-R, CRT-MA and CFF-MA parameters were
established in K150041 (shown in the table below).
Assay Parameter Analytical Measurement
Range
CK R (min) 0.4-17
LY30 (percent) 0-22
CRT MA (mm) 40-75
CFF MA (mm) 4-52
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Shelf-life Stability of TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge:
To support the shelf-life stability of the TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge,
normal donor samples were tested on three different lots of aged cartridges
(previously manufactured production lots at 8–10 months, 15–16 months and greater
than 25 months) compared to one freshly manufactured lot. At each time period, 15
samples (3 lots, 5 per lot) were tested using a single instrument. The study data
support a 24-month shelf-life stability claim for the CK-LY30 parameter when the
TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge is stored at 2–8°C.
In-Use Stability of TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge:
Three lots of TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge, at three different time
points (0, 2 and 4 hours) were evaluated to support the in-use stability of the TEG 6s
Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge. Sodium citrated whole blood from normal
donors were used and tested on 30 cartridges (per time point per lot), for a total of 90
samples per lot using a single instrument. The assays were tested with different fresh
normal donor blood at different storage times. The results from each assay were
compared with their corresponding reference ranges. The data support a 2-hour in-use
stability claim at room temperature.
Transport Stability of TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge:
The transport simulation study was performed on three lots of TEG 6s Citrated: K,
RT, FF Assay Cartridge to simulate transport under stressed conditions. To create the
stressed condition, three cartridge lots were stored at 25°C for 24 hours then placed
into four different temperature cycles (temperature ranging from 22–35°C) with
variation of times (4 hours to 192 hours). The donor sample was collected in sodium
citrate anticoagulant and tested with stressed cartridges and non-stressed cartridges
(stored at 2–8°C). The study showed that there was no difference between stressed
and non-stressed conditions and the data supported the 7-day stability claim at 22–
35°C.

Sample Stability:
In order to assess sample stability, five consecutive runs of each of three patient
samples (normal, hypo- and hypercoagulable) were tested. Blood samples were tested
in quadruplicate at each time point demonstrating no significant sample deterioration
within 2 hours after sample collection.
Expected Values for Controls:
Normal Control: The manufacturer does not provide external normal controls for the
TEG 6s Citrated K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge. The manufacturer recommends that
laboratories establish their own donor normal controls and may consider the
following when establishing control donor groups:
• In accordance with the specimen collection and handling instructions
provided in the labeling, collect whole blood from healthy adult donors.
• The normal donor should not have taken any medication that is known to
affect coagulation and should have prior Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay
Cartridge tests that have fallen within the established normal reference
range.
Abnormal control: The manufacturer provides an abnormal QC kit (AQC (abnormal
QC), bovine plasma based and LQC (lysis QC), tPA activator). To establish the
control reference ranges, three lots of AQC and LQC control material were evaluated
including both fresh samples and aged samples (samples challenged with elevated
temperatures to stimulate storage lifetime), using two different lots of cartridges, on
two different diluent water volumes to stimulate the boundary conditions of the water
volume specification. These samples were tested the at two different in-use conditions
(one was immediately after reconstitution (15 minutes), the other was 2 hours after
reconstitution), at two different sites, with three replicates per testing point. Testing
was performed on six analyzers by six operators, over three days, for a total of 216
data points collected. The expected values for the AQC and LQC were established
using the non-parametric method, two-sided 95% CI as recommended in CLSI C28-
A3c guideline.
Expected Values for Abnormal QC:
Parameter
Assay R MA LY30
(min) (mm) (%)
CK 0.7–2.7 0.0–0.0
CRT 35–51
CFF 35–51

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was conducted using one lot of TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF
Assay Cartridge on a single instrument. In this study, one sodium citrated whole
blood donor was used to prepare samples with prescribed drugs such as direct oral
anticoagulants (FXa and direct thrombin inhibitors: dabigatran, lovenox and
rivaroxaban) and antiplatelet drugs (P2Y12 inhibitors: aspirin and ticagrelor). Five
concentration levels (including control) were tested in triplicate for each interferent
with and without tPA. Hemolyzed and hemodilution samples were also tested in the
study. For hemolysis testing, the donor blood was pooled and split into two aliquots
(one of which was treated with deionized water to generate hemolyzed condition) and
comparing hemolyzed sample vs non-hemolyzed sample. A control sample was tested
with each condition in which the blood was not treated with the potential interferent.
The study was evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP07-A2. The study found that
hemolysis and hemodilution above 30% interfere with the CRT-MA parameter and
hemodilution above 40% interferes with the CFF-MA parameter.
The following exogenous interfering substances were evaluated and showed no
significant interference up to the specified concentration in whole blood samples
collected in 3.2% sodium citrate anticoagulant collection tubes.
Exogenous Substances

admission and used for method comparison. The Injury Severity Score (ISS1,2,3,4) was
assessed on 371 subjects when all diagnostic procedures have been completed. There
was 97.84% of total subjects (363/371) confirmed with an ISS score greater than or
equal to one. These ISS scored subjects were categorized into 4 trauma groups: very
severe, serve, moderate and minor. The very severe trauma group consisted of 20% of
the total patients in method comparison and had the ISS ≥ 25. The severe trauma
group consisted of 18% of total patients and had the ISS >15 and ≤24. The moderate
trauma group consisted of 25% of total patients and had the ISS >8 and ≤15. The
minor trauma group consisted of 37% of total patients and had the ISS <8. Up to 10%
contrived samples were added (blood samples from normal healthy donors were
spiked with dabigatran and ReoPro to create hypocoagulable values for CK-R, CK-
MA and CFF-MA and tPA was used to create low and high lysis) in the study.
Passing-Bablok regression analysis and Bland-Altman Plot were performed. The
regression analysis of all sites combined was summarized below.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The design of the TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge is identical to the design
of the TEG 6s Citrated Multichannel Cartridge: K, KH, RT, FF Assay Cartridge
(formerly named the Citrated Multichannel Cartridge), cleared in K150041. Both
cartridges also contain the same reagents. The difference between assay cartridges is the
exclusion of the Citrated Kaolin with Heparinase (CKH) assay channel and the addition
of the CK-LY30 parameter in the CK Assay for the TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay
Cartridge (subject device cartridge). Therefore, CK-LY30 was the only parameter
evaluated for the reference range study. The reference ranges for the CRT-MA, CFF-MA
and CK-R parameters were established in K150041 (shown in the table below).
The CK-LY30 reference range was established according to CLSI C28-A3c from 132
apparently healthy individuals (58 males and 74 female), greater than 18 years old with
no current or recent history of a bleeding disorder or unexpected extended bleeding
episodes at three clinical sites in the U.S. Results from all sites were pooled and reference
interval was established by calculating the non-parametric 95% confidence interval (2.5th
to 97.5th percentiles). The calculated reference range for CK-LY30 is 0% to 2.6%.

3. Specimen Identification:
Manual patient identification entry
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Samples are collected in 3.2% sodium citrate anticoagulant collection tubes. No further
additives or preservatives are necessary to maintain the integrity of the sample, but
samples must be used within two hours of draw to maintain in-use stability. The blood is
applied to the sample port and is pulled into the three channels, mixed with dried reagents
before transfer to the test cells.
5. Calibration:
The TEG 6s Hemostasis analyzer is factory calibrated and does not require routine
calibration by the operator.
6. Quality Control:
The TEG 6s Hemostasis System performs internal QC checks during a pretest when the
cartridge is inserted. The internal QC check verifies that all electromechanical and
pneumatic functions of the analyzer-cartridge combination are operating satisfactorily.
The manufacturer recommends that laboratories develop a quality control plan and
perform two levels of QC testing (normal and abnormal) on each new shipment of
cartridges to ensure that cartridges have not been mishandled between production and
arrival at the lab, or have not been subject to adverse environmental conditions or
otherwise mishandled while in storage. Additional QC checks may be performed on a
monthly, weekly, daily or shift basis based on the laboratory’s quality control policies.
