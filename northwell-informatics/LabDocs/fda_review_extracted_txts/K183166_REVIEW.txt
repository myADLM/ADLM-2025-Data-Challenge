4. Special instrument requirements:
BacT/ALERT (BTA) 3D Microbial Detection System or BTA VIRTUO Microbial
Detection System
I. Device Description:
The BacT/ALERT Microbial Detection System and BTA VIRTUO Microbial Detection
System provide both a microbial detection system and a culture medium bottle with
suitable nutritional and environmental conditions for microorganisms commonly
encountered in blood taken from a patient suspected of having bacteremia/fungemia. The
BacT/ALERT FA Plus and BacT/ALERT PF Plus culture media formulation was
adjusted to add essential elements and to remove non-essential trace components.
For both the BacT/ALERT PF Plus and BacT/ALERT FA Plus culture bottles, an inoculated
bottle is placed into the instrument where it is incubated and continuously monitored for the
presence of microorganisms that will grow in the culture bottles.
The BacT/ALERT Microbial Detection System and BTA VIRTUO Microbial Detection
System utilize a colorimetric sensor and reflected light to monitor the presence and
production of carbon dioxide (CO ) that is dissolved in the culture medium. If
2
microorganisms are present in the test sample, carbon dioxide is produced as the
microorganisms metabolize the substrates in the culture medium. When growth of the
2

--- Page 3 ---
microorganisms produces CO , the color of the gas-permeable sensor installed in the bottom
2
of each culture bottle changes from blue-green to yellow. The lighter color results in an
increase of reflectance units monitored by the system. Bottle reflectance is monitored and
recorded by the instrument every 10 minutes.

L. Test Principle:
The BacT/ALERT Microbial Detection System and BTA VIRTUO Microbial Detection
Systems utilize a colorimetric sensor and reflected light to monitor the prescence and
production of carbon dioxide (CO ) dissolved in the culture medium. If
2
microorganisms are present in the test sample, carbon dioxide is produced as the
microorganisms metabolizee the substrates in the culture medium. When growth of the
microorganisms produces CO , the color of the gas-permeable sensor installed in thebottom
2
of each culture bottle changes from blue-green to yellow. The ligher color results in an
increase of reflectance units monitored by the system. Bottle reflectance is monitored by
the system. Bottle reflectance is monitored and recorded by the instrument every 10
minutes.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Antimicrobial neutralization
An internal study was conducted to demonstrate that the adjusted media formulation does not
impact the rate of recovery (percent) of microorganisms in the presence of antimicrobials. At
least one antimicrobial agent from each class claimed in the FA Plus culture bottle package
insert was evaluated in this study. Single agents and combinations of antimicrobials, in
clinically relevant concentrations, were added to FA Plus bottles with the susceptible aerobic
and facultative anaerobic microorganisms listed in Table 1 and Table 2. The targeted
inoculum for each microorganism was 10-100 CFU/bottle. The actual inoculum ranged from
15 CFU/bottle to 109 CFU/bottle. All organisms were added to FA Plus bottles that were
supplemented with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to simulate a challenging environment
with limited nutrients and high antimicrobial bioavailability. In addition, a subset of
organisms were added to bottles supplemented with blood. Adjusted BTA FA Plus bottles
were tested on both the BTA 3D and BTA VIRTUO Microbial Detection Systems. The
effectiveness of the antimicrobials was confirmed by parallel testing using a non-neutralizing
medium as a control.
Antimicrobial neutralization was evaluated with at least three lots of adjusted FA Plus culture
bottles for each tested microorganism/antimicrobial. For each microorganism/antimicrobial,
at least six bottles were inoculated and tested on the BTA 3D or the BTA VIRTUO. Testing
of all antimicrobials was evaluated at 100% Peak Serum Level (PSL), unless otherwise
noted. Antimicrobials were considered effectively neutralized by the adjusted FA Plus bottle
based on 100% recovery of the microorganisms tested at the indicated percent of PSL tested.
The study demonstrated that antimicrobials from the following categories were neutralized
by the adjusted FA Plus media, resulting in a positive bottle signal (as expected) within five
days of inoculation: penicillins, glycylcyclines, polyenes, macrolides, triazoles,
aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones.

Antimicrobial neutralization was also achieved for ceftaroline.
Antimicrobial neutralization was not achieved for S. aureus with the following single and
combinations of antimicrobials: Cefoxitin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Vancomycin +
Piperacillin/Tazobactam, and Daptomycin + Piperacillin /Tazobactam. In addition,
antimicrobial neutralization was not achieved for C. albicans grown in the presence of
Caspofungin, an echinocandin. Based on the C. albicans/Caspofungin result, follow up
testing was conducted with five additional echinocandin/yeast pairs. All additional
echinocandin/yeast pairs demonstrated 100% microorganism recovery.
Less than complete neutralization was observed for cefazolin. Cefazolin was neutralized at
50% PSL for E. coli in PBS.
Antimicrobial neutralization study results are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2 for single
and combinations of antimicrobial agents, respectively. Table 3 illustrates results of follow
up testing with additional echinocandin/yeast pairs.

Delayed Entry
An internal study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a delay, from the time the adjusted
FA Plus culture bottle was inoculated, to the time the bottle was placed on the instrument.
This seeded study was conducted using three lots of adjusted FA Plus culture bottles. Three
replicate suspensions of each of the following 11 species were evaluated: Staphylococcus
aureus, Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae,
Enterococcus faecium, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Target
concentrations of <100 CFU per bottle (actual inoculum levels from 16 CFU/bottle to 97
CFU/bottle) were prepared in 0, 4, and 10 mL human blood. Testing in the absence of blood
was performed to simulate the worst case scenario for normally sterile body fluids. Four and
ten mL blood represent the recommended fill volume for pediatric and adult bottles,
respectively. Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis were inoculated into bottles
supplemented with 1, 4, 10 or 4 and 10 mL blood, respectively. Haemophilus influenzae and
Neisseria meningitidis were only inoculated with blood added due to growth requirements.
Sixty negative controls (i.e., bottles containing blood and media alone without organism)
were evaluated on both the BTA 3D and BTA VIRTUO instruments. All samples were held
at the specified temperatures and times prior to loading into the BTA 3D or BTA VIRTUO
instruments. Percent recovery reflects time to positive flag by the instrument.
The study demonstrated that all delayed entry conditions showed >100% percent recovery of

the species were tested with the addition of antimicrobial agents: Escherichia coli –
Amikacin (30 µg/mL), Pseudomonas aeruginosa – Pipercillin (400 µg/mL), and
Staphylococcus aureus – Vancomycin (50 µg/mL). All species were seeded into adjusted FA
Plus bottles at a target inoculum of <100 CFU/bottle (actual inoculum from 16 CFU/bottle to
109 CFU/bottle).. Percent recovery reflects positive flag by the instrument and sub-culture
consistent with the appopriate seeded organism. Mean TTD reflects the average time to
detection for all evaluated microorganisms, combined. The study demonstrated that percent
recovery was 100% for yeast and bacteria with and without blood supplementation (Table
5a). Percent recovery was not affected by adjusted FA Plus bottle lot.

b. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
External QC Testing
During the analytical studies, daily external quality control was conducted on the
BTA 3D system and included positive and negative control bottles. Control
organisms were seeded into bottles at target inoculum levels of 10-100 CFU/bottle,
with actual inoculums ranging from 36 CFU/bottle to 91 CFU/bottle. Organism
concentrations for bottle seeding were confirmed by plate counting procedures. One
obligate aerobe (P. aeruginosa) and two facultative organisms (E. coli and S. aureus)
were evaluated. On each testing day, at least two quality control organisms were
evaluated. In addition, uninoculated negative control bottles were tested daily. 100%
of positive controls generated the expected positive signal by BTA 3D and 100% of
negative controls were reported as negative.
Stability of the adjusted BTA FA Plus bottle (shelf-life)
Studies were conducted to determine the adjusted FA Plus bottle shelf-life. Three lots
of adjusted FA Plus bottles produced for product validation and verification were
tested until they were 13 months old. At the beginning of the study, a set of adjusted
FA Plus bottles were stored under normal conditions (15-30ºC) while another set of
bottles were thermally stressed before final storage under normal conditions. At each
time point, growth performance (% recovery and TTD), antimicrobial neutralization,

and physical parameters were evaluated on the BTA 3D system. In addition, FA Plus
bottles were evaluated to determine if they possessed sufficient vacuum to direct draw
10 ml blood. These studies demonstrated that stability can be achieved for the
claimed shelf-life and that direct blood draw was maintained over the claimed shelf-
life.
c. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection (LoD)
An in-house LoD study was conducted with seeded samples to evaluate/confirm the
LoD of the microorganisms in the adjusted FA Plus bottle based on the established
LoD of the original bottle. All microorganisms were inoculated into adjusted FA Plus
Bottles at specific organism concentrations based on the LoD of the predicate FA
Plus bottle and different bottles were incubated on the BTA 3D and BTA VIRTUO
Systems. Due to inherent inaccuracy in preparing suspensions of microorganisms at a
low density, inoculum levels were deemed acceptable if they were within a factor of 2
(+2-fold) of the previously established LoD for each detection system. The following
11 species were tested on the BTA 3D System: Candida albicans, Klebsiella
(Enterococcus) aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus
influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus
pneumoniae. Of the species evaluated on the BTA 3D System, all were tested on the
BTA Virtuo System , except for Klebsiella (Enterococcus) aerogenes, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella enterica. Three production lots
of adjusted FA Plus Bottles were tested. A minimum of 60 bottles were tested for
each species on each detection system. LoD was determined in the absence of blood
for all organisms except H. influenzae, which was supplemented with 4 mL human
blood due to growth requirements. At least 95% detection was achieved at the
established LoD for all evaluated species, indicating that the LoD was the same in the
adjusted and predicate FA Plus bottles.
Percent Recovery (Detection) Study
An in-house seeded study was conducted to demonstrate that changes to the media
formulation do not negatively impact percent recovery (detection). Percent recovery
was evaluated in a head-to-head study of 2372 adjusted and predicate bottles, of
which 1564 were supplemented with human blood (4 or 10 mL) and 808 without
blood. A set of 39 diverse microorganisms commonly found in blood were evaluated
using three lots of the adjusted FA Plus bottle (a total of five different lots were
tested) and two lots of the predicate. The species tested are listed in Table 6d. All
organisms were seeded into adjusted FA Plus bottles at a target inoculum range of 10-
100 CFU/bottle (actual inoculum ranged from 3 CFU/bottle to 137 CFU/bottle).
Seeded bottles were incubated on the BTA 3D and BTA VIRTUO Systems.
The adjusted FA Plus bottle was considered equivalent to the predicate based on the
the Newcombe’s Hybrid Score CI of the percent recovery difference of the adjusted
13

--- Page 14 ---
bottle compared to the predicate bottle.
The overall detection rate was 96.0% for the predicate bottle and 95.7% for the
adjusted bottle, with an overall difference in percent recovery of 0.3%. Results are
shown in shown in Table 6a, stratified by inoculum level/blood content, and Table
6b, stratified by Detection System. Percent recovery results by adjusted bottle lot are
illustrated in Table 6c.

The study demonstrated that the adjusted bottle performed equivalently when
compared to the predicate bottle for all evaluated incolulum levels and blood
volumes, except for an inoculum of >100 CFU/bottle in the absence of blood. For this
condition, the detection rate was 94.6% for the predicate bottle and 80.8% for the
adjusted bottle, with a difference in percent recovery of 13.8%. It was noted that for
this condition, all adjusted bottles (n = 18) incoculated with A. defectiva yielded
negative results. Excluding A. defectiva from the analysis, Newcombe’s Hybrid Score
CI of the percent recovery difference between the adjusted and predicate FA Plus
bottle met the acceptance criteria for equivalence. A note has been added to the
adjusted FA Plus Package Insert indicating that detection of A. defectiva necessitates
blood.
In the adjusted bottle, percent recovery of bottles inoculated with H. parainfluenzae
(with blood supplementation) was 58% and percent recovery for C. hominis (without
blood supplementation) was 50%. These results are consistent with what has
previously been observed for these organisms/conditions and is reported in the
predicate bottle Package Insert. The following notes have been maintained in the
adjusted FA Plus bottle Package Insert.

In the adjusted bottle, without blood supplementation, less than 100% recovery was
observed for the fastidious organisms N.gonorrhoea, N.menigitidis, C. jeikeium, H.
influenzae, and H. parainfluenzae. These results are consistent with results for these
organisms grown in the predicate bottle without blood supplementation and denoted
in the predicate Package Insert. A limitation that recovery of fastidious organisms
requires blood supplementation has been maintained in the adjusted FA Plus Package
Insert.
The adjusted bottle was found to be equivalent to the predicate when read on either
the BTA 3D or BTA VIRTUO Systems. Percent recovery was not affected by the

Time-To-Detection (TTD) Study
An in-house seeded study was conducted to demonstrate that changes to the media
formulation do not negatively impact Time-To-Detection (TTD). TTD (in hours), was
evaluated in a head-to-head study of 2372 adjusted and predicate bottles, of which
1564 were supplemented with blood (4 or 10 mL) and 808 without blood. A set of 39
diverse species commonly found in blood were evaluated using three lots of the
adjusted FA Plus bottle (five lots in total were tested) and two lots of the predicate.
The species tested are the same as those listed in Table 6d, above. All organisms
were seeded into adjusted FA Plus bottles at a target inoculum of 10-100 CFU/bottle.
The actual inoculum ranged from 3 CFU/bottle to 137 CFU/bottle. Seeded bottles
were read on the BTA 3D and BTA VIRTUO Systems.
To demonstrate equivalence, the mean difference in TTD between the adjusted and
predicate bottle was calculated. For all microorganisms, the following criteria were
used to assess equivalence: (i) for organisms with TTDs of < 10 hours in the predicate
bottle, the mean difference in TTD should be < 1 hour; (ii) for organisms with TTDs
>10 hours in the predicate bottle, the mean difference should be within 10% of the
predicate bottle TTD.
The overall TTD was 25.7 hours for the predicate bottle and 21.8 hours for the
adjusted bottle, with an overall mean difference in TTD of 3.9 hours (Table 7a).
Results are shown in shown in Table 7a, stratified by inoculum level/blood content
and Table 7b, stratified by Detection System. TTD by adjusted bottle lot is shown in
Table 7c.

a Bottles where growth was not detected do not have TTD data, and were removed
from analysis
The study demonstrated that the adjusted bottle performed equivalently when
compared to the predicate bottle for all evaluated incolulum levels and blood
volumes. The adjusted bottle was found to be equivalent to the predicate when read
on either the BTA 3D or BTA VIRTUO Systems. TTD was not affected by the
adjusted bottle lot.
When stratified by species, it was noted that the TTD for 38 of the 39 species
evaluated in the adjusted FA Plus bottle, in the presence of blood, met the criteria for
equivalency to the predicate bottle. In the presence of 4 mL blood, H. influenzae and
H. parainfluenzae had a mean TTD delay of 1.7 and 32.1 hours, respectively, in the
adjusted bottle. A note in the adjusted FA Plus Package Insert states that H.
parainfluenzae is not always detected in the presence of blood, and was therefore
found to be equivalent. In the presence of blood (4 and 10 mL), faster TTD was
achieved for C. glabrata, with a mean TTD improvement of >30 hours. Of note, the
following species had a faster mean TTD when supplemented with 10 mL blood in
the adjusted bottle: A. baumannii (5 hours), C. albicans (2.4 hours), K. aerogenes (2.8
hours), E. cloacae (5.7 hours), M. luteus (5.9 hours), S. enterica (4.3 hours), S.
flexneri (10.9 hours).
The TTD for 32 out of 34 species evaluated in the adjusted bottle, in the absence of
blood, met the criteria for equivalency to the predicate bottle. In the absence of blood,
S. aureus and S. pneumoniae had a mean TTD delay of 1.7 hours and 5 hours,
respectively, when tested in the adjusted bottle. Of note, C. albicans and C glabrata
had a faster mean TTD of 3.6 hours and 36.6 hours, respectively, when tested in the
adjusted bottle.
