SPECIAL 510(K): DEVICE MODIFICATION
OIR DECISION SUMMARY
510(k) Number: K183223
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the applicant’s own class
II or class I devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable.
1. The name and 510(k) number of the applicant’s previously cleared device.
510(k) Number Device Name Clearance Date
K173498 Simplexa Bordetella Direct 08/13/18
2. Applicant’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as
described in its labeling HAS CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes
instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials
(labeling changes are permitted as long as they do not affect the intended use).
This change was for the removal of the frozen specimen limitation.
3. There were no device MODIFICATION(S) made. Since no modifications were made, sufficient
detail to demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the device
has not changed.
4. Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to applicant’s legally marketed predicate
device including, labeling, intended use, physical characteristics, and comparison studies.
There were no changes to the device other than labeling for sample type as shown in Table 1.
Justification for the added sample type is displayed in Table 2. Briefly, four hundred and sixty
samples were prospectively collected from 5 sites from 14 MAY 2018 to 10 OCT 2018. Three
samples were discarded for being handled outside of the Instructions for Use. Another 88 samples
were discarded for various other disqualifying situations. The remaining 369 samples were tested
with the investigational Simplexa Bordetella Direct assay and the Quidel AmpliVue as a reference
method. The results of fresh sample testing for B. pertussis are presented in the table below.

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended
use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the applicant’s description of the
particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified
devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The applicant has
provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I
recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their
preamendment) device.
