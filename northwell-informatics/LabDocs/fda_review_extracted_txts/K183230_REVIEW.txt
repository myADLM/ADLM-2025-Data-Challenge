I. Device Description:
The OneDraw A1C Test System includes the OneDraw Blood Collection Device and the
OneDraw A1C Test. The OneDraw Blood Collection Device is a single-use, sterile, capillary
blood specimen collection, stabilization and transportation system that uses a combination of
two mechanisms, capillary action, and vacuum extraction. The device incorporates lancets to
make two small incisions in the skin of the upper arm and a vacuum to draw 150 µL blood at
the surface of the skin and through channels to deposit the blood onto two collection and
stabilization matrix strips The base of the device includes a release liner that covers a ring of
hydrogel adhesive. The adhesive seals to the skin and holds the device in place during use. A
vacuum is created when the user pushes button I, then the user releases the spring that
activates two lancets by pushing button II. The OneDraw Blood Collection Device includes a
collection device loaded with a sample collection cartridge, a transport sleeve, accessories
(alcohol prep pad, gauze pad, bandage), and instructions needed to collect, package, and mail
the sample collection cartridge to the designated certified clinical laboratory for HbA1c
testing.
The healthcare professional follows the directions in the OneDraw Blood Collection Device
instructions for use to collect a blood sample, then packages and mails the sample to a
2

designated clinical laboratory for analysis. Once the cassette is received in the designated
clinical laboratory, one of the sample matrix strips is removed from the OneDraw Blood
Collection Device, eluted with the Beckman HbA1c Hemolyzing Reagent, and tested using
FDA-cleared A1c reagents on the Beckman Coulter AU480 Chemistry Analyzer (k120199)
according to the OneDraw A1C Test instructions for use.

L. Test Principle:
The OneDraw Blood A1C Test System is intended to collect capillary blood from the upper
arm of adults (18 years of age and older) by a healthcare worker for HbA1c testing in a
designated laboratory. The OneDraw Blood Collection Device has a mechanism for skin
puncture, a mechanism for drawing blood, a mechanism for stabilizing the blood sample, and
can be used for temporary storage and shipping of blood. The OneDraw Blood Collection
Device uses two stainless steel lancets to create skin punctures for the collection of capillary
blood. When actuated, the device collects the blood sample (150µL) via vacuum draw onto
two collection and stabilization matrix strips, and provides an indicator to confirm that
collection is complete. The user removes the cartridge from the collection device and inserts
it into the transport sleeve prior to shipping of the sample. The OneDraw Blood Collection
Device is designed for one-time sample extraction. Once the dried blood sample is received
by the designated laboratory, one matrix strip is removed from the sample cartridge by
trained professionals using forceps and eluted with Beckman HbA1c Hemolyzing Reagent
(k120199). Once eluted, the sample is assayed using FDA-cleared A1c reagents on the
Beckman Coulter AU480 Chemistry analyzer.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed based on CLSI EP05-A3. Four levels of K2 EDTA
venous blood samples (5%, 6.5%, 8%, 12%) were spotted onto OneDraw Blood
Collection Device matrix strips, then processed and analyzed at the designated
laboratory according to the OneDraw A1C Test instructions for use. Samples were
run by one operator in duplicate for 20 days (21 days for the low sample), two runs
per day, on one Beckman AU480 analyzer for a total of 80-84 measurements per
sample. One lot of Hemolyzing Reagent and two lots of HbA1c Reagent were used.

site is shown below. Three healthcare providers collected two to three upper arm
capillary blood samples from each of 25 participants using OneDraw Blood
Collection Devices from a single lot for each participant (three collection device lots
total) for a total of 71 collections. Samples were shipped to the designated laboratory
where they were eluted and tested according to the OneDraw A1C Test instructions
for use. %HbA1c values tested ranged from 4.66% to 14.38%.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was conducted to establish the linear range of the OneDraw HbA1c
Test System. The sponsor evaluated 107 capillary blood samples collected with the
OneDraw Blood Collection Device as well as seven additional K2 EDTA venous
blood samples obtained commercially and spotted onto the matrix strips. The sponsor
provided data to support that venous blood samples did not behave differently from
capillary blood samples from the upper arm in this study. The samples covered a
range of 4.76 – 14.7% HbA1c. Samples were eluted and measured in singlicate on the
Beckman Coulter AU480 analyzer at the designated laboratory according to the
OneDraw A1C Test instructions for use and the results were compared to results from
matched liquid K2 EDTA venous blood samples measured using A1c reagents on the
Beckman Coulter AU480 analyzer (k120199). A Deming regression was calculated
with the following results: Y = 1.01x + 0.06; R2=0.99.
The study supports the sponsor’s claimed measuring range of 4.7 – 14.3%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The OneDraw A1C Test System has been certified by the National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP) and the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial
(DCCT). The NGSP certification expires in one year. See NGSP website for current
certification at http://www.ngsp.org. The OneDraw HbA1c Test System is traceable
to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine
(IFCC) Reference Method for Measurement of HbA1c.
Sample stability
Sample stability study at room temperature of sterilized OneDraw Blood Collection
Devices was conducted. The matrix strips were spotted with K2 EDTA venous blood

from four donors (5.3, 6.4, 7.9, 11.5% HbA1c) and extracted/tested within 30 minutes
and at various time points after storage at room temperature up to 21 days. At each
time point, samples were compared to test results obtained with fresh samples. The
results of the study support the labeling claim of 21 days of room temperature
stability for blood samples collected with the OneDraw Blood Collection Device.
Shelf Life
1. Real-time shelf life stability studies of upper arm capillary blood collection,
storage, and HbA1c analysis using aged OneDraw Blood Collection Devices are
ongoing. Stability protocols and acceptance criteria for these studies were
reviewed and found acceptable to support an initial shelf life claim of 18 months
when stored at the recommended storage temperatures of 15°C-25°C (59°F-77°F).
2. OneDraw Blood Collection Devices (packaged and sterilized) were subjected to
accelerated and ongoing real time stability studies. Stability protocols and
acceptance criteria for these studies were reviewed and found acceptable to
support a shelf life claim of 18 months when stored at the recommended storage
temperatures of 15°C-25°C (59°F-77°F).
3. The sponsor evaluated the impact of holding the spring that deploys the lancets in
a compressed state over time. New (i.e., never installed) and aged springs were
subjected to compression testing. The results of this study support the claimed
shelf life of 18 months when stored at the recommended storage temperatures of
15°C-25°C (59°F-77°F).
Shipping
Several stability studies were conducted to assess the performance of the OneDraw
A1C Test System to collect and measure quality samples after undergoing simulated
extreme shipping and distribution conditions (extreme cold, extreme heat, extreme
humidity). Real-time shipping studies are ongoing. The shipping stability study
protocols and acceptance criteria of the OneDraw A1C Test System were reviewed
and found to be acceptable. The study results support the manufacturer’s claim that
the OneDraw A1C Test System can perform as indicated following shipping of the
packaged OneDraw Blood Collection Devices.
Additional bench testing evaluated on the candidate device:
The sponsor conducted additional studies to assess the OneDraw Blood Collection
Device malfunction rate as well as the effect of draw volume, sample collection time,
hematocrit interference, and equivalence of the two matrix strips on OneDraw A1C
Test System performance. Results for these studies were reviewed and found to be
acceptable.

d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection for the OneDraw HbA1c assay is based on the Beckman
HbA1c reagents on the AU480 analyzer (cleared in k120199).
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous and exogenous interference was evaluated using K2 EDTA venous
whole blood at two %HbA1c levels (~5%) and high (~10%) spiked with the
potentially interfering substances. Each sample and an un-spiked control was spotted
onto OneDraw Blood Collection Device matrix strips and then eluted and tested per
the OneDraw A1C Test instructions for use. Six replicates were tested. Results for
spiked samples were compared to the results from control samples. The sponsor
defined significant interference as > 10% difference between spiked and control
samples.

Hemoglobin Variant Interference
Interference from common hemoglobin variants (HbA2, HbC, HbD, HbE, HbS, HbF)
was evaluated based on CLSI EP07-A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry.
Four to ten K2 EDTA samples with varying levels of %HbA1c and hemoglobin
variants were spotted onto OneDraw Blood Collection Device matrix strips and
eluted and measured in replicates of five or six per the OneDraw A1C Test
instructions for use. Test results were compared to %HbA1c values obtained with an
FDA cleared comparator method free of interference from the respective hemoglobin
variant. The sponsor defined significant interference as bias > ±10%. The results of
the study support the sponsor’s claim that there is no significant interference from
hemoglobin variants HbA2 (≤ 5.8%), HbC (≤ 40.1%), HbD (≤ 41.2%), HbE (≤ 22%),
and HbS (≤ 34.8%). Samples containing HbF levels ≤ 8.5% show a significant
negative bias with the OneDraw HbA1c Test System.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was conducted at the designated laboratory. Two to four
healthcare professionals at two clinical sites collected 107 capillary blood samples
(4.76 – 14.7% HbA1c) with four lots of the OneDraw Blood Collection device.
Results obtained with capillary blood with the OneDraw A1C Test System were
compared to results from matched K2 EDTA venous blood samples using the same
Beckman Coulter HbA1c reagents on the Beckman Coulter AU480 analyzer
(k120199). All samples were tested in singlicate.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
In 2019, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended a reasonable A1c goal
for many non-pregnant adults is < 7 % (53 mmol/mol). Providers might reasonably
suggest more stringent A1C goals (such as 6.5 % [48 mmol/mol]) for selected individual
patients if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects
of treatment. Less stringent A1C goals (such as <8% [64 mmol/mol]) may be appropriate
for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced
microvascular o macrovascular complications, extensive comorbid conditions, or long-
standing diabetes in whom the goal is difficult to achieve despite diabetes self-
management education, appropriate glucose monitoring, and effective doses of multiple
glucose-lowering agents including insulin.1
