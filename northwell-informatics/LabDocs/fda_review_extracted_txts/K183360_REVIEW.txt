4. Special instrument requirements:
VITEK 2 Systems 9.02 (PC version) for all VITEK 2 Systems and VITEK 2 Compact
Systems
I. Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each
VITEK 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium
is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials
combined with the nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized
concentration with 0.45% to 0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial
medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System will automatically dilute the bacterial
suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then the VITEK 2 will fill, seal
and place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling,
sealing and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the
card over a defined period of time (up to 24 hours for Streptococcus species). The analysis
program determines when a well demonstrates growth based on attenuation of light measured
by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration
or “MIC” values for the anti-microbial agent. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a
report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for
each antimicrobial contained on the card.
AST-Gram Negative Meropenem/Vaborbactam has the following concentrations in the card:
0.5/8, 2/8, 8/8, and 32/8 µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in
µg/mL). The Meropenem/Vaborbactam Enterobacteriaceae MIC result range for the VITEK
2 is ≤0.5/8 ‒ ≥64/8 µg/mL .

L. Test Principle:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection
using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems uses
visible light to directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells.
Transmittance optics is based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth
has begun. Every 15 minutes throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based
on the VITEK 2 card), light transmittance readings of each well measures organism growth
by the amount of light that is prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of
the incubation period, the MIC values and their associated interpretive category results for
each antimicrobial on the test card are displayed in an automatically generated report.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study for the VITEK 2 AST-GN card with
Meropenem/Vaborbactam was conducted at three external clinical sites using a panel
of ten Enterobacteriaceae isolates from indicated species. Testing was performed on
three separate days and in triplicate for a total of 270 data points. The isolates tested
in the reproducibility study included one isolate each for E. coli and K. aerogenes,
and eight K. pneumoniae. Inocula were prepared using both the auto-dilution and
manual dilution methods for testing in the VITEK 2 System; inocula were prepared
by the manual dilution method only with the VITEK 2 Compact. The mode MIC
value was determined and the reproducibility was calculated based on MIC values
that fell within +/- one doubling dilution from the mode MIC value. The majority of

2. Comparison studies:
Testing of Meropenem/Vaborbactam on the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card was
performed at three external sites and one internal site. Results obtained with the
bioMérieux VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card with Meropenem/Vaborbactam were
compared to results obtained with the CLSI broth microdilution reference panel using
direct colony suspension inoculation. Reference panels were incubated at 35° C for 16 to
20 hours. The following concentrations of Meropenem/Vaborbactam are contained in the
VITEK 2 AST-GN test card: 0.5/8, 2/8, 8/8, and 32/8 µg/mL (equivalent standard method
concentration by efficacy in µg/mL). However, the reporting range is ≤ 0.5 – ≥64 μg/mL
for Enterobacteriaceae. The reference panel contained two-fold serial dilutions with a
range of ≤ 0.004 to ≥256 µg/mL. The testing conditions for the reference method
consisted of the following:
· Medium: Cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton Broth with appropriate dilutions of
antimicrobial solution added
· Inoculum: Direct colony suspension

--- Page 10 ---
· Incubation: 35ºC in ambient air for 16 ‒ 20 hours
All test inocula used for the evaluation of VITEK 2 AST-GN Meropenem/Vaborbactam
and the reference method were standardized using the DensiCHEK Plus instrument. The
cards were inoculated with each test organism by auto-dilution for reading by the VITEK
2 System and by manual dilution for reading on the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact
Systems. Reference broth microdilution panels were inoculated in adherence with CLSI
document, M07-A10.
A total of 331 clinical isolates were evaluated at three sites with VITEK 2 AST– Gram
Negative cards inoculated by automatic dilution and interpreted using the VITEK 2
instrument. All 331 isolates grew. There were 217 fresh (65.6%) and 114 stock (34.4%)
isolates. Of the 331 clinical isolates, 320 (96.7%) were indicated organisms.
A total of 118 challenge organisms were evaluated at one external site. All 118 challenge
isolates grew in the study. The challenge set was tested with the auto-dilution and manual
dilution options of the VITEK 2 System and with the manual dilution method on the
VITEK 2 Compact System.
The comparative study (both clinical and challenge) included 438 indicated
Enterobacteriaceae isolates. They were E. cloacae complex (50), E. coli (107), K.
pneumoniae (140), C. freundii (8), C. koseri (5), K. aerogenes (40), K. oxytoca (24), K.
pneumoniae ozaenae (1), M. morganii (10), P. mirabilis (25), Providencia spp. (7), and
S. marcescens (21).
Overall performance of the indicated isolates is shown in Table 4.1. There were eleven
non-indicated Enterobacteriaceae isolates tested in the comparative studies. The
performance comparison between the indicated isolates and all Enterobacteriaceae is
shown in Table 4.2 below and no performance difference is observed.

Enterobacteriaceae
The performance of the indicated Enterobacteriaceae was acceptable at 98.2% EA,
98.6% CA, with no maj or vmj discrepancies. There were eleven Enterobacteriaceae
isolates (2.4%, 11/449) that were not from the list of indicated species. No performance
differences were observed between the indicated species and all organisms within
Enterobacteriaceae. There were 33 meropenem/vaborbactam resistant isolates tested in
the comparative studies. They were E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates. A limitation was
included in the limitation section of the device labeling:
· The ability of the AST card to detect resistance with the following combination(s)
is unknown because resistant strains were either not available or an insufficient
number were encountered at the time of comparative testing:
Meropenem/Vaborbactam: E. cloacae complex, C. freundii, C. koseri, K.
aerogenes, K. oxytoca, M. morganii, P. mirabilis, Providencia spp., and S.
marcescens.
To address testing of non-indicated species the sponsor included the following statement
in the Precautions section of the device labeling:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the
safety and efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility
is tested by this AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate
and well-controlled clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to
microorganisms outside of those found in the indications and usage in the drug
label. The clinical significance of susceptibility information in those instances is
unknown. The approved labeling for specific antimicrobial drugs provides the
uses for which the antimicrobial drug is approved.
Challenge Data ‒ Auto and Manual Dilution
A challenge set of 118 Enterobacteriaceae isolates was at one external site. The
challenge set was tested with both the auto-dilution and manual dilution options of the
VITEK 2 System and with the manual dilution method on the VITEK 2 Compact System.
Overall performance is shown in Table 5.

The performance of the Meropenem/Vaborbactam test with the challenge isolates on
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems was acceptable.
MIC Trends
An analysis of trending was conducted using the combined clinical and challenge data for
each organism group. This trending calculation takes into account MIC values that are
determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or higher compared to the
reference method irrespective of whether the device MIC values are on-scale or not.
Results that are not clearly at least one dilution lower, at least one dilution higher or in
exact agreement with the CLSI reference method are not considered in the trending
analysis.
Trending results for overall indicated species and all species within Enterobacteriaceae
are shown in Table 6 and no trending was observed. In the analysis, results were stratified
by species to determine if species-related trends were observed. A difference of ≥30
between the percentage of a species with higher vs. lower readings and for which the
confidence interval was determined to be statistically significant was considered to show
evidence of trending. No species demonstrated significant trending.

Enzyme Group Characterization/Resistance Markers Information
Resistance markers for indicated Enterobacteriaceae isolates were provided in the
submission. They consisted mostly of βeta-lactamases including AmpC (ACT/MIR,
hyper AmpC), ESBL/OSBL (CTX-M, TEM, SHV), carbapenemases (KPC, OXA, NDM,
VIM), porin mutation (OMPC, OMPK). The study showed that isolates with metallo-
βeta-lactamases (NDM, and/or VIM) carbapenemases were resistant to
