I. Device Description:
The GenePOC Strep A assay is a single-use test for qualitative detection of Streptococcus
pyogenes (group A Streptococcus-GAS) nucleic acids from throat swab specimens obtained
from patients with signs and symptoms of pharyngitis. The GenePOC Strep A assay kit is
comprised of the disposable microfluidic cartridge (PIE) with Strep A reagents, Sample
Buffer Tube (SBT), and Disposable Transfer Tool (DTT). These components are used to
suspend the sample, extract, amplify, and detect Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes)
nucleic acid.
A Process Control (PrC) is also incorporated into each PIE to verify sample processing and
amplification steps. The PrC allows for the verification of potential inhibitor substances as
well as microfluidic, instrument, or reagent failures. The GenePOC Strep A assay is designed
to be used on the revogene instrument, which automates sample homogenization, sample
dilution, cell lysis, DNA amplification, and detection of the amplified PCR products.
2

--- Page 3 ---
Each GenePOC Strep A assay kit provides components for twenty-four (24) tests. User
intervention is required for sample preparation, transferring throat swab specimen into the
SBT, using the DTT to transfer the sample into the PIE, and loading/unloading the PIE into
the revogene carousel. Each PIE is a completely integrated closed device in which a sample
is dispensed and processed through different microfluidic chambers and channels that allow
for the sample processing and subsequent real-time PCR steps.
Upon completion of a run, the results are computed by the revogene instrument from
measured fluorescent signals and embedded calculation algorithms. The possible output
results are: positive, negative, indeterminate, or unresolved results. The user removes the
used cartridges and disposes of them in normal biological waste. Results may be viewed,
printed, transferred, and/or stored by the user.

L. Test Principle:
The revogene automates and integrates nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and detection
of the target sequence in complex samples using real-time PCR. A throat swab specimen is
collected using a rayon tipped swab. The specimen is transferred into the SBT containing 1.5
ml of sample buffer, and the swab stem is broken. After a 15-second vortex step at maximal
speed, the inoculated sample buffer is transferred into the GenePOC Strep A PIE using the
DTT. The loaded GenePOC Strep A PIE is placed into the revogene for further sample
processing. No operator intervention is necessary once the PIE is loaded onto the revogene
instrument.
Each GenePOC Strep A PIE is a completely integrated and self-contained device. Each
sample is sequentially transferred by centrifugation from one microfluidic chamber to the
next and all reagents specific for the PCR reaction are incorporated and dried within the PCR
wells. The stepwise process includes sample homogenization, lysis of cells, sample dilution,
and DNA extraction followed by the subsequent real-time PCR steps within one PCR well in
the cartridge. An internal PrC is contained in the homogenization chamber and is therefore
present in every test to verify critical steps of the analytical process as well as system or
reagent failures. The amplified products are detected in real-time from measured fluorescent
signals and embedded calculation algorithms. Results may be viewed, printed, transferred,
and/or stored by the user using target-specific TaqManchemistry-based probes. An Early
Positive Result Outcome (E-PRO) feature provides positive results if the signal from the
target reaches a predetermined threshold before the full PCR cycles have been completed.
The results are computed by the system. Results may be viewed, printed, transferred, and/or
stored by the user.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Site-to-Site Reproducibility
The reproducibility of the GenePOC Strep A assay between sites was evaluated in a study
performed by two operators at each of three sites over a period of five days. Each
operator tested a blinded panel of S. pyogenes positive (two different levels based on
multiples of the LoD) and negative samples using the same lot of reagents. Ninety (90)
data points were collected for each positive panel member, and (120) data points were
collected for the negative panel member. The panels were prepared in Sample Buffer
5

--- Page 6 ---
(SB) using S. pyogenes-negative throat swab matrix and two S. pyogenes strains (ATCC
12344 and ATCC 19615). No differences in reproducibility between sites or operators
were observed for the panel members.
The results of the study demonstrated acceptable reproducibility from site-to-site at target
levels close to the limit of detection (LoD) of the assay (Table 1). No unresolved results
were observed in this study. Across the Reproducibility Study (site-to-site and within site
studies), eight samples were indeterminate (IND) for a rate of 1.6% (8/500). The samples
were repeated and yielded a reportable result after repeat for a final IND rate of 0%. Each
Positive External Control and Negative External Control tested during the
Reproducibility Study yielded the expected results.

by two operators who tested a panel of samples on a single revogene instrument over a
period of 20 days. Eighty (80) replicates were tested for each panel member. The panel
members were the same as those used in the Site-to-Site Reproducibility Study, above.
The results of the study demonstrated acceptable repeatability and precision from day-to-
day with target levels even close to the LoD of the assay (Table 2). One unresolved

A sample in which there is an amplification/detection failure of the PrC and the GAS
target DNA is reported as “Unresolved” (UNR) and must be re-tested.
External Controls
Two External Controls are to be prepared by the end user. GenePOC recommends using a
0.5 ± 0.05 McFarland suspension of a S. pyogenes commercially available strain (e.g.,
ATCC 12344) diluted 1/100 in saline as a Positive External Control and a 0.5 ± 0.05
McFarland suspension of a Streptococcus salivarius commercially available strain (e.g.,
ATCC 13419) as a Negative External Control. These are recommended, but not required,
to allow the user to select the most appropriate for their laboratory quality control
program.
Sample Stability in PIE
The GenePOC Strep A assay PIE (microfluidic cartridge) stability study was validated
using positive samples comprised of the S. pyogenes (GAS) strain ATCC 12344 (at 3X
LoD) and negative samples in presence of S. pyogenes-negative throat matrix. The study
was conducted using three (3) GenePOC Strep A kit lots, three (3) replicates of S.
pyogenes and negative samples (one replicate per kit lot), and five (5) revogene
instruments. Samples were tested across four (4) time points: 0 minutes (T0), 60 minutes
(T60), 120 minutes (T120), and 180 minutes (T180) to validate the PIE stability study at
25°C after opening the PIE pouch. No unresolved (UNR) samples were recorded in the
PIE stability study. One IND was observed for an initial IND rate of 2.8%; however, this
sample was repeated and yielded reportable results for a final 0% IND rate. The results of
the study support the recommended maximum interval of one hour from the opening of
the PIE pouch and sample addition into the GenePOC Strep A assay PIE to the
processing on the revogene instrument.
Specimen Stability
The stability of throat swab specimens collected with rayon swabs in Liquid Stuart
transport media was evaluated analytically with the GenePOC Strep A assay. The time
periods tested in this study were used to establish specimen stability between: i) throat
swab specimen collection and SBT inoculation and ii) SBT inoculation and loading of the
GenePOC Strep A PIE prior to initiation of the revogene run. The stability study was
conducted by testing positive samples comprised of the S. pyogenes (GAS) strain ATCC
12344 (3X LoD) and negative samples in the presence of S. pyogenes-negative throat
matrix. The cumulative shelf life stability (nested stability) corresponds to the period of
time from swab specimen collection up to the initiation of the revogene assay run. The
study included three (3) lots GenePOC Strep A assay kits. For each sample type (positive
or negative), and for each time point, a total of twelve (12) swabs were inoculated. Study
results support throat swab specimen storage at 25±2°C up to two (2) days or 2-8°C for
up to seven (7) days. SBT inoculated with throat swab specimens may be stored up to
three (3) days at 25±2°C or 2-8°C for up to seven (7) days prior testing with the
GenePOC Strep A assay.
Swab Specimen Stability-Various Swabs
This study was designed to evaluate the cumulative stability of throat swabs specimens

--- Page 9 ---
when collected and conserved with Rayon Liquid Amies, Polyester Liquid Stuart,
Polyester Liquid Amies and the inoculated SBT used with the GenePOC Strep A assay at
defined temperature of 25 ± 2°C and 2-8°C. The study was executed by testing S.
pyogenes strain ATCC 12344 at 3X LoD and negative samples in presence of S.
pyogenes-negative throat matrix in SB. The study included three (3) to four (4) lots
GenePOC Strep A assay kits for each type of swab. For each sample type (positive or
negative), and for each time point, a total of twelve (12) swabs were inoculated. Study
results support throat swab specimen stability for GenePOC Strep A assay at 25±2°C up
to two (2) days or 2-8°C for up to seven (7) days; SBT inoculated with throat swab
specimens may be stored up to three (3) days at 25±2°C or 2-8°C for up to seven (7) days
prior testing with the GenePOC Strep A assay, as confirmed with the rayon swab in
Liquid Amies transport media and Polyester swab in Liquid Stuart and Liquid Amies
transport media.
Reagent Stability
The shelf life of the GenePOC Strep A assay reagents was evaluated in a real-time
stability study performed on three lots of reagents that were stored under different
conditions. GenePOC claims a shelf life of 2 months.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection
The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the GenePOC Strep A assay was estimated for three
strains of S. pyogenes by testing various dilutions of enumerated cell stocks in S.
pyogenes-negative throat swab matrix. The LoD for each strain was then confirmed by
testing a further 20 replicates at the lowest target level that produced 100% positive
results. The LoD was defined as the lowest concentration tested at which ≥95% of assay
replicates produced positive results. For ATCC 19615, ATCC 12344, and ATCC 700942,
the LoD was determined to be 1.0 x 103 CFU/ml, 333 CFU/ml, and 1.3 x 103 CFU/ml,
respectively. No unresolved (UNR) results were obtained during the study. Eighteen (18)
out of 595 samples obtained IND results during the GenePOC Strep A assay LoD
determination study for an initial IND rate of 3.0%. These samples were repeated and all
yielded reportable results for a final IND rate of 0%.
Inclusivity (Analytical Reactivity)
The inclusivity of the GenePOC Strep A assay was evaluated by testing nine additional
strains of S. pyogenes in negative throat matrix (Table 4). Eight of the nine strains
produced 9/9 positive results at a concentration of 999 CFU/ml (3X the LoD for
ATCC12344). Strain ATCC 49399 gave one false negative result at this target level but
produced 9/9 positive results at 1.67 x 103 CFU/ml, equivalent to 5X LoD for ATCC
12344. These results are acceptable.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity Study
The analytical specificity of the GenePOC Strep A assay was evaluated by testing a 50-
member panel [(42) bacteria, (1) yeast, (6) viruses, (1) human gDNA] with organisms
that might be found in throat swab specimens (Table 5). Each panel member was tested
in triplicate in SB with S. pyogenes-negative throat matrix. Bacteria and yeast were tested
at ≥106 CFU/ml while viral nucleic acid and human gDNA samples were tested at a
concentration >105 cp/ml. No cross-reactivity was observed. No UNR were observed.
Three IND were produced for an initial IND rate of 1.9%; all repeats yielded valid
results. These study results are acceptable.

Bioinformatic Analysis
The in silico specificity of the GenePOC Strep A assay was validated through analysis of
the assay’s primers and probe sequences specific for the detection of S. pyogenes. The in
silico study suggested that non-specific amplifications or detection will not occur with the
primers and probe of the GenePOC Strep A assay used to target the S. pyogenes
sequence. The primers and probes have been proven to be specific to their respective
target following Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis. No target other
than S. pyogenes was found to have a significant level of homology with the S. pyogenes
primers and probe. In addition, it was concluded that the S. pyogenes target primers and
probe will not interact with the PrC sequence. Further, the PrC primers did not
demonstrate cross-reactivity with other organisms.
Contamination Study
The potential for false-positive results with the GenePOC Strep A assay due to within-run
or between-run cross contamination was evaluated by testing an alternating series of S.
pyogenes “high positive” and negative samples in successive instrument runs. The high
positive samples contained S. pyogenes at a concentration of 106 CFU/ml in the presence
of S. pyogenes-negative throat matrix. Negative samples comprised S. pyogenes-negative
throat matrix without GAS. The expected results were obtained for all S. pyogenes
positive and negative samples (40/40 each). No false positive results were detected in the
within-run cross-contamination study (n=80) or in the between-run carry-over study
(n=80). No UNR or IND results were obtained throughout the cross-contamination and
carry-over study. These results are acceptable.
f. Assay cut-off:
Thresholds and cut-offs for the GenePOC Strep A assay are embedded within the Assay
Definition File that also encodes the instrument settings required to perform the test. Both
native (throat swab specimens) and contrived samples were used to set the thresholds of
positivity and negativity of the GenePOC Strep A assay. The assay cut-off was
determined by testing n=509 native and contrived samples.

Potentially Interfering Substances
The potential for interference with the GenePOC Strep A assay was evaluated with (19)
endogenous and exogenous substances that may be present in throat swab specimens
(Table 6). Two (2) strains of S. pyogenes (ATCC 12344 and ATCC 19615) were tested at
a moderate load (3X LoD, 999 CFU/ml and 3000 CFU/ml of SB, respectively) in the
presence of potentially interfering substances and S. pyogenes-negative throat matrix.
Negative samples were also tested in the presence of potentially interfering substances to
evaluate the impact on the PrC. The potentially interfering substances were tested at the
highest concentration that may be encountered in a throat swab specimen. Results
demonstrated that Analgesic/Antipyretic (Tylenol), Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
(Aspirin, Advil), Bronchodilator (Albuterol sulfate), Whole Blood, and Mucin had a
potentially inhibitory effect on the detection of PrC or S. pyogenes when any of these
substances was present in SBT at a concentration of 4.3% (w/v or v/v). At 0.4% (w/v),
Tylenol, Advil, Albuterol sulfate and Mucin showed no reportable interference with the
GenePOC Strep A assay. When tested at for at 0.1%, no interference was observed with
Aspirin (w/v) and Whole Blood (v/v). The potential for certain substances to interfere
with the GenePOC Strep A assay is noted in the device labeling.

found in the mouth/throat/respiratory tract, and the most frequent throat and upper
respiratory tract infection causative agents. Two (2) S. pyogenes strains, ATCC 12344
and ATCC 19615, were tested at 3X LoD (999 CFU/ml and 3000 CFU/ml of SB,
respectively) in triplicate in the presence of potentially interfering non-targeted
microorganisms and S. pyogenes-negative throat matrix. Negative samples were also
tested in the presence of potentially interfering non-targeted microorganisms to evaluate
the impact on the PrC. None of the thirty (30) organisms present at 106 CFU/ml of SB for
bacteria and yeast and 105 copies/ml of SB for viruses interfered with the detection of
PrC or with S. pyogenes strain ATCC 19615. A combinatory effect of Streptococcus
mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius and Moraxella catarrhalis at ≥106
CFU/ml of SB (pool), or the presence of Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae
at ≥106 CFU/ml of SB, may have an inhibitory effect on the detection of S. pyogenes
ATCC 12344. When each bacterium from the pool (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus
oralis, Streptococcus salivarius and Moraxella catarrhalis) was tested individually at the
same load (1 x 106 CFU/ml of SB) in presence of S. pyogenes ATCC 12344, none
interfered with the detection of S. pyogenes. After additional testing, S. dysgalactiae
subsp. dysgalactiae strain ATCC 43078 no longer showed interference with S. pyogenes
ATCC 12344 at a load of 1 x 105 CFU/ml of SB. These results are noted in the device
labeling, where appropriate.

b. Matrix comparison:
Not Applicable.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The performance of the GenePOC Strep A assay was evaluated in a prospective
multicenter study that was conducted at geographically diverse clinical trial sites. These
included: (7) collection/testing sites [(5) US sites and (2) Canadian sites] and (1)
dedicated reference method center (across the US and Canada). Throat swab specimens
were collected from patients with signs and symptoms of pharyngitis. Samples were
tested with both the Reference Method (culture) and the GenePOC Strep A assay.
The reference culture procedure was performed within 48 hours of specimen collection
and comprised inoculation of BAP with one swab of a dual throat swab set and
incubation of plates under anaerobic conditions for up to 48 hours. Culture plates that did
not exhibit b-hemolytic colonies after 48 hours were recorded as negative for Group A
Streptococcus. Colonies morphologically resembling S. pyogenes were isolated on a new
13

--- Page 14 ---
BAP and identified by catalase, gram-stain, Latex agglutination, and Matrix-Assisted
Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF).
Seven hundred and sixty-seven (767) specimens were initially enrolled in the study. Of
these, 163 were excluded from the analysis of performance due to: failure to comply with
the revogene testing procedures—delay in pouch opening or transfer to SBT (3),
exceeded the delay in shipment (13), did not meet inclusion criteria (23), did not have
complete testing results (27), and failure to comply with the reference culture protocol
(97). A total of 604 specimens were used to evaluate performance of the assay (Table 7).
For UNR samples, there was an initial UNR rate of 0.5% (3/610) with a final UNR rate
of 0.2% (1/610) after re-testing. For IND samples, there was an initial IND rate of 1.1%
(7/610) with a final rate of 0.8% (5/610) after re-testing.
