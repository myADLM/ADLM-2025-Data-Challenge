H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Refer to Indications for Use
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Yumizen C1200 Glucose HK reagent is intended for the quantitative in vitro
diagnostic determination of glucose in human serum, plasma, and urine using a
glucose hexokinase method by colorimetry. Glucose measurements are used in the
diagnosis and treatment of carbohydrate metabolism disorders including diabetes
mellitus, neonatal hypoglycemia, idiopathic hypoglycemia, and pancreatic islet cell
carcinoma.
The sodium electrode is an ion selective electrode that is intended for use on the ion
selective electrode (ISE) unit of the Yumizen C1200 analyzer. The sodium electrode
is used to quantify the concentrations of sodium ions in serum, plasma, and urine.
Measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
aldosteronism (excessive secretion of the hormone aldosterone), diabetes insipidus
(chronic excretion of large amounts of dilute urine, accompanied by extreme thirst),

L. Test Principle:
Glucose – Glucose in the sample is phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) in the presence
of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and magnesium ions to produce glucose-6-phosphate
(G-6-P) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G- 6-
PDH) specifically oxidizes G-6-P to 6-phosphogluconate with the concurrent reduction
of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NADH), reduced. The change in absorbance at 340/410 nm is proportional to the
amount of glucose present in the sample.
Sodium/Potassium/Chloride – The ISE module employs membrane electrodes for
sodium, potassium and chloride that are specific for each ion of interest in the sample.
An electrical potential is developed according to the Nernst Equation for a specific ion.
When compared to the Internal Solution, this electrical potential is translated into
voltage and then into the ion concentration of the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP06-A guideline.
Test samples spanning the claimed measuring ranges were prepared and
analyzed for each analyte. The results of the linearity studies supported the
claimed measuring ranges, as summarized below:
Analyte / Matrix Measuring Range
Glucose Serum / Plasma 1.8 to 630 mg/dL
Glucose Urine 8.5 to 630 mg/dL
Sodium Serum / Plasma 100 to 200 mmol/L
Sodium Urine 10 to 400 mmol/L
Potassium Serum / Plasma 1.5 to 10 mmol/L
Potassium Urine 3 to 300 mmol/L
Chloride Serum / Plasma 52 to 200 mmol/L
Chloride Urine 15 to 400 mmol/L
The sponsor also performed a study to evaluate the auto-dilute feature available
for serum and urine glucose measurements. The study protocol and acceptance
criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The results of the study
supported the sponsor’s claim that samples with glucose concentrations above
630 mg/dL can be diluted onboard the analyzer to obtain results up to 2520
mg/dL for serum, plasma and urine.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrators are traceable to commercially available reference materials for
glucose, sodium, potassium, and chloride.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor performed limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit
of quantitation (LoQ) studies for the Glucose assay according to the CLSI EP17-
A2 guideline. Results are summarized in the table below.

The sponsor chose to use 1.8 mg/dL as the lowest reportable value for serum and
8.5 mg/dL as the lowest reportable value for urine.
The sponsor performed LoQ studies for the ISE assays according to the CLSI
EP17-A2 guideline. Samples at 11 different concentrations were analyzed in
replicates of four over four days using two lots of reagent. The LoQ was
defined as the highest concentration meeting the following total error goals:
7.0% for serum sodium, 8.0% for serum potassium, 7.4% for serum chloride and
17.6% for urine sodium, potassium and chloride.
Results are summarized in the table below.
Parameter LoQ
Serum/Plasma Sodium (mmol/L) 32.05
Urine Sodium (mmol/L) 9.71
Serum/Plasma Potassium (mmol/L) 0.909
Urine Potassium (mmol/L) 0.258
Serum/Plasma Chloride (mmol/L) 22.59
Urine Chloride (mmol/L) 7.00
The upper and lower limits of the measuring range for the sodium, potassium and
chloride assays are supported by the LoQ studies and the linearity studies
(described under section M.2.b above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed according to the CLSI EP07-A2 guideline.
Potential interferents were spiked into serum and urine sample pools and tested
on the candidate device. The sponsor defined interference as a bias of ≥ 10%.
None of the compounds in the table below caused interference up to and
including the concentrations listed.
