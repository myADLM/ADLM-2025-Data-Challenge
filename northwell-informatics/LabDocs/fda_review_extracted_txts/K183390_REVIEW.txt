--- Page 3 ---
• Execution of test procedures.
• Result management: optical measurement of the reactions, algorithm calculation of
analytical parameters from reaction curves, validation of results, traceability, bi-
directional transmission of requests and results to the LIS.
• Management of disposable components.
The data analyzed can be stored, displayed and printed. Additionally, the analyzer conducts
integrated functions such as the analysis of urgent samples or the Quality Control module.
DG-PT consists of a glass vial containing lyophilized thromboplastin (tissue factor and
phospholipids) from rabbit brain tissue, buffer, calcium ions and preservative. The closure
system includes a stopper and a screw cap. The DG-PT reagent is used to perform PT tests to
screen the extrinsic and common coagulation pathways (Factors II, V, VII and X), and
monitor oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) with vitamin K antagonists.
The assay is based on the activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway by the addition of
the reagent to the plasma sample. The thromboplastin interacts with FVII and calcium ions
activating a series of specific enzymes that comprise the extrinsic and common pathways of
the coagulation cascade ultimately leading to the formation of a fibrin clot. The reader in the
QNext analyzer measures the light change produced during the reaction.

L. Test Principle:
The DG-PT test contains thromboplastin (tissue factor and phospholipids) from rabbit brain
tissue. The test is based on the activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway by the addition of
thromboplastin reagent to the plasma sample. The thromboplastin interacts with FVII and
calcium ions which activate a series of specific enzymes that comprise the extrinsic and common
pathways of the coagulation cascade ultimately leading to the formation of a fibrin clot.
The reader on the QNext analyzer measures the light change produced in the cuvette from the
mixing of the plasma with the thromboplastin reagent until a fibrin clot is formed. The light
change produced in the cuvette due to the clot formation is simultaneously read at two
wavelengths (405 nm and 620 nm) obtaining as a result a sigmoidal curve. Once the sigmoidal
curve (absorbance-time) is obtained, the clotting time in seconds is determined with an
algorithm.
The INR is automatically calculated using the MNPT (Mean Normal Prothrombin Time) and the
ISI (International Sensitivity Index) from the current lot of PT reagent. The value is obtained
according to the following equation: INR = (PT Patient (s) /MNPT (s))ISI.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were designed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3.
Repeatability and within-laboratory precision were evaluated in a single site study
using seven native plasma samples with three lots of reagent over 20 days with two
runs per day and two replicates per run.

--- Page 7 ---
The reproducibility study was performed in three sites using seven native plasma
samples on two QNext analyzers over five days with two runs per day and three
replicates per run.

The total allowable difference was analyzed for DG-PT in seconds and INR using the
data from method comparison studies to address the concerns regarding variability in the
performance of the DG-PT and to support use of the device as a reference method for
PT/INR meters (both professional-use and prescription home-use PT/INR meters).
According to CLIA and CMS(42 CFR 493.941), the percentage of samples should be
±15% within an allowable error. For DG-PT/INR, 95.2% of the samples that are within a
total allowable difference of ±18% relatively to HemosIL thromboplastin PT-Fibrinogen
HS Plus reagent on ACL TOP 700 instrument and for DG-PT in seconds 94.3% of the
samples that are within a total allowable difference of ±15% relatively to HemosIL PT-
Fibrinogen HS Plus on ACL TOP 700 instrument.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity is not applicable for prothrombin time and INR. The INR for the DG-PT is
calculated mathematically using a standardized thromboplastin based on log of
clotting time in seconds.
The reportable range for the DG-PT, 0.9–8.0 INR, was established by assay
performance in the method comparison study against the predicate device (HemosIL
PT-Fibrinogen HS Plus on ACL TOP 700).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Shelf-life Stability:
The shelf-life stability claim for DG-PT is supported by the stability studies
performed in accordance with CLSI EP25-A “Evaluation of Stability of In Vitro
Diagnostic Reagents”. Three lots of reagents were evaluated at different time points
(0, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 26 months) at 2–8°C. The study was conducted by testing a total
of four samples: one native normal plasma pool, one frozen plasma pool collected
from patients on AVK (anti-Vitamin K treatment) and commercial quality control
material (normal and pathological levels). The shelf-life stability study has been

completed up to 26 months for DG-PT, and found to be acceptable to support a 24-
month shelf-life stability claim at 2–8°C.
In-Use Stability:
The in-use stability claim for DG-PT is supported by the stability studies performed
in accordance with CLSI EP25-A “Evaluation of Stability of In Vitro Diagnostic
Reagents”. The study was conducted by testing a total of three samples: one native
normal plasma pool, and commercial quality control material (normal and
pathological levels). One lot of reagent was evaluated at different time points and at
different temperature ranges with different reagent conditions (e.g., capped,
uncapped).
The in use stability study has been completed up to 16 days for DG-PT, and found to
be acceptable to support a 10-day in-use stability claim at 2–8°C.
To support the in-use stability claim at 25°C, different time points (12, 24, 36, 48, 60
and 72 hours) were evaluated. The in-use stability study has been completed up to 72
hours for DG-PT, and found to be acceptable to support a 2-day (48-hour) in use
stability claim at 25°C.
To support the on-board stability claim, different time points (1, 4, 6 8, and 11 days)
were evaluated. The on-board stability study has been completed up to 11 days for
DG-PT, and found to be acceptable to support a 5-day on-board stability claim.
Transport stability:
Transport stability was established by evaluating one lot of reagent for one week at ≤
-20 ºC and 40 ºC, at the beginning of the shelf-life study and following reagent
storage at the recommended storage conditions (2–8°C) to undergo shelf-life and in-
use testing, as indicated below.
• Shelf-life stability study at 5 ± 3°C
• In-use stability study at 5 ± 3°C (capped)
• In-use stability study at 25ºC ± 2°C / 40% RH (relatively humidity) ± 5%
(uncapped)
• In-use stability study at 25 ºC ± 2°C (capped)
• In-use stability onboard the QNext instrument (uncapped)
All acceptance criteria for the transportation stability were met.
Traceability/Calibrator:
DG-PT is calibrated using WHO International Reference Standards, per
recommendations of the WHO Technical Report Series Nº 979, Annex 6, 2013,
Guidelines for thromboplastins and plasma used to control oral anticoagulant therapy
with vitamin K antagonists. Two types of calibration are performed: 1) Calibration of
secondary standards using an appropriate International Reference Preparation and 2)
Calibration of DG-PT against the corresponding secondary standard (“lot-to-lot”
9

--- Page 10 ---
calibration). All the lots used for the performance of DG-PT have been calibrated
against the corresponding secondary standard.
Quality Controls:
There are two Quality Control materials for use with the DG-PT tests on the QNext
analyzer – DG-C1, which is a normal lyophilized control (PT at ~12 seconds, within
reference interval for the tests), and DG-C2, which is an abnormal lyophilized control
(prolonged PT at ~ 20 seconds, which is the upper end of the reference interval for
the prothrombin time tests).
d. Detection limit:
A factor sensitivity study was designed in accordance with CLSI H47-A2.
For the factor sensitivity study, PT determinations were made for factors II, V, VII
and X in a set of samples spanning from <1% to 100% of a specific coagulation
factor, in order to establish the minimum concentration at which the screening test
rises above the upper limit of the established reference interval.
A set of 13 samples obtained from dilutions of normal pooled plasma with the
appropriate factor deficient plasma was tested. Two replicates of each sample were
tested using two lots of DG-PT. No clotting time result was obtained for the <1 IU/dL
sample level for factor II, factor V, factor VII and factor X.
According to the interpolation of the upper limit of the reference interval in the
quadratic regression model using the log-log transformation, the sensitivity estimate
for each factor was determined to be the values reported in the table below.

FII 29
FV 45
FVII 44
FX 43
e. Analytical specificity:
The study was designed in accordance with the recommendations in CLSI EP7-A2
and the statistical analyses were conducted in accordance with the recommendations
in CLSI EP07-A3. The following interferents were evaluated: hemoglobin,
triglycerides, bilirubin, LMWH (low molecular weight heparin), UFH (unfractioned
heparin), argatroban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban. Two sample levels were tested
(pooled normal samples and pooled abnormal samples from patients on oral
anticoagulant). Each potential interfering substance was added to each sample pool.
The following interferents: hemoglobin, triglycerides, bilirubin, LMWH, UFH
showed no significant interference (≤10% observed effect) up to the concentrations
indicated in the table below:

b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was conducted to demonstrate equivalence between fresh
and frozen citrated plasma samples. The study assessed the comparability of sample
results when tested freshly and after 7 days (1 week) of storage at ≤-70ºC (fresh vs
frozen plasma samples). Testing was performed at one external site using one reagent
lot. Fifty four (54) fresh patient samples covering the clinical decision points and both
normal and abnormal levels of the measuring interval were tested. Results were
analyzed using Passing-Bablok regression analysis and Bland-Altman plots. The
study results demonstrated comparability between fresh and frozen samples and met
the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The reference interval study was designed in accordance with CLSI C28-A3.
The study was performed at two sites using one lot of reagents. A total of 243 reference
samples obtained from reference individuals (apparently healthy men and women adults,
≥ 21 years of age) were tested. Results from two sites were pooled and all reference
intervals were established by calculating the non-parametric 95% confidence interval
(2.5th to 97.5th percentiles). The calculated normal reference range for PT is 12.1 to 16.1
seconds and for INR is 0.83 to 1.17.
