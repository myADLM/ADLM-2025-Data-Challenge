4. Special instrument requirements:
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems
I. Device Description:
The VITEK® 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the
doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).
Each VITEK® 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient
medium is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of
antimicrobials combined with the nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a
standardized concentration with 0.45% to 0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the
antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System will automatically dilute the
bacterial suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then the VITEK® 2 will
fill, seal and place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual
filling, sealing and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well
in the card over a defined period of time (up to 24 hours for Streptococcus species). The
analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based on attenuation of light
measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the minimum inhibitory
concentration or MIC values for the anti-microbial agent. At the completion of the incubation
cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category
result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-GN Imipenem has the following concentrations in the card: 0.5, 2, 8, and 16
µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL).
The MIC result range for VITEK 2 AST-GN Imipenem on the VITEK 2 card is ≤ 0.25 - ≥ 16
µg/mL for Enterobacteriaceae and ≤ 0.5 - ≥ 16 µg/mL for Acinetobacter spp. and P.
aeruginosa.

L. Test Principle:
The VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection
using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics used in the systems use
visible light to directly measure organism growth. Transmittance optics are based on an
initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Periodic light
transmittance samplings of the same well measure organism growth by how much light is
prevented from going through the well. The VITEK 2 System monitors the growth of each
well in the card over a defined period of time. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16

completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along
with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic on the card.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was performed at three external sites using a panel comprised
of 10 isolates from indicated species: P. aeruginosa (three isolates) and K.
pneumoniae (seven isolates). All isolates were tested in triplicate at each of the testing
sites with each inoculation method and with the VITEK 2 and the VITEK 2 Compact.
The mode MIC was determined and the reproducibility was calculated based on MIC
values falling within ± 1 dilution of the mode MIC value. Reproducibility was greater
than 95% for all inoculation and read methods and was considered to be acceptable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
N/A
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality control strains recommended by the CLSI were tested with imipenem at four
sites. The QC organisms tested were E. coli ATCC 25922 and P. aeruginosa ATCC
27853. The QC strains were tested a minimum of 20 time per site and inoculated
using both the automated dilution and manual dilution for VITEK 2 and using manual
dilution for the VITEK 2 Compact. Testing with E. coli ATCC 25922 provided off
scale results with the VITEK 2 card as the acceptable range for this strain is at or
lower than the lowest dilution on the card. The sponsor included the following
footnote to the E. coli ATCC 25922 expected range in the device labeling QC table:
FDA/CLSI Broth Microdilution expected QC range = 0.06 – 0.25 µg/mL. Does
not include the full recommended dilution range for QC testing with this
organism.
As an additional check of the reference method, two gram positive organisms were
tested throughout the study at each clinical site. Isolates tested were E. faecalis ATCC
29212 and S. aureus ATCC 29213. All results were within the expected range.
The results demonstrate that the VITEK 2 can provide quality control results within
the recommended ranges for all inoculation methods > 95% of the time (Table 2).

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Testing of imipenem on the VITEK AST gram-negative card was performed at three
external sites and one internal site. Results obtained with the VITEK 2 AST-Gram
Negative card were compared to results obtained with the CLSI broth microdilution
reference panel using direct colony suspension inoculation. Reference panels were
incubated at 35° C for 16 to 20 hours for Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa and
20 to 24 hours for Acinetobacter spp.
Test inocula for VITEK 2 AST were standardized using the DensiCHEK Plus
instrument. The DensiCHEK instrument was calibrated within specified intervals; all
recorded calibration values were within acceptable parameters. VITEK 2 AST –
Gram Negative cards were inoculated using automatic dilution (for reading on the
VITEK 2 instrument) or using a manual dilution method (for reading on the VITEK 2
instrument or on the VITEK 2 COMPACT instrument).
A total of 385 clinical isolates were evaluated, 379 of these were from indicated
species. A total of 239 (61.9%) isolates were fresh or recent isolates (tested within
one year of isolation from clinical specimens); 146 (37.8%) were stock. Clinical
isolates included: Acinetobacter spp. (36 isolates), P. aeruginosa (122 isolates), E.
coli (97 isolates), Citrobacter spp. (13 isolates), Enterobacter cloacae/E. cloacae
complex (32 isolates), Klebsiella spp. (79 isolates). An additional six isolates of non-
indicated species were tested. One clinical isolate of P. aeruginosa failed to grow in
the VITEK 2 AST-GN card.
A total of 218 challenge isolates were tested at one clinical site using both automatic
and manual dilution methods for the VITEK 2 System and manual dilution for the
VITEK 2 Compact System. Challenge isolates tested included: Acinetobacter spp. (23
isolates), P. aeruginosa (55 isolates), E. coli (6 isolates), Citrobacter spp. (1 isolate),
Enterobacter cloacae/E. cloacae complex (18 isolates), Klebsiella spp. (115 isolates).
For the VITEK 2 with automatic dilution, the MIC results obtained with clinical and
challenge isolates of Enterobacteriaceae demonstrated an EA of 96.2% and CA of
97.0%, EA of 98.3% and CA of 98.3% for Acinetobacter spp. and EA of 94.4% and
CA of 91.0% for P. aeruginosa. For all organism groups combined the MIC results
demonstrated an EA of 95.9% and CA of 95.4%. The majority of errors for all
organisms were minor errors. There were 100 resistant P. aeruginosa isolates by the
reference method; the VITEK 2 with automatic dilution showed a very major error
rate of 2.0% for this organism, which is considered acceptable. The EA of evaluable
results was low for all organism groups (88.1%, 83.3% and 88.9% for
8

--- Page 9 ---
Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa, respectively); the low EA
of evaluable results for Acinetobacter spp. was due to the large number of isolates
showing MICs ≥16 for the reference method and the test device (Table 3).
For VITEK 2 with manual dilution the MIC results obtained with challenge isolates
demonstrated an EA of 98.6% and CA of 97.9% for Enterobacteriaceae, EA and CA
of 95.7% for Acinetobacter spp., and EA of 96.4% and CA of 94.5% for P.
aeruginosa. The EA of evaluable results for Acinetobacter spp. was 80.0% due to the
majority of isolates (20/23) having MICs ≥16 for both the reference method and test
device resulting in a low number of evaluable results. (Table 4).
For VITEK 2 Compact with manual dilution, the MIC results obtained with challenge
isolates demonstrated an EA of 99.3% and CA of 97.9% for Enterobacteriaceae, EA
and CA of 95.7% for Acinetobacter spp., and EA of 96.4% and CA of 94.5% for P.
aeruginosa. The EA of evaluable results for Acinetobacter spp. was 80.0% due to the
majority of isolates (20/23) having MICs ≥16 for both the reference method and test
device (Table 5).
The sponsor included the following limitation in the device labeling to address testing
for species for which no performance data was provided for FDA review in this
submission:
Perform an alternative method of testing prior to reporting of results for the
following antibiotic/organism combinations: Imipenem (ipm05n): Klebsiella
(Enterobacter) aerogenes, Proteus species, Providencia species, Morganella
species and Serratia species.

To address testing of non-indicated species the sponsor included the following
statement in the Precautions section of the device labeling:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the
safety and efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility
is tested by this AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate
and well-controlled clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to
microorganisms outside of those found in the indications and usage in the drug
label. The clinical significance of susceptibility information in those instances is
unknown. The approved labeling for specific antimicrobial drugs provides the
uses for which the antimicrobial drug is approved.
Device failure: During the clinical study two episodes of device failure occurred;
both were resolved with an instrument restart. Isolates being processed at the time of
device failure were discarded and retested.

Resistance Mechanisms. Challenge isolates of P. aeruginosa and
Enterobacteriaceae harboring the following resistance mechanisms were evaluated:
KPC, OXA, IMP, VIM, SPM, modified OprD, VEB, CARB-3, TEM, PDC, GES,
PER, NDM, OmpK, OmpC, ACT/MIR, IMI, VEB-1B, and SHV.
MIC Trending
An analysis of trending was conducted using the combined clinical and challenge data
for each organism group. This trending calculation takes into account MIC values that
are determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or higher compared to the
reference method irrespective of whether the device MIC values are on-scale or not.
Results that are not clearly at least one dilution lower, at least one dilution higher or
in exact agreement with the CLSI reference method are not considered in the trending
analysis.
Trending results are shown in Table 6; results were stratified by species to determine
if species-related trends were observed. Species for which the difference between the
percentage of isolates with higher vs. lower readings was ≥30 and for which the
confidence interval was determined to be statistically significant were considered to
show evidence of trending. Trending that provides higher or lower MIC values
compared to the reference is addressed in labeling.
A trend toward higher MIC readings was observed for E. coli with the autodilution
inoculation method on VITEK 2, and for E. cloacae/E. cloacae complex with all
dilution methods on VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact. A trend toward lower MIC
readings was observed for Klebsiella spp. for manual dilution with VITEK 2 and
VITEK 2 Compact (Table 6). The sponsor included the following footnote to the
performance table to address the trending observed for imipenem.
Overall, MIC values for Enterobacteriaceae were within one dilution of the CLSI
reference broth microdilution method. However, imipenem MIC values tended to
be in exact agreement or at least one dilution higher when testing E. coli with
autodilution, E. cloacae/E. cloacae complex with manual dilution and
autodilution and at least one dilution lower when testing Klebsiella spp. with
manual dilution as compared to the CLSI reference broth microdilution
