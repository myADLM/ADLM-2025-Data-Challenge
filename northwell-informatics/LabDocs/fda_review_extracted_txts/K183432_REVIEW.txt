K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced:
IEC 61010-1 Edition 3.0 2010-06 Safety requirements for electrical equipment for
measurement, control, and laboratory use - Part 1: General requirements.
L. Test Principles:
cobas u pack
pH: Color indicator method using methyl red, phenolphthalein and bromothymol blue.
Leukocytes: The test reveals the presence of granulocyte esterases. The esterases cleave an
indoxyl ester, and the indoxyl reacts with a diazonium salt to produce a violet dye.
Nitrite: The test is based on the principle of the Griess test and is specific for nitrite. Nitrite
reacts with an aromatic amine to give a diazonium salt, which by coupling with a further
compound yields a red-violet azo dye.
Protein: The detection of protein is based on the protein error of pH indicators method.
When pH is held constant by a buffer, indicator dye (3',3'',5',5''- tetrachlorophenol-3,4,5,6-
tetrabromosulfophthalein) releases H+ ions based on the amount of protein present and
change color from yellow to light green.
Glucose: The glucose determination is based on the specific glucose-oxidase/peroxidase
reaction. The reaction utilizes the glucose oxidase to catalyze the formation of gluconic acid
and hydrogen peroxide from the oxidation of glucose. A second enzyme, peroxidase,
catalyzes the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with the chromogen tetramethylbenzidine to
form a green dye complex.
Ketones: The detection of ketones in urine is based on a method where sodium nitroprusside
and glycine react with acetoacetate and acetone in an alkaline medium to form a violet dye
complex.
Urobilinogen: Urobilinogen is coupled with 4-methoxybenzene-diazonium-tetrafluoroborate
in an acid medium to form a red azo dye.
Bilirubin: The detection of bilirubin is based on the coupling reaction of a diazonium salt of
2,6-dichlorobenzene-diazonium-tetrafluoroborate with bilirubin in an acid medium. The
reaction yields a pink to red‑violet color proportional to the total bilirubin concentration.
Erythrocytes: The chemical detection of blood is based on the pseudo-peroxidase action of
erythrocytes and hemoglobin. Hemoglobin and myoglobin, if present, catalyze the oxidation
of the indicator by the organic peroxide to give a blue-green coloration. Intact erythrocytes
are hemolyze on the test paper and liberate hemoglobin which produces a green dot.
Scattered or compacted green dots on the yellow test paper are indicative of intact
4

--- Page 5 ---
erythrocytes. A uniform green coloration of the test is indicative of free hemoglobin,
myoglobin, or hemolyzed erythrocytes in the urine.
Color: Urine color is measured in a white area on the test strip which is not impregnated
with reagents. Urine color is reported as Pale Yellow, Yellow, Amber, Orange, Brown, Red,
Green, or other. The urine color measurement is also used in this urinalysis system for a
color correction algorithm to compensate for intrinsically colored urine samples when testing
for Leukocytes, Nitrite, Glucose, Ketone bodies, Urobilinogen, Bilirubin, and Erythrocytes.
The measurements of protein and pH are not compensated for urine color.

The sponsor did not describe any traceability for the test system.
d. Detection limit:
Study 1 - Analytical sensitivity:
The detection limit for each analyte on the test strip was established in an analytical
sensitivity study which measured for each analyte the concentration which
transitioned the lowest measurement block (negative or normal) to the next level
measurement block (positive). The sponsor defined analytical sensitivity as the
lowest analyte concentration where ≥90% of the measurement results were positive.
In the study, a negative native urine pool was spiked with the analyte to 5 to 7
concentration levels. Each concentration level was measured in replicates of 20 on
each of the three analyzers using three lots of cobas u pack for a total of n=2820
measurements across all analytes. The results are summarized in the following table:

Study 2 – Measurement block cut-off:
Transition points studies were performed with the cobas u 601 urinalysis test system
to determine the cut-off concentration between each semi-quantitative block. The
cut-off concentration was defined as the lowest sample concentration at which ≥ 55%
of the test results are positive with respect to the transited from block. Samples were
prepared from native negative urine spiked with the analyte to 5 concentrations
spanning the expected cut-off concentration. Each concentration level was measured
in replicates of 20 on each of the three analyzers using three lots of cobas u pack.
The cut-off concentration between each measurement block is summarized in the
table below where the block output is the transitioned to block.

e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity studies were conducted to assess for interfering effects of
endogenous substances and therapeutic drugs on the cobas u 601 urinalysis test
system (except color and clarity). In the study, samples were prepared from pooled
analyte negative urine at two levels for each analyte (except pH which was tested at
one normal level): (1) negative/normal range and (2) first positive range. Each of
these samples was further aliquoted into three. Two of these were spiked at two
different concentrations of interfering substance. A third aliquot was used as a
reference without interfering substance. For therapeutic drug substances, the highest
concentration tested was approximately 5 times the maximal daily dosage. For
endogenous substances the highest concentration tested was approximately 5 times
the highest pathological level. Each sample aliquot was tested in replicates of 10
across 2 analyzers and 2 cobas u pack lots. The sponsor defined no significant

Interference effect of urine pH
Studies were conducted to assess the effect of urine pH on the test results. For all test
strip analytes, except leukocytes there was no interference from pH across a range of
4.5 to 9.0. For leukocytes, urine pH values lower than 5.5 may yield a false negative
result.
Interference effect of intrinsic urine color
The candidate device includes a feature that corrects for intrinsic urine color. Studies
were conducted to verify that the test strip analytes of erythrocytes, leukocytes,
nitrite, ketones, glucose, urobilinogen and bilirubin were insensitive to interference
from red, orange, and brown colored urine samples. Other urine colors were not
tested. The results demonstrated that red, orange, and brown urine do not significantly
impact the results for those analytes tested since all results were within +/- 1 color
block when testing red, orange and brown colored urine for these parameters.
Interference effect of urine specific gravity
Studies were conducted to assess the effect of urine specific gravity on the test
results. For all test strip analytes, except leukocytes there was no interference from
changes in specific gravity across a range of 1.015 (normal) to 1.050 (high) g/cm3.
For leukocytes, false negative results were found at urine specific gravity values
higher than 1.030 g/cm3.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The accuracy performance of the test system was assessed by method comparison for
agreement to comparator devices for each analyte/parameter on the cobas u 601
urinalysis test system.
Study #1 – All analytes except urine clarity
A method comparison study for the test strip analytes was conducted at one clinical
laboratory using left-over urine specimens from routine use and were measured
within two hours from collection. All measurements were performed using native
samples only - there were no contrived samples. Each sample was split in two
aliquots and measured in one-fold determination on the candidate device and the
predicate device (the cobas u 411 urinalysis test system.) The data are presented in
concordance charts, as shown in the tables below.

Study #2 – Urine clarity
A method comparison study for the analyzer measured parameter of clarity was
conducted at three clinical laboratories using left-over urine specimens from routine
use and were measured within two hours from collection. All measurements were
performed using native samples only - there were no contrived samples. Urine
samples were measured to cover the analytical measurement range of clarity. Each
sample was split in two aliquots and measured in one-fold determination on the
candidate device and on a comparator method. The data from each site was
combined and analyzed in a concordance chart:

3. Specimen Identification (ID):
A patient ID is entered either manually using the touch screen or scanned using the
barcode reader.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Samples tubes are manually placed into a rack, which is loaded into the analyzer. The
rack is automatically moved within the analyzer fluid handling station using a rack
conveyor. During a run, the urine sample is aspirated into the fluid system and pipetted
onto test pads of a test strip.
5. Calibration:
A calibration of the analyzer’s PMC is performed every 4 weeks by measuring the clarity
and specific gravity of water.
A calibration of the analyzer’s photometer unit is performed every 4 weeks by measuring
the reflectance of a dedicated calibration strip; i.e. cobas u calibration strip. The results
are compared against a reference plate built into the analyzer.
There are no external calibrators for the test system. The analyzer reference plate is
measured along with each test strip measurement, and the assay reflectance
measurements are normalized to the reference plate when calculating the results.
6. Quality Control:
The following quality controls are recommended:
▪ qUAntify Plus Control
▪ Liquichek Urinalysis Control
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
Performance Characteristics Section above:
1. Instrument / sample carryover
Study #1 – all analytes, except urine clarity:
The carryover on the cobas u 601 urine analyzer for all analytes measured by reflectance
from the test strip was evaluated. Sample carry-over was assessed by alternatively
measuring 5 high samples followed by 5 low samples, and repeating the cycle 4 times.
The magnitude of the elevation of the low sample caused by carryover from the high
26

--- Page 27 ---
sample was determined by comparison of low sample result to a reference run of negative
samples with n=25 replicates. The carryover study was performed on one instrument.
For all analytes, all negative/normal samples read as negative/normal, and therefore no
significant carryover found in the study. For urine color, all pale yellow samples were
measured in the same color range after pipetting of brown urine samples.

Study #2 – Clarity:
The PMC carryover on the cobas u 601 urine analyzer was evaluated in terms of urine
clarity. Sample carry-over was assessed by alternatively measuring 5 high samples
followed by 5 low samples, and repeating the cycle 4 times. The magnitude of the
elevation of the low sample caused by carryover from the high sample was determined by
comparison of low sample result to a reference run of negative samples with n=25
replicates. The carryover study was performed on one instrument. For urine clarity, the
carryover was within the same color block, and therefore not significant.
2. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC)
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that EMC testing was performed on the
cobas u 601 urine analyzer and was found to be compliant of the requirements of the
EMC specifications.
3. Electrical Safety
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that electrical safety testing was
performed on the cobas u 601 urine analyzer and that all requirements for electrical safety
were met.
