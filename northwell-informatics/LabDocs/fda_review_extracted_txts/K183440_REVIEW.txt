L. Test Principle:
The FVIII Inhibitor Kit components are used to perform a sample pretreatment process,
including negative and positive assay controls that also undergo the pretreatment process.
Diluted heat inactivated patient plasma is mixed with an exogenous source of FVIII (IB‐
PNP) and prepared alongside a control mix, consisting of a diluent (IB‐BSA) and IB‐PNP.
Following a 2-hour incubation, the FVIII activity of the test plasma relative to the control
mix is determined and used to calculate FVIII inhibitor activity expressed as Bethesda units
per milliliter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Repeatability:
An internal precision study was performed using three different lots of CRYOcheck
FVIII Inhibitor Kit by one operator on a Siemens BCS XP analyzer. The study
included the kit’s Positive and Negative Control as test samples as well as four
plasma samples collected from congenital hemophilia A patients representing
negative, low, mid and high levels of FVIII inhibitor. Each sample was measured
with each product lot in duplicate, twice a day for 20 days for a total of 80 replicates
per sample per lot. All results met the predefined acceptance criteria and were
determined to be acceptable.

Inhibitor Kit stored at < –70°C (monitored condition ‐76 to ‐82°C). At each timepoint
(0, 6, 7, 12, 13 months), five replicates of the kit’s Positive and Negative Control as
well as four plasma samples collected from congenital hemophilia A patients
representing negative, low, mid and high levels of FVIII inhibitor were quantified.
The study was performed up to 13 months and the data were found to be acceptable to

In‐Use Stability
An in‐use stability study was conducted using three lots of CRYOcheck FVIII
Inhibitor Kit maintained at room temperature (18–25 °C) or in a refrigerator (2–8 °C)
post-thaw. At each time point (0, 2, 4, 6 and 7 hours), six replicates of the kit’s
Positive and Negative Control as well as three plasma samples collected from
congenital hemophilia A patients representing negative, low and high levels of FVIII
inhibitor were evaluated. The data support a 4‐hour in‐use stability of the product
when maintained at room temperature or at 2–8 °C post thaw.
d. Detection limit:

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were conducted using a single lot of CRYOcheck FVIII Inhibitor
Kit. Patient plasma samples (concentrations shown in the table below) were spiked
with potential interferents (hemoglobin, intralipid, bilirubin, human von Willebrand
factor, rheumatoid factor (RF) and Lupus Anticoagulant (LA)) and ten replicates were
tested alongside ten replicates of the corresponding blank matrix control. To screen
pathogenic autoantibodies as interferents, RF and LA spiked inhibitor‐positive and
negative samples were prepared by adding a high titer FVIII inhibitor‐positive plasma
(~100 BU/mL) from a single donor to a pool of RF+ patient plasma or a pool of heat
inactivated (30 min at 56°C) LA+ patient plasma to target inhibitor levels similar to
the described panel members in the table below. The corresponding matrix blank was
prepared by adding the same quantity of a high titer FVIII inhibitor‐positive plasma
to normal plasma (RF blank) or heat inactivated normal plasma (LA blank).

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed at three sites to compare the accuracy of
the CRYOcheck FVIII Inhibitor Kit relative to a comparator device (a validated CDC
modified FVIII Chromogenic Nijmegen Bethesda assay). Aliquots of 3.2% sodium
citrate frozen plasma samples from individuals with congenital hemophilia A
(N=210) were distributed across three sites and tested using a single lot of
CRYOcheck FVIII Inhibitor Kit. A second aliquot of each sample was tested at a
central reference laboratory using a validated chromogenic CDC Modified Nijmegen‐
Bethesda Assay on a Siemens BCS XP instrument. Prior to testing, samples tested on
the comparator and candidate devices underwent the same number of freeze‐thaw
cycles.
Determination of titer inhibition:
CRYOcheck FVIII Inhibitor Kit
The Chromogenic FVIII activity of each sample was measured using the Siemens
Factor VIII Chromogenic Assay on a BCS‐XP analyzer. To determine the inhibitor
titer of each test sample, residual FVIII activity (%RA) was calculated as the relative
percentage of FVIII activity of the test mixture compared to the control mix. Using
the sample dilution with the %RA closest to 50%, the Bethesda Units (BU/mL) was
calculated using the following formula: BU/mL= [(2‐Log %RA)/0.30103] x dilution
factor.
Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed for each site and all sites
combined (results summarized below). The results met the predefined acceptance
criteria and were determined to be acceptable.

The predicted bias at the predefined medical decision points was calculated for all
sites. The observed predicted bias at the medical decision points for all sites
combined met the predefined acceptance criteria and were determined to be
acceptable.
Agreement between the candidate device (CRYOcheck FVIII Inhibitor Kit) and
comparator method results are summarized below based on a cut‐off of <0.6 BU/mL2
for a negative assay result. As shown in the table below, 100% (N=133) of the
samples that tested positive by the comparator method also tested positive by the
candidate device. Of the 77 samples that tested negative by the comparator method,
76 also tested negative by the candidate device. The single sample that tested positive
by the candidate method did so because of rounding the calculated BU/mL to one
decimal place. The candidate device result was 0.55 BU/mL (rounding to 0.6 BU/mL)
versus a result of 0.41 BU/mL (rounding to 0.4 BU/mL) by the comparator method.

performed using samples contrived from immunodepleted factor FVIII‐deficient
plasma and monoclonal FVIII inhibitor antibodies and a second study was performed
using samples from congenital hemophilia A patients.
In the first stability study, three test plasma samples to represent negative (0.0
BU/mL), low (2.0 BU/mL) and high titer (11.0 BU/mL) were created using
immunodepleted Factor VIII deficient plasma mixed with a high‐titer sample (0.31
μg/mL of anti‐FVIII monoclonal antibody). The titer of each freshly prepared plasma
sample was quantified at baseline (t=0) and then subjected to five different storage
conditions that tested fresh versus frozen and multiple rounds of freeze thaw cycles as
outlined in the table below. Conditions 1 and 2 were evaluated at 6, 7, 24 and 25
hours. Condition 3 was evaluated at 7, 8, 14, 15 days and conditions 4 and 5 was
evaluated for three freeze-thaw cycles.
Condition Storage Conditions
1 Fresh samples stored at 2−8°C for up to 25 hours
2 Frozen at –80°C, thawed and stored at 2−8°C for up to 25 hours
3 Frozen at –80°C, transferred to ‐20°C and stored for up to 15 days
4 Frozen at –80°C, three freeze thaw cycles at ‐20°C
5 Frozen at –80°C, three freeze thaw cycles at ‐80°C
Linear regression analysis was performed for each measured titer under the specified
storage conditions in the table above. The study results demonstrated comparability
between fresh and frozen samples and met the predefined acceptance criteria. These
findings support that samples for use with the FVIII Inhibitor Kit can be stored at
2−8°C for up to 24 hours, at –20°C for up to 14 days. Patient samples can also be
subjected to up to three freeze‐thaw cycles prior to use with the CRYOcheck FVIII
Inhibitor Kit.
In the second study, a retrospective analysis was performed examining FVIII inhibitor
titer results for four plasma samples from congenital hemophilia A patients
representing negative, low, mid and high levels of FVIII inhibitor quantified using
three lots of CRYOcheck FVIII Inhibitor Kit. Four plasma samples derived from
congenital hemophilia A patients including a non‐zero negative panel member (0.3
BU/mL) and three FVIII inhibitor‐positive samples (low (1.0 BU/mL), mid (5.0
BU/mL) and high panel (9.0 BU/mL) members were prepared. These samples were
tested at baseline (t=0) and stored at <–70 °C for up to 13 months. At various time
points, plasma samples were taken from storage, thawed (37 ± 1°C) and tested. The
results demonstrated sample stability of 12 months when stored frozen at < –70°C.
