clearance for a new device
C. Measurand: Anti-Borrelia burgdorferi (IgM and/or IgG) antibodies
D. Type of Test: Enzyme Immunoassay
E. Applicant: Bio-Rad Laboratories
F. Proprietary and Established Names: BioPlex 2200 Lyme Total
G. Regulatory Information:
1. Regulation section: 21 CFR 866.3830; Treponema pallidum treponemal test reagents
2. Classification: Class II
3. Product code: LSR; Reagent, Borrelia Serological Reagent
4. Panel: Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
1.Intended use(s): The BioPlex 2200 Lyme Total kit is a multiplex flow immunoassay intended for
the qualitative detection of total (IgM/IgG) antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum
and plasma (EDTA, heparin). This assay should be used to test patients with history and/or
symptoms of infection with B. burgdorferi. The BioPlex 2200 Lyme Total kit is intended for use
with the Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 System. All reactive and equivocal specimens should be tested
with a second tier test such as Lyme IgG and IgM Western blot assays. Positive second tier
results are supportive evidence of infection with B. burgdorferi. Diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis
should be made based on the presence of B. burgdorferi antibodies, history, symptoms, and other
laboratory data. Non-reactive first tier or negative second tier results should not be used to
exclude borreliosis.

I. Device Description:
The BioPlex 2200 Lyme Total kit employs fluoromagnetic, dyed beads which are coated with
recombinant p58, OspCB or synthetic peptide FVlsE (consisting of FlaB and VlsE sequences). Unique
fluorescent signatures identify the presence of total (IgG/IgM) antibodies to B. burgdorferi in a two-step
assay format.
The BioPlex 2200 System combines an aliquot of patient sample, sample diluent, and bead reagent in a
reaction vessel. The mixture is incubated at 37°C. After a wash cycle, a mixture of murine monoclonal
anti-human IgG and murine monoclonal anti-human IgM antibody conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE) is
added to the dyed beads, and this mixture is incubated at 37°C. The excess conjugate is removed in
another wash cycle and the beads are re-suspended in sheath fluid. The bead mixture then passes
through the detector. The identity of the dyed beads is determined by the fluorescence of the dyes, and
the amount of antibody captured by the antigen is determined by the fluorescence of the attached PE.
Raw data is calculated in relative fluorescence intensity (RFI).

Precision: Precision testing of the BioPlex 2200 Lyme Total kit was performed in accordance
with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP5-A3 guideline. The serum
samples were tested in duplicate, two runs per day, over 20 days (2 replicates x 2 runs x 20 days
= 80 replicates per panel member) using one lot of the BioPlex 2200 Lyme Total Reagent Pack,
Calibrator Set and Control Set. The results are summarized in the table below.

Reproducibility: To assess reproducibility of the BioPlex 2200 Lyme Total kit, a reproducibility
panel was prepared at Bio-Rad Laboratories. The panel contained members with varying levels
of antibodies to the analytes in the BioPlex 2200 Lyme Total kit, and a positive control (antibody
reactive for all analytes). Reproducibility testing was performed at 3 clinical trial sites. One lot of
BioPlex 2200 Lyme Total Reagent Packs, BioPlex 2200 Lyme Total Calibrator Sets and BioPlex
2200 Lyme Total Control Sets was used to evaluate reproducibility. Each of the panel members
and a positive and negative control were tested in quadruplicate on 2 runs per day over 5 days at
each of 3 sites (4 replicates x 2 runs x 5 days = 40 replicates per panel member per site = 120
total replicates for 3 sites). The data was analyzed for intra-assay and inter-assay reproducibility
according to the CLSI guidance EP15-A3. Results are shown in the table below.

f. Assay cut-off:
A total of 1,372 normal sera were used to determine the percentile cut-off in increments of
1/1000th for each analyte. Based on a retrospective selection of around the 98th percentile, the
relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) corresponding to the chosen cutoff was assigned a value of
1.0 antibody index (AI), and subsequently evaluated for performance against clinically
diagnosed samples. The statistics show that the 98th percentile cut-off meets the minimum
agreement specifications while maximizing the clinical specificity. The assay employs an
equivocal zone that brackets the cut-off (0.9-1.0 AI), with samples ≥1.1 AI reported as reactive
and ≤0.8 AI reported as non-reactive.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Prospective Study: Performance of the BioPlex 2200 Lyme Total kit was evaluated using
prospectively collected serum samples from patients submitted for Lyme disease testing
originating from various geographically distinct locations in the U. S. A total of 792 serum
samples were evaluated at three (3) U. S. clinical testing sites. Equivoal (Eqv.) samples are
added to positives for calculating agreement results since they will be tested by the second tier
Western blot. Results are shown in the table below.

b. Matrix comparison:
Matched serum and plasma (EDTA and heparin) samples drawn from the same donor were
acquired through a vendor. Paired serum and plasma samples were prepared and values within
the measurement range of the assay were analyzed. Samples were spiked with high titer Lyme
samples to obtain concentrations that span the assay range. Samples were assayed in replicates of
two with the second replicate run in reverse order. Mean plasma AI values were compared to
matched mean serum AI values. Linear regression analysis was used to determine the presence
of a matrix effect when compared to serum. The regression correlation parameters for slope,
intercept and correlation coefficient (r) are shown below.

Correlation with CDC Panel: A panel of 280 positive and negative specimens from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was tested for the presence of Lyme antibodies using
the BioPlex 2200 Lyme Total kit. The results are presented as a means to convey further
information on the performance of the BioPlex 2200 Lyme Total kit with a masked,
characterized serum panel. This does not imply an endorsement of the BioPlex 2200 Lyme Total

Expected Values: The BioPlex 2200 Lyme Total kit was used to test 836 serum samples
from apparently healthy subjects from both endemic and non-endemic regions and 792
test ordered samples from endemic regions in the U. S. The asymptomatic endemic
population included 158 males ranging in age from 16 to 89 yrs. and 262 females ranging
in age from 11 to 85 yrs. The asymptomatic non-endemic population included 139 males
ranging in age from 3 to 91 yrs. and 275 females ranging in age from 13 to 95 yrs. with 2
samples of unknown age and gender. The test ordered endemic population included
samples with de-identified patient data. The test results are presented in the following
table.
