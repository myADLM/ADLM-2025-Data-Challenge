L. Test Principle:
The Ammonia II assay is an enzymatic method, with glutamate dehydrogenase. Glutamate
dehydrogenase (GLDH) catalyzes the reductive amination of 2‑oxoglutarate with NH4+ and
NADPH to form glutamate and NADP+. The concentration of the NADP+ formed is
directly proportional to the ammonia concentration. It is determined by measuring the
decrease in absorbance. Ammonia concentrations can be reported in conventional (µg/dL)
or International System (µmol/L) units, the conversion factor is: μmol/L × 1.703 = μg/dL.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision measurements were conducted to evaluate repeatability (within-run
precision) and the intermediate precision (within-laboratory precision) according to
the CLSI EP05-A3 guideline. The testing was performed over 21 days, with two
separate runs per day and two replicate measurements per run resulting in a total n of
84. Two levels of control and 5 human plasma samples were evaluated. The results
are summarized in the tables below:
Repeatability Summary:
samples Mean (µmol/L) SD (µmol/L) CV (%)
AEC- Control N 66.6 1.40 2.1
AEC-Control A 243 3.45 1.4
Human Plasma 1 26.0 1.26 4.8
Human Plasma 2 57.7 1.63 2.8
Human Plasma 3 110 1.62 1.5
Human Plasma 4 492 4.12 0.8
Human Plasma 5 868 9.54 1.1
Intermediate Precision:
samples Mean (µmol/L) SD (µmol/L) CV (%)
AEC-Control N 67.9 1.61 2.4
AEC-Control P 243 4.26 1.8
Human Plasma 1 26.0 1.29 4.9
Human Plasma 2 57.7 1.72 3.0
Human Plasma 3 110 1.92 1.7
Human Plasma 4 480 6.30 1.3
Human Plasma 5 853 12.4 1.5
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated in accordance with the CLSI EP-06A guideline. 18 levels
were prepared using a human plasma samples pool with ammonia concentration
above the upper measuring range. The mean of 3 replicates was used to evaluate
linearity at each level using 3 reagent lots. The range of samples tested was 0-1089
µmol/L.
Linear regression of one representative lot produced the following result:
y = 1.003x – 2.19 r2 = 0.9999

The results of the linearity study support the claimed measuring range of 10-1000
µmol/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This method has been standardized against an internal gravimetrically prepared
primary standard.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) of
the Ammonia II assay were evaluated in accordance with the CLSI EP17-A2
guideline.
LoB study was performed with one analyte-free sample tested over 3 days using
three reagent lots in 10-fold determination for a total 60 measurements per lot, on
one cobas c 501 analyzer. Data analysis was based on determination of the 95th
percentile of the 60 measured values. The LoB was determined to be 1.80 µmol/L.
The LoD study was performed with five low analyte samples which were tested over
3 days using 3 reagents lots in two-fold determination in 6 runs on one cobas c 501
analyzer for a total of 60 measurements per lot. The LoD was determined as the
lowest amount of analytes that can be detected with a 95% probability. The LoD was
determined to be 3.46 µmol/L.
The LoQ study a low-level sample set was prepared by diluting 7 human samples.
These 7 human plasma samples were tested for 5 days, one run per day in 5
replicates per sample, with three reagent lots on one cobas 501 analyzer instrument.
LoQ was determined to be 9.36 µmol/L based on total precision (≤20).
The LoB, LoD and LoQ results are summarized below:
LoB LoD LoQ
1.80 µmol/L 3.46 µmol/L 9.36 µmol/L
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference was evaluated according to the CLSI EP07-A2 guideline. The sponsor
defined interference as bias exceeding ±5 µmol/L for samples with ammonia levels
≤50 µmol/L or 10% for samples with ammonia levels >50 mmol/L, where bias is
calculated as the difference in results between the control sample (without interferent)
and the test sample (contains the interferent).

The results obtained by linear regression analysis are summarized below:
y = 1.001x – 1.90 μmol/L, r = 1.000
b. Matrix comparison:
To demonstrate equivalence between K2-EDTA and K3-EDTA anticoagulants, 52
matched plasma samples were obtained and tested using the Ammonia II reagent on
the cobas c 501. The linear regression is summarized below:
y = 1.005x – 1.39 µmol/L, r = 1.000
The study results support the sponsor’s claim that human K2-EDTA and K3-EDTA
plasma are acceptable sample types to be used with this assay.
