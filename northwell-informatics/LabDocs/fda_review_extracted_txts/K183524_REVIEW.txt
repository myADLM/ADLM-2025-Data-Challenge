I. Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each
VITEK 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium
is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials
combined with the nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized
concentration with 0.45% to 0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial
medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System will automatically dilute the bacterial
suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then the VITEK 2 will fill, seal
and place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling,
sealing, and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the
card over a defined period of time (up to 24 hours for Streptococcus species). The analysis
program determines when a well demonstrates growth based on attenuation of light measured
by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration
or “MIC” values for the anti-microbial agent. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a
report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for
each antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-GN Delafloxacin has the following concentrations in the card: 0.06, 0.25, 0.5,
and 2 µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL). The
Delafloxacin MIC result ranges for the VITEK 2 are:
· ≤ 0.06 – ≥ 4 µg/mL for Enterobacteriaceae
· ≤ 0.125 - ≥ 4 µg/mL for Pseudomonas aeruginosa

L. Test Principle:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection
using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems uses
visible light to directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells.
Transmittance optics is based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth
has begun. Every 15 minutes throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based
on the VITEK 2 card), light transmittance readings of each well measures organism growth
by the amount of light that is prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of
the incubation period, the MIC values and their associated interpretive category results for
each antimicrobial on the test card are displayed in an automatically generated report.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study for the VITEK 2 AST-GN card with Delafloxacin was
conducted at three external clinical sites using a panel of ten isolates of Gram-
negative bacilli consistent with the indications for use. Testing was performed on
three separate days and in triplicate for a total of 270 data points. The isolates
tested in the reproducibility study included five Klebsiella pneumoniae
pneumoniae, two E. cloacae, and three P. aeruginosa isolates. Inocula were
prepared using both the auto-dilution and manual dilution methods for testing in
the VITEK 2 System. In addition, inocula were prepared by the manual dilution
method only for use with the VITEK 2 Compact. The mode MIC value was
determined and the reproducibility was calculated based on MIC values that fell
within +/- one doubling dilution from the mode MIC value. The majority of data
points were on-scale and within ± one doubling dilution agreement as compared
to the mode MIC. Two data points were off-scale when tested by the VITEK 2
and the VITEK 2 Compact. The data was analyzed taking into consideration best
case and worst case scenarios as described in the Class II Special Controls
Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems. The
reproducibility performance is shown in Table 2.

Quality Control (QC) Testing
The CLSI recommended QC organisms (E. coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa ATCC 27853) were tested using both the VITEK 2 card and the reference
method at each site. Both the automatic dilution and manual dilution methods were
used for the VITEK 2 and the manual dilution method was used for the VITEK 2
Compact.
As shown in Table 3, both the auto-dilution and the manual dilution methods for
VITEK 2 and the manual dilution for VITEK 2 Compact were within the expected
range >95% of the time.

The CLSI Delafloxacin expected ranges for E. coli ATCC 25922 and P. aeruginosa
ATCC 27853 are 0.008 – 0.03 and 0.12 – 0.5 µg/mL respectively. However, the
VITEK 2 MIC reporting range is ≤0.06 – ≥4 µg/mL (MIC results: ≤0.06, 0.12, 0.25,
0.5, 1, 2, ≥4 µg/mL) for Enterobacteriaceae and ≤0.12 – ≥4 µg/mL (MIC results:
≤0.12, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, ≥4 µg/mL) for P. aeruginosa. The two recommended QC
strains tested provided off-scale with the VITEK 2 card as the acceptable ranges are
lower than the lowest concentration on the card (0.06 µg/mL for Enterobacteriaceae
and 0.12 µg/mL for P. aeruginosa). The quality control test results were considered
acceptable for both QC strains when the MIC value of ≤0.06 µg/mL was obtained for
E. coli ATCC 25922 and ≤0.12 µg/mL for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Given this,
bioMérieux included the following footnote indicating that QC for delafloxacin is off-
scale:
VITEK 2 AST-GN Delafloxacin does not include the full CLSI/FDA recommended
dilution range for QC testing with this organism.
However, during this study, all VITEK QC results for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853
were either at 0.5 or 0.25 µg/mL and none gave a value of ≤0.12µg/mL (See Table 3).
In addition, bioMérieux includes the CLSI broth microdilution expected range in the
labeling when the VITEK 2 system range is not aligned with that of the FDA/CLSI
range. The additional information is acceptable.
Inoculum Density Control
The DensiCHEK Plus was used to standardize the inoculum to a 0.5 McFarland
standard. The instrument was standardized daily with all results recorded at each site.
Calibration values were within the expected range.
Purity Check
A purity check of all organisms was performed on the dilution tube used to prepare
the VITEK 2 card inoculum. Only those cultures that were pure were evaluated in the
study.
Growth Failure Rate
There was one isolate that failed to grow in the VITEK 2 card in the clinical study.
Complete test results were available for 403 isolates from a total of 404 clinical
isolates. The growth failure rate was 0.25% and was acceptable.
A challenge set of 206 isolates was evaluated at one site. All 206 challenge organisms
grew in the VITEK 2 GN card with Delafloxacin using both the auto-dilution and
manual dilution methods for the VITEK 2 and manual inoculation for the VITEK 2
Compact System.
A total of 609 VITEK 2 AST results were available.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Testing of delafloxacin on the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card was performed at
three external sites and on internal site using VITEK 2 Systems (PC) version 9.02.
Results obtained with the bioMérieux VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card with
Delafloxacin were compared to results obtained with the CLSI broth microdilution
reference panel. The following concentrations of Delafloxacin are contained in the
VITEK 2 AST-GN test card: 0.06, 0.25, 0.5, and 2 µg/mL. However, the reporting
range is ≤ 0.06 – ≥4 μg/mL for Enterobacteriaceae and ≤ 0.12 – ≥4 μg/mL for
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The reference panel contained two-fold serial dilutions
with a range of ≤ 0.0039 to ≥16 µg/mL. The testing conditions for the reference
method consisted of the following:
· Medium – Mueller Hinton broth with appropriate dilutions of antimicrobial
solution added
· Inoculum – Direct colony suspension
· Incubation – 35°C ambient air incubator; 16-20 hours
The VITEK 2 AST cards were inoculated with test organisms using the auto-dilution
method (VITEK 2 System) and using the manual dilution method (VITEK 2 System
and VITEK 2 Compact). All test inocula used for the VITEK 2 AST cards and the
reference method were standardized using the DensiCHEK Plus instrument.
A total of 404 clinical isolates were evaluated at three sites with VITEK 2 AST –
Gram Negative cards inoculated by automatic dilution and interpreted using the
VITEK 2 instrument. There was one isolate that did not grow in the studies and was
excluded from the study. The no growth rate was 0.25% (1/404). Most isolates were
recently isolated from clinical specimen (270 isolates, 66.8%). The remainder were
stock isolates (134 isolates, 33.2%). The clinical study included several species within
Enterobacteriaceae that were not indicated in the FDA drug label for delafloxacin.
A total of 206 challenge organisms (147 Enterobacteriaceae and 59 P. aeruginosa)
Page 8of 13

--- Page 9 ---
were evaluated at one site. The challenge set was tested with the auto-dilution and
manual dilution options of the VITEK 2 System and with the manual dilution method
on the VITEK 2 Compact System. Challenge isolates included E. cloacae (18
isolates), E. coli (12 isolates), K. pneumoniae pneumoniae (14 isolates), K.
pneumoniae (103 isolates), and P. aeruginosa (59 isolates).
The combined data set of clinical and challenge isolates included 609 AST results
(428 Enterobacteriaceae and 181 P. aeruginosa). A total of 289 (47.4%) resistant
isolates were tested among the clinical (n=130) and challenge (n=159) isolates. A
sufficient number of resistant isolates from the indicated species were included.
The overall performance using the auto-dilution method of the VITEK 2 System
demonstrated an EA of 98.0% and a CA of 95.9%. There were two major errors
(2/291 susceptible isolates, 0.7% error rate) and 23 minor errors (23/609 total isolates,
3.7% error rate). The major error and minor error rates were acceptable. With
Enterobacteriaceae isolates, performance was acceptable with an EA of 98.6% and a
CA of 96.0%. With P. aeruginosa isolates, performance was acceptable with an EA
of 96.7% and a CA of 95.6%. The performance based on combined clinical and
challenge data was acceptable. The overall performance is shown in Table 4. In
addition, there was no significant difference in performance between indicated
organisms only when compared to performance of all Enterobacteriaceae isolates
tested (Tables 4.1 and 4.2).
To address testing of non-indicated species the sponsor included the following
statement in the Precautions section of the device labeling:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the
safety and efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility
is tested by this AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate
and well-controlled clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to
microorganisms outside of those found in the indications and usage in the drug
label. The clinical significance of susceptibility information in those instances is
unknown. The approved labeling for specific antimicrobial drugs provides the
uses for which the antimicrobial drug is approved.

Challenge Data – Auto and Manual Dilution
The challenge data set was evaluated at one site with both the auto-dilution and
manual dilution options of the VITEK 2 System and with the manual dilution method
on the VITEK 2 Compact System. The performance was acceptable. Overall
performance is shown in Table 5, and performances with P. aeruginosa and
Enterobacteriaceae isolates are shown in Table 6 and Table 7, respectively.

MIC Trends:
An analysis of trending was conducted using the combined clinical and challenge data
for each organism group. This trending calculation considers MIC values that are
determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or higher compared to the
reference method regardless of whether the device MIC values are on-scale. Results

that are not clearly at least one dilution lower, at least one dilution higher or in exact
agreement with the CLSI reference method are not considered in the trending
analysis.
Trending analysis results are shown in Table 8; results were stratified by species to
assess species-related trends. Species for which the difference between the percentage
of isolates with higher or lower readings was ≥30 with a statistically significant
confidence interval were considered to show evidence of trending. Trending that
provides higher or lower MIC values compared to the reference method is addressed
in labeling.
There was no trending noted for P. aeruginosa, however, when Enterobacteriaceae
species were analyzed separately and combined, trends for higher MIC values
compared to the reference were observed (Table 8). The following footnote was
added to the performance table in the package insert to address trending:
MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or at least one doubling dilution
higher when Enterobacteriaceae isolates compared to the reference micro-
dilution.
