Amplification reactions are prepared using the TruArray® Warfarin Sensitivity Test Kit
components (TruPlex Master Mix, TruPlex Warfarin Primer Mix and Formamide
(deionized)) and extracted gDNA. Amplification reactions are loaded into the inlet port on
the TruArray® Test Slide.
PCR amplification and microarray hybridization occur simultaneously in the same reaction
chamber in the TruArray® Warfarin Test Slide on the ProFlex™ PCR System using the
ProFlex™ 2x Flat Sample Block provided by Akonni with the TruDiagnosis® System. DNA
is amplified and hybridized using a specified thermal cycling protocol. After the
amplification and hybridization process, the array is washed by piercing the inlet port with a
pipettor tip and dispensing 1000 μL of the TruArray® Wash Buffer through the chamber.
The excess PCR amplicons, reaction by-products, and the wash buffer are retained on-slide
in the integrated waste chamber. The TruArray® Test Slide is placed in a 50 mL conical tube
and centrifuged at 540 x g for 2 minutes in a non-refrigerated centrifuge to dry the array
chamber prior to imaging.
The TruArray® Tests Slides are prepared using TruArray® microarray technology. The
TruArray® is a spatially ordered array of three-dimensional hydrogel droplets, each droplet
containing a unique capture probe. The hydrogel matrix is covalently attached to a glass
substrate and oligonucleotide probes are covalently attached to the hydrogel scaffold. The
purpose of the TruArray® is to specifically detect fluorescently labeled target amplicons via
microarray-based hybridization.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility of the TruDiagnosis® System was evaluated at three sites (two
external and one internal) over 5 days. Eight saliva samples from each of six donors
covering all possible genotypes for all three alleles in the TruDiagnosis® System
were collected using the Oragene® Dx OGD-500 collection device. Using saliva
from two collection tubes per donor, DNA was extracted using the Qiagen QIAamp
DSP DNA Mini Kit in triplicate for five non-consecutive days by each of four
operators (15 replicates per operator per genotype) for a total of 60 replicates per
donor/genotype. Four operators performed the reproducibility study across the three
sites using four lots of TruArray® Warfarin Sensitivity Test Kit reagents and three
TruDx® 2000 Imagers. Results from the TruDiagnosis® System were compared to
the genotype for each sample as determined by bidirectional Sanger sequencing.

d. Detection limit:
An upper and lower limit of detection study was performed to assess the genotyping
performance of the TruDiagnosis® System across a range of genomic DNA input
concentrations. Serial dilutions (125, 25, 2.5, 0.25 ng) of three genomic DNA samples
of different genotypes extracted using the Qiagen QIAamp DSP DNA Mini Kit from
saliva samples collected using the Oragene® Dx OGD-500 device were assayed 40
times using the TruDiagnosis® System. Seven operators performed the testing over
12 days using five reagent lots of the TruArray® Warfarin Sensitivity Test Kit and
three TruDx® 2000 Imagers. Results from the TruDiagnosis® System were
compared to the genotype for each sample as determined by bidirectional Sanger
sequencing. Results are as summarized in the table below.
The recommended DNA input for the TruDiagnosis® System is 25 ng at a
concentration of 5 ng/µL. The package insert states:
• “The recommended DNA input is 25 ng at a concentration of 5 ng/µL”
• “Failure to provide 25 ng purified gDNA may generate invalid test results.
Samples with DNA concentrations less than 2.5 ng may generate incorrect
results”
e. Analytical specificity:
An evaluation of potential assay interferences was performed to assess the
genotyping performance of the TruDiagnosis® System, when potential
interferents are present in saliva samples.
Endogenous Interferents
Five donors provided saliva samples collected using the Oragene® Dx collection
device OGD-500. Each saliva sample was divided into five aliquots and spiked
with one of four potentially interfering substances. The fifth aliquot was not
spiked with any potentially interfering substance and served as a control. Three
extractions using the Qiagen QIAamp DSP DNA Mini Kit were performed on
each sample.
The genotypes as determined by bidirectional Sanger sequencing for the five
donors were as follows:

Results from the testing are summarized below. There was 100% agreement
between the TruDiagnosis® System and bidirectional DNA sequencing for all test
substances following a first run, or a second run for no calls observed during the
first run, supporting that these interfering substances have no effect on
genotyping.

Exogenous Interferents
Potentially interfering exogenous substances (eating, drinking, chewing gum,
mouthwash and smoking) introduced into saliva samples collected using the
Oragene® Dx collection device OGD-500 through various activities were tested.
Each activity group was composed of five donors who each provided two
samples: a baseline/control sample prior to the activity, and a sample collected 30
minutes after the activity. DNA was extracted using the Qiagen QIAamp DSP
DNA Mini Kit. Samples were tested in triplicate. Results from the TruDiagnosis®
System were compared to the genotype for each sample as determined by
bidirectional Sanger sequencing.
Results from the testing are summarized below. There was 100% agreement
between the TruDiagnosis® System and bidirectional DNA sequencing for all
activities following a first run, or a second run for no calls observed during the
first run, supporting that these activities have no effect on genotyping after 30
minutes.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison:
The method comparison evaluation was performed to assess the genotyping accuracy
of the TruDiagnosis® System as compared to bi-directional DNA sequencing.
Testing was conducted at one site (internal site). The test panel for the method
comparison study consisted of 303 unique human genomic DNA samples isolated
from saliva specimens collected using the Oragene® Dx OGD-500 device. DNA was
extracted using the Qiagen QIAamp DSP DNA Mini Kit.
The study was performed by four operators using four lots of the TruArray®
Warfarin Sensitivity Test Kit and four TruDx® 2000 Imagers over 14 testing days.
The samples were typically run for their first-pass call in batches of 16 samples
including 13 test samples, a negative extraction control, a positive PCR control and
negative PCR control. An additional run was performed for tests that gave a first-pass
no-call result.
