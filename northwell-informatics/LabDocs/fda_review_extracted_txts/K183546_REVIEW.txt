H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The GEM Premier ChemSTAT is a portable critical care system for use by health care
professionals to rapidly analyze lithium heparinized whole blood samples at the point of
health care delivery in a clinical setting and in a central laboratory. The instrument provides
quantitative measurements of Glucose (Glu), Lactate (Lac), Hematocrit (Hct), pH and
partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) from arterial and venous heparinized whole
blood. These parameters, along with derived parameters, aid in the diagnosis of a patient’s
acid/base status and metabolite balance.
• Glucose (Glu) measurement is used in the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of
carbohydrate metabolism disturbances including diabetes mellitus, neonatal hypoglycemia,
idiopathic hypoglycemia, and of pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.
• Lactate (Lac) measurement is used to evaluate the acid-base status of patients suspected of
having lactic acidosis, to monitor tissue hypoxia and strenuous physical exertion, and in
the diagnosis of hyperlactatemia.
• Hematocrit (Hct) measurements in whole blood of the packed red cell volume of a blood
sample are used to distinguish normal from abnormal states, such as anemia and
erythrocytosis (an increase in the number of red cells).
• pH and pCO2 measurements in whole blood are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
life-threatening acid-base disturbances.

L. Test Principle:
Glucose and Lactate
The Glucose and Lactate sensors are amperometric biosensors consisting of a platinum
electrode operated at a positive potential with respect to the card reference electrode. Glu or
Lac determination is accomplished by enzymatic reaction of Glu or Lac with oxygen in the
presence of glucose oxidase or lactate oxidase and the electrochemical oxidation of the
resulting hydrogen peroxide (H O ) at the platinum electrode. The current flow between the
2 2
platinum electrode and the ground electrode is proportional to the rate at which H2O2
molecules diffuse to the platinum and are oxidized, which in turn is directly proportional to the
metabolite (Glu or Lac) concentration.
Hematocrit
Hct is measured by an electrical conductivity technique. The conductivity technique is based
on the principle that because plasma is more conductive than blood cells due to the high
resistance of the cell membranes, the resistivity of blood will increase as the concentration of
cells increases.

pH
The pH sensors are based on the principle of ion selective electrodes in which electrical
potential can be established across a membrane resulting from chemical selectivity of the
membrane to a specific ion. The potential can be described by this simplified form of the
Nernst equation E=E’ +(S x Log C), where E is the electrode potential, E’ is the standard
potential for that membrane, S is the sensitivity (slope), and C is the ion activity. E’ and S can
be determined by the sensor response to the Process Control (PC) Solutions, and the equation
can be solved for the activity of the ion of interest.
pCO2
The pCO2 sensor is a patented design that relies on generated potential of the bicarbonate
sensor versus the pH sensor. The potential difference between the two sensors is related to the
logarithm of pCO2 content in the sample.

ii. External Reproducibility Study with Aqueous Controls -Point-of-Care Setting:
An external reproducibility study was performed in 3 clinical point of care sites
using aqueous control solutions. Testing was performed by 9 different operators on
six different GEM Premier ChemSTAT analyzers, using a single lot of GEM
Premier CHEMSTAT PAK’s cartridges. Each site tested quality control materials
for each analyte with two levels of GEM ChemSTAT CVP and 4 to 5 levels of GEM
ChemSTAT PVP. Each control was tested in triplicate, twice a day for five days for
a total of 30 replicates per level with n= 90 data sets across all three sites per analyte
per control level. Individual POC site statistics were analyzed by two-way nested
ANOVA with factors day and run nested within day. Multisite statistics were
determined via three-way nested ANOVA with the factors being site, day and nested
within site and run nested within site and day.
The results are summarized in the table below for all 3 sites POC sites.

iii. External Precision - Whole Blood
A precision study was performed at 3 external clinical point-of care (POC) sites,
using 5 whole blood patient samples for over 5 days, by 6 different operators on 3
GEM Premier ChemSTAT instruments (one analyzer per site), using a single lot of
GEM Premier ChemSTAT PAKs (cartridges). Reproducibility was not assessed for
whole blood samples because samples at each clinical site are unique. Each whole
blood patient sample was run in triplicate on a single GEM Premier ChemSTAT
instrument.
The results are summarized in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed following CLSI EP06-A guidelines. Nine to ten levels
per analyte were prepared by tonometry, spiking or diluting whole blood samples to
challenge the claimed measuring ranges. Each level was analyzed in triplicate on six
GEM Premier ChemSTAT analyzers, with three different cartridges for all analytes
except for pH and pCO2 which were tested on three GEM Premier ChemSTAT
analyzers and results compared to reference analyzers.
The results are summarized in the table below:
Linear regression Sample range Claimed Measuring
Analyte R2
Equation tested Range
Glucose y = 1.023x – 0.502 1.00 3-749 mg/dL 4-685 mg/dL
Lactate y = 1.004x + 0.000 0.9998 0.2-17.8 mmol/L 0.3-17.0 mmol/L
Hct y = 0.984x + 1.909 0.9975 13-74 % 15-72%
pH y = 1.006x – 0.042 0.9996 6.76-8.10 7.00-8.00
pCO y = 1.030x – 0.843 0.9994 2-137 mmHg 6-125 mmHg
2
The results of the linearity study support the claimed measuring range as described in
the table above.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Glucose is traceable by automated spectrophotometry using hexokinase method per CDC
no. 77-8660 using secondary standard prepared from NIST #917.
Lactate traceability is established by automated spectrophotometry using lactate oxidase
with secondary standard prepared from USP #1614308.
pCO traceability is established through tonometry at 37°C using NIST traceable gas
2
mixtures.
pH traceability is established through a direct potentiometry method which uses
secondary standards prepared from NIST SRM 186I & 186II phosphate salts.
Hematocrit traceability is established by centrifugation using whole blood per CLSI H7-
A3 for establishing true correlation. Maintained from lot to lot by controlling
conductivity through controlling sodium level.

d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were
evaluated in accordance to CLSI EP17-A2 guideline, for Glu, Lac, Hct, pH, and pCO .
2
The LoB was assessed by testing blank samples on 3 days with 3 different cartridge lots
(N=60/analyte/lot). After recording 60 blank sample measurements, the results were
ranked from lowest to highest. LoB was independently calculated for each lot using the
non-parametric method.
The LoD was determined by testing low-level samples over three days using three
cartridge lots on three analyzers. The LoB used for LoD calculation is the maximum
value across the three cartridge lots. The is calculated using the formula:
LoD = LoB + *SD
L
Where:
L = total number of all low-level sample results across all cartridge lots
J= number of low level samples (number of days)
The LoQ was assessed by testing low-level whole blood samples. Sixty replicates of the
low-level samples were measured per day on 3 analyzers (N=60/analyte/day) using 3
reagent lots. The LoQ is defined as the lowest concentration at which measured total
error is less than the pre-defined total error of ± 6 mg/dL for glucose, ± 0.4 mmol/L for
lactate, ±4% for hematocrit and ±5 mmHg for pCO . Total error (TE) for low level
2
sample was calculated using the following formula:
TE = ǀ(meanGEM Premier ChemSTAT – meanPredicate Device)ǀ + 1.96 * SDLow Level
The results are summarized in the table below

Linearity studies were used to support the lower end of the measuring range for pH (see
section M.1.b above).
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was performed based on CLSI EP17-A guideline. The interference
testing was conducted using whole blood samples at two different analyte concentrations.
Substances were considered not interfering if the difference between the test and control
samples was less than or equal to the following clinically significant interference limits
set for each analyte:
