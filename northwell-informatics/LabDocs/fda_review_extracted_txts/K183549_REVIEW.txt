H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indication(s) for Use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The GEM Premier ChemSTAT is a portable critical care system for use by health care
professionals to rapidly analyze lithium heparinized whole blood samples at the point of
health care delivery in a clinical setting and in a central laboratory. The instrument
provides quantitative measurements of sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), ionized calcium
(Ca++) and chloride (Cl-) from arterial and venous heparinized whole blood. These
parameters, along with derived parameters, aid in the diagnosis of a patient’s electrolyte
balance.
Electrolytes in the human body have multiple roles. Nearly all metabolic processes
depend on or vary with electrolytes:
• Sodium (Na+) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
aldosteronism, diabetes insipidus, adrenal hypertension, Addison’s disease,
dehydration, inappropriate antidiuretic secretion, or other diseases involving
electrolyte imbalance.
• Potassium (K+) measurements are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the diagnosis
and treatment of disease conditions characterized by low or high blood potassium
levels.
• Ionized calcium (Ca++) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
parathyroid disease, a variety of bone diseases, chronic renal disease and tetany.
• Chloride (Cl-) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of electrolyte
and metabolic disorders, such as, cystic fibrosis and diabetic acidosis.

--- Page 3 ---
The GEM Premier ChemSTAT analyzer has the internal logic and processing power
necessary to perform analysis. It employs a unique touch-sensitive color screen and a simple
set of menus and buttons for user interaction. The analyzer guides operators through the
sampling process with simple, clear messages and prompts.
The disposable, multi-use GEM Premier ChemSTAT PAK is a completely closed cartridge
that houses all components necessary to operate the instrument once the GEM PAK is
validated. These components include the sensors, Process Control (PC) solutions, sampler,
and waste bag. The values of all PC solutions are read from the GEM PAK Electronically
Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM) chip. The components and
processes used to manufacture the PC Solutions in the GEM PAK are traceable to National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards, Clinical & Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) procedures or other internal standards, where available and
appropriate. The GEM Premier ChemSTAT PAK has flexible menus to assist facilities in
maximizing efficiency. As part of this program, GEM ChemSTAT CVP (Calibration
Valuation Products) are external solutions intended to complete the calibration process and
final accuracy assessment of the iQM cartridge calibration following warm-up.
Intelligent Quality Management (iQM) is used as the quality control and assessment system
for the GEM Premier ChemSTAT system. iQM is an active quality process control program
designed to provide continuous monitoring of the analytical process before and after sample
measurement with real-time, automatic error detection, automatic correction and automatic
documentation of all corrective actions. iQM performs 4 types of continuous, quality checks
to monitor the performance of the GEM PAK, sensors, and reagents throughout the cartridge
use-life. These checks include System, Sensor, Pattern Recognition (PR) and Stability
Checks.

L. Test Principle:
The electrolyte sensors (Na+, K+, Ca++ and Cl-) are based on the principle of ion- selective
electrodes in which electrical potential can be established across a membrane resulting from
chemical selectivity of the membrane to a specific ion. The potential can be described by
this simplified form of the Nernst equation E=E’ +(S * Log C), where E is the electrode
potential, E’ is the standard potential for that membrane, S is the sensitivity (slope), and C is
the ion activity. E’ and S can be determined by the sensor response to the Process Control
Solutions, and the equation can be solved for the activity of the ion of interest. The
electrolyte sensors are polyvinyl chloride (PVC) based ion selective electrodes, consisting of
an internal Ag/AgCl reference electrode and an internal electrolyte layer. Their potentials are
measured against the card reference electrode (Ag/ Ag+).
The card reference consists of an Ag/Ag+ electrode with an open liquid junction between the
silver electrode and the sensor chamber. Every time a sample is pumped into the sensor
chamber, fresh reference solution containing silver nitrate flows into the reference chamber
and comes in contact with the sample. This process provides a stable and reliable liquid
junction potential independent of the sample composition.

instrument. At each site a minimum of twenty two whole blood samples were
analyzed to cover the medical decision levels. Reproducibility was not assessed for
whole blood samples. Due to the use of unique whole blood samples at each clinical
site, only repeatability was evaluated. The assessment of precision is based on a
pooled analysis of the imprecision of a minimum of twenty individual samples per
site, as shown below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was conducted for each analyte following the CLSI EP06-A
guideline. Nine levels per analyte were prepared by spiking or diluting whole blood
to challenge the claimed reportable range for Na+, K+, Ca++ and Cl-. Each blood level
was analyzed in triplicate on six GEM Premier ChemSTAT test analyzers (N=18) and
results compared to the reference analyzer. The summary results are shown below.
The lower limits of the claimed reportable ranges were determined based on the
combined data from limit of quantitation and linearity studies.

The linear regression results support the claimed measuring ranges, as summarized in
the table above.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Na+ assay is traceable to a flame photometry reference method, which uses secondary
standards prepared from NIST SRM 919 sodium chloride salt.
K+ assay is traceable to a flame photometry methods, which uses secondary standards
prepared from NIST SRM 918 potassium chloride salt.
Ca++ assay is traceable to a direct potentiometry method that uses secondary standards
prepared from NIST SRM 915 calcium carbonate salt.
Cl- assay is traceable to a coulometric-amperometric titration with silver ion method
that uses secondary standards prepared from NIST SRM 919 sodium chloride salt.
The real time shelf life stability study and the in-use (cartridge use-life) stability study
was performed on three lots of GEM Premier ChemSTAT PAKs (cartridges). Based
on the results, the sponsor claims that the GEM Premier ChemSTAT PAKs has a
shelf life stability of five months when stored at 15°C to 25°C, and an in-use stability
of 450 samples or 21 days when stored on board the analyzer. The stability study
protocol and acceptance criteria were found to be adequate.
A transport simulation study was conducted to support the stability claim of the GEM
Premier ChemSTAT PAKs (cartridges) when exposed to transport conditions of 10°C
to 38°C and an altitude of 10,000 feet for three days.

d. Detection limit:
Detection limit studies were performed following the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
Limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were
established for Na+, K+, Ca++ and Cl-, using three lots of GEM Premier ChemSTAT
PAKs (cartridges) on three different GEM Premier ChemSTAT instruments.
Samples tested in these studies were lithium heparinized whole blood samples over
three day. The heparinized whole blood samples were prepared fresh each day.
LoB was determined by running three blank samples in sixty replicates per day over
three days using three cartridge lots on three analyzers. LoB was independently
calculated for each lot using the non-parametric method.
LoD was determine by running three low level samples in sixty replicates per day
over three days using three cartridge lots on three analyzers. The LoB used for LoD
calculation is the maximum value across the three cartridge lots. The is calculated
using the formula LoD = LoB + 1.645/[1-{1/(4(L-J))}] * SD , where L is the total
L
number of all low level sample results across all cartridge lots and J is the number of
low level samples (number of days). The maximal value of the LoDs obtained for the
three lots was determined to be the LoD of the device.
LoQ was determined by running low level samples in 60 replicates per day over three
days using three lots of cartridges on three analyzers. The LoQ is defined as the
lowest concentration at which measured total error is less than the pre-defined total
error of 5 mmol/L for sodium, 0.5 mmol/L for potassium, 0.10 mmol/L for ionized
calcium and 4 mmol/L for chloride. The total error TE is calculated as:
TE = [(mean – mean )] + 1.96 * SD

The combined summary results for LoB, LoD and LoQ are shown below.

e. Analytical specificity:
In accordance with CLSI EP07 3rd Edition, an interference study was conducted for
the Na+, K+, Ca++ and Cl- assays on three GEM Premier ChemSTAT analyzers using
heparinized whole blood at two levels of the analyte of interest. Interference effect
was calculated as the difference between the average test and average control
measurements across the three analyzers. Clinically non-significant interference limit
for each of the four assays is defined by the sponsor as:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was conducted at three external POC sites by at least two
POC operators at each site. Both arterial and venous whole blood samples were
tested in singlicate on one GEM Premier ChemSTAT analyzer and one GEM Premier
4000 analyzer for sodium, potassium, ionized calcium and chloride. Contrived
samples tested in the study were ≤8% of all the samples tested. For analytes with
constant SD (sodium), slope, intercept and correlation coefficient (R) were obtained
from the Deming regression method. For analytes with mixed variability, including
both constant SD and %CV ranges, (potassium, ionized calcium and chloride), slope,
intercept and correlation coefficient (R) were obtained from the Passing-Bablok
regression method. The summary results from the three sites are shown below:

3. Specimen Identification:
Specimens may be identified by scanning a barcode or by manually entering the
information via the touchscreen.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Lithium heparinized arterial and venous whole blood from syringes and open blood
collection tubes.
5. Calibration:
The disposable, multi-use GEM Premier ChemSTAT PAK is a completely closed
cartridge that houses all components necessary to operate the instrument once the GEM
PAK is validated. These components include the sensors, Process Control (PC)
solutions, sampler, and waste bag. The values of all PC Solutions are read from the GEM
PAK Electronically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM) chip. The
setup of the instrument consists of inserting the GEM PAK into the instrument. The
instrument will perform an automated PAK warm-up during which the sensors are

hydrated and a variety of checks occur, all of which take about 50 minutes. As part of
this program, 4-level GEM ChemSTAT CVP (Calibration Valuation Products) are
external solutions needed to complete the calibration process to validate the integrity of
the PC solutions and final accuracy assessment of the iQM cartridge calibration following
warm-up.
Following validation of the PAK, the sensors/analyte parameters are calibrated and
monitored with four Process Control (PC) solutions A, B, C, and D. Each PC solution
serves a specific function in the iQM process. The four PC solutions (A, B, C, and D) are
used continuously each day at defined frequency to confirm sensor PAK performance.
6. Quality Control:
Intelligent Quality Management (iQM) is used as the quality control and assessment
system for the GEM Premier ChemSTAT system. iQM is an active quality process
control program designed to provide continuous monitoring of the analytical process
before and after sample measurement with real-time, automatic error detection, automatic
correction of the system and automatic documentation of all corrective actions, replacing
the use of traditional external quality controls.
In the device labeling the sponsor states “Facilities should follow local, state and federal
regulatory guidelines to ensure that a total quality management system is followed.”
