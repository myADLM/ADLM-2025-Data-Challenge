I. Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated, and automated version of the
doubling dilution technique for determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC).
Each VITEK 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient
medium is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of
antimicrobials combined with the nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a
standardized concentration with 0.45% to 0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the
antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System will automatically dilute the
bacterial suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then the VITEK® 2 will
fill, seal and place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual
filling, sealing and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well
in the card over a defined period (up to 24 hours for Streptococcus species). The analysis
program determines when a well demonstrates growth based on attenuation of light measured
by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration
or MIC values for the anti-microbial agent. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a
report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for
each antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-GN Minocycline has the following concentrations in the card: 1, 4, 8, and 16
μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL). The MIC result
range for VITEK 2 AST-GN Minocycline on the VITEK 2 card is ≤ 0.5 – ≥ 32 μg/mL.

L. Test Principle:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection
using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics within the systems use
visible light to directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 microwells.
Transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth
has begun. Every 15 minutes throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based
on the VITEK 2 card), light transmittance readings of each well measures organism growth
by the amount of light that is prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of
the incubation period, the MIC values and their associated interpretive category results for
each antimicrobial on the test card are displayed in an automatically generated report.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study for the VITEK 2 AST-GN Minocycline was conducted at
three clinical sites using ten isolates from indicated species. Testing was performed
on three separate days and in triplicate for a total of 270 data points. The ten isolates
included Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumoniae (five isolates), Klebsiella pneumoniae
(one isolate), K. (Enterobacter) aerogenes (three isolates), and Escherichia coli (one
isolate). Inocula were prepared using both the auto-dilution and manual dilution
methods on the VITEK 2 System. Inocula were prepared using the manual dilution
method on the VITEK 2 Compact System. Intra-site and inter-site reproducibility was
calculated based on MIC values falling within +/- one doubling dilution from the
mode MIC value. Most of data points were on-scale and within ± one doubling
dilution agreement as compared to the mode MIC. For cases where off-scale values
were obtained reproducibility was calculated as best case and worst case as described
in the AST Special Controls Guidance Document.
The overall reproducibility of the VITEK 2 System was 100% (100% worst case) and
100% (99.63% worst case) using the auto-dilution and manual dilution inoculum
methods, respectively. All MIC results with the VITEK 2 Compact System using the
manual inoculation method were on-scale and the overall reproducibility was 100%.
The combined reproducibility results for all three sites were acceptable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality Control (QC) Testing
The FDA/CLSI recommended QC organism (E. coli ATCC 25922) was tested
throughout the comparative testing at three study sites. This QC organism was tested
a minimum of 20 times/site by both the VITEK 2 AST-GN Minocycline card and
with the CLSI broth microdilution reference method.
Both the auto-dilution and the manual dilution methods for VITEK 2 and the manual
dilution for VITEK 2 Compact gave the expected QC result >95% of the time.
Overall, QC performance was acceptable. The QC results are summarized in Table 1.

*The lowest dilution of the VITEK 2 AST-GN Minocycline MIC range is ≤0.5 µg/mL.
The expected range for E. coli ATCC 25922 with minocycline is 0.25 – 1 µg/mL;
however, the reporting range of the VITEK 2 AST-GN Minocycline is ≤ 0.5 - ≥ 32
μg/mL (MIC results: ≤ 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and ≥ 32) and does not provide results lower
than 0.5 μg/mL. All QC results for E. coli ATCC 25922 were off-scale for the VITEK
2 card at the ≤ 0.5 μg/mL dilution. The sponsor provided the following footnote to the
E. coli ATCC 25922 expected range in the device labeling QC table:
The FDA/CLSI Broth Microdilution expected QC range = 0.25 ‒ 1 µg/mL. Does
not include the full recommended dilution range for QC testing.
As an additional check of the reference method, two gram positive organisms were
tested throughout the study at each clinical site. Isolates tested were E. faecalis ATCC
29212 and S. aureus ATCC 29213. All results were within the expected range.
Inoculum Density Control
The DensiCHEK Plus was used to standardize the inoculum to a 0.5 MacFarland
standard. The instrument was standardized daily with all results recorded at each site.
Calibration values were within the expected range.
Purity Check
A purity check of all organisms was performed on the dilution tube used to prepare
the VITEK 2 card inoculum. Only those cultures that were pure were evaluated in the
study.
Growth Failure Rate
A total of 367 clinical isolates and 106 challenge isolates were evaluated. All isolates
grew in the VITEK 2 AST card. Therefore, a total of 473 isolates had VITEK 2 AST
results available.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Testing of minocycline on the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card was performed at
three external sites and one internal site using VITEK 2 Systems (PC) version 9.02.
Results obtained with the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card were compared to results
obtained with the CLSI broth microdilution reference method using direct colony
suspension inoculation. The reference panels were inoculated with test organisms and
incubated as outlined in the CLSI document M07-A10 at 35 ℃ for 16 – 20 hours for all
organisms other than Acinetobacter spp., or at 35 ℃ for 20 - 24 hours for all
Acinetobacter spp. organisms.
The VITEK 2 AST cards were inoculated with test organisms using the auto-dilution
method (VITEK 2 System) and using the manual dilution method (VITEK 2 System
and VITEK 2 Compact). All test inocula used for the VITEK 2 AST cards and the
reference method were standardized using the DensiCHEK Plus instrument.
A total of 367 clinical isolates were evaluated (331 Enterobacteriaceae and 36
Acinetobacter spp.). All 367 isolates grew, and complete results were available for all
isolates. A total of 238 (64.9%) isolates were fresh or recent isolates (tested within
one year of isolation from clinical specimens) and 129 (35.1%) were stock isolates.
The clinical study included species within Enterobacteriaceae that were not indicated
in the FDA drug label for minocycline.
A total of 106 challenge organisms (80 Enterobacteriaceae and 26 Acinetobacter
spp.) were evaluated at one external site. All isolates grew. The challenge set was
tested with both the auto-dilution and manual dilution options on the VITEK 2
System and with the manual dilution method on the VITEK 2 Compact System.
Challenge isolates included Acinetobacter spp. (26 isolates), E. coli (12 isolates), K.
(Enterobacter) aerogenes (9 isolates), and Klebsiella spp. (59 isolates).
The combined data set of clinical and challenge isolates included 473 AST results
(411 Enterobacteriaceae and 62 Acinetobacter spp.). A total of 112 (23.7%) resistant
8

--- Page 9 ---
isolates were tested among the clinical (n=56) and challenge (n=56) isolates.
The overall performance using the auto-dilution method of the VITEK 2 System
demonstrated an EA of 97.0% and a CA of 93.7%. There was one major error (1/361
susceptible isolates, 0.3% error rate), one very major error (1/112 resistant isolates,
0.9% error rate), and 28 minor errors (28/473 total isolates, 5.9% error rate). The
major error and very major error rates were acceptable. With Enterobacteriaceae
isolates, performance was acceptable with an EA of 97.6% and a CA of 93.7%. With
Acinetobacter spp. isolates, performance was acceptable with an EA of 93.5% and a
CA of 93.5%. The performance based on combined clinical and challenge data was
acceptable. The overall performance is shown in Table 2.
To address testing of non-indicated species the sponsor included the following
statement in the Precautions section of the device labeling:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the
safety and efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility
is tested by this AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate
and well-controlled clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to
microorganisms outside of those found in the indications and usage in the drug
label. The clinical significance of susceptibility information in those instances is
unknown. The approved labeling for specific antimicrobial drugs provides the
uses for which the antimicrobial drug is approved.

MIC Trends
An analysis of trending was conducted using the combined clinical and challenge data
for each organism group. This trending calculation considers MIC values that are
determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or higher compared to the
reference method regardless of whether the device MIC values are on-scale. Results
that are not clearly at least one dilution lower, at least one dilution higher or in exact
agreement with the CLSI reference method are not considered in the trending
analysis.
Trending analysis results are shown in Table 6; results were stratified by species to
assess species-related trends. Species for which the difference between the percentage
of isolates with higher or lower readings was ≥30 with a statistically significant
confidence interval were considered to show evidence of trending. Trending that
provides higher or lower MIC values compared to the reference method is addressed

When all species combined were assessed, no trending was observed overall. When
results were stratified by species, trends for lower MIC values compared to the
reference method were observed for E. coli and S. marcescens, and trends for higher
MIC values compared to the reference method were observed for K. oxytoca and C.
freundii (Table 6). The following footnote was added to performance table in the
package insert to address trending:
“VITEK 2 Minocycline MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or at least
one doubling dilution lower when testing E. coli and S. marcescens compared to
the reference broth micro-dilution. VITEK 2 Minocycline MIC values tended to be
in exact agreement or at least one doubling dilution higher when testing K.
oxytoca and C. freundii compared to the reference broth micro-dilution.”
