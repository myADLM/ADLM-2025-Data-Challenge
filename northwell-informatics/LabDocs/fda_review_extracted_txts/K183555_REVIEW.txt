H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The GEM Premier ChemSTAT analyzer is a portable system used by health care
professionals to analyze arterial and venous lithium heparinized whole blood samples for
creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and total carbon dioxide (tCO ) at point of care in
2
a clinical setting or at a central laboratory. These parameters, along with derived
parameters, aid in the diagnosis of a patient’s acid/base status and metabolite balance.
Creatinine measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of renal diseases and in
monitoring renal dialysis.
Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) or urea measurements are used for the diagnosis, monitoring
and treatment of certain renal and metabolic diseases.
Total carbon dioxide/tCO (also referred to as bicarbonate/HCO3-) is used in the
2
diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of patients’ acid/base status and metabolite balance.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only at point-of-care and central laboratory settings
4. Special instrument requirements:
GEM Premier ChemSTAT analyzer
I. Device Description:
The GEM Premier ChemSTAT system is a prescription-use-only, portable system used
by health care professionals to analyze arterial and venous lithium heparinized whole
blood samples at point-of-care or a central laboratory. The system has two primary
components: the GEM Premier ChemSTAT analyzer and a disposable, multiuse GEM
Premier ChemSTAT Cartridge/PAK (GEM PAK).
The GEM Premier ChemSTAT analyzer has the internal logic and processing power
necessary to perform analysis. It employs a touch-sensitive color screen and a set of
menus and buttons for user interaction.
The GEM Premier ChemSTAT PAK (or GEM PAK) is a disposable, multi-use PAK that
houses all components necessary to operate the instrument. These components include
the sensors, solutions, sampler, and waste bag. The GEM PAK enables analysis of 75 to
450 samples.

L. Test Principle:
Creatinine
The creatinine electrode measures a series of coupled enzymatic reactions involved in the
conversion of creatinine to hydrogen peroxide (shown below in equations 1-3). The creatine
electrode measures a series of coupled enzymatic reactions involved in the conversion of
creatine to hydrogen peroxide (shown below in Equations 2-3).

The hydrogen peroxide resulting from these reactions is oxidized at the platinum electrode
operated at a positive potential (shown above in Equation 4), with respect to the card
reference electrode. The oxidation current is proportional to the concentration of creatinine
and creatine in the sample.
BUN
The urea sensor consists of immobilized urease enzyme on a PVC-based ion selective
electrode, consisting of an internal Ag/AgCl reference electrode and an internal electrolyte
layer. The urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to ammonium ion. It is detected by an
ammonium-ion selective electrode. The sensor potential is measured against the card
reference electrode (Ag/Ag+) and is proportional to logarithm of urea concentration.
tCO
2
The sensor for HCO - relies on a pH selective polymer as a gas permeable outer membrane
3
and an internal bicarbonate buffer. The generated potential against the reference electrode is
related to the logarithm of bicarbonate in the sample, as described per the following
formula:
tCO = HCO -(m) + 0.03 * pCO

Precision studies were conducted following the CLSI EP05-A3 guideline.
Internal Precision Study – Whole Blood
An internal precision study was performed by testing samples of whole blood for
creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and total carbon dioxide. Samples were analyzed by
2 operators using 3 different GEM Premier ChemSTAT analyzers over 5 days. A
single run evaluating 8 replicates of 5 predetermined quantities per analyte (n=120
per level of analyte) was completed per day. The results of the precision study are
present in the table below:

External Reproducibility Study with Aqueous Controls – Point-of-Care Setting
A reproducibility study was performed at 3 external clinical point-of-care (POC) sites
by 9 different operators using a single lot of cartridges on 6 different analyzers. Each
site used the same lots of aqueous control materials. Each aqueous control level was
run in triplicate twice a day for 5 days, for a total of 30 replicates per level (N= 3 sites
x 5 days x 2 runs x 3 replicates = 90 per analyte/ per control level). Individual POC
site statistics were analyzed by two-way nested ANOVA with factors day and run
nested within day. Multisite statistics were determined via three-way nested ANOVA
with the factors being site, day and nested within site and run nested within site and
day. The pooled results of the study are present in the tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed following the CLSI EP06-A guideline. 9 levels per
analyte were prepared by spiking or diluting whole blood from healthy volunteers to
challenge the claimed measurement range for each analyte. At least 2 levels
exceeded the claimed measurement range at the low and high ends. Each blood level
was analyzed in triplicate on 6 different analyzers using cartridges from 3 different
production lots (N=18 per level). The observed values were plotted against the
expected values and linear regression analysis was performed. The results from a
representative lot for each analyte are present below. The results of the linear
regression analysis support the following claimed measuring ranges for the creatinine,
BUN, and tCO assays:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The traceability of the parameters measured by GEM Premier ChemSTAT are listed
below:
Creatinine: Traceable to NIST Standard 967a
BUN: Traceable to NIST SRM 912
tCO : Per CLSI guideline C46-A2, calculated from pH and pCO2 concentrations
2
of aqueous secondary standard.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ)
were determined according to CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
For LoB studies, 60 blank samples per cartridge lot were tested on 3 days with 3
different cartridge lots (N=60/analyte/lot). After recording 60 blank sample
measurements, the results were ranked from lowest to highest. The LoB was
determined as the maximal LoB value for each of the three cartridge lots per analyte.
The LoD was determined using a “low” sample with a target analyte concentration 1-
5x greater than the estimated LoB.
LoD = LoB + *SD

Where:
L = total number of all low level sample results across all cartridge lots
J= number of low level samples (number of days)
The LoQ was assessed by testing low-level whole blood samples. 60 replicates of the
low-level samples were measured per day by 3 analyzers (N=60/analyte/day). LoQ
was defined as the lowest concentration that met the total error goal of 0.3 mg/dL or
15% for creatinine, 2.0 mg/dL or 9% for BUN and 2.0 mmol/L or 10% for tCO2.
The overall results of LoB, LoD, and LoQ are summarized below:
Analyte LoB LoD LoQ Claimed Measuring Range
Creatinine (mg/dL) 0.04 0.07 0.10 0.20-15

e. Analytical specificity:
To determine the effects of potential endogenous and exogenous interference, the
sponsor conducted an analytical specificity study according to the CLSI EP07
guideline. Testing was conducted using whole blood samples at two different analyte
concentrations. Substances were considered not interfering if the difference between
the test and control samples was less than or equal to the following clinically
significant interference limits set for each analyte:
Analyte Clinically significant interference
Creatinine (mg/dL) < 0.20 mg/dL
BUN (mg/dL) < +10%
tCO (mmol/L) < +10%
2
Substances identified as interfering substances were further characterized to
determine the concentration that produces a clinically significant interference.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed at 3 external POC sites by 2 POC
operators at each site. Lithium heparinized whole blood samples were tested in
singlicate on a single GEM Premier ChemSTAT Analyzer. The same samples were
then centrifuged, and the plasma portions were tested in singlicate on 2 Roche Cobas
analyzers for creatinine, BUN, and tCO . The results for each sample measured by the
2
Roche Cobas analyzers were averaged. Additional contrived samples (<10%) were
prepared and tested when necessary to span the reportable range for each analyte.
