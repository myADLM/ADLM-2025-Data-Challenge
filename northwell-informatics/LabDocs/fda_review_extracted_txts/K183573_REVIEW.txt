The Vstrip H. pylori Antigen Rapid Test is a qualitative immunochromatographic assay
which employs antibody-coated latex beads to detect Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) antigens
in stool specimens from patients suspected of H. pylori infection. Each assay kit contains the
materials needed for 20 tests, and includes the test cassettes, sample preparation tubes,
positive control reagent, and the package insert and instructions. The test cassette houses the
diagnostic strip which incorporates a pair of H. pylori-specific monoclonal antibodies for
detecting H. pylori antigens in stool. Results are visualized in the test cassette “Result
Window”. The sample preparation tube contains sample diluent buffer, and it incorporates a
sampler tool attached to the underside of the tube cap and a dispenser tool attached to the top
of the tube. The positive control reagent contains inactivated H. pylori.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle:
To perform the test, a small portion of stool sample is diluted and mixed in the sample
preparation tube, and the diluted sample is added to the test cassette. The sample flows
through a labeled pad containing red-colored antibody-coated latex particles. If the sample
contains H. pylori antigen, the antigen will bind to the antibody to form antigen-antibody-
latex complexes which flow through the nitrocellulose membrane by capillary action. The
complexes bind H. pylori specific antibodies at the test line position to form a pink-red line.
A blue line at the control line position serves as an internal control to show that adequate
flow of the sample has occurred, and that active components have been employed during a
test run. For a positive result, a pink-red test line (next to the letter T) along with a blue
control line (next to the letter C) must be visible in the “Result Window”. If H. pylori antigen
is not present or is present at very low levels in the stool sample, only a blue control line will
be visible, and the test result is negative. If the blue control line does not develop within 10
minutes, the test result is invalid.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three laboratory sites in the US. Three lots
of the Vstrip H. pylori Antigen Rapid Test were used. Two trained operators per site
tested a coded and randomized sample panel once per day over five days. The panels
consisted of 12 frozen samples contrived from pooled negative stool matrix spiked
with known amounts of cultured H. pylori, and a true negative sample. Positive
samples at different levels included three replicates each of medium positive (4X

each panel member. Across all sites and operators, agreement with the expected result
was 97.8% (88/90) for the moderate positive panel member, 97.8% (88/90) for the
low positive panel member, 98.9% (89/90) for the high negative panel member, and
100% (90/90) for the true negative panel member. The reproducibility study results
were acceptable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls:
Internal controls. Each test strip contains a blue internal control line to confirm
correct sample flow and active reagents for the test run. If the blue control line is not
visible, the result is invalid and the test should be repeated. The background color of
the strip should be white and should not interfere with the reading of the test result. If
the background strip color interferes with line reading, it is recommended to repeat
the test.
External controls. The kit instructions recommend that external positive and negative
controls should be tested with each new kit shipment. One vial of positive control
reagent is provided with each test kit, and the kit sample diluent buffer serves as the
negative control. The positive and negative controls are intended to ensure that the kit
is functional to produce the expected results. The kit should not be used if either
external control fails to deliver the correct test results.
External positive and negative controls were run during clinical and reproducibility
studies, and all controls passed.
Sample stability:
Studies were conducted to examine the stability of stool samples when stored
refrigerated at 2-8o C or frozen at -20o C. Negative stool samples and contrived
positive samples were stored either refrigerated or frozen/thawed and tested over time
with the Vstrip H. pylori Antigen Rapid Test. The positive samples consisted of H.
pylori organisms spiked into negative stool matrix at moderate positive (5X LoD),
low positive (1-2X LoD), and high negative (below 1X LoD) concentrations. The
study results supported the recommendations that stool samples can be stored for up
to seven days refrigerated at 2-8o C, up to 20 days frozen at -20o C, and can undergo
up to three freeze/thaw cycles.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) was determined using negative stool matrix spiked with
5

--- Page 6 ---
serial dilutions of two strains of cultured H. pylori (ATCC 43504 and ATCC 51653).
The initial LoD was established by two operators testing at least ten replicates of each
dilution. The initial LoD concentrations were confirmed by testing an additional 20
replicates at the target concentration by two additional operators. The LoD was
defined as the lowest concentration at which 95% or more of the replicates were
positive. An assay cutoff value was defined as the concentration that produced a 50%
positive rate. The LoD was determined to be 8x105 CFU/mL for H. pylori strain
ATCC 43504 and 4.5x104 CFU/mL for H. pylori strain ATCC 51653.
Analytical inclusivity (reactivity):
In addition to the H. pylori strains assessed in the LoD study, analytical inclusivity of
the Vstrip H. pylori Antigen Rapid Test was also demonstrated with three additional
strains. All strains were detected 100% of the time at the concentrations listed (Table
1).

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity:
The potential cross reactivity and microbial interference of the Vstrip H. pylori
Antigen Rapid Test was assessed by testing high concentrations of non-target
microorganisms in triplicate in the presence or absence of H. pylori (2-3X LoD) in
negative stool matrix (Table 2). The non-target microorganisms were spiked into the
samples at ≥106 CFU/mL for bacteria and at ≥105 TCID /mL for viruses. No false

positive or false negative Vstrip H. pylori Antigen Rapid Test results were observed
in the presence of the non-target microorganisms.

Interfering substances
An interfering substances study was conducted to assess the potential interference of
exogenous and exogenous substances on the performance of the Vstrip H. pylori
Antigen Rapid Test (Table 3). High concentrations of the substances were tested in
negative stool matrix in the presence or absence of H. pylori spiked at two to three
times the LoD. The samples were tested in triplicate. No false positive or false
negative Vstrip H. pylori Antigen Rapid Test results were observed for the substances
at the concentrations tested.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of the Vstrip H. pylori Antigen Rapid Test was evaluated in a multi-
site prospective clinical study. Three sites (one site in the US and two sites in Taiwan)
used freshly collected, leftover stool samples from patients suspected of H. pylori
infection and tested the samples with the Vstrip H. pylori Antigen Rapid Test.
The Vstrip H. pylori Antigen Rapid Test results were compared to results from an
FDA cleared H. pylori stool antigen ELISA. Performance of the FDA cleared
comparator ELISA was previously established in comparison to an endoscopy biopsy
composite reference method (i.e., culture, histology, and RUT) for initial H. pylori
diagnosis with demonstrated sensitivity and specificity point estimates greater than or
equal to 95%, and a lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI)
greater than 89% for each. The performance of the Vstrip H. pylori Antigen Rapid
Test was reported as positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent
agreement (NPA) with the FDA cleared comparator ELISA results.
A total of 333 fresh stool samples were tested in the study (150 collected in the US
and 183 collected in Taiwan). The study population was 70% (232) female, 30%
(101) male, and the ages ranged from four to 86 years old (Table 4).
