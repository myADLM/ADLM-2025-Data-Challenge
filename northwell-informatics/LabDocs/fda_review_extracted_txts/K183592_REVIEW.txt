CLSI H43-A2, Clinical Flow Cytometric Analysis of Neoplastic Hematolymphoid Cells
L. Test Principle:
Beckman Coulter’s ClearLLab 10C Panels are comprised of lineage-driven combinations of the
consensus reagents, provided in a ready-to-use dry form, for evaluation of B, T and Myeloid cell
neoplasia as described in Table 3 of “2006 Bethesda International Consensus Recommendations
on the Immunophenotypic Analysis of Hematolymphoid Neoplasia by Flow Cytometry: Optimal
Reagents and Reporting for the Flow Cytometric Diagnosis of Hematopoietic Neoplasia”1. The
ClearLLab 10C product is intended for use on the Navios and Navios EX flow cytometers with
instrument set-up performed with Flow-Check Pro Fluorospheres, Flow-Set Pro Fluorospheres,
and Compensation Kit color compensation reagents and beads for alignment, voltage
standardization, and compensation.
This test depends on the ability of a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody to bind to the surface of
cells expressing discrete antigenic determinants. Specimens are washed to remove endogenous
plasma proteins that may interfere with the binding specificity of antibodies. Specific cell
staining is accomplished by incubating washed specimen cells with the appropriate antibody
reagent. The ClearLLab 10C Panels are composed of four panels containing ten monoclonal or
polyclonal antibody reagents, each specific for a different cell surface antigen and conjugated to a
specific fluorochrome. After sample preparation, the specimens are analyzed on the flow
cytometer with manual gating.
The Navios and Navios EX flow cytometers in combination with the Kaluza C Software applies
the principles of flow cytometry to acquire and analyze a whole blood, bone marrow or lymph
node sample. Samples are prepared and stained with a monoclonal antibody reagents followed by
lysis of red blood cells prior to introduction into the instrument. Cellular populations are
identified based on the specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and fluorochromes used in
the different panels. Detection of fluorescent antibodies bound to cells utilizes the capability of
the Navios or Navios EX flow cytometer to detect fluorescence with three lasers: a blue laser
with a 488 nm, a red laser with a 638 nm, and a violet laser with a 405 nm excitation; and ten
different detection channels (FL1-FL10). Preset Kaluza C LMD analysis templates for the
ClearLLab 10C reagent system are provided.
The Navios and Navios EX Flow Cytometer Software provides automated instrument setup of
alignment, voltage standardization, color compensation, and verification when used with the
quality control reagents. The software has an Auto-Set Panel which automatically standardizes
the cytometer, adjusts compensation settings, passes cytometer settings to designated test
protocols, and verifies cytometer setup and antibody performance. The ClearLLab 10C Panels
are processed through the Navios and Navios EX Flow Cytometers and analyzed using the
Kaluza C Analysis software.

Sample Preparation & Analysis
Whole Blood (WB) and Bone Marrow (BM) preparation:
Specimens are prepared manually with three pre-wash steps using phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) containing 2% Heat Inactivated Fetal Calf Serum (HI-FCS). The remaining white blood
cell pellet is then resuspended in PBS containing HI-FCS. The washed specimen is stained with
the ClearLLab 10 Color Panels. Prior to analysis, the IOTest 3 Lysing Solution is used for lysing
red blood cells and the IOTest 3 Fixative Solution is used for fixation.
Lymph Node preparation:
Lymph node specimens require disaggregation of the tissue into a single cell suspension. Single
cell suspensions prepared from lymphoid tissues may not require washing prior to staining if the
specimen was washed during the disaggregation process. If washing steps were not performed
for removal of residual soluble proteins, or if the cells were re-suspended in a buffer containing
human serum or serum proteins, then pre-washing is necessary.
Sample analysis:
The Navios or Navios EX System Software is used for sample acquisition in conjunction with
ClearLLab 10C Panels. The acquisition protocols are provided as part of the software and
contain the following plots:
• Time/FL10 plot (Ungated) for monitoring of acquisition
• FS INT/FS Peak plot (Time) to define "Singlets" and exclude the aggregated cells
• SS INT/FS INT plot (Singlets) to define "Cells" and exclude the compromised cells (see
Warning)
• FL10/SS INT plot (Cells) to define "CD45+" cells
• FL10/SS INT plot (CD45+) to define the Stop Criteria of 50,000 total CD45+ cells, define
populations of "Lymphs", "Monos", "Grans", and "CD45dim".
The List Mode Data (LMD) files are analyzed offline using Kaluza C Flow Cytometry Software
with an appropriate combination of subpopulation gates. The Kaluza C Flow Cytometry
Software allows the user to perform the LMD analysis for data generated using any of the four
ClearLLab 10C Protocols. Review of the color compensation and gating are required.
M. Interpretation of Results
Flow cytometric immunophenotyping is multiparametric and relies on simultaneous identification
and characterization of both normal and candidate malignant cell populations. Normal cells,
which vary in type and relative numbers depending on the sample type, patient age, and clinical
setting, display highly conserved and reproducible patterns of cell surface marker expression and
light scatter. These normal internal control patterns may serve as both process controls for
sample type, sample degradation, sample preparation and staining, data acquisition, and data
analysis, as well as references against which candidate malignant populations may be compared.
Candidate malignant populations may display aberrant loss of a marker, aberrant gain of a
marker, or aberrant over- or under-expression of a marker. Any population that does not conform
to the normal internal control pattern is evaluated for malignancy. Interpretation of these patterns
requires expert knowledge and training in the technique. It is not possible to predict the
phenotype of a particular patient’s hematolymphoid malignancy and apply fixed templates for
samples for detection of specific phenotypes. Even well-characterized diseases such as chronic
lymphocytic leukemia may display case-to-case immunophenotypic variability and it is therefore
the role of the expert interpreter to assess the significance of findings and to interpret them
11

--- Page 12 ---
together with clinical history, morphological assessment, and other ancillary techniques in order
to arrive at a final diagnosis. The device labeling states that interpretation of specimens should be
performed by a pathologist or equivalent professional who has the appropriate training. Finally, a
small number of rare samples contain no or very few normal cells and require careful evaluation
and correlation with other sources of information such as clinical history and other laboratory
findings to obtain the appropriate final diagnosis.
N. Performance Characteristics:
All results provided below met the manufacturer’s pre-specified acceptance criteria.
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Precision and Reproducibility: Precision studies were conducted according to the
methodology presented in CLSI EP05-A3, Evaluation of Precision Performance of
Quantitative Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline – Third Edition.
i. Precision (repeatability): The repeatability of normal and abnormal clinical
specimens representing clinical matrices and anticoagulants was evaluated with the
ClearLLab 10C Panels at four sites. Eighty three specimens across the three specimen
types were evaluated. Each site employed a different anticoagulant for specimens,
according to their current clinical practice: K2EDTA, acid citrate dextrose (ACD), or
heparin. For the three specimen matrices (i.e. whole blood [WB], bone marrow [BM],
lymph node[LN]), three sites evaluated all three matrices; one did not evaluate lymph
node. Two sites operated the Navios instrument, and the other two operated the
Navios EX. Each site evaluated a minimum of 18 specimens. For lymph node
specimens (LN), testing was conducted at two sites. Since LN specimens are not
collected using an anticoagulant, this was not a variable for lymph node specimen
analysis.
Unless otherwise specified, a minimum of two specimens per specimen type per panel
per anticoagulant (site) were included. Each specimen per panel was analyzed twice
each day. There were six sample preparations in the morning and six sample
preparations in the afternoon, resulting in a total of 12 replicates per specimen per
panel. From 1092 initial total replicates, 96 were excluded for reasons of specimen
quality or insufficient quantity. Both quantitative and qualitative assessment were
applied to the precision assessment where the presence or absence of an abnormal
phenotype was reported.
All results showed 100% qualitative agreement across all sites, panels, anticoagulants,
specimen types, and phenotypes. The number of samples tested is depicted in the
tables below.
For repeatability evaluation, pre-defined hematopoietic lineage populations were
defined as in the table below:

ii. Operator-to-operator and instrument-to-instrument imprecision: Five normal and five
abnormal clinical specimens representing clinical matrices and anticoagulants were
evaluated with the ClearLLab 10C Panels at one site, across three operators utilizing
two Navios EX instruments. Each operator performed separate sample preparations in
triplicate twice per day. Samples were acquired on each of the two instruments, the
order of which was randomized. Following acquisition, each operator analyzed
listmode datafiles as instructed, using Kaluza C software. A reviewer assessed each
LMD analysis as normal or abnormal, and further described the immunophenotype of
abnormal results. From 396 initial acquisitions, 36 replicates from one specimen were
excluded for reasons of insufficient quantity.
All results showed 100% qualitative agreement across Instruments and Operators. The
number of samples tested is depicted in the tables below.

iii. Site-to-Site Reproducibility with Control Material: The reproducibility of the
ClearLLab 10C reagent system on Navios and Navios EX flow cytometers was
evaluated utilizing one lot each of control cell materials: ClearLLab Normal Control
Cells and ClearLLab Abnormal Control Cells. These control materials express all
surface markers comprising the ClearLLab 10C panels. For multi-site testing, control
materials allow samples to be shared between sites in a manner not available for native
samples. For each panel, the two controls were tested on three Navios instruments and
three Navios EX instruments, across five total sites × three ClearLLab 10 color
reagent lots. At site 1, testing was performed for 20 days × two runs/day × two
replicates/run × three sites × one instrument/site. At sites 2 and 3, testing was
performed for five days × two runs/day × three replicates/run × three sites × one
instrument/site. Across all three sites, a total of 140 test results for each panel were
generated; three results were excluded for operator error.

iv. ClearLLab 10C Reagents Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility: For each panel, three normal
whole blood specimens were tested in triplicate × three lots, using one Navios
instrument. Certain markers are expressed at levels too low to reliably assay in normal
specimens. For these markers, enriched cell populations or cell lines were employed.
For evaluation of CD34, the human leukemic stem-like cell line KG1a was tested. For
CD117 (c-kit, stem cell factor receptor) within the M2 panel, normal blood specimens
were spiked with the human leukemic cell line MO7e. Enriched basophils were used
to assess CD123 (interleukin 3 receptor alpha chain). From each panel, nine

b. Linearity/Reportable Range:
Instrument Linearity: The study was conducted on four Navios EX flow cytometers and
four Navios flow cytometers. A study was performed to evaluate the linearity and
dynamic range of the Navios and Navios EX flow cytometers’ acquisition systems, from
the photomultiplier tubes (PMT) to the electronics, independent of the application and
gating methodology. The Navios and Navios EX flow cytometers’ acquisition system
demonstrated linear results independent of the application and gating methodology.
c. Detection Limit: The study was used to establish the detection capability, i.e., the ability
to differentiate between abnormal and normal populations, of the ClearLLab reagents.

i. Limit of Blank (LoB):
The LoB was determined by testing five replicates of four normal specimens run with
two lots of each ClearLLab 10C panels. The highest LoB observed from the two lots
across all four panels was 0.10% population of abnormal cells.
ii. Limit of Detection (LoD):
The LoD was determined by using one normal specimen as a blank sample. One
clinical specimen that contained a representative abnormal population was used to test
each of the four ClearLLab 10C Panels. The clinical specimen was spiked into a
normal specimen to prepare low level of the abnormal population targeting 2%, 1%
and 0.5% of the total Leukocytes.
The Limit of Detection defined as 1% population of abnormal cells for all four panels
used in the ClearLLab application is therefore confirmed.
d. Analytical Specificity:
i. Interfering Substances:
Not applicable. Adequate washing with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) before
staining with reagents removes residual plasma and interfering substances.
ii. Assay Carryover:
Carryover studies were conducted on three Navios and three Navios EX flow
cytometers according to the methodology presented in CLSI H26-A2: Validation,
Verification, and Quality Assurance of Automated Hematology analyzers; Approved
Standard-Second Edition, Section 5.7 with regard to high or low value sample order.
Two studies were conducted to evaluate specimen and reagent carryover.
Specimen Carryover
Three samples with high WBC counts (HTv1, HTv2, HTv3) were prepared from one
clinical whole blood specimen containing a high level of WBCs. The samples were
prepared to target 20,000 cells /μL WBCs. CD34 marker analysis was performed
using a CD34+ clinical whole blood specimen.
Three samples with low WBC counts (LTv1, LTv2, LTv3) were prepared by spiking a
diluted (1:10,000) whole blood specimen with a red blood cell pool which had been
depleted of white blood cells and diluted 4:1 with Immuno-Trol storage buffer. This
resulted in a contrived specimen that had a red blood cell concentration similar to
whole blood with very low concentrations of white blood cells.
The reagent selected for specimen carryover was the ClearLLab M1 Cell Tube reagent
as a representative reagent because it contains all types of conjugates (FITC, PE,
ECD, PC5.5, PC7, APC, APC-A700, APC-A750, Pacific Blue and Krome Orange)
used in other ClearLLab 10C Panels as well as markers that can be used to identify
29

--- Page 30 ---
and assess the recovery of all leukocyte populations (lymphocytes, monocytes and
granulocytes). Testing with M1 reagent also assesses the impact of lysing and fixative
reagents on integrity of cell membranes for all relevant cell subsets and the conjugated
antibodies that are found in the ClearLLab reagents.
Three HTv samples (HTv1, HTv2, HTv3) were analyzed consecutively followed
immediately by the three LTv samples (LTv1, LTv2, LTv3). This was repeated three
times on three Navios and three Navios EX flow cytometers. A total of nine sets of
specimen carryover runs were evaluated for each Navios and Navios EX systems. No
significant carryover was detected as determined by percent carryover for specimens,
calculated from the analysis of the averages of the three runs on each flow cytometer
for LTv1, LTv3, and HTv3. The specimen carryover is less than 1% for all markers.
Reagent Carryover
High concentration samples (HTv1, HTv2, HTv3): Normal whole blood specimens
(for B, T, and M1 Cell Tubes) and clinical specimens (for M2 Cell Tubes) stained
with all four ClearLLab 10C Panels were used as the high concentration samples.
Low concentration samples (LTv1, LTv2, LTv3): The same normal blood specimen
or clinical whole blood as in the high concentration sample was processed in triplicate
using antibody dilution buffer (RD1), in place of antibody reagent.
All the ClearLLab 10C antibody reagents (B, T, M1 and M2 reagents) were selected
for the reagent carryover studies. The potential for carryover of these products and the
subsequent impact on performance were assessed for FS, SS, and FL1-FL10, in all
twelve of the detection channels.
The testing consisted of a high concentration sample analyzed consecutively three
times (HTv1, HTv2, HTv3) followed immediately by testing the low concentration
sample three times (LTv1, LTv2, LTv3). This run was repeated three times on three
Navios and three Navios EX flow cytometers for a total of nine reagent carryover runs
per instrument.
The reagent carryover is less than 1% for all markers demonstrating acceptable scatter
and fluorescent carryover performance.
e. Traceability, Stability (Reagent and Specimen)and Controls:
i. Traceability:
For monoclonal antibodies, Leukocyte Typing Workshop information for each
antibody clone was provided. Each clone identity is controlled and is traced back to
the original source. Polyclonal antibodies for identification of Kappa or Lambda cell
markers are supported by referenced literature.

ii. Reagent Stability:
Testing of reagent stability was based on CLSI EP-25A (Evaluation of Stability of In
vitro Diagnostic Reagents, Approved Guideline. Each of the ClearLLab 10C Panels
(B, T, M1 and M2 Cell Tubes) is in dry format and separately packaged in a kit
containing five sealed pouches each with five capped single test tubes for a total of 25
units per package. Each tube is used once, therefore, open vial stability is not
applicable.
Four lots of each panel were tested. Of those four lots, one lot of each ClearLLab 10C
Panel was subjected to environmental/transportation cycling (shipping) for stability
testing. Data was collected on the Navios system. Three lots were held at 20−30ºC
while the fourth lot was tested at three separate temperature conditions, 18ºC, 18 −
25ºC (RT) and 30ºC. The real time studies were conducted for closed pouch (CP) and
open pouch (OP) testing for the duration of the target reagent shelf life. Three whole
blood specimens from healthy donors were used for testing at seven time points. At
each time point the lot under test (Test Lot) was compared to a fresh lot (Reference
Lot). The percent positive of each marker was evaluated. The common markers in
multiple panels were tested at least in one panel. CD123 was assessed using Basophils
and CD10 was assessed using Granulocytes of the normal whole blood samples.
Three lots of ClearLLab Abnormal Control Cells, or three normal whole blood spiked
with KG1a Cell Line were used for CD34. CD34-APC is a common marker in all
panels and was tested using the M2 Cell tube only. Three lots of ClearLLab Abnormal
Control Cells or three normal whole blood spiked with Mo7e cell line were used for
CD117. CD45-KrO is a common gating marker for all panels and was assessed using
Lymphocytes in the T Cell Tube. CD10-ECD, CD13-PC5.5, CD38-AA700, HLA-DR-
AA750, CD19-PB were evaluated in all corresponding panels. This study
demonstrated that the ClearLLab 10C Panels (B, T, M1, and M2) met the stability
claims of 180 days for closed pouch and 30 days for open pouch.

bone marrow specimens, 12 lymph node specimens and 33 normal whole blood
specimens were collected with different anticoagulants. The specimens included 33
collected in K2EDTA, 35 collected in ACD, and 30 collected in Heparin. Specimens
were analyzed on the Navios flow cytometer for each of the ClearLLab 10C Panels at
two sites. The study matrix included the specimen age (T0, T-inter, T-aged) and
prepared sample (P0, P3, P6) stability for whole blood and bone marrow specimens.
Only prepared sample stability was assessed for lymph node specimens. Lymph node
samples were stained with the B Panel and T Panel only, as these are the only
pertinent panels. Presence or absence of the abnormal phenotype was assessed for
each specimen for each time point tested. The study examined the combined effect of
specimen and prepared sample stability drift by evaluating recovery of percent
positive phenotypes. The specimen (4−25ºC) and prepared sample stability claims at
room temperature (20−25ºC) are shown below:

Current standard lab practice allows use of specimens without a time restriction if cell
viability permits. Labeling will reflect continuation of this practice.
iv. Controls
ClearLLab Control Cells, normal and abnormal, are assayed, lysable, whole-blood
quality control products used to verify the activity of the ClearLLab 10C Panel
reagents and to verify the methods used for staining targeted cells, lysing erythrocytes,
and analyzing samples with flow cytometry.

Whole Blood Samples: The study evaluated ClearLLab 10C panels parameter recovery
for normal whole blood specimens collected in different anticoagulants (K2EDTA,
Heparin, and ACD). Forty three normal whole blood samples were collected in three
different anticoagulants and processed. One replicate per donor and per anticoagulant was
analyzed. The specimens were tested to assess the normal markers by comparing between
each pair of two anticoagulants against the specification. The performance of ClearLLab

10C panels with whole blood specimens collected in K2EDTA, ACD, and Heparin
anticoagulants was demonstrated to be equivalent.
Whole Blood and Bone Marrow: A total of 65 whole blood and 68 bone marrow clinical
specimens were collected in each of the anticoagulants (K2EDTA, ACD or Heparin) and
were tested with both ClearLLab 10C Panels and ClearLLab Reagents (5C) to assess the
10C performance with each anticoagulant. Presence or absence of the abnormal
phenotypes was assessed for each specimen for the ClearLLab 10C Panels and ClearLLab
5C Reagents. The qualitative agreement between the ClearLLab 10C Panels and the
ClearLLab Reagents (5C) was analyzed for each anticoagulant, for both positive and
negative outcomes in addition to the overall agreement. This multi-center anticoagulant
study for whole blood and bone marrow was conducted across five sites covering
hematopoietic malignancies as well as those with hematological abnormalities but no
malignancy. Peripheral blood and bone marrow collected in K2EDTA were analyzed
within 24 hours. Specimens collected in ACD and Sodium Heparin were analyzed within
48 hours. Equivalent performance between the ClearLLab 10C and 5C Panels was
demonstrated using the different anticoagulants for both whole blood and bone marrow
specimens.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
A multi-center, retrospective study was conducted at four sites comparing the diagnostic
accuracy of the ClearLLab reagents to detect the presence or absence of an abnormal
phenotype to the clinical outcome of “malignant” or “non-malignant” based on the clinical
sites’ final patient diagnosis. Patients with abnormal B-cell, T-cell, Natural Killer (NK)
cell, and myeloid cell populations were tested. Residual samples were tested from a
diverse population of patients covering hematopoietic malignancies as well as those with
hematological abnormalities but no malignancy. This study included whole blood, bone
marrow and lymph node specimen types. Specimen types tested reflected the distribution
of the diseases and clinical indications encountered in the population of patients that are
routinely encountered in evaluations of patients suspected of having hematopoietic
neoplasia by flow cytometry. Consecutive specimens evaluated for flow cytometric
immunophenotyping of leukemia and lymphoma and meeting the target disease categories
were enrolled at these sites.
Clinical sites provided final diagnosis (“malignant” or “non-malignant”) for all subjects
and all specimen types based on the clinical testing performed at the respective sites
regardless of the specimen type sent to the flow cytometry laboratory for testing as per
WHO guidelines.9 A qualified flow expert from each sitereviewed the Kaluza generated
flow report independently to determine the absence or presence of abnormal phenotype
and was blinded to the final clinical diagnosis. The result was designated as “malignant”
if an abnormal population was identified, and “non-malignant” if an abnormal population
was not identified.
