H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel is a multiplexed nucleic acid test intended for use with
QIAstat-Dx system for the simultaneous qualitative detection and identification of
multiple respiratory viral and bacterial nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS)
eluted in Universal Transport Media (UTM) obtained from individuals suspected of
respiratory tract infections. The following organism types and subtypes are identified
using the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel: Adenovirus, Coronavirus 229E, Coronavirus
HKU1, Coronavirus NL63, Coronavirus OC43, Human Metapneumovirus A+B,
Influenza A, Influenza A H1, Influenza A H3, Influenza A H1N1/pdm09, Influenza B,
Parainfluenza Virus 1, Parainfluenza Virus 2, Parainfluenza Virus 3, Parainfluenza Virus
4, Rhinovirus/Enterovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus A+B, Bordetella pertussis,
Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
The detection and identification of specific viral and bacterial nucleic acids from
individuals presenting with signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection aids in the
diagnosis of respiratory infection if used in conjunction with other clinical and
epidemiological information. The results of this test should not be used as the sole basis
for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions. Negative results in the setting of
a respiratory illness may be due to infection with pathogens that are not detected by the
test or lower respiratory tract infection that is not detected by a nasopharyngeal swab
2

--- Page 3 ---
specimen. Positive results do not rule out co-infection with other organisms: the agent(s)
detected by the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel may not be the definite cause of disease.
Additional laboratory testing (e.g., bacterial and viral culture, immunofluorescence and
radiography) may be necessary when evaluating a patient with possible respiratory tract
infection.
Due to the small number of positive specimens collected for certain organisms during the
prospective clinical study, performance characteristics for Bordetella pertussis and
Parainfluenza Virus 1 were established primarily with retrospective clinical specimens.
Performance characteristics for Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Parainfluenza Virus 2,
Parainfluenza Virus 4, Influenza A subtype H1 and Coronavirus 229E were established
primarily using contrived clinical specimens.
Due to the genetic similarity between Human Rhinovirus and Enterovirus, the QIAstat-
Dx Respiratory Panel cannot reliably differentiate them. A positive QIAstat-Dx
Respiratory Panel Rhinovirus/Enterovirus result should be followed-up using an alternate
method (e.g., cell culture or sequence analysis).
Performance characteristics for Influenza A were established when Influenza A H1N1-
2009 and A H3 were the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation. Performance of
detecting Influenza A may vary if other Influenza A strains are circulating or a novel
Influenza A virus emerges. If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based
on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health
authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions
for novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for
testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is
available to receive and culture specimens.

I. Device Description:
QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Reagent Kit
Each QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel reagent kit contains six (6) QIAstat-Dx Cartridges in
individually wrapped foil pouches and six (6) individually packaged transfer pipettes for
dispensing liquid sample into the QIAstat-Dx Cartridge.

--- Page 4 ---
QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Cartridge
The QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel cartridge is a disposable plastic device that allows the RP
assay to be performed on the QIAstat-Dx Analyzer. The cartridge includes all the necessary
reagents to perform extraction, amplification, and detection of target nucleic acids from the
eluted NPS specimen. All sample preparation and assay steps are performed within the
cartridge.
QIAstat-Dx Analyzer
The QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0 is the unit that hosts a cartridge and, on command from the
user, is able to run predefined assay protocols. Within the cartridge, multiple steps are
automatically performed in sequence by using pneumatic pressure and a multiport valve to
transfer sample and fluids via the Transfer Chamber to their intended destinations. Following
the introduction of the sample from a disposable transfer pipette, the following assay steps
occur automatically and sequentially:
• Resuspension of internal control and Proteinase K enzyme;
• Cell lysis using mechanical (rotation) and chemical (chaotropic and isotonic) means;
• Mixing of the purified nucleic acid with lyophilized “Master Mix” reagents;
• Sequential transfer of mixed eluate/Master Mix from the Transfer Chamber to each
Reaction Chamber containing the specified, air dried primers and probes;
• Within each Reaction Chamber, real-time, multiplex PCR (“rt-PCR”) testing is
performed. Increase in fluorescence (indicative of detection of each target analyte) is
detected directly within each Reaction Chamber;
• The detected signal per fluorescent marker per Reaction Chamber is then used by the
system software to generate the assay result.
Materials Required but not Provided
• QIAstat-Dx Analyzer Instrument
• QIAstat-Dx Analyzer User Manual
Interpretation of Results
The QIAstat-Dx Analyzer automatically interprets and saves test results. After ejecting the
cartridge, the results summary screen is automatically displayed. Detected analytes (i.e.;
positive results) are displayed at the top of the list under the category ‘Detected’ in red font
with a plus sign (+) next to the name. Equivocal results are next listed in yellow font with a
question mark (?) next to the name. The last section of the results screen shows all targets
tested with either a plus sign if it was detected, a question mark if the result was equivocal,
and a minus sign (-) with the name in green colored font if the analyte was tested but not
detected.
Quality Control
The QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Cartridge includes Internal Control (IC), a titered
lyophilized MS2 bacteriophage that provides verification that all steps of the analysis process
including sample resuspension, lysis, nucleic acid purification, reverse transcription, and
PCR were successful. The results screen displays a message indicating that the internal
controls “Passed” when the test was run successfully. An IC message of “Failed” indicates
4

--- Page 5 ---
that the internal control was not amplified; ‘Positive’ test results are still reported as positive,
but all ‘Negative’ results are invalid. Positive and negative external controls are
recommended by the manufacturer but are not provided.

Reproducibility Study
A reproducibility study of QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel was conducted by operators at
three sites using panels of blinded coded specimens containing high negative, low
positive, and moderate positive mixed analyte samples. A total of twelve sample mixes
were prepared for the study. Nine operators from three sites (five operators from site 1,
two operators each from sites 2 and 3) participated in the study. The study was conducted
over five days testing four replicates per day. Samples were prepared by spiking
individual pathogens into HeLa cells in UTM to final concentrations of 0.1x, 1x, or 3x
LOD.
The percent agreement with expected results for all analytes was ≥95% for samples tested
at 1x and 3x LOD. All of the sample mixes generated negative test results for analytes
not included in the specific mix tested. There were no significant differences observed
within run (replicates tested by one operator), between runs (five different days), between
sites (three sites), or between operators (nine operators).
The Reproducibility Study site-to-site qualitative results (agreements with expected
results) are presented in Tables 2, 3, and 4 below.

Specimen Stability
To provide data supporting the specimen storage recommendations stated in the product
package insert, an analytical study was carried out to evaluate specimen stability.
Contrived positive NPS samples (eluted NPS samples) were prepared by diluting specific
panel targets into a sample medium consisting of UTM combined with HeLa cells.
Sample mixes were prepared at both 5x LOD and 1x LOD concentrations in discrete
sample mixes. Negative data was obtained from specimen mixes where the analyte was
expected to be absent based on the composition of the specific mix. All prepared samples
were tested at N=10 at each of the following three time points/conditions: Time 0 (fresh),
4 hours at 15 to 25 °C, 72 hours at 2 to 8 °C, and 30 days at -15 to -25 °C. Positive
samples were considered stable as long as they tested positive in the QIAstat-Dx
Respiratory Panel with at least a 90% detection rate. The acceptance criteria of ≥90%
detection was achieved for all analytes at the 5x LOD concentration tested under the four
conditions described above. Details regarding the detection rates are presented in the
tables below.

While some variance is expected due to the fact that 1x LOD is essentially equivalent to a
95% detection rate for the analyte, the acceptance criteria was not met for all analytes and
all time points/conditions when tested at the 1x LOD concentration.

Shelf Life
The stated shelf life for the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel is 12 months when stored at 15
to 25 °C. Stability data to support the proposed shelf life and shipping conditions was
obtained by testing three separate production lots of QIAstat-Dx cartridges using QC
material under a real time stability study. The study was performed at room temperature
at 30-day intervals spanning a planned 13-month period. Data generation is ongoing and
is being maintained under Qiagen’s Quality Systems internal protocols.
d. Detection limit:
The objective of the Analytical Sensitivity Study was to identify the limit of detection
(LOD) of the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel prepared from high-titer stocks obtained
from commercial suppliers or clinical isolates for commercially unavailable target
analytes. For the purposes of the study, the LOD level was defined as the
concentration of analyte that produced positive QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel test
results approximately 95% of the time when tested in multiple replicates.
The LOD was assessed in a two-step process for every analyte. The first step was
setup of a preliminary LOD by testing serial dilutions for every pathogen in a
minimum of 3 log serial dilutions around the expected LOD. For this step of the
study, samples were prepared in a simulated matrix consisting of UTM plus HeLa
cells and four replicates of each analyte were tested. The data obtained from the first
step was then used to choose the concentration of analyte likely to provide a
minimum of 19 out of 20 positive results for the LOD confirmation. Confirmed LOD
concentrations prepared in simulated matrix were then verified by testing the analytes
in clinical matrix whereby at least 19 out of 20 replicates were again detected by the
assay (see “matrix equivalency” below). If the assay failed to verify the LOD in
clinical matrix, a sample of 10x more concentrated titer was prepared and retested for
LOD verification in clinical matrix. The concentrations of analytes which provided at
least 19/20 positive results in clinical matrix is listed as the claimed “LOD” in table 8.

e. Analytical reactivity:
Various respiratory panel virus and bacteria strains were tested to examine the ability
of the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel to detect a wide variety of analyte strains in a
clinical setting. Samples were prepared in a simulated matrix consisting of UTM plus
HeLa cells and tested according to the package insert.
Log dilutions of each analyte were prepared as sample mixes containing multiple
analytes in each mix. All analyte dilutions were run in triplicate. Acceptance criterion
for the study was 3/3 positive results for the analyte being tested. If the criterion was
not met, a 10x more concentrated titer of the analyte was tested in triplicate. Results
in tables 9 - 20 show the analyte, strain, and concentration at which the acceptance
criterion was met. The lowest level of each strain that generated positive results on all
three replicates was identified as the lowest level detected by the QIAstat-Dx
Respiratory Panel.

f. Analytical specificity:
To determine the analytical specificity of the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel, 21 on-
panel pathogens and 52 off-panel pathogens were tested for any potential to cross-
react with primers and probes specific for other analytes in the assay. Viral targets
were tested at 105 units/mL and bacteria/fungal targets were tested at 106 units/mL
wherever possible. Two off-panel bacterial targets were tested at lower concentrations
due to limits of availability from the supplier: Bordetella hinzii and Legionella feeleii
were tested at 5.0 x 103 CFU/mL and 1.0 x104 CFU/mL, respectively. The on-panel
and off-panel testing samples were prepared by single spiking organisms into
simulated NPS sample matrix (UTM + HeLa cells). All organisms were tested in
triplicate using three different lots of QIAstat-Dx RP cartridges and up to 22 different
analyzers. Acceptance criteria for the on-panel pathogens required all replicates to

The following false positive results were observed in the off-panel testing: Positive
M. pneumoniae results were observed for Enterobacter aerogenes (1/9),
Streptococcus pyogenes (2/9), and Aspergillus fumigatus (1/3); a positive
Rhinovirus/Enterovirus result was observed for Legionella micdadei (1/6); and
positive Bordetella pertussis results were observed for Bordetella bronchioseptica
(3/3) and Bordetella holmesii (3/3). The unexpected positive results for M.
pneumoniae may be due to contamination of the off-panel pathogen sources with M.
pneumoniae analyte. Cross-reactivity observed with other Bordetella species is likely
due to the insertion sequence transposon which is the molecular target for Bordetella
pertussis (IS481). IS481 is found in other Bordetella species, albeit typically in fewer
copy numbers. A precaution has been added to the package insert warning of the
possibility of cross-reactivity of non-pertussis species of Bordetella with the QIAstat-
Dx Respiratory Panel test.
g. Potentially Interfering Substances:
An analytical study was performed to assess the potential interference effects of 30
substances naturally present in respiratory specimens or that may be artificially
introduced into the nasal cavity/nasopharynx. Samples were tested in triplicate with
and without addition of the potentially inhibitory substance for direct sample-to-

sample comparison. Sample mixes were prepared in a simulated matrix consisting of
UTM plus HeLa cells to an initial concentration of 10x LOD. Following addition of
an equal volume of UTM (control) or interferent the final test concentration was 5x
LOD for all panel targets. All pathogen-containing samples without spiked substances
generated positive signals for all pathogens present in the sample mixes. Positive
influenza signals were generated when influenza vaccine (Fluenz Tetra and FluMist)
was tested as a potential interferent. In addition to causing false positive results due
the presence of live influenza virus in the vaccine ‘interferent’, it was observed that
Fluenz Tetra and FluMist are capable of causing false negative results for QIAstat-Dx
RP targets. A precaution has been added to the package insert warning that influenza
vaccine present in the patient specimen may cause erroneous results. No other
potentially interfering substances tested in this study were found to affect the
accuracy of target detection for the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel.

with the pathogen mix. For transport media (VTM), the pathogen mixes were
prepared in the specified media at 100% (i.e.; complete replacement of the UTM used
as part of the standard setup). The materials and conditions tested are presented in the

h. Microbial Interference:
QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel testing was performed in the presence of non-panel
respiratory pathogens to determine whether the pathogens are capable of interfering
with the detection of the panel targets. Samples were tested in triplicate with and
without addition of the potentially inhibitory organism for direct sample-to-sample
comparison. Sample mixes were prepared in a simulated matrix consisting of UTM
plus HeLa cells to an initial concentration of 10x LOD. Following addition of an
equal volume of UTM (control) or interferent the final test concentration was 5x LOD
for all panel targets. All pathogen-containing samples without spiked interferent
generated positive signals for all pathogens present in the sample mixes. The
potentially interfering organisms did not inhibit detection of any panel targets at the
concentrations tested. No false positive results occurred because of the presence of
the interfering organism during testing. A list of the potential interfering organisms
and their final test concentrations are listed in the table below.

i. Carry-over:
Not applicable. The QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Assay consists of single-use
disposable cassettes containing all the reagents, reservoirs, and reaction chambers
necessary to perform the test.
j. Assay cut-off:
Assay cut-off for the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel was set according to data
obtained during LOD studies. The assay software Result Call Algorithm (RCA) is the
software processing fluorescence measurements during PCR cycling to produce a
qualitative result. The RCA parameters were initially set during system development
and later adjusted using empirical data obtained during the LOD studies. The refined
RCA was then confirmed during clinical evaluation with the results of the method
comparison testing.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable. Performance of the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel was evaluated
against the comparator method in prospective and retrospective clinical studies and
with contrived specimens where necessary.
b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix equivalency study was performed to verify that the initial LOD
determinations performed in simulated matrix were comparable to the LOD values
obtained in clinical matrix. In order to assess the performance in clinical matrix, a
concentration of 1x LOD (as determined in simulated matrix) for at least one strain
per respiratory panel (RP) pathogen was prepared in true negative clinical NPS
sample matrix and tested in 20 replicates. Results of the matrix equivalency study (as
determined empirically by an LOD confirmation experiment) are shown in the table
below.

1Detection Rate in clinical matrix at LOD concentration determined in simulated matrix.
The results of the matrix equivalency study demonstrated that the two matrices are
not equivalent for all analytes detected by the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel and that
analytical studies performed in simulated matrix (at the LOD determined in simulated
matrix) represent a more challenging analyte concentration for those studies. Claimed
LOD concentrations listed in the LOD section of this summary and the package insert
represent either the concentration confirmed in this study or the higher (more
concentrated) analyte level as verified in clinical matrix according to minimum
empirical acceptance criteria (≥ 95% detection rate with a minimum of 20 replicates).
3. Clinical Studies:
Prospective Specimens
A multi-center study was conducted at five study sites located throughout the U.S. plus
one international site between December 2017 and April 2019. The QIAstat-Dx
Respiratory Panel was used to evaluate fresh, prospectively collected nasopharyngeal
swab specimens eluted in UTM from children and adults of all ages presenting with flu-
like symptoms and meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria. Retrospective (archived) samples
were also included as part of the performance testing. Each study location was
representative of the intended use setting for the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel assay and
testing was performed by trained clinical laboratory personnel. A residual NPS specimen
in UTM was tested for each subject with the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel and an FDA
cleared multiplex respiratory pathogen panel comparator.
A total of 2341 nasopharyngeal swab specimens in UTM were enrolled in the study. Of
those, 37 specimens did not meet eligibility criteria or produced invalid results upon
repeat testing. A total of 2304 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were considered
evaluable. Of the 2304 specimens that met eligibility criteria, 310 were retrospective
(archived) specimens and 1994 were fresh prospective or frozen prospective samples.
Patient age and gender distribution for the evaluable specimens is presented in tables 27
and 28 below.

Of the 1994 evaluable prospective specimens, 95.88% (1912/1994) yielded valid results
on the first attempt (i.e., first loaded cartridge). Invalid or no result were obtained for the
remaining 82 specimens (4.11 %). Forty-two (42) specimens were invalid due to
cartridge internal control failure (2.11%). Of these, 20 (1.00%) provided a result for
positively detected targets and 22 (1.10%) provided a negative result. For 40 (2.00%)
specimens no results were obtained due to incomplete runs. Of these, 1 specimen was
aborted by users (0.05%), 21 were due to instrument errors (1.05%), and 18 were due to
cartridge related errors (0.90%). Seventy-two (72) of the 82 initially failed (no result or
invalid) specimens yielded valid results after a single retesting using a new
cartridge/sample. The remaining 10 specimens failed on the second attempt (2 due to
cartridge failures, 1 due to instrument errors, and 7 due to internal control failures). Of
these internal control failures, detected pathogens were reported for 4 specimens.

Some of the analytes on the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel were of low prevalence and
were not encountered in sufficiently large numbers during the prospective study to
adequately demonstrate clinical performance. To supplement the results of the
prospective clinical study, an evaluation of preselected frozen archived retrospective
specimens was performed. The specimens selected for testing had previously tested
positive for one of the following targets at the clinical laboratory by their standard of care
method: Bordetella pertussis, Coronavirus 229E, Coronavirus HKU1, Coronavirus NL63,
Coronavirus OC43, Influenza A H1N1 2009, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila
pneumoniae, Parainfluenza Virus 1, Parainfluenza Virus 2, and Parainfluenza Virus 4.
Testing was performed by operators who were blinded as to the expected test result. A
total of 310 clinical frozen archived retrospective sample were tested by both the
comparator method and QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel. If the comparator method did not
confirm the preselected target as positive, it was excluded from the data analysis for that
target. Demographic information for the archived specimens is presented below.
Archived samples consisted of 158 male and 152 female specimens.

for Influenza A H1N1, Parainfluenza 2, Parainfluenza 4, Coronavirus 229E, and
Chlamydophila pneumoniae were insufficient to demonstrate system performance.
Therefore, contrived specimens were used as surrogate clinical specimens to supplement
and test the sensitivity and specificity of the above analytes. Residual negative clinical
specimens were spiked with the pathogens at 3x, 5x and 10x LOD levels (50 of each).
Contrived samples were provided a unique study identification number and the individual
who contrived the samples did not test them; therefore, the status of each contrived
specimen was unknown at the time of testing.

N. Instrument Name:
QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0 is a portable bench-top unit designed to perform in
laboratory and point-of care environments. QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel cartridges are
keyed to match the corresponding holder on the instrument and in only one direction.
Once the cartridge has been inserted into the instrument, the test starts automatically and
runs for approximately 74 minutes. When the test is finished, the cartridge is removed by
the user and discarded. The QIAstat- Dx Analyzer 1.0 automatically interprets test results
and displays a summary on the analyzer display screen. The results can be printed using a
connected printer. The Analyzer is equipped with six optical measurement channels
employing six fluorescence modules, FAM, NED, ROX, VIC, Cy5, and Cy5.5. Each
optical module consists of a LED excitation source and photodiode receiver configured to
the fluorescent channel. Fluorescence signals are processed by software running on an
on-board computer.
