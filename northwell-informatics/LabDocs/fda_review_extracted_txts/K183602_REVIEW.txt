Processing of Human Semen, 5th Ed. Geneva: WHO Press
L. Test Principle:
A semen sample is collected in the supplied collection cup. The sample is left in the cup and
allowed to liquefy. After liquefying for 30 minutes, 0.5 mL of semen sample is loaded into
the sample well and the device is activated by moving the Slider forward, whereby the
media is pushed into the swim-up chamber. A filter separates the semen from the swim-up
compartment, allowing only the PMSCs to swim through the filter. The non-motile cells are
retained in the semen compartment.
The swim-up compartment contains 700 µL Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) media with
0.05 % Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide (MTT), a dye staining living cells. The motile
cells swimming into the chamber are stained purple by MTT stain. An enzyme in the
mitochondria of the motile sperms cleaves the substrate and stains the progressive motile
spermatozoa. The test device is incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature (18–30°C or
64–86°F). During this incubation time the progressive motile sperm swim through the filter
and up into the swim-up compartment. After incubation, the Slider of the test device is
pulled back and the buffer containing the stained motile sperm are aspirated out of the
detection chamber by the syringe and the stained motile sperm are trapped on the detection
filter letting the media pass through.
The test result is a color reaction which can be read by comparing the color intensity with
the color scale at the result window of the device. The darker the color intensity is, the
higher the concentration of PMSCs.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability was determined by analyzing the same sample (PMSCs/mL)
repetitively over a short period of time under the same measurement conditions (same
device lot/operator/location). Seven different progressively motile sperm
concentrations (PMSCs/mL) covering the measuring range of the test were included.
Semen samples were pooled from sperm donors and diluted in autologous semen

plasma to the following concentrations: 0 M, 1.9 M, 4.1 M, 6.2 M, 8.4 M, 10.1 M and
97.2 M PMSCs/mL, as determined by manual microscopy. The table below provides
a summary of the overall repeatability study results:

Reproducibility was evaluated by analyzing the same sample with changes in the
conditions (different operators/lots/locations and time points). Due to the instability
of fresh semen samples, a modified precision study was conducted. Seven different
samples at two timepoints (30 minutes and 60 minutes after collection) were
analyzed. The following concentrations were tested based on manual microscopy: 0

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Accelerated Stability
An accelerated stability study was conducted to demonstrate that the performance of
the SwimCount Sperm Quality Test was not significantly impacted after 20 weeks
with storage at 55°C (corresponding to 3 years of storage at room temperature). A
semen sample containing 40 M PMSCs/mL as determined by manual microscopy,
was measured on two freshly produced SwimCount devices and six SwimCount
devices stored at 55°C for 20 weeks. The six SwimCount devices contained three
different lots and each lot was tested in duplicate. Paired t-test was used to determine
if the test results were significantly different for the devices stored at 55°C compared
to freshly produced control devices. Results from the accelerated stability study
demonstrate that there are no significant differences in the SwimCount results of the
devices stored at 55°C for 20 weeks compared to freshly produced devices,
supportive of a 3-year real time shelf-life claim.
Real Time Stability
In addition to the accelerated stability study, the shelf-life stability claim was further
supported by performance studies using SwimCount device lots from the first
production batch (July 2015). Three different lots were used in the precision study,
detection limit study, and pre-condition study. The complete, fully assembled devices
were stored at 20°C ± 5°C with humidity ranges of 20–65 RH (relative humidity).
The temperature and humidity for each lot of SwimCount devices was recorded at the
beginning of every month for 43 months. Results from the various performance
studies and pre-condition study demonstrate that the device lots stored for 3 or more
years at the time of testing showed no difference in performance compared to newly
produced SwimCount devices. Stability testing results demonstrate that the
SwimCount Sperm Quality Test is stable for 3 years at 15–30°C.

Transportation Test
A transportation study was conducted to evaluate the stability of the SwimCount
Sperm Quality Test during transport. The devices were shipped in two different ways:
1) Simulating shipping from manufacturer directly to end-user in padded
envelopes (one device per envelope).
2) Shipping in cardboard boxes to the distributors (may include several devices).
SwimCount Sperm Quality Test kits were packed in padded envelopes and cardboard
boxes and transported by a shipping company from one domestic address to another.
Upon arrival at the final shipping destination, the boxes were inspected visually for
damage and the findings were documented, including photographs. In addition to the
visual inspection, the function of the SwimCount device was tested. The test devices
were examined for functionality by testing on sperm samples with known
concentrations of PMSCs/mL and compared to devices, that have not been
transported. Eight SwimCount Sperm Quality Test devices were tested, four devices
with 2.5 M PMSCs/mL and four devices with 8.3 M PMSCs/mL.
Pre-Conditioning
To evaluate whether different climate conditions encountered during distribution have
an effect on device performance, a simulation of different climate conditions was
tested. The SwimCount device was “pre-conditioned” for 6 hours at laboratory
ambient conditions, followed by the highest and lowest temperature and humidity
extremes expected during normal transportation. These conditions were simulated by
placing the SwimCount devices in an incubator and freezer. Three test devices were
used for each condition and compared to controls stored at room temperature. Semen
samples containing 3.5 M PMSCs/mL and 7.5 M PMSCs/mL were tested to examine
potential additive/reductive impact.
The three environments and durations tested are illustrated in the table below:
Environment Time Temperature Relative Humidity
(RH)
Frozen 72 hours -29°Celsius (-20°F) 25–35%
Tropical 72 hours 38° Celsius (100°F) 85% RH
Desert 72 hours 50° Celsius (120°F) 25–35%
Results for the pre-conditioning test met acceptance criteria. It was concluded that the
the performance of the SwimCount Sperm Quality Test was not affected by frozen,
tropical, and desert conditions that may be encountered during distribution, up to the
limits tested.
Sample Stability
The stability of semen samples was evaluated on the SwimCount Sperm Quality Test
by analyzing seven different samples at three timepoints (30 minutes, 60 minutes, and

90 minutes after collection). The following concentrations were tested based on
manual microscopy: 0 M, 1.7 M, 3.9 M, 6.2 M, 9.1 M, 11.4 M and 116.5 M
PMSCs/mL. No change in the PMSC concentration was observed at 30 minutes and
60 minutes after collection of the semen sample. Results from the sample stability
study demonstrate that the SwimCount Sperm Quality Test provides accurate results
for semen samples up to one hour after collection.
d. Detection limit:
To determine the detection limit of the SwimCount Sperm Quality Test, five semen
samples were prepared from a pool of donor semen diluted in seminal plasma to the
following concentrations: 3.9 M, 4.0 M, 5.0 M, 6.0 M, and 6.2 M PMSCs/mL, as
determined by manual microscopy. The preparations and counting were performed by
one operator. A second operator tested the blinded samples on the SwimCount Sperm
Quality Test and read the results. Each concentration was tested in 40 replicates. The
4.0 M PMSCs/mL, 5.0 M PMSCs/mL and 6.0 M PMSC/mL concentrations were tested
on two SwimCount lots for a total of 80 replicates per concentration/sample. The
detection limit study results are shown in the table below.
Concentration Percent positive Percent negative
(PMSCs/mL) (Positive/Total) (Negative/Total)
3.9 M 0 (0/40) 100 (40/40)
4.0 M 7.5 (6/80) 92.5 (74/80)
5.0 M 55.0 (44/80) 45.0 (36/80)
6.0 M 90.0 (72/80) 10.0 (8/80)
6.2 M 100 (40/40) 0 (0/40)

Testing was performed in triplicate. Each potential interfering substance was spiked into
semen samples from vasectomized men (containing semen plasma only) to investigate any
additive effect of interfering substance. Each substance was also spiked into semen samples
containing approximately 20 M PMSCs/mL to investigate any negative effect.
Results from the study identified urine, RBCs and WBCs as substances that may interfere
with the test. All other tested substances caused no interference with the SwimCount Sperm
Quality Test.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A multi-center clinical study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the
SwimCount Sperm Quality Test as compared to manual sperm counting by manual
microscopy (reference method). Semen samples were obtained from men seeking
fertility treatment or from sperm donors. A total of 323 semen samples across four
sites were included in the study. All semen samples were analyzed using Makler
counting chambers and conventional microscopy and compared to the SwimCount
Sperm Quality Test.
Out of the 323 semen samples included in the study, 15 samples were excluded
resulting in a net total of 308 samples analyzed. The 15 samples were excluded for
the following reasons: four men did not fulfill the criteria of a <2 days abstinence
period, one man was diagnosed with globozospermia, one with hematospermia, five
with leucospermia, two samples contained <0.5 mL semen and two samples were too
viscous to be applied into the SwimCount Sperm Quality Test. A summary of the
multi-site clinical study is provided below.
