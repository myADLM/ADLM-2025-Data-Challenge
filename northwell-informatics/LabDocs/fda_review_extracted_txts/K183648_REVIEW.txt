capture of images of urine culture plates, a plate handling system that moves plates between the
input carriers, imaging station and output carriers or stacks, together with software for analysis of
the images, assessment and enumeration of microbial colonies (if present) and result designation.
Plates with growth are designated as either “Positive” or “Review” depending on the number of
colonies present and their morphologic characteristics. All plates that exhibit growth therefore
require follow up according to standard laboratory practice by a trained microbiologist. Those
plates that are designated by the APAS Independence to have no growth may be discarded
without further review.
The APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module is indicated for screening paired sheep
blood and MacConkey agar plates that are each inoculated with 1μL of urine and which are
incubated at 35 ± 2°C for 18 to 22 hours. The system takes digital images of each plate that are
analyzed automatically to determine the number of colonies present and their associated
morphologies. For each plate, the APAS Independence performs the following tasks:
a) Differentiates between areas of growth (colonies) and no growth (e.g., agar, labels,
handwriting);
b) Differentiates areas that are required for interpretation of colony morphology (e.g., α-
and β-hemolysis);
c) Assigns to each area of growth a code that corresponds to a morphology type;
d) Estimates the number of colonies present, converts this number to an organism
concentration in the original urine sample and reports this value in terms of colony
forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL).
e) Generates a growth report including the sample and patient identifiers, type of growth
present (if any), the colony count and any additional information pertaining to the patient
that is obtained from the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS).
The colony morphologies reported by the APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module are
shown in Table 2 for sheep blood agar and Table 3 for MacConkey agar. A “significant
organism” at 103 CFU/mL on the plate will trigger designation of that plate as “Positive,” as
opposed to “Review.” Plates that are designated as “Positive” or “Review” are required to
undergo further evaluation by a clinical microbiologist.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision and reproducibility of colony counts obtained with the APAS Independence
with Urine Analysis Module was evaluated with three different instruments using dilutions of
representative uropathogenic bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae
and Enterococcus faecalis) grown on blood and MacConkey agar. Each dilution of
organisms was plated in triplicate and incubated at 35 ± 2°C for 18 hours. Plates from three
dilutions that exhibited 0 to >100 colonies plate were included in the study. Five images of
each plate were captured on each APAS Independence instrument in each of three different
orientations (0, 120 and 270°). The mean, standard deviation and percent coefficient of
variation of colony counts obtained for each organism dilution on each instrument and
overall is presented in Tables 5 and 6, for blood and MacConkey agar respectively. The
results of the study demonstrated that the precision and reproducibility of colony counts
within and between instruments was acceptable.

2. Linearity:
Agreement between manual colony counts and those obtained with the predicate APAS
Compact with Urine Analysis Module was demonstrated under DEN150059. Because the
APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module uses the same hardware and software for
image acquisition and analysis as the APAS Compact, additional testing to characterize the
accuracy and linearity of colony counts was not needed. Please refer to the Decision
Summary for DEN150059 for additional information.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity of the predicate APAS Compact with Urine Analysis Module was
demonstrated under DEN150059. Because the APAS Independence with Urine Analysis
Module uses the same hardware and software for image acquisition and analysis as the APAS
Compact, additional testing to characterize the analytical specificity of the system was not
needed. Please refer to the Decision Summary for DEN150059 for additional information.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Refer to Table 4 and to Section VII A(2).
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The device labeling indicates that the APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module
should not be used unless the system has passed the appropriate daily Quality Control (QC)
checks. These include Color Calibration and a System Check using the optical tools that are
provided with each instrument, as well as biological QC with standardized cultures of
Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. Please refer to the Decision Summary for
DEN150059 for information regarding the performance of the biological Quality Controls.
6. Detection Limit:
The limit of detection of the predicate APAS Compact with Urine Analysis Module was
demonstrated under DEN150059. Because the APAS Independence with Urine Analysis
Module uses the same hardware and software for image acquisition and analysis as the APAS
Compact, additional testing to characterize the analytical sensitivity of the system was not
needed. Please refer to the Decision Summary for DEN150059 for additional information.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
Not applicable.
9. Carry-Over:
Not applicable.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A Method Comparison Study was performed to demonstrate that the predicate APAS
Compact (DEN150059) and APAS Independence exhibit similar performance with clinical
specimens. In brief, residual clinical urine specimens that had originally been submitted for
urinalysis, were inoculated onto bar code-labeled blood and MacConkey agar plates
according to the instructions for use for the APAS Urine Analysis Module (1µL inoculum
volume). The plates were incubated for 18 hours at 35 ± 2°C and images of each plate were
then captured using one APAS Independence and one APAS Compact instrument system,
each equipped with the Urine Analysis Module software. The images on each instrument
were taken within 4 hours of completion of the specified incubation period.
A total of 550 urine specimens were initially enrolled in the study. Of these, the first 200
were excluded from the analysis of performance because the plate incubator exceeded the
specified temperature. The results from the remaining 350 specimens were included in the
analysis. A summary of the plate designations assigned by each instrument is shown on
Table 7 and 8. In general, there was a high level of agreement (~99%) for plates designated
as “Positive” by the two systems and there was a tendency for APAS Independence to
designate more plates as “Positive” or “Review” than APAS Compact. This is also reflected
in the tendency for higher colony counts to be reported by APAS Independence than by
APAS Compact (Tables 9 and 10) and is considered acceptable without additional risk
mitigation because both these designations require follow-up by a trained microbiologist.

Tables 11 and 12 show a comparison of the colony morphology designations assigned to each
plate by the APAS Compact and APAS Independence using the Urine Analysis Module.
Although the positive and negative agreement differed for each colony morphology, these
designations are provided to the operator for informational purposes and are not used in
disposition of the plates as “Positive”, “Review” or “Negative” and the performance was
therefore determined to be acceptable without the need for additional risk mitigation.

2. Matrix Comparison:
Not applicable.
C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
The clinical performance of the predicate APAS Compact with Urine Analysis Module was
evaluated under DEN150059. Because the APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module
uses the same hardware and software for image acquisition and analysis as the APAS
Compact, additional testing to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the system was not
needed. Please refer to the Decision Summary for DEN150059 for additional information.
2. Clinical Specificity:
Refer to Section VII C(1), above.
