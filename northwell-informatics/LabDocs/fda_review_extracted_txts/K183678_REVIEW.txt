metabolism disorders including, but not limited to, diabetes mellitus, neonatal hypoglycemia,
idiopathic hypoglycemia, and pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.
Creatinine measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of renal diseases, in monitoring
renal dialysis, and as a calculation basis for measuring other urine analytes.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For point-of-care or clinical laboratory setting
D Special Instrument Requirements:
i-STAT 1 Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The i-STAT 1 System consists of the i-STAT 1 Analyzer and the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue)
cartridges. The system is designed for use by trained medical professionals at the patient point of
care or in the clinical laboratory and is for prescription use only.
The i-STAT 1 Analyzer (previously cleared under k103195 as the i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer)
is a handheld analytical device designed to run i-STAT test cartridges. The instrument interacts
with the cartridge to move fluid across the sensors and generate a quantitative result.
The single-use, disposable i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge contains test reagents to analyze
whole blood at the point of care or in the clinical laboratory for glucose, creatinine, and other
analytes. The cartridge format allows all the tests in the cartridge to be performed
simultaneously. The cartridges contain the required sensors, a fluid pouch, a sample entry well
and closure, fluid channels, waste chamber, and the necessary mechanical features for controlled
fluid movement within the cartridge. Cartridges require two to three drops of whole blood which
are typically applied to the cartridge using a transfer device, by the trained user before the
cartridge is placed within the analyzer.

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
Creatinine on the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge is measured amperometrically. Creatinine
(in the sample) is hydrolyzed to creatine by the enzyme creatinine amidohydrolase. Creatine is
then hydrolyzed to sarcosine by the enzyme creatine amidinohydrolase. The oxidation of
sarcosine, catalyzed by the enzyme sarcosine oxidase, produces hydrogen peroxide. A voltage is
applied to the cartridge electrodes with current generated by the reduction of hydrogen peroxide.
The current is directly proportional to the concentration of the creatinine.
Glucose on the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge is measured amperometrically. A voltage is
applied to the cartridge electrodes with current generated by the reduction of hydrogen peroxide
that was produced by catalytic oxidation of glucose present in the sample by glucose oxidase.
The current is directly proportional to the concentration of the glucose.

Point of Care precision – aqueous control material
A three site precision study was performed using a panel of five aqueous control solutions
containing different levels of creatinine and glucose. Each sample was assayed at each site
once per day for five days across each of six i-STAT 1 Analyzers for a total of 90
measurements. At each site, all testing was conducted by a different operator per site using
six lots of i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridges. The results were analyzed for within-day
(between-analyzer), within-site, and overall (summation of between-site, between-day and
between-analyzer) variance components and provided in the tables below:

2. Linearity:
The linearity of the creatinine and glucose assays on the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge
was evaluated following the recommendations in CLSI EP06-A. Lithium heparin venous
whole blood was obtained from a healthy subject and altered to produce a high sample pool
and a low sample pool. Samples of intermediate concentrations were prepared by
intermixing the high and low pools. Each sample was measured in replicates of 15 using five
lots of i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridges. An assessment of linearity was performed using
polynomial regression analysis.
For creatinine, regression analysis found that at each level, the deviation from linearity was
less than 0.15 mg/dL or 7.5%.
For glucose, regression analysis found that at each level, the deviation from linearity was less
than 3 mg/dL or 5%.
Linear regression analysis results for all five lots combined are presented in the tables below.
Creatinine:

Glucose:
Range tested (mg/dL) Slope Intercept R2
16.5 – 821 1.00 -2.14 1.00
The observed proportional response supports the claim that the creatinine and glucose assays
on the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) are linear across the measurement ranges of:
Creatinine: 0.2 - 20.0 mg/dL
Glucose: 20 - 700 mg/dL

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity of the creatinine and glucose assays on the i-STAT CHEM8+
(blue) cartridge was established by conducting interference testing following the
recommendations in CLSI EP07 ED3. Interference from certain exogenous and endogenous
substances was assessed using lithium heparin venous whole blood samples spiked to two
concentrations of low and high: creatinine (0.6 mg/dL, 2.0 mg/dL) and glucose (40 mg/dL,
220 mg/dL). Each low and high sample was further divided into two aliquots: control (with
no added interferent) and test (with added interferent). Each sample was measured in
replicates of 10 using one lot of the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridges. A substance was
identified as an interferent if the difference in the mean between the control and test sample
was outside of the predefined allowable error:
For Creatinine: ± 0.3 mg/dL up to 2 mg/dL and ± 15% above 2 mg/dL
For Glucose: greater of ± 6 mg/dL or ± 10%
For any substances identified as an interferent, a dose response analysis was performed to
assess the highest concentration without significant error, as defined above.
The following table lists the concentrations of each substance at which no significant
interference was found.

For those substances that on initial screening where found to interfere, dose response testing
was conducted to establish the concentration limit below which no significant interference is
expected. The results are summarized in the table below:
Substance Concentration Interference
Lithium bromide ≥ 159 mg/dL (18.3 mmol/L) Increased creatinine results
Hydroxyurea ≥ 0.23 mg/dL (0.03 mmol/L) Increased creatinine results
The sponsor includes the following statements in the labeling for the device:
Lithium Bromide at ≥ 18.3 mmol/L showed increased creatinine results. Bromide at 2.5
mmol/L is the peak plasma concentration associated with halothane anesthesia, in which
bromide is released. Bromide may result in an increased rate of star-outs (***).
Hydroxyurea at ≥ 0.03 mmol/L showed increased creatinine results. Hydroxyurea is a DNA
synthesis inhibitor used in the treatment sickle cell anemia, HIV infection, and various types
of cancer. The malignancies that it is used to treat include melanoma, metastatic ovarian
cancer, and chronic myelogenous leukemia. It is also used in the treatment of polycythemia
vera, thrombocythemia, and psoriasis. At typical doses ranging from 500 mg to 2 g/day,
concentrations of hydroxyurea in a patient’s blood may be sustained at approximately 100 to
500 μmol/L. Higher concentrations may be observed soon after dosing or at higher
therapeutic doses.

Hematocrit (glucose only):
A study was performed with the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge glucose assay to assess
the effect of hematocrit on the reported result. Lithium heparin venous whole blood samples
were collected from 8 donors. Across the donors, eight samples were prepared with 4
glucose levels (32-40, 110-118, 255-268, 644-674 mg/dL). Each of samples was further
altered to three hematocrit levels of low, mid, and high (15-17%, 43-45%, and 71-75%) for a
total of 24 samples. Each sample was measured in replicates of 20 using one lot of i-STAT
CHEM8+ (blue) cartridges and one i-STAT Analyzer. The hematocrit effect was assessed
per donor by comparing the mean glucose at low hematocrit or high hematocrit to the
reference glucose result - which was at the mid-level hematocrit. The results of the study
demonstrated that there was no significant difference in glucose results at the extremes of the
hematocrit range compared to a mid-level hematocrit.
Altitude effects
A study was conducted to assess the effect of high altitude on the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue)
cartridge creatinine and glucose assays. The study was performed inside a barometric
chamber with pressure set to simulate altitudes of:
2000 m (6562 ft.) for creatinine
3000 m (9842 ft.) for glucose
Six lithium heparin venous whole blood samples (one native and five contrived) were used
for creatinine testing and seven heparin whole blood samples (one native and six contrived)
were used for glucose testing. For creatinine each sample was run on seven analyzers using
one lot cartridges for total of 42 measurements. For glucose each sample was run on six
analyzers using one lot of i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridges for total of 42 measurements.
The 42 individual creatinine and glucose measurements were compared to results obtained by
running the samples on comparator methods established to be insensitive to effects of
altitude. The impact on the performance of the tests at altitude was assessed by Passing-

Oxygen sensitivity
A study was conducted to assess the effect of blood oxygen on the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue)
cartridge for the creatinine and glucose assays. Lithium heparin venous whole blood samples
from two donors per analyte were altered to achieve four analyte levels (creatinine: 0.6, 2.5,
8.8, and 15 mg/dL and glucose: 30, 100, 260, and 550 mg/dL). The samples were further
divided to two oxygen levels prepared by tonometry; high (>500 mmHg) and low (creatinine:
20-30 mmHg and glucose: 24-26 mmHg). For creatinine, each sample was measured in
replicates of 12 on 12 i-STAT 1 Analyzers using one lot of i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue)
cartridges. For glucose, each sample was measured in replicates of 12 on 12 i-STAT 1

6. Detection Limit:
Detection capability studies of limit of blank (LoB), limit f detection (LoD), and limit of
quantitation (LoQ) for creatinine and glucose assays on the i-STAT CHEM8+ Cartridge with
the i-STAT 1 Analyzer were conducted following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2.
LoB
The LoB for the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge for the creatinine and glucose assays was
evaluated using lithium heparin venous whole blood samples that were collected from a
healthy subject, and altered to create a blank sample. The sample was measured in 80
replicates across each of two i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge lots for a total of 160
cartridges. The samples were tested over three days for creatinine and four days for glucose.
The LoB was calculated using a parametric data analysis for each of the two lots. The higher
of the two LoB values from each lot is reported in the labeling as the LoB.
LoD
The LoD for creatinine and glucose was evaluated using lithium heparin venous whole blood
samples that were collected from four healthy subjects, and altered to two low concentrations
of creatinine and glucose for each donor. Each of the eight samples was measured in 20
replicates per day for three days across each of two i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge lots
for a total of 320 cartridges. The samples were tested over three days for creatinine and four
days for glucose. The LoD was calculated using a parametric data analysis for each of the
two lots. The higher of the two LoD values from each lot is reported in the labeling as the
LoD.
LoQ
The LoQ for creatinine and glucose was evaluated using lithium heparin venous whole blood
samples that were collected on each day from a unique healthy subject. The whole blood
sample was altered to four low concentrations for both creatinine and glucose. Each of the
four samples was measured in 15 replicates per day for four days across each of two i-STAT
