The i-STAT CHEM8+ cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System is intended for use in the in vitro
quantification of hematocrit in arterial or venous whole blood in point of care or clinical
laboratory settings.
Hematocrit measurements can aid in the determination and monitoring of normal or abnormal
total red cell volume status that can be associated with conditions including anemia and
erythrocytosis.
The i-STAT Hematocrit test has not been evaluated in neonates.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For point-of-care or clinical laboratory setting
D Special Instrument Requirements:
i-STAT 1 Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The i-STAT 1 System consists of the i-STAT 1 Analyzer and the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue)
cartridges. The system is designed for use by trained medical professionals at the patient point of
care or in the clinical laboratory and is for prescription use only.
The i-STAT 1 Analyzer (previously cleared under K103195 as the i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer)
is a handheld analytical device designed to run i-STAT test cartridges. The instrument interacts
with the cartridge to move fluid across the sensors and generate a quantitative result.
The single-use, disposable i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge contains test reagents to analyze
whole blood at the point of care or in the clinical laboratory for hematocrit and other analytes.
The cartridge format allows all the tests in the cartridge to be performed simultaneously. The
cartridges contain the required sensors, a fluid pouch, a sample entry well and closure, fluid
channels, waste chamber, and the necessary mechanical features for controlled fluid movement
within the cartridge. Cartridges require two to three drops of whole blood, which are typically
applied to the cartridge using a transfer device by the trained user before the cartridge is placed
within the analyzer.
K183680 - Page 2 of 11

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
The Hematocrit test on the i-STAT CHEM8+ cartridge uses the conductivity method. The
measured conductivity of the sample is inversely proportional to the number of red blood cells in
the sample. In a whole blood sample, the plasma conducts electrical current and blood cells act
as insulators. The hematocrit sensor, contained in the test cartridge, first measures the electrical
conductivity of the calibrant solution, followed by the conductivity of the whole blood sample.
The hematocrit result (expressed as % packed cell volume or %PCV) is calculated from the ratio
of the sample conductivity to the calibrant conductivity. The conductivity of the sample is also a
function of the plasma electrolyte concentration. The i-STAT Hematocrit test algorithm uses the
measured electrolyte concentration in the sample (e.g. the sodium concentration) in the
calculation of the test result. As a measured electrolyte concentration is required to calculate a
hematocrit result, the Hematocrit test is always paired with the Sodium test in the i-STAT
CHEM8+ cartridge.

Point of care precision (whole blood)
A venous whole blood precision study was performed using venous whole blood from
patients collected in lithium heparin tubes, with samples either native or contrived, to
generate the following hematocrit (%PCV) target ranges: < 38%, 38–51%, and > 51%. The
study was performed at three point of care sites, by one operator at each site, with each
sample tested in triplicate, on seven i-STAT 1 analyzers, for a total of 21 test results per
sample. One lot of i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridges was used for the study. The abnormal
low hematocrit specimens were contrived by adding plasma and the abnormal high
hematocrit specimens were contrived by removing plasma. Within-analyzer (repeatability)
variance and total (summation of between-analyzer and within-analyzer variance
components) variance was determined for each sample at each site. Summaries of the results
from this study are shown below.

*excluded measurements for samples not tested within protocol-specified timeframe
Arterial whole blood repeatability was assessed using data collected across two point of care
sites. An additional assessment of venous whole blood repeatability was determined using
data collected at a single point of care site. Sixty-seven arterial samples, and 123 venous
samples, collected during the method comparison study were measured in duplicate and
repeatability estimates were calculated for each pair of duplicate results within three
hematocrit ranges, < 35%PCV, 35 – 50%PCV, and >50%PCV. Less than 10% of samples
were contrived to cover the high hematocrit range. Only samples with duplicate
measurements were included in the assessment. The study included measurements from one
lot of i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridges run on seven i-STAT 1 analyzers by multiple point
of care operators at each site.

2. Linearity:
The linearity of the hematocrit test on the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge was evaluated
following the recommendations in CLSI EP06-A – Evaluation of the Linearity of
Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline. Venous
whole blood was collected in a lithium heparin tube obtained from a healthy subject and the
specimen was altered to produce a high hematocrit sample and a low hematocrit sample (via
concentration or dilution with plasma, respectively). A series of 11 samples with varying
hematocrit levels (< 15% PCV to > 75% PCV) were created by mixing different proportions
of the high and low hematocrit samples. The low and high samples were value assigned for
hematocrit using 20 i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridges on i-STAT 1 analyzers. Each sample
was measured in replicates of 20 using five lots of i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridges on i-
STAT 1 analyzers. An assessment of linearity was performed and polynomial regression
analyses for first-, second-, and third-order polynomials were determined. The third-order
model was determined to have the best fit and was used for the assessment of the degree of
non-linearity. For all test samples, the absolute value of the degree of non-linearity met the
pre-defined acceptance criteria and linearity was demonstrated over the reportable range of
15 – 75% PCV.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity of the hematocrit test on the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge was
established by conducting interference testing following the recommendations in CLSI EP07-
A2 - Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline – Second Edition.
Interference from certain exogenous and endogenous substances was assessed using lithium
heparin venous whole blood samples at two hematocrit levels: low hematocrit (26.5% –
31.5% PCV) and high hematocrit (57 – 63% PCV). Each low and high sample was further
divided into two aliquots: control (with no added interferent) and test (with added
interferent). Each sample was measured in replicates of 10 using one lot of i-STAT CHEM8+
(blue) cartridges. A substance was identified as an interferent if the point estimate of the
difference between the test sample and the control sample was outside of the pre-defined
allowable error of ±10.8% PCV. For any substances identified as an interferent, a dose-
response analysis was performed to determine the degree of interference as a function of the
substance concentration. Based on this method of interferent determination, substances listed

White Blood Cells (WBCs) 50,000 cells/µL
Intralipid 5296 mg/dL
Lithium bromide, total protein and high levels of white blood cells (WBC) were identified as
interferents to the hematocrit test for samples with certain hematocrit levels, as summarized
in the table below:
Interfering Substances:
Substance Concentration Interference
Lithium bromide ≥ 14.0 mmol/L Decreased HCT results
Total Protein > 10.2 g/dL Increased HCT results
Total Protein < 5.3 g/dL Decreased HCT results
White Blood Cells > 50,000 cells/µL Increased HCT results
Additionally, factors that affect the sodium measurement on the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue)
cartridge will also affect hematocrit measurements, as the electrolyte concentration from the
sample is used to correct the measured conductivity prior to reporting hematocrit results.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
See Section A.2 Linearity
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
For the measurement of hematocrit, the i-STAT 1 System can be customized to agree with
methods calibrated by the microhematocrit reference method using either K EDTA or
3
K EDTA anticoagulant. Mean cell volumes of K EDTA anticoagulated blood are
2 3
approximately 2 – 4% less than K EDTA anticoagulated blood (CLSI H7-A3: Procedure for
2
Determining Packed Cell Volume by the Microhematocrit Method; Approved Standard –
Third Edition). While the choice of sample anticoagulant affects the result of the
microhematocrit method (to which all hematocrit methods are calibrated), results on
hematology analyzers are independent of the anticoagulant used because these methods
dilute the sample. Since most clinical hematology analyzers are calibrated by the
microhematocrit method using K EDTA anticoagulant, the i-STAT 1 System default
3
customization is K EDTA.

6. Detection Limit:
Detection capability studies of limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of
quantitation (LoQ) for the hematocrit test on the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge with the
i-STAT 1 analyzer were conducted following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2 –
Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures;
Approved Guideline – Second Edition.
LoB
The LoB study was conducted over three days using two lots of i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue)
cartridges and whole blood samples collected in lithium heparin tubes from four unique
subjects. The whole blood from each subject was altered to create a ‘blank’ hematocrit level
sample for LoB testing. Since whole blood is not stable over time, each of the three days, a
fresh whole blood blank sample was created from a unique specimen. Each of the four LoB
samples was measured in 20 replicates on each of the two cartridge lots for a total of
approximately 80 measurements per cartridge lot. The LoB was determined based on the
maximal LoB value obtained for the cartridge lots tested. The LoB for the hematocrit test on
the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge was determined to be 0.66% PCV.
LoD
The LoD study was conducted over three days using two lots of i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue)
cartridges and evaluated whole blood samples collected in lithium heparin tubes from four
unique subjects. The whole blood from each subject was altered to create four low-level
hematocrit samples. Since whole blood is not stable over time, each of the three days, four
fresh whole blood low-level hematocrit samples were created from a unique specimen. Each
of the four low-level samples from each of the four subjects was measured in 10 replicates on
each of the two cartridge lots for a total of approximately 160 measurements per cartridge lot.
The LoD was determined based on the maximal LoD value obtained for the cartridge lots
tested. The LoD for the hematocrit test on the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge was
determined to be 1.38% PCV.
LoQ
The LoQ for hematocrit was evaluated using lithium heparin venous whole blood collected
on each day, over the course of three days, from unique healthy subjects. The whole blood
was altered to produce four low-level hematocrit samples below the lower limit of the
reportable range (< 15% PCV). Each of the four samples was measured in 15 replicates on
each of two i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge lots for a total of 60 measurements per
cartridge lot. The LoQ was determined to be 12.4 %PCV, which is below the lower limit of
the i-STAT Hematocrit test reportable range (15 – 75 %PCV).

A method comparison study was performed comparing the performance of the hematocrit
test on CHEM8+ (blue) cartridges run on the i-STAT 1 analyzer compared to the hematocrit
test on the EC4+ cartridge run on the i-STAT Alinity analyzer (K163342). A total of 194
specimens from subjects > 19 years old were tested across three point of care sites by
operators representative of point of care operators. Specifically, 124 lithium heparin venous
whole blood specimens and 70 lithium heparin arterial whole blood specimens were
evaluated in the study. Less than 10% of all specimens used in the study were contrived to
supplement the lowest and highest hematocrit specimens. The data was analyzed separately
for venous whole blood and arterial whole blood specimens by Passing-Bablok regression
analyses comparing the first replicate from the candidate device to the mean of duplicate
measurements from the predicate device for each specimen. Data was also analyzed for
venous and arterial whole blood specimens combined, as the data was demonstrated to be
poolable. Results are presented in the tables below.
