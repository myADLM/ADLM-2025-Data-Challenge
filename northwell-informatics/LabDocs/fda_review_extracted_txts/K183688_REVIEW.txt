IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The i-STAT 1 System consists of the i-STAT 1 Analyzer and the i-STAT CHEM+ (blue)
cartridges. The system is designed for use by trained medical professionals at the patient point of
care or in the clinical laboratory and is for prescription use only.
The i-STAT 1 Analyzer (previously cleared under k103195 as the i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer)
is a handheld device designed to run only i-STAT test cartridges. The instrument interacts with
the cartridge to move fluid across the sensors and generate a quantitative result.
The single-use, disposable i-STAT CHEM8+ cartridge contains test reagents to analyze whole
blood at the point of care or in the clinical laboratory for sodium, potassium, chloride, blood urea
nitrogen, and other analytes. The cartridge format allows all the tests in the cartridge to be
performed simultaneously. The cartridges contain the required sensors, a fluid pouch, a sample
entry well and closure, fluid channels, waste chamber, and the necessary mechanical features for
controlled fluid movement within the cartridge. Cartridges require two to three drops of whole
blood which are typically applied to the cartridge using a transfer device, by the trained user
before the cartridge is placed within the analyzer.
B Principle of Operation:
The sensors are microfabricated thin film electrodes on a silicon chip. A lead line connects the
sensors to contact pads. The sensors and lead line are contained within the cartridge; the contact
pads are exposed to allow direct contact with the analyzer. The contact pads conduct the signals
generated by the sensors to the analyzer. The analyzer connects to the contact pads of the sensor
via contact pins that lower inside the analyzer upon insertion of the cartridge. When the sensor
generates an electrical signal (in response to contact with the patient sample and the presence or
absence of each analyte of interest), the signal is carried by the lead line to the contact pad where
the signal generated by the sensor is read by the analyzer.
Ion selective methods are based on the measurement of potential difference (voltage) between
the ion selective electrode and the reference electrode (both are found on the biosensors within
the cartridge). The biosensor chips convert the activity of the ion dissolved in the patient sample
into an electrical signal which can be measured. The concentration of sodium, potassium,
chloride and BUN in the patient sample is calculated (derived from the Nernst equation) from the
difference between the patient sample and the calibrant solution electrical signals.

2. Linearity:
The linearity of the sodium, potassium, chloride, and BUN assays on i-STAT CHEM8+
(blue) cartridge was evaluated following the recommendations in CLSI EP06-A. Lithium
heparin venous whole blood was obtained from a healthy subject and was altered to produce
a high sample pool and a low sample pool. Samples of intermediate concentrations were
prepared by intermixing the low and high pools. Each sample was measured in replicates of 3
using 5 lots of i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridges. An assessment of linearity was performed
using polynomial regression analysis.
For sodium, regression analysis found that at each level, the deviation from linearity was ≤
0.26 mmol/L or 0.18%.
For potassium, regression analysis found that at each level, the deviation from linearity was ≤
0.04 mmol/L or 0.70%.
For chloride, regression analysis found that at each level, the deviation from linearity was ≤
0.31 mmol/L or 0.25%.
For BUN, regression analysis found that at each level, the deviation from linearity was ≤ 1.65
mg/dL or 1.50%.
Linear regression analysis results for all five lots combined are presented in the tables below.

The observed proportional response supports the claim that the sodium, potassium, chloride
and BUN assays on the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) are linear across the following measurement
ranges:
Sodium: 100 - 180 mmol/L
Potassium: 2.0 - 9.0 mmol/L
Chloride: 65 - 140 mmol/L
BUN: 3 - 140 mg/dL
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity of the sodium, potassium, chloride and BUN assays on the i-STAT
CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge was established by conducting interference studies following the
recommendations in CLSI EP07-ED3 and CLSI EP37. Interference from certain exogenous
and endogenous substances was assessed using lithium heparin venous whole blood spiked at
two concentrations of each analyte at low and high: sodium 135±5 mmol/L and 145±5
mmol/L; potassium 3.5±0.3 mmol/L and 5.0±0.3 mmol/L; chloride 100±5 mmol/L and
110±5 mmol/L; BUN 10±4 mg/dL and 30±4 mg/dL. Each low and high sample was further
divided into two aliquots: control (with no added interferent) and test (with added
interferent). Each sample was measured in replicates of 10 using one lot of the i-STAT
CHEM8+ (blue) cartridges. A substance was identified as an interferent if the difference in
the means between the control and test samples was outside of the predefined allowable
error:
For Potassium: ± 0.5 mmol/L.
For Chloride: ± 5% of the control mean/median chloride result (mmol/L).
For BUN: the greater of ± 2 mg/dL or ± 9% of the control mean/median BUN result (mg/dL).
For any substances identified as an interferent, a dose response analysis was performed to
assess the highest concentration without significant error, as defined above.

For those substances that on initial screening where found to interfere, dose response testing
was conducted to establish the concentration limit below which no significant interference is
expected. The results are summarized in the table below:
Substance Concentration Interference
Lithium Bromide ≥ 2.4 mmol/L Increased chloride results
Sodium Thiosulfate ≥3.1 mmol/L Increased sodium results
Sodium Thiosulfate ≥ 4.19 mmol/L Increased chloride results
Triglycerides ≥ 10.2 mmol/L Increased BUN results
The sponsor includes the following statements in the labeling for the device:
Lithium Bromide at ≥ 2.4 mmol/L showed increased chloride results. Bromide at 2.5 mmol/L
is the peak plasma concentration associated with halothane anesthesia, in which bromide is
released. Bromide may result in an increased rate of star outs (***).
Nithiodote (sodium thiosulfate) at ≥3.1 mmol/L shows increased sodium results. Sodium
thiosulfate is indicated for the treatment of acute cyanide poisoning. The journal article titled
“Falsely increased chloride and missed anion gap elevation during treatment with sodium
thiosulfate” indicated that sodium thiosulfate could be used in the treatment of calciphylaxis
indicating that “the highest concentration likely to be seen in plasma [is] after infusion of a
12.5 g dose of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate. Assuming that the 12.5 g dose of sodium
thiosulfate pentahydrate is distributed in a typical blood volume of 5 L with a hematocrit of
40%, the peak sodium thiosulfate plasma concentration expected is 16.7 mmol/L.

6. Detection Limit:
The detection limits are supported by the linearity study (please see section 2 above). In
addition, a limit of quantitation (LoQ) study for each analyte on the i-STAT CHEM8+
Cartridge with the i-STAT 1 Analyzer was conducted following the recommendations in
CLSI EP17-A2.
LoQ
The LoQ for sodium, potassium, chloride and BUN were evaluated using four lithium venous
whole blood samples that were collected on each day from a unique healthy subject. The
whole blood sample was altered to low sodium (<100 mmol/L), potassium (< 2.0 mmol/L),
or BUN (<3 mg/dL) concentrations. Each of the four samples was measured in 15 replicates
per day for four days across each of two i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridges for a total of 120
cartridges tested. The LoQ was calculated for each of the two lots. The sponsor defined LoQ
as the greater of the two lots at which the lowest concentration met the pre-defined total error
goal listed in the table below for each analyte.
The results are summarized in the table below.

7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The accuracy of the sodium, potassium, chloride, BUN assays with the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue)
cartridge on the i-STAT 1 Analyzer was evaluated by a method comparison study for agreement
with the predicate devices. The study was conducted across two point of care sites.
Sodium:
A total of 141 lithium heparin venous blood specimens and 46 lithium heparin arterial whole
blood specimens were tested using two lots of i-STAT CHEM 8+ (blue) cartridges. Twelve
specimens were contrived. The data were analyzed by passing-Bablok regression analysis
comparing the first replicate of the candidate deice results to the singlicate result of the predicate
device.
