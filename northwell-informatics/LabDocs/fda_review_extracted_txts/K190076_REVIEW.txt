1. Indications for use:
The Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitation of BCR-
ABL1 and ABL1 mRNA transcripts in peripheral blood specimens of diagnosed t(9;22)
positive Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) patients expressing BCR-ABLl fusion
transcripts type e13a2 and/or e14a2. The test utilizes automated, quantitative, real-time
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra
test is intended to measure BCR-ABL1 to ABL1 percent ratios on the International Scale
(IS), and also expressed as a log molecular reduction (MR value) from a baseline of
100% (IS), in t(9;22) positive CML patients during monitoring of treatment with
Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs).
The test does not differentiate between e13a2/b2a2 or e14a2/b3a2 fusion transcripts and
does not monitor other rare fusion transcripts resulting from t(9;22). This test is not
intended for the diagnosis of CML.

L. Test Principle:
Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra is an automated quantitative, real-time reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test for quantifying the amount of BCR-ABL
transcript as a ratio of BCR-ABL/ABL. Whole blood specimens are collected in EDTA. Four
(4) ml of blood is manually processed with proteinase K, followed by lysis buffer and
ethanol. The entire contents are transferred to the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra cartridge. The
system is configured for the use of single-use, disposable GeneXpert cartridges that hold the
RT-PCR and PCR reagents and host the reactions needed to detect BCR-ABL fusion genes
resulting from two major p210 breakpoints, translocation e13a2/b2a2 and e14a2/b3a2, and
the ABL transcript as an endogenous control in peripheral blood specimens. There are two
controls included in each Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test, which are the ABL Endogenous
Control and the Probe Check Control (PCC). The ABL Endogenous Control normalizes the
BCR-ABL target and ensures that sufficient sample is used in the test. The PCC verifies
reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling, and that all reaction components, including probes and
dyes, are present and functional in the cartridge.
The test is performed on Cepheid GeneXpert Instrument Systems (GeneXpert and GeneXpert
Infinity). The GeneXpert Instrument Systems perform further sample purification, nucleic
acid amplification, and target sequence detection. The systems consist of an instrument,
computer, and preloaded software for running tests and viewing the results. The amount of
BCR-ABL transcript in the patient sample is reported as the ratio of BCR-ABL/ABL, as well
as a log molecular reduction (MR value) from a baseline of 100% on the International Scale
(IS), using the GeneXpert software.
The Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra quantifies the BCR-ABL1 mRNA level on the International
Scale (IS) using ABL1 as a housekeeping gene and is calibrated using lot specific parameters
that are embedded within the test cartridge barcode for quantitation of BCR-ABL1 mRNA.
The values of lot-specific calibrations are determined in quality control testing of each assay
lot using secondary standards derived from and calibrated to the World Health Organization
(WHO) International Genetic Reference Panel for quantitation of BCR-ABL transcript.
Interpretation of Results
The numerical value of the World Health Organization (WHO) International Scale is %IS,
the ratio expressed as a percentage of BCR-ABL1 expression to the expression of a control
gene (ABL1 in this instance). The International Scale (%IS) is a geometric progression and
therefore repeated measurements of a sample are non-normally distributed about the mean.
%IS values require log-transformation prior to performing any statistical analyses that
require normally-distributed data.
Another value commonly reported in the literature is the Molecular Reduction, or MR value.
The MR value is traditionally written as MRx.x. The MR value is the log10 reduction from
the internationally standardized baseline, defined as 100% IS. Therefore,
MRx.x = log (100/%IS) = log (100) – log (%IS) = 2 – log (%IS)

This test reports both %IS and MR values. MR values with corresponding IS values are
shown in Table 1 below.

i. The precision/reproducibility of the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test was in accordance
with CLSI EP05-A3. A panel of 11 samples (described in Table 2) was prepared by
diluting a bulk lysate of high %BCR-ABL/ABL specimens from patients with CML
into pooled whole blood collected from healthy donors to obtain the desired level and
included the following: One sample negative for BCR-ABL, 2 samples near the limit
of detection (LoD) and 8 samples at molecular response (MR) levels 1-4, using the 2
targets detected by the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test: e13a2/b2a2 and e14a2/b3a2.

ii. Because the predicate assay precision study was performed using extracted RNA and
the Xpert BCR ABL Ultra test, a second study head-to-head comparison was
conducted to demonstrate the precision performance at MR3 was comparable to the
predicate beginning with whole blood for the predicate. Precision was evaluated with
4 specimens at two levels (MR3 and MR4) for each breakpoint (e13a2/b2a2 and
e14a2/b3a2). Each sample was run 3 times for each of 5 days (N = 15
extractions/replicates). The data demonstrated comparable precision performance
when compared to the predicate. The results are shown in Table 4.

The study data support the conclusion that the assay has acceptable precision to MR4.
Precision was not evaluated at MR = 4.5 and cannot be assured. The assay is not
indicated for discontinuation from TKIs or for monitoring for discontinuation.
iii. Between-Lot Reproducibility: Between lot reproducibility was assessed using three
lots in the 3 site reproducibility study described above. The imprecision ranged 0.02
SD to 0.08 SD across transcripts and levels.
iv. Between Instrument Model Reproducibility: The Xpert BCR-ABL test is intended for
use on the GeneXpert 1, II, IV, and XVI and GeneXpert Infinity 48s and GeneXpert
Infinity 80. Each GeneXpert model is similar in that all contain the same modules but
different number of modules. The GeneXpert Infinity models are higher-throughput
models. To demonstrate the uniformity of results across all models, each site in the 3
site reproducibility study used each of 3 different GeneXpert Instrument Systems
including the highest throughput the Infinity-80. The results demonstrated that
performance is the same across all systems.
v. Precision of External Controls: The precision performance of external control
materials recommended for use with the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra was demonstrated.
The Xpert BCR-ABL IS Panel C130 is a set of reference materials intended for use in
monitoring the performance of the in vitro quantitative detection of the BCR-ABL
translocation transcripts. The 6-member panel is traceable to the 1st World Health
Organization (WHO) International Genetic Reference Panel and composed of
different ratios of synthetic BCR-ABL1(e14a2/b3a2) fusion transcript to ABL1
control transcript suspended in a stabilizing matrix to yield approximately 0.0%,
0.0032%, 0.01%, 0.1%, 1% and 10% BCR-ABL1/ABL1 (IS) when analyzed using
the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra assay. They are manufactured by and available through
Maine Molecular Quality Controls, Inc. (MMQCI; Scarborough, Maine, USA). Four

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated independently for each of the two major breakpoints,
e13a2/b2a2 and e14a2/b3a2, using CML clinical specimens that were specific for a
high level of either the e13a2/b2a2 or e14a2/b3a2 breakpoint. Lysate from each high

level of BCR-ABL transcript CML specimen was diluted in a background lysate
prepared from CML-negative clinical specimen to target ranges of ~50%
(IS)/MR0.30 to 0.000625% (IS)/MR5.20. The panel members, including the negative
level, were tested on two assay kit lots in replicates of 4 per kit lot.
Testing and statistical analyses were conducted in accordance with CLSI EP06-A.
Linear regression analyses were performed for first, second and third order
polynomials. The results for each breakpoint were considered linear if the
polynomial regression coefficients were insignificant (p-values > 0.05). The linear
regression curves for both transcripts are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 below. The
estimated regression intercepts, slopes and R2 values from the linear model are
shown in Table 6. The reportable range of the assay is MR0.26 to MR 4.52.

e14a2/b3a2 0.03647 1.03153 0.9788
These results support the linearity from 55% IS (MR 0.3) to 0.002 IS% (MR 4.7) with
a maximum SD of 0.26.
c. Detection limit:
i. Limit of Blank
The limit of blank (LoB) was determined by testing 50 normal (non-CML)
human EDTA whole blood specimens that were presumed to be negative for
BCR-ABL. Testing was performed across 5 kit lots by 4 operators across
multiple days. No measurable BCR-ABL values were observed for any of the
tests and the overall LoB was determined to be 0.00% (IS).
ii. Limit of Detection
The limit of detection (LoD) was estimated for both e13a2/b2a2 and
e14a2/b3a2 breakpoints by testing serial dilutions of High CML positive
specimens [ >10% (IS)/MR1] as well as testing Low CML positive specimens
[<0.1% (IS)/MR3].
Data for each breakpoint across dilutions and specimens were separately
12

[Table 1 on page 12]
	Breakpoint			Intercept			Slope			R2	
e13a2/b2a2			-0.05833			0.99501			0.98304		
e14a2/b3a2			0.03647			1.03153			0.9788		

--- Page 13 ---
compiled and the LoD was estimated by using probit regression analysis. The
resulting analysis yielded an estimated LoD of 0.0035% (IS)/MR4.56 for the
e13a2/b2a2 breakpoint and 0.0030% (IS)/MR4.52 for the e14a2/b2a2
breakpoint.
The LoD was verified by adapting the non-parametric method described in the
CLSI guidance document, EP17-A2. Two unique CML positive specimens
representing each breakpoint were diluted to a targeted 0.0030% (IS)/MR4.52
level. For e13a2/b2a2, 94 replicates were tested by 2 operators across 4 test
kit lots over 4 days. For e14a2/b3a2, 101 replicates were tested by 2 operators
across 4 test kit lots over 7 days. Results are shown below in Table 7.
Table 7: LoD Verification for e13a2/b2a2 and e14a2/b3a2
Positives/ % of
Breakpoint Median % (IS)/MR
Replicates Positives
e13a2/b2a2 90/94 95.74% 0.0030% (IS)/MR4.52
e14a2/b3a2 97/101 96.04% 0.0029% (IS)/MR4.55
Since the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test does not distinguish between the two
breakpoints, e13a2/b2a2 and e14a2/b3a2, the higher of the two is claimed as
the assay LoD. Thus, the overall Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra LoD for both
e13a2/b2a2 and e14a2/b3a2 is 0.0030% (IS)/MR4.52.
The assay is not indicated for discontinuation from TKIs or for
monitoring for discontinuation.
iii. Limit of Quantitation
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was estimated with the data obtained from the
LoD studies. The mean and standard deviation for the % (IS) values and MR
values were calculated for replicates at levels equal to the LoD, 0.0030%
(IS)/MR4.52, or greater with positivity greater or equal to 95%. The LoQ of
the assay is constrained by the LoD of the assay; therefore, the LoQ was
determined to be equal to the LoD, 0.0030% (IS)/MR4.52. The results were
also evaluated against the acceptance criteria for standard deviation (SD) ≤
0.36. The MR standard deviation for both e13a2/b2a2 (observed SD range
MR0.27-MR0.34) and e14a2/b3a2 (observed SD range MR0.29-MR0.31)
were within the acceptance criteria.
The LoQ is the same as the LoD MR4.52.
d. Traceability and Stability (Reagents and Specimen):
i. Traceability
The Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra quantifies BCR-ABL mRNA level as % (IS) via
calibration of the assay to validated secondary quantitative standards which
are aligned to the primary (i.e., the first World Health Organization (WHO))
international genetic reference panel for quantitation of BCR-ABL mRNA.
13

[Table 1 on page 13]
Breakpoint		Positives/			% of		Median % (IS)/MR
		Replicates			Positives		
e13a2/b2a2	90/94			95.74%			0.0030% (IS)/MR4.52
e14a2/b3a2	97/101			96.04%			0.0029% (IS)/MR4.55

--- Page 14 ---
This allows for the determination of a lot-specific conversion factor, including
assay efficiency (E) and scaling factor (SF) for each lot of Xpert BCR-ABL
Ultra kits. The efficacy of calibration relative to the secondary standards is
monitored on an ongoing basis.
Traceability to the 1st World Health Organization (WHO) International
Genetic Reference Panel for quantitation of BCR-ABL translocation by RQ-
PCR (NIBSC code: 09/138) was demonstrated by measuring the WHO
Reference Panel with 3 lots of the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test and comparing
the measured values to the values published in the Reference Panel’s
Instructions for Use. Each of the 4 Reference Panel members was tested with
a minimum of 10 replicates per assay kit lot. The measured MR values for
each level of the WHO Primary panel were calculated by regression to each
lot of the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test (i.e., the WHO panel members were
treated as clinical samples and fit to the linear regression model of the assay’s
standard curve). Furthermore, the measured MR values were compared to the
published MR values through an additional regression analysis to determine
slope and intercept values. The slope of the line was close to unity (0.96 to
1.1) and the intercept was calculated to be close to 0 (-0.03 to -0.06) (Figure 3
below).

analyses and confidence intervals are based upon data for each lot separately.
ii. Reagent Stability
a. Real Time Stability
Reagent shelf life stability studies were conducted with 3 lots, testing 2⁰ C
and 8⁰ C at 0 month, 0.5 months, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months,
12 months 25 months 31 months and 37 months. Three levels (0.1% IS,
0.01% IS and negative) were tested. At each timepoint, 8 replicates were
tested for each lot. The results of the study support a 24 month stability
claim.

b. Shipping Stability
Summer and winter shipping conditions were tested on a single lot.
Summer shipping conditions were as follows:
• 43 C, 70% humidity, 4 hrs then
• 24 C, 50% humidity, 2 hrs then
• 43 ⁰ C, 70% humidity, 2 hrs then
• 38 ⁰ C, 95% humidity, 2 hrs then
• 15 ⁰ C, 20 % humidity, 6 hrs then
• 41 ⁰ C, 85% humidity, 2 hrs then
• 48 ⁰ C, 90% humidity, 6 hrs then
• 43 ⁰ C, 75% humidity, 24 hrs then
• 50 ⁰ C, 75% humidity, 5 days
⁰
Winter shi⁰pping conditions were as follows:
• -2 C, uncontrolled humidity, 4 hrs then
• 24 C, 50% humidity, 2 hrs then
• -2 ⁰ C, uncontrolled humidity, 2 hrs then
• -5 ⁰ C, uncontrolled humidity, 2 hrs then
• 15 ⁰ C, 10% humidity, 6 hrs then
• -14 ⁰ C, uncontrolled humidity, 2 hrs then
• -18 ⁰ C, uncontrolled humidity, 6 hrs then
• -24 ⁰ C, uncontrolled humidity, 24 hrs then
• -18 ⁰ C, uncontrolled humidity, 5 days
⁰
Upon comp⁰letion of each condition, packages were further subjected to a
series of drop testing conditions including shock and vibration tests,
vehicle stacking simulation, loose load vibration simulation, altitude test
simulation, and vehicle vibration simulation. Samples were tested at 0
month, 0.5 months, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months 25
months 31 months and 37 months. Three levels (0.1% IS, 0.01% IS and
negative) were tested. At each timepoint, 8 replicates were tested for each
lot. Acceptance criteria were met and these results support the conclusion
that the assay is stable following a 7 day shipment.
iii. Specimen Stability
a. Blood stability
Testing was performed on CML EDTA blood specimens targeting 10%
IS, 0.1% IS and 0.01% IS. The clinical specimens were stored at 4 C for
0 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and 96 hours. The results
demonstrate that the test can be used on whole blood collected in E⁰D TA
tubes and stored 4 C for 72 hours.
⁰
16

--- Page 17 ---
b. Lysate stability
Whole blood is mixed with proteinase K and lysis reagent to create a
lysate that is loaded on the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra Cartridge. Users are
instructed to store remaining lysate at 4 ºC for up to 4 hours or store at -20
ºC or lower for up to 24 hours in samples need to be retested. The stability
of lysate at 4 C was tested at 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 24 and 48 hours and the
stability lysate at -20 C was tested for 1, 7 and 14 days. Each test used
samples at 1%⁰ IS, 0.1% IS and 0.01% IS. The results support that lysates
are stable up to 4 hou⁰rs at 4º C and up to 24 hours at -20º C.
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Interfering Substances
Five substances that may be present in EDTA whole blood specimens with the
potential to interfere with the performance of the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test
were evaluated. The compounds and levels tested were based on CLSI
document EP07-A2. Interferents were tested in the background of CML
clinical EDTA whole blood specimens representing three levels with five
specimens per level: >1% (IS)/<MR2, 0.1-1% (IS)/MR2-MR3, and 0.001%-
0.1% (IS)/> MR3). Test controls consisted of CML clinical specimens in
EDTA whole blood at the respective BCR-ABL transcript level without the
interfering substance. Each CML specimen was tested in the absence and
presence of the five individual interferents at 4 replicates per condition listed
in Table 8.
Table 8: List of Potentially Interfering Substances Tested
Interfering Substances Concentration Tested
Unconjugated Bilirubin 20 mg/dL
Cholesterol, Total 500 mg/dL
Triglycerides, Total (Lipids) 1800 mg/dL
Heparin 3500 U/L
EDTA (short draw) 750 mg/dL (5X)
The data demonstrated no discernable interference and supported the
conclusion that none of the tested agents interfere with the assay at the
concentrations listed.
ii. Primer Specificity
The analytical and clinical specificity of Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra was evaluated
for exclusivity by analyzing EDTA whole blood specimens drawn from 50
healthy donors (non-CML) and 20 leukemic specimens (AML/ALL).
Breakpoint specificity was determined by testing normal healthy donor EDTA
blood spiked with 5 different leukemia cell lines representing 3 different types
of leukemia (CML, ALL and APL) and 5 disease-breakpoints: K562
(CML/e14a2/b3a2) and BV173 (CML/e13a2/b2a2) served as positive
controls; SUP-B15 (ALL/e1a2), AR230 (CML/e19a2) and NB4 (APL/PML-
17

[Table 1 on page 17]

RARA) were evaluated for specificity.
No BCR-ABL signal was detected by Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra in any of the
healthy non-CML specimens or AML/ALL leukemic specimens evaluated in
this study.
Among the leukemia cell lines tested, CML cell lines (K562 and BV173) with
p210 major breakpoints yielded the expected positive results. The CML cell
line (AR230) with the p230 e19a2 breakpoint reported “POSITIVE [Below
LoD; >MR4.52/<0.003% (IS)]” for 1 of 4 replicates tested at the targeted 10%
(IS)/MR1.00 level based on the number of K562 cells. The positive result for
the AR230 cell line was for a target level 3.52 logs above assay LoD and was
not observed at the lower levels of 1% (IS)/MR2.00 and 0.1% (IS)/MR3.00.
Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra is specific to the p210 BCR-ABL fusion transcript
associated with CML and has an analytical specificity of 100% for non-CML
EDTA blood specimens.
iii. Specimen Carryover
Each cartridge is single-use, and self-contained GeneXpert cartridges and
therefore carry-over contamination from cartridges is not expected. To
confirm, negative samples were run following very high positive samples in
the same GeneXpert module. This study consisted of processing a negative
sample in the same GeneXpert module immediately following a high positive
sample (simulated CML positive blood) with 4.5 x 105 cells/mL of K562 cells
spiked into CML-negative blood to yield ~10% (IS)/MR1.00. This testing
sequence was repeated five times on each of the four GeneXpert modules. No
contamination was observed as expected.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was designed to evaluate the performance of the Xpert
BCR-ABL Ultra compared to the predicate device [Asuragen Quantidex qPCR BCR-
ABL IS Kit (IVD)] in RNA derived from human blood samples obtained from
individuals previously diagnosed with t(9;22) positive CML, in accordance with the
assay protocol. The samples were tested at four institutions in the U.S. and these sites
also served as specimen collection sites. Three additional institutions served as
specimen collection only sites. The study was conducted using fresh, prospectively
collected EDTA whole blood specimens from patients with CML at any stage of
disease, following initial diagnosis, with or without exposure to Tyrosine Kinase
Inhibitor therapy or other CML treatments. In addition, the study included leftover
specimens stored as frozen lysates which were prepared from EDTA whole blood
from the same patient population. Study participants were required to be at least 18
years of age.
18

--- Page 19 ---
A total of 266 eligible specimens were initially enrolled in the study, from which 57
were excluded. The reasons for exclusions included obsolete extraction methods (n =
27), subjects who did not complete blood draw (n = 8), shipping or testing delays (n =
6), insufficient volumes for testing (n = 6), absence of comparator result (n = 6) or
testing with incorrect Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra assay definition file (n = 4).
Of the remaining 209 specimens, 97.1% (203/209) of the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra
results were successful on the first attempt giving an initial non-determinate rate of
2.9% (6/209) and 99.5% (208/209) were successful upon retesting giving a final non-
determinate rate of 0.5% (1/209).
Of the 208 specimens available for analysis, 150 (72.1%) were frozen specimens and
58 (27.9%) were fresh, prospectively collected specimens, for which demographic
information was available. Among the fresh specimens, 24 (41.4%) were collected
from female subjects and 34 (58.6%) from male subjects. The mean subject age for
those providing fresh specimens was 60.5 years (range 28-85 years).
Of the 208 results that were available for analysis, 147 had results that were within
the quantitative reportable range for both assays [0.0030% - 55% (IS)/MR4.52 –
MR0.26 for Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra and 0.0020% - 50% (IS)/MR4.72 – MR0.30 for
the Comparator Assay]: 117 of which were from frozen left-over lysates and 30 of
which were fresh prospectively collected specimens. The performance of the Xpert
BCR-ABL Ultra test versus the Comparator Assay was evaluated using a Deming
regression to determine the slope and intercept. Figure 4 shows the Deming
regression and linear regression analysis of the 147 assay results (MR values).
Figure 4. Deming and Linear Regression Analysis
19

--- Page 20 ---
The slope and intercept from the Deming regression were 1.0266 and 0.0600
respectively. From these results, the predicted bias at the MMR (MR3) was
calculated to be MR 0.1244 (95% confidence interval of 0.0969 – 0.1519).
A Bland-Altman difference analysis was also performed using the 147 quantitative
results that were within the reportable range for both the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test
and Comparator Assay. The Bland-Altman graph (see Figure 5) shows the upper and
lower 2 SD of the mean difference that was observed. The trend line of the bias
across the MR range is also shown.
Figure 5. Bland-Altman Difference Analysis
The mean difference (bias) was calculated to be 0.1336 with a SD of 0.3354. The
majority (96.6%, 142/147) of the results were within the 2SD range (between -0.5372
and 0.8044).
Results from the method comparison study demonstrate that the Xpert BCR-ABL
Ultra assay is substantially equivalent to the predicate.
