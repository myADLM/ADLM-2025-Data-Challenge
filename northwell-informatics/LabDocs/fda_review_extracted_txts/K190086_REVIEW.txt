1. Accelerated stability study
Shelf life stability was initially evaluated through an accelerated study with three lots of
the controls. The product was placed into chambers at elevated temperatures: 43˚C, 53˚C
and 63˚C. Each lot was tested in 4 replicates at each of the following time points: Day 0,
Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42. The stability of the product was evaluated by calculating the
change (delta) in mean Ct value at each time point for the four microbial targets (Flu A1,
Flu A2, Flu B and RSV) from the mean Ct value obtained at Day 0. Both Positive and
Negative Controls were tested.
For Positive Control, the change in Ct score for all targets, across the three lots, ranged
from -0.8 to 1.8 when stored at 43°C, from -0.4 to 2.4 when stored at 53°C, and from -0.8
to 3.1 when stored at 63°C. All valid tests generated expected (positive) results for all
analytes.
For Negative Control all valid tests generated expected (negative) results.
The data from the accelerated stability study with three lots of the product is summarized
below.

3. In use stability study
An in-use stability of the hydrated control swabs (i.e., placed in the Transport Reagent
Tube from the Cepheid Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay Kit) was evaluated at room
temperature (20°C) over 6 hours. The controls were tested in three replicates immediately
after hydration (t=0), and then again at 4 hours and at 6 hours. All positive and negative
samples produced expected results after 4 and 6 hours. The summary of the data collected
over 6 hours is shown below.

4. Shipping stability
The Cepheid Xpert Respiratory Controls are packaged in sealed foil pouches with
desiccants to prevent effects of high humidity. However, the product may be exposed and
affected by high temperatures. The product is shipped by FedEx for delivery in 2 days,
however, delays may be encountered. The effect of exposure to high temperatures was
evaluated at 43°C after 14 days (the worst-case delay scenario) in the accelerated stability
study described above. The observed change in Ct score for all targets, across the three
lots, ranged from -0.8 to 1.8. For Negative Control all valid tests generated expected
(negative) results upon the storage at 43°C for 14 days.
Human Factors/Operator Errors
The Cepheid Xpert Respiratory Control Panel tested with the Cepheid Xpert Xpress
Flu/RSV assay may be used in CLIA waived settings, therefore the controls were
evaluated to determine the risk of erroneous results due to incorrect volume of the sample
added to the cartridge and deviations from the recommended sample mixing conditions.
Both Positive and Negative Controls were tested. All valid tests generated expected
results.
Expected Values:
The Cepheid Xpert Respiratory Control Panel is a qualitative positive and negative
controls. The following are the expected assay results.
Control Expected Assay Result Interpretation
Flu A Positive
Flu A, Flu B, and RSV target RNA
Positive Control Flu B Positive
sequences are detected
RSV Positive
Flu A Negative
Neither Flu A, Flu B, nor RSV
Negative Control Flu B Negative
target RNA sequences are detected
RSV Negative
