L. Test Principle:
The QUANTA Flash RF IgM and RF IgA assays are microparticle chemiluminescent
immunoassay designed for use on the BIO-FLASH instrument. The instrument platform is a
fully automated closed system with continuous load and random access capabilities that
automatically processes the samples, runs the assay and reports the results. It includes liquid
handling hardware, luminometer and computer with software-user interface. The QUANTA
Flash RF IgM and RF IgA assays utilize a reagent cartridge format, which is compatible with
the BIO-FLASH instrument.
Purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies are coated onto paramagnetic beads which are stored in
the reagent cartridge. The ready-to-use reagent cartridge is loaded onto the BIO-FLASH
instrument. Samples are also loaded onto the instrument in sample racks. A patient serum
sample is prediluted by the BIO-FLASH with system rinse in a small disposable plastic
cuvette. Small amounts of the diluted patient serum, the beads, and assay buffer are all
combined into a second cuvette, and mixed. This cuvette is then incubated at 37°C. The
beads are magnetized and washed several times. Isoluminol conjugated anti-human IgM or
anti-human IgA antibodies are then added to the cuvette, and again incubated at 37°C. The
beads are magnetized and washed repeatedly. The isoluminol conjugate is oxidized when
“Trigger” reagents are added to the cuvette, and the flash of light produced from this reaction
is measured as Relative Light Units (RLU) by the BIO-FLASH optical system. The RLU are
proportional to the amount of isoluminol conjugate that is bound to the human IgM or IgA
which is in turn proportional to the amount of RF antibodies bound to the rabbit antibodies
on the beads.

--- Page 6 ---
The QUANTA Flash RF IgM and RF IgA assays utilize a predefined lot-specific Master
Curve that is uploaded into the instrument through the reagent cartridge barcode. Based on
the results obtained by running two calibrators, an instrument-specific Working Curve is
created, which is used by the software to calculate chemiluminescent units (CU) from the
RLU value obtained for each sample.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
All the results presented below met the manufacturer’s pre-specified acceptance criteria.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision: The imprecision of the QUANTA Flash RF (IgM) and RF (IgA) assays
was evaluated according to CLSI EP05-A03 by running patient samples across the
assay ranges, ten for the IgM assay and nine for the IgA assay. Samples were run in
duplicates, twice a day, for 20 days using one reagent lot (total of 80 replicates per
sample). Controls were run as quality controls during each run. The results are
summarized in the tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of QUANTA Flash RF IgM and QUANTA Flash RF IgA was
evaluated by a study performed according to CLSI EP6-A. The linearity was
evaluated using four human serum samples for the QUANTA Flash RF IgM and three
human serum samples for the QUANTA Flash RF IgA with various RF antibody
concentrations which were combined with another human serum sample containing
low levels of RF antibodies in 10% increments (from 0% to 90% of low sample) to
obtain a set of samples with values that cover the entire analytical measuring range
(AMR) of the assays. The dilutions were assayed in duplicates. Results were

analyzed according to the guideline performing regression analysis and identifying
the best fitting polynomial.
For the QUANTA Flash RF IgM, the results of the analysis of sample sets 1, 2, and 4
demonstrate that that the best fitting polynomial is a linear one. For sample set 3, the
best fitting polynomial found was a second order polynomial. The deviation from
linearity between the linear regression and the second order polynomial met the
acceptance criteria. All four sample sets showed dilution linearity individually and in
combination:

and compared with the results obtained by the instrument with the auto-rerun feature.
Obtained results were divided by expected results (those obtained after manual
dilution) to calculate percent recovery. Recovery values were 93.5%, 99.6% and
104.9%, with an average of 99.3% recovery for the RF IgM assay. Recovery values
were 104.0% and 104.9%, with an average of 104.4% recovery for the RF IgA assay.
Hook effect: Two high positive samples with RF IgM concentrations above the assay
measuring range (1755.2 IU/mL and 1830.6 IU/mL) were tested to evaluate a
potential hook effect. No hook effect was observed up to 1830.6 IU/mL. Two high
positive samples with RF IgA concentrations above the assay measuring range
(3151.8 CU and 42710.4 CU) were tested to evaluate a potential hook effect. No
hook effect was observed up to 42710.4 CU.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: For the QUANTA Flash RF IgM, Master Curve Standards are traceable
to the WHO Reference Reagent – Rheumatoid Arthritis Serum (NIBSC code:
W1066). Based upon this standardization, results are reported in International Units
(IU)/mL. For the QUANTA Flash RF IgA, no international standard serum for RF
IgA antibodies is available that allows for the standardization of RF IgA antibody
assays.
Stability:
Kit stability (unopened): The real-time and accelerated stability of each kit was tested
using three lots of kits (with three different lots of RF IgM or RF IgA paramagnetic
beads), calibrators, and controls. Both the real-time and accelerated stability testing
supports a claim of one year at stability for unopened kits, calibrators and controls
stored at 2–8°C.
Opened Reagent Cartridges: To establish the in-use stability of each assay, two lots
of cartridges were tested with eight RF IgM and six RF IgA specimens (with different
reactivity levels) along with the Negative and Positive Controls. The specimens were
tested periodically for 91 days and the results were compared to internal criteria. The
onboard stability of both assays was set at 80 days.
Sample stability: For the QUANTA Flash RF IgM, five human serum samples, (one
negative, one around the cut-off , and three positive samples) and for the QUANTA
Flash RF IgA four human serum samples, (one negative, one around the cut-off, and
two positive samples) were tested in duplicates for up to 21 days while stored at 2–
8°C; up to 48 hours while stored at room temperature; and after repeated freeze/thaw
cycles up to three cycles. Results were compared to those obtained on control
samples at time zero. Based on the results, the sponsor recommends that the samples
can be stored up to 48 hours at room temperature; up to 14 days at 2–8°C; and can be
subjected to up to three freeze/thaw cycles (when samples are stored at or below
−20°C).

d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB): The LoB of each assay was determined by assaying four
system rinse (blank) samples in five replicates per sample over three days with two
reagent lots. A total of 60 data points per lot were generated. The LoB for each lot
was calculated separately. The LoB of both two RF IgM lots was below the
measuring range and was determined to be 0.0 IU/mL (415 RLU) and 0.0 IU/mL (450
RLU). The claimed LoB value for the QUANTA Flash RF IgM assay is 0.0 IU/mL.
The LoB of both two QUANTA Flash RF IgA lots was determined to be 0.3 CU and
0.1 CU/mL. The claimed LoB value for the RF IgA assay is 0.3 CU.
Limit of Detection (LoD): The LoD of each assay was determined by assaying four
low-level samples with RF IgM or RF IgA tested in five replicates over three days on
two reagent lots (60 replicates per lot). The LoD value was determined consistent
with CLSI EP17-A2 guideline with proportions of false positives (alpha) less than 5%
and false negatives (beta) less than 5%. The determined LoD of the QUANTA Flash
RF IgM assay for the two lots were below the measuring range of one lot (0.0 IU/mL)
and 0.1 IU/mL for the other; the claimed LoD is 0.1 IU/mL. The determined LoD of
both lots of the QUANTA Flash RF IgA assay was 0.5 CU; the claimed LoD is 0.5
CU.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ): The LoQ of both assays was determined by testing four
low level samples run in replicates of five for three days on two reagent lots (30
replicates per sample). The LoQ was determined with a total within-laboratory
imprecision of 20%. The claimed QUANTA Flash RF IgM LoQ is 0.3 IU/mL while
the claimed QUANTA Flash RF IgA is 1.2 CU.
e. Analytical specificity:
The interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A2. Four serum
specimens were tested (negative: near the cut-off, low positive, and high positive) for
each assay. Interfering substances were spiked into every specimen in 10% of total
specimen volume, and the resulting samples were assessed in triplicate. Recovery of
the unit values was calculated compared to control samples spiked with the same
volume of diluent (10% of total). No interference was identified in either assays by
the following substances at the stated concentrations:

f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-offs of the QUANTA Flash RF assays was determined by testing a set of
samples from a reference population of 191 samples [117 apparently healthy donors;
27 infectious disease controls; 13 false positive samples; 12 antiphospholipid
syndrome; 9 systemic lupus erythematosus; 8 celiac diseas;, and 5 vasculitis]. The
cut-off was established based on the 95th percentile of the results obtained on the
reference subjects, along with the results of 42 samples from patients with rheumatoid
arthritis, to provide optimal differentiation between positive and negative samples.
From these studies, the RF IgM cut-off was assigned at 5 IU/mL and the RF IgA cut-
off was assigned at 6 CU.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Samples from the clinical validation studies (see below) were tested with QUANTA
Flash RF assays and the predicate QUANTA Lite RF assays. Samples within the
assays’ measuring ranges were included in the method comparison analysis (577 for
the RF IgM assay and 612 samples for the RF IgA assay).
