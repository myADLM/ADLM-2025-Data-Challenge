4. Panel:
83- Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
For use with MicroScan Dried Gram Negative MIC/Combo Panels and Dried Gram
Negative Breakpoint Combo panels. MicroScan panels are designed for use in
determining antimicrobial agent susceptibility and/or identification to the species level of
aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli.
2. Indication(s) for Use
The MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel is used to determine
quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on
solid media of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacilli.
After inoculation, panels are incubated for 16-20 hours at 35 °C ± 1°C in a non-CO
2
incubator, and read either visually or with MicroScan instrumentation, according to the
Package Insert.
This particular submission is for the addition of the antimicrobial eravacycline (ERV) at
concentrations of 0.016 – 32 µg/mL to the test panel.
The gram-negative organisms which may be used for eravacycline susceptibility testing
on this panel are as follows:
Eravacycline has been shown to be active both clinically and in vitro against the gram-
negative bacteria listed below according to the FDA drug approved label:
Citrobacter freundii
Enterobacter cloacae
Escherichia coli
Klebsiella oxytoca
Klebsiella pneumoniae
Eravacycline has been shown to be active in vitro only against the gram negative bacteria
listed below according to the FDA drug approved label:
Citrobacter koseri
Klebsiella (Enterobacter) aerogenes

--- Page 3 ---
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Prescription use only.
The following limitations are included in labeling:
Due to the lack of an intermediate interpretive category for Eravacycline,
results obtained with C. freundii, E. cloacae, K. oxytoca and K. pneumoniae
with both the Prompt and turbidity inoculation methods and read using
autoSCAN-4 and manual read showed potential very major errors compared
to the reference method. If critical to patient care, testing should be repeated
using an alternative testing/reference method prior to reporting results when
the Eravacycline MIC is 0.5 for C. freundii complex, E. cloacae complex, K.
oxytoca and K. pneumoniae.
Results obtained with C. freundii and eravacycline with turbidity inoculation
and the Prompt inoculation system with the autoSCAN-4 read were outside of
essential agreement compared to the reference method. Results should be
confirmed using a manual read.
The ability of the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative Panels to detect non-
susceptible isolates to Eravacycline is unknown for C. koseri, E. coli, E. (K.)
aerogenes and K. oxytoca because an insufficient number of non-susceptible
strains were available at the time of comparative testing.
4. Special instrument requirements:
MicroScan panels can be read either manually or automatically on the WalkAway or
autoSCAN-4 instrument systems.
I. Device Description:
The MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo panel with eravacycline is used to
determine the quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of aerobic and
facultatively anaerobic gram negative bacilli colonies grown on solid media. After
inoculation, panels are incubated for 16-20 hours at 35°C ± 1°C in a non-CO incubator and
2
read either visually or with MicroScan instrumentation according to the package insert.
Inoculation methods: Turbidity, Prompt Inoculation System
Read methods: Manual, MicroScan WalkAway System and MicroScan autoSCAN-4

(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA
2. CLSI M07-A11. Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria
that Grow Aerobically. 11th ed. (January, 2018)
3. CLSI M100. Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. 28th
ed. (January 2018)
L. Test Principle:
The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are dehydrated miniaturizations of the broth dilution
susceptibility test. Various antimicrobial agents are diluted in Mueller Hinton broth
supplemented with calcium and magnesium to concentrations spanning the range of clinical
interest. Breakpoint Combo panels use concentrations equivalent to the categorical
breakpoints of FDA and/or CLSI. After inoculation and rehydration with a standardized
suspension of organism and incubation at 35°C for a minimum of 16 hours, the minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test organism is determined by observing the lowest
antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three external sites using 11 isolates of
gram negative bacilli that were consistent with the intended use. The range of
Eravacycline dilutions tested was 0.016 – 32 µg/mL. Isolates were tested in triplicate
over three days for a total of 297 data points. The isolates tested in the reproducibility
study included C. freundii (one isolate) K. aerogenes (one isolate), E. cloacae (two
isolates), E. coli (three isolates), K. oxytoca (one isolate) and K. pneumoniae (three
isolates).
Inocula were prepared using both the turbidity and Prompt method and results were
read manually and with the WalkAway and autoSCAN-4 instrument systems. All data
points were on-scale and the majority were within ± one doubling dilution agreement
as compared to the mode MIC (Table 2). Because all results were on-scale, only a
single value is reported for each read method.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Inoculum Density Check. A spectrophotometric device, the MicroScan Turbidity
Meter, was used to ensure quality control of the turbidity inoculum method. The
inocula prepared using the turbidity method inocula were standardized using the
MicroScan Turbidity Meter with a reading of 0.08 ± 0.02 (equivalent to a 0.5
McFarland barium sulfate turbidity standard). The digital reading was recorded each
day of use.
During the clinical study, organism suspension density data was collected using the
QC strain E. coli ATCC 25922 for suspensions inoculated using both the Prompt and
turbidity inoculation methods. For the turbidity method, the average colony count was
4.9 X 105 CFU/mL, within the expected range of 2-8 X 105 CFU/mL. For suspensions
inoculated using the Prompt method, the average colony counts were slightly higher
than the expected range at 9.1 X 105 CFU/mL.
Organism density data was also collected for suspensions prepared using the Prompt
inoculum preparation method for organisms included in the reproducibility study.
Colony counts were within the acceptable range for E. coli (nine suspensions), K.
oxytoca (three suspensions) and K. pneumoniae (nine suspensions). Colony counts
were elevated for C. freundii (1.0 X 106, three suspensions), E. cloacae (1.1 X 106,
six suspensions) and K. aerogenes (1.4 X 106, three suspensions). Although the
inoculum concentration was higher than the expected range, the essential agreement
(EA) for E. cloacae and K. aerogenes was acceptable for all read methods. The EA
for C. freundii was acceptable for both the WalkAway and manual read methods; a
low EA for C. freundii with Prompt inoculation and the autoSCAN-4 read method
(with MIC values lower than the reference method) is addressed in a labeling
limitation (see Comparison Studies below).

Purity Check. Purity check plates were performed for all isolates tested.
Growth Failure Rate. During the course of the study there were no growth failures
with the MicroScan panel with eravacycline.
Quality Control Testing. The CLSI recommended QC organisms (E. coli ATCC
25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853) were tested using all inoculation and read
methods using twelve concentrations of eravacycline (0.016 – 32 µg/mL). The
reference panel was inoculated using the turbidity method only. Results of QC testing
are shown in Table 3 below.
Although not indicated for clinical use with eravacycline, P. aeruginosa ATCC
27853 provided MIC results that are within-range for both the Prompt and turbidity
inoculation methods with all read methods (WalkAway, autoSCAN-4 and manual
read). For E. coli ATCC 25922, quality control results were within the acceptable
range of both the Prompt and turbidity inoculation method with the WalkAway and
manual read methods. However, results obtained with the autoSCAN-4 read method
were within the acceptable range for only 85% (103/121) and 86.0% (104/121) of
trials using the Prompt and turbidity inoculation method, respectively. The out of
range QC results were not due to technical error. The sponsor included the following
footnote to the quality control table in the device labeling:
QC testing with E. coli ATCC 25922 may provide out-of-range results using
autoSCAN-4, results should be confirmed using a manual read.
In addition, to indicate to users that P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 should be used only
for the purpose of QC, the sponsor included the following footnote to the quality
control table in the device labeling:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The results obtained with the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel
with eravacycline (dilution range of 0.016 – 32 µg/mL) were compared to results
obtained using a frozen broth microdilution reference panel (dilution range of 0.016 –
32 µg/mL) at three testing sites in the U.S.
The reference panel was prepared according to CLSI M07, 11th edition guidelines
except for the use of Pluronic-F in the inoculum water for the reference panel. A
validation study was performed to demonstrate equivalence between reference panels
inoculated with organisms suspended in water supplemented with Pluronic-F and
reference panels inoculated with autoclaved distilled water without Pluronic-F. The
effect of Pluronic-F in the reference panel was determined with the following species:
C. freundii (one isolate), E. cloacae (two isolates), E. coli (three isolates), K.
aerogenes (one isolate), K. oxytoca (one isolate) and K. pneumoniae (three isolates).

using Pluronic-F as the diluent as compared to MIC values obtained using autoclaved
distilled water as the diluent was 100%.
For each organism tested, MicroScan panels and reference panels were inoculated
using the same standardized suspension further diluted into 25 mL of water with
either Pluronic-D (for the MicroScan dried panels) or Pluronic-F (for the frozen
reference panels). Reference panels were inoculated using the turbidity inoculation
method. MicroScan panels were inoculated using both the Prompt System and by the
turbidity method and read using the WalkAway and autoSCAN-4 instruments and by
manual read. The reference panels were read manually
Clinical Study:
To determine the performance of the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo
Panel with eravacycline, a total of 414 Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates were
evaluated. The testing included the following indicated species: C. freundii (44
isolates), C. koseri (57 isolates), E. cloacae (20 isolates), E. cloacae complex (45
isolates), E. coli (64 isolates), K. (Enterobacter) aerogenes (55 isolates), K. oxytoca
(49 isolates) and K. pneumoniae (59 isolates). An additional 21 isolates of non-
indicated species were also evaluated. Of the clinical isolates, 277 (66.9%) were fresh
isolates (tested within seven days of isolation), 87 (21.0%) were recent isolates (tested
within one year of isolation) and 50 (12.1%) were stock isolates (tested within three
years of isolation).
Challenge Study:
A total of 79 Enterobacteriaceae challenge isolates were evaluated. These included
C. freundii (8 isolates), C. koseri (6 isolates), E. cloacae (16 isolates), E. coli (15
isolates), K. (Enterobacter) aerogenes (4 isolates), K. oxytoca (6 isolates) and K.
pneumoniae (24 isolates).
For the Enterobacteriaceae the overall essential agreement, essential agreement of
evaluable and category agreement for all inoculation and read methods was
acceptable at ≥ 90% for the dilution series of 0.016 – 32 µg/m. Performance data is
shown in Tables 4 and 5.

* NA, Not applicable due to only a susceptible interpretive criterion for eravacycline
Due to the lack of an intermediate or resistant interpretive category for eravacycline,
only major and very major errors could be determined and a number of those errors
were observed. However, many of those errors were otherwise within essential
agreement of the reference method. The error rates are reported as determined in the
clinical study. However, the error rates are adjusted by taking into consideration the
essential agreement with the reference method of MIC values resulting in the errors.
The original and adjusted error rates are shown in Table 6.
The sponsor included the following footnote to the performance table in the device
labeling:
The overall potential very major error rate for eravacycline was elevated for
Enterobacteriaceae with Prompt/autoSCAN-4 and Prompt/manual read and for
Turbidity inoculation with all read methods. All potential very major errors were
one dilution apart from the reference method and as such fall within essential
agreement. Based on the essential agreement and lack of an intermediate
breakpoint for Eravacycline, the adjusted very major error rate for
Enterobacteriaceae is 0%. The overall major error rate for Enterobacteriaceae
was acceptable. However, potential major errors were observed for E. cloacae
and K. oxytoca with Prompt/all read methods and for C. freundii and K.
pneumoniae with turbidity/WalkAway. The adjusted major error rate was
acceptable.
In addition, the sponsor included the following limitation to the performance table in
the device labeling related to the potential for major and very major errors:
Due to the lack of an intermediate interpretive category for Eravacycline, results
obtained with C. freundii, E. cloacae, K. oxytoca and K. pneumoniae with both
the Prompt and turbidity inoculation methods and read using autoSCAN-4 and
manual read showed potential very major errors compared to the reference
method. If critical to patient care, testing should be repeated using an alternative
testing/reference method prior to reporting results when the Eravacycline MIC is
0.5 for C. freundii complex, E. cloacae complex, K. oxytoca and K. pneumoniae.

Results obtained with C. freundii showed EA and EA of evaluable results of 80.8%
and 88.5% using the autoSCAN-4 read method and inoculated using the Prompt and
turbidity inoculation methods, respectively. The sponsor included the following
limitation in the device labeling:
Results obtained with C. freundii and eravacycline with turbidity inoculation and
the Prompt inoculation system with the autoSCAN-4 read were outside of
essential agreement compared to the reference method. Results should be
confirmed using a manual read.
To address the lack of non-susceptible isolates evaluated in the study, the sponsor
included the following limitation in the device labeling:
The ability of the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative Panels to detect non-
susceptible isolates to Eravacycline is unknown for C. koseri, E. coli, E. (K.)
aerogenes and K. oxytoca because an insufficient number of non-susceptible
strains were available at the time of comparative testing.

Resistance mechanism Characterization
Challenge isolates of Enterobacteriaceae harboring various molecular mechanisms of
resistance noted in the FDA drug label were tested with eravacycline. The following
resistance mechanisms were evaluated: tet(A) and tet(B).
MIC Trending
An analysis of trending was conducted using the combined clinical and challenge data
for each organism group and for each inoculation and read method. This trending
calculation takes into account MIC values that are determined to be one or more
doubling dilutions lower or higher compared to the reference method irrespective of
whether the device MIC values are on-scale or not. Results that are not clearly at least
one dilution lower, at least one dilution higher or in exact agreement with the CLSI
reference method are not considered in the trending analysis.
Trending results for indicated species and overall trending for indicated
Enterobacteriaceae are shown in Table 7; results were stratified by species to
determine if species-related trends were observed. Species for which the difference
between the percentage of isolates with higher vs. lower readings was ≥ 30% and for
which the confidence interval was determined to be statistically significant were
considered to show evidence of trending. Trending that provides higher or lower MIC
values compared to the reference is addressed in labeling.
A trend toward lower MIC readings was observed for Enterobacteriaceae using the
Prompt inoculation method and read manually or using the WalkAway or autoSCAN-
4 instruments (Table 7). A trend toward lower MIC readings was observed for
Enterobacteriaceae using the turbidity inoculation method and read using the
autoSCAN-4 instrument. The sponsor included the following footnote to the
performance table in the device labeling:
Eravacycline MIC values for Enterobacteriaceae were most frequently in exact
agreement with the reference method. When not in agreement, results by
Turbidity/autoSCAN-4 and Prompt/autoSCAN-4, Prompt/WalkAway and
Prompt/Manual tended to be one doubling dilution lower than the reference
method.

N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device when evaluated
with the current FDA-recognized eravacycline breakpoints.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a finding
of substantial equivalence.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410
971.htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that Beckman
Coulter intends to use to evaluate the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panels
with Eravacycline (ERV) (0.016 – 32 µg/mL) when revised breakpoints for eravacycline are
published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included with the
submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, Beckman Coulter will update the
eravacycline device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance
section after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints,
and (3) any new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
