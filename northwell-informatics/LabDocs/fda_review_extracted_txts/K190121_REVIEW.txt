The reagent cartridge contains:
• MPT1 (Magnetic particles) – Magnetic particles coated with streptavidin in a buffer
containing preservative, one bottle, 2.5 mL.
• Ab-BIOT (Biotin antibody) – Mouse monoclonal anti-SHBG labelled with biotin in a
buffer containing proteins and preservatives, one bottle, 7.5 mL.
• CONJ (Conjugate) – Mouse monoclonal anti-SHBG antibody labeled with an
acridinium ester derivative in a buffer containing proteins and preservatives, one
bottle, 7.5 mL.
• DIL (Diluent) – Buffer containing a preservative, one bottle, 18.0 mL.
The calibrators A and B are included in the assay kit. The calibrators consist of a human
serum matrix with defined concentrations of SHBG and preservatives. Together with a lot
specific master calibration curve, the calibrators are used to perform the adjustment of the
master calibration curve.

L. Test Principle:
The IDS SHBG assay is based on chemiluminescence technology. Patient sample or
calibrators are incubated with the biotinylated monoclonal anti-SHBG antibody, an
acridinium labeled monoclonal anti-SHBG conjugate and streptavidin labeled magnetic
particles. The magnetic particles are captured using a magnet and a wash step is performed
to remove any unbound analyte. Trigger reagents are added; the resulting light emitted by
the acridinium label is directly proportional to the concentration of analyte in the original
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was conducted at an internal site by two operators using thirteen
serum based samples at concentrations spanning the measuring range, each run on
three IDS-iSYS Multi-Discipline Automated System and three reagent cartridge lots
for 21 days, with two runs per day in two replicates, for a total of 84 replicates per
sample per each of the three kit lots/systems. The study was performed following the
CLSI EP05-A3 guideline. The summary result from a representative lot is included
in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was conducted for the serum and the K EDTA plasma matrices
2
following the CLSI EP06-A guideline. A dilution series of sixteen levels per matrix
type were prepared using a high-SHBG sample (above the upper limit of the assay,
180 nmol/L) and a low SHBG sample (close to the LoQ, +/- 0.30 nmol/L). Each
level was assayed in quadruplicate. The summary results are shown below.
Serum: Concentration range assayed: 0.013 to 185.803 nmol/L.
y = 1.000x - 0.543; R2: 0.999
K EDTA plasma: Concentration range assayed: 0.022 to 180.921 nmol/L.
2
y = 0.967x - 0.464; R2: 0.998
Based on the study results, the IDS SHBG assay is linear over the claimed measuring
range of 1.60 to 180.00 nmol/L.
Dilution Recovery Study: The sponsor conducted a recovery study to support an
extended reportable range up to 720 nmol/L.
The recovery study was conducted using nine native samples spanning SHBG
concentrations from 310.24 to 726.84 nmol/L (as measured by the predicate device).
The samples were automatically diluted 1:4 onboard of the IDS-iSYS Multi-
Discipline Automated System and measured by the candidate device in singlicate.
The percent recovery ranged from 87% to 100% compared to the expected
concentration. The results of the dilution study support the sponsor’s claims that
samples with SHBG concentrations above the 180 nmol/L may be diluted 1:4 on-
onboard the analyzer to obtain results up to 720 nmol/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The IDS SHBG assay is traceable to the WHO 2nd international standard 08/266.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ)
studies were conducted per CLSI EP17-A guideline.
The LoB blank sample was run in twelve replicates for each of five runs over three
days, by one operator for each kit lot/analyzer for a total of sixty replicates per lot

with at least two hours interval between runs. The study was conducted using three
device lots on three analyzers. Data was analyzed using the non-parametric approach
and LoB was calculated based on type I alpha error of 0.05 (5%).
Each of the seven LoD samples was measured in duplicate for a total of five assays
run over three days by one operator on each kit lot/analyzer, for a total of seventy
replicates per lot with at least two hours interval between runs. The study was
conducted using three device lots on three analyzers. Data was analyzed using the
parametric approach. LoD was determined using the formula LoD=LoB + 1.645 x
pooled SD based on the lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be detected
with type II beta error of 0.05 (5%).
For calculation of the LoQ, a panel of nine samples were measured in singlicate two
times per day for a total of ten assays run over five days by one operator on each kit
lot/analyzer, for a total of ninety replicates per lot with at least two hours interval
between runs. The study was conducted using three device lots on three analyzers.
LoQ was calculated from the regression curve of the plot of %CV of measured
concentration versus sample concentration as determined from the candidate device.
The LoQ is the concentration interpolated from the regression curve at the 20 % CV
level.
The summary results for LoB, LoD and LoQ are shown below.
Limits of SHBG
Detection Concentration
LoB 0.01 nmol/L
LoD 0.15 nmol/L
LoQ 0.30 nmol/L
The claimed measuring range of the IDS SHBG assay is from 1.60 to 180.00 nmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference and cross-reactivity studies were conducted following the CLSI EP7-A2
guideline.
Interference Study: Twenty potential interfering substances were tested at two SHBG
concentrations (approximately 25-30 nmol/L and 100-120 nmol/L). Control samples
(blank) for each of the two SHBG samples were spiked with a volume of relevant
diluent equal to that of the spiked interferent. The samples were assayed in 26
replicates. Non-significant interference is defined as bias ≤ ±10%. The summary
results are shown below.

Cross-Reactivity Study: Fifteen cross-reactants were evaluated in the study. Cross-
reactant solutions were prepared by manufacturing a ‘top dose’ of the relevant analyte
which was then diluted down to a range of stock concentrations in undetectable
SHBG matrix (serum based zero matrix). The stock cross reactant or zero matrix was
spiked directly into a low SHBG sample and a high SHBG sample. The cross
reactivity was determined using the below equation,
% cross reactivity = [(Mean SHBG conc. of spiked sample – mean SHBG conc. of
un-spiked sample) x100%] / Cross-reactant spiked concentration
