For prescription use
The following limitations are included in the labeling:
• The ability of ETEST Piperacillin/Tazobactam to detect the following resistant
Enterobacteriaceae isolates is unknown because resistant isolates were either not

--- Page 3 ---
available or an insufficient number was encountered at the time of comparative
testing: Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Salmonella enterica.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Manual reading only
I. Device Description:
The ETEST gradient technology is based on a combination of the concepts of dilution and
diffusion principles for susceptibility testing.
The ETEST consists of a thin, inert, nonporous plastic strip that is used to determine the
antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria. One side of the strip has the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) reading scale expressed in μg/mL. The other side of the strip contains a
predefined continuous exponential gradient of antibiotic concentrations.
When the strip is applied to an inoculated agar surface, the preformed antibiotic gradient
immediately transfers into the agar matrix, then forming a stable, continuous and exponential
gradient of antibiotic concentrations directly underneath the strip. Bacterial growth becomes
visible during incubation, and a symmetrical inhibition ellipse centered along the strip
appears. The MIC value is read from the scale in terms of μg/mL at complete inhibition of
bacterial growth, where the pointed end of the ellipse intersects the strip.
ETEST Piperacillin/Tazobactam contains a range of piperacillin from 0.016 to 256 μg/mL,
overlaid with a fixed concentration of 4 μg/mL of tazobactam.

L. Test Principle:
The ETEST consists of a thin, inert, nonporous plastic strip that is used to determine the
antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria. One side of the strip carries the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) reading scale expressed in μg/mL. The other side of the strip contains a
predefined continuous gradient of antibiotic concentrations.
When the strip is applied to an inoculated agar surface, the preformed antibiotic gradient
immediately transfers into the agar matrix, then forming a stable, continuous and exponential
gradient of antibiotic concentrations directly underneath the strip. Bacteria growth becomes
visible during incubation, and a symmetrical inhibition ellipse centered along the strip appears.
After incubation, the MIC value is read from the scale in terms of μg/mL at complete inhibition
of bacterial growth, where the pointed end of the ellipse intersects the strip. Since ETEST
generates MIC values which fall between two-fold dilutions for interpretation, the MIC value
read must be recorded to the next two-fold dilution.
The MIC gradient on ETEST Piperacillin/Tazobactam ranges from 0.016/4 to 256/4 μg/mL.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing was conducted at three sites over three days using a Gram-
negative panel that included two A. baumannii, three E. coli, two K. pneumoniae, one
M. morganii and two P. aeruginosa isolates. The mode of MIC values was
determined for each isolate and the reproducibility was calculated based on the
number of MIC values that fell within ±1 doubling dilution of the mode.
The reproducibility results were acceptable at 100%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable

--- Page 6 ---
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Inoculum Density Check. Inoculum density checks were performed for all quality
control and reproducibility organism suspensions and for 10% of the suspensions
prepared for susceptibility testing of the fresh (contemporary) clinical isolates.
The overall mean inoculum densities (CFU/mL) for isolates tested with the reference
method ranged from 3.84 x 105 to 5.84 x 105. The overall mean inoculum densities
for isolates tested with the ETEST ranged from 5.4 x 107 to 1.71 x 108.
The inoculum densities were acceptable.
Purity Check. Verification of isolate purity was conducted on all clinical, challenge
and reproducibility organism suspensions for each ETEST and from each growth
control well of the broth microdilution (BMD) reference panel.
Growth or Device Failure. No device failures occurred in the ETEST
Piperacillin/Tazobactam clinical trial.
Quality Control (QC) Testing. The FDA and CLSI recommended QC strains (E.
coli ATCC 25922, E. coli ATCC 35218, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and K.
pneumoniae ATCC 700603) were tested at least 20 times per site at four sites using
both ETEST and BMD reference methods. The results are summarized in Table 2.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Results obtained with ETEST Piperacillin/Tazobactam were compared to results
obtained with the CLSI broth microdilution (BMD) reference panel. The reference
panel, prepared and interpreted according to recommendations outlined in the CLSI
M07-A10, contained two-fold serial dilutions of piperacillin/tazobactam with a
piperacillin concentration range of 0.016 – 256 μg/mL (tazobactam concentration
fixed at 4 µg/mL). At the end of incubation, the MIC value obtained from the ETEST
(where the complete inhibition of growth intersects the strip) was compared to MIC
results obtained with the reference method. The testing conditions for ETEST
consisted of the following:
• Inoculum: Direct colony suspension to achieve a suspension equivalent to a 0.5
McFarland standard suspension
• Medium: Cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton agar
• Incubation: 35° C ± 2 for 16-20 hours (except A. baumannii, incubate at 35° C for
20-24 hours)
Clinical testing for ETEST Piperacillin/Tazobactam was evaluated at three external
sites within the United States and one internal site located outside the United States.
Each clinical isolate was tested one time by ETEST and BMD using the same initial
standardized suspension. A total of 772 clinical isolates were tested which included
592 Enterobacteriaceae [C. koseri (41), E. coli (140), K. pneumoniae (167), M.
morganii (39), P. mirabilis (38), P. vulgaris (31), P. rettgeri (28), P. stuartii (36), S.
enterica (31) and S. marcescens (41)], 74 A. baumannii and 106 P. aeruginosa
isolates. Of all of the tested clinical isolates, 49.2% were considered contemporary
(i.e., tested within six months of the organism’s original isolation from clinical
culture) and 50.8% were considered stock (i.e., no time limit on time from isolation
prior to testing).
Challenge testing was performed at one internal site using ETEST and BMD. A total
of 89 challenge isolates were tested which included 67 Enterobacteriaceae [C. koseri
(5), E. coli (28), K. pneumoniae (23), M. morganii (2), P. mirabilis (3), S. marcescens
(6)], 9 A. baumannii and 13 P. aeruginosa isolates.
The comparative study (both clinical and challenge) included 659 Enterobacteriaceae
isolates [C. koseri (46), E. coli (168), K. pneumoniae (190), M. morganii (41), P.
mirabilis (41), P. vulgaris (31), P. rettgeri (28), P. stuartii (36), S. enterica (31) and
S. marcescens (47)]. Information on the numbers of each Enterobacteriaceae species
is included as a footnote to the performance table in the labeling.

Essential Agreement (EA) is when the ETEST result agrees exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference
broth microdilution result. Category Agreement (CA) is when the ETEST result interpretation agrees exactly with the
reference broth microdilution result interpretation.
Overall Performance
ETEST Piperacillin/Tazobactam performance for all Enterobacteriaceae isolates is
acceptable with 95.8% EA and 93.3% CA. There were 42 minor errors, no major
errors, and two very major errors. When evaluating individual species, however,
performance of K. pneumoniae was unacceptable with 88.9% CA (94.2% EA). Since
this species also had a very major error rate of 2% (2 VMJ / 99 resistant isolates), the
following footnote is included in the performance section of the device labeling:
Categorical errors when testing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were mostly due
to minor errors (19/190, 10%). Two of 99 resistant isolates gave a very major
error. Upon repeat testing, a reference MIC value could not be confidently
established for one of the isolates due to extensive variability with the reference
method.
ETEST Piperacillin/Tazobactam performance for all A. baumannii isolates is
acceptable with 91.6% EA and 89.2% CA. There were nine minor errors and no
major or very major errors.

ETEST Piperacillin/Tazobactam performance for all P. aeruginosa is acceptable with
98.3% EA and 93.3% CA. There were eight minor errors and no major or very major
errors.
At the time of comparative testing, resistant isolates were not available for several
bacterial species. Thus, the following limitation is included in the device labeling:
The ability of ETEST Piperacillin/Tazobactam to detect the following resistant
Enterobacteriaceae isolates is unknown because resistant isolates were either not
available or an insufficient number was encountered at the time of comparative
testing: Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Salmonella enterica.
To address testing of non-indicated species, the sponsor included the following
statement in the Warnings and Precautions section of the device labeling:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the
safety and efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility
is tested by this AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate
and well-controlled clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to
microorganisms outside of those found in the indications and usage in the drug
label. The clinical significance of susceptibility information in those instances is
unknown. The approved labeling for specific antimicrobial drugs provides the
uses for which the antimicrobial drug is approved.
Inoculator and ETEST Strip Applicator Options

with the RETRO C80 inoculator. ETEST strips can be applied onto inoculated media
using forceps or the NEMA C88 vacuum pen.
The ETEST Piperacillin/Tazobactam studies used manual inoculation with swabs and
applied ETEST strips with forceps at all test sites. The following footnote is included
in the performance section of the device labeling:
Optional inoculator and ETEST strip applicator can be used for plate inoculation
and applying ETEST strips onto agar media. In the ETEST Piperacillin/
Tazobactam clinical studies, swabs were used for plate inoculation/streaking and
forceps were used for ETEST strip application.
Trending
A trending analysis was conducted using the combined data (clinical and challenge)
for each organism species and group. This trending calculation analyzes device MIC
values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or higher than
the reference method. MIC values that are off-scale for both the reference and device
are not considered in the trending analysis.

--- Page 12 ---
Trending results were stratified by species to determine if species-related trends were
observed (Table 6). Species for which the difference between the percentage of
isolates with higher versus lower MIC values was ≥30% and for which the confidence
interval was determined to be statistically significant were considered to have
evidence of significant trending and is addressed in labeling.
A trend toward lower MIC values was observed for K. pneumoniae while a trend
toward higher MIC values was observed for A. baumannii, M. morganii, P. mirabilis,
P. rettgeri, P. stuartii and S. marcescens. The following footnotes are included in the
performance section of the device labeling to address the trending:
ETEST Piperacillin/Tazobactam MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or
at least one doubling dilution lower when testing Klebsiella pneumoniae
compared to the CLSI reference broth microdilution.
ETEST Piperacillin/Tazobactam MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or
at least one doubling dilution higher when testing A. baumannii, M. morganii, P.
mirabilis, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii and S. marcescens compared to the CLSI
reference broth microdilution.
