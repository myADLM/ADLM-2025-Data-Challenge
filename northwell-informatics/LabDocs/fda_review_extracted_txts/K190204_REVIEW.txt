SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
OIR Review Summary
510(k) Number: K190204
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the applicant’s own Class II
devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:
1. The name and 510(k) number of the applicant’s previously cleared device:
Alere i Influenza A & B 2
510(k) number: K173932
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described
in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions
for use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials (labeling changes
are permitted as long as they do not affect the intended use).
3. Description of the device MODIFICATION(S):
The results interpretation in the Package Insert and QRI for dual positive influenza A and B results
has been changed to simplify the follow up steps. This is a labeling update only, there have been no
changes to the Intended Use or fundamental scientific technology of the ID NOW Influenza A & B 2
assay.
The ID NOW Influenza A & B 2 Product Insert has been changed to expand the Specimen Transport
and Storage section to include instructions to allow freezing transport media specimens at -80°C
directly after collection.
To confirm assay performance will not be negatively impacted by storing VTM (viral transport
media) specimens at -80°C a Sample Freeze/Thaw study was performed. For this study negative
nasal swabs were eluted in 3mL of VTM and pooled to generate a pooled negative clinical matrix.
Positive samples were generated by spiking virus into the pooled negative clinical matrix, at LoD,
2x LoD and 10x LoD. The samples were tested before freezing and after each freeze/thaw cycle,
with a total of 3 freeze/thaw cycles. All test results were expected (except one sample, which was
correct upon re-testing). This data supports allowing specimen storage at -80°C immediately after
collection.

Intended Use The ID NOW Influenza A & B 2 assay Same
performed on the ID NOW Instrument is a
rapid molecular in vitro diagnostic test
utilizing an isothermal nucleic acid
amplification technology for the qualitative
detection and discrimination of influenza A
and B viral RNA in direct nasal or
nasopharyngeal swabs and nasal or
nasopharyngeal swabs eluted in viral
transport media from patients with signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection. It is
intended for use as an aid in the differential
diagnosis of influenza A and B viral
infections in humans in conjunction with
clinical and epidemiological risk factors. The
assay is not intended to detect the presence
of influenza C virus.
Negative results do not preclude influenza
virus infection and should not be used as the
sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other
patient management decisions.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is
suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria
recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with
appropriate infection control precautions for
novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to
state or local health department for testing.
Viral culture should not be attempted in
these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is
available to receive and culture specimens.

B. Differences
The QRI and Package Insert have minor additions to expand specimen storage to allow for
freezing specimens at -80°C and to simplify the follow-up directions for influenza A and B dual
positive results.
The following text was added to the Specimen Transport and Storage section of the Package
Insert: “Alternatively, the sample may be frozen at -80°C or colder immediately after collection.”
The results interpretation for Flu A Viral RNA Detected; Flu B Viral RNA Detected was
modified to read: “Dual infections of Flu A and Flu B are rare. Repeat testing with a new
specimen. If the result is still dual positive, repeat testing with another method before reporting
results.”
Section 7 in the QRI was modified to address dual positive infections, it now reads: “Refer to
Product Insert instructions for retest procedure in the case of a Dual Flu A and Flu B Positive or
Invalid test result.”
5. Design Control Activities Summary:
A review of the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) was conducted and documented per
Alere Scarborough, Inc. Quality System requirements. The modification made to the Product
Insert does not affect the assay procedure and this change was not expected to impact the
performance of the test or its safety and effectiveness. However, to confirm assay performance
was not negatively impacted a Sample Freeze/Thaw study was performed and is described in
section 3 above.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use
for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the applicant’s description of the particular
modifications and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate
that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control
information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be
determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
