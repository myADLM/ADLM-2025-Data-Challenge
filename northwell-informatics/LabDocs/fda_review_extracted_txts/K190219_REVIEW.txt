I. Device Description:
The Simplexa VZV Direct assay is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system that
enables the direct amplification and detection of VZV DNA from unprocessed cerebral spinal
fluid (CSF) specimens without nucleic acid extraction. The system consists of the Simplexa
VZV Direct, the Simplexa VZV Positive Control Pack, and the Direct Amplification Disc.
The assay is performed on the LIAISON MDX instrument which is controlled by an external
computer equipped with LIAISON MDX Studio Software.
The Direct Amplification Disk (DAD) consumable, disposable discs into which the PCR
reagents and test samples are manually pipetted in, is compartmentalized into eight separate
wedges and up to eight separate specimens or controls may be processed on each disc. The
disc may be reused until all wedges have been utilized. Each wedge contains sample and
reagent input wells, microfluidic channels and laser activated valves to control the fluid flow,
and a reaction chamber.
In the Simplexa VZV Direct assay, fluorescent probes are used together with corresponding
forward and reverse primers to amplify VZV and internal control targets. A well-conserved
region of the VZV DNA polymerase gene is targeted to identify VZV DNA in the specimen.
An internal control is used to detect PCR failure and/or inhibition.

L. Test Principle:
1. General Test Principle
The Simplexa VZV Direct assay is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system
that enables the direct amplification and detection of VZV DNA from unprocessed
cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) specimens without nucleic acid extraction. The system
consists of the Simplexa VZV Direct assay, the Direct Amplification Disc(DAD) and the
LIAISON MDX (with LIAISON MDX Studio Software).
In the Simplexa VZV Direct assay, fluorescent probes are used together with
corresponding forward and reverse primers to amplify VZV and internal control targets.
A well-conserved region of the VZV DNA polymerase gene is targeted to identify VZV
DNA in the specimen. An internal control is used to detect PCR failure and/or inhibition.

The Simplexa VZV Direct assay uses the
DAD consumable. The DAD consumable
is compartmentalized into eight separate
wedges and up to eight separate specimens
or controls may be processed on each disc.
The disc may be reused until all wedges
have been utilized.
The Simplexa VZV Direct assay is
performed by manually pipetting PCR
reagents and test samples into the DAD.
Each wedge contains sample and reagent
input wells, microfluidic channels and laser
activated valves to control the fluid flow,
and a reaction chamber. After loading the reagent and samples, the wells of the individual
wedge are resealed with the original top foil and the tab is removed at the perforation.
This disc is specifically designed to meter the amount of reagent (Reaction Mix) and
sample that are placed into specific wells in the disc. After sealing the foil on each
wedge, the DAD is loaded into the LIAISON MDX instrument and the run is initiated.
The system uses a combination of centrifugal force and laser-controlled valves to
combine metered aliquots of the unextracted samples and PCR reagents in the
reaction/detection chamber of each wedge in the following manner:
Centrifugal force moves the fluid into the metering chambers. Excess reagent and sample
are forced into the waste chambers by centrifugal force. At a specific point in the assay
protocol the software triggers the laser to open the sample and reagent laser valves. This
allows the fluid to pass from the sample and reagent metering wells into the reaction
chamber.
After the centrifugal force has mixed sample and reagent within the reaction chamber, the
amplification cycles begin. A sample is considered positive for a particular target if
intensity of the optical reading crosses a particular threshold before a predetermined cut-off
cycle.
2. Quality Control
Two controls should be run with this test:
a. Simplexa VZV Positive Control Pack may be used as an external control for
Quality Control (QC) testing, training or proficiency testing. The Simplexa VZV
Positive Control Pack comes with its own instruction for use.
b. Negative/No Template Control (NTC) – not included in the kit

a Typical Ct values for the Positive Control range between 27-33.
b Detection of the Simplexa DNA Internal Control (DNA IC) is not required for a valid result when VZV is detected.
3. Interpretation Of Results
Upon completion of the run, the software automatically calculates and displays results.
For each accession ID (Sample ID) entered, the software displays a result (“Detected”,
“Not Detected”, “Invalid”, “EC500, EC505 or EC515”) for VZV.
a. “Detected” result indicates the presence of varicella-zoster virus DNA in the
patient sample.
b. “Not Detected” result indicates the absence of varicella-zoster virus DNA in the
patient sample.
c. “Invalid” result indicates inability to conclusively determine presence or absence
of varicella-zoster virus DNA in the patient sample. This result may be due to 1)
Internal Control (IC) failure, or 2) failure to detect sufficient specimen
volume. The sample needs to be retested. See “Invalid Results” section below.
d. “EC500” Data processing error due to noise, weak or late amplification in the
signal. Repeat the sample. If the problem persists, contact Technical Service.
e. “EC505” Insufficient information to determine whether amplification was
present. If the problem persists, contact Technical Service.
f. “EC515” Internal control amplification is not within specification. Result is
invalid, repeat the sample. If the problem persists, contact Technical Service.
The report can be printed and/or exported as needed.
Invalid Results: In case of an “Invalid” result, re-test the sample with a new Reaction
Mix vial from the same kit or a new kit. If the problem is unresolved, contact DiaSorin
Molecular Technical Services department.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the Simplexa VZV Direct assay between laboratories was
evaluated in a study performed by two operators at each of three sites over a period of
five days using a panel of 4 contrived samples and positive and negative controls (see

below). On each day of testing each operator tested three replicates of each panel
member (5 days x 3 sites x 2 operators x 3 replicates = 90 replicates per panel
member). Table 5 below describes the reproducibility of all testing sites individually
and combined and Table 6 below provides a quantitative summary of the
reproducibility based on the CT values achieved for the reproducibility of the panel
members. The following covariates were calculated: Between site, between day,
between instrument, between run, and within run viability.
Each of the laboratories tested the following panel of six samples:
1. Simplexa VZV Direct Positive Control (PC)
2. Negative/No Template Control (NTC)
3. Four contrived sample pools prepared by spiking a specific concentration of
the VZV strain into CSF with the following VZV strains and concentrations:
• A low positive close to LoD for strain VZV 9939
• A medium positive for strain VZV 9939
• A low positive close to LoD for strain VZV Ellen
• A medium positive for strain VZV Ellen.

Inter Lot Precision – Reaction Mix
The inter-lot variability of the Simplexa VZV Direct Reaction Mix was assessed with
two instruments and three lots of reagents at Diasorin’s internal site. The panel
members were the same in concentration and formulation as the ones used in the
reproducibility study above. Testing was performed across three non-consecutive
days with 1 run for each instrument and lot per day (each by a different operator). The
design: 2 instruments X 3 Lots X 2 runs/Day X 3 days = 36 replicates per panel
member.
The inter lot precision results are shown in Table 7 (Qualitative Summary and CT
values) and Table 8 (Agreement of results).

Inter-lot Precision- Simplexa Positive Control
The Inter-lot precision study was performed at DiaSorin’s internal site. Three
Simplexa VZV Direct Positive Control (PC) lots were used to evaluate inter-lot
precision by performing a total of six runs across three non-consecutive days, two
runs per day by a single operator using a single LIAISON MDX instrument and
single lot of Simplexa VZV Direct Reaction Mix lot. Each run included at least two
replicates per Simplexa VZV Direct Positive Control lot.The results of this study are
summarized in Table 9 below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable because the Assay is qualitative.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability study: The data support a shelf-life claim of 12 months for the Simplexa VZV
Direct and the Simplexa VZV Positive Control Pack.
d. Cut-Off
Samples tested with the Simplexa VZV Direct assay are produce one of the following
results Positive, Negative or Invalid based on the comparison of Cycle Threshold (Ct)
values observed in the optical channels for VZV and the Internal Control targets to
previously determined cut-offs. The Ct cut-offs were established during development of
the assay and validated in the analytical and clinical study described in this Decision
Summary.
e. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined for the Simplexa VZV Direct assay
using quantified stocks of two VZV strains (Ellen and 9939) serially diluted into
negative human CSF Dilutions were tested with a total of 32 replicates using 2 lots
and 8 instruments across 4 non-consecutive days. The LoD was determined to be the
lowest concentration that could be detected positive > 95% of the time (see Table 10
below).

f. Analytical Reactivity:
The Simplexa VZV Direct assay was evaluated for analytical reactivity (inclusivity)
to five (5) VZV strains (VZV 82, VZV 275, VZV 1700, VZV Isolate A and VZV
Isolate B) in CSF. The study was performed with a single lot of Simplexa VZV Direct
Reaction Mix and Simplexa VZV Direct Positive Control. The study was conducted
over the course of two (2) non-consecutive days. Each titered strain was diluted into
negative CSF at a concentration of 2.0 TCID /mL. Results are included in Table 11
50
below. An additional 178 strains of VZV were evaluated by in silico analysis
(BLAST). All of these showed 100% homology, with the exception of Genbank
KU52949. For Genbank KU52949, there was a 99% homology, with one mismatch in
the Taqman probe region. This mismatch is not expected to negatively impact the
detection of this strain.

g. Analytical Specificity:
Cross-Reactivity
The Simplexa VZV Direct assay was evaluated for cross reactivity by testing 105
different bacteria, viruses and fungi which represent closely related organisms or
cause similar clinical symptoms. All samples were prepared by spiking each
potentially cross reacting organism into VZV negative pooled human CSF. For
potentially cross reacting bacteria or fungi, the testing concentration was 1x106
CFU/mL; for viruses testing was performed at 1x105 TCID /mL. No cross reactivity
50
was observed for the tested organisms at the test concentration indicated in Table 12
below.
Competitive Interferences
The Simplexa VZV Direct was evaluated for microbial inhibition (or competitive
interference by other microorganisms) by testing the same 105 different bacteria,
viruses and fungi that were tested for cross reactivity.
All samples were prepared by spiking each potentially inhibiting organism into
a baseline consisting of either the Ellen or 9939 strains of VZV at a concentration of
1-2x LoD in VZV- negative human CSF. For potentially inhibiting bacteria or fungi,
the testing concentration was 1x106 CFU/mL; for viruses the testing concentration
was 1x105 TCID /mL. For organisms not titered in CFU/mL or TCID /mL, other
50 50
industry acceptable units were used. Results are included in the last column of
Table 12 No microbial interference was observed for the tested organisms at the test
concentration indicated in Table 12 below

Interfering substances
The Simplexa VZV Direct assay was evaluated for the effects of sixteen potentially
interfering endogenous and exogenous substances.
All samples were prepared by spiking each potentially interfering substance into a
baseline sample consisting of either of the two VZV strains (Ellen or 9939) at a level
of 2x limit of detection (LoD), in pooled human CSF matrix. Each interferent was
spiked into the baseline sample and tested in triplicate at the concentration listed in
the Table 13 below.

Carry -Over/Cross-contamination Study
A study to assess the potential for carry-over/cross-contamination was conducted in
support of the Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct assay (K120413). The study design
was determined to be acceptable and no evidence of contamination was observed.
Because of the similarities in format and assay workflow with this previously cleared
device, no additional contamination studies were conducted with the Simplexa VZV
Direct assay in support of this 510k.
Sample storage and handling - Fresh versus Frozen
The Sample Storage and Handling - Fresh Vs. Frozen Study was performed
using contrived samples in CSF. For each strain (Ellen and 9939), 70 samples were
contrived at various concentrations ranging from 2x LoD up to 50x LoD as indicated
in the Table 14 (VZV Ellen strain) and Table 15 (VZV 9939 strain) below. Samples
were tested fresh (Column “Fresh”) and then transferred to refridgerated storage at 2-
8 ºC for 72 hours. Subsequent to testing (Column “Refridgerated”) samples were then
transferred to the -70 ºC freezer where they were stored for 30 days. Samples were
tested after a total of three freeze/Thaw cycles (Column “Frozen (including 3 Freeze
Thaw Cycles)”.

Clinical Agreement:
A total of 724 remnant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients suspected of
VZV infection of the central nervous system (CNS) were obtained from prospective
and prospectively banked collections from eight collection sites during the Simplexa
VZV Direct clinical study. Sites that prospectively collected samples (n= 10)
performed testing of the samples directly and then shipped an aliquot of the sample to
Diasorin Molecular for comparator testing. For the banked samples DiaSorin
Molecular aliquoted and distributed the samples for Simplexa VZV Direct testing and
the comparator testing.
Of the 724 total samples 637 clinical samples were included in the analysis based on
the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study. A total of 87 samples were excluded
from the analysis for not having sufficient volume, for not generating a final
comparator result, for not meeting the inclusion criteria, and for exceeding sample
storage.
Simplexa VZV Direct results were compared to results from a composite reference
method. The composite reference method consisted of two validated real-time PCR
assays followed by confirmation of positive PCR amplification products with bi-
directional sequencing. Samples were characterized as positive if one or both PCR
assays were positive and confirmed by bi-directional sequencing. Samples were
characterized as negative if both PCR assays were negative. All composite reference
method testing was performed at DiaSorin Molecular. Table 16 below shows the
Clinical Agreement of the Simplexa VZV Direct as compared to the composite
reference method.

routine testing.
Due to the low prevalence of VZV infection in CSF samples, contrived positive
samples were tested to supplement the number of positive samples tested. For each of

the two strains, VZV Ellen and VZV 9939, 60 samples were contrived across the
clinical range of the Simplexa VZV Direct assay with 60% of the samples contrived
as low positive samples close to the LoD of the test. Samples were tested at seven
clinical sites in a blinded manner and randomized with VZV negative samples. The
samples were stored at 2-8 °C for up to 7 days post collection and at <-70 °C
thereafter. Simplexa VZV Direct test results for contrived samples were compared to
the same Composite Reference Method described for the prospective clinical study
above. The contrived sample study demonstrated a positive percent agreement of
100% (120/120) with a 95% Confidence Interval of 96.9-100.0%. The results of the
Clinical Study stratified by the age of the subjects is shown in Table 17.
