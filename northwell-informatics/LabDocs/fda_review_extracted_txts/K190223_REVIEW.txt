M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Reproducibility:
The Cepheid Xpert CT/NG Control Panel was evaluated at three testing sites with
two operators at each site (total of six operators). Three lots of the control material
were tested with the Cepheid Xpert CT/NG assay on the Cepheid Xpert Instrument,
over five days. Each positive and negative control was tested in three replicates on
each day. There were seven ERROR results (assay aborted due to instrument or
reagent problem) and one INVALID result (failure of the internal control/s). Those
samples were retested using a new control swab according to the Instructions for Use.
All testing utilized the Xpert Vaginal/Endocervical Swab Specimen Collection kit.
The Cepheid Xpert CT/NG Assay detects one target for CT) and two different targets
for NG (NG2 and NG4). Both NG targets need to be positive for the Xpert CT/NG
Assay to return a positive NG result.
The qualitative results from the reproducibility study are summarized below.

2One Negative Control at site 1 and two Negative Control at Site 2 generated a positive result for NG2
target, however, the qualitative results were negative in each case because the Xpert CT/NG Assay
requires both NG2 and NG4 targets to be positive in order to return a positive result for NG. In
accordance with the assay protocol, the work area was cleaned and the controls were retested.

Traceability:

Stability:
1. Shelf life stability of the Cepheid Xpert CT/NG Control Panel was initially
evaluated through an accelerated study with three lots of the controls. The product
was placed into chambers at elevated temperatures: 43˚C, 53˚C and 63˚C. Each
lot was tested in 4 replicates at each of the following time points: Day 0, Day 14,
Day 28, and Day 42. The stability of the product was evaluated by calculating the
change (delta) in mean Ct value at each time point for the three microbial targets
(CT, NG2 and NG4) from the mean Ct value obtained at Day 0. Both Positive and
Negative Controls were tested.
For Positive Control, the change in Ct score for all targets, across the three lots,
ranged from 2.2% to 9.3% when stored at 43°C, from 1.6% to 9.7% when stored
at 53°C, and from 2.9% to 14.4% when stored at 63°C. All valid tests generated
expected (positive) results for all analytes.
For Negative Control, the change in Ct score for the human epithelial cells target,
across the three lots, ranged from 2.2% to 6.0% when stored at 43°C, from 3.7%
to 6.8% when stored at 53°C, and from 3.3% to 12.8% when stored at 63°C. All
valid tests generated expected (negative) results.
The data from the accelerated stability study with three lots of the product is
summarized below.

2. Real time shelf stability data was submitted for 5 months of storage at 2-8°C and
at 25°C. One lot of the product was tested in 4 replicates prior to placing the
product in the controlled temperature chambers (T=0). After 5 months (T=1),
Positive and Negative Controls were tested with the Cepheid Xpert CT/NG
Assay. The stability was assessed by calculating the mean Ct of the 4 replicates at
each time point. The difference (Δ) of the average Ct means between the two time
points, across all the measured targets (i.e., CT, NG2, NG4 and SAC), ranged
from 0 to 0.7, indicating no loss of DNA after 5 months of storage at 2-8°C and at
25°C. The summary of the data collected after 5 months of storage is shown
below.

3. An in-use stability of the hydrated Control swabs (i.e., placed in the Transport
Reagent Tube from the Xpert Vaginal/Endocervical Specimen Collection kit) was
evaluated at room temperature (21°C) over the period of 6 hours. The controls

were tested in three replicates immediately after hydration (t=0), and then again at
4 hours, and at 6 hours. All samples produced expected results after 4 and 6 hours,
with minimal variation. The summary of the data collected over 6 hours is shown
below.

4. A similar study was performed with control swabs hydrated in the Transport
Reagent Tube from the Xpert Urine Specimen Collection Kit. Due to the low fluid
volume in the Transport Reagent Tube from the Xpert Urine Specimen Collection
Kit, it is necessary for the user to add 1.5 mL of nuclease-free water to properly
hydrate the swab. This is part of the Cepheid Xpert CT/NG Control Panel
instructions for use.

5. Shipping Stability
The Cepheid CT/NG Controls are packaged in sealed foil pouches with desiccants
to prevent effects of high humidity. However, the product may be exposed and
affected by high temperatures. The product is shipped by FedEx for delivery in
two days, however, delays may be encountered. The effect of exposure to high
temperatures was evaluated at 43°C after 14 days (the worst-case delay scenario)
in the accelerated stability study described above. The observed change in Ct
values (a measure of product deterioration) was less than 5%, ranging from 2.2%
to 4.3% for the positive control (for all the microbial targets), and from 2.2% to
4.5% for the negative control (human cells target), across three lots of the product.
Expected Values:
The Cepheid CT/NG Control Panel consists of qualitative positive and negative
controls. The following are the expected assay results.
