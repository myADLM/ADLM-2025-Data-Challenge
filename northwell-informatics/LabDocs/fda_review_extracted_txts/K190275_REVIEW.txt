C Type of Test:
Qualitative real-time DNA amplification and detection assay.
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
The GenePOC Carba assay, performed on the revogene instrument, is a qualitative in vitro
diagnostic test designed for the detection and differentiation of the bla , bla , bla ,
KPC NDM VIM
bla , and bla gene sequences associated with carbapenem-non-susceptible pure
OXA-48-like IMP
colonies of Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, when
grown on blood agar or MacConkey agar. The test utilizes automated real-time Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR).
The GenePOC Carba assay should be used in conjunction with other laboratory tests including
phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing. A negative GenePOC Carba assay result does not
preclude the presence of other resistance mechanisms.
The GenePOC Carba assay is intended as an aid for infection control in the detection of
carbapenem-non-susceptible bacteria that colonize patients in healthcare settings. The
identification of a bla , bla or bla metallo-beta-lactamase gene (i.e., the genes that
IMP NDM VIM
encode the IMP, NDM and VIM metallo-beta-lactamases, respectively) may be used as an aid to
clinicians in determining appropriate therapeutic strategies for patients with known or suspected
carbapenem non-susceptible infections.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Same as Intended Use
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Organisms should be identified and carbapenem non-susceptibility status should be determined
prior to testing with the GenePOC Carba assay.
The performance of the GenePOC Carba assay with bacteria other than Enterobacteriaceae,
Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has not been evaluated.
In silico predictions of the inclusivity of the GenePOC Carba primers and probes were performed
using sequence data available in GenBank in 2018. Analysis of new variant sequences of the
targeted carbapenemase genes deposited in GenBank after 2018 has not been performed.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The GenePOC Carba assay is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic real-time PCR-based test for the
detection and differentiation of five β-lactamase genes (bla , bla , bla , bla and
KPC NDM VIM OXA-48-like
bla ) that are associated with non-susceptibility of Gram negative bacteria to carbapenem
IMP
antimicrobial agents. The assay is intended for use on isolated, pure colonies of Enterobacteriaceae,
Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa grown on solid culture media as an aid in
detection of carbapenem non-susceptible organisms for the purposes of infection control and to aid
in determining appropriate therapeutic strategies for patients with known or suspected infection with
such organisms.
The GenePOC Carba assay kit comprises 24 individual pouches, each of which contains a single-
use, disposable microfluidic cartridge (PIE), Sample Buffer Tube (SBT) and a Disposable
Transfer Tool (DTT). Each PIE contains a slurry of glass beads for sample homogenization and
bacterial lysis, a Process Control (PrC), a buffer for dilution of the lysate and primers and probes
for detection of each of the targeted carbapenemase genes. The PrC is used to verify the sample
processing and amplification steps, including the detection of potential assay inhibitors,
microfluidic movement of liquid and reagent integrity.
Each PIE is an integrated closed device in which a sample is dispensed and processed through
different microfluidic chambers and channels for nucleic acid extraction and subsequent real-
time PCR amplification/detection. User intervention is required to prepare a standardized 0.5
McFarland bacterial suspension from previously identified, carbapenem non-susceptible
colonies, add 15µL of this suspension to the SBT and subsequently transfer an aliquot from the
SBT to the PIE, and load the PIE into the revogene carousel. Sample preparation and real-time
PCR are completed in approximately 70 minutes. Upon completion of a run, the results for each
target gene are interpreted automatically by the revogene instrument and reported as Positive,
Negative, Indeterminate (instrument error) or Unresolved (PrC failure).
B Principle of Operation:
The GenePOC Carba assay is for the qualitative detection and differentiation of the bla ,
KPC
bla , bla , bla and bla genes in isolated colonies of carbapenem non-susceptible
NDM VIM OXA-48-like IMP
Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa grown on sheep blood
or MacConkey agar. The assay is performed on the revogene instrument (K170558) in single-use,
disposable microfluidic cartridges (PIEs) that automate sample processing, microfluidic movement
of liquid and real-time PCR amplification/detection. No operator intervention is necessary once the
sample is loaded onto the revogene instrument.
To perform the test, a previously identified carbapenem non-susceptible bacterial strain is
streaked on blood or MacConkey agar to obtain isolated colonies. A 10µg meropenem disc is
placed in the first quadrant of the plate to monitor retention of non-susceptibility to carbapenems.
After incubation for 18-24 hours at 35±2°C, isolated colonies are sampled and used to prepare a
0.5 McFarland suspension in saline. Fifteen microliters of the standardized suspension are then
K190275 - Page 3 of 29

--- Page 4 ---
added to a Sample Buffer Tube (SBT) and, after mixing, a Disposable Transfer Tool (DTT)
provided in the assay kit is used to transfer an aliquot of the diluted suspension to a GenePOC
Carba PIE which is then sealed and loaded into the revogene instrument.
The revogene can process between one and eight samples (PIEs) in a single run. Each PIE is an
integrated, self-contained device that performs sample homogenization/bacterial lysis using glass
beads, sample dilution and PCR amplification/detection. Fluid movement within each PIE is
controlled by centrifugation through microfluidic channels. An internal Process Control (PrC) is
included in the homogenization chamber to monitor reagent and process integrity.
The results are interpreted automatically by the system from measured fluorescent signals and may
be viewed, printed, transferred, and/or stored by the user.

1. Instrument Name:
GenePOC revogene instrument
2. Specimen Identification:
The revogene instrument has two barcode readers to identify reagents and patient specimens.
The Sample Buffer Tube (SBT) and microfluidic cartridge (PIE) are each pre-labeled with a
unique barcode at the time of manufacture to identify both the specimen and assay type,
providing traceability of each sample to the PIE, SBT and assay identifiers.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
User intervention is required to prepare a standardized bacterial suspension from isolated
colonies of a previously identified, carbapenem non-susceptible bacterial isolate, transfer an
aliquot of the suspension to the Sample Buffer Tube (SBT) and from there to the microfluidic
cartridge (PIE). All further processing is automated once the PIE is loaded into the revogene
instrument and the run is initiated. Results are interpreted automatically by the system.

4. Calibration:
The revogene instrument is factory calibrated at the time of manufacture. Calibration is
verified annually by a trained technician.
5. Quality Control:
Each microfluidic cartridge (PIE) contains a Process Control (PrC) in the homogenization
chamber that is designed to monitor process and reagent integrity. The PrC is mixed with the
patient sample and undergoes simultaneous lysis, PCR amplification/detection.
Commercially available strains of bacteria may be used as External Controls for the

On initial testing, 34/2400 (1.4%) samples produced Indeterminate results and a further eight (8)
(8/2400 = 0.3%) were reported as Unresolved. In each case, upon retesting of these samples,
valid results were obtained. Eleven false positive results (11/2400 = 0.5%) were observed over
the course of the study (bla :8; bla :3) (Table 4). The GenePOC Carba assay exhibited

acceptable reproducibility and precision within and between sites/instruments/reagent lots and
days of testing.

Analytical Specificity
The analytical specificity of the GenePOC Carba assay was evaluated by testing a panel of
50 carbapenem susceptible and non-susceptible isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, A. baumannii
and P. aeruginosa. The carbapenem susceptibility phenotype of each isolate (susceptible,
intermediate or resistant) was determined by disc diffusion and antimicrobial resistance gene
content was characterize by whole Genome Sequencing and/or targeted PCR (Table 6). Most
of the isolates carried β-lactamase gene(s) that do not confer non-susceptibility to
carbapenems. Those that were non-susceptible (i.e., intermediate or resistant) to carbapenems
either harbored carbapenemase markers that are not targeted by the GenPOC Carba assay or
non-susceptibility was conferred by a non-carbapenemase-mediated mechanism. Each isolate
was tested with the GenePOC Carba assay in triplicate using a starting suspension equivalent
to ~4 McFarland (i.e., ~5-10 times higher concentration than the standard workflow for the
GenePOC Carba assay which uses a starting suspension density of 0.5 McFarland). No false

In Silico Analysis
In addition to laboratory testing, the specificity of the GenePOC Carba assay primers and
probes was evaluated in silico by using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) to
interrogate the GenBank nucleotide collection (nr/nt) database. All possible primer
combinations within each PCR master mix (bla /bla /PrC for Master Mix 1 and
KPC NDM
bla /bla /bla for Master Mix 2) were evaluated for the potential to amplify non-
IMP OXA-48-like VIM
specific products. The only potential amplification products identified were those for the
targeted carbapenemase resistance genes. These results are acceptable.
Interfering Substances Study
The potential for the culture medium used for growth of bacterial colonies to interfere with
the GenePOC Carba assay was evaluated by testing isolated colonies grown on blood and
MacConkey agar plates from three different manufacturers. Testing was performed with
representative strains of bacteria that harbored each of the carbapenemase resistance markers
targeted by the GenePOC Carba assay, as well as a negative control strain. Each isolate was
grown on each culture medium and suspended to a standardized concentration of 0.5
McFarland using saline from two different suppliers, resulting in a total of 12 test conditions
for each organism. Three replicates of each strain were tested under each condition ((3 types
of blood agar + 3 types of MacConkey agar) x 2 preparations of saline x 6 strains x 3
replicates = 216 samples). The expected results were obtained for 214/216 (99.1%) samples.
The two (2) discordant results occurred with a strain of K. pneumoniae that was reported, as
expected, as positive for bla but which also produced positive results for bla (1
NDM IMP
replicate) and bla (1 replicate) under different test conditions. Retesting of freshly
VIM
prepared bacterial suspensions with the same combinations of culture media and saline
produced the expected results (three (3) replicates per condition). The results of the
Interfering Substances Study were determined to be acceptable.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Process Control
Each GenePOC Carba PIE includes an integrated Process Control (PrC) that is designed to
monitor sample homogenization, dilution, amplification and detection. The PrC is amplified
and detected using a specific pair of PCR primers and a detector probe that are located in one
of the two amplification chambers of the GenePOC Carba PIE.
External Controls
External Positive and Negative Controls should be tested in accordance with good laboratory
practices and applicable regulations and the requirements accrediting agencies. The
manufacturer does not provide External Controls for use with the GenePOC Carba assay but
recommends use of standardized 0.5 McFarland suspensions of the strains listed in Table 7
K190275 - Page 15 of 29

--- Page 16 ---
as Positive Controls. For a Negative Control, a carbapenem non-susceptible isolate that does
not carry any of the resistance genes targeted by the GenePOC carba assay is recommended.

1 1/36 replicates produced an Indeterminate result on initial testing but gave the expected result upon repeat
from the same Sample Buffer Tube
Use of the strains shown in Table 7 was validated by testing 36 replicates of each with three
lots of GenePOC Carba reagents (12 replicates/lot). All controls produced the expected
results.
External Positive and Negative Controls were also tested on each day of the Method
Comparison Study described in Section VII B(1). The strain used for the Positive Control
was selected daily on a rotating basis so that a control for each gene target was tested at least
twice at each study site. A total of 52 pairs of Positive and Negative External Controls was
evaluated over the course of the study. Of these, 49 pairs (94.2%) produced the expected
results for each of the targeted carbapenemase genes on initial testing and in each case, the
controls that failed produced the expected results upon repeat.
Sample Stability
Studies were performed to evaluate the stability of bacterial suspensions in the Sample
Buffer Tube (SBT) and of the GenePOC Carba PIE after removal from the dessicant pouch
and addition of sample. Bacterial suspensions in the SBT were shown to be stable for 4 days
at 25°C and 7 days at 2-8°C. GenePOC Carba PIEs were found to be stable for up to 1 hour
at 25°C after addition of sample.
Reagent Stability
The shelf-life of the GenePOC Carba assay reagents will be established through a Real-time
Stability Study conducted at 2-8°C and 25±3°C/60% relative humidity.
6. Detection Limit:
Analytical Sensitivity
The analytical sensitivity of the GenePOC Carba assay was not evaluated because bacterial
suspensions for testing must be standardized to a density of 0.5 McFarland, which is
substantially above the limit of detection (LoD) for assays based on nucleic acid
amplification.

Inclusivity
The analytical reactivity (inclusivity) of the GenePOC Carba assay was evaluated using a
panel of 58 carbapenem non-susceptible isolates that included multiple variants of each
targeted gene marker. The non-susceptibility of each isolate was confirmed by disc diffusion
with doripenem, ertapenem, imipenem and meropenem according to standard methods
(CLSI, M02-13 and M100-S28). Genotypic characterization of carbapenemase resistance
genes was performed by Whole Genome Sequencing. Each isolate was tested with the
GenePOC Carba assay in triplicate. Samples that produced indeterminate or unexpected (i.e.,
false positive or false negative) results were retested. All the final results obtained with each
of the 58 strains were as expected. A listing of isolates and gene variants used in the
GenePOC Carba Inclusivity Study is shown Tables 8 and 9. The inclusivity of the GenePOC
Carba assay for detection of carbapenemase resistance markers in Enterobacteriaceae, A.
baumannii and P. aeruginosa was determined to be acceptable.

In Silico Analysis
In addition to laboratory testing, the inclusivity of the GenePOC Carba assay was
demonstrated through in silico analysis of the targeted carbapenemase genes using the Basic
Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Predictions of the likelihood of detecting different gene
variants were made based on the sequence data available in GenBank in November, 2018. A
summary of the results is presented in Table 10. The analysis showed that the GenePOC Carba
assay was likely to detect most of the known clinically relevant subtypes of the targeted
carbapenemase genes. A Limitation in the device labeling indicates that analysis of new variant
sequences deposited in GenBank after 2018 has not been performed.

the associated cycle threshold (Ct) values.
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
Not applicable.
9. Carry-Over:
Studies were performed to evaluate the likelihood of obtaining false positive results with the
GenePOC Carba assay due to carry-over (run-to-run) or cross- (sample-to-sample)
contamination. The potential for carry-over contamination was evaluated by performing 10
alternating runs of all positive and all negative samples. Similarly, the potential for cross-
contamination was evaluated by testing alternating positive and negative samples within a
revogene instrument carousel over a total of 10 runs. In each case, a single revogene
instrument was used for all 10 runs. The positive samples comprised an isolate of bla -
KPC
positive K. pneumoniae at a starting concentration of ~4 McFarland (i.e., ~5-10 times higher
concentration than the prescribed workflow for the GenePOC Carba assay which uses a
starting suspension density of 0.5 McFarland). The negative samples comprised a
carbapenem non-susceptible isolate that did not possess any of the targeted carbapenemase
genes. A summary of the results is presented in Table 11. Across the two studies, a total of
three (3) false positive results was observed, none of which were for bla . The false
KPC
positive results for bla (2) and bla (1) were attributed to contamination in the
IMP VIM
laboratory environment.
The device labeling contains instructions regarding the preparation and testing of External
Negative controls to monitor performance and reduce the potential for reporting of erroneous
results due to laboratory contamination. Additional precautions for handling previously used
PIEs and for decontaminating the revogene instrument are also provided. This is acceptable.

The performance of the GenePOC Carba assay was evaluated in a study that was conducted
at three sites (two in the U.S. and one ex-U.S.) with a mixture of prospectively collected and
stock isolates of carbapenemase producing organisms. Prior to inclusion in the study, each
isolate was confirmed by MALDI-TOF analysis to be either Acinetobacter baumannii,

Pseudomonas aeruginosa or a species that is a member of the Enterobacteriaceae, and to be
non-susceptible to one or more carbapenems as determined by disc diffusion according to
standard procedures (CLSI, M02-13 and M100-S28). The results obtained with the GenePOC
Carba assay were compared to those produced by another FDA-cleared device for the
detection of the targeted carbapenemase resistance markers from isolated colonies, used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Testing with the GenePOC assay was
performed with organisms grown on both blood and MacConkey agar. The comparator
method was performed independently using organisms grown on blood agar.
Note: The performance of the FDA-cleared device used as the comparator for the GenePOC
Carba assay was previously evaluated in comparison to PCR/bidirectional sequencing and
exhibited 100% sensitivity and close to 100% specificity for detection of the targeted
carbapenemase resistance markers from isolated colonies of carbapenem non-susceptible
bacteria. Because the isolates included in the study were identified to the species level and
their carbapenem non-susceptible status was determined by reference methods, use of this
device as a reference comparator method to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the
GenePOC Carba assay was determined to be acceptable.
Five hundred and thirty-two (532) bacterial isolates (475 stock and 57 prospective) were
initially enrolled in the study. Of these, 16 were excluded from the analysis of performance
for the following reasons: eleven (11) did not meet the inclusion criteria for species
identification (either they were not among the targeted organisms or organism identification
was inconclusive), three (3) were unavailable for analysis due to laboratory error and two (2)
were found to be susceptible to all four carbapenems tested. Four (4) additional isolates were
also excluded because they were associated with a Negative External Control failure on
initial testing and produced Indeterminate results upon repeat. The performance of the
GenePOC Carba assay was therefore evaluated using a total of 512 carbapenem non-
susceptible isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (306), Acinetobacter baumannii (99) and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (107) (Tables 12 and 13). Performance stratified by each organism
group is shown in Tables 14 and 15 for colonies grown on blood and MacConkey agar,
respectively.

2. Matrix Comparison:
Fresh vs Frozen Study
A study was performed to evaluate the effect on GenePOC Carba assay performance of
freezing standardized suspensions of bacteria prior to testing. Representative carbapenemase
non-susceptible isolates were grown under selective conditions and isolated colonies were
used to prepare 0.5 McFarland suspensions that were tested “fresh” after storage at 2-8°C or
after freezing at -20°C for ≥24 hours. All results were as expected. The results from this
study supported use of frozen panel members in the Reproducibility and Precision Study
described in Section VII A1.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The performance of the GenePOC Carba assay was evaluated using a collection of prospectively
collected and archived isolates of carbapenem non-susceptible bacteria. Five hundred and twelve
(512) isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa were included in the
study, of which 427 were found to be positive for one or more carbapenemase resistance genes
using an FDA-cleared reference molecular assay. In comparison, the GenePOC Carba assay gave
a positive result for one or more carbapenemase genes with 449 isolates. A summary of the
carbapenemase resistance genes identified by the reference method and by the GenePOC Carba
assay is shown in Table 18.
