laboratory automation system.
B Measurand:
Vitamin B12, Ferritin, Folate, and Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)
C Type of Test:
Quantitative Chemiluminescent Immunoassays
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The DxA 5000 is a high-speed, modular, automated sample handling system that performs pre-
analytical and post-analytical sample processing and storage. The automation system also sorts,
routes, and presents sample tubes to analyzers for analysis. The DxA 5000 also consolidates a
variety of analytical instruments, such as an Immunoassay analyzer, into a unified workstation

and treatment of megaloblastic anemia.
The Access Access TSH (3rd IS) assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent assay for
the quantitative determination of human thyroidstimulating hormone (thyrotropin, TSH, hTSH)
levels in human serum using the Access Immunoassay Systems. Measurements of thyroid
stimulating hormone produced by the anterior pituitary are used in the diagnosis of thyroid or
pituitary disorders.

For a table of device characteristics, see “Comparison of Technology to Predicate Devices”
below.
B Principle of Operation:
The Access TSH (3rd IS) assay is a two-site immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay. A sample is
added to a reaction vessel with mouse anti-hTSH-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, buffered
protein solution and paramagnetic particles coated with immobilized mouse monoclonal anti-
hTSH antibody. The hTSH binds to the immobilized monoclonal anti-hTSH antibody on the
solid phase while the mouse anti-hTSH-alkaline phosphatase conjugate reacts with a different
antigenic site on the hTSH. After incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid
phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the
chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phos 530 is added to the vessel and light generated by the
reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the
concentration of TSH in the sample. The amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a
stored, multi-point calibration curve.
The Access Folate assay is a competitive binding receptor assay. For the assay of folate in serum
or plasma (heparin), no pre-treatment is required. For the assay of folate in red blood cells, a
whole blood sample is first treated off-line with a lysing agent composed of ascorbic acid. This
pre-treatment hemolyzes the red blood cells and converts the folate polyglutamic acid forms
present in red cells to the monoglutamic acid form predominant in serum. The sample from the
pre-treatment of whole blood is defined as a hemolysate.
A serum, plasma (heparin), or hemolysate sample is treated to release folate from endogenous
binding proteins. Folate binding protein, mouse anti-folate binding protein, folic acid-alkaline
phosphatase conjugate, and goat anti-mouse capture antibody coupled to paramagnetic particles
are added to the reaction vessel. Folate in the sample competes with the folic acid-alkaline
phosphatase conjugate for binding sites on a limited amount of folate binding protein. Resulting
complexes bind to the solid phase via mouse anti-folate binding protein. After incubation in a
reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound
materials are washed away'. Then, a chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phos 530 is added to the
vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production
is inversely proportional to the concentration of folate in the sample. The amount of analyte in
the sample is determined from a stored, multi-point calibration curve.
K190298 - Page 4 of 11

The Access Ferritin assay is a two-site immunoenzymatic ("sandwich") assay. A sample is added
to a reaction vessel with goat anti-ferritin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, and paramagnetic
particles coated with goat anti-mouse: mouse anti-ferritin complexes. Serum or plasma (heparin)
ferritin binds to the immobilized monoclonal anti-ferritin on the solid phase, while the goat anti-
ferritin enzyme conjugate reacts with different antigenic sites on the ferritin molecules. After
incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field
while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phos
530 is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer.
The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of ferritin in the sample. The
amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a stored, multi-point calibration curve.
The Access Vitamin B12 assay is a competitive-binding immunoenzymatic assay. A sample is
added to a reaction vessel along with alkaline potassium cyanide and dithiothreitol. This
treatment denatures B12 binding proteins and converts all forms of vitamin B12 to the
cyanocobalamin form. After neutralization, intrinsic factor-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and
paramagnetic particles coated with goat anti-mouse IgG: mouse monoclonal anti-intrinsic factor
are added to the sample. Vitamin B12 in the sample binds to the intrinsic factor conjugate,
preventing the conjugate from binding to the solid phase anti-intrinsic factor. Separation in a
magnetic field and washing removes materials not bound to the solid phase. A chemiluminescent
substrate, Lumi-Phos 530, is added to the reaction vessel and light generated by the reaction is
measured with a luminometer. The light production is inversely proportional to the concentration
of vitamin B12i n the sample. The amount of analyte in the sample is determined by means of a
stored, mufti-point calibration curve.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
For comparing the pre-analytical processing of the DxA 5000 to the Power Processor, native
samples were evaluated using both the DxA 5000 and the Power processor in conjunction
with four representative assays (Ferritin, Folate, TSH, and Vitamin B12).
The paired data sets were obtained by collecting blood into two sample tubes per patient. One
sample tube was processed pre-analytically by the Power Processor being analyzed by the
DxI800 Access Immunoanalyzer connected to the Power Processor. The other sample tube
was processed pre-analytically by the DxA 5000 being analyzed by the DxI 800 Access
Immunoanalyzer connected to the DxA 5000. This study and results are shown in the table
