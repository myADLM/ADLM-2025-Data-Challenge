• To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of
circulating influenza viruses.
Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a
season when seasonal influenza viruses A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) were the
predominant influenza A viruses in circulation and during a season when
the A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus was the predominant influenza A
virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other
emerging influenza A viruses.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used
as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely,
positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other
viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical
and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for
novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for
testing. Viral culture should not be attempted unless a BSL 3E facility is available
to receive and culture specimens.
All users, analysts, and any person reporting results from use of this
device should be trained to perform and interpret the results from this
procedure by a competent instructor prior to use. CDC Influenza

A viruses in circulation and during a season when the A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza
virus was the predominant influenza A virus in circulation. Performance
characteristics may vary with other emerging influenza A viruses.
Testing with the influenza H5a and H5b primer and probe sets should not be performed
unless the patient meets the most current U.S.Department of Health and Human Services
(DHHS) clinical and epidemiologic criteria for testing suspect A(H5) specimens. The
definitive identification of influenza A(H5) (Asian lineage) either directly from patient
specimens or from virus cultures requires additional laboratory testing, along with
clinical and epidemiological assessment in consultation with national influenza
surveillance experts.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used
as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely,
positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other

I. Device Description:
The CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is used in real-time
RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on an in vitro diagnostic real-time PCR instrument that has
been FDA-cleared for use with this device. The panel is configured in four separate
kits. Each kit consists of oligonucleotide primers, fluorescently labeled hydrolysis
probes, and controls which are used in rRT-PCR assays for the in vitro qualitative
detection and characterization of influenza virus RNA in respiratory specimens from
patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI). Oligonucleotide primers and
probes for detection of influenza A, influenza B, and 2009 influenza A (swine origin)
were selected from highly conserved regions of the matrix (M), non-structural (NS),
and nucleoprotein (NP) genes, respectively. Oligonucleotide primers and probes for
characterization and differentiation of influenza A(H3) and A(H1)pdm09 viruses and
genetic lineages of influenza B were selected from highly conserved regions of their
HA genes. Oligonucleotide primers and probes to detect the human RNase P gene
(RP) in control samples and clinical specimens are also included in the panel.

L. Test Principle:
The CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel includes sets of
oligonucleotide primers and dual-labeled hydrolysis probes to be used in real-time RT-PCR
assays on in vitro diagnostic real-time PCR instrument that has been FDA-cleared for use with
this device. The targeted regions of influenza viral RNA are transcribed into complimentary
DNA (cDNA) and amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The fluorescently

monitored by the real-time PCR instrument during each PCR cycle. Amplification of target
is recorded as increase of fluorescence over time in comparison to background signal.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Studies were conducted to assess the reproducibility of the Applied Biosystems
QuantStudio Dx (QSDS) and the QIAGEN Rotor-Gene Q MDx (QMDX) with the
CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel.
A blinded panel of contrived influenza A and influenza B samples containing a
background of beta-propiolactone (BPL) treated A549 cells in viral transport
medium (VTM) was assembled by adding a BPL treated influenza A(H3N2)
virus, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, or an influenza B/Victoria virus,
B/Nevada/03/2011, respectively. The samples included a moderate positive
sample, a low positive sample near the established assay LoD, and a negative
sample consisting of background A549 cells and VTM.
Three separate testing sites were selected for each real-time PCR instrument
platform. The contrived sample panel was tested five times by each of the two
analysts at each site over five days. Analysts extracted nucleic acid from the
contrived samples using a nucleic acid extraction method that has been FDA-
cleared for use with this device and performed rRT-PCR with the InfA, H3,
pdmInfA, pdmH1, InfB, YAM, VIC and RP assays from the CDC Human
Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel using Invitrogen SuperScript
enzyme.
The results for the reproducibility studies of each real-time PCR instrument
platform are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2 below.

d. Detection limit:
The LoD performance equivalency between the FDA-cleared CDC Human Influenza
Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx
and either the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio Dx (QSDx) or QIAGEN Rotor-Gene
Q MDx (QMDx) instrumentwas was evaluated by testing 5-fold serial dilutions of the
following five characterized influenza viruses of known egginfectious dose 50% titer:
Influenza A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (A/H3N2), Influenza A/Michigan/45/2015
(A/H1N1pdm09), Influenza B/Montana/05/2012 (B/Victoria), Influenza
B/Massachusetts/02/2012 (B/Yamagata), and Influenza
A/gyrfalcon/Washington/41088-6/2014 PR8-IDCDC-RG43A (A/H5N8).
Virus dilutions were prepared using a suspension of beta-propiolactone (BPL) treated
A549 cells in viral transport medium (VTM) as diluent. Triplicate samples of each
dilution were extracted separately with the Roche MagNA Pure Compact RNA
Isolation Kit. Each assay of the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR
Diagnostic Panel was performed using both theInvitrogen SuperScript III Platinum
One-Step RT-PCR System (SuperScript) and the QuantaqScript (qScript) enzyme
system. The acceptance criterion for LoD equivalence between the FDA-cleared
Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx and the investigational Applied Biosystems QSDx
or QIAGEN QMDx instrument was pre-defined as a demonstration of 100%
positivity (3 out of 3 replicates) at either the same endpoint concentration or within
one 5-fold dilution. The results of the study are summarized by the virus strain tested
in Tables 3 to 12 below. The lowest concentration at which each assay showed 100%
positivity is highlighted green.
Each investigational real-time instrument met the acceptance criterion when
compared to the FDA-cleared real-time PCR instrument.

f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable, aspects of the tests other than real-time PCR instrument platform and
nucleic acid extraction options are not modified from the previously FDA-cleared
versions.
g. Carryover and Cross-contamination:
The potential for carryover and cross-contamination when testing samples of high
viral RNA concentration using either the QIAGEN QMDx or Applied Biosystems
QSDx instruments with the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic
Panel was examined. An alternating pattern of high positive and negative contrived
samples was analyzed using the InfA, H5a, H5b, and RP assays from the CDC
Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. Contrived samples were
prepared using characterized stocks of BPL-inactivated influenza A/gyrfalcon/41088-
6/2014 PR8-IDCDC-RG43A (H5N8) in a suspension of A549 cells. A total of five
individual runs were performed on each instrument. The percent agreements with the
expected result were calculated to determine any carryover and cross-contamination
effect. No carryover or cross–contamination effect was observed with either real-time
PCR instrument during this study.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Refer to the “Clinical studies” section
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable
3. Clinical studies:
Performance testing clinical specimens using the Applied Biosystems QSDx and the
QIAGEN Rotor-Gene Q MDx instrument platforms with the CDC Human Influenza
Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel test kits was evaluated to demonstrate
equivalency with the FDA-cleared Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx. The study was
performed using retrospective natural clinical specimens collected during the 2013-2014
influenza seasons. The lack of available natural clinical specimens containing influenza
A(H5) viruses was addressed using ten contrived samples prepared with BPL-inactivated
influenza A(H5) virus in a suspension of human A549 cells and virus transport medium.
A total of 50 natural clinical specimens and contrived samples that were previously
determined to be positive using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx (the comparator)
for influenza A/H1pdm09 (10 specimens), A/H3 (10 specimens), A/H5 (10 specimens),
B/Victoria (10 specimens), or B/Yamagata (10 specimens) and 50 influenza negative
natural clinical specimens were evaluated using the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time

Diagnostic Panel. Samples were extracted using the Roche MagNA Pure Compact and
RNA Isolation Kit. Testing was performed using Invitrogen SuperScript enzyme
mastermix and utilizing either the Applied Biosystems QSDx or QIAGEN QMDx. The
results are summarized in the Table 13 and Table 14 below.
