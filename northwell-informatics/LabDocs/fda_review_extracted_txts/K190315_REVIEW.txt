L. Test Principle:
The allergen of interest, covalently coupled to ImmunoCAP solid phase, reacts with the
specific IgE in the patient sample. After washing away nonspecific IgE, enzyme-labeled
antibodies against IgE are added to form a complex. After incubation, unbound enzyme-
anti-IgE is washed away and the bound complex is then incubated with a developing agent.
After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence of the eluate is measured. The higher the
response value, the more specific IgE is present in the specimen. The fluorescence results
are converted to ‘kU /L’ concentrations by the software with the use of a calibration curve.

M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
All results presented below met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i) Within-laboratory imprecision:
Imprecision of each ImmunoCAP Allergen Component was evaluated by testing five
positive plasma samples with concentrations of antigen-specific IgEs spanning the
analytical measuring range (AMR). Each sample was tested in four replicates in one
assay run per day for a total of 20 operating days (a total of 80 replicates per sample).
The assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Directions for Use
using a Phadia 250. Between-run and within-run coefficients of variance (%CV) were
calculated for each sample separately. Results are shown in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of each ImmunoCAP Allergen Component was assessed following CLSI
guideline I/LA-20 3rd Edition. Three positive samples were each diluted in sample
diluent generating at least six 2-fold consecutive dilutions. Undiluted samples were
tested in 12 replicates and diluted samples were tested in four replicates in one assay
run. The assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions
for Use using the Phadia 250 instrument using one lot of each ImmunoCAP Allergen
Component.
Results of the replicates from all three samples were analyzed for linearity. Regression

Stability studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP25-A using three
lots of each ImmunoCAP Allergen component The accelerated stability data
support the 24 month unopened shelf-life stability. The real-time stability study is
ongoing and supports six month unopened shelf-life stability.
The studies to determine the stability of the calibration curve, real-time, and on-
board stability of ImmunoCAP IgE calibrator are described in K100999.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined on the
Phadia 250 in alignment with CLSI guideline EP17-A2 using two lots of each
ImmunoCAP Allergen Component. The LoB was based on determinations of five
blank samples in three runs with five replicates per run and was estimated as the 95%
percentile of the distribution.
LoD was calculated according to the equation: LoD = LoB + cß • SD where SD ,
LoD LoD
is the pooled SD for each of five low positive samples measured in 15 replicates.
Results from maximum LoD of the two lots were used in the calculation of LoQ. The
precision profile provided supports the LoQ claim of 0.1 kU L at ≤20% CV.

Equal volumes of the positive sample and varying serial dilutions of the three
specific allergen components were premixed. The mixture was incubated in a
sample tube at room temperature for two hours before being analyzed with each
ImmunoCAP Allergen Component on the Phadia 250 according to the
ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use. The testing was performed in
duplicate in one assay run. Mean values were calculated.
The inhibition test was evaluated with inhibition values in %, calculated
according to the formula below:

Any negative percent inhibition values are shown as 0% inhibition.
The following inhibitors for these three allergen components were tested and
summarized as follows:
ImmunoCAP Allergen
Unrelated inhibitors
Component
rMal d 3, rOle e 9,
e229, rCan f 4 (Dog)
rPla 1 1 and rCan f 5
rCor a 14, rPla 1 1,
e230, rCan f 6 (Dog)
rVes v 5 and rCan f 5
rCor a 14, rPla 1 1,
e231, rFel d 7 (Cat)
rVes v 5 and rFel d 2
The e229, rCan f 4 (Dog) inhibition study showed that >50% inhibition was
achieved with the related inhibitor (rCan f 4) at a final inhibitor concentration of
45 µg/mL. The inhibition studies using four unrelated inhibitors, including three
unrelated inhibitors(rMal d 3, rOle e 9, rPla 1 1) and one from the related/same
group (rCan f 5) did not show any significant inhibition. The inhibition studies
indicate that the ImmunoCAP Allergen e220, rCan f 4 (Dog) solid phase contains
the immunologically relevant allergen.
The e230, rCan f 6 (Dog) inhibition study showed that >50% inhibition was
achieved with the related inhibitor (rCan f 6) at a final inhibitor concentration of
123 µg/mL. The inhibition studies using four unrelated inhibitors, including three
from unrelated groups (rCor a 14, rPla 1 1, rVes v 5 and one from the
related/same group (rCan f 5) did not show any significant inhibition. The
inhibition studies indicate that the ImmunoCAP Allergen e230, rCan f 6 (Dog)

solid phase contains the immunologically relevant allergen.
The e231, rFel d 7 (Cat) inhibition study showed that >50% inhibition was
achieved with the related inhibitor (rFel d 7) at a final inhibitor concentration of
27 µg/mL. The inhibition studies using four unrelated inhibitors, including three
from unrelated groups (rCor a 14, rPla 1 1, rVes v 5) and one from the
related/same group (rFel d 2 ) did not show any significant inhibition. The
inhibition studies indicate that the ImmunoCAP Allergen e231, rFel d 7 (Cat)
solid phase contains the immunologically relevant allergen.
ii) Interference:
a) Endogenous Substance Interference:
Interference from icteric, hemolytic or lipemic samples was tested.
Interferents were spiked into two positive plasma samples and one negative
plasma sample for each of the three new recombinant allergens and analyzed
in four replicates in one assay run using the Phadia 250. The results
demonstrate that icteric, hemolytic or lipemic samples do not adversely affect
the results in ImmunoCAP Specific IgE. The results are summarized in the
table below:
Interferant No inhibition up to concentration tested
Bilirubin C 21.0 mg/dL
Bilirubin F 18.7 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 500 mg/dL
Chyle 1,760 FTU-Formazine Turbidity Units
b) Exogenous Substance Interference:
Two literature references were provided supporting that commonly prescribed
allergy medications do not interfere with ImmunoCAP Specific IgE. The
references included (i) Robert G. Hamilton, Accuracy of US Food and Drug
Administration-cleared IgE antibody assays in the presence of anti-IgE
(omalizumab), J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2006; 759-766, and (ii) Linda Cox
et. al., Pearls and pitfalls of allergy diagnostic testing: report from the
American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology/American Academy
of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Specific IgE Test Task Force, Annals of
Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, 2008; 101:580-592.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Refer to Clinical studies.
b. Matrix comparison:
Refer to K101251.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical sensitivity and specificity:
The performance of each ImmunoCAP Allergen Component:rCan f 4, Dog (e229);
rCan f 6, Dog (e230); and rFel d 7 (e231) was compared to a clinical diagnosis of
allergy. The objectives of this study were: (i) to show the linkage between specific
IgE antibodies to ImmunoCAP Allergen Component and the corresponding extract
based ImmunoCAP Allergen, using clinical samples, and (ii) to demonstrate that
samples from healthy, non-atopic donors with no reported clinical reaction to the
allergen have undetectable or very low levels of specific IgE to the individual
ImmunoCAP Allergen Components. A total of 30 to 37 clinical samples from
individuals with a clinical history of allergy-like symptoms upon exposure to the
allergens, as diagnosed by a physician, were tested in the study. Information about
clinical symptoms and manifestations was available for all clinical samples. Non-
atopic samples (<0.35 kU /L) from 100 healthy non-atopic donors were also tested.

Clinical sensitivity and specificity in this sample cohort are summarized in the
following tables:

b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected value is negative (< 0.35 kU /L) for a specific allergen in a non-atopic
A
person. The manufacturer recommends a cut-off at 0.35 kU /L. Each laboratory should
A
establish its own expected range of values.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable.
