III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
The GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit is intended for the quantitative determination of total
galactose (galactose and galactose-1-phosphate) concentrations in blood specimens dried on
filter paper as an aid in screening newborns for galactosemia using the GSP® instrument.
B Indication(s) for Use:
See intended use above.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For In-Vitro Diagnostic Use Only
Screening specimens that result in values at or above cut-off should be considered as
presumptive positives for galactosemia, retested and/or confirmed by a diagnostic test procedure.
Blood samples that have been obtained from infants before 24 hours or who have not ingested
sufficient breast milk or formula containing lactose may give low values, resulting in a false
negative result.
If a sample collected before 24 hours, or from an infant who has not been on a lactose-containing
diet, is tested and returns a negative result, a follow-up sample collected at or after 24 hours and
after lactose-containing diet should be tested.
The GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit may result in:
- False negatives by not detecting galactosemia in samples collected at <24 hours
- False negatives by not detecting galactosemia in infants who have not had a lactose containing
diet prior to sampling
- False negatives by not detecting Duarte variant galactosemia
D Special Instrument Requirements:
For use on the GSP instrument only.
GSP instrument software version 1.4 rev 6 is required to support the updated GSP Neonatal Total
Galactose assay.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The GSP Neonatal Total Galactose test kit contains the following components:
Calibrators have been prepared from human red blood cells enriched with galactose, and with
ProClin 300 as preservative. The hematocrit value is 50 - 55 % to correspond to a hematocrit of a
K190335 - Page 2 of 13

--- Page 3 ---
newborn. The calibrators have been calibrated against primary calibrators gravimetrically
prepared using a U.S. Pharmacopeia Reference Standard Preparation for galactose.
Controls have been prepared from human blood enriched with galactose and galactose-1-
phosphate, and with ProClin 300 as preservative. Prior to dispensing the blood onto the filter
paper, the hematocrit value of blood used in the controls preparation is adjusted to 50 - 55 % to
correspond to a hematocrit of a newborn. The low control is approximately 4.0 mg/dL and the
high control approximately 12 mg/dL.
All human source materials used in the preparation of kit components were tested and found to
be non-reactive for the presence of HBsAg, anti-HIV 1 and 2, and HCV by FDA approved
methods.
B Principle of Operation:
The Neonatal Total Galactose assay measures total galactose, i.e. both galactose and galactose-1-
phosphate, using a fluorescent galactose oxidase method. The fluorescence is measured using an
excitation wavelength of 505 nm and an emission wavelength of 580 nm. The following

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The GSP Neonatal Galactose kit precision was determined based on the recommendations of
the CLSI guideline EP5-A3.
The precision performance was determined in three separate studies.
• In study 1 was performed over 20 days. Two plates were run each day and each plate
contained two replicates of each sample. Each plate contained a full calibration curve
in duplicate. The repeatability (within-plate variation), and within-laboratory
precision (between-day, between-plate, and within-plate) were determined for the
product. Study 1 also produced information on the between-plate, and between-day
variation.
• Study 2 was run on 5 different days over a 9 day period. Three plates were run each
day, with five replicates per plate, and each plate was analyzed with a different kit lot
by the same operator. Each plate contained a full calibration curve in duplicate.
Between-lot variation of the product was determined.
• Study 3 was run over 5 days. Three plates were run each day, each with a different
GSP instrument by the same operator, with five replicates per plate. Each plate
contained a full calibration curve in duplicate. Between-instrument variation of the
product was determined.
The eight dried blood spot samples used as precision samples (PS1–PS8) were prepared by
spiking normal adult human blood with equimolar amounts (50:50) of galactose-1-phosphate
and galactose.
The hematocrit values of the blood samples used in sample preparation were adjusted to 40-
55 % to correspond to the hematocrit of neonates.

Linearity study samples were prepared to cover approximately a 20–30 % wider range than
the anticipated measuring range. The linearity study sample series with samples at 18
different concentration levels were prepared by proportionally mixing two human whole
blood samples with high and low total galactose concentrations. The low total galactose
concentration sample was normal human whole blood. The high total galactose concentration
sample was prepared by spiking normal human whole blood with equimolar amounts (50:50)
of galactose and galactose-1-phosphate. Expected concentration of the high and low total
galactose samples were based on measured values with the GSP Neonatal Total Galactose
kit. Expected values for dilution samples between these two endpoints were based on the
volumetric ratio and measured value of each of these two components.
The hematocrit values of the blood samples used in sample preparation were adjusted to 50
% to correspond to the hematocrit of neonates. The blood sample series was dispensed on
filter paper and dried overnight at room temperature.
A polynomial evaluation of linearity was used for the data analysis.
The significance of the second and third order polynomials were evaluated by performing a t-
test. The regression analysis results showed that the third order polynomial had statistically
significant non-linear terms (β ). Thus, the third order model was compared with the linear
3
model.
The results showed that the maximum deviation from linearity within the claimed measuring
range between the measured total galactose and the best fit linear model was 6.0% at a
measured value of 35.2 mg/dL.
The measured TGAL concentrations are compared to the expected concentrations. A
weighted regression analysis was performed (measured vs. expected TGAL concentration),
the fitted regression model is:
y = 1.044x + 1.211 (R2 = 0.991)
where y = Measured TGAL concentration (mg/dL)
and x = Expected TGAL concentration (mg/dL).
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The objective of the interference study was to define the effect that common substances in
clinical samples might have on the GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit. The interference study
was performed in accordance with the principles described in the CLSI Guideline EP07-A2.
The study used one kit lot and one GSP instrument.
Three blood pools with different total galactose concentration levels (approximately 5
mg/dL, 10 mg/dL and 15 mg/dL) covering the screening cut-off area were prepared by
spiking normal human whole blood with equimolar amounts (50:50) of galactose and
galactose-1-phosphate. The hematocrit values of the blood pools used in the sample
preparation were adjusted to 40-55%. Samples were prepared as dried blood spots.
K190335 - Page 7 of 13

--- Page 8 ---
The control pools were prepared adding equal volume of solvent (without the interfering
substances) to the base pool as was added to create the test pools. The test pools were
prepared by spiking in the interfering substance at an appropriate concentration into the base
pool. The added spiked substance concentration was in addition to any amount of substance
already present in the sample prior to spiking. For some potential interferents, the total
concentration in the sample is higher than the added concentration. A paired-difference test
was performed for the potential interfering substances. A bias exceeding ±15% is considered
a significant interference by the sponsor. The substances indicated in the table below were
found not to interfere with the proposed device at the added concentration indicated.
Tested substance Added concentration with ≤15%
interference
Acetaminophen 1.38 mg/dL
Ampicillin 152 μmol/L
Ascorbate 6 mg/dL
Bilirubin (conjugated) 8.3 mg/dL
Bilirubin (unconjugated) 20 mg/dL
D-fructose 18 mg/dL
D-glucose 1000 mg/dL
D-mannose 100 mg/dL
Glutathione 3 mmol/L
HSA 30 mg/mL
Hemoglobin 223 g/L
Intralipid 125 mg/dL
NADH 100 μmol/L
The sponsor’s packages insert states:
Acetaminophen and conjugated bilirubin were found to interfere with the assay by
decreasing the measured total galactose concentration. Acetaminophen concentrations
above 1.38 mg/dL and conjugated bilirubin concentrations above 8.3 mg/dL may cause a
false negative screening result for a sample with measured total galactose concentration
close to the cutoff value.
Intralipid (used to mimic high triglycerides concentration interference) was found not to
interfere up to added concentrations of 125 mg/dL (total concentration of 174 mg/dL) at 5
mg/dL total galactose, up to 375 mg/dL (total concentration of 424 mg/dL) at 10 mg/dL
total galactose, and up to 500 mg/dL (total concentration of 549 mg/dL) at 15 mg/dL total
galactose. When present above these amounts of triglycerides may cause a false positive
screening result for a sample with measured total galactose concentration close to the
cutoff value.
In addition, hemoglobin in combination with elevated bilirubin concentration of 15
mg/dL was found to interfere with the assay by increasing the measured total galactose
concentration (see the table below). Therefore, a hemoglobin level at 237 g/L and above
in combination with elevated bilirubin levels may cause a false positive screening result
for a sample with measured total galactose concentrations close to the cut-off value.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The claimed measuring range for the GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit is 1.2 – 50 mg/dL
based on the Limit of Quantitation and Linearity studies.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
As established in k133652.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit and Quantitation (LoQ) for
the test system were determined. The analysis of the LoB, LoD, and LoQ were performed in
accordance with the CLSI guideline EP17-A2.
Limit of the Blank (LoB): The LoB was determined separately for each reagent lot and the
highest result was considered to be the most conservative estimate. The five samples for the
LoB study were dried blood spot specimens prepared from five pools of washed red blood
cells in sodium chloride-sucrose solution and suspended in an artificial serum solution (0.9%
NaCl and 120 g/L sucrose in water). The hematocrit value was adjusted to 40-55% and dried
blood spots were prepared. The samples were assayed in replicates of 6 over 5 working days
using two reagent lots.
The LoB was determined for each lot using the non-parametric classical approach described
in the guideline. The LoB for total galactose is 0.30 mg/dL (17 μmol/L).

Limit of Detection (LoD): The LoD was determined separately for each reagent lot and the
highest result was considered to be the most conservative estimate. The six samples for the
LoD study were dried blood spot specimens prepared from five pools of washed red blood
cells in sodium chloride-sucrose solution and suspended in an artificial serum solution (0.9%
NaCl and 120 g/L sucrose in water). The samples were then spiked with galactose and
galactose-1-phosphate (50:50 molar amounts). The hematocrit value was adjusted to 40-55%
and dried blood spots were prepared. The samples were assayed in replicates of 6 over 5
working days using two reagent lots.
LoD was set at the concentration where the 95th percentile of measurement results exceeds
LoB. The LoD was calculated to be 0.71 mg/dL
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ): The LoQ was determined separately for each reagent lot and the
highest result was considered to be the most conservative estimate. The LoD samples were
also used to determine LoQ.
The LoQ is defined as the lowest concentration with a total CV equal to or less than 20%.
The LoQ for total galactose is 1.22 mg/dL (68 μmol/L).
The sponsor’s claimed measuring range of the device is 1.2 – 50 mg/dL.

tested. The study population was enriched with 7 archived confirmed positive galactosemia
newborn dried blood spot specimens added in a blinded fashion.
The 7 confirmed positive specimens consisted of 6 cases of classic galactosemia and 1 case
of Duarte galactosemia.
All the assayed specimens, i.e. the routine specimens and retrospective confirmed
galactosemia positive specimens, were classified as screen positive or screen negative based
on the measured galactose concentrations. The classification was performed using 99.5%,
99.0% and 95.0% percentile-based cutoffs (see values in the table below).
