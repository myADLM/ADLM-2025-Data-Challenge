C. Type of Test:
The iC-GN Assay utilizes polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the multiplex amplification
of specific targets and detects the amplified targets with microarray hybridization. Targets
are detected directly from patient positive blood cultures confirmed by Gram stain to contain
Gram-negative bacilli. The iC-GN Assay utilizes proprietary ARM-PCR (Amplicon Rescued
Multiplex PCR) technology allowing for multiple targets to be amplified in one reaction.
Testing is done in a self-contained, automated, disposable cassette using the iCubate
processor (iC-Processor). After the reaction is complete, the cassette is read on the iCubate
reader (iC-Reader). Results from the iC-Reader are interpreted by iC-Report software and a
final report is displayed on the iMac computer. Results are qualitative.
II. Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A. Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B. Indication(s) for Use:
The iCubate, Inc. iC-GN Assay for use on the iC-System is a qualitative, multiplexed, in
vitro diagnostic test for the detection and identification of potentially pathogenic Gram-
negative bacteria which may cause bloodstream infection (BSI). The iC-GN Assay is
performed directly on positive blood cultures, confirmed by Gram stain to contain Gram-
negative bacilli. Cultures demonstrating mixed Gram stain results should not be tested on the
assay. The iC-GN Assay is validated for use with select BACTEC, BacT/ALERT and
VersaTREK blood culture bottles. The iC-GN Assay is indicated for use in conjunction with
other clinical and laboratory findings, such as culture, to aid in the diagnosis of bacterial
bloodstream infections; however, it is not used to monitor bloodstream infections.

III. Device/System Characteristics:
A. Device Description:
The iC-GN Assay utilizes polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the multiplex amplification
of specific targets and detects the amplified targets with microarray hybridization. Targets
are detected directly from patient positive blood cultures confirmed by Gram stain to contain
Gram-negative bacilli. The iC-GN Assay utilizes proprietary ARM-PCR (Amplicon Rescued
Multiplex PCR) technology allowing for multiple targets to be amplified in one reaction.
Testing is done in a self-contained, automated, disposable cassette using the iCubate
processor (iC-Processor). After the reaction is complete, the cassette is read on the iCubate
reader (iC-Reader). Results from the iC-Reader are interpreted by iC-Report software and a
final report is displayed on the iMac computer.
To operate, the user opens the iC-Cassette cap and pipettes an aliquot of the diluted positive
blood culture sample into the sample/PCR well in the bottom well plate of the cassette. Once
inoculated, the cassette cap is closed, and all extraction, amplification and detection
processes are completed in the cassette, a closed system. Extraction, amplification and
detection sequences are defined by an assay script controlled by the iC–Processor.
The processing script is defined within a barcode label positioned on the top of each
iC-Cassette which communicates with the iC-Processor. To access and pierce the foil-sealed
reagent wells located in the bottom well plate of the cassette, the processor manipulates the
cassette to move the cassette pipette horizontally and vertically. The script directs the transfer
of reagents between the wells in the bottom well plate and finally to the array within the
cassette. The iC-Processor is capable of processing four (4) iC-Cassettes with random access.
Once processing is complete, the cassette is manually transferred from the iC-Processor to
the iC-Reader where the microarray within the cassette is read. The iC-Reader is capable of
reading up to four (4) iC-Cassettes at one time. The results are interpreted via the iC-Report
software and displayed for the user on the iMac. Raw data and result interpretations are
stored within the iMac; raw data is accessible to iCubate service personnel only and not to
the end user.
When finished with a loaded iC-GN Cassette, it should be disposed as biohazardous waste.

1. Limit of Detection (LoD):
A study was performed to determine the limit of detection for each iC-GN Assay target,
defined as the lowest concentration (CFU/mL) of analyte that can be detected
approximately 95% of the time. For the eleven targets detected by the iC-GN Assay, a
panel of twenty-seven representative strains were evaluated, a minimum of three per
target. For complex and genus level targets, at least two representative species were
evaluated. LoD testing was conducted in two phases: the first phase was to narrow the
range for LoD analysis. In phase II, the approximated 95% performance point determined
in phase I was confirmed by testing a minimum of twenty replicates on each of three
unique cassette lots. Plating and subsequent colony counts were used to determine
organism concentrations. The final limit of detection for each target, is provided below.

2. Bottle Ring:
A study was performed to establish the levels of each iC-GN target organism at two
clinically relevant concentrations: initial bottle positivity (bottle “ring”) and eight hours
beyond initial positivity. Twenty-seven representative organisms were evaluated, a
minimum of three per iC-GN target. Organisms were grown in BD BACTEC Plus
Aerobic blood culture bottles with human blood added and placed on the BD BACTEC
System. Within two hours of initial bottle positivity, the bottles were removed for plating
and subsequent colony counts to determine organism concentrations. The bottles were
then returned to the incubator and approximately eight hours after initial bottle positivity,
the bottles were again removed for plating and subsequent colony counts to determine
organism concentrations. Three bottles were grown for each strain. The average
concentrations at initial bottle positivity and eight hours beyond initial bottle positivity
are provided in below. The concentrations at initial bottle positivity, representative of the
lowest levels that may be observed in a clinical setting, are above the limits of detection
determined for each strain. The results of the study are as expected and establish that the
established LoD is such that the assay has is able to detect clinically relevant levels of
bacteria.

3. Blood Culture Bottle Equivalency:
Commonly used blood culture bottle (BCB) media types were evaluated to demonstrate
that variability in BCB media composition does not interfere with iC-GN Assay
performance. Twenty-seven (27) representative iC-GN target organisms plus one non-
target organism were tested in thirteen (13) BCB media types. Target organisms were
tested near LoD concentrations (2-3×LoD). Each strain was tested in triplicate in each
BCB media type. Target performance is based on all expected targets detected and no
false positive targets detected. Non-target performance is based on all expected negative
results. In the event of a false negative result, the strain was retested in replicates of ten.
In the event of a false positive result or other failure, the strain was retested in triplicate.
The results of iC-GN BCB equivalency testing are summarized in the table below.
Performance in all bottle types met the acceptance criteria of ≥ 95% performance; all
bottle types are validated for use with the iC GN Assay.

4. Inclusivity:
To demonstrate the inclusivity of the iC-GN Assay, eighty-two (82) representative strains
were evaluated, a minimum of ten strains for each target analyte. Strains were tested at
the lowest level of bottle positivity, considered within two hours of bottle “ring.”
Organisms were grown in BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic blood culture bottles with human
blood added on the BD BACTEC System. Each strain was tested in triplicate.
Performance calculations are based on all expected targets detected and no false positive
targets detected. In the event of a false negative result, the strain was retested in replicates
of ten. In the event of a false positive result or other failure, the strain was retested in
triplicate. Two strains were not detected by the iC-GN Assay: Acinetobacter
calcoaceticus ATCC 31926 was not detected as A. baumannii complex and Enterobacter
kobei ATCC BAA-260 was not detected as E. cloacae complex. The results of iC-GN
Inclusivity testing are summarized below. The results of the inclusivity testing support
identification of the organisms and resistance markers claimed in the IFU, with the
exceptions noted above. It was determined that the risks associated with failure to detect
a small number of organisms included in the IFU could be mitigated via labeling. These
exceptions are communicated to end users in the Limitations section of the device
Package Insert.

5. Exclusivity:
To demonstrate the exclusivity of the iC-GN Assay, a comprehensive panel of non-target
organisms that may be encountered in positive blood cultures was evaluated. A total of
114 strains were tested including organisms phylogenetically related to iC-GN target
organisms as well as common blood culture contaminants. Potential cross-reactivity was

evaluated by testing exclusivity panel organisms at the highest possible concentrations,
considered eight hours beyond initial bottle positivity or the equivalent. Organisms were
grown in BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic blood culture bottles with human blood added on
the BD BACTEC System. Each strain was tested in triplicate. Performance is based on
the observation of all expected negative results. In the event of a false positive result or
other failure, the organism was retested in replicates of three (3) or ten (10). Three (3)
strains demonstrated reproducible cross-reactivity with iC-GN Assay targets:
Acinetobacter haemolyticus cross-reacted with Acinetobacter baumannii complex,
Klebsiella variicola cross-reacted with Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia odorifera
cross-reacted with Serratia marcescens. Exclusivity results are in the table below.
Exclusivity testing confirms that the device detects organisms not listed in the IFU at low
frequency. It was determined that the risks associated with the detection of organisms not
listed in the IFU could be mitigated via labeling. The organisms not in the IFU that were
detected are communicated to the end user in the limitations section of the Package
Insert.

6. Interfering Substances:
iC-GN Assay performance was evaluated in the presence of potentially inhibiting
substances that may be encountered in blood and blood culture media. Eight
representative target organisms plus one non-target organism were evaluated. Organisms
were tested at the lowest levels of bottle positivity, considered within two hours of bottle
“ring.” Potential interferents were tested at concentrations exceeding the highest
concentrations that may be encountered in blood and blood culture media (for
concentrations tested see 510(k) Summary for K190341, Table 13 (p.24-25)). Target
performance is based on all expected targets detected and no false positive targets
detected. Non-target performance is based on all negative results. In the event of a false
negative result, the organism/interferent combination was retested in replicates of ten
(10). In the event of a false positive result or other failure, the organism/interferent
combination was retested in triplicate. If the discordant result was observed in repeat
testing, the combination was retested at a decreased inhibitor concentration. below.
Interference testing was performed in BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic blood culture bottle
media, which has a sodium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) concentration of 0.05% w/v.
Additional SPS at a concentration greater than 0.05% w/v was found to interfere with the
performance of some iC-GN Assay targets, resulting in increased false negative results
and positive control check failures. Interference results are included in the table below. It
was determined that the risks associated with the interfering substance, SPS, could be
mitigated via labeling. The information regarding interference associated with SPS is
provided for the end user in the Package Insert.

7. Microbial Interference:
Potential microbial interference was evaluated by testing high concentrations of Gram-
negative exclusivity organisms in combination with low concentrations of iC-GN target
organisms. A total of sixty (60) Gram-negative exclusivity strains were tested at the
highest possible concentrations, considered eight hours beyond initial bottle positivity or
the equivalent. Eight (8) representative iC-GN target organisms were tested at
concentrations below the lowest levels of bottle positivity. Each organism combination
was tested in triplicate. Performance was based on all expected targets detected and no
false positive targets detected. In the event of a false negative result, the combination was
retested in replicates of ten (10). In the event of a false positive result or other failure, the
combination was retested in replicates of three (3) or ten (10). Microbial interference
results are presented in the table below. A small number of organisms initially were
observed to cause false negative results, however additional testing showed that the initial
results were not reproducible. It was determined that the risks associated with the
microbial interference could be mitigated via labeling. The organisms that showed an
increased risk of microbial interference are listed in the Limitations section of the
Package Insert.

8. Competitive Inhibition:
iC-GN Assay performance was evaluated with combinations of target analytes that may
be found in mixed positive blood cultures. One target organism was prepared at the
lowest level of bottle positivity, considered within two hours of bottle “ring”, while the
second target organism was prepared at the highest possible concentration, considered
eight hours after initial bottle positivity. All organisms were grown in BD BACTEC Plus
Aerobic blood cultures bottles with human blood added on the BD BACTEC System.
The organisms were combined at a ratio of one part “low” to four parts “high”. Each low
concentration organism was tested in combination with each high concentration organism
in triplicate. Performance was based on all expected targets detected. In the event of a
false negative result, the organism combination was retested in replicates of ten (10) at
the same “low” and “high” organism ratio. In the event of a reproducible false negative
result, the organism combination was retested in replicates of ten (10) at a ratio of one
part “low” to one part “high.” All high concentration iC-GN targets were detected. Due to
competitive inhibition, low concentration targets were not detected in 1.7% of tests
(3/178). When iC-GN target organisms were present at similar concentrations, all targets
were detected. Competitive inhibition results are included in the table below. Based on
the results of the competitive inhibition study, the following limitation was included in
the Package Insert, “Due to competitive inhibition, target organisms present at low
concentrations may not be detected by the iC-GN Assay when a second target organism
is present at higher concentrations in a mixed culture”.

9. Reproducibility:
To confirm the site-to-site, operator-to-operator, system-to-system, and lot-to-lot
reproducibility of the iC-GN Assay, a representative panel of target organisms and one
non-target organism were evaluated at two clinically relevant concentrations: initial bottle
positivity and eight hours beyond initial bottle positivity. Organisms were grown to the
appropriate concentrations in BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic blood culture bottles with
human blood added on the BD BACTEC System. Testing was performed by two
independent operators at each of three sites, two external and one internal. Each operator
tested the eighteen-organism panel in triplicate across five, non-consecutive days. Testing
was performed on six iC-GN Cassette lots and multiple iC-Systems. Performance is
based on all expected targets detected and no false positive targets detected. The table
below summarizes the reproducibility results stratified by iC-GN target and
concentration. Overall Reproducibility performance was 99.3%, confirming that iC-GN
Assay performance is reproducible across sites, operators, systems and lots.

B. Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with the Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed at five (5) geographically dispersed clinical
sites. Sites tested 1002 leftover de-identified specimens from anaerobic and aerobic blood
culture bottles flagged as positive by their respective continuous monitoring blood culture
system. Three of the commonly used blood culture systems were included in the study:
Thermo Fisher VersaTREK, BD BACTEC and BioMerieux BacT/ALERT.
Patient positive blood cultures confirmed by Gram stain to be positive for Gram-negative
bacilli were enrolled in the study. Any positive blood cultures showing an initial mixed
Gram stain were not enrolled or were subsequently withdrawn from the study dataset.
Final performance of the iC-GN Assay organism targets was compared to reference
culture followed by MALDI identification per the study protocol. Final performance of
the iC-GN Assay resistance marker targets was compared to PCR amplification followed
by confirmatory bi-directional sequencing. Phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing
(AST) was also performed on all specimens to identify additional samples which required
sequencing. Discordant samples were also sequenced.
To supplement performance of observed lower prevalence organisms, 170 contrived
samples were prepared using verified strains. Contrived samples were prepared at
iCubate using BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic Blood Culture Bottles with 10 mL of human
blood added (in accordance with BACTEC instructions). Organisms were spiked into
bottles at concentrations of 5-30 CFU/bottle and incubated until bottles were flagged as
positive. Aliquots of samples were frozen and provided to the sites (frozen) for testing.
Of the 1107 positive blood culture specimens enrolled in the study, a total of 105
specimens were excluded/withdrawn from the study and excluded from all subsequent
performance analyses. Of the 1002 specimens remaining, 976 were fresh prospective
specimens and 26 (2.6%) were frozen prospective specimens. Nineteen (19) samples

were excluded from the performance analysis for Proteus mirabilis due to confirmed
contamination of BD BACTEC Bottles with non-viable Proteus organisms or nucleic
acid, leaving a total of 983 evaluable specimens for Proteus mirabilis.
The total specimens excluded from the iC-GN Assay Method Comparison Study (n=105)
are listed by site and the reasons for exclusion are noted in the 510(k) Summary for
K190341, Table 12 (p.25). The most common reasons for exclusion included incomplete
reference testing and repeat iC-GN errors.
Throughout the course of the study, an initial error rate of 2.9 % (34/1181) was observed.
Reasons for error included the following: Positive controls check failure (27), Array
registration error (6), and Processor/System error (1). When an error was observed,
repeat testing was performed with the iC-GN Assay per the protocol. Upon repeat testing,
the error rate was reduced to 0.8% (9/1181). The 510(k) Summary for K190341, Table 13
(p.26) includes a table of the no-call results.
When performance of the iC-GN Assay was compared to reference culture followed by
MALDI identification or PCR/bi-directional sequencing, there was no significant
difference in performance noted between the five study sites or between the three blood
culture systems. Performance for all positive bottle types/systems combined is presented
in the tables below for detection of the iC-GN Assay targets as compared to culture and
MALDI or PCR/bi-directional sequencing. Results are stratified by prospectively tested
fresh specimens, prospectively collected/retrospectively tested frozen specimens and
contrived specimens. These data are provided in the tables below.

2. Analysis of Mixed Culture Results:
In the method comparison study, there were thirty (30) mixed culture specimens that
were detected by the iC-GN Assay, culture and MALDI, or both. There were twelve (12)
discrepant mixed samples for which iC-GN detected a target that was not detected by the
comparator assay. There were four (4) discrepant mixed samples for which the
comparator assay detected targets that were not detected by iC-GN. Due to competitive
inhibition, target organisms present at low concentrations may not be detected by the iC-
GN Assay when a second target organism is present at higher concentrations. See the
510(k) Summary, Tables 29 and 30 (p.31-32) which includes tables that list the mixed
target combinations detected by iC-GN and the comparator method in the clinical study.

C. Expected Values:
A total of 1002 prospectively collected fresh and frozen blood culture specimens were
obtained from five geographically dispersed clinical sites. The number and percentage of
positive cases (positivity rate) determined by the iC-GN Assay stratified by U.S. state for
each of the organisms and resistance markers detected by the assay are presented below.
Overall, the iC-GN Assay detected at least one organism in 89% (901/1002) prospectively
collected specimens and at least one resistance marker in 6.8% (68/1002) prospectively
collected specimens. Expected values are presented in the 510(k) Summary, Table 30 (p.32-
33).
VII. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
VIII. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
