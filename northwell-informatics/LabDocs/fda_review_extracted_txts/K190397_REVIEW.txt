III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Immunalysis Carisoprodol Metabolite / Meprobamate Urine HEIA is a homogenous enzyme
immunoassay for the qualitative analysis of carisoprodol metabolite, Meprobamate, at a cutoff of
280 ng/mL in human urine. The assay is intended for use in laboratories with automated clinical
chemistry analyzers. This in vitro diagnostic device is for prescription use only.
The Immunalysis Carisoprodol Metabolite / Meprobamate Urine HEIA provides only a
preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in
order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/ Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)
or Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any
drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Assay performance was established using the Olympus AU400e analyzer.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Immunalysis Carisoprodol Metabolite / Meprobamate Urine HEIA is based on the
competition of carisoprodol labeled enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and
the free Meprobamate in the urine sample for the fixed amount of sheep anti-carisoprodol
antibody binding sites. In the absence of the free Meprobamate in the sample, the antibody binds
the drug enzyme conjugate and enzyme activity is inhibited. This creates a dose response
relationship between drug concentration in the urine and enzyme activity. The enzyme G6PDH
activity is determined at 340 nm spectrophotometrically by the conversion of nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH.
B Principle of Operation:
The Immunalysis Carisoprodol Metabolite / Meprobamate Urine HEIA is based on the
competition of carisoprodol labeled enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and
the free drug in the urine sample for the fixed amount of sheep anti-carisoprodol antibody
binding sites. In the absence of the free drug in the sample, the antibody binds the drug enzyme
conjugate and enzyme activity is inhibited. This creates a dose response relationship between
drug concentration in the urine and enzyme activity. The enzyme G6PDH activity is determined

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The following laboratory performance studies were performed to determine substantial
equivalence of the Immunalysis Carisoprodol Urine HEIA to the predicate device.
Precision/ Cutoff Characterization
A precision/Cutoff Characterization study for meprobamate was performed for ten days
using three product lots with two runs per day in replicates of four on drug free urine (N=80)
spiked with meprobamate to concentrations of the equivalent of the meprobamate cutoff and
±25%, ±50%, ±75%, and ±100% of the cutoff. The spiked concentrations were confirmed by
Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The study verified that
the cutoff serves as a boundary between a negative and positive interpretation of a qualitative
result.
Precision test results in qualitative mode are presented in the table below:

490 +75% 80 80 Positive 80 Positive 80 Positive
560 +100% 80 80 Positive 80 Positive 80 Positive
2. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Specificity and Cross-Reactivity
Compounds that were determined by the sponsor to be structurally and functionally similar to
meprobamate were spiked into drug-free urine at levels that will yield a result that is equivalent
to the cutoff and were evaluated as potential cross-reactant in the test device. Each compound
was evaluated in replicates of four. Each compound was an independent spike and no drug
mixes were used.

Interference – Endogenous Compounds
Endogenous compounds and urine preservatives were evaluated by spiking the potential
interferent into drug free urine containing meprobamate at ±25% of the cutoff. Due to the
interference of boric acid observed at ±25% of the cutoff, potential interference was also
evaluated at ±50% of the cutoff. Other than boric acid, assay performance was not affected by all
the other internally existing physiological conditions tested. Endogenous compounds tested that
did not interfere in the assay are presented in the table below.

4. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The device is traceable to a commercially available, certified, standard material for
which the concentration is verified by GC-MS or LC-MS/ MS.
Accelerated stability and real time studies have been conducted for the device. Protocols and
acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims that
when stored un-opened at 2-8 º C, the device is stable for 12 months.
5. Detection Limit:
See Precision/Reproducibility section in XII.A.1, above.
6. Assay Cut-Off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cut-off
concentration appears in the precision section, VII.A.1, above.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
One hundred and sixty-seven (167) de-identified, unaltered leftover clinical urine samples
obtained from clinical testing laboratories were analyzed for total carisoprodol at an assay cutoff
of 280 ng/mL with the Immunalysis Carisoprodol Urine HEIA on the Olympus AU400e
compared to results by Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
Method comparison results are presented in the tables below.

Results from this testing included three false positive samples with meprobamate
concentrations less than 50% of the cutoff. It was determined in LC-MS/MS testing that
each of these samples included carisoprodol, as described in the table below, which caused
the positive device results.
