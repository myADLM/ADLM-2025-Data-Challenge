I. Device Description:
The BACT/ALERT MP Reagent System consists of three reagents: BACT/ALERT MP
Culture Bottle, the BACT/ALERT MP Antimicrobial Supplement (AS) and the
BACT/ALERT MP Nutrient Supplement (NS).
The BACT/ALERT Mycobacteria Detection System, used in conjunction with the
BACT/ALERT MP Reagent System, provide both a microbial detection system and a culture
media with suitable nutritional and environmental conditions to recover mycobacterial
species commonly isolated from patient specimens other than blood. The BACT/ALERT MP
Antimicrobial Supplement kit is intended to reduce the incidence of break-through
contamination due to bacteria which may survive the digestion-decontamination process.
Reconstituted BACT/ALERT MP Antimicrobial Supplement must be added to
BACT/ALERT MP bottles prior to inoculation of all non-sterile specimens. For recovery of
mycobacteria present in sterile specimens, only the BACT/ALERT MP Nutrient Supplement
should be added to the BACT/ALERT MP Culture Bottle. BACT/ALERT MP Nutrient
Supplement contains components which are necessary to ensure optimal growth of
mycobacteria present in the patient sample and is used for reconstitution of BACT/ALERT

MP Antimicrobial Supplement. Inoculated bottles are loaded into the instrument where they
are incubated and continuously monitored for the presence of mycobacteria that will grow in
the BACT/ALERT MP Culture Bottle. The BACT/ALERT MP Culture Bottle, the
BACT/ALERT MP Antimicrobial Supplement and the BACT/ALERT MP Nutrient
Supplement formulations were adjusted to decrease Time-To-Detection (TTD) of select
mycobacterial species.

L. Test Principle:
BACT/ALERT Mycobacterial Detection Systems utilize the same principle to detect
microorganisms in cultures taken from processed patient samples as is described for the
BACT/ALERT Microbial Detection System with respect to blood cultures. BACT/ALERT
Mycobacteria Detection Systems utilize a colorimetric sensor and reflected light to monitor
the presence and production of carbon dioxide (CO ) dissolved in the culture medium. If
2
microorganisms are present in the test sample, carbon dioxide is produced as the organisms
metabolize substrates in the culture medium. When growth of the microorganisms produces
CO , the color of the gas-permeable sensor installed in the bottom of each culture bottle
2
changes to lighter green or yellow. The lighter color results in an increase of reflectance units
monitored by the system. Bottle reflectance is monitored and recorded by the instrument
every 10 minutes. At the time of detection, approximate colony forming units (CFUs) per mL
are 106 - 107.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision:
Within-laboratory Precision
Within-laboratory precision was evaluated by conducting an in-house seed study over 12
non-consecutive days using multiple BTA 3D Systems, lots of each adjusted reagent (MP
Culture Bottle, Nutrient Supplement (NS), and Antimicrobial Supplement (AS)), and
operators. All species shown in Table 1a were tested at two target concentrations (300
CFU/bottle and 1000 CFU/bottle) representing a low concentration sample (~3x LoD)
and the concentration found in a patient sample with a positive Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB)
smear. Actual inoculums for the 300 and 1000 CFU/bottle targets ranged from six to-388
CFU/bottle and 20 to 1,292 CFU/bottle, respectively. Each species was tested with two
different sample matrices, representing a non-sterile patient sample (simulated sputum)
and sterile sample (pleural fluid). A matrix equivalency study was conducted to support
use of simulated sputum in all seeded studies. For more details, see the section titled,
“Simulated Sputum Matrix Equivalency Study”. For non-sterile samples, organisms
were spiked into simulated sputum and digested-decontaminated by the NaOH method
before inoculation into adjusted MP Culture Bottles with reconstituted Nutrient
Supplement and Antimicrobial Supplement added. For sterile samples, each organism
was spiked into pleural fluid and inoculated into adjusted MP Culture Bottles with NS
only. Percent recovery data was analyzed for each organism and for each test
concentration and matrix. Because no difference was noted, the data was combined and
used to evaluate the percent recovery for the species listed in Table 1a.”

Table 1a. Precision Study – Percent Recovery Results
Adjusted MP Bottle
Species (ATCC number) # Bottles # Bottles % Recovery
Tested Positive
M. fortuitum (6841) 384 384 100%
M. intracellulare (13950) 383 383 100%
M. kansasii (12478) 384 384 100%
M. scrofulaceum (19981) 384 384 100%
M. tuberculosis (25177) 383 383 100%
Performance was assessed by determining percent recovery (detection) and mean Time-
To-Detection (TTD). TTD is the amount of time from a bottle being placed on the BTA
3D instrument until it is flagged positive. Percent recovery reflects positive flag by the
instrument and subculture consistent with the appropriate seeded organism.
The study demonstrated that percent recovery was 100% for all mycobacterial species
regardless of sample matrix or inoculum level (Table 1a). Percent recovery was
unaffected by adjusted MP Culture Bottle lot.
Mean TTD was calculated independently for the following organism groups and
species: (i) non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) rapid growers (i.e., M. fortuitum-
ATCC 6841), (ii) NTM slow growers (i.e., M. intracellulare-ATCC 13950, M. kansasii-
ATCC 12478) and M. scrofulaceum-ATCC 19981), and (iii) Mycobacterium
tuberculosis-ATCC 25177. Mean TTD for these organism groups/species did not vary by
MP Culture Bottle lot. Mean TTDs were faster for mycobacteria spiked into pleural fluid
compared to simulated sputum (Table 1b). Although it was observed that mean TTD was
delayed for bottles from lot four with pleural fluid, this was attributed to only testing lot 4
with a subset of slower growing mycobacteria (i.e., M. intracellulare and M.
tuberculosis). Mean TTD results for the adjusted MP Culture Bottle are illustrated in
Table 1b, stratified by reagent lot and sample type.

Reproducibility
Reproducibility was evaluated by conducting a multi-center study at two external sites
and internally at bioMérieux, over five days, using multiple BTA 3D instruments, lots of
adjusted reagent (MP Culture Bottle, NS, and AS), and operators. The combined data
from a total of 1,800 bottles (5 organisms x 2 matrices x 2 inoculum levels x 2 operators
x 5 days x 3 reps per run x 3 sites) was used to evaluate the percent recovery for the
species listed in Table 2a. All species were tested at two target concentrations (300
CFU/bottle and 1000 CFU/bottle) representing a low concentration sample (~3x LoD)
and the concentration of a patient sample with a positive AFB smear. Each species was
tested with two different sample matrices, representing a non-sterile patient sample
(simulated sputum) and sterile sample (pleural fluid). For the non-sterile samples,
organisms were spiked into simulated sputum and digested-decontaminated before
inoculation into adjusted MP Culture Bottles supplemented with reconstituted AS. For
sterile samples, each organism was spiked into pleural fluid and inoculated into adjusted
MP bottles supplemented with NS.
Performance was assessed by determining percent recovery and mean TTD. The study
demonstrated that overall percent recovery in pleural fluid was 99.1% (446/450) for
mycobacteria spiked at a target inoculum of 300 CFU/bottle and 100% (450/450) for
mycobacteria spiked at a target inoculum of 1000 CFU/bottle (Table 2a). Overall percent
recovery in simulated sputum was 99.8% (449/450) at a target inoculum of 300
CFU/bottle and 100% (450/450) for mycobacteria spiked at a target inoculum of 1000
CFU/bottle (Table 2b). Percent recovery was not affected by adjusted MP Culture Bottle
lot (Table 2c).
Mean TTD was calculated independently for the following organism groups and
species: (i) non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) rapid growers (i.e., M. fortuitum-
ATCC 6841), (ii) NTM slow growers (i.e., M. intracellulare-ATCC 13950, M. kansasii-
ATCC 12478) and M. scrofulaceum-ATCC 19981), and (iii) Mycobacterium
tuberculosis-ATCC 25177. Mean TTD for these organism groups/species did not vary by
MP Culture Bottle lot. Mean TTD for mycobacteria was faster in pleural fluid than
simulated sputum (Table 2D). Mean TTD results for the adjusted MP Culture Bottle with
pleural fluid and simulated sputum are illustrated in Table 2d.

External QC Testing
During the Clinical Study, external quality control (QC) was conducted on the BTA
3D System using negative and positive control bottles. Positive control organisms
were seeded into adjusted MP Culture Bottles at target inoculum levels of 1000
CFU/bottle. Organism concentrations for bottle seeding were confirmed by plate
counting procedures. A positive control inoculated with M. fortuitum 6841 and a
negative control were tested once per week. In addition, an M. tuberculosis 25177
positive control was tested every other week for the duration of the study. Overall QC
results were found to be acceptable. Instances where unacceptable QC results were
observed were found to be due to technical errors (i.e., colony counts out of range,
contaminated bottles, etc.).
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection (LoD)
An in-house LoD study was conducted with seeded samples to determine the LoD of
mycobacteria in the adjusted MP Culture Bottle in the presence of reconstituted AS,
representing the reagent system as a whole. Testing with reconstituted AS was
conducted to represent the worst-case scenario, as the antimicrobials in AS can
negatively impact the growth of some mycobacterial species. For this study, the
species listed in Table 3 were grown on solid mycobacteria media until confluence
was achieved. Organisms were then vortexed to break up clumps. Subsequently, a
portion of the vortexed culture was used to generate a 100 CFU/bottle suspension in
mycobacteria media. The 100 CFU/bottle suspension was plated in triplicate and used

to determine final concentrations in each dilution (i.e., 0, 10, 25, 75, and 100
CFU/bottle). After inoculating the species denoted in Table 3 into adjusted MP
Culture Bottles, they were incubated on the BTA 3D instrument. Three lots of each
adjusted reagent (MP Culture Bottle, NS, and AS) were included. A minimum of 40
adjusted MP Culture Bottles were tested for each species at each inoculum level. All
bottles flagged positive by the instrument were subcultured for purity. Results were
considered valid if subcultures had no evidence of contamination and morphology
was consistent with the expected organism. The lowest inoculum level with a
recovery rate > 95% was defined as the LoD for that species. Results are illustrated
in Table 3.

Percent Recovery (Detection) Study
An in-house seeded study was conducted to evaluate percent recovery (detection) of
mycobacterial species in the adjusted MP Culture Bottle supplemented with Nutrient
Supplement or reconstituted AS (Antimicrobial Supplement and Nutrient
Supplement). A diverse set of 20 clinically and environmentally relevant
mycobacterial species were evaluated using three lots of each adjusted reagent (MP
Culture Bottle, AS, and NS). The species tested are listed in Table 4b. All organisms
were seeded into adjusted MP Culture Bottles at a target inoculum of 102 and 106
CFU/bottle to represent challenging concentrations and those commonly seen in
clinical environments. Actual inoculums for the 102 and 106 targets ranged from 30-
183 CFU/bottle and 3.0 x 105-1.82 x 106 CFU/bottle, respectively. All seeded bottles
were incubated on the BTA 3D System.
Performance was considered acceptable if > 95% of adjusted MP Culture Bottles
yielded a positive result for each organism/condition evaluated and overall.
The overall detection rate for the adjusted MP Culture Bottle was 100%, regardless of
inoculum level or supplementation (Table 4a). Calculation of the overall detection
rate excluded results for M. haemophilum and M. ulcerans, which were not recovered
in the adjusted MP Culture Bottle (Table 4b). Failure to recover these organisms was
not unexpected, as they have optimal temperature requirements outside the BTA 3D
instrument range, as indicated by a limitation in the package insert for the MP
Reagent System and predicate device. Percent recovery was the unaffected by
adjusted MP Culture Bottle lot.

1. One bottle was removed due to failure to inoculate
2. M. haemophilum and M. ulcerans were not recovered in the adjusted MP Culture Bottle.
Failure to recover these organisms was not unexpected, as they have optimal temperature
requirements outside the BTA 3D instrument range
3. One bottle was removed from analysis due to an early FP call
Time-To-Detection (TTD) Study
An in-house seeded study was conducted to evaluate Time-To-Detection (TTD) (in
days), for the MP Reagent System. For this study, the organisms listed in Table 5
were evaluated. All organisms were seeded into adjusted MP Culture Bottles at a
target inoculum of 102 and 106 CFU/bottle to represent challenging concentrations
and those commonly seen in clinical environments. Actual inoculums for the 102 and
106 CFU/bottle targets ranged from 30-183 CFU/bottle and 3.0 x 105 - 1.82 x 106
CFU/bottle, respectively. Three lots of each reagent of the MP Reagent System were
included in testing. Mean TTD results from the three lots, stratified by organism and
inoculum level, are shown in Table 5. When multiple strains were tested for a single
species, mean TTD was calculated by pooling strain data.
Mean TTD was considered acceptable if a given species was identified in < 42-days.
The mean TTD was < 42-days for all evaluated species and conditions.

To ensure that changes to the MP Reagent System formulation do not negatively
impact mean TTD, a comparison study was conducted with adjusted and current MP
Culture Bottles. For this study, the M. tuberculosis complex strains listed in Table 6
were inoculated at concentrations of <100 CFU/bottle into adjusted MP Culture
Bottle. Mean TTD results for 77 adjusted MP Culture Bottles were compared to
historical data from 2009 for 35 predicate MP Culture Bottles inoculated with the
same organisms at similar concentrations. Adjusted MP Culture Bottles were
supplemented with AS reconstituted with NS, while predicate bottles evaluated in the
historical study were supplemented with AS reconstituted with RF (reconstitution
fluid).
The overall mean TTD was 15.6 days for the adjusted MP Culture Bottle and 18.7
days for the predicate MP Culture Bottle, with a mean difference in TTD of 3.1 days
(Table 6). All evaluated mycobacterial strains favored the adjusted MP Culture Bottle
compared to the predicate MP Culture Bottle.

Contaminating Respiratory Flora (CRF) Suppression Study
An in-house study was conducted to evaluate the ability of the adjusted MP Culture
Bottle, in the presence of Antimicrobial Supplement, to suppress breakthrough
(growth) of common respiratory flora (CRF) found in sputum. For this study, the 35
CRF strains listed in Table 7 were inoculated independently at a target concentration
of 2000 CFU/bottle into simulated sputum. This concentration was chosen because it
represents the worst-case scenario encountered by inadequately digesting-
decontaminating non-sterile samples. Note that spiked, simulated sputum samples
were not processed (i.e., digested-decontaminated) before bottle inoculation. Ten
adjusted MP Culture Bottles were inoculated for each CRF organism in addition to
three positive control bottles (NS supplementation only). Three lots of adjusted
reagents (MP Culture Bottle, AS, and NS) were evaluated during the study.

Acceptable performance was demonstrated by no growth (breakthrough) in > 80% of
non-processed (i.e., non-digested-decontaminated) bottles in < 10 days. Acceptable
performance was shown for all organisms except A. baumanii (Sputum 2), B. cepacia
(STL102628), E. faecium (35667 and 8353), S. sanguinis (10556), and N. abscessus
(23824). N. abscessus breakthrough was expected as Nocardia are partially acid-fast

growth in the MP Reagent positive control bottles.
For the CRF organisms that exhibited breakthrough in the adjusted MP Culture
Bottle, simulated sputum spiked with organisms that broke through were digested-
decontaminated prior to bottle inoculation to demonstrate that processing can
suppress breakthrough. N. abscessus was not included in this evaluation. After
processing, no breakthrough was observed for A. baumanii (Sputum 2), B. cepacia
(STL102628), E. faecium (35667 and 8353), or S. sanguinis (10556), demonstrating
that sputum processing (i.e., digestion-decontamination) can prevent breakthrough
contamination.
Antimicrobial Supplement (AS) Vial Stopper Equivalency Study
Studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of replacing the current chlorobutyl AS
stopper with a bromobutyl AS stopper. For this study two lots of antimicrobial
supplement vials, with each stopper type, were evaluated at release and end of shelf-
life (20 months). In addition, thermally shocked bottles were tested at the end of
shelf-life to evaluate the worst-case scenario. At each time point physical parameters,
growth performance (GP), false positive (FP) rate, and suppression of contaminating
respiratory flora (CRF) were evaluated.
Results of testing indicated that all physical parameters were equivalent between the
lots tested. Additionally, all functional testing (GP, FP, and CRP) met all acceptance
criteria for all tested mycobacterial species. The study demonstrated that the
bromobutyl stopper is equivalent to the chlorobutyl stopper.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A multi-center prospective clinical study was conducted at three different geographic
sites in the U.S. and India to compare performance of the BACT/ALERT MP Reagent
System and BACT/ALERT MP Culture Bottle for non-sterile (e.g., sputum) and normally
sterile (e.g., tissues, fluids, etc.) specimens collected from patients suspected of
mycobacterial infection. A total of 1,488 bottle pairs were obtained from 1,162 patients.
There were a total of 1,435 non-sterile specimens and 53 sterile specimens obtained
20

--- Page 21 ---
during the study. Non-sterile specimens were subjected to digestion/decontamination
(processing) using two different methods. 1,294 specimens were digested/decontaminated
by the NALC-NaOH method, while 141 were digested/decontaminated using the NaOH
modified Petroff method. For processed specimens, reconstituted Antimicrobial
Supplement (AS) was added to the adjusted and current MP Culture Bottles. For sterile
specimens, Nutrient Supplement (NS) and Reconstitution Fluid (RF) were added to the
adjusted and current bottles, respectively. A primary solid media culture and primary
AFB smear were performed for each patient specimen. Subcultures were performed for
any bottle flagged positive by the instrument. For subcultures that recovered
mycobacteria, identification at the complex or genus/species level was performed by
standard biochemical/phenotypic methods or an FDA-cleared method (e.g., DNA
sequencing). A culture bottle was determined to be a “True Positive” if the culture was
flagged positive by the BACT/ALERT 3D System and resulted in growth of a
mycobacterial species upon bottle subculture. Clinical isolates recovered from each
subcultured bottle were classified as mycobacteria positives or breakthrough
contaminants.
A culture bottle was determined to be a false negative if the bottle was flagged negative
by the instrument and resulted in growth of a mycobacterial species upon bottle
subculture.
A culture bottle was determined to be a false positive if the bottle was flagged positive by
the instrument, but no viable organisms were present in the bottle as confirmed by
subculture.
The false negative rate for the adjusted and predicate bottle were 0.13% (2/1,488) and
0.27% (4/1,488), respectively, with a difference in the false negative rate of -0.14%. The
false positive rate for the adjusted and predicate bottle were 2.28% (34/1,488) and 4.77%
(71/1,488), respectively, with a difference in the false positive rate of -2.49%. These
results illustrate that the false negative and positive rates for the adjusted bottle are lower,
and therefore, equivalent to the predicate bottle.
To compare performance between the bottle types, Sensitivity and Specificity were
determined. Sensitivity was calculated as the number of bottles flagged as positive by the
instrument with mycobacteria recovered by subculture, out of the total number of
samples with a positive patient infected status. Specificity was calculated as the number
of bottles flagged negative by the instrument without mycobacteria isolated by
subculture, out of the total number of samples with a negative patient infected status.
Positive patient infected status was assigned to each patient specimen if the following
criteria were met: at least one of the paired bottle subcultures was positive or the primary
solid media culture recovered a mycobacterial species.
In total, 200 adjusted MP Culture Bottles and 188 predicate Culture Bottles flagged
positive by the BTA 3D instrument were positive for at least one mycobacterial species
by subculture. Compared to 231 specimens with a positive patient infected status, the
Sensitivity of the adjusted MP Culture Bottle was 86.6% (200/231) and 81.4% (188/231)
21

--- Page 22 ---
for the predicate MP Culture Bottle, with a difference in Sensitivity of 5.2%. Table 8
illustrates the performance of the adjusted and predicate MP Culture Bottles relative to
positive patient infected status. The ratio of true positives for the adjusted and predicate
MP Culture Bottles, relative to positive patient infected status, is 1.064 (95% CI: 0.999,
1.129), indicating that Sensitivity of the adjusted MP Culture Bottle is improved
compared to the predicate. Table 8a illustrates the ratio of true positives for the adjusted
vs. predicate MP Culture Bottles relative to positive patient infected status.

Percent Recovery
Percent recovery (detection) for the adjusted and predicate bottle was determined by
calculating the number of adjusted or predicate bottles flagged positive by the BTA 3D
System with mycobacteria recovered by subculture, out of the total number of bottles
flagged positive by the instrument with mycobacteria recovered by subculture.
Percent recovery was 94.3% for the adjusted bottle and 88.7% for the predicate bottle,
with a difference in percent recovery of 5.6%. Table 10 illustrates the number of adjusted
and predicate bottles that were positive by the BTA 3D instrument and recovered
mycobacteria by subculture, stratified by site. Table 11 contains percent recovery results
stratified by specimen type and mycobacterial species. During the clinical study, three
dual mycobacterial infections were recovered by both the adjusted and predicate bottles.

Time-To-Detection (TTD)
To determine if modifications to the formulation of the adjusted reagents (MP Culture
Bottle, AS, and NS) alter mean TTD for mycobacterial species, mean TTD (in Days) was
determined for each paired set of adjusted and predicate bottles for which the instrument
signaled positive and pure, mycobacterial growth was recovered by subculture.
The study demonstrated that mean TTD for the MTB group for all specimen types,
pooled, was 11.6 days in the adjusted bottle and 14.4 in the predicate bottle, for a mean
TTD difference of 2.7 days. Additionally, the study demonstrated that mean TTD for all
specimen types, pooled, for the NTM-rapid growers was 7.3 days in the adjusted bottle
and 7.4 days in the predicate bottle, with a mean TTD difference of 0.1 days. The mean
TTD for all specimen types, pooled, for the NTM-slow growers was 11.5 days in the
adjusted bottle and 11.8 days in the predicate bottle, with a mean TTD difference of 0.3
days. Results are illustrated in Table 12.

Breakthrough Contamination Rate
The breakthrough contamination rate, which is defined as the number of adjusted or
predicate bottles with a positive instrument signal that recovered a non-mycobacterial
organism by subculture and/or staining, was calculated for each bottle type. The
breakthrough contamination rate was calculated independently for sterile and non-sterile
specimens. For non-sterile specimens, results were stratified by the
digestion/decontamination method evaluated during the clinical study (i.e., NALC-NaOH
Method and NaOH Modified Petroff Method). Of the 1,435 non-sterile specimens
evaluated in the clinical study, 90.1% (1,293/1,435) were processed using the NALC-
NaOH Method and 9.8% (141/1,435) were processed using the NaOH Modified Petroff
Method. Results are illustrated in Table 12a, stratified by specimen type and

Percent Recovery in Seeded Simulated Sputum Samples
Due to the low prevalence of M. tuberculosis in the U.S. and difficulty obtaining NTM
specimens during the prospective trial, the clinical study was augmented with a seeded
study conducted at one U.S. site. For this study, seeded samples were generated from the
following clinically prevalent mycobacterial strains: two strains of M. tuberculosis
(ATCC25177 and a clinical isolate) and eight NTM strains (M. avium ATCC25291, M.
fortuitum ATCC6841, M. intracellulare ATCC13950, M. kansasii ATCC12478, M.
malmoense ATCC29571, M. scrofulaceum ATCC19981, M. szulgai clinical isolate, and
an M. xenopi clinical isolate). Seeded samples were produced by inoculating each strain
into simulated sputum matrix, taking into consideration the percent loss of cells during
digestion-decontamination. Considering cell loss during processing, simulated sputum
sample was inoculated with a single mycobacterial strain at a target CFU/bottle of 300,
500, and 1000 CFU/bottle. Actual inoculums for the 300, 500, and 1000 CFU/bottle
target inoculums ranged from 0.5-240, 0.5-390.5, and 1.5-500 CFU/bottle, respectively.
To represent a challenging clinical scenario, seeded samples were also inoculated with
common respiratory flora (CRF) representative of organisms found in either
immunocompetent or immunocompromised patient sputum. Immunocompetent CRF
group 1 consisted of E. faecalis, N. sicca, S. epidermidis, and S. oralis, while
immunocompromised CRF group 2 consisted of A. baumanii, C. albicans, E. coli, P.
aeruginosa, and S. aureus. Actual inoculum levels for these organisms ranged from 70-
156 CFU/bottle. Seeded samples were processed identically as was described for
prospectively collected clinical specimens. In total, 52 bottles (paired design) were
evaluated, 6 for each M. tuberculosis species (12 bottles in total) and 5 for each NTM
species (40 bottles in total). The adjusted and predicate bottles were found to be
equivalent, with each exhibiting 100% recovery for all seeded species regardless of
addition of CRF group 1 or CRF group 2.
Percent Recovery in Seeded Tissue and CSF Samples
During the prospective clinical study, it was difficult to procure non-sterile tissue samples
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. To determine the recovery rate of mycobacteria
from these uncommon sample types, a seeded study was performed. Seeded samples
were produced by spiking pooled CSF (from living donors) or homogenized tissue
samples (from cadavers), with the M. tuberculosis and NTM strains listed in Table 13.
Inoculums of 30-300 CFU/bottle were targeted for both CSF and tissue samples,
factoring in cell loss from digestion-decontamination. The actual inoculums ranged from
16-1136 CFU/bottle. Each CSF pool was tested individually, while tissue samples were
tested in triplicate. The adjusted and predicate bottles were equivalent, with 100% of
seeded species, regardless of sample type. Results are shown in Table 13, stratified by
sample type and species.

Simulated Sputum Matrix Equivalency Study
An in-house study was conducted to demonstrate equivalency between simulated
sputum (i.e., 1% methylcellulose with egg solution) and remnant patient sputum for
use in mycobacteria seeded studies. To ensure that simulated sputum samples were
representative of patient sputum samples, simulated sputum was supplemented with
human cell debris and mouth flora on oral swabs. In addition, CRF flora (e.g., E.
faecalis-ATCC29212, S. epidermidis-ATCC12228, and S. oralis-ATCC11663) were
added at a concentration of 2.5 x 106 CFU/mL per organism in order to achieve a
concentration of ~ 1 x 107 CFU/mL typically found in clinical sputum samples.
Remant patient sputum and simulated sputum were seeded with the organisms in
Table 14 at target mycobacteria concentrations, post digestion-decontamination, of
300 and 1000 CFU/bottle to represent a low inoculum (~3x LoD) and an incolum
close to the sensitivity of a positive AFB smear. After digestion-decontamination,
actual inoculums for the 300 CFU/bottle and 1000 CFU/bottle targets ranged from
31-336 CFU/bottle and 170-1165 CFU/bottle, respectively. Remnant and simulated
sputum samples were added to adjusted MP Culture Bottles supplemented with
reconstituted AS and incubated on the BTA 3D System. Percent recovery and mean
TTD were calculated.

Equivalence for remnant sputum and simulated sputum was demonstrated by > 95%
recovery for each mycobacteria species in each sputum type. Regardless of inoculum
level or sputum type, percent recovery was 100% for all species. It was noted that
mean TTDs varied by no greater than one day between the matrices for all evaluated
species. These results demonstrate that simulated sputum is equivalent to remnant
sputum for use in seeded mycobacteria studies.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected positive percentage of culture bottles will vary based on factors such as
patient population, specimen type, prevalence of organisms, site location, and
contamination rates. The expected values show below are based on the clinical study
conducted to evaluate the MP Reagent System:
• Percent mycobacterial positive cultures were observed to be 9.4% (range 0% -
14.3%) for isolates recovered from sterile specimens from three clincal trial sites
in the MP Reagent System.
• Percent mycobacterial positive cultures were observed to be 13.6% (range 4.0%-
41.0%) for isolates recovered from non-sterile specimens from three clinical trial
sites in the MP Reagent System.
• The breakthrough contamination rate for the MP Reagent System was observed to
be 7.1% (range 2.6%-10.0%) for non-sterile specimens recovered from two
clinical trial sites that were digested/decontaminated using the NALC-NaOH
Method.
• The breakthrough contamination rate for the MP Reagent System was observed to
be 3.5% for non-sterile specimens recovered from one clinical trial site that were
digested/decontaminated using the NaOH Modified Petroff Method.
• The breakthrough contamination rate for the MP Reagent system was observed to
be 1.9% for sterile specimens recovered from three clinical trial sites.
