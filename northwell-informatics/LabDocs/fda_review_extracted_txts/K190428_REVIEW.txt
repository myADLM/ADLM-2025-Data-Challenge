III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
Immunoassay for the in vitro qualitative detection of total antibodies (IgG and IgM) to hepatitis
A virus (HAV) in human pediatric (ages 2 through 21 years) and adult serum and plasma (Li
heparin, potassium EDTA, Na citrate, Na heparin). The assay, in conjunction with other
serological and clinical information, is indicated as an aid in the clinical laboratory diagnosis of
acute or past hepatitis A virus infection in persons with signs or symptoms of hepatitis and in
persons at increased risk for hepatitis A infection, or as an aid to identify HAV susceptible
individuals and to determine the presence of an antibody response to HAV in vaccine recipients.
The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on the cobas e
immunoassay analyzers.
Assay performance characteristics have not been established for immunocompromised or
immunosuppressed patients. This assay has not been FDA cleared or approved for the screening
of blood or plasma donors.
B Indication(s) for Use:

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Elecsys Anti-HAV II is a second-generation competitive immunoassay by Roche Diagnostics for
the in vitro qualitative detection of total antibodies (IgG and IgM) to the hepatitis A virus (HAV)
in human pediatric and adult serum and plasma. It is intended for use on the cobas e 601
immunoassay analyzer and utilizes the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA”
technology.
Results are determined automatically by the software by comparing the
electrochemiluminescence signal obtained from the reaction product of the sample with the
signal of the cutoff value previously obtained by calibration. Results are expressed as cutoff
indices (COIs).
The Elecsys Anti-HAV II is intended to be used with the following calibrators and controls:
• AHAV 2 Cal1 and AHAV 2 Cal2, included in the reagent RackPack
• PreciControl Anti-HAV II, sold separately
K190428 - Page 2 of 14

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
The Elecsys Anti-HAV II assay is a qualitative, serological, competitive immunoassay:
• 1st incubation: 20 μL of sample; the sample anti-HAV binds the added HAV antigen
• 2nd incubation: After addition of biotinylated antibodies and ruthenium complex*-labeled
antibodies specific for HAV antigen, together with streptavidin-coated microparticles, the
still-free binding sites on the HAV antigens become occupied. The entire complex
becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin.
• The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are
magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then
removed with ProCell M. Application of a voltage to the electrode induces
chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.
• Results are determined automatically by the software by comparing the
electrochemiluminescence signal obtained from the reaction product of the sample with
the signal of the cutoff value previously obtained by calibration.
*Tris(2,2’-bipyridyl) ruthenium(II)-complex (Ru(bpy))
Interpretation of the results
Numeric result Result message Interpretation / further steps
COI*) > 1.0 Non-reactive Negative for HAV-specific antibodies
COI ≤ 1.0 Reactive Positive for HAV-specific antibodies
* COI = cutoff index
The cutoff of the Elecsys Anti-HAV II assay was established with internal studies, and validation
of the cutoff was performed by external clinical studies. The cutoff of COI = 1.0 corresponds to
≤ 25.4 IU/L, as established with the 2nd International Standard for Anti-Hepatitis A,
Immunoglobulin, Human, NIBSC code: 97/646.

Negative specimens with biotin concentrations up to 100 ng/mL demonstrated ≤ 11 %
negative bias in COI values. Biotin concentrations greater than 100 ng/mL lead to higher
negative bias and in consequence can lead to false positive Elecsys Anti HAV II results.
Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that serum concentrations of biotin can reach up to
355 ng/mL within the first hour after ingestion for subjects consuming supplements of 20
mg biotin per day1 and up to 1160 ng/mL in plasma for subjects consuming a single dose
of 300 mg biotin.2
5. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable.
6. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
This method has been standardized against WHO Standards NIBSC (National Institute for
Biological Standards and Control) code: 97/646.
Specimen Stability:
Six of each human serum, K2-EDTA, Li-Heparin, and Na-Citrate plasma samples and seven
K3-EDTA and Na-Heparin plasma samples were aliquoted and measured fresh (reference
value) and after storage. Samples were tested in triplicate at the designated time points.
Results support the stability of specimens stored under the following conditions:
• 2-8°C for 14 days
• 20-25°C for 6 days
• -15 to -25°C for 3 months
• 5 freeze / thaw cycles
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The 2nd International Standard for Anti-Hepatitis A, Immunoglobulin, Human, NIBSC code:
97/646 was serially diluted to target concentrations ranging from 0 to 500 IU/L in 10 samples
prepared from pooled Anti-HAV negative serum. The samples were tested in 2 replicates per
run in 2 runs. The study was performed using three reagent and three calibrator lots. The
concentration at the cutoff COI = 1 was determined to be < 25.4 IU/L.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Matrix Comparison:
The recovery of analyte values in the presence of anticoagulants with the Elecsys Anti‑HAV
II assay was determined by comparing values obtained from samples drawn into matched
serum and plasma collection tubes from 60 subjects. The samples were spiked with anti-
HAV positive sera from individual donors to obtain a range of anti-HAV concentrations and
were tested on the cobas e 601. The difference in COI value of each plasma sample
compared to the matched serum sample was calculated. The following table summarizes the
results:

The lower bound of the 95% confidence intervals for PPA ranged from 90.45% in the
hospitalized cohort to 97.18% in the symptomatic cohort. The lower bound of the ≥ 95%
confidence intervals for NPA ranged from 52.36% in the pediatric cohort to 93.04% in the
hospitalized cohort. For the pediatric cohort, there were 18 specimens negative by the
predicate Elecsys Anti-HAV assay, of which 14 (77.8%) were also negative with the Elecsys
Anti-HAV II assay. Of the 4 discrepant results in the pediatric population, 2 were borderline
by the predicate Elecsys Anti-HAV assay and were counted as discordant when calculating
negative percent agreement. The lower bound of the 95% CI for the NPA in the pediatric
population is influenced by the small number of specimens (n = 18).
Pre- and Post-HAV Vaccination
A cohort of specimens that were collected both pre- and post-HAV vaccination was
evaluated by the Elecsys Anti-HAV II assay and the predicate Elecsys Anti-HAV assay. The
post-vaccination specimen was obtained at least 4 weeks, but not more than 10 weeks, after
the completion of the vaccine regimen. Three HAV vaccines, which are currently licensed in
the U.S., were used. No discordant results between the Elecsys Anti-HAV II and the Elecsys
Anti-HAV assay were observed. The combined results are summarized in the following
table:

Seroconversion Panels
Four seroconversion panels were evaluated. Each panel consisted of multiple specimens
collected from one subject over time. According to information provided by the panel
vendor, the collection days spanned the point of seroconversion from a non-reactive anti-
HAV status to a reactive status. The four panels were analyzed with the Elecsys Anti-HAV II
and the predicate Elecsys Anti-HAV assays using the cobas e 601. Results for the Elecsys
Anti-HAV II and Elecsys Anti-HAV assays were equivalent in all four panels.
