III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
The Cepheid Xpert C. difficile/Epi Control Panel is intended for use as external assayed positive
and negative quality controls to monitor the performance of in vitro laboratory nucleic acid
testing procedures for the qualitative detection of Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile
performed with the Cepheid Xpert C. difficile/Epi assay on the GeneXpert Dx System. The
controls comprise cultured and inactivated Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile 027-NAP1-B1
as the positive control and Clostridium sordellii as the negative control.
The Cepheid Xpert C. difficile/Epi Control Panel is not intended to replace manufacturer
controls provided with the device.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Same as Intended Use
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For in vitro diagnostic use.
The Cepheid Xpert C. difficile/Epi Control Panel is not intended to replace manufacturer
controls provided with the device
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Cepheid GeneXpert Dx System
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Cepheid Xpert C. difficile/Epi Control Panel comprises lyophilized Positive and Negative
Control swabs that are individually packaged in foil pouches containing dessicant. The Positive
Control swabs are formulated with a heat-inactivated 027/NAP1/B1 strain of Clostridium
(Clostridioides) difficile that carries each of the targets detected by the Cepheid Xpert C.
difficile/Epi Assay (i.e., the toxin B [tcdB] and binary toxin genes and a single base deletion in
the tcdC gene). The Negative Control Swab contains a heat-inactivated strain of Clostridium
sordellii that lacks the toxin B, binary toxin and tcdC targets.
B Principle of Operation:
The Cepheid Xpert C. difficile/Epi Control Panel is intended for use as assayed quality control
material to monitor the DNA extraction, amplification and detection processes associated with

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of results obtained with the Cepheid Xpert C. difficile/Epi Control Panel
was evaluated in a study performed at three sites over five days, with two operators per site.
Each operator tested at least three Positive and three Negative Control Swabs on each day of
the study according to the instructions for use (3 sites x 5 days x 2 operators x ≥3 replicates =
≥90 replicates per control in total). Three lots of Positive and Negative Controls were
included in the study, the results of which are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Repeat testing
was performed for three controls (1 Positive; 2 Negative) that were associated with run
failures due to instrument or reagent error. After repeat testing, all Positive and Negative
Control swabs produced the expected results. The reproducibility of the Cepheid Xpert C.
difficile/Epi Control Panel within and between sites/GeneXpert Dx Systems, operators and
within and between lots was determined to be acceptable.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Reagent Stability
Reagent shelf-life was established in an Accelerated Stability Study that was performed with
three lots of Cepheid Xpert C. difficile/Epi Control Panels that were placed at 43, 53 or 63°C
for up to 42 days. All qualitative control results were as expected and there was no evidence
of product degradation under the conditions tested. The results of this study were used to
support a claimed shelf-life of 18 months at 2-25°C, which will be verified by conducting a
Real-time Stability Study.
In Use Stability
The stability of Cepheid Xpert C. difficile/Epi Control Panel members after expression in
Cepheid Xpert C. difficile/Epi Sample Reagent was evaluated by holding rehydrated controls
at ambient temperature for different lengths of time prior to testing. The results of the study
support use of the Cepheid Xpert C. difficile/Epi Control Panel within 5 hours of
reconstitution in Sample Reagent when held at 20°C.
