H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
HardyCHROM CRE is a selective and differential chromogenic agar medium intended
for the qualitative and presumptive detection from stool specimens of Escherichia coli
that are non-susceptible to carbapenems as pink colonies and KES (Klebsiella aerogenes,
Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae complex, and Serratia
marcescens) that are non-susceptible to carbapenems as blue colonies.
HardyCHROM CRE is intended as an aid in the detection, identification of colonization
and control of these bacteria in a healthcare setting. HardyCHROMCRE is not intended
to diagnose infection or guide therapy. Results can be interpreted after incubation for 18-
24 hours.
Subculture to non-selective medium is required for confirming identification,
antimicrobial susceptibility testing and epidemiological typing.
A lack of growth or the absence of pink or blue colonies on HardyCHROM CRE does not
preclude the presence of Escherichia coli and KES that are non-susceptible to
carbapenems.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
The following limitations have been added to the device labeling:
• “Do not incubate plates in a CO atmosphere”
2
• “Cultures on HardyCHROM CRE should be incubated at 35-37°C for 18-24
hours. Analytical and clinical studies showed reduced specificity with
cultures incubated longer than 24 hours. Do not incubate more than 24
hours.”
• “The clinical performance of HardyCHROM CRE was established with fresh
stool samples. Compatibility with stool in C&S Medium Transport (Cary
Blair Formula) was evaluated in the contrived study but not in the
prospective study.”

--- Page 3 ---
• “Colonies that are colorless, off-white, yellow or green, or have fuzzy/mold
appearance should not be considered carbapenem non-susceptible
Eschrichia coli or KES (Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae complex, and Serriatia marcescens).
• “A lack of growth or the absence of pink or blue colonies on
HardyCHROM™ CRE does not preclude the presence of Escherichia coli,
Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Enterobacter cloacae complex, or Serratia marcescens that are non-
susceptible to carbapenems. False negative results may occur due to
variations in sampling, slow development or failure to develop the expected
colony color, or the presence of organisms that are susceptible to the
antimicrobial agents included in the HardyCHROM™ CRE medium but
which are non-susceptible to other carbapenems”.
• “A small percentage of E. coli lacking the enzyme beta-D-glucuronidase may
appear as white to off-white colonies on HardyCHROM CRE and would be
considered as false-negative”
• “Analytical and clinical testing of HardyCHROM CRE has shown that
carbapenem non-susceptible Citrobacter spp. may appear as pink or blue
colonies at 18 and 24 hours
• “Analytical and Clinical testing of HardyCHROM CRE has shown that gram
positive cocci and gram positive rods may be recovered as tiny, blue colonies
at 18 and 24 hours”.
• “Analytical testing of HardyCHROM CRE has shown that Aspergillus
brasiliensis may appear as blue and fuzzy at 22 to 24 hours.”
• “The colony size of all target carbapenem non-susceptible organisms (except
Serratia marcescens) may appear smaller in the presence of high
concentrations of Acinetobacter baumanii, Aeromonas hydrophila,
Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The effect of
non-target organisms on Klebsiella aerogenes colony size and color is
unknown. In the presence of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, colonies of
Enterobacter cloacae complex may appear purple and small after incubation
for 24 hours”.
• “In the analytical mixed infection study, the non-target organisms were tested
at a concentration of 1.5 x 108 CFU/mL. The accuracy of this device for
detecting carbapenem non-susceptible Escherichia coli or KES in the
presence of the non-target organisms at higher concentrations is unknown.”

--- Page 4 ---
• “Some Enterobacter cloacae complex isolates may appear as pink colonies
on HardyCHROM CRE and be falsely considered as E. coli.”
• “If no growth of carbapenem non-susceptible strains of E. coli and KES (K.
aerogenes, K. oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae complex, and S.
marcescens) is observed on HardyCHROM CRE after 18 hours of
incuabation, plates should be incubated at 35 to 37°C for up to 24 hours”.
• “Analytical testing of HardyCHROM CRE has shown that areas of heavy
growth (1st quadrant) of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia may appear light
blue at 24 hours and produce false positive results (blue color for
carbapenem non-susceptible KES). Only well isolated colonies should be
evaluated for color morphology.”
4. Special instrument requirements:
None
I. Device Description:
HardyCHROM CRE is a selective and differential chromogenic culture medium intended for
screening of stool specimen for carbapenem non-susceptible Escherichia coli, and KES
(Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae
complex, and Serratia marcescens). The selective components in HardyCHROM CRE
inhibit the growth of yeast, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram negative bacteria that are
sensitive to ertapenem. HardyCHROM CRE differentiates Escherichia coli (pink colonies)
from KES (blue colonies).
All isolates must be subcultured for confirmatory identification, antimicrobial susceptibility
testing and, if required, epidemiological typing. Further biochemical analysis is required to
confirm the production of carbapenemase or any other mechanism of resistance.

L. Test Principle:
HardyCHROM CRE is a selective and differential culture medium for the detection
from stool specimens of Escherichia coli that are non-susceptible to carbapenems as pink
colonies and KES (Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Enterobacter cloacae complex, and Serratia marcescens) that are non-susceptible to
carbapenems as blue colonies. Phenotypic confirmation of non-susceptibility (Intermediate
and/or resistant) to carbapenems is done by demonstrating non-susceptibility to one of the
selected agents using MIC or disk diffusion.
The selective components in HardyCHROM CRE culture medium are designed to inhibit the
growth of yeasts and gram-positive bacteria, as well as gram-negative carbapenem-sensitive
bacteria. Organisms that grow on HardyCHROM CRE are differentiated based on the
metabolism of chromogenic substrates. The presence of chromogens allows the
differentiation of gram-negative bacteria that produce carbapenemase or that inactivate
carbapenems by mechanisms other than production of carbapenemase, e.g. cephalosporinase
production combined with porin loss. The colonies of those bacteria that release products
when they use the chromogens as a substrate source appear colored.
Testing is performed by direct inoculation of the stool onto the culture medium. Cultures are
read after incubation of the plates for 18-24 hours at 35-37°C in an aerobic atmosphere. All
presumptive carbapenem non-susceptible isolates that appear pink or blue on HardyCHROM
CRE must be sub-cultured to non-selective medium for identification and antimicrobial
susceptibility testing according to established methods.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing was conducted at three sites (two external and one internal
site) using a set of blinded panel of 10 Gram negative organisms in transport medium
(Cary Blair). Each isolate was tested in duplicate over five days (2 replicates x 5 days
x 2 operators x 3 sites = 60 results per species). The reproducibility panel included f 5
CRE-positive organisms [Enterobacter cloacae complex (one isolate), Escherichia
coli (one isolate) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (three isolates) at 103 CFU/mL] , and 5
CRE negative organisms [Shigella flexneri (one isolate), Shigella sonnei (one isolate),
Staphylococcus aureus (one isolate), Staphylococcus epidermidis (one isolate) and
Escherichia coli (one isolate) at 107 CFU/ml]. Quality control organisms (K.
pneumoniae ATCC BAA 1705, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 and Escherichia coli
ATCC 25922) were included in the study. Two operators and two readers, who were
blinded to each other’s results, participated in the study at each site. The bacterial
suspensions were prepared and shipped overnight to the test sites on ice prior to each
day of testing. At the test sites, 10µl loop of each bacterial suspension was streaked
for isolation onto HardyCHROM CRE plate, which was then incubated for 24 hours
at 35°C prior to being read by each operator. At 24h incubation, HardyCHROM CRE
plates were evaluated for growth and chromogenic performance. All carbapenem
non-susceptible species tested were detected by HardyCHROM CRE with the correct
chromogenic reaction on all days of the reproducibility study (Table 2). The
reproducibility results of this study stratified by organism (expected color) is
summarized in Table 2A.

QC testing was performed daily during the analytical and clinical studies using
organisms that are either expected to grow (CRE Positive, carbapenem non-
susceptible) or expected to be inhibited (CRE Negative, carbapenem susceptible) on
HardyCHROM CRE.
Testing of QC organisms on HardyCHROM CRE yielded 100% agreement with the
expected results.
A list of appropriate strains for use as External controls is provided in Table 3.

1According to CLSI document M100, this QC organism may undergo a spontaneous loss of plasmid encoding
carbapenemase genes, leading to false-negative QC results. To avoid false-negative QC results, this QC organism
should be subcultured to or maintained in a carbapenem-containing medium prior to inoculating onto
HardyCHROM CRE Agar.
Specimen Stability
A study was conducted to determine the acceptable duration of storage of stool
specimens that are either raw (no preservative) or preserved in transport media prior
to inoculation on HardyCHROM CRE plates. One strain from each of the following
carbapenem non-susceptible species: Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca,
Enterobacter cloacae complex, Serratia marcescens was seeded into verified CRE
negative stool specimens in duplicate at a final concentration of 1.5x102 CFU/mL and
immediately 100µl of the stool was spread-plated onto a HardyCHROM CRE plate
(0h timepoint). One set of seeded samples was stored at room temperature (22-25°C)
for 24h, and the other set was stored at refrigerated temperature (2-8°C) for 168h
prior to inoculation on HardyCHROM CRE. One hundred microliters of each seeded
stool was spread-plated onto HardyCHROM CRE at determined timepoints: (1, 4, 8,
12 and 24h for room temperature storage) and at (1, 4, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 148 and
168h for refrigerated storage). The plates were incubated at 35°C and evaluated for
colony count and colony morphology at 18h and 24 hours.
All species tested produced the expected color reaction at 18 and 24h with and were
successfully recovered from samples held at room temperature (23-24°C) for up to
24h or at 2-8°C for up to 168h.

Appropriate storage conditions for stool specimens prior to plating on HardyCHROM
CRE are included in the labeling.
Incubation Study
A study was conducted to determine the recommended range of incubation times for
recovery of carbapenem non-susceptible target organisms on HardyCHROM CRE.
Two well characterized strains of representative targeted species were serially diluted
in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) to a final concentration of 1.5 x 102 CFU/mL and 100µl
was inoculated to HardyCHROM CRE agar plates that were incubated at 35°C. Plates
were examined for growth and color every 2 hours from 18 to 26 hours, and from 42-
50 hours of incubation. The expected colony color for each target species tested was
observed after 18 hours except that pigmentation darkened over time.
As a result of this study, the following limitation was added to the labeling:
“Cultures on HardyCHROM CRE should be incubated at 35-37°C for 18-24
hours. Analytical and clinical studies showed reduced specificity with cultures
incubated longer than 24 hours. Do not incubate more than 24 hours”.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection
The analytical sensitivity of HardyCHROM CRE with raw stool was determined for
carbapenem non-susceptible target organisms that exhibited various β-lactamase
genotypes (Table 4). Each target organism was diluted in TSB/saline then inoculated
into CRE-negative pooled stool specimen. Aliquots of 100ul were spread-plated onto
HardyCHROM CRE plates in duplicate. Parallel dilutions of each organism were also
prepared in TSB/saline and plated on blood agar (growth controls). All culture plates
were incubated aerobically at 35°C and checked for colony counts after 24 hours. The
Limit of detection (LoD) was estimated at 1.5x102 CFU/mL based on the lowest
dilution at which growth with the expected color was visible on HardyCHROM CRE
plates.
Confirmation of LoD
A fresh versus frozen study was performed and it was demonstrated that using frozen
stool matrix is equivalent to using fresh matrix.
Because the LoD study was conducted using a homogenous pool of previously frozen
stool matrix, an additional confirmation study was performed to demonstrate recovery
of the targeted carbapenem non-susceptible organisms at LoD target levels from
different fresh stool matrices.
One of the two strains of each genus used in the LoD study was seeded into five
different stool matrices at a final concentration at 1.5x102 CFU/mL. Each stool
specimen was tested “raw” (unpreserved) as well as diluted in C&S Medium
Transport Cary Blair Formula. One hundred microliter aliquots of each stool
9

--- Page 10 ---
specimen were then used to inoculate HardyCHROM CRE Agar Plates were
incubated at 35°C and checked for colony counts and colony morphology at 18 and
24 hours.
As a medium that allows the growth of discernible colonies, the LoD is dependent on
the number of organisms in the suspension used to spike the specimens and the
volume of the inoculum used for plating. For each strain the LOD was confirmed to
be 1.5x102 CFU/mL stool with 100ul inoculum in distinct stool samples (equivalent
to 15 CFU/plate). The List of the targeted species used in the LoD study is shown in
Table 4.
Klebsiella aerogenes was not evaluated in the LoD study. However, seven strains of
this organism were tested in the contrived study at 3 x 104 CFU/mL with 1µl
inoculum (equivalent to 30 CFU/plate) and were successfully recovered.

Analytical Reactivity/Inclusivity
Inclusivity of HardyCHROM CRE Agar was evaluated by testing 77 well
characterized carbapenem non-susceptible strains of Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli,
Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella ozaenae, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens) with various molecular and susceptibility
profiles. Each strain was diluted in TSB to a target level of 1.5 x 102 CFU/mL and
100ul was spread-plated onto HardyCHROM CRE agar plate. The plates were
incubated at 35°C and read for growth and colony morphology. If no growth was
observed, at the determined LoD, higher target levels were tested until organism was
recovered. The HardyCHROM CRE was able to recover 72 of 77 (93.5%) of the
carbapenem non-susceptible strains tested at 1.5 x102 CFU/mL (100ul inoculum) after
24 h incubation. The remaining five strains were detected at either 103 or 104
CFU/mL. Klebsiella aerogenes was not evaluated in the analytical reactivity study.

Variations in the colony color of KES were observed (e.g, blue, blue with pink halo).
Information on potential color and morphology variations is provided in the labeling
e. Analytical specificity/Cross-Reactivity Challenge:
The analytical specificity of HardyCHROM CRE was evaluated by testing a panel of
carbapenem-susceptible target species as well as non-target species that are likely to
be found in stool specimens. Included were isolates of the target organisms that
exhibited resistance mechanisms other than carbapenemase (e.g., Extended Spectrum
β-lactamase). Testing was performed by inoculating 10µL of a 1.5 x 108 CFU/mL
suspension of each organism on HardyCHROM CRE and incubating at 35°C for 24
hours. A non-selective culture medium was also inoculated with the same suspension
of organisms as a control to demonstrate viability of the cell stock. The organisms
tested are listed in Tables 5. The majority of organisms tested did not exhibit pink, or
blue colonies or were inhibited on HardyCHROM CRE at 24 hours with the
following exceptions:
• Three organisms Pediococcus, E. faecalis (vanB+) and E. faecium (vanA+)
produced pinpoint blue colonies at 48 hours of incubation
• Aspergillus brasiliensis produced blue colonies at 22 to 24 hours but could
readily be distinguished morphologically as a fungus.
• Stenotrophomonas maltophila produced light blue colonies in areas of high
inoculum concentration at 24 hours.
• Carbapenem non-susceptible Citrobacter species produced pink, or pink with
blue halo and/or blue or blue with pink halo colonies.
As a result of this study, the following limitations were included in the Labeling:
• “Analytical and Clinical testing of HardyCHROM CRE has shown that gram
positive cocci and gram positive rods may be recovered as tiny, blue colonies
at 18 and 24 hours.”
• Analytical testing of HardyCHROM™ CRE has shown that areas of heavy
growth (1st quadrant) of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia may appear light
blue at 24 hours and produce false positive results (blue color for
carbapenem non-susceptible KES). Only well isolated colonies should be
evaluated for color morphology.
• “Analytical testing of HardyCHROM CRE has shown that Aspergillus
brasiliensis may appear as blue and fuzzy at 22 to 24 hours.”
• “Analytical and clinical testing of HardyCHROM CRE has shown that
carbapenem non-susceptible Citrobacter spp. may appear as pink or blue

g. Assay Interference:
Interfering Substances
A study was conducted to evaluate the potential for interference with the growth and
color morphology of colonies on HardyCHROM CRE in the presence of potentially
interfering substances that might be present in stool specimen. Testing was performed
in a stool matrix in the presence and absence of each interfering substance with
representative target organisms (E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae complex, Klebsiella
oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens), at a final concentration of
1.5 x 103 CFU/mL. Both 10µl (1x LoD) and 100µL (10x LoD) inoculum volumes
were used. Plates were incubated at 35°C and examined for colony count and colony
morphology after 24h. A list of the potentially interfering substances tested and their
concentrations is provided in Table 6. None of the substances was found to interfere
at the concentrations tested with recovery of the target organisms with the expected
colony color.

Interfering Microorganisms
A study was performed to demonstrate the ability to discriminate the recovery of
carbapenem non-susceptible target organisms in the presence of non-target species
that grew on HardyCHROM CRE in the Analytical Specificity Study. Testing was
performed with organism suspensions prepared in TSB. The representative target
organisms were at a concentration of 7.5 x 103 CFU/mL, and the non-target species
were at high concentrations of 1.5 x 108 CFU/mL. Ten microliters of each suspension
were inoculated onto HardyCHROM CRE which was incubated at 35°C. Plates were
read at 24 hours. A list of the potentially interfering microorganisms tested is
provided in Table 7.

All the target species were recovered in the presence of non-target organisms with the
expected colony color after 24 hours with the following exceptions:
• E. cloacae in the presence of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, produced small,
Dark Purple colonies.
• The colony size of all target organisms (except S. marcescens) was reduced in
the presence of the following non-target species, although the colony color
was as expected: A. baumannii, A. hydrophila, P. fluorescens, P. aeruginosa
and S. maltophilia.

• Pseudomonas aeruginosa had an effect on colony size of all target strains
tested except Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter cloacae complex (E.
asburia).
• K. aerogenes was not evaluated in the interfering microorganisms study in
the presence of non-targeted organisms. Therefore, the effect of the non-
target organisms on the size and color of this organism colonies is unknown.
As a result of this study, the following Limitations were included in their labeling:
• “In the presence of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, colonies of Enterobacter
cloacae complex may appear purple and small after incubation for 24
hours.”
• “The colony size of all target carbapenem non-susceptible organisms (except
Serratia marcescens) may appear smaller in the presence of high
concentrations of Acinetobacter baumanii, Aeromonas hydrophila,
Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The effect of
non-target organisms on Klebsiella aerogenes colony size and color is
unknown. In the presence of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, colonies of
Enterobacter cloacae complex may appear purple and small after incubation
for 24 hours”.
• “In the analytical mixed infection study, the non-target organisms were tested
at a concentration of 1.5 x 108 CFU/mL. The accuracy of this device for
detecting carbapenem non-susceptible Escherichia coli or KES in the
presence of the non-target organisms at higher concentrations is unknown.”

The performance of HardyCHROM CRE was evaluated in a prospective Clinical
Study conducted at three geographically diverse sites in the US. For the recovery of
carbapenem non-susceptible Escherichia coli, and KES (Klebsiella oxytoca,
Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae complex, and
Serratia marcescens) species, fresh stool samples were inoculated onto
HardyCHROM CRE agar. The plates were incubated at 35°C and evaluated for
colony color at 18 and 24 hours. Results were compared to a culture reference method
comprised of a selective enrichment culture of stool in Trypticase Soy Broth (TSB)
containing 1µg/mL meropenem and 3µg/mL vancomycin, followed by subculture to
MacConkey agar. Plates were first assessed for growth or no growth. Colonies that
were observed on either MacConkey agar or HardyCHROM CRE were subcultured
and submitted for identification and susceptibility testing using FDA cleared
methods. A reference result was considered negative if either no colonies of the
targeted species were observed or if the recovered colonies were carbapenem-
susceptible organisms or growth of any organism other than E. coli (pink) or KES
(blue). Identification was performed using an FDA cleared MALDI-TOF test system.
Susceptibility and confirmed CRE phenotype were determined using an FDA cleared
test (gradient agar diffusion disk diffusion).
A total of 1, 628 specimens were enrolled in the study. Of these, 144 were excluded
from the analysis of performance due to protocol deviations. A total of 1,484 stool
samples were included in the analysis of performance. As a growth medium, recovery
of multiple isolates from each specimen is possible. Two separate analyses were
performed, as follows:
The performance of HardyCHROM CRE for recovery of pink colonies (as indicative
of carbapenem non-susceptible Escherichia coli) from prospectively collected stool
specimens at 18h is shown in Table 8 and at 24h is shown in Table 9.
The performance of HardyCHROM CRE for recovery of blue carbapenem non-
susceptible KES (Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella aerogenes,
Enterobacter cloacae complex, and Serratia marcescens) from prospectively
collected clinical specimens at 18h is shown in Table 10 and at 24h is shown in
Table 11.

K. aerogenes (2), K. oxytoca (2).
4 Includes Gram positive cocci (7), C. freundii (3), E. kobei (3), C. youngae (1), S. liquefaciens (1)
As a result of this study, the following limitations were included in the labeling:
• “Some Enterobacter cloacae complex isolates may appear as pink colonies
on HardyCHROM CRE and be falsely considered as E. coli.”
• “Analytical and clinical testing of HardyCHROM CRE has shown that
carbapenem non-susceptible Citrobacter spp. may be recovered as pink or
blue colonies at 18 and 24 hours.”
• “The clinical performance of HardyCHROM™ CRE was established with
fresh stool samples. Compatibility with stool in C&S Medium Transport
(Cary Blair Formula) was evaluated in the contrived study but not in the
prospective study.”
Contrived Specimen Study
To supplement testing of prospectively collected clinical specimens, a total of 203
contrived specimens were also evaluated on HardyCHROM CRE: 153 were spiked
with isolates with confirmed non- susceptibility to carbapenems, and 50 specimens
free of carbapenem non-susceptible organisms. These 153 specimens were prepared
by spiking 38 E. coli and 115 KES (22 Enterobacter cloacae complex, 7 Klebsiella
aerogenes, 9 Klebsiella oxytoca, 65 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Klebsiella variicola
and 10 Serratia marcescens) of known susceptibility phenotype directly into CRE
negative stool matrix (raw or diluted in C&S Medium Transport, Cary Blair Formula)
at a concentration of approximately 3 x 104 CFU/mL (1µl inoculum was used to
inoculate the HardyCHROM CRE plates). The results obtained on HardyCHROM
CRE were compared to the expected results and observed for colony
morphology/color at 18 and 24h.
The performance of HardyCHROM CRE for recovery of pink colonies (as indicative
of carbapenem non-susceptible Escherichia coli) versus expected results of is shown
in Table 13. Data presented in the table is identical whether the plate readings were
made at 18 or at 24 hours.

3 There were 10 false negative results from both raw stool and Cary Blair medium because there was no growth
on the HardyCHROM CRE plate for these isolates: 2/10 (20%) of the organisms were Klebsiella variicola.
While these organisms are carbapenem non-susceptible, it is not a claimed species. 4/10 (40%) of the organisms
upon retest were confirmed to have sub populations more susceptible to carbapenems than expected and were
not recovered at 2x LoD, as tested in the contrived study. 4/10 (40%) were retested and confirmed carbapenem
non-susceptible and the reason for failure were unknow.
