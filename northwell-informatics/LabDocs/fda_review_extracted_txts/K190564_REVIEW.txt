D Special Instrument Requirements:
Rightest Blood Glucose Meter GM700S
Rightest Blood Glucose Meter GM700SB
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The two systems in this submission, the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM700S
and the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM700SB, consist of the following
components:
- Rightest Blood Glucose Meter (GM700S or GM700SB)
- Rightest Blood Glucose Test Strips GS700
- Rightest Control Solution GC700 (Level 1, Level 2, Level 4)
Both systems employ the same device technology. The only difference between the Rightest
Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM700S and the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System
GM700SB is the presence of Bluetooth in the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System
GM700SB.
B Principle of Operation:
The Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM700S and Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring
System GM700SB quantitatively measure blood glucose levels using amperometric technology. The
system employs flavin adenine dinucleotide-glucose dehydrogenase (GDH-FAD) enzyme chemistry.
Whole blood applied to a test strip initiates a reaction where electrons are transferred from the blood
to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of
glucose in the sample. The detected current signal is then calculated by the meter and glucose
concentration reading is then displayed on the meter display. The meter is calibrated to display
plasma-equivalent concentration results.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
Unless otherwise noted, the analytical studies detailed below were performed with the Rightest
Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM700SB, which is identical the Rightest Blood Glucose
Monitoring System GM700S with the exception of the presence of Bluetooth. Therefore, the
analytical studies performed with the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM700SB are
representative of the performance for both systems in this 510(k) submission.
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability (within-run precision):
The sponsor performed repeatability (within-day) precision studies using venous whole blood
adjusted to 5 different glucose concentration levels (30 to 50, 51 to 110, 111 to 150, 151 to
250, and 251 to 400 mg/dL). Each glucose concentration level was analyzed in replicates of
10, with 5 test strip lots, and 10 meters, for a total of 500 tests per glucose level. Results are
summarized below:
Glucose n Average Glucose SD CV
Level (mg/dL) (mg/dL) (%)
(mg/dL)
30-50 500 42 3.3 7.8
51-110 500 101 4.1 4.1
111-150 500 131 4.5 3.4
151-250 500 198 4.4 2.2
251-400 500 370 8.8 2.4
Intermediate Precision:
Intermediate (day-to-day) precision was evaluated using 3 levels of glucose control solutions
over 10 days with 5 test strip lots. For each level, on each day, 10 meters were used, with 1
replicate collected per meter for a total of 10 replicates per day for each glucose level.
Results are summarized below:
Glucose n Average Glucose SD CV
Level (mg/dL) (mg/dL) (%)
1 500 51 3.5 6.9
2 500 110 4.5 4.0

2. Linearity:
Linearity was evaluated using fourteen venous whole blood samples with glucose
concentrations of 15.5, 24.0, 56.6, 89.8, 154.5, 201.5, 266.0, 312.5, 356.5, 422.0, 474.5,
512.0, 576.0, and 630.5 mg/dL as measured by the comparator method, YSI 2300. Each
sample was tested with 3 test strip lots. For each lot, 3 measurements with 3 meters were
taken per glucose level. The linear regression results are presented below:
Lot 1: y = 0.9936x – 1.3391; R2=0.9994
Lot 2: y = 0.9771x – 1.4742; R2=0.9998
Lot 3: y = 0.9814x + 0.2001; R2=0.9992
The results of the linearity study support the claimed glucose measurement range of 20-600
mg/dL. If a sample is less than 20 mg/dL or greater than 600 mg/dL an error message is
returned to the user. The error messages were validated using blood glucose samples outside
the measuring range of the device and demonstrated that the error messages function as
intended.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
To assess potential interferences, the sponsor used venous whole blood samples adjusted to
glucose concentrations between 75 and 350 mg/dL. Each sample was divided into a test pool
and a control pool, with the potential interfering substance added to the test pool. The
difference between the test sample and the control sample was calculated using mean of 10
replicates per each of 3 test strip lots. The compounds at the concentrations listed below did
not have significant interference (defined by the sponsor as average bias between spiked and
control sample glucose results within ± 10% for glucose >100 mg/dL and within ± 10 mg/dL
for glucose <100 mg/dL). The highest concentrations at which no significant interference
was observed are presented in the following table:
Substance Highest Concentration tested with no
observed significant interference

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
To assess the performance of the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems in the hands of
the intended users, the sponsor performed a study with 354 lay user participants. The
Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM700SB was used as a representative meter as
it contains all available user features (see “Device Description” for description of the
differences between meters). The users were responsible for obtaining their own capillary
sample and performing a blood glucose test using only the instructions from the product
labeling. A total 6 test strip lots were used in the study. Results were analyzed by comparing
the blood glucose results obtained by the lay users against results obtained with a laboratory-
based comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The glucose concentrations in the samples
ranged from 63.7-488 mg/dL, which includes 24 native samples < 80 mg/dL and 33 samples
> 250 mg/dL as measured by the YSI 2300. The results are summarized below:

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Hematocrit Study:
To evaluate the effect of hematocrit, venous blood samples with hematocrit levels of 10%,
20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, and 70% were tested at six glucose
levels (20-50, 60-80, 135-165, 180-220, 270-330, and 260-440 mg/dL). Each sample was
tested in replicates of 5 test strips per strip lot, with a total of 3 lots of tests strips tested.
Results from the meter were compared to results obtained using a laboratory-based
comparator method (YSI 2300). The evaluation of bias relative to the comparator method
demonstrated acceptable performance to support the claimed hematocrit range of 20-60%.
2. Altitude Study:
To evaluate the effect of altitude, meters were tested at approximately sea level, 3,280, 6,560,
and 10,744 feet above sea level. The evaluation tested 3 levels of glucose (50-75, 80-120,
and 270-330 mg/dL) included 3 test strip lots. Results at each altitude were compared to the
comparator method, YSI 2300. Results demonstrated that altitudes up to 10,744 feet above
sea level have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements.
3. Sample Volume Study:
The sponsor performed a study to support the claimed minimum sample volume. Venous
whole blood samples were tested at 0.60, 0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80, 1.0, 1.25, 2.0 and 3.0 μL at 3
glucose levels (50-75, 80-120, and 270-330 mg/dL) as established by the YSI 2300
comparator method. Each sample was tested in triplicate on three meters using 3 test strip
lots. Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.75 μL. Blood volumes below
0.75 μL resulted in an accurate result or an insufficient sample volume error message.
4. Operating Conditions Study:
The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous blood samples with
glucose samples of approximately 90 and 250 mg/dL. Temperatures ranging from 43°F -
111°F (6-44°C) and relative humidity from 10% to 90% were tested. Meter results were
compared to the YSI 2300 comparator method. Four temperature and humidity combinations
were tested including low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high
temperature/low humidity and high temperature/high humidity. The results support the
claims in the labeling that the system can be used in conditions of 43°F - 111°F (6-44°C)
with relative humidity of 10 to 90%.
5. Flex Studies:
Intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, testing with used test strips, drop/shock testing,
and vibration testing was completed. The testing performed demonstrated that the device is
robust to intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, drop/shock, and vibration, and that an
error message is returned to the user if a used test strip is inserted into the meter.
6. EMC Testing:
The sponsor provided appropriate documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic
testing (EMC) had been performed and that they were compliant.

7. Infection Control Studies:
The two systems in this submission are intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection
efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meters by an outside
commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus
(HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, CaviWipes (EPA Registration # 46781-8). Robustness
studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in
performance or external materials of the meter after 550 cleanings and disinfection cycles
with the CaviWipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 5 years of single-
patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and
disinfection procedures.
8. Test Strip Lot Release Protocol:
The test strip lot release protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
