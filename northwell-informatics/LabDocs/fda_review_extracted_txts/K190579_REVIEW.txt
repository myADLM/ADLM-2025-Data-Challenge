IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
TD-4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the TD-4183 Blood Glucose meter, TD-
4183 Blood Glucose test strips, Owners’ manual, Protective Wallet, Warranty card, Daily Log
Book, One 1.5V AAA alkaline battery, a Quick Start Guide, TD-4183 Blood glucose Control
Solutions, sterile lancets and lancing device.
B Principle of Operation:
TD-4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System measures the amount of glucose in whole blood
quantitative using fresh capillary whole blood from the fingertip. Amperometric technology is
used for the detection of glucose from testing the strip (with whole blood sample) on the meter.
Reagent consisting of GDH-FAD and mediator is deposited onto the reaction cell section of the
test strip with printed electrodes. When a drop of whole blood is applied to the reaction cell on
the test strip, glucose in the blood sample reacts in the presence of GDH-FAD and mediator, and
the reaction yields electrons. Thus, a current signal is produced from the reaction and detected by
the meter. The detected current signal is then calculated by the meter and the resulting glucose
concentration is then displayed on the meter display.

Intermediate Precision:
Intermediate (day to day) precision was performed using 5 levels of glucose control
solutions with mean glucose concentrations of (46.05, 66.86, 126.32, 197.57, and 317.36
mg/dL). Testing was performed for 10 days with 3 test strip lots. For each level, on each
day, 10 meters were used for testing, with 1 replicate collected per meter for a total of 10
replicates per day for each glucose level, for a total of 300 tests per glucose level. Results
are summarized below:
Glucose Mean SD CV
Level 1 46.05 2.014 4.37
Level 2 66.86 2.908 4.35
Level 3 126.32 4.470 3.54
Level 4 197.57 6.954 3.52
Levels 5 317.36 10.767 3.39
2. Linearity:
Linearity testing was evaluated with test strips from 3 lots and 11 mixed pools of venous
whole blood samples with glucose concentrations of 18, 40, 63, 95, 129, 169, 231, 316, 408,
559 and 679 mg/dL as measured by the comparator method, YSI 2300. Each level was
measured in replicate of 15 and the values obtained on TD-4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring
System compared with those obtained from YSI 2300. Linear regresion analysis of the
results yielded the following:
Lot Slope y-intercept R2
1 1.0013 0.6521 0.9973
2 1.0077 0.2259 0.9978
3 1.005 1.5608 0.9976
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 20-650
mg/dL. If a sample is less than 20 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter as LO. If the
result is greater than 650 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter as HI. This low and high
functions were validated and demonstrated to function as intended.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were performed by spiking venous whole blood to achieve 3 glucose
levels (60-80 mg/dL, 120-140 mg/dL, and 240-300 mg/dL). Each of these samples were
divided into a test pool with the potential interferent added and a control sample with no
added interferent. Each sample was measured using 10 meters with 3 lots of the test strips,
for a total of 30 replicates per sample. Results on the candidate meter from the test samples
were compared to results obtained on the candidate meter from the control sample. The
highest tested concentrations at which no significant interference was observed (defined by
the sponsor as ≤ 10% bias) are presented in the following table:

against results obtained with a laboratory-based comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The
glucose concentrations in the samples ranged from 45-390 mg/dL, as measured by the YSI 2300
Results are summarized in the tables below:
For glucose concentrations < 75 mg/dL:
Within ± 5 mg/dL Within ± 10 mg/dL Within ± 15 mg/dL Within ± 20 mg/dL
11/15 (73.3%) 15/15 (100%) 15/15 (100%) 15/15 (100%)

156/350 (44.6%) 287/350 (82.0%) 341/350 (97.4%) 350/350 (100%)
Accuracy at Extreme Glucose Study:
A study to evaluate the performance of TD-4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems in the
extreme lower and upper ends of the claimed range was performed using 50 altered samples with
glucose concentrations below 80 mg/dL, and 50 samples greater than 250 mg/dL. Samples were
altered by spiking or glycolysis in order to obtain the appropriate glucose concentrations.
Samples were tested on TD-4183 Blood Glucose with test strips from 3 lots and compared to the
results obtained on YSI 2300 analyzer. The glucose concentrations in the samples ranged from
23-76 mg/dL on the lower end and 276 -641 mg/dL on the higher end, as measured by the YSI
2300. Results are summarized below:
For glucose concentrations < 80 mg/dL:
Within ± 5 mg/dL Within ± 10 mg/dL Within ± 15 mg/dL Within ± 20 mg/dL
46/50 (92.0%) 50/50 (100%) 50/50 (100%) 50/50 (100%)
For glucose concentrations >250mg/dL:
Within ± 5% Within ± 10% Within ± 15% Within ± 20%
14/50 (24.0%) 31/50 (62.0%) 49/50 (98.0%) 50/50 (100%)
The accuracy performance demonstrated in the lay-user and extreme glucose studies was
determined to be adequate and to not have a significant clinical risk to the users due to the
direction of the bias observed with samples containing high glucose concentrations.
The labeling instructs users to contact their health professional immediately if they obtain lower
than expected glucose results.
Readability:
Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted, and the results demonstrated that the User
Manual and the test strip package insert were written at an 8th grade level or less.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The sponsor includes the following expected glucose values in their labeling:
Time of day Normal plasma glucose range for people without diabetes
Fasting and before meals Less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L)
2 hours after a meal Less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)
Source: American Diabetes Association. Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes-2018
Jan;41(Supplement 1): S1-S2.
F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Hematocrit Study:
To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the TD-4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System,
venous blood samples were adjusted to hematocrit levels of 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%,
45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, and 65%. Each hematocrit level was adjusted to achieve five
concentrations of, (42.0, 79.5, 129.5,224.0, and 384 mg/dL. Each sample was tested using
TD4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System 10 meters with test strips from 3 lots: The
values were compared with the average of 4 glucose measurement obtained from YSI
2300 analyzer. The percent biases relative to the comparator method demonstrated were
acceptable within the claimed hematocrit range of 20 to 65%.
2. Altitude Study:
To evaluate the effect of altitude on the TD4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System, a
study was conducted using venous whole blood samples adjusted with 7 concentration
K190579 - Page 10 of 12

[Table 1 on page 10]
Time of day	Normal plasma glucose range for people without diabetes
Fasting and before meals	Less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L)
2 hours after a meal	Less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)

--- Page 11 ---
levels of glucose ranging from 51-650 mg/dL. Samples were placed under conditions to
simulate 4 different altitude condition from sea level to 4,400 meters (15, 000feet). Each
blood sample was tested using 4 TD4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System with test
strips from 1 lot. The values obtained were compared with the values obtained with the
YSI 2300 analyzer outside of the pressurized chamber. The results demonstrated
acceptable bias to YSI 2300 to support the claim in the labeling that glucose
measurement performance of the TD4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is
maintained at altitudes ranging sea level up to 4,500 meters (15, 000 feet).
3. Operating Conditions Study:
The effect of temperature and relative humidity on the TD4183 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System was evaluated using venous whole blood samples adjusted to
approximately 65, 125, and 320 mg/dL. Testing was conducted under the following
temperature and relative humidity (RH) combinations: 450C(113°F) and 50C(41°F), at
5% to 90% RH each and at 250C(770F) at 60% RH. Four TD4183 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System and 3 lots of test strips were used. Values measured on TD4183
Blood Glucose Monitoring System were compared to results from the comparator YSI
2300. The study results support the operating conditions claim of 46.4°F - 113°F (8-
45°C) with relative humidity of 10% to 90%.
4. Volume Study:
The sponsor performed a study to support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.5
µL for the TD-4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Venous whole blood samples
with three levels of glucose concentrations (61.9, 114.0, 243 mg/dL) were tested at six
sample volumes (0.3,0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 µL) using 3 lots of the test strips and 5
meters. Values obtained were compared to YSI 2300 values. The meter has an error
message displayed if enough blood is not added to the test strip. This feature was
validated and was shown to function as intended. Results support the claimed minimum
sample volume of 0.5 μL
5. Flex Studies:
Intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, testing with used test strips, drop, vibration
and shipping testing was completed. The testing performed demonstrated that the device
is robust to intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, drop/shock, and vibration, and
that an error message is returned to the user if a used test strip is inserted into the meter.
6. Infection Control Studies:
The TD-4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System in this submission is intended for
single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the meter
materials by an outside commercial laboratory, demonstrating complete inactivation of
hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant Micro-Kill+™ Disinfecting Wipes
(EPA Registration Number 59894-10-37549). Robustness studies were also performed by
the sponsor using the TD-4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System demonstrating that
there was no change in the performance of the system or in the external materials of the
meter after 260 cycles of cleaning and disinfection using the chosen disinfectant. The
robustness studies were designed to simulate cleaning and disinfecting over the 5-year
single-patient use life of the meter. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for
the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
