H. Indication(s) for Use:
1. Indications for Use(s):
The BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) is a qualitative multiplexed nucleic
acid-based in vitro diagnostic test intended for use with the BioCode MDx 3000
Instrument. The BioCode GPP is capable of the simultaneous detection and identification
of nucleic acids from multiple bacteria, viruses, and parasites extracted directly from
unpreserved stool samples or stool preserved in Cary-Blair transport medium obtained
from individuals with signs and/or symptoms of gastrointestinal infection. The following
bacteria, parasites, and viruses are identified using the BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen
Panel:
• Campylobacter (C. jejuni/C. coli)
• Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxin A/B (Fresh samples only)
• Salmonella spp.
• Vibrio (V. parahaemolyticus/V. vulnificus/ V. cholerae), including specific
identification of Vibrio parahaemolyticus
• Yersinia enterocolitica
• Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC)
• Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) lt/st
• E. coli O157 serogroup
• Shiga-like toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) stx1/stx2
• Shigella/ Enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC)
• Cryptosporidium spp. (C. parvum/C. hominis)
• Entamoeba histolytica
• Giardia lamblia (also known as G. intestinalis and G. duodenalis)
• Adenovirus F 40/41
• Norovirus GI/GII
• Rotavirus A
The BioCode GPP is indicated as an aid in the diagnosis of specific agents of
gastrointestinal illness and results are meant to be used in conjunction with other clinical,
25

laboratory, and epidemiological data. For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only. For Prescription
Use Only.
Positive results do not rule out co-infection with organisms not included in the BioCode
GPP. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of the disease. Negative results in
the setting of clinical illness compatible with gastroenteritis may be due to infection by
pathogens that are not detected by this test or non-infectious causes such as ulcerative
colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or Crohn’s disease. Concomitant culture is necessary
for organism recovery and further typing of bacterial agents. This device is not intended
to monitor or guide treatment for C. difficile infection.
Due to the small number of positive specimens collected for certain organisms during the
prospective clinical study, performance characteristics for Adenovirus 40/41,
Campylobacter, E. coli O157, Shigella/EIEC, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Giardia
lamblia were established additionally with retrospective clinical specimens. Performance
characteristics for Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, Yersinia enterocolitica and
Vibrio (V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, and V. cholerae) were established primarily
using contrived clinical specimens.
2. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For in vitro diagnostic use only
For prescription use only.
3. Special instrument requirements:
For use with the BioCode MDx 3000 instrument.
I. Device Description:
The BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) is a multiplexed nucleic acid-based test
designed to be used with the BioCode MDx 3000 system. The BioCode MDx 3000 is an
automated system that integrates PCR amplification, target capture, signal generation and
optical detection for multiple gastrointestinal pathogens from a single stool specimen, either
unpreserved or in Cary Blair. Once the PCR plate is set up and sealed, all other operations
are automated on MDx 3000. The BioCode MDx 3000 Gastrointestinal Infection Panel
simultaneously tests for 17 pathogens (see table below) from unpreserved stool specimens or
stool collected in Cary-Blair transport medium. Results from the BioCode Gastrointestinal
Pathogen Panel (GPP) test are available within less than 4 hours.

a. Reproducibility:
A study was performed to assess the Reproducibility of the BioCode GPP using
samples extracted with the MagNA Pure 96. This study was designed to assess
intra-assay (within run), inter-assay (run-to-run), day-to-day and instrument-to-
instrument (operator-to-operator) reproducibility. One lot of reagents was assayed
at Applied BioCode on 3 instruments by 3 operators, 2 runs per day per operator
for 5 days (total of 30 runs). The reproducibility panel consisted of 7 contrived
samples (sample 7 is a negative control) extracted in triplicate and each assayed in
singlet. The samples consisted of combinations of 12 representative targets at 1.5x
LoD (Low) and 3x LoD (Medium). Results from the study are shown in Table 1
below.

c. Specimen Stability:
Please refer to previously FDA-cleared 510(k) Premarket Notifications, k180041 for
Specimen Stability performance. No additional testing was conducted.
d. Limit of detection:
A study was performed to assess the performance of the BioCode GPP on the
BioCode MDx 3000 at the Limit of Detection (LoD) for both unpreserved Stool
and Cary-Blair specimens. In this study the GI Panel was tested with quantified
bacteria, virus or parasite stocks (except norovirus which used clinical samples).
For initial screening, four replicates of each concentration (near LoD for the
predicate) in negative stool and Cary-Blair were extracted on the easyMAG and
MagNA Pure 96 Systems and tested in singlet with the BioCode GPP on the
BioCode MDx 3000 system. The LoD was confirmed by extracting 20 replicates of

For Norovirus GI and GII targets, positive clinical specimens were used, and serial
dilutions (initial 10- fold dilution series followed by finer dilutions) were
performed. Four replicates of each dilution in negative unpreserved stool and Cary-
Blair stool were extracted with the easyMAG and MagNA Pure 96 Systems and
tested with the BioCode GPP on the BioCode MDx 3000 system. The LoD was
confirmed by extracting 20 replicates of each sample type with each extraction
method and testing at or near presumptive LoD. For unpreserved stool, LoD with
the easyMAG extraction was 2-fold and 8.3-fold lower than the MagNA Pure 96
extraction for Norovirus GI and Norovirus GII, respectively. For Cary-Blair stool,
LoD with the easyMAG extraction was less than 2-fold lower than the MagNA
Pure 96 extraction for both Norovirus GI and GII. Results are shown in the tables
below.

3. Clinical studies:
A clinical investigational study was performed in which a total of 466 leftover, de-
identified archived specimens (275 frozen unpreserved and 191 inoculated Cary-Blair)
that were previously characterized as positive from the BioCode Gastrointestinal
Pathogen Panel (K180041) clinical study were collected. Fifty-three (53) freshly
collected leftover samples were used for C. difficile testing. In addition, a total of 120
samples were contrived and tested to determine the performance characteristics for
Entamoeba histolytica, Yersinia enterocolitica and Vibrio (V. parahaemolyticus, V.
vulnificus, and V. cholerae). Specimens were extracted using the MagNA Pure 96 and the
easyMAG and tested with the BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) on the
MDx 3000 system.

PPA was calculated as TP / (TP + FN). TP = true positive or positive by both the
EasyMAG and the MagNA Pure 96; FN = false negative or negative by the MagNA Pure
96 only. NPA was calculated as TN/(TN + FP). TN = true negative or negative by the
EasyMAG and the MagNA Pure 96; FP = false positive or positive by the MagNA Pure
96 only. The exact binomial two-sided 95% confidence interval was calculated. The
results stratified by sample type and storage method are presented in the Table below.

2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes
3. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identity is provided by barcode magnetic beads.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
After extraction with the easyMAG or MagNA Pure 96 system and loading samples
into a 96well formatted plate, the BioCode MDx 3000 processes all RT-PCR steps
automatically.
5. Calibration:
Optical calibration of the MDx 3000 is performed twice a year by Applied BioCode. No
calibration kit is available.
6. Quality Control:
Each laboratory should establish its own Quality Control ranges and frequency of QC
testing based on applicable local laws, regulations and good laboratory practices. The
BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) uses an internal control
(bacteriophage MS2) which is added to each sample during pre- treatment. The
internal control monitors the efficiency of the extraction, reverse transcription,
amplification and detection stages of the assay. Positive results may be reported in the
absence of RNA IC detection. The BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP)
software will suppress negative results for any wells with invalid RNA IC results.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered in the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not applicable.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is sufficient to support a substantial
equivalence decision for the BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP).
