The BD MAX Check-Points CPO Assay is intended as an aid to infection control in the
detection of carbapenem-non-susceptible bacteria that colonize patients in healthcare
settings. The BD MAX Check-Points CPO Assay is not intended to guide or monitor
treatment for carbapenem-non-susceptible bacterial infections. A negative BD MAX
Check-Points CPO Assay result does not preclude the presence of other resistance
mechanisms.
Testing is performed on rectal swabs from patients at risk for intestinal colonisation with
carbapenem non-susceptible bacteria. This test is intended for use in conjunction with
clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and epidemiological information. Results of
this test should not be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions.
Concomitant cultures are necessary to recover organisms for epidemiological typing,
antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and for further confirmatory bacterial identification.

4. Special instrument requirements:
The BD MAX Check-Points CPO Assay uses PCR technology on the BD MAX System,
which extracts, amplifies, and detects the target DNA.
I. Device Description:
The BD MAX Check-Points CPO Assay detects the presence of carbapenemase genes in
Gram-negative bacteria. Briefly, rectal swab specimens are collected from patients using an
ESwab collection and transport system. The ESwab tube is vortexed and a 50 μl aliquot is
transferred to the BD MAX Check-Points CPO Sample Buffer Tube (SBT) using a pipette
with a disposable filter tip. The SBT is closed with a septum cap and vortexed. Once the
worklist is generated and the clinical specimen is loaded on the BD MAX System, along with
a BD MAX Check-Points CPO Reagent Strip and BD MAX PCR Cartridge, the run is started
with no further operator intervention. The BD MAX System automates sample preparation,
including target organism lysis, DNA extraction and concentration, reagent rehydration,
target nucleic acid sequence amplification, and detection using real-time PCR. The
interpretation of the signal is performed automatically by the BD MAX System. The assay
also includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC) that is provided in the Extraction Tube and
subjected to extraction, concentration, and amplification steps. The SPC monitors for the
presence of potential inhibitory substances as well as system or reagent failures.

L. Test Principle:
The BD MAX System automates sample preparation, including target organism lysis, DNA
extraction and concentration, reagent rehydration, target nucleic acid sequence amplification,
and detection using real-time PCR. Following enzymatic cell lysis of the sample at an
elevated temperature, the released nucleic acids are captured on magnetic affinity beads. The
beads, with the bound nucleic acids, are washed and the nucleic acids are eluted. Eluted DNA
is then neutralized and transferred to the Master Mix Tube to rehydrate the PCR reagents.
After rehydration, the BD MAX System dispenses a fixed volume of PCR-ready solution into
the BD MAX PCR Cartridge. The amplified DNA targets are detected using hydrolysis

(TaqMan) probes, labeled at one end with a fluorescent reporter dye (fluorophore) and at the
other end with a quencher moiety. Probes labeled with different fluorophores are used to
detect amplicons for the carbapenemase gene targets (KPC, VIM, OXA-48, NDM, IMP) and
the SPC by the BD MAX System. The VIM and IMP genes are combined in one optical
channel of the BD MAX system; all other genes have a separate optical channel. When the
probes are in their native state, the fluorescence of the fluorophore is quenched due to its
proximity to the quencher. However, in the presence of target DNA, the probes hybridize to
their complementary sequences and are hydrolyzed by the DNA polymerase as it synthesizes
the nascent strand along the DNA template. As a result, the fluorophores are separated from
the quencher molecules and fluorescence is emitted. The BD MAX System monitors these
signals at each cycle and interprets the data at the end of the program to report the final
results.
Interpretation of Results
Results are available on the <Results> tab in the <Results> window on the BD MAX
System monitor. The BD MAX System software automatically interprets test results. Results
are reported for each analyte and the SPC. A test result may be called NEG (Negative), POS
(Positive) or UNR (Unresolved) based on the amplification status of the target and of the
SPC. IND (Indeterminate), or INC (Incomplete) results are due to BD MAX System failures.
An interpretation table for test results is shown in Table 1.

all five gene targets—negative rectal swab spiked with non-target bacterial cells (NC)
and a negative rectal swab (Blank). Each organism was spiked into negative rectal
swab matrix at low positive (~1.5x LoD) and moderate positive levels (3x LoD). To
measure site-to-site reproducibility, the 12-member panel was tested in duplicates
each day at three sites over a five-day testing period with two operators per site. Inter-
lot variation was analyzed by testing five different targets (with two concentrations
per strain) at one site by two operators using three different lots across 5 days. The
results of the Site-to-Site Reproducibility Study and Precision Study are summarized
in Table 2 and Table 3 below. Table 4 shows the mean Ct values and % CV results

Sample Processing Control (SPC)
The BD MAX Check-Points CPO Assay also includes an SPC that is provided in the
Extraction Tube and subjected to extraction, concentration, and amplification steps.
The SPC is a synthetic target DNA sequence that monitors for the presence of
potential inhibitory substances as well as system or reagent failures. The SPC
monitors the following:
• The effectiveness of DNA capture, washing, elution and neutralization during
the sample processing steps.
• The integrity of the PCR reagents and the presence of inhibitory substances
during the amplification and detection steps.
• The integrity of the system as a whole, including the pipetting steps, PCR
thermocycling, and signal detection.
In the absence of SPC amplification, non-positive results from a given Master Mix
are identified as UNR.
Stability after Rectal Swabs Resuspended in Sample Buffer Tube (SBT)
The purpose of this study was to determine the stability of samples in SBT to support
repeat testing from the same sample. Two positive specimen pools with four
organisms [Positive Set #1:KPC, VIM, OXA-48, NDM and Positive Set #2: KPC,
IMP, OXA-48, NDM] were spiked into pooled negative rectal swab matrix from
healthy human donors at 3x LoD and analyzed in replicates of 5 after sample storage
in SBT at 2–8 °C for 0, 8, 24, and 48 hrs and at 20–25 °C for 0, 24 and 48 hrs in
accordance with the IFU. Due to performance errors (run-related issue), one run was
rejected and repeated at room temperature for the 24 hrs time point. Only two tests
resulted in UNR [(1) at t=0, 25°C and (1) at t=48 hrs, 2-8°C)] but were repeated with
valid results. External positive and negative controls were included with each run. It
was concluded that acceptance criteria were met for each analyte/specimen at all time
points analyzed. The sample stability in SBT was set at 48 hrs at 2-25°C.

d. Detection limit:
A study was conducted to determine the Limit of Detection (LoD) of the BD MAX
Check-Points CPO Assay for organisms harboring the bla , bla , bla , bla
KPC NDM VIM OXA-
, and bla gene sequence targets seeded into rectal swab background matrix. The
48 IMP
LoD was defined as the lowest concentration (reported as cells/ml in SBT) of target at
which 10/10 replicates gave a positive test result. Pre-screened negative rectal swab
background matrix was used to prepare samples. Two strains harboring each assay
target were tested. Bacterial cell suspensions of each strain were prepared from
culture and quantified prior to inclusion in this study. Serial dilutions in negative
rectal matrix were prepared for all strains at test concentrations expected to comprise
the LoD for each carbapenemase target gene. To estimate the LoD, replicates of 10
for each test concentration were evaluated using 3 BD MAX instruments and 3 lots of
reagents and consumables. The LoD (Table 6) was confirmed by testing 20 replicates
for each strain at the estimated LoD. External positive and negative controls were
included with each run.
In the LoD Study, 0.7% samples (9/1309) provided UNR or IND results with the BD
MAX Check-Points CPO Assay (5 UNR, 4 IND). All samples were repeated
yielding valid test results. (4) external positive controls gave negative results, which
was linked to a sample preparation issue. Retesting with fresh preparations of these
controls yielded the expected result.

Analytical Reactivity
An Inclusivity Study was conducted to test reactivity of the BD MAX Check-Points CPO
Assay with 93 well-characterized bacterial isolates. The panel consisted of bacterial
isolates that harbor the following molecular resistance marker groups: (17) bla
KPC
isolates, (17) bla isolates, (17) bla isolates, (20) bla type isolates, (18) bla
NDM VIM OXA-48 IMP
isolates, and (4) strains containing two carbapenemase gene targets. Strains were seeded
at 3x LoD and tested in pooled negative rectal swab matrix. For a list of strains tested
during the Analytical Reactivity Study, please refer to Table 7 below.
The BD MAX Check-Points CPO Assay correctly identified 90 of the 93 strains tested
at/near 3x LoD. Three strains—an Enterobacter cloacae with IMP-34, a Pseudomonas

e. Analytical specificity:
The analytical specificity of the BD MAX Check-Points CPO Assay was evaluated
with a panel of 26 phylogenetically related species and other organisms likely to be
found in rectal swab specimens. This panel included well-characterized bacteria
confirmed as having:
• No carbapenemase gene
• Different carbapenemase gene (not target of the assay)
• Different β-lactamase gene or
• Different antibiotic resistance determinant
Panel members were prepared by seeding bacterial cells into negative rectal swab
matrix at a concentration >106 CFU/ml in triplicate before testing with the BD MAX
Check-Points CPO Assay. Please refer to Table 9 below for the Analytical
Specificity Study panel.

Of the 26 potentially cross-reactive organisms tested, including organisms exhibiting
antibiotic resistance mechanisms other than the presence of KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP
and OXA-48 genes, none were detected with the BD MAX Check-Points CPO Assay.
Of the 78 tests in rectal swab matrix, two (2.6%) tests yielded an UNR result. Both
UNR were successfully repeated and were reported as negative for all targets as
expected. All external positive and negative controls were correctly reported as
expected.
A separate study was conducted to assess whether a high level of an assay target
organism (>106 CFU/ml) was capable of generating false positive (FP) signals using
the BD MAX Check-Points CPO Assay. It was observed that the BD MAX Check-
Points Assay did not produce FP results from single target specimens tested at a high
concentration.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off was defined by a 2-step process. Initially, an Assay Definition File
(ADF) version was designed with software parameters assigned such that the defined
cut-off gave optimal analytical sensitivity, i.e. increase of PCR cycle numbers did not
further increase the analytical sensitivity or Limit of Detection (LoD). This was
performed during development and used various dilutions of bacterial strains
containing assay target genes spiked into negative rectal swab specimens. Secondly,
the cut-off was assessed in a pre-clinical study comparing the performance of BD
MAX Check-Points CPO Assay against ChromID followed by genotyping of each
isolate. The study used 338 left-over specimens from routine surveillance at both a
high and a low prevalence site in Europe. The final cut-offs for each target were then
assigned for each target.
g. Interference Study
A study was conducted to assess the inhibitory effects of substances potentially
encountered in rectal swab specimens on the performance of the BD MAX Check-
Points CPO Assay. Twenty-nine biological and chemical substances were evaluated

at “worst case scenario” concentrations. Six replicates of the negative specimen and
three replicates of two positive specimen sets were analyzed with/without the
potentially interfering substances. All substances were evaluated at a test
concentration of 0.25% w/v (2.5 mg/ml) in negative rectal swab matrix. External
negative and external positive controls were included with each run. Positive sample
sets were prepared from a mix of four carbapenemase-producing organisms harboring
KPC, NDM, VIM (or IMP) and OXA-48 gene sequences seeded into pooled negative
rectal swab matrix to give concentrations that were 2-3x LoD (Table 10). The list of
potentially interfering substances tested is shown in Table 11.

Results showed that assay targets were detected in the presence of all potentially
interfering substances. Of the 432 tests, (7) tests provided non-reportable results (2
UNR and 5 IND). All samples yielding non-reportable results were successfully
repeated with valid results (no interference observed). External controls gave the
expected test result.

To evaluate the potential competitive inhibitory effect of multiple carbapenemase-
producing organisms on the performance of the BD MAX Check-Points CPO Assay
in rectal swab specimens, a study was performed by testing various combinations of
carbapenemase-producing organisms seeded at high and low concentrations into
natural matrix. High concentrations of organisms corresponded to ~1x106 CFU/ml,
and low concentrations corresponded to 2x LoD. Table 12 reports the number of
target replicates that were detected in the competitive interference study with rectal
swab matrix. 7/8 agreement with the expected assay results for target organisms at
low concentration in the presence of other target organism(s) at high concentration
was set as the acceptance criteria. All sample combinations met acceptance criteria.

h. Carry-Over
The purpose of the Carry-Over Study was to determine the potential for carry-over
contamination when processing multiple high positive and negative samples. Two
positive sample sets with a high load of 4 targets (>106 CFU/ml) were analyzed in
replicates of 84 with adjoining negative samples (168 total negative replicates) using 3
BD MAX instruments in accordance with the IFU. Positive sample sets were identical
to those prepared for the Interference Study. Negative rectal swab matrix was obtained
by pooling ESwab Amies liquid from the rectal swabs (ESwab) obtained from human
healthy donors.
A total of 14 BD MAX runs were conducted. All samples yielded the expected
results—82 Positive Set #1, 84 Positive Set #2, and 166 negative samples. In the
study, two positive samples yielded IND results due to what later was identified as an
instrument error. These two positive samples and their adjoining 2 negative samples
were later excluded. In summary, the study showed no carry-over contamination from
high positive to negative samples.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
In a multi-center study, five geographically diverse sites were selected (three in the
United States and two in Europe) to evaluate the BD MAX Check-Points CPO Assay.
Performance characteristics of BD MAX Check-Points CPO Assay were determined
with leftover material (rectal swab; ESwab in Transport Medium) from normal
standard of care laboratory testing of patients eligible for CPO screening according to
institutional policies or meeting the recommendation by the CDC for CPO
surveillance cultures. Specimens were collected using ESwab, transported to the
laboratory, vortexed, and used for normal standard of care laboratory testing. Aliquots
of the same Transport Medium were de-identified and used for analysis by the BD
MAX Check-Points CPO Assay according the instructions in the package insert and
by the Composite Reference Method. The positive percent agreement (PPA) and
negative percent agreement (NPA) of the BD MAX Check-Points CPO Assay were
evaluated relative to the Composite Reference Method (consisting of Reference
Culture + PCR and Sequencing of the amplification product).
For the Composite Reference Method, testing of rectal ESwab medium was
conducted with three (3) different culture media in order to optimize recovery of
Gram-negative organisms with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems:
• MacConkey broth enrichment (11 ml broth with a 10 μg Meropenem disc)
followed by plating onto MacConkey agar with a Meropenem disc
• ChromID Carba agar
• ChromID OXA-48 agar
A 50 μl aliquot of the transport medium was used to inoculate all culture media.
chromID Carba and chromID OXA-48 plates were incubated for 18– 24 hours at 35–
37°C and inspected for the presence of bacterial colonies. If no colonies were found,
the test result was recorded as negative. If colonies were found, the color was noted
and each morphotype was subcultured onto a blood agar plate and incubated
overnight at 35–37°C. MacConkey broth tubes (with a meropenem disc added) were
incubated for 16 to 18 hours at 35–37°C, after which 100 μl of the MacConkey broth
was spread onto a MacConkey agar plate. A 10 µg Meropenem disc was then placed
20

--- Page 21 ---
in the center of the MacConkey plate, and the plate was incubated for 16 to 18 hours
at 35–37°C. The day after, the MacConkey plates with the Meropenem disc were
inspected and the zone diameter around the Meropenem disc, if present, was
measured. If no growth was detected or the zone of clearing was > 28 mm, the test
result was recorded as negative. If growth was found within a 28 mm zone including
the disc, then bacteria were subcultured onto a blood agar plate.
Species identification was performed for isolates that were subcultured overnight on
blood agar using a MALDI Biotyper or alternative routine methods at the clinical
sites. Species ID and susceptibility towards carbapenems was assessed for bacterial
isolates from any of these 3 media. For each Gram-negative bacterial isolate, the
Meropenem, Imipenem and Ertapenem susceptibility was assessed using CLSI
reference method M02-A12, which were interpreted the next day using interpretation
criteria from CLSI M100-S27. Isolates that were susceptible for all carbapenems were
scored as negative. Intermediate or resistant isolates (only Enterobacteriaceae,
Acinetobacter or Pseudomonas aeruginosa) assigned to these categories using the
criteria from the CLSI M100-S27 document were further tested for the presence of
the BD MAX CPO target genes (KPC, VIM, IMP, OXA-48 and NDM) by reference
PCR and bidirectional sequencing. Specimens from which Gram-negative isolates
were cultured, but for which no susceptibility criteria were available, e.g.
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas putida, Aeromonas veronii, were
excluded for further analysis by the Composite Reference Method along with the BD
MAX Check-Points CPO Assay test result for those samples. For validation of the
Reference Culture methodology applied in the Clinical Study, strains with known
susceptibility status (susceptible, intermediate or resistant) to Meropenem,
Ertapenem, and Imipenem using CLSI standard test methods (M02-A12, CLSI M100-
S27) and/or known resistance genes were spiked into unique rectal swabs in order to
test for the recovery of the organisms.
A total of 1576 prospective rectal ESwab specimens were initially enrolled in the
Clinical Study. Of the 1576 samples collected, there were eighteen (18) UNR [1.1%],
six (6) INC [0.4%], and four (4) IND [0.3%] results documented with the BD MAX
Check-Points CPO Assay, where 17 of the 28 non-reportable samples were re-tested.
Fifteen of the seventeen samples yielded valid results after re-testing. A total of (103)
samples were excluded because:
• (8) specimens were not added to SBT at the appropriate time
• (11) specimens were in SBT > the allotted time
• (16) specimens were associated with an External Control result that was not
repeated according to the protocol
• (27) specimens were recovered with a Gram-negative species ID other than
Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (no criteria for
carbapenem non-susceptibility)
• (21) specimens showed environmental contamination
• (7) specimens included incomplete documentation
• (11) non-reportables samples (UNR and IND) did not undergo repeat testing
21

--- Page 22 ---
as required
• (2) specimens generated UNR even after repeat testing
In the final analysis, 1473 ESwab specimens were included for the Prospective Study.
Performance of the BD MAX Check-Points CPO Assay was assessed separately for
each type of resistance marker target and compared to the Composite Reference
Method result. Study results of the BD MAX Check-Points CPO Assay compared to
the Composite Reference Method are shown in Table 13 stratified by individual target
for the Prospective and Contrived Studies.

* A single NS organism harboring IMP-13 variant was identified as Negative by the BD MAX Check-Points CPO Assay;
Since IMP-13 is not claimed for detection of the IMP variant, this sample was treated as TN.
A total of 136 target and 30 non-target strains were used for the Contrived Study.
Clinical isolates and reference strains (National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC)
from an in-house collection at Check-Point (CP) were selected to represent a variety
of clinical species, carbapenem susceptibilities, species with target variants, strains
with carbapenemase genes other than the target genes, and strains with different
resistance mechanisms. Each strain was spiked into unique negative rectal swab at
approximately 1-2x LoD preparation for target specimens and 1/20 x OD 0.1 for
600
non-target specimens. Target specimens yielding a negative result by the BD MAX
Check-Points CPO Assay were re-tested at 3x LoD and 10x LoD. The following
