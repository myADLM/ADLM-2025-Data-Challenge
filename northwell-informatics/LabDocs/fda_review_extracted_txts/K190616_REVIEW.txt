2. The ability of the AST card to detect non-susceptible strains with the following
combination(s) is unknown because an insufficient number of non-susceptible
strains were available at the time of comparative testing:
Dalbavancin: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus
faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible)
4. Special instrument requirements:
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems, VITEK 2 Systems (PC) version 10.1 or higher
I. Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each
VITEK 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium
is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials
combined with the nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized
concentration with 0.45% to 0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial
medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System will automatically dilute the bacterial
suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then the VITEK 2 will fill, seal
and place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling,
sealing, and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the
card over a defined period of time. The analysis program determines when a well
demonstrates growth based on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data
is used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the anti-
microbial agent. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains
the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on
the card.
VITEK 2 AST-GP Dalbavancin has the following concentrations in the card: 0.0625, 0.125,
0.25, and 0.5 µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL). The
Dalbavancin MIC result range for the VITEK 2 is ≤0.015 – ≥1 µg/mL for Staphylococcus
aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae. For all species, the VITEK 2
Page 3 of 13

system is capable of reporting the following MIC results: ≤0.015, 0.03, 0.06, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5
and ≥1 µg/mL for the AST-GP Dalbavancin test.

L. Test Principle:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection
using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems uses
visible light to directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells.
Transmittance optics is based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth
has begun. Every 15 minutes throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based
on the VITEK 2 card), light transmittance readings of each well measures organism growth
by the amount of light that is prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of
the incubation period, the MIC values and their associated interpretive category results for
each antimicrobial on the test card are displayed in an automatically generated report.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study for the VITEK 2 AST-GP card with Dalbavancin was
conducted at three external clinical sites using a panel of ten isolates of Gram-
positive microorganisms consistent with the indications for use. Testing was
performed on three separate days and in triplicate for a total of 270 data points.
The isolates tested in the reproducibility study included five Staphylococcus
aureus and five Enterococcus faecalis isolates. Inocula were prepared using both
the auto-dilution and manual dilution methods for testing in the VITEK 2 System.
In addition, inocula were prepared by the manual dilution method only for use
with the VITEK 2 Compact. The mode MIC value was determined and the
reproducibility was calculated based on MIC values that fell within +/- one
doubling dilution from the mode MIC value. The data was analyzed taking into
consideration best case and worst case scenarios as described in the Class II
Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST)
Systems. All reproducibility performance results were considered acceptable;
however, 7% of the total isolates were off-scale. The reproducibility performance
of the on-scale isolates is presented in Table 2.

--- Page 9 ---
The VITEK 2 AST cards were inoculated with test organisms using the auto-dilution
method (VITEK 2 System) and using the manual dilution method (VITEK 2 System
and VITEK 2 Compact). All test inocula used for the VITEK 2 AST cards and the
reference method were standardized using the DensiCHEK Plus instrument.
A total of 593 clinical isolates were evaluated. The majority of isolates were recently
isolated from clinical specimen (559 isolates, 94.3%). The remainder were stock
isolates (34 isolates, 5.7%).
A total of 75 challenge organisms (41 Staphylococcus aureus, 22 Enterococcus
faecalis, 12 Streptococcus agalactiae) were evaluated at one site. The challenge set
was tested with the auto-dilution and manual dilution options of the VITEK 2 System
and with the manual dilution method on the VITEK 2 Compact System.
The combined data set of clinical and challenge isolates included 668 AST results
(346 Staphylococcus aureus, 260 Enterococcus faecalis, 62 Streptococcus
agalactiae). A total of 4 (0.6%) non-susceptible isolates were tested among the
clinical (n=593) and challenge (n=75) isolates.
The overall performance using the auto-dilution method of the VITEK 2 System
demonstrated an EA of 98.1% and a CA of 100%. There were no very major errors
and no major errors. With Staphylococcus aureus isolates, performance was
acceptable with an EA of 97.7% and a CA of 100%. With Enterococcus faecalis
isolates, performance was acceptable with an EA of 99.6% and a CA of 100%. With
Streptococcus agalactiae isolates, performance was acceptable with an EA of 93.5%
and a CA of 100%. The performance based on combined clinical and challenge data
was acceptable. The overall performance is shown in Table 4.

MIC Trends:
An analysis of trending was conducted using the combined clinical and challenge data
for each organism group. This trending calculation considers MIC values that are
determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or higher compared to the
reference method regardless of whether the device MIC values are on-scale. Results
that are not clearly determined to be at least one dilution lower, at least one dilution
higher or in exact agreement with the CLSI reference method are not considered in
the trending analysis.
Trending results were stratified by species to assess species-related trends. Species for
which the difference between the percentage of isolates with higher or lower readings
was ≥30 with a statistically significant confidence interval were considered to show
evidence of trending. There was no trending noted for E. faecalis, S. aureus and S.
agalactiae.

N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the VITEK 2 Gram-positive Susceptibility Card when revised
breakpoints for dalbavancin are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change
protocol included with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, bioMérieux will
update the dalbavancin device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated
performance section after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new
breakpoints, and (3) any new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
