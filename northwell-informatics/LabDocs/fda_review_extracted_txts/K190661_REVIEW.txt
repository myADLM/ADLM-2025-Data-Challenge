processed from blood (2 x 2.5ml in PAxGene Blood DNA collection tubes). DNA is
quantified and concentrated if necessary. The amount of DNA required to perform the
test is 50-300ng. Genomic DNA is stored at –20°C until assay initiation. DNA shearing is
conducted per protocol and a quality control check is reviewed. Average fragment size
for sheared DNA should be approximately ~200bp for tissue and approximately ~300bp
for blood. Sheared DNA proceeds directly to library preparation.
2. Library Preparation
Sequence libraries are prepared using KAPA Biosystems Library Preparation Reagents
by first producing blunt-ended, 5’-phosphorylated fragments. To the 3’ ends of the
dsDNA library fragments, dAMP is added (A-tailing). Next, dsDNA adapters with
3’dTMP is ligated to the A-tailed library fragments. Library fragments with appropriate
adapter sequences are amplified via ligation-mediated pre-capture PCR. A quality control
review on the amplified DNA libraries is performed: Samples should be a smear with
average fragment peak size for tissue as approximately ~200bp and average blood peak is
approximately ~300bp with a fluorescence above 20. The concentration should be10-
300ng/μL to ensure adequate hybridization for capture.
3. Hybrid Capture
Library capture is conducted using IDT Capture reagents. Sequencing libraries are
hybridized to the vendor oligo pool. Capture beads are used to pull down the complex of
capture oligos and genomic DNA fragments. Unbound fragments are washed away. The
enriched fragment pool is amplified by ligation mediated-PCR (LM-PCR). The success
of the enrichment is measured as a quality control step: Samples should be a smear with
an average peak fragment size for tissue at approximately ~200bp and an average peak
fragment size for blood at approximately ~300bp with a fluorescence above 20. The
concentration of the amplified DNA library should be 1-45ng/μL; the LM-PCR yield
should be ≥ 25ng. Reactions can be stored at 4°C until ready for purification, up to 72
hours.
4. Sequencing and Data Analysis
Sequencing is conducted using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing instruments and
reagents along with PhiX Control v3. The sequencing process uses multiple quality
checks.
a. Data Management System (DMS): Automated sample tracking and archival of run-
associated metadata (barcode, samples accession number, requisition number, source
(class), and specimen type) is conducted with the following key functions: Tracking
sample status through various stages of data analysis; tracking iterations of analysis
applied to a given sample; recording versions of databases and algorithms used in
analysis; archival of selected pipeline output files (FASTQ, BAM, VCF) and
sequencing run statistics (e.g. yield, error rate, unassigned read indices).
b. Demultiplexing and FASTQ Generation: The analysis pipeline uses software
provided by Illumina. Multiple pairs of FASTQ files are generated per sample
corresponding to full length forward and reverse reads. Demultiplexing quality
3

--- Page 4 ---
control includes quality metrics for per-base sequence quality, sequence content, GC
content and sequence length distribution, and relative percentages of unmatched
indices.
c. Indexing QC Check: The potential for index or sample contamination is managed
during mutation calling and determined by looking for the presence of common
polymorphisms in tumor samples that are different from the polymorphisms present
in the matched-normal equivalent sample.
d. Read Alignment and BAM Generation: Spurious adapter sequences are trimmed
prior to read alignment. Reads are aligned in paired-end mode to the Genome
Reference Consortium Human Build 37 (GRCh37, aka hg19) version of the human
genome. Aligned reads are written to a Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) file, which
is then converted into Binary Alignment Map (BAM) format. PCR duplicates are
flagged and excluded. Each base within a read is assigned a base quality score by the
sequencing software, which reflects the probability an error was made with the base
call. To account for systemic biases that may not accurately reflect the actual error
probabilities observed empirically, the analysis pipeline uses another tool to adjust the
reported quality scores based on the selected covariates. Control for low quality bases
during identification as part of variant calling results in low quality reads being
excluded.
e. Sample QC Checks: The baits used for hybridization capture include probes
targeting >200,000 regions throughout the genome containing common single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The unique combination of SNPs specific to a
given sample serves as a ‘fingerprint’ for the identity of the corresponding patient,
and serves to identify potential sample mix-ups and contamination between samples
and barcodes. QC checks involve the use of fingerprint’ SNPs.
i. Sample mix-up check: The analysis pipeline computes the % Similarity between the
normal and tumor samples associated with the same patient, where % Similarity is
defined as the percentage “compatible” genotypes shared by the two samples among
a random set of up to 1,000 dbSNP loci with sufficient coverage (coverage depth ≥60
in both tumor and normal samples). If the % Similarity falls below 97%, the tumor
and normal samples are flagged for review as potentially mismatched samples.
ii. Sample contamination checks: The percentage of somatic variants that overlap
common dbSNP loci (where “common” is defined as a polymorphism with a global
population allele frequency > 5%) is calculated (% Common). If % Common exceeds
5% of the total somatic variant burden, the sample is flagged for review as potentially
contaminated with unrelated DNA.
iii. Check for presence of tumor in normal: Tumor contamination in matched-normal
samples is assessed by calculating the number and percentage of somatic calls that
meet the following criteria:
1. Two (2) or more reads supporting mutant allele in matched-normal, and
2. Mutant allele fraction > 5% in matched-normal sample.
4

--- Page 5 ---
f. Mutation calling – SNVs and Indels: The analysis pipeline identifies two classes of
mutations: (1) single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and (2) indels. Paired sample mutation
calling is performed on tumor samples and their respective matched normal controls.
Filtering is performed to remove low quality sequence data, sources of sequencing
artifacts, and germline results. Summary of mutation filtering scheme is provided in
Figure 1.
Figure 1: Summary of the mutation filtering scheme for Omics Core
5

--- Page 6 ---
i. Analysis of positive and negative controls: Data from controls is used to confirm
lack of contamination as well as analytical sensitivity.
ii. Filters on sample coverage: Sequencing coverage of ≥ 500X is required for tumor
samples and sequencing coverage of ≥ 150X is required for normal samples.
iii. Filtering for high confidence mutations: Raw SNV and indel calls are subjected to a
series of filtering steps to ensure only high-confidence calls are reported. These
parameters include (1) evidence of it being a somatic mutations (i.e., log odds of
tumor data at site explained by presence of somatic mutation vs. sequencing error >
6.3 (>4.3 for indels) in tumor, log odds of normal data at site explained by
sequencing error vs. presence of somatic mutation > 2.2, (2) reference set of common
artifacts found in 3 or more normal samples from a panel of >4,000 normal blood
samples, (3) technical characteristics that use coverage depth (DP), number of mutant
reads (AD), mutation allele fraction (AF), strand bias (SB), characteristics of reads
supporting mutant allele (mismatch quality sum, nearby indels, mapping quality), and
characteristics of region where mutant is located (adjacent simple tandem repeat,
overlapping dbSNP markers). Omics Core does not report mutations below 2%.
g. Mutation Annotation Predicted functional effect and clinical interpretation for each
mutation is curated by automated software using information from several databases.
5. Controls
a. Matched Normal Control: Genomic DNA is extracted from patient-matched normal
whole blood. NantHealth requires a normal sample to perform the test.
b. Positive Control: The positive control sample (commercial vendor qualified by
NantHealth) contains different confirmed mutations, representing a range of mutation
allele frequencies. Results are compared against a negative control as an unmatched
normal. Data generated from the positive control sample is analyzed using the
pipeline, and frequencies of the detected mutations are reviewed to determine if (1)
the known mutations are among those called, and (2) the observed frequencies for the
known mutations match their expected values within 10%. The percentage agreement
for scenarios (1) and (2) is expected to be 95% or higher.
c. Negative Control: The negative control sample is a purchased reference sample,
verified to be free of tumor contamination and germline copy number mutations in a
majority of genes. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) present in the negative
control have been identified in prior analyses. The observed genotypes are compared
against the expected genotypes for 420 common SNPs, and the degree of
concordance is measured by identifying the percentage of SNPs that are identical or
compatible. The percentage agreement between expected and observed mutations is
expected to be 97% or higher.
d. PCR Reagent Control – No Template Control (NTC): The NTC control should
have a quantification measurement of < 1.0ng/μL. If this is not the case, the
measurement may be high due to the presence of unincorporated primers carried over
6

--- Page 7 ---
from the LM-PCR reaction and not an indication of possible contamination amplified
sample libraries. If the quantification measurement is ≥ 1ng/μL and determined not to
be due to dimers, the sample will be flagged and reviewed to determine if a re-run or
sequencing run is necessary.
6. Result Reporting:
• Oncopanel results are reported out under one of the two categories: “Cancer
Mutations with Evidence of Clinical Significance” or “Cancer Mutations with
Potential Clinical Significance”. The two categories are based on the supporting
level of clinical evidence. Refer to the Clinical Performance Section for more
information.
• Results are reported for point mutations and small insertions and deletions in
protein-coding exons of the 468 gene panel. Refer to Appendix 1a for a list of
genes
• The Omics Core does not report mutations in 203 exons due to low sequence
coverage, poor mapping quality, or high GC content. Refer to Appendix 1b for a
list of excluded exons.
• Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) Reporting: TMB is measured by counting the
total number of somatic, non-synonymous exonic variants per the total number of
genes (19,396) surveyed by the Omics Core assay. TMB is measured as mutations
per megabase (mut/Mb), reported as a rate and included in the category for
“Cancer Mutations with Potential Clinical Significance”

L. Test Principle:
The NantHealth Omics Core assay is a custom targeted sequencing platform, utilizing
solution-phase exon capture and sequencing, to detect somatic alterations (point mutations,
small insertions and deletions), and overall tumor mutation burden in tumor specimens. The
NantHealth Omics Core assay involves hybridization capture and deep sequencing of 468
cancer-associated genes for reporting of variants. TMB is reported on the basis of SNVs in
the protein-coding exons of 19,396 genes including all known oncogenes and tumor
suppressors. Omics Core reports on 468 genes from within the larger panel, reporting
cancer mutations with evidence of clinical significance and cancer mutations with potential
for clinical significance.The assay is not cleared for whole exome reporting of individual
variants outside of the 468 genes. DNA probes are synthesized by a secondary manufacturer
and are biotinylated to enable sequence enrichment through capture by streptavidin-
conjugated beads. In total, the probes target approximately 39Mb of the human genome.
Genomic DNA is extracted from both a tumor and a patient-matched normal control
sample. Sequence libraries are prepared through a series of enzymatic steps including
shearing of double-stranded DNA, end repair, A-base addition, ligation of barcoded
sequence adaptors, and low cycle PCR amplification. Single barcoded sequence libraries
are captured using the biotinylated probes. Captured DNA fragments are then pooled and
sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 as paired-end reads. Sequence reads are then
aligned to the reference human genome. By comparing the identity of bases from the tumor
DNA to the matched normal DNA and the reference human genome, somatic alterations
are identified in the tumor.
M. Performance:
1. Determination of pipeline thresholds
a. Requirements on exon coverage establishment: A power analysis to compute the
coverage or total number of reads needed to detect a mutation with true underlying
mutation frequency 2% or greater, for varying levels of power (0.8 to 0.99), assuming
a fixed alpha (Type I error rate) of 0.05 was conducted. Additionally, the 95%
confidence interval ranges of observed mutation frequency as a function of coverage
was also calculated. When the mutation is present at 10%, the 95% confidence
interval with a coverage of 500X is expected to fall between 7.5% and 13%. When
the overall coverage is 100X, the 95% CI for a mutation at 10% is estimated to fall

between 5.0% and 17.6%. To confirm these estimates, empirical data was obtained to
measure the range of observed VF to expected VF using DNA from 10 normal FFPE
samples from unrelated individuals which was mixed in equimass parts so as to create
a range of SNPs with expected frequencies as low as 5%. A total of 672 common
SNPs were considered for this experiment. A boxplot for one of the mixtures,
mixture 6, showing the observed mutation frequencies for the 672 common SNPs
genotyped in the pooled normal sample binned by their true underlying mutation
frequency is shown in Figure 2. The results demonstrated that an observed VAF range
of 4.2% to 20.3% for a SNP with true underlying mutation frequency of 10% when
the mean coverage of the sample was 968X. This range in values is wider than the
expected range of 7.5% to 13% and likely due to slight variations in the true mixing
percentages. This data provided support for using a 5% as the lower limit for
reporting mutations detected with true underlying frequency of 10%. The increased
VAF range observed at the expected 10% frequency was also shown to be due to the
different protocols and methods used for specimens sent to NantHealth e.g., fixation
time, storage conditions, etc. These processing variations manifest as variable DNA
damage and impact the sample DNA to library conversion rate (conversion
efficiency), and thus result in differing sample representation within both a mixture of
samples and the final sequencing data.
The boxplot in Figure 2 shows a correlation of 0.983, with a slope of .997 and
intercept of -0.0096. Consistent correlation is established as >0.9 as for the whole
pool analyzed.

b. Requirements on sample coverage: Ten normal (diploid) FFPE samples were
profiled in duplicate using the Omics Core assay (total = 20 replicates) to generate
summary statistics across all targeted exons. The mean coverage across all targeted
exons for the normal FFPE samples was 810X (SD = 106X). Summary statistics were
also computed on coverage values per exon normalized by per-sample coverage.
There were exons that presented with consistently low coverage values, due to
sequence similarity with other loci and high GC content; however, none of those
exons were among the clinical validation genes and were removed from the Omics
Core assay. Of the remaining exons across all genes, 99.9% were sequenced to a
depth of 100X or greater while 91.2% were sequenced to a depth of 250X or greater.
This analysis of normal FFPE samples indicates that with a mean sample coverage of
810X, 98% of exons are sequenced with coverage greater than 170X, or with
normalized coverage greater than 0.21. (The ‘mean-normalized coverage’ is the
coverage of the mutation divided by the mean coverage across all exons; it serves as a
measure of how deeply the validation exon was sequenced relative to the overall
coverage of the sample. A mean-normalized coverage below 1 indicates the exon
coverage is below average; conversely if greater than 1, it indicates above average
coverage.) The data are shown in Figure 3a and 3b.
Figure 3a. Distribution of mean coverage values for targeted exons. (Dashed line
indicates coverage at 100X).
12

--- Page 13 ---
Figure 3a. Distribution of mean coverage values for targeted exons normalized
by per- sample coverage. (Dashed line indicates 20% of mean sample coverage).
Based on the calculations, 98% of exons can be expected to be sequenced to coverage
greater than 100X, when mean sample coverage is 476X (0.21 * 476X = 100X). (A
100X minimum coverage threshold per exon is required based on the power
calculations, which showed 100X coverage was necessary to call mutations with true
underlying mutation frequency 10% or greater, with 95% power at an alpha level of
0.05).
To be conservative, a threshold of 500X on mean sample coverage is used to
determine if a sample is sequenced to sufficient depth for subsequent analysis. A
sample is flagged as being at increased risk of false negatives it its mean coverage is
below 500X.
To provide empirical data for these requirements, NantHealth utilizes the pooled
normal FFPE sample with known expected single nucleotide mutations (n = 974) and
the underlying mutation allele fractions (MAF). In silico downsampling analysis was
conducted with a pooled normal mixture down to 46% where the sample coverage
decreased from 968X to 450X. At this coverage level, 135 of the 139 (97%; 93-99%
CI) mutations with expected underlying MAF of 10% were called.
c. Requirements on mutation calling threshold: Permissive standard filters were used
to intentionally generate false positives to identify suitable thresholds for parameters
such as variant frequency (VF) and heuristic filters to optimize specificity. The
following criteria allows optimal rejection of false positive SNVs and indel calls,
while maintaining the ability to detect true positive events with underlying frequency
of 10% (5-17.6% observable). Potential strand-bias and heuristic filters (ctl, laf, mq0,
np, str, end, tri, idl, grm, phs) are also evaluated in the standard somatic mutation

post filtering for the mixture sample using the standard somatic mutation calling
pipeline is shown in Table 4.

2. Pre-analytical Performance
Table 5 below displays the invalid rates across 42 different tumor types (in FFPE)
gathered from in-house historical data from testing >2000 samples. The data shows the
separate invalid rates for the different steps involved in the assay including the
percentage of specimens with insufficient tumor, the percentage with failed library prep
and the percentage that failed the sequencing run per cancer type. The range of invalid
rates was 0.0% to 33..33% which were principally due to insufficient tumor and related to
the specimen source. Invalid results due to sequencing failures were below 7.2% except
for pancreas which was twice that but still acceptable. The data shows that the DNA
extraction is valid across tumor types and interference effects from different specimens
are not significant across different tumor types supporting the performance of the pan-
cancer specimen handling.

3. Analytical Performance:
The hybridization-capture-based targeted sequencing assay is designed to detect point
mutations [also referred to as single nucleotide variants (SNVs)] as well as small
insertions/deletions (indels) < 21 bp in length in the coding exons of 468 genes (See
Appendix 1 and 2). A paired-sample analysis pipeline (tumor vs. matched normal blood)
is used to identify somatic mutations in the targeted exons. A representative approach to
validation of the SNVs and indels targeted in this panel was submitted at the variant
level, and asseside quality metrics (data not shown).
a. Precision Studies
Reproducibility and repeatability were assessed in precision studies for Omics Core.
Extracted DNA was run once per day for 3 non-consecutive days using different
barcodes for inter-day assessment (n = 3). For one run, a sample was run in triplicate
for intra-day assessment, resulting in a total of 3+1+1=5 replicates. For each replicate
tested, all observed mutations in the selected genes were reported and assessed for
precision. Details of the studies are described below.

i. Precision Panel: The precision of Omics Core was assessed using 12 FFPE clinical
tumor samples and 1 commercial cell line (n = 13). The panel represented different
tumor types, different mutation types, and a range of mutant allele frequencies. The
specimen panel was selected based on known mutations corresponding to “Cancer
Mutations with Evidence of Clinical Significance.” Table 6 shows the list of
specimens used in this study. A total of 530 variants were identified in the clinical
and cell line samples that included 483 SNVs, 32 deletions and 15 insertions.
Precision of each variant is reported across all samples to provide an assessment of
the error rate.

ii. Precision – Panel-Wide Reproducibility: The precision was reported for all detected
mutants in all replicates for each sample. The results demonstrate that the overall
positive call rate for all variants analyzed across the 12 FFPE clinical samples and
one commercial cell line was 2607/2650, or 98.4% (97.8-98.8% CI). The
coefficient of variation (%CV) for the mutation allele frequency was calculated for
all 5 replicates. Three-hundred and ninety-eight (398) of 521 (76%) mutations in the
clinical specimens had %CV ≤ 10%; 91 of 521 (17%) were between 10 and 20%;
and 32 of 521 (6%) were > 20%. Discordance was observed for variants in the
following genes as summarized in Table 7 below. Each specimen is separated by a
dark gray line. Known mutation within each specimen are in bold. Discordant cases are
denoted in light grey. All runs passed the quality metrics criteria.

iii. Precision – Per-Specimen Precision: Precision was calculated for each individual
specimen as shown in Table 8. Results from the precision studies were combined
across all reportable genes for each specimen. The positive call rate was calculated
based on the total number of mutations along with the two-sided 95% confidence
interval. The results showed that all mutations have 100% concordance for 511 out
of 530 unique mutations, or 96.4% (94.5%-97.8% CI).
The results showed that all mutations have 100% concordance in all replicates
except for 19 mutations in 5 of the clinical specimens. In the clinical specimens,
discordance was observed for 15 SNVs, 2 deletions, and 2 insertions.

2 Negative call rate was calculated based on variants detected at least once, but with majority call as negative. For
all other locations, the negative call rates are 100%.
Table
iv. Precision – Well-Characterized Reference Material: The precision of Omics Core
was also assessed through repeated measurements of the reference material
NA12878 (pre-extracted DNA provided by Coriell Institute). Table 9 below
summarizes precision data (agreement on variant calls across all replicates) binned
by GC content (e.g., 0-5%, 5-10%, 10-25% 25-50%, >50%) and provide additional
precision data on key quality metrics. The positive call rate for all 420 variants
across all 20 passing replicates was 8,388 out of 8400, or 99.86% (99.75%-99.93%
CI). Differentiated by zygosity, the positive call rate was 5610 out of 5620, or
99.82% (99.67%-99.91%) for heterozygous loci and 2778 out of 2780, or 99.93%
(99.74%-99.99%) for homozygous loci.

v. Precision – Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) TMB is reported as mutations per
megabase (MUT/MB). Table 10 summarizes TMB precision analysis based on all
13 samples assessed. Specimens spanned the range of TMB scores and included
multiple tumor types. The tumor purity for these samples ranged from 25% to 90%.
The per sample TMB analysis demonstrated repeatable and reproducible TMB rates
with a % CV <10% for all 13 samples.

b. Analytical Sensitivity - Limit of Detection (LoD)
i. LoD –SNVs and Indels
The LoD of the Omics Core assay is defined as the mutant allele fraction at which 95%
of replicates for a variant type are reliably detected, of the Omics Core assay was
evaluated by assessing a minimum of ten (10) FFPE clinical tumor samples from clinical
cases across a diverse set of cancers. Specimens were selected for mutations with
evidence of clinical significance for SNVs, small insertions and deletions. The LoD study
was comprised of two steps: LoD establishment, sequencing of a specific variant over a
dilution series, and LoD confirmation, sequencing of a specific variant at the established
LoD.
Part1: Dilution Series: For LoD establishment, mutations in 5 exons with the lowest and
highest coverage were assessed based on the mean normalized coverage for all exons
within the 10 FFPE clinical samples.The 5 exons with lowest coverage correspond to 3
exons harboring SNVs, ATM exon 17 (F858L), TP53 exon 11 (R248W), and BRAF exon
17 (V600E), and 2 exons harboring indels, KIT exon 9 and PIK3CA exon 2. The 5 exons
with highest coverage correspond to 3 exons harboring SNVs, FGFR3 exon 7 (S249C),
ANKRD11 exon 13 (S1790L), and ASXL2 exon 11 (E722Q), and 2 exons harboring
indels, MSH3 exon 1 and SOX9 exon 3. Table 11 sumarizes the samples used for this
evaluation.

Five serial dilutions were prepared using patient samples positive for the mutations listed
above, where tumor samples were diluted with a previously sequenced, unmatched
normal FFPE sample created from a well-characterized cell line. One replicate at each
dilution was tested and the ability to detect the mutation of interest was measured.
The results of the dilution series established precedence for Omics Core to call variants
down to the 5% mutant allele frequency. A fully ranked list of all variants by their
expected allele frequencies is shown in Tables 12A-12J , which demonstrate the
successful detection of all variants estimated at 3.75% and above.

Part 2: Confirmation of the LoD. Based on the LoD dilution series, a total of 5 replicates
were tested for each of the 3 deletions, 4 insertions, and 6 SNVs at 5% mutant allele
frequency. Table 13 summarizes the specimens and genes assessed for the LoD
confirmation study. In the LoD confirmation study, replicates for all variants had 100%
positive call rates except for one replicate for a SNV on BAP1 exon 16. This replicate was
detected but failed to meet the variant confidence threshold established for reporting. A
summary of the data per variant evaluated, including the mutation, the gene and exon,
range for DP, AD, MAF, NormDP, and positive call rate is shown in Table 13. The results
of the LoD establishment and confirmation study demonstrate Omics Core’s ability to
detect and reliably call each variant class at the 5% mutant allele frequency with a success
rate of ≥ 95%. SNVs were called at 96.7% (82.8%-99.9% CI), insertions at 100% (83.2%-
100.0% CI) and deletions at 100.0% (78.2%-100.0% CI).

ii. LoD – Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB):
Ten (10) FFPE tumor specimens with a tumor purity of ≤ 20%, as assessed by a board
certified pathologist, were selected for TMB analysis. Five (5) replicates of each
tumor specimen were analyzed by the Omics Core assay and TMB was calculated for
all fifty (50) replicates surveyed by the Omics Core assay.
Table 14 demonstrates consistent reproducibility and repeatability of the Omics Core
TMB assay with minimum tumor content representing tumor purities as low as 10%.
The Omics Core assay will evaluate and report TMB rates for clinical samples with
tumor purities ≥ 20%. All samples evaluated in the precision analyses had a %CV <

iii. DNA-Input:
A DNA Input study demonstrated the analytical performance of the Omics Core assay
across a range of DNA input (50–300 ng) in representative FFPE tumor types. A total of
11 FFPE clinical samples and one commercial cell line were assessed at six different
DNA inputs (50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 ng).
Analytical performance was assessed for mutations identified in the precision study. The
positive call rate was assessed for each DNA input from 11 FFPE clinical samples and a
commercial cell line. A summary assessment of analytical performance for each DNA
input range is shown in Table 14.

iv. DNA Input – TMB:
TMB was measured using 11 undiluted samples across a range of DNA inputs (50 - 300
ng) (Table 15). A total of 110 sequencing runs demonstrated a %CV of <10% for all 11
samples assessed (10 replicates each) (Results shown in Table 10). Figure 4 presents
TMB calculation for each of the 11 samples at the respective DNA inputs in a scatter plot
showing TMB score as a function of DNA input. The data demonstrate that the Omics
Core TMB calculation is consistent when evaluating multiple tumor types across varying
DNA inputs.

c. Linearity /assay reportable range:
Not applicable
d. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i. Traceability:
The Omics Core is not traceable to any known standard. Controls and quality metrics are
described in the device description section.
ii. Stability:
Reagent stability is based on manufacturer expiration dating and is supported through
NantHealth verification protocols. Stability of the reagents is also monitored through the
use of the quality metrics and consistent output for controls.
iii. Expected values:
The laboratory has established baseline quality control values and metrics for the
reporting of somatic variants claimed by this assay.
e. Analytical Specificity
High analytical specificity is maintained by paired/tumor matched normal sequencing and
was established during assay optimization.
Interference: The Omics Core assay is designed to minimize interference from
exogenous sources. The invalid sequencing rates across 42 tumor types supports that
interference is minimized.
f. Assay Cut-off
The Omics Core does not report mutations below 2% variant allele frequency. Mutations
included in the calculation of TMB must be present at 5% allele frequency or greater.
g. Comparison Studies
i. Method Comparison-SNVs, Insertions and Deletions
The accuracy of the Omics Core assay was assessed by comparing Omics Core
results to results obtained from the orthogonal method. A total of 401 FFPE tumor
samples from clinical cases across a diverse set of cancers were used in this
analysis, representing mutations covering 2,634 SNVs, 125 small insertions, and
313 small deletions.
The results of the comparison study demonstrate the accuracy of the Omics Core
assay by successfully detecting mutations in 401 out of the 401 samples,
representing an accuracy of 100% (99.08-100.00% CI). There were 3 false
positives across 2 genes and 8 false negatives across 8 genes. A total of 3072
64

--- Page 65 ---
unique mutations in 401 FFPE tumor specimens representing 1835 exons in 471
genes were tested and are listed in Appendix 2.
Omics Core accuracy study2 included 2634 unique SNVs demonstrated a PPA of
99.76% (99.50-99.90% CI), PPV of 99.93% (99.75-99.99% CI); 125 unique small
insertions (ranging from 1 bp to 12 bp) demonstrated a PPA of 100% (97.20-
100.00% CI), PPV of 100% (97.20-100.00% CI); and 313 unique small deletions
(ranging from 1 bp to 61 bp) demonstrated a PPA of 99.71% (98.38-99.99% CI),
PPV of 99.71% (98.38-99.99% CI). To adjust for sampling prevalence, adjusted
PPA was provided (All data 100% except where indicated). Calculating adjusted
PPA requires estimation of the prevalence of positives which was estimated for the
set of all variants tested, as well as a per-gene for the set of variants in a singe
gene. Results are shown in Tables 15A-15C below separated by SNVs, insertions
and deletions.

ii. Accuracy (Method Comparison- Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB)
Tumor mutation burden (TMB) by Omics Core is reported as an estimate of mutation rate
by counting all somatic, synonymous and non-synonymous variants detected in gene
coding regions and dividing by the approximate size of the exome (33.7 Mb). TMB is
reported as mutations per megabase (mut/Mb) unit. Mutations included in the calculation
of TMB must be present at 5% allele frequency or greater after direct comparison of tumor

DNA with matched normal DNA. TMB accuracy was assessed by comparing the TMB
rates generated by Omics Core and the orthogonal method. A linear regression was
performed to calculate slope, intercept, and correlation between samples. This analysis
identified a number of samples with higher than expected mutation rates after sequencing
and variant calling by a Reference Call Lab. Further analysis revealed 58 of the 401
samples had homopolymer insertions (runs of A, C, G, or T with a minimum length of 4
bases, e.g. NF8:c.450_451insAAAAAAAAAAAAAA) unique to the GENEWIZ sample
at rates higher than expected (> 10%), indicating a potential sample quality issue in the
extended exome beyond the 468 genes of interest being used for reporting on Omics Core.
The resulting 343 samples were then used to compare, showing higher concordance
between Omics Core and GENEWIZ, with R2 = 0.9778. NantHealth excluded samples
under the 250X exome coverage target designed in the study and observed a higher
correlation between both sets of samples, with R2 = 0.9986. A scatter plot demonstrating
the high correlation (R2 = 0.9899) between Omics Core and the orthogonal method, is
presented in Figure 5.
Figure 5: Omics Core Exonic Mutation Rate per Megabase Using Orthogonal
Method Variant Calls
The following tables (Tables 16A-16D) provide a comparison of whole exome calls
between the samples sequenced by Omics Core and the Reference Lab used in the final
TMB analysis. In order to account for the lower targeted depth and lack of matched-
normal in the Reference Lab callset, the following filters were used to exclude calls made
by either Omics Core or the Reference Lab: AF < 5%, AD <= 2 reads, present in Matched-

Normal (using matched-normal germline sequencing data as determined by Omics Core),
and % of MQ0 reads > 50%. The calls that remained for Omics Core or the Reference
Lab were classified as “Positive” calls, while calls not made by one platform (but called
by the other) were classified as “Negative” if the position was within a region targeted by
the platform’s exome kit (i.e., had sequencing data covering the position) or “No Call” if
the position was not (i.e. no sequencing data covered the position). The sets of Positive,
Negative, and No Call variants were then split by variant type (All variants, SNVs,
Insertions, and Deletions) and intersected to determine the numbers in the following tables
(16A- 16D) and calculated the PPA, NPA, and their respective confidence intervals.

iii. Supplemental Method Comparison Study for Wild-type Calls
A supplemental analysis was conducted to assess accuracy for a set of 32 hotspot variant
positions from 12 genes within all samples. Omics Core results for all variant positions
were compared to results obtained with the orthogonal method. Within the 401
specimens, there were 220 mutations across all samples and 12,612 wild-type calls.
Discordant variants included 1 mutation observed in Omics Core and 1 mutation
observed in the orthogonal method. The supplemental assay, which analyzed 220 positive
mutations and 12,612 wild-type calls, demonstrated a PPA of 99.54% (97.48-99.99% CI)
and NPA of 99.99% (99.99-100.00% CI).

normal blood specimen from the patient with solid malignant neoplasms to detect tumor
gene alterations in a broad multi gene panel. The genes in the panel include those that
play a role in cancer pathogenesis and tumor suppression, or for clinical or mechanistic
information of relevance in the management of cancer patients. The assay reports
mutations under two categories: “Cancer Mutations with Evidence of Clinical
Significance” and “Cancer Mutations with Potential Clinical Significance” consistent
with the intended use clinical settings. Mutations with evidence of clinical significance
are represented in professional guidelines as established by consensus opinion of experts
in the healthcare community.
The NantHealth Omics Core report uses structured information stored within the Omics
Core curation database, a manually curated knowledge base that includes biologic,
clinical and therapeutic information curated from professional guidelines and
recommendations, therapeutic labeling, disease specific expert and advocacy group
recommendations, and medical literature. Classification criteria were developed by
Omics Core to communicate the level of clinical evidence available for individual
mutations including TMB in the test report. The mutations are reported under the two
categories (i.e., “Cancer Mutations with Evidence of Clinical Significance” and “Cancer
Mutations with Potential Clinical Significance”) based on pre-specified curtation
classification criteria.NantHealth periodically updates Omics Core through the review of
new information available.
