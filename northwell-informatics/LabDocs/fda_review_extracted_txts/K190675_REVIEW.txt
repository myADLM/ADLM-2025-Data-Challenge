For in vitro diagnostic use
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Dimension® EXLTM with LM Integrated Chemistry System
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Dimension EXL TNIH assay is a homogeneous, sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay
based on LOCI® technology. The LOCI reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and two
biotinylated anti-cardiac troponin I monoclonal antibody fragments. The first bead reagent
(Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitizer dye. The second bead
reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a third anti- cardiac troponin I monoclonal antibody and
contains chemiluminescent dye. The sample is incubated with Chemibeads and biotinylated
antibodies to form bead-cardiac troponin I- biotinylated antibody sandwiches. Sensibeads are
added and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at
680 nm generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads,
triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at 612 nm and is a
direct function of the cardiac troponin I concentration in the sample.

The sponsor also evaluated site-to-site reproducibility following the recommendations in
CLSI EP05-A3. Imprecision was evaluated using seven samples spanning the measurement
range of the assay and comprising of native pooled lithium heparin patient samples across
three sites using one lot of reagents. Testing was performed over five days, with two runs a
day and three replicates per sample per run for a total n of 30 per site for each sample. The
reproducibility estimate is a total of within-run variability, within-day variability, between-
run variability, day-to-day variability, and site-to-site variability. The sample at the upper end
of the assay measuring range was prepared by spiking normal human plasma with human
troponin complex to desired test levels.

Approved Guideline, with 16 lithium heparin plasma samples ranging in concentrations from
< 2.7 pg/mL to >25,000 pg/mL. The high samples and the low samples were native and the
intermediate samples were prepared by mixing high and low concentration samples. At least
five replicates were measured for each sample, and the mean of these replicates was used to
calculate the reported results. Deviations from linearity within the claimed range were never
observed to be greater than 10%.
The measuring range is 4.0 – 25,000 pg/mL with the upper end of the measuring range being
defined by the upper linear range of the assay. See detection limits in Section VII.1.d. below
for information supporting the lower end of the measuring range.
Hook Effect
The sponsor demonstrated that there is no hook effect with the assay up to 1,296,080 pg/mL.
Dilution Recovery
The sponsor provided dilution studies which supported the measurement of samples
above the measurement range diluted by a factor of 2 and a factor of 5.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor’s traceability scheme was reviewed and found acceptable. The assay is traceable
to a commercially available troponin assay.
d. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) Test Protocol
The LoB was determined as described in the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline, Evaluation of
Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline
– Second Edition. Testing was performed using three lots of reagents, each on one
instrument. 60 determinations were obtained by testing five samples with no analyte (the
zero level calibrator material) four times a day for three days across three reagent lots. LoB
was calculated non-parametrically. The largest estimate across all reagent lot-instrument
combinations tested was 1.0 pg/mL.
Limit of Detection (LoD) Test Protocol
The LoD was determined following the recommendations in the CLSI EP17-A2
guideline. Testing was performed using three reagent lots and one instrument. For the
three lots tested, seven to ten native low analyte lithium heparin plasma samples were
tested every day, respectively, with four replicates for each test, for three days.
The nonparametric approach described in EP17-A2 was followed to determine the LoD.
The largest estimate across all reagent lot-instrument combinations tested was
1.8 pg/mL.
K190675 - Page 5 of 13

--- Page 6 ---
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) Protocol
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined as the analyte level with a within- lab CV
of less than or equal to 20% following the recommendations in the CLSI EP17-A2
guideline. Testing was completed two times a day (n=2) for at least 20 days for a total of 80
replicates with eight to 10 native lithium heparin plasma pools measured on one instrument
using three reagent lots. For each reagent lot-instrument combination, the within-laboratory
precision for each sample, expressed as %CV, was plotted against the mean concentration
obtained for each sample. LoQ was determined by this precision profile as the concentration
where the %CV was less than 20%. The largest estimate across all reagent lot-instrument
combinations tested was 2.4 pg/mL.
The sponsor claims a LoB of 1.1 pg/mL, and LoD of 2.7 pg/mL, and an LoQ of 4.0 pg/mL.
e. Analytical Specificity:
Endogenous interference studies were performed following the recommendations in the CLSI
EP07-A2 guideline, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry – Second Edition. Two
sample pools were tested. One sample pool had 20-60 pg/mL cTnI and the second sample
pool had 700-2000 pg/mL cTnI. These sample pools were spiked with potential interferents.
Test results from samples spiked with the potential interferent were compared to test results
from the control samples lacking the potential interferent. At the tested concentrations, these
compounds caused <10% interference.

The labeling states:
See limitations section for information regarding patients with either renal impairment or
multiple sclerosis. Some studies have shown that serum concentrations of biotin can reach
355 ng/mL within the first hour after biotin ingestion for apparently healthy subjects
consuming supplements of 20 mg biotin per day and plasma concentrations of biotin can
reach up to 1,160 ng/mL for apparently healthy subjects after a single dose of 300 mg biotin.
Limitations
The following limitations are included in the labeling:
Testing specimens from renal dysfunction patients taking biotin may lead to false negative
results. Therefore, do not use this device in patients with renal impairment (eGFR<60),
unless it is confirmed that the patient is not taking biotin.
Patients taking more than 20 mg/day of biotin may have falsely negative results and should
not use this test. There have been reports of multiple sclerosis patients taking biotin doses
exceeding 20 mg/day. Therefore, do not use this device in patients with Multiple Sclerosis,
unless it is confirmed that the patient is not taking more than 20 mg/day of biotin.
Patient samples may contain cardiac troponin-specific autoantibodies that could react in
immunoassays to give depressed results. A test result that is inconsistent with the clinical
picture and patient history should be interpreted with caution.
Samples from patients receiving preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies for therapy or
diagnosis may contain human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA). Such samples may show
either falsely elevated or falsely depressed values. This assay has been designed to minimize
interference from heterophilic antibodies. Nevertheless, complete elimination of this
interference from all patient specimens cannot be guaranteed. A test result that is inconsistent
with the clinical picture and patient history should be interpreted with caution.

Specimens that contain biotin at a concentration of 300 ng/mL demonstrate a less than 10%
change in results. Biotin concentrations greater than this may lead to falsely depressed results
for patient samples.
Dextran 40 at 60 g/L increases the troponin result in plasma at 33.0 pg/mL [ng/L] and 1089.3
pg/mL [ng/L] by 16% and 4% respectively. Dextran 40 at 15 g/L and 45 g/L demonstrates
less than 10% change in results when testing plasma samples at the concentrations stated
above.
Protein Gamma Globulin at 6 g/dL causes anomalous results in plasma at approximately 40

3. Clinical Studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
A clinical study was performed to evaluate the clinical performance of the device at the
different clinical cut-offs (see section 5, Expected values/Reference range, below). A
multicenter prospective study evaluated 2495 patients from emergency departments
presenting with chest pain or equivalent symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndromes.
Final diagnoses were adjudicated by an independent panel of expert physicians using criteria
consistent with the 2007 Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (MI). Serial samples
were collected from patients presenting to the emergency department. The number of patients
adjudicated with an MI was 13% (325/2498). The sample collection times were at 0 – 1.5
hours (from time since presentation) and at the following timepoint relative to the time from
presentation: 1.5 to 2.5 hours, 2.5 to 3.5 hours, 3.5 to 4.5 hours, 4.5 to 6 hours, 6 to 9 hours, 9
to 24 hours, and greater than 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department.
Investigators and adjudicators were blinded to the proposed device’s results. Adjudicators
were also blinded to site diagnoses. All results presented below were based on the
adjudicated diagnoses. Clinical performance was estimated at an overall cut-off (male and
female combined 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) cut-off) and male- and female-
specific URL cut-offs, calculated as described in Section 5, Expected values/Reference
range, below. The results are summarized below.

The following statements about cut-offs are included in the labeling:
Using the lower female-specific 99th percentile instead of the overall 99th percentile of 60.4
pg/mL (ng/L) may result in a higher proportion of positive test results for females that are
non-MI. Taking into consideration the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval, in the
worst-case scenario ( drawn at ≥4.5--<6 hours after presentation), up to 71% of positive test
results for females may be non-MI.
Using the higher male-specific 99th percentile instead of the overall 99th percentile of 60.4
pg/mL (ng/L) may result in a higher proportion of negative test results for males that are MI.
For males that are MI, data analyzed using the male-specific cutoff versus the overall cutoff
increased the false- negative rate by up to 3.3%.
b. Clinical Specificity:
See Clinical Sensitivity Section above.
4. Clinical Cut-Off:
The cut-offs for this assay were determined based on the 99th percentile upper reference limit in
apparently healthy adults. Please see section 5, Expected Values/Reference Range, below for the
determination of the clinical cut-offs.
5. Expected Values/Reference Range:
The sponsor conducted a multicenter prospective study to establish the 99th percentile in a
population of apparently healthy adults.
Lithium-heparin plasma specimens were collected from apparently healthy adults with no known
diseases of the cardiovascular system or other serious acute or chronic diseases or infections
from the United States who ranged in age from 22–91 years of age.
Plasma samples from 2020 subjects were tested in singlicate. The 99th percentile value for
results in apparently healthy subjects was calculated. The 99th percentile values were determined
using the non-parametric empirical univariate distribution function. The results are summarized
below:
99th Percentile 90% CI pg/mL
Population N
URL pg/mL [ng/L] [ng/L]
Overall 2020 60.4 43.2 to 81.3
Females 1017 51.4 35.6 to 109.2
Males 1003 76.2 42.3 to 117.0
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
