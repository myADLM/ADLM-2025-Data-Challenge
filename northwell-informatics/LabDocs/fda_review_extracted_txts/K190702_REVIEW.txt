B Principle of Operation:
Lumipulse G whole PTH is an assay system, including a set of immunoassay reagents and
calibrators, for the quantitative measurement of whole parathyroid hormone (whole PTH) in
specimens based on Chemiluminescent Enzyme Immunoassay (CLEIA) technology by a one-
step sandwich immunoassay method on the LUMIPULSE G System. In the first reaction,
alkaline phosphatase (ALP: calf)-labeled anti-PTH polyclonal antibody (goat), PTH in
specimens, and anti-PTH polyclonal antibody (goat) - coated ferrite particles specifically bind to
form antigen-antibody immunocomplexes. The particles are washed and rinsed to remove
unbound materials. The Substrate Solution is then added and mixed with the particles in the
enzyme reaction. AMPPD (3-(2'-spiroadmantane)-4-methoxy-4-(3''-phosphoryloxy)phenyl-1,2-
dioxetane disodium salt) contained in the Substrate Solution is dephosphorylated by the catalysis
of ALP indirectly conjugated to particles. Finally, the luminescence (at a maximum wavelength
of 477 nm) is generated by the cleavage reaction of the dephosphorylated AMPPD. The
Luminescent signal is proportional to the amount of whole PTH.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A 20-day, lot-to-lot, and site-to-site precision study were performed in accordance with the
CLSI EP05-A3 guideline.
20-Day Precision:
The single-site precision study was conducted by testing a panel of 2 controls and seven
samples (panels 1-7) prepared from pooled human serum containing native analyte. The
samples were assayed in duplicate per run with 2 runs per day across 20 nonconsecutive days
(n=80 for each sample) using one LUMIPULSE G1200 System and one lot of Lumipulse G
whole PTH. The results of the precision studies are summarized below:

Lot-to-Lot Precision:
The lot-to-lot study was conducted using 3 lots of Lumipulse G whole PTH (lots A, B, and
C). Each lot was tested on a different LUMIPULSE G1200 System (n=3). A panel of 2
controls and 4 samples (panels 1-4) were assayed. Panels 1-4 were prepared from pooled
human serum containing native analyte. The samples were tested in duplicate per run with 2
runs per day across 8 nonconsecutive days for a total of 16 precision runs per lot (n=32
replicates per lot). There were 96 replicates per panel across all 3 lots. The results are
summarized below:

Site-to-Site Precision:
The site-to-site precision study was conducted across 1 internal site and 2 external sites. A
panel of 5 pooled human serum samples with native analyte (panels 1-5) were assayed. Each
sample was assayed in triplicate at 2 separate times of the day for 5 days using 3
LUMIPULSE G1200 instruments (one per site). Two lots of reagents were utilized for
testing, and the data from both 5-day precision studies for Panels 1-5 were combined for the
site-to-site analysis. The results of the reproducibility study are presented below:

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was performed in accordance with the CLSI EP06 guideline. High and low
serum sample pools were intermixed to create samples that contained native whole PTH with
concentrations that ranged from 1.4 to 2190.3 pg/mL. Each sample was tested in
quadruplicate. Data was analyzed by linear regression and the results are summarized below:
y = -0.36519 + 1.091572 x; R2 = 0.9984
The results of the linearity study support the claimed measuring range of 4.0 – 1800 pg/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross Reactivity:
A cross-reactivity study was performed in accordance with the CLSI EP07-A2 guideline.
Lumipulse G whole PTH on the LUMIPULSE G1200 System was evaluated for cross-
reactivity of the assay with other substances that are similar in structure to whole PTH and
truncated versions of whole PTH. Three test panels were prepared from pooled human serum
containing native analyte. Each panel was split into 2 equal aliquots (test and control
samples). Aliquot 1 (test) was spiked with the potential cross-reactant, Aliquot 2 (control)
was spiked with an equal volume of solvent used to prepare stock solutions of cross-reactant.
Test and control samples were run in triplicate. The acceptance criteria for cross-reactivity

results from the linearity, precision, limit of detection, and accuracy studies.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

6. Detection Limit:
The sponsor provided detection limits following CLSI Guideline EP17-A2 guideline.
Limit of Blank (LoB): Four blank samples were tested in replicates of 5 in each run on 2 lot
combinations per day for 3 days. Each lot combination was run on one LUMIPULSE G1200
instrument (n=2 total). All panels were tested in one run per day. For each lot combination,
there was a total of 60 replicates. To calculate the LoB all blank sample measurement results
were sorted from lowest to highest and the 95th percentile value was calculated. The
maximum LoB across all lots and instruments was taken as the LoB estimate value. The LoB
for Lumipulse G whole PTH on the LUMIPULSE G1200 System was determined to be 0.0
pg/mL.

Lumipulse G whole PTH for Lumipulse G whole PTH and 6.48 to 1750 pg/mL for LIAISON
1-84 PTH. The data analysis was conducted using the weighted Deming regression method
and results are summarized in the following table:
Lumipulse G whole PTH vs. LIASON 1-84 PTH
n Correlation Coefficient (r) Intercept (95% CI) Slope (95% CI)
275 0.9808 -0.5351 0.9909
(-1.2821 to 0.2119) (0.9726 to 1.0093)
2. Matrix Comparison:
The matrix comparison study was executed by testing seventy-one (71) matched sets of
serum (red top and serum separator tubes (SST)) and plasma (K EDTA, sodium heparin and
2
lithium heparin) samples. The results are presented in the following table:

The study results support the sponsor’s claim that human serum and plasma (K2 EDTA,
lithium heparin and sodium heparin) are acceptable sample types to be used with this assay.
C Clinical Studies:
Not applicable.
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The reference range study testing was conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice and
21 CFR parts 50, 56, and 812. A total of 147 serum specimens obtained from an apparently
healthy adult population (22-72 years old) were tested using the Lumipulse G whole PTH per
CLSI EP28. The observed ranges are listed below:
Group n Median (pg/mL) Range (pg/mL) 5th and 95th
Percentile
All 147 15.7 6.9 – 27.4
Apparently Healthy Females 68 16.2 8.7 – 29.7
Apparently Healthy Males 79 15.2 6.6 -23.2
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
