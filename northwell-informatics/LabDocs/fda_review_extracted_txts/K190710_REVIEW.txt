Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and
CLSI EP17 A
Limits of Quantification
L. Test Principle:
EliA tests are fluorescence immunoassays for the detection and measurement of human
antibodies based on EliA solid-phase components, which contain specific antigens for the
antibodies to be measured. EliA uses a modular reagent system. The test specific, method
specific, and general reagents are packaged and purchased as separate units.
EliA SymphonyS: Polystyrene EliA wells are coated with a mixture of the target antigens:
human U1RNP (RNP 70, A, C), SS-A/Ro (60 kDa, 52 kDa), SSB/La, Centromere B, Scl-70,
Jo-1 proteins and a synthetic SmD3 peptide. Together, this grouping of autoantigenic targets
are collectively referred to as extractable nuclear antigens (ENA). If present in the patient's
specimen, autoantibodies to these proteins bind to the specific antigen. After washing away
unbound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgG antibodies (EliA IgG
Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound
conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is incubated with a fluorogenic
development solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is
measured. Fluorometric measurements are converted to an arbitrary unitless ratio, by scaling
to EliA total IgG calibration. The higher the ratio, the more autoantigen-specific IgG is
present in the specimen. Qualitative interpretation of this ratio value is summarized in the
table below.
Qualitative interpretation of SymphonyS results
Interpretation [Ratio]
Negative (−) < 0.7
Equivocal (Eq) 0.7–1.0
Positive (+) > 1.0
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Acceptance criteria for all parameters was met.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To evaluate reproducibility of the EliA SymphonyS assay on the Phadia 250
instrument platform, six samples with a range of reactivities were tested. The samples
were native samples or positive samples diluted with normal sera. Samples 2 through
6 were tested with three lots on three instruments × seven days × one run/day × four

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable; the assay is qualitative.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The EliA IgG calibration method and traceablity were previously reviewed in
K072149. There are no international standards for ANA antibodies. The positive and
negative controls are prepared in house and arbitrary Ratio units are assigned during
the development process.
Stability:
Closed-kit shelf-life stability at 2-8°C for EliA SymphonyS wells was determined as
18 months, based on accelerated and real-time stability studies. Opened-kit shelf-life
claim is 9 months, based on real-time stability studies.
Onboard storage stability claim is 28 days, based on real-time stability studies using
the storage capabilities of the Phadia 250 instrument.

d. Detection limit:
Not applicable; the assay is qualitative.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interference:
Three serum samples (a negative, an equivocal, and a positive sample) were spiked
with the five endogenous interfering test substances at the concentrations in undiluted
samples listed, or blank vehicle solvent. The negative and equivocal samples were
native samples and the positive sample was generated by mixing a positive sample
with normal sera. Samples were tested in triplicate over two runs on a Phadia 250
instrument. The ratio of blank/spiked sample ranged from 0.88–1.16 for EliA
SymphonyS. None of the interferents changed the expected result. The substances
tested and their tested concentrations are in the table below:
Interferent Concentration
Bilirubin F 19.2 mg/dL
Bilirubin C 20.1 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 496 mg/dL
Lipemic factor (ClinOleic) 1%
Rheumatoid factor 500 IU/mL
Exogenous Interference:
Three serum samples (a negative, an equivocal, and a positive sample) were spiked
with the six exogenous interfering test substances in undiluted samples listed, or
blank vehicle solvent at the concentrations listed in the table below. The negative and
equivocal samples were native samples and the positive sample was generated by
mixing a positive sample with normal sera. Samples were tested in triplicate over two
runs on a Phadia 250 instrument. The ratio of blank/spiked sample ranged from 0.83–
1.13 for EliA SymphonyS. None of the interferents changed the expected result. The
substances tested and their tested concentrations are in the table below:

Reference Sera:
Reference panels of qualified sera for ANA from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and the Association of Medical Laboratory Immunologists (AMLI)
were tested with the EliA SymphonyS in duplicate 1:100 dilutions, using a single lot
of EliA SymphonyS reagents. Among the 12 CDC panel samples, 100% returned the
expected result. Among the 10 AMLI panel samples, two reference samples expected
to be positive (i.e. RNP/Sm and Scl-70) returned negative results.
f. Assay cut-off:
To establish the assay cutoff, 70 samples from “apparently healthy” donors and 30
from SARD patients, known to be positive for the constituent single ANA
autoantibody specificities represented in the EliA SymphonyS assay were tested,
using a Phadia 250 instrument. All known ANA positive samples were found to be
positive on the EliA SymphonyS assay, and the 95th percentile of the normal
population lay below the equivocal range.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 633 serum samples were tested with the EliA SymphonyS and the predicate
assay. Samples were selected to represent intended use SARD diseases and
differential diagnosis controls, summarized in the table below.

b. Matrix comparison:
To evaluate the commutability of matrices intended for use with the EliA SymphonyS
assay; 62 matched sets of serum, EDTA plasma, and lithium heparin plasma were
tested on a Phadia 250 instrument. The cohort composed 29 negative, 10 equivocal,
and 23 positive samples (as defined by serum results). The samples covered a range
of ratios of the serum values (0.09–69.70).
Qualitative agreement for comparisons of serum samples to the plasma matrices are

The frequency for ENA autoantibodies was investigated in a cohort of 558 apparently
healthy subjects equally distributed across age and sex, using sera banked by the sponsor,
as well as commercially obtained from the U.S. to enrich for racial and ethnic minority
populations. Samples were tested with the EliA SymphonyS assay on a Phadia 250
instrument. Three samples (0.5%) were equivocal and seven samples (1.3%) were
positive on Phadia 250. The results for the total cohort (n=558) are depicted in the table
below:
