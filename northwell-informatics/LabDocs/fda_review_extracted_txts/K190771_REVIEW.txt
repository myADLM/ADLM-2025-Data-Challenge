2. Submitter's statement that the INDICATIONS FOR USE/INTENDED USE of the
modified device as described in its labeling HAS CHANGED along with the proposed
labeling which includes instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available,
advertisements or promotional materials (labeling changes are permitted as long as they do
not affect the intended use).
This change was for the device name changed from “Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture
Assay” to “Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture”.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams,
engineering drawings, photographs, user's and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to
demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified
device has not changed.
This change was for the incorporation of enhanced algorithms (rules-based) into the Xpert
MRSA/SA Blood Culture assay definition file (ADF) for determining SA positive, MRSA
positive, SA negative and MRSA negative test results. This change is a post-PCR rules-based
analysis. The minimum software requirement of the GeneXpert Dx software version 5.3, on
which the updated ADF is locked and the rules-based, post-PCR analysis settings are
supported and compatible with Infinity software version 6.8 and higher.
The Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Package Insert was updated to revise the Results and
Interpretations table to reflect the revisions to assay test results reporting and to update the
minimum software requirement to GeneXpert Dx software version 5.3 or GeneXpert Infinity
Xpertise 6.8.
The Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Package Insert was updated to include performance
characteristics with a summary of re-analyses of original data with newly released updated
software modifications.

5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification
on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis.
A formal risk assessment was conducted for the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture test and
the GeneXpert Instrument Systems. This assessment included safety Failure Mode
Effects and Analyses (sFMEA) and Device Hazard Analysis (DHA) with the updated
ADF and software modifications. False negative results i.e., true MRSA not identified as
MRSA, were considered the worst case hazard effects to the patient. It was concluded
that based on the Risk Management Reviews, discussions, sFMEA and the mitigation

actions taken, the risks identified are acceptable and Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture is
safe and effective for its intended use.
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation
activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.
To confirm assay performance was not negatively impacted by the incorporation of the
new software algorithms (and corresponding changes to the ADF) for determining SA
positive, MRSA positive, SA negative and MRSA negative test results, Cepheid
performed the following re-analysis of original raw data:
• LoD
No new test runs were performed. Data acquired for MRSA and MSSA during
o
the original LoD study were retrieved and reanalyzed using the updated ADF.
Testing showed that the LoD estimates were not affected.
o
• Inclusivity
No new test runs were performed. Data acquired during the original
o
Inclusivity study were retrieved and reanalyzed using the updated ADF.
Testing showed that all isolates were correctly reported, and the acceptance
o
criteria were met.
• Exclusivity
No new test runs were performed. Data acquired during the original
o
Exclusivity study were retrieved and reanalyzed using the updated ADF.
Testing showed that none of the non-Staphylococcus aureus isolates were
o
detected and the acceptance criteria were met.
• Potentially Interfering Substances
No new test runs were performed. Data acquired during the original
o
Potentially Interfering Substances study were retrieved and reanalyzed using
the updated ADF.
Testing showed no substantial changes to the Ct values from the original
o
report except for two tests with triglycerides and bilirubin that changed from
correct test results (MRSA NEGATIVE; SA POSITIVE) to incorrect test
results (MRSA POSITIVE; SA POSITIVE) attributed to a contaminant
introduced during the original testing as mecA contamination was also
observed in a MSSA negative control.
• Precision
No new test runs were performed. Data acquired during the original Precision
o
study were retrieved and reanalyzed using the updated ADF.
Testing showed 95.2% of the results were identical. The majority of the
o
exceptions were high negative samples that changed from MRSA
NEGATIVE to MRSA POSITIVE due to the original ADF requiring three
targets to be positive MRSA call, and the updated ADF requiring two of the
three targets to be positive for a positive MRSA call.
• Reproducibility
No new test results were performed. Data acquired during the original
o
Reproducibility study were retrieved and reanalyzed using the updated ADF.
Testing showed 97.5% of the results were identical. The majority of the
o
exceptions were high negative samples that changed from MRSA
NEGATIVE to MRSA POSITIVE due to the original ADF requiring three
K190771 - Page 5 of 6

targets to be positive MRSA call, and the updated ADF requiring two of the
three targets to be positive for a positive MRSA call.
• Clinical Performance
No new tests were performed. Data acquired during the original Clinical
o
Performance study were retrieved and reanalyzed using the updated ADF.
Testing showed similar performance and acceptance criteria were met. See
o
Table 1 below for comparison between the original and updated analyses.

The firm provided a summary of the results from the verification and validation studies. The
results demonstrated that requirements were met and any test failures have been reviewed and
determined to be due to software defects that can be prevented or corrected if they are
encountered.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the
indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the
submitter's description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information
between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific
technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as
specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined
substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
