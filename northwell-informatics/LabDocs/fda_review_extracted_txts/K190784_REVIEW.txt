L. Test Principle:
The BÜHLMANN fCAL turbo test is a particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay
(PETIA) which allows for automated quantification of calprotectin in fecal extracts on clinical
chemistry analyzers. Fecal samples are extracted with extraction buffer using the manual
weighing method and applied at a final dilution of 1:500. The extracts are incubated with
reaction buffer and mixed with polystyrene nanoparticles coated with calprotectin-specific
antibodies (immunoparticles). Calprotectin available in the sample mediates immunoparticle
agglutination. Sample turbidity, measured by light absorbance, increases with calprotectin-
immunoparticle complex formation and is proportional to calprotectin concentration. The
detected light absorbance allows quantification of calprotectin concentration via interpolation
on an established calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance: All studies presented below met the manufacturer’s pre-
determined acceptance criteria.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision: Eight extracted stool samples of various concentrations of calprotectin
were tested for 20 days with two runs per day in two replicates per run, for a total of
80 BÜHLMANN fCAL turbo test results per sample. The mean BÜHLMANN fCAL
turbo test result was computed and the within-run, between-run, between-day, and
total standard deviations (SD) and associated coefficients of variation (%CV) were
calculated.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
No international reference material or reference measurement procedures are
available for calprotectin. Therefore, metrological traceability to international (SI)
units cannot be established. The BÜHLMANN fCAL turbo is traceable to an internal
standard generated by mixing a recombinant calprotectin antigen (MRP8/14 dimer)
with the BÜHLMANN B-CAL-EX extraction buffer. Final value assignment was
performed with the BÜHLMANN fCAL turbo using multiple reagent lots.
Stability:
Real-time reagent stability: Three reagent lots and four stool extracts (one below 80
μg/g, one between 80 μg/g and 160 μg/g, and two above 160 μg/g) were used to
establish reagent stability. Reagents were stored at 2–8°C throughout the study. Stool
extracts were stored in accordance with the instructions for use. The results of the
study support the claim that BÜHLMANN fCAL turbo reagents are stable for six
months at 2–8°C.
Transport stability: Four stool samples and two levels of control material were used.
Reagents were stored at 28°C and 37°C to mimic temperature conditions that may be
experienced during shipping. Reagent/sample/control combinations were tested in
duplicates at baseline, and at seven days, 14 days, 21 days, and 28 days post-baseline.
The results of the study support the claim that BÜHLMANN fCAL turbo reagents are
stable for 28 days at 37°C.
On board stability: One reagent lot, four stool samples, and two levels of control
material were used to evaluate on board stability. The reagents were opened and
reconstituted prior to testing at baseline then stored at 5–12°C and used at 2, 4, 6, 8,
10, 12, and 13 weeks after the baseline time point. The results of the study support
the claim that the BÜHLMANN fCAL turbo reagents are stable for 12 weeks in open

Analyte stability: Analyte stability was evaluated under the following storage
conditions of:
• raw stool specimens at 2–8°C
• stool extracts at -20°C and 2–8°C
The demonstrated stability duration is four days at 2–8°C for raw stool specimen, two
months at -20°C for stool extract, and 11 days at 2–8°C for stool extract.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB)
Four blank samples (extraction buffer) were tested over a three-day period using five
replicates in two reagent lots. The study design generated a total of 60 test
determinations with each reagent lot and the LoB was estimated as the 95th percentile
of the distribution of test results using a non-parametric method. The higher estimate
obtained with one lot was used as the claimed LoB. The LoB value was determined to
be 16.7 μg/g.
Limit of Detection (LoD)
Four specimen extracts with low levels of calprotectin were tested over three days
with each sample tested in five replicates. The study design generated a total of 60
test determinations with each reagent lot. The LoD was calculated using parametric
analysis. The study was conducted independently with two reagent lots and the higher
estimate obtained with one lot was used as the claimed LoD. The LoD value was
determined to be 23.7 μg/g.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
The LoQ was established with six specimen extracts at low calprotectin levels. The
samples were measured over three days in five replicates each day to generate a total
of 90 replicates. The study was conducted independently with two reagent lots. The
mean test result and associated coefficient of variation (%CV) were computed for the
lowest calprotectin concentration with imprecision below 20 %CV. The LoQ value
was determined to be 30.0 μg/g.
e. Analytical specificity:
A total of 19 potential interferents were investigated in this study, including six
microorganisms and 13 chemical interferents (e.g., oral pharmaceuticals and
nutritional supplements) with four samples with calprotectin concentrations at: near
30.0 μg/g, 100.0 μg/g, 300.0 μg/g, and 550.0 μg/g are listed in the tables below:

g. Carry over:
Three sample pools (low, medium, and high) were tested over 5 days, in one run per
day, with three results generated per sample pool per run. One reagent lot was used in
the study. No sample carry-over with the BÜHLMANN fCAL turbo test on Roche
cobas 6000 c501 instrument was detected.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
.
A total of 248 samples were obtained for the method comparison study; samples with
the test results within the measuring range for both BÜHLMANN fCAL ELISA and
BÜHLMANN fCAL turbo (n = 220) were included in the regression analysis. The
study subject population consisted of: 76 samples from patients with IBD (61 adults
and 15 pediatric); 56 samples from patients with IBS (43 adults and 13 pediatric); 32
samples from patients with other GI conditions (30 adults and 2 pediatric); and 56
samples from normal healthy adults. The linear regression analysis obtained from
Passing-Bablok regression analysis comparing BÜHLMANN fCAL turbo test results
to corresponding BÜHLMANN fCAL ELISA test results is shown below:

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity/clinical specificity:
The study subject population consisted of 337 subjects including 274 adults (above
age 21) and 63 pediatric (age between 4 and 21) patients. Per standard clinical
practice, all patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of IBS or IBD,
including patients previously diagnosed with IBD and referred for endoscopic
investigation due to a suspected flare or routine exam, were enrolled and referred for
endoscopy. The final clinical diagnosis of IBD, IBS, or other GI disorder was
determined by the clinical investigator based on the results of the endoscopy as well
