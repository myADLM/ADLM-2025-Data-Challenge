IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
This submission is for a single drug in the Gram-negative ID/AST or AST only panel. The ID portion
of the ID/AST combination panel was not subject for review in this submission.
The Phoenix AST method is a broth-based microdilution test. The Phoenix panel is a sealed and self-
inoculating molded polystyrene tray, with 136 micro-wells containing dried reagents. The ID/AST
combination panel includes an ID side (51 wells) with dried substrates for bacterial identification and
an AST side (85 wells). The AST panel contains a wide range of two-fold doubling dilution
concentrations of antimicrobial agents and growth and fluorescent controls at appropriate well
locations. The AST panel does not include wells for isolate identification.
The Phoenix System utilizes a redox indicator for the detection of organism growth in the presence
of an antimicrobial agent. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as Gram-positive or Gram-negative. Colonies are then suspended in ID broth, and equated
to a 0.5 McFarland suspension using a nephelometer device. A further dilution is made into AST
broth (a cation-adjusted formulation of Mueller-Hinton broth containing 0.010% Tween 80), to
which the redox-buffered oxidation-reduction AST indicator solution is added producing a blue color
in the wells. The concentration of organisms in the final AST broth suspension is approximately 5 X
105 CFU/mL.
The Phoenix AST Broth is poured into the inoculation port of the AST panel and the inoculum flows
into the panel, filling panel wells. Polyethylene caps are applied to seal the inoculation ports. An air
admittance port is located in the panel lid to ensure adequate oxygen tension in the panel for the
duration of the test. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix
Automated Microbiology System instrument where panels are continuously incubated at 35°C ± 1°C.
K190905 - Page 3 of 12

--- Page 4 ---
Continuous measurements of changes to the indicator as well as bacterial turbidity are used in the
determination of bacterial growth. The instrument takes readings every 20 minutes. Organisms
growing in the presence of a given antimicrobial agent reduce the indicator (changing it to a pink
color). This signals organism growth and resistance to that antimicrobial agent. Organisms killed or
inhibited by the antimicrobial agent do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do not
produce a color change. The Phoenix instrument reads and records the results of the antimicrobial
tests contained in the panel and interprets the reactions (based on the organism identification) to give
a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value and category interpretations (susceptible,
intermediate, resistant or not susceptible). AST results are available within 4 to 16 hours. This is an
autoread result; no manual readings are possible with this system.
Additional comments concerning specific organism/antimicrobial combinations is provided from the
software-driven “EXPERT” system, using rules derived from CLSI documentation and/or the FDA-
approved Ceftaroline drug label.
B Principle of Operation:
The BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System is a broth-based microdilution method that
utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection of organism
growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells containing serial two-fold dilutions of
an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control wells” that contain no antibiotic.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was performed at three clinical sites using 11 isolates of non-fastidious
Gram-negative organisms. The isolates were tested at each site in triplicate over three different
days using both inoculation methods (i.e., manual, BD Phoenix AP) resulting in 297 data points
(11 strains x 3 replicates x 3 sites x 3 days = 297). The isolates tested in the reproducibility study
included C. freundii (2), E. cloacae (2), E. coli (5), and K. pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae (2). The
reproducibility was calculated based on MIC values falling within ±1 dilution of the
predetermined mode of the reference MIC values. There was one “off-scale” MIC result with
manually prepared inocula and two “off-scale” results with inocula prepared using the BD
Phoenix AP. The best and worst case reproducibility was calculated as described in the AST
Special Controls Guidance document. The reproducibility results were acceptable as shown in
Table 2.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Results obtained with the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System - GN Ceftaroline
(0.015 - 4 µg/mL) panel were compared to results obtained with the CLSI frozen broth
microdilution reference panel. Reference panels were prepared according to CLSI M07-A10
guidelines. The range of dilutions evaluated with the reference panels was the same as that
used for the BD Ceftaroline panel.
The BD Phoenix Spec Nephelometer, the primary inoculation method, was used to obtain a
0.50 – 0.60 McFarland for all challenge, clinical, QC, and reproducibility isolates. The BD
Phoenix AP instrument, the secondary inoculation method, was used to test challenge, QC,
and reproducibility isolates. It is designed to standardize the ID broth inoculum equivalent to
the BD Phoenix Spec Nephelometer, add the preset amount of AST indicator broth to the
AST broth tube, and transfer the required aliquot of ID broth inoculum to AST broth tubes.
Clinical:
Clinical testing was conducted at three sites using 832 fresh (91.8%) and 74 stock (8.2%)
Enterobacteriaceae organisms for a total of 906 clinical isolates. These consisted of C.
freundii (35 isolates), C. koseri (45), Citrobacter species (21), E. aerogenes (65), E. cloacae
(81), Enterobacter species (5), E. coli (294), K. oxytoca (58), K. pneumoniae (180), M.
morganii (36), and P. mirabilis (86). Of the clinical isolates, 174 isolates were determined to
be resistant to ceftaroline by the reference method.
Challenge:
Additional stock challenge isolates were tested at each study site. These isolates consisted of
organisms with known resistance mechanisms (e.g., isolates obtained from FDA/CDC AR
bank) to challenge the ability of AST system to correctly identify the susceptibility category.
Challenge testing was conducted using 117 Enterobacteriaceae organisms including C.
freundii (13), C. koseri (1), E. aerogenes (1), E. cloacae (28), E. coli (25), K. oxytoca (10),
K. pneumoniae (36), and P. mirabilis (3). Of these 117 challenge isolates, 83 were resistant
to ceftaroline by the reference method.
K190905 - Page 8 of 12

Results for clinical and challenge isolates were evaluated separately and combined. Table 4
below illustrates the performance of testing ceftaroline using the manual inoculation method
only. To address testing of non-indicated species, the sponsor included the following
statement in the Precautions section of the device labeling:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and
efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this
AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled
clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those
found in the indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of
susceptibility information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for
specific antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is
approved.

EA - Essential Agreement maj – major discrepancies
CA - Category Agreement vmj - very major discrepancies
R - resistant isolates min – minor discrepancies
Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the result of the reference method and that of
BD Phoenix within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are
on scale for both the BD Phoenix panel and the reference method. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the
interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the BD Phoenix result.
The Phoenix ceftaroline performance met the acceptance criteria for Enterobacteriaceae with
overall EA an CA greater than 90%. However, when species were evaluated separately, M.
morganii demonstrated an overall EA and CA of 47.2% and 69.4%, respectively. In addition,
the major error rate and very major error rate for M. morganii was unacceptable at 26.9%
(7/26) and 10% (1/10). Performance when testing this organism is therefore not acceptable.
To address this, the following was included in the labeling:
Results for the following antimicrobic/organism combination(s) are suppressed from
reporting by the BD Phoenix System:
• Ceftaroline: Morganella morganii
When performance was evaluated excluding M. morganii (Table 5), the overall EA and CA
increased from 93.0% to 94.6% and 95.2% to 96.1%, respectively. In addition, the overall
major error rate and very major rate was 0.6% (4/709) and 1.2% (3/249), respectively, and
was deemed acceptable.

Enzyme Group Characterization/Resistance Markers Information:
Enterobacteriaceae with beta-lactamases were included in the ceftaroline comparative
studies which consisted of the challenge isolates that were tested. Isolates with the following
beta lactamases were included: AmpC (4), KPC (26), OXA (11), CTX-M (8), TEM (14), and
SHV (9). The Enterobacteriaceae included C. freundii, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. coli, K.
oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis.
Trending:
An analysis of trending was conducted using the combined clinical and challenge data for
each organism group. This trending calculation considers MIC values that are determined to
be one or more doubling dilutions lower or higher compared to the reference method
regardless of whether the device MIC values are on-scale. Results that are not clearly at least
one dilution lower, at least one dilution higher or in exact agreement with the CLSI reference
method are not considered in the trending analysis.
Trending analysis results are shown in Table 7; results were stratified by species to assess
species-related trends. Species for which the difference between the percentage of isolates
with higher or lower readings was ≥30 with a statistically significant confidence interval
were considered to show evidence of trending. When combined Enterobacteriaceae isolates
were assessed, there was no trending observed; however, when each species was evaluated
separately, it was noted that MIC values for C. koseri and P. mirabilis trended higher when
