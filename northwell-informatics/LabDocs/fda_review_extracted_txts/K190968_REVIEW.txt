III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The CEDIATM Benzodiazepine Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay intended for the
qualitative and/or semiquantitative determination of benzodiazepines in human urine at a cutoff
concentration of 200 ng/mL.
The semi-quantitative mode is for the purpose of enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as Liquid
Chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or permitting laboratories to establish
quality control procedures.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography / Mass
spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is
the preferred confirmatory method.
Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test
result, particularly when preliminary results are used. For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Performance data was obtained using the Beckman AU680 clinical chemistry analyzer.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The assay consists of two lyophilized and two liquid reagents:
EA Reconstitution Buffer and ED Reconstitution Buffer: (lyophilized)
EA Reagent and ED Reagent (liquid ready to-use)
β-Glucuronidase reagent
The components include sheep polyclonal anti-benzodiazepine antibody, recombinant microbial
“enzyme donor” – benzodiazepine conjugate, “enzyme acceptor”, chlorophenol red β-D-
galactopyranoside, stabilizers and preservatives. All specimens must be tested with β-
glucuronidase enzyme. Add β-glucuronidase enzyme to the reconstituted EA solution before
using the assay. This enzyme will hydrolyze the glucuronidated metabolites of benzodiazepines
in the samples, thereby enabling the detection of benzodiazepine glucuronides.
K190968 - Page 2 of 12

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
CEDIATM technology uses recombinant DNA technology to produce a unique homogeneous
enzyme immunoassay system. The assay is based on the bacterial enzyme β-galactosidase, which
has been genetically engineered into two inactive fragments, Enzyme acceptor (EA) and Enzyme
Donor (ED). These fragments spontaneously re-associate to form fully active enzyme that, in the
assay format, cleaves a substrate. This generates a color change that can be measured
spectrophotometrically.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was performed using CLSI Guideline EP05-A3 as a guideline. Testing
was carried out for 20 days with two runs per day, at least two hours apart and two replicates
per run in both Qualitative and Semi-quantitative modes, giving a total of 80 determinants (n
= 80). Drug-free negative urine was spiked with Oxazepam to final concentrations of -100%,
-75%, -50%, -25%, below cutoff and +25%, +50%, +75% and +100%, above cutoff, and the
spikes were confirmed by LC-MS/MS.

Linearity:
A linearity study was performed using CLSI EP06-A guidelines. To demonstrate the dilution
linearity for purposes of sample dilution and quality control up to 800 ng/mL assay range,
drug free urine was spiked to 900 ng/mL level calibrator using Oxazepam and diluted with
drug free urine to generate 8 intermediate levels. Each sample was run in replicates of five in
semi-quantitative mode and the average was used to determine percent recovery compared to
the expected target value. The average percent recovery is summarized in the table below.

2. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-Reactivity of Benzodiazepine Compounds and Metabolites
The cross-reactivity of benzodiazepine compounds and their metabolites was evaluated by
adding known amounts of each compound to drug-free negative urine. The specificity
(cross-reactivity) study was performed using one lot of reagents, calibrators and controls in
both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. Percent cross-reactivity was calculated as (cut-

Potential interference from endogenous and exogenous compounds on recovery of Oxazepam
was evaluated by adding known amounts of each compound into urine samples containing
near cutoff negative (150 ng/mL) and near cutoff positive (250 ng/mL) concentrations of
Oxazepam for the 200 ng/mL cutoff. The compounds listed in the table below did not cause

Interference Testing of Specific Gravity and pH:
Drug free urine samples with specific gravity ranging in value from 1.002 to 1.029 were split
and spiked with Oxazepam to final concentrations of 150 ng/mL and 250 ng/mL for 200
ng/mL cutoff. Samples were evaluated in qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. The
following specific gravity did not cause any positive or negative interference: 1.002, 1.004,
1.005, 1.007, 1.010, 1.012, 1.014, 1.019, 1.023, 1.025 and 1.029.
Interference from pH was evaluated by adjusting the pH of urine samples containing near
cutoff negative (150 ng/mL) and near cutoff positive (250 ng/mL) concentrations of
Oxazepam for the 200 ng/mL cutoff. The following pH values did not cause any positive or
negative interference: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.
3. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable.
4. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability: The primary calibrators are traceable to the Oxazepam drug purchased from a
commercial source which is established at 98% purity. The concentration of the primary
calibrator stocks is confirmed by LC-MS/MS from three independent laboratories.
5. Detection Limit:
Not applicable.
6. Assay Cut-Off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration is described in the precision section, VII.A.1. above.

The method comparison study was performed in accordance with CLSI Guideline EP09-A3.

*1 These samples are discordant due to the presence of parent benzodiazepine and also
benzodiazepine metabolites as follows: CA160606-045 contains 7-aminoclonazepam at 3155
ng/ml. CA170605-001 contains 7- aminoclonazepam at 560 ng/mL. CA160926-057 contains
7-aminoclonazepam at 411 ng/mL and 13 ng/mL of α hydroxyprazolam.
*2 Sample CA180820-014 is borderline negative by LC-MS/MS at 197 ng/ml compared to
the 200 ng/ml cut-off.
*3 Sample CA170531-075 is borderline positive by LC-MS/MS at 230 ng/ml compared to
the 200 ng/ml cut-off.
