IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The OC-Auto Sensor io iFOB Test is intended for the qualitative detection of fecal occult blood
in feces. The test system is comprised of an automated analyzer, reagents, and sample collection
bottles. Specific information regarding each component is provided below:
• OC-Auto Sensor io iFOB Test System analyzer: The analyzer measures optical change. The
absorbance increases in proportion to HbA0 concentration in the sample due to latex
agglutination as a result of antigen-antibody (latex labeled) reaction. The analyzer determines
the calibration curve from calibrators of known concentrations and measures HbA0 in the
sample based on the calibration curve. The analyzer can be operated by selecting the icons
displayed on the operation panel, following the instruction manual. The analyzer contains
following components: OC-sensor io main body, power cord, purified water bottle, wash
solution bottle, substitute wash solution bottle, substitute buffer bottle, drain tank, sample
rack, paper, drain tube, elbow, L-joint, fuse, instruction manual, and rack bar code label.
• Latex reagent: The Latex Reagent contains polystyrene latex particles sensitized with
polyclonal antibodies to human hemoglobin (i.e. anti-human HbA0 antibodies). One vial
contains 7 mL of reagent.
• Diluent buffer: One vial contains 200 mL of buffer with 2.38 g of HEPES (N-2-
Hydroxyethylpiperazine-N’-2-ethanesulfonic acid).
• Wash concentrate: Aqueous detergent capable of dissolving protein deposits within the fluid
path during the cleaning routine. The wash concentrate contains 120 mL of a concentrated
wash and each 15 mL is diluted to 500 mL prior to use. The final wash solution concentration
contains less than 5% sodium hypochlorite.
K191147 - Page 2 of 13

--- Page 3 ---
• Calibrator: Contains 3 mL of 1,000 ng/mL purified hemoglobin (i.e. HbA0 derived from
human blood) in buffer. The Calibrator is serially diluted prior to analysis with diluent buffer
to construct a calibration curve.
• Positive control: Contains 5 mL of purified hemoglobin (i.e. HbA0 derived from human
blood) targeted around 150 ng/mL (LV1) and 450 ng/mL (LV2) in buffer.
• Negative control: Contains 1 mL of buffer.
• Sampling bottle: Plastic bottle for collecting fecal sample which contains 2 mL of extraction
buffer.
B Principle of Operation:
The principle of measurement employed for the reagent system is latex agglutination. A latex
agglutination reaction is the clumping of antigen- or antibody-sensitized polystyrene latex
particles through an antigen-antibody reaction. When anti-human hemoglobin A0 (HbA0)
antibody is attached to the polystyrene latex particle and the prepared latex is added to the
sample in the cell and agitated, the antigen-antibody reaction starts, and the particle begins to
agglutinate. If this agglutination is measured as optical change, the absorbance increases in
proportion to HbA0 concentration in the sample. A light beam passes through the reaction liquid
to measure changes in the intensity of the transmitted light beam (latex turbidimetry), and
changes in the intensity of the scattered light beam (latex nephelometry). Latex turbidimetry is
used to measure the amount of an antigen or an antibody by measuring changes in scattered light
rays in latex agglutination.

Patients collect feces from the sample collection paper or from specimen caught in a clean
cup. Contamination from toilet water should be avoided. The collection steps include:
(1) Fill in all required information on the sampling bottle. Open green cap by turning to the
left and pulling upwards.
(2) Randomly scrape the surface of the fecal sample with the sample probe. Cover the
grooved portion of the sample probe completely with stool sample.
(3) Close sampling bottle by inserting the sample probe and screwing cap on tightly to the
right. The sampling bottle contains 2 mL of extraction buffer. Do not reopen. Return the
sample device to doctor or laboratory in mailing envelope.
4. Calibration:
Calibration can be operated both automatically or manually by the operator. A new
calibration curve must be created under the following conditions: (1) a new lot of latex
reagent (2) the value of OC-Control is not within the indicated range (3) opened latex reagent
is left onboard for more than seven days (4) after maintenance.
5. Quality Control:
Positive Control: Contains 5 mL of purified hemoglobin targeted around 150 ng/mL in
buffer. This product utilizes human hemoglobin which is derived from human blood. The
blood is tested for HBs antigens and HIV (HIV-1 and HIV-2) antibodies, and only blood that
tests negative is used. Other viruses or pathogens were not tested and may be present.
Therefore, when using these reagents, handle them with the same degree of caution as patient
samples.
Negative Control: Contains 1 mL of buffer.

testing. The study was performed by four operators using three reagent sets and three lots of
sampling bottles with 21 replicates per test. Each reagent set includes different lots of latex
reagent, buffer, calibrator, one negative control, and two positive controls.
The inoculated sample stability study at room temperature was conducted at four
temperatures (25, 28, 30, and 33°C) over 16 days (tests on days 0, 7, 15, and 16). The
samples were determined to be stable for 15 days at room temperature.
The inoculated sample stability study at refrigerated temperature was conducted at four
temperatures (1, 4, 8, and 10°C) over 31 days (tests on days 0, 15, 30, and 31). The samples
were determined to be stable for 30 days when refrigerated.
The inoculated sample stability study during shipping was conducted at simulated conditions
with a series of temperatures and durations (table below) over 16 days (tests on days 0, 8, and
16). The samples were determined to be stable for 15 days under such simulated shipping
conditions.

Reagent Stability - Latex Reagent, Buffer, and Calibrator
For the reagent stability study, test samples were prepared by spiking Hb-free stool
specimens with known levels of human hemoglobin to obtain fecal samples with the
following seven Hb concentrations: 0, 50, 80, 100, 120, 450, and 700 ng/mL. The study was
performed using three reagent sets with 21 replicates per test. Each reagent set includes
different lots of latex reagent, buffer, calibrator, one negative control, and two positive
controls.
The closed bottle reagent stability study was conducted at two temperatures (2 and 8°C) over
13 months (tests on months 0, 6, 12, and 13). The reagents were determined to be stable for
12 months at 2–8°C when unopened.
The stability study for latex reagent of open bottle onboard was conducted at 25°C over 8
days (tests on days 0, 4, 7, and 8). The latex reagent was determined to be stable for 7 days at
25°C when left open onboard.
Calibrator Stability
For calibrator stability study, the calibrator was diluted with five dilution folds: 0, 2, 5, and
20 (target concentrations 1000, 500, 200, and 50 ng/mL). The calibrator stability study was
performed using three reagent sets with three replicates per test. Each reagent set includes
different lots of latex reagent, buffer, calibrator, one negative control, and two positive
controls. The study was conducted at two temperatures (2 and 8°C) over 19 months (tests on
months 0, 6, 12, and 13). The calibrators were determined to be stable for 12 months at 2–
8°C.
Control Stability
For control stability study, one negative and two positive controls (approximate Hb
concentrations 150 and 450 ng/mL) were tested. The control stability study was performed
using three reagent sets with three replicates per test. Each reagent set includes different lots

of latex reagent, buffer, calibrator, one negative control, and two positive controls. The study
was conducted at two temperatures (2 and 8°C) over 12 months (tests on months 0, 6, 12, and
13). The controls were determined to be stable for 12 months at 2–8°C.
Shelf Life of Sampling Bottle Stability
For the sampling bottle shelf-life stability study, test samples were prepared by spiking Hb-
free stool specimens with known levels of human hemoglobin to obtain fecal samples with
the following seven Hb concentrations: 0, 50, 80, 100, 120, 450, and 700 ng/mL. The study
was performed by four operators using three reagent sets and three lots of sampling bottles
with 21 replicates per test. Each reagent set includes different lots of latex reagent, buffer,
calibrator, one negative control, and two positive controls. The sampling bottle stability study
was conducted at two temperatures (2 and 30°C) over 19 months (tests on months 0, 9, 18,
and 19). The sampling bottles were determined to be stable for 18 months at 2–30°C.
Wash buffer stability
Wash buffer stability was established in submissions K041408 and K092330.
Value assignment
Value assignment is performed for each new lot of calibrator. The target calibrator
concentration is 1000 ng/mL. For each lot of calibrator, three bottles were diluted by dilution
buffer with four dilution folds: 0, 2, 5, and 20 (target concentrations 1000, 500, 200, and 50
ng/mL). The values of diluted calibrator samples were measured using three lots of latex
reagents and one lot of buffer with five replicates. The concentration of each calibrator
sample was calculated by multiplying the measured concentration of the diluted sample and
the according dilution factor. The calibrator concentration is determined as the average of all
calibrator concentrations. The calibrator will be released if the concentration is 1000 ± 30
ng/mL.
Value assignment is performed for each new lot of positive controls. The target
concentrations of the two positive controls are 150 ng/mL (LV1) and 450 ng/mL (LV2). For
each lot of controls, the values were measured by using three lots of latex reagents and one
lot of buffer with five replicates. The positive controls will be released if the concentrations
were 150 ng/mL ± 11 ng/mL (LV1) and 450 ng/mL ± 35 ng/mL (LV2).

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Two independent method comparison studies were performed to compare the candidate OC-
Auto Sensor io iFOB test to the predicate OC-Sensor DIANA iFOB test.
The first study was conducted by assessing 405 patient samples, 105 of which were positive
and 300 of which were negative. The study was performed by 3‒4 operators per site at three
clinical laboratories: one in the U.S. and two in Japan. Statistical analysis of site-wide test
results as well as combined results demonstrated that the analytical performance of the OC-
Auto Sensor io iFOB test is substantially equivalent to the predicate device (OC-Sensor
DIANA iFOB).

Prozone effect (Hook effect)
To determine the possible hook effect of OC-Auto Sensor io iFOB test, one hemoglobin negative
stool sample was spiked with freeze-dried internal hemoglobin standard to achieve hemoglobin
concentration 500,000 ng/mL. This high concentration sample is then diluted to concentrations
975, 1953, 3906, 7813, 15625, 31250, 62500, 125000, and 250000 ng/mL. Each concentration
was measured with three reagent lots in three replicates.
