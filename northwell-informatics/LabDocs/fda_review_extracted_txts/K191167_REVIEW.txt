B. Indication(s) for Use:
The Fungitell STAT assay is a protease zymogen-based colorimetric assay for the qualitative
detection of (1→3)-β-D-glucan in the serum of patients with symptoms of, or medical
conditions predisposing the patient to, invasive fungal infection. The serum concentration of
(1→3)-β-D-glucan, a major cell-wall component of various medically important fungi, can be
used as an aid in the diagnosis of deep-seated mycoses and fungemias. A positive result does
not indicate which genus of fungi may be causing infection.
(1→3)-β-D-glucan titers should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic procedures, such
as microbiological culture, histological examination of biopsy samples and radiological
examination.
C. Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D. Special Instrument Requirements:
Spectrophotometric tube reader, capable of kinetic reading at 405 nm and background
subtraction at 495 nm, while maintaining a temperature of 37ºC + 1ºC.
IV. Device/System Characteristics:
A. Device Description:
The Fungitell STAT assay provides a qualitative measurement of (1→3)-β-D glucan. The
Fungitell STAT assay is a design modification to the Fungitell (predicate) assay format. The
Fungitell STAT assay is designed as a single use test format and has smaller kit size relative to
the 96-well plate format of the Fungitell assay.
The Fungitell STAT assay and the Fungitell assay are based upon a modification of the
Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) pathway.
The Reagent for both assays is modified to eliminate bacterial endotoxin reactivity and, thus, to
only react to (1→3)-β-D-glucan, through the Factor G mediated side of the pathway. (1→3)-β-
D-glucan activates Factor G, a serine protease zymogen. The activated Factor G converts the
inactive pro-clotting enzyme to the active clotting enzyme, which in turn cleaves the para-
nitroanilide substrate, Boc-Leu-Gly-Arg-pNA, creating a chromophore, para-nitroaniline
(pNA), that absorbs at 405 nm. The Fungitell STAT kinetic assay is based upon the
determination of the rate of optical density increase produced by a sample. This rate is
interpreted against the rate of optical density increase of the Fungitell STAT Standard to
calculate an index value. This sample index value is qualitatively interpreted as a Negative,
Indeterminate or Positive result.
B. Principle of Operation:
The Fungitell STAT assay is based upon a modification of the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate
(LAL) pathway. The Reagent for the Fungitell STAT is modified to eliminate bacterial

endotoxin reactivity and, thus, to only react to (1→3)-β-D-glucan, through the Factor G
mediated side of the pathway. (1→3)-β-D-glucan activates Factor G, a serine protease
zymogen. The activated Factor G converts the inactive pro-clotting enzyme to the active
clotting enzyme, which in turn cleaves the para-nitroanilide substrate, Boc-Leu-Gly-Arg-pNA,
creating a chromophore, para-nitroaniline (pNA), that absorbs at 405 nm. The Fungitell STAT
kinetic assay is based upon the determination of the rate of optical density increase produced
by a sample. This rate is interpreted against the rate of optical density increase of the Fungitell
STAT Standard to produce an index.

VII. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A. Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility Study
The Fungitell STAT was evaluated for reproducibility by spiking human serum with
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1→3)-β-D-Glucan to produce a panel consisting of a low
negative sample, high negative sample (just below the lower cut-off of 0.74), indeterminate
(equivocal) sample, low positive sample (just above the upper cut-off of 1.2) and high
positive sample (~2x above the upper cut-off of 1.2). This panel was tested twice per day, in
triplicate, at three sites by multiple operators over a five-day period (1 panel member x twice
per day x 3 replicates x 3 sites x 5 days = 90 measurements per panel member) to determine
the intra-lab and inter-lab reproducibility of the assay
Intra-lab reproducibility was calculated for each panel member at each testing site. The
percent coefficient of variation (CV) for the positive samples ranged from 10.23% to 25.44%
at the individual sites. The percent CV of the negative samples ranged from 6.13% to 30.30%
at the individual sites. The percent CV of the indeterminate sample ranged from 8.44% to
12.47% at the individual sites. These results are similar to those observed for the Fungitell,
and support that the Fungitell STAT is substantially equivalent to the Fungitell assay.
Inter-lab reproducibility was calculated by averaging Fungitell STAT results across testing
sites. The percent CV for the positive sample results averaged over all test sites ranged from
15.44% to 18.69%. The percent CV for the negative sample results averaged over all sites
ranged from 11.07% to 20.44%. Results are shown in Table 1. Results are acceptable.

Low Positive 1.61 0.30 18.69 96.7% (87/90)
High Positive 2.57 0.40 15.44 100% (90/90)
Precision Study
Precision (intra-run repeatability) was evaluated using the same 5-member panel tested
during the Reproducibility Study. The panel was tested twice per day, in triplicate, at three
sites by multiple operators over a five-day period.
For each panel member, precision was determined by averaging results during a single run.
In total, 30 runs were conducted for each panel member. Intra-run percent CV for all panel
members ranged from 0.41% to 26.76%. Overall, 94% of CV values were < 10% and 75% of
CV values were < 6%. These results are within the range of precision results observed for
Fungitell, and support that the Fungitell STAT is substantially equivalent to Fungitell.
Lot-to-Lot Variability Study
To demonstrate that assay performance is not affected by Fungitell STAT Reagent or
Fungitell STAT Standard lot, a Lot-to-Lot Variability Study was conducted at a single
internal site (Beacon Diagnostic Laboratory, Inc.) using three lots of Fungitell STAT Reagent
and three lots of Fungitell STAT Standard. For this study, a panel consisting of 30 low
negative, 20 high negative, 30 indeterminate, 18 low positive, and 12 high positive archived,
clinical specimens were tested. Clinical specimens were chosen for inclusion in this study
based on Fungitell re-testing results. A greater number of negative samples were tested
because the Sample Stability Study (see “Sample Stability” below) suggested that negative
samples were the most affected by sample instability. Overall, all % CV values were 27% or
less except for two negative samples that had % CV values of 34% and 48% and one
indeterminate sample that had a % CV of 30%. This is acceptable. Linear correlations
derived by plotting Fungitell STAT index values obtained for lots 1-3 ranged from 0.97 to
0.98, indicating that lot is not a major source of variability.

Not applicable.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The Fungitell STAT index results range from approximately 0.4 to 3.5, covering the full
standard curve (31 – 500 pg/mL) of the predicate Fungitell assay.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Quality Control
Fungitell STAT Standard
The standard curve generated with the Fungitell STAT Standard serves as the positive
control for the assay. For the Fungitell STAT Standard to pass QC, the following criteria
must be met: (1) the correlation coefficient (r) must be > 0.980 and, (2) the slope must be
within the expected slope range of 0.00010 – 0.00024 OD/second. If the Fungitell STAT
Standard result does not meet criteria (1) and (2), the run is invalid, and all samples (i.e.,
Fungitell STAT Standard and patient samples) must be run again.
Patient Samples
For all patient samples, the following general QC criteria must be met:
1. The kinetic curve must be positive after 500 seconds,
2. The kinetic curve must have an OD ≥ 0.03 at the end of the test,
3. The slope must be numerically positive,
4. The correlation coefficient (r) must be ≥ 0.980 and
5. The kinetic curve must have an upward increasing curve shape
Samples can be outside of the index range of the Fungitell STAT assay and will not meet
general QC criterion (4) above: “The correlation coefficient (r) must be > 0.980 above.” For
such samples, the following QC steps should be performed to verify that the result is
acceptable, but out of the Fungitell STAT index range:
The result is likely out of range on the positive side if:
-
• The Y intercept is positive and
• The kinetic curve passes 0.4 OD before 1000 seconds
The result is likely out of range on the negative side if:
-
• The kinetic curve is positive after 500 seconds and
• Has an OD >0.03 and <0.07 at the end of the test
If the Sample result meets both QC criteria for either the positive or negative out of range,
the index value should not be calculated. All out of range results on the positive side should
be reported as “Positive” and all out of range results on the negative side should be reported
as “Negative”.
Sample Stability
To demonstrate that freezing samples does not affect sample stability, 611 archived serum
samples stored at -80ºC with Fungitell results were re-tested with the Fungitell assay.
Samples were considered stable if there was no categorical change from a Positive to a
K191167 - Page 7 of 10

--- Page 8 ---
Negative or a Negative to a Positive result based on the clinical reference values found in the
Instructions for Use of the Fungitell assay. Overall, 98.9% (604/611) samples had no
categorical change. The seven (7) samples that did have categorical changes originally tested
negative by Fungitell and re-tested as positive by Fungitell. These results indicate that
freezing samples at -80ºC does not affect sample stability.
6. Detection Limit:
Not applicable, as the analytical measuring range of the Fungitell STAT and Fungitell
(predicate) assays are the same.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The assay cut-off was determined through Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) analysis using the
Fungitell (predicate) assay to classify a specimen as a true positive, indeterminate, or true
negative. ROC analysis was performed on a dataset of 93 archived, de-identified patient
serum samples that were selected randomly from the Beacon Diagnostic Laboratory (BDL)
sample bank based on concentrations on file from previous testing with Fungitell. All
samples were re-tested with Fungitell and re-test results were used to generate the sample
distribution illustrated in Table 2.

Interpretation Negative Indeterminate Positive
The negative cut-off was determined using 49 data points, which included 34 negatives and
15 indeterminates. A negative cut-off value of < 0.751 was chosen based on the highest
Youden index calculated from the negative vs. indeterminate ROC analysis. At a negative
cut-off value of < 0.751, negative percent agreement was 94.1% compared to Fungitell.
The positive cut-off was determined using 59 data point points, which included 44 positives
and 15 indeterminates. A positive cut-off value of > 1.076 was assigned based on the highest
Youden index calculated from the positive vs. indeterminate ROC analysis. At a positive cut-
off value of > 1.076, positive percent agreement was 75.0% compared to Fungitell.
Based on these results, the index cut-off values for Fungitell STAT were set at <0.74, 0.75 -
1.1, and > 1.2 corresponding to the Negative, Indeterminate and Positive zones, respectively
(see Table 3).

B. Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device
Method comparison testing was conducted to compare performance of the Fungitell STAT to
that of the predicate assay, Fungitell. Testing was performed on archived, frozen serum
specimens collected from hospital in-patients with signs and symptoms consistent with
invasive fungemia and mycoses (the intended use population) at a single internal site
(Beacon Diagnostic Laboratory, Inc.). In total, 488 specimens with (1→3)-β-D-Glucan
concentrations distributed over the full range of the Fungitell predicate standard curve were
evaluated, including 309 samples that fell within the negative zone of the predicate, 36
samples that fell within the indeterminate (equivocal) zone of the predicate, and 109 samples
that fell within the positive zone of the predicate assay (Table 4).
