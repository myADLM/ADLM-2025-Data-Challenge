IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Cepheid Xpert SA Nasal Complete Control Panel is used to monitor the DNA extraction,
amplification and detection processes of the Cepheid Xpert SA Nasal Complete Assay. The
Cepheid Xpert SA Nasal Complete Control Panel contains cultured microorganisms inactivated
by heat treatments. Each Cepheid Xpert SA Nasal Complete Control Panel consists of 6
individually packaged Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) positive control
swabs (positive control 1); 6 individually wrapped methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus
(MSSA) positive controls swabs (positive control 2); and 6 individually wrapped methicillin-
susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) negative control swabs. Each positive control 1
swab contains MRSA at a target level that is designed to provide reproducible performance
above the limit of detection to produce positive results for each of the genes targeted by the
Cepheid Xpert SA Nasal Complete Assay: Staphylococcal protein A gene spa (SPA), methicillin
resistance gene mecA (mec), and the Staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC). Each positive
control 2 swab contains MSSA at a target level designed to provide reproducible performance

--- Page 3 ---
above the limit of detection of the spa gene target of the Cepheid Xpert SA Nasal Complete
Assay. The negative control swab contains MSSE which is not targeted/detected by the Cepheid
Xpert SA Nasal Complete Assay. Each swab is individually wrapped with a desiccant in a heat-
sealed foil pouch.
B Principle of Operation:
The Cepheid Xpert SA Nasal Complete Control Panel is intended for use as external assayed
quality control material for use in monitoring the DNA extraction, amplification and detection
processes associated with the Cepheid Xpert SA Nasal Complete Assay on the GeneXpert Dx
System.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A study was performed to determine the reproducibility of the Cepheid Xpert SA Nasal
Complete Control Panel using the Cepheid Xpert SA Nasal Complete Assay on the
GeneXpert Dx System. Testing was done at three different locations over five days. At each
location, two operators each tested three different lots of control material for a total of at least
90 test results each for the positive control 1, positive control 2 and the negative control
swabs (3 sites x 5 days x 2 operators x ≥3 replicates = ≥90 replicates in total). Summaries of
the results for both the positive and negative controls are provided in Table 2 and Table 3.
On initial testing, one positive control 1 and two positive control 2 swabs produced “NO
RESULT” because insufficient data were collected to determine the sample status. After re-

The reproducibility of the Cepheid Xpert SA Nasal Complete Control Panel within and

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
Not applicable.
Stability:
1. Shelf-life was established through an Accelerated Stability Study that was performed with
three lots of each Positive and Negative Control from the Cepheid Xpert SA Nasal Complete
Control Panel. The two types of positive controls and the negative control were placed at
elevated temperatures of 43˚C, 53˚C and 63˚C. The positive controls were tested in replicates
of four at each of the four time points (Day 0, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42). The negative
controls were tested in duplicate at two time points (Day 0 and Day 42). The data provided
no evidence of product degradation under the conditions tested. A shelf-life claim of 9
months at 2-25°C is acceptable. This shelf-life claim could be modified based on the results
of the Real-Time Stability Study.
2. A Real-Time Stability, Shelf-Life Study is in process. Under a 10-point regression design,
three lots of each control will be incubated at two temperatures (2-8°C and 25°C). Regression
analysis will be performed at the end of the study to evaluate performance and determine if
the acceptance criteria are met. At that time, the expiration date will be updated to the time
point at which all criteria are met.
3. An In-Use Stability Study was done to determine how long the positive and negative
controls would remain stable after reconstitution. Controls from a single lot were rehydrated
and kept at room temperature for different time periods prior to testing. All results were as
expected and indicate that Cepheid Xpert SA Nasal Complete Control Panel swabs may be
used up to five hours following rehydration.
