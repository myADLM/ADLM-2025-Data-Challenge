IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Cepheid Xpert MRSA NxG Control Panel is used to monitor the DNA extraction,
amplification and detection processes of the Cepheid Xpert MRSA NxG Assay. The Cepheid
Xpert MRSA NxG Control Panel contains cultured microorganisms inactivated by heat
treatments. Each Cepheid Xpert MRSA NxG Control Panel consists of 6 individually packaged
positive control swabs and 6 individually wrapped negative control swabs. Each positive control
swab contains cultured and inactivated Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at
a target level that is designed to provide reproducible performance above the limit of detection
for each of the genes targeted by the Cepheid Xpert MRSA NxG Assay: methicillin resistance
gene mecA (mec) and the Staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC). Each negative control
swab contains Methicillin-Susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) that is not
targeted/detected by the assay. Each swab is individually wrapped with a desiccant in a heat-
sealed foil pouch.
B Principle of Operation:
The Cepheid Xpert MRSA NxG Control Panel is intended for use as external assayed quality
control materials for use in monitoring the DNA extraction, amplification and detection

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A study was performed to determine the reproducibility of the Cepheid Xpert MRSA NxG
Control Panel using the Cepheid Xpert MRSA NxG Assay on the GeneXpert Instrument
System. Testing was done at three different locations over five days. At each location, two
operators each tested three lots of control material for a total of at least 90 test results for
each control swab (3 sites x 5 days x 2 operators x ≥3 replicates = ≥90 replicates in total).
Summaries of the results for both the positive and negative controls are provided in Table 2
and Table 3. On initial testing one positive control and three negative controls were reported
as “ERROR” due to system failure. In each case, retesting was performed with new control
swabs and all positive and negative controls produced the expected results.

three lots of the Cepheid Xpert MRSA NxG Control Panel placed at elevated temperatures
(43˚C, 53˚C and 63˚C). Four replicates of the positive control were tested at each of the four
time points (Day 0, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42). The negative control was tested in
duplicate at two time points (Day 0 and Day 42). At each time point, each replicate of both
the positive and negative controls produced the expected results with the Cepheid Xpert

MRSA NxG Assay on the GeneXpert Instrument System. Together with regression analysis
of Ct values, these results were used to support assignment of 9 month expiration dating from
the date of manufacture when the Cepheid Xpert MRSA NxG Control Panel is held at 2°C -
25°C.
2. A Real-Time, Shelf-Life Stability Study is in process. Under a 14-point regression design,
three lots of each control will be incubated at two temperatures (2-8°C and 25°C). Regression
analysis will be performed at the end of the study to evaluate performance and determine if
the acceptance criteria are met. At that time, the expiration date will be updated to the time
point at which all criteria are met.
3. An In-Use Stability Study was done to determine how long the positive and negative
controls would remain stable after reconstitution. Controls from a single lot were rehydrated
and kept at room temperature for different time periods prior to testing. All results were as
expected and indicate that Cepheid Xpert MRSA NxG Control Panel swabs may be used up
to five hours following rehydration.
