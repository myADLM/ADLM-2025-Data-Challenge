III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
The ImmuView S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila Urinary Antigen Test is an in vitro, rapid,
lateral flow test, also known as a lateral flow immunochromatographic assay, intended for the
qualitative detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila antigens in urine
specimens from patients with symptoms of pneumonia. The assay is intended to aid in diagnosis
of S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila serogroup 1 infections. The assay is further intended to aid
in the diagnosis of S. pneumoniae infections by detection of S. pneumoniae antigen in
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Results from the ImmuView S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila
Urinary Antigen Test should be interpreted in conjunction with the patient’s clinical evaluation
and other diagnostic methods.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ImmuView S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila Urinary Antigen Test is a lateral flow test
for the qualitative detection of S. pneumoniae in human urine and CSF samples and L.
pneumophila (primarily serogroup 1) antigens in human urine samples. The test is an aid in
diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae or Legionella pneumonia
(Legionnaires’ disease) , in conjunction with culture and other clinical findings.
B Principle of Operation:
The assay is performed by adding three (3) large free-falling drops (120 μL) of patient urine or
CSF are diluted with two (2) large free-falling drops (90 μ L) of buffer reagent in a tube. The test
strips are introduced into each tube containing either patient samples or controls. After fifteen
(15) minutes of sample incubation on the absorbing pad, the test is removed, read and the visual
results interpreted. Colored beads bind to the captured antigens, causing the development of red
and blue lines respectively. When there are no bacterial antigens present, there are no red/blue
K191184 - Page 2 of 15

--- Page 3 ---
lines in the test area. As the sample migrates through the membrane a purple/gray line develops
in the control (C) area, which consists of goat anti-rabbit antibodies. This built-in procedural
control provides evidence that the test was performed properly, and the sample and reagents have
migrated through the device strip. If the control line does not appear or if any of the lines are not
fully developed the test is invalid.

Fresh samples were tested at time 0 then stored at refrigeration (2ºC - 8ºC) and room
temperatures (~30ºC). Subsequent testing was performed at 1, 2 and 7 days. Testing was
conducted following the instructions in the proposed package insert. The results for antigen
stability indicated that use of preservative supports stable test performance over the course of
7 days for either refrigeration or room temperature storage. Fresh urine samples remained
positive only 83% of the time when tested at 48 hours. Urine samples without preservative
must be tested within 24 hours of collection.
Frozen sample stability
Stability of frozen urine samples compared to fresh samples was established using panels
prepared with S. pneumoniae/L. pneumophila antigen at Low (1-2x LoD) and moderate (3-4x
LoD) antigen concentrations, S. pneumoniae/L. pneumophila whole organism at low (1-2x
LoD) concentration. and true negative samples. Urine specimens were prepared with and
without preserved. Samples were stored at -20ºC for 7 days and were tested at 0, 1, 2, and 7
days. The results showed that all positive samples remained positive and negative samples
remained negative throughout the study.
Freeze/Thaw study
A study was conducted to determine stability after 5 freeze/thaw cycles using a 110 urine
specimen panel described in Table 6. below. Samples were not tested using a preservative.
The results showed that up to 5 freeze/thaw cycles did not significantly impact the
performance of the ImmuView S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila Urinary Antigen Test.
The package insert will indicate that if samples are not tested fresh, frozen urine samples may
be tested after no more than 5 freeze/thaw cycles.

6. Detection Limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) for the ImmuView S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila Urinary
Antigen Test was determined by spiking purified antigen or whole organisms into
unpreserved urine and preserved urine (boric acid or PIPES). The concentration of purified
antigen was reported in pg/mL for S. pneumoniae and μg/mL for L. pneumophila, and for

positive result in 95% of performed tests. Table 7 lists the LoD values for antigen and whole
organism in urine for S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila. The use of preservatives (boric
acid or PIPES) did not significantly impact the LoD.

The LoD in CSF for the ImmuView S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila Urinary Antigen
Test was determined by spiking whole organisms into clinically negative human CSF. The
concentration of S. pneumoniae using whole organisms is reported in CFU/mL. LoD was
defined as the concertation the yields at least a positive result in 95% of performed tests in
CSF. The study data show that the LoD for S. pneumoniae in CSF is 103 CFU/mL. The LoD
for L. pneumophila was not evaluated.
Inclusivity
The reactivity of three additional S. pneumoniae serotypes, 3, 5 and 37, was evaluated. The
samples were prepared by spiking clinically negative urine with antigen or whole organism.
Testing was conducted around the previously established LoD in replicates of 6 to determine
the lowest concentration that provided a positive result 100% of the time.
The reactivity of four Pontiac and three non-Pontiac strains of L. pneumophila was evaluated.
Samples were prepared by spiking clinically negative urine with antigen or whole organism.
Testing was conducted around the previously established the LoD in replicates of 20 or 6 to
determine the lowest concentration that provided a positive result 100% of the time. The
reactivity of three additional L. pneumophila subgroups 3, 6,8,10 and 12, was evaluated. The

1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Clinical Agreement for Prospective Urine Samples
Prospectively collected patient urine samples (n = 306) from two different sites (Spain and
Denmark) were tested with both the ImmuView S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila Urinary
Antigen Test and two FDA cleared lateral flow urine antigen tests (one per antigen) as
comparator assays. Fresh urine samples were from patients at risk of having community acquired
pneumonia. The results from each site were pooled and analyzed by analyte. Of the 306 patients,
179 were from Spain and 127 from Denmark. The patient population consisted of 141 females
and 165 males, ranging in age from 18-95 years old. The results of this prospective method
comparison test for S. pneumoniae antigen found in urine are noted in Table 9. Boiling of
samples for discrepant resolution did not change any of the results or performance. Table 10
notes the results of this prospective method comparison test for L. pneumophila antigen found in
urine.

Clinical Sensitivity/Specificity for Retrospective Urine Samples
To further characterize test performance, 100 frozen urine samples from patients previously
determined to be S. pneumoniae blood culture positive were tested. In total there were 48
samples from Sweden and 52 samples from Denmark. These results are described in Table 11.
Discrepant results were boiled, and the results are footnoted below.

To further characterize test performance, 98 stored frozen urine samples from patients previously
determined to be Legionella respiratory culture positive. A total of 55 urine samples were from
Europe and 43 urine samples were from patients within the United States. These results are
described in Table 12.

The clinical specificity of the test was established by testing known negative (culture confirmed
negative) urine samples collected from 3 sites, one in the U.S. and two in Europe.
Clinical sensitivity and specificity - CSF
The sensitivity of the S. pneumoniae test line was obtained by testing leftover (retrospective)
CSF specimens from US and European patients suspected of meningitis. Testing was conducted
for contrived specimens were of human CSF spiked with antigen and negative CSF.
Retrospective specimens.
Nine CSF specimens known positive for S. pneumoniae were tested at two U.S. labs with 113
samples previously determined to be negative. Samples were blinded and the testing was
performed by three operators on different days. Five CSF specimens known positive for S.
pneumoniae were tested at one European laboratory with 56 samples previously determined to be
negative. Samples were blinded and tested by one operator on multiple days. Results are in table
13 below.

The sensitivity of device L. pneumophila test line was not evaluated in this study as Legionella is
an exceptionally rare etiology for meningitis, and CSF is not included as a matrix for meningitis
testing in the device Intended Use.
Contrived CSF testing
Additional human CSF testing was conducted using whole organisms spiked into human CSF.
Testing was conducted with the ImmuView test and the comparator for the following contrived
samples: 25 samples with S. pneumoniae whole organism near the LoD, 25 samples with S.
pneumoniae whole organism across a clinically relevent range, and 10 negative CSF samples.
The positive percent agreement and negatuive percent agreemnt for the both the ImmuView test
and the comparator test was 100%, 50/50 for PPA and 10/10 for NPA. Table 14 summarizes
these results.
