III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Yumizen C1200 ALP reagent is intended for the quantitative in vitro diagnostic determination of
alkaline phosphatase in human serum and plasma based on a kinetic photometric test using p-
nitrophenylphosphate. Measurements of alkaline phosphatase or its isoenzymes are used in the
diagnosis and treatment of liver, bone, parathyroid, and intestinal diseases.
Yumizen C1200 Albumin reagent is intended for the quantitative in vitro diagnostic
determination of albumin in human serum and plasma by colorimetry. Albumin measurements
are used in the diagnosis and treatment of numerous diseases involving primarily the liver or
kidneys.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Not for point-of-care use
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Yumizen C1200
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Yumizen C1200 ALP assay consists of the following reagents:
Reagent 1: 1.1 mol/L 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (pH 10.4), 2 mmol/L magnesium
acetate, 0.5 mmol/L zinc sulphate, and 2.5 mmol/L HEDTA
Reagent 2: 80 mmol/L p-Nitrophenylphosphate
The Yumizen C1200 Albumin assay consists the following reagents: 30 mmol/L citrate buffer
(pH 4.2) and 0.26 mmol/L bromocresol green.
B Principle of Operation:
ALP- Quantitative measurement of the catalytic activity of alkaline phosphatase in human serum
and plasma in accordance with a standardized method. In the presence of magnesium and zinc
ions, p-nitrophenyl phosphate is cleaved by alkaline phosphatases in the sample into phosphate
and p-nitrophenol. The p-nitrophenol released is directly proportional to the catalytic ALP
activity. It is determined by measuring the increase in absorbance.
K191245 - Page 2 of 12

--- Page 3 ---
Albumin- Colorimetric test for the quantitative determination of albumin in serum and plasma
using Bromocresol Green dye binding procedure. At pH 4.20, in succinate buffer and with a non-
ionic surfactant, the bromocresol green (BCG) fixes itself selectively to the albumin present in
the sample, producing a blue color which is measured at 628 nm. The intensity of the coloring is
directly proportional to the albumin concentration.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability studies were conducted by testing 2 control materials (Yumizen C1200 N Multi
Control and Yumizen C1200 P Multi Control) and low, mid, and high serum samples (5
specimens for ALP and 3 specimens for albumin). For each sample, 20 replicates were
measured. For the repeatability study, samples were analyzed in a single run on a single
instrument using a single lot of reagent for each assay.
The results of the repeatability study are shown in the table below:

Precision studies to evaluate lot-to-lot reagent variability were conducted following CLSI
EP05-A3 guideline. Pooled samples of sera with concentration spanning the analytical
measuring range (5 specimens for ALP and 3 specimens for albumin) and 2 controls
(Yumizen C1200 N Multi Control and Yumizen C1200 P Multi Control) were tested in
triplicate with 2 runs per day over 5 days, using three lots of reagents and one instrument.

2. Linearity:
Linearity studies were performed according to CLSI EP06-A guideline. Ten levels of
dilutions were prepared by mixing different proportions of serum samples with high and low
concentrations of the analytes. Each sample was tested 4 times on a single instrument using a
single reagent lot per assay. The summary of the linear regression analysis of the data is
presented below:
Test Slope Intercept r2 Range tested Claimed Range
ALP 0.9402 3.907 0.993 0-1,620 U/L 6 - 1,200 U/L
Albumin 0.9632 0.4211 0.990 0-60.2 g/L 4.6 - 56 g/L
The linearity studies support the sponsor’s claimed measuring ranges as described in the
table above.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
An interference study was performed based on CLSI EP07-A2 guideline. For both assays
(ALP and Albumin) pooled human sera with two different analyte concentrations were
spiked with increasing concentrations of the potential interferent and analyzed in
quadruplicates. The sponsor states that interference is considered to be non-significant if the
difference between the samples with and without interferent are within 10%.
The results of the highest concentration tested without significant interference are
summarized in the table below.

Limit of blank (LoB) study was performed by testing 1 blank sample of ALP and 4 blank
samples of using 2 reagent lots over 4 days on 3 different instruments. Each day, for each
reagent lot, 5 replicate measurements were recorded (60 results per reagent lot for ALP and
64 results per reagent lot of albumin). The LoB was calculated non-parametrically at the 95th
percentile for each lot. The higher LoB for both reagent lots was chosen as the assay’s LoB.
Limit of detection (LoD) study was performed by testing 4 low level samples using 2 reagent
lots over 4 days on a single instrument. Each day, for each reagent lot, 4 replicate
measurements were recorded (64 results per reagent lot). LoD was calculated non-
parametrically. The higher LoD of the two lots was the assay’s LoD.
Limit of quantitation (LoQ) study was performed using 4 low level human sera samples
measured over 4 days on a single instrument using 2 reagent lots. Each day, for each reagent
lot, 4 replicate measurements were recorded (128 results total). The sponsor defines LoQ as
the lowest concentration for which the total error (TE) is less than 40%; calculated as |bias|+
2*standard deviation.
Endpoint ALP (U/L) Albumin (g/L)
LoB 0.71 0.41
LoD 1.40 0.57
LoQ 5.85 3.34

7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison studies were conducted by testing native human serum samples with
ALP and albumin analyte concentrations within the claimed analytical ranges of each assay.
ALP was measured using the Yumizen C1200 ALP reagent on the Yumizen C1200 analyzer
(candidate device) and results were compared to those obtained from the Roche’s ALP IFCC
Gen.2 assay on the cobas c502 module analyzer (predicate device). Albumin was measured
using the Yumizen C1200 Albumin assay on the Yumizen C1200 analyzer and results were
compared to those obtained from the ABX PENTRA Albumin CP reagent on the ABX
Pentra C400 analyzer (predicate device). Samples were assayed in duplicate over 5 days.
Only the first replicate was used for data analysis. The correlation between the predicate
device and the candidate are summarized below.

ALP 165 0.9402 3.907 0.993 17.8-920.29 U/L 6-1,200 U/L

Method comparison data supports that serum is an acceptable sample for the ALP and
albumin assays.
In addition, the sponsor conducted method comparison studies to demonstrate that the
candidate devices can measure ALP and Albumin in lithium heparin plasma samples.
Lithium heparin plasma samples were evaluated using the Yumizen C1200 ALP and
Yumizen C1200 Albumin reagents on the Yumizen C1200 analyzer and results were
compared to those obtained from the predicate devices. Each sample was derived from a
single donor in a lithium-heparin collection tube. Each sample was measured by the
candidate device in duplicate, but only the first replicate was used for analysis. Results are
summarized below:
Analyte N Slope Intercept R2 Test Range
ALP 40 1.013 0.3709 0.993 20.39-1,167.67 U/L
Albumin 70 1.009 0.7690 0.988 14.21-55.53 g/L
The results indicate lithium heparin plasma specimens are suitable for use with the candidate
devices.
2. Matrix Comparison:
The performance of the device with serum and lithium heparin plasma samples was
evaluated in the method comparison section above.

1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
2. Clinical Specificity:

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):

D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
Reference range studies for the ALP and albumin assays were conducted according to CLSI
EP28-A3c to verify values cited from the literature. Serum samples were collected at a blood
bank from healthy, normal adults (n=44/sex for ALP and 125 total for albumin).
