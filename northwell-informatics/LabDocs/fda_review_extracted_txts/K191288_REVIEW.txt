eThe panel includes an assay for the detection of the mobilized colistin genetic determinant MCR-1 in E. coli.
The Acuitas AMR Gene Panel includes assays for the detection and reporting of genetic
resistance markers associated with resistance to select drugs in the following antibiotic groups:
aminoglycosides, carbapenems, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, penicillins, sulfonamides,
trimethoprim, and vancomycin, to aid in the identification of potentially antimicrobial-resistant
organisms. The panel includes an assay for the detection of the mobilized colistin genetic
determinant MCR-1, a marker of public health importance associated with reduced inhibitory
activity of polymyxins.
The results of the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel for detection and identification of genetic
determinants associated with antimicrobial resistance are used along with the Acuitas AMR
Gene Panel Electronic User Guide (EUG). In certain cases, this information may be used as an
aid to clinicians in the management of patients with known or suspected antibiotic non-
susceptible or resistant bacterial infections. The EUG contains information on the
appropriateness of reporting resistance markers detected by the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel for
claimed organisms based on the strength of the collective, totality of scientific evidence
delineating the level of association between molecular marker detection with phenotypic, clinical
resistance. Test results are not conclusive or prescriptive for labeled use of any specific
antimicrobial drug product, and therefore, this test cannot be used in place of or to postpone or
delay phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
A “Detected” or “Not Detected” result does not rule out the presence of other antimicrobial
resistance markers not detected by the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel. A "Not Detected" result for a
genetic marker of antimicrobial resistance does not indicate susceptibility to associated
antimicrobial drugs or drug classes, as multiple mechanisms of resistance may exist.

The Acuitas AMR Gene Panel is a qualitative nucleic acid-based in vitro diagnostic PCR test
that is capable of simultaneous detection and identification of select genetic determinants of
antimicrobial resistance. The test is performed on pure colonies of select Enterobacterales and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa grown on blood agar or MacConkey agar and Enterococcus faecalis
grown on blood agar obtained from clinical specimens in order to detect genetic determinants
associated with resistance to drugs in the following antibiotic classes: Aminoglycosides,
Carbapenems, Cephalosporins, Fluoroquinolones, Penicillins, Sulfonamides, Trimethoprim, and
Vancomycin. In addition, the test detects an emerging genetic marker of public health
importance associated with reduced inhibitory activity of polymyxins. An assessment of the
levels of evidence, obtained through clinical studies, analytical studies, literature, databases, and
in silico analyses was used to assess the association between the molecular (genotypic) marker
detected and the resistance phenotype for certain bacterial pathogens.
B Principle of Operation:
The Acuitas AMR Gene Panel assay is performed on the OpGen Qualified QuantStudio 5 Real-
Time PCR System (OpGen Qualified QS5 instrument) using the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel Kit.
The Acuitas AMR Gene Panel employs automated DNA extraction on the QIAGEN EZ1
Advanced XL and multiplex real-time PCR on the OpGen Qualified QS5 instrument. The test kit
includes PCR plates (96-well) with dried primers and probes for analysis of DNA from four (4)
isolates (24 wells per isolate). Each Acuitas AMR Gene Panel test kit includes two PCR plates
for analysis of eight isolate samples along with tubes of Master Mix containing reagents and
enzymes for PCR.
From bacterial isolates, the DNA is extracted on the QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL system
according to manufacturer instructions, which includes incorporating the Assay Control within
the extraction process. A sample of extracted DNA eluate is transferred to a Reagent Reservoir
Trough to which Master Mix is added. Extracted DNA/Master Mix is then transferred to each of
24 wells on the PCR plate per test sample. The contents of each well are mixed, and the plate is
sealed and transferred to the OpGen Qualified QS5 instrument for real-time multiplex reaction
and detection. Data are exported from the PCR instrument and imported into the Acuitas AMR
Gene Analysis Software—a spreadsheet application that analyzes the data and generates a report
for viewing and printing. Each test report indicates detection of applicable antimicrobial
resistance genes as “Detected, ”“Not Detected,” or “NA/NR.” A one-page report will be
generated if the results are invalid, with a summary of the error(s) listed.
The Acuitas AMR Gene Analysis Software generates a report for each sample on the PCR plate.
For a valid sample, there are two (2) report pages:
1. Page 1 of the report contains the following information:
Run/Report Information: the top of the report provides information on the date the test
o
was performed and the date that the report was generated. The Sample ID and the
associated Plate ID are reported, as well as any errors detected during the analysis of
the data. Control Results list the status of the Assay Control for a “Valid” Control.
Class/Gene Table: the results for each antimicrobial resistance gene detected by the
o
Acuitas AMR Gene Panel are reported in this section. Antimicrobial resistance genes
are grouped by antibiotic class. Table 1 below summarizes the possible results reported
for each resistance gene:
K191288 - Page 4 of 112

Table 1 - Results Reported for Antimicrobial Resistance Genes
Reported Result Interpretation
Resistance gene target is detected. There is PCR
“Detected” amplification of the target above the threshold at a Ct value
below the assay cut-off.
Resistance gene target is not detected. There is no PCR
“Not Detected” amplification of the target above the threshold at a Ct value
below the assay cutoff.
Resistance gene is either Not Associated (NA) with the
“NA/NR”
organism or Non-Reportable (NR) for the organism.
Resistance gene results are not reported if the Assay Control
is invalid. A mutant gyrase gene result is also reported
“Invalid”
“Invalid” if the gyrase Mutant result is not consistent with the
user-selected organism.
2. Page 2 of the assay report contains Supplemental Information, which includes two (2)
tables:
Table A: table lists the reportable antimicrobial resistance genes on the Acuitas AMR
o
Gene Panel associated for a given species or group. This table only lists corresponding
antibiotics for organism/marker combinations with an established combined clinical
device performance PPV (Positive Predictive Value) near or above 80%, i.e., for which
the detected presence of the AMR Gene in the combined clinical device performance
evaluation associated with phenotypic resistance against the antibiotic at/near 80% of
those isolates with gene detection.
 PPV: Rate of positive genotypic test results for an AMR Gene associated with
an isolate in agreement with Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST) result
indicating phenotypic resistance of the isolate against a specific antibiotic.
 Actual PPVs for the reported AMR Gene – isolate combinations of the Acuitas
AMR Gene Panel observed during the performance evaluation can be queried
in the Electronic User Guide (EUG) by selecting a specific AMR gene,
organism, and antibiotic combination from the drop-down menu.
Table B: table lists the antimicrobial resistance genes on the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel
o
that are Not Associated (NA) or Non-Reportable (NR) for a given species. NA (Not
Associated) = Gene not associated with the organism. NR (Non-Reportable) =
Minimum performance not demonstrated or not evaluated.

		the detection of the mobilized colistin
genetic determinant MCR-1, a marker of
public health importance associated with
reduced inhibitory activity of polymyxins.
The results of the Acuitas AMR Gene
Panel for detection and identification of
genetic determinants associated with
antimicrobial resistance are used along
with the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel
Electronic User Guide (EUG). In certain
cases, this information may be used as an
aid to clinicians in the management of
patients with known or suspected
antibiotic non-susceptible or resistant
bacterial infections. The EUG contains
information on the appropriateness of
reporting resistance markers detected by
the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel for claimed
organisms based on the strength of the
collective, totality of scientific evidence
delineating the level of association
between molecular marker detection with
phenotypic, clinical resistance. Test results
are not conclusive or prescriptive for
labeled use of any specific antimicrobial
drug product, and therefore, this test
cannot be used in place of or to postpone
or delay phenotypic antimicrobial
susceptibility testing.
A “Detected” or “Not Detected” result
does not rule out the presence of other
antimicrobial resistance markers not
detected by the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel.
A "Not Detected" result for a genetic
marker of antimicrobial resistance does
not indicate susceptibility to associated
antimicrobial drugs or drug classes, as
multiple mechanisms of resistance may
exist.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The Acuitas AMR Gene Panel Reproducibility study was performed at three sites—two
external and one internal site. The study utilized two operators per site, alternating testing
over twenty days. Each site performed testing on two QS5 instruments and one EZ1
Advanced XL instrument. At least three lots of all reagents/materials required to perform the
Acuitas AMR Gene Panel were used throughout the reproducibility study. Reproducibility
panels included bacterial suspensions prepared at an 0.5 McFarland concentration, blinded by
OpGen personnel, frozen at -20°C, and shipped to external testing sites. In total, each site
tested 300 samples [composed of unique panel isolates, positive controls, negative controls,
and no template controls]. During the execution of the Reproducibility Study, a total of (62)

positive external controls, (62) negative external controls, and (182) no template controls
were tested. In all cases the controls passed by producing the expected results. The results are
summarized in Table 2.
Overall results for each isolate tested in the reproducibility study (Table 3) are summarized
in Table 4 to Table 13 below which show the number of tests and the percentage of correct
results obtained (compared to expected). Reproducibility study results were acceptable.
Table 14 summarizes the total false negatives and false positives observed during the
Reproducibility Study, as well as a breakdown by organisms exhibiting these results. The
Reproducibility Study also included a quantitative analysis of variance components, i.e.,
average Ct values and calculated SD and %CV, which were determined to be acceptable for
the assay.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
a. Cross-Reactivity
Potential cross-reactivity was investigated for the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel with a total
of four hundred and twenty-three (423) isolates. Cross-reactivity was also evaluated for
the test’s species identification assays for E. coli and P. aeruginosa, which are used in
conjunction with the mutant gyrase assays in reporting the mutant gyrase gene for only
these two organisms. The Acuitas AMR Gene Panel results were compared with species
identification by well-established automated species identification methods and for AMR
gene detection by Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS).
Each isolate was tested in duplicate from a single 0.5 McFarland bacterial suspension. All
testing results were compared to corresponding WGS results in order to assess cross-
reactivity for those resistance genes harbored by a given isolate. In the event of any
observed cross-reactivity, serial dilutions were performed, and the isolate was retested
until cross-reactivity was no longer observed. Organisms evaluated during the Cross-
Reactivity Study are shown in Table 15 below. Appropriate controls were performed
during the execution of the Cross-Reactivity Study. A total of 41 Positive External
Controls and 40 Negative External Controls were tested. In total, there were six External
Control failures: Three (3) Positive Control A failures, one (1) Positive Control C failure,
and two (2) Negative Control failures. One Positive Control C failure was not repeated,
but all other failures were re-tested and produced expected results.

External processing controls consisting of external positive control and negative control
organisms were included during analytical and clinical studies evaluating the Acuitas
AMR Gene Panel. On each testing day, one negative control and one individual bacterial
positive control were tested. Table 17 below shows a list of the external controls
prepared and tested during the clinical study (stock and prospective study).

For the analytical performance evaluation, sets of positive external controls representing a
variety of organisms and AR Gene targets and one negative control (negative for all targets)
were utilized. Individual analytical performance protocols specified the use of these daily
external controls, requiring at least one positive external and one negative external control be
tested per testing event with valid results in order for data to be included in a given study. Of
the 431 external control samples run, 99.1% (427/431) gave a valid result on the first attempt.
Only sample test results with valid external controls were included in the analysis of assay
performance.

b. Assay Controls
The kit also includes eight (8) tubes of dried internal amplification control (Assay
Control). The Assay Control for the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel test is Bacillus globigii
(ATCC 31028), and it monitors DNA extraction efficiency and PCR inhibition for all
pathogens and resistance genes. Since the Bacillus Assay Control test is in a PCR well by
itself (one-plex assay), it should be positive independent of the other PCR assays. The
Assay Control provided with the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel Test is added to each sample
at the start of the extraction process.
c. Stability
(i) Sample DNA Stability
A study was conducted to evaluate the stability of DNA extracted from pure bacterial
colonies using the QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL System with the Acuitas AMR Gene
Panel after storage at either 15-25°C or 2-8°C. Testing was performed by one
operator across two QS 5 instruments. Three replicates of each isolate (5 isolates)
were evaluated. Test results demonstrated that extracted DNA from a 0.5 McFarland
suspension for use with Acuitas AMR Gene Panel is stable for up to 6 hours at 15-
25°C (room temperature), up to 7 days at 4 °C (2-8°C), and up to 6 hours at room
temperature followed by up to 7 days at 2-8 °C. The study panel consisted of the
following organisms and target gene panel members as shown in Table 18 below.

During the execution of the Sample Stability Study, a total of four (4) positive
external controls, four (4) negative external controls, and twelve (12) no template
controls were tested. In all cases the controls passed by producing the expected
results.
(ii) Prepared Acuitas AMR Gene Panel Assay Plate ( with Extracted DNA)
A study was conducted to determine the stability of extracted DNA after being added
to the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel Assay plates along with Acuitas AMR Gene Panel
Master Mix. This was designated as a "prepared plate." The prepared plate stability
protocol evaluated the performance of the prepared assay plate after storage at 2-8°C
for 6 hrs with a set of five (5) isolates containing a diverse subset of antimicrobial
resistance genes detected by the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel assay (See Table 18 above
for list of the organism/marker panel tested). Results from prepared plates were

compared to plates without storage. Three (3) replicates of each isolate were
evaluated for each testing event. Overall, this study showed that prepared plates with
extracted DNA were stable for up to 6 hours at 2-8°C with all targets detected.
During the execution of the Sample Stability-Prepared Plate Study, a total of two (2)
positive external controls, two (2) negative external controls, and six (6) no template
controls were tested. In all cases, the controls passed as the produced the expected
results.
(iii) Fresh vs Frozen Bacterial Suspension Study
To evaluate the equivalence of fresh bacterial suspensions and frozen bacterial
suspensions, a Fresh vs. Frozen Study was conducted to determine the performance of
the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel with fresh 0.5 McFarland bacterial suspensions vs.
frozen 0.5 McFarland bacterial suspensions. Nine (9) isolates [(3) E. coli, (2) K.
pneumoniae, (1) P. aeruginosa, (2) P. mirabilis, and (1) E. faecalis) were evaluated.
Ten replicates of each isolate were tested by three operators before and 56 days after
freezing at -20ºC. All resistance markers exhibited 100% agreement when comparing
detection before and 56 days after freezing, except for ANT, DFR, and DHA. For
ANT, a single FP result was observed for the P. aeruginosa isolate at day 56. This
isolate was retested ten times and demonstrated only the expected results during
repeat testing. For DFR and DHA, a single FP result for each marker was obtained for
a single replicate with a P. mirabilis isolate before freezing. Retesting of ten
replicates of this isolate demonstrated only the expected results. The results of this
study support that 0.5 McFarland bacterial suspensions can be stored for up to 56
days at -20ºC before testing with the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel.
During the execution of the Fresh vs. Frozen Isolate Study, a total of (27) positive
external controls, (27) negative external controls, and (12) no template controls were
tested. In all but one case, the controls passed by producing the expected results. One
Positive Control A failed initial testing, but upon repeat testing produced expected
results. The study panel consisted of the following organisms and target gene panel
members as shown in Table 19 below. These results support the claim that 0.5
McFarland suspensions stored at -20°C are stable up to 56 days and are acceptable for
use in conducting the Reproducibility Study.

(iv) Frozen DNA Stability
A study was conducted to evaluate the stability of DNA extracted from pure bacterial
colonies using the QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL instrument with the Acuitas AMR
Gene Panel after storage at -15°C to -25°C for 30 days. The same organism panel was
used as shown in Table 18 above under Sample DNA Stability. Three replicates of
each isolate exhibiting the majority of antimicrobial resistance genes detected by the
Acuitas AMR Gene Panel assay were evaluated during the Frozen DNA Stability
study. Extracted DNA from 0.5 McFarland suspensions was stored under the
following conditions: -15°C to -25°C for 14 days and for 30 days. The study results in
the summary report showed that there was 100% agreement between T=0 days, T=14,
and T=30 days for extracted DNA stored at -15 to -25°C. Based on the results
provided, frozen DNA is stable for use with the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel assay for
up to 30 days.
During the execution of the Sample Stability Frozen DNA, a total of (5) positive
external controls, (5) negative external controls, and (14) no template controls were
tested. The controls passed by producing the expected results.
(v) Acuitas AMR Gene Panel Stability
Three independent lots of the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel will be evaluated for stability
in a Real-Time Study at time points established for the respective material after
storage under the conditions specified for the plate kit (20-25°C) and reagent kit (2-
8°C). Stability studies support two months plate kit storage at 20-25°C and reagent kit
storage at 2-8°C. Real-time stability studies for determining shelf-life and expiration
dating are ongoing.

N/A. The extracted DNA from a 0.5 McFarland bacterial suspension is used for the
assay.
b. Analytical Reactivity
Two hundred ninety-eight (298) isolates covering all resistance genes detected by the
Acuitas AMR Gene Panel test were assessed for reactivity in this study. Each isolate was

tested once, except for isolates harboring rare resistance genes, which were tested in
replicates to achieve at least 18 positive data points per gene target assessed. Table 20
shows the detection of various AMR genes during wet testing. The Acuitas AMR Gene
Panel results were compared with species identification by well-established automated
species identification methods and AMR gene detection by WGS. The genes predicted to
be detected by in silico analysis are listed in the last column according to the following
categories: “Detectable,” “Likely Detectable,” and “Potentially Detectable.”
During the execution of the Analytical Reactivity study, a total of 36 positive external
controls and 37 negative external controls were tested. There were a total of two (2)
External Control failures—one (1) Positive Control A failure and one (1) Negative
Control failure. All failures were retested and produced expected results.

b One gene variant of aadA7 (NCBI Accession AF224733) is not consistently detected by the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel
due to 4 mismatches with the reverse PCR primer and one mismatch with the PCR probe of the AAD assay. Other aadA7
variants lack the mismatches and are expected to be detected.
c Only these two Sul3 sequences are predicted to be detected by the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel. Other Sul3 accession
numbers are not predicted to be detected.
d Detectable indicates 100% homology of each primer/detector probe(s) with the target sequence. Likely Detectable
indicates <100% homology of one or both primers with the target sequence (one mismatch in one or both primers) and
100% homology of detector probe(s). Potentially Detectable indicates <95% homology of one or more primers with the
target sequence but ≤2 nucleotide mismatches over their entire length along with 100% homology of detector probe(s).
e The test panel for this study was composed of (5) Enterococcus faecalis,(69) Escherichia coli, (3) Klebsiella
pneumoniae ssp ozaenae, (89) Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp pneumoniae, (34) Proteus mirabilis, and (98) Pseudomonas
aeruginosa strains.

9. Carry-Over:
A panel of twelve isolates harboring a variety of targeted resistance genes was utilized for the
study (See Table 22 below). Two operators performed testing, where a panel of six positive
samples and six negative samples (S. aureus isolate negative for all resistance markers) were
prepared and blinded to the other operator. Samples were sub-cultured onto blood agar and
used to prepare a 0.5 McFarland suspension. DNA was extracted and the twelve samples
were tested in alternating fashion with twelve negative controls to determine the rate of
carry-over/cross contamination across multiple plates. During the execution of the Carry
Over Cross Contamination Study, no positive external controls were evaluated. The negative
external controls passed by producing the expected results (420/420). Isolates included in the
test panel also generated expected results (171/171 results).

No cross-contamination was observed indicating that the open-plate format of the Acuitas
AMR Gene Panel did not produce carry-over/cross-contamination between test samples.
10. Media Equivalency Study
Fifty-two isolates [(13 ) E. coli, (13) K. pneumoniae, (13) P. aeruginosa, and (13) P.
mirabilis), each harboring at least one indicated resistance marker, were tested in a Media
Equivalency Study to assess growth of isolates on blood agar and MacConkey agar. The
Acuitas AMR Gene Panel results were evaluated for percent agreement with the two
comparator methods (automated species identification methods and WGS) for each
combination of organism, AMR gene, and agar media. Table 23 summarizes the results
below, which includes original results without repeat results. All indicated resistance markers
were included in the study, except for DHA, MCR-1, and vanA. E. faecalis was not included
as it does not grow on MacConkey agar.

Isolates were sub-cultured onto blood agar and MacConkey agar, and pure colonies were
selected and used to generate 0.5 MacFarland suspensions for testing with the Acuitas AMR
Gene Panel. Each isolate was tested once during the study, except for the following
organisms, which were tested in duplicate: E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis. Study
results were considered acceptable if there was >98% agreement (i.e., PPA and NPA)
between Acuitas AMR Gene Panel results for the two medias. All organism/resistant marker
combinations met the above outlined criteria, except for those highlighted in grey cells within
Table 23 below. These isolates were subjected to retesting. Upon retesting, all isolates
yielded the expected results as described in footnotes to the table. This study did not uncover
evidence of a media effect between blood and MacConkey agar—both of which are suitable
for the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel. During the execution of the Media Equivalency Study, a
total of (11) positive external controls, (11) negative external controls, and (19) no template
controls were tested. In all cases the controls produced the expected results.

a False negatives were obtained with one isolate on MacConkey agar for AAD and Sul1. This isolate was repeated
on both media, and true positives were obtained for AAD and Sul1 on both media.
b False negatives were obtained with one isolate on blood agar for CTX-M-1, RMT and TEM. Repeat testing of this
isolate on both media produced false negatives for CTX-M-1, RMT and TEM on both media, which is not consistent
with a media effect.
c A false negative was obtained with one isolate on MacConkey agar for P. aeruginosa gyrA mutant. This isolate
was repeated on both media, and true positives were obtained for P. aeruginosa gyrA mutant on both media.
d One isolate was not evaluated for P. aeruginosa gyrA due to a mismatch in species ID from WGS and the expected
species. E. coli was reported by whole genome sequencing, but the isolate was expected to be P. aeruginosa. Results
of re-sequencing for this isolate agree with the Acuitas AMR Gene panel results for the isolate producing true
positives for P. aeruginosa gyrase mutant and VEB with true negatives for all other AMR gene variants on both
media.
e False positives were obtained with two isolates on blood agar for AAC. The two isolates were repeated on both
media, and true negatives were obtained for AAC for both isolates on both media.

f False negatives were obtained with one isolate on blood agar for AAC, CTX-M-2, OXA-9, Sul2 and TEM. This
isolate was repeated on both media, and true positives were obtained for AAC, CTX-M-2, OXA-9, Sul2 and TEM on

g False positives were obtained with one isolate on both media for armA. Substituting original results with retest
results would improve isolate (testing event) agreement across all AMR genes to 92% (12/13) for P. mirabilis on
both media. The lack of 100% agreement is due to the false positives on both media for armA, which is not
consistent with a media effect.

11. Non-Reportable Results Summary
Non-reportable results for the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel may be due to an Assay Control
failure, for which the Acuitas AMR Gene Analysis Software indicates the error “Control
Failed: Ct is Undetermined”, “Control Failed: Ct is above maximum”, or “Control Failed”,
and does not report any gene targets. Table 24 below summarizes instances where Assay
Control failures resulted in invalid/non-reportable results.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
The performance characteristics of the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel with bacterial isolates were
determined in a multi-site investigational clinical study by comparing the Acuitas AMR Gene
Panel with WGS performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 with 2X150 bp paired-end
sequencing, species identification by MALDI-TOF MS and Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Testing by broth microdilution. Four (4) geographically diverse sites participated in the
testing of isolates either prospectively collected or stocked and de-identified for use in the
Clinical Performance Evaluation. To be included in the study, isolates must have been
previously identified as Enterobacterales, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus
faecalis. Organism identification was confirmed for the Gram-negative organisms (e.g.,
Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in the clinical study using a cleared
platform. Organism identification for Gram-positive organisms (e.g., Enterococcus faecalis)
was performed via MALDI-TOF MS. Study samples included bacterial isolates grown on
blood agar. For testing with the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel, well-isolated pure colonies that
grew on blood agar were diluted to a 0.5 McFarland standard equivalent suspension using the
direct colony suspension method per CLSI M07 Approved Standard. Detection of AR genes
in the clinical study isolates by the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel was confirmed against WGS
results for each of the isolate using a validated WGS pipeline.
The Clinical Performance Evaluation was performed between September 11, 2018 and May
2, 2019. A total of 1,307 isolate samples (1,224 clinical stock isolate samples and 83
prospective isolate samples) were enrolled and evaluated in the Clinical Performance
Evaluation. There were 27 isolates/testing events excluded from evaluation (22 clinical stock
isolate samples and 5 prospective isolate samples).
• Twenty-one total isolates (17 clinical stock isolates and 4 prospective isolate samples)
were excluded as these isolates included organisms that did not meet the acceptance
criteria of the study
• Five clinical stock isolates were excluded due to a testing error on a single day which
resulted in no evaluable results
• one prospective isolate sample was excluded due to duplicate testing.
There were a total of eight (8) repeated samples across the studies (7 clinical stock isolate
samples and 1 prospective isolate sample) with one clinical stock isolate that produced an
invalid result during the study due to a failing Assay Control. Repeat tested yielded valid
results. A total of 57 positive external controls and 57 negative external controls were tested,
where 55/57 (96.5%) of both controls returned expected results.
Results and performance of the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel for detection of AMR genes versus
WGS results in the Clinical Evaluation are detailed in Table 25 below, which summarizes
the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel assays for applicable organisms according to the intended use.
Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) and Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) for AMR genes
ranged from 94.4% to 100% and 96.5 to 100%, respectively, for the combined stock isolates
and prospective isolates.

e One (1) FP result attributed to the presence of a truncated aac(3)-Ib gene in a single unique K. pneumoniae isolate.
f Three (3) FP results attributed to an aadA15 gene variant harbored by three (3) K. pneumoniae isolates with high numbers
(≥3) of mismatches in the reverse primer of the AAD assay, with two (2) isolates tested as replicates of a single unique
strain. Two (2) additional FP results from K. pneumoniae isolates demonstrated alignment of the AAD assay primers/probe
with high numbers of mismatches (≥3) in the reverse primer, but no attributable gene variant was detected in the AR
database used for analysis.
g One (1) FP result attributed to high PCR baseline drift and not true amplification of the ANT target assay in one (1) unique
P. aeruginosa isolate.
h Two (2) FN results attributed to the presence of CMY gene variants with high numbers of mismatches (≥3) to the primers
of the CMY assay in two (2) E. coli isolates. One (1) isolate harbored a blaCMY-2 gene variant and one (1) isolate harbored
a blaCMY-42 gene variant.
i Four (4) FP results attributed to the presence of a CMY gene variant with high numbers of mismatches (≥3) to the primers
of the CMY assay in four (4) E. coli isolates. These four (4) E. coli isolates represented two (2) unique strains, each tested
in two (2) replicates. Both isolates harbored a blaCMY-4 gene variant. Seven (7) FP results attributed to the presence of a
blaCMY-16 gene variant with high numbers of mismatches (≥3) to the reverse primer of the CMY assay in six (6) unique
K. pneumoniae isolates, with one isolate tested in two (2) replicates. One (1) FP result attributed to the presence of a
blaCMY-16 gene variant with high numbers of mismatches (≥3) to the reverse primer of the CMY assay in one (1) P.
mirabilis isolate.
j Seven (7) FP results attributed to the presence of a blaCTX-M-27 gene variant with perfect alignment to the primers/probe
of the CTX-M-1 assay for 7 replicates of (1) unique E. coli isolate that was not originally identified by WGS analysis.
k Three (3) FN results due to testing of three (3) replicates of a single E. coli isolate.
l Four (4) FP results due to testing of four (4) replicates of a single K. pneumoniae isolate.
m One (1) FN result attributed to a negative result for the P. aeruginosa ID assay for a single unique P. aeruginosa isolate.
Amplification of the P. aeruginosa gyrA Mutant assay was present for this isolate.
n Two (2) FP results due to testing of two (2) replicates of one unique E. coli isolate.
o Four (4) FP results due to testing for four (4) replicates of a single unique K. pneumoniae isolate.
p Two (2) FN results due to testing of two (2) replicates of a single unique E. coli isolate.
q Four (4) FP results due to testing for four (4) replicates of a single unique K. pneumoniae isolate.
r Replicates are the total number of samples for unique isolates tested multiple times.
A breakdown of the AMR gene detection results versus WGS per reportable species (or group)
and the association with non-susceptibility are shown in Table 26. Resistance marker/organism
combinations were evaluated based on the strength of the collective, totality of scientific
evidence delineating the level of association between molecular marker detection with
phenotypic, clinical resistance. Assessing resistance for certain organism/marker combinations
included an evaluation of:
• Organism/marker combinations with positive predictive value (PPV) observed near 80%
with a specific antimicrobial
• Organism/marker combinations with well-established association between the marker and
resistance, previous reports/literature of associated resistance related to the marker,
and/or supporting data of potential resistance established across related bacterial group
with PPV near 80% for a specific antimicrobial.
Table 26 includes a break-down of the reported PPV percentages observed during the clinical
study and for OpGen’s SMART Study per marker/organism/drug combination, PPA and NPA
values for marker detection by the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel, and information on
organism/marker detection in NCBI (2019). PPV percentages show the resistance (non-
susceptible) of isolates when the marker was detected. Additional information concerning AMR
gene detection and AST results was provided from an OpGen study performed with clinical
isolates collected through a Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART)
including E. coli (n=2,919), K. pneumoniae (n=1,974), P. mirabilis (n=1,150) and P. aeruginosa
(n=1,484) species. Organism/drug/resistance marker combinations for which association with

resistance was demonstrated are bolded and are highlighted in grey rows in Table 26 shown on
pages 33-110. Where applicable, results of molecular resistance subtypes are included.

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
Considering the collective evidence from various sources (e.g., clinical studies, analytical
studies, literature, databases, and in silico analyses), the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel Electronic
User Guide (EUG) provides additional supporting information about the performance
