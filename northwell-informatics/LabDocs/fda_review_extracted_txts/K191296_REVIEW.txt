IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Pointe Creatine Kinase (CK) Reagent Set consists of ready-to-use liquid reagents:
• CK R1 (buffer) contains: Imidazole buffer (pH 6.7) 100.0 mmol/L; NADP 2.0 mmol/L;
HK (Baker’s yeast) 2.5 KU/L; Glucose 20.0 mmol/L; Magnesium Acetate 10.0 mmol/L;
EDTA 2.0 mmol/L and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) 20.0 mmol/L.
• CK R2 (enzyme reagent) contains: Imidazole buffer (pH 6.7) 100.0 mmol/L; ADP 2.0
mmol/L; AMP 5.0 mmol/L; Diadensosine pentaphosphate 10.0 mmol/L; Creatine
phosphate 30.0 mmol/L; G6PDH (Baker’s yeast) 1.5 KU/L and EDTA 2.0 mmol/L.
B Principle of Operation:
CK specifically catalyzes the transphosphorylation of ADP to ATP. Through a series of coupled
enzymatic reactions, NADPH is produced at a rate directly proportional to the CK activity. The
method determines the NADPH absorbance increase per min at 340 nm.

2. Linearity:
Linearity studies were performed following the recommendations in the CLSI EP06-A
guideline. Linearity testing was conducted using a set of 12 serum samples ranging from 9 to
1700 U/L and 12 lithium heparin plasma samples ranging from 8 to 1595 U/L. The samples
were prepared by admixture of high-level and low-level sample pools. The dilutions were
analyzed in duplicate using two lots of reagent on one Mindray BA-800M. The maximum
deviation from linearity observed was 8 %. The linearity study data supports the claimed
measuring range of 9 to 1200 U/L.
Dilution Recovery Studies:
The sponsor provided data supporting the claim that values of highly concentrated samples
can be accurately determined through dilution. The instructions for use recommend a 1:10
dilution in saline if results fall beyond the linear range of the assay.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were conducted following recommendations in the CLSI EP07-A3
guideline to assess several common endogenous substances that could interfere with the
assay. Each interferent was tested with one lot of reagent on one Mindray BA-800M. All
interferents were evaluated with serum and lithium heparin plasma samples with CK
concentrations ranging from 43.0 to 268.0 U/L. Significant interference was defined as a
percent difference greater than 10% from the control. Results are summarized below:
Highest Concentration at which no significant
Interferent
interference was observed
Bilirubin (Conjugated and Unconjugated) 60 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid 500 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 500 mg/dL
Intralipid 1382 mg/dL

The claimed measuring range is from 9 to 1200 U/L.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability: The Pointe Creatine Kinase Assay is traceable to the IFCC reference method.
6. Detection Limit:
Limits of detection studies were performed following the recommendations in the CLSI
EP17-A2 guideline. Each study was performed on one Mindray BA-800M.
The limit of blank (LoB) study analyzed 60 saline samples and was determined as the 95th
percentile of the measurements of the blank samples. The LoB was determined to be 2 U/L.
The limit of detection (LoD) was determined using low-level depleted serum and lithium
heparin plasma samples per the classical approach described in the CLSI guideline. The LoD
was determined to be 4 U/L.
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) describes the lowest amount of creatine kinase that can be
determined quantitatively within a defined precision (<20% CV). A series of 5 low activity
samples were each run in 8 replicates over a range of 5 days using a single lot of reagent. The
LoQ was determined to be 9 U/L.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Two studies, one comparing serum specimens and one comparing lithium heparin plasma
specimens, were performed. For the study using serum samples, a total of 120 deidentified
serum samples were tested in duplicate using the candidate device and the predicate device
across the assay range of 9–1188 U/L. Of these samples, 4 were altered by mixing two
samples together to obtain an analyte level within the measurement range. The first replicate
obtained with the candidate and predicate devices for each sample was used in the analysis.
Deming regression analysis gave the following equation:
Y = 1.041 X – 5.2 U/L, r = 0.9991
For the study using plasma samples, a total of 123 deidentified lithium heparin plasma
samples were tested in duplicate using the candidate device and the predicate device across
the assay range of 9–1119 U/L. Of these samples, 2 were altered by mixing two samples
together to obtain an analyte level within the measurement range. The first replicate obtained
with the candidate and predicate devices for each sample was used in the analysis. Deming
regression analysis gave the following equation:

--- Page 6 ---
Y = 1.032 X – 0.4 U/L, r = 0.9946
2. Matrix Comparison:
Not applicable. The results from the performance studies described above support the
sponsor’s claim that human serum and lithium heparin plasma specimens are acceptable
sample types to be used with this assay.
C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
2. Clinical Specificity:
Not applicable
3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Not applicable
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not applicable
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
This information is the same as for the predicate device. The expected values in an adult population
are 30-223 U/L creatine kinase. The labeling also states that the reference range should serve
only as a guideline. It is recommended that each laboratory establish its own range of expected
values, since differences exist between instruments, laboratories and local populations.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
