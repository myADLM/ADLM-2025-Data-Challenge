III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The i-STAT CHEM8+ cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System is intended for use in the in vitro
quantification of total carbon dioxide in arterial or venous whole blood in point of care or
clinical laboratory settings.
Carbon dioxide measurements are used in the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of numerous
potentially serious disorders associated with changes in body acid-base balance.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For Point-of-Care or clinical laboratory setting
D Special Instrument Requirements:
i-STAT 1 Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The i-STAT 1 System consists of the i-STAT 1 Analyzer, the i-STAT cartridges and accessories
(i-STAT 1 Downloader/Recharger, electronic simulator and portable printer) and the i-STAT test
cartridges. The system is designed for use by trained medical professionals at the patient point of
care or in the clinical laboratory and is for prescription use only.
The i-STAT 1 Analyzer (previously cleared under k103195 as the i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer)
is a handheld analytical device designed to run i-STAT test cartridges. The instrument interacts
with the cartridge to move fluid across the sensors and generate a quantitative result.
The single-use, disposable i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge contains test reagents to analyze
whole blood at the point of care or in the clinical laboratory for total carbon dioxide and other
analytes. The cartridge format allows all the tests in the cartridge to be performed
simultaneously. The cartridges contain the required sensors, a fluid pouch, a sample entry well
and closure, fluid channels, waste chamber, and the necessary mechanical features for controlled
fluid movement within the cartridge. Cartridges require two to three drops of whole blood which
are typically applied to the cartridge using a transfer device, by the trained user before the
cartridge is placed within the analyzer.

B Principle of Operation:
TCO2 is a potentiometric test in the i-STAT CHEM8+ Cartridge. Potentiometry is the
measurement of difference in potential that exists between an active working sensor and an
independent reference sensor. Both these sensors need to be present within the same cartridge for
a potentiometric test to give a result. The active working sensor responds to change in the
activity (concentration) of the substance to be measured when the sample contacts that active
working sensor. The potential of the reference electrode does not change because it is not in
contact with patient sample. A potential (or voltage) corresponding to the analyte concentration
is generated at the active working sensor and measured by the i-STAT analyzer. The test
concentrations are calculated from the measured potential through the Nernst equation. The
Nernst equation relates the measured potential to the activity of the ion being measured. The
measured TCO2 test method is calibrated to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry
(IFCC) TCO2 reference method with an algorithm based on the Henderson-Hasselbalch
equation, which uses pH, PCO2, and ionic strength (Na) measurements.

Internal site precision (whole blood)
A single site precision study was conducted using samples targeted to three levels within the
test reportable range. Venous whole blood collected in lithium heparinized tubes from a
healthy subject was altered via tonometry to prepare the different sample levels. The samples
were tested using one lot of i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridges and 35 i-STAT 1 Analyzers.
The results of the whole blood precision are shown below.

Point of Care precision (aqueous control material)
A three site precision study was performed using a panel of five aqueous control solutions
containing different levels of TCO2. Each sample was assayed at each site once per day for
five days across each of six analyzers for a total of 90 measurements. At each site, all testing
was conducted by three operators with one per site using one lot of i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue)
cartridges. The results were analyzed for within-day (between-analyzer), within-site, and
overall (summation of between-site, between-day and between-analyzer) variance
components and provided in the table below:

Point of Care precision (whole blood)
A whole blood repeatability analysis was conducted using the data collected across three
point of care sites. Two hundred and seventy-nine samples (178 venous and 101 arterial)
were measured in duplicate using 3 lots of i-STAT CHEM8+ cartridges and 18 i-STAT 1
Analyzers by multiple POC operators at each site. The mean values for each sample were
divided into four subintervals for each sample type taking into consideration the medical
decision levels of 6, 20, and 33 mmol/L.

2. Linearity:
The linearity of the TCO2 assay on the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge was evaluated
based on the recommendations in CLSI EP06-A. For this study, the sample preparation
recommended in the CLSI EP06-A guidance was not followed. Due to the sample
preparation process and in order to limit degassing, the intermediate levels were prepared
individually rather than mixing high and low samples. Nine venous whole blood samples
collected in lithium heparin tubes spanning the reportable range for the i-STAT TCO2 were
prepared through a process of tonometry and acid/base addition. Each sample was measured
in replicates of 15 using five lots of i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridges on 39 i-STAT 1
Analyzers. Results of the linear regression analysis are presented in the table below.
Analyte Range Tested Slope Intercept R 2
(mmol/L) (mmol/L)
TCO2 3.56 - 52.26 1.028 -0.126 0.9938
The linearity study data supports the claimed measuring range for the TCO2 assay of 5 – 50
mmol/L.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity of the i-STAT TCO2 assay on the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue)
cartridge was established following the recommendations in CLSI EP07-A2. Interference
testing was conducted using lithium heparin venous whole blood samples prepared by
tonometry to high and low levels of TCO2. The effect of each substance at each TCO2 level
was evaluated by comparing the performance of a test sample spiked to a high concentration
of the substance and a control sample spiked with an equal volume of solvent. A substance
was identified as an interferent if the difference between the spiked test sample and the
control was greater than the allowable error defined as the greater of 4 mmol/L or 10% of the
mean TCO2 result for the control sample.
The following table lists the concentrations of each substance at which no significant
interference was found.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
See section A.2 Linearity
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
The i-STAT test for TCO2 is metrologically traceable to the IFCC TCO2 reference method1.
Due to direct traceability to this TCO2 reference method, the CHEM8+ is independent of the
pH and PCO2 traceability.

289.
6. Detection Limit:
The detection limits are supported by the linearity study (please see section 2 above). In
addition, a limit of quantitation (LoQ) study TCO2 on the i-STAT CHEM8+ Cartridge with
the i-STAT 1 Analyzer was conducted following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
The LoQ for TCO2 was evaluating using lithium heparin venous whole blood samples
collected from a healthy subject each day. The samples were altered via tonometry and pH
adjustment to levels below the lower limit of the reportable range and the TCO2
concentration was value assigned using a reference method. Each sample was measure in 15
replicates per day for four days across each of two i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge lots for
a total of 120 cartridges. The LoQ was calculated for each of the two lots. The sponsor
defined LoQ as the greater of the two lots at which the lowest concentration met the pre-
defined total error goal of ≤ 4.00 mmol/L. The LoQ was determined to be 4 mmol/L, which
is below the lower limit of the reportable range (5 – 50 mmol/L).
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The accuracy of the TCO2 assay on the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge on the i-STAT 1
Analyzer was evaluated by a method comparison study for agreement with the predicate
device. The study was conducted across three point of care sites. A total of 294 specimens,
183 lithium heparin venous whole blood specimens and 111 lithium heparin arterial whole
blood specimens were tested. Twenty-one of 294 samples (7.14%) were contrived. The data
