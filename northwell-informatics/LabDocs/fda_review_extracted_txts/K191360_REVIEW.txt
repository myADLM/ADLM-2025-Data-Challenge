D Special Instrument Requirements:
i-STAT 1 Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The i-STAT 1 System consists of the i-STAT 1 Analyzer and the i-STAT CHEM+ (blue)
cartridges. The system is designed for use by trained medical professionals at the patient point of
care or in the clinical laboratory and is for prescription use only.
The i-STAT 1 Analyzer (previously cleared under k103195 as the i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer)
is a handheld device designed to run only i-STAT test cartridges. The instrument interacts with
the cartridge to move fluid across the sensors and generate a quantitative result.
The single-use, disposable i-STAT CHEM8+ cartridge contains test reagents to analyze whole
blood at the point of care or in the clinical laboratory for ionized calcium and other analytes. The
cartridge format allows all the tests in the cartridge to be performed simultaneously. The
cartridges contain the required sensors, a fluid pouch, a sample entry well and closure, fluid
channels, waste chamber, and the necessary mechanical features for controlled fluid movement
within the cartridge. Cartridges require two to three drops of whole blood which are typically
applied to the cartridge using a transfer device, by the trained user before the cartridge is placed
within the analyzer.
K191360 - Page 2 of 11

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
The sensors are microfabricated thin film electrodes on a silicon chip. A lead line connects the
sensors to contact pads. The sensors and lead line are contained within the cartridge; the contact
pads are exposed to allow direct contact with the analyzer. The contact pads conduct the signals
generated by the sensors to the analyzer. The analyzer connects to the contact pads of the sensor
via contact pins that lower inside the analyzer upon insertion of the cartridge. When the sensor
generates an electrical signal (in response to contact with the patient sample and the presence or
absence of each analyte of interest), the signal is carried by the lead line to the contact pad where
the signal generated by the sensor is read by the analyzer.
Ion selective methods are based on the measurement of potential difference (voltage) between
the ion selective electrode and the reference electrode (both are found on the biosensors within
the cartridge). The biosensor chips convert the activity of the ion dissolved in the patient sample
into an electrical signal which can be measured. The concentration of ionized calcium and other
analytes in the patient sample is calculated (derived from the Nernst equation) from the
difference between the patient sample and the calibrant solution electrical signals.

An internal precision study was conducted with lithium heparinized venous whole blood
samples. Whole blood from a healthy subject (normal sample) was collected in lithium
heparinized tubes and altered to create a low abnormal sample and a high abnormal sample.
Each sample (high abnormal, normal, and low abnormal) was tested with one lot of
CHEM8+ cartridges on 54 i-STAT 1 Analyzers. The results are shown below.

Point of Care precision - aqueous control material
A three-site precision study was performed using a panel of five levels of aqueous control
solutions, containing a different level of ionized calcium. Each sample was assayed at each
site once per day for five days across each of six i-STAT 1 Analyzers for a total of 90
measurements. At each site, all testing was conducted by one operator using 6 i-STAT 1
Analyzers and one lot of i-STAT CHEM8+ cartridges for a total of 90 measurements. The
results were analyzed for within-day, within-site, and overall (summation of within-day and
within-site) and provided in the tables below:

Point of Care precision - whole blood
A whole blood repeatability analysis was conducted using the data collected across three
point of care sites. One hundred and thirty-two (132) whole blood venous samples and 109
whole blood arterial samples were measured in duplicate using one lots of i-STAT CHEM8+
cartridges and 23 i-STAT 1 Analyzers by multiple POC operators at each site. The mean
values for each sample were divided into four subintervals for each sample type based on the
lower and upper limits of the reference range (1.12-1.32 mmol/L). Note that these estimates
of SDs and %CVs present the estimates of repeatability together with variability from
different analyzers.

2. Linearity:
The linearity of the ionized calcium assay on i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge was
evaluated following the recommendations in CLSI EP06-A. Lithium heparin venous whole
blood was obtained from a healthy subject and was altered to produce a high sample pool and
a low sample pool. Samples of intermediate concentrations were prepared by intermixing the
low and high pools. Each sample was measured in replicates of three using five lots of i-
STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridges. An assessment of linearity was performed using
polynomial regression analysis.
For ionized calcium, regression analysis found that at each level, the deviation from linearity
was 0.003 mmol/L or 0.27%.
Linear regression analysis results for all five lots combined are presented in the tables below.
Ionized calcium:
Range tested (mmol/L) Slope Intercept R2
0.25 – 2.82 0.988 0.031 0.9992
The observed proportional response supports the claim that the ionized calcium assay on the
i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) are linear across the following measurement range: 0.25 - 2.50
mmol/L.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity of the ionized calcium assay on the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue)
cartridge was established by conducting interference studies following the recommendations
in CLSI EP07-ED3 and CLSI EP37. Interference from certain exogenous and endogenous
substances was assessed using lithium heparin venous whole blood spiked at two
concentrations of the ionized calcium at low and high: 1.15±0.10 mmol/L and 1.50±0.10

mmol/L. Each low and high sample was further divided into two aliquots: control (with no
added interferent) and test (with added interferent). Each sample was measured in replicates
of 10 using one lot of the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridges. A substance was identified as
an interferent if the difference in the means between the control and spiked test samples was
outside of the predefined allowable error of ±0.05 mmol/L or ±5%. For any substances
identified as an interferent, a dose response analysis was performed to assess the highest
concentration without significant error, as defined above.
The following table lists the concentrations of each substance at which no significant
interference was found:

The sponsor includes the following statements in the labeling for the device and relevant
literature reference:
Nithiodote (sodium thiosulfate) at ≥3.1 mmol/L shows increased sodium results. Sodium
thiosulfate is indicated for the treatment of acute cyanide poisoning. The journal article titled
“Falsely increased chloride and missed anion gap elevation during treatment with sodium
thiosulfate” indicated that sodium thiosulfate could be used in the treatment of calciphylaxis
indicating that “the highest concentration likely to be seen in plasma [is] after infusion of a
12.5 g dose of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate. Assuming that the 12.5 g dose of sodium
thiosulfate pentahydrate is distributed in a typical blood volume of 5 L with a hematocrit of
40%, the peak sodium thiosulfate plasma concentration expected is 16.7 mmol/L.
Leflunomide is an isoxazole immunomodulatory agent that inhibits dihydroorotate
dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in de novo pyrimidine synthesis, and that has
antiproliferative activity. It is used in the treatment of some immune diseases. Following oral
administration, leflunomide is metabolized to an active metabolite, teriflunomide, which is
responsible for essentially all its in vivo activity. The active metabolite teriflunomide reaches
a plasma concentration of 8.5 μg/mL (0.031 mmol/L) after a 100 mg loading dose and the
steady state concentration is maintained at 63 μg/mL (0.23 mmol/L) after 24 weeks of
maintenance dose at 25 mg/day (16) when treating inflammatory polyarthropathy.
Thiocyanate is a major metabolite of cyanide produced in the liver. The cyanide compound
sodium nitroprusside may be used in emergency medical situations to produce a rapid
decrease in blood pressure in humans and most of the cyanide produced during metabolism
of sodium nitroprusside is eliminated in the form of thiocyanate. Additionally, cyanide
elimination is accelerated by the co-infusion of thiosulfate, thiocyanate production is
increased as in the case of thiosulphate treatment of cyanide poisoning. The highest drug
concentration under therapeutic treatment reported by CLSI EP37 is 0.299 mmol/L.
However, concentrations in patients receiving nitroprusside and co-infusion of thiosulfate
may be much higher. Thiocyanate is mildly neurotoxic (tinnitus, miosis, hyperreflexia) at
serum levels of 1 mmol/L. Thiocyanate toxicity is life-threatening when levels are 3 or 4
times higher. Thiocyanate concentrations greater than 0.874 mmol/L will lead to falsely low
ionized calcium results.

6. Detection Limit:
Detection capability studies of limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and a limit of
quantitation (LoQ) for the ionized calcium assay on the i-STAT CHEM8+ cartridge with the
i-STAT 1 Analyzer was conducted following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2.
LoB
The LoB for the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge for the ionized calcium assay was
evaluated using lithium heparin venous whole blood samples that were collected from four
healthy subjects, each altered to create a blank sample. Each sample was tested in 20
replicates using two i-STAT CHEM8+ lots for a total of 40 test results per sample. Testing
was conducted by five operators over three days. The LoB was calculated using a parametric
data analysis for each of the two lots. The higher of the two LoB values from each lot is
reported in the labeling as the LoB.
LoD
The LoD for ionized calcium was evaluated using lithium heparin venous whole blood
samples that were collected four healthy subjects of different days and altered to two low
samples. Each sample was tested in 20 replicates using two i-STAT CHEM8+ lots for a total
of 40 test results per sample. Testing was conducted by five operators over three days. The
LoD was calculated using a parametric data analysis for each of the two lots. The higher of
the two LoD values from each lot is reported in the labeling as the LoD.
LoQ
The LoQ for ionized calcium was evaluated using four lithium heparin venous blood samples
that were collected each day from a unique healthy subject over four days. The whole blood
samples were altered to low concentrations each day. Each of the four samples was measured
in 15 replicates per day for four days across each of two i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge
lots for a total of 120 cartridges. The sponsor defined LoQ as the greater of the two lots at
which the lowest concentration met the pre-defined total error goal of 0.05 mmol/L.
The results are summarized in the table below.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The accuracy of the ionized calcium assay with the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge on the
i-STAT 1 Analyzer was evaluated by a method comparison study for agreement with the
predicate device. The study was conducted across three point of care sites. A total of 250
specimens, 136 lithium heparin venous whole blood specimens and 114 lithium heparin
arterial whole blood specimens were tested. Twenty four of 250 samples (9.6%) were
contrived. The data were analyzed by Passing-Bablok regression analysis comparing the first
replicate of the candidate deice results to the singlicate result of the predicate device.
