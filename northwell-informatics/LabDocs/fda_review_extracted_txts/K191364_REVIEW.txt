B Indication(s) for Use:
The T-TAS 01 Instrument is intended for use with T-TAS reagent chips in the clinical
laboratory.
The T-TAS 01 PL chip is intended for use in the clinical laboratory for the analysis of the
platelet thrombus formation process (primary hemostatic function) in patients age 21 and older
with a history of conditions associated with impaired primary hemostatic function or use of
antiplatelet therapy. The test uses BAPA-anticoagulated whole blood specimens to measure
platelet adhesion to a thrombogenic collagen-coated surface and aggregation, which causes an
increase in flow pressure inside the PL chip. The test measures primary hemostatic function as
the area under the pressure-time curve (AUC), with AUC < 260 suggesting abnormal primary
hemostatic function. Additional testing may be necessary to identify the cause(s) of abnormal
primary hemostatic function. The test has been evaluated in patients taking antiplatelet therapy,
in patients with von Willebrand disease, and in patients with Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia. Other
primary hemostasis disorders have not been evaluated.
The BAPA tube for T-TAS 01 is intended to be used for the collection, transport, and storage of
blood specimens for use with the T-TAS 01 system.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
• Rx - For Prescription Use Only
• Additional testing may be necessary to identify the cause(s) of a primary hemostasis
defect.
• The BAPA tube is used for the collection, transport, and storage of blood specimens for
use with the T-TAS 01 system.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The T-TAS 01 system is an automated platelet function system. It consists of a tabletop
instrument controlled by a dedicated PC, a disposable, single-use flow chamber microchip, and
anticoagulant collection tubes with benzylsulfonyl-D-Arg-Pro-4-amidinobenzylamide (BAPA).
The PL Chip for T-TAS 01 contains a collagen-coated analytical path consisting of 26
microcapillary channels.
B Principle of Operation:
The assay is performed using BAPA-anticoagulated whole blood samples. BAPA inhibits
thrombin and factor Xa. During the assay, the blood sample is exposed to arterial shear stresses
at 1500 s-1 in the presence of a collagen-coated surface, which causes platelet attachment to
collagen mediated by von Willebrand factor (vWF) and platelet activation. Platelet activation
causes the release of endogenous factors that recruit and activate other platelets and cause
aggregation, or platelet thrombus formation (PTF) and growth.
K191364 - Page 2 of 14

--- Page 3 ---
PTF causes occlusion of the microcapillary channels, which increases the flow pressure within
the assay chip. The process of PTF in the flow chamber is continuously monitored by a pressure
sensor that tracks pressure changes in the flow path. After the start button is pressed, the blood
sample is injected into the chip at a high flow rate for the purpose of moving blood samples into
the chip and past the microcapillaries without creating air bubbles. After the initial step, the
assay begins, using a set flow rate. The flow pressure readings subtract the base pressure and are
plotted in the pressure waveform graph. The assay is completed at 10 minutes or when the
occlusion pressure reaches 60 kPa, whichever occurs first. The area under the flow pressure
curve (AUC) over 10 minutes is automatically calculated. The end users will see the pressure
waveform graph and the AUC results.
AUC results less than 260 are associated with abnormal primary hemostasis.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision:
a. Repeatability Study
The repeatability study was performed at a single laboratory. Three unique venous blood
samples representing different AUC levels (low, middle, high) were tested on either two
of the three T-TAS 01 instruments. A normal donor provided the sample with normal
primary hemostatic ability (high). Two donors taking aspirin provided specimens with
primary hemostatic ability around the assay cutoff (middle) and abnormal primary
hemostatic ability (low). Each sample was analyzed in duplicate on three PL chip lots and
two T-TAS 01 instruments by three different trained operators. The results met the pre-
defined acceptance criteria.

chip lot and one T-TAS 01 instrument. The four donor types used in the study are as
follows, considering inter-individual variability in response to aspirin:
Donor AUC Result Category Aspirin Use Aspirin Response
(AUC < 260 = Abnormal)
1 Normal No N/A
2 Normal Yes Poor Response
3 High Abnormal Yes Medium Response
4 Low Abnormal Yes High Response
The study evaluated the within-run and between-day precision. Since different donors
were recruited at each site for the precision study, results were not pooled across days or
donors due to natural inter- and intra-individual variability in response to aspirin. The
pre-defined acceptance criteria were. All results met the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

blood samples taken from a normal donor (AUC ≥ 260) and a donor taking aspirin (AUC <
260). There were at least four replicate measurements for each control and test blood sample.
The following endogenous and exogenous interfering substances were evaluated and showed
no significant interference up to the specified concentration in the venous whole blood
samples collected in the BAPA tubes.
Compound Concentration Compound Concentration
Acetaminophen 7.8 mg/dL Heparin 525 U/mL
Bilirubin 40 mg/dL L-Thyroxine 0.0858 mg/dL
Caffeine 21.6 mg/dL Metformin 2.4 mg/dL
Captopril 0.528 mg/dL Omeprazole 1.68 mg/dL
Catechin 5 mg/dL Pravastatin 0.414 mg/dL
Cilostazol 1.25 mg/dL Propranolol 0.202 mg/dL

Dipyridamole 0.25 mg/dL Triglycerides 750 mg/dL
Fish Oil 25.6 mg/dL Warfarin 7.5 mg/dL
Ibuprofen 0.438 mg/dL
Cilostazol, dipyridamole, ibuprofen and tirofiban are known to reduce platelet activity in a
dose-dependent manner. The maximum tirofiban concentration without interference was not
determined.
Hemolysis significantly affects assay AUC results due to shear-induced platelet activation
and aggregation. Therefore, a statement is included in the package insert to alert the user not
to use hemolyzed specimens when performing the T-TAS 01 PL assay.
There was no significant hemodilution effect on AUC results up to 20%.
There was no significant effect of under-filling the BAPA blood collection tube on AUC
results up to 50%.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range and the analytical measurement range for the T-TAS 01 assay were
determined upon the range of clinical samples as 0.3–467.7. However, the numeric output of

with normal primary hemostatic ability into BAPA-anticoagulated tubes. Three PL
chip lots were tested and two PL chips from each lot were removed from their
pouches and stored at ambient temperature for the following durations prior to
testing: <5 minutes, 4 hour, 6 hours, 8 hours and 10 hours. Each chip was tested with
normal donor blood in quadruplicate. The “<5 minute” condition serves as the control
condition for comparison. The data support a stability claim of up to 8 hours at
ambient temperature after PL chip removal from the pouch.
Closed-pouch stability studies were isochronously performed to characterize the
stability of PL chips when stored in sealed pouches under refrigeration (2–8˚C).
Venous whole blood samples were collected into BAPA-anticoagulated tubes from
two healthy donors with normal primary hemostatic ability and a native donor with
abnormal AUC result. Three PL chip lots were tested. Two PL chips from each lot
were tested following the tested storage condition at the following durations after
their manufacture: 0–13 months. Each chip was tested with each blood sample in
quadruplicate. The control condition was a fresh PL chip lot that was newly
manufactured prior to the testing timepoint. The data support a stability claim of 12
months when stored at 2–8˚C.
ii. Blood sample stability
The stability of BAPA-anticoagulated blood specimens stored at room temperature
was tested by collecting venous whole blood samples from two healthy normal
donors and two subjects taking aspirin with abnormal primary hemostatic function.
Blood samples were stored upright at room temperature for 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2
hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, and 24 hours prior to testing. Three T-TAS 01
instruments and one lot of PL chips were used in the test. Six replicate measurements
were performed for each tested time point. The control condition was established as
30 minutes after sample collection. Results were averaged prior to analysis. Each
condition was compared to the control condition by calculating the % of control for
the average of the replicates. The results demonstrate that BAPA-anticoagulated
venous blood samples are stable for up to 6 hours after collection.
6. Detection Limit:

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The method comparison study was performed to compare the performance of T-TAS 01 PL
assay to the predicate device PFA-100 assay. Both assays evaluated 25 patients with vWD
and three patients with GT. The predicate device involves the measurement of the
collagen/epinephrine (Col/Epi) cartridge and collagen/ADP (Col/ADP) cartridge. The result
interpretation was according to the PFA-100 test cartridge package insert. The following
table demonstrates the percent positive, percent negative and overall agreement between the
T-TAS 01 PL assay and the PFA-100 assay for the vWD and GT patients.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Six investigational sites recruited 142 healthy subjects, 57 patients on aspirin (81-mg ASA)
monotherapy, 47 subjects taking dual antiplatelet therapy (18 subjects on clopidogrel and
ASA, 15 subjects on prasugrel and ASA, and 14 subjects on ticagrelor and ASA), 25 vWD
patients and three GT patients. Among vWD patients, there were 12 patients with Type 1, 10
patients with Type 2 and three patients with Type 3. The study was to evaluate the sensitivity
and specificity of the T-TAS 01 PL assay to detect conditions associated with the abnormal
primary hemostatic function. At each investigational site, blood samples were tested in
duplicate using BAPA-anticoagulated whole blood samples. Measurements were performed
within four hours of sample collection. The first measurement was used for the data analysis.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
Three clinical sites recruited 142 healthy adult subjects to establish the reference range for the T-
TAS 01 PL assay. At each testing site, blood samples were tested in duplicate using BAPA-
anticoagulated whole blood samples. Measurements were performed within four hours of sample
collection. The first measurement was used for the data analysis. The central 90% reference
interval is 270.0–447.7. Measurements from a separate group of 20 healthy subjects validated the
established reference interval (302.5–429.1).
F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. BAPA blood collection tube validation
a. BAPA tube vacuum performance
The BAPA tube vacuum performance was conducted to demonstrate the stability of the
tube vacuum at ambient temperature. BAPA tubes from three production lots were stored
at room temperature. The tube vacuum was measured by allowing the tube to fill with
water, measuring the weight of the water inside the tube and converting the weight
(gram) to volume (mL). Five replicate measurements were performed for each condition.
The study is on-going. Current results support the vacuum present in the BAPA tube for
T-TAS 01 is stable for 10 months.
b. BAPA tube anticoagulant fill
The BAPA tube anticoagulant fill study was conducted to determine the consistency of
BAPA anticoagulant added to the BAPA tube for the T-TAS 01 system. Three lots of the
BAPA tubes were used and ten replicate measurements were performed for each lot. The
results demonstrated that the amount of BAPA anticoagulant added to the BAPA tube for
the T-TAS 01 system is consistent.
c. Sterilization

The BAPA tube was sterilized by gamma irradiation. Sterilization validation was
conducted and concluded that there is a 1 in 1,000,000 possibility that the product is not
sterile.
d. Transportation stress test
Transport stress test was conducted to demonstrate the stability of BAPA tubes after
transportation. The randomly selected samples were put on the oscillation device for
three days (frequency at 150 times/min) to simulate the bumping situation in
transportation. The device was also exposed to high temperature (40˚C) and high
humidity (80% relative humidity) for 30 days. The test results support the stability of
BAPA tubes after transportation.
