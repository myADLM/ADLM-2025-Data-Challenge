B Measurand:
Sodium, Potassium and Chloride
C Type of Test:
Quantitative, potentiometric, ion selective electrode technology.
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Stat Profile Prime ES Comp Plus Analyzer System is intended for in vitro diagnostic use by
health care professionals in clinical laboratory settings for the quantitative determination of
sodium, potassium, and chloride in heparinized venous whole blood, plasma and serum.
Sodium measurement is used in the diagnosis and treatment of aldosteronism, diabetes insipidus,
adrenal hypertension, Addison’s disease, dehydration, or diseases involving electrolyte
imbalance.
Potassium measurement is used to monitor electrolyte balance in the diagnosis and treatment of
disease conditions characterized by low or high potassium levels.
Chloride measurement is used in the diagnosis and treatment of electrolyte and metabolic
disorders such as cystic fibrosis and diabetic acidosis.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Not for Point-of-care use
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Stat Profile Prime ES Comp Plus Analyzer System
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Stat Profile Prime ES Comp Plus Analyzer System is designed to be used in a clinical
laboratory setting. The analyzer consists of, sensor cartridges, calibrator packs, ampuled quality
control materials (external controls) and thermal paper for an onboard printer. Specimens are
identified by scanning a barcode or by manually entering the information via the touchscreen.
K191365 - Page 2 of 13

--- Page 3 ---
The Stat Profile Prime ES Comp Plus Analyzer has slots to accommodate two sensor cartridges
(primary and auxiliary). The analyzer will determine the configuration of the system by detecting
which sensor cards are installed.
B Principle of Operation:
The sodium, potassium, and chloride parameters are measured by an ion-selective electrode
(ISE) that selectively measures the activity of ionic species. When the ISE comes in contact with
a sample, a potential is developed. This potential is proportional to the logarithm of the ionic
activity and is measured versus a reference electrode, as described by the Nernst equation.

1. Instrument Name:
Stat Profile Prime ES Comp Plus Analyzer System
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimen may be identified by scanning a barcode or by manually entering the information
via the touchscreen.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Lithium heparinized venous whole blood from syringes and open blood collection tubes or
containers can be aspirated by positioning the sample over a probe . Plasma and serum
samples from open containers can be sampled over a probe or using the tray mode.
4. Calibration:
The Analyzer has an automated calibrator which is used to perform a 2-point calibration 30
minutes after being powered on and regularly thereafter to maintain optimal Sensor Card and
air detector performance. Then a 1-point calibration is performed at regular intervals to
monitor the Sensor Card’s performance between each 2-point calibration.

2. Linearity:
The linearity studies were performed following the CLSI EP6-A guideline. The studies were
performed on three analyzers using lithium heparinized venous whole blood, plasma and
serum . Low and high concentration pools were mixed and serial dilution samples (N=10 or
11) were prepared and tested in triplicate. The results from each candidate analyzer for each
parameter were compared to expected values. All three analyzers yielded similar results. The
results of the least squares linear regression analysis from one representative analyzer are
summarized below:

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A3 guideline. The sponsor
collected serum sample and plasma from donors. Samples were divided to create two
separate pools one for control and the other for test samples. The potential interferents were
tested at two analyte concentrations. If interference was identified, then a dose response was
performed to determine the lowest concentration where the interfering substance may alter
the results. For all analytes, the sponsor defined interference as > ± 10% bias from the test
results when compared to the control sample. The sponsor determined the following
substances did not cause interference at the concentrations listed below:
Sodium:

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed by testing a minimum of one hundred and fifty
lithium heparin whole blood samples and a minimum of one hundred samples for serum and
lithium heparin plasma on one Stat Profile Prime ES Comp Plus Analyzer (candidate device)
and two Stat Profile pHOx Ultra Analyzers (predicate device) for each parameter. In order to
cover the extreme ends of the claimed measuring range a limited number of specimens were
spiked or diluted . The singlet result from each test analyzer was compared to the average of
the results from the comparative method.
The linear regression analyses for the three electrolytes are summarized below:
