III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Yumizen C1200 Calcium AS reagent is a diagnostic reagent for quantitative in vitro
determination of calcium in human serum, plasma and urine based on colorimetric method, using
the clinical chemistry analyzer. Measurement of calcium is used in the diagnosis and treatment
of parathyroid disease, a variety of bone diseases, chronic renal disease and tetany (intermittent
muscular contractions or spasms).
Yumizen C1200 Creatinine Jaffé reagent is a diagnostic reagent for quantitative in vitro
determination of creatinine in human serum, plasma and urine based on a kinetic method using
alkaline picrate (Jaffé method). Creatinine measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment
of renal diseases, in monitoring renal dialysis, and as a calculation basis for measuring other
urine analytes.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Yumizen C1200 Calcium AS:
Do not use EDTA plasma: EDTA anticoagulant is unsuitable for analysis because this
compounds chelates calcium, making it unavailable for reaction with the reagent.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Yumizen C1200
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Yumizen C1200 Calcium AS assay consists of the following reagents:
50 mmol/L Phosphate buffer (pH = 7.50)
5 mmol/L 8- Hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid
120 µmol/L Arsenazo III
The Yumizen C1200 Creatinine Jaffé assay consists of the following reagents:
0.2 mol/L Sodium hydroxide
20 mmol/L Picric acid
K191396 - Page 2 of 14

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
Yumizen C1200 Calcium AS test is a photometric test using Arsenazo III die. Calcium in the
sample binds to Arsenazo III at neutral pH yielding a blue colored complex, whose intensity is
proportional to the calcium concentration. Interference by magnesium is eliminated by addition
of 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid.
Yumizen C1200 Creatinine Jaffé is a kinetic test without deproteinization according to the Jaffé
method. Creatinine from the sample forms a colored orange-red complex in an alkaline picrate
solution. The difference in absorbance at fixed times during conversion is proportional to the
concentration of creatinine in the sample.

2. Linearity:
Linearity studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP06-A guideline.
For each analyte and sample type a series of 10 samples was prepared by combining various
volumetric proportions of a low-level analyte sample to a high analyte concentration to
produce samples with concentrations spanning the corresponding claimed measuring interval.
Each level was measured in 4 replicates using 1 instrument and 1 lot of reagent.
Experimentally determined values were compared to expected values using linear regression
analysis. The results of the linearity studies supported the claimed measuring ranges, as
summarized below:
Sample Measuring Concentrations
Analyte Linear regression
type Range tested
Calcium Serum y = 1.020 x – 0.065, R2 = 0.9996 4.0 – 18.05 0.00 – 19.41
(mg/dL) Urine y = 1.002 x + 0.003, R2 = 0.9995 0.64 – 18.05 0.00 – 20.65
Creatinine Serum y = 1.021 x + 0.003, R2 = 0.9995 0.23 – 18.08 0.00 – 25.16
(mg/dL) Urine y = 0.968 x + 0.112, R2 = 0.9995 3.0 – 282.5 0.00 -333.70
The sponsor also performed a study to evaluate the auto-dilute feature available for serum
and urine calcium and creatinine measurements. The study protocol and acceptance criteria
were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The results of the study supported the sponsor’s
claim that samples with calcium concentrations above 18.05 mg/dL can be diluted onboard
the analyzer to obtain results up to 54.15 mg/dL for serum and urine. The results of the study
also support the sponsor’s claim that samples with creatinine concentrations above 18.08
mg/dL (serum) or 282.5 mg/dL (urine) can be diluted onboard the analyzer to obtain results
up to 54.24 mg/dL for serum samples and up to 847.5 mg/dL for urine samples.

6. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) studies
were performed according to the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
Yumizen C1200 Calcium AS:
Limit of blank (LoB) study was performed by testing 4 individual blank serum samples,
using two reagent lots over 5 days on a single instrument (or 5 individual blank urine samples
using two reagent lots over 4 days on a single instrument). Each day, for each reagent lot, 4
replicate measurements were recorded (80 results per reagent lot). Data was analyzed using
non-parametric analysis.
Limit of detection (LoD) study was performed by testing 4 low level serum samples and 4
low level urine samples using two reagent lots over 4 days on a single instrument. Each day,
for each reagent lot, 4 replicate measurements were recorded (64 results per reagent lot).
Data was analyzed using non-parametric analysis.
Limit of quantitation (LoQ) study was performed by testing 5 low level serum samples (or 5
low level urine samples) using 2 reagent lots over 4 days on a single instrument. Each day,
for each reagent lot, 4 replicate measurements were recorded (80 results per reagent lot). The
LoQ for calcium met an imprecision ≤ 20% CV.
Yumizen C1200 Creatinine Jaffé:
Limit of blank (LoB) study was performed by testing 1 blank sample, using two reagent lots
over 4 days on 3 instrument systems. Each day, for each reagent lot and each instrument, 5
replicate measurements were recorded (60 results per reagent lot). Data was analyzed using
non-parametric analysis.

Not applicable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Devices:
Performance of the Yumizen C1200 Calcium AS reagent for serum and urine was compared
with the predicate device, ABX Pentra Calcium AS CP reagent (k123171). A total of 166
native serum samples and a total of 105 native urine samples were assayed in duplicate over
5 days. Only the first replicate was used for data analysis, which was conducted using
Passing-Bablok regression.
Performance of the Yumizen C1200 Creatinine Jaffé reagent for serum and urine was
compared with the predicate device, ABX Pentra Creatinine 120 CP reagent (k110530). A
total of 131 native serum samples and a total of 148 native urine samples with creatinine
concentrations were assayed in duplicate over 5 days. Only the first replicate was used for
data analysis, which was conducted using Passing-Bablok regression.
