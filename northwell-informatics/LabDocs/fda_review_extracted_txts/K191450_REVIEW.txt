The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER'S previously cleared devices: Dexcom G6
Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) System (K183206), Dexcom G6 Glucose Program
CGM System (K182041) and Dexcom Pro Q CGM System (K182405).
1. Submitter's statement that the INDICATIONS FOR USE/INTENDED USE of the
modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed
labeling which includes instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available,
advertisements or promotional materials (labeling changes are permitted as long as they do
not affect the intended use).
2. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams,
engineering drawings, photographs, user's and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to
demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified
device has not changed. This change was for:
a. A new adhesive patch that will be used to attach the transmitter to the user’s body.
The new adhesive patch has a different adhesive, release liner and ink compared
to the predicate device.
b. Updated Receiver Firmware for additional battery indicator levels and associated
alerts, and improved touchscreen settings.
c. Updates to Apps to improve users displays for Apple device applications and for
Google Fit Apps as well as improvements to prevent signal loss.
3. Comparison Information (i.e., similarities and differences) to the submitter's legally marketed
predicate device including, labeling, intended use, and physical characteristics.
4. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification
on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis.
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation
activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the
indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the
submitter's description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information
between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific
technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as
specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined
substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
