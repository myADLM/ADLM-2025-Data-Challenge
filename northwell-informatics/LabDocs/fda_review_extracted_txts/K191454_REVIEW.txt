III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Atellica® CH Amylase_2 (AMY_2) assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative
determination of amylase activity in human serum, plasma (lithium heparin), and urine using the
Atellica® CH Analyzer. Such measurements are used primarily in the diagnosis and monitoring
of acute pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Atellica® CH Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Atellica® CH Amylase_2 (AMY_2) reagents are packaged in 2 packs with 2 wells per
pack. The wells have a divider which keeps the two liquid chambers separate.
Each well of Pack 1 (P1) contains 18.7 mL of Reagent 1 (R1) which consists of:
α-Glucosidase (≥ 4 kU/L); sodium azide (0.09%)
Each well of Pack 2 (P2) contains 6.5 mL of Reagent 2 (R2) which consists of:
Ethylidene-4-NP-G7 (22 mmol/L), sodium azide (0.09%)
B Principle of Operation:
The Atellica® CH AMY_2 assay uses ethylidene blocked p-nitrophenyl-maltoheptaoside as
substrate. The indicator enzyme α-glucosidase, used to release p-nitrophenol (PNP), is also
employed in the assay. The terminal glucose of the substrate is chemically blocked, preventing
cleavage by the indicator enzymes. The released p-nitrophenol is measured at 410/694 nm.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed according to the CLSI EP05-A3 Evaluation of Precision
Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods guideline. Precision was assessed by
testing each sample using two replicates, two times per day, for at least 20 days for a total of
at least 80 replicates. The samples tested were commercial controls (for both serum and
urine), spiked pools (for serum, urine, and plasma), and a diluted urine pool. The results of
precision studies are summarized below.

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was conducted based on the CLSI EP6-A Evaluation of the Linearity of
Quantitative Measurement Procedures guideline.

Nine serial dilutions were (13 U/L to 1622 U/L for serum, 12 U/L to 1720 U/L for urine)
were prepared by mixing high and low concentrations samples across the measurement
interval. Five replicates were measured for each sample, with the mean used for the
calculations.
The mean results (y-axis) were plotted against the expected results (x-axis). The results of the
linear regression analysis are as follows:
Serum (unweighted linear regression): y = 0.99826x - 3.13, R2 = 1.000
Urine (weighted linear regression): y = 0.9673x - 7.10, R2 = 0.999
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claim that the Atellica® CH Amylase_2
(AMY_2) assay is linear across the measuring range of 20 to 1500 U/L for serum and urine
specimens.
The sponsor also conducted an auto-dilution recovery study to evaluate the auto-dilute
feature available for both serum and urine matrices. Using CH diluent, 3-fold manual
dilutions of serum and urine pools were made. The study protocol and acceptance criteria
were reviewed and found to be acceptable. Results of this study supported the sponsor’s
claim that samples with amylase concentrations above 1500 U/L can be diluted onboard the
analyzer to obtain results up to 4500 U/L for serum and urine.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were performed in accordance with the CLSI EP07-A2 Interference
Testing in Clinical Chemistry guideline. Studies were conducted using a “paired difference
worst-case scenario” approach in which the compounds were spiked into fresh sample pools
(serum and urine) containing either high (400 U/L) or low (100 U/L) levels of measurand.
Test and control samples for each measurand level were tested in five replicates. The sponsor
define interference as >10% difference between the test and control samples.
The results of interference studies are summarized below.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The assay has a reportable range of 20 to 1500 U/L for serum, plasma, and urine specimens.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The Atellica® CH AMY_2 (AMY_2) assay is traceable to the IRMM/IFCC-456 Pancreatic
Alpha-Amylase Reference Material.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were
evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2 Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical
Laboratory Measurement Procedures.
LoB
Four samples with no analyte were tested in replicates of 20 for 3 days, with one run per day,
and using three reagent lots. LoB was determined using a nonparametric approach (LoB
Rank Position = 0.5 + 0.95 × B, where B = total reps = 240; rank = 228.5.)
LoD
Four low analyte samples were tested in replicates of 20 for 3 days, with one run per day,
using 3 reagent lots. LoD was determined using a nonparametric approach and corresponded
to the lowest concentration of amylase that can be detected with a probability of 95%.
LoQ
Four low analyte samples were processed in replicates of 10 on 3 reagent lots for 3 days on
one instrument for a total of 120 measurements per lot. The LoQ was defined as the
concentration that met a Total Error (TE) goal of ≤30%. TE was calculated as TE = |bias| + 2
× SD.
The results of the detection limit studies are presented in the table below:

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted by testing remnant de-identified serum and urine
samples, including native and spiked samples (less than 10%). For the serum method
comparison, one replicate was processed on the predicate device, and two were processed on
the candidate device. For the urine method comparison, two replicates were processed on
each. Only the first replicate results were used in the data analysis. Results were analyzed
using weighted Deming regression.
Results of regression analysis are summarized below.

2. Matrix Comparison:
Matched serum and lithium heparin plasma sets were processed with two replicates, using
only the first replicate for analysis. Sixty-six (66) matched serum/plasma samples that ranged
from 36 U/L (serum) to 1419 U/L (serum) were assayed in duplicate. The study set included
66 samples with concentrations ranging from 36 U/L to 1419 U/L. The results were
compared using Deming linear regression statistics. The results are as follows:
y = 1.00 x + 0, r = 1.000
The results of the study support the sponsor claims that the Atellica® CH Amylase_2
(AMY_2) can be used with serum and lithium heparin plasma samples.
