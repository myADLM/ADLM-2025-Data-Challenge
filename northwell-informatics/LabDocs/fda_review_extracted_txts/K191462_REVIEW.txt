III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Proov Test is intended for the detection of pregnanediol glucuronide (PdG, the major urine
metabolite of progesterone) and can be used as an aid for confirmation of ovulation.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not applicable
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Each Proov test kit contains seven Proov test strips that are individually sealed. Each test strip
consists of anti-PdG antibody and antigen, nitrocellulose membrane, colloidal gold conjugate
pad, and a sample pad.
B Principle of Operation:
The specific analyte tested by the Proov Test is pregnanediol glucuronide (PdG), a progesterone
metabolite. The Proov Test is intended for measuring PdG in first morning urine during the non-
menstruating phases of the monthly female reproductive cycle. The Proov Test is a disposable
lateral flow test strip, consisting of a test area and control area. The urine sample is applied to the
strip by dipping. The sample moves by lateral flow into the test area, and then the control area.
The test area has PdG-specific reagents impregnated on it to detect the present of hormone
metabolites in the urine. The control area has antibodies impregnated to be used as internal
control for proper assay function. The test strip is intended for use outside the body (in vitro
diagnostic use) and provides qualitative results with a single red line indicating a positive result
for PdG and two red lines indicating a negative result for PdG in urine.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated using analyte-free urine specimens spiked with varying
concentrations of PdG (0, 2.5, 3.75, 5, 6.25, and 7.5 µg/ml). PdG concentrations were
confirmed using a validated PdG ELISA assay. Each urine sample was tested using three
device lots of device, by three operators, in duplicate, across five consecutive days, for a total
of 90 measurements per sample. Results are shown in the table below:
PdG Level Percent from Positive Negative % Positive
(µg/mL) Cutoff
0 -100% 0 90 0%
2.5 -50% 0 90 0%
3.75 -25% 0 90 0%
5 Cutoff 41 49 46%
6.25 +25% 90 0 100%
7.5 +50% 90 0 100%

2. Linearity:
Not applicable since this is a qualitative device.
3. Analytical specificity/Interference:
Potential interference from exogenous interferents and potential cross-reactivity from
endogenous substances was evaluated by dipping Proov Tests strips from three different lots
into analyte-free urine specimens containing 6.25 µg/mL or 0 µg/mL PdG or specimens
containing 6.25 µg/mL or 0 µg/mL PdG that were spiked with different interfering
substances. In addition, four levels of pH and three specific gravity conditions were
evaluated as potential interferences for the device. Three replicates were performed for each
condition assayed. The sponsor stated that interference was non-significant if negative
specimens all correctly read negative and the positive specimens all correctly read positive.
Results are shown below:

their interference study to evaluate a potential Hook effect for their device. No discrepant
results were observed.
