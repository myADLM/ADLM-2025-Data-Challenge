III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
MAGLUMI 2000 25-OH Vitamin D is an in vitro chemiluminescence immunoassay for the
quantitative determination of 25-OH Vitamin D in human serum using Maglumi 2000 Fully-auto
chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer. The measurement of 25-OH Vitamin D is to be used
as an aid in the assessment of vitamin D sufficiency.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
MAGLUMI 2000 Immunoassay Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The MAGLUMI 2000 25-OH Vitamin D assay consists of the following reagents:
• Magnetic Microbeads - coated with 25-OH Vitamin D monoclonal antibody, containing
BSA, NaN3 (<0.1%)
• Calibrator Low- Containing BSA and 25-OH Vitamin D antigen, NaN3(<0.1%)
• ABEI Label- 25-OH Vitamin D antigen labeled with ABEI
• Control 1- Containing BSA and 25-OH Vitamin D antigen, NaN3 (<0.1%)
• Control 2- Containing BSA and 25-OH Vitamin D antigen, NaN3 (<0.1%)
B Principle of Operation:
The 25-OH VITAMIN D assay is a competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay using FDA
previously cleared MAGLUMI 2000 instrument (k162698).
The 25-OH Vitamin D assay is a two-incubation chemiluminescence immunoassay for the
quantitative determination of total 25-OH vitamin D in human serum. In the first incubation, the
25-OH vitamin D is dissociated from its binding protein by the displacing reagent and binds to
the 25-OH vitamin D antibody on the magnetic microbeads forming an antibody-antigen
complex. Following a second incubation, the 25-OH Vitamin D labeled ABEI are added. The
rest unbound material is removed during a wash cycle. Subsequently, the Starter 1+2 are added
to initiate a flash chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is
measured as relative light units (RLUs), which is inversely proportional to the concentration of
25-OH Vitamin D present in the sample.

2. Linearity:
The linearity of the MAGLUMI 25-OH VITAMIN D method was determined following the
CLSI EP6-A guideline. A low serum sample pool and a high serum sample pool were mixed
in different proportions to create eleven linearity samples with 25-OH vitamin D
concentrations from 4.600 to 145.800 ng/mL. Each sample was measured in quadruple on 3
lots of reagent. Linearity was evaluated using regression analysis.

The results of the linearity study support the sponsor claimed that the candidate assay is

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The effect of common drugs and interference substances were evaluated using human
serum pools. For each substance, three serum samples containing 20, 30 and 60 ng/mL
concentration of 25-OH Vitamin D were analyzed. No significant interference was
defined as recovery ± 10% when compared to the control sample. The substances and
the highest concentration tested which did not caused significant interference are listed
below.

The effect of conjugated/unconjugated bilirubin, hemoglobin, triglyceride, uric acid,
cholesterol, human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA), rheumatoid factor (RF) and human
serum total protein was evaluated using human serum samples. Each potential
interferent was added to 25-OH Vitamin D human serum samples and tested using 3 lots
of reagents. For all substances tested, no significant interference was defined as
recovery ± 10% when compared to control sample.
The potential interferents and the highest concentration tested which did not caused

Cross-Reactivity Study:
A cross-reactivity study was performed using two base serum samples containing total 25-
OH Vitamin D 30 ng/mL and 60 ng/mL respectively. These samples were spiked with
various cross reactants and measured for these solutions using 3 lots of reagents. The cross-
reactivity was determined using the following formula: % cross reactivity = [(mean recovery
of test samples in ng/mL) – (mean recovery of control sample in ng/mL) / (concentration of
cross reactant in ng/mL)] * 100.
The following table shows cross-reactivity of potential cross reactant.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The MAGLUMI 2000 25-OH Vitamin D assay is traceable to the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2972a reference
material.
6. Detection Limit:
Detection limit studies were performed following CLSI EP17-A guideline.
The limit of blank (LoB) was determined by testing 25-OH Vitamin D-depleted serum
samples in 12 replicates per day, over 5 days using 3 different reagent lots. The LoB was
calculated using the mean of the 57th and 58th highest obtained values and was determined to
be 1.990 ng/mL (highest of the 3 lots).
The limit of detection (LoD) was determined by testing four level of low samples in 60
replicates of 12 per day over 5 days using 3 lots of reagents. The LoD was calculated using
parametric analysis. LOD was determined to be 3.800 ng/mL (highest of the 3 lots).
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was determined by measuring six low serum samples, in six
replicates per run, one run per day, over 5 days, using 3 lots of reagents. LoQ is defined as
the lowest analyte concentration that can be reproducibly measured with an intermediate
precision CV of ≤ 20 % and was determined to be 5.371 ng/mL (highest of the 3 lots).
The results of the LoB, LoD, and LoQ are summarized below:
LoB LoD LoQ
1.990 ng/mL 3.800 ng/mL 5.371 ng/mL
The sponsor claimed that the candidate assay has a measuring range from 5.371 to 143 ng/mL.
