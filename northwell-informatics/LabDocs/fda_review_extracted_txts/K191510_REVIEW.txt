place in individual reaction chambers in the reaction rotor, with other rotors containing patient
samples and reagents. Liquids are moved by robotic pipettors. The reaction is quantitated by a
combination of chemiluminescence and fluorescence measurements compared to a calibration
curve, all performed by the analyzer with the NOVEOS software.
B Principle of Operation:
The NOVEOS specific IgE (sIgE) Assay is an immunometric, chemiluminescent assay for the
quantitative determination of IgE of known specificity in human serum samples. Magnetic beads
coated with streptavidin and fluorescent dye are incubated with a biotinylated allergen that binds
to the streptavidin molecule on the surface of the beads. The beads are collected by use of a
magnetic field to remove the liquid, and then undergo a wash step to remove unbound
biotinylated allergen prior to incubation with the sample. If present in the sample, sIgE binds to
the captured biotinylated allergen. After incubation, the beads are washed and subsequently
incubated with an HRP-labeled anti-IgE monoclonal antibody (Conjugate IgE) to form an
antibody-conjugate complex that is bound to the captured biotinylated allergen. After washing
away the non-bound conjugate, a chemiluminescent substrate is added to the assay mixture
resulting in light generation in proportion to the amount of antibody-conjugate that has been
bound to the beads. The fluorescence is used to correct for any bead loss during the assay, and
the (corrected) chemiluminescence is compared to a calibration curve to provide quantification
of bound sIgE. The higher the value of chemilumiscent signal detected by the instrument, the
higher the amount of sIgE detected in the sample tested.

The data summarized in the table above support linearity throughout the claimed measuring
range from 0.17 kU/L to 100 kU/L.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
a) Inhibition study:
Immunological specificity of D002 (Dermatophagoides farinae) allergen was verified
through competitive inhibition according to CLSI guideline I/LA20-A3. A positive
sample with specific IgE concentration of 50.9 kU/L was used in the study. The D002
allergen solution (inhibitor) was diluted into the positive serum sample to achieve a
starting concentration of 100 µg/mL. The D002 sample solution was serially diluted five
times in two-fold increments and each diluted sample was evaluated for dose-dependent
inhibition in five replicates with three lots of NOVEOS sIgE Assay, D002. The results of
the dose-dependent inhibition study showed that >50% inhibition was achieved with
D002 at a final inhibitor concentration of 0.39 µg/mL. The related allergen D070
(Storage mite), and the unrelated allergens, F001 (Egg white), G006 (Timothy grass) and
W003 (Giant ragweed) were also tested as potential inhibitors at a final concentration of
at least ten times the concentration of D002 at which >50% inhibition was achieved. All
allergen inhibitors were spiked into the positive serum sample at a 1:1 dilution and
evaluated with three lots of NOVEOS sIgE Assay, D002. The results of the single-dose
inhibition studies using one related allergen (D070) and three unrelated allergens (F001,
G006 and W003) did not show inhibition at a test concentration of 3.9 µg/mL for the
related allergen and 1.25 mg/mL for the three unrelated allergens. The inhibition studies
indicate that the NOVEOS sIgE Assay, D002 contains the immunologically relevant
allergen.
b) Interference
(1) Endogenous Substance Interference:
The effect of the presence of elevated level of human albumin, hemoglobin,
triglyceride, conjugated bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin, and rheumatoid factor in
serum samples was evaluated by testing five (one negative, four positives including
one near 0.35 kU/L) serum samples spiked with varying levels of each interferent
and analyzed in 12 replicates in one assay run with three lots of NOVEOS sIgE
Assay, D002. The % recovery for each sample spiked with the potential interfering
substance was calculated by comparing its result to that of the corresponding
reference sample spiked with an equal volume of the solvent without the interfering
substance. No interference was noted for samples containing human serum albumin
up to 120 mg/mL, hemoglobin up to 200 mg/dL, triglyceride up to 3,000 mg/dL,

conjugated bilirubin up to 30 mg/dL, unconjugated bilirubin up to 20 mg/dL, and
rheumatoid factor up to 513 IU/mL.
(2) Exogenous Substance Interference:
The same protocol used in the endogenous substance interference study was used to
evaluate potentially interfering exogenous substances. No interference was noted
for samples containing biotin up to 1200 ng/mL, diphenhydramine at 19.6 µmol/L,
methylprednisolone at 1000 ng/mL, omalizumab at 0.12 mg/mL and ranitidine at
6.0 mg/L.
c) Cross-reactivity:
The potential cross-reactivity of non-IgE (IgA, IgD, IgG, and IgM) to the NOVEOS sIgE
Assay, D002 was evaluated by mixing serum samples spiked with the immunoglobulin
stock solutions containing IgA, IgG, and IgM at 38.43 mg/mL and IgD at 7.72 mg/mL
with immunoglobulin stripped serum to obtain a series of six two-fold serially diluted
samples containing target levels of non-IgE within or above the physiological range. The
control samples were prepared by serially diluting equal volumes of distilled water into
stripped serum. No cross reactivity was noted up to 14.86 mg/mL for IgA, IgG and IgM,
and up to 0.346 mg/mL for IgD.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The claimed measuring range is from 0.17 kU/L to 100 kU/L.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a) Traceability:
The IgE calibrators are traceable to the World Health Organization (WHO) third
International Standard 11/234 of Human Serum Immunoglobulin E.
b) Kit Stability:
Shelf life stability: Both an ongoing real-time stability study and an accelerated stability
study were performed in accordance with CLSI EP25-A using three lots of NOVEOS
sIgE Assay, D002. The accelerated stability data support the manufacturer’s claim of 24-
month unopened shelf-life stability for the Specific IgE Capture Reagent D002. All other
reagents required to perform specific IgE testing on the NOVEOS system are not allergen
specific and the shelf-life stability of these reagents has been previously established per
K182479, with the exception of the Fluo Beads reagent which now has an extended shelf-
life stability of up to 24 months based on the real-time stability data. The real-time
stability study is on-going and available data supports eight months unopened shelf-life
stability for NOVEOS sIgE Assay, D002 when stored at 2–8 °C per the manufacturer’s
instruction for use. The claimed shelf-life for individual assay components is listed in the
table below:

6. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the
NOVEOS sIgE Assay, D002 on the NOVEOS Immunoassay Analyzer were determined
according to CLSI guideline EP17-A2.
LoB was determined by testing five IgE-free human serum samples in three replicates per
run, one run per day, for six days on two analyzers using two lots of NOVEOS sIgE Assay,
D002. The LoB was estimated as the 95th percentile of 90 measurements for each of the lots
tested.
LoD was determined using five serum samples with low IgE concentrations. Each sample
was tested in replicates of ten per run, one run per day, for six days on two analyzers using

two lots of NOVEOS sIgE Assay, D002. The LoD was determined for each lot based on 300
measurements as the mean concentration of the lowest sample with 95% or more of its
replicates recovering above the LoB.
LoQ was determined as functional sensitivity using a set of five samples with low IgE
concentrations. Each sample was tested in replicates of five per run, two run per day, for five
days with two reagent lots on two instruments for a total of 50 data points per sample per
reagent lot. The LoQ is defined as the mean value of the sample which fulfills the
specification for the total within-laboratory imprecision (<20%CV).
The claimed LoB, LoD, and LoQ are based on the highest value obtained from the lots tested
and are summarized in the table below.

9. Carry-Over:
Evaluation of instrument carryover was conducted using one lot of reagent of NOVEOS
sIgE, D002 on three NOVEOS Immunoassay Analyzers. The carryover assessment is based
on five cycle counts per instrument. Pooled high-level patient samples with sIgE
concentration of 88.80 kU/L were aliquoted into five tubes, and the pooled low-patient
samples with sIgE concentration of 0.27 kU/L and aliquoted into 25 tubes. Each cycle
consists of one high sample test followed by five low sample tests against D002 capture
reagent. Low Sample 1 following High Sample is denoted as “possibly affected” which has
the highest chance of potential carryover thus leading to signal change > 0.10 kU/L. Low
Samples 3–5 is denoted as “very probably unaffected” and therefore should not have elevated
kU/L signal. Carryover assessment is done by measuring the change (Δ) of [mean
concentration of Low Sample 1] and [mean concentration of Low Samples 3–5]. The results
are summarized in the table below:
