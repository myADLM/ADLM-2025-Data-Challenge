III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
The CareStart Flu A&B Plus is an in vitro rapid immunochromatographic assay for the
qualitative detection of influenza virus type A and B nucleoprotein antigens directly from
nasopharyngeal swab specimens of symptomatic patients.
The test is intended for use as an aid in the rapid differential diagnosis of acute influenza type A
and B viral infections. This test is intended to distinguish between influenza type A and/or B
virus in a single test. This test is not intended to detect influenza type C viral antigens. Negative
test results are presumptive and should be confirmed by viral culture or an FDA-cleared
influenza A and B molecular assay. Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infections
and should not be used as the basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A and B were established during the 2018-2019
influenza season when influenza A/H3N2 and A/H1N1pdm09, and B/Victoria were the
predominant influenza viruses in circulation. When other influenza viruses are emerging,
performance characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should
be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses
and sent to the state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted
in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to received and culture specimens.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The CareStart Flu A&B Plus test is an immunochromatographic assay for detection of extracted
influenza type A and B virus nucleoprotein antigens in nasopharyngeal swab specimens.
The assay kit consists of 20 cassettes (each cassette contains one test strip), 20 extraction vials,
20 caps, 20 swabs for the collection of nasopharyngeal specimens, and three external control
swabs, two positive control swabs and one negative control swab. One of the positive control
swabs contains inactivated influenza A virus dried onto the swab and the other positive control
K191514 - Page 2 of 19

--- Page 3 ---
swab contains inactivated influenza B dried onto the swab. The negative control swab contains
inactivated Streptococcus Group A dried onto the swab.
The kit may be stored at 1-30°C.
B Principle of Operation:
The CareStart Flu A&B Plus test is based on antigen-antibody binding technology. The virus
antigens are released from the specimen during the extraction step. Three drops of the extracted
sample are added to the cassette that contains a testing strip. During the migration through the strip,
the viral antigens bind to anti-influenza A and anti-influenza B antibodies conjugated to indicator
particles. The antigen-antibody complexes migrate through the test strip and are captured by reagents
on the membrane to form test lines and a control line. There are two separate test lines, one detecting
influenza A antigens and one detecting influenza B antigens. The control line is formed by absorbing
residual sample and serves as the internal control for the assay. The test is visually read 10 minutes
after the sample is added to the cassette.
Results Interpretation:
• The presence of two lines in the cassette, one for influenza A next to the letter “A” and one
control line next to the letter “C”, indicates influenza A positive result.
• The presence of two lines in the cassette, one for influenza B next to the letter “B” and one
control line next to the letter “C”, indicates influenza B positive result.
• The presence of three lines in the cassette, one for influenza A next to the letter “A”, one for
influenza B next to the letter “B”, and one control line next to the letter “C”, indicates a double
positive for influenza A and influenza B result.
• The presence of the control line in the cassette next to the letter “C” without any other lines
indicates a negative result.
• The absence of a C line, regardless of whether any other lines are present or absent,
represents an invalid result.
The sample with invalid result should be retested using the remaining sample present in the
extraction vial.

1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A seven-member panel was used in all three precision/reproducibility studies described in the
sections below. The panel was made using two virus strains. For the reproducibility study
and the within laboratory repeatability study influenza A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1) pdm09
and influenza B/Phuket/3073/13 were used. For the lot-lo-lot reproducibility study influenza
A/Perth/16/2009 and influenza B/Colorado/06/2017 were used. Each strain was diluted into
Universal Transport Medium (UTM) at three different target levels: moderate positive
(~3x LoD), low positive (~1x LoD), and high negative (~0.1x LoD). Panel members were
formulated with only one target present (influenza A or influenza B). Negative samples did
not contain influenza virus. Simulated nasal swabs were prepared by pipetting 25 μL of
sample (virus dilution) onto the head of the swab. Each swab was allowed to dry using
vacuum dryer and then sealed in a desiccated pouch. The swabs were removed from the
pouches prior to testing and the testing was performed according to the instructions for use.
Within-Laboratory Repeatability
The within-laboratory precision of the CareStart Flu A&B Plus was evaluated in a study
performed inhouse over 15 non-consecutive days, with two operators. One lot of devices was
used to test in triplicate the seven-member panel described above.
The qualitative results from the within-laboratory precision study are summarized in Table 1
below.

The study results showed no cross-reactivity of the above listed microorganisms with the
CareStart Flu A&B Plus assay at the concentrations tested. All influenza negative samples gave
negative results. In addition, all influenza A and influenza B samples tested positive in the
presence of the above listed microorganisms showing no interference at the concentrations
tested.
Competitive Interference
The study was performed to evaluate if the CareStart Flu A&B Plus assay can detect low levels
of influenza A in the presence of high levels of influenza B and vice versa. Four influenza strains
were used in this study: influenza A/Perth/16/2009, influenza A/Michigan/45/2015, influenza
B/Colorado/06/2017, and influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013. For low concentration samples,
influenza strains were diluted to approximately 1x LoD and for the high concentrations 5-fold
dilutions of the virus stock were used. Using a pipette, 50 µL of each influenza sample was
applied to a swab. The swabs were tested in triplicate. Low and high concentrations of the
influenza strains used in this study are presented in Table 5 below.

The study results showed no interference with positive or negative results for the CareStart Flu
A&B Plus assay at the concentrations tested in the presented study.
Biotin Interference
Positive influenza swabs were prepared for four viral strains: influenza A/Perth/16/2009,
influenza A/Michigan/45/2015, influenza B/Colorado/06/2017, and influenza
B/Phuket/3073/2013. Viruses were diluted in UTM to approximately 2x LoD and biotin was
spiked to the levels presented in the table below. The swabs were prepared by pipetting 50 µL of
sample to the swab. The negative swabs contained UTM and biotin only. Positive and negative
samples were tested in triplicate.
The results from the biotin interference study are summarized in Table 8 below.

Biotin concentrations up to 500 ng/mL did not lead to false results. Biotin concentrations >500
ng/mL may cause false negative influenza A results with the CareStart Flu A&B Plus. Due to
the relatively high level of biotin tolerance and the specimen type, which is unlikely to have
biotin concentrations as high as what is observed in serum/plasma specimens, no limitation in the
labeling regarding the biotin interference was necessary.

Not applicable.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Internal Quality Control
The CareStart Flu A&B Plus assay contains built in internal assay control. The control line
contains control antibodies which bind residual sample. The appearance of the control line on
the test ensures that sufficient flow of the sample occurred during the assay.
External Quality Controls
The CareStart Flu A&B Plus kit contains two positive external control swabs (one for
influenza A and one for influenza B) and one negative external control swab that allow for

External Controls Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility
The lot-to-lot reproducibility for the external positive and negative control swabs was
evaluated using three lots of external controls with three operators. The results from the study
are summarized in Table 9 below.

6. Detection Limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) of the assay was determined with four strains of influenza A
virus and four strains of influenza B virus in three step process. First, the initial LoD range
was established using a series of five-fold dilutions of virus stocks prepared in UTM. Using a
pipette, 50 µL of each dilution was applied to a swab. The swabs were tested in triplicate.
The lowest concentration that resulted in 100% detection (3/3) was used to test 20 replicates.
The dilution that resulted in ≥95% detection was considered initial LoD range. In the next
step, a series of two-fold dilutions in negative nasal matrix near the initial LoD range were
prepared. Using a pipette, 50 µL of each dilution were applied to a swab and tested in
triplicate until a negative result was obtained for at least one of the replicates. The estimated
LoD was confirmed by testing 20 replicates. The results from the study are presented in
Table 10 below.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Not applicable. Performance of the CareStart Flu A&B Plus was evaluated in a clinical study
against an FDA-cleared molecular assay.
2. Matrix Comparison:
Matrix Equivalency
Matrix equivalency study was conducted to determine if UTM can be used as a substitute to
natural negative clinical matrix in analytical studies performed to evaluate the CareStart Flu
A&B Plus assay. Influenza A/Michigan/45/2015 and influenza B/Colorado/06/2017 were
diluted in natural nasal swab matrix or UTM. The pooled natural matrix was prepared by
eluting nasal swabs in 3 mL of UTM and combing matrix obtained from 17 healthy
volunteers. The negativity for influenza A and B of the pooled matrix was confirmed by
testing with an FDA-cleared molecular assay. The swabs were prepared by pipetting 50 µL
of sample onto each swab. A series of 5-fold dilutions of each influenza strain were tested in
triplicate until at least one negative result was obtained. The lowest dilution that generated
100% positive results (3/3) was confirmed by testing 20 replicates. The results from the
matrix equivalency study are presented in Table 12 below.

B/Colorado/06/2017 UTM 1.6 x 106.4 100% (20/20)
The results of the study support equivalency between the clinical matrix and the Universal
Transport Media (UTM) for preparation of samples for the analytical studies and the
reproducibility study.
C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity
Clinical performance characteristics of the CareStart Flu A&B Plus were evaluated in a
multi-center prospective clinical study in the U.S. during 2018-2019 influenza season. A total
of 10 clinical sites representing point-of-care participated in the study. To participate in the
clinical study, the patients had to show flu-like symptoms, meet other inclusion criteria and
sign informed consent. Demographics of the patients who participated in the clinical study
are presented in Table 13 below.

The performance of the CareStart Flu A&B Plus assay was evaluated against an FDA-
cleared molecular assay. Two nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the same nostril of
each patient participating in the clinical study. The first swab was tested with an FDA-
cleared molecular assay and the second swab was tested with the CareStart Flu A&B Plus.
The discrepant results were further analyzed by testing with an alternative FDA-cleared
molecular assay. The performance estimates for influenza A and B compared to an FDA-
cleared molecular assay are presented in Tables 14-15 below. The results of discrepant
analyses are presented as footnotes and were not included in the calculation of the
performance estimates.
