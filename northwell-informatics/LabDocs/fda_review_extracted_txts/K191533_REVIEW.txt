See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The ADVIA Centaur® Testosterone II (TSTII) assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the
quantitative determination of total testosterone (bound and unbound) in human serum and plasma
using the ADVIA Centaur® XP system. Measurements of testosterone are used in the diagnosis
and treatment of disorders involving the male sex hormones (androgens), including primary and
secondary hypogonadism, delayed or precocious puberty, impotence in males and, in females,
hirsutism (excessive hair) and virilization (masculinization) due to tumors, polycystic ovaries,
and adrenogenital syndromes.
The ADVIA Centaur® SHBG assay is an in vitro diagnostic immunoassay for the quantitative
determination of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in human serum and plasma using the
ADVIA Centaur® XP system. The ADVIA Centaur® SHBG assay is intended for use as an aid
in the diagnosis of androgen disorders.

Reagent (~130 ng/mL) labeled with acridinium
ester in HEPES-buffered saline with
bovine serum albumin, mouse serum,
sodium azide (< 0.1%), surfactant, and
preservatives

Ancillary Well Reagent SHBG antibody (~6 μg/mL) in HEPES

B Principle of Operation:
ADVIA Centaur® Testosterone (TSTII) assay is a competitive immunoassay using direct
chemiluminescent technology. Testosterone in the sample competes with acridinium ester-
labeled hapten in the Lite Reagent for binding with the anti-testosterone sheep monoclonal
antibody in the ADVIA Centaur TSTII Releasing Agent and streptavidin magnetic latex particles
in the Solid Phase Reagent. The ADVIA Centaur TSTII assay uses ADVIA Centaur TSTII
Releasing Agent to release bound testosterone from the endogenous binding proteins in the
sample.
The ADVIA Centaur® SHBG assay is a sandwich immunoassay that uses three reagent
components: Solid Phase, Ancillary Well Reagent, and Lite Reagent. Solid Phase is streptavidin-
coupled magnetic latex particles, Ancillary Well Reagent contains biotinylated F(ab)2
monoclonal antibody to SHBG, and Lite Reagent consists of a second F(ab)2 monoclonal
antibody to SHBG labeled with acridinium ester (SHBG-AE). The amount of SHBG present in
the patient sample is proportional to the amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the
system. Results are calculated from a master curve adjusted by using high and low calibrators.

2. Linearity:
TSTII: A linearity study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP06-A guideline. A
dilution series consisting of 9 levels with concentrations ranging from 6.94 to 1,655.90 ng/dL
was prepared by mixing high and low pools of testosterone. For each dilution sample, 3
replicate measurements were made using a single reagent lot, on a single instrument, in a
single day. The deviation of the results from the expected linear fit was analyzed. The linear
regression formula obtained from the analysis of the results was as follows:
y = 1.004x - 0.015
The results from the linearity study support an analytical measuring range from 7 - 1,500
ng/dL.
SHBG: See previous performance in k151986.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
TSTII: Refer to the interference studies reported in k091867.
The sponsor conducted additional testing to evaluate biotin interference on the TSTII assay.
Up to 1,500 ng/mL biotin was spiked into two concentrations of TSTII, 83 µg/mL and 289
µg/mL. Triplicate measurements were recorded for each sample (including a negative control
without biotin) using a single lot of TSTII assay reagent on the ADVIA Centaur XP
Instrument. The sponsor defines no significant interference as <10% change in results, and
states that no significant interference was observed at biotin concentrations < 30 ng/mL for
both concentrations of TSTII tested.

* Interference could not be calculated because the results of the biotin spiked samples were
above the claimed analytical measuring range of the assay.
The labeling includes the following limitation: “Specimens that contain biotin at a
concentration of 30 ng/mL demonstrate a less than or equal to 10% change in results. Biotin
concentrations greater than this may lead to falsely elevated results for patient samples. The
recommended adult daily dietary intake for biotin is 30 μg/day. Over the counter dietary
supplements promoted for use in hair, skin and nail health may contain 5-10 mg of biotin.
Pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults have shown that ingesting 5 mg of biotin can result
in serum levels as high as 73 ng/mL. In rare cases, subjects are prescribed up to 300 mg of
biotin per day for therapeutic applications, resulting in serum biotin levels as high as 1,160
ng/mL.”
SHBG: Refer to the interference studies reported in k091867.
The sponsor conducted additional testing to evaluate biotin interference on the SHBG assay.
Up to 1,200 ng/mL biotin was spiked into two concentrations of SHBG, 19.6 and 44.1
nmol/L. Triplicate measurements were recorded for each sample (including a negative
control without biotin) using a single lot of SHBG assay reagent on the ADVIA Centaur XP
Instrument. The sponsor defines no significant interference as <10% change in results, and
states that no significant interference was observed at biotin concentrations < 600 ng/mL for
both concentrations of SHBG tested.

MS/MS is traceable to the primary testosterone standard National Measurement Institute
(NMI) M914.
SHBG: The ADVIA Centaur SHBG assay is traceable to the WHO 2nd International
Standard for Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (08/226) from National Institute for
Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC).
Standardization:
The ADVIA Centaur® Testosterone II (TSTII) assay was re-standardized to more closely
align with the CDC HoSt Testosterone Reference Measurement Procedure (RMP). The
ADVIA Centaur ® Testosterone II (TSTII) assay is standardized using internal standards
manufactured using USP grade testosterone; the assigned values of these standards correlate
to the CDC HoSt Testosterone RMP via method comparison. The assigned value of three of
the 10 assay gold standards was modified.
The low and high calibrator specifications remain unchanged. Similar to the predicate TSTII
assay (K151986), the re-standardized ADVIA Centaur® Testosterone II (TSTII) assay is still
standardized using internal standards made from USP-grade testosterone, which are traceable
to ID-LC-MS/MS CDC HoST Testosterone RMP. The ADVIA Centaur TSTII Calibrators
included in the assay kit for the re-standardized ADVIA Centaur TSTII assay are the same
formulation as the calibrators for the predicate ADVIA Centaur TSTII assay.
6. Detection Limit:
TSTII: Limit of blank (LoB) study was performed by testing 5 blank samples of human
serum pools using 2 reagent lots over 5 days on a single instrument. Each day, 2 runs were
conducted. For each sample, 6 replicate measurements were recorded per run (300 replicates
total). LoB was calculated non-parametrically at the 95th percentile for each lot. The LoB for
each lot was the result at this rank position. If the rank position was a non-integer, the LoB
was determined by interpolation between the bracketing values. The largest LoB for both
reagent lots was chosen as the assay’s LoB.
Limit of detection (LoD) study was performed by testing 10 low level samples (female
human serum pools) using 2 reagent lots over 5 days on a single instrument. Each day, 2 runs
were performed and for each sample, 6 replicate measurements were recorded per run (1,200
replicates total). LoD was calculated non-parametrically. The higher LoD of the two lots was
the assay’s LoD.
Limit of quantitation (LoQ) study was performed using 10 female human sera samples with
low levels of analytes and 5 blank male and female human serum pools measured over 5 days
using 2 reagent lots on 1 instrument per lot. Each day, 2 runs were performed and for each
sample, 6 replicate measurements were recorded. For each reagent lot, the within-laboratory
precision (expressed as %CV) was plotted against the mean concentration for each sample.
The sponsor defines LoQ as the analyte concentration corresponding to 20% within-lab CV.
The largest LoQ for both reagent lots was chosen as the assay’s LoQ.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
TSTII: The sponsor conducted a method comparison study to verify that the re-
standardization of the assay does not have a significant impact on the performance of the
device compared to the previous assay (originally cleared in k151986). The study was
designed to compare the performance of the TSTII assay to that of the recognized reference
method (CDC HoSt Testosterone Reference Measurement Procedure (RMP) ID-LS-
MS/MS). The study evaluated a total of 108 individual male and female adult serum samples
spanning the assay range. Of these, 72 samples were individual (non-pooled) human sera
from single donors obtained by Siemens, with testosterone concentrations assigned by CDC
HoSt Testosterone RMP ID-LS-MS/MS. 30 samples were supplied directly by CDC, and
were individual human serum obtained from individual blood bank donors, with testosterone
concentrations assigned by CDC HoSt Testosterone RMP ID-LS-MS/MS. Less than 5% of
the samples were contrived to cover concentrations at the extreme ends of the measuring
range. All samples were run singlicate on one ADVIA Centaur XP system using a single
reagent lot over 3 days. The results for ADVIA Centaur® Testosterone (TSTII) versus CDC
HoSt Testosterone RMP ID-LS-MS/MS were analyzed using Passing-Bablok regression
analysis. The results are summarized below:
N 108
Slope 0.97
Intercept -0.22
R 0.98
Test Range 7.27-1,394 ng/dL
In addition, a method comparison study was performed to evaluate the performance of the re-
standardized ADVIA Centaur® Testosterone II (TSTII) assay against the previously cleared
assay (k151986). A total of 108 individual male and female adult serum samples spanning
the assay range were run on one ADVIA Centaur XP instrument using a single reagent lot.
Samples were assayed in singlicate over 3 days. Weighted Deming regression was used for
data analysis.

An additional method comparison study was performed to evaluate the performance of the
re-standardized ADVIA Centaur® Testosterone II (TSTII) assay against a commercially
available testosterone assay, Dimension Vista LOCI Total Testosterone (k151529). A total of
124 serum samples (79 adults and 45 pediatric subjects) spanning the assay range were run
on one ADVIA Centaur XP instrument using a single reagent lot and on one Dimension
Vista instrument using one Dimension Vista LOCI TSTT reagent lot. Samples were assayed
in singlicate over 3 days. Weighted Deming regression was used for data analysis. The
results for all specimens are reported below.

2. Matrix Comparison:
TSTII: Following a technical risk assessment of the assay performance attributes that may be
impacted by re-standardization of the current TSTII assay, the sponsor determined that assay
re-standardization is not expected to impact the results dependent on specimen matrix. The
sponsor indicated study control is equally affected by the re-standardization, therefore, there
is no effect on the result and the claim is unaffected, this is supported by the data showing
similar performance to the predicate device. FDA found this justification to be acceptable.
Therefore, the matrix comparison study data from the ADVIA Centaur® Testosterone
(TSTII) assay cleared in k151986 remains applicable.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
TSTII: A reference interval study was performed for the ADVIA Centaur® Testosterone
II (TSTII) assay in accordance with CLSI EP28-A3c guideline. A total of 940 pediatrics
and 760 adult samples were collected from apparently healthy individuals. The sample
groups tested consisted of:
• 250 adult males under 50 years of age
• 135 adult males ages > 50 years old
• 224 adult females under 50 years of age
• 151 adult females ages > 50 years old
• 460 male pediatrics, ages 2-21 across Tanner Stages 1-5
• 483 female pediatrics, ages 2-21 across Tanner Stages 1-5
Testing was performed using the re-standardized assay. Each sample was assayed in
singlicate. For adults, the lower and upper reference limits were estimated as the 5th and
the 95th percentiles of the distribution of test results using a non-parametric approach in
accordance with the recommendation in CLSI EP28-A3c guideline. Due to the limited
availability of pediatric samples, the sample analysis method varied depending on the
number of samples in each subgroup. Please see the following descriptions of each
subgroup reference intervals determination:
• For groups of 120 or more subjects, the lower and upper reference limits were
estimated as the 2.5th and the 97.5th percentiles of the distribution of test results
using a non-parametric approach in accordance with the recommendation in CLSI
guideline EP28-A3.
• For groups of 40 to 119 subjects, the lower and upper reference limits were
estimated as the 2.5th and the 97.5th percentiles of the distribution of test results
using a robust measure of location and spread, as developed by Horn and Pesce.
• For groups of less than 40 subjects, the lower and upper reference limits were
estimated as the 5th and the 95th percentiles of the distribution of test results.
