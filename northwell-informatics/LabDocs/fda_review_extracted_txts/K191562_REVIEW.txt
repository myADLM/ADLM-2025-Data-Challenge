A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Yumizen C1200 Ferritin reagent is intended for the quantitative in vitro diagnostic determination
of ferritin in human serum by latex-enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay. Measurements of
ferritin aid in the diagnosis of diseases affecting iron metabolism, hemochromatosis (iron
overload), and iron deficiency anemia.
Yumizen C1200 Transferrin reagent is intended for the quantitative in vitro diagnostic
determination of transferrin in human serum and lithium heparin plasma by turbidimetry.
Measurement of transferrin levels aids in the diagnosis of malnutrition, acute inflammation,
infection, and iron deficiency anemia.
Yumizen C1200 Rheumatoid Factor reagent is intended for the quantitative in vitro diagnostic
determination of rheumatoid factor in human serum by latex-enhanced immunoturbidimetric
assay. Measurement of rheumatoid factor may aid in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
For the Yumizen C1200 (K183375 and K191993) only
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Yumizen C1200 Ferritin:
• Reagent 1: Glycine buffer solution
• Reagent 2: Suspension of latex particles bound to rabbit anti-ferritin antibodies
Yumizen C1200 Transferrin:
• Reagent 1: TRIS buffer solution
• Reagent 2: Goat anti-human transferrin antibodies in TRIS buffer
Yumizen C1200 Rheumatoid Factor:
• Reagent 1: Glycine buffer solution
• Reagent 2: Suspension of latex particles sensitized with denatured human IgG
All assays’ calibrators and control materials are sold separately.
B Principle of Operation:
Yumizen C1200 Ferritin:
When an antigen-antibody reaction occurs between ferritin in a sample and rabbit anti-ferritin-
antibodies coated on latex particles, agglutination results. This agglutination is detected as an
K191562 - Page 2 of 16

--- Page 3 ---
absorbance change, with the magnitude of the change being proportional to the quantity of
ferritin in the sample. The actual concentration is calculated from a calibration curve.
Immune complexes formed in solution scatter light in proportion to their size, shape, and
concentration. Turbidimeters measure the reduction of incidence light due to reflection,
absorption or scatter. In this procedure, the measurement of the rate of decrease in light intensity
transmitted (increase in absorbance) through particles suspended in solution is the result of
complexes formed during the immunological reaction between the analyte in the patient sample
and rabbit anti-ferritin-antibodies coated on latex particles.
Yumizen C1200 Transferrin:
The immunoturbidimetric assay measures increasing sample turbidity caused by the formation of
insoluble immune complexes when goat anti-human transferrin antibodies are bound to added to
the transferrin sample in the sample. The transferrin concentration is proportional to the amount
of turbidity formed.
Yumizen C1200 Rheumatoid Factor:
When an antigen-antibody reaction occurs between RF in a sample and denatured human IgG
which has been attached to latex particles, agglutination results. This agglutination is detected as
an absorbance change, with the magnitude of the change being proportional to the quantity of RF
in the sample. The actual concentration is calculated from a calibration curve.

2. Linearity:
Yumizen C1200 Ferritin:
Linearity of the Yumizen C1200 Ferritin assay was assessed according to CLSI EP06-A. A
high concentration ferritin-spiked human serum sample and a ferritin-depleted human serum
were used to create a dilution series covering the measuring range were measured. Sample
dilutions were assayed in quadruplicate within a single run and samples within the measuring
range were used to determine linearity:
Dilution Range Regression Slope Intercept
R²
(ng/mL) Equation (95% CI) (95% CI)
13.3–426.6 y=0.99x+3.16 0.98–1.00 1.15–5.18 0.999
Auto-rerun validation study: An auto-rerun study was performed to evaluate the accuracy of
the analyzer’s auto dilution function to obtain results for ferritin samples with analyte
concentrations above the primary measuring range (450 ng/mL). Seven samples were used
for the study, ranging from 470–2166 ng/mL. Each sample was manually diluted with a 1:5
ratio. The automatic instrument dilutions and the manual dilutions were measured in
quadruplicates. The results of the auto-rerun study support the claim that samples having
concentrations up to 2250 ng/mL can be run via the rerun function which uses a 1:5 dilution.
Prozone effect: The potential for a prozone effect was evaluated for the ferritin assay. Testing
elevated samples did not indicate a prozone effect with concentrations up to 5043 ng/mL. A
prozone alarm will flag samples ≥5043 ng/mL.
Yumizen C1200 Transferrin:
Linearity of the Yumizen C1200 Transferrin assay was assessed according to CLSI EP06-A.
A high concentration transferrin-spiked human serum sample and a transferrin-depleted
human serum were used to create a dilution series covering the measuring range. Sample
dilutions were assayed in quadruplicate within a single run and samples within the measuring
range were used to determine linearity. The results are summarized below:
Dilution Range Regression Slope Intercept
R²
(mg/dL) Equation (95% CI) (95% CI)
15.4–461.3 y=1.05x-5.46 1.04–1.07 -10.24 – -0.68 0.998
Auto-rerun validation study: An auto-rerun study was performed to evaluate the accuracy of
the analyzer’s auto dilution function to obtain results for transferrin samples with analyte
concentrations above the primary measuring range (520 mg/dL). Seven samples were used
for the study, ranging from 540–1450 mg/dL. Each sample was manually diluted with a 1:3
ratio. The automatic instrument dilutions and the manual dilutions were measured in
quadruplicates. The results of the auto-rerun study support the claim that samples having
higher concentrations up to 1560 mg/dL can be run via the rerun function which uses a 1:3
dilution.

Prozone effect: The potential for a prozone effect was evaluated for this assay with spiked
native serum samples. Testing elevated samples did not indicate a prozone effect with
concentrations up to 4000 mg/dL.
Yumizen C1200 Rheumatoid Factor:
Linearity of the Yumizen C1200 Rheumatoid Factor assay was assessed according to CLSI
EP06-A. A high concentration RF-spiked human serum sample and diluent was used to
create a dilution series covering the measuring range were measured. Sample dilutions were
assayed in quadruplicate within a single run and samples within the measuring range were
used to determine linearity. The results are summarized below:
Dilution Range Regression Slope Intercept
R²
(IU/mL) Equation (95% CI) (95% CI)
13.2–118.8 y=0.92x+4.78 0.91–0.93 3.95–5.60 0.999
Auto-rerun validation study: An auto-rerun study was performed to evaluate the accuracy of
the analyzer’s auto dilution functions to obtain results for RF-positive samples with analyte
concentrations above the primary measuring range (120 IU/mL). The Yumizen C1200
Rheumatoid Factor assay includes two flags in the instrument method: an “alarm H”
corresponding to a sample that is higher than 120 IU/mL and an “alarm P” corresponding to a
prozone effect (see below) if the samples is higher than 229 IU/mL. A 1:4 post-dilution
factor will be used if the alarm H is triggered; a 1:10 post-dilution factor will be used if the
alarm P is triggered.
Three samples, ranging from 131–364 IU/mL, were used to test the accuracy between
manual dilutions and automated dilutions triggered by alarm H. Each sample was manually
diluted with a 1:4 ratio. The automatic instrument dilutions and the manual dilutions were
measured in quadruplicates. The results of the auto-rerun study support the claim that
samples having higher concentrations can be run via the rerun function when the alarm H
function is triggered.
Four samples, ranging from 503–1180 IU/mL, were used to test the accuracy between
manual dilutions and automated dilutions triggered by alarm P. Each sample was manually
diluted with a 1:10 ratio. The automatic instrument dilutions and the manual dilutions were
measured in quadruplicates. The results of the auto-rerun study support the claim that
samples having higher concentrations up to 1200 IU/mL can be run via the rerun function
when the alarm P function is triggered.
Prozone effect: The potential for a prozone effect was evaluated for the Yumizen C1200
Rheumatoid Factor assay. There was a prozone effect with concentrations higher than 143
IU/mL. Samples with a concentration >229 IU/mL have reaction kinetics that could be
interpreted by the instrument as a result within the calibration range of the assay (although
still very elevated). The prozone alarm will flag samples with a concentration >229 IU/mL
and will be rerun automatically. The package insert describes the prozone flag.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
For all three assays, the effect of the presence of endogenous and exogenous interferents in
samples was evaluated by testing native unmodified serum pools at two analyte levels with a

range of concentration of the substances listed below. Each sample was tested at four
concentrations of interferent and with an interferent-free control in four replicates each. The
percent recovery for each sample spiked with the interference substance was calculated by
comparing its result to that of the corresponding reference sample spiked with an equal
volume of the solvent without the interferent. No interference was observed up to the
following concentrations for each assay. The results are summarized in the tables below:

Limit of Blank (LoB) corresponds to the concentration below which analyte-free samples are
found with a probability of 95%. The Limit of Detection (LoD) is determined based on the
limit of blank and the standard deviation of low concentration samples. The limit of detection
corresponds to the lowest analyte concentration which can be detected (value above the limit
of blank with a probability of 95%). The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was defined as the
lowest analyte concentration which can be quantified with a total error of ≤ 20%.
Yumizen C1200 Ferritin:
LoB:
The LoB of the Ferritin assay was determined by assaying one ferritin-depleted serum
sample in five replicates per day for four days on three Yumizen instruments. A total of 60

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
Yumizen C1200 Ferritin:
The sponsor validated female and male ferritin reference ranges cited in a reference1. Samples
from a blood bank were used: 50 female samples and 95 male samples to validate a reference
range of 10–120 ng/mL for women and 20–250 ng/mL for men.
Yumizen C1200 Transferrin:
The sponsor validated transferrin reference ranges cited in a reference2. Samples (n=85, 28
female and 57 males) from a blood bank were used and validate a reference range of 200–360
mg/dL.
Yumizen C1200 Rheumatoid Factor:
The sponsor validated RF reference ranges cited in a reference3. Sixty samples from a blood
bank were used and validate a reference range of <14 IU/mL.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
