B Principle of Operation:
The ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I assay is a two-step immunoassay for the
quantitative determination of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in human plasma using chemiluminescent
microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as
Chemiflex.
1. Sample and anti-troponin I antibody-coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined.
The cTnI present in the sample binds to the anti-troponin I coated microparticles.
2. After incubation and wash, anti-troponin I acridinium-labeled conjugate is added.
3. Following another wash cycle, Pre-Trigger and Trigger Solutions are added to the
reaction mixture.
4. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs).
There is a direct relationship between the amount of cTnI in the sample and the RLUs
detected by the ARCHITECT iSystem optics.
The cTnI concentration is read relative to a standard curve established with calibrators of known
cTnI concentrations.

Samples 1 and 2 were below the LoQ and were not included in the above analysis.
The sponsor also provided between-lot variability (which was similar to the reproducibility
estimates described above) and between-instrument variability (which was similar to the
within-run estimates described above) using patient samples.
A second study was performed following the recommendations in the EP05-A2 guideline.
Testing was conducted using 3 lots of the ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I
reagent, 2 lots of the ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I Calibrators, and 1
lot of the ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I Controls and 2 instruments.
Five controls were tested in duplicate, twice per day on 20 days. Within-laboratory
variability contains within-run, between-run, and between day variability. Patient samples
can only be stored for 8 hours at room temperature; therefore, 20-day precision studies were
conducted with quality control materials. On each day of testing a new vial of quality
control material from the same lot was used.

2. Linearity:
Linearity was evaluated following the recommendations in the CLSI EP06-A guideline with
10 samples ranging in concentrations from < 10 ng/L to >5000 ng/L. The high samples and
the low samples were native and the intermediate samples were prepared by mixing high and
low concentration samples. Four replicates were measured for each sample, and the mean of
these replicates was used to calculate the reported results. There were three sets of linearity
samples made. Deviation from linearity within the claimed range was never observed to be
greater than 14.1%.
The measuring range is 3.5 to 5000.0 ng/L with the upper end of the measuring range being
defined by the upper linear range of the assay. See detection limits below for information
supporting the lower end of the measuring range.
Hook Effect
The sponsor demonstrated that there is no hook effect with the assay up to 500,000 ng/L.
Dilution Recovery
The sponsor provided dilution studies which supported the measurement of samples above
the measurement range diluted by a factor of 10.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Endogenous interference studies were performed following the recommendations in the CLSI
EP07-A2 guideline. Two sample pools were tested. One sample pool had 20-60 ng/L cTnI
and the second sample pool had 700-2000 ng/L cTnI. These sample pools were spiked with
potential interferents. Test results from samples spiked with the potential interferent were
compared to test results from the control samples lacking the potential interferent. At the
tested concentrations, these compounds caused <10% interference.

Triglycerides 3000 mg/dL
Human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) and rheumatoid factor (RF)
The sponsor provided studies that evaluated the effect of HAMA and RF on the function of
their device. The sponsor included the following information in the labeling to address the
results:
“Specimens from patients who have received preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies
for diagnosis or therapy may contain human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA). Such
specimens may show either falsely elevated or depressed values when tested with assay kits
such as ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I or others that employ mouse
monoclonal antibodies.
Heterophilic antibodies and rheumatoid factor (RF) in human plasma can react with reagent
immunoglobulins, interfering with in vitro immunoassays. The presence of heterophilic
antibodies or RF in a patient specimen may demonstrate anomalous values. Additional
information may be required for diagnosis.
Although the ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitive Troponin-I assay is specifically designed
to minimize the effects of HAMA, heterophilic antibodies, and RF, assay results that are not
consistent with other clinical observations may require additional information for diagnosis.”
The same protocol described above was used to evaluate potential interference from
therapeutic drugs. The results are summarized below. At the tested concentrations, all drugs
caused <10% interference.

Total protein at 12.4 g/dL decreases troponin values at 15 ng/L and 500 ng/L by -12.0% and -
18.4%, respectively.
Potential interference has not been evaluated for substances other than those described in the
SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS, Interference section of this package
insert.
Troponin autoantibodies have been reported to be present in approximately 10% to 20% of
patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) and may lead to falsely low troponin
assay results and delay in treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Therefore, a test
result that is inconsistent with the clinical picture and patient history should be interpreted
with caution.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
3.5 to 5000.0 ng/L cTnI
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The Abbott ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I is traceable to the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material SRM2921. The
sponsor’s traceability scheme was reviewed and found acceptable.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) Test Protocol
The LoB was determined as described in the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. Testing was
performed using two sets of 4 zero-analyte samples tested with 3 replicates on 5 runs over the
course of 3 days. Testing was performed using 4 reagent lots and 5 instruments. 60
determinations were obtained for each reagent lot / instrument combination. LoB was
calculated parametrically. The largest estimate across all reagent lot-instrument combinations
tested was 0.9 ng/L.
Limit of Detection (LoD) Test Protocol
The LoD was determined following the recommendations in the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
Testing was performed using three reagent lots and one instrument. For the three lots tested,
seven to ten native low analyte K EDTA plasma samples were tested every day, respectively,
2
with four replicates for each test, for three days.
The parametric approach described in EP17-A2 was followed to determine the LoD. The
largest estimate across all reagent lot-instrument combinations tested was 1.7 ng/L.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) Protocol
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined as the analyte level with a within-lab CV of
less than or equal to 20% following the recommendations in the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
Testing was completed two times a day (n=2) for at least 20 days for a total of 60 replicates
K191595 - Page 11 of 16

--- Page 12 ---
with eight to 10 native K EDTA plasma pools measured on one instrument using three
2
reagent lots. For each reagent lot-instrument combination, the within-laboratory precision for
each sample, expressed as %CV, was plotted against the mean concentration obtained for
each sample. LoQ was determined by this precision profile as the concentration where the
%CV was less than 20%. The largest estimate across all reagent lot-instrument combinations
tested was 2.3 ng/L.
The sponsor claims a LoB of 0.9 ng/L, and LoD of 1.7 ng/L, and an LoQ of 3.5 ng/L.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
See Expected Values/Reference Range Section below.
8. Carry-Over:
Potential sample carryover was evaluated using EDTA plasma.
Potential sample carryover was evaluated by comparing the results of an unprotected low
sample to a protected low sample. The protected low sample was tested before the high
sample, and the unprotected low sample was tested after the high sample. The low sample
had a native cTnI concentration of ≤ 10 ng/L. The high sample had a recombinant cTnI
concentration ≥ 500,000 ng/L. The carry-over observed was approximately 0.3 ng/L cTnI
going from a high sample to a low sample.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
A multi-center prospective study was performed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the
ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I assay. Specimens were collected at 11
emergency departments (ED) from 1065 subjects presenting to the ED with symptoms
consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). All subject diagnoses were adjudicated by
three board certified cardiologists based on the 2007 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines for MI.
Serial samples were collected from patients presenting to the emergency department. The
number of patients adjudicated with an MI was 10.8% (116/1065). The sample collection
times were at 0 – 2 hours from presentation to the ED and at the following time-point relative
to the time from presentation: 2 – 4 hours and 4 – 9 hours. Investigators and adjudicators
were blinded to the proposed device’s results. Adjudicators were also blinded to site
diagnoses. All results presented below were based on the adjudicated diagnoses. Clinical

performance was estimated at an overall cut-off (male and female combined 99th percentile
upper reference limit (URL) cut-off) and male- and female-specific URL cut-offs, calculated
as described in Expected values/Reference range (in Section E below).
The samples collected in the study were frozen and stored prior to analysis. Abbott provided
additional information to confirm that the performance estimates in the labeling were not
affected by the freezing of these clinical samples. The results are summarized below.
An analysis for both females and males was performed using the overall 99th percentile
cutoff (28 ng/L). The results are summarized in the following table.
