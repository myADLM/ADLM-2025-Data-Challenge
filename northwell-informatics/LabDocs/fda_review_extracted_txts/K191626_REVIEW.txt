III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Stat Profile Prime ES Comp Plus Analyzer System is intended for in vitro diagnostic use by
health care professionals in clinical laboratory settings for the quantitative determination of pH,
Hematocrit, Ionized Calcium and Ionized Magnesium in heparinized venous whole blood, and
pH, Ionized Calcium and Ionized Magnesium in plasma and serum.
Ionized Calcium (iCa) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of parathyroid
disease, a variety ofbone diseases, chronic renal disease and tetany (intermittent muscular
contractions or spasms).
Ionized Magnesium (iMg) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
hypomagnesemia (abnormally low levels of magnesium) and hypermagnesemia (abnormally
high levels of magnesium).
pH measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening acid-base
disturbances.
Hematocrit measurements of the packed red blood cell volume are used to distinguish normal
from abnormal states, such as anemia and erythrocytosis.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Stat Profile Prime ES Comp Plus Analyzer is a blood electrolyte analyzer. It consists of the
analyzer, sensor cartridges, and thermal paper for an onboard printer. Optionally, it provides for
reading of barcode labels (such as operator badges and data sheets). The Stat Profile Prime ES
Comp Plus Analyzer has an enhanced test menu and multiple quality control options. External
Control Solutions (ampules) shall be offered, as well as an on-board Quality Management
System (QMS), an electronic monitoring approach that insures the analyzer is working properly.
The Stat Profile Prime ES Comp Plus Analyzer can accommodate either of two sensor cards in
the sensor card housing. The analyzer will determine the test configuration of the system by
detecting which sensor card is installed. The two options for the sensor card are:
• Sensor Card 1 (Basic Electrolyte Panel plus Hct) shall enable and report the following
listed analytes: Hct, Na, K, Cl
• Sensor Card 2 (Full Electrolyte Panel plus pH & Hct) shall enable and report the
following listed analytes: pH, Hct, Na, K, Cl, iCa, iMg
The Stat Profile Prime ES Comp Plus Analyzer is microprocessor-based and incorporates ion
selective electrode technology to measure pH, ionized calcium, ionized magnesium.
The Prime ES Comp Plus can be configured with an optional sample tray, which allows the user
to run up to 10 consecutive samples. Tray samples may be any combination of Serum/Plasma or
control solutions. Whole Blood samples may only be run in STAT Mode (not tray mode).
Calibration standards are provided in sealed pouches within a calibrator pack. Liquid quality
control materials are available as external ampules. Sampling and calibration are fully
automated. The Stat Profile Prime ES Comp Plus Analyzer accepts lithium heparinized whole
blood sample from syringes, open tubes, and small cups. The minimum sample sizes for analysis
is 100 μL.
B Principle of Operation:
iCa, iMg, pH
The parameters are measured by ion-selective electrodes (ISE) selectively measures the activity
of ionic species (iCa, iMg, or hydrogen ion). When the ISE is contacted with a sample, potential
is developed. The potential is proportional to the logarithm of the ionic activity and is measured
versus a reference electrode, as described by the Nernst equation.
Hct
Hematocrit results are obtained by an impedance sensor measuring electrical resistance of the
blood sample. Two standard solutions are used to calibrate the hematocrit sensor and to obtain
the slope. The analyzer then measures the electrical resistance of the blood sample to obtain the
hematocrit value.

2. Linearity:
The linearity studies were performed following the CLSI EP6-A guideline to establish the
analytical measurement range for each test system. The studies were performed on three
analyzers using lithium heparinized venous whole blood, lithium heparin plasma and serum
for pH, iCa, and iMg. Only lithium heparin whole blood was tested for Hct. Low and high
concentration pools were mixed to create 9-11 serial dilution samples that were tested in
triplicate. The results from each candidate analyzer for each parameter were compared to the
expected values. All three analyzers yielded similar results. The results of the least squares
linear regression analysis from one representative analyzer are summarized below:
Lithium heparin whole blood:

The linear regression results support the claimed measuring ranges, as summarized in the
tables above.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A3 guideline. The sponsor
collected serum sample and plasma from donors. Samples were divided to create two
separate pools one for control and the other for test samples. The potential interferents were
tested at two analyte concentrations. If interference was identified, then a dose response was
performed to determine the lowest concentration where the interfering substance may alter
the results. For all analytes, the sponsor defined interference as > ± 10% bias from the test
concentration when compared to the control sample.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
Analyte Claimed Measuring Range
iCa 0.1 - 2.7 mmol/L
iMg 0.1 - 1.5 mmol/L
pH 6.5 - 8.0
Hct 12 - 70 %
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The iCa reagent is traceable to NIST SRM 2193.
The iMg reagent is traceable to NIST SRM 929a.
pH standards and reagents used for Nova’s products are traceable to National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) SRMs 2183, 2184, 2181 and 2182. The validation is
accomplished by using a hydrogen ion selective glass membrane.
The Hct measurements were performed by the microhematocrit method defined in CLSI
H07-A3 which calls for whole blood to be centrifuged and the percentage of packed red cells
calculated. Results from the reference method were compared to measurements from a Nova
analyzer.
6. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were
determined for iCa and iMg according to CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. Two reagent lots were
used for each study.
For LoB studies, blank samples were run five times on two analyzers with different lots. Four
different blank samples were run over three days, giving a total of 60 replicates per lot. The
LoB was calculated by sorting the samples from low to high and averaging the 57th and 58th
sample using the typical Type I error risk of α=0.05. The greater LoB of the two reagent lots
was reported as the LoB.

For LoD studies, samples with low levels of iCa and iMg were prepared and run four times
on two analyzers with different lots. Five different low level samples were run over three
days, giving a total of 60 replicates per lot. The results were pooled to calculate the total
standard deviation (SDL) per calibrator lot. The LoD was calculated using the equation: LoD
= LoB + C SD . The greater LoD of the two lots was reported as the LoD.
p L
For LoQ studies, samples with low levels of iCa and iMg were prepared and run three times
on two analyzers with different lots. Each low level sample was measured on the pHOx Ultra
for a reference value. Four different low-level samples were run over three days, giving a
total of 36 replicates per lot. The mean, SD, and bias relative to the reference values was
calculated for each sample per calibrator lot. These values were used to calculate TE using
the equation TE = |Bias| + 2s for each sample and expressed as concentrations relative to the
respective reference value for each sample. The LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration
at which measured total error is less than the pre-defined total error of < 0.05 mmol/L for
iCa and <0.10 mmol/L for iMg.
The overall results of LoB, LoD, and LoQ for each matrix are summarized below:

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed to compare results from one Stat Profile Prime
ES Comp Plus to results from two Stat Profile pHOx Ultra analyzers (predicate) for whole
blood, plasm, and serum samples. For each analyte, the singlet result from the test analyzer
was compared to the average of the results from the two comparative methods. A minimum
of 150 whole blood specimens, 100 plasma specimens, and 100 serum specimens were used.
