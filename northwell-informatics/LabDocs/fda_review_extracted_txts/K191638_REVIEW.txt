III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Pointe Scientific Cocaine Metabolite Enzyme Immunoassay is intended for the qualitative
determination of benzoylecgonine (a cocaine metabolite) in human urine at a cutoff value of 150
ng/mL. Rx only.
This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas or Liquid
Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS or LC/MS) are the preferred confirmatory methods.
Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test
result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
BS-480 Chemistry Analyzer
BA-800 Chemistry Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Pointe Scientific Cocaine Metabolite Enzyme Immunoassay consists of ready-to-use liquid
reagents:
• Reagent 1 contains a mouse monoclonal anti-benzoylecgonine antibody, glucose-6-
phosphate (G6P) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), stabilizers and sodium azide
(0.09%) as a preservative.
• Reagent 2 contains glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) labeled with
benzoylecgonine in buffer with sodium azide (0.09%) as a preservative.
The Pointe Scientific Cocaine Metabolite Enzyme Immunoassay has a cutoff of 150 ng/mL
benzoylecgonine.
B Principle of Operation:
k191638 - Page 2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
The Pointe Scientific Cocaine Metabolite Enzyme Immunoassay is based on competition
between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for a fixed amount of antibody in the reagent. Enzyme activity
decreases upon binding to the antibody, and the drug concentration in the sample is measured in
terms of enzyme activity. In the absence of drug in the sample, benzoylecgonine-labeled G6PDH
conjugate is bound to antibody, and the enzyme activity is inhibited. On the other hand, when
drug is present in the sample, antibody binds to the free drug; the unbound benzoylecgonine-
labeled G6PDH then exhibits its maximal enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that can be measured
spectrophotometrically at a 340 nm primary wavelength.

VI Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was determined by spiking benzoylecgonine into drug free urine at various
concentrations (zero, -75%, -50%, -25%, at the cutoff, 125%, 150%, 175% and 200% of the
cutoff). Concentrations were confirmed by LC/MS. Testing for both the with-in run and
between-run studies were performed by testing each sample in 2 replicates, with two runs per
day, for 20 days, on both the BS-480 Chemistry Analyzer and the BS-800M Chemistry
Analyzer. The qualitative results are presented below as Positive/Negative.

To test for possible positive and/or negative interference from pH, urine samples having pH
from 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 were used. Each of these samples were divided into two
aliquots for each drug and spiked with benzoylecgonine to 75% of the cutoff and 125% of the
cutoff. No positive or negative interference due to pH was observed on either the BS-480
Chemistry Analyzer or the BS-800M Chemistry Analyzer.
To test for possible positive and/or negative interference from specific gravity,
urine samples having specific gravity ranging from 1.009 g/mL to 1.031 g/mL were used.
Each of these samples were divided into three aliquots and two were spiked with
benzoylecgonine to 75% of the cutoff and 125% of the cutoff, the third was not spiked. No
positive or negative interference due to specific gravity was observed on either the BS-480
Chemistry Analyzer or the BS-800M Chemistry Analyzer.
Cross Reactivity
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of structurally related and
unrelated compounds into drug-free urine.
The following tables summarize approximate the quantity of each compound that is
equivalent in assay reactivity to the 150 ng/mL benzoylecgonine cutoff. Results are
expressed as a minimum concentration of metabolite or compound required to produce a
response approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay or the maximal
concentration of the compound tested that gave a response with cross-reactivity below the
cutoff calibrator. The percent cross-reactivity of those compounds are presented below.
