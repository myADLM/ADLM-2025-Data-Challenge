2. Linearity:
Linearity was evaluated using 10 levels of venous whole blood glucose concentrations (24.9,
40.3, 80.3, 149.8, 249.0, 340.0, 409.5, 508.8, 580.3 and 620.8 mg/dL) as determined by the
comparator method YSI 2300. Each glucose level was measured in replicates of 10 using 10
glucose meters and 3 lots of test strips, and the values from the Bioland Blood Glucose
Monitoring System were compared to the values obtained from the comparator method, YSI
2300. Linear regression analysis of the results yielded the following results:
Test strip lot 1: y = 0.9934 x + 2.1362 R2 = 0.9997
Test strip lot 2: y = 1.0042 x + 0.0776 R2 = 0.9996
Test strip lot 3: y = 1.0007 x - 0.0366 R2 = 0.9999
The results of the linearity study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range
of 40- 600 mg/dL. If a sample is less than 40 mg/dL glucose, the result is flagged by the
meter as “Lo”. If a sample exceeds 600 mg/dL glucose, the result is flagged by the meter as
“Hi”. The “Lo” and “Hi” functions were validated and demonstrated to function as intended.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
To assess potential interferences, a study was conducted using venous whole blood samples
adjusted to three glucose levels, as measured by the comparator method, YSI 2300: 50-70,
110-130 and 225-270 mg/dL. Each of these samples was divided into a test pool and a
control pool, with each of the potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances
added to the test pool. The sponsor tested 24 exogenous and endogenous substances. The
study was conducted using 3 lots of test strips and 10 meters, for a total of 30 replicates per
test sample. The difference between test sample and control sample meter results was
calculated. The table below shows the highest concentration of substance tested at which no
significant interference (as defined by the sponsor as ± 10 mg/dL for glucose concentrations
< 100 mg/dL and ± 10% for glucose concentrations > 100 mg/dL) was observed:

The sponsor included the following statements in the labeling:
- Acetaminophen in your blood (> 8.0 mg/dL) might affect the reliability of your blood
glucose results. If you are taking Tylenol, or other acetaminophen containing drugs, your
glucose results may not be reliable. If you are unsure, then ask your healthcare
professional.
- If you have a disease or condition that elevates your blood uric acid level (> 8.0 mg/dL),
such as gout, your blood glucose results may not be reliable. If you are unsure, then ask
your healthcare professional.
- Xylose: Do not test blood glucose during or soon after a xylose absorption test. Xylose in
the blood can give falsely elevated results.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range is 40 - 600 mg/dL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The Bioland Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to the NIST (SRM) 917A
glucose reference material. A method comparison was performed using the candidate device
and YSI 2300 as the comparator method.
Test Strip Stability
Test strip stability was assessed using real-time stability studies. Testing protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims a shelf life
stability of 24 months and an open vial stability of 90 days at the recommended storage
conditions of 39.2-104 °F (4-40°C) and relative humidity (RH) of 10%-85%.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
To assess the performance of Bioland Blood Glucose Monitoring System in the hands of the
intended users, the sponsor performed a study with 351 lay-user participants. The users were
responsible for obtaining their own fingertip capillary sample and performing a blood
glucose test according to the instructions and training materials routinely provided with the
system. A total of 100 Bioland meters and 3 lots of Bioland test strips were used. Results
were analyzed by comparing the blood glucose results obtained by the lay users with the
Bioland Test System against results obtained with the laboratory-based comparator method
(YSI 2300 glucose analyzer). The glucose concentrations in the samples ranged between 50.7
- 384 mg/dL, as measured by the YSI 2300. The set included 57 native samples with glucose
concentration < 80 mg/dL and 16 samples with glucose concentration > 250 mg/dL. The
results obtained with the candidate device were compared to the results obtained with the
comparator method, YSI 2300, and are summarized below:

A Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted, and the results demonstrate that the
Meter Manual and Test Strip Insert were written at an 8th grade level or less.
The study participants answered questions in two questionnaires for the investigator to
evaluate their understanding of the system after participating in the lay-user study. The
results demonstrated that the participants were able to understand the labeling and conduct
the testing on their own.
Accuracy at extreme glucose values:
To further assess the performance of the Bioland Blood Glucose Monitoring System at the
extreme upper and lower ends of the claimed measuring range, the sponsor altered 444
capillary whole blood samples, by spiking or allowing samples to glycolyze, to achieve
glucose concentrations below 80 mg/dL (216 samples; 32.1 – 79.9 mg/dL according to YSI
2300) and above 250 mg/dL (250 samples; 254.5 – 598.0 mg/dL according to YSI 2300).
Results obtained with the candidate device using three test strip lots and were compared the
results obtained with the comparator method, YSI 2300. The results are summarized below:

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1) Hematocrit Study:
The Bioland Blood Glucose Meter System was assessed at 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%,
45% 50%, 55% and 60% hematocrit levels, and at 5 glucose concentrations (30-50, 51-
110, 111-150, 151-250 and 251-400 mg/dL). Each sample was tested in replicates of 10
using 10 meters and 3 lots of test strips, for a total of 30 replicates per sample. The values
were compared with the glucose measurements obtained from YSI 2300 comparator
method. The % bias of the Bioland Blood Glucose Monitoring System relative to YSI 2300
demonstrated adequate performance to support the claimed hematocrit range of 20-60%.
2) Altitude study:
To assess the effect of altitude, venous whole blood samples adjusted to 5 glucose
concentrations covering the measuring range (30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250 and 251-
400 mg/dL) were tested at elevations of 298, 4790 and 10744 feet above sea level (0 feet)
in replicates of 10, using 10 meters and 3 lot of test strips, for a total of 30 replicates per
samples). Values measured by the candidate device were compared to the comparator
method YSI 2300. The results support the claim that the Bioland Blood Glucose
Monitoring System can be operated at altitudes of up to 10,744 ft.
3) Operating conditions (temperature, humidity):
The Bioland Blood Glucose Monitoring System was tested at different temperature and
humidity conditions to assess the effect of operation environment on the meter’s
performance. Temperatures ranging from 45-110°F (7.2-43.3°C) and relative humidity
from 10-90% were tested. Meter results were compared to the YSI 2300 comparator

method. Four temperature and humidity combinations were tested including low
temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low
humidity and high temperature/high humidity. Each of 3 venous whole blood glucose
levels (30-50; 111-150 and 251-400 mg/dL) were tested by 10 meters, using 3 lots of test
strips, for a total of 10 replicates per sample. Values measured by the Bioland Blood
Glucose Monitoring System were compared to the comparator method YSI 2300 method.
The study results support the labeled operating conditions claim of 50-104°F (10-40°C)
and 15-85% RH.
4) Sample volume study:
To verify the test strip minimum sample volume requirement (0.7 μL), venous whole
blood samples with the following glucose concentrations levels were used: 30-50 mg/dL,
111-150 mg/dL and 251-400 mg/dL. Sample volumes of 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8 μL were tested
using 10 meters and 3 lots of test strips for a total of 30 measurements per sample volume
per glucose level. Values obtained with the candidate device were compared to values
obtained using the comparator method (YSI 2300). When the sample volume is lower
than 0.7 μL the measurement procedure will not start and the meter gives an error
message. This feature was validated and was shown to function as intended. Results
support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.7 µL.
5) Flex Studies
Intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, testing with used test strips and a variety of
mechanical/durability testing (i.e., vibration test, drop test) was completed by the
sponsor. The testing performed demonstrated that the Bioland Blood Glucose Monitoring
System is robust to these expected use scenarios.
6) EMC
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing had been performed and the system was
found to be compliant.
7) Cleaning and disinfection robustness evaluation (Infection control studies)
The device is intended for a single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing
laboratory, demonstrating removal of the HBsAg antigen with the chosen disinfectant,
Clorox Germicidal Wipes (EPA Registration Number 67619-12). Robustness studies
were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in
performance or external materials of the meter after 3,650 cycles of cleaning and
disinfection using the chosen disinfectant. The robustness studies were designed to
simulate cleaning and disinfection over the 5-year single-patient use life of the meter.
Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and
disinfection procedures.
8) Test strip lot release criteria
The test strip lot release protocols and criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
