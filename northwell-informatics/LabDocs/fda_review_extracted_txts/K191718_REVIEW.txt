C Type of Test:
Quantitative, Particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay (PETIA)
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The BÜHLMANN fCAL turbo is an in vitro diagnostic assay intended for the quantitative
measurement of fecal calprotectin, a neutrophilic protein that is a marker of intestinal mucosal
inflammation, in human stool. The BÜHLMANN fCAL turbo aids in the diagnosis of
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), specifically Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)
and aids in the differentiation of IBD from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in conjunction with
other laboratory and clinical findings.
The BÜHLMANN CALEX Cap is a single use tube intended for the preparation of human stool
samples to be used with the BÜHLMANN fCAL turbo.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The BÜHLMANN fCAL turbo (herein referred to as fCAL turbo) is a particle-enhanced
turbidimetric immunoassay (PETIA) intended for the automated quantitative determination of
fecal calprotectin in human stool extracts using marketed clinical chemistry analyzers. The fCAL
turbo was cleared by the FDA under K190784; with the exception of labeling updates, there have
been no changes to the assay.
The CALEX Cap is a single use tube filled with Extraction Buffer. The device is used to sample
stool specimens and extract calprotectin. The CALEX Cap is an alternative to manual
extraction methods and leads to a final sample dilution of 1:500. Stool specimen extracts
K191718 - Page 2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
prepared using the CALEX Cap can be directly measured using the fCAL turbo.
B Principle of Operation:
The fCAL turbo test is a particle enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay (PETIA) which allows for
automated quantification of calprotectin in fecal extracts on clinical chemistry analyzers. Fecal
samples are extracted with extraction buffer using the manual weighing or CALEX Cap
sampling and extraction method and applied at a final dilution of 1:500. The extracts are
incubated with reaction buffer and mixed with polystyrene nanoparticles coated with
calprotectin-specific antibodies (immunoparticles).
Calprotectin available in the sample mediates immunoparticle agglutination. Sample turbidity,
measured by light absorbance, increases with calprotectin-immunoparticle complex formation
and is proportional to calprotectin concentration. The detected light absorbance allows
quantification of calprotectin concentration via interpolation on an established calibration curve.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability: No international reference material or reference measurement procedures are
available for calprotectin. Therefore, metrological traceability to international
