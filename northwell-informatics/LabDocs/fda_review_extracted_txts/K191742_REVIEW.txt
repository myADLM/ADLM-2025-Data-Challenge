III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
The ARIES MRSA Assay is an integrated, real-time, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based
qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the direct detection of methicillin–resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) DNA from nasal swabs in patients at risk for nasal colonization.
The ARIES MRSA Assay is intended to aid in the prevention and control of MRSA infections in
healthcare settings.
The assay is not intended to guide, diagnose, or monitor treatment for MRSA infections. It is not
intended to provide results of susceptibility to oxacillin/methicillin. A negative result does not
preclude MRSA nasal colonization. Concomitant cultures are necessary to recover organisms for
epidemiological typing or for further susceptibility testing.
The ARIES MRSA Assay is indicated for use with ARIES Systems.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Same as Intended Use
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
For use with ARIES Systems
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ARIES MRSA Assay is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based qualitative in vitro
diagnostic test system which consists of the ARIES System or the ARIES M1 System with their
included ARIES Software, a sample processing tube, an assay-specific cassette, and an assay-
specific protocol file. The ARIES MRSA Assay cassette is a disposable, single-use cassette
containing nucleic acid purification reagents, internal sample process control (SPC), and an
assay-specific master mix capable of performing the designated assay on one sample. The
ARIES MRSA Assay cassette directly detects methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) from nasal swabs in patients at risk of nasal colonization. Specifically, the ARIES
MRSA Assay cassette detects the methicillin resistance genes (mecA and mecC), Staphylococcus
aureus orfX gene, the SCCmec junction region, and a DNA Sample Processing Control.
Nasal swab specimens are collected using the Liquid Amies Elution Swab (ESwab) Collection
and Transport System, or equivalent. A portion of the sample is transferred to the provided 2 mL
ARIES MRSA Sample Processing Tube and vortexed. The processed sample is then transferred
to the ARIES MRSA Assay cassette.
K191742 - Page 2 of 19

--- Page 3 ---
The specimen is lysed and nucleic acid is extracted using the ARIES System. An extractable
sample processing control (SPC) target present in the ARIES MRSA Assay cassette is processed
with the specimen. The SPC controls for recovery of extracted nucleic acid, for inhibitory
substances and for PCR reagent and instrument integrity. The Ct value of the SPC is designed to
verify nucleic acid extraction, to identify PCR inhibition, if any, and verify proper function of the
extraction system and real-time instrument.
The extracted nucleic acid and SPC are transferred via magnetic beads through the cassette to the
ARIES MRSA Assay lyophilized PCR reagents in the PCR tube that contain primer pairs and
probes specific to mecA/mecC, orfX, SCCmec and the SPC sequence. Each probe is labeled with
a distinct fluorophore and detected in a distinct channel of an ARIES System. PCR amplification
is performed and assay fluorescence is monitored. Hybridization of a fluorescently labeled probe
to the amplified target results in the release of quenching and generation of fluorescence signal
that is indicative of PCR generated amplicon. Following amplification, the reaction is heated to
separate the fluorescent labeled probe from the amplified target, a process that results in a
decrease in the fluorescence signal. The reaction fluorescence is measured during this process
and the temperature at which the change in fluorescence is the maximum is the Tm of the
amplicon. The instrument fluorescence output is analyzed and test results are determined using
the ARIES System software and the ARIES MRSA Assay protocol and run files. ARIES MRSA
Assay results may be reported from the ARIES Software or from the optional SYNCT Software.
B Principle of Operation:
The ARIES MRSA Assay PCR amplification and detection reagents contain primers and probes
specific to the methicillin resistance genes (mecA and mecC), a Staphylococcus aureus complex
gene (orfX), the SCCmec region, and the Sample Processing Control (SPC) sequence. Each of
the probes are labeled with a distinct fluorophore and detected in distinct channels of the ARIES
System. The probes contain a fluorophore on the 5’ end of the oligonucleotide sequence and a
quencher at the 3’ end of the oligonucleotide sequence such that in random coil state when the
probe is not hybridized to the target sequence, the fluorescent signal is quenched. PCR
amplification is performed and assay fluorescence is monitored. Hybridization of a fluorescently
labeled probe to the amplified target results in the release of quenching and generation of
fluorescence signal that is indicative of PCR generated amplicon.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Site-to-Site Reproducibility
The reproducibility of the ARIES MRSA Assay between sites was evaluated in a study
performed by two operators at each of three sites over a period of five days. Each operator
tested a blinded panel of five samples in triplicate: two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) strains each spiked at 1x and 5x Limit of Detection (LoD) in simulated nasal
matrix (SNM) in modified Liquid Amies (LA) (spiked SNM+LA) and a negative sample
(unspiked SNM+LA) using the same lot of reagents (3 sites X 2 operators X 5 days X 3
replicates = 90 data points per panel member). The results of the study demonstrated
acceptable reproducibility from site-to-site at target levels close to the limit of detection
(LoD) of the assay. The reproducibility study results are presented in Table 1.

Bioinformatic Analysis
In silico analysis was performed to evaluate the potential for cross-reaction of the ARIES
MRSA Assay primers and probes. Non-specific amplification and detection of
Staphylococcus argenteus by the assay oligos was identified. An investigation into this
species indicates high sequence homology between S. argenteus and S. aureus in the orfX,
SCCmec and mecA/mecC regions, and that S. argenteus is a member of the S. aureus
complex. Due to the high sequence homology in the orfX, SCCmec and mecA/mecC regions
between S. argenteus and S. aureus, it would not be possible for the assay oligos to
distinguish between methicillin resistant S. argenteus and methicillin resistant S. aureus.
Carry-over/Contamination Study
The potential for false-positive results with the ARIES MRSA Assay due to within run or
between run cross-contamination was evaluated by testing an alternating series of MRSA
“high positive” and negative samples in 20 successive instrument runs using two ARIES
instruments. The high positive samples contained MRSA at a concentration of 107 CFU/mL
in simulated nasal matrix in modified Liquid Amies (SNM+LA). Negative samples
comprised SNM+LA alone. One replicate was reported Invalid on initial testing; reported as
Positive upon repeat testing. The expected results were obtained for all MRSA positive and
negative samples (60/60 each).
Potentially Interfering Substances Study
The potential for interference with the ARIES MRSA Assay was evaluated with endogenous
and exogenous substances that may be present in nasal swab specimens (Table 4). Each
substance was tested in triplicate in the presence and absence of one strain of mecA+ MRSA
(NR-46232) and one strain of mecC+ MRSA (BAA-2313) at 3x LoD prepared in simulated
nasal matrix in Modified Liquid Amies (SNM+LA). No false positives or false negatives
were obtained.

Microbial Interference Study
The potential for interference with the ARIES MRSA Assay by organisms that may be
present in nasal swab specimens was investigated using the same list of species that was
evaluated for potential cross-reactivity (refer to Table 3). Testing was performed in triplicate
with each potentially interfering species in the presence of one strain of mecA+ MRSA (NR-
46232) or one strain of mecC+ MRSA (BAA-2313) at 3x LoD. The potentially interfering
species were tested in triplicate in simulated nasal matrix in Modified Liquid Amies at 106
CFU/mL for non-viral organisms, 105 TCID50/mL for viruses and 5 μg/mL for human
genomic DNA. One replicate containing mecA+ MRSA was reported as Invalid for S.
gallinarum on initial testing but was MRSA positive upon repeat testing. One replicate
containing mecC+ MRSA strain was reported as Invalid for the specimens containing A.
baumannii, Rhinovirus type 1A and S. warneri Z113; however, each specimen was reported
as MRSA positive upon repeat testing. These results are acceptable.
Competitive Interference Study
Competitive interference was tested with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) at 1x the limit of detection (LoD) and the co-infecting agent, methicillin-susceptible
Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) or methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci
(MRCoNS), at increasing concentrations. Each combination was tested in triplicate. The
results showed that the ARIES MRSA Assay detected MRSA at 1x LoD in the presence of
high concentration of MSSA (~2E+04x LoD) or MRCoNS (~1E+05x LoD). No competitive
interference in the ARIES MRSA Assay was observed for co-infections of MRSA with
MSSA or MRCoNS.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Specimen Stability
The stability of nasal swabs for use with the ARIES MRSA Assay was evaluated analytically
by testing six replicates of each of two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
strains prepared at 3x and 10x Limit of Detection (LoD) in Natural Nasal Matrix (NNM) and
stored under different conditions. Unseeded negative sample (NNM only) was included to
assess the effect of specimen storage on the performance of the Sample Processing Control
(SPC). Specimens stored at 2±2°C were tested at 5 time points over 10 days and specimens
stored at 30±1°C were tested at 7 time points over 10 days. The results showed that MRSA
specimens stored at both temperatures (2°C and 30°C) generated 100% expected MRSA
positive results across all time points tested. An overall cassette invalid rate of 0.53% (4/757)
was observed for the testing of MRSA strains and NNM samples in this study. The results of
these studies support the stability of nasal swabs for use with the ARIES MRSA Assay when
collected using the Liquid Amies Elution Swab (Eswab) Collection and Transport system for
up to 10 days at 2-30°C.
Reagent Stability
The shelf-life of the ARIES MRSA Assay cassettes was evaluated in a real-time stability
study performed on three lots of reagents that were stored either refrigerated (2-8°C) or at
room temperature (15-30°C). The results from the study support assignment of an expiration
date 19 months from the day of manufacture for the assay cassettes when stored under the
recommended conditions.
Cassette open box stability evaluated the performance of the ARIES MRSA Assay Cassettes
after removal from the cassette pouch and exposed to ambient temperatures, humidity and
light for 10 hours. Over the course of 10 hours, all three lots of cassettes produced expected
results, showing that ARIES MRSA Assay Cassettes are stable in ambient temperatures for
up to 10 hours after they have been removed from the storage pouch.
Sample Processing Control
Each ARIES MRSA Assay cassette contains a Sample Processing Control (SPC) that is
designed to verify nucleic acid extraction, and proper reagent, cassette, ARIES System, and
assay protocol performance. The SPC has a known melting temperature (T ) range and Ct
m
range. Each time an assay is run, the system measures the temperature and fluorescence
intensity of the SPC control to ensure the thermal and optical subsystems have remained in
calibration.
External Controls
External controls should be tested according to guidelines or requirements of local,
provincial and/or federal regulations or accreditation organizations. A reference methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain or well characterized methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates may be used as positive controls. The ARIES MRSA
Assay Kit does not include external positive or negative controls.
K191742 - Page 11 of 19

--- Page 12 ---
External Positive and Negative Controls were tested on a daily basis during the prospective
Clinical Study using a total of five ARIES systems and three ARIES MRSA Assay cassette
lots. The Positive External Control comprised a standardized suspension of a strain of MRSA
at 1.95E+05 CFU/mL (10x LoD). The Negative External Control comprised a standardized
suspension of a strain of S. epidermis at 4.23E+04 CFU/mL (10x LoD). On initial testing,
182/183 (99.5%) Positive and 178/183 (97.3%) Negative External Controls produced the
expected results. Upon repeat testing, all controls produced the expected results.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the ARIES MRSA Assay was estimated for two strains of
MRSA by testing various dilutions of enumerated cell stocks in natural nasal matrix (NNM).
The LoD for each strain was then confirmed by testing a further 20 replicates at the lowest
target level that produced 100% positive results. The LoD was defined as the lowest
concentration tested at which ≥95% of assay replicates produced positive results. For MRSA
mecA+ BAA-2312, the LoD was determined to be 1.55 x 104 CFU/mL and for MRSA
mecC+ NRA-46232, it was 7.75 x 104 CFU/mL.
Inclusivity (Analytical Reactivity)
The inclusivity of the ARIES MRSA Assay was evaluated by testing 55 strains of MRSA in
simulated nasal matrix in Modified Liquid Amies (SNM+LA), which include those tested in
the LoD Study. All 55 strains produced 3/3 positive results at 3x LoD (2.32 x 105 CFU/mL
for mecC+ strains BAA-2312 and BAA-2313; 4.65 x 104 CFU/mL for all other strains).
Analytical reactivity study results are presented in Table 5.

Bioinformatic Analysis
The inclusivity of the ARIES MRSA primers and probes for the targeted regions of the
genome was analyzed in silico using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). The
region was shown to be well conserved, with nearly 100% of sequences with ≥ 85% identity
for orfX and mecA/mecC and approximately 93% of sequences with ≥ 85% identity for
SCCmec junction. These results are acceptable.
Challenge Study
An additional analytical study was carried out to evaluate the analytical performance of the
ARIES MRSA Assay using a panel of challenge strains (Table 6). The challenge panel

included 16 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains with high minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of ≥ 16 µg/mL oxacillin and 17 MRSA strains with
low MIC values of ≤ 8 µg/mL oxacillin, four borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (BORSA) strains, 16 empty cassette variants of Staphylococcus aureus strains, and
one methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) strain. The strains were tested
in triplicate at 3x LoD (MRSA strains) or 106 CFU/mL (all other strains). Two strains of
MRSA with high MIC values and one strain of MRSA with low MIC value did not generate
the expected MRSA positive results when tested at 3x LoD, and were re-tested at 5x LoD
and generated the expected MRSA positive results (100% MRSA Positive). The four
BORSA strains, the MRSE strain, and all empty cassette variants of Staphylococcus aureus
generated the expected 0% MRSA positive results (100% MRSA Negative). Analytical
challenge study results are presented in Table 6.

7. Assay Cut-Off:
For the ARIES MRSA Assay, each target (mecA/mecC, orfX, and SCCmec) has a Ct cut-off,
T
m
window, and T
m
Peak Threshold. In addition, the internal sample processing control
(SPC) also has a corresponding Ct cut-off, T
m
window, and T
m
Peak Threshold. Collectively,
the cut-off values compose the assay protocol file parameters, which are used to determine
the assay result for the detection of the target as Positive, Negative, or Invalid. These values
are hard-coded into the ARIES MRSA Assay Protocol File and are not modifiable. The
Assay Protocol File parameters were determined, and their performance in the ARIES MRSA
Assay were evaluated according to the following general procedure:
• Initial Assay Protocol File parameters were set during internal optimization and
benchmarking studies.
• The final Assay Protocol File parameters were then established during internal
verification studies using data from optimization, benchmarking and verification.
• The selected Assay Protocol File parameter values were utilized in the determination of
assay performance in the multi-site clinical trial conducted for the ARIES MRSA Assay.

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Not applicable.
2. Matrix Comparison:
Comparison of Performance with Natural and Simulated Matrices
To provide a sufficient quantity of material for testing, a simulated nasal matrix was used for
the majority of Analytical Studies. Testing with simulated matrix was performed in
accordance with the standard assay procedure by transferring 200µL of the sample to the
ARIES MRSA Assay cassette.

The suitability of the simulated matrix for use in analytical testing was evaluated in a
comparison study with natural clinical matrix. The two matrices were tested in parallel as
part of the LoD Study using MRSA strain NR-46232. The results demonstrated similar
analytical sensitivity in both matrices and there were negligible differences in LoD and
MRSA targets. The study therefore provided acceptable evidence to support the use of
simulated matrix in the Analytical Studies to characterize the performance of the ARIES
MRSA Assay.
Nasal Swab Comparison Study
A nasal swab equivalency study was performed to evaluate the reproducibility of the ARIES
MRSA Assay with two different nasal swab types, Regular Nylon Flocked Swab (Copan
Catalog Number: 480C) and Flexible Minitip Nylon Flocked Swab (Copan Catalog Number:
482C). The swabs were evaluated using one strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) mecA+ (NR-46232) at three concentrations, as well as a negative sample
(Simulated nasal matrix in Modified Liquid Amies, SNM+LA). Samples at intermediate
concentrations prepared in SNM+LA were transferred to Modified Liquid Amies using each
of the two nasal swab types to reach the final testing concentrations at 3x LoD, 5x LoD and
10x LoD, respectively, and then tested on the ARIES MRSA Assay. The test results
demonstrated that both swab types generated 100% expected MRSA positivity for each strain
of the concentrations tested. Both swab types also generated 0% positivity (100% negativity)
for negative samples. Swab equivalency study results are presented in Table 7.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Clinical performance of the ARIES MRSA Assay for nasal swab specimens collected from
patients at risk for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization was
established through a clinical study.
Performance of the ARIES MRSA Assay was evaluated prospectively from August 2018 to
February 2019 at four (4) geographically distinct clinical sites within the United States using
the ARIES System. Specimens included in the clinical study consisted of excess leftover de-
identified, nasal clinical specimens collected using the Liquid Amies Elution Swab (Eswab)
Collection and Transport system, or equivalent, from patients at risk for nasal colonization.
All eligible clinical specimens were tested by both the reference method (direct and enriched
bacterial culture) and ARIES MRSA Assay and the results compared. Reference method

testing was performed at a centralized testing facility while ARIES MRSA Assay testing was
performed at each clinical site on their own clinical specimens.
A total of 2254 nasal swab specimens from subjects at risk for MRSA nasal colonization
were collected. Of these 2,254 specimens, 472 were excluded from the study based on
inclusion/exclusion criteria leaving a total of 1,782 unique specimens that met the pre-
determined eligibility criteria for inclusion in the study.
In total, 1,782 specimens were enrolled in the study and tested for methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus by both the reference method and the ARIES MRSA Assay. There
were 20 specimens that when tested with ARIES MRSA Assay yielded an invalid result due
to run failure or instrument error giving an invalid rate of 1.1% (20/1,782). None of these
specimens were re-tested due to insufficient specimen volume.
For the 1,762 eligible specimens that were included in the device performance calculations,
clinical sensitivity of the ARIES MRSA Assay against direct and enriched bacterial culture
(Table 8), was 93.3% (97/104) with a lower bound 95% confidence interval of 87%. Clinical
specificity of the ARIES MRSA Assay was 93.5% (1550/1658) with a lower bound 95%
confidence interval of 92%. Of the 108 specimens that were MRSA-negative by culture but
MRSA-positive by the ARIES MRSA Assay, culture showed that 63 specimens were S.
aureus and 45 were negative (no growth).
When ARIES MRSA Assay was compared to Direct Culture only (Table 9), the positive
percent agreement of the ARIES MRSA Assay was 93.5% (87/103) with a lower bound 95%
confidence interval of 87%. Negative percent agreement of the ARIES MRSA Assay was
92.9% (1550/1658) with a lower bound 95% confidence interval of 92%. Overall,
performance was determined to be acceptable.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The performance of the ARIES MRSA Assay was evaluated in a prospective Clinical Study
conducted at four (4) sites in the US. The overall prevalence of MRSA in nasal swab specimens
was 5.9% (104/1762) as determined by culture (direct plus enriched) and 11.6% (205/1762) as
determined by the ARIES assay. In Table 10, the prevalence of MRSA as determined by the
ARIES assay is stratified by the age and gender of the subjects.
