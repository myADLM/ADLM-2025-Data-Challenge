in clinical laboratories as an in vitro test to determine the susceptibility of clinically significant
aerobic Gram-negative bacilli to antimicrobial agents when used as instructed.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
• Rx - For Prescription Use Only
• The ability of the AST card to detect non-susceptible strains with the following
combination(s) is unknown because an insufficient number of non-susceptible strains were
available at the time of comparative testing.
Eravacycline: C. freundii, C. koseri, E. coli, K. oxytoca
K191766 - Page 2 of 13

--- Page 3 ---
• The lack of an intermediate category has shown very major discrepancies when compared to
the reference method. Testing should be repeated using an alternative method prior to
reporting results for the following antibiotic/organism combination(s):
Eravacycline: Klebsiella pneumoniae when the MIC is 0.5 µg/mL
D Special Instrument Requirements:
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems using VITEK 2 Systems 9.03 software
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2
AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on
all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the
nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45% to
0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The
VITEK 2 System will automatically (or allow operator to manually) dilute the bacterial
suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then, the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and
place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing, and
loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based
on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the
minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the antimicrobial agent. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with
the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Eravacycline has the following concentrations in the card: 0.25,
1, 2 and 4 μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL). The
eravacycline MIC result range for the VITEK 2 is ≤0.12 to ≥4 μg/mL. For all species, the
VITEK 2 system is capable of reporting the following MIC results: ≤0.12, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 and ≥4
μg/mL for the AST-Gram Negative Eravacycline test.
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems use visible light to
directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is
based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes
throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light
transmittance readings of each well determine organism growth by the amount of light that is
prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC
values and their associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are
displayed in an automatically generated report.

VI Standards/Guidance Documents Referenced:
• FDA Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST)
Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA (Issued August 28, 2009)
• CLSI M07-A10, “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria that Grow
Aerobically; Approved Standard-Ninth Edition” Vol. 35 No. 2 (January 2015)
• CLSI M100, “Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing”; Twenty-ninth
Edition (January 2019)
VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing for the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Eravacycline was conducted at
three external clinical sites using a panel of ten Gram-negative bacilli consistent with the
indications for use (i.e., two Enterobacter cloacae, two Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumoniae
and six Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates). Each isolate was tested in triplicate over three days
for a total of 270 data points. Inocula were prepared using both the auto-dilution and manual
dilution methods for testing in the VITEK 2 System. In addition, inocula were prepared by
the manual dilution method for use with the VITEK 2 Compact. The mode of MIC values
was determined for each isolate and the reproducibility was calculated based on the number
of MIC values that fell within ±1 doubling dilution of the mode.
All MIC values were on-scale and within one doubling dilution of the mode MIC. The testing
resulted in overall reproducibility of 100% (270/270) for each dilution method for testing in
the VITEK 2 System (auto-dilution and manual dilution) and VITEK 2 Compact System
(manual dilution only).
The results are acceptable.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Quality Control (QC) Testing:
The CLSI recommended QC strains, namely E. coli ATCC 25922 and P. aeruginosa ATCC
27853 were tested a sufficient number of times (i.e., at least 20/site) at each testing site using
both the VITEK 2 card and broth microdilution (BMD) reference methods. Both the
automatic dilution and manual dilution methods were used for the VITEK 2 and the manual
dilution method was used for the VITEK 2 Compact.
Both the auto-dilution and the manual dilution methods for VITEK 2 and the manual dilution
for VITEK 2 Compact QC results are summarized in Table 1 below. Obtaining a VITEK
result of ≤ 0.125 µg/mL (lowest dilution on the card) for E. coli ATCC 25922 and/or ≥ 4
µg/mL (highest dilution on the card) for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 was considered as an
indicator that the quality control test results were acceptable.
Because the VITEK card reporting range (≤0.125- ≥ 4 µg/mL) does not include the full
CLSI/FDA-recommended dilution range for QC testing, the sponsor included a footnote in
labeling to indicate that the device does not include the full CLSI/FDA-recommended
dilution range for QC testing. The sponsor also included the following footnote in labeling:
Although the VITEK 2 AST-GN Eravacycline calling range for Enterobacteriaceae is
0.12 - >4 µg/mL, the VITEK 2 AST-GN Eravacycline QC calling range for P.
aeruginosa, ATCC 27853 is 0.12 - >8 µg/mL
The quality control results are acceptable.

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Testing of eravacycline on the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card was performed at three
external sites and one internal site. There were 320 clinical isolates and 144 challenge
isolates tested for a total of 464 isolates. Results obtained with the VITEK 2 AST-Gram
Negative card with eravacycline were compared to results obtained with the CLSI broth
microdilution reference panel. The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative
Eravacycline is ≤0.12 – ≥4 μg/mL for all species. The reference panel contained two-fold
serial dilutions with a range of ≤0.008 to ≥32 μg/mL. The testing conditions for the reference
method consisted of the following:
• Medium – Cation Adjusted Mueller Hinton broth
• Inoculum – Direct colony suspension
• Incubation – 35°C; 16-20 hours
The VITEK 2 AST cards were inoculated with test organisms using the auto-dilution method
(VITEK 2) and using the manual dilution method (VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact). All test
inocula used for the VITEK 2 AST cards and the reference method were standardized using
the DensiCHEK Plus instrument.
A total of 320 clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates were evaluated: 52.8% were considered
contemporary isolates (isolated from clinical specimen and tested within 7 days) and 47.2%
were stock isolates. One isolate did not grow in the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative
Eravacycline test so complete test results are available for 319 clinical isolates: 312 isolates
from indicated species (12 C. freundii, 7 C. koseri, 39 K. aerogenes, 19 E. cloacae, 22 E.
cloacae complex, 121 E. coli, 23 K. oxytoca, 4 K. pneumoniae pneumoniae and 65 K.
pneumoniae) and 7 isolates from non-indicated species (1 C. braakii, 2 E. vulneris, 1 L.
amnigena 2, 2 P. dispersa and 1 R. ornithinolytica). The clinical isolates were tested with the
auto-dilution option of the VITEK 2.
A total of 144 challenge isolates (1 C. freundii, 7 K. aerogenes, 13 E. cloacae, 12 E. coli, 1
K. oxytoca, 15 K. pneumoniae pneumoniae, and 95 K. pneumoniae) were evaluated at one
site. The challenge set was tested with the auto-dilution and manual dilution options of the
VITEK 2 and with the manual dilution method on the VITEK 2 Compact.
At the time of comparative testing, non-susceptible isolates were not available for
Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella oxytoca. Thus, the
following statement is included in the Limitations section of the device labeling:
The ability of the AST card to detect non-susceptible strains with the following
combination(s) is unknown because an insufficient number of non-susceptible strains
were available at the time of comparative testing.
Eravacycline: C. freundii, C. koseri, E. coli, K. oxytoca
To address testing of non-indicated species, the following statement is included in the
Precautions section of the device labeling:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and
efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this
K191766 - Page 8 of 13

--- Page 9 ---
AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled
clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those
found in the indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of
susceptibility information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for
specific antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is
approved.
Clinical and Challenge Data –VITEK 2 Auto-Dilution
The results obtained using the auto-dilution method of the VITEK 2 from the 463 total
isolates (319 clinical isolates and 144 challenge isolates) are summarized in Table 2.

When using the auto-dilution method of the VITEK 2, the overall performance with all
Enterobacteriaceae is acceptable with an EA of 97.0% and a CA of 99.1%. As summarized
in Table 4, there were two very major errors (2/60 = 3.3%) and two major errors (2/403 =
0.5%). Due to the lack of an intermediate interpretive criteria (Eravacycline has only a
“susceptible” category), further analysis of the errors is performed and adjustments are made
by considering the MIC values where the errors occurred. One of the very major errors had
an MIC value that was one doubling dilution from the reference and thus in essential
agreement. Therefore, the adjusted very major error is one (1/60 = 1.7%) which is acceptable.
The other very major error and both major errors resulted when VITEK 2 AST-Gram
Negative Eravacycline was test with K. pneumoniae.
Challenge Data –VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Manual Dilution
The 144 challenge isolates were also evaluated at one site with the manual dilution options of

The overall performance of VITEK 2 when using the manual dilution method with all
Enterobacteriaceae challenge isolates is acceptable with an EA of 98.6% and a CA of
96.5%. As summarized in Table 4, there were two very major errors (2/40 = 5%) and three
major errors (3/104 = 2.9%). Both very major errors had MIC values that were one doubling
dilution from the reference and thus in essential agreement. Therefore, the adjusted very
major error is zero which is acceptable.
The overall performance of VITEK 2 Compact when using the manual dilution method with
all Enterobacteriaceae challenge isolates is acceptable with an EA of 97.9% and a CA of
97.2%. As summarized in Table 4, there were three very major errors (3/40 = 7.5%) and one
major error (1/104 = 1.0%). Two of the very major errors had MIC values that were one
doubling dilution from the reference and thus in essential agreement. Therefore, the adjusted
very major error is one (1/40 = 2.5%), which is unacceptable but addressed as a limitation in
the package insert.
K. pneumoniae reported a high number of major and very major errors due to the lack of an
intermediate or resistant interpretive category for eravacycline. These error rates are reported
in the package insert, however, the error rates are adjusted by taking into consideration the
essential agreement with the reference method of MIC values resulting in the errors. The
original and adjusted error rates are shown in Table 4.

To address the high rate of very major errors, the following statement is included as a
footnote to the performance table in the package insert:
The overall categorical very major error rate for eravacycline when testing
Enterobacteriaceae clinical and challenge isolates with the VITEK 2 system was 3.3%.
Based on the essential agreement and lack of an intermediate breakpoint for eravacycline,
the overall adjusted very major error rate for Enterobacteriaceae clinical and challenge
isolates is 1.7% which is acceptable.

In addition, to address the K. pneumoniae very major errors and the reporting of non-
susceptible isolates, the following statement is included in the Limitations section of the
package insert:
The lack of an intermediate category has shown very major discrepancies when
compared to the reference method. Testing should be repeated using an alternative
method prior to reporting results for the following antibiotic/organism combination(s):
Eravacycline: Klebsiella pneumoniae when the MIC is 0.5 µg/mL
Resistance Mechanism Characterization:
Challenge isolates of Enterobacteriaceae harboring various molecular mechanisms of
resistance noted in the FDA drug label were tested with eravacycline. The following
resistance mechanisms were evaluated: tet(A) and tet(B).
MIC Trends:
A trending analysis was conducted using the combined data (clinical and challenge) obtained
from the VITEK 2 auto-dilution method for each organism species and group. This trending
calculation analyzes device MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling
dilutions lower or higher than the reference method. MIC values that are off-scale for both
the reference and device are not considered in the trending analysis.
Trending results were stratified by species to determine if species-related trends were
observed (Table 5). Species for which the difference between the percentage of isolates with
higher or lower MIC values was ≥30% with a statistically significant confidence interval
were considered to have evidence of trending.

1There were not enough C. koseri isolates to be appropriately evaluated for trending.
2E. cloacae and E. cloacae complex were consolidated into a single group, E. cloacae.
3K. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae pneumoniae were consolidated into a single group, K. pneumoniae.
A trend toward lower MIC values was observed for the Enterobacteriaceae family,
specifically when testing for C. freundii, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. coli, and K.
pneumoniae. The following footnote to the performance table is included in the package
insert to address the trending observed for VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Eravacycline:
VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Eravacycline values tended to be in exact agreement or at
least one doubling dilution lower when testing Enterobacteriaceae compared to the CLSI
reference broth microdilution.

IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the VITEK 2 AST-GN Eravacycline when revised breakpoints for
eravacycline are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included
with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, bioMérieux will update the
eravacycline device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section
after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any
new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
