B Principle of Operation:
The ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA is performed on stool samples, collected
without preservatives. After an extraction procedure of the stool sample, using either the manual
weighing or Easy Extraction Device procedure, the test allows the selective measurement of
calprotectin-antigen by sandwich ELISA. A monoclonal capture antibody (mAb), specific to the
calprotectin heterodimeric and polymeric complexes, is coated onto the microtiter plate.
Calibrators, controls and specimen extracts are incubated. After a washing step, a biotinylated
secondary monoclonal detection antibody detects the calprotectin molecules bound to the antibody
coated onto the plate. After incubation and a further washing step, a Streptavidin-Horseradish
Peroxidase Enzyme conjugate binds to the available biotin on the immobilized secondary antibody.
A chemiluminescent substrate is added and read when the substrate glows as a result of its
oxidation with the enzyme. The signal is then read on a chemiluminescent plate reader.
The ALPCO Easy Stool Extraction Device is an alternative to the manual weighing extraction
method and it acquires the amount of stool necessary to perform the ALPCO Calprotectin
Chemiluminescence ELISA directly from the primary specimen container. The device consists of
a tube, containing 1.5 mL of extraction buffer, and a stick shaped with ten grooves for collecting
the sample. The upper end of the device is made up of two parts which can be removed with two
separate rotations: the yellow screw cap (connected to the plastic stick with grooves) is removed
by twisting counter-clockwise. The blue lower part (for retaining the excess material) is removed
by twisting clockwise. After completion of the extraction procedure, both the yellow and blue
upper parts are removed, allowing access to the prepared stool sample extracts. The device does
not collect aqueous stool sample. The ALPCO Easy Stool Extraction Device is sold separately.

2. Linearity:
The matrix linearity and aqueous linearity of the analytical measuring range of the ALPCO
Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA were evaluated internally at ALPCO in accordance
with CLSI EP06-A.
To evaluate matrix linearity, a stool sample extract containing a high concentration of fecal
calprotectin was serially diluted 1:2 with a stool sample extract containing a low
concentration of fecal calprotectin to obtain dilution levels with values that cover the AMR.
Stool sample extracts were obtained using the Easy Extraction method. Each stool sample
extract combination was assayed in duplicate.
To evaluate aqueous linearity, a sample made by diluting native antigen in standard diluent
buffer containing stabilizers and preservatives (the same buffer used to make the controls and
calibrators) was serially diluted 1:2 (12 dilutions) with standard diluent buffer to obtain
dilution levels with values that cover the entire AMR. Each aqueous sample dilution was
assayed in duplicate.
The results are summarized in the table below:

Accuracy/Recovery:
The accuracy/recovery of the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA was
evaluated using seven extracted stool samples containing various concentrations of
calprotectin across the analytical measuring range of the assay, samples were extracted using
the Easy Extraction method. The stool sample extracts were mixed with the spiking material
in a proportion of 9:1 (9 parts sample: 1-part spiking material). Native calprotectin diluted in
standard diluent was used as the spiking material. Samples were run in duplicate. Percent
recovery ranges from 89.7% to 110.8%. The results are as follows:

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference: The interference testing of the ALPCO Calprotectin
Chemiluminescence ELISA was evaluated internally at ALPCO following CLSI guideline
EP07-3rd Edition. The study was performed using seven samples, one very high positive
stool sample, one high positive stool sample, one moderately high positive stool sample, one
low positive stool sample, one stool sample in the indeterminate range, and two negative
stool samples. Interfering substances were spiked into each stool sample at 10% of the total
specimen volume. The solvent used to create the interferent stock was spiked into each stool
sample at 10% of the total specimen volume to generate a control sample. Samples were run
in singlicate. The results are summarized in the table below:

6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB)
The limit of blank of the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA was determined
in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2. Four blank stool samples were extracted and tested in
replicates of six on two reagent lots across three days. The LoB was estimated as the 95th
percentile for the distribution of blank sample results. The LoB was determined to be 3.6
µg/g by the nonparametric method.
Limit of Detection (LoD)
The limit of detection of the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA was
determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2. Four stool samples containing a low level of
calprotectin were extracted and tested in replicates of five on two reagent lots across three
days. The LoD was determined to be 7.7 µg/g.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
The limit of quantitation of the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA was
determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2. Six stool samples containing a low level of
calprotectin were extracted and tested in replicates of five on two reagent lots across three
days. The LoQ estimate for each reagent lot was determined as the measurand concentration
at the intersection of the precision profile curve with the accuracy total within laboratory
imprecision goal of 20 %CV. The maximum value obtained for each reagent lot was reported
as the LoQ. The LoQ was determined to be 7.9 µg/g.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
To verify the low clinical cut-off value (50 μg/g), OPKO tested normal stool samples
obtained from asymptomatic individuals with no abdominal complaints and no history of
IBS, IBD or other chronic intestinal disorders. The ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence
ELISA cut-offs are summarized in the table below:
Calprotectin Concentration Interpretation Follow-Up
< 50 µg/g Normal None
50 - 100 µg/g Equivocal Retest in 4-6 weeks
> 100 µg/g Elevated Repeat as clinically indicated
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed comparing the ALPCO Calprotectin
Chemiluminescence ELISA and the predicate device. 400 samples that were used to
determine the clinical performance characteristics of the ALPCO Calprotectin
Chemiluminescence ELISA were tested on the predicate device and the subject
device according to the manufacturer-supplied labeling. Testing using the predicate device
was conducted at two U.S. sites. Results are calculated considering equivocal results as both
positive and negative.
A qualitative agreement analysis between the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence
ELISA and the predicate device was conducted including all samples that were tested on both
devices (N=400) using the cut-offs of both products to calculate the positive percent

NPA 229/246 93.1% (89.2–95.6%)
TPA 301/400 75.3% (70.8–79.2%)
Equivocal results considered negative (95% CI):
PPA 38/74 51.4% (40.2–62.4%)
NPA 305/326 93.6% (90.4–95.7%)
TPA 343/400 85.8% (82.0–88.8%)
An analytical method comparison was conducted including the samples that were within the
analytical measuring range of both assays (N=169); results had to measure within 27.1–3000
mg/kg on the predicate device and 7.9–6000 µg/g on the ALPCO Calprotectin
Chemiluminescence ELISA. A scatter plot was created by plotting the values obtained with
the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA (Y-axis) against the predicate device
(X-axis) and analyzed by Passing-Bablok regression analysis. The slope, y-intercept, and
correlation-r were determined. The 95% CI of the slope and intercept was determined using
the bootstrap technique. The results are summarized in the table below:
N 169
Slope (95% CI) 0.6919 (0.5760, 0.8777)
Y-Intercept (95% CI) -18.35 (-29.54, -11.13)
Correlation-r 0.784
2. Extraction Method Comparison:
The Easy Extraction method and manual weighing method of the ALPCO Calprotectin
Chemiluminescence ELISA were evaluated to determine if the extraction methods provide
similar results. The study was performed using one kit lot of ALPCO Calprotectin
Chemiluminescence ELISA by one operator. Sixty-eight stool samples with varying
consistency on the Bristol Scale and various fecal calprotectin concentrations across the
reportable range and near the clinical cut-offs of the ALPCO Calprotectin
Chemiluminescence ELISA were extracted in parallel using both the Easy Extraction method
and manual weighing method. Results were analyzed in singlicate. 61 of the samples were
within the AMR and included in the analysis. A scatter plot was created by plotting the
values obtained from the Easy Extraction method extracts (Y-axis) against the manual
weighing method extracts (X-axis) and analyzed by Passing-Bablok regression analysis. The

determined by comparing analytical test results of the prospectively collected stool specimens
against the clinical diagnosis made by the clinical investigator/gastroenterologist (reference
standard):
• IBD diagnosis was based on endoscopy results and/or histology of biopsies taken during
the endoscopy.
• IBS diagnosis was based on the Rome IV criteria and confirmed by negative endoscopy
including the colon and terminal ileum.
• Subjects were diagnosed with “Other GI conditions” when they did not meet the
diagnostic criteria for IBD and IBS (Rome IV).

Other Clinical Supportive Data
Not applicable
D Clinical Cut-Off:
See assay cut-off (Section A.7)
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
To verify the low clinical cut-off value (50 μg/g), normal stool samples were obtained from
asymptomatic individuals with no abdominal complaints and no history of IBS, IBD or other
chronic intestinal disorders. This study cohort was separate from those used to establish
estimates of the clinical performance of the test device. 130/131 of the samples were
normal/negative with the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA. Values ranged from
<7.9 μg/g to 75.1 μg/g, with 86/131 samples measuring below the lower end of the AMR.
The 90% confidence intervals for the lower and upper 95% reference limits of the 131 healthy
individuals were determined by the non-parametric quantile method, in accordance with
CLSI guidline EP28-A3c. The results are as follows:
Lower Limit (90% CI): 0.7 μg/g (0.5–0.9 μg/g)
Upper Limit (90% CI): 37.7 μg/g (30.9–75.1 μg/g)
