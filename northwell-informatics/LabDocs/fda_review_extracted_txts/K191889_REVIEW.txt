III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
NG-Test CARBA 5 is an in vitro rapid and visual multiplex immunochromatographic assay for
the qualitative detection and differentiation of five common carbapenemases (KPC, OXA-48-
like, VIM, IMP and NDM) from carbapenem non-susceptible pure bacterial colonies when
grown on the following media:
• 5% sheep blood agar or MacConkey agar (16-24 hours) for testing Enterobacteriaceae and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
• HardyCHROM CRE agar (18-24 hours) for testing E. coli and KES (Klebsiella aerogenes,
Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae complex and Serratia
marcescens).
The NG-Test CARBA 5 is intended as an aid for infection control in the detection of
carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in healthcare
settings. NG-Test CARBA 5 is not intended to guide or monitor treatment for carbapenem non-
susceptible bacterial infections. A positive or negative NG-Test CARBA 5 test result does not
rule out the presence of other mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. NG-Test CARBA 5 should be
used in conjunction with other laboratory tests including phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility
testing.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
• Rx - For Prescription Use Only
• The performance of NG-Test CARBA 5 was established with colonies from blood agar,
MacConkey agar and HardyCHROM CRE agar. Performance with other culture media has
not been evaluated and is therefore unknown.
• The performance of NG-Test CARBA 5 with bacteria other than Enterobacteriaceae and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa has not been evaluated.
• Organism identification and elevated carbapenem MICs should be determined prior to testing
with NG-Test CARBA 5.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
None (results are read manually)

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
NG-Test CARBA 5 (Figure 1) is an in vitro rapid and visual multiplex
immunochromatographic assay that detects one or more of the five common
types of carbapenemase enzymes (KPC, OXA-48-like, IMP, VIM, NDM) in
bacterial colonies of species usually associated with harboring these
resistance markers. The assay consists of a sample port, sample pad and
nitrocellulose test strip which are contained within a plastic cassette, in
addition to reagents for liquid extraction.
B Principle of Operation:
Monoclonal antibodies that individually recognize each of the five carbapenemases are
immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane. Free monoclonal antibodies are present in the sample
pad and labelled with colloidal gold. Colonies are mixed with extraction buffer to lyse the
bacteria then added to the sample pad. Capillary action of the nitrocellulose draws the sample
through the mobile antibodies and immobile antibodies on the test strip. The immobilized control
antibodies capture any mobile antibodies that run through the sample pad and nitrocellulose
without binding to other test lines. After addition of the bacterial suspension to the sample port, a
result can be read after 15 minutes. Possible results include Positive (for one or more target),
Negative or Invalid. A positive result occurs when a red line appears on the control region
(marked “C”) and one or more lines appear in the test regions (marked “K”, “O”, “V”, “I”, or
“N”). This result indicates that the sample contains one or more carbapenemases. A negative
result occurs when only the control line is observed and indicates that the sample does not
contain any of the 5 carbapenemases. If the control line does not appear, the test result is invalid.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of NG-Test CARBA 5 was evaluated in a study conducted with four lots
of tests at three sites. The reproducibility panel of organisms comprised eight well-
characterized strains of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa that produce at least one of the
targeted carbapenemases (Table 1.1) and two negative control organisms (Table 1.2).
Two of the eight carbapenemase-positive organisms co-produced two carbapenemases so that
a total of ten positive test results (two for each of the five carbapenemase targets) was
expected per panel. Each panel member was sub-cultured, in duplicate, onto blood agar or
MacConkey agar and incubated at 35°C for 16 to 24 hours. After growth, colonies from each
plate were tested each day by two operators over five days at each site (3 sites x 2 operators x
5 days x 2 targets x 2 replicates = 120 positive samples per target carbapenemase per medium
type).

The design of the strip also allows for interpretation of negative results, resulting in multiple
expected negative results per strip. Both carbapenemase-negative organisms were expected
to generate five negative results per test strip (Table 1.2). The six carbapenemase-positive
organisms that produced a single carbapenemase were expected to produce four negative
results (Table 1.1). The two carbapenemase-positive organisms that co-produced two
carbapenemases were expected to generate three negative results (Table 1.1). Therefore, a
total of 2400 negative results were expected from all organisms combined:
(2 carbapenemase-negative organisms x 5 negative tests) + (6 carbapenemase-positive
organisms x 4 negative results) + (2 carbapenemase-positive organisms x 3 negative results)]
x 3 sites x 2 operators x 5 days x 2 replicates = 2400 negative results.

All positive and negative results for each targeted carbapenemase were as expected
(i.e., 120/120 [100%] positive results for each carbapenemase target and 2400/2400 [100%]
negative results). The reproducibility of NG-Test CARBA 5 was determined to be
acceptable.

3. Analytical Specificity/Cross Reactivity:
The analytical specificity of the NG-Test CARBA 5 was evaluated using organisms that were
carbapenem-susceptible or carbapenem non-susceptible with antibiotic resistance
mechanisms other than those targeted by the NG-Test CARBA 5. A panel of 81 isolates were
tested after growth on blood agar and MacConkey agar (54 Enterobacteriaceae, 20
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 7 phylogenetically related organisms). A panel of 16 select
Enterobacteriaceae (i.e., E. coli and KES [Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella oxytoca,
Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae complex and Serratia marcescens]) isolates
were tested after being seeded in raw stool or stool in C&S Cary Blair Transport Media,
followed by sub-culture and growth on HardyCHROM CRE agar.
The organism groups and their relevant molecular characteristics used in the analytical cross-
reactivity study is provided in Table 2. All organisms tested from blood and MacConkey
agar (81/81, 100%) and from HardyCHROM CRE agar (16/16, 100%) yielded a negative
NG-Test CARBA 5 result. The cross-reactivity of the NG-Test CARBA 5 was determined to
be acceptable.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a) Agar Incubation Study
The ability of the NG-Test CARBA 5 to consistently provide correct results over the
range of recommended incubation times was evaluated using carbapenem non-
susceptible isolates previously characterized to have a target carbapenemase. Twenty-two
strains were tested after growth on blood and MacConkey agar every two hours from
16 – 24 hours of incubation. Fifteen of the 22 organisms were also tested after growth on
HardyCHROM CRE every two hours from 18 – 24 hours of incubation. All organisms
tested produced the expected result on NG-Test CARBA 5 at each time point tested.
b) Refrigerated Storage Study
To evaluate whether organism cultures (plated on agar media) stored in the refrigerator
could be used with NG-Test CARBA 5, strains were evaluated each day for three days
after refrigeration. Twelve strains were first tested after growth on blood and MacConkey
agar. Ten of the 12 strains were also tested after growth on HardyCHROM CRE agar. All
organisms tested produced the expected result on NG-Test CARBA 5 for each day of
refrigeration.
c) Quality Control
Quality control testing was performed each day of the clinical study. The QC panel
consisted of one positive control organism for each target carbapenemase and one
negative control organism (Table 3). The QC testing gave the expected results each day
of testing.
Table 3. QC Strains used for NG-Test CARBA 5 evaluation

Escherichia coli NCTC 13476 Positive IMP (I) Line
Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC BAA-2146 Positive NDM (N) Line
Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC BAA-1706 No Positive Test Lines
1 Positive Control Line (C) is expected for results to be considered valid.
2 According to CLSI document M100, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC BAA-1705 may undergo
spontaneous loss of the plasmid encoding the carbapenemase, leading to false-negative QC results.
This strain should be maintained on a carbapenem-containing medium or with a selective antimicrobial
disk on non-selective agar prior to QC testing.
6. Detection Limit:
Analytical Reactivity/Inclusivity
The analytical reactivity (inclusivity) of NG-Test CARBA 5 was evaluated using a panel of
92 isolates previously characterized to have a targeted carbapenemase (Table 4): 66
Enterobacteriaceae isolates (expected to provide 68 positive results) and 26 P. aeruginosa
isolates (expected to provide 26 positive results). All 92 isolates were tested in triplicate after
growth on blood agar and MacConkey agar. Forty-two select Enterobacteriaceae (i.e., E. coli
and KES) isolates of the panel (expected to provide 44 positive results) were also tested in
triplicate after being seeded in raw stool or stool in C&S Cary Blair Transport Media and
cultured on HardyCHROM CRE agar. Organisms that yielded a negative NG-Test CARBA 5

result were further analyzed by modified Carbapenemase Inactivation Method (mCIM, as
described in CLSI M100, 29th Edition). Negative NG-Test CARBA 5 results that yielded
negative mCIM results were determined to be true negatives. Negative NG-Test CARBA 5
results that yielded positive mCIM results were determined to be false negatives.

A summary of the analytical reactivity data is provided in Table 5. NDM-1 and IMP-26 from
two P. mirabilis isolates were detected after bacterial growth on MacConkey agar but not on
blood agar. The following statement is included as a footnote to the performance table in the
device labeling:
NDM-1 and IMP-26 not detected in P. mirabilis growth from blood agar, but yielded
positive results from MacConkey agar.
Of the variants tested, P. aeruginosa harboring IMP-14 and IMP-18 were not detected by the
NG-Test CARBA 5. The following statement is included as a limitation in the device labeling:
False negative results have been observed with IMP-14 and IMP-18.
The analytical reactivity of the NG-Test CARBA 5 for detection of carbapenemases in
Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa was determined to be acceptable.

1. Clinical Sensitivity:
The performance of the NG-Test CARBA 5 was initially evaluated in a Clinical Study that
was conducted at three U.S. sites using 150 prospectively collected isolates (recovered fresh
or less than 6 months prior to testing) and 149 retrospectively collected isolates (stock,
recovered more than 6 months prior to testing) of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. These isolates were used to evaluate performance of NG-Test CARBA 5 using
bacterial colonies grown on blood and MacConkey agar. A subset of these isolates was
selected based on the intended use of the HardyCHROM CRE agar and used in an internal
study to evaluate performance of the NG-Test CARBA 5 after bacterial growth on this
medium.
To be enrolled in the study and included in the analysis of performance, retrospective isolates
must have been (i) identified to the species level and (ii) determined to be non-susceptible to
at least one carbapenem antimicrobial agent by an FDA-cleared susceptibility test method or
harbor any carbapenem-resistance marker. All prospective isolates were enrolled regardless
of carbapenem susceptibility.
Ertapenem disks were routinely used to maintain selective pressure for isolated colonies of
retrospective Enterobacteriaceae isolates while no selective pressure was used for isolated
colonies of retrospective P. aeruginosa isolates. Carbapenem susceptibility of each isolate
was verified by disk diffusion using ertapenem (Enterobacteriaceae only), imipenem and
meropenem while carbapenemase production was evaluated using the modified

Performance of NG-Test CARBA 5 after bacterial growth on blood and MacConkey agar
with the 240 Enterobacteriaceae isolates that provided 244 results (four isolates co-produced
two carbapenemase targets) is summarized in Table 7.1. Performance after bacterial growth
on blood and MacConkey agar with the 69 P. aeruginosa isolates that provided 69 results is
summarized in Table 7.2. One isolate that was initially enrolled was excluded from the
analysis because it was a species of Pseudomonas other than P. aeruginosa. There were no
NDM or OXA-48-like P. aeruginosa isolates enrolled in the study. This is addressed in the
following statement that is included in the performance section in the device labeling:
For P. aeruginosa, there were no OXA-48-like or NDM enrolled. However, P.
aeruginosa with NDM (n=2) were evaluated analytically in the bench testing.

To evaluate the performance of NG-Test CARBA 5 after bacterial growth on HardyCHROM
CRE agar, was evaluated using a subset of 186 isolates that were eligible in accordance with
the intended use of this agar medium (i.e., E. coli and KES isolates). One isolate was
excluded because it was unavailable for testing. Six isolates were excluded from the raw
stool analysis due to the lack of or poor growth on HardyCHROM CRE agar (post-seeding
into raw stool). Two additional isolates (8 total) were excluded from the C&S Cary Blair
stool analysis due to the lack of or poor growth on HardyCHROM CRE agar (post-seeding
into C&S Cary Blair stool). In total, 180 isolates (184 results, shown in Table 9.1) were
reported in the raw stool analysis and 179 isolates (182 results, shown in Table 9.2) were
reported in the C&S Cary Blair stool analysis. Results stratified by carbapenemase target are
shown in Table 10).

The performance of NG-Test CARBA 5 with bacteria other than Enterobacteriaceae and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa has not been evaluated.
Organism identification and elevated carbapenem MICs should be determined prior to
testing with NG-Test CARBA 5.
2. Clinical Specificity:
Refer to Section VII C(1) above.
3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Not applicable
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not applicable
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The performance of the NG-Test CARBA 5 was evaluated using a collection of prospectively
collected and archived isolates of carbapenem non-susceptible bacteria. When testing for the
presence of target carbapenemases, the 309 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (240) and P.
aeruginosa (69) tested in the study generated 169 positive results using a composite reference
method (FDA-cleared PCR assay and mCIM method); 176 positive results were generated using
the NG-Test CARBA 5. A summary of the carbapenemase targets detected by the composite
reference method and by the NG-Test CARBA 5 is shown in Table 11.
