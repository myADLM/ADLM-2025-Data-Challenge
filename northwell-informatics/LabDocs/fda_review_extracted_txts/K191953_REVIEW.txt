III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
ETEST is a manual, quantitative technique for determination of antimicrobial susceptibility of
non-fastidious Gram-negative and Gram-ositive aerobic bacteria and fastidious bacteria. The
system comprises a predefined greadient which is used to determine the Minimum Inhibitory
Concentration (MIC, in ug/mL) of different antimicrobial agents against microorganisms tested
on agar media after overnight incubation.
Imipenem/Relebactam has been shown to be active against the Gram-negative aerobic
microorganisms listed below according to the FDA label for this antimicrobial agent.
ETEST IPR can be used to determine the MIC of Imipenem/Relebactam against the following
microorganisms:
Active both in vitro and in clinical infections:
Citrobacter freundii
Enterobacter cloacae
Escherichia coli
Klebsiella aerogenes
Klebsiella oxytoca
Klebsiella pneumoniae
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
The ability of ETEST Imipenem/Relebactam to detect resistant isolates is unknown for
Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae/Enterobacter cloacae complex
and Klebsiella oxytoca because an insufficient number of resistant strains were available at the
time of comparative testing. Isolates yielding Imipenem/Relebactam results suggestive of a
resistant category should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.
Perform an alternative method of testing for isolates of Morganella morganii, Citrobacter koseri,
Serratia marcescens, Providencia rettgeri and Providencia stuartii.

Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
ETEST consists of a thin, inert and non-porous plastic strip 5mm wide and 60 mm long. One
side of the strip carries a two-letter code designating the identity of the antibiotic and is
calibrated with MIC values in terms of µg/mL. On the reverse, a predefined exponential gradient
of the dried and stabilized antibiotic covers a continuous concentration range across 15 two-fold
dilutions of a conventional MIC method.
B Principle of Operation:
The ETEST consists of a thin, inert, nonporous plastic strip that is used to determine the
antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria. One side of the strip carries the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) reading scale expressed in µg/mL. The other side of the strip contains a
predefined continuous gradient of antibiotic concentrations.
When the strip is applied to an inoculated agar surface, the preformed antibiotic gradient
immediately transfers into the agar matrix, then forming a stable, continuous and exponential
gradient of antibiotic concentrations directly underneath the strip. Bacteria growth becomes
visible during incubation, and a symmetrical inhibition ellipse centered along the strip appears.
After incubation, the MIC value is read from the scale in terms of µg/mL at complete inhibition
of bacterial growth, where the pointed end of the ellipse intersects the strip. Since ETEST
generates MIC values which fall between two-fold dilutions for interpretation, the MIC value
read must be recorded to the next two-fold dilution.
The MIC gradient on ETEST Imipenem/Relebactam ranges from 0.002/4 to 32/4 µg/mL. The
relebactam concentration is fixed at 4 µg/mL in this combination.

CLSI M100-28th ed., Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (January
2018).
VI Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was performed at three external sites using ten isolates of Gram-
negative organisms that were consistent with the intended use. The isolates tested included:
E. cloacae (1 isolate), E. coli (2 isolates), K. oxytoca (1 isolate), K. pneumoniae (2 isolates)
and P. aeruginosa (4 isolates). The mode MIC value was determined and the reproducibility
was calculated based on MIC values falling within ± one doubling dilution of the mode MIC
value.
The majority of data points were on-scale and within ± one doubling dilution of the mode
MIC value. One isolate provided off-scale results. The data was analyzed taking into
consideration best case and worst case scenarios as described in the Class II Special Controls
Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems.
The reproducibility was acceptable at 100% for best case results and 99.6% for worst case
results.

--- Page 6 ---
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Inoculum Density Check: Inoculum density checks were performed on quality control
strains, strains used for reproducibility testing and for at least 10% of the clinical isolates.
The inoculum density testing verified the appropriate organism concentrations.
Purity Check: All clinical, challenge and reproducibility test suspensions were subcultured
to assure purity.
Growth or Device Failure: There were no device failures in the ETEST
Imipenem/Relebactam clinical trial. All clinical and challenge isolates grew in the ETEST
Imipenem/Relabactam test system.
Quality Control Testing. The QC strain recommended by the CLSI for testing the
combination of imipenem/relebactam (K. pneumoniae ATCC BAA 1705) was tested at four
sites for a minimum of 20 times at each site by both the ETEST and the reference method.
The results demonstrate that the imipenem/relebactam ETEST can produce quality control
results for K. pneumoniae ATCC BAA 1705 in the recommended range >95% of the time
(Table 1).
In addition to testing K. pneumoniae ATCC BAA 1705, the following additional “auxiliary”
quality control strains were tested at four sites for a minimum of 20 times at each site by both
the ETEST and the reference method: E. coli ATCC 25922, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603,
P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and E. coli ATCC 35218. Even though these auxiliary QC
strains generally are not relevant for verification of the activity of the relebactam component
of imipenem/relebactam combination, they do provide verification of the activity of the
imipenem component of the drug (Table 2).
QC Strain Integrity Check: Additional QC testing was performed to confirm the integrity
of the quality control strains K. pneumoniae ATCC 1705, E. coli ATCC 35318 and K.
pneumoniae ATCC 700603 as recommended by the CLSI. All results were acceptable.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Results obtained with ETEST Imipenem/Relebactam were compared to results obtained with
the CLSI broth microdilution reference panel. The CLSI panel was prepared and interpreted
according to CLSI recommendations outlined in the CLSI Standard: CLSI Document M07-
A10. The testing conditions for the reference method consisted of the following:
• Medium – Cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton Broth with appropriate dilutions of
antimicrobial solution added
• Inoculum – Direct colony suspension to achieve a suspension equivalent to a 0.5
McFarland standard suspension
• Incubation 35 °C in ambient air; 16-20 hours for all organisms
Plate inoculation was performed using an optional inoculator and strip applicator. To address
the use of the optional inoculator and strip applicator the sponsor included the following
footnote to the Performance Characteristics Table:
The optional inoculator and ETEST strip applicator were used for plate inoculation and
applying ETEST strips onto agar media. In the studies, swabs and the Inoculator RETRO
C80 were used for plate inoculation/streaking and forceps and the Vacuum Pen NEMA
C88 were used for ETEST® strip application.
Clinical testing was performed at four sites with both ETEST Imipenem/Relebactam and the
reference method using a total of 420 Enterobacteriaceae isolates including the following
indicated for use species: C. freundii (30 isolates), E. cloacae (20 isolates), E. cloacae
complex (70 isolates), E. coli (152 isolates), K. aerogenes (30 isolates), K. oxytoca (30
isolates) and K. pneumoniae (88 isolates). Of these 241 were fresh isolates (57.4%), 72 were
recent isolates (17.1%), and 107 were stock isolates (25.5%). The percentage of fresh/recent
isolates considered to be “contemporary” is unknown.
A total of 154 isolates of P. aeruginosa were tested with ETEST Imipenem/Relebactam and
the reference method using 93 fresh isolates (60.4%), 21 recent isolates (13.6%) and 40 stock
isolates (26.0%). The percentage of fresh/recent isolates considered to be “contemporary” is
unknown.
A total of 78 challenge isolates were tested at a single site using ETEST
Imipenem/Relebactam and the reference method including the following indicated for use
species: E. cloacae (13 isolates), E. coli (13 isolates), K. oxytoca (2 isolates), K. pneumoniae
(29 isolates) and P. aeruginosa (21 isolates).
Results of comparative testing with clinical and challenge isolates combined demonstrated an
EA of 95.8% and CA of 98.1% for Enterobacteriaceae which was considered acceptable
(Table 3). One very major discrepancy was observed among 44 Enterobacteriaceae resistant
isolates and was considered a random error. The sponsor provided the following footnote to
the performance table to address the very major error:
K191953 - Page 8 of 12

--- Page 9 ---
The percentage of very major errors of 2.3% (1/44 resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates)
was only due to one Very Major Error with an E. coli isolate. Repeat testing of both
ETEST Imipenem/Relebactam and the reference method with this isolate showed
acceptable category agreement between the two tests.
For P. aeruginosa, results of comparative testing with clinical and challenge isolates
demonstrated EA and CA of 96.0% which was considered acceptable (Table 3). There were
no major or very major discrepancies with P. aeruginosa.

Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when the result of the reference method and that of ETEST
Imipenem/Relebactam are within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results
are those that are on scale for both ETEST Imipenem/Relebactam and the reference method. Category
Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the
interpretation of ETEST Imipenem/Relebactam.
An insufficient number of resistant strains were evaluated for the following species: C.
freundii, E. cloacae and E. cloacae complex, K. aerogenes and K. oxytoca. The sponsor
included the following limitation in the device labeling:
The ability of ETEST Imipenem/Relebactam to detect resistant isolates is unknown for
Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae/Enterobacter cloacae
complex and Klebsiella oxytoca because an insufficient number of resistant strains were
available at the time of comparative testing. Isolates yielding Imipenem/Relebactam
results suggestive of a resistant category should be submitted to a reference laboratory
for further testing.
The FDA approved drug label for imipenem/relebactam indicates that the drug is active in
vitro against isolates of C. koseri. During the clinical study, 30 clinical isolates of C. koseri
were tested with ETEST Imipenem/Relebactam, however, the EA obtained for this species

was not acceptable (86.7%). In addition, other members of the Enterobacteriaceae not listed
as indicated species in the FDA approved drug label (Morganella morganii, Citrobacter
koseri, Serratia marcescens, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii) were tested and
showed unacceptable category agreement as compared to the reference method. The sponsor
included the following limitation in the device labeling to address testing of these species:
Perform an alternative method of testing for isolates of Morganella morganii,
Citrobacter koseri, Serratia marcescens, Providencia rettgeri and Providencia stuartii.
To address testing and reporting of MIC results for non-indicated species the sponsor
included the following statement in the Precautions section of the device labeling:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and
efficacy of antimicrobial drugs for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this AST
device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical
trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those found in the
indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of susceptibility
information in those instances is unknown. The approved labelling for specific
antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is approved.
MIC Trending Analysis
Using the combined clinical and challenge data an analysis of trending was conducted for
both Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. This trending calculation considers MIC values
that are determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or higher compared to the
reference method irrespective of whether the device MIC values are on-scale or not. Results
that are not clearly at least one dilution lower, at least one dilution higher or in exact
agreement with the CLSI reference method are not considered in the trending analysis.
Trending results for indicated species and overall trending for indicated Enterobacteriaceae
are shown in Table 4; results are stratified by species to determine if species-related trends
were observed. Species for which the difference between the percentage of isolates with
higher vs. lower readings was ≥ 30% and for which the confidence interval was determined
to be statistically significant were considered to show evidence of trending. Trending that
provides higher or lower MIC values compared to the reference is addressed in labeling.
A trend toward higher MIC reading was observed for Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa
with ETEST Imipenem/Relebactam (Table 4). To address the observed trending, the sponsor
included the following footnote to the performance table in the device labeling:
ETEST Imipenem/Relebactam MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or at least one
doubling dilution higher when testing Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa compared
to the reference broth microdilution method.

VII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
VIII Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e. breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-resources/antibacterial-susceptibility-test-interpretive-
criteria. The protocol outline the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate ETEST Imipenem/Relebactam (IPR) (0.002/4 – 32/4) when revised
breakpoints for imipenem/relebactam are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint
change protocol included with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are met,
bioMérieux will update the imipenem/relebactam device label to include (1) the new breakpoint,
(2) an updated performance section after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with
the new breakpoints, and (3) any new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
