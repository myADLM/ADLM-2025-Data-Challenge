clinical and laboratory findings. As BAL specimens may contain colonizing microorganisms,
detection of Unyvero LRT BAL microbial targets does not indicate that the microorganism is
the cause of the disease. Unyvero positive results do not rule out co-infection with other
microorganisms. Negative results do not preclude lower respiratory infection, as the
causative agent may be a microorganism not detected by this test.
A negative result for any antibiotic resistance marker does not indicate that detected
microorganisms are susceptible to applicable antimicrobial agents. Detected antibiotic

D Special Instrument Requirements:
Unyvero System, including the Unyvero Lysator, Analyzer and Cockpit
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Unyvero LRT BAL Application integrates DNA purification and eight parallel multiplex
endpoint PCR reactions, each followed by array hybridization with all reactions performed
simultaneously in a single use cartridge. The assay is performed with bronchial alveolar
lavage (BAL or mini-BAL) specimens and provides qualitative detection of nucleic acids
from 20 lower respiratory pathogens and 10 antibiotic resistance markers. Multiplex reagent
compositions are designed to limit the occurrence of certain analytes within the same
multiplex assay and to reduce the potential for competitive inhibition. Individual analyte
assays of the Unyvero LRT Array oligonucleotides are designed for similar hybridization and
melting temperatures (approx. 65 - 80°C, varying by amplicon). Hybridization and melting
temperatures are used to exclude non-specific hybridization signals for improved signal
specificity.
The Unyvero instrumentation consists of one (or more) Unyvero Lysators, one (or more)
Unyvero Analyzers, a Unyvero Cockpit. Four single-use consumables are required for
testing: the Unyvero LRT BAL Cartridge, the Unyvero Sample Tube, Sample Tube Cap and
the Unyvero Master Mix. A Unyvero Sample Tube Holder is also supplied for use in the
specimen inoculation step. The four assay consumables consist of the following:
• Unyvero LRT BAL Cartridge contains DNA isolation and purification reagents,
primers, hybridization and wash buffers, and oligonucleotides for detection.
• Unyvero T1 Sample Tube, contains glass beads and buffers to lyse microorganisms
and liquefy the specimen.
K191967 - Page 4 of 88

--- Page 5 ---
• Unyvero T1 Sample Tube Cap seals the Unyvero Sample Tube and contains
Proteinase K and a synthetic control gene for process monitoring.
• Unyvero M1 Master Mix Tube contains reagents for DNA amplification.
Controls
An internal control (a synthetic gene with no known homology to assay target sequences) is
processed in each of the eight PCR chambers. Results are used to verify adequate DNA
purification, amplification, array hybridization, and detection.
Other than the built-in controls, external control materials are not supplied with Unyvero
LRT BAL Application devices and consumables. The assay labeling recommends running
external positive and negative controls regularly. Suggested positive controls included
characterized specimens inoculated with well-characterized microorganisms.
Reagents
No additional reagents are required to perform the Unyvero LRT BAL Application; all reagents
are supplied within the cartridge or within the other consumables with the exception of the
polymerase Master Mix, which is provided separately (frozen).
B Principle of Operation:
The Unyvero LRT BAL Application uses a multiplex PCR approach followed by array
hybridization. The Unyvero LRT Application is a qualitative PCR-based assay that detects
DNA sequences of microorganisms and associated resistance markers in BAL specimens.
The assay includes specimen processing (lysis), DNA extraction and isolation, multiplex
PCR with eight parallel multiplex endpoint PCR reactions, and qualitative detection of
amplified DNA products using hybridization arrays.
A BAL specimen is first pipetted into the Unyvero Sample Tube and closed with the
Unyvero Sample Tube Cap. Closing the sample tube automatically adds the lysis reagent and
the internal control gene template to the specimen. The sample tube which fits into the
Unyvero Lysator only if closed with the Unyvero sample tube cap is then placed on the
Lysator. After the specimen is lysed in the Lysator, the Sample Tube and Master Mix are
loaded into the Unyvero LRT Cartridge which is then inserted into the position assigned by
the Unyvero Analyzer for automated processing and analysis.
In the Unyvero LRT Cartridge, the remaining testing steps are automated by the Unyvero
Analyzer. The lysed specimen is further processed and then transferred onto a DNA
purification column for nucleic acid extraction and elution of genomic DNA. Eluted DNA is
transferred to a chamber, where mixing with the Master Mix takes place. This mixture is
distributed into eight separate PCR reaction chambers each containing multiple primer pairs.
After amplification, PCR products are hybridized to the corresponding array probes. Multiple
spots per array allow for redundant detection with at least four spots per analyte, as well as
K191967 - Page 5 of 88

--- Page 6 ---
spots for intensity calibration, and orientation markers for the imaging software. Binding of
amplicons to specific probes is detected by analyzing fluorescence images of each separate
array. Result data are transferred to the Unyvero Cockpit for visualization and result printout.
A test run is completed after approximately 4.5 hours, and results for panel microorganisms
and associated antibiotic resistance markers are displayed on the Unyvero Cockpit screen.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
Sample matrix: Unless otherwise specified, analytical study samples were prepared using a
simulated matrix (ARM, Artificial Respiratory Matrix) which was adapted from a
composition published by Dinesh et al. ARM was diluted to an appropriate consistency as a
surrogate for BAL matrix (25% (v/v) ARM, 60% (v/v) PBS and 15% (v/v) glycerol). The
final 0.25x ARM also includes 5 mg/mL mucin type II from pig stomach and 1 mg/mL fish
sperm DNA.
1. Reproducibility:
Assay reproducibility was established with contrived samples that were prepared using

matrix). Representative target organisms evaluated included Gram-positive, Gram-negative
and atypical microorganisms. The following LRT BAL Application analytes were included
in the study: Acinetobacter spp., C. pneumoniae, C. freundii, H. influenzae, K. pneumoniae
(carrying LRT BAL antibiotic resistance markers ctx-M, ndm, and tem), M. morganii,
Proteus spp. and, S. aureus (carrying LRT BAL antibiotic resistance marker mecA).
Reproducibility testing included samples prepared with moderate microorganism
concentrations (2.5x - 10x LoD), samples prepared at low concentrations (1x - 4x LoD), and
negative samples (surrogate matrix only (0.25 ARM)). Three different Unyvero systems
were used in the study with each system consisting of one Unyvero Cockpit, three Unyvero
Lysators, up to six Unyvero Analyzers, Testing was performed by three operators.
Each operator performed 3 replicates each of moderate, low and negative samples per test
shift using one Unyvero system (maximum: 18 replicates per test day). Each operator
performed a minimum of 30 replicates per concentration level (90 total replicates per
Unyvero system, 270 replicates in total for all three Unyvero systems with 90 replicates of
each concentration level). Testing was performed over a minimum of five test days. Failed
runs as well as runs with single invalid analyte results were repeated to achieve a minimum
number of at least 30 valid results for each of the target analytes and test concentration.
The study demonstrated acceptable test reproducibility by the LRT BAL Application for all
analytes and concentrations evaluated. Three cartridge runs performed on different test days
and with different operators/test systems generated unexpected positive results with weak
signals close to assay thresholds (2x E. coli, for one ‘moderate’ and one ‘low’ test sample,
1x oxa-23, for one ‘moderate’ test sample).

target evaluated in the study.

a Proteus spp. demonstrated a slightly lower than expected positivity rate for the 2x LoD concentration with a positivity rate (for
all operators combined) of 83.5% with a 95% CI of 74.6% - 89.7%. However, for an alternative test series performed in parallel
for the sample stability study using the same strain and the identical cartridge lot with pooled negative BAL matrix the expected
positivity rate at a 2x LoD concentration for Proteus spp. was confirmed (positivity rate: 92/93, 98.9%).

Assay inclusivity was established near LoD (< 5x LoD) for all but one of the tested
reference strains. For one strain of M. pneumoniae (ATCC 15531) that was evaluated using
genomic DNA extract, inclusivity was demonstrated only at 5x LoD, although in silico
analysis demonstrated no primer or probe mismatches to the corresponding LRT BAL assay
targets. Results from the study are presented in Table 4.

c Quantified DNA extract (reference material) from a commercial provider.
d For M. pneumoniae ATCC 15531, a positivity rate of 2/2 was obtained at a 5x LoD concentration. Sequencing did not
reveal any mismatches to primer and probe binding sites and the observed slightly reduced sensitivity is likely due to the
different source material (DNA extract instead of a cell suspension).
e S. maltophilia strain DSM-21874 was positive at a 4x LoD concentration. Sequencing did not reveal any mismatches to
primer or probe sequences.
f Initial testing S. pneumoniae LoD reference strain ATCC 46916 generated inconsistent detection at 2x LoD. Repeat testing
using a freshly prepared counted culture stock generated 8/8 correct results at a 2x LoD concentration.
g S. pneumoniae strain ATCC 49150 was positive at 4x LoD. Sequencing did not reveal any mismatches to primer or probe
sequences.
h S. pneumoniae strain ATCC 33400 was consistently positive at 4x LoD. Sequencing did not reveal any mismatches to
primer or probe sequences.
To supplement inclusivity testing, in silico GenBank BLAST analyses of LRT BAL primer
and probe sequences were performed for each LRT BAL microorganism (search performed
July 2019) for all applicable strain entries. BLAST analyses identified strain entries for
which detection by LRT BAL is predicted at LoD (match of relevant primer and probe
sequences), strains predicted to be detected with reduced sensitivity (typically, single
relevant mismatches of primer or probe sequences; strains for which detection is likely at
higher than LoD concentrations only), or strains for which detection is not predicted
(multiple relevant mismatches in primer and probe sequences).
Table 5 lists microorganisms for which inclusivity was demonstrated by wet testing and are
supported by in silico analysis (predicted at LoD or predicted with reduced sensitivity). Also
presented are in silico predictions for strains/species for which in silico analysis that were
not evaluated by wet-testing. These in silico results are provided to the user as
supplementary data only. Results are not intended to be a surrogate for wet testing and do
not assure that specific strains will be detected.

Similar to microorganism testing, inclusivity wet testing was performed with reference
strains carrying antibiotic resistance markers targeted by the LRT BAL Application.
Contrived samples were prepared in pooled negative clinical BAL matrix with organism
concentrations near the LoD for each resistance marker target.
Inclusivity of the LRT BAL Application for detection of targeted resistance markers was
demonstrated for all strains evaluated in the study. Results are presented in Table 6 below
with resistance marker variants/subgroups designated, if known. If available, results from
phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) results are also presented (e.g.,
CarbapenemR = resistant to carbapenems, CarbapenemS = susceptible to carbapenems).

*N/A = variant status unknown
To supplement inclusivity testing specifically for antibiotic resistance marker variants,
reference sequences for all available variants belonging to individual antibiotic resistance
markers or marker subgroups were evaluated using in silico analysis.
Table 7 below includes a summary of subgroups or variants for applicable LRT BAL
antibiotic resistance markers for which detection is predicted at LoD (match of relevant
primer and probe sequences), detection is predicted with reduced sensitivity (typically,
single relevant mismatches of primer or probe sequences; detection likely at higher than
LoD concentrations only), or detection is not predicted (multiple relevant mismatches in
primer and probe sequences). In silico data are provide in the test labeling as supplementary

4. Analytical Specificity/Cross-reactivity:
An analytical specificity study was conducted to evaluate LRT BAL Application targets for
potential cross-reactivity with common respiratory flora microorganisms and species closely
related to LRT BAL analytes. Testing was performed in duplicate using samples prepared at
a worst case concentration (typically: 1.5 x 107 CFU/mL for bacteria and 1.0 x 107
copies/mL for viruses) by spiking microorganisms into 0.25x ARM (artificial respiratory
matrix). Study results are presented in Table 8.
Cross-reactivity was observed with the following microorganisms with the Haemophilus
influenzae assay of the LRT BAL Application:
• Haemophilus haemolyticus (ATCC 33390) – at LoD
• Aggregatibacter aphrophilus (ATCC 19415) - at 10x LoD
• Haemophilus parainfluenzae (ATCC 33392) - at > 100x LoD (> 107 CFU/mL).

a For A. aphrophilus, cross-reactivity to H. influenzae was observed down to a concentration of 2.0
x 105 CFU/mL (1/2 tests positive). For a concentration of 1.0 x 105 CFU/mL (equivalent to 5x
LoD of H. influenzae), cross-reactivity was no longer observed. According to BLAST analysis,
cross-reactivity of A. aphrophilus to H. influenzae is only predicted for some strains (including the
tested reference strain ATCC 19415), but not for other strains.
b For H. haemolyticus, cross-reactivity to H. influenzae was observed down to a concentration of
4.0 x 104 CFU/mL (2/2 tests positive, equivalent to 2x LoD of H. influenzae). Sequence
comparison by BLAST for H. haemolyticus to H. influenzae shows a 3’ mismatch to one of the
assay primers, while the second primer and all internal array probes show a full match. Therefore,
the observed cross-reactivity is supported by BLAST analysis.
c For H. parainfluenzae, cross-reactivity to H. influenzae was observed only at the tested worst-
case concentration of 1.5 x 107 CFU/mL (2/4 tests positive, equivalent to 750x LoD of H.
influenzae). Additional tests at 2.0 x 106 CFU/mL (equivalent to 100x LoD of H. influenzae),
cross-reactivity was no longer observed.
d Tested as DNA extract (in copies/mL).
e Tested as DNA or RNA extract (in copies/mL).
Additionally, in silico analysis (GenBank BLAST) was performed to assess for potential
cross-reactivity of non-target microorganisms that may be present in BAL specimens.
Table 9 includes predicted cross-reactivity of applicable LRT BAL microorganisms based
on in silico analysis, exclusivity wet testing and false positive results observed during the
prospective and archived studies.

A sample stability study was conducted to evaluated assay performance differences between
fresh samples and samples stored at 2-8°C for at least 24 hours. Samples for the study were
prepared at low and moderate organism concentrations inoculated into pooled natural
negative BAL matrix. Representative targeted microorganisms were evaluated in the study.
Four targeted resistance markers carried by selected strains were also evaluated.
Pair-wise tests with the LRT BAL Application were performed for samples tested within 2
hours after test sample preparation (Time 0) and samples tested after a total storage of at
least 24 hours including at least 2 hours at a worst-case ambient temperature of 30°C and a
minimum of 22 hour storage at 2-8°C.
Tables 10 to 12 summarize the sample stability test results for each concentration level
(moderate, low, negative) for both test conditions (tested freshly, tested after storage),
together with the agreement rates based on comparison to expected results.
Results of the study support the claimed specimen storage and transport conditions of 2-8°C
for up to 24 hours prior to testing with the LRT BAL Application.

Sample Stability/Post-lysis
Package insert instructions indicate the user to load the Unyvero LRT BAL Cartridge
immediately after lysis on the Unyvero Lysator or if needed, within one hour post-lysis.
An analytical study was conducted to assess any differences in performance between
immediate testing and after a one hour delay. Study samples were prepared with
representative analytes close to their respective LoD concentrations. Results were
compared for samples tested immediately after lysis and samples tested after a 1 hour or
4 hours delay between lysis completion and Analyzer start. A total of six replicates were
evaluated per analyte and storage condition. The study demonstrated equivalent results
for all test conditions.
External Controls
Quantified stored frozen microorganism stocks comprising LoD reference strains for all
LRT BAL analytes were used for preparation of positive controls that were regularly
tested throughout clinical and analytical studies. A minimum of one strain for each
microorganism target was included in the positive control scheme. All targeted
resistance marker targets were also represented. Positive controls were prepared as six
different microorganism pools with each analyte present at ~3X LoD.
In the clinical study, testing was performed in duplicate prior to the study, for every new
cartridge lot and bi-weekly throughout the study. Negative controls consisted of pooled
native negative BAL specimen matrix and were tested once per week throughout the
clinical study. Of the 192 expected positive results from control testing conducted in the
prospective clinical study, positive controls generated the expected positive results with
the exception of two false negative S. pneumoniae results (out of 12 control run), one
false positive E. coli result and one invalid control run. All negative controls generated
the expected negative result for all analytes.

The limit of detection (LoD) for the Unyvero LRT BAL Application was established for
each analyte targeted by the assay. The LoD was estimated by serial dilutions of reference
strains prepared in pooled negative native BAL matrix. The LoD for each analyte was
determined to be the lowest test concentration with a positivity rate of 95% or higher with at
least 19 of 20 positive test results. Tables 13 and 14 summarize the LoD for each LRT BAL
panel microorganism and antibiotic resistance marker target.

microorganism, LoD was determined with a tem positive E. coli strain. Note that inclusivity testing was also
successfully performed with tem positive H. influenzae strains prepared as low positive samples.
8. Fresh versus Frozen Study:
To support the use of frozen specimens tested in clinical studies, an analytical study was
conducted to assess any performance differences between fresh and frozen specimens when
tested with the LRT BAL Application. Study samples were prepared with representative
microorganisms inoculated into pooled native negative BAL specimen matrix. Testing was
performed with both moderate positive (target analyte at 2.5x - 10x LoD, minimum 10
samples per storage condition) and low positive (per target analyte at 1x – 4x LoD,
minimum of 30 samples storage condition) samples. Ten negative sample replicates were
also evaluated.
Paired tests with the LRT BAL Application was performed for samples tested within 2
hours after test sample preparation (Time 0) and samples tested after freezing below -70 °C
for at least one day and thawing immediately before testing.
Tables 15-17 summarize the fresh versus frozen study results for each concentration level
storage conditions (e.g., fresh, frozen). Results of the study demonstrated equivalent
performance for fresh and frozen BAL specimens.

camera system over a defined temperature range. After correction for background values, a
signal threshold is applied for probes of individual analytes. In addition to the signal
thresholds, individual cutoffs are defined to reduce background signals for certain analytes
that can be present in host flora of healthy individuals. Higher assay cutoffs were chosen for
some analytes to exclude some non-specific low cross-reactivity background.

11. Carry-Over/Cross-contamination:
Please refer to the de novo Premarket Notification, DEN170047, for Carryover/cross-
contamination study results performed with the Unyvero LRT Application (for tracheal
aspirate specimens) and the Unyvero System.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Not Applicable
2. Matrix Comparison:
Artificial Respiratory Medium (ARM) was used as a matrix for preparation of samples for
several analytical studies. A matrix equivalency study was performed to compare assay
performance for samples prepared in ARM and samples prepared in pooled natural BAL
matrix. BAL test samples were prepared by pooling BAL specimens that were determined to
be negative for all LRT BAL Application analytes. Both ARM and natural BAL matrices
were inoculated with representative microorganisms at various concentrations near the LoD
(moderate positive: 5x LoD, low positive: 2x LoD and high negative: 0.1x LoD). Matrix
equivalence was evaluated based on qualitative (percent positivity) and quantitative results
(comparison of mean assay signal). The study results generated comparable positivity rates
and assay signals between matrices for all target analytes evaluated, thereby supporting the
use of ARM for preparation of analytical study samples.
C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Study, Prospectively Collected Specimens:
Clinical performance of the LRT BAL Application was established using 1,051 BAL and
mini-BAL specimens that were prospectively collected for a previous clinical study in June
2015-July 2016. These specimens were collected at nine US clinical sites from hospitalized
patients 18 years or older and suspected of lower respiratory infections. All specimens were
stored frozen within 24 hours after arrival of the specimen in the lab and remained frozen
prior to inclusion in the LRT BAL Application clinical study. A total of 35 specimens
(3.3%) of the original prospective cohort were excluded due to insufficient remaining

specimen volume. All other specimens (1,016, 96.7%) were tested with the LRT BAL
Application without any further pre-selection.

prospective study.

Clinical testing was performed using six Unyvero Systems and multiple operators with
frozen BAL specimens thawed and tested with the LRT BAL Application. Runs with fully
valid or partially valid results were eligible for data analysis. Fully invalid and partially
invalid runs were repeated once whenever sufficient specimen volume for retesting was
available. Results for repeat runs were used in the final performance analyses.
Prospective Clinical Study Reference Methods – Microorganism Targets
‘Typical’ microorganism targets: Clinical performance of the LRT BAL Application was
evaluated in comparison to standard-of-care (SoC) culture results which were reported either
qualitatively or quantitatively. For quantitative cultures, a minimum reporting threshold of
103 CFU/mL or higher for mini-BAL specimens and 104 CFU/mL or higher for BAL
specimens was required to characterize a specimen as positive, following recommendations
by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Thoracic Society
(ATS) for quantitative cultures.
In addition, LRT BAL Application results for each ‘typical’ microorganism target were
compared to a composite comparator consisting of SoC culture and one PCR assay (with
positive PCR results followed by bi-directional sequencing). Validated comparator
PCR/sequencing assays were confirmed to have analytical sensitivities in a similar range to
the LRT BAL Application and to target different genetic loci from the LRT BAL
Application. Using the composite comparator algorithm, a specimen was characterized as
positive for a specific analyte if either culture or PCR/sequencing were positive. Likewise,
specimens that were negative by both SoC culture and PCR/sequencing were characterized
as negative for the applicable analyte.
‘Atypical’ microorganism targets: For each targeted atypical microorganism (Chlamydia
pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila and Pneumocystis

jirovecii), a composite comparator consisting of two different PCR assays (each followed by
bi-directional sequencing if PCR-positive) was performed for each BAL specimen. For each
analyte, comparator PCR/sequencing assays targeted different genetic loci from each other
as well as from LRT BAL Application target sequences. Validated comparator assays were
confirmed to have analytical sensitivities similar to the LRT BAL Application for each
applicable analyte. For the composite comparator, any specimen that was positive by either
PCR and confirmed with bi-directional sequencing was characterized as positive for the
respective microorganism target. Likewise, a specimen was characterized as negative if both
respective PCR comparator assays were negative for the analyte.
For atypical analytes, assay performance was also evaluated based on a comparison to SoC
testing for a subset of specimens that were tested based on clinician request. This SoC
testing consisted of several methods (i.e., IFA, DFA, PCR).
Prospective Study, Clinical Performance for ‘Typical’ Analytes
Results from the prospective study cohort using SoC culture results as the reference method
are shown in Table 19 below. Additional evaluation of performance stratified by qualitative
and quantitative culture results is presented in Table 20 below.

extract sequencing. Results for K. pneumoniae and K. variicola performance are calculated based on the species identified by
sequencing.
c Note that many of the FP detections are confirmed when comparing against the composite comparator that includes molecular
reference assays (see Table 21).
d Specimens with false positive LRT BAL results were analyzed with molecular assays (PCR/bi-directional sequencing) using
specimen DNA extracts for presence or absence of the corresponding microorganism: presence was confirmed in 11 of 11 cases
for Acinetobacter spp., 3 of 3 cases for C. freundii, 7 of 7 cases for E. cloacae complex, 18 of 30 cases for E. coli, 42 of 48
cases for H. influenzae, 7 of 8 cases for K. oxytoca, 5 of 10 cases for K. pneumoniae, 2 of 2 cases for K. variicola, 13 of 13 cases
for M. catarrhalis, 3 of 3 cases for M. morganii, 6 of 6 cases for Proteus spp., 41 of 43 cases for P. aeruginosa, 4 of 5 cases for
S. marcescens, 31 of 41 cases for S. aureus, 21 of 22 cases for S. maltophilia, and 10 of 10 cases for S. pneumoniae. For cases
that were not confirmed for H. influenzae, sequencing results identified H. haemolyticus (3x), H. parainfluenzae (1x) and
Aggregatibacter aphrophilus (1x). For all other cases, PCRs did not amplify sufficient amounts for sequencing.
e Two of the four specimens that were FN for E. cloacae complex contained multiple host microorganisms identified by culture,
and/or LRT BAL. For one specimen, Acinetobacter spp. was additionally reported by both LRT BAL and culture. For the other
specimen, S. maltophilia was additionally reported by LRT BAL only.
f Two of the four specimens that were FN for K. pneumoniae contained multiple host microorganisms identified by culture
and/or the molecular reference testing. For one FN specimen, P. aeruginosa was additionally reported by both LRT BAL and
culture. For the other specimen, E. cloacae complex was additionally reported by both LRT BAL and culture and S. maltophilia
was additionally reported by LRT BAL only.
Because of the observed lower than expected PPA/sensitivity compared to SoC culture for
specimens containing S. aureus, the following limitation is included in the package insert
notifying the user how to interpret negative results by the LRT BAL Application.
• In clinical testing, S. aureus was not reported by the LRT BAL Application for 8/71
prospective specimens that were positive for S. aureus by SoC culture. Six of the
eight false negative specimens only contained low microorganism loads (i.e., rare,
104 CFU/mL or lower). As the assay LoD for S. aureus is 1.5x105 CFU/mL, and
bacterial concentrations of ≥ 104 CFU/mL are generally considered significant,
negative results for S. aureus by the LRT BAL Application must be interpreted in
conjunction with results from SoC culture.
Due to the high risk associated with lower respiratory infections involving S. aureus/MRSA,
additional testing results for specimens with false negative results for S. aureus are listed in
Table 20 below and also included in the package insert.

For other ‘typical’ analytes with lower than expected PPA/sensitivity compared to SoC
culture (E. cloacae complex, K. pneumoniae, K. variicola), separate limitations are included
in the package insert notifying the user the need to interpret negative results by the LRT
BAL Application in conjunction with results from SoC culture. The following limitations
are included in the package insert.
• In clinical testing, E. cloacae complex was not reported by the LRT BAL Application
for 4/17 prospective and 4/19 archived specimens that were positive for E. cloacae
complex by SoC culture. Five of the eight false negative specimens only contained
low microorganism loads (i.e., rare, 104 CFU/mL or lower). As the assay LoD for E.
cloacae complex is 2x105 CFU/mL, and bacterial concentrations of ≥ 104 CFU/mL
are generally considered significant, negative results for E. cloacae complex by the
LRT BAL Application must be interpreted in conjunction with results from SoC
culture.
• In clinical testing, K. pneumoniae was not reported by the LRT BAL Application for
4/24 prospective specimens that were positive for K. pneumoniae by SoC culture. Two
of the four false negative specimens only contained low microorganism loads (i.e.,
rare, 104 CFU/mL or lower). As the assay LoD for K. pneumoniae is 4x104 CFU/mL,
and bacterial concentrations of ≥ 104 CFU/mL are generally considered significant,
negative results for K. pneumoniae by the Unyvero LRT Application must be
interpreted in conjunction with SoC culture.
• Due to the observed low prevalence and low sensitivity/positive percent agreement of
the LRT BAL Application for detection of K. variicola in the prospective clinical
study, negative results must be interpreted in conjunction with results from SoC
culture.

For each ‘typical’ analyte, LRT BAL results from the prospective clinical study were also
compared to a composite comparator reference consisting of SoC culture results combined
with a validated molecular test (PCR/sequencing). Specimens were considered positive by
the composite comparator for a targeted analyte if either culture or PCR/sequencing
generated positive results. Likewise, specimens were considered negative if both culture and
PCR/sequencing were negative. Performance is presented in Table 21.

a Specimens with observed invalid LRT BAL analyte results were positive by the composite comparator: Acinetobacter spp. (1),
C. freundii (1), E. cloacae complex (1), H. influenzae (1), M. catarrhalis (4), M. morganii (4), P. aeruginosa (1), S. marcescens
(1) and S. maltophilia (1). For one SoC negative specimen, b K. pneumoniae and K. variicola were simultaneously reported by
the molecular test of the composite comparator, but were negative by SoC culture. As it was not feasible to resolve whether
these analytes exceeded the molecular reporting threshold, both were set to ‘invalid’. For this specimen, LRT BAL had reported
a positive result for K. variicola and a negative result for K. pneumoniae.
b K. variicola is typically reported by culture as K. pneumoniae. To discriminate K. variicola from K. pneumoniae, provided K.
pneumoniae strain isolates were sequenced. For a few cases, no isolate was provided and sequencing was performed from
specimen DNA extracts instead. Two of 27 cases were identified as K. variicola and confirmed by both isolate and DNA extract
sequencing. Results for K. pneumoniae and K. variicola performance are calculated based on the species identified by
sequencing.
Clinical Performance, Prospective study, Atypical analytes

PCR assays followed by bidirectional sequencing are shown in Table 22 below.

Performance for LRT BAL ‘atypical’ analytes was also evaluated in comparison to results
from SoC testing for the subset of cases for which a SoC test was performed. SoC testing
included DFA, IFA or PCR. Only one specimen had SoC testing ordered for C.

Application. For the three other ‘atypical’ microorganism targets, the following performance
was observed for the LRT BAL Application when compared to SoC testing. Additional

Due to the lower than expected clinical performance for detection of Pneumocystis jirovecii,
the following limitations are included in the labeling:
• For P. jirovecii, an LoD of 5 x 105 copies/mL was determined. Clinically relevant
levels of P. jirovecii DNA have been reported to be in a range of 104 - 105 copies/mL
or above in patients with PJP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia).
• The LRT BAL Application should be used in conjunction with SoC tests for P.
jirovecii (e.g., fluorescence staining tests or highly sensitive PCR assays). Additional
testing for P. jirovecii is recommended for patients who are suspected of PJP and
have negative P. jirovecii results by the LRT BAL Application.
Prospective study specimens with positive reference culture results were further evaluated
based on culture quantitation. The analysis included evaluation of specimens with semi-
quantitative result reported by qualitative SoC culture (categories: rare, few, moderate,
numerous) or by quantitative SoC culture (categories: 103 - < 104, 104 - < 105, 105 - < 106, >
106, in CFU/mL) as shown in Table 24.

a One specimen with P. aeruginosa and one specimen with S. aureus were reported positive by SoC culture without any
qualitative or quantitative information, and were therefore not included in this table.
For ‘typical’ analytes, Table 25 includes clinical performance of the LRT BAL Application
when compared to positive SoC culture results (any microorganism reported) and negative
SoC results (no growth or normal/mixed flora results).

concordant; the majority of discordant results were due to LRT BAL detection of additional
microorganisms. Table 27 includes a detailed analysis of LRT BAL results compared to
SoC culture with details on multi-detections and discordant results, stratified into the
following categories:

2. Clinical Study, Archived Specimens:
The LRT BAL Application was further evaluated using selected archived frozen BAL
specimens from patients, age 18 or older, suspected of lower respiratory infection, and with
at least one LRT BAL microorganisms reported positive by SoC testing. Specimens were
collected at eleven US clinical sites, and supplemented with other specimens from
additional sites. In contrast to the prospective study, where specimens were only from
hospitalized patients (inpatients), specimens from outpatients or from patients with an
unknown status were also accepted. Specimens were selected based on positivity by SoC
culture (for ‘typical’ analytes) or positivity by other SoC methods (for atypical analytes)
such as IFA, DFA, or molecular assays. For analytes with positive SoC results, confirmatory
testing (PCR/bi-directional sequencing using two independent PCR assays per applicable
analyte) was performed to assess for potential specimen degradation during storage.
Specimens were included in the archived study if either one of the PCR/sequencing
confirmatory assays was positive for applicable analyte reported as positive by SoC.
Likewise, specimens were excluded only if both confirmatory PCR assays were negative.
The archived study cohort included 220 selected specimens from a previous study with 23
specimens (10.5%) excluded because of insufficient specimen volume. The remaining 197
specimens (89.5%) were tested with the LRT BAL Application without any further pre-
selection. An additional 195 archived specimens that met inclusion criteria were also
evaluated for a total set of 392 archived study specimens. Table 28 includes patient
demographic information for LRT BAL archived study.

For archived specimens, LRT BAL Application microorganism target results were
compared to ‘confirmed’ results from SoC microbiology culture (for ‘typical’
microorganism) which were reported either qualitatively or quantitatively. For quantitative
cultures, a reporting threshold of 103 CFU/mL or higher for mini-BAL specimens and of 104
CFU/mL or higher for BAL specimens was applied, following recommendations by the
Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS).
Results from the archived study for ‘typical’ microorganism targeted are presented in Table

a K. variicola is typically reported by culture as K. pneumoniae. To discriminate K. variicola from K. pneumoniae,
K. pneumoniae strain isolates, if available, were sequenced. If no isolate was provided, sequencing was performed from
specimen DNA extracts instead. Performance for K. pneumoniae and K. variicola are calculated based on the species identified
by sequencing.
b Specimens with false positive LRT BAL results were analyzed with molecular assays (PCR/bi-directional sequencing) using
specimen DNA extracts for presence or absence of microorganisms. Presence of microorganisms was confirmed in 3 of 3 cases
for Acinetobacter spp., 4 of 5 cases for C. freundii (one confirmed case was reported as C. youngae by SoC), 15 of 17 cases for
E. coli, 17 of 21 cases for H. influenzae, 6 of 6 cases for K. oxytoca, 7 of 10 cases for K. pneumoniae, 2 of 4 cases for
K. variicola, 8 of 9 cases for M. catarrhalis, 6 of 7 cases for Proteus spp., 2 of 2 cases for P. aeruginosa, 1 of 3 cases for
S. marcescens, 18 of 21 cases for S. aureus, 10 of 10 cases for S. maltophilia, and 4 of 5 cases for S. pneumoniae. For cases that
were not confirmed for H. influenzae, sequencing identified H. haemolyticus (2x), A. aphropilus (2x). For all other cases, PCRs
did not amplify sufficient amounts for sequencing.
c Three of the four specimens that were FN for E. cloacae complex contained multiple host microorganisms identified by
culture, and/or LRT BAL. For one specimen, Klebsiella oxytoca was additionally reported by both LRT BAL and culture. For
the two other specimens, Proteus spp. or E. coli, respectively, were additionally reported by LRT BAL only.
For ‘atypical’ microorganism targets, SoC results were available for only a subset of
specimens. For these specimens, comparator testing was not performed for other analytes;
therefore negative percent agreement was not evaluated. Results for positive percent
agreement are shown in Table 30.

for M. pneumoniae, and 10 of 13 cases for P. jirovecii. For all other cases, PCRs did not amplify sufficient amounts for
sequencing.

3. Clinical Study, Contrived Specimens
For low prevalence LRT BAL analytes, the prospective and archived clinical studies were
supplemented with contrived specimens which were prepared by spiking pooled
microorganisms at concentrations close to their respective analyte LoD or at clinically
relevant concentrations into unique negative BAL specimens. The following LRT BAL
microorganism targets were evaluated using contrived specimens: C. pneumoniae, C.
freundii, E. cloacae complex, K. oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, K. variicola, L. pneumophila,
M. morganii, M. pneumoniae, P. jirovecii, Proteus spp., S. marcescens. In addition, all low
prevalence LRT BAL antibiotic resistance markers (ctx-M, kpc, ndm, oxa-23, oxa-24, oxa-
48, oxa-58, vim) were included in the contrived study (See below for section titled, Clinical
Study, Resistance Markers) . For each target analyte, 60 contrived specimens using up to
five different reference strains were tested at a low concentration (2x LoD, 30 specimens)
and at two moderate concentrations (3.5x LoD and 5x LoD, 15 specimens each) spanning
the clinically relevant concentration range. For P. jirovecii, a positive clinical specimen was
used for spiking, and all 60 contrived specimens were tested at a 2x LoD concentration.

a Morganella morganii strains ATCC 25829 and DSM-46262 strains were retested with pooled negative BAL matrix at 2x LoD
both showing 10/10 results.
b Mycoplasma pneumoniae strains ATCC 29085 and ATCC 49894 were retested with pooled negative BAL matrix at 2x LoD
showing 19/20 or 18/20 positive results, respectively. For three of four unexpected negative cases of ATCC 29085, unique
matrices used for specimen preparation demonstrated reduced signals or false negative results for other (co-spiked) analytes;
therefore, three false negative results for M. pneumoniae may be matrix-related.
4. Clinical Study, Performance for Resistance Marker Targets
The LRT BAL Application was evaluated in the prospective clinical study (N= 1,016
specimens) for reported antibiotic resistance marker targets. For each resistance marker,
LRT BAL results were compared to one PCR assay followed by bi-directional sequencing
with testing performed directly with BAL specimens. Since resistance marker results are
only reported by the LRT BAL Application when at least one applicable target
microorganism is simultaneously detected (i.e., otherwise, detected resistance markers are
masked from reporting). Table 33 includes performance for resistance markers with
masking applied, i.e., includes specimens with applicable microorganism targets reported by
LRT BAL.

a Observed invalid LRT BAL analyte results: ctx-M (1) and oxa-24 (1).
b One false negative result belongs to the ctx-M9 subgroup that is not covered by the ctx-M assay of the LRT BAL Application
(targeted against ctx-M1 subgroup).
c Note that molecular reference assays use cutoffs to achieve analytical sensitivities in a similar range to LRT BAL. Negative
results by molecular reference assays do not preclude the presence of the antibiotic resistance marker in the specimen at a low
concentration, nor its possible clinical relevance.
d Specimens with false positive LRT BAL results were analyzed with additional molecular assays (PCR/bi-directional
sequencing) using specimen DNA extracts for presence or absence of antibiotic resistance markers. Targeted resistance markers
were confirmed in 0 of 1 case for ctx-M, 1 of 1 case of kpc, 10 of 25 cases for mecA, 1 of 1 case for oxa-24, 6 of 7 cases for tem
and 1 of 1 case for vim. Cross-reactivity to other off-panel analytes has not been observed.

e Note that Staphylococci other than S. aureus commonly harbor mecA. Positive mecA results may be due to the presence of
Staphylococcus other than S. aureus.
f Although tem is reported by LRT BAL for H. influenzae only, other Gram-negative microorganisms (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae,
Acinetobacter spp., P. aeruginosa) can harbor tem. Positive tem results may be due to the presence of other Gram-negative
organisms that carry tem.
Several targeted resistance markers (ctx-M, kpc, ndm, oxa-48) are reported for more than
one corresponding host microorganism for the LRT BAL Application. Performance for
these markers is presented in Table 34 stratified by target microoorganism (C. freundii, E.
cloacae complex, E. coli, K. oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, K. variicola, M. morganii, Proteus
spp., S. marcescens, Acinetobacter spp., P. aeruginosa). The comparator used in the
analysis is one PCR/sequencing assay for each resistance marker target. Note that the
performance estimates are not based on definitive linkage information of detected antibiotic
resistance markers to culture isolates or specific microorganisms.

was not provided for all positive SoC cultures, thereby limiting the dataset for comparison
(A). Comparison (B) evaluates the entire specimen cohort, including all positive LRT BAL
results that were negative by SoC culture.
For both comparisons, the following analyses were performed for ctx-M, kpc, ndm, and vim
(for targeted Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter spp. and/or P. aeruginosa as possible host
microorganisms), for oxa-48 (for targeted Enterobacteriaceae), for tem (for H. influenzae),
and for mecA (for S. aureus) in Tables 35-43:
• Agreement of one (or more) detected host microorganisms in combination with an
antibiotic resistance marker (Org+/Res+) between LRT BAL and reference methods
(A) or (B).
• Agreement of one (or more) detected host microorganisms without reported antibiotic
resistance marker (Org+/Res-) between LRT BAL and reference methods (A) or (B).
• Agreement of a negative result for one (or more) host microorganisms (Org-) between
LRT BAL and reference methods (A) and (B).
As presence of mecA is expected to directly correlate with cefoxitin/oxacillin resistance in
S. aureus strains (MRSA, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), while the absence of mecA is
expected to correlate with susceptible S. aureus strains (MSSA, methicillin-sensitive S.
aureus), mecA was furthermore compared to the MRSA/MSSA status of culture isolates as
reported by SoC culture (C) in Table 43. The following evaluations were performed:
• Agreement of a detected S. aureus in combination with a detected mecA as reported
by LRT BAL (Org+/Res+) to S. aureus reported with an MRSA phenotype by SoC
culture (Org+/MRSA).
• Agreement of a detected S. aureus together with a negative result for mecA
(Org+/Res) as reported by LRT BAL to S. aureus reported with an MSSA
phenotype by SoC culture (Org+/MSSA).
• Agreement of a negative result for S. aureus between LRT BAL and SoC culture.
Evaluation of oxa-58 is not provided as positive results were not observed from the LRT
BAL Application, nor by comparator methods.

a 18 cases were determined as Org+/Res- negative by the molecular reference assay using cutoffs set to achieve an analytical
sensitivity in a comparable range to LRT BAL. For 10 of these 18 cases, presence of mecA was confirmed by alternate
molecular tests (PCR/sequencing).
b One strain was reported by the clinical site as MRSA, although this was not supported by the provided oxacillin Kirby-Bauer
zone diameter. Independent cefoxitin AST confirmed the MRSA phenotype for this strain.
Clinical Performance, Resistance Markers, Archived Study
Results observed for LRT BAL resistance marker targets are listed in Table 44 below. Since
resistance marker results are reported by the LRT BAL Application when an applicable
microorganism is simultaneously detected, the results presented include a subset of specimens
tested (i.e., those specimens with an applicable microorganism detected for each resistance
marker target).

Correlation of Detected Antibiotic Resistance Markers to Strain Genotypes and
Phenotypes:
Available isolates collected from SoC cultures for the majority of the prospective and a
portion of archived study BAL specimens were screened for presence or absence of
antibiotic resistance markers targeted by the LRT BAL Application. Furthermore,
corresponding antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) results were collected for SoC
culture isolates for one or more of the antimicrobials listed in Table 45. AST results were
reported as MIC values or zone diameters (for Kirby-Bauer tests). Strain phenotypes across
all test sites were standardized according to breakpoints listed in CLSI guidance M100S
(Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing, 26th Edition).
‘Intermediate’ calls were regarded as ‘resistant’ calls for this study. For the analysis, any
strain was regarded as ‘resistant’ if at least one of the corresponding drugs resulted in an
‘intermediate’ or ‘resistant’ call. Any strain was regarded as ‘susceptible’ if a ‘sensitive’ call
was obtained for all applicable tested drugs.

Antibiotic resistance markers reported by LRT BAL were correlated to available isolates
for:
• Genotypic agreement of reported antibiotic resistance markers to presence of such
markers in cultured isolates for a specific specimen.
• Phenotypic agreement of reported antibiotic resistance markers with associated
phenotypic culture results to provided isolates as determined by antimicrobial
susceptibility tests (AST).
Note that antibiotic resistance marker results are reported by the LRT BAL Application only
if a corresponding host microorganism is simultaneously reported. Otherwise, such results

are masked on the Unyvero results screen. Antibiotic resistance marker results reported
together with a corresponding host microorganism may not be linked to this organism, but
may have originated from other on-panel or off-panel microorganisms, e.g., mecA may not
only originate from S. aureus, but also originate from coagulase-negative Staphylococci
present in respiratory flora; tem may not only originate from H. influenzae, but also from
other on-panel or off-panel gram negative species. If multiple corresponding
microorganisms are simultaneously reported for a certain antibiotic resistance marker, one
or more than one of these microorganisms could be the host of such marker.
For available isolates collected from reference culture in the prospective and archived study,
evaluation of genotypic and phenotypic agreement of LRT BAL results compared to
PCR/sequencing and AST respectively are presented in Tables 46 to 50.

a For one prospective strain, a resistant phenotype to meropenem was reported by the clinical site, although this was not
supported by the provided Kirby-Bauer zone diameter. Independent AST for meropenem and imipenem confirmed resistance to
carbapenems for this strain.
5. Unyvero System Performance: Invalid Results and Instrument Errors
For the prospective, archived and contrived studies, a total of 1,648 clinical BAL specimens
(1,016 prospective, 392 archived, 240 contrived) were processed. Results for all successful
runs (reporting fully valid or partially valid analyte results) were evaluated; however, runs
with partially valid result were repeated once, if sufficient specimen volume was still
available in order to achieve a complete dataset. Results for repeat runs replaced the results
of the predecessor run for data evaluation. Furthermore, all failed runs or runs, for which all
analytes were reported invalid, were repeated whenever possible.

The invalid rate for all clinical studies combined was 3.9% (64 of 1,648 specimens). A total
of eight of 1,648 runs generated invalid results for all analytes (0.5%); seven of the initially
invalid specimens generated valid results upon repeat testing. For one specimen, all analytes
were reported as invalid from the repeat test. A total of 56 of 1,648 runs generated partially
invalid results (3.4%); 55 specimens generated a single failed PCR/hybridization chamber of
the LRT BAL Cartridge. For one specimen, the invalid result was due to multiple chambers
failures. Repeat runs were performed for 48 of invalid runs resulting in valid results for all
repeat test runs.
Another 14 runs failed due to instrument error (0.8%). All 14 runs were successfully
repeated.
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not Applicable
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
In the prospective study cohort of 1,016 evaluable BAL specimens, the LRT BAL Application
reported 363 specimens (35.7%) with at least one positive LRT BAL microorganism target,
including 250 specimens (24.6%) with single detections and 113 specimens (11.1%) with multi-
detections of two or more LRT BAL microorganism targets. Table 51 includes the positivity
rate for each microorganism target observed in the prospective clinical study. Tables 52 and 53
include the positivity rate for antibiotic resistance marker targets as reported as positive by LRT
BAL Application during the prospective study.
