III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indication for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Lumipulse G CA19-9-N is a Chemiluminescent Enzyme Immunoassay (CLEIA) for the
quantitative measurement of CA 19-9 in human serum or plasma (sodium heparin, lithium
heparin, or dipotassium EDTA) on the LUMIPULSE G System.
The assay is to be used as an aid in the management of patients diagnosed with cancer of the
exocrine pancreas who have detectable levels of CA 19-9 at some point in their disease process.
Serial testing for patient CA 19-9 assay values should be used in conjunction with other clinical
methods used for monitoring cancer of the exocrine pancreas.
Warning Statement: The concentration of CA 19-9 in a given specimen, as determined by assays
from different manufacturers, can vary due to differences in assay methods and reagent
specificity. The results reported by the laboratory to the physician must include the identity of
the assay for CA 19-9 used. Values obtained with different assay methods cannot be used
interchangeably. If, in the course of monitoring a patient, the assay method used for determining
serial levels of CA 19-9 is changed, the laboratory must perform additional serial testing to
confirm baseline values. Prior to changing assays, the laboratory MUST confirm baseline values
for patients being serially monitored. Lumipulse G CA19-9-N should not be used for cancer
screening or diagnosis.
Patients known to be genotypically negative for Lewis blood group antigen are unable to produce
the CA 19-9 antigen even in the presence of malignant tissue. Phenotyping for the presence of
the Lewis blood group antigen may be insufficient to detect true Lewis antigen negative
individuals. Even patients who are genotype positive for the Lewis antigen may produce varying
levels of CA 19-9 as the result of gene dosage effect.

1) Antibody-Coated Particle Solution: Liquid when used. The 250 µL Immunoreaction
Cartridge contains 150 μg/mL anti-CA19-9 monoclonal antibody (mouse)-coated
particles, protein stabilizers (bovine and mouse) and chemical stabilizers in 0.15 M
sodium chloride/Tris buffer. This solution contains gelatin and turns into gel at 15 °C or
lower. Preservative: sodium azide.
2) Enzyme-Labeled Antibody Solution: Liquid. The 350 µL/Immunoreaction Cartridge
contains 0.5 μg/mL alkaline phosphatase (ALP: calf)-labeled anti-CA19-9 monoclonal
antibody (mouse), protein stabilizers (bovine, calf, and mouse) and chemical stabilizers in
0.05 M sodium chloride/Bis-Tris buffer. Preservative: sodium azide.
Materials required but not provided:
1) Lumipulse G CA19-9-N Calibrators: Liquid, CAL 1 and CAL 2
2) Quality Control material
3) Lumipulse G Substrate Solution
4) Lumipulse G Wash Solution
5) Lumipulse G Specimen Diluent 1
6) Sampling tips for LUMIPULSE G System
7) Soda lime for LUMIPULSE G System
8) Lumipulse G Dilution Cartridges
B Principle of Operation:
Lumipulse G CA19-9-N is an assay system, including a set of immunoassay reagents, for the
quantitative measurement of CA 19-9 in human serum and plasma (sodium heparin, lithium
heparin, or dipotassium EDTA) based on CLEIA technology by a two-step immunoassay method
on the LUMIPULSE G1200 System. CA 19-9 in specimens specifically binds to anti-CA19-9
monoclonal antibody (mouse) on the particles, and antigen-antibody immunocomplexes are
formed. The particles are washed and rinsed to remove unbound materials. Alkaline phosphatase
(ALP: calf)-labeled anti-CA19-9 monoclonal antibody (mouse) specifically binds to CA 19-9 of
the immunocomplexes on the particles, and additional immunocomplexes are formed. The
K191973 - Page 3 of 17

--- Page 4 ---
particles are washed and rinsed to remove unbound materials. Substrate Solution is added and
mixed with the particles.
AMPPD (3-(2’-spiroadamantane)-4-methoxy-4-(3”-phosphoryloxy)-phenyl-1, 2-dioxetane
disodium salt) contained in the Substrate Solution is dephosphorylated by the catalysis of ALP
indirectly conjugated to particles. Luminescence (at a maximum wavelength of 477 nm) is
generate by the cleavage reaction of dephosphorylated AMPPD. The luminescent signal reflects
the amount of CA 19-9.

2. Linearity:
Two native human serum sample pools (high and low) were prepared. The high sample pool
was diluted using the low sample pool in appropriate ratios to obtain 21 concentration levels
(0.1 to 530 U/mL) of CA 19-9 that covers the full range of the assay from 0.7 to 500 U/mL.
Four replicates were obtained at each concentration level to cover the assay measuring range.
Data were analyzed using linear regression based on CLSI EP6-A Evaluation of the Linearity

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a. Traceability: Calibration of the Lumipulse G CA19-9-N is traceable to in-house reference
calibrators, whose values have been assigned to correlate to Fujirebio Diagnostics’
CA19-9 radioimmunoassay.
b. Real Time Regent Stability: Six human serum samples at different level of CA 19-9 were
prepared for testing the real time stability of Lumipulse G CA19-9-N Immunoreaction
Cartridges (IC) and the Lumipulse G CA19-9 Calibrators. Three lot combinations of
Lumipulse G CA19-9-N ICs and Lumipulse G CA19-9-N Calibrators were utilized. The
reagents were evaluated across four time points: Study Initiation, 6 months, 12 months,
and 13 months. Each sample was tested in three runs and three replicates per run for a
total of nine replicates at Study Initiation and in two runs and three replicates per run for
a total of six replicates at 6 months, 12 months, and 13 months. The Lumipulse G CA19-
9-N ICs and Calibrators are stable for 12 months at 2–10°C.
c. On board Reagent Stability: Six human serum samples at different level of CA 19-9 were
prepared for testing the on-board stability of Lumipulse G CA19-9-N Immunoreaction
Cartridges (IC) and the Lumipulse G CA19-9 Calibrators on the LUMIPULSE G1200. A
single lot of Lumipulse G CA19-9-N ICs and Lumipulse G CA19-9-N Calibrators were
utilized. The reagents were evaluated in three replicates across four time points as
follows: Study Initiation, 30 days, 12 months ± 5 days, and 13 months ± 5 days. The
Lumipulse G CA19-9-N ICs and Calibrators on the LUMIPULSE G 1200 are stable up to
30 days on board. The study is ongoing.
d. Transport Conditions: The recommended transport condition for Lumipulse G CA19-9-N
Immunoreaction Cartridges (IC) and the Lumipulse G CA19-9 Calibrators is at 2–10°C.
e. Sample Stability: Sample stability was tested using eight human serum samples collected
across five tube types (SST serum, Red Top serum, K2 EDTA plasma, Lithium heparin
plasma, and sodium heparin plasma). Two conditions for sample stability were evaluated:
2–10°C and −20±10°C. Five aliquots were stored at 2–10°C and tested at Day 1, Day 4,
Day 7, Day 14, and Day 15. Three aliquots were stored at −20°C±10°C and tested at Day
7, Day 14, and Day 15. The samples were run on the LUMIPULSE G1200. The results
demonstrated that:
• Samples collected across five tube types (SST serum, Red Top serum, K2 EDTA
plasma, Lithium heparin plasma, and sodium heparin plasma) may be stored at 2–10°C
for up to 4 days.
• Samples collected across five tube types (SST serum, Red Top serum, K2 EDTA
plasma, Lithium heparin plasma, and sodium heparin plasma) may be stored at −20°C
±10°C for up to 14 days.
f. Expected Values: The calibrators are at two concentrations, 0 U/mL(CAL1) and 500
U/mL (CAL2).

6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB):
Two blank samples were prepared by diluting normal healthy serum with human serum
expressing ultra-low CA 19-9. Each sample was tested in ten replicates in each run with two
runs per day for three days using two regent lots and two instruments. There was a total of 60
replicates per sample. The LoB was estimated as the 95th percentile of the distribution of test
results using a non-parametric method. The highest estimate among the two lots was used as
the claimed LoB. The LoB was determined to be 0.1 U/mL.
Limit of Detection (LoD):
Seven serum samples containing low levels of CA 19-9 were tested in ten replicates in two
runs per day for three days using two regent lots and two instruments. Each lot was run on
one LUMIPULSE G1200 instrument. For each lot combination, there was a total of 60
replicates per sample per reagent lot combination. The study design generated a total of 60
test determinations with each reagent lot and instrument combination. The study was
conducted independently with two reagent lots and the highest estimate among the two lots
was used as the claimed LoD. The LoD was determined to be 0.19 U/mL.
Limit of Quantification (LoQ):
Seven serum samples containing low levels of CA 19-9 were tested in ten replicates in two
runs per day for three days using two regent lots and two instruments. Each lot was run on
one LUMIPULSE G1200 instrument. For each lot combination, there was a total of 60
replicates per sample per reagent lot combination. The study design generated a total of 60
test determinations with each reagent lot and instrument combination. The LoQ was
calculated to be 0.57 U/mL by identifying the measurand level at which a measurement
procedure demonstrated total within-lab imprecision of 15 %CV. The claimed LoQ is 0.57
U/mL
7. Assay Cut-Off:
See Clinical Cut-off below.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison:
A total of 130 human serum samples were obtained for the method comparison study. The
test samples were collected in red-top or serum separator tubes (SST). Only the samples with
the test results within the measuring range for both the Lumipulse G CA19-9-N and the
ARCHITECT CA 19-9 were included in the regression analysis (n=84). The samples
XR
tested ranged from 3.0 to 454.8 U/mL for Lumipulse G CA19-9 and 2.07 to 1056.05 U/mL
for ARCHITECT CA 19-9 assay. The linear regression analysis obtained from Passing-
XR

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
The clinical performance of the Lumipulse G CA19-9-N assay was determined on the
LUMIPULSE G1200 System by assessing changes in CA 19-9 levels in serial serum samples
from patients with exocrine pancreatic cancer and comparing the results to changes in the
disease status. The patients were females and males with a historically/pathologically
confirmed diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic cancers at any stage (Stage IA to IV). A
minimum of three to a maximum of 12 serial blood draws were collected from each patient.
The subject inclusion and exclusion criteria are as follows:
Inclusion criteria:
• Female or Male
• 22 years of age or older
• Diagnosed with exocrine pancreatic cancer

• Invalid informed consent or remnant sample documentation
The clinical data collected for each subject included the following: subject ID, age, gender,
race/ethnicity, date of cancer diagnosis, histology, grade, and stage. For each subject sample
draw, the following information will be collected, if available: chemotherapeutic treatment
information (onset date, end date, regimen), imaging information (type, findings), physical
exam date and findings, sample draw date, procedure information (type, date and findings),
clinical disease status (see below for description), date or recurrence, and date of death (if
subject expired).
Of the 83 patients, the age ranged from 47 to 87 years with a median of 65 years. Seventy-
four subjects (89.2%) were Caucasian/White and the remaining subjects included six (7.2%)
African American, two (2.4%) Asian/Pacific Islander, and one (1.2%) Other. A total of 374
pairs of observations were obtained from 83 patients with an average number of 5.6
observations per patient with a minimum of two follow up visits after the initial visit. Each
patient’s clinical disease status was evaluated by the clinical evidence which was identified
by reviewing the compilation of procedures and clinical notes which may have included but
were not limited to: imaging of various modalities, physical exam, physician transcription
notes, and/or other laboratory data. The clinical disease status was categorized to NED (no
evidence of disease), SD (stable disease), PD (progressive disease), or RD (Responding
disease) based on the change in the clinical evidence at the follow up visit compared to the
previous visit.
The CA 19-9 ratio distribution by clinical status is summarized below when the Lumipulse G
CA19-9-N test result at a follow up visit was compared to the level at the previous visit.

Based on the quantitative measures of CA 19-9 using the Lumipulse G CA19-9-N assay, a
positive change in CA 19-9 was defined as an increase in the CA 19-9 level that was at least
15% greater at the follow up visit compared to the level at the previous value visit. Sixty-five
percent (65%) or 45/70 of the patient samples with a positive change correlated with the
disease progression in the disease status category (NED, SD, PD, and RD) while 61%
(184/304) of the patient serial samples with no significant change in CA 19-9 value
correlated with no progression. The total concordance was 61% (229/374).
