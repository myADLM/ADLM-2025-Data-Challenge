III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Yumizen C1200 CRP reagent is intended for use as a high sensitive assay for the quantitative in
vitro diagnostic determination of the C-reactive protein in human serum and plasma based on an
immunoturbidimetric assay. CRP is used to evaluate conditions thought to be associated with
inflammation in otherwise healthy individuals.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Yumizen C1200 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The device consists of two reagents, 1 and 2, as follows:
Reagent 1: Buffer solution: glycine buffer solution
Reagent 2: Latex suspension: 0.20% w/v suspension of latex particles sensitized with anti-CRP
antibodies (rabbit)
B Principle of Operation:
Immune complexes formed in solution scatter light in proportion to their size, shape, and
concentration. Turbidimeters measure the reduction of incidence light due to reflection,
absorption or scatter. In this procedure, the measurement of the rate of decrease in light intensity
transmitted (increase in absorbance) through particles suspended in solution is the result of
complexes formed during the immunological reaction between the CRP of the patient sample
and rabbit anti-CRP-antibodies coated on latex particles.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Serum
Reproducibility was evaluated following the recommendations in CLSI EP05-A3 guideline
using 3 analyzers and 3 reagent lots (one lot per analyzer). One internal control (Low CRP
Control) and 4 serum samples covering the measuring range (low, medium, and high) were
tested in duplicate for 20 days, 2 runs per day. The results of reproducibility studies are
summarized in the tables below, where within-laboratory precision subsumes within-run,
between-run, and between-day precision:

specimens (sample low, mid, and high), 20 times each, in a single run for each sample. The
results of within-run precision studies are summarized below.

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was performed following the recommendations in CLSI EP06-A. A high
serum pool with a CRP concentration of 11.53 mg/L was prepared by spiking a patient serum
pool with CRP. A commercially available low serum pool with a CRP concentration of 0.03
mg/L was used. The high serum pool was then diluted with the low serum pool to create 10
intermediate samples (for a total of 12) covering and spanning the measuring range. Each
sample was tested in replicates of 3. Results of the polynomial analysis demonstrated that
the assay is linear, i.e., no second- or third-order fit was significantly better than the linear fit.
Linear regression analysis produced a slope of 0.9794, an intercept of 0.1996, and an r2 value
of 0.9983.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Common endogenous substances were evaluated for potential interference with the candidate
assay. The effect of these interferents was confirmed by dose-response testing at varying
concentrations of the interfering substance.
Samples were tested at five concentrations of interferent including an interferent-free control,
four replicates each, on serum samples representing normal (~1 mg/L) and high (~5 mg/L)

concentrations of CRP (except for Rheumatoid Factor, which was tested in two high-
concentration samples, ~5 and ~9 mg/L).
At the following concentrations, the maximum observed % difference was ≤ ± 10%. The data
provided supports the sponsor’s claims that no interference was seen at the concentrations
tested below:
• Hemoglobin – up to 500 mg/dL
• Triglycerides – up to 279 mg/dL
• Total Bilirubin – up to 27.61 mg/dL
• Direct Bilirubin – up to 30.41 mg/dL
• Acetylsalicylic Acid – up to 65.16 mg/dL
• Ascorbic Acid – up to 5.98 mg/dL
• Ibuprofen – up to 50.10 mg/dL
• Acetaminophen – up to 20 mg/dL
• Rheumatoid Factor – up to 400 IU/mL when measured at ~5 mg/L and ~9 mg/L CRP
The sponsor included the following information in the labeling: “At 395 mg/dL triglycerides,
there was a deviation of -11.2% per sample with a concentration of 4.15 mg/L CRP, and at
517 mg/dL triglycerides, there was a deviation of -10.5% per sample with a concentration of
0.83 mg/L CRP.”
Prozone Effect
The sponsor provided data to support their claim that no prozone effect is observed up to
CRP concentrations of 2044 mg/L.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The assay has a reportable range of 0.2 mg/L to 10 mg/L.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Calibrator traceability to IRMM (Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements) ERM-
DA472/IFCC is claimed, which is in turn traceable to the ERM-DA470/IFCC reference
material.

6. Detection Limit:
The sponsor performed limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of
quantitation (LoQ) studies following the recommendation in CLSI EP17-A2. The studies
were conducted using 2 reagent lots, with each lot evaluated separately for each parameter.
For each reagent lot, the LoB was estimated using a non-parametric option described in the
guideline using commercial depleted serum. The maximum LoB estimate was 0.09 mg/L.
The LoD was estimated following the non-parametric option described in the guideline using
low-analyte serum samples. The maximum LoD estimate was 0.13 mg/L.
LoQ studies were performed by analyzing five low-concentration serum samples. The
sponsor set a performance goal of <15% CV, and at 0.16 mg/L, the maximum imprecision
observed was 13% CV.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The sponsor performed a method comparison study comparing results from the candidate
method on the Yumizen C1200 to another legally marketed CRP assay.
One hundred and thirty-eight (138) serum samples, consisting of 124 patient samples and 14
spiked samples, spanning the measuring interval (0.2 mg/L to 10 mg/L), were tested in
duplicate on the candidate method and a comparator method. The study was performed on 5
testing days.
A Passing-Bablok regression analysis using the first replicate for each method was
performed, resulting in a slope of 0.9987, an intercept of -0.06852. The correlation
coefficient (r-value) was reported as 0.995.
2. Matrix Comparison:
The sponsor conducted a study to evaluate the performance of lithium heparin plasma
samples compared to serum samples. A total of 56 matched, native samples spanning the
measuring range were evaluated on the candidate device.
The data were collected using 1 instrument and 1 lot of reagent. A Passing-Bablok regression
analysis was performed using the first replicate of each matrix resulting in a slope of 0.9787,
an intercept of 0.003012. The correlation coefficient (r-value) was reported as 0.998.
