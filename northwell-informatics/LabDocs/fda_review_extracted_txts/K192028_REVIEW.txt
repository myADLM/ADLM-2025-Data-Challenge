III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Yumizen C1200 CRP reagent is intended for the quantitative in vitro diagnostic determination of
the C-reactive protein in human serum and lithium heparin plasma based on an
immunoturbidimetric assay. Measurement of C-reactive protein aids in evaluation of the amount
of injury to body tissues and for evaluation of infections, tissue injury and inflammatory
disorders. This test should be used in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Yumizen C1200 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer (cleared under K183375)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The composition of Yumizen C1200 CRP is as follows:
• Reagent 1: Buffer solution: Glycine buffer solution
• Reagent 2: Latex suspension: 0.20% w/v suspension of latex particles sensitized with anti-
CRP antibodies (rabbit)
Additional materials and equipment (not supplied):
• Automated clinical chemistry analyzer: Yumizen C1200
• Calibrators: Yumizen C1200 CRP Cal (1300023899)
• Controls: Yumizen C1200 Level 1 Protein Control (1300023944)
Yumizen C1200 Level 2 Protein Control (1300023945)
• Distilled or deionized water
• Standard laboratory equipment
B Principle of Operation:
Yumizen C1200 CRP is a latex-enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay to measure CRP levels in
serum and plasma samples for conventional CRP ranges. When an antigen-antibody reaction
occurs between CRP in a sample and anti-CRP antibody which has been sensitized to latex
particles, agglutination occurs. This agglutination is detected as an absorbance change, with the
magnitude of the change being proportional to the quantity of CRP in the sample. The actual
concentration is then determined by interpolation from a calibration curve prepared from
calibrators of known concentration.

2. Linearity:
The linearity was evaluated using a series of pooled human serum samples prepared to
evenly cover the CRP concentration range of 0.00 to 188.48 mg/L. Each sample dilution was
measured in one run with three replicates; the mean of the three replicates was calculated for
each sample. Linear regression analysis of observed CRP value vs. expected value was
performed to determine whether the sample set exhibits linearity based on the CLSI guideline
EP06-A. The linear regression results for nine samples within the measuring interval are
shown in the table below.
Slope Intercept
Range (mg/L) 2

1.03 -1.33
9.42 – 150.78 1.00
(1.01 – 1.05) (-3.23 – 0.58)
Prozone Effect: The prozone effect was evaluated for the Yumizen C1200 CRP on the
Yumizen C1200 analyzer using native human serum samples spiked with a high CRP stock
solution. Theoretical concentration and the concentration measured of the study samples and
the calibrators was compared. A prozone effect was determined if the slope of the sample and
the calibrator over the theoretical concentration curve was inverted. A security range was
calculated corresponding to 110% of the rate of the highest calibration point. No prozone
effect was found for the CRP level up to 360 mg/L.
Dilution Study: The study was done using a total of seven serum samples with CRP
concentrations above the measuring interval and ranging from 162.73 to 737.40 mg/L. Each
sample was diluted at a 1:5 dilution manually and automatically on the Yumizen C1200
analyzer. Each dilution was tested in four replicates and the mean was calculated. The
difference in the test results between manual and automatic dilution for each dilution sample
was shown to be <10% up to 737.40 mg/L using 1:5 sample dilution.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
To investigate the test performance with presence of potential endogenous and exogenous
interferents, two pooled human serum samples with various CRP concentrations (72 and 110
mg/L for testing rheumatoid factor; ~ 11 and ~ 26 mg/L for testing all other potential
interferents) were prepared and spiked with potential interfering substances at four different
levels. The CRP level in the test samples was measured in four replicates and the recovery in
relation to the unspiked sample without interferent was calculated. The acceptance criterion
was < 10% in the mean bias for the individual recovery. No significant interference was
observed up to the concentration of the potential interfering substances as shown in the table
below.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The analytical measuring range of Yumizen C1200 CRP is 5 to 160 mg/L.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a. Traceability: The calibrators are traceable against IRMM/ERM-DA472/IFCC.
b. Reagent Shelf-Life Stability: The reagent shelf-life was previously evaluated under
K061138 on ABX PENTRA 400 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer. The reagent shelf-life
tested on Yumizen C1200 analyzer was verified up to 6 months at 2–10°C. Further
verification for a longer-term shelf-life stability on Yumizen C1200 analyzer is ongoing.
c. On-board Stability: The on-board stability was evaluated by testing samples with CRP
concentrations at 22.9, 64.8, and 139.2 mg/L, and two controls at 1, 36, 46, 53, and 62
days using reagents stored on the Yumizen C1200 analyzer. The Yumizen C1200 CRP
reagent is stable on-board for up to 62 days.
d. Calibration Stability: Stability of the calibration on the Yumizen C1200 analyzer was
evaluated by testing samples at different CRP concentrations (22.7, 65.1, and 139.1
mg/L) and two controls at 0, 8, 13, 19, 25, 35, and 36 days after an initial calibration. The
Yumizen C1200 CRP calibration is stable on-board for up to 4 weeks.
e. Sample Stability: The sample is stable for 11 days at 20–25°C, 2 months at 4–8°C, and 3
years at -20°C. (Reference: Use of Anticoagulants in Diagnostic Laboratory
Investigations. WHO Publication WHO/DIL/LAB/99.1 Rev. 2. 2002, p28.)
6. Detection Limit:
For limit of blank (LoB), a set of four analyte depleted serum samples was investigated using
two reagent lots. Each sample was tested in four replicates per run, one run per day for four
days to reach a total of 64 measurements per reagent lot. LoB was determined per CLSI
EP17-A2. The higher value from both lots was taken for the LoB at 0.14 mg/L.

For limit of detection (LoD), a set of four low level serum samples in the range below the
measuring interval was investigated using two reagent lots. Each sample was tested in four
replicates per run, one run per day for four days to reach a total of 64 measurements per
reagent lot. The LoD was determined per CLSI EP17-A2. The higher value from both lots
was taken for the LoD at 0.23 mg/L.
For limit of quantitation (LoQ), a set of five low measurand content serum samples from the
lower end of the measuring interval was investigated. Each sample was tested in two
replicates per run, four runs per day for five days using two lots to reach a total of 80
measurements. The LoQ was determined as 0.47 mg/L following CLSI EP17-A2, the sample
with the highest value for the %CV in accordance with the specification for both reagent lots
(<20%). The claimed LoQ is 5 mg/L.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
See below for Expected Values/Reference Range
D Clinical Cut-Off:
See Expected Values/Reference range.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The expected value in the normal population aged 20 to 60 years is < 5mg/L per literature
(Roberts WL, McMillin GA, Burtis CA, Bruns DE. Reference Information for the Clinical
Laboratory, Tietz Textbook of Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Diagnostics; 4th Ed., Burtis
CA, Ashwood ER, Bruns DE (2006): 2263).
This reference range was verified by testing 80 normal healthy subjects (44 female and 36 male)
aged 20 to 60 years. Seventy-six (76) of 80 samples (95%) tested had concentrations within the
consensus reference interval taken from the literature reference.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
