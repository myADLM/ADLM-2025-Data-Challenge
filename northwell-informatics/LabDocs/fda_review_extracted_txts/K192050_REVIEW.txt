III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
ETEST is a manual, quantitative technique for determination of antimicrobial susceptibility of
non-fastidious Gram-negative and Gram-positive aerobic bacteria and fastidious bacteria. The
system comprises a predefined antibiotic gradient which is used to determine the Minimum
Inhibitory Concentration (MIC, in μg/mL) of different antimicrobial agents against
microorganisms tested on agar media using overnight incubation.
Eravacycline has been shown to be active against most isolates of the microorganisms listed
below according to the FDA label for this antimicrobial agent.
ETEST ERV can be used to determine the MIC of Eravacycline against the following
microorganisms:
Active both in vitro and in clinical infections:
Gram-negative:
Citrobacter freundii
Enterobacter cloacae
Escherichia coli
Klebsiella oxytoca
Klebsiella pneumoniae
Gram-positive:
Enterococcus faecalis
Enterococcus faecium
In vitro data are available for the following microorganisms, but clinical significance is
unknown:
Citrobacter koseri
Klebsiella aerogenes
B Indication(s) for Use:
Same as Intended Use
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
• Rx - For Prescription Use Only
• The ability of ETEST Eravacycline to detect the following non-susceptible
Enterobacteriaceae isolates is unknown because non-susceptible isolates were not available
at the time of comparative testing: Citrobacter koseri.
• Due to the lack of an intermediate interpretive category for Eravacycline, results obtained
with E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae and E. faecium showed potential for very major errors
compared to the reference method and results obtained with E. faecalis showed potential for
major and very major errors. If critical to patient care, testing should be repeated using an
alternative testing/reference method prior to reporting results for:
K192050 - Page 2 of 12

--- Page 3 ---
E. cloacae when ETEST MIC is 0.5 µg/mL (Susceptible)
K. pneumoniae when ETEST MIC is 0.25 or 0.5 µg/mL (Susceptible)
E. faecium when ETEST MIC is 0.064 µg/mL (Susceptible)
E. faecalis when ETEST MIC is 0.064 (Susceptible) or 0.125 µg/mL (non-Susceptible).
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Manual reading only
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ETEST gradient technology is based on a combination of the concepts of dilution and
diffusion principles for susceptibility testing.
The ETEST consists of a thin, inert, nonporous plastic strip that is used to determine the
antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria. One side of the strip has the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) reading scale expressed in μg/mL. The other side of the strip contains a
predefined continuous exponential gradient of antibiotic concentrations.
When the strip is applied to an inoculated agar surface, the preformed antibiotic gradient
immediately transfers into the agar matrix, then forming a stable, continuous and exponential
gradient of antibiotic concentrations directly underneath the strip. Bacterial growth becomes
visible during incubation, and a symmetrical inhibition ellipse centered along the strip appears.
The MIC value is read from the scale in terms of μg/mL at complete inhibition of bacterial
growth, where the pointed end of the ellipse intersects the strip.
ETEST Eravacycline contains a range of eravacycline from 0.002 to 32 μg/mL.
B Principle of Operation:
When the ETEST strip is applied to an inoculated agar surface, the preformed antibiotic gradient
immediately transfers into the agar matrix, then forming a stable, continuous and exponential
gradient of antibiotic concentrations directly underneath the strip. Bacteria growth becomes
visible during incubation, and a symmetrical inhibition ellipse centered along the strip appears.
After incubation, the MIC value is read from the scale in terms of μg/mL at complete inhibition
of bacterial growth, where the pointed end of the ellipse intersects the strip. Since ETEST
generates MIC values which fall between two-fold dilutions for interpretation, the MIC value
read must be recorded to the next two-fold dilution.

suspensions. However, the result of one colony count was missing for one of the 27
replicates of Enterobacter cloacae. This missing value was accepted.
The overall mean inoculum densities (CFU/mL) for isolates tested with the reference method
ranged from 3.57 x 105 to 5.72 x 105. The overall mean inoculum densities for isolates tested
with the ETEST ranged from 6.43 x 107 to 1.72 x 108.
The inoculum densities were acceptable.
Purity Check. Verification of isolate purity was conducted on all clinical, challenge and
reproducibility organism suspensions for each ETEST and from each growth control well of
the broth microdilution (BMD) reference panel.
Growth or Device Failure. No device failures occurred in the ETEST Eravacycline clinical
trial.
Quality Control Testing. The CLSI recommended QC strains (E. coli ATCC 25922,
Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853) were tested at least 20
times per site at four sites using both ETEST and BMD reference methods. The results are
summarized in Table 1.
The Quality Control results were within the recommended range > 95% of the time which is

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Results obtained with ETEST Eravacycline were compared to results obtained with the CLSI
broth microdilution (BMD) reference panel. The reference panel, prepared and interpreted
according to recommendations outlined in the CLSI M07 11th ed., contained two-fold serial
dilutions of eravacycline with a concentration range of 0.002 – 32 μg/mL. At the end of
incubation, the MIC value obtained from the ETEST (where the complete inhibition of
growth intersects the strip) was compared to MIC results obtained with the reference method.
The testing conditions for ETEST consisted of the following:
• Inoculum: Direct colony suspension to achieve a suspension equivalent to a
0.5 McFarland standard suspension
• Medium: Cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton agar
• Incubation: 35° C ± 2 for 16-20 hours
Clinical testing for ETEST Eravacycline was evaluated at three external sites (two located
within the United States and one located outside the United States). Each clinical isolate was
tested one time by ETEST and BMD using the same initial standardized inoculum prepared
in 0.85% saline. A total of 600 clinical isolates were tested which included 480
Enterobacteriaceae isolates [C. freundii (60), C. koseri (30), E. cloacae (60), E. coli (180),
K. aerogenes (29), K. oxytoca (31), K. pneumoniae (90)] and 120 Enterococcus isolates [E.
faecalis (60), E. faecium (60)]. Of the tested clinical isolates, 78.2% (469/600) were
considered contemporary (i.e., tested within six months of the organism’s original isolation
from clinical culture) and 21.8% (131/600) were considered stock (i.e., no time limit on time
from isolation prior to testing).
Challenge testing was performed at one internal site using ETEST and BMD. A total of 79
challenge isolates were tested which included 62 Enterobacteriaceae isolates [C. freundii
(10), E. cloacae (12), E. coli (11), K. aerogenes (3), K. oxytoca (12), K. pneumoniae (14)]
and 17 Enterococcus isolates [E. faecalis (14), E. faecium (3)].
In total, the comparative study included clinical and challenge isolates as follows: 542
Enterobacteriaceae [C. freundii (70), C. koseri (30), E. cloacae (72), E. coli (191), K.
aerogenes (32), K. oxytoca (43), K. pneumoniae (104)] and 137 Enterococcus spp. [E.
faecalis (74), E. faecium (63)]. Information on the numbers of each Enterobacteriaceae and
Enterococcus species is included as a footnote to the performance table in the labeling.
K192050 - Page 7 of 12

At the time of comparative testing, non-susceptible isolates were not available for
Citrobacter koseri. This is addressed with the following statement included in the
Limitations section of the device labeling:
The ability of ETEST Eravacycline to detect the following non-susceptible
Enterobacteriaceae isolates is unknown because non-susceptible isolates were not
available at the time of comparative testing: Citrobacter koseri.
To address testing of non-indicated species, the following statement is included in the
Precautions section of the device labeling:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and
efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this
AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled
clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those
found in the indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of
susceptibility information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for
specific antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is
approved.

(eravacycline has only a “susceptible” category), further analysis of the errors was performed
and adjustments were made by considering the MIC values of the errors compared to the
reference MIC value. Four of the five very major errors had an MIC value that was one
doubling dilution from the reference and thus in essential agreement. Therefore, the adjusted
very major error rate is 1.1% (1/92) which is acceptable. To address the adjustment of the
very major errors, the following statement is included as a footnote to the performance table
in the device labeling:
The overall categorical very major error rate for eravacycline when testing
Enterobacteriaceae clinical and challenge isolates is 5.4% (5/92). Based on the essential
agreement and lack of an intermediate breakpoint for eravacycline, the overall adjusted very
major error rate for Enterobacteriaceae clinical and challenge isolates is 1.1% (1/92).
When evaluating individual species, the major error rate of C. freundii was 7.0% (4/53). All
major error MIC values were in essential agreement with the reference resulting in an
adjusted major error of zero. This error adjustment is acceptable as there was evidence of
trending towards higher MIC values, which is consistent with the type of error (see below).
This is addressed in a trending footnote to the performance table in the device labeling.
When evaluating E. cloacae, the very major error rate was 11.5% (3/29). All very major error
MIC values were in essential agreement with the reference. However, adjustment of the very
major error is inappropriate since there was no evidence of trending that is consistent with
this type of error (see below). When evaluating K. pneumoniae, the very major error rate was
5.9% (2/34). One of the two K. pneumoniae very major errors had an MIC value that was in
essential agreement with the reference. Therefore, the adjusted very major error rate is at
2.9% (1/34).
To mitigate the potential for occurrence of these errors, the following statement was included
in the Limitations section of the device labeling:
Due to the lack of an intermediate interpretive category for Eravacycline, results
obtained with E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae and E. faecium showed potential for very
major errors compared to the reference method and results obtained with E. faecalis
showed potential for major and very major errors. If critical to patient care, testing
should be repeated using an alternative testing/reference method prior to reporting
results for:
E. cloacae when ETEST MIC is 0.5 µg/mL (Susceptible)
K. pneumoniae when ETEST MIC is 0.25 or 0.5 µg/mL (Susceptible)
E. faecium when ETEST MIC is 0.064 µg/mL (Susceptible)
E. faecalis when ETEST MIC is 0.064 (Susceptible) or 0.125 µg/mL (non-Susceptible).
ETEST Eravacycline performance for all E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates (clinical and
challenge) is acceptable with 100% EA and 94.9% CA. There were four major errors (4/128
= 3.1%) and three very major errors (3/9 = 33.3%). All errors had an MIC value that was in
essential agreement with the reference. Therefore, the adjusted major and very major error is
zero which is acceptable. To address the adjustment of the major and very major errors, the
following statement is included as a footnote to the performance table in the device labeling:
K192050 - Page 9 of 12

--- Page 10 ---
The overall categorical major and very major error rates for eravacycline when testing
Enterococcus spp. (E. faecalis and E. faecium) clinical and challenge isolates is 3.1%
(4/128) and 33.3% (3/9), respectively. Based on the essential agreement and lack of an
intermediate breakpoint for eravacycline, the overall adjusted major and very major
error rates for testing Enterococcus spp. clinical and challenge isolates is zero.
Inoculator and ETEST Strip Applicator Options
Culture media plates for ETEST can be inoculated and streaked by swabs manually or with
the RETRO C80 inoculator. ETEST strips can be applied onto inoculated media using
forceps or the NEMA C88 vacuum pen.
The ETEST Eravacycline studies used manual inoculation with swabs and applied ETEST
strips with forceps at all test sites. The following statement is included as a footnote to the
performance table in the device labeling:
The optional inoculator and ETEST strip applicator were used for plate inoculation and
applying ETEST strips onto agar media. In the ETEST Eravacycline clinical studies,
swabs were used for plate inoculation/streaking and forceps were used for ETEST strip
application.
Trending
A trending analysis was conducted using the combined data (clinical and challenge) for each
organism species and group. This trending calculation analyzes device MIC values that are
determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or higher than the reference method.
MIC values that are off-scale for both the reference and device are not considered in the
trending analysis.
Trending results were stratified by species to determine if species-related trends were
observed (Table 3). Species for which the difference between the percentage of isolates with
higher versus lower MIC values was ≥30% and for which the confidence interval was
determined to be statistically significant were considered to have evidence of trending and is
addressed in labeling.
A trend toward higher MIC values was observed for C. freundii, E. coli and K. aerogenes.
The following statement is included as a footnote to the performance table in the device
labeling:
ETEST Eravacycline MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or at least one
doubling dilution higher when testing C. freundii, E. coli and K. aerogenes compared to
the CLSI reference broth microdilution method. Of these species, only C. freundii
reported categorical errors (4/53 (7%) were major errors), all of which were within
essential agreement of the reference method which is acceptable.

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the ETEST Eravacycline when revised breakpoints for eravacycline are
published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included with the
submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, bioMérieux will update the eravacycline
device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section after re-
evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any new
limitations as determined by their evaluation.
