6. DNA Extraction:
PGDx elio tissue complete assay requires genomic DNA isolated from FFPE tissue using an
appropriate commercially available DNA extraction method. DNA extraction kits should be
able to yield 50 ng of DNA with a minimum concentration of 1 ng/µL. The recommended
DNA input for PGDx elio tissue complete is 100 ng of total DNA recovered from tissue
with a minimum 20% viable tumor nuclei. While recommended DNA input for the assay is
100ng, results can be obtained with DNA inputs down to 50 ng. The assay has been
validated with extracted DNA stored at ≤ -20 °C for up to 9 months.
7. Library Preparation:
The PGDx elio tissue complete assay workflow begins with genomic DNA. Genomic DNA
is quantified using a fluorometer. DNA molecules are mechanically sheared to a target size
of 200 bp and subjected to a magnetic bead purification step to remove smaller fragments
and perform an exchange of buffer. Fragmented DNA is end-repaired, phosphorylated, and
adenylated. Indexed adapters are then ligated to the A-tailed DNA molecules.
Unincorporated adapters and reagents are removed by magnetic bead purification. Adapter-
ligated DNA is enriched by PCR amplification. Primer dimers and residual reagents are
removed by magnetic bead purification. Library quality is assessed using a DNA fragment
analyzer prior to hybrid capture. Sample libraries must be ≥ 15 ng/µL within the 180-800 bp
range with the average peak size ≥ 250 bp in length, and external control (EC) for the batch
must be ≥ 15 ng/µL within the 180-800 bp range with the average peak size ≥ 250 bp in
length, prior to proceeding to hybridization / target enrichment.
8. Hybrid Capture NGS:
The adapter-ligated library is hybridized with biotinylated RNA library baits and targeted
regions are captured using magnetic streptavidin coated beads. Captured DNA libraries are
purified to remove baits and incompletely hybridized DNA fragments. Captured libraries are
enriched by PCR amplification. Primer dimers and residual reagents are removed by
magnetic bead purification. Final library quality is assessed using a DNA fragment analyzer
prior to sequencing. Samples and external control must be ≥ 10 nM within the 180-800 bp
range with the average size ≥ 250 bp in length. If the level of primer/adapter dimers in
sample library lanes (100-180 bp region) is > 5% of the library yield, the library has failed
QC and steps starting from library preparation must be repeated.
9. Sequencing:
Sample libraries are quantified and normalized into a sequencing pool of up to 15 samples
and an external control. Partial batches are supported using a filler of diverse material, such
as PGDx elio diversiPhi, or previously captured libraries. Pooled sample libraries are
fluorometrically quantified, loaded on a sequencing flow cell, and sequenced.
10. Data Analysis:
a) Data Management System (DMS): Sequence data is automatically processed using
the PGDx elio platform software that tracks sample names, sample metadata and
K192063 - Page 6 of 108

--- Page 7 ---
processing status from sequencing through to analysis and reporting. Reports of
identified alterations are available in a web-based user interface for download.
Sequencing and sample metrics are available in run and case reports, including
sample and sequencing quality.
b) Demultiplexing and FASTQ Generation: Demultiplexing software generates
FASTQ files containing sequence reads and quality scores for each of the samples
on a sequencing run. The FASTQ formatted data files are used for subsequent
processing of samples.
c) Indexing QC check: Samples are checked for an expected yield of sequence reads
identified to detect mistakes in pooling samples. Samples outside the expected range
are marked as failed.
d) Read Alignment and BAM Generation: Genome alignment is performed to map
sequence reads for each sample to the human reference genome (hg19/GRCh37).
Alignments are saved as Binary Alignment Map (BAM) formatted files, which
contain read placement information relative to the reference genome with quality
scores. Aligned BAM files are further processed in a pipeline to identify genomic
alterations.
e) Sample QC checks: Samples are checked for possible contamination through a
bioinformatic analysis of genome haplotypes, based on an analysis of pre-defined
SNP sites that are characteristic of populations and individuals. Samples containing
more than one haplotype are considered potentially contaminated and are marked as
failed. Sequence coverage is assessed across the panel requiring 90% of targeted
regions with a minimum >100x coverage.
f) Mutation calling: A fully automated pipeline for bioinformatic analysis is used to
identify genomic alterations, including SNVs, indels, select amplifications and
translocations, and MSI, and TMB.
i. SNVs and Indels: Candidate mutations are evaluated and filtered for
characteristics of high confidence somatic variants, including mutant allele
frequency, sequence coverage and quality, genomic context, functional
annotation, germline status, and prevalence in a database of normal controls. A
minimum of 4 or 6 mutant observations and 0.4%, 2%, or 5% mutant allele
fraction (MAF) are required depending on sequence coverage and status of the
variant as a Variant with Evidence of Clinical Significance, somatic hotspot, or a
Variant with Potential Clinical Significance. SNVs with lower bound 95%
Confidence Interval <5% MAF based on sequence coverage are excluded from
reporting. Common germline mutations present in dbSNP, ExAC, and gnomAD
are identified and excluded from reporting. Additional germline mutations with ≥
3 matches in ExAC and MAF ≥ 20% are also excluded from reporting.
ii. Amplifications: The assay is validated to detect ERBB2 amplification. The
amplification is identified based on comparing normalized sequence coverage
against a collection of normal controls run by PGDx elio tissue complete. A fold
change from diploid is estimated from the observed change in coverage combined
with an in-silico prediction of tumor purity. ERBB2 gene amplifications are
K192063 - Page 7 of 108

--- Page 8 ---
reported when predicted fold >2.5x are observed in >25% of evaluated regions of
interest for the gene. The test is validated for reporting only amplifications in the
ERBB2 gene.
iii. Translocations: The assay is validated to report 4 translocations only, ALK, RET
and NTRK2, NTRK3. Translocations are identified based on observations of
reads supporting gene fusions in genomic alignments of discordantly mapped or
split read pairs.
iv. Microsatellite instability: Microsatellite instability is assessed from select
mononucleotide tracts and signatures of genomic context from sequence
mutations. A linear classifier determines an overall case status of microsatellite
instability-high (MSI-H), microsatellite stable (MSS), or indeterminate by
combining the frequency of unstable tracts and signatures of observed mutations.
v. Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB): TMB is calculated based on detected sequence
mutations and indels. Filtering of sequence mutations is performed to exclude low
mutant allele fraction mutations (<5% MAF), common somatic driver mutations,
and common germline mutations. Both synonymous and non-synonymous
alterations are considered for the mutation load. TMB is reported as the number of
mutations per megabase (Muts/Mb)
11. Controls:
a) Negative Control: A no template control (NTC) can be processed to serve as a
negative control to validate the acceptability of all the test samples processed
through library preparation and capture steps by testing for sample or reagent
contamination. The NTC is not included on the sequencing run.
b) Positive Control: An external control that is provided in the PGDx elio tissue
complete assay reagent kit consists of cell line derived-DNA with multiple verified
sequence mutations. The external control is processed from library preparation
through sequencing to serve as an end to end control to demonstrate assay
performance. The external control is checked for quality during library preparation
and after sequencing. Failure of the external control to meet the pre-defined quality
metrics will result in all test samples on the run being reported as “No result.”
12. Result Reporting:
PGDx elio tissue complete reports SNVs and indels in protein coding regions across all
genes in the panel. In addition, amplifications are reported for ERBB2 as well as
translocations for ALK, RET, NTRK2, and NTRK3. Germline mutations, including
common polymorphisms in the population, present in dbSNP v150, ExAC v0.3.1, and
gnomAD v2.0.2, are filtered and excluded from reports. SNVs and indels that are not
Variants with Evidence of Clinical Significance or hotspots will also be removed from
reporting if they have ≥ 3 ExAC hits and have a MAF ≥ 20%. The assay also reports on
two genomic signatures, MSI and TMB.
K192063 - Page 8 of 108

--- Page 9 ---
Variants are reported in one of two levels of evidence1: Variants with Evidence of
Clinical Significance and Variants with Potential Clinical Significance. Variants
reported as having evidence of clinical significance are defined by AMP/ASCO/CAP
guidelines (Li et al., 2017), specifically, variants meeting Tier 1A evidence. The variants
listed in the section Variants with Evidence of Clinical Significance are determined
based on the selected tumor type. Only variants clinically associated with the tested
tumor type will appear in the Variants with Evidence of Clinical Significance section.
Any remaining detected variants will appear as the Variants with Potential Clinical
Significance. Any variants clinically associated with tumor types other than the one
selected will be reported in the section labeled 'Variants with Potential Clinical
Significance. A list of all 505 genes is provided in Appendix A and a list of excluded
exons in the genes or excluded regions due to challenging regions (e.g., low
complexity/repeats) is provided in Appendix B and Appendix C, respectively .
Reporting software was designed to mask results that have low confidence allele
frequencies levels near the calling threshold. The PGDx elio tissue complete analytical
pipeline calculates a 95% CI around the estimated MAF for all sequence mutations.
PGDx has applied a reporting filter to mask Level 3 non-hotspot SNV calls that have a
lower bound 95% CI <5% MAF. By taking this approach, unreliable results at low MAF
are filtered out of reporting, while high confidence calls in this range will still be
reported.
Indeterminates: For select genes and regions, quality metrics are assessed to check for
low coverage or incomplete data needed to identify an alteration. Indeterminate status is
reported when 1) no evidence of the alteration was found, but minimum coverage was
not met to support the verified limit of detection, or 2) insufficient evidence of the
alteration was observed, but minimum coverage thresholds were not met to report the
variant. Supporting evidence of detected alterations and coverage in read data is
available in the Complete Case Record (CCR). Indeterminate status is reported when
evidence of a sequence mutation is observed in regions of low coverage below < 80x.
Indeterminate status is also reported for select genes and codons when low coverage is
observed and there is no evidence of an alteration. The minimum coverage threshold
range is 116x - 248x in cases where select genes and codons are called negative.
13. Quality Metrics
Reporting takes in account the quality metrics outlined in Table 4. Quality metrics are
assessed across the following categories:
• Batch-level: Metrics that are quantified per sequencing run; failing batch-level
metrics generates “No result” reports samples failing these criteria. If the external
control fails these criteria, “No result” is reported for the entire batch of samples.
• Sample-level: Metrics that are quantified per sample; generates “No result” report
for a sample failing QC.
• Analyte-level: Metrics that are quantified for individual alteration types and
positions, such as sequence coverage. Variants passing analyte-level QC are
reported.

tissue complete targets cancer-associated genes that are enriched from genomic libraries
using a hybrid capture-based chemistry. Genomic libraries are prepared and captured.
Samples are pooled for sequencing. After sequencing, automated software executes a
bioinformatics analysis pipeline to identify genomic alterations in sequence data. The PGDx
elio tissue complete assay workflow does not use a patient-matched normal sample but
filters polymorphisms using databases. A summary of the alterations found, including a PDF
case report, are reported in output files and provided in a user interface as part of the PGDx
elio platform software.
C Determination of assay thresholds:
1. Requirements on exon coverage:
A power analysis was conducted to determine the sequence coverage necessary to detect
mutations with true underlying MAFs as low as 2%. Statistical power was estimated
based on a requirement of 4 mutant observations to make a positive call. Sequence
coverage of >400x provides 95% statistical power for detection of true mutations at 2%
MAF (95% CI, 0.8% - 3.5% MAF). For mutations with 5% underlying MAF, sequence
coverage of >150x provides 95% statistical power for detection (95% CI, 2.0%-8.6%
MAF).
Summary statistics were calculated for individual exons across a cohort of samples to
identify exons with consistent below-target coverage. These regions were removed from
PGDx elio tissue complete and are not included in variant analysis or reporting.
Additional repeat and low complexity regions are also excluded from reporting. The
excluded regions are listed in Appendix B and Appendix C. No Variants with Evidence
of Clinical Significance or somatic hotspot mutations are masked from reports.
Sequence coverage was evaluated in the remaining regions across a cohort of 175 FFPE
samples, and 99.5% of targeted regions (6,991 of 7,026 regions) were sequenced to a
depth of 100x or greater with >98% of all regions sequenced to a depth of 250x or greater.
Regions with somatic hotspot mutations exhibited sequence coverage >250x. Prediction of
tumor mutation burden was maintained in low coverage samples, as demonstrated by low
variability across replicates in simulations with coverage loss of up to 10% of exons.
Overall, coefficient of variation (CV) estimates are below 25.6%, with an average CV of
11.7%. Excluding TMB scores below limit of blank (LoB), CV estimates are below 20%.
2. Requirements on sample coverage:
Sequence coverage was evaluated across a range of FFPE samples (n=175 across 8
different tissue types) to obtain sample summary statistics. Overall sample coverage was
high in targeted regions of interest (Figure 1; Figure 1 shows a bar graph demonstrating the
mutant frequency relative to the mean read depth) with high percentage of targeted exons
covered (Figure 2). The mean coverage across all targeted regions for the FFPE samples
was 915x (SD=375).
Sequence coverage was further evaluated to establish minimum criteria for the analysis and
reporting of variants. Based on a power analysis, a minimum sequence coverage of 100x is
necessary to call mutations with true underlying mutation frequency of 8% or greater. The
number of exons for an individual sample meeting this coverage threshold was evaluated to
established a per sample threshold. The samples evaluated included a range of DNA quality
K192063 - Page 11 of 108

--- Page 12 ---
estimates based on DNA fragment analysis. Of 175 samples evaluated, >97% of samples (171
of 175 samples) demonstrated ≥ 100x coverage across at least 90% of targeted regions of
interest (Figure 3 and Figure 4). The consistently high coverage supports tolerance of
occasional low coverage regions that may be seen with varying sample quality. A threshold of
90% of Regions of Interest (ROIs) with at least 100x coverage was selected and is used to
determine if a sample is sequenced to sufficient depth for analysis and reporting.

regions of PGDx elio tissue complete. Dashed line indicates coverage at 100x.
Figure 2. Evaluation of ROI loss and impact on TMB estimation. For each sample
with at least 90% ROIs with ≥ 100x coverage (n=175), loss of 10% of ROIs was
simulated (n=10,000 simulations per sample) to evaluate the effect on TMB estimates.

3. Requirements on mutation coverage, allele depth and frequency for positive calls:
Variant calling parameters such as sequence coverage, mutation coverage, and mutation
frequency were assessed as filters for specificity while maintaining the ability to detect
K192063 - Page 13 of 108

--- Page 14 ---
true positive calls. Thresholds were established to ensure specificity is maintained at
targeted MAF levels for reporting. Mutation frequency thresholds were established at
0.4%, 2%, and 5% for sequence mutations based on a categorization of Variants with
Evidence of Clinical Significance, somatic hotspots, and non-hotspots positions.
Additional filtering of Variants with Potential Clinical Significance excludes reporting of
insertions and deletions in homopolymer regions (5 bp or greater) below 12% MAF as
well as sequence mutations with lower bound 95% Confidence Interval <5% MAF based
on sequence coverage. Additional quality metrics, such as base quality and strand bias
were also incorporated in assessments of confidence for pipeline filters. A cohort of
normal FFPE tissue (n=36) was used to provide empirical evidence that specificity was
maintained using the pipeline thresholds and filters.

F Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance- General:
The PGDx elio tissue complete is a targeted NGS panel with 505 genes. The targeted
regions of interest in PGDx elio tissue complete are designed to detect single nucleotide
variants (SNVs) as well as small insertions and deletions (indels) < 30bp in length in the
coding exons of the targeted genes, as well as ERBB2 amplifications, ALK, RET,
NTRK2, and NTRK3 translocations, MSI, and TMB. For SNVs and indels, A
representative approach to validation of the targeted genes in the panel was submitted
with data representing variant types for SNVs and indels, and at the gene level for
amplification and translocations indicated with this assay. In addition, the assay was
evaluated for performance regarding the panel wide quality metrics.
a) Invalid Rates
Multiple factors can influence overall robustness and performance of complex
molecular tests, including pre-analytical factors and overall sample quality. If key in-
process or automated data quality metrics are not met, PGDx elio tissue complete
supports repeating samples through the workflow. Performance throughout
verification and validation of the device was tracked and a summary of the rates for
first pass (no repeat) and overall pass (allowing for a single repeat) are presented
below. Data were aggregated for clinical cases from >40 tumor types. Resulting pass
rates for all samples (clinical samples and cell lines) are presented in Table 5, while
Table 6 shows invalid rate by tumor type across the workflow. The data shows that
there the performance across tumor types is supportive of a pan tumor profiling.

Reproducibility was assessed for each positive variant detected across all 36 replicates
(Positive call rate) – The positive call rate was calculated based on the total number of
mutations along with the two-sided 95% confidence interval.
Table 8 summarizes the positive call rates stratified by mutation type (SNV, insertions,
and deletions) and mutant allele frequency (MAF). Overall call rate 86.2% across all
samples and replicates (14493/16813, 85.7%-86.7% CI) with increased positive call rate
at higher mutant allele frequency (MAFs). In terms of invalid rate, the first pass rate was
90.3% (455/504) and the overall pass rate of the study after repeat testing was 98.2%
(495/504) allowing a maximum of 1 round of repeat testing.
The positive call rates for individual sequence mutations assessed in the Interlaboratory
Reproducibility study, along with the MAF range, mean, SD, and CV are presented in
Appendix D. A total of 337 SNVs and 137 indels (22 insertions, 115 deletions) are

d) Analysis of Source of Variance
Average Positive Agreement (APA) and Average Negative Agreement (ANA) was
assessed to analyze the imprecision caused by different sources of variance across all 3
sites. Data analysis is presented stratified by variant type and presented for 1) overall, 2)
site to site, 3) operator to operator, 4) day to day, and 5) within-run concordance.
TMB was assessed using %CV of the TMB score across test sample replicates for samples
with a reference TMB above LoB (7.2 Muts/Mb). The results are shown in (Table 10).

Independently ERBB2 amplification and ALK, NTRK2 and NTRK3, RET translocations
were evaluated (one specimen each) and analyzed by ANA and APA. The overall APA for
these variants was 97.7% and ANA was 99.9%. For BRCA1 deleterious variants, the APA
was 11.8% because 3 replicates from a single case showed detection of a mutation not
present in the other replicates. The MAF values for these 3 observations were 1.2%, 0.9%,
and 0.8%, respectively (data not shown).
e) Precision for MSI:
Precision of MSI was evaluated across 8 MSS and 6 MSI-H samples with a range of MSI
scores. The mean MSI score, MSI range, SD and % CV for the score along with positive
call rates are provided for results with 36 replicates obtained in the 3-site reproducibility
study. The results demonstrate that precision of MSI values is supported by the PGDx elio
tissue complete. Data is shown in Table 11.

f) Precision for Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB):
Precision of TMB was evaluated across 11 samples (with TMB scores near the analytical
borderline value of TMB LoB of 7.2 Muts/Mb) in the 3-site reproducibility site. The
distribution of replicates by site, operator, and day is across site, operator, and day per
samples and score are provided in Figure 5 (Figure 5 shows the distribution of replicates
per site and operator for each of representative specimens by TMB score and test day).
The data demonstrates high precision for TMB scores.
.
Figure 5: TMB Performance in the Interlaboratory Reproducibility Study by
Site, Operator, and Day.
g) Precision – cell lines:
Prior to performing the 3-site reproducibility study with clinical specimens, a study
with DNA extracted from 6 blended cell line samples and a single colorectal FFPE
sample that was MSI-H were evaluated. Together these samples represented a
variety of DNA alterations, including over 600 unique alterations across a range of
mutant allele fractions (MAFs). Each of the 7 samples was tested in duplicate by 2
different operators on 6 distinct sequencing runs at each of the 3 independent
laboratory sites using a single kit lot. The positive call rate observed for the distinct
variant types was consistent with the data observed with the clinical specimens
(Table 12) though the cell line data had a larger number of variants with low MAFs
K192063 - Page 24 of 108

--- Page 25 ---
due to a dilution effect. Cell lines were blended at low concentrations reducing the
MAF of insertions below thresholds and left only 20 total insertions (and only 3 at
≥15% MAF) for assessment.

h) Lot-to-lot Precision
Performance of PGDx elio tissue complete was assessed across 3 unique kit lots by
determining concordance of variant calls in FFPE tissue samples. The 3 unique kit
lots were utilized to process 5 test cases in triplicate for a total of 45 observations.
All batches were sequenced on the same instrument. Table 13 lists the Average
Positive Agreement (APA) and Average Negative Agreement (ANA) used to assess
lot to lot performance. APA for all variants is > 86%, and %CV for TMB analyses is
< 10%. The performance is consistent with that of the reproducibility study.

3. Analytical Sensitivity - Limit of Detection (LoD):
The recommended DNA input for PGDx elio tissue complete is 100 ng of total DNA
with a minimum 20% tumor purity. The LoD of the PGDx elio tissue complete assay is
defined as the mutant allele fraction (MAF) at which 95% of replicates for a variant type
are reliably detected. The LoD study was comprised of two steps: LoD establishment
using cell lines and LoD confirmation with 10 FFPE clinical tumor samples from clinical
cases across a diverse set of cancers (4 SNVs, 4 insertions and 4 deletions). Select
specimens were used to evaluate specific mutations with evidence of clinical
significance. Specimens were selected for allele frequencies near the claimed cut-offs.
Details of the data are discussed and shown below.
a) LoD - SNVs, Insertions, and Deletions:
b)
Target levels for detection were first established in a dilution series from cell lines with up to
5 target MAF levels. The analytical sensitivity and LOD95 was then confirmed in clinical
FFPE specimens. Data was aggregated across 2 reagent kit lots when possible, otherwise the
lot with the higher MAF was used. Cell lines were used to establish the LoD MAF range for
451 SNVs and 31 indels across the panel. A total of 150 observations were generated (3
samples with 10 replicates at 5 dilution levels). Positive call status and MAF was evaluated
for select variants identified in 10 FFPE clinical specimens diluted with normal DNA derived
from FFPE tissue. Each specimen was processed with 2 kit lots of PGDx elio tissue complete
across 10 replicates for a total of 200 observations (Table 14). The established analytical
sensitivity ranges were confirmed at ≥ 95% call rate with FFPE clinical cases on a per variant
level (Table 14) and using all somatic variants identified in FFPE clinical cases representing
a range of MAFs for hotspot and non-hotspot positions (Table 15). A summary of the LoD
mean mutant allele frequency and range as well as the positive call rate are displayed for
each variant type by variant type for the entire panel across all replicates is shown in the
Table 25 below. A range of 5.9-12.6% MAF was observed using the lowest average MAF
where the positive call rates was ≥ 95%. The observed sequencing depth (DP), allele depth
(AD), mutation allele frequency (MAF) range and average MAF are included.

Additional evaluations of analytical sensitivity performance used dilution series of
FFPE clinical specimens. The positive call rates, sequence coverage, and mutant
allele fraction are provided for a total of 11 SNVs, 3 insertions, and 5 deletions from
5 clinical FFPE specimens with 5 replicates per dilution level. A range of 5.9-12.6%
MAF was observed using the lowest average MAF where the positive call rates was
≥ 95%. (Table 16 - Table 34).
An in-depth variant analysis of cell-line samples from LoD establishment studies
were assessed to further demonstrate analytical sensitivity. The positive call rates,
sequence coverage (DP), allele depth (AD), and mutant allele fraction (MAF) are
provided for a total of 13 SNVs, 4 insertions, and 4 deletions from a cell-line based
dilution series of 3 samples with 10 replicates at 5 dilution levels (Table 35-Table
55).

c) LoD - MSI, Translocations, and Amplifications (Tumor Purity)
Analytical sensitivity of ERBB2, ALK, RET, NTRK3, and MSI was confirmed by testing
7 clinical FFPE cases (NSCLC, breast and CRC) diluted with normal FFPE DNA to
achieve targeted detection levels (variants at low tumor purity). Each unique case was
confirmed at ≥ 95% call rate at 1 tumor purity level, with 10 replicates per kit lot, across
2 unique lots for translocations and amplifications. For MSI-H, 3 FFPE clinical
specimen cases were confirmed at 1 tumor purity level with 10 replicates each. Analytical
sensitivity for specific translocations, amplifications, and MSI-H are summarized in
Table 56.

1The enrolled ALK case was evaluated with only 17 total replicates due
to insufficient DNA quantity.
i. ALK:
The ALK Limit of Detection Clinical Confirmation study was examined to
determine the number of fusion reads observed by PGDx elio tissue complete in
these samples. Call rates of 100% across 2 lots were observed in dilutions with
5.6% tumor content with decreasing call rates at lower levels, 3.2% and 1%

ii. Microsatellite Instability (MSI):
Three (3) additional, independent FFPE cases were used to confirm the LoD with
respect to tumor purity for MSI, two of these cases were CRC and one was
endometrial cancer. These 3 independent FFPE cases were used in the
confirmation of LoD with 10 replicates per kit lot across 2 lots for a total of 60
observations (20 per sample). (Figure 6 shows three boxplots; the boxplots
represent different tumor proportions relative to a red line that is a presumptive
cut off for MSI-H. The boxplots show the distribution of replicate results.) The
FFPE clinical case used for the establishment of LoD was CRC.

Figure 6. Combined MSI score across three LOD confirmation cases
with 20 replicates each. TP = tumor purity.
These data were used to confirm a tumor purity LoD for MSI of 18%, which is above the
recommended tumor purity input for PGDx elio tissue complete. As shown in the graphs
above, the precision of MSI calling near the LoD of the assay is robust across the range
of MSI scores. The data demonstrated that the MSI-H result was maintained at
approximately 20% tumor purity.
d) LoD – Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) and DNA input
The minimum tumor purity requirement for input into PGDx elio tissue complete is
20%. The minimum tumor purity required for robust reporting of TMB scores by PGDx
elio tissue complete was confirmed using 8 clinical FFPE cases. Samples 1-5 were
serially diluted across 3 levels with 5 replicates per level and 1 level with 3 replicates
(18 total), sample 6 was serially diluted across 5 levels at 10 replicates per level (50
total), and samples 7-8 were serially diluted across 5 levels with 5 replicates per level
(25 total with 10 ≥15% tumor purity). The total number of replicates per sample and the
%CV of all replicates with ≥ 15% tumor purity are shown below in Table 58. Together
these data show PGDx elio tissue complete has consistent TMB performance across
tumor purities at or above 15%. The claim for TMB score is 20% tumor purity (Figure
7; the figure shows 8 lines representative of 8 samples across multiple tumor purities and
the expected consistency in scores as a function of tumor purity).

a) Traceability:
The PGDx elio tissue complete assay is not traceable to any known standard.
Controls and quality metrics are described in the device description section.

--- Page 40 ---
b) Stability/Shelf life:
Product expiration dating is based on testing at multiple time points with
specimens representative of variant types with 3 lots of the PGDx elio tissue
complete assay reagent kit. The current shelf life for the PGDx elio tissue complete
assay reagent kit is 6 months when stored according to the temperatures indicated
on the label.
PGDx elio tissue complete can be used commercially for up to 4 freeze/thaw cycles.
c) Transport Conditions:
PGDx elio tissue complete kits are shipped using an insulated container with dry
ice (all -80 °C and -20 °C reagents) and a Controlled Room Temperature container
(with predetermined configuration of gel (cold and/or frozen) packs, meant for 4
°C and room temperature reagents) to maintain the product for up to 72 hours
when stored at ambient
temperature.
d) Expected values (controls, calibrators or methods)
An external control that is provided in the PGDx elio tissue complete assay reagent
kit consists of cell line derived-DNA with multiple verified sequence mutations.
The external control is processed from library preparation through sequencing to
serve as an end to end control to demonstrate assay performance. The external
control is checked for quality during library preparation and after sequencing.
Failure of the external control to meet the pre-defined quality metrics will result in
all test samples on the run being reported as “No result.” In addition, several quality
metrics are established as thresholds for reporting results to provide for high
confidence data.
6. Analytical Specificity:
a) Cut-off/False positive rate (Limit of Blank in DNA NGS)
Non-cancerous FFPE tissues and reference materials were evaluated for analytical
specificity to assessed risk of false positives in normal tissues when detecting
SNVs, indels, translocations, amplifications, MSI and TMB using PGDx elio tissue
complete.
i. Reference standards: Two reference standards from National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST), NA24531 and NA24385 were evaluated
by PGDx elio tissue complete for variants reported. Specificity was
observed at 100% with no unverified mutations reported across 5 replicates
for each standard. Four (4) sequence mutations previously characterized in
the standards were also reported by PGDx elio tissue complete and
determined to be germline mutations that are of rare prevalence in the
general population.
ii. FFPE Clinical Specimens – 100ng input: Analytical specificity of SNVs,
indels, RET, ALK, NTRK translocations, ERBB2 amplifications, MSI and
K192063 - Page 40 of 108

--- Page 41 ---
TMB was further assessed with non-cancerous FFPE tissues. Unique test
cases from 34 normal FFPE samples were processed with the recommended
100 ng DNA input across 2 different lots of the PGDx elio tissue complete
assay kit. For Variants with Evidence of Clinical Significance, the rate of
false positives is < 0.1% while the false positive rate for hotspot SNVs is <
3.2% (n=2/63). For MSI-H (qualitative call), the false positive rate was 0 (n
= 26). For TMB, the false positive rate (defined as scores >7.3 Muts/Mb was
4.8%.
iii. FFPE Clinical Specimens – 50ng input: In addition to the assessment at the
recommended DNA input of 100 ng, test cases from normal FFPE tissue
types were prepared to assess specificity of the assay at 50 ng DNA input.
For Variants with Evidence of Clinical Significance, the rate of false
positives is < 0.1% while the false positive rate for hotspot SNVs is < 3.8%
(n=1/26). For MSI-H (qualitative call), the false positive rate is < 1.6%. For
TMB, the false positive rate (defined as scores >7.2 Muts/Mb was 11.5%
(3/26).
b) Index Cross-Contamination
To demonstrate the ability of PGDx elio tissue complete in detection of
contaminating samples, this study assessed whether samples artificially mixed in
silico to a known degree were detected as contaminated. Five FFPE clinical samples
of each African, East Asian, and European genetic ancestry (15 FFPE samples total)
that had been previously sequenced and shown not to be contaminated were used. In
silico, the data from these 5 samples from each ancestry group were mixed with all
others of the same ancestry and 1 sample from both other ancestries. According to
the results, this device will not detect all instances of contamination when both
sample and contaminant are from individuals of Asian ancestry. A limitation in the
package insert was established to caution that care should be taken to avoid cross-
contamination of such samples.
c) Necrotic Tissue
The impact of necrosis on the performance of PGDx elio tissue complete was
evaluated by assessing the first pass and overall pass rates (after one repeat test) of
samples processed in the accuracy study (see Clinical Performance section below).
Of 521 samples enrolled for accuracy, 448 were evaluated for necrosis over a range
of 0-75%. The data indicated there is no correlation between necrosis and pass/fail
rate.
d) Interfering Substances
The impact of interfering substances on the performance of the PGDx elio tissue
complete assay was assessed by processing DNA from FPPE samples tested in the
presence of each interfering substance at varying amounts (Table 59). The samples
were evaluated for concordance of variant calls when compared to samples
processed without the interfering substances. Replicates for 5 test cases were
analyzed for 8 experimental and 2 baseline conditions. Performance was evaluated
across 5 samples X 10 conditions X 15 replicates using multiple operators and
K192063 - Page 41 of 108

instruments. Samples were selected to be near the LoD. Analysis of all variant types
tested (SNVs, indels, translocations, amplifications and MSI) showed no effect of
exogenous interferent for all conditions: PPA (≥ 97.2%) and NPA (≥ 99.9%) (Table
60). The TMB mean absolute percent error (MAPE) ranged from 0% to 6.0% across
conditions (Table 61). The results show minimal risk to assay performance from
interfering substances.

e) Sample Carryover and Cross-Contamination:
Cross-contamination (contamination from one sample to another within the same
batch) and sample carryover (contamination from a previous sequencing run when
using the same instrument) were assessed by evaluating false positive and false
negative variant calls in 29 FFPE samples. Seven (7) of the 29 cases had known
positive variants, the remaining samples were known negative samples. All FFPE
samples were assessed across 2 batches to test for contamination within and
between runs. In batch 1, a checkerboard pattern within a 96-well plate was created
by alternating the samples with representative positive variants and known negative
samples. Batch 2 contained known negative samples and was pooled and sequenced
directly after completion of batch 1 sequencing, following standard instrument
cleaning procedures. No positive variant results were observed in known negative
samples tested. Sample carryover and cross-contamination were not observed in any
of the conditions evaluated.
7. Robustness Studies
a) Sample Stability:
DNA stability was assessed for extracted DNA stored at ≤ -20 °C prior to
processing through PGDx elio tissue complete. A total of 45 unique clinical
samples from 11 different tissue types were tested. The duration of DNA storage at
the time of the evaluation in this study ranged from 97 to 377 days, with a median
of 330 days (~10.6 months) and a mean of 295 days (~9.5 months).
Samples were sequenced at the time of initial extraction to determine a reference
status of the variants, which was labeled as T0. PGDx elio tissue complete
demonstrated robust analytical performance and concordant results for all variants
assessed (MSI, amplifications, translocations, and sequence mutations) using DNA
specimens stored for various times. Performance was maintained across all of the
DNA storage times with PPA ≥ 93.2% and NPA > 99.9% (Table 62).

b) DNA Extraction
PGDx elio tissue complete may be used with an appropriate commercially
available DNA extraction method. Three DNA extraction methods were evaluated.
Three commonly used, commercially available DNA extraction kits included a
column-based extraction method and a bead-based extraction method. DNA
extraction method concordance was evaluated in 2 studies, including 1 cell line

and 10 FFPE solid tumor tissue samples selected to contain all variant types
assessed by PGDx elio tissue complete, including borderline variants near the
LoD. Each of the samples were extracted in duplicate by 2 operators for each of
the 3 DNA extraction kits. The 48 DNA samples were processed with PGDx elio
tissue complete in duplicate resulting in 96 total sequencing reactions (4 samples x
2 extractions x 2 operators x 3 extraction methods x 2 assay replicates). Method 2
(bead-based) and Method 3 (automated) were compared to the reference Method 1
(column-based). The overall pass rate for FFPE samples was 93.1% (67/72).
PGDx elio tissue complete yielded concordant analytical performance for variant
calls across the DNA extraction methods positive percent agreement (PPA) was
>97% negative percent agreement (NPA) was >99.9% between methods. The
TMB CV for all assessed cases was <12.5%. These data demonstrate that an
appropriate commercially available FFPE DNA extraction method may be used to
extract DNA for the PGDx elio tissue complete assay.
c) DNA Input
The optimal and recommended amount of input DNA for the assay is 100 ng.
Minimum (50 ng) and recommended (100 ng) DNA input requirements were
established by measuring assay performance with different inputs from FFPE tumor
tissues (25-200 ng). To evaluate assay performance across a range of DNA inputs, 4
unique FFPE samples with known variants were prepared in triplicate at 10, 25, 50,
100 and 200 ng DNA input levels. The 4 FFPE cases assessed contained
representative SNVs, indels, amplifications, translocations, MSI and TMB. The first
pass acceptability rate for PGDx elio tissue complete was 100% across all DNA
inputs for all DNA inputs except 10ng DNA which was 75% (9/12). After repeat
testing, all 12 specimens yielded results.
The variant calls for these samples were compared to the respective reference DNA
input of 100 ng for each case to assess concordance. Table 63 describes PPA and
NPA for each input level where aggregated variants were analyzed, including
SNVs, indels, amplifications, translocations, and MSI. For TMB, the mean absolute
percent error rate at each DNA input level was compared to 100 ng (Table 64).
These data indicate the assay is robust around the recommended 100 ng DNA input.

8. Comparison Studies:
a) Method Comparison (Accuracy)
The analytical accuracy of PGDx elio tissue complete as a tumor profiling device was
evaluated using 582 clinical FFPE samples, obtained from patients with a variety of
tumor types (n=35). Due to the rarity of specific genetic variants in solid tumor FFPE
samples, most samples selected for this study were pre-screened, resulting in an
enrichment of certain variants relative to real-world clinical prevalence. Data was
aggregated at the variant level for SNVs and indels, gene level for amplifications and
translocations, and case level for MSI and TMB. Out of 521 FFPE tumor specimens,
455 had both predicate and PGDx elio tissue complete results, over 35 tumor types,
with 763 unique true positive variants observed in 578 exons over 272 genes. Among
those variants, there were 620 SNVs, 44 insertions and 99 deletions.
Accuracy is summarized for the entire cohort of 582 samples for each of the assessed
variants types (SNVs, indels, MSI, TMB, and structural variants). The Orthogonal

Method consisted of validated NGS and PCR methods. For the translocations,
amplification, and sequence mutation results, PPV and NPV were first calculated for
each variant for which PGDx elio results were known before the orthogonal results.
Additionally, PPA/NPA were calculated by adjusting for the proportion of variant
positive samples by test device. (Table 65)

1 MSI accuracy was assessed in 18 tumor types: ampulla (1), bladder (7), breast (21), colorectal (66),
endometrial (18), esophagus (1), fallopian tube (1), gall bladder (1), gastric (40), lung (39), kidney (3),
omentum (1), ovarian (2), prostate (4), sarcoma (3), skin (8), thyroid (2), and cancer of unknown
primary (5).
2 An EGFR T790M mutation reported by PGDx elio tissue complete was not confirmed by PCR. A
third orthogonal method (ddPCR) confirmed the presence of this EGFR T790M mutation at 2.1%
MAF.
4 Borderlines are defined by a HER2/CEP17 ratio between 1.5 and 2.5 by FISH.
5 No read data supporting RET translocations was found in the raw data for the discrepant cases. In
addition to the clinical samples processed to assess RET translocations, 3 RET translocation-positive
cell lines were also tested with PGDx elio tissue complete. All 3 cell lines were positive for a fusion
either by a validated assay performed by the cell line provider, or via literature. PGDx elio tissue
complete detected all 3 fusions in these cell lines.
i. Accuracy – SNVs
The PGDx elio tissue complete accuracy study included 923 unique SNVs from 307
genes with 84 unique insertions from 60 genes with 159 unique deletions from 101
genes. Performance was stratified by mutation type and gene for positive percent
agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) with 95% confidence interval
(CI). Results are shown fin tables below. Orthogonal data was derived from 2
competitor NGS panels from which the complete sequencing ROI was not available.
Additionally, differences in sensitivity were not accounted for in this data set.
Differences not due to low allelic fraction were limited to variants of unknown
significance and are expected based on differences in filtering employed by PGDx elio
tissue complete and comparator methods. Therefore, agreement may be
underrepresented.

Following tables show the results of accuracy study by gene: the percent positive
agreement for SNVs by gene, and the percent positive agreement for insertions and
deletions by gene. Since the orthogonal data was tested prior to knowing the PGDx elio
tissue complete results, the PPA could be calculated. The complete listing of Data in in
Appendix E (1-3).
ii. Accuracy –Concordance to FISH for ERBB2 amplification:
In total 147 different tumor tissues representing 20 different tumors types of which 70
breast and 29 gastric cancer cases) were analyzed for concordance between FISH status
and PGDx elio tissue complete ERBB2 status. The ability of the assay to detect ERBB2
amplifications was assessed in 2 studies: the first study contained the expected prevalence
of FISH borderline samples and the second study enriched the population for ERBB2
borderline cases. The PPA and NPA values for ERBB2 amplification reflect the totals
across both studies and is an over representation of borderline cases. The data shows
high concordance in the non-borderline cases (excluding all cases of FISH ratio 1.5-2.5),
with PPA of 87%, and NPA, PPV and NPV at or above 92% (Table 66).
The PGDx elio tissue complete reported the majority of borderline positive fish tests as
negative. The PGDx elio tissue complete threshold for reporting an ERBB2 positive
result is 2.5-fold change. Consequently, the data presented in this table show that the 2.0
to 2.5 positive borderline range had reduced agreement. This 2.5-fold threshold was
established during feasibility to ensure 100% specificity (no false positives). Therefore,
ca se s that fa ll into the FI SH pos itive bor derli ne range w ith FI SH ratios o f 2.0-2.5 are
generally not reported by the PGDx elio tissue complete assay due to the assay’s 2.5-fold
change threshold for reporting an amplified ERBB2 status. Specifics of the borderline
performance are shown in Table 66. The estimate of frequency of ERBB2 amplification
wit h an E RBB2/Chromoso me 17 FISH ratio o f 2-2.5 is estimated t o be 2.2%. Although
the test is not authorized for companion diagnostic testing and a statement in the
instructions for use cautions that testing with an FDA-approved companion diagnostic
should be performed to assess patients for therapy selection.

iii. Accuracy – Concordance to FISH for RET:
RET translocations were compared to a commercial RET Break Apart FISH probe Kit.
Following table presents results for RET translocation concordance without regard to
sample selection from either orthogonal method or test device for RET translocations. The
calculations are not adjusted for the specimens that were first determined to be positive by
the FISH assay. Seven (7) of the specimens deemed positive by the PGDx were 100%
positive with the orthogonal comparator. For the twenty (20) specimens for which the
orthogonal information was known for these samples prior to running them through the
PGDx elio tissue complete assay, the PGDx had four false negatives (Table 68).

iv. Accuracy – Concordance to FISH for ALK Translocation:
The ability of the PGDx elio tissue complete assay to detect ALK was evaluated using 71
specimens (14 FISH positive and 57 FISH negative). The results demonstrated high
concordance to FISH (Tables 60 and 70).
ALK borderline performance in FFPE specimens as demonstrated from Limit of
Detection:
The lowest % nuclei scored specimen was 50% and lacked specimens at the borderline
equivocal zone (15%). ALK FISH borderline samples at the cut-off of 15% cells positive
are rare, with expected prevalence of 1% or less. Since PGDx was unable to obtain
clinical FFPE samples in the ALK FISH equivocal zone, consideration was given for
performance with ALK borderline using two two sets of data: assessment of performance
with low tumor proportions (refer to data in Analytical sensitivity section) and a
supplemental in silico study was performed that assessed analytical accuracy for ALK at
decreased positive FISH signal. This study used the sequencing data from ALK positive
clinical FFPE specimens that were diluted bioinformatically in order to assess the

expected positive call rate at varying FISH levels. ALK translocations were assessed in
silico due to limited availability of clinical cases close to the ALK FISH equivocal zone
(10%-50% rearrangement positive nuclei). A total of 410 observations were generated for
ALK by downsampling 10 clinical samples from analytical accuracy to 4 tumor purity
dilution levels with 10 replicates per level, to mimic samples in the FISH equivocal zone.
For example, if the undiluted sample had a FISH score of 50% from analytical accuracy,
the sample was diluted with wild type reads by a factor of 0.8 to get to a 40% positive
nuclei FISH score. These data demonstrate an LoD of 30% positive nuclei by FISH,
when identifying the lowest level with a ≥95% positive call rate (Table 71). The FISH
level, average positive call rate, in addition to the range of call rates across all cases per
level, and the range of fusion reads across all replicates per level is provided Table 91
below. These data demonstrate an 88% positive call rate at 20% positive nuclei by FISH

v. Method Comparison Study for Wild-Type Calls
A study was conducted to assess accuracy for 75 selected hotspots within 20 genes. The
selected hotspot variants included mutations that were coding hotspot mutations
(missense or frameshift). A total of 112 specimens were tested, and the accuracy of
PGDx elio tissue complete results at all 75 positions was compared to results obtained
with two orthogonal methods (42 samples using 1 method, and 70 using a second
method). Within the 112 specimens, there were 112 mutations across samples and 8,283
wild-type calls. Overall variant-level concordance (PPA and NPA) was 96.4% and 99.9%
respectively with two-sided 95% confidence intervals of (91.1%, 99.0%) for mutations
(PPA), and (99.9%, 99.9%) for wild-type locations (NPA). Table 72 shows summarized
results for these hotspot variants.

vi. TMB Accuracy
The PGDx elio tissue complete assay reports a TMB score comprised of sequence
mutations detected across the entire coding region of interest per sample. The ability of
PGDx elio tissue complete to accurately identify TMB in multiple solid tissue FFPE
tumor types was assessed by comparing to matched tumor-normal whole exome
sequencing results. Across 8 tumor types (non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)),
melanoma, renal, bladder, endometrial, triple negative breast, head and neck, lung-NOS
(not otherwise specified), 118 cases were enrolled covering a dynamic range of 1.5-118.5
Muts/Mb. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship
between the 2 assays. Assessment of all 118 cases resulted in a Spearman correlation
coefficient of 0.903. The results in Figure 8 show concordance between PGDx elio tissue
complete TMB scores and tumor-normal whole exome sequencing.

Figure 8. PGDx elio tissue complete TMB score vs. Matched Tumor-Normal
Exome Sequencing.
Below is the calculated PPA for sequence mutations, broken down by insertions vs.
deletions as well as by indel length. Differences in calls were detected at a higher
proportion amongst deletions, however, the overall proportion of deletions to all
mutations in the mutation load is relatively minor compared to the contribution of the
SNVs in the mutation load.
vii. Accuracy – MSI
The accuracy of PGDX elio tissue test calling of MSI status in tumor tissue was
evaluated in a method comparison study against a validated PCR based MSI test. This
study evaluated 115 cases of which 66 cases were of colorectal cancer (CRC), 18 of
endometrial cancer (EC) and 21 non-CRC/EC cases. An additional 168 non-CRC/non-
EC cases were tested in a supplemental study to ascertain accuracy of MSI calls in range
of tumor types. All samples were randomized, and study participants blinded to MSI
status from orthogonal test results for these cases. Of the 283 samples tested 54 samples
failed to produce results with the PGDx elio Tissue test of which 10 also failed to
produce a result with the PCR test. Of specimens that produced a result with both PGDx
elio Tissue and MIS PCR test, the PPA is 98.8% (79/80) with 95% CI 93.3%-99.8% for
MSI-H status and NPA 99.3% (142/143) with 95% CI 96.1%-99.9% for MSS status.
When including specimens with failed and indeterminate test results the PPA is 94.0%
(79/84) with 95% CI 86.8%-97.4% for MSI-H status and NPA is 77.6% (142/183) with
95% CI 71.0%-83.0% for MSS status. Study Results are summarized below in Table 73.

The accuracy of PGDx elio Tissue test evaluable samples by tumor types with high MSI
prevalence (CRC, EC and Gastric cancer) and aggregate of other tumors types is
summarized in Tables 74, 75 and 76 below. PPV/ NPV values in the following tables do
not account for prevalence, they are purely technical / analytically calculated values to
account for concordance conditional on the PGDx elio result or conditional on the

viii. Accuracy - Other: The effect of GC content and exon length were explored on
coverage for the assay. It was determined that ff the 7026 total exons in PGDx elio
tissue complete, there are 59 challenging exons demonstrating ≤100x coverage in
30% of samples or greater from Analytical Accuracy. The exons that tend to be
shorter in length such that short exons with low GC content are the most vulnerable
to reduced coverage. Overall the the Pass rate for specimens was assessed for the
PGDx elio tissue complete and determined to be similar to the pass rate observed

5. Calibration & Quality Controls:
PGDx uses DiversiPhi to qualify the instrument and monitor instrument performance. The
instrument and assay employ both in-process QC Checks and physical controls. See
description in traceability section for calibrator value assignments.
PGDx elio tissue complete requires 90% of exons with sequence coverage >100x for
reporting of sequence alterations in a sample, otherwise the sample is marked
failed. The device uses automated QC metrics that align to the following
categories:
1) “Batch-level” = metrics quantified per sequencing run; failing batch-level metrics
generates “No result” reports samples failing these criteria. If the external control
fails these criteria, “No result” is reported for the entire batch of samples.
2) “Sample-level” = metrics quantified per sample; generates “No result” report for
that sample failing QC.
3) “Analyte-level” = metrics quantified on an analyte (variant) call-level, whereby
multiple different passing statuses can exist within the same sample. All samples
receive reports for all variants passing analyte-level QC.
When a report is generated, all metrics are assessed dynamically on a per-sample
basis.

S. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
Instrument concordance: A study was performed to demonstrate agreement between
NExtSeq 550 Dx instruments and NextSeq 550 Dx reagents and instruments and
reagents qualified by PGDx. PPA and NPA were assessed for each variant out put
(SNVs, indels, translocations, amplifications, MSI and TMB). The study demonstrated
no discordance attributable to instrument or reagent.
diversiPhi validation: Studies were conducted to validate the analytical performance of
the PGDx elio tissue complete using PGDx elio diversiPhi to fill partial sequencing run
batches. Testing was conducted by 1 operator on a total of 4 different NextSeq
instruments, using 1 lot of PGDx elio tissue complete kit and 1 lot of PGDx elio
diversiPhi. Two unique blends were assessed across 3 prospective batches containing
diversiPhi to reprent different lane ratios sequenced: 6.25% (14 samples + 1 external
control), 50% (7 samples plus one external control) and 87.5% (1 sample + external
control). These runs were then compared back to the reference data whichincluded 0.0%
diversiPhi (15 samples + 1 EC). The data demonstrated that diversiPhi could be used to
fill partial sequencing batches based on observation that the overall concordance
consistent with the analytical validation data.
Database: As a distributed kit, the software includes database information regarding the
variants and their assignment to either Variants with Evidence of Clinical Significance
or Variants with Potential Clinical Significance. A description of the assignment and
curation process was provided. Report Generation in PGDx Elio Tissue Complete:
The PGDx elio tissue complete software generates reports for each sequencing run and
sample processed. The software does not include annotation regarding the individual
variants. The report includes tumor type, allele frequency, and functional information.
There are three reported outputs, 1) Case Report, 2) Complete Case Record (CCR), and
3) Complete Run Record (CRR).
The Case Report is the primary report of identified alterations for a sample. The Case
Report divides variants into 2 sections: ‘Variants with Evidence of Clinical
Significance’ on page 1 only and ‘Variants with Potential Clinical Significance’ on
subsequent pages. The variants listed in the section ‘Variants with Evidence of Clinical
Significance’ are determined based on the selected tumor type. Only variants clinically
associated with the selected tumor type will appear on page 1 of the Case Report in the
‘Variants with Evidence of Clinical Significance’ section. Any remaining variants will
appear in the ‘Variants with Potential Clinical Significance’ section starting on the
second page. A qualified healthcare professional
selects the appropriate tumor type to ensure the corresponding variants of clinical
significance appear on page 1. Any variants clinically associated with tumor types other
than the one selected will be reported in the section labeled 'Variants with Potential
Clinical Significance' and will appear on page 2 and subsequent pages.

VIII. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as
applicable, and the special controls for this device type.
IX. Patient Perspectives
This submission did not include specific information on patient perspectives for this device.
X. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this 510(k) notification supports the Indications For Use for
elioTissue Complete and demonstrates that the elio Tissue Complete assay is as safe and
effective as the predicate device and therefore supports a substantial equivalence conclusion.
