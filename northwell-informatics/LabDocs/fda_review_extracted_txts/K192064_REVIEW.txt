III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The DiaSorin LIAISON® Vitamin B12 assay uses chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA)
technology for the quantitative determination of Vitamin B12 in human serum, SST serum and
lithium heparin plasma. Measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis and
treatment of anemia’s of gastrointestinal malabsorption. Assay results should be used in
conjunction with other clinical or laboratory data to assist the clinician in making individual
patient management decisions.
The assay must be performed on the LIAISON® XL Analyzer.

and preservatives; 2.4 mL

K192064 - Page 2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
• Assay Buffer 3 – Potassium phosphate with dicyanocobinimide, surfactant and
preservatives; 22 mL
B Principle of Operation:
The LIAISON® Vitamin B12 assay is a competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA)
for quantitative determination of Vitamin B12 in serum, SST serum and lithium heparin plasma.
During the first incubation, Vitamin B12 is dissociated from its binding protein. After the initial
incubation of 10.5 minutes, Vitamin B12 binds to an intrinsic factor on the solid phase. After a
second incubation of 10.5 minutes, a Vitamin B12 linked to an isoluminol derivative is added to
compete with the Vitamin B12 in the sample. After a third incubation of 5.25 minutes, the
unbound material is removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently, the starter reagents are added to
initiate a flash chemiluminescent reaction. The light signal is measured by a photomultiplier as
relative light units (RLU) and is inversely proportional to the concentration of Vitamin B12
present in samples.

2. Linearity:
One sample of each specimen type (serum, SST serum, lithium heparin
plasma) containing endogenous and/or spiked Vitamin B12 above the measuring range of the
assay at 1500 pg/mL was diluted with a low-level sample to create 13 evenly distributed
concentrations spanning the measuring range (< 50 - >1500 pg/mL). Each sample was tested
in duplicate following CLSI EP06-A guideline. The results for each sample were analyzed
by regression of observed concentration (y) versus expected concentration (x). The
regression results are summarized below for each sample type:
Serum: y = 1.076x + 6.896; R = 0.998
SST Serum: y = 1.009x + 0.224; R = 0.999
Lithium Heparin plasma: y = 1.029x – 0.095; R = 0.996
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference testing was conducted following CLSI-EP07-A2 guideline. Potential interfering
substances were spiked to serum samples with normal and high level of Vitamin B12 (200
and 800 pg/mL). The same samples without interferent but containing the “vehicle” were
tested as controls. Interference was defined as more than 10% difference between the spiked
and the un-spiked samples.
The substances and the highest concentrations tested without interference are summarized in
the below table:

Under the limitations of the procedure in the labeling, the sponsor listed the substances that
are known to interfere with the assay:
• Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with reagent immunoglobulins or
other reagent material, interfering with in vitro immunoassays.
• Patients routinely exposed to animals, animal serum products, or other immunogenic
products that may elicit heterophilic antibody production against the assay’s reagents
can be prone to this interference and anomalous values may be observed.
• Approximately 50% of patients with pernicious anemia have Intrinsic factor
antibodies. During the reaction, the denaturation should inactivate intrinsic factor
blocking antibodies. However, any remaining anti-intrinsic factor antibody or
extremely high titer of the intrinsic factor antibody could cause erroneous results.
Cross-reactivity
Cross-reactivity was evaluated following CLSI-EP07-A2 guideline. The % cross reactivity is
calculated as follows:
% cross reactivity = (Corrected Assay Value/ Cross-reactant Concentration) * 100.
The result is summarized in the below table.
Cross-Reactant Spiked Concentration % Cross Reactivity
Dicyanocobinamide 10,000pg/mL -0.19%
4. Assay Reportable Range:
55-1500 pg/mL
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
The LIAISON® Vitamin B12 Calibrators are traceable to an in-house standard preparation of
Vitamin B12 (pg/mL).
6. Detection Limit:
FTo determine the limit of blank (LoB), five blank samples were tested using 2 lots of
reagent on 1 analyzer by two operators. Each sample was run in 2 replicates /run for 6 runs
on three days yielding 60 results per reagent lot.

LoB was calculated as: LoB = μ (Blank) + 1.653 * σ (Blank)
FThe limit of detection (LoD), was determined by testing four samples in the range of
approximately 25 to 100 pg/mL on 2 analyzers using two reagent lot by two operators. Each
sample was tested in 2 replicates per run for over 6 runs over 3 days (yielding a minimum of
96 results).
LoD was calculated for each lot as: LoD = LoB + 1.655 * σs (Low Sample)
For limit of quantitation (LoQ), eight samples (4 of which were used in the LoD determination)
in the range of 25 to approximately 250 pg/mL were tested using 2 reagent lots on 2 analyzers
by 2 operators. Each sample was tested in 2 replicates per run for 6 runs over 3 days, yielding
a minimum of 144 results. LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration at which the
regression line crosses the 20% CV line and was calculated for each of the reagent lots using
a curve fit best suited to the data set.
The claimed LoB, LoD and LoQ are summarized in the below table using the highest
concentration resulted from the different lots tested.

7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
method comparison study was performed using a total of 156 serum samples (147 native, 9
spiked). The samples were tested in singlicate using the candidate device and predicate
device, and the results were compared.
One sample was removed from the analysis as it was below the measuring range of the assay.
The samples ranged from 71.2 - 1315 pg/mL pg/mL.
The result of the Passing-Bablok regression analysis is summarized in the below table:
N Slope (95% CI) Intercept (95% CI) Correlation Coefficient
155 0.97 (0.94-1.00) 6.25 (-3.50-18.29) 0.985
2. Matrix Comparison:
Forty-eight (48) matched patient sets of serum, SST serum and lithium heparin plasma
samples were tested to determine if these sample types provide equivalent results on the
LIAISON® Vitamin B12 assay.
