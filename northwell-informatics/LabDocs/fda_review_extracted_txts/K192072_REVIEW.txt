2. Linearity:
Linearity of the assay was evaluated following CLSI guideline EP6-A by preparing native
unmodified high- and low-level human serum pools for the dilution series. The dilution
series resulted in 15 levels (including the high and low concentration pools). Each diluted
sample was tested in replicates of three and tested on a cobas c 501 analyzer. Regression
statistics comparing the observed results (y) to expected results (x) of all samples are
presented in the table below.

1.03−351 y=1.002x-0.0169 0.99−1.01 -0.06−0.03 0.9976 -5.2%−4%
The data summarized in the table above support linearity throughout the claimed measuring
range from 3 mg/L to 350 mg/L.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
a) Endogenous Substance Interference:
The effect of the presence of hemoglobin, triglyceride, conjugated bilirubin,
unconjugated bilirubin, albumin, immunoglobulin, and rheumatoid factor in serum
samples was evaluated by testing native unmodified serum pools at two levels with CRP
concertation between 5−10 mg/L and 35−100 mg/L spiked with varying levels of each
interferent and analyzed in triplicate in one assay run. The percent recovery for each
sample spiked with the interference substance was calculated by comparing its result to
that of the corresponding reference sample spiked with an equal volume of the solvent
without the interference substance. No interference was noted for samples containing up
to 1000 H index (hemoglobin), 1000 L index (lipemia), 60 I index (conjugated bilirubin,

unconjugated bilirubin), 60 g/L albumin, 50 g/L Immunoglobulin, and rheumatoid factor
up to 1200 IU/mL.
b) Exogenous Substance Interference:
The same protocol used in the endogenous substance interference study was used to
evaluate potentially interfering exogenous substances. No interference was noted for
samples containing N-Acetylcysteine at 1660 mg/L, Ampicillin-Na at 1000 mg/L,
Ascorbic acid at 300 mg/L, Cefoxitin at 6600 mg/L, Heparin at 5000 IU/L, Levodopa at
20 mg/L, Methyldopa + 1.5 at 22.5 mg/L, Metronidazole at 200 mg/L, Doxycyclin at 50
mg/L, Acetylsalicylic acid at 1000 mg/L, Rifampicin at 60 mg/L, Penicillamin at 24
mg/L, Phenylbutazone at 400 mg/L, Cyclosporine at 5 mg/L, Acetaminophen at
200mg/L, Ibuprofen at 500 mg/L, and Theophylline at 100 mg/L.
Ticarcillin did not show interference up to 225 mg/L; however, ticarcillin did show
significant interference from 300 mg/L−750mg/L.
c) HAMA Interference:
The effect of the presence of elevated level of Human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) in
serum samples was evaluated by testing native unmodified serum pools at two levels with
CRP concertation between 5−10 mg/L and 35−100 mg/L. Each C-reactive protein sample
was spiked with a serum sample containing HAMA. Samples were run in triplicate, on
three lots of reagent, on one cobas c 501 analyzer. The mean concentration of the three
replicates was used to calculate recovery to the known C-reactive protein concentration.
No cross reactivity was noted up to 2000 ng/mL for HAMA.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The claimed measuring range is from 3.0 mg/L to 350 mg/L.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a) Traceability:
The CRP calibrators are traceable to the reference material, ERM-DA474/IFCC.
b) Kit Stability:
Shelf-life stability: A real-time stability study were performed in accordance with CLSI
EP25-A using three lots of reagent. The study was performed at each time point with
five human serum samples and three controls. The real-time stability study supports 13
months unopened shelf-life stability for Tina-quant C-Reactive Protein IV Assay when
stored at 2–8 °C per the manufacturer’s instruction for use.
On-board stability: A real-time stability study using three lots of reagent tested at each
time point with five human serum samples and three controls. The study supports the on-
board stability claim of 12 weeks.
6. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) of the
Tina-quant CRP IV assay on the cobas c 501 were determined according to CLSI guideline
EP17-A2.
K192072 - Page 6 of 8

--- Page 7 ---
LoB was determined by testing 10 analyte free samples in singlicate per run, two runs per
day, for three days on one cobas c 501 analyzer using three lots of reagents. The LoB was
estimated as the 95th percentile of 60 measurements for each of the lots tested.
LoD was determined using five serum samples with low CRP concentrations. Each sample
was tested in duplicates per run, two runs per day, for three days on one cobas c 501 analyzer
using three lots of reagents. The LoD was determined for each lot based on 60
measurements as the lowest amount of analyte in a concentration level that can be detected
with a 95% probability.
LoQ was determined using a set of nine samples with low CRP concentrations. Each sample
was tested in replicates of five per run, one run per day, for five days with three reagent lots
on one cobas c 501 analyzer for a total of 25 data points per sample per reagent lot. The LoQ
is defined as the mean value of the sample which fulfills the specification for the total within-
laboratory imprecision <20% CV.
The claimed LoB, LoD and LoQ for the Tina-Quant are summarized in the table below:
LoB LoD LoQ
Tina-Quant CRP IV 0.2 mg/L 0.3 mg/L 3.0 mg/L
The claimed lower limit of the analytical reportable range for Tina-Quant CRP IV is set to be
3 mg/L.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A total of 110 native serum samples spanning the measuring range were tested with the Tina-
quant C-Reactive Protein IV and the predicate device, Tina-quant C-Reactive Protein Gen 3
on cobas c 501. Analytical equivalence of the test device (y) and the predicate device (x)
was evaluated using Passing/Bablok regression analysis. The results are summarized in the
following table:

(0.97–1.00) (0.18–0.40)
2. Matrix Comparison:
The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of anticoagulants with the Tina-quant C-
Reactive Protein IV assay was determined by comparing values obtained from samples
drawn into serum, serum separation gel, Li-heparin plasma, K2- and K3-EDTA plasma
primary tubes. At least 42 serum/plasma pairs per sample type were tested on one cobas c
501 analyzer. Analytical comparison between the results obtained from serum separation gel
