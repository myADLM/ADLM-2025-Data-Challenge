III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use / Indications for Use:
The Helix Genetic Health Risk App (HRA) uses qualitative genotyping to detect clinically
relevant variants in genomic DNA isolated from human saliva collected from individuals ≥18
years with Oragene Dx OGD-610 for the purpose of reporting and interpreting Genetic Health
Risks (GHR):
The Helix Genetic Health Risk App (HRA) for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease is indicated for
reporting of the e2/e2, e2/e3, e3/e3, e2/e4, e3/e4 and e4/e4 genotypes in the APOE gene. The
report describes if a person's genetic result is associated with an increased or decreased risk of
developing late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. The e2 and e4 variants included in this report are
found and have been studied in many ethnicities. Detailed risk estimates have been studied the
most in people of European descent.
The Helix Genetic Health Risk App (HRA) is to be used with the Helix Laboratory Platform.
B Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
• For over-the-counter (OTC) use.
• The customer must first opt-in to receive the late-onset Alzheimer’s disease risk report.
• The test is intended for users ≥ 18 years old.
• This test is not intended to diagnose a disease, determine medical treatment or other
medical intervention, or tell the user anything about their current state of health.
• Any diagnostic or treatment decisions must be based on confirmatory prescription testing
and/or other information that a healthcare professional determines to be appropriate for
the patient, such as additional clinical testing and other risk factors that may affect
individual risk and health care.
• This test is not a substitute for visits to a healthcare provider. It is recommended that you
consult with a healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns about your
results.
• Subject to meeting the limitations contained in the special controls under regulation
21 CFR 866.5950.
• The laboratory may not be able to process a user’s sample. The probability that the
laboratory cannot process a sample can be up to 2.5%.
• A user’s race, ethnicity, age, and sex may affect how the genetic test results are
interpreted.
• The test does not detect all genetic variants associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s
Disease (AD). The absence of a variant tested does not rule out the presence of other
genetic variants that may be disease-related.
• The test does not describe a person's overall risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease. In
addition, other genetic and all non-genetic factors should be considered.
• Third-party application developers must discuss with FDA the usability of the original
data generated on the Helix Laboratory Platform (HLP).

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The HRA is an OTC and direct-to-consumer DNA genetic testing service. The HRA for late-
onset Alzheimer’s disease reports the lifetime risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease at or above
age 65 years based on six genotypes (e2/e2, e2/e3, e2/e4, e3/e3, e3/e4 and e4/e4) of the APOE
gene combining qualitative genotyping data with descriptive information derived from peer-
reviewed published genetic research studies. A customer’s saliva is self-collected using the
Oragene Dx OGD-610 (K192920) manufactured by DNA Genotek, Inc., which consists of a
sealable collection tube containing a stabilizing buffer solution. Once the saliva sample is
collected, it is shipped to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified
and College of American Pathologists (CAP)-accredited Helix Clinical Laboratory for testing.
DNA is isolated from the saliva and tested using Helix’s proprietary whole exome sequencing
assay in the Helix clinical laboratory. The genomic DNA is processed and sequenced using next
generation sequencing (NGS) reagents and instrumentation manufactured by Illumina. The
sequencing data is analyzed using Helix’s proprietary software, where the genetic variants of
interest are determined. All samples must pass Helix’s quality control metrics prior to analysis.
Samples that do not pass quality thresholds undergo re-sequencing and/or sample re-collection.
The APOE genotypes are used to generate personalized reports for each user. These reports tell
the user which genetic variant(s) has/have been detected in their sample and provide information
on the risk of disease associated with the genetic variants. If no variant was detected, that
information is also provided. The personalized reports are designed to present scientific concepts
to users in an easy-to-understand format. The reports provide scientifically valid information
about the risks associated with the presence of a particular genetic variant. The reports are
designed to help users understand the meaning of their results and any appropriate actions that
may be taken based on their results.
B Principle of Operation:
DNA is isolated from a user’s saliva sample and tested on the HLP. The HLP detects the
rs429358 and rs7412 variants in the APOE gene and determines each user’s APOE genotype.
The HRA interprets and categorizes each user’s APOE genotype (e2/e2, e2/e3, e2/e4, e3/e3,
e3/e4 and e4/e4) into risk groups (decreased, average, and increased) based on the estimated
lifetime risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer’s disease.

2. Linearity:
Not applicable
3. Analytical Specificity / Interference:
Four studies were performed to determine the effects of substances found in saliva
that may interfere with the performance of the HRA for late-onset Alzheimer’s
disease. Per study protocol, for sequenced samples to be included in the data analyses
(e.g., evaluable samples), the sample(s) must pass pre-defined QC thresholds.
a. Study 1 evaluated four endogenous proteins commonly found in saliva. Each of
the following were added to saliva samples: alpha-amylase (395 U/mL),
hemoglobin (20 mg/mL), immunoglobulin A (IgA) (0.43 mg/mL), and albumin
(2.67mg/mL). The study showed that these proteins did not affect test
performance for saliva samples (n=29–30 evaluable samples across four
endogenous proteins). The test results are shown below.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison:
Three method comparison studies were conducted to evaluate accuracy: the first
study was conducted with human saliva samples with known genotypes and a second
study was conducted with human cell line samples with known genotypes to
determine the rates of correct APOE genotype calls. A third study was conducted
with human saliva and/or human cell line samples with known variants in genes other
than the APOE gene to determine the agreement of the genotype calls.
a) Accuracy study with human saliva samples:
Accuracy of the HRA for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease was evaluated by testing
human saliva samples with known APOE genotypes. The presence of the two
variants in the APOE gene was analyzed on the HLP and the genotyping results
were compared to the known genotypes confirmed by Sanger sequencing
(comparator). The accuracy for detecting the two variants in the APOE gene on
the HLP (genotype call) using DNA isolated from human saliva samples (n=99)
was 100% with a lower bound of 95% CI as 96.3% for all samples tested. The test
results are shown in the table below.

1) Risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer’s disease and APOE allele frequency
Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by onset of the disease in people at
or older than age 65 years. Many factors have been suggested to be associated with
a decreased or increased risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer’s disease,
including age, genetic variants, family history of dementia, and lifestyle. The
association of the APOE e2 and e4 alleles with the modified risk of developing
late-onset Alzheimer’s disease is one of the well-known genetic determinants
across various ethnicities based on peer-reviewed scientific literature. The clinical
performance and genetic variant detection by the HRA for late-onset Alzheimer’s
disease are supported by peer-reviewed scientific literature. The APOE e2 allele is
associated with a decreased risk to develop late-onset Alzheimer's disease at or
above age 65 years, whereas the APOE e4 allele is associated with an increased
risk to develop late-onset Alzheimer's disease at or above age 65 years. The HLP
detects the two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs429358 and rs7412,
that determine the status of the e2, e3, and e4 alleles of the APOE gene.
The different combinations of the APOE alleles (e2, e3 and e4) were grouped
based on the risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer’s disease as follows:
a. Individuals with the APOE e3/e3 genotype have an average risk of developing
late-onset Alzheimer’s disease.
K192073 - Page 13 of 19

--- Page 14 ---
b. Individuals with the APOE e2/e2 or e2/e3 genotype have a decreased risk of
developing late-onset Alzheimer’s disease compared to individuals with the
APOE e3/e3 genotype for the European, African, and South Asian descent.
c. Individuals with the APOE e2/e4, e3/e4, or e4/e4 genotype have an increased
risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer’s disease compared to individuals with
the APOE e3/e3 genotype.
d. Individuals who have none of these APOE genotypes will not receive
information on their relative risk to develop late-onset Alzheimer’s disease due
to the lack of studies in the scientific literature.
Three APOE alleles covered by this test are found in people of all ethnicities. The
percentage of the population carrying each of the six possible APOE genotypes
will vary from study to study based on the enrollment criteria of the genetic study.
A summary of the frequency of each APOE genotype in different ethnicities
collected from multiple published peer-reviewed scientific studies is presented in
the table below:

Methods:
Quota-based sampling per U.S. Census was employed to recruit a diverse set of study
participants based on their demographic variables in age, gender, ethnicity, and
education level. Study participants who enrolled into the user comprehension study
were randomly assigned into one of four risk category groups (increased, average,
decrease, and result not available). Study participants took the test on their personal
desktop. Voice and screen recordings of each study participant are captured during
the test. The user comprehension was tested through a two-step process. First,
participants' understanding of genetics was tested prior to viewing the pre-purchase
page and test reports. Second, participants were shown the pre-purchase page and the
test reports and completed the comprehension assessment. A total of 303 study
participants met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. Fifty-nine (59)
participants were non-complete users and removed from final analysis due to one of
the following reasons across four risk category groups.
• Exited test: an automated reason generated by Usertesting.com when their
software detects there was some type of technical difficulty that resulted in the
participant leaving the study prior to completion.
• Session Expired is an automated reason generated by Usertesting.com when their
software detects that a participant does not start the study within 30 minutes.
• Uploading Issue is an automated reason generated by Usertesting.com when their
software detects that a participant had issues uploading the test answers to the
testing site.
The number of non-complete users in each risk category group were as follows: 16
users (20%) in the increased risk group, 9 users (12.8%) in the average risk group, 12
users (16.4%) in the decreased risk group, and 22 users (26.5%) in the result not
available group. There were no timed-out users in this study. A total of 244 study
participants assigned to a risk category group across all risk categories (increased,
average, decrease, and result not available) were included in the comprehension rate
analysis. The completion rate was 100% for all 244 study participants.
Results:
The overall comprehension rate per comprehension category ranged 90.6 to 98.4%
across all risk categories. The comprehension rate within the risk category ranged
from 85.2 to 100% per comprehension category. The user comprehension study
results are shown in the table below.

The comprehension rates were also analyzed by age, gender, race, and education
level for each comprehension category. The comprehension rates ranged 87–
100% across ages, 93–99% across genders, 79–100% across ethnicities, and 87–
100% across education levels as summarized in the table as below.

c. Frequently Asked Questions Material:
A Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section was developed and included in each
Genetic Health Risk Report. The FAQ section was to provide users information to
adequately understand the purpose, limitations, and the meaning of the results of the test,
and was developed using methodology consistent with the Manufacturer's labeling
design, identification of communication messages, and label comprehension. The
concepts covered in the FAQ section include: the test results, the purpose of the test,
limitations of the test, relevance of race and ethnicity on test results, the meaning of the
result, other risks factors that contribute to disease, appropriate follow-up procedures,
how the results of the test may affect the user's family and children, and links to resources
that provide additional information. The questions included in the FAQ section for each
of the tests report included the following:
