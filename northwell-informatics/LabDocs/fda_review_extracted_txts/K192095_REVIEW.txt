II Submission/Device Overview:
A Purpose for Submission:
Addition of a new matrix (urine) to a previously cleared device.
B Measurand:
Monoclonal Immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, Kappa, Lambda)
C Type of Test:
Capillary Zone Electrophoresis
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The CAPI 3 IMMUNOTYPING kit is designed for the qualitative detection and the
characterization of monoclonal proteins (immunotyping) in human urine and serum with the
CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument, SEBIA, for capillary electrophoresis. It is used in
conjunction with the CAPI 3 PROTEIN(E) 6 kit, SEBIA, designed for proteins separation into 6
major fractions in alkaline buffer (pH 9.9). The CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument performs all
procedural sequences automatically to obtain a protein profile for qualitative analysis. Each urine
or serum sample is mixed with individual antisera that are specific against gamma (Ig G), alpha
(Ig A) and mu (Ig M) heavy chains, and kappa (free and bound) light chains and lambda (free
and bound) light chains, respectively. The proteins, separated in silica capillaries, are directly
detected by their absorbance at 200 nm. The electrophoregrams are evaluated visually to detect
the presence of specific reactions with the suspect monoclonal proteins. For In Vitro Diagnostic
Use.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The CAPI 3 IMMUNOTYPING kit includes the following components:
• Sample diluent
• Pierceable cap for the Sample diluent vial
• Rack with electrophoresis (ELP) solution and antiserum tubes
• ELP solution
• Mammalian immunoglobulins antihuman gamma heavy chains
• Mammalian immunoglobulins antihuman alpha heavy chains
• Mammalian immunoglobulins antihuman mu heavy chains
• Mammalian immunoglobulins antihuman kappa (free and bound) light chains
• Mammalian immunoglobulins antihuman lambda (free and bound) light chains
B Principle of Operation:
The CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument uses the principle of capillary electrophoresis in a liquid
medium. With this technique, charged molecules are separated by their electrophoretic mobility
in an alkaline buffer with a specific pH. Protein separation is performed in a high voltage
electrical field. The separated proteins are directly detected using absorbance at 200 nm at the
cathodic end of the capillary. Separation occurs according to the electrolyte pH and is driven by
electroosmotic flow. The CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument has silica capillaries functioning in
parallel allowing 12 simultaneous analyses.
With the CAPI 3 IMMUNOTYPING procedure, the immunotyping using specific antibodies is
performed to identify abnormal fractions in serum or urine protein profiles through a process
called Immunofixation by Subtraction (Immunotyping). Here, the addition of immunoglobulin
class specific antisera to the patient sample causes a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of the
specific peaks, allowing the identification of the class of the aberrant peak.

A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
All results met the manufacturer’s pre-specified acceptance criteria.
Repeatability
Four different urine samples with monoclonal proteins including Bence Jones proteins were
run using the CAPI 3 IMMUNOTYPING URINE procedure on all capillaries of the same
CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument using one lot of CAPI 3 IMMUNOTYPING kit. The
four samples included IgG-kappa, Lambda Free, IgM-kappa + kappa free, and IgA-Lambda
+ lambda free. Each sample was analyzed with each reagent in duplicate (ELP solution, Anti-
Ig G, Anti-Ig A, Anti-Ig M, Anti-Kappa and Anti-Lambda using the 12 capillaries. In this
study all dilution programs were tested. For each tested reagent, all samples gave concordant
results within run and between capillaries.
Between-Instrument and Between-Lot Precision
Three different urine samples with monoclonal proteins including Bence Jones proteins were
run using the CAPI 3 IMMUNOTYPING URINE procedure on three CAPILLARYS 3
TERA instruments and with three lots of CAPI 3 IMMUNOTYPING kit. The samples
included one sample with two kappa free light chains, one sample with IgG-kappa
immunoglobulin and one sample with Lambda free light chain. Each sample was analyzed on
18 runs over five working days (2 runs/day x 3 lots x 3 instruments = 18). In this study, all
dilution programs were tested. All samples gave concordant results for all runs on the three
CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instruments and with the three lots of CAPI 3 IMMUNOTYPING
kit.

device, where specificity/interference was demonstrated in the original clearance (see
K130500).

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
No reference standards and methods available. Controls are internally manufactured by the
manufacturer from myeloma serum samples with representative Immunoglobulin G with
kappa light chain (IgGK), Immunoglobulin A with kappa light chain (IgAK), and
Immunoglobulin M with lambda light chain (IgML) monoclonal proteins and are validated
by both Immunofixation Gel Electrophoresis and Capillary Electrophoresis methods.
Stability: The manufacturer provided data to support real-time stability of two years and on-
board stability of two months for the CAPI 3 IMMUNOTYPING Kit.
Sample Stability at 2–8ºC
Ten urine samples. including normal and pathological urine samples, were
analyzed at the beginning of the study (reference) and after one week storage at 2–8°C
(test), with the CAPI 3 IMMUNOTYPING URINE procedure performed with the
CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument. The results obtained comply with the acceptance
criteria defined by SEBIA for the CAPI 3 IMMUNOTYPING URINE procedure
performed with the CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument. Urine samples can be stored
for one week between 2 and 8°C.
Stability –70 /–80°C
Eleven urine samples including normal and pathological urine samples were
analyzed at the beginning of the study (reference) and after one month storage at –70 /
–80°C (test), with the CAPI 3 IMMUNOTYPING URINE procedure performed with
the CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument. The results obtained comply with the acceptance
criteria defined by SEBIA for the CAPI 3 IMMUNOTYPING URINE procedure performed
with the CAPILLARYS 3
TERA instrument. Urine samples can be stored for one month between –70 and –80°C.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The method comparison study included 52 urines samples composed of 8 urine samples
without monoclonal component and 44 urine samples with monoclonal component including
Bence Jones proteins. The samples were tested using the CAPI 3 IMMUNOTYPING URINE
procedure performed with the CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument (test technique) and the
CAPILLARYS IMMUNOTYPING URINE procedure performed with the CAPILLARYS 2
instrument (reference technique). All electropherograms were evaluated visually for the
qualitative results. This study demonstrated a 100 % agreement between the two techniques.
Qualitative Results Number of urine samples Percent Agreement
IgG Lambda 5 100%
IgG Kappa 2 100%
IgG Lambda with Lambda free 4 100%
IgG Kappa with Kappa free 2 100%
Lambda free 19 100%
Kappa free 8 100%
IgM Kappa with Kappa free 2 100%
IgA Lambda 1 100%
IgA Lambda with Lambda free 1 100%
Without Monoclonal 8 100%
Grand Total 52 100%
2. Matrix Comparison:
Not applicable, the results in urine are not directly comparable to serum.
C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable, clinical studies were not required for the addition of this matrix.
2. Clinical Specificity:
Not applicable, clinical studies were not required for the addition of this matrix.
3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not applicable, this is a qualitative test.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
Absence of monoclonal immunoglobulins in apparently healthy individuals
