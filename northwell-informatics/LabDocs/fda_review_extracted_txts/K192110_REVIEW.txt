III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The VITEK DENSICHEK instrument is an accessory intended for use with the VITEK 2 Systems to measure the optical density of a
microorganism suspension. The instrument provides values in McFarland units, proportional to the microorganism concentration.
VITEK DENSICHEK is intended for use with polystyrene tubes, and the reading range is 0.00 to 4.00 McFarland. The VITEK
DENSICHEK has applications as an in vitro diagnostic medical device, or in an industry setting.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK DENSICHEK is an optical reading device intended for professional use by laboratory health professionals in clinical or
industry laboratory settings. The device determines the McFarland value by evaluating the absorption of light in the test tube
K192110 - Page 2 of 15

--- Page 3 ---
containing the suspension. The more turbid the organism suspension is, the higher the McFarland value displayed by the device. An
algorithm assesses results obtained from the turbidimetric reading and translates them into a McFarland value.
The VITEK DENSICHEK instrument contains a base unit with a detachable optical interface, named the Pod. The Pod calculates and
automatically transmits the optical McFarland reading to the Base unit for display. The user can confirm the McFarland value by
pressing a button on the Pod, optionally saving the value to the VITEK FLEXPREP Software on a laboratory PC, where it is recorded
with specimen setup information for traceability.
The Pod McFarland readings are communicated to the Base through a Bluetooth Low Energy wireless interface. When docked on a
Base, the Pod is automatically paired and recharged through a wireless contact connection. The Display Base displays McFarland
readings from the Pod on an LCD resistive touch screen and can be integrated with VITEK 2 software to record readings for
traceability. The Connectivity Base is available for customers who only want to use the VITEK DENSICHEK with the VITEK 2
software to display and record McFarland readings. McFarland Reference Standards featuring radio-frequency identification (RFID)
tags are used to verify the measurement accuracy performance of the VITEK DENSICHEK.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three reproducibility studies were conducted to demonstrate the performance of the VITEK DENSICHEK. The first study (Study
1) evaluated the original design which is referred to as Product Build 1 (PB1). Study 1 was conducted in which both the predicate,
DensiCHEK Plus, and PB1 were evaluated. A panel of 10 Gram-negative isolates, 10 Gram-positive isolates, and 10 yeast isolates
were used to prepare the suspension, which was used to inoculate each antimicrobial within each test card (i.e., AST-GN69, AST-
GP72, AST-ST02, AST-YS05). Both dilution options (automatic and manual dilutions) were used to inoculate AST cards noted
below. Testing was conducted at three sites across three days for a total of 540 results per antimicrobial (3 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 10 = 540)
using the following test cards with respective antimicrobials:
AST-GN69 (Gram-negative)
Ampicillin
Amoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid
Ceftazidime
Gentamicin
Imipenem
Levofloxacin
Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole
AST-GP72 (Gram-positive)
Ampicillin
Chloramphenicol
Ciprofloxacin
Daptomycin

Nitrofurantoin
Minocycline
AST-ST02 (Gram-positive)
Benzylpenicillin
Erythromycin
Tetracycline
AST-YS05 (Yeast)
Caspofungin
Fluconazole
Reproducibility data was analyzed taking into consideration best case and worst-case analysis as described in the AST Special
Controls Guidance Document. As shown in Tables 2 and 3, the best-case reproducibility for all drugs for both automatic and
manual dilution methods was >95%. The drugs that demonstrated <95% reproducibility for worst case included isolates that
were off-scale when compared to the mode of each isolate (e.g., result ≤2, mode =4), however, given that the majority of the
worst-case results were >95% for all drugs and >95% for all best-case results, they were deemed acceptable.

After Study 1 was completed, a minor design change involving the spring torsion allowing tube rotation was made to PB1 to
improve repeatability. The modified, final device was referred to as Product Build 2 (PB2). Two additional studies (see below)
were conducted to evaluate reproducibility of PB2.
Study 2 was conducted at an internal site to demonstrate equivalency between the PB1 and PB2 to assess the impact of this design
change. The same isolates and antimicrobials were tested for both automatic and manual dilution methods for PB2 and the results
were compared to both PB1 and DensiCHEK Plus. Overall, the mode MIC values obtained using inocula prepared with VITEK
DENSICHEK PB1 and VITEK DENSICHEK PB2 and Densicheck Plus (predicate) were compared. Modal MIC results were an
exact match 89.5% of the time and were within +/- one dilution of each other 99.5% of the time between PB1 and PB2 (Table 4).
Also, the mode MIC values were an exact match 85.5% of the time and were within +/- one dilution of each other 98.9% of the
time between PB2 and DensiCHEK Plus (Table 5). Results for both analyses indicated that each device tested were comparable.

Another reproducibility study (Study 3) was conducted with an additional 10-organism panel to assess reproducibility at three sites
(two external clinical sites and one internal site). Reproducibility isolates were tested using the appropriate VITEK 2 AST card at
each clinical trial site. The reproducibility sets were tested in triplicate on each of three days by VITEK 2 automatic dilution and
VITEK 2 Compact manual dilution using 11 antimicrobials with McFarland suspensions prepared using the VITEK DENSICHEK
PB 2 for a total of 108 results for each antimicrobial. Testing was performed using Greiner Bio-One polystyrene test tubes for
VITEK 2. VITEK DENSICHEK PB 2 met the reproducibility performance criteria of >95% across all sites and therefore,
acceptable.

QC testing was also conducted for VITEK DENSICHEK PB 2 for both the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact instruments for the same
drugs and QC organisms at one site (i.e., 20 per drug/organism combination). Results were acceptable at >95%.
The sponsor also conducted the following microbiological verification studies:
Repeatability
Repeatibility testing on the subject device was based on multiple dilutions of one suspension of ATCC E. coli 25922 suspended in
0.45% saline. The dilutions were confirmed to be within the appropriate CFU ranges equivalent for each McFarland target using a
calibrated spectrophotometer and colony count testing. A total of 270 results (10 devices x 9 tubes x 3 lots of Greiner 12x75
polystyrene tubes) for each the subject and predicate devices across six McFarland ranges (i.e., 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 3.69 McFarland =
3240 results) was evaluated for accuracy. All results fell within the appropriate McFarland ranges >95% of the time and were
acceptable.
AST Verification and Supplemental QC Testing
The sponsor tested a variety of available isolates with internally validated QC ranges. Testing was done across three different subject
devices and the one predicate device to ensure that the McFarland readings were producing accurate results according to their
validated QC ranges. The following drugs were tested 59 times using the AST-GN69 card (Gram-negative isolates) with each of the
devices (i.e., 177 results) with the exception of piperacillin/tazobactam which was tested 57 (i.e., 174 results) times with each:
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefazolin, cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, ESBL
screen, ertapenem, gentamicin, imipenem, levofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin/tazobactam, tobramycin, and
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. For these isolates tested, the overall QC results for the VITEK DensiCHEK indicated that the devices
were performing acceptably at >95% within range. When evaluated separately, performance for nitrofurantoin was 89.3% (158/177),
however, given the combined performance for all drugs was >95%, the overall performance was considered acceptable.
The following drugs were tested 64 times using the AST-GP67 card (Gram-positive isolates) with each of the three subject devices:
ampicillin, benzypenicillin, cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, gentamicin high-level synergy,
inducible-clindamycin resistance, levofloxacin, linezolid, moxifloxacin, nitrofurantoin, oxacillin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, rifampicin,
streptomycin high-level synergy, tetracycline, tigecycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin. For these isolates tested,
the overall QC results indicated that the devices were performing acceptably at >95% within range.
The following drugs were tested 53 times using the AST-ST02 card (Streptococcus spp. isolates) with each of the three subject
devices: ampicillin, benzypenicillin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin, inducible-clindamycin resistance,

levofloxacin, linezolid, moxifloxacin, tetracycline, tigecycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin. For these isolates
tested, the overall QC results indicated that the devices were performing acceptably at >95% within range.
The following drugs were tested 36 times using the AST-YS07 card (Candida spp. isolates) with each of the three subject devices:
amphotericin B, caspofungin, fluconazole, flucytosine, micafungin, and voriconazole. For these isolates tested, the overall QC results
indicated that the devices were performing acceptably at >95% within range.
