Lyphochek control levels 1, 2, and 3 were tested on three (3) reagent lots and three (3)
calibrator lots. The samples were run at one external site on one Access 2 Immunoassay
System and were run in replicates of 2 for a total of 20 days, with two (2) runs per day
(separated by a minimum of two hours), for a total of 40 valid runs. Eighty (80) replicates
were used for imprecision analysis according to CLSI EP05-A3. Two (2) calibration curves
on three (3) calibrator lots and three (3) reagent pack lots were utilized during the 20 day
precision study.
Total imprecision, within run imprecision (repeatability), between run, and between day
variation was evaluated in terms of percent coefficient of variation, %CV. The acceptance
criteria for total imprecision is a standard deviation (SD) ≤ 0.012 for values < 0.150 ng/mL
and a CV ≤ 8.0% for values ≥ 0.150 ng/mL. Acceptance criteria for within run imprecision is
SD ≤ 0.009 ng/mL for values < 0.150 ng/mL & CV ≤ 6% for values ≥ 0.150 ng/mL.

The study demonstrated that Access PCT assay meet design input requirements for total
imprecision on the Access 2 with an SD ≤ 0.012 ng/mL for values < 0.150 ng/mL and a CV
≤ 8.0% for values ≥ 0.150 ng/mL. The Access PCT assay also met the within run imprecision
(repeatability) design input requirements with an SD ≤ 0.009 ng/mL for values < 0.150
ng/mL and CV ≤ 6.0% for values ≥ 0.150 ng/mL.
The acceptance criteria established and demonstrated by the sponsor provides evidence that
Access PCT is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
2. Linearity:
Two studies were performed to demonstrate the linearity of the Access PCT assay based on
CLSI EP06-A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A

In both studies three Access 2 Immunoassay Systems were used, three reagent pack lots and
one calibrator lot. Three quality controls were run in replicates of two on each day of testing
to verify the system was in control.
In the study analyzing the full range of the assay, one high sample and one low sample were
mixed to make nine sample concentrations evenly distributed across the analytical measuring
range. Four replicates of the seven mixed samples, eight replicates of the low sample and
four replicates of the high sample were tested. In addition to the high and low PCT
concentration samples, seven mixtures were tested in this study. The low sample was run in
replicates of eight, and all other samples were run in replicates of four.
In the study analyzing the low end of the assay range, one high sample and one low sample
were mixed to make ten sample concentrations evenly distributed between 0.007 ng/mL and
approximately 3 ng/mL. The low sample was run in replicates of eight, and all other samples
were run in replicates of four.
The Access PCT assay demonstrated acceptable linearity throughout the analytical measuring
range of 0.05 ng/mL to approximately 100 ng/mL. The Access PCT assay was designed to be
linear, with a maximum deviation from linearity of ≤ 10% for values > 0.150 ng/mL and ≤
0.012 ng/mL for values ≤ 0.150 ng/mL.
The data from the full assay range study was analyzed based on CLSI EP06-A using a
weighted linear regression. The PCT linearity study was designed using 9 dilutions and was
evaluated against the linearity specification of ± 10%. Analysis using all 9 dilutions resulted
in some of the highest concentrations having non-linearity > 10%. Per CLSI EP06-A: 2003
section 5.3.3, the high concentration point was removed, and linearity was re-assessed. The
remaining samples used to evaluate linearity still cover the full measuring interval of the
assay. All linearity results using the reduced 8 dilution point range met the linearity
specification.
The obtained results are summarized in the table below:

In addition, the linearity data was analyzed to evaluate percent recovery for each intermediate
mixture sample used for the linearity evaluation. The expected value for each sample was
computed based on the observed concentration of the low sample, high spiked sample, and
the proportion of each of the high and low samples in the mixture. Percent recovery was then
calculated as the observed value for each sample as a proportion of the expected value. The
observed range of percent recovery values was 94% - 112%
Total Error, % Bias and %TE were determined for the low range and full range of the assay.
Calculations were based on expected values in the linearity study.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Potential cross-reactive substances were added to serum patient samples at three
concentrations of procalcitonin (approximately 0.25 ng/mL, 0.5 ng/mL, and 2.0 ng/mL).
Stock solutions of potential cross- reactants were prepared volumetrically using calibrated
pipettes and the appropriate solvent. This stock solution was added directly to the serum in
no more than 5% (v/v) final concentration. Control samples were prepared in the same
manner using the solvent, without the cross-reactant added. Control and test samples were
tested on the Access 2 instrument within 24 hours of preparation, using three reagent lots.
Testing of human calcitonin, human katacalcin, human alpha CGRP and human beta CGRP,
with Access PCT found that there is no significant cross-reactivity, as defined by a change in
concentration between the diluent control and the test samples that is less than the expected
within assay variability between samples.
Potential interfering substances were spiked into patient samples. Results from these spiked
patient samples were evaluated against that of the unspiked sample. In accordance with CLSI
EP07, third edition, interference testing was completed on patient serum samples containing
four levels of procalcitonin at three clinically relevant concentrations of 0.25 ng/mL, 0.5
ng/mL and 2.0 ng/mL and an additional procalcitonin concentration of approximately 80
ng/mL. Potential interferents were tested at one concentration above therapeutic
concentration range as directed by CLSI EP07, third edition. See Table 2 below for the list
and concentrations of each interferent.

The acceptance criterion is defined as a change in concentration between the diluent control
and the test sample within the variability expected between sample, which is ± 10%. No
potential interference was found to exceed the acceptance criterion.
NOTE: Biotin interference was not evaluated since the Access PCT assay does not use biotin:
streptavidin chemistry.
Human Anti-mouse Antibody (HAMA)/ Rheumatoid Factor (RF) -
Testing of characterized HAMA/RF samples was performed to evaluate blocker effectiveness
in the Access PCT assay. Native samples tested were serum and EDTA patient samples.
Testing performed used three lots of reagent and three Access 2 instruments. Testing was
completed on a “Control” reagent pack with the conjugate diluent and the reagent buffer
containing blockers and a “Test” conjugate diluent and reagent buffer that did not contain
blockers. The same lot of stock conjugate was used in the control and test for each of the
reagent packs. One lot of conjugate diluent without blockers and one lot of reagent without
blockers was used. All other reagent components (paramagnetic particles and NaOH) were
matched for the control and test packs. One hundred eighteen (118) HAMA/RF samples were
characterized by vendors as a specific type of interferent sample. All samples were tested in
replicates of five on each of the three reagent pack lots (control and test).
“True interference” was defined as the percent difference between the control and the test
pack which is greater than two times the within laboratory (total) imprecision requirement of
the assay. Two times the total imprecision of the assay equals ± 16% for samples ≥ 0.15
ng/mL and ± 0.024 ng/mL for samples below 0.15 ng/mL.

The Access PCT reagent pack has been formulated to minimize the effects of HAMA/RF
interference. Immunoenzymatic assay technology may demonstrate interferences from
heterophile antibodies, including HAMA. While this assay has been formulated to minimize
the effects of these antibodies, the following cautionary note has been included in the
“Limitations of the Procedure” section of the product insert.
“For assays employing antibodies, the possibility exists for interference by heterophile
antibodies in the patient sample. Patients who have been regularly exposed to animals or
have received immunotherapy or diagnostic procedures utilizing immunoglobulins or
immunoglobulin fragments may produce human anti-animal antibodies, e.g., HAMA, that
interfere with immunoassays. Additionally, other antibodies such as human anti-goat
antibodies may be present in patient samples. Such interfering antibodies may cause
erroneous results. Carefully evaluate the results of patients suspected of having these
antibodies.”
“Other potential interferences in the patient sample could be present and may cause
erroneous results in immunoassays. Some examples that have been documented in
literature include rheumatoid factor, endogenous alkaline phosphatase, fibrin, and
proteins capable of binding to alkaline phosphatase. Carefully evaluate results if the
sample is suspected of having these types of interferences.”
4. Carryover
Verification studies were performed to determine potential assay carryover for the Access
PCT assay on the Access 2 instrument. This testing used samples at 0.25 ng/mL and the
medical decision points of 0.5 ng/mL and 2.0 ng/mL as the “low samples”. Serum samples
spiked with the highest calibrator served as the “high samples”. Testing alternated five
replicates of low samples, at each level, with two replicates of the high sample. Testing was
performed over two days using one instrument and five reagent packs for each low sample
level tested. Three commercial quality controls were run in duplicate on each day to verify
the system was in control.
Results are in the table below.

In all cases, the shift between initial testing of target concentrations and testing of target
concentrations after high concentrations was < 10%, which is in within the inter sample variability of
the assay and is therefore acceptable.
5. Assay Reportable Range:
The assay reportable range is the same as the predicate, 0.05 ng/mL – 100 ng/mL.
6. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Sample Stability
The in vitro stability of procalcitonin antigen in serum gel, serum no-gel, lithium heparin
plasma and EDTA plasma patient samples using Access PCT assay was characterized at one
internal site to determine sample handling and storage conditions. All four sample types,
serum gel, serum no gel, LiHep plasma and EDTA plasma, were obtained from individual
donors with normal procalcitonin levels. Samples were prepared by spiking all four sample
types obtained with recombinant PCT antigen to procalcitonin concentrations throughout the
Access PCT measuring range. Samples were obtained from both internal and external sites.
The study was run on at least one reagent pack lot and two calibrator lots on two Access 2
immunoassay systems. Three quality controls were run in replicates of two on each day of
each run to verify that the instrument was in control.
Parameters evaluated in the study include:
• Short-term stability at room temperature 20°C to 25°C
• Short-term stability at cooler temperature 2°C to 10°C
• Short-term stability at freezer temperature -30°C to -15°C
• Sample Freeze/Thaw cycles stored at temperature -30°C to -15°C
Short-term stability at room temperature 20°C to 25°C was evaluated at 4 and 16 hours. One
aliquot from each subject was tested immediately to determine baseline values (time 0). The
remaining aliquots were stored at room temperature with one aliquot tested at each of the
subsequent time points.

stable at 20-25°C for 4 hours, or 90 days at -30 to -15°C and can be frozen and thawed up to
3 times.
Calibration cards are provided with each calibrator kit. Calibration cards contain bar codes
that are encrypted with the individual calibrator concentrations for each calibrator level.
7. Limit of Blank (LoB), Detection (LoD) and Quantitation (LoQ):
Studies were performed to determine the LoB, LoD and LoQ in the Access PCT assay using
a protocol based on CLSI EP17-A2 (Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical
Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline – Second Edition).
LoB
Three Access PCT S0 calibrator lots and one lot of Access Wash Buffer II were used for the
LoB determination. One hundred (120) total replicates for each reagent pack lot were tested
across two instruments (60 per instrument). LoB was calculated for each reagent pack lot. Of
the total replicates, per reagent pack lot, ninety (90) were comprised of S0 calibrators (30
replicates of each of three lots) and thirty (30) were comprised of Access Wash Buffer II that
were measured for the LoB determination. LoB was evaluated on one calibrator lot. Two
Access 2 instruments and three reagent lots were used in the study design. Three days of
testing were performed evaluating five replicates of each of the zero analyte sample. Three
quality controls were run in replicates of two on each day to verify the systems were in
control. The LoB was determined using the 95% non-parametric percentile of the 120
replicates for each of three evaluations. The results of this study demonstrate that the Access
PCT assay met the acceptance criterion of ≤ 0.005 ng/mL.
LoD
The study was run on one Access 2 Immunoassay Systems, using three reagent
lots and one calibrator lot. For estimation of LoD, ten serum samples, ten lithium
heparin plasma, and ten EDTA plasma samples containing low levels of
procalcitonin analyte were measured. One run per day, approximately nine
replicates per run were performed on each day of testing, resulting in a maximum
of forty-five replicates for each instrument/pack lot combination. Three quality
controls were run in replicates of two on each day to verify the systems were in
control. The LoD was determined by fitting the precision profile model between
within-lab standard deviation (SD) and concentration. The SD, which was based
on the precision model, was multiplied by the 95th percentile of the standard
normal distribution and added to the LoB to calculate the LoD per CLSI EP17-A2.
The results of this study demonstrate that the Access PCT met the acceptance
criterion of ≤ 0.01ng/mL.
LoQ
As indicated in CLSI EP17-A2, in situations where bias cannot be determined,
K192271 - Page 15 of 18

--- Page 16 ---
within-laboratory precision is used as the sole acceptance goal. Bias is defined as
the difference between the expectation of the test results and an accepted reference
value, which is not available for the PCT analyte. Therefore, the LoQ approach
outlined in CLSI EP17-A2 based upon a precision profile experiment in the low-
end region of the measuring interval was used for the Access PCT assay. This
method used three Access 2 Immunoassay Systems in the study design with three
reagent lots and one calibrator lot. For estimation of LoQ, approximately ten
native serum samples, ten native EDTA (plasma) samples, and ten native lithium
heparin (plasma) containing low levels of procalcitonin analyte were prepared.
Samples were tested over five days, one run per day, 9 replicates per run, for each
pack lot. This resulted in a maximum of 45 replicates for each sample on each
pack lot tested. Three quality controls were run in replicates of two on each day to
verify the systems were in control. A variance components model was used to
estimate the within- run and within-laboratory (total) %CV for each sample on
each instrument and reagent lot combination. A log-log quadratic precision profile
model was fitted to within- laboratory (total) %CV versus observed sample mean.
The fitted precision profile was used to calculate the 20% CV LoQ. The
acceptance criteria are 20% CV at ≤ 0.02 ng/mL. The results of this study
demonstrate that the Access PCT assay met the acceptance criterion of a LoQ ≤
0.02 ng/mL.
B Clinical Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method concordance (agreement) results to VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT were used to
establish positive and negative agreement at clinical decision points (0.5 ng/mL
and 2.0 ng/mL).
Method comparison samples were residual serum samples from standard of care PCT testing
obtained from vendors’ specific SOPs with IRB/EC waiver of informed consent.
On the Access 2, among the 238 samples, 2 samples were reported as over the Access
PCT measuring range (>100 ng/mL) and 18 samples were reported below IVD VIDAS
B·R·A·H·M·S PCT measurable range (<0.05 ng/mL). The 20 samples that were outside
either assay’s measuring range were excluded from analyses. Five samples were excluded
based on visual sample quality observation after thawing. Additionally, 3 samples were not
tested on the VIDAS instrument. Therefore, a total of 207 samples with paired Access PCT
and VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT measurements were included for analyses. Distribution of
PCT levels for the 207 samples, as measured by the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT assay, were:

After daily maintenance, the IUO Access PCT assay was calibrated on all instruments
and reagent lots as required for study testing. After a passing calibration curve was
obtained, the site performed daily QC using Bio-Rad Specialty Lyphochek QC material.
If QC met acceptance criteria, the site performed method comparison and method
concordance.
The percent agreement and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each
clinical decision point (0.5 and 2.0 ng/mL) are presented in the two tables below. The
number of samples that agree or disagree according to the clinical decision points are
