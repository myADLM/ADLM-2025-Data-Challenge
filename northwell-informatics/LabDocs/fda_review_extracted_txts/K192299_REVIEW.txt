III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below
B Indication(s) for Use:
The LZI Cotinine II Enzyme Immunoassay is intended for the qualitative and semi-quantitative
determination of cotinine in human urine at the cutoff value of 200 ng/mL when calibrated
against cotinine. The assay is intended as an aid in the detection of cotinine after use or exposure
to tobacco products. The assay is designed for prescription use with a number of automated
clinical chemistry analyzers.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of (1) enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as gas or
liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS or LC/MS) or (2) permitting laboratories to
establish quality control procedures.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific alternative chemical
method (e.g., gas or liquid chromatograpy and mass spectrometry) must be used in order to
obtain a confirmed analytical result. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary test result is
positive.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Prescription use only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Validation studies were conducted using the AU480 Chemistry Analyzer.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The LZI Cotinine Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay with ready-to
use liquid reagents. The LZI Cotinine Enzyme Immunoassay is a kit comprised of two reagents,
an R1 and R2, which are bottled separately but sold together within the kit. The R1 solution
contains mouse monoclonal anti-cotinine antibody, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD), stabilizers, and sodium azide (0.09 %) as a preservative. The R2
solution contains glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) labeled with cotinine in buffer
with sodium azide (0.09 %) as a preservative.
B Principle of Operation:
The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the enzyme
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for a fixed amount of antibody in the reagent.
Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, and the drug concentration in the
sample is measured in terms of enzyme activity. In the absence of drug in the sample, cotinine-
K192299 - Page 2 of 11

--- Page 3 ---
labeled G6PDH conjugate is bound to antibody, and the enzyme activity is inhibited. On the
other hand, when free drug is present in the sample, antibody would bind to free drug; the
unbound cotinine-labeled G6PDH then exhibits its maximal enzyme activity. Active enzyme
converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change
that can be measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Cotinine samples (cotinine spiked negative urine pools) were run in replicates of 2, two runs per
day (one in the morning and one in the afternoon) for 22 days on one AU480 automatic clinical
analyzer for a total of 88 runs, in both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. One single lot of
reagents and calibrators and controls were used. Cotinine was spiked into samples at the
concentrations shown in the tables below, and all sample cotinine concentrations were confirmed
by LC/MS.

2. Linearity:
A recovery/linearity study was performed by spiking cotinine into a pool of negative urine to
create a 1000 ng/mL high concentration. The high concentration was then diluted to reach the
final concentrations listed in the table below. Each sample was run in 10 replicates on the AU480
automated clinical analyzer in semi-quantitative mode with a calibration curve established with
the five Cotinine calibrators (0, 100, 200, 400, and 1000 ng/mL). Recovery values (expected
value divided by average observed value) were calculated and are presented in the table below.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The compounds listed below were spiked into urine to the desired concentrations. These
solutions were then split into three portions; one without cotinine, and the remaining two that
were further spiked with cotinine standards obtained from Cerilliant to a final cotinine
concentration of 150 ng/mL or 250 ng/mL (as negative or positive controls, ±25 % Cutoff
Concentration, respectively). Samples were then evaluated against the assay’s calibration curve
in both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes, and the results are as shown below (results were
identical for both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes). Results indicated that there is
interference from boric acid at 1 % w/v and citric acid. No other compounds showed interference
concentrations at the concentrations tested. Data collected on the AU480 automated clinical
analyzer is summarized in the following table:

respectively) were adjusted to the pH levels reported in the table below and tested by the assay.
The pH adjusted solutions were evaluated against the cutoff calibrator. No major interference
between pH 3 to pH 11. Results are summarized in the table below.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device
A total of one-hundred and four (104) unaltered clinical samples were tested with the LZI
Cotinine II Enzyme Immunoassay on the AU480 automated clinical analyzer. Samples were
evaluated against the assay’s calibration curve in both qualitative and semi-quantitative
modes. All samples were tested in singlet. All samples were confirmed with LC/MS for
cotinine concentrations, and the accuracy of the assay to LC/MS is provided in the table
below.
