III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panels are designed for use in determining
quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid
media of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel is used to determine quantitative
and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid media of rapidly
growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. After inoculation, panels are
incubated for 16 - 20 hours at 35 °C +/- 1 °C in a non-CO incubator, and read either visually or
2
with MicroScan instrumentation, according to the Package Insert.
This particular submission is for updated breakpoints of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa for the antimicrobial meropenem (Mer) at concentrations of 0.004 to 32 ug/mL to the
test panel.
Meropenem has been shown to be active in vitro against most strains of microorganisms listed
below, as described in the FDA-approved package insert for this antimicrobial agent.
Active in vitro and in clinical infections against:
Escherichia coli
Klebsiella pneumoniae
Proteus mirabilis
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Active in vitro but clinical significance is unknown:
Citrobacter freundii
Citrobacter koseri
Enterobacter cloacae
Hafnia alvei
Klebsiella oxytoca
Morganella morganii
Proteus vulgaris
Serratia marcescens
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Limitations
The ability of the MicroScan Dried Gram Negative Panels to detect resistance to meropenem is
unknown for the following species because an insufficient number of resistant strains were
available at the time of comparative testing: C. koseri and P. vulgaris. Isolates yielding MIC
results suggestive of a resistant interpretive category should be submitted to a reference
laboratory.
K192355 - Page 2 of 15

--- Page 3 ---
Due to the occurrence of very major errors with meropenem and tubidity inoculation with all
read methods, isolates of K. pneumoniae that provide an MIC of 1 µg/mL should be retested
using an alternative/reference method.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
MicroScan panels can be read either manually or automatically on the WalkAway or autoSCAN-
4 instrument systems.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo panel with meropenem is used to determine
the quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of aerobic and facultatively
anaerobic gram-negative bacilli colonies grown on solid media. After inoculation, panels are
incubated for 16-20 hours at 35°C ± 1° in a non-CO incubator and read either visually or with
2
MicroScan instrumentation according to the package insert.
Inoculation methods: Turbidity or Prompt Inoculation System
Read methods: Manual, MicroScan WalkAway System and MicroScan autoSCAN-4
B Principle of Operation:
The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are dehydrated miniaturizations of the broth dilution
susceptibility test. Various antimicrobial agents are diluted in Mueller Hinton broth
supplemented with calcium and magnesium to concentrations spanning the range of clinical
interest. Breakpoint Combo panels use concentrations equivalent to the categorical breakpoints
of FDA and/or CLSI. After inoculation and rehydration with a standardized suspension of
organism and incubation at 35°C for a minimum of 16 hours, the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) for the test organism is determined by observing the lowest antimicrobial
concentration showing inhibition of growth.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three external sites using 10 isolates of gram-
negative bacilli that were consistent with the intended use. The range of meropenem dilutions
tested was 0.004-32 µg/mL. Isolates were tested in triplicate over three days for a total of 270
data points (27 data points per isolate). The isolates tested in the reproducibility study
included: C. freundii complex (1 isolate), E. aerogenes (3 isolates), E. cloacae (2 isolates), E.
coli (1 isolate), K. oxytoca (1 isolates) and P. aeruginosa (2 isolates).
Inocula were prepared using both the turbidity and Prompt methods and results were read
manually (visually) and with the WalkAway and autoSCAN-4 instrument systems. All data
points were on-scale and the majority were within ± one doubling dilution of the mode MIC
(Table 2). Because all results were on-scale, only a single result is reported for each read
method.
The reproducibility results are acceptable.

Inoculum Density Check. A spectrophotometric device, the MicroScan Turbidity Meter,
was used to ensure the accuracy of the turbidity inoculation method. A zero check of the
turbidity meter was performed daily. The inocula prepared using the turbidity method were
standardized using a reading of 0.08 ± 0.02 (equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland barium sulfate

turbidity standard). The digital reading was recorded for each isolate and was considered
acceptable based on recommendations in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document:
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems.
Inoculum density data for the Prompt inoculation system was collected from suspensions of
the QC strain E. coli ATCC 25922 and for all reproducibility isolates. Average colony counts
were within the acceptable range for the QC strain and for all reproducibility isolates except
for K. oxytoca which showed an elevated colony count at one testing site; however, the
reproducibility observed with K. oxytoca was acceptable.
Purity Check. Purity checks were performed on all isolates for each inoculum preparation;
only results from pure cultures were included.
Growth Failure Rate. Less than 10% of isolates demonstrated no growth on the dried test
panel
Quality Control Testing. The CLSI-recommended QC organisms E. coli ATCC 25922 and
P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were tested with all inoculation and read methods using fourteen
dilutions of meropenem (0.004 – 32 µg/mL). The reference panel was inoculated using the
turbidity method only. In this submission, the QC range for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 is
being updated to the current recommended range of 0.12 – 1 µg/mL from the range of 0.25 –
1 µg/mL utilized for the original meropenem clearance (K971376). For both QC strains,
quality control results were within the acceptable range for all inoculation and read methods.
Results of current QC testing are shown in Table 3 below and demonstrate that acceptable
QC results can be obtained with this device for > 95% of tests.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The results obtained with the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel with
meropenem (dilution range 0.004 – 32 µg/mL) were compared to results obtained using a
frozen broth microdilution reference panel (dilution range 0.004 – 32 µg/mL). Clinical
isolates were evaluated at three testing sites in the U.S in a single study; challenge isolates
were evaluated in two separate studies performed at internal and external sites.
The reference panel was prepared as described in CLSI document M07-A10 except for the
use of Pluronic-F in the inoculum water for the reference panel. A validation study was
performed to demonstrate the equivalence between reference panels inoculated with
organisms suspended in water supplemented with Pluronic-F and reference panels inoculated
with autoclaved deionized water without Pluronic-F. The effect of Pluronic-F in the reference
panel was determined with 11 replicates each of the quality control strains E. coli ATCC
25922 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853; 100% of results were within the expected QC range
with both inoculum preparations.

For the reference method and MicroScan panels inoculated using the turbidity method,
panels were inoculated using the same standardized suspension further diluted into 25 mL of
water with Pluronic-D (for the MicroScan dried panels) or Pluronic-F (for the frozen
reference panels). MicroScan panels were also inoculated using the Prompt inoculation
method with isolates inoculated into the Prompt inoculation bottle. Reference panels were
read manually (visually); MicroScan panels inoculated with both inoculation methods were
read using the WalkAway and autoSCAN-4 instruments and by manual read.
Clinical Study
To determine the performance of the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel
with Meropenem, a total of 528 Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates were evaluated with all
inoculation and read methods (Tables 4 and 5). The testing included the following indicated
species: C. freundii (15 isolates), C. koseri (3 isolates), E. cloacae complex (41 isolates), E.
coli (214 isolates), H. alvei (1 isolate), K. oxytoca (14 isolates), K. pneumoniae (71 isolates),
M. morganii (16 isolates), P. mirabilis (89 isolates), P. vulgaris (2 isolates) and S.
marcescens (34 isolates). An additional 28 isolates of non-indicated Enterobacteriaceae
species (10% of the total number of isolates tested) were also evaluated. Of the
Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 448 (84.8%) were fresh isolates (tested within seven days of
isolation) and 80 (15.2%) were stock isolates.
A total of 87 clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa were evaluated, 77 of which (88.5%) were
fresh isolates and 10 (11.5%) were stock isolates (Tables 4 and 5).
Challenge Study
A total of 122 Enterobacteriaceae challenge isolates were evaluated. These included: C.
freundii (4 isolates), C. koseri (9 isolates), E. cloacae complex (13 isolates), E. coli (15
isolates), H. alvei (10 isolates), K. oxytoca (3 isolates), K. pneumoniae (29 isolates), M.
morganii (3 isolates), P. mirabilis (6 isolates), P. vulgaris (21 isolates) and S. marcescens (5
isolates). In addition, four isolates of the non-indicated species, K. aerogenes, were
evaluated.
A total of 44 challenge isolates of P. aeruginosa were evaluated. See Tables 4 and 5.
Results for EA, CA and categorical errors for Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa for all
inoculation and read methods are shown in Tables 4 and 5 below. Essential agreement of
evaluable results was calculated considering MIC results that were clearly identical to
reference method results or clearly ≥ one doubling dilution higher or lower than the reference
method results. Overall results for Enterobacteriaceae and for P. aeruginosa with all
inoculation and read methods were acceptable.
For C. koseri and P. vulgaris, no resistant isolates were available for evaluation during
clinical or challenge testing. The sponsor included the following limitation in the device
labeling:
The ability of the MicroScan Dried Gram Negative Panels to detect resistance to
meropenem is unknown for the following species because an insufficient number of
resistant strains were available at the time of comparative testing: C. koseri and P.
K192355 - Page 8 of 15

--- Page 9 ---
vulgaris. Isolates yielding MIC results suggestive of a resistant interpretive category
should be submitted to a reference laboratory.
For K. pneumoniae inoculated with the turbidity method, one very major error was observed
with the WalkAway and autoSCAN-4 read method for a very major error rate of 3.3%. With
the turbidity inoculation method and manual read, two very major errors with K. pneumoniae
were observed (6.7%). The sponsor included the following limitation in the device labeling
to address the potential for very major errors with this species:
Due to the occurrence of very major errors with meropenem and turbidity inoculation
with all read methods, isolates of K. pneumoniae that provide an MIC of 1 µg/mL should
be retested using an alternative/reference method.
One of two resistant isolates of H. alvei showed a very major error (50.0%) with the turbidity
inoculation method and manual read. The sponsor included the following footnote to the
performance table in the device labeling:
One of the two resistant Hafnia alvei strains had a discrepant result compared to the
reference method when using the manual read and turbidity inoculation method.
To address the testing and reporting of meropenem results for non-indicated species, the
sponsor included the following statement in the Warnings and Precautions section of the
device labeling:
The safety and efficacy of antimicrobial agents tested by this device, may or may not have
been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials for treating clinical
infections due to microorganisms outside of those found in the indications and usage
section in the drug label. The clinical significance in those instances is unknown. The
approved labeling for specific antimicrobial agents provides the uses for which the
antimicrobial drug is approved.

Resistance Mechanism Characterization
Challenge isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa harboring various molecular
mechanisms of resistance noted in the FDA approved drug label were tested with
meropenem. Isolates from the following CDC and FDA Antibiotic Resistance Isolate Bank
panels were evaluated: Enterobacteriaceae Carbapenem Breakpoint Panel,
Enterobacteriaceae Carbapenemase Diversity Panel and the Gram Negative Carbapenemase
Detection Panel.
Trending
An analysis of trending was conducted using the combined clinical and challenge data for
each organism group and for each inoculation and read method. This trending calculation
takes into account MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilution lower
or higher compared to the reference method irrespective of whether the device MIC values
are on scale or not. Results that are not clearly at least one dilution lower, at least one dilution
higher or in exact agreement with the CLSI reference method are not considered in the
trending analysis.

Trending results for indicated species were evaluated to determine if species-specific trends
were observed. Species or organism groups for which the difference between the percentage
of isolates with higher vs. lower readings was >30% and for which the confidence interval
was determined to be statistically significant were considered to show evidence of trending.
Trending that provides higher or lower MIC values compared to the reference is addressed in
labeling.
A trend toward lower MIC readings was observed for P. aeruginosa using the manual read
method with the turbidity inoculation method. While no trending was observed overall for
Enterobacteriaceae, a trend toward higher readings was observed for C. koseri and E. coli
with Prompt inoculation and all read methods, for P. mirabilis with Prompt inoculation and
WalkAway and manual reads and for P. vulgaris with Prompt and manual read. A trend
toward lower readings was observed for M. morganii with turbidity inoculation and all read
methods and for P. vulgaris with turbidity and autoScan-4 read. The sponsor included the
following footnote to the performance table in the device labeling:
Meropenem MIC values for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were most
frequently in exact agreement with the reference method. When not in agreement, results
tended to be one doubling dilution lower for P. aeruginosa (turbidity, manual read), P.
vulgaris (Turbidity, AutoScan-4 read) and M. morganii (Turbidity, all read methods).
Results tended to be one doubling dilution higher for C. koseri and E. coli (Prompt, all
read methods, P. vulgaris (Prompt, manual read) and P. mirabilis (Prompt, WalkAway
and manual read).

To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that Beckman Coulter
intends to use to evaluate the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panels with
Meropenem (Mer) (0.004 - 32 µg/mL) when revised breakpoints for meropenem are published
on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included with the submission
indicated that if specific criteria are met, Beckman Coulter will update the meropenem device
label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section after re-evaluation
of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any new limitations as
determined by their evaluation.
