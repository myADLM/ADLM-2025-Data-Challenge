III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Tosoh ST AIA-PACK BNP assay is designed for IN VITRO DIAGNOSTIC USE ONLY
for the quantitative measurement of BNP in human K2EDTA plasma on Tosoh AIA System
analyzers. BNP is used as an aid in the diagnosis of heart failure (HF) in patients presenting to
the emergency department (ED) with clinical suspicion of new onset HF, acutely decompensated
or exacerbated HF.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
The ST AIA-PACK BNP should only be used for patients presenting to the emergency
department (ED)
D Special Instrument Requirements:
TOSOH AIA Analyzer 2000
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ST AIA-PACK BNP set consists of 5 trays x 20 test cups. Each kit contains plastic test cups
containing twelve magnetic lyophilized beads coated with anti-BNP mouse monoclonal antibody
and 100 µL of anti-BNP mouse monoclonal antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase with
sodium azide as a preservative.
B Principle of Operation:
The ST AIA-PACK BNP is a two-site immunoenzymometric assay which is performed entirely
in the ST AIA-PACK BNP test cups. BNP present in the test sample is bound with monoclonal
antibody immobilized on magnetic beads and enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody. The
magnetic beads are washed to remove unbound enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody and are
then incubated with a fluorogenic substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4MUP). The
amount of enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody that binds to the beads is directly proportional
to the BNP concentration in the test sample. A standard curve is constructed, and unknown
sample concentrations are calculated using the curve.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The study was conducted at 1 site using three lots of ST AIA-PACK BNP Reagents and
Calibrator Sets on three AIA-2000 analyzers to assess the precision of the ST AIA-PACK
BNP assay. Six EDTA plasma samples were tested. A high concentration sample was
prepared by spiking an EDTA plasma base pool with BNP. This sample was then diluted
using a base EDTA plasma pool to create 3 pools with BNP concentrations of approximately
500, 1000, and 2000 pg/mL. The lower concentration samples were patient samples with
approximate BNP concentrations of 10, 50 and 100 pg/mL. The six samples were tested in
replicates of two, at two separate times per day, for twenty days. The two runs per day were
separated by a minimum of two hours.
Within run, between run, between day and total precision was calculated for each lot and all
lots combined. Results for a representative lot and the combined lots are shown below.

The EDTA Plasma-6 sample was excluded from this analysis because the results with all lots
combined were above the measuring range of the assay.
2. Linearity:
The claimed assay range is 4.0 to 2000 pg/mL. A study was conducted to determine the
linearity of the Tosoh ST AIA-PACK BNP assay using low and high EDTA plasma samples.
The low sample was prepared by making a 1:99 dilution of a higher EDTA plasma sample.
The ST AIA-PACK BNP sample diluting solution was used to prepare the dilutions. The
high sample was spiked EDTA plasma. The intermediate concentrations were made by
dilutions that would be related to each other and the high and low samples by constant
intervals. A total of fourteen (14) samples each for EDTA plasma ranging from 3.1 – 2271.54
pg/mL were assayed on one (1) Tosoh AIA-2000 analyzer in replicates of four (4).

The sponsor performed the analyses recommended in the CLSI guideline EP06-A and the
results support that the assay is linear from 4.0 to 2000 pg/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Endogenous Interfering Substances:
Studies were conducted to evaluate the potential interference from the endogenous substance
summarized below with the Tosoh ST AIA-PACK BNP assay. EDTA plasma samples with
known concentrations of BNP, at approximately 35 pg/mL, 90 pg/mL and 1,000 pg/mL were
spiked with varying concentrations of the potential interferents. The criterion for no
interference was defined as a mean percent recovery for each interferent within 100±10% of
the control. When the substances listed below were tested, no interference was observed up
to the concentration listed in the table.
Highest Concentration Tested
Substance
With No Interference
Hemoglobin 130 mg/dL
Unconjugated (Free) Bilirubin 15 mg/dL
Conjugated bilirubin 19 mg/dL
Lipemia (represented by
1600 mg/dL
triglycerides)
Protein (represented by human

albumin)
Rheumatoid factor 500 IU/mL
Ascorbic Acid 20 mg/dL
Human IgG 5.3 g/dL
Creatinine 15 mg/dL
Cholesterol 400 mg/dL
Alkaline Phosphatase 2000 U/L
HAMA IgG 500 ng/mL
In addition, the labeling includes the following limitations:
• Hemolyzed samples should be avoided for the measurement due to the possibility to
give erroneously lower concentrations.
• Lipemia has an insignificant effect on the assay except in the case of gross lipemia
where spatial interference may occur.
• Tosoh Automated Immunoassays utilizing alkaline phosphatase-based technologies
should not be used with samples from patients under Asfotase Alfa treatment.
• Patient samples may also contain human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) due to either
natural antibody production or antibodies produced in response to therapy regimens.
HAMA may cause either false-positive or false-negative results in assays using

interfere in assays of this type. ST AIA-PACK BNP has been designed to minimize
the effects of heterophile antibodies, but interference from high titers cannot be ruled
out.

High-Dose Hook Effect:
Hook effect was evaluated using one (1) BNP positive EDTA plasma sample spiked to
60,000 pg/mL and diluted 1:2, 1:5, and 1:10 with ST AIA-PACK BNP sample diluting
solution. No high dose hook effect was observed when samples up to approximately 50,000
pg/mL of BNP were assayed.
The following information will be included in the limitations section of the labeling.
• The ST AIA-PACK BNP has been designed so that the high dose “hook effect” is not a
problem for the vast majority of samples. The “hook effect” phenomenon may occur at
BNP concentrations higher than 50,000 pg/mL.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
4.0 – 2000 pg/mL
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
The ST AIA-PACK BNP CALIBRATOR SET contains assigned concentrations of BNP.
The assigned value is determined on a lot-by-lot basis and is designed to provide an assay
calibration range of 4.0 to 2,000 pg/mL of BNP. The calibrators are prepared through serial
dilution of a gravimetrically prepared internal reference standards made with commercially
available BNP.
Sample Stability:
The sponsor provided data to support sample stability at different temperatures:
Refrigerated samples 35.6 – 46.4 °F (2 - 8 °C) are stable for up to 8 hours.

Room Temperature samples are stable for up to 3 hours.
Frozen plasma at – 4 °F (-20 °C) are stable for 65 days.
6. Detection Limit:
The CLSI EP17-A guideline was used to design the limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection
(LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) studies.
LoB was determined by running sixty replicates of Calibrator 1 (Buffered Solution; Blank
Sample) over five days, measuring one run per day, three replicates per run and four lots
using the Tosoh ST AIA-PACK BNP assay on one Tosoh AIA-2000 instrument. Non-
parametric principle based on ordered values was used.
Low level samples selected from concentrations in the range from 1.3 to 17.0 pg/mL (LoB to
4x LoB) were prepared by dilution of specimens with known BNP concentrations. The
samples were assayed in replicates of two (2) over five (5) days on one instrument for a total
of ten (10) replicates per sample. The standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation
(CV%) were calculated.
LoQ was calculated as the functional sensitivity at 20% CV. To determine the functional
sensitivity, a precision profile was plotted using the values of CV% and the mean

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
A study was conducted in the U.S. to support the use of the assay. Compared to clinical
studies for previously cleared BNP devices, this study prospectively recruited males and
females who presented to the ED with clinical suspicion of new onset HF, acutely
decompensated or exacerbated HF. A total of 825 samples were assayed for BNP using the
Tosoh AIA 2000 Analyzer were recruited from 8 different ED sites. The analysis is based on
724 patients that met the inclusion criteria and the outcome (new onset HF, acutely
decompensated or exacerbated HF) was based on adjudication. The samples were frozen
prior to analysis. Data supporting the stability of the samples for the storage time and
conditions were provided by the sponsor.
The cross tabulation of results between HF and BNP at the cutoff of 100 pg/mL is below.

Using the traditional single cutoff of 100 pg/mL, the sensitivity of the ST AIA-PACK BNP
assay is 88.4% and the specificity is 70.6%. The Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is 71.5% and
the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) is 88.0%.

There are potentially confounding comorbidities that may influence BNP results. These
comorbidities include diabetes, renal insufficiency, hypertension (HTN) and/or chronic
obstructed pulmonary disease (COPD). Among the 724 patients in the study, 577 patients
presented with comorbidities and 147 presented with no comorbidities. Performance of the BNP,
broken down by the presence or absence of these comorbidities. In the subset of patients without
comorbidities the sensitivity was 89.3% and the specificity was 74.7%. Conversely in the
patients with comorbidities the sensitivity and specificity were 88.3% and 69.4% respectively.

The following limitations are in the device labeling:
• This test has low sensitivity (76%) in patients with severe obesity (BMI ≥37). In the study,
24% of patients with an adjudicated diagnosis of new onset heart failure, exacerbated heart
failure or acutely decompensated heart failure and a BMI ≥37 had BNP values below the
cut-off (false negatives)
• This test has low specificity (59%) in patients with eGFR < 60. In the study, 41% of
patients without an adjudicated diagnosis of new onset heart failure, exacerbated heart
failure or acutely decompensated heart failure and eGFR < 60 had BNP values above the
cut-off (false positives).
• This test has low specificity (53%) in patients in the higher age group (age ≥75). In the
study, 47% of patients with an adjudicated diagnosis of new onset heart failure, exacerbated
heart failure or acutely decompensated heart failure and aged ≥75 years had BNP values
above the cut-off (false positives)
• This test has low specificity (45%) in patients with a history of HF. In the study, 55% of
patients with an adjudicated diagnosis of new onset heart failure, exacerbated heart failure
or acutely decompensated heart failure and a history of HF had BNP values above the cut-
off (false positives)
