C Type of Test:
A multiplexed nucleic acid test intended for use with the BioCode MDx-3000 Instrument for the
simultaneous qualitative in vitro detection and identification of multiple respiratory viral and
bacterial nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) collected in viral transport media (VTM)
or universal transport media (UTM), and obtained from individuals suspected of respiratory tract
infections.
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The BioCode Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP) is a qualitative multiplexed nucleic acid-based
in vitro diagnostic test intended for use with BioCode MDx-3000 Instrument. The BioCode RPP
is capable of the simultaneous detection and identification of nucleic acids from multiple viruses
and bacteria extracted from nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples obtained from individuals with
signs and/or symptoms of respiratory tract infection. The following pathogens and subtypes are
identified using the BioCode RPP:
• Adenovirus
• Coronavirus (229E, OC43, HKU1, and NL63)
• Human Metapneumovirus A/B
• Influenza A, including subtypes H1, H1 2009 Pandemic, and H3
• Influenza B
• Parainfluenza Virus 1
• Parainfluenza Virus 2
• Parainfluenza Virus 3
• Parainfluenza Virus 4
• Respiratory Syncytial Virus A/B
• Rhinovirus/Enterovirus
• Bordetella pertussis
• Chlamydia pneumoniae
• Mycoplasma pneumoniae
The detection and identification of specific viral and bacterial nucleic acids from individuals
exhibiting signs and/or symptoms of a respiratory infection aids in the diagnosis of respiratory
infection if used in conjunction with other clinical and epidemiological information. The results
of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient
management decisions.
Negative results in the setting of a respiratory illness may be due to infection with pathogens that
are not detected by this test, or lower respiratory tract infection that may not be detected by a
nasopharyngeal swab specimen. Positive results do not rule out co-infection with other
organisms: the agent(s) detected by the BioCode RPP may not be the definite cause of disease.
Additional laboratory testing (e.g., bacterial and viral culture, immunofluorescence, and
K192485 - Page 2 of 50

--- Page 3 ---
radiography) may be necessary when evaluating a patient with possible respiratory tract
infection.
Due to the genetic similarity between Human Rhinovirus and Enterovirus, the BioCode RPP
cannot differentiate them. A positive BioCode RPP Rhinovirus/Enterovirus result should be
followed up using an alternate method (e.g., cell culture or sequence analysis) if differentiation is
required. The BioCode RPP detects Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus with reduced sensitivity. If a
more accurate Rhinovirus/Enterovirus result is required, it is recommended that specimens found
to be negative for Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus after examination using BioCode RPP be
confirmed by an alternate method (e.g., FDA cleared molecular tests).
Performance characteristics for Influenza A were established when Influenza A H1 2009
Pandemic and A H3 were the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation. Performance of
detecting Influenza A may vary if other Influenza A strains are circulating or a novel Influenza A
virus emerges. If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical
and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent Influenza
viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture should not be
attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

Interpretation of Results
The BioCode MDx-3000 software will analyze data based on plate validity, sample validity and
Median Fluorescent Intensity (MFI) compared to an MFI threshold.
Run Controls and Internal Control Results
The BioCode MDx-3000 software will suppress results if Internal or Negative controls are
invalid. The software will indicate if external positive controls are valid or invalid but will not
suppress results if the positive control is not valid (see Internal Control) below.
External Negative Controls
External Negative Controls can be RNase-free water, transport media, or well characterized
negative specimens. The External Negative Controls should go through all processing steps
(extractions, amplification, and detection). At least one External Negative Control is required for
each plate/kit lot. The BioCode MDx-3000 software will suppress results for all samples if the
External Negative Control is not valid (see Table 1 below).

External Positive Controls
External Positive Controls can be well characterized clinical samples or positive strains. External
Positive Controls can be single analytes or pooled multianalyte specimens. External Positive
Controls should go through all processing steps (extractions, amplification, and detection). It is
recommended that at least one External Positive Control be included for each plate/kit lot on a
rotating schedule. Wells identified as External Positive Controls will be trended by the BioCode
MDx-3000 software and the report will indicate a valid or invalid result on the report header (see
Table 2 below). However, the software will not suppress results based on External Positive
Control results. If an External Positive Control does not perform as expected, the user should
review all samples in that plate to determine if results can be reported.

the absence of RNA IC detection. However, the BioCode MDx-3000 software will suppress
target assay negative results for any wells with invalid RNA IC results (see Table 3 below). Lack
of RNA IC signal may indicate sample-associated inhibition or reagent/instrumentation issues.
Samples suspected of being inhibitory should be repeated from the extraction step. If reagent or
instrument issues are suspected specimens may be repeated using residue nucleic acid extracts.

Interpretation of Pathogen Results
Fluorescent signals from barcoded magnetic beads (BMBs) with the same barcode are sorted and
the median fluorescence index (MFI) is calculated for each analyte assay. The assays are
considered “Detected” by comparing the MFI to a specific validated assay cutoff. If assay target
specific MFI is at or above the threshold, the assay is positive.
For the following organisms detected by the BioCode RPP, the organism is reported as
“Detected” if a single corresponding assay is positive.
• Rhinovirus/Enterovirus
• Parainfluenza Virus 1
• Parainfluenza Virus 2
• Parainfluenza Virus 3
• Parainfluenza Virus 4
• Respiratory Syncytial Virus A/B
• Bordetella pertussis

a Repeated multiple positive should be further confirmed by other FDA-cleared influenza subtyping assays.
b If the re-test result confirms the original result, it is recommended that the sample be further investigated using a different
FDA-cleared influenza A subtyping assay and/or sending the residual sample to local public health laboratory for further
testing.
Influenza A (no subtype detected):
If the FluA assay is positive, but none of the hemagglutinin (HA) subtyping assays are positive,
then the interpretation is Influenza A (no subtype detected). This result could occur when the
titer of the virus in the specimen is low and not detected by the subtyping assays. This result
could also indicate the presence of a novel Influenza A strain or a seasonal Influenza A/H3 or
A/H1pdm09 strain with critical sequence mismatches to the primers and/or probes of the
BioCode RPP influenza A HA subtyping assays. In both cases, the sample in question should be
retested. If the retest provides a different result, test the sample a third time to ensure the
accuracy of the result. If the retest provides the same result, then the function of the BioCode
RPP should be verified by testing with appropriate external control materials (known positive
samples for Influenza A/H1, Influenza A/H3 and Influenza A/H1pdm09), and a negative control
should also be run to test for PCR-product contamination. If the BioCode RPP accurately
identifies the external positive and negative controls, contact the appropriate public health
authorities for confirmatory testing.
BioCode RPP Reports
The analyzed BioCode MDx-3000 results are displayed in two report formats: Run Report for
the entire run including multiple specimens, and Sample Report for individual specimens. Both
reports can be exported as a PDF or CSV file. Each report includes fully analyzed and
interpreted results for specimens and/or controls but is formatted differently.
The Run Report displays analyzed results in a tabular format for all wells (specimens/controls) in
a run from a specific kit lot. If more than one lot is run together, separate Run Reports will be
generated by the software for each lot. Possible results by target assay are: Detected, Not
detected, Invalid, Indeterminant (for Influenza A only), or N/A (if not ordered).
The Sample Report displays results for a single well (specimen/control). In addition to results for
each target assay, the Sample Reports include a results summary section which allows positive
results to be reviewed at a glance. The Sample Report results summary will also indicate well
validity based on BMB counts, background MFI, and external and internal controls. Sample
reports also include any sample-specific comments entered during setup.

Both report headers provide traceability information for: run name, run start and finish time, user
ID, software version, instrument ID, kit name, and reagent lots with expiration dates. The report
headers also include sections for Run Status and Controls Status. The Run Status section will
specify if the run is Incomplete, Valid or Invalid (based on the External Negative Control results
for the specific run/kit lot). The Controls Status section indicates the results for the External
Negative Controls (Valid or Invalid) and External Positive Controls (Valid, Invalid, or N/A if not
assayed). The Run Status and Controls Status sections should be reviewed prior to review of
target assay results. In addition, the software will also mask results in the detailed tabular
sections based on plate and well validity requirements.
Completed reports can be reviewed electronically. Reviewer comments can be added to the
report footer for traceability under the review section. In addition, MFI reports are available with
information only for administrator level users.
B Principle of Operation:
The BioCode MDx-3000 is an automated system that integrates PCR amplification, target
capture, signal generation, and optical detection for multiple respiratory viruses and bacteria
from a single nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimen, in either VTM or UTM. Nucleic acids from
NPS are extracted with the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG or Roche MagNA Pure 96
automated systems. Once the PCR plate is manually set up and sealed, all other operations are
automated on the MDx-3000.
Nucleic Acid Extraction
Nucleic acids (both RNA and DNA) are captured by coated magnetic beads and eluted on either
the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG or the Roche MagNA Pure 96 automated systems
according to the respective manufacturer provided protocol.
Overview of a BioCode MDx-3000 Run:
Reverse Transcription and Multiplex PCR
Since targeted pathogens of the BioCode RPP include RNA viruses, a reverse transcription (RT)
step is performed to convert the viral RNA into cDNA prior to amplification. The purified
nucleic acid solution is manually combined with a freshly prepared reaction mix for the RT step
and subsequent thermal cycling for multiplex PCR to enrich the target nucleic acids present in
the sample. One of the target-specific primers for each pathogen is biotinylated at the 5’-end to
generate labeled PCR product for subsequent detection.
PCR and Product Transfer
For the PCR amplification, the robotic head dispenses BMB- Probe mix into the designated
reaction wells of the capture plate using disposable pipette tips. After PCR amplification is
completed, the robotic head pierces the foil seal with disposable pipette tips and transfers PCR
products into corresponding wells of the capture plate.
Target Capture
Amplified PCR products labeled with biotin are captured at a defined temperature by target-
specific probes that are covalently coupled to designated Barcoded Magnetic Beads (BMBs).
K192485 - Page 9 of 50

--- Page 10 ---
During this step, BMBs are kept in suspension by gentle agitation. Differentiation of captured
targets is achieved by assigning a unique barcode pattern of BMBs for each pathogen and the
Internal Control.
Signal Generation
After washing off unbound PCR products and unused primers, a streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SA-
PE) conjugate is automatically added to the reaction by the robot. High affinity binding between
biotin and streptavidin ensures that captured PCR products with the biotin moiety are labeled
with phycoerythrin in close proximity to the BMBs.
Optical Detection
Optical detection is performed for each reaction well of the capture plate, an optically clear, flat-
bottom microtiter plate. After washing off unbound SA-PE, excitation of the fluorophore at the
designated wavelength emits fluorescence signal from BMBs tagged with SA-PE conjugates.
Each reaction well is imaged at a specific emission wavelength for fluorescent signal and under
bright field for identifying the barcode patterns (decoding).
Interpretation of Results
The BioCode MDx-3000 Software controls the operation of the instrument, collects and analyzes
data, and automatically generates interpretation for test reports at the end of the run. Fluorescent
signals from BMBs with the same barcode are sorted and calculated to generate median
fluorescence index (MFI) for each analyte. The presence or absence of a pathogen is determined
relative to the validated assay cutoff by MFI. The software also analyzes the results of external
and internal controls to validate the run and individual specimen results for reporting.

4. Calibration:
Optical calibration of the BioCode MDx 3000 is performed twice a year by Applied
BioCode. No calibration kit is available.
5. Quality Control:
Each laboratory should establish its own Quality Control ranges and frequency of QC testing
based on applicable local laws, regulations, and good laboratory practices. The BioCode RPP
uses an internal control (bacteriophage MS2) which is added to each sample prior to
extraction. The internal control monitors the efficiency of the extraction, reverse
transcription, amplification, and detection stages of the assay. Positive results may be
reported in the absence of RNA IC detection. The BioCode RPP software will suppress
negative results for any wells with invalid RNA IC results.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three testing sites using a combination of
NucliSENS easyMAG and MagNA Pure 96 automated systems for nucleic acids extraction
(two sites used NucliSENS easyMAG and one site used MagNA Pure 96 for nucleic acids
extraction). The study incorporated potential sources of variation introduced by site (three
testing sites), day (five different days), and operator (two operators per site). One lot of
reagents was assayed at three sites by two operators on one BioCode MDx-3000 instrument
per site for five days. A total of 10 BioCode RPP runs were performed per site.
A total of six contrived NPS samples containing known quantities of various BioCode RPP
analytes (Table 5 below) were prepared in a simulated NPS in UTM sample matrix. A NPS
sample negative for all BioCode RPP analytes was also prepared using the simulated NPS
in UTM sample matrix. The six contrived positive samples consisted of combinations of 12

4. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Assay Controls
External Negative Controls
External Negative Controls are user provided. They can be RNase-free water, transport
media, or well characterized negative specimens. The External Negative Controls should go
through all processing steps (extractions, amplification, and detection). At least one External
Negative Control is required for each plate/kit lot. The BioCode MDx-3000 software will
suppress results for all samples if the External Negative Control is not valid.
External Positive Controls
External Positive Controls are user provided. They can be well characterized clinical samples
or cultured organisms. External Positive Controls can be single analytes or pooled
multianalyte specimens. External Positive Controls should go through all processing steps
(extractions, amplification, and detection). It is recommended that at least one External
Positive Control be included for each plate/kit lot on a rotating schedule. Wells identified as
External Positive Controls will be trended by the BioCode MDx-3000 software and the
report will indicate a valid or invalid result on the report header. However, the software will
not suppress results based on External Positive Control results. If an External Positive
Control does not perform as expected, the user should review all samples in that plate to
determine if results can be reported.
Internal Control
An RNA Internal Control (RNA IC: bacteriophage MS2) is provided in the reagent kit and is
added to each sample during extraction. The Internal Control monitors the efficiency of the
extraction, reverse transcription, amplification, and detection stages of the assay. Positive
target assay results may be reported in the absence of RNA IC detection. However, the
BioCode MDx-3000 software will suppress target assay negative results for any wells with
invalid RNA IC results.
External controls are not provided with the BioCode RPP. However, six frozen (-70°C)
external control mixes obtained from ZeptoMetrix as NATtrol controls for different
pathogens (see Table 8 below) were provided to the clinical study sites for testing during the
prospective clinical study and the clinical study testing retrospective and contrived
specimens. Operators were required to follow the BioCode RPP instructions for use during
the testing.

Specimen Stability Study
Nasopharyngeal Swab (NPS) should be collected according to standard technique and
immediately placed in 1 – 3 mL of VTM or UTM. Samples should be tested as soon as
possible. An analytical study was performed to assess the specimen stability limitations for
the optimal performance of the BioCode RPP on the BioCode MDx-3000. Nine
representative pathogens from the BioCode RPP were spiked into prescreened negative
natural NPS in UTM specimens at 3x LoD (see Table 10 below) and assayed with three
extraction replicates on the easyMAG at each timepoint, except for baseline. A total of seven
extraction replicates on the easyMAG were assayed at timepoint 0. Stability of extracted
nucleic acids was also assessed in this study.

The specimen stability testing data supports the following specimen stability claims in the
product package insert:
NPS collected in VTM or UTM may be stored at room temperature for 8 hours, in a 2-8°C
refrigerator for 7 days, or at <-60°C for up to 90 days.
Extracted nucleic acids may be stored in a 2-8°C refrigerator for up to 12 hours, or at
≤-60°C for up to 90 days.
Fresh vs. Frozen
The results of the Specimen Stability Study (see Table 11 above) also demonstrated that
preservation of samples (by freezing at -80°C) does not affect the accuracy of test results
compared to freshly prepared samples. Therefore, it is appropriate to utilize frozen archived
prospective and retrospective clinical samples in the evaluation of BioCode RPP to
supplement the prospective (fresh) clinical study data, and to use frozen simulated samples in
analytical studies for this submission.
Single-Spiked vs. Multi-Spiked Specimen Study
An analytical study was conducted to assess the performance of the BioCode RPP on the
BioCode MDx-3000 with mixed analyte samples at or near the Limit of Detection (LoD)
compared to single spiked samples to justify the use of multiple analyte spiked samples
during analytical validation testing. LoD was determined for single spiked samples in
simulated NPS for four representative pathogens on both the easyMAG and MagNA pure
extraction systems. For initial range finding, four replicates of each concentration were
extracted on the easyMAG and MagNA pure systems and tested in singlet with the BioCode
RPP on the BioCode MDx-3000 system to estimate LoD. The LoD was further confirmed by
extracting 20 replicates of each sample and testing each in singlet for a total of 20 replicates
at or near the presumptive LoD. The single spiked LoDs were then challenged by pooling all

systems. When 1x LoD for each pathogen in the mixed pool does not meet the 95% detection
goal, the pooled pathogen samples were retested at 3x LoD with 20 extraction replicates.
Results within 3x LoD were considered to be equivalent in this study.

The acceptance criteria of this study were met since all pathogens tested were within 3xLoD
for single-spiked and multi-spiked samples. The study results seem to demonstrate that the
performance of the BioCode RPP on the BioCode MDx-3000 with mixed analyte samples at
or near the Limit of Detection (LoD) is similar to single spiked samples. Using multiple
analyte spiked samples during analytical validation testing appears to be acceptable.
Simulated vs. Natural NPS in UTM Specimen Study
Analytical validation studies are mostly performed with contrived specimens (i.e., spiking
known concentrations of pathogens into negative NPS in UTM or VTM matrix). This would
require a large volume of negative natural NPS to be collected and screened, while typically
only between 1.0 to 2.0 mL per donor could be obtained after NPS collection and screening
to confirm negative status. This makes collection from donors burdensome. An analytical
study was performed to assess the performance equivalency of testing a simulated NPS
(sNPS) in UTM matrix compared to testing natural NPS in UTM using the BioCode RPP,
with both the NucliSENS easyMAG and the MagNA Pure 96 extraction systems. The sNPS
in UTM matrix consists of 2x103 HeLa cells/mL diluted in UTM.
Samples were contrived in negative natural NPS in UTM matrix and in sNPS in UTM matrix
with multi-spiked pathogens at close to LoD levels (approximately 1.5x to 15.0xLoD). Each
sample was extracted in quadruplicate on both the easyMAG and the MagNA Pure 96
extraction system and tested singly with the BioCode RPP on the BioCode MDx-3000
system.
Summary results of this analytical study are presented in Table 13 below.

The study results show that the performance testing contrived samples in this simulated NPS
(sNPS) in UTM matrix compared to testing contrived samples in natural NPS in UTM matrix
using the BioCode RPP, with both the NucliSENS easyMAG and the MagNA Pure 96
extraction systems, are similar. Therefore, it is acceptable to utilize the simulated NPS in
UTM sample matrix in conducting the analytical studies in support of this submission.
5. Detection Limit:
Limit of detection (LoD) estimation and confirmation studies were carried out with contrived
samples in simulated NPS in UTM (Remel M4 transport medium) matrix designed to
resemble a natural clinical NPS in UTM specimen. An equivalence study was performed
which demonstrated that the simulated matrix was similar to the natural clinical NPS matrix
and did not impact BioCode RPP test performance. Refer to the “Simulated vs. Natural NPS
in UTM Specimen Study” section.
Representative isolates of respiratory viruses and bacteria were selected to make contrived
samples in order to obtain positive results for every target assay on the panel. In some
cases, testing of more than one isolate/strain per analyte was performed to assess LoD for
clinically important species or variants, specifically when more than one assay was needed
to detect the expected diversity of an analyte (e.g. Adenovirus).
An estimated LoD concentration for each analyte was first determined by testing serial
dilutions of contrived samples. Four extraction replicates per dilution on each extraction
system, NucliSENS easyMAG and MagNA Pure 96, were tested using the BioCode RPP.
The LoD was confirmed by extracting 20 replicates on each extraction system and testing
each for a total of 20 replicates at or near the estimated LoD using the BioCode RPP. LoD
for each isolate was defined as the lowest concentration with ≥95% detection of 20 replicates
(at least 19 out of 20 replicates).
A multi-spiked approach was employed in both the LoD estimation and the LoD
confirmation studies where samples spiked with two pathogens at various concentrations
were tested in the LoD studies. An equivalence study was performed which demonstrated
that the performance of the multi-spiked samples was similar to that of the single-spiked

6. Analytical Reactivity:
An analytical study was performed to assess analytical reactivity/inclusivity of the BioCode
RPP. Different strains, serotypes and genotypes were selected that represent temporal,
geographic, and genetic diversity for each pathogen. A panel of titered stocks for relevant
organisms/viruses diluted in simulated NPS in UTM matrix were tested starting at 3x LoD.
Organisms/viruses not detected at 3x LoD were tested at higher concentrations. Since the
confirmed LoD result for B/Hong Kong/S/1972 (Victoria lineage) was higher than expected
at 48.6 TCID /mL, which could be related to difference in titration from vendor sources,
50
testing of the influenza B Victoria strains in this study was performed starting at 0.03xLoD or
0.3xLoD. Strains of unknown lineages of influenza B were tested at 3x LoD for the
B/Florida/4/2006 strain of the Yamagata lineage.
Each sample was extracted in triplicate on the NucliSENS easyMAG and tested with the
BioCode RPP on the BioCode MDx-3000 according to the instructions for use.
Note: Although this analytical reactivity testing was performed in part to demonstrate that the
BioCode RPP can detect various species and strains of a pathogen with similar analytical
sensitivity, it is difficult to make comparative sensitivity evaluations between different
organisms and different strains that have been quantified in TCID /mL or EID /mL. This
50 50
quantification method measures the infectivity and cytotoxicity or lethality of a strain in
tissue culture or in chick embryo, and is therefore subject to many influences (e.g., strain-to-
strain differences in infectivity, viability of the original material, culturing conditions, etc.).
Quantification by infectivity assay will not be equivalent between strains or organisms. Also,
since the measurand for the BioCode RPP is nucleic acids, LoD concentrations established in
TCID /mL or EID /mL can vary dramatically among different strains but may not actually
50 50
reflect significant differences in analytical reactivity of detection as measured by target
nucleic acids concentration.
Analytical reactivity testing results are summarized in Table 15 to Table 25 below.

n In silico analysis revealed a few non-critical mismatches in the FluA/H3 subtyping HA assay probe binding region
that could contribute to the observed lower reactivity. However, titering inconsistency from the vendor rather than
reduced reactivity due to assay design is suspected.

r Virus obtained through the CDC Influenza Division. This strain was detected by BioCode RPP as Flu A (no
subtype) at 50xLoD. In silico analysis did not reveal any mismatch in the Flu A matrix assay primers and probe
binding regions but showed 3 mismatches in the Flu A/H3 subtyping HA assay primers binding regions that could
predict reduced analytical reactivity, 1 mismatch at the 9th position from the 3’ end of the reverse primer (mismatch
#1), 1 mismatch at the 18th position from the 3’ end of the reverse primer (mismatch #2), and 1 mismatch at the 20th
position from the 3’ end of the reverse primer (mismatch #3). Wet testing data suggested that mismatch #1 is likely
the root cause for the observed significant reduction in analytical reactivity for this strain. Based on an in silico
analysis, of all the Flu A/H3 strains isolated in 2019 with published HA sequences, 73.8% of the strains harbor
mismatch #1. Therefore, for patient samples contain a Flu A/H3 strain that harbors mismatch #1 at lower
concentrations, the BioCode RPP will likely report a Flu A (no subtype detected) result.

Analytical reactivity was demonstrated with a wide variety of isolates/strains.
Due to public health concerns related to zoonotic transmission of influenza A
viruses to humans (primarily swine and avian lineages), serial dilutions of the
following isolates of swine and avian influenza A viruses (viral nucleic acids)
were also tested assessing analytical reactivity:
• A/Japan/305/57 (H2N2)
• A/duck/Pennsylvania/10218/1984 (H5N2)
• A/turkey/Wisconsin/1/1966 (H9N2)
• A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9)
• A/Hubei/1/2010 (H5N1)
• A/Minnesota/11/2010 (H3N2v)
Consistent with the in silico predictions of analytical reactivity to zoonotic influenza A
viruses, each non-seasonal influenza A strain tested (H2N2, H5N2, H9N2, H7N9, and
H5N1), except for the H3N2v strain, was detected as Influenza A (no subtype) at various
concentrations tested (i.e., detected by the BioCode RPP Influenza A matrix assay only). For
the H3N2v strain, it was detected as Influenza A/H3 at higher concentrations but was
detected as Influenza A (no subtype) at the lowest concentration tested.
Analytical testing could not be performed to assess reactivity to H5N8, H1N2v and H1N1
swine viruses due to the lack of availability of such zoonotic influenza A strains for wet
testing. Based on an in silico analysis, H5N8 (KP739416), H1N2v (MK239077), and H1N1
swine (KP822962.1) were predicted to be detected as Influenza A (no subtype), Influenza
A/H1 (with reduced sensitivity for the A/H1 assay), and Influenza A (no subtype),
respectively.
7. Analytical Specificity/Cross-Reactivity:
Analytical specificity (cross-reactivity) of the BioCode RPP was evaluated by
challenging the system with contrived samples in simulated NPS in UTM matrix
containing a high concentration of the potentially cross-reacting organism. On-panel
organisms were tested to assess the potential for intra-panel cross-reactivity (e.g., does
the Coronavirus OC43 assay cross-react with Coronavirus HKU1, etc.), while off-
panel organisms (those not intended to be detected by the panel) were tested to assess
the potential for non-specific amplification of respiratory flora or other respiratory
pathogens that may be present in an NPS specimen.
Each organism was tested at 106 CFU/mL for bacteria or fungi and 105 TCID /mL for
50
viruses or higher when possible at Applied BioCode, Inc. Organism or virus stocks
were spiked in simulated NPS in UTM matrix at desired concentrations at the time of
extraction. Each sample was extracted in triplicate on the NucliSENS easyMAG and
assayed in singlet with the BioCode RPP on the BioCode MDx-3000 system

according to the instructions for use. For each concentration tested, the number of
replicates that gave valid results per the Interpretation Algorithm was determined. If
any replicates were detected, testing was repeated from five additional extraction
replicates. If detected after repeat with five additional replicates, serial dilutions were
performed to determine the lower limit.
On-Panel Organisms/Viruses Testing
A group of 26 on-panel analytes were tested at high concentration to assess the
potential for intra-panel cross-reactivity. The organisms or viruses tested are

sequences as the targeted pathogen. Overall, the likelihood, risk, and impact of the
BioCode RPP non-specific interactions are predicted to be minor.
The BioCode RPP includes assays to distinguish classical human Influenza A H1
and the A H1 2009 pandemic variant derived from swine. However, due to
sequence similarity, some reactivity of the A/H1pdm09 assay may be observed with
historical and/or novel A/H1N1 strains of swine origin. This was demonstrated by
testing a swine origin influenza A A/New Jersey/8/1976 in the analytical reactivity
study which was detected and reported as dual positive for Influenza A/H1 and
Influenza A/H1pdm09 when tested at a concentration of 7.5 x 103 CEID /mL
50
(approximately 500xLoD).
Coxsackievirus and Echovirus may be detected as Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus
even at low concentrations. Due to the genetic similarity between Human
Rhinovirus and Coxsackievirus and Echovirus, this expected.
Other non-pertussis Bordetella species that harbor the repetitive element
IS481 sequence or other related sequence variants, Bordetella holmesii and
Bordetella bronchiseptica in particular, may be detected as Bordetella pertussis by
the BioCode RPP.
All identified BioCode RPP cross-reactivity cases are indicated in the product
Instructions for Use, as a precaution to minimize misinterpretation of results. A
summary is provided in Table 28 below.

The Influenza A/H1pdm09 assay may react with
H1 hemagglutinin gene sequences from viruses of
Influenza A H1N1 swine origin. BioCode RPP results may be either
Influenza A/H1pdm09
(swine origin) Influenza A/H1 or Influenza A/H1pdm09,
depending on the strain and concentration in the
sample.
8. Assay Cut-Off:
Preliminary MFI cutoff values were determined by analyzing the results of 500 archived
frozen NPS samples during verification based on two main criteria, signal to noise ratio and
the relative levels of sensitivity and specificity based on the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) analysis. The cutoff MFIs selected should produce a signal to noise
ratio of ≥5 for 95% of test wells and a Sensitivity ≥95% and Specificity ≥95% based on the
ROC analysis with an invalid rate (RNA IC) of ≤2%.

After completion of the analytical validation and clinical sample testing, the data was
reviewed to determine if any of the cutoff values established initially could be improved.
This review prompted the change of the ADV2 assay cutoff from 500 to 10000 MFI.

9. Interfering Substances:
An analytical study was performed to assess potential inhibitory effects of substances and
microorganisms that may be commonly found in nasopharyngeal specimens. Each member
of the interfering substance and microorganism panel was added to simulated NPS (sNPS)
matrix spiked with representative members of the BioCode RPP (see Table 30 below) at 3x
LoD and a negative matrix comprised of only sNPS. Each sample was tested with and
without potentially interfering substances or microbes. Each sample was prepared and
extracted in triplicate on both NucliSENS easyMAG and MagNA Pure 96 extraction system
and tested with the BioCode RPP on the BioCode MDx-3000 system. Substances that
produce interference at the original test concentration were further tested at lower
concentrations.

This study showed that none of the substances interfered with BioCode RPP at the
concentrations tested. All substances and microorganisms tested appeared to be compatible
with BioCode RPP assay at the concentrations tested. However, it was observed that mucin at
higher concentration (0.6%) could lead to loss of signal for some targets (loss of analyte
detection) when extracted with the NucliSENS easyMAG system. The effect of mucin was
dependent on the concentration in the sample tested. Flu Mist was evaluated to be reactive as
predicted with the BioCode RPP assay. Therefore, recent administration or contamination of
specimens by flu vaccine prior to NPS collection could lead to false detection by BioCode
RPP.
10. Carry-Over Contamination:
A formal carry-over study in support of this regulatory submission for the BioCode RPP was
not performed, since carry-over studies with high positive samples followed by negative
samples have been performed for the FDA-cleared BioCode GPP using both the NucliSENS
easyMAG (K180041) and the MagNA Pure 96 systems (K190585). No carry-over has been
observed.
11. Competitive Inhibition:
An analytical study was performed to evaluate the potential for inhibition in samples with
mixed infections. Simulated NPS (sNPS) in UTM matrix was spiked with one target at high
concentration (≥106 CFU/mL or CCU/mL for bacteria and ≥105 TCID /mL for viruses) and
50
two targets at low concentrations (≤ 3x LoD).
Common respiratory tract co-infections were determined by reviewing results of previous
Respiratory Pathogen Panel clinical trials from published 510k summaries,
publications/posters and internal clinical sample testing. Each sample was extracted in
triplicate using the NucliSENS easyMAG and each extraction tested in singlet with the
BioCode RPP on the BioCode MDx-3000 system.
Summary results of this study are presented in Table 33 below. No inhibition was observed at
the concentrations tested in this study.

1. Prospective Clinical Study
The clinical performance of the BioCode RPP was established in a multi-center study
conducted during periods of the 2017-2019 respiratory illness seasons. Residual (leftover)
and de-identified nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens in VTM or UTM that were
prospectively collected from patients suspected of respiratory tract infections at five
geographically diverse clinical sites in the U.S. were enrolled and tested with the BioCode
RPP at five testing sites during the prospective clinical study. The enrolled prospective
specimens were tested freshly with an FDA-cleared molecular multiplexed respiratory
pathogen panel as part of the Stand of Care (SOC), and were either tested freshly with the
BioCode RPP (Category I specimens, i.e., specimens that were stored in a 2-8°C refrigerator
for no more than 7 days), or stored frozen and then thawed and tested with the BioCode RPP
at a testing site at a later date (Category II specimens, i.e., specimens that were initially
stored in a 2-8°C refrigerator but were not able to be tested by the BioCode RPP within 7
days from specimen collection).

A waiver of the informed consent requirement was obtained from the Institutional Review
Boards (IRBs) at each specimen enrollment site for the use of residual NPS in VTM or UTM
specimens.
The following information was recorded on the Case Report Form (CRF) for each subject
from whom a specimen was enrolled:
• Age and sex
• Date and time of specimen collection
• Standard of care (SOC) comparator test result
• Specimen storage status, i.e., fresh or frozen
A total of 2654 residual NPS specimens in VTM or UTM that were prospectively collected at
the five clinical sites from August 2017 to May 2019 were enrolled initially for the clinical
study. Five specimens were withdrawn from the clinical study due to incomplete data
collection and testing, resulted in a total of 2649 prospective specimens (1401 Category I and
1248 Category II specimens) that were included in the prospective clinical study.
The prospective specimens enrolled for evaluation were tested at the five testing sites by
trained laboratory personnel. DNA/RNA was extracted using either the BioMerieux
NucliSENS easyMAG system or Roche MagNA Pure 96 system. After extraction, the
samples were tested using the BioCode RPP on the BioCode MDx-3000 System according to
the instructions for use.

Prospective Clinical Study System and Specimen Validity Rate
The overall success rate for initial specimen testing in the prospective study was 98.8%
(2618/2649) (95% CI: 98.3% - 99.2%); 31 tests were unsuccessful (26 tests with an invalid
result and 5 tests due to low BMB count/instrument error). Upon a single retest per the
instructions for use, 29 of the 31 initially unsuccessful specimens generated a valid result.
The final validity rate was 99.9% (2647/2649) (95% CI: 99.7%-100%).
Prospective Clinical Study Performance
Performance of the BioCode RPP was evaluated by comparing the BioCode RPP test results
with those of an FDA-cleared molecular multiplexed respiratory pathogen panel. Positive
percent agreement (PPA) was calculated as TP/(TP + FN) (TP = true positive or positive by
both the comparator method and BioCode RPP; FN = false negative or negative by BioCode
RPP only). Negative percent agreement was calculated as TN/(TN + FP) (TN = true negative
or negative by both the comparator method and BioCode RPP; FP = false positive or positive
by BioCode RPP only). The score binomial two-sided 95% confidence interval was also
calculated. Samples for which false positive and/or false negative results (i.e., discrepant
results) were obtained when comparing the BioCode RPP results to the comparator method
results were further investigated. The discrepancy investigation was mainly conducted by
performing independent molecular tests, including analytically validated PCR followed by
bi-directional sequencing assays and alternate NAATs.
Of the 2649 specimens included in the prospective clinical study, two specimens, one
Category I and one Category II specimens, obtained a final “invalid” result from the BioCode
RPP, and were excluded from the performance analyses for all analytes. In addition, three
specimens, one Category I and two Category II specimens, obtained a final influenza A
“indeterminate” result by the BioCode RPP, and two specimens, one Category I and one
Category II specimens obtained an influenza A “equivocal” result from the comparator
method. They were included in the performance analyses for all analytes but excluded from
the performance calculations for Flu A and Flu A subtypes. Furthermore, two Category II
specimens obtained a valid influenza A result by the comparator method without the
accompanying Flu A subtyping results. They were included in the performance analyses for
all analytes but excluded from the performance calculations for Flu A subtypes.

The performance of the BioCode RPP overall testing of Category I specimens was similar to
that of testing Category II specimens. In addition, the performance of the BioCode RPP
testing prospective specimens was also analyzed stratified by study sites and by extraction
methods. No significant performance differences between the two extraction methods,
NucliSENS easyMAG and MagNA Pure 96, or among the five study sites, were observed.
Prospective Clinical Study Influenza A and Subtyping Analysis
A total of 15 specimens generated an initial “Influenza A Indeterminate” result. 14 of the 15
samples had sufficient residual volume and were retested per the instructions for use. Upon
retest, 12 of the 14 specimens obtained a final unequivocal Influenza A and subtyping result
and two of the 14 specimens remained as “Influenza A Indeterminate”. The percentage of
samples that reported a final “Influenza A Indeterminate” result after retest was 0.1%
(3/2647).
A total of 29 specimens generated an initial “Influenza A (no subtype detected)” result. 15 of
the 29 samples had sufficient residual volume and were retested per the instructions for use.
Upon retest, six of the 15 samples remained to be “Influenza A (no subtype detected)”, one
of the 15 samples generated an Influenza A/H3 result, and eight of the 15 samples generated
an Influenza A negative result. Out of a total of 238 specimens that obtained a final Influenza
A positive result after retest, 20 specimens were reported as “Influenza A (no subtype
detected)” (8.4%, 20/238).
Prospective Clinical Study Mixed Infection Analysis
BioCode RPP reported a total of 193 specimens with distinctive multiple pathogen detections
(7.3% of all specimens, 193/2647; and 9.4% of all positive specimens, 193/2050). The
majority of multiple detections, 87.0% (168/193) contained two pathogens, while 12.4%
(24/193) contained three pathogens, 0.5% (1/193) contained more than three pathogens.
The three pathogens that were most prevalent in multiple detections were HRV/EV (101/193,
52.3%), RSV (59/193, 30.1%), and adenovirus (51/193, 26.4%) (see Table 37 below).

2. Retrospective Clinical Study
Several of the pathogens on the BioCode RPP were of low prevalence and were not
encountered in sufficiently large numbers during the prospective study to adequately
demonstrate system performance. To supplement the results of the prospective clinical study,
an evaluation of preselected archived retrospective specimens was performed. These
specimens were archived NPS in VTM or UTM specimens that were selected because they
had previously tested positive for one of the following pathogens at the source laboratory:
coronavirus 229E, coronavirus HKU1, parainfluenza virus 1, parainfluenza virus 2,
parainfluenza virus 4, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma
pneumoniae, or had been negative in previous laboratory testing.
A total of 165 clinical specimens were enrolled for testing in this retrospective study. The
specimens were randomized such that the users performing the BioCode RPP assay were
blinded to the expected test result and shipped to one of the five testing sites participated in
the prospective clinical study for testing.
A summary of the demographic information of the tested retrospective samples is provided in
Table 40 below.

Retrospective Clinical Study Performance
The performance of the BioCode RPP was evaluated by comparing the BioCode RPP test
results with those from an FDA-cleared molecular multiplexed respiratory pathogen panel,
the same panel test as the one used as the comparator in the prospective clinical study. The
BioCode RPP retrospective performance data expressed as positive percent and negative
percent agreements against the comparator method are presented by pathogen in Table 41

3. Testing of Contrived Clinical Specimens
Some respiratory pathogens are so rare that both the prospective and archived specimen
collection efforts were insufficient to demonstrate the clinical performance. To supplement
the prospective clinical study and retrospective archived study data, an evaluation of
contrived specimens was performed for two pathogens: Chlamydia pneumoniae and
Influenza A/H1. These contrived clinical specimens were prepared using 50 unique natural
NPS in VTM or UTM specimens that were previously tested negative for all BioCode RPP
analytes. Contrived specimens were spiked at concentrations of 2x LoD or greater using
different strains for each pathogen. The 50 positive samples of each pathogen were prepared,
interspersed with negative samples and randomized before testing at one of the five testing
sites participated in the prospective clinical study.
A total of 110 samples, including 100 contrived positive samples, were tested. The results of
the BioCode RPP testing are presented in Table 42 below.
